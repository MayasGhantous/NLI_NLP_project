  but , if i were to strafe it , i am flying dangerously close to their base aa . 
  also , if you look at my [ full video ] ( https://youtu.be/8wkgcq6ucog ) at 0:13 you can see that it comes out of its spawn , just 10 seconds before i get the stunt meaning that it just left the spawn and i had n't noticed it yet . 
  as stated , it was on the minimap for 5-10 seconds , most of which time it was in their base . 
  what are you trying to prove ? 
  that i do n't look at the minimap ** 100 % of the time ** ? 
  well here something interesting , ** nobody does ** . 
  so what is your point ? 
  yes . 
  i realise what you 're referring to here ... 
  noted for future judgement of other posts . 
  i just have a thing against the maa being a pilot , sorry . 
  thanks , glad you understand . 
  i 'd rather come to terms with my mistakes than just deny something and hold a grudge against someone . 
  i died once that whole game . 
  i was trying to take down the enemy attack jet just minutes before ( they were good pilots ) . 
  when there were no enemy air vehicles up , i decided to take my shot and i got lucky . 
  once before *, 
  how is keeping enemy air vehicles down `` wasting '' a stealth jet ? 
  ** that 's what a stealth jet is for !, 
  ** sure i have crashed a few jets while attempting stunts , but i 'm still more useful as a pilot when i 'm doing stunts than the average player ptfoing . 
  why ? 
  because i take the stealth jet , take down enemy air and ** then ** i will work on a stunt . 
  you seem like the 12 year old because time after time i say this , most of my videos there are no enemy air vehicle up at the time , so as far as i 'm concerned , you 're just bitching about someone who is simply having fun . 
  it 's incredible that you think staging would help . 
  how would it help in this video ?? 
  finding the campers is not the hard part , anyone who plays frequently would know that most games of conquest on rogue transmission , there is a player on one of the teams sniping from these towers . 
  so all i have to do is switch teams or join another server until i have a target/targets . 
  go on to psn and battlelog and you will find that the players i killed are not friends with me nor do we have any friends in common on either of the platforms . 
  you can also look through my recent battlereports on battlelog ( my recent games ) and you will find that that game was the only time i have played in the same server with these people . 
  i have completed dozens of different stunts on my youtube channel , you are welcome to ** check them for repeat names ** and ** i can assure you that there were no repeat names in my stunts . 
  ** ( my playlist of all my stunts can be found here if you want to check : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plzzscqe0cvracrms5evc840cq_-jdft5o ), 
  in the majority of my stunts boosting would not help as i can freely switch servers and switch teams so that the ubiquitous campers are on the enemy team , the idea of the stunts is that pulling them off is hard . 
  getting the kill ( s ) and getting back in the jet is hard . 
  finding the players to kill is not , so boosting does n't really do anything to help . 
  now then / u/blorgensplor / u/spyphi , ** where is * your * evidence ? 
  not really , it is as easy as flying a scout heli through the buildings on zavod is for a scout heli pilot -- it 's something which just becomes natural after doing it so many times . 
  it 's how i have fun . 
  that 's what i paid $ 100 nzd for . 
  and actually , it does serve a purpose . 
  got a jet on your tail which you cant shake ? 
  super eject and your jet stalls faster than you can stall manually . 
  so 90 % of jets fly past you . 
  by the time you get back in , you 're behind the enemy jet and you can shoot him down . 
  the other use is if you 're flying over the enemy base aa , if the base aa is shooting at you and its too late to turn around , you 're going to die . 
  with a super eject , you can eject out as it starts shooting you and the moment you vacate the vehicle , it stops destroying your vehicle . 
  so when you get back in , you 're usually unspotted , and a safe distance away from the base aa . 
  that base aa trick has saved me a number of times . 
   you try to pretend it was a `` 1 in a million shot '', 
  when exactly did i say that ? 
  which is true . 
   it 's painfully clear when your elevation was perfect ( as if you had done it many times prior trying to get it right ), 
  i have taken hundreds of shots on snipers on those towers , yes . 
  that is why i had the elevation right . 
  but that was the first time i had taken a quickscope style shot on campers up there . 
  previous attempts were always with other weapons . 
  you clearly mis-understood what i meant by that was my first attempt at that . 
   which is what i meant by staged ... i never said you had guys just hanging out waiting for you, 
  my bad , people usually do n't mean that when they call my stuff staged . 
   what is worse ... its not even original . 
  you are merely copying what others have already done, 
  right then , you name me a ** possible ** stunt which is original and has n't been done before after the game has been out for 2 and a half years . 
  i did n't plan this one . 
  i saw the campers on the tower and i had a sniper rifle , so within seconds i just decided that i may as well take a shot . 
  what i was really planning with the sniper rifle was to snipe out an enemy jet pilot . 
  that has n't been done before in bf4 . 
   like i said only 12 year olds will be impressed with your lack of creativity and honesty . 
  so great job , enjoy your karma ( and all those hits from the 12 year olds ) . 
  a comment like this really degrades the validity of an argument because you know it 's not true , you have no evidence , it is just a petty insult . 
  my main demographic on youtube is actually 25-34 , then 18-24 , then 35-44 then 13-17 . 
  i can provide a screenshot for evidence if necessary . 
   you are strangely defensive for a `` guy who is just having fun '' ... two long winded responses to defend yourself even . 
  having fun is one of many reasons why i do what i do . 
  that does n't mean there are others . 
  you would be defensive if someone tried to say that something you did which took hours to do and master the technique of was all a fake . 
  anyone would . 
  your argument still seems lacking in evidence , it is full of misunderstandings of what i said and quoting me incorrectly and it is laden with petty insults . 
  thanks man , it means a lot !, 
  goes really well with the bf3 theme tune : https://youtu.be/8wkgcq6ucog, 
  first strike, 
   he was on my team next game trying to do the same jet snipe shots and does n't waste the teams jets . 
  if he missed the snipe he cleans up the enemy jets right away by taking them down quickly in the jet . 
  that sums up my strategy better than i could describe it myself . 
  as a game , bf4 is amazing now . 
  it was terrible at launch , but the continued support for over 2 years has made it perfect . 
  no more lag , very very few glitches . 
  a lot of fun now . 
  especially with the new free dlcs . 
  if you 're talking about the bf4 theme song , it 's probably a bit better than the bf3 theme , but the bf3 theme just fit this one better . 
  nice , i have never had a collateral . 
  actually , i did it 3 days ago , the only place you may have seen it before is actually on my youtube channel ( it has been up for about 24 hours ) or on / r/battlefield _ 4 where is has been up for a little bit less than the youtube video . 
  definitely worth it , it still has a large player base . 
  i think that the whole realism argument is dumb . 
  the game has never been marketed on realism , only `` larger battles '' and `` only in battlefield '' moments . 
  good point , good advice . 
  i have much better things to put on my cv , we both know that was a joke . 
  i 'm defending myself because if someone is going to try and rip the shit out of me or hate on me/something of mine , i 'm going to rip the shit out of them back because they deserve it . 
  i do n't care if that 's what the haters want me to do , arguing back is part of my personality . 
  by the way , my original reply where i tagged you guys was actually a copy and pasted comment which i made from someone who got like -40 karma when they claimed my / r/gaming post was set up . 
  hahahaha , no . 
  if you 're going to argue that point , * at least * give some evidence , lol .
