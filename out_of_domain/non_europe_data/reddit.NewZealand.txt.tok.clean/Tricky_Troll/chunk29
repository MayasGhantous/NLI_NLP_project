  i would recommend learning it for any frequent jet pilots . 
  will do soon , i will almost certainly be streaming by bf5 . 
  but it does take me dozens of tries to get most stunts . 
  it is because i join games for one map and leave once the game is over . 
  most of the time i 'll join a game of dawnbreaker because next it is rogue transmission ( the best maps for stunts because of the campers on the towers , the cables ( for a whiplash ) and one maa between 2 teams . 
  it 's like they designed that map just for my stunts , lol . ), 
  once rogue transmission is over , i will usually quit and find another game . 
  other reasons i quit are if i join say an east us , asian or south american server and it is too laggy to do rendezooks , i will quit when i land on the jet perfectly but the lag makes me miss the jet , in that case i 'll try to find a server with a better ping . 
  such server switching also does n't help my win/loss since if you join a game which is halfway through , you will usually fill in the spot of someone who left in fear of losing ( most of the time ) i 'm not saying that that is why my win loss is negative , but it certainly plays a big role . 
  your player will only be holding his weapon when he is flying upwards . 
  so you probably are n't super ejecting . 
  what platform do you play on ? 
  they have the highest skill gap . 
  so its understandable , i recently tried flying one on pc without a controller -- i felt like a total noob !, 
  do you run a clan tag and what rank are you ? 
  that 's usually what i look at . 
  and by the way , i 'm in nz and i spend just as much time in west us as i do aussie servers . 
  except for inherited velocity , the bullet does n't inherit my velocity :(, 
   this is the only way to kill someone when you 're in the ** russian ** air force, 
  ftfy, 
  did you just quote me saying i am skilled ? 
  i have never called myself that . 
  i ca n't remember boasting about my stuff being entertaining . 
  there was no commander in that game . 
  if there was a commander , then you would probably see some uavs up . 
  actually , ** i am going to quote you on all of the fake quotes which you said i made . 
   what is pathetic is you try to pretend it was a `` 1 in a million shot '', 
  i have never said that one of my stunts was a `` one in a million shot '' nor have i ever used a similar exaggeration like that to describe how hard or easy it is . 
  the closest thing i will say is how long it took me/how many attempts . 
  any keywords in the descriptions of my youtube videos are for tagging puposes and are simply common search terms and categories which my videos may fall into . 
  for example : `` bf4 epic moments '' i 'm not calling what i did epic , just putting it in the genre of `` bf4 epic moments '' . 
   guy who is just having fun, 
  this quote is similar to what i said , but i never said that i do it ** just ** to have fun , having fun is one of a few reasons why i do what i do . 
   lets face facts ... `` this total accident '', 
  i never referred to this as a total accident . 
  i said : * `` i was very surprised when i got this . 
  i never planned to do this , i just saw the snipers on the tower and figured i may as well take a shot while i waited for an enemy jet or heli to spawn . 
  somehow i got very lucky and got it first shot . 
  '' * that is very different to what you suggested . 
  the reason that there is n't an animation is because , particularly tanks etc , it will be really frustrating dying while getting in/out and it breaks to fast flow of the game . 
  i would say i have posted a lot of them . 
  soonest ? 
   for starters , it looks like when the player fired the sniper rifle , he was aiming well above and beyond the target . 
  i thought this too at first . 
  but , look at [ these ] ( http://imgur.com/a/lxpz8 ) as you can see , i fired in the frame between these two frames ( look at the ammo count ) i say between these two frames because i was playing at 60 fps and recording at 30 . 
  the players head is roughly between these two frames . 
   and then when he gets back into the jet ; he actually falls past it and yet is somehow able to get in anyway, 
  that is lag . 
  the server thinks that the jet is further in front of where i see it as being , so i intentionally counter for this . 
  how do i know ? 
  2 reasons . 
  if you are on a local , low ping server you can land on the cockpit and get in , whereas , on a high ping server , you will just slide off the back of the jet , even though you landed on the cockpit . 
  if you look at older rendezook videos from back when bf4 was notorious for lag problems , people had to lead the jet a lot more than they do today . 
   you might say `` oh , well , they model the physics , so that affects where you shoot . '', 
  if that were the case , after jumping out of a plane going like 400 knots the sniper should have aimed behind the target . 
  not past it . 
  dice la , the support dev team nearly added inherited velocity , but removed it after negative reviews from the cte testing community . 
  battlefield 4, 
  i thought this too at first . 
  but , look at [ these ] ( http://imgur.com/a/lxpz8 ) as you can see , i fired in the frame between these two frames ( look at the ammo count ) i say between these two frames because i was playing at 60 fps and recording at 30 . 
  the players head is roughly between these two frames . 
  this has not been posted before . 
  i got it 3 days ago and i only uploaded it to youtube and / r/battlefield _ 4 24 hours ago . 
  thanks !, 
  although i feel like there was some luck in this one !, 
  i thought this too at first . 
  but , look at [ these ] ( http://imgur.com/a/lxpz8 ) as you can see , i fired in the frame between these two frames ( look at the ammo count ) i say between these two frames because i was playing at 60 fps and recording at 30 . 
  the players head is roughly between these two frames . 
  and the shooter 's velocity does not impact the velocity of the bullet . 
  dice , the devs experimented and tested inherited velocity with the community for a while but it never got put in the full game because it was n't liked . 
  these two frames ( recorded at 30 fps and played at 60fps ) suggest that in the unrecorded frame between these two suggest that my aim was pretty close . 
  that was my initial reaction though . 
  and that was posted less than 24 hours ago . 
  nah , hitmarkers are n't received until a message to confirm a hit is received from the server , that is lag . 
  look [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/a/lxpz8 ) and look at the ammo count , this was recorded at 30 fps and played at 60 fps , so i shot in the frame between which was quite close to his head . 
  i felt the same way about it at first , i did n't think that it actually hit either . 
  it 's a good game now since all the lag and most of the glitches have been fixed and the free dlcs released a few months ago were great !, 
  [ i did that to someone before . ], 
  ( https://youtu.be/eatjjapwcfs ), 
  actually , stealth jets in bf4 are notoriously bad against infantry . 
  it takes 10 shots to kill and 5 shots to the head . 
  its missiles are lock-on only so they do n't help either . 
  i did it for style points while i was waiting for an enemy air vehicle to spawn since the role of a stealth jet is anti-air and there were no air vehicles up . 
  not to mention that it takes 10 20mm stealth jet cannon bullets to kill infantry in bf4 ... just like in real life . 
  that 's one of the small thing which i appreciated in battlefield hardline . 
  the scout elite sniper had a really tight hipfire reticle . 
  i think the fact that i was still in the aiming animation really screwed up the whole look of it . 
  i 'm generally not cocky , look through my comment history and you 'll find that . 
  but the odd comment like that comes out . 
  i say that because if you look at most of the new stunts done in bf4 these days , there are n't many people who do them ** anymore ** so anything recent is likely mine since all of the other stunters i know do n't post to reddit , so i was actually responding quite honestly , but i see where you are coming from . 
  there is no aim assist for sniper rifles in battlefield 4 . 
  also , aim assist does n't aim for the head anyway and it was a headshot . 
  that is lag . 
  the server thinks that the jet is further in front of where i see it as being , so i intentionally counter for this . 
  how do i know ? 
  2 reasons . 
  if you are on a local , low ping server you can land on the cockpit and get in , whereas , on a high ping server , you will just slide off the back of the jet , even though you landed on the cockpit . 
  if you look at older rendezook videos from back when bf4 was notorious for lag problems , people had to lead the jet a lot more than they do today . 
  yep . 
  and if you hit reload when you can , you continue to reload when falling , just without the animation .
