  i 'm pretty sure i have seen you a few times . 
  west us is sometimes better when the aus servers are struggling with packet loss as usual . 
  i 'm on fibre too , so i do n't usually have problems . 
  nope . 
  i got this just 3 days ago and i uploaded it to youtube and / r/battlefield _ 4 24 hours ago . 
  you 're gon na despise me when i tell you that my sensitivity is 16 % ... 
  it takes 2 seconds to do a 360 ... 
  12 year olds . 
  i feel the same way . 
  haha , thanks, 
  that 's a good idea , maybe a second ( no more though ) of extreme weapon sway . 
  lol . 
  i can assure you that i have plenty of spare time in which to do this while keeping my life happy , successful and balanced . 
  maybe you saw something similar like [ this . ], 
  ( https://gfycat.com/badyellowishkingbird ) or [ this ] ( http://gfycat.com/deepajareeve ) but seriously , i just got that in the weekend . 
  that 's the editing , i accidentally deleted the original video from my computer ( it 's probably still on my ps4 ) and so i only had the edited youtube version , which i changed the saturation and exposure to brighten up the footage . 
  yes i do !, 
  been in a few of the recent ones , i 'll definitely be submitting this one . 
  damn right . 
  i do n't want realism . 
  the only realistic game which i enjoy is dayz . 
  guy 1 : `` it 's not realistic '', 
  guy 2 : `` it does n't matter , it 's a game and realism is n't as fun '', 
  guy 1 : `` but it 's not realistic ! '', 
  i think it is a dumb argument too . 
  ahahah , nice try . 
  i just started where ponylion left off . 
  took it a bit further , arguably not quite as epic or creative , but to have pulled off a `` rendeknife '' ( arguably not a true rende , but getting out and back in the jet as it is flying none the less ) and a rendebow with non explosive arrows before anyone else is n't following in someone else 's footsteps . 
  that 's only two of a good number of battlefield firsts of mine , so i would n't call it following a path which others took , more like inspired by others . 
  especially since i was late to the game . 
  yeah , i agree , but it 's hard to get a good bright video , it 's always either too grey and dull or too bright in my eyes . 
  battlefield 4, 
  they are funny guys , some of their video topics are boring , but as for their sense of humour they are just great . 
  ( particularly in battlefield friends ), 
  haha , 10/10, 
  yep , they 're still going . 
  this specifically , less than 10 , ** however ** i 'm not trying to boast about it , what happened was i have been trying all week to snipe someone out of a jet , and each time i saw someone on those towers with no enemy air vehicles up , i would take a shot at the snipers . 
  i just got ** really lucky ** this time . 
  typically , a stunt like this would take a few days to a few weeks though based on my previous stunts . 
  i was more in shock because i was n't actually expecting to kill him !, 
  i was expecting to get trolled with the odd hit marker with no kill . 
  the `` how about this ? '', 
  in the was very sarcastic . 
  so yes . 
  thanks :d, 
  there is no auto aim on sniper rifles in bf4 :p, 
  you have n't seen this before . 
  you may have seen similar , but i got this three days ago . 
  go on to / r/battlefield _ 4 and you will see that my flair is my psn name which is andy_98nz , just like in the gif . 
  i posted this video on youtube last night on my channel ... just where i put all my other stunts . 
  so if you need me to link you more evidence , i can . 
  lol , i like to imagine the first one . 
  i was ripping the piss , i did n't mean it , i personally think that it is stupid because very few realistic games are fun . 
  stunts have been in battlefield from very early on , like the 1942 loopzook and the 1942 loopsnipe . 
  i just do what i find most fun . 
  i can assure you that it is not a repost . 
  i got it 3 days ago and uploaded it to youtube 24 hours ago . 
  evidence can be provided if needed . 
  it 's called the su-50 in game , that 's all i know . 
  i was being sarcastic , i actually do n't give a fuck about realism, 
  thanks !, 
  i play on ps4 . 
  i have pc , but the servers available on pc are utter shit , nothing is a normal map rotation with normal rules , so i play on ps4 . 
  not shown : the matches won because i shot down enemy jets so that i did n't get shot down ;p, 
  haha , thanks !, 
  and i have posted something where i killed a guy on the tower with a secondary weapon repeater and my friend posted on almost identical to mine except with a .44 magnum . 
  it 's just the map , people think this guy jumped out of a jet with a gun and shot some dude on a tower then got back in . 
  i can understand thinking this , but i honestly got this one 3 days ago , lol . 
  are you on console or pc ? 
  true , but if i was someone who died a lot , wasted vehicles and only did stunts then my k/d would n't be 2.47 . 
  then you press eject and jump at the same time . 
  battlefield 4, 
  god . 
  that 's evil . 
  i do n't have an imgur link , only a [ youtube link ] ( https://youtu.be/8wkgcq6ucog ), 
  when you eject from a jet in bf4 , you inherit the jet 's velocity . 
  once you leave the jet , the jet stalls in an attempt to land safely with nobody in it . 
  i love that map . 
  it is easily the best for stunts since you get campers on the towers and the big cables can be used as a weapon as they can whip up and destroy a jet . 
  there is no aim assist for sniper rifles in bf4 :p, 
  actually , my k/d is 2.47 . 
  ( if you want to check i am andy_98nz on battlelog.com ), 
  yeah , that was sick . 
  that was a real match . 
  all of my stuff happens in a normal game . 
  evidence can be provided if you do n't believe . 
  no , there are 29 maps ( i think ) it is just the best map for stunts for many reasons . 
  srr-61 aka the intervention, 
  because it helps the marketing for the game . 
  one of the main marketing themes is epic battles etc. 
  so the devs intentionally make this `` rendezooking '' possible , then the small community which does these stunts essentially helps to sell the game for them . 
  seriously , i have seen so many comments on my bf4 posts where people legitimately ask me if they should get the game or that they are going to reinstall it . 
  i guess i steal them from myself , yeah . 
  the ps4 ca n't keep at 60fps on bf4 without such high motion blur . 
  it is off the scale of the motion blur option on pc . 
  man , that sucks . 
  i guess you have since seen it at home ? 
  yeah , definitely , i very rarely come across someone else trying to do something similar . 
  `` if i hear `` objection , sustained '' one more time , i think i 'm going to scream ! '', 
  was this ps4 ?
