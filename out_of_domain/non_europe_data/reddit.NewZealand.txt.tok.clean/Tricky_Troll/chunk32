  ** cough ** soflo ** cough **, 
  i think he is referring to when the community lets themselves down when the devs do n't meet the deadlines which the fans set when they decided when they want the update . 
  i would never rely on predictions on something which is clearly far away . 
  the only deadlines i would see as realistic is the next update since there are often just so many curveballs on the way . 
  i 'm as hyped for 0.60 as the next guy , but i do n't bitch about it because i can wait . 
  i would rather wait for it to be working as intended before we get it rather than having 0.60 now with a million ui and renderer issues which essentially make it impossible to play . 
  i learned to wait for games to be ready to play as intended that from the launch of battlefield 4 . 
  very true . 
  dat emblem doe ... 
  i agree . 
  2 weeks should be an absolute minimum . 
  anything will be better than the way it currently is . 
  you can get sniped from a thousand places right now . 
  the new cherno will be better . 
  `` my head pounds '', 
  i thought it was quite good , i think the animation system lets it down , but it is good fun as something different . 
   ridiculous hit damage, 
  realistic hit damage , ftfy, 
  you wo n't lose that stuff until you die , 0.60 is going to experimental first , so 0.59 will still be around . 
   i am a stupid bot, 
  ftfy, 
  surely that is the first gilding on this sub . 
  electro or berezino are better since they are less open . 
  depends on the role . 
  extreme cqb : ump, 
  close-mid range : aug, 
  mid-long range : svd, 
  extreme long range : winchester, 
  if i had to chose just one , it would be the svd since it is the most versatile . 
  definitely agree , ca n't wait for that acog to fit on it !!!, 
  damn , nice !, 
  true , i just enjoy the sound and feel of the ump . 
  yeah , i 'd love to get some action in severograd or novaya petrovka , hopefully tisy military base will change this a bit . 
  the community created the hype train . 
  if anything , they 're trying to lessen the hype so that idiots like you do n't fool them selves into expecting features which where never confirmed . 
  the issue is that many of the core parts of the game like the ex-renderer and engine itself are just so bad . 
  that 's why there are a thousand glitches and issues to fix . 
  it 's just hard to work with . 
  why are you so mad ? 
  lol, 
  understandable , i 'm just glad that i 'm patient . 
  based on the way you have been wording your comments , you seem mad . 
   why are you so mad ? 
  lol, 
  i 'm am asking a question . 
   based on the way you have been wording your comments , you seem mad . 
  i was explaining what indicated to me that you were mad . 
  please , explain to me how i am repeating myself . 
  do n't forget optics for the fal :d, 
  run to tisy military base !, 
  you need to turn the rv1 and m68 on ... 
  i do n't know where you got those stats from , but that 's not accurate . 
  did the m68 have batteries ... 
  do n't you love it when fucking retards try to pretend they know what you 're talking about ? 
  do you mind if i ask where you 1050m snipe was to and from ? 
  i believe that you can change it by going into the game code or something . 
  wow . 
  and yeah , it 's zub . 
  oh , right, 
  sometimes when rping or just fucking about on the coast ( it is a broken feature for pvp ) i wish i could run with my chest at a 90 \u00b0 angle to my legs like a retard again . 
  that 's a crazy shot , but that was long ago . 
  about a year at least . 
  at least a year based on the cte message and the fact that it is an old sraw . 
  pre any major nerfs . 
  however , it does not have the original hitmarkers meaning that it is after dragons teeth dlc . 
  rip effective sraw . 
  you have been missed . 
  and the fact that the sraw optic is smaller , the sraw turns more and that the sraw does n't one-shot helis anymore . 
  exactly . 
  it was nerfed many times , the biggest one made it almost not turn at all and the other one made it turn a little bit more ( by popular demand ) but in return , it no longer one-shots helis . 
  these nerfs were about a year ago . 
  in rod we trust . 
  he has a point , it is a first . 
  finally , i 'm glad i did n't have to type this myself . 
  next time , check that the wires are in a place where they will get walked over . 
  to be fair , i 'd do that to any maa camper . 
  i hate people who stall in dogfights : /, 
  not a rodeosnipe . 
  definitely not on a jet . 
  they 're the ones we see dying in backrages . 
  trust me . 
  i know all about the stunting scene and unless you can link me a video proving otherwise , it 's a first . 
  alright , i was a bit too fast to judge . 
  i know for a fact that a rodeosnipe on a jet has not been done before . 
  why ? 
  i have already watched every gamesprout bf4 epic moments video , i 'm subbed to most people who submit to gamesprout and do stunts myself . 
  so unless you find the rodeosnipe on a jet video or it has n't existed until this one . 
  ohhh , that makes sense !, 
  thanks for the pro tip !, 
  give me evidence . 
  otherwise it is a first . 
  i know it is a first . 
  no you have n't . 
  if it had been done , someone would have put it up on youtube as a `` rodeosnipe '' . 
  you 're just an idiot . 
  it is not on gamesprout . 
  i have watched them all . 
  definitely use bootcamp . 
  games get crap performance when running natively on os x. i play on my macbook pro retina i7 with windows 10 and get a solid 30fps on low . 
  my 600 are and i 'm upgrading soon !,
