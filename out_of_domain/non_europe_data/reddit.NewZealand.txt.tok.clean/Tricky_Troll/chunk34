  when i saw the 10/22 sporter i was thinking more about the 15 round magazine restriction . 
  cool , thanks for the info . 
  i love the outdoors and i have been looking into hunting for a long time , i 've always been interested in it but my friends and family all know nothing about it so that never helped . 
  ** warning : ** do not put feedback on 100 . 
  your ears will thank me . 
  i 'm not the only one ? 
  .22 s you need a licence for in new zealand . 
  this + drugs . 
  yeah , that 's right . 
  could the zeppelins be like titans for a titan game mode ? 
  64 players confirmed . 
  except me . 
  i am surprised . 
  this is run by trolls , just like / r/battlefield4 the real ones are / r/battlefield _ 4 and / r/battlefield _ one anyone admins here are just assholes who think they 're funny . 
  nope . 
  i have in chicken huts though . 
  as a fellow youtube who has grown quite fast at times then experienced small lulls , i think that there are 3 paths to a growing a fanbase . 
  first one is i think is finding an underutilised niche , or create a new one . 
  something different , or something which has potential but is n't big genre . 
  grow it . 
  essentially make a new genre or a new part of a genre yourself . 
  a great example is the hydraulic press videos , they 're something new which was hardly a search term a year ago . 
  give one of your passions a slight twist and work on it . 
  the other way is simply to stand out . 
  this way is the way which most channels got big . 
  ** you need a lot of luck on your side ** but find a topic/genre you love and stick to it , but make sure that your videos are as entertaining or as funny as they can be . 
  the third way is to something which is the sort of stuff you see on social media . 
  short and entertaining , short and funny , or short and amazing . 
  this is what i do . 
  for example , my videos are less than 2 minutes mostly and the actual interesting/entertaining part can be fit into a 15 second gif for sharing . 
  i then share the gif on / r/gaming and / r/battlefield _ 4 because i do battlefield stunts . 
  i also share my videos with large youtube channels like `` gamesprout '' and facebook pages like `` the gaming bible '' . 
  this method is a good one since lots of people see your content . 
  75 % of my non-subscriber views are from links/external sources . 
  ** this eliminates the luck factor in youtube 's search system ** meaning that you do n't need to get lucky and get the top search result to grow , rather you just need to make content which people want to watch and are happy to share with their large fanbase on youtube/reddit/facebook . 
  if you do n't have a passion for making videos which could fit into these 3 categories , then just do the simple stuff right . 
  make sure you are tagging and titling your videos the best way possible and ** make sure that your thumbnails look-a-like/follow a common style/theme ** also . 
  good luck from here !, 
  you came off as a really cool guy in your videos and i hope that you can find the fanbase you deserve !, 
  i 'm in the same boat as you , as far as i know it is somewhat similar to carrier assault from bf4 but better . 
  dice will add something . 
  they talked about epic moments a lot in the intro , so i 'm expecting some kind of stunt to be possible , maybe you can be a wing walker and pull off a rodeozook . 
  yeah , carrier assault was a lot of fun . 
  it 's a shame . 
  could you possibly make the pie graphs on fps into histograms ? 
  a pie chart tells you nothing more than the info table for continuous data and is literally useless , a histogram would show you the spread . 
  are you able to do this ? 
  it alway spun in full circles . 
  it was either the first of second shot to be fired . 
  that 's not russian roulette . 
  false alarm , russian roulette is not in the game . 
  alright , cool . 
  haha , thanks !, 
  dice will do something . 
  the ability to rendezook in bf4 was n't sheer chance . 
  they make stunts possible so that they get shared on the internet and get millions of views . 
  more people see the game , more people think `` that 's cool , i should get that game , it looks like fun . '', 
  it 's essentially a lot more marketing for the price of a mere few hours of extra coding and a little less realism . 
  feel free to tell me that i was wrong if the game launches and there are no possible stunts . 
  also , whether the character model has a parachute on their back means nothing . 
  does a recon have a parachute on his back ? 
  does he magically have a parachute though ? 
  yes . 
  i 'd be surprised i there are no parachutes since hardline had them and cops/criminals having parachutes also makes no sense . 
   he will probably have no more than a pistol and repair tool . 
  given that you can land planes and get out , i could steal a dead enemy or teammates kit or get a battlepickup . 
  that 's clearly not the case at the moment , i had a pristine red 9 with pristine rounds and it jammed twice . 
  i had a pristine red 9 with pristine ammo and it jammed twice amongst the 10 shots fired . 
   a single right click option that takes your stack and divides it into pristine , worn , damaged and destroyed for example . 
  that really should be a thing , it 'd be great !, 
  i experienced the same as op . 
  i had a pristine red 9 with pristine ammo and it jammed twice amongst the 10 shots fired . 
  the devs would have stated that different guns are more or less likely to jam than others if this is the case . 
  it functions the same . 
  you must have a bug . 
  did you re-log ? 
  also , every since either 0.57 or 0.58 you need a knife or other bladed object to cut stuff into rags . 
  nope . 
  they came from a pristine 15 round magazine with pristine ammo , the 5 after i loaded the gun were also pristine , as were the 8 i ejected and then reloaded after the first jam . 
  i can relate as someone on a 2014 macbook pro , the only differences were that i boot camped right away and got slightly better frams ( 20 in cherno , 45 in the woods on full low ) , failed , through my excitement of wanting to play dayz , rushed bootcamping , wiped my hard drive because i was rushing through the procedure . 
  then i had driver problems , then i tried bootcamp a 3rd time , driver issues -- no audio . 
  tried a 4th time , windows gave an error while booting -- more driver problems . 
  5th time with windows 10 i got it . 
  with 0.55 at the time as a new player , i struggled just to survive with the shortage of food . 
  loved the game ever since . 
  all of them were pristine because they came straight out of a pristine mag . 
  downvotes ? 
  lol , what for ? 
  i 'm stating that they were pristine and they came out of a pristine mp5 mag . 
  i 'd give it 2 months max . 
  / u/mekwall this happens quite often , the server info in the server browser is delayed by a significant amount . 
  for example i joined a server of `` dawnbreaker '' on a normal map rotation with 51/64 players and i was put in a queue , 1 minute later i got in and the map had moved on to paracel storm . 
  when i visit battlelog ps4 server browser on my computer it only lists about 25 % of the servers which are running and fit my filter criteria . 
  it is something which will occur around once a month , sometimes more . 
  it will typically last a day or two . 
  same here . 
  20 9mm bullets and no . 
  i enjoy 3rd person more . 
  stop trying to tell me 1st person is better . 
  i do not think so .
