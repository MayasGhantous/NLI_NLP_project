  i do n't want to be disadvantaged because people with better rigs can see me before i can see them . 
  that 's just as unfair . 
  edit : i realise there is a problem here , but lowering view distance is not the way to tackle the issue . 
  all you 're doing is reversing it so that low-end users are disadvantaged . 
  this is much worse since they ca n't ramp up their settings in order to increase their view distance in a way that high-end users can tone down their graphics now . 
   if you want standardized graphics you should stick to console, 
  yes , because dayz is definitely available on console . 
   pc is very much a `` get what you pay for '' investment . 
  or maybe you play on a laptop because when you 're a student you are n't exactly rich and need portability in a computer to do work on . 
   how is it unfair ? 
  because you 're giving players with better graphics an advantage when the way it currently is , anyone with a good pc can simply change their settings to make it a level playing field . 
  ( that is if the issue op raised actually is proven . 
  i have n't seen evidence yet , just claims . 
  it could easily be a myth . ), 
  finally , i play at a lower resolution than most people in order to get 40-50 fps rather than just 30 . 
  so actually , i am already disadvantaged since a player at a distance is less detailed and i ca n't tell as easily what gun they have or what direction they are facing compared to people who play with a higher than the 900p resolution i use . 
  no , my point is that it 's fair now because people with good rigs play on low settings or the mitsubishi evo race in a lower gear to make the game or car race a skill based game/race and not who has the better rig like in the situation youre suggesting where the best settings are best or the best engine wins . 
  that is less fair than having good rigs optionally turning down their graphics for a tactical advantiage or the mitsubishi evo driver avoiding 5th gear because he want to see who is the better driver . 
   make more money, 
  everybody would if they could . 
  especially a student who does n't want to build up an absurd loan . 
  that 's just an ignorant response . 
   but why does that person get the job over me just because they 're more qualified ? 
  why does that person get to live in a bigger house just because they make more money ? 
  why does that person get to go a better school just because they got better grades ? 
  you 're talking to a student , so money is n't an issue because i 'm from a poor background -- far from the case . 
  if your point is that because you paid more to play you should have an advantage is n't right , that 's just wrong . 
  that 's literally a pay to win game . 
  that 's what almost every gamer is against . 
  pay money to get the best gun in ^ ^ ^ ( terrible ) \\ games like cod ? 
  huge community backlash . 
  you 're literally saying that that 's ok . 
  if you pay for a better pc , you should get better graphics , but absolutely no advantage over other players in every way possible which can possible made even . 
  i admit that having decent gaming rigs lowering their settings just because they get a slight advantage is n't fair , but it is ** more ** fair than low-end pc players being disadvantaged because they ca n't do anything about the disadvantage whereas high-end players ** can ** make it a level playing field if they want . 
  it is n't perfect , but it is more fair than what you 're suggesting . 
   but what you 're doing is coming to dayz with minimum requirements wanting the maximum experience, 
  no , i never said anything about wanting the best experience , i just want a level playing field , which it is , and if someone with a high-end pc also wants a level playing field , they can have that too if they want . 
  the way it is is no where near perfect , but it is way more fair than what you were suggesting . 
   what 's fair is you either sucking it up and accepting the limitations of your shitty laptop or doing whatever you need to do to get something better . 
  the world does n't revolve around you . 
  wow , you sound agitated about this , remember , its only a discussion , no need to get salt about anything . 
   no , it 's not more fair that everyone else handicap themselves, 
  this has n't even been confirmed yet , i would like video evidence which shows that ops claims are even correct . 
  secondly , playing on a lower resolution ( which something which many low end players do ) counters this supposed and unconfirmed `` advantage '' . 
   it 's not more fair that everyone else handicap themselves to accommodate your shitty laptop, 
  lmao . 
  i have explained this before , but each time you respond , you 're literally just saying i 'm wrong but you 're not giving a reason why . 
  i explained it . 
  * `` it is more fair than low-end pc players being disadvantaged because they ca n't do anything about the disadvantage whereas high-end players can make it a level playing field if they want '' * please actually give a reason , you 're never going to win an argument by simply saying that the other person is wrong if you cant justify it . 
   what you 're asking for is the devs to change one of the main aspects of this game, 
  are you retarded ? 
  seriously , are you ? 
  i am arguing that it should remain as the status quo , where rendering distance is not limited based on your pcs processing power . 
  so i am asking that the devs change nothing . 
   to accommodate everyone else, 
  `` everyone else '' yeah , because i am the only one who does n't play the game on high settings . 
  th majority of players play do not play on high/ultra settings . 
  here are some tips for next time you have an argument/debate since your attempt to reason with me has been pathetic . 
  do n't unnecessarily swear , even if it is used as an exaggeration . 
  it gives the reader the impression that you 're agitated and it suggests that you 're losing the argument and so you 're getting salty . 
  actually try to back up your claims , for example you simply said * `` no , it 's not more fair that everyone else handicap themselves to accommodate your shitty laptop '' * you literally just said a statement and did n't even attempt to justify it . 
  i can hardly even take you seriously when you do that . 
  try not to misinterpret what the other person is saying , just do n't . 
  the whole second half of your reply is based on something i never said . 
  i did n't say the devs need to change a thing . 
   i did n't want other people to be restricted just ` cos i was though, 
  neither do i. i simply said that ops solution to the supposed ( and unconfirmed ) `` advantage '' of playing on low graphics is even worse that the current issue . 
  you totally misinterpreted what i was saying . 
  you 're arguing against nobody here because you thought i was for low end pcs having an advantage . 
  not the case if you read my comments properly . 
  i had a similar glitch . 
  it was n't rendering the ground , only the grass near me . 
  this was between staroye and guglovo . 
  i could walk on that glitch and it looked like i was hovering . 
  not sure if it was a one-off glitch , or if it is related to what you 're reporting .

  do n't forget , it might be a secret agent . 
  great idea . 
  have no mercy !, 
  ok , i will . 
  i have a dozen photos of it too . 
  thanks, 
  you have been banned from r/pyongyang . 
  this is clearly fake since battlefield 1 is not and will not be on steam . 
  it will only be available on origin .

  i think i know why the uk left then ... 
  you ca n't claim that until you know his medical record . 
  he could have an underlying disability causing his weight gain . 
  yes , but does he have a disorder which makes him feel hungry all the time ? 
  sure , it sounds like an excuse , but disorders like that do exist . 
  there is no way that the child was forced to eat 5 meals a day , and actually , there are many disorders which can have a significant effect on weight . 
  you do not know enough about the case to make a call like that . 
  100 % blame on the parents . 
  great logic . 
  i sure hope you never do jury duty . 
  yeah , its a good one , but i have seen this so many times . 
  actually the map was made and designed before public knowledge of the real chinese telescope .
