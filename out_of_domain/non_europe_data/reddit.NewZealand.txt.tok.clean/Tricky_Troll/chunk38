  [ jumped out of jets to land on those towers , knife a guy and get back in my jet ] ( https://gfycat.com/grimyrelievedcassowary ), 
  great !, 
  i ca n't wait to knife someone on the tower and jump back in my jet . 
  i 'm interested to see what will be done in bf1 since so far it seems as though a lot of the typical stunt stuff wo n't be possible . 
  i think bf1 stunts will be much more creative . 
  auto aim does n't work for sniper rifles ... 
  at least it was n't a painted sks . 
  two wheel driving does n't work as well in 0.60 as it did in 0.59 though . 
   guns feeling samey to each other like bf4, 
  lmao . 
  i thought that bf4 actually did well on making so many guns feel different . 
  unless i want the superior vehicles which are only on a particular team . 
  i was expecting it to explode with the slightest impact since it was the [ z11w ] ( https://gfycat.com/repentantinsecurejaeger ) . 
  as someone with enough experience doing shit like this that is as hard as it looks . 
  the hit markers will drive you insane . 
  especially when they are on jet pilots . 
  does n't work on console , you have to go through all 4 seats . 
  it 's slower . 
  shotguns make multiple holes per shot , it usually only take a couple of buckshots to clear the windscreen . 
  i think i was under it so you could n't see it . 
  i was up there for about a minute after i missed a rendezook and landed up there . 
  not an excuse for not ptfoing though :p, 
  pso-1 . 
  i find 4x the best since you can use it at ranges which i come across enemies at . 
  also , the pso-1 is the russian 4x so naturally it 's the coolest one . 
  yeah , i 'm aware that there are heaps of people who do it . 
  ravic is one . 
  i guess i do n't use snipers enough . 
  he is really good . 
  his shooting out pilots videos are satisfying to watch . 
  if you put that on with a high rate of fire primary like the p90 , aek or the mtar you feel unstoppable . 
  srr-61 with a pso-1 ( 4x magnification ) , muzzle brake , green laser sight and straight pull .

  i have been trying to do it on a jet pilot for about the last 2 months but i have only had a couple of hit markers so far :(, 
  or you could pick up the m136cs ( the battle-pickup launcher ), 
  yeah , the only way is with the battle-pickup m136cs then . 
  or picking up someone 's kit but it does n't really count since it is essentially changing class . 
  yeah , this title is sooo wrong . 
  how ?!, 
  the splash damage is minimal and it ca n't penetrate ... how did you do that ? 
  wow . 
  he was spamming it so hard it just looked like he was spasming . 
  there * is * an optimum teabag speed , people !, 
  there were no explosive destroyed points though ... 
  it is paracel storm . 
  he is a thief , apparently . 
  ah , i didnt think about that , the gas tank is most likely shot to pieces or leaked it all out . 
  is there a way to fix the gas tank at all ? 
  thanks for the help . 
  it was in the middle of nwaf . 
  ( not a high pop ), 
  awesome . 
  thanks for the info . 
  turns out it had taken too much damage since the fuel gauge was 3/4 full . 
  or it could simply be a glitch that it would n't start . 
  i saw this coming . 
  great nonetheless . 
  one shot from the pick-up weapon m82 .50 cal deals about 20 damage to a jet so to do this you need to deal about 80 damage to the enemy jet before you shoot it . 
  full version here : https://youtu.be/byocjjegtum, 
  thanks !, 
  it took quite a while to get !, 
  the sniper i used is the m82 .50 cal pick-up weapon ( you ca n't spawn in with it ) it deals 20 damage per shot on a jet so i had to damage the enemy jet before i shot him . 
  for anyone who did n't know , the game is battlefield 4 .

  ** edit : ** i almost forgot to post [ his response . ], 
  ** edit 2 : ** [ it does n't always work out ] ( https://gfycat.com/fancydangerouskentrosaurus ), 
  typo , that was supposed to be `` liked '' in the title . 
  battlefield 4, 
  i kinda showed it in my [ youtube video , ] ( https://youtu.be/byocjjegtum ) but essentially , since it is paracel storm , you ca n't land the jet next to the .50 cal like you can on silk road to pick it up . 
  so i go grab it , take a rhib boat back to the spawn and my friend lands the jet on the us aircraft carrier for me to take . 
  it 's a long process and so the stunt took a while to complete because i had to do this whenever i crashed the jet or often the game would end before i destroyed a jet with the .50 cal . 
  thanks !, 
  the positive feedback is one of the main reasons i do this stuff !, 
  as long as your character is n't falling in bf4 he can aim and shoot . 
  i shot while i was flying upwards . 
  `` battlefield 4 -- * realism not included * '', 
  you press the ads button if you have default controls . 
  so for most it would be l2 but for me it is l1 because i switched l1/2 and r1/2 . 
  yes , i was aiming in front of the jet to compensate for bullet velocity . 
  also , i did n't shoot him out of the jet , i destroyed the jet . 
  in the full youtube video you can see that i deal about 90 out of 100 damage to the enemy jet before i shoot it with the .50 cal . 
  if you think that a sniper rifle destroying a jet is unfair , it kind of is , but you ca n't spawn in with the m82 .50 cal sniper rifle , it spawns in the middle of the map and you have to retrieve it if you want it . 
  so naturally it is powerful since it is n't something you can spawn in with . 
  thanks !, 
  i took a boat to the middle of the map to retrieve the gun and i took the boat back to our aircraft carrier where a kind friend landed the jet for me . 
  i had to do it many times though before i got the kill !, 
  it is less accurate than other snipers , just be sure that you are n't moving/strafing when you shoot , then it gets really inaccurate . 
  i have no idea , i assume no , or at least he thinks i have bailed and he just wants the vehicle destroyed points . 
  i do get people who see my character fly up in the air and they try and shoot me out of the air , but nobody has managed to kill me like that before because the 20mm and 30mm jet cannons do less damage than pistols do against infantry . 
  ( 10/10 realism ) i assume it is for balancing purposes as it would be too easy to kill infantry with jet cannons otherwise . 
  battlefield 4 stunts ? 
  shit , if you want to watch more bf4 epic moments videos , they 're [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plzzscqe0cvracrms5evc840cq_-jdft5o ) i have so many videos that there is probably an hour worth of 1-minute videos !, 
  enjoy !, 
  there 's about 50 videos of about 1:00 -1:30 to be specific :p, 
  [ yes . ], 
  my sensitivity is so low that a 360 would take me almost 2 seconds anyway . 
  ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ as ^ ^ ^ extreme ^ ^ ^ as ^ ^ ^ people ^ ^ ^ think . 
  op makes cinematic youtube videos on battlefield , some of them are probably set up but still in an empty multiplayer server and the others will probably be using the spectator mode . 
  ( if spectator mode is in the bf1 alpha ), 
   you have to spawn in a jet , so he landed it , got the rifle , took off again,
