  matt and trey said that they just put them in some episodes and they never counted how many or in which episodes . 
  at least they say sorry when they 're done with you . 
  [ cartoons do n't have to be 100 % realistic ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1nd4o3ztfo ), 
  hmm , interesting . 
  by the way , your english was perfect until the `` sry for bag english '' lol . 
  why ? ... 
  `` small '', 
  that happened to me once , too . 
  [ actually , no . 
  one might dispute your definition of a country . ],

  hello . 
  lmao, 
  maybe make / r/withinarmsreach ? 
  it 's a great idea !, 
  there is a lot of potential in it !, 
  the only significant trend for survival and seat position is that the further back you are , the safer you are . 
  i do the same stuff he did and more but i do n't need about 20 players helping me . 
  [ i did exactly this stunt ] ( https://gfycat.com/completeweakkouprey ) with just 3 players , we saved the need for more players by making the jet pilot use c4 and by playing the objective beforehand to unlock the tier upgrades which let us place down more explosives . 
  i 'm sorry , i agree with you on it all except for the fact that win percentage isnt a fair argument . 
  for example myself . 
  i used to have a win percentage of [ 53 % ] ( http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf4/soldier/andsta98nz/stats/1095245921/ps3/ ) , after my first few months of playing i moved to ps4 , and knowing all of the maps well i had my favourites . 
  so what i did and still do is i will join games which are part way through , just to play the few maps i like , my quits is at 50 % because i switch servers so often to find the server which is most enjoyable . 
  what happens is that i join the game midway through and more often than not i join the slot which opened up on the losing team because someone was afraid of losing and so he left the game . 
  this gives a false representation of a win percentage . 
  [ here are my stats for my nooby self who would stay in the server for hours ] ( http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf4/soldier/andsta98nz/stats/1095245921/ps3/ ) and [ here are the stats for when i server hop . ], 
  ( http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf4/soldier/andy_98nz/stats/1303394767/ps4/ ) keep in mind that my stats for the soldier with the better win percentage is for when i first started the game and the account with the lower win percentage is the one which i have over 1000 hours with as a much better player than before . 
  as you can see win percentage is only a reliable statistic if said player does not frequently server hop . 
  edit : i also have an account of pc . 
  it takes longer to join a game on pc and so i do n't server hop on pc . 
  [ here are those stats , ] ( http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf4/soldier/tricky_trollyt/stats/1096061418/pc/ ) again , look at the higher win percentage . 
  they are n't scripted , he just uses way too many teammates to do it and people hate the fact that then the game is unfair to ponylion 's ptfoing teammates . 
  battlefield 4, 
  no , it 's indisputeable that the more a player server hops the lower his win percentage will be . 
  it 's statistically true . 
  i 'm not making an excuse for stunts . 
  you 're right , in the eyes of many they 're annoying , but i do n't need to justify it because i play bf4 to have fun and they 're how i have fun . 
  lmao , nice try . 
   low level of skill, 
  what are you basing that on ? 
  have you seen me when i ptfo ? 
  lmao , exactly . 
  also , do you turn games around when you join a game of rogue transmission and you 're on the cn side with 100 tickets left to the ru team 's 700 ? 
  interesting because that 's a typical situation when you server hop on ps4 . 
  on pc way less people leave mid-game and they all leave once the game is over , on ps4 people are always leaving the game and so you take their slots which is mostly on the losing team . 
  i would like to see stats if losses which occur after joining midway through a game did n't count . 
  my stats would be totally different . 
  that 's it !, 
  back to winnipeg !, 
   do not try to market yourself as a good player, 
  lmao . 
  did you even read what i said ? 
  i never said i was a good player , i only said that i was n't a player with a `` low level of skill '' . 
  if you have seen me anywhere else on reddit , you would realise that i play bf4 for fun , not to win . 
  i join and leave servers depending on which is most appropriate for me to : 1 . 
  complete a stunt i 'm trying to do . 
  or what ever map i feel like playing while avoiding map i do n't want to play . 
   i leave servers when my team is losing with 20 tickets left to go , but i have a 21 % quit rate and a 91 % win ratio . 
  you 're literally proving my point , this makes your win/loss stat horribly unreliable and people like me take that place you opened up on the losing team . 
  thanks for proving my point !, 
  i doubt you server hop to the point that you leave every second game like i do . 
  because i join every second game i play while it is midway through , and as / u/uz7l88 demonstrated , people leave because they 're losing , and people who do n't care join and take his slot , immediately losing . 
  if i really was detrimental to my team then i would have a much lower win loss which would be below 40 % , instead it is only slightly below 50 % because i win most game which i play 100 % of the way through . 
  lmao , i run solo more often than not . 
  i will destroy vehicles with my jet while i wait for the opportunity to attempt a stunt . 
  either way , whenever i am in the stealth jet i am doing what it 's designed for -- taking out other jets because while jets are up , i ca n't attempt stunts which involve killing infantry or helicopters . 
   do your stunts on a private server . 
  everyone knows they are staged . 
  this one always cracks me up . 
  i get this all the time . 
  dozens of people accuse me of this yet not a single person has ever provided evidence of this . 
  look through the names of people i have killed in my stunts . 
  no repeat names . 
  none of them are my friends on battlelog , none of them will show up on my recent battlereports . 
  why ? 
  because they are all random people who were unlucky enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time . 
  the other thing is that for the majority of my stunts , `` setting them up '' would not make them any easier . 
  rendebow , rendesnipe , 8 kills 1 suav , rendeknife . 
  they all are made no easier by setting them up . 
  all of the players imkilled in those stunts were doing things which are common in full servers . 
  campers on the rouge transmission towers , the dawnbreaker rooftops or on my tail in a jet , they 're all common in game situations . 
  if there are n't any campers on the tower or rooftop then i can always switch teams or find a new server , and almost instantly i 'm in a new game/situation with new players who may be in a perfect position for me to kill them . 
  as for stunts with a jet on my tail i usually wait just outside their spawn so that when they spawn they see me and get on my tail , trying to shoot me down . 
  that 's how you take down another jet , by getting on their tail . 
  i do have more evidence but i do n't have the time or the link right now since i 'm on mobile . 
  please provide some evidence , be the first hater to back his beliefs or i 'll just dismiss your comments and laugh at you like i did all the others because i love seeing the haters hate !!!, 
  you must do a follow up after this speech has been shared . 
  that 's cool , i visited james bond island recently which was just to the north . 
  we were going to visit phi phi island but last minute we decided against it . 
  looks like i might have to go back and visit phi phi sometime !, 
  i went to james bond island and surrounding islands in the andaman sea recently , would definitely recommend . 
  the down side is that it will be very hard to find somewhere which is secluded these days . 
  same here , even worse , my friend bought a server and whenever we try to join it it puts us in a server which is n't his . 
  also , any changes we make are n't applied ie title changes etc are n't happening . 
  i reported this issue when the ui was back in alpha , disappointed that they did n't change it . 
  i mentioned that that 's not always an option . 
  hence , the us should be split ( if not many regions ) to more specific regions so that i can join the nearest server i can find . 
  with the way it is right now , i do n't know if i 'm joining a east us server with 250 ping or a west us server with a playable 150 ping . 
  i 'm also looking for someone , but when do you play and how many hours do you have ? 
  also , what region ?
