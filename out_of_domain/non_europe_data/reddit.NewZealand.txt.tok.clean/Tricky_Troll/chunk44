  it 's a `` launch pod '' . 
  it shoots you into the sky . 
  it was a part of the futuristic-themed final stand dlc . 
  are n't we all ? 
  use the minimap . 
   i have pics , but am not digging them out . 
  i do n't like looking at them . 
  then why would you tell us ? 
  you just like to disappoint people . 
  also , was his name dr. nick riviera ? 
  it has been patched . 
  someone just gave adolf hitler gold ... let that sink in ... 
  really ? 
  you ca n't even come up with a new name when you repost something ? 
  wow . 
  `` yeah dude , whenever you die you crap your pants '', 
  well i run it on my macbook pro , so you should be fine with your price range . 
  on the contrary , there is [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgnabjrx5s8 ) in battlefield 4 .

  i was n't expecting my gif to end up here ... 
  it worked fine for me . 
  played at 00:30 nzst . 
  yes i 'm on ps4 . 
  really ? 
  oh thank god . 
  thanks a lot . 
   go to controls  advanced and change the deadzone to 0 %, 
  ca n't wait to try this . 
  hopefully it works . 
  but then what about when i ads with a weapon ? 
  that will make it uniform while aiming . 
  that 's not what i want . 
  the closer to bf4 the better .

  i got bad news for you mate ... that video has been set to private . 
  stickyrabies 's videos were hilarious . 
  even inspired me to make my own . 
  i 'm not sure why he privated the video though :(, 
  ** edit : ** nevermind , he made a new channel . 
  here ya go : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sukfazxcgy, 
  really ? 
  but your description matches the video so well ... lol, 
  [ a little l8 m8 . ],

  they 're my top two as well !, 
  it was already an ugly b-hole i would n't want to see it after that . 
  i envy your username . 
  i do n't get it . 
  i do n't get it . 
  that was my first thought . 
  i ca n't hear shit when watching a gif though . 
  it was just an idea . 
  it would explain an increase in engine noise . 
  and i have no clue what a shart is . 
  work on your analogies . 
  maybe because we did n't look at that because we ca n't use the link . 
  it absolutely 100 % ruins air combat though . 
  i admit it 's great as infantry , but it is ** horrible ** for pilots . 
  i other leave the game when thick fog comes on a plane map now . 
  it looks hideous to be totally honest . 
  i was making absolutely no comment on resolution since it a gif which is only taking up a tiny portion of my screen . 
  i was purely speaking about fov . 
  are you joking ? 
  when it 's foggy you ca n't see the ground at all or any 3d spotting symbols and there are no other planes to dogfight since they all crash or bail because of the fog . 
  clearly , you have n't experienced the same severity of fog which i am thinking of . 
  got it two games in a row on sinai then st quentin and i just left because i literally could n't do anything . 
  it is not the same . 
  i have had games with light fog and others with heavy . 
  plus there are still issues with the variationof fog intensity between players at the same side since it is n't server side . 
  bf1 is good , but not great . 
  i can see myself a month from now going back to bf4 and loving the larger battles . 
  there simply is n't enough variation in bf1 . 
  plus the game is way behind in terms of net code and similar issues . 
  i 'll be playing more bf4 this year than bf1 . 
  balancing of planes . 
  tail guns are broken op on other planes . 
  it 'd be nice for the hitboxes of planes to actually be near the plane itself . 
  more weapons . 
  there really are n't many . 
  nerf to maneuverability of behemoth blimp . 
  i doubt it since dogfighting has a much lower skill gap in bf1 . 
  should 've stated that in the original post ... that makes a huge difference if you 're wanting a correct answer . 
  yeah , damage actually goes to decimals , so it rounds to the nearest whole number . 
  just what i was thinking since that was patched way back . 
  you can thank the mercator projection for making it look small . 
  or more accurately , making everything else look big . 
  darthveda and marbleduck . 
  my bad ... 
  i knew i 'd miss one . 
  another one . 
  damn . 
  you can tell i do n't play a variety of games . 
  pilot here . 
  you nailed this issue perfectly . 
  it 's why i 'm going back to bf4 until the next patch . 
  no , this totally was n't posted here earlier this month . 
  definitely not .
