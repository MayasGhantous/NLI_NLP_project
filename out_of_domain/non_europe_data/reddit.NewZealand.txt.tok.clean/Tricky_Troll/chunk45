  no way . 
  i have never seen this before . 
  edit : downvotes do n't change the fact that this is a very recent repost . 
  lmao . 
  nothing major , but i 'm proud of an oc [ gif ] ( https://gfycat.com/badyellowishkingbird ) of mine being in the top 10 posts of the month it was posted on / r/gaming . 
  well , my home country of new zealand is boring . 
  new zealand !, 
  looks more like conan to me . 
  it is now back online for me . 
  they 're about to find a hole lot more evidence !, 
  what is so interesting about this that it gets 4k upvotes ? 
  am i missing something here ? 
  could you please say dumbass one more time ? 
  thank you . 
  that was a paw pun . 
  seriously ? 
  i saw that coming from the first sentence . 
  someone had a `` big metal fan '' joke last week . 
  this one was different because you dragged it on too much . 
  i almost made a reference to that but i did n't think enough people would get it . 
  ahh , i see now . 
  that helped a lot . 
  i agree . 
  you only have to let your guard down for a second . 
  it 's not like they were totally negligent . 
  / u/daesthelos tagged me here . 
  i am the original op . 
  original op here . 
  i did this to my friend once . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shhcclkbkac&amp;t=0m36s ), 
  original op here . 
  i saw them on the minimap when i was flying over . 
  so when i flew around i took a shot at the roof , not at a specific player . 
  then i saw movement and i aimed towards it but this one was mostly luck since i quick drew the bow ( just pressed shoot ) which is relatively inaccurate compared to aiming , then shooting . 
  i feel you , but not that many people have done it with the bow . 
  in fact , i 'm yet to see someone else do it with a regular arrow and not an explosive arrow ( i 'm the original op of this gif ) . 
  but the point you made that there are tons of videos like this where someone jumps out of a jet in bf4 and gets a kill is common is very true . 
  however , you rarely see someone trying to do it in a game . 
  thanks for notifying me !, 
  that 's alright . 
  thank you so much !, 
  ** edit : ** extra thanks to / u/daesthelos for notifying me . 
  ** edit 2 : ** happy cake day to you / u/nix8, 
  `` this reposter '' was kind enough to give me gold when he found out i was the original op . 
  ** edit : ** i misunderstood what he was talking about . 
  i though he was talking about jumping out of jets . 
  actually , it is 100 % intentional . 
  i understand where people who say this are coming from but this is great advertising . 
  i believe that there would be people who have bought the game because of gifs and videos like this . 
  while there are people who think this looks dumb , there are others , myself included who saw stuff like this and decided that they will get the game . 
  people have commented on my other gifs saying `` should i reinstall bf4 ? '', 
  or `` should i get bf4 ? '', 
  because this reminds them of the game which had potential but they put down because it was broken . 
  but 2 years later this reminds them and they contemplate getting the game now that it is a stable fps . 
  in bf1 dice have added a similar mechanic which allows you to [ wing walk your own plane . ], 
  ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybhggrpgvr0&amp;t=0m41s ) also , they even added a [ special animation ] ( https://gfycat.com/wellofffrightenedcatbird ) when you do this with the fighter plane . 
  i do n't mind too much . 
  besides , the kind op of this post gave me gold when he found out i made the gif :d, 
  funnily , the russain/chinese z11w helicopter in bf4 would explode after such an impact whereas the us ah-6j seemingly never takes impact damage unless you try to damage it . 
  that happened in bf3 . 
  stun_gravy did it on youtube . 
  that was crazy . 
  i 've spent dozens of hours trying to do the same thing in bf4 but i ca n't seem to headshot the pilot . 
  i have only had a few hit markers out of 100s of attempts . 
  [ the real bf3 winner . ], 
  ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lroigxq--tc ) ( it 's the same guy , different clip ), 
  that 's the thing . 
  you have to activate inherited velocity to do stunts like this in bf1 . 
  by default , if you just spawn in the plane and jump out , you fall straight to the ground . 
  if you land the plane and get out , then back in you activate inherited velocity , allowing you to wing walk your biplane . 
  oh , and i have played bf1 . 
  the gifs i linked have the same username ( mine ) as the bf4 gif this post is about . 
  in fact , i spent hours in an empty server trying to work out how the wing walking mechanic works . 
  dice does n't want people to wing walk unless the person wing walking wants to do it . 
  so to do it you have to activate a mechanic which allows you to do it . 
  it 's the same in bf4 . 
  by default you do n't launch up in the air when ejecting from a jet . 
  you have to get out of the jet and back in to do it . 
  this way you do n't get every pilot in the game trying to wing walk in bf1 or `` super eject '' in bf4 since it would be kind of ridiculous . 
   all vehicles have an animation of you climbing in . 
  the behemoth does n't . 
  and sometimes it skips the vehicle entering animation for planes [ like so . ], 
  ( https://gfycat.com/enchantedelectricbasenji ), 
  just search `` bf4 warsaw '' or `` bf4 main theme '' it 's the main theme for bf4 . 
  since the final stand dlc at the end of 2014 . 
  i 'm a kiwi on ps4 :p, 
  are you on pc or console ? 
  that 's one way . 
  it 's easier on pc and there is a faster way for console but you have to learn it . 
  lol , thanks !, 
  anyway , on pc you simply hold eject and spacebar at the same time . 
  on console you have to get out and back in which can be done by landing or doing a `` rodeo '' where you tilt the jet down and bail out then quickly turn around and get back in . 
  it 's important to note that if you want to get back in the jet , do n't touch the wasd keys until you start falling . 
  if you do , you will travel slower and end up behind the jet . 
  use the minimap and speed control are the most important of the basics . 
  if i were to cover everything it 'd be a lot of reading , so i 'll leave you with these links [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_1999186985&amp;feature=iv&amp;src_vid=lithpn9xi6m&amp;v=yjso80ibl28 ) and [ here . ], 
  ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lithpn9xi6m ) most of his flying tutorials are really helpful . 
  he has some really in depth stuff in other videos , but only knowing the simple tactics is easily enough to beat 95 % of pilots . 
  it 's important to note that since those videos were mad there have been tweaks such as below radar which makes your jet invisible on air radar and immune to lock-ons from non-infantry sourced lock ons when flying lower than 35ish metres which is a really important thing to know and it can be used to your advantage very easily when you know what you 're doing . 
  i 'm watching over one of his videos now .
