  he says stealth coating is the most useful perk , that 's no longer the case . 
  the gyro stabiliser makes a huge difference now . 
  i would say it 's the best upgrade to use . 
  thanks , each sub still means a lot !, 
  they 're just from normal games . 
  i have done just over 50 stunts in bf4/bf1 which each take almost a week of attempting or more . 
  for stunts such as this one , i will find games of the best maps for finding targets such as campers . 
  because of this , you 'll notice that most of my stunts are on the same few maps . 
  if there are no targets , i can always switch teams or find new games . 
  it 's why my game quit % is over 40 % since often i 'm looking for games with players in positions which i can kill them during my stunts . 
  i often get questions about whether i stage stunts , but the truth is that very few stunts would be any easier if they were staged since killing the person is mostly harder than finding someone sniping from a tower or the likes since it 's quite common in battlefield . 
  are you suggesting my stunts are staged ? 
  you 're welcome to look through all of my 50 + stunt videos on my youtube channel and point out evidence that it is staged . 
  you will find no repeat names or names on my friends list . 
  so you think i have friends with 50 + throwaway accounts , some of which have hundreds of hours of gameplay ? 
  not to mention that almost every game in bf4 has campers on a building etc. 
  plus , if there are n't any then you can always switch teams or find a new game . 
  that explains my high game quit ratio of over 40 % on battlelog which is very high . 
  because i 'm always looking for new games when there are no enemies camping . 
  but i 'm never going to be able to 100 % prove that i have spend hundreds of hours doing this stuff in normal games , but you can prove if someone is staging these stunts . 
  so i just take these replies as compliments since they 're basically saying that you do n't believe one could do them legitimately . 
  really ? 
  wow . 
  i do n't see why they ca n't just do them in normal games to the ubiquitous oblivious snipers . 
   clearly missing the plane, 
  this was fully calculated . 
  ( i 'm op of the gif ) it is to compensate for lag . 
  bf4 still had fairly dodgy net-code back when i did this stunt . 
  my ps thinks that the jet is behind where the server says it is so i need to lead the plane because by the time the server gets the message about where i am , the jet is ahead of where i saw it . 
  lmao , i am not a cheater . 
  i have literally done stuff like this dozens of times over . 
  i just spend too much time in battlefield doing this stuff . 
  www.youtube.com/c/trickytrollgaming and https://www.reddit.com/user/tricky_troll/submitted/?sort=top, 
  that 's alright , i can understand why there was doubt . 
  to an extraterrestrial being , earth would be much more interesting . 
  i was waiting for you to say you used his ashes to make chocolate milk . 
  i like that sort of humour but that was terrible . 
  i 've had a couple dreams about dayz standalone . 
  never seen a single zombie in those dreams and everyone is friendly . 
  they were actually really nice dreams . 
  that sounds horrible . 
  i do n't want to alarm you , but your hand is floating ... 
  an edit stating your gender would 've helped with that story a lot since you ca n't tell until the second to last paragraph . 
   you assume all posters are the same gender as you, 
  you 're making assumptions yourself . 
  who said i was a man ? 
  and pop-up ads . 
  i 'm amazed that such accounts exist . 
  i 'd love to see one to see what they post . 
  i support content creators , even on sites which use pop-ups . 
  i only posted that comment because most people dislike them . 
  not quite !, 
  that was actually by my friend russiansock . 
  also on ps4 we did stunts together before he moved to pc . 
  the video is [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxlvjzh5qm ), 
  thanks for tagging me . 
  you make it sound like everyone thinks it makes a better gameplay experience . 
  there is a reason i turned the announcer voice back on . 
  because i prefer the announcer 's voice . 
  but he is better described as a denier than a skeptic when you look at it . 
  climate change is just more correct since more research tells us that the overall warming of the planet is only one of many severe side effects . 
  please , for your own sake , rebut all of the points made in [ this video . ], 
  ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owxorsixyiu ) if you ca n't , then as far as we 're concerned , you 're the uneducated conspiracy theorist . 
  ** edit : ** you should probably take a look at this too . 
  i have never walked in to anything . 
  also , trump is over-qualified to be the president of the usa . 
  edit : downvotes ? 
  i did n't say he will be a bad president . 
  i 'm suggesting that he is underqualified . 
  remind me , how many years has he spent working in politics ? 
  exactly . 
  10/10 for the title . 
  i agree , but it 's just something which happens . 
  it 's not new and it would probably be happening if the election went the other way . 
  people understand it , but the issues with it are just as big . 
  for example , one vote in one state being more valuable than another . 
  well , understandably with the blatantly racist remarks , sexism controversey and his way outdated stance on climate change . 
  these things are controversial enough to get someone who opposes even just one of these ideas to publicly display their outrage even while knowing its futility . 
  two totally unrelated crashes happening simultaneously yet are n't in any way suspicious . 
  thank you . 
  i needed a good laugh . 
   when you 're vandalizing small businesses and beating the shit out of someone you think voted for trump , you are n't protesting . 
  you 're being a piece of shit . 
  that is a small minority . 
  much like generalising trump voters as racist , sexist bigots , statements like this only justify why people who are protesting peacefully are protesting . 
  but you 're not helping by saying that . 
  you 're generalising the mostly peaceful protesters just like people generalising all trump voters as racist , sexist bigots . 
  ** can we all please stop generalising !, 
  it 's not helping !, 
  oh really ? 
  watch [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owxorsixyiu ) and please give me a sound rebuttal to each of his points ** and ** do n't forget to prove to me that the links in the description are wrong or unreliable . 
  any replies which are sheerly insults or do n't provide some real evidence will be dismissed as you saying you were wrong . 
  i find it funny how people like you think they are smarter than climate scientists . 
  people who have spent most of their lives studying the complexities of our climate yet people like you , blue collar workers , most of who dropped out of high school , know more than a climate scientist on their own topic . 
  i bet you believe that the moon landing was faked . 
  lmao . 
  what about the links and sources in the description ? 
  please , try to refute them . 
  so far , your response has only shown me that you have no evidence to back your beliefs on climate change . 
  oh , and [ this ] ( https://xkcd.com/1732/ ) yep .
