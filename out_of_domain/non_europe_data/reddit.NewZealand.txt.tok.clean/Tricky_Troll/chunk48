  it looks like a cadillac drove right into the building . 
  i 'd sure hate to be him !, 
  we need the outlet for our rock tumbler . 
  that 's not factual . 
  are you saying that your name * is n't * `` yougot thesilver '' ? 
  / r/totallynotrobots, 
  ! remindme 2 days,

  i was waiting for one to spawn and i got kicked for inactivity ... yeah . 
  the last major island humans settled on . 
  riding one of those [ `` hoverboards '' . ], 
  the mini pockets in jeans were designed for pocket watches . 
  they never really got phased out . 
  i know you know what you 're talking about because you 're a doctor . 
  if you saw it on facebook , it 's probably not true . 
  why are you reading this ? 
  you need to sleep . 
  for those who do n't know , `` weet-bix '' is basically the southern hemisphere 's version of the british `` weetabix '' cereal . 
  i think the company producing it has some form of agreement about the name usage . 
  different companies though . 
  liar !, 
  you stole it from some kids . 
  it 's been reposted there multiple times . 
  so please everyone , do n't x-post it . 
  thermite . 
  only the one right now for the autoloading 8 .35 extended which has a chance of playing the same reload animation as the an-94 from bf4 . 
  i believe that there will be some added for dlc guns such as the [ unica 6 reload easter egg ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic5gk3lzjl4 ) but not as many as hardline since it 's dice stockholm making this game rather than visceral games who made hardline . 
  ! remindme 4 days, 
  there 's still an outside chance !, 
  one minute after me and you get the gold ? 
  i guess i was destined to post shitty comments . 
  i know those words , but that sign makes no sense !,

  i just googled the term to find out :p, 
  not to mention his stance on coal and business ties to non-renewable energy companies . 
  millions will die around the world from climate change side effects in the following years if he implements his energy policy . 
  i dunno , it 's pretty cold up there . 
  retirement might be nice . 
   earthquakes in new zealand and japan, 
  so business as usual for nz and japan ? 
  thanks for the tag . 
  sounds like my extended rendesnipe except for the `` the player proceeded to snipe the pilot out of the jet as it was climbing in elevation . '', 
  which is basically the other way around to what i did . 
  i have never seen anything exactly as described , but the description could be slightly wrong . 
  although the warsaw music and popping flares when the guy gets back in makes me think it is mine . 
  basically what you described except for the `` the player proceeded to snipe the pilot out of the jet as it was climbing in elevation . '', 
  part . 
  so maybe [ this ? ], 
  ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lw4gilgw0 ), 
  i did further down in the comments . 
  it 's here :, 
  that 's pretty crazy , i wish spent the last 2 years getting good with m + kb : /, 
  just add me on psn , if you 're on when i 'm on i can teach you if you want . 
  i know a few good rendezookers on ps4 . 
  some who are better than me at rende * zooks * since i spend my time rende * sniping * or something similar so i never became amazing at smaw shots . 
  and if you have bf1 , i need a wingman for some of my stunts if you 'd want to help with that . 
  either way , just add me and we can play sometime . 
  nah , i 'm thinking for infy and tanks . 
  when i move to pc i 'd use a controller for flying still . 
  thanks , now i have to clear my history . 
  say , homer , do you like football ? 
  do you like nachos ? 
  well why do n't you come over and watch the game and we 'll have nachos and then some beer . 
  my channel has been stagnating . 
  i 'd love to give this a go !, 
  [ yeah , this looks like natural change .

  seriously , how can you not believe that we are the primary cause ?!, 
  feel free to refute my evidence . 
  bonus links : http://rockyrexscience.blogspot.co.nz/2015_01_01_archive.html ( this is has sources in the post from nasa and noaa . 
  http://www.newswithnumbers.com/2009/06/01/gores-graph-done-right/ this has a long set of solid references at the bottom . 
  how exactly ? 
  not to mention absolute destruction of aquatic ecosystems due to ocean acidification . 
  in simple terms for the climate change deniers who are too stupid to understand it : huge drop in commercial fish numbers which wo n't be anywhere near able to keep up with demand . 
  so you think that the sudden rise in co2 concentration is natural and we are n't to blame ? 
  lmao , you must be joking .

  climate change has long been the preferred term by scientists . 
  this is because while the overall trend is warming , the full effect is actually more weather extremes of hot and cold , along with numerous side-effects such as ocean acidification , higher frequency of storms , desertification ... the list goes on and on . 
  you 're come across as one of the people who think they know more about the global climate system and all of its complexities than people who devote their whole lives to studying the global climate system . 
  what a joke . 
  are you serious ? 
  acidification means it is becoming more acidic , * not * that it is acidic . 
  just like neutralisation is a process where by a solution becomes more neutral but it does n't mean it is fully neutralised . 
  the ramifications of just a 0.1 change in ph of the ocean are huge . 
  it 's technically true !, 
  what else would you call it ? 
  besides , that 's no evidence to show that ocean acidification is n't a major issue . 
  not all liberals give a shit about social bull crap . 
  many are liberals just because they believe there needs to be more action against climate change or similar more important issues . 
  there are many liberals who are pro-gun too . 
  so linking that opinion to liberals is like calling all trump supporters racist which simply is n't true . 
  but i digress , this is / r/imgoingtohellforthis after all .
