  still amusing . 
  yeah , and it 's a problem . 
  not all liberals are feminazis etc , only a small portion are and not all trump supporters are racist , only a small portion are . 
  i personally have no major issues with libertarians except for their pro big business policies . 
  i could n't agree more . 
  i 'm pro-gun but want to see more action against climate change . 
  i 'm pro-abortion but disliked hillary 's stance on issues in the middle east . 
  why should one have to give up one belief over another ? 
  i 'm just glad i live in a country which has more than just 2 major parties . 
  i find it happens most when you have zombies chasing you . 
  someone is probably going to wonder how i managed to get dynamite as a pilot . 
  i landed the plane near the spawn and had to redeploy . 
  the good thing about this however , is that it means that you do n't see people in game doing this sort of stuff like in bf4 where it was n't uncommon for someone to jump out of their jet and try to do a [ rendezook . ], 
  ( https://gfycat.com/pessimisticsmugcoypu ) so for those who disliked seeing others jumping out of jets etc , that wo n't be an issue for you in bf1 .

  ( https://gfycat.com/pessimisticsmugcoypu ) i 'm sure that most players will see this as a good thing since to most people , having players in the game doing stunts can detract from the gameplay .

  you have to activate being able to inherit the velocity of your plane when you jump out . 
  all you have to do to do it is land the plane , get out and back in . 
  or , if you do n't want to land , you can do it like [ this . ],

  thanks a lot !, 
  what do you mean ? 
  do you mean how did i get back in without doing the getting in animation ?

  by default you do n't inherit the velocity of your plane when you jump out so that random players do n't end up accidentally wing walking . 
  that 's on pc , right ? 
  i 'm on ps4 but i 'm getting a pc really soon so i 'll remember this for then . 
  there 's a technique to it . 
  even now i can only do it about 50 % of the time i attempt it . 
  i made a [ tutorial ] ( https://youtu.be/ozvop7vdao8 ) on it . 
  the tutorial is n't great since you have to read the titles , but it 'll tell you everything you need to know .

  dice made it so that you ca n't do it without setting it up so that you do n't get random players wing walking accidentally . 
  nah , i spend time messing about in empty servers to see what can be done . 
  i just test and tweak until something works . 
  based on that you should 've skipped bf3 and certainly bf4 . 
  i have n't seen anyone else ride their own plane and get a kill on youtube , reddit or in game other than myself . 
  stunts are less prominent in this game than most previous battlefield games . 
  the tank hunter loadout for the attack plane has a quick fix which has to recharge after use . 
  you can only use it when you have a broken wing/tail and it will fix the wing/tail and about 15 health . 
  since i 'm assault i ca n't fix my plane at all so using this loadout for the quick fix is almost compulsory if i want to fly for any length of time . 
  ( http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/rogue_transmission ) it 's a fictitious chinese radio telescope based off [ arecibo observatory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arecibo_observatory ) which is where goldeneye was shot . 
  supposedly the wing but the lag between me and the server makes the plane out of sync with me . 
  sometimes on empty , low ping servers i actually ride the wing , and sometimes on some servers it 's like [ this . ], 
  ( https://gfycat.com/wellofffrightenedcatbird ), 
  i ca n't confirm it , but lag is my theory due to the variation i get between different servers . 
  yes , yes they can . 
  thanks disectra !, 
  and congrats to you for getting on sm64 's top 5 !, 
  looks like you 're going to win !, 
  yeah , weird thing is that there was little to no public knowledge of it at the time when this map was developed . 
  it 's the closest we can get to a rendezook . 
  the terminology for the equivalent of this in bf4 was `` rodeozook '' . 
  even though no `` zook '' is involved in this . 
  my experience says you 're not wrong , but as someone tailing you 're also to blame . 
  if i 'm tailing and a guy switches seat , i do a 360 and come back around and light him up when he switches back . 
  i totally agree , except for the pilot bailing part . 
  i think you should get kill credit like an assist counts as kill or bonus points if they bail out . 
  it 's the closest we can get in bf1 . 
  for the most part , no . 
  i have n't seen or hear of * anyone * other than myself doing it . 
  also , my k/d is positive , even with all the redeploying . 
  90 % of the battlefield stunt community which grew heaps from bf4 and things like rendezooks in that game have n't moved on to bf1 because it simply is n't good enough for stunts . 
  also , i am basically ptfoing when i 'm doing the stunts because it takes about 5 minutes for an enemy plane to get on your tail ( atleast this is the case on console ) so while i wait for someone to get on my tail i will be taking out tanks and trying to get kills . 
  just below the british spawn point there is a large field . 
  you can see where i landed it in the first few seconds of [ this video . ], 
  ( https://youtu.be/kxqcg_kdopi ), 
  i actually quite like it . 
  it wo n't . 
  doing this is much harder to do that rendezooks in bf4 since most of the time you just fall off the plane rather than riding it . 
  plus , you have to redeploy to get any decent weapons to do it with . 
  on top of that i 'm lucky if i get an enemy on my tail once every 5 minutes at best . 
  ( that 's the case for ps4 servers at least ) rendezooks in bf4 were fun and effective , so many people did n't . 
  these stunts in bf1 are n't any of that . 
  you should n't be seeing much of this sort of stuff in bf1 . 
   so basically you want to be falling at the same direction and speed as your moving plane is ? 
  yes, 
   another question if i land the plane then spawn as assault or support and get on the plane will i be ranking up those classes or will i be ranking up pilot, 
  yes , however if you do n't have a repair tool as a gadget then you ca n't repair your own plane at all . 
  landing the plane is quite easy on either team on sinai desert and the british team in st quentins scar . 
  the reason i 'm taking so long to reply is because i 'd like to answer the question , but it 's still there . 
  oh , really ? 
  they wo n't . 
  it is full intentional . 
  they added it into the game for people who do stunts the same way they did with rendezooks in bf4 . 
  i play with him alot at he 's usually a really good gunner . 
  ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ tell ^ ^ ^ him ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ mocked ^ ^ ^ him ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ post ^ ^ ^ though !, 
  spend most of my time in this game and i could n't agree more .
