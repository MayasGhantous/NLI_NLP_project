  the rear guns make fighters redundant . 
  the best way to take down enemy planes it to let them get on * your * tail and switch seats . 
  boom , they 're dead in 2 seconds . 
  this definitely needs adressing . 
  ** edit : ** oh yeah , and a rear gun can take out an airship in roughly 3 minutes from across the map . 
  no joke . 
  it 's stupidly effective . 
  just park your plane somewhere and let rip . 
  it 'll be dead in no time and you get at least a 2k point chain if you get the destroy . 
  this is n't a repost . 
  this is oc . 
  i 'm the guy who did the stunt and if you look at the date the gif was made and the date my youtube video was uploaded , you 'll see that this is n't a repost . 
  i 'd love to see the post you 're confusing this with though . 
  correct . 
  it 's the same as in battlefield 4 and rendezooks . 
  dice put the secret mechanic in the game to allow people to do these sort of stunts . 
  exploited ? 
  this is hard to do and very in efficient . 
  plus , dice intentionally put this mechanic in the game for people who do this sort of thing . 
  it 's the same with rendezooks in battlefield 4 . 
  you have to activate a secret mechanic to be able to do it . 
  you wo n't be seeing many videos like this in bf1 . 
  doing this is much harder to do that rendezooks in bf4 since most of the time you just fall off the plane rather than riding it . 
  plus , you have to redeploy to get any decent weapons to do it with . 
  on top of that i 'm lucky if i get an enemy on my tail once every 5 minutes at best . 
  ( that 's the case for ps4 servers at least ) rendezooks in bf4 were fun and effective , so many people did n't . 
  these stunts in bf1 are n't any of that . 
  you should n't be seeing much of this sort of stuff in bf1 . 
  nope . 
  just try landing in an open area such as the train tracks in your base on sinai or the open field beneath the british spawn point on st quentins scar .

  you have to activate being able to inherit the velocity of your plane when you jump out . 
  all you have to do to do it is land the plane , get out and back in . 
  or , if you do n't want to land , you can do it like [ this . ], 
  ( https://gfycat.com/enchantedelectricbasenji ), 
  by default you do n't inherit the velocity of your plane when you jump out so that random players do n't end up accidentally wing walking . 
  there 's a technique to it . 
  even now i can only do it about 50 % of the time i attempt it . 
  i made a [ tutorial ] ( https://youtu.be/ozvop7vdao8 ) on it . 
  the tutorial is n't great since you have to read the titles , but it 'll tell you everything you need to know .

  yeah , because they 're different subs . 
  people do that all the time . 
  that 's not a repost . 
  clearly you 're new here . 
  that would work to get the class you want , but it does n't activate inherited velocity . 
  you still have to land the plane , get out and back in . 
  also , you ca n't repair at all without the repair tool gadget , so i use the tank hunter plane loadout which has an upgrade where it replenishes a bit of health and fixes mobility hits instantly . 
  oh , you 're actually new !, 
  that was just a guess . 
  most new people do n't know how to tag a link with a word or phrase in their comments . 
  actually he is a ukrainian who moved to the usa . 
  it 's on his wikipedia page .

  this is in bangkok international airport . 
  i do n't have a photo , but a few years before this photo was taken , the clock currently labeled johannesburg was in the same place and labeled with paris . 
  i took this photo a few months back in bangkok international airport . 
  just checked , my phone says that the photo was taken at 40 minutes past the hour . 
  / r/mapswithouttasmania, 
  johannesburg used to say paris a few years before i took this ...
