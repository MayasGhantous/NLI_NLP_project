  red and white is the worst !, 
  yes . 
  a very recent one , too . 
  all of mine have been me looting and meeting up with people . 
  there is never a feeling of fear or a scary encounter . 
  that 's definitely not how i feel when i 'm actually playing . 
  i imagine my dreams are like that because i enjoy playing the game so my brain associates the game with good things , so the dream is good . 
  sometimes , if i find enough teddy bears , i 'll place them in a circle and put a pistol in the middle , just to creep the next person out !, 
  [ but he does share a common wall with a jai alai court . ], 
  you got a mens room in there ? 
  well , this reporter was possibly a little hasty earlier and would like to reaffirm his allegiance to this country and its human president . 
  if you use an alcohol tincture to clean a sewing or leather sewing kit before you stitch yourself up , you 'll be fine . 
  you can disinfect the sewing kit . 
  not sure how long it is disinfected for , though . 
  found the american !, 
  ** arma 2 : ** fully released . 
  lots of mods , different ways to play the game , attracts a wider audience . 
  ** arma 3 : ** fully released . 
  lots of mods , different ways to play the game , attracts a wider audience . 
  ** dayz : ** in alpha . 
  no mods yet . 
  that 's not a fair comparison . 
  just wait until mods come along for dayz . 
  then a fair comparison can be made . 
  i dunno , i 've been teamkilled a fair few times :p, 
  not always . 
  multiple times i did n't get all of my attachments/bullets back . 
  yeah . 
  just youtube search `` dayz explosive backpacks '' it 's pretty funny . 
  how did you do that without losing the left arm like this : \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) \\ _ / \u00af, 
  definitely . 
  i just do n't expect it to work every time . 
  where were you ? 
  it 's hard to tell with the gamma issues . 
  ok , i guess i need to head up there . 
  were they in the barracks , tents or in clothing ? 
  i always into my hands first . 
  flashbangs are n't working in 0.61 . 
  skalisty island . 
  plenty of 20 round boxes . 
  worth the swim . 
  i saw it a few months back . 
  stuff dries so quickly that you 'll be fine with only the fire . 
  i 've also made it across with nothing more than a heatpack . 
  you just ** have ** to update us on this !, 
  ! remindme 7 days, 
  thanks , i guess i 'll look for more helis . 
  also , a wall glitcher ? 
  which building ? 
  do n't want to fall victim myself . 
  i did n't say remove the player controller . 
  i said remove the feature where zombies push you . 
  it was n't in 0.60 and they added it back in with a few other changes when they buffed zombies . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  i 'm 100 % serious . 
  then why was it reintroduced ? 
  hehe , never barter with a chinese man !, 
  i 've seen longer gild trains . 
  i 'd be lying if i said that sounds like a good show from your description . 
  i use shift as hold breath , so i 'd have to change the keybinds , but the idea of a button to toggle fast walking while ads would be nice . 
  let me just remind you that you can fix a broken leg and run on it like it 's not broken after merely giving yourself a shot of morphine or putting a splint on it . 
  you can cut down trees with a couple of hits from an axe . 
  there is a 3rd person camera on most servers ... 
  while based on realism , dayz is n't 100 % realistic . 
  i like the way the hip fire mechanic the way it is , and i think it should be one of the few things which are n't realistic in this game . 
  exactly . 
  like 3rd person , fixing a broken leg instantly with morphine or chopping down a tree in seconds . 
  to me it is something which makes the game more enjoyable to play . 
  it may not look good to some , but it is the best crosshair i have ever seen for functionality . 
  he was leaning as well which only makes you slower . 
  he died because of his own incompetence . 
  if he wanted to rush that guy correctly , he should have either hipfired him so that he could turn the corner faster or stood straight as close to the corner as he could and * then * leant over . 
  tl ; dr : he should n't complain about if he is n't competent enough to use it right . 
  that 's not even a word !!!, 
  it could be a coincidence or maybe down to the fact that there would be more stashes/camps on a private hive than a fully populated public server . 
  i personally have n't noticed a difference . 
  and yet someone gilded op for some reason . 
  we need reddit mold to give reposters !, 
  i got your pitchforks straight from r/pitchforkemporium !,

  nz would just be that place where some movies were shot . 
  how the hell do you play when it is that dark ? 
  at 1 karma each , you 're practically stealing them from me !, 
  he stands for whoever pays him money . 
  great , there goes my plans to have some cool and different interaction with players this patch . 
  back to kos -_-, 
  and what if you got diagnosed with cancer next year ? 
  i bet you 'd scramble to get your huge medical bills paid for you too . 
  yeah , but that 's hardly fair until getting shot in the arm does n't ruin the whole jacket and the items in the pockets which are n't even near where i got hit . 
  ! remindme 2 days, 
  very . 
  close . ], 
  ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ibtyxem3y&amp;t=0m42s ), 
  i know the pain : /, 
  it 's happened 3 times , too ... 
  i highly doubt that .
