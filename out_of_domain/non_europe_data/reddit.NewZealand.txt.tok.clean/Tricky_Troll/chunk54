  i 'm using the term loosely as a hyperbole to suggest that they are the best at/think the most logically . 
  it 's not supposed to suggest that only the people in the logical subreddits think logically . 
  surely upon reading it you realised that i could n't seriously mean that only people who visit certain subreddits think logically ... 
  yeah , but what established republican would want to take trump and pence 's spot after two consecutive assassinations ? 
  they would tell the incoming replacements if you fuck us over or you 'll get killed . 
  if you 're in a group of people , all of you line up along both sides of an exit . 
  when someone walks out , all start clapping and cheering for the person . 
  some friends and i did this on the subway/metro in singapore while waiting for a train . 
  some of the reactions are priceless . 
  i ca n't approve of giving an animal as a joke gift/unwanted present . 
  the animal always loses , they often get neglected and not provided for correctly . 
  even if it is `` just a frog '' or `` just a fish '' , that 's just not right . 
  one time when we had guests over for dinner , someone asked for a coca-cola . 
  i filled his glass with pepsi when he was n't looking . 
  it just occurred to me that `` great wall '' will soon refer to 2 nations . 
  yes i am . 
  where are you from ? 
  ah , i searched the wrong terms then . 
  thanks, 
  or just jump on public hive . 
  actually people intentionally crash servers so that they can dupe . 
  specific actions in game can make the server crash , if players exchange items just before they make it crash , the can duplicate their items . 
  these people deserve permanent bans for sabotaging servers and disrupting gameplay in such away . 
  there was 8 of us lined up outside when we were boarding a metro train from sentosa to china town . 
  when the doors of the trains opened we clapped the people who walked out before boarding the train . 
  one of them just looked confused and then started giggling as she walked away and the other person just looked at us in a way which just seemed to say `` what the fuck are you doing ? 
  what is going on ? '', 
  i 'm not playing private hove right now because people are intentionally crashing the servers to dupe . 
  at least in public hives people primarily dupe in empty servers so the full pop public servers do n't crash as much . 
  i ca n't agree with this so long as any player can crash a server when they want with an in game exploit . 
  it means that people are intentionally crashing the servers to dupe . 
  at least in public hives people primarily dupe in empty servers so the full pop public servers do n't crash as much . 
  what time of day do you play and where are you located ? 
  everyone around us was just busy going about their day . 
  hardly took notice . 
  referring to [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/me_atm/comments/5q70im/me_atm/ ) post . 
  ( that post is shown on my laptop ) the colours of the keyboard and mouse are almost identical and i was playing bf1 while i saw this post . 
  i legitimately thought my brother took a picture of my desktop or while i was afk because the image was so similar to what i was seeing in front of me . 
  there has been a mixup . 
  [ that is actually me_atm . ],

  it 's never simple with dayz 's engine , is it ? 
  how is it gross when it is the solution to the server crashing problem . 
  people crash private hive servers to dupe . 
  people crash low pop public servers rather than high pop servers . 
  there . 
  less crashing . 
  i 'm not playing experimental until they fix the issue of not being able to loot bodies . 
  that 's half the fun of pvp . 
  well , this is my theory :, 
  private hive : people crash the server to dupe or when salty immediately after dying . 
  public low pop : people crash the server to dupe . 
  public full pop : people crash the server when salty immediately after dying . 
  there are less reasons to crash a full pop public server . 
  no they ca n't . 
  there are n't any logs which keep track of the actions which cause the crash . 
  but there is no way of finding who crashed the server from the logs which the admins get . 
  so it makes no difference . 
  they better not wipe the hive . 
  i looted 30 helis to find just 5 grenades for some testing . 
  i still need more but i swear to god i 'll be pissed if i lose them . 
  i personally do n't want to see the stamina system added to the game . 
  i understand that the current system where a player can sprint for basically an unlimited length of time is unrealistic . 
  however , nothing is more frustrating to me in survival/hardcore games is sprinting for 10 seconds , jogging 10 and sprinting 10 more ( or a similar mechanic ) . 
  i 'm all for making players with more gear run slower ( as long as it 's not too slow ) and maybe even reducing the sprint speed a bit and i certainly ca n't wait for realistic momentum when running ( to stop the excessively fast zig-zagging ) . 
  i just think that a stamina system is one of those things which would slow down the gameplay too much and the stop/start nature of many stamina mechanics implemented in other survival/hardcore games just feel terrible . 
  i can only hope that they do it right , but i 'm not confident . 
  anyway , this idea of caffeine and even brewing natural teas over a fire is a good idea . 
  10/10 would recommend . 
  with 2 people you can get an mrap on the main shanghai building ( get the extra c4 spec upgrade ) 3 people can get a tank on the long building behind the main tower using at mines ( ** do n't use slams for launches , they mess it up when large numbers are used ** ) if you get the extra mines upgrade you can do it with 2 people if you redeploy and put c4 on your mines since the mines do n't despawn . 
  4 people can get on the main roof ( 3 with mines and 1 with c4 ) and 3 or 4 people ( i forgot exactly how many ) can get a tank on the tallest elevator building between e and d . if you want to know where to launch from , in [ this video ] ( https://youtu.be/acddbcti-kw ) you can see all the launch spots i used . 
  ( it 's not a tutorial , but you can still see all of the launches if you skip ahead . ), 
  it 's been a while so i ca n't give you any more details such as the exact numbers of explosives you need . 
  anyway , i ** highly ** recommend this . 
  it is an absolute ton of fun . 
  plus , if you want you can try it on maps like zavod , flood zone and dawnbreaker . 
  good luck , and have fun !, 
  do n't do it on hardcore . 
  make sure a teammate is on the bike and make sure the c4 is underneath the vehicle . 
  i find it easier to put the c4 on the ground and maneuver the vehicle until it 's in the right spot . 
  i 've experienced similar in previous patches . 
  it 's hackers . 
  contact the admins so that they can ban the hacker . 
  best thing to do is to play on servers with the most active admins . 
  not until they fix looting bodies . 
  i had a squad battle in exp and i was the only survivor . 
  i could n't take the loot of ** any ** of the 5 bodies . 
  it was ridiculous !, 
  that was n't a one off either . 
  i have n't been able to take loot from a single body in exp in the last 2 weeks . 
  do n't get me wrong . 
  progress such as removing the apple picking bug is great , but half of the time there is something plaguing exp making it a worse experience than stable . 
  first off , the map . 
  ** if you want to get gear before you find players , the quietest effective loot route is as follows : ** head west on the coast and do n't loot anything ( loot any military tents and police stations ) until you get to balota airfield . 
  keep heading west , loot komarovo and kamenka then head west to kamenka military . 
  from here , if you want pvp run to zelenogorsk then vmc then nwaf . 
  if you need more gear , run north from kamenka military to myshkino tents and then the base west of lopatino ( north of myshkino tents ) from there head to tisy or nwaf for pvp . 
  ** if you want pvp as you loot up : ** skip looting the coast , head to staroye to loot the houses and military base . 
  from here follow the road nw to guglovo , novy sobor , stary sobor , vmc and then nwaf . 
  on a full pop server you will almost always find another player before you reach nwaf with this route .
