  it 's like me saying `` i remember they 're adding a semi-auto shotgun '' rather than `` they 're adding a saiga 12 shotgun . '', 
  it 's basically the same thing . 
  why is it so dark ? 
  i ca n't even see what 's in the shed you 're in . 
  forget a chicken . 
  yep . 
  it 's one of my favorite things about the gunplay in dayz . 
  that i like to remove the rng where possible and replace it with skill while preserving the unpredictable nature of dayz ? 
  yep , it tells you that . 
  there 's a line where realism goes from immersive to simply annoying . 
  having no hip fire reticle or just a dot in the middle of the screen crosses this line . 
  it is yet to happen to me . 
  possibly because i turn my gamma up most of the way so the dynamic lighting is insignificant ? 
  or is it server-side lag ? 
  i 'm not sure but i have n't seen anything like this in game myself . 
  yeah , but in a game where the stakes are high and hip-fire has equal spread to ads spread then you 're heavily reliant on luck and chance . 
  for anyone wondering how i was flying a plane as the scout/sniper class , i landed the plane in the base and switched classes .

  also , i did some testing and the light anti-tank grenade will one shot kill any plane ( even a bomber ) if it hits the centre of the plane and half damage if it hits the wings . 
  so it can be quite effective and satisfying way of taking out and low flying planes from the ground .

  thanks !, 
  there has been a lack of interest in bf1 stunts from the stunt community . 
  i 'm not sure why because stunts like this are possible . 
  sure , they 're harder than the rendezooks in bf4 , but they 're a nice change from bf4 stunts since you have totally different weapons to work with and different types of planes . 
  i think the ease of the stunts it the main reason . 
  you * have * to land the plane in the base and redeploy to do a stunt in bf1 whereas in bf4 you could grab a jet and do it . 
  plus in bf4 , you could do multiple rendezooks in one life , in bf1 you do n't have the ammo and depending on the platform you 're on , you have to land the plane again once you 've attempted it . 
  how is this what 's wrong with bf1 ? 
  the fact that you can do this ? 
  i am yet to see ** anyone ** other than myself do this . 
  on youtube , twitter , facebook or even in-game . 
  why ? 
  because it requires minutes of set-up before hand which you did n't have to do in bf4 , making the stunts boring since most of the time you 're trying to land the plane in the base and hoping it wo n't get destroyed or stolen in the time you have to switch classes . 
  even once you have attempted it , you have to go and land the plane again to re-activate the mechanic which allows you to ride your own plane . 
  every single one of my dozens of friends from battlefield 4 who did rendezooks ( the jump out of jet with an rpg stunts ) either does not own bf1 or does n't do stunts in it because they are n't fun to do in bf1 . 
  clearly you do n't have a clue what you 're talking about . 
  how can this be something wrong with bf1 when literally only a handful of players ( if that ) out of the 10s of thousands of people who play this game do this stuff ? 
  even then , i do n't do it most of the time i 'm playing . 
  i ptfo more that i do these stunts in bf1 . 
  ** edit : ** forgot to mention that people do n't get on your tail as readily in bf1 because there is not air-radar which in previous bfs tells you where all other planes are . 
  because of this you end up flying around for a long time in which time people at the ground shoot at you . 
  but since you do n't have a repair tool , you ca n't repair the plane . 
  so if nobody gets on your tail within the first 5 mins , you have to land the plane again and switch classes twice to repair the plane . 
  well , the goal was to actually snipe out the pilot , hence i 'm scout . 
  and if they get too close i 'll throw my grenade . 
  i have tried to snipe out the pilot +100 times with the best time being [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=md_mtzvl_k8&amp;t=0m17s ) where i destroy the plane but fall off my plane before i can get back in . 
  these two similar stunts [ 1 ] ( https://gfycat.com/helpfulunacceptableemperorpenguin ) and [ 2 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybhggrpgvr0&amp;t=0m42s ) took 50 + attempts . 
  ** this one ( only including times where i threw the grenade ) took little over 10 attempts . 
  this one was a lot easier since it was on pc so i could aim a lot better whereas the other clips were on ps4 . 
  i do n't really know . 
  the stunt community created by bf4 has mostly passed off this game when really these things are possible . 
  they 're just a pain to do . 
  ( because people do n't get on your tail as often and you have to land the plane to switch from the pilot class to something else . ), 
  barely . 
  although , that 's not the only issue . 
  people do n't get on your tail as readily and you ca n't repair your vehicle without the repair tool gadget , so when you take damage , you ca n't fix it later . 
  i only just have the motivation to do this . 
  back in bf4 i spent over half of my time playing it doing stunts . 
  in bf1 it 's about 20 % of the time since it 's just not as fun . 
  because there are no effective support weapons for taking out planes . 
  when i tested it , the limpet charge did n't stick to planes . 
  i was trying with a friend on stationary and moving targets for about an hour and they did n't stick to the plane . 
  yeah , it 's easier on some maps and teams that others . 
  for example sinai you can land in the base on either team , but on st quentin 's scar , you can only land on the british side . 
  crossbow grenades * and * medic grenade launchers clip through planes . 
  it is impossible for them to collide . 
  if you launch it at the centre of the plane 's body from 1 metre away it goes through it like nothing was there . 
  as for limpet charges , i was trying with a friend trying to stick the limpet charge on stationary and moving planes for about an hour and they did n't stick at all . 
  edit : it 's important to note that i have seen people stick limpets to planes , so maybe it 's just really hard to do . 
  if you land the plane and get out , then get back in , it activates a mechanic where you inherit the velocity of your plane , allowing you to ride the wing if you angle the plane just right then bail out . 
  i made a tutorial on how to do it [ here . ], 
  ( https://youtu.be/ozvop7vdao8 ) it 's not a great video , but it tells you what you need to know .

  they even made the mechanic for it . 
  you have to land the plane , get back out and back in to activate a mechanic where you inherit the velocity of your plane . 
  by default , you do n't inherit the velocity of your plane and so you fall straight to the ground . 
  plus , i think that there is an [ animation ] ( https://gfycat.com/wellofffrightenedcatbird ) when you wing walk the fighter plane where it looks like your character is holding onto the wing . 
  a big thanks from me to those at dice who do this stuff . 
  sadly , the bullet spread even while ads while riding your plane is the same as hip fire , so i would n't be able to do enough damage . 
  good point . 
  probably , but they do n't do any damage when impacting , nor do they explode on impact , so it probably would n't do anything . 
  good luck !, 
  it does , but i was playing scout so that i could try to snipe out the pilot and throw the grenade all in one attempt . 
  efficiency , basically . 
  well , someone figured it out in bf4 . 
  since doing this in bf4 activated the super ejector , one of the first things i tested was whether it activated anything in bf4 . 
  as you can tell , it turns out that it activated inheriting velocity . 
  one of my main issues with the bf1 beta ( this mechanic was n't in at this point ) was the lack of inherited velocity , so i was glad when i discovered the mechanic at launch . 
  sure , but sadly , the bullet spread even while ads while riding your plane is the same as hip fire , so i would n't be able to do enough damage .
