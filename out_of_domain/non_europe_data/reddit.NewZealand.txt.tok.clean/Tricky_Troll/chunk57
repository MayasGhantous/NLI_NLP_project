  well , in bf4 i ended up doing rendezooks with smoke grenade launchers , defibrillators , airbursts , repair tools and so on . 
  you name a lethal gadget , i probably did a rendezook with it . 
  so i 'd be surprised if i do n't end up doing the same thing in bf1 . 
  i 'm on both pc and ps4 but this clip was on pc . 
  if you land the plane and get out , then get back in , it activates a mechanic where you inherit the velocity of your plane , allowing you to ride the wing if you angle the plane just right then bail out . 
  i made a tutorial on how to do it [ here . ], 
  ( https://youtu.be/ozvop7vdao8 ) it 's not a great video , but it tells you what you need to know . 
  thanks disectra !, 
  really ? 
  do you have a link to one ? 
  when it first came out i tested it and it just clipped through . 
  sometimes . 
  yep . 
  it will one shot a plane if you hit the main body of the aircraft and it does about 20 damage to most tanks .

  i 'm going to !, 
  when you get launched really high above the jet . 
  like i do in [ this gif . ], 
  ( https://gfycat.com/wealthyenormouscanadagoose ), 
  sure . 
  it would , but i was playing scout so that i could try to snipe out the pilot and throw the grenade all in one attempt . 
  efficiency , basically . 
  oh my god !, 
  thank 's for showing this to me !, 
  i have a new stunt to try !, 
  internet points ? 
  nah , it 's because it 's a challenge and i enjoy doing something other than ptfoing sometimes . 
  what 's with the vss hate in this thread ? 
  sure , it 's not as valuable as it is rare , but it 's still a really good gun . 
  i got 3 kills with one back in 0.59 . 
  all 3 kills were a one shot kill to the body . 
  you just need to lead enough at long range . 
  one of the kills was cqb with iron sights . 
  it 's an absolute beast up close . 
  i 'm sorry , but it 's not shitty at close range . 
  it has a high fire rate ( it 's full auto ) and it 's a one shot kill to the chest . 
  the only difference between a vss and a ump in cqb is the magazine size which only means you need to manage your ammo . 
  [ oh really ? ],

  he says afterwards that even with full vests of any protection value , one shot to the chest will result in death . 
  the reason that people seem to think the gun is so weak is likely because past 200 metres the bullet speed is so much slower then within its optimal range of 100-200m . 
  since e = 1/2mv ^ 2 the loss in velocity greatly reduced the energy and therefore the damage the bullet does . 
  my experience agrees with wobo and suggests that it will one shot kill to the chest of a player within 200m . 
  ( no matter how much chest protection . ), 
  me and my friend who made the [ previous post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/5sm0op/experimenting_with_the_lag_when_shooting_bug/ ) of us testing the lag when shooting in stable decided to repeat the test in the recent experimental patch which supposedly has a partial fix . 
  the frame rate was about the same for both of us . 
  we went from approximately 120-140fps to 70-80fps which is better than in stable where we went from about 120fps to 30fps . 
  we also tested whether having a suppressed weapon makes a difference and it appears as though it makes no difference whether the guns are suppressed or not . 
  i would say that this partial fix has decreased the size of the fps drop by about 50 % , making it playable . 
  while this was n't a comprehensive test , based on a comparison to the same test done in stable , i 'd say that the frame rate drops to single numbers would no longer occur and drops below 20fps or 30fps would be rare for those using computers which play at more than 60fps most of the time . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** there has been an improvement in fps while shooting in the current version of exp . 
  the fps drops when firing are about half the size of the ones in stable , making it much more playable . 
  ** edit : ** this partial fix has now been pushed to stable . 
  i myself am yet to experience a drop to less than 20 fps . 
  i have been playing daily over the last week . 
  i could just be lucky , although the few drops i have had to about 20-30 fps have been unpleasant . 
  what 's wrong with calling a game laggy when the frame rate drops ? 
  how is that not an applicable term ? 
  yeah , but why does it have to be that specific ? 
  when i encounter people using the word it typically refers to gameplay which is delayed or slowed whether due to network or other issues . 
  i fully understand that they are caused by totally different things , but that does n't necessarily mean that the term is n't applicable in both situations . 
  i just see people use it in both contexts and so do i. 
  whether technically correct or not . 
  if you have n't been on for a year and you 're a bit out of the loop , then going up northwest is important if you want to find any good loot . 
  it 's more important than ever !, 
  persistence on public hive is currently active and tents/barrels will last for 45 days without interaction before de-spawning . 
  most private hive servers however reset their persistence daily to reduce lag . 
  [ not a one shot ? 
  sure . ], 
  ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orutacrmuey&amp;t=4m32s ), 
  [ it is a one-shot to the chest . 
  no matter how much protection . ], 
  ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orutacrmuey&amp;t=4m32s ), 
  lmao , is that an actual quote ? 
  wow . 
  well , i disagree since i 'm being generic . 
  there 's no need for specificity in this situation since we all know it 's a client-side issue . 
  people frequently use the term lag for any kind of delay of stuttery/slow gameplay . 
   loot spawning on the coast is broken . 
  there is none . 
  i see the devs want you to run inland but there could be at least some basic tools and cans of food . 
  not high-tier stuff . 
  it just forces every freshy to sprint inland asap to avoid starving . 
  this is a very controversial topic . 
  many people like the lack of loot . 
  many hate it . 
  personally , i think that there should be a lack of loot . 
  however , i think there should be a little bit more than there currently is . 
  it is better , but not totally fixed . 
  that 's just what i was thinking since i thought it would be the dynamic lighting until we found out that it appeared to have no effect on the fps drop . 
  yes , i know . 
  i 'm using the term lag in a generic manner . 
  why is everyone so nitpicky about the word lag ? 
  when i encounter people using the word it typically refers to gameplay which is delayed or slowed whether due to network or client-side issues . 
  i have done hours of testing in cars . 
  i know exactly what it is like . 
  i 'm talking about drops specifically caused by firefights . 
  it does n't mean i am wrong to use it .
