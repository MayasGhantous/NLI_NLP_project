  actually , it does slow down a lot . 
  [ there is plenty of drag . ], 
  ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw7pzg8umea&amp;t=4m0s ), 
  sure , that graph does n't include the sp-6 round , but [ the sp-6 round starts off faster than the .45 acp and drops slower than the .45 and longer distances . ], 
  ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw7pzg8umea&amp;t=4m0s ), 
   to say it 's the correct way to use it because someone else is doing it that way is just retarded . 
  to think that that was the only reason i use that term is also retarded . 
  using the velocity stats from the .45 acp , after traveling 300-400m it has slowed by 100m/s . 
  it started at 250m/s and if travelling at 150m/s after 300-400m . 
  in real life , a 9x39mm ( sp-6 ) weighs 16 grams . 
  ** e = 1/2mv ^ 2 **, 
  bullet at 1m : x = 1/2 * x * 0.016 * x * 250 ^ 2 = 500j, 
  ** muzzle energy : ** ** 500j **, 
  bullet at 400m : x = 1/2 * x * 0.016 * x * 150 ^ 2 = 180j, 
  ** energy at 400m : ** ** 180j **, 
  so just because the bullet only slowed down by 100m/s it actually lost 64 % of its energy . 
  so to say * `` bullet does n't slow down much at all , so it keeps its damage . 
  '' * is simply not true . 
  yep . 
  the only way to stop it is to restart the game ( not just log out ) intermittently to get high fps again . 
  yep . 
  we will try it next !, 
   in dayz damage scales linear with velocity , energy does n't enter the picture . 
  either way , the damage at 400m is still just 60 % of what it is at point blank . 
  that 's a huge difference . 
  velocity is the best explanation for why people perceive the round as not one-shotting players to the chest . 
  do you have a better explanation ? 
   also note that agathor 's chart is , understandably , not perfectly accurate . 
  we ca n't be accurate unless someone pulls all of the details out of the game files . 
  i used to play on a macbook pro 13 inch 2014 with i7 upgrade and 8gb ram . 
  i get about 30-50 fps . 
  ( i used bootcamp and windows 10 ), 
  there is no way that you could run dayz natively on macosx even if you could install it . 
  macosx is horribly inefficient at gaming . 
   my guess for complaints :, 
   - hitting arms or weapons etc, 
   - general dayz quirkiness, 
  this is not a good explanation since these things affect all bullets and guns equally . 
  ( except the shotgun ), 
   not 60 % , does n't lose that much velocity at that range . 
  based on what ? 
  based on wobos graph it * is approximately * going at just 60 % of the muzzle velocity at 400m . 
  you are yet to show me what you 're basing this on . 
   also : sp-6 is not included in wobo 's graph , so ... 60 % ? 
  i assumed you were talking of sp-6 there . 
  no , he says it is similar to the .45 but starts at a higher velocity but has a sharper drop-off and becomes the slowest round after a few hundred metres . 
  so for approximate calculations , you can assume that it is fairly similar , but slower than .45 at 400m . 
  what do you think its velocity would be at 400m ? 
  sounds just like me . 
  the drop is less noticeable . 
  in our [ pre-fix test ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/5sm0op/experimenting_with_the_lag_when_shooting_bug/ ) the frame rate dropped to just 30 fps . 
  if we were in a city , then the drop would have made the firefight unplayable . 
  [ it finally makes sense now . ], 
  ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erxn6acvcoe&amp;t=2m5s ), 
  the time is 5 seconds under ideal server conditions . 
  ( it can be as low as 3 seconds if the grenade is damaged ) however , when the server is strained it can be as high as 10 seconds . 
  yep . 
  it sure can . 
  i used to play it on my 13 inch 2014 model !, 
  30-50 fps with new renderer . 
  even better if yours is a 15 inch since 13 inch has integrated graphics whereas the 15 inch has it 's own gpu . 
  about 3 hours ago . 
  pipsi.net private hive . 
  it 's the western-most car at kamenka military base . 
  dude ... 
  i 'm at a military base . 
  he had an akm and his friend had one too . 
  there is no way he would have let me live if i tried to talk to him . 
  especially when i have an svd !, 
  i will tie someone up and let them live when i ko them and it 's safe to . 
  if i 'm semi geared within a few km of the coast , i will talk to a player i meet who has similar gear to me . 
  but doing anything other than killing on sight in that situation would have resulted in my death and the loss of my first svd in 100 hours of 0.61 . 
  from the looks of it , it is grozovoy pass . 
  just north of tisy town and east of tisy military base . 
  how can you count kamenka military as `` coastal faggotry ? '' . 
  most players are geared by the time you get there and i had just run down from myshkino with the hopes of finding some mosin ammo in one of the cars . 
  clearly you do n't understand the map well enough . 
  it 's the pic facing uphill , you can tell because the road splits around the group of trees ahead . 
  kamenka military is not a coastal city like the others . 
  most players are geared by the time you get there and i had just run down from myshkino with the hopes of finding some mosin ammo in one of the cars . 
  clearly , you do n't understand the map well enough . 
  i had just spawned in , so i was zeroed to the default 200m . 
  yeah . 
  because there are no populated 1pp australian private hives . 
  i just went over the full footage where i looted his body . 
  it was a chest shot . 
  his vest and jacket was ruined and his helmet was pristine . 
  i thought it was a headshot at the time though . 
  i figured i left the zeroing too high and i hit him in the head , but i did n't . 
  / r/unexpected, 
  why is fuck there on a post with such a sweet nature ? 
  there are some pretty shitty comments . 
  but there are also more subtle ones which get downvoted because the commenters know that childhood obesity is a slippery slope with most of the responsibility on the parents . 
  ( with the exception of potential medical issues ) i think a lot of people here legitimately care about the weight of the kids but get downvoted because others think they 're just bullying . 
  it 's a sensitive subject to many but an important one nonetheless . 
  well actually , it is both . 
  base metabolic rate can vary up to 30 % across different races and genders . 
  this is measuring energy usage per kg so height and weight have little to do with these results . 
  however , you 're also right that for many , their issue is their diet . 
   no single value for rmr is appropriate for all adults .
