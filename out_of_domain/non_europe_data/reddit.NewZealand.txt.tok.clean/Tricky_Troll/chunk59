  adhering to the nearly universally accepted met convention may lead to the overestimation of the rmr of approximately 10 % for men and almost 15 % for women and be as high as 20 % -30 % for some demographic and anthropometric combinations .

  there are some pretty shitty comments . 
  but there are also more subtle ones which get downvoted because the commenters know that childhood obesity is a slippery slope with most of the responsibility on the parents . 
  ( with the exception of potential medical issues ) i think a lot of people here legitimately care about the weight of the kids but get downvoted because others think they 're just bullying . 
  it 's a sensitive subject to many but an important one nonetheless . 
  i just logged in having come down from tisy and myshkino the previous day . 
  i was going to loot the base and cars for some 7.62 x54mmr ( since i only had 10 rounds for the svd ) before heading to pavlovo military . 
  if you really need it , i can send you the full footage . 
  besides , why would i be running if i was `` camping '' ? 
  also , why are you calling me a `` 3p animal '' . 
  you find me a populated australian 1pp server and i 'll play on it . 
  until then , i 'm sticking to my own region 's only populated server to reduce network issues . 
  it baffles me why this post has triggered you so much . 
  ** edit : ** oh , and just so you know , @ stands for `` at '' . 
  not `` and '' . 
  yes . 
  a player with a gun is a player with a gun . 
  take for example quite possibly the most common weapon to get when looting west to kamenka . 
  a shotgun . 
  a shotgun is more effective than an svd at ranges within the base . 
  i had to go in the base to kill his friend . 
  they both had akms . 
  i was out gunned for the range involved in my encounter with the second player inside the base . 
  so your point is somewhat invalid . 
  besides , for them , the risk would pay off if they kill me because they 'd be rewarded with an svd . 
  it 's much easier to get an svd by killing a guy than by finding it . 
  thanks !, 
  yeah , and i 'm looking forward to see the changes they 're going to make . 
  glad you enjoyed the video !, 
  thanks for the feedback !, 
  i went to pavlovo , zeleno then sosnovka before logging off . 
  instructions unclear . 
  purchased furry kit10 . 
  same here . 
  like op said : sometimes * i * wonder if i 'm playing the same game as the rest of you . 
  most of this comment section makes me feel like we 're all playing different versions . 
  the above comments suggest otherwise ...

  you 're not going to get a serious answer here .

   crumbling liberal ideologies, 
  liberalism is still on a long term trend of growth . 
  meanwhile conservatism has been slowly falling in the last 30 years . 
  but since you spend your whole life in echo-chambers such as rt_d you do n't see statistics for what they are and just pass it off as `` fake news '' . 
  your safe space wo n't shelter you from the truth forever though . 
  is there anything which stands out from your time as a simpsons writer and producer as being particularly memorable ? 
  my personal favourite would be homer goes to college . 
  for those who do n't know , i threw a limpet charge . 
  it sticks to anything it touches and detonates 3-4 seconds after you throw it , meaning i stuck it to the enemy plane and it destroyed the plane . 
  if you think it looked like the charge missed , that 's because it did appear to miss . 
  it is likely due to desync/lag between me and the server . 
  i assume that my pc had already shown the path the limpet charge would have taken assuming it hit nothing before the server said that it hit , and stuck to the plane . 
  so , for the record , for every time you appear to miss the target and get a kill , there is a time when you do n't get a kill for an explosive which appeared to hit the target . 
  [ this video shows a miss which should 've hit and a miss which hit . ], 
  ( https://gfycat.com/nearblankcardinal ) ^ ( the title/caption is there because that clips was cut from a youtube video i made ), 
  if anyone was wondering why my weapon was flinging everywhere , it 's just the animation which plays when you pull your gun out . 
  it was triggering repeatedly because my plane was pitched too steep downwards , so i was falling off and landing back on the plane over and over again . 
  usually , i would n't pitch the plane so steeply because then the animations work properly like [ this . ],

  i will do !, 
  thanks !, 
  well , it 's a lot like the rendezook in bf4 in a way that you have to activate a mechanic which allows you to wingride or `` rodeo '' your plane . 
  in bf1 you have to activate inherited velocity mechanic whereas for the rendezook in bf4 , you had to activate the `` super ejector . '', 
  ( where you get ejected much higher than usual ) to activate the mechanic ( in both games ) all you have to do is get out of the plane and get back in it . 
  the easiest way to do this in bf1 is to land the plane in the base and get out then back in the plane . 
  ( this is when you can switch classes if you need a particular gadget or weapon for a stunt . 
  i made a [ tutorial ] ( https://youtu.be/ozvop7vdao8 ) on it .
