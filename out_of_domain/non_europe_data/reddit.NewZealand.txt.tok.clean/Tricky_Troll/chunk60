  it is n't a great video since i did n't do commentary , but it tells you everything you need to know . 
  the success rate of these stunts is as follows :, 
  ** chance of riding the plane and not falling off ** ~ * 60-70 % on pc * or about * 30-40 % on ps4 * ( likely due to server tick rate ), 
  ** chance of destroying the plane behind you with your weapon ** ( eg dynamite , at grenades or limpet charge ) is probably * about 1-2 % . 
  in bf1 , it 's much harder than using something like a smaw in bf4 since the explosives you use in bf1 are all thrown and are hard to predict their trajectory unlike the straight and fast trajectory of the smaw in bf4 . 
  he was more impressed than anything . 
  [ chat reaction ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auibbnzyors&amp;t=0m36s ), 
  well , it 's a lot like the rendezook in bf4 in a way that you have to activate a mechanic which allows you to wingride or `` rodeo '' your plane . 
  in bf1 you have to activate inherited velocity mechanic whereas for the rendezook in bf4 , you had to activate the `` super ejector . '', 
  ( where you get ejected much higher than usual ) to activate the mechanic ( in both games ) all you have to do is get out of the plane and get back in it . 
  the easiest way to do this in bf1 is to land the plane in the base and get out then back in the plane . 
  ( this is when you can switch classes if you need a particular gadget or weapon for a stunt . 
  i made a [ tutorial ] ( https://youtu.be/ozvop7vdao8 ) on it . 
  it is n't a great video since i did n't do commentary , but it tells you everything you need to know . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** you have to activate the inheriting velocity mechanic by getting out of the plane and back in . 
  yet another prompt where the prompt says too much . 
  why could n't you just leave the last sentence out of the prompt ? 
   this writing prompt makes an impression of a person who takes religion light-heartedly . 
  is there anything wrong with that ? 
  i remember disliking the transition myself , but it was definitely a change for the better . 
  why ? 
  because the whole purpose of the change was to reduce the effectiveness of 3rd person peeking over fences , particularly the concrete walls in military compounds . 
  with the new camera , you could only just see over the top , when you used to be able to see over the wall with about half of your screen . 
  sure , you can still 3rd person peek , but nowhere near as effectively as it was with the old camera . 
  so i highly doubt that you will get the old camera back . 
   i am using shadowplay at the moment . 
  yes , we can tell because of the gamma bug . 
  try using obs if you want the recording to have the same colour profile as what you see on your screen in game . 
  a large proportion of food you buy you do n't eat because it goes off before you finish it . 
  not to mention that most of the atoms you ingest are absorbed and not just passing through your system and coming out the rear end . 
  and the best kind of patriot in a democracy is one who exercises free speech and criticises their own leader . 
  not one who only praises their leader like a god .

   redditor for 8 months, 
  it 's legit !, 
  that 's my bot 's info you 're talking about . 
  ** how dare you !, 
  op of the linked video here . 
  that one in particular , i got after about 2-3 days of attempting , so maybe 5 hours of gameplay attempting it . 
  however , it is n't unusual for things like [ this ] ( https://gfycat.com/helpfulunacceptableemperorpenguin ) to take me a few weeks and up to 100 attempts . 
  thanks for the tag !, 
  do n't forget ocean acidification . 
  thanks !, 
  i use final cut pro x on my macbook . 
  it 's probably not the best editing software , but it i got a free copy so that 's why i use it . 
  it works really well and you can download extra effects such as those floating 3d titles . 
  i do enjoy editing quite a lot . 
  i 'm currently at university studying for a degree which is totally irrelevant to editing , but i 'd love to be able to edit videos as a part time job or anything really which is more experience outside of youtube . 
  where is a good place to look for more experience and get into editing more seriously ? 
  i 've never really thought about taking editing further , but now you mention it , i think i 'd really like it . 
  thanks so much for the info !, 
  saved the comment as i 'll look into things like that when i 'm not so busy with uni . 
  as a youtuber who 's been going for a few years , i know that i 'm happy to edit for the enjoyment rather than the money !, 
  aww , they were gon na show a close up of the rod ... 
  ^ ( ( * my favourite episode as i 'm sure you can tell by my flair * ) ^ ), 
  thanks again !, 
  i 'll likely come back for any questions !, 
  this is one of my favourite things about reddit . 
  there 's someone from every occupation and background willing to give advice or share their story . 
  yes !, 
  the two sweetest words in the english language !, 
  ** de-fault de-fault de-fault !, 
  probably which ever * pays him * the most . 
  i never understood this joke . 
  am i missing something here ? 
  sure !, 
  you 've never been ? 
  hmm , that 's what i thought unless there was an additional layer to it . 
  well explained though . 
  yes . 
  only `` lefties '' and no other political alignment or group of people whatsoever . 
  flair checks out . 
  i can totally relate . 
  i was blown away when i first moved to ps4 . 
  what struck me the most was little things like the sparks flying off the ground where you shoot miniguns alongside the almost constant 60fps . 
  trust me , after only a week , you 'll never be able to go back . 
  nah , if it was aussie , he would have a beer in his hand .

  i still do n't know if spawning in before everything has loaded is a good thing or a bad thing . 
  one one hand you get funny animations for a bit but on the other hand you usually get killed by a floating gun . 
  [ we did it ! ],

  it 's getting destroyed and fixed constantly , so you just need to time it right if you want to see it . 
  most of the time it was just a rainbow to be fair . 
  nice !, 
  although the 5th star in the cross is a little out of the way , but it still looks great !, 
  you were all stupid enough to put your dumb frog in the path of the almighty kiwi . 
  not much longer until you all go to sleep and we rebuild the kiwi on top of that thing ( i legitimately ca n't work out what you have put there ) . 
  enjoy your stupid thing while it lasts . 
  the more downvotes this gets , the faster the kiwi will rise again !, 
  apology accepted .
