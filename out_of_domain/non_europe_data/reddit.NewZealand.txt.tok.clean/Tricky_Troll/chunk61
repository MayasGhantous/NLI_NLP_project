  very nice !, 
  i 'm glad coldplay could make an appearance !, 
  it is definitely much better . 
  it 's not complete since they are yet to change the engine it runs on , but they added a new audio system , a new renderer , there have been huge map changes and most game-breaking glitches are gone . 
  if you already own the game , it 's definitely worth another go . 
  just be warned though , you need to head northwest if you want to find enough food to survive . 
  / r/dayz has plenty of tips since there is more of an emphasis on survival in the current patch . 
  the real snek sub is / r/sneks . 
  / r/safetymanuals, 
  this sub needs some love !, 
  i 'd like to enter . 
  good luck to you all !, 
  i 'm sure that if ops partner got petty revenge back for this and posted it , since you read their perspective of the story , you would think that op is a dbag . 
  these posts are ruining this sub . 
  ^ ^ not ^ ^ that ^ ^ there ^ ^ was ^ ^ anything ^ ^ to ^ ^ ruin ^ ^ in ^ ^ the ^ ^ first ^ ^ place . 
  yeah , that 's really cool until it goes on a killing rampage . 
  enjoy the long detours on back roads to get there . 
  recent earthquakes and storms have caused slips to fall on both coastal roads in and out . 
  i was there a few months back , it 's a real shame because it is a really nice place . 
  north zealand ? 
  as far as i 'm concerned , it 's as perfect as we can get on this planet . 
  wine is nzs largest horticultural crop and sauv blanc makes up two-thirds of the wine produced in nz . 
  yep . 
  the only thing i really worry about in the bigger picture here is an earthquake or volcanic eruption . 
  oh , well i went to kaikoura for a week in january and detours and blockages were ever present . 
  i live here . 
  for anyone wondering , the m320 deals 50 damage to both jets and attack/scout helicopters . 
  so i hit the enemy jet with 2 passive radar missiles ( yes , i know , i 'm sorry for using passives but they are the most effective way to deal more than 50 damage without killing the enemy ) to take him down to 22 health so that i could finish him off with the m320 .

  thanks a lot !, 
  [ i have done it before against infantry ... ] ( https://youtu.be/4nxdqxdz9eq ), 
  a regular grenade simply does n't do enough damage to a jet . 
  but i have done that in bf1 . 
  well , i kinda did that ... https://gfycat.com/freefirstjanenschia, 
  goodbye . 
  i would consider that to be impossible since the grenade does ~ 10 damage to a jet . 
  so the enemy jet would basically have to be disabled , and what pilot does n't bail when their jet is disabled ? 
  sadly , i do n't think it 's going to happen . 
  not really , first off , how do i get the c4 on the jet ? 
  more importantly , c4 only does 80 damage to jets now . 
  i 've been on that for the last half hour , but this is my first psbattle and my ps experience is limited to yt thumbnails ... 
  [ i tried . ], 
  edit : i welcome anyone to out-do me . 
  it wo n't be hard . 
  edit 2 : hmm , maybe i 'm too hard on myself . 
  [ i 'm not an experienced psbattler but i tried ... ] ( http://imgur.com/fkugl2n ), 
  same here , but it was n't there ... 
  so i figured i 'd do my first psbattle submission !, 
  i had never tried anything like it before and my ps ( more accurately gimp ) experience was limited to youtube thumbnails but i 'm glad i did it !, 
   a karmawhoring publication, 
  gold !, 
  i love the tiny details and the colour tints on the pig 's face !, 
  very nice !, 
  edit : i noticed that the final product in the gif is ever so slightly different than the final post . 
  [ do n't . 
  ask . 
  why . ], 
  what in the ... 
  [ dropped his glasses . 
  [ he took a dive ! ], 
  but why ? 
  they 're just useless points ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  i do n't understand how you can get satisfaction from karma unless it is oc . 
  but then who would buy the account and why ? 
  i think it 's been banned from some subs . 
  i have been summoned . 
  yeah , stuff like that but with [ bows and arrows ] ( http://www.gfycat.com/wealthyenormouscanadagoose ) , [ sniper rifles ] ( https://gfycat.com/meagerimpassionedarcticwolf ) and [ more sniper rifles ] ( https://gfycat.com/ethicalidenticalbeetle ), 
  thanks for an opportunity for shameless self-promotion !, 
  that 's my [ video ! ], 
  ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl_9ymqmzom ) :d, 
  ^ ^ but ^ ^ there ^ ^ were ^ ^ only ^ ^ 3 ^ ^ enemies ^ ^ :p, 
  edit : also , it looks like i float down horizontally but the truth is i 'm falling approximately 1 metre for every horizontal metre . 
  it just looks like i 'm travelling horizontally because all you can see is the plane and relative to the plane i 'm getting closer . 
  the time to kill in bf1 is longer than bf4 though ... 
  well , i 'm glad you did n't delete it !, 
  interesting point about calling the original gif mediocre . 
  it is and it is n't . 
  it is because rendezooks like that have been done before literally 1000 's of times before and even with things like [ sniper rifles ] ( https://gfycat.com/ethicalidenticalbeetle ) and [ bows ] ( http://www.gfycat.com/wealthyenormouscanadagoose ) etc. 
  i 've done it with basically every weapon which can 1 or 2 shot kill players ( i spent way too much time doing this stuff ) . 
  however , it 's a misconception that it 's easy to do . 
  it 's like learning to ride a bike in a way that getting back in the jet is hard to start off , it can take weeks to do correctly multiple times . 
  ( it took me 3 weeks to do what op did in the gif for the first time ) . 
  but once you get used to it , it is repeatable to the point where you can realistically do it every game if you devote yourself to it . 
  so while it has been done 1000s of times , even a seasoned bf veteran who has n't done it before would need days if not weeks to learn it and make it a repeatable trick . 
  the time it takes to kill someone . 
  simply put as : shots to kill x time between shots ( rate of fire cap ) x ( 1 \u00f7 proportion of bullets hitting the target ) ( caused by bullet spread ), 
  eg : 7 shots x 0.2 seconds between shots x ( 1 \u00f7 0.5 ) ( 50 % of bullets miss due to random bullet spread ) = 2.8 seconds . 
  the number of shots to kill in bf1 is similar to bf4 , but the rate of fire is much lower , so the time between shots is greater . 
  also , the random bullet spread is greater , so the total time to kill is greater on average . 
  ah man , that reminds me . 
  a few months back i got a pc and i 've been flying with m+kb when for the last 3 years i have been using a controller . 
  it was like being new to flying all over again !, 
  i can totally relate !, 
  what are you talking about ? 
  ** dmrs/self-loading rifles in bf4/bf1 : **, 
  bf4 : all dmrs 3 shot kill at long distance except for the sks which is a 4 shot if you hit the legs multiple times . 
  bf1 : mondragon , selbstlader 1916 and rsc are 3 shots at long range . 
  others are all 4 and 5 shot kills at long range .
