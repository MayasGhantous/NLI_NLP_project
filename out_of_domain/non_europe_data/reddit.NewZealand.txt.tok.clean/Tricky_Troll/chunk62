  ** smgs in bf4 vs bf1 : **, 
  bf4 : 7 shots to kill with the as val to a 8 shot kill with the p90 . 
  bf1 : 7 bullets to kill with the ribeyrolles to 9 bullets to kill with the automatico . 
  ** lmgs in bf4 and bf1 : **, 
  bf4 : 5 bullets with the m60e4 to 6 with the m249 . 
  bf1 : 5 bullets with the chauchat to 6 with the lewis gun . 
  so as you can see , they * are * almost identical except in bf1 , most slrs take an extra bullet , which is what i was getting at with the longer ttk in bf1 . 
  do n't know what you 're on about , but i appreciate the reference . 
  i think he 's talking about there being another anti-trump sub , so he 's complaining indirectly in the form of a joke . 
  i think both sides of politics on reddit are guilty of bot use . 
  best to just avoid both sides all together . 
  lmao . 
  but seriously , why would you guild a bot ? 
  me too :(, 
  was it also a military tent though ? 
  that could explain why then . 
  the link you provided is as follows : https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=u&amp;video_id=cldnc2qptmc, 
  you 've taken it from your videos page and so it has an edit reference in the name . 
  so it takes me to the edit page for * my * videos because i ca n't edit your video , so it sends me to the next closest thing . 
  you 're going to have to get the link another way . 
   30fps, 
  i get more fps on average in dayz than i do on a aaa game like battlefield 1 , so that statement is either a flat out lie or due to your slow pc making it misleading as you have n't given us a typical frame rate on other games with your pc . 
  sure , the frame rate in dayz is more variable , but on average it is higher than bf1 . 
   did the playability improve ? 
  it has a lot . 
  it is still buggy which is to be expected before they implement the new enfusion engine . 
  but by no means has the playability `` not really '' improved . 
   rubberbanding, 
  i have n't personally experienced any notable rubberbanding since 0.59 , so i do n't know what sort of connection you have , but you should try to play on low ping servers where possible . 
  dayz is definitely not stable yet , but your comment is horribly biased and misleading . 
  username checks out . 
  your comment would n't have been misleading if you had stated that you play on a laptop and that you do n't follow the status reports and change logs because if you did you would n't have said what you did about the playability . 
  how can you claim that the game has the playability has `` not really '' improved ? 
  my friend kept the 0.44 version of dayz on his hard drive and downloaded the server client for 0.44 from elsewhere and he set up a private server for us to play on with each other just to see how far the game has come . 
  0.61 is worlds apart from 0.44 and earlier !, 
  better fps , less bugs . 
  no game breaking pvp issues like a pistol in your hands magically getting ruined because got shot in the legs and you were storing it in your pants before you put it in your hands . 
  i understand that people will have different opinions on the game , but you 're saying that they playability has not really improved yet you claim to have been following the game and dev logs since the mod ... something simply is n't right here . 
   its because bi has dumb retarded owners with narrow vision and conviction that they know better every fucking time, 
  this is why i ca n't take you seriously . 
  the bias on this is unreal . 
  if you were saying that based on fact , you would n't throw insults at the devs . 
  you 'd be pointing out why they are what you think they are . 
   i have no respect for this shit company after what they did with dayz . 
  how exactly can you judge it if the game is n't finished ? 
  they 're building a whole new engine !, 
  so do n't give the old `` it 's been three years '' excuse as the time it has taken is totally justified based on the size of the task at hand . 
   average playtime is around 8 minutes man ... numbers speak the truth . 
  number show a trend but do n't explain what causes that trend . 
  have you looked at the average play time for other games with :, 
  \u2022 the same complexity, 
  \u2022 games in the same genre, 
  just like the fps stat you gave me for you computer , it is useless out of context . 
  so without context , numbers do n't always speak the truth . 
  even my macbook pro 13 inch 2014 got 30-55 fps on low 900p . 
  it had integrated graphics !, 
  i 've been thinking about doing an experiment with some leftover ghillie suits i hoarded throughout 0.61 where i see how many players will run past me if i lay by the roadside or by a house . 
  the video would probably be about 5 minutes long with a similar editing style to this to keep it interesting but with a much more cinematic feel . 
  * please tell me if any of you think that 's something i should do * and you think you 'd find it interesting to watch !, 
  it would take quite an investment of my time and i 'm not sure if there 's enough of an audience to watch it , so any feedback would be great !, 
  i was busy for a couple of months and cut down video production to my main channel , leaving this one as it is until i had the time to keep it going . 
  i never got around to posting it but now i want to ( and have the time to ) make more episodes and maybe some `` social experiments '' in dayz . 
  so i posted this now basically to get some feedback from the people who watched it and see if anyone thinks that the ghillie experiment idea i had would be something they 'd watch . 
  also , thanks !, 
  hmmm . 
  well , i 'm kind of split on that one as i can take it in two different directions . 
  i can edit it and make it funny which is something i do a lot on my other channel . 
  or i could make it serious and cinematic with ( as close as i can get ) to a really professional production quality and just make a slightly shorter out-takes video which i can upload a couple of days later which is edited to make it more entertaining and funny . 
  i 'm sure i will get player reactions/encounters which suit both styles of video , so i 'm leaning towards making two separate videos . 
  but that 's why i posted this . 
  to get feedback and recommendations . 
  what do you think i should do ? 
  sweet as !, 
  i think that 's what i 'll do . 
  i came to the conclusion a while back that walkie talkies on the ground do n't work but i ca n't remember what made me think that . 
  hmm , i 'll test it and if it works then it 's a good idea !, 
  also , i have a couple of * really * great ideas , but they involve notes and notes have n't worked since 0.59 . : , (, 
   dayz which looks like a ten-year-old game graphically . 
  is this a joke ? 
  please tell me this is a joke . 
  i do n't know what you play on or why you thought that statement needed to be such an over-exaggeration , but i just ca n't take you seriously now . 
  100 % the same zombie . 
  it was my third and final run through as the first time i lost the zombie to a server reset in novo and the second one i lost to a tree it got stuck in near factory . 
  i might still have the 1:10 minutes of raw footage on my hard drive if you really want me to slow it down a bit more . 
  yes , but if you watch carefully , it is the same one . 
  i think that / u/bean - is right in saying * `` i think it 's because he dealt damage to the zombie chasing him so it would not stop chasing . 
  the others stopped because he never hit them . 
  arma 2 looks extremely different to dayz standalone , * especially * with the new renderer . 
  even someone who has never played a game before could tell you that if they saw screenshots of both . 
   crysis was released 10 years ago , and is undoubtedly better graphically than dayz . 
  now that is a joke . 
  that seems like it since i could n't work out why the engineering student was holding a blank flag . 
  yeah , but palm oil is horrendously bad for the environment . 
  therefore i 'd consider that worse . 
  op was n't highlighting either issue more than the other . 
  it 's purely up to the way that the viewer interprets it . 
  deforestation is a ** much ** bigger problem than obesity . 
  palm oil plantations are one of the main factors increasing demand for land on ex-rainforest land . 
  deforestation is exacerbating climate change and is not only doing irreversible damage to the local ecosystem , but it has major ramifications worldwide . 
  obesity is much more controllable on a personal and on a social level than deforestation .
