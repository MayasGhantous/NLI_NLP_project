  plus we know much more about it and it 's side effects whereas we do n't actually know many of the side effects which will come from losing such large amounts of biodiversity and releasing more stored carbon back into the atmosphere . 
  do n't get me wrong , obesity is a serious issue and getting facts out about what we eat is a large part on fighting it , but i consider something which threatens the prosperity and even the existence of humans as a species to be much more serious than an issue like obesity which is more controllable and only affects a portion on the human population . 
  economically viable = / = sustainable and environmentally friendly . 
  intrinsic - * adjective *, 
  * belonging to the essential nature or constitution of a thing * / * belonging to a thing by its very nature *, 
  i know what you 're getting at here , but intrinsic was not the right word . 
  well if you used a better term than `` intrinsically '' , like `` nutritionally '' and did n't say `` there 's nothing intrinsically wrong with palm oil , so there 's no use in demonizing it '' then people including myself would understand that . 
  but you can `` demonize '' palm oil based on more than just nutritional value , so you certainly were n't making what you were trying to say clear . 
  so what was the source of the bullet ? 
  [ hold on ! ], 
  i thought so . 
  i thought it was new zealand . 
  the bushes are typical of nz bush and the green sign on the left looks like a doc sign . 
  yep . 
  that was it for me . 
  then some ferns on the right side confirmed my suspicion . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=johmlmq-dru&amp;t=0m39s ), 
  i do n't like this idea at all . 
  i understand that dayz is supposed to be realistic , but i think that it would get very annoying , very fast . 
  i could see it working on hardcore servers , but i do n't play on them often anyway . 
  i agree . 
  does n't that just make it dark brown rather than purple ? 
  i did delete the pond files with the 0.59 map and a bunch of other files which the video tutorial i linked said i needed to remove . 
  it still did n't work . 
  as for bohemia not wanting the files available , i do n't understand this . 
  more access to cinematic shots in the content creator community is good for making the game look good to someone who is thinking about buying it . 
  it 's basically free advertising for them . 
  well the thing is that i do have a copy of the full game on version 0.59 since it was left from my old laptop 's external hard drive as i last used it with 0.59 . 
  basically i have all the files needed and arma 3 recognises it as a mod but when it loads it crashes and shows [ this message ] ( https://i.redd.it/1voeqdbtu22y.png ) but with 0x0000000000fcf6f4 in place of the first code . 
  yeah , i thought that that was the case with the current version of the map but it worked with back when dayz sa was at patch 0.59 so unless arma 3 has changed to not accept the files , it should work with my version of 0.59 files . 
  `` what does she do ? '', 
  `` she 's super spoiled '', 
  *** `` but what does she do ? 
  `` she 's a whore ! '', 
  could you possibly link that workshop ? 
  i 've been browsing them recently and have n't found one which will do . 
  in theory the regular chernarus map will do since i believe that krutoy cap has remained mostly unchanged . 
  people would still dayz , but that 's a very valid point . 
  thanks so much !, 
  ** sigh ** that sucks . 
  i hope they add a cinematic tool by full release then . 
  * `` hi , everybody !, 
  `` ok , i 'll be there in 6 hours ! '', 
  nope , it 's 1-600 . 
  i 'd have thought it was 1-800 , but it 's not . 
  my username is because of my youtube channel . 
  being a troll in battlefield is just killing people in extravagant ways . 
  so the meaning of troll in my name is a lot better than what most people associate the word with . 
  you can trust me !, 
  have n't had the time to play 0.62 yet ( hopefully tonight ! ), 
  but is it more repetitive than 0.61 ? 
  because i think it should at least be less repetitive . 
  i honestly think they 're shit . 
  i ca n't say i think any emojis are amazing , but google 's are undoubtedly the worst in my opinion . 
  yep . 
  same here . 
  i was in a server and just saw about 20 players get kicked in the bottom left in 20 seconds . 
  then i got about 5fps before getting kicked myself . 
  i have been unable to rejoin since . 
  is this in 0.62 ? 
  or is this a photo from a non-official server ? 
  83,000,000 seconds ... in other words , 971 days . 
  and your country funded and catalysed the wars which created the influx of migrants . 
  meanwhile , people who were born into a poor family in your country do n't get access to healthcare because it is too expensive and for * at least * the first 18 years of their life they ca n't do anything about it . 
  but i guess it 's their fault for being born into a poor family , right ? 
  so tell me , how do you feel about a child which is born in the us into a family which is too poor to afford healthcare ? 
  is it that child 's fault for being poor ? 
  first off , i live in new zealand . 
  here health insurance is affordable and all medical bills which are the result of an accident ( be it a car crash or sports injury etc ) is covered by the government . 
  taxes are n't exactly high here and i do n't need to worry if i need to go to the hospital for any reason . 
  secondly , i have no clue what your argument here is . 
  what do you call a `` civilised country '' . 
  finally , your attempted insult by calling me abdul was a horrible failure as even if i did live in the middle east or had middle eastern heritage , i would n't have found that offensive . 
  i 'm not going to circle jerk that joke anymore . 
  0.62 is a big step forward and this game is getting very close to beta now relative to time and patches gone by . 
  0.62 is worlds apart from the early versions . 
  the game is clearly making big steps forwards now . 
  yep , and if not it will be in q1 2018 . 
  0.62 is proof that dayz is making real progress now . 
  so you 're saying that if a family does n't have a multi-thousand dollar emergency medical fund or ca n't afford health insurance then they should n't have kids ? 
  i can guarantee that there will be thousands of ** extremely ** hard working couples in the us who fit this category who probably work harder than many people who can afford healthcare . 
  i do n't see how that 's fair . 
   i did it right, 
  i was lucky enough not to be born into a poor family . 
  ftfy, 
  also just because life is n't fair does n't make it an excuse to stop making it more fair . 
  why let life be unfair if we have the ability to make it more fair for everyone ? 
  and the extra few % of income tax which goes to healthcare is more valuable to a poor family than it is to someone who earns 100k + a year . 
  actually the visual update has had no negative effect on frame rate . 
  go ahead and have your willfully ignorant circle jerk . 
  edit : oh and it runs better than pubg and looks on par if not better than pubg now . 
  it 's because they had to build a new engine which is suitable for the game since no suitable engine for the game exists . 
  in the mean time the have to simeltaneously fix the game on the legacy engine before porting it over to the new engine . 
  how on earth would such a task take anything less than years ? 
  i 'd say it will reach beta anywhere between 4 months absolute minimum to a more likely december or q1 2018 ( beta release ) . 
  as for full release it is hard to say , but sometime before the end of 2018 i imagine . 
  although it 's important to note that beta will feel very different to the game in its current state due to the new engine change being so significant to almost every aspect of the game . 
  nope . 
  dayz was released on to a legacy engine which could n't handle the game ( hence the wildly inaccurate roadmaps because they thought that the legacy engine was good enough for the job ) . 
  shortly after release , the developers realised this and were tasked by bohemia interactive to create a new engine which will be used in future by dayz and for the next arma games .
