  but that way i would n't get any reddit karma and i 'd have nothing to upload to youtube . 
  i 've done half of my bf1 stunts like this on console . 
  however , the reason that you have n't seen it is because nobody does it . 
  i have never seen anyone do it in game and i know of no more that 5 people who have attempted it . 
  those people do n't try it many times before they get bored . 
  i 'm just an exception . 
  bolt action rifle just does n't sound the same . 
  thanks !, 
  i 've got more stunts planned !, 
  thanks !, 
  oh , and there 's an even more frustrating thing about it ... you ca n't repair the plane unless you have the repair tool gadget equipped . 
  so i constantly have to either bail and ptfo until i die or land in the base and switch classes two more times since i ca n't maintain the aircraft as a scout . 
  i do use the tank hunter plane however so that i can fix wing breaks . 
  not quite !, 
  i hit the plane with my rifle ( 10 damage ) , hit it with the light anti-tank grenade ( 80 damage ) and then finished it off with my sniper rifle ( 10 more damage ) . 
  nailed it . 
  although 2 ways have been discovered on how you can get out and back in without landing the plane . 
  as mentioned by another reply already , you have to land the plane ( this is when you 'd usually switch classes ) and then angle your plane just right when you want to get out . 
  i made a [ tutorial ] ( https://youtu.be/ozvop7vdao8 ) on it . 
  it 's not a very good video , but it tells you everything you need to know . 
  a few things have changed since i made that video , but i ca n't annotate them all now that youtube discontinued annotations !, 
  i 've been on reddit for a while now !, 
  [ i did . ], 
  ( https://youtu.be/ozvop7vdao8 ), 
  it is a little bit out of date as a few things have changed and i ca n't annotate them all ever since youtube disabled annotations . 
  the video is n't very good , but it tells you everything you need to know . 
  yep !, 
  i 've been doing stunts in bf4 and bf1 for the last 2 and a half years now , so there has been plenty of practice !, 
  wow . 
  there 's actually a lot more to rendezooking than most people think . 
  getting back in the jet is actually really hard and it 's something which you get better at with practice to the point that you can repeat it with over a 90 % success rate . 
  also , an experienced rendezooker will be able to line up his jet so that he passes really close to his target as you begin to learn the trajectory which you 're ejected at . 
  it took me 3 weeks to pull off my first one but now i could do it most games and i 've done it with almost every weapon in the game which has the ability to one shot kill an infantry player . 
  there is a lot of knowledge about it which makes it much easier too , like the right angle of your plane to eject at . 
  such as tilting your left wing down slightly so that you do n't get ejected off to the side . 
  oh man , i wish i did it for a living !, 
  my 200ish videos has earned me a couple hundred bucks and a free copy of bf1 . 
  thanks !, 
  that means a lot !, 
  i often wanted to see outtakes and know the ins and outs of the stunts which people like ponylionhd did ( the guy who did these sort of stunts before me , he stopped making videos right after i started ) . 
  definitely . 
  i love getting feedback and questions about the stunts and how to do them !, 
  it sounds like you 're ejecting at the wrong angle then . 
  even a small angle change of the jet can change it by many metres . 
  i made a [ tutorial ] ( https://youtu.be/_pzrineti0o ) on it . 
  it 's not a very good video , but it tells you everything you need to know . 
  i play on pc and ps4 . 
  i assume you 're on xbox based on the space in your name . 
  is that right ? 
  i think this is a repost of a repost of a repost or something like that . 
  thanks op . 
  literally * nobody * gave a fuck ... 
  i wo n't miss you . 
  i do !, 
   www.youtube.com/c/trickytrollgaming, 
  i 'm glad to hear that you like them !, 
  i 'd say i have about another year 's worth of ideas to pull off before the next bf ! . 
  ** cult leaders : ** `` the leader is good , the leader is great !, 
  we surrender our will , as of this date ! '', 
  ** homer : ** * uninterested *, 
  ** cult leaders : ** `` nananananananana leader ! '', 
  ** homer : ** `` nananananananana batman !, 
  i mean ... 
  leader ! '', 
  ... or you could just smash it with a hammer . 
  how about those companies do some lobbying . 
  that 's the only way it will happen . 
  lmao, 
  woah , i literally just found this a few hours ago ... 
  can someone explain what was so funny about that askreddit thread ? 
  i 've gone through it multiple times but i fail to see what is so funny or interesting about it . 
  pfft . 
  sources on reddit ? 
  do n't you know that one user 's anecdotal evidence is the best evidence there is ? 
  `` say , moe ... was it a duck ? '', 
  i just had windows defender flag a trojan after i left my pc mining overnight . 
  my gpu works fine for gaming still but it refuses to mine . 
  so it probably was n't a virus ? 
  but just nicehash ? 
  lmao , that 's a relief !, 
  i just restored the quarrantined file and it 's working fine again . 
  thanks !, 
  i could n't have put it better myself . 
  thanks ouija , your wise words were just what i needed !, 
  no , i do n't use anything other than windows defender . 
  but everyone you have ever loved is dead . 
  that 's one of the common sad statements made by centenarians . 
  it 's really not a simple as that when you 're 100 years old . 
  depends on the magic at work . 
  thank you . 
  i came here to ask just this !, 
  lmao, 
  special thanks to a friendly player name `` gary '' i met nearby after i destroyed the tyres with the last jump in the gif . 
  we met a few hundred metres away from the crash and after exploring the new area . 
  ( would recommend to anyone who has n't yet , it is just north of the lopatino evacuation military camp ! ), 
  we made it our mission to fix up the car and jump it together . 
  meeting a friendly player so far north while having a car fixing and jumping mission to complete was the most fun i 've had in dayz for a while !, 
  half an hour later we jumped the right ramp successfully !, 
  ( as shown in the second jump clip in the gif ), 
  thanks for being friendly and thanks for a great night !,
