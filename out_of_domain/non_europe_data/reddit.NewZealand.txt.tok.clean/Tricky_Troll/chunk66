  just north of the west lopatino evacuation camp , southwest of tisy military and west of sinistok . 
  maybe even bicycles if you 're brave enough !, 
  that 's a shame !, 
  well i actually cheated and drove from turovo to the jumps by driving in the debug . 
  ( sorry , but it was in the name of science !, 
  thanks !, 
  i 'll be doing some more throughout experimental and making them into youtube videos like i did in 0.61 . 
  i 've also got some 0.61 experiment footage which i should also probably share . 
  along with an experiment where i lay on the roadside in a ghillie to see how many players will see me and how many will run past . 
  shit , i have a lot of work to do . 
  nah , i was playing with my friend then he had to get off , so i respawned and ran to turovo and hopped servers to find an offroader . 
  when i found it i drove in the debug to get there . 
  i would n't normally enter the debug or server hop , but this was for science , so i figured it was ok . :p, 
  yes , but it took me 30 minutes to go from 60 fps to 30 . 
  you just have to restart your game . 
  sounds good to me !, 
  0.30 without any of the bugs !, 
  what do you mean ? 
  this is just a small feature on the map to add to the immersion and realism . 
  that 's a pretty accurate description . 
  i do n't understand how people can say the game has made no progress . 
  lmao . 
  i think that those people are just wilfully ignorant of the progress of things they do n't like . 
  are you kidding me ? 
  with default gamma , a literally ca n't see anything . 
  ** i am not exaggerating . 
  ** sure , i could use flashlights etc , but do you know how long it takes for the battery to run out ? 
  a mere 30 minutes ( which i think needs addressing ) . 
  i 'm all for an immersive experience sometimes , but * enforcing * everyone to play with low gamma is not the answer . 
  i would actively avoid nighttime servers if gamma was locked as i do n't find it fun to look at a pitch black screen for 2 hours . 
  deaths would be extremely frustrating if you even come across players at all . 
  or you could grab a flare or a chem light and tell all the other players where you are which will again lead to frustrating deaths . 
  the only solution , in my opinion , is to make it a server option so that hardcore servers like dayz underground or rp servers can lock your gamma near the default level . 
  this way we do n't have to stare at a pitch black screen half of the time if we do n't want to . 
  i can really see the attraction of having to use chem lights etc , however , i do not want this on softcore pvp oriented servers . 
  so by limiting it to hardcore community servers then people can play like this as they wish without getting shot by high gamma users and without scaring away the majority of the player base who want a fun experience over a hyper-realistic one . 
  having all servers with locked gamma would push many people away from this game . 
  primarily stary/novy sobor , nwaf and berezino . 
  you 'll be able to run it just fine with that !, 
  i would n't say dayz will `` probably never '' make it to ps4 . 
  it will definitely be a long time and the graphics wo n't be fancy , but the devs said they wanted to get it on console eventually . 
  as for the retards who will say `` ha !, 
  a potatostation 4 will never run dayz hurrrdurrrr ! '' . 
  it will . 
  if i can play bf4 at 60 fps on ps4 and my macbook pro which i used to play on could play bf4 at 30fps on low but could run dayz at 900p low settings 35-55fps , then a ps4 can almost certainly get 60fps on low settings using either 900p or 720p . 
  sure , it 's not 1080p but i still play bf4 on ps4 after i got my 1080p 60fps on high gaming pc in december . 
  i barely notice a difference as i 'm playing the ps4 on a tv which is further away . 
  if i was on a monitor , i would totally notice a difference , but most ps4 players use a tv . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** dayz will likely hit console as the devs expressed interest in it . 
  it will just be many more years before it arrives . 
  and for the wilfully ignorant pc elitists , dayz * will almost certainly * run on ps4 . 
  and tell all the other players where i am ? 
  no thanks . 
  i 'll stick to a more even pvp playing field . 
  it 's much more fun . 
  if i want immersion , i 'll play on either a pve/rp server or dayz underground . 
  clearly you did n't read my comment . 
  what a stupid reply . 
   this means nobody should listen to your input on nighttime play . 
  are you saying that if someone is against something , their opinion is invalid ? 
  ** what . 
  the . 
  ** that is literally what you 're saying . 
  wow . 
  first off , how is that any different from what i just said . 
  secondly , and more importantly , i am not against nighttime play . 
  if you actually read my replies , you 'd have found out that i will happily play at nighttime on non-pvp or hardcore servers if everyone 's gamma was locked at normal . 
  ** life pro tip : ** actually read someone 's argument before you reply and make a fool of yourself . 
  my username does not reflect my personality and it 's not an excuse for you to dig yourself out of your hole . 
  tricky , because i do tricks/stunts in battlefield 4 and 1 and troll because in the battlefield community , the term troll is used for someone who kills someone in extravagant and embarrassing ways . 
  nice try , but no cigar . 
  to quote my first reply :, 
   i can really see the attraction of having to use chem lights etc , however , i do not want this on softcore pvp oriented servers . 
  so by limiting it to hardcore community servers then people can play like this as they wish without getting shot by high gamma users and without scaring away the majority of the player base who want a fun experience over a hyper-realistic one . 
  look at my top submissions and that 's all the evidence anyone will ever need as confirmation . 
  so where 's your evidence that i am a troll in the negative sense ? 
  how am i trolling ? 
  i 'm sharing my opinion . 
  that 's not the definition of a troll . 
  you 're just trying to use it as a distraction from the fact that you misread my comment . 
   right after you bitched about not being able to see and the length of battery life then completely ignored how easy it is to make a torch . 
  ** lmao . 
  ** now you 're just proving that you did n't read my comment !, 
  i explained why that leads to bad and frustrating pvp !, 
  hence i do n't think it 's a good idea to have locked gamma in pvp servers , only pve/hardcore . 
  i feel bad for you , not being able to understand someone else 's point of view !, 
   bye bye little bridge dweller . 
  repeating the same attempted insults/arguments over and over in spite of the fact that the argument has been refuted is a pretty strong sign of being wrong . 
  repeating the same thing over does n't make it true . 
  that 's just childish lmao . 
  i already explained why `` craft a torch '' is n't a good solution . 
  more proof you did n't read my comments . 
   glitch their gamma, 
  it 's not a glitch . 
  the devs would have addressed it ages ago . 
  and if they did remove the slider , they would lose a large portion of their player base . 
  either way , torches tell other players where you are regardless of whether the other players have high gamma or not .
