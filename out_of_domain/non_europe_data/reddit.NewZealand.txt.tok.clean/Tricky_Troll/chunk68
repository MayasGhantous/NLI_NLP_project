  other than these initial fees , it 's fine . 
  i have easily made this money back by now due to the increasing prices of ether and bitcoin . 
  i would say that this is the best website for any kiwi who is looking to buy bitcoin and ether since sales and purchases are done almost instantly and for a good price relative to the market and other sites . 
  they are also very secure and trustworthy . 
  finally , a movie reference * that i actually get * . 
  oh wow , i would have never thought of that !, 
  great . 
  another horrid abbreviation i need to learn : /, 
  i agree about your comment on the community here . 
  this is my favourite sub for whenever i want to cheer up . 
  a positive community and great music !, 
  ( plus i love the design of the sub !, 
  10/10 , mods ! ), 
  i heard talk , speed of sound and fix you many times on the radio in the car back in 2005 when i was seven . 
  i quite liked it , but being 7 i was n't in a position to buy and listen to it . 
  my parents liked it though and bought the album along with parachutes and a rush . 
  i always enjoyed their music but i never fell in love with their music until mx i assume because i was n't able to appreciate their music fully until i was older . 
  since then the band has just kept growing on me , i swear i enjoy their albums ( particularly the first three ) more and more each year that passes . 
  i also went to see them live back in 2009 but i was again , too young to fully appreciate it , but i went and saw them again back in december and it was one of the best nights of my life . 
  absolutely incredible !, 
  yeah , i realised when i looked at the article , but the title confused me !, 
   do not store your crypto currency ( any ) on a exchange . 
  would you mind explaining why ? 
  i 'd have thought it was fine on independent reserve . 
  scrolled down , was not disappointed . 
  i guess , but independent reserve makes it sound more secure than my paxful wallet ( obviously ir want it to sound secure ) . 
  would you recommend i transfer my coin over to paxful or even another wallet over ir ? 
  right . 
  i 'll take a closer look at the security of all my options . 
  it 's a nice sum of money , but by no means life savings . 
  ( i 'm not that much of a risk taker ! ), 
  thanks !, 
  the sustenance we all need . 
  is it ok if i donate one nz dollar ? 
  that 's about 74 cents . 
  the current dips are just speculation . 
  there is no reason why a few months from now the price will be lower than it is now . 
  from a development point of view , all of the news is good . 
  #hodl !, 
  but why ? 
  do you really think that living forever is n't a curse ? 
  you 'll see everyone you ever care about die , everything you enjoy will wear off and you 'll lose interest in it . 
  there is no way that you would be able to enjoy life for much longer than the first hundred , maybe 200 years at best . 
  even if your physical state never deteriorated , there is no way that you would n't get bored or tired of life . 
  death is scary , but immortality is even scarier if you ask me . 
  but why ? 
  does op of that comment really think that living forever is n't a curse ?

  good , but i do n't think you should lose blood . 
  that 's not realistic . 
  your shock stat should increase . 
  this way you will become unconscious and lighter hits will ko you easier . 
  it also means that you do n't actually lose health though if you do lose consciousness which is much more realistic . 
  treehouse of horror viii, 
  [ now you get it . ], 
  ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3j2pb0ywvh8 ), 
  nah , i got my name from doing tricks/stunts and trolling in battlefield games . 
  the definition of trolling there is basically just killing players in extravagant and humiliating ways . 
  i 'm not a troll by the more widespread meaning of the term . 
  the clip is from a treehouse of horror episode where they usually mess around with the credits . 
  so it is meant to be a joke . 
  that 's a self-jerk . 
  well , i believe that the time period has too large of an effect on the potential game mechanics , meaning that all time periods are n't as viable and so often are n't as successful as a modern shooter . 
  i think that modern shooters strike a balance between a lack of features like in bf1 ( caused by the limited technology of wwi ) and over-saturation which can be found in games like the recent cod games . 
  the recent cod games had things like specialists and exo-suits which removed the enjoyable simplicity of previous cod games . 
  to me this was too much . 
  the game was bloated with features and items and i could n't play it for very long . 
  a modern shooter has lots of variability and different ways you can take it without over-saturating the game with features like a futuristic game . 
  this does not mean that you ca n't have a good futuristic game . 
  it 's just that there is a tendency for futuristic shooters to be bloated with features and historical shooters like bf1 to have issues with lack a of features and bad balance due to limitations set by the time period . 
  really ? 
  then what is the best effective counter to aircraft without using some form of aa cannon ? 
  there were plenty of alternatives in bf4 . 
  not in bf1 , and this is one of the reasons why the vehicle-infantry balance in bf1 is horrible . 
  as a pilot , i can say i have never been shot down by small arms fire alone . 
  there have been occasions where a squad of supports shoot at me , they 're too easy to kill to be a threat . 
  if only i used chrome ... but safari runs better on os x. 
  i love my pc , but every now and then nothing beats chilling on a couch and playing ps4 on a 50 inch tv . 
  me too minus the xbox . 
  they all do their own things best in their own way . 
  ** mac : ** best for general internet browsing , work and video editing . 
  the best software imo . 
  so smooth and fast . 
  ** pc : ** intensive games and a better gaming experience . 
  ** ps4 : ** best laid back gaming experience . 
  couch , controller + 50 inch tv . 
  great combo . 
  i recently switched to pc . 
  it 's awesome . 
  the best gaming experience ... but i still love laying on a couch playing ps4 on a 50 inch tv . 
  they 're both good for different things . 
  i play them both equally . 
  well , as a player of first person shooters , i ca n't get behind the idea of using a controller against a server full of m + kb users . 
  plus , my ps4 is * much * faster at starting up and getting into a game faster . 
  it 's definitely possible , but i find the ps4 more convenient and enjoyable in that situation . 
  i could get behind that idea if i played anything other than fps games . 
  why is that ?
