  *** the dayz haters can be put into two categories : ***, 
  ** there are those that do n't know why dayz has been delayed for so long and they do n't care . 
  as far as they know , dayz has made no major progress in the last 4 years and bash on the devs for being lazy . 
  these are the people who you will find in the comment sections saying things like `` lol , people still play dayz ? '', 
  or basically any comment bashing the devs as being lazy which is incredibly untrue . 
  i think that the dayz devs are some of the most hard working and passionate out there . 
  ** then there are those that know why dayz is taking so long . 
  they know that the devs have been building a new engine and they know that it is a ** huge ** task . 
  but they argue `` why do n't they just hire more employees '' or `` why are they adding more tree textures and useless things like farming equipment when they could be fixing the game ? '', 
  no matter how many times you tell them that a 3d modeler ca n't make a game engine , they wo n't listen . 
  they do n't understand simple ideas such as diminishing marginal product of labour -- that 200 devs are n't twice as fast as 100 . 
  so they think hiring more devs will solve the issue but bi are n't willing to put money into a game which is a failure . 
  as i 've already said , they 're willfully ignorant of the truth because it does n't fit their narrative . 
  they think that because they ca n't see dayz 's progress , it is n't happening . 
  hating on dayz has become a meme . 
  but i look forward to the day where everyone in the gaming community who has an open mind, 
  can revisit dayz and see it as a beautiful , functioning , open world survival game like no other and only the haters who deny the truth can continue to hate on the game . 
  i believe it will happen . 
  the dev team is committed and they have made great progress . 
  look at battlefield 4 . 
  it was an absolute mess when it released . 
  it took 2 , even 3 years for it to be fixed , but once it was , what was previously seen as a failure became a success in the eyes of many . 
  i can see dayz in this position 2 years down the line , especially when modding is a thing . 
  in beta we trust . 
  i 'm beginning to get worried about that !, 
  fake . 
  there was no snow . 
  does your name happen to be bernie ? 
  i used hitbtc . 
  it did the job , and i got what i wanted . 
   how the bitcoin boom triggered a crime spree, 
  it 's not all good exposure though . 
  apocalypse incoming ? 
  `` you 've always looked like a fred to me , so i 'm just going to call you fred . '', 
  `` my name * is * fred ... '', 
  until someone asks you his real name because they only know his nickname ... 
  then next time you should score and write u/whatchettb and `` me '' . 
  wait for him to correct you . 
  i believe zrx is a protocol for making decentralised exchanges and dnt is built off of zrx , but they are otherwise totally different projects . 
  dnt on the other hand is a bunch of decentralised communities and marketplaces ( districts ) built off ethereum smart contracts . 
  the tokens are used to vote which project should be built by the district0x team . 
  i find dnt harder to explain whereas zrx is actually quite simple . 
  i could have something wrong in that explaination , but it is more or less correct . 
  well in all seriousness , the crowd often does n't know what is best for them and i do n't think that voting with dnt can be compared to political matters as the average dnt holder who knows how to vote and wants to vote knows more about what 's best for district0x than the average political voter knows what 's best for his country . 
  i do n't think that 's a good comparison . 
  i prefer bull run dnt . 
  technically they 're both right . 
  it makes sense with or without the comma depending on which style of writing you use . 
  i 'd say that they 're both a good investment in the long run . 
  i used hitbtc to mew and ( i ca n't remember which ) but one of my token transfers ( either dnt or zrx ) took something like 10 hours . 
  other token transactions from hitbtc were fast though . 
  but more so strange . 
  if someone could do the same over pyongyang , that might help since we are closer to the icbm 's range . 
  kim does n't want war . 
  he wants you to think he wants war . 
  that along with keeping fear in his own people not to start a revolution keeps him alive and in power . 
  if he goes to war , he dies . 
  if he were to relax and become less of a totalitarian dictator , he will once again will be more likely die to either covert operations or people from within his regime . 
  he wants the status quo . 
  to get the status quo he needs to establish north korea as a military power . 
  he wants it but he 'll never get it and he knows that . 
  so he wants then next best thing . 
  the status quo . 
  other way around . 
  if it 's inflationary then it will devalue as the token is becoming more common . 
  since it is non-inflationary the value will only remain the same or go up in the long run if the demand stays the same or increases . 
  it 's a rock made of helium . 
  i bought for the same reason i buy all my coins . 
  a good idea with plenty of room for growth and good development team with a clear plan for the future . 
  plus , dnt is pretty unique and has little competition . 
  i 'm holding because it will show its value in the mid to long term . 
  it 's not a pump and dump . 
  i must admit that dnt is one of my more risky investments , but the returns could be huge and i can afford to lose $ 1,000 . 
  i bought in at 14 cents , so it 's very tough to continue to hold , especially as it does n't look like the bear run will end in the next few days , but i believe that in a month or two i will be thanking myself . 
  it may take a few more months than one or two if the whole crypto market wants to go bearish again , but either way , i 'm confident in dnt in the mid to long run . 
  god damn it china . 
  i will be hodling through this storm . 
  maybe even buying when i think we 've hit a bottom . 
  this . 
  if kim was n't a smart leader , he 'd have died years ago . 
  a successful leader must know what he 's doing . 
  to not have ended up like saddam requires a leader who can play his cards right . 
  besides , if kim was suicidal , he probably would 've re-started the war years ago to take as many southerners out with him as he can . 
  if kim is n't suicidal , then he wo n't start a war and he 'll continue to build up his nuclear arsenal to act as a deterrent , keeping him alive and in power .

  i 'm all for getting rid of shitty leaders who let power get to their heads , but i honestly believe that removing nuclear warheads would doom us for a world war 3 . 
  i lol 'd at the thought of millions of people dying ... hmm . 
  sooorry . 
  that 's an oversimplification . 
  you ca n't really simplify a complex situation like middle eastern politics without being biased or removing facts . 
  before i get downvoted , i 'm not trying to hate on this sub or the beliefs of people here and i know this is a meme , but i felt like that needed to be said . 
  i 'm yet to see someone justify why dnt will fail , let alone see someone with a sound and logical argument against the token . 
  my experience with hitbtc has been good . 
  i 've bought multiple coins there with no issue . 
  the only issue is that i paid about 5 cents more then the market price for zrx , but that 's the only coin which was n't sold to me at the market price . 
  you 're pretty much correct .
