  what can i do about it ? 
  it takes a slot 3 squares across and 2 squares down . 
  if i remember right someone tweeted that there will be 48 servers . 
  with the ping limit set at 1000 , i rarely see more than 10 , 2/3 of which are eu/uk which i ca n't play on due to ping . 
  is there a reason why we have n't had more servers put up yet ? 
  ** edit : ** apparently there are 30 more now since this was posted !, 
  thanks devs !, 
  i can tell because i would usually get 100 views in the first hour , and i have subbed to myself under a second account . 
  it is not in the feed of my other account and i have 8 views when i would usually have 100 + . 
  edit : it popped up in my subscriber 's feeds and i suddenly started to get views 1 hour and a half after i made it public . 
  gg youtube . 
  i 'm typing this because today i got a kill which requires extreme luck and i had no way of confirming if i got the kill or not . 
  if you find yourself on this situation , i would highly recommend checking with the server hosts to see if they can check the kill/hit logs for you . 
  i went into the pipsi.net teamspeak and one of the admins went through the kill log to find that i got a headshot kill with a chambered 1911 . 
  i could n't believe it . 
  ** here 's what happened : ** north of the stary sobor tents is a heli crash site , i am approaching it from the west with no weapons other than a chambered 1911 . 
  as i approach it , i see an offroad car approaching the heli . 
  i hide in a bush about 100m away from the heli crash . 
  i decide that since i am in need of loot i will fire some shots to get them to leave , hopefully leaving me some gear . 
  i take a shot , aiming at the helicopter so that there would be a ricochet sound . 
  i did n't aim at one of the 2 players looting it because a pistol is n't accurate enough . 
  soon after i fired my first shot i heard the car engine start and i saw it drive away . 
  i head on over and find a dead body with no ruined gear , it appears as though he has been headshotted since there is no ruined gear . 
  when i got off an hour later i checked with the admins and they confirmed the unbelievably lucky kill . 
  thanks to the pipsi.net admins for looking through the logs for me and i would highly recommend to others to check to see if what seems like a kill which you cant confirm actually was . 
  hi , i 'm moving from ps4 to pc and i am looking for the best gaming pc i can get for a minimum of $ 800 usd and a maximum of $ 1200 usd . 
  i 'm rather new to the pc world so sorry if i say something which may seem stupid . 
  what sort of performance could i expect from any suggested builds playing games like bf4 , bf1 and dayz standalone ? 
  ( while recording as i will always be recording ), 
  ** things which might be important : **, 
  * i will not be ordering parts online but from a local shop so prices may be slightly higher *, 
  * i will be recording all of my gameplay for my youtube channel however , editing will be done on my laptop . 
  * i am willing to wait a month or two if it will save a few hundred dollars . 
  * what are the important things to look for when getting a monitor ? 
  * i am not going to get a second monitor yet , besides i have a laptop and i do not plan on getting a monitor with a higher resolution than 1080p to start off with . 
  * what should i do about input lag for a monitor if i will be playing games like battlefield on both my tv which has a lot of input lag and a monitor ? 
  * i 'm aware that changing between screens with a lot of and very little input lag frequently makes playing quite hard so is it best to go with a monitor which has similar amount of lag to the tv so i remain used to it or will i just have to get used to switching between lots of lag and very little ? 
  * would it be a good idea to buy an ssd along with the hard drive ? 
  * would it be worth the extra price on a build at this budget ? 
  where will i see speed differences ? 
  thanks a lot !, 
  ** edit : ** also i will need a keyboard , any important things to look for when choosing one ? 
  i have a damaged battery , a pristine spark plug both in the locations they need to be , not just the inventory of the vehicle . 
  i have 4 pristine wheels and the car itself looks normal with no damage . 
  headlights are in and i can turn them on . 
  so why when i press engine on does nothing happen ? 
  it is as if i am not pressing engine on . 
  nothing happens , even the interact options do n't change . 
  i am from new zealand and i often play at non-peak hours for oceania servers , so there is often only one or maybe two to chose from . 
  as a result , i will sometimes join a west us server with a ping of about 150 . 
  north america is now one region on ps4 . 
  this is ridiculous . 
  i get over a 100 ping difference between what used to be called `` west us '' and `` east us '' servers . 
  i am aware that it is like this on pc , but please change it back !, 
  now i do n't know what i 'm joining , i could have a 150 ping or a 250 ping . 
  one is playable for a vehicle oriented player like me and one is not . 
  i need to be able to distinguish between the two locations !!!!, 
  this change was unnecessary and very infuriating as it not only negatively affects my gameplay but it also negatively affects others . 
  ** about me : **, 
  ** location : ** new zealand ( will play in us servers sometimes as i rarely notice lag and rarely kill trade etc on them . ), 
  ** time : ** i get on between 4am - 11am utc, 
  ** skill/experience ** my aim is average , maybe slightly above but my knowledge of the game is * really good * . 
  ( i know most callouts , good pvp tactics , i learn what spawns what in each patch and so on . ), 
  i 'm willing to play with anyone who has a decent amount of experience and who plays when i do !, 
  i realise that there may not be another one for the chernarus + map , i 'm just wondering what you guys think is a place devoid of high grade loot or a place which would benefit getting more players .

  i have heard that russian helis are a spawn location for them but i have n't seen any yet across dozens of helis . 
  is this correct ? 
  do they even spawn at all ? 
  kill them if they ca n't use their drugs in 24 hours . 
  even if they 're only smuggling a small amount of drugs then they still wo n't make a profit after paying for the flight and related expenses . 
  any large amounts will be deadly or impossible to use in 24 hours . 
  for the record , this was actually a shower thought . 
  i lost my bipod when i spray painted my m4 . 
  also , if you 're low on ammo , remove the magazine and the bullet in the chamber because i lost one round too . 
  if you know of anything else which can happen when spray painting your weapon , then comment down below . 
  on console , i have noticed that the first half second which you try turning , the speed at which you turn is slower than half a second later . 
  this is bad . 
  very bad . 
  it makes gameplay feel less fluid . 
  it makes aiming harder and generally makes infantry gameplay feel slower and less enjoyable . 
  there is no positive to this feature , all it does is have negative effects on gameplay . 
  please either remove this or give us an option to turn it off . 
  mine would have to be up & up . 
  it 's so unique and clever . 
  a perfect match for the tune . 
  i see them at almost every capture point sitting there doing nothing . 
  why not make them accessible from the spawn screen ? 
  it just feels this way to me . 
  also , i remember a streamer making a similar comment recently . 
  is it actually a thing that it has more recoil when you 're using a drum mag ? 
  they 're so eco-friendly that no trees were cut down to make sticks . 
  i try to add a filter and it gives me a list of servers which do not fit the filter criteria . 
  then when it tells me to name my filter , not only does it name my filter what i called it but it then only displays servers with the word which i used to name my filter in it . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** the server browser now will give you a list of random servers , almost all of which are foreign and empty or no servers at all . 
  so what are your favourite songs not on parachutes , arobtth , x&y , vlv , mx , gs or ahfod ? 
  personally i have always liked ghost story from a sky full of stars ep and miracles has been growing on me .

  i 'm moving from ps4 to pc and i will be playing plenty of bf4 and bf1 . 
  i have a mouse with 2 buttons where the thumb is , what should i bind these buttons to and what do you bind extra mouse buttons to ?
