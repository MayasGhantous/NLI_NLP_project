  edit : i play in vehicles a lot , however for air vehices i will be using a controller . 
  [ removed ], 
  of rog ( near electro ) , devil castle ( near severograd ) , zub ( near mogilevka ) and skalisty castle on skalisty island , which would be the best to find knight 's helmets ? 
  i have spent the last 3 days specifically looking for them to try and do some testing but i have n't been able to find any . 
  i have been to tisy , nwaf , smaller bases and i have looted at least 10 heli crashes but still , no frag grenades . 
  where did you find a grenade/where is the best place to look in 0.61 ? 
  ** edit : ** i finally found 2 m67s at a us heli crash site . 
  still took multiple days of looking for grenades though . 
  they push you through walls all the time . 
  i died in a situation where i should n't have if they could n't push you through walls . 
  here 's what happened :, 
  i had 4 zombies on my tail and i was bleeding , so i head into a shed , close the door and bandage . 
  i pull out my shotgun and open the door , i shoot one , then the other three push me out the back of the shed . 
  but i ca n't run away , i 'm essentially glued to the outside of the shed getting hit by zombies which i ca n't see because they are inside the shed . 
  since i have a shotgun , i ca n't hurt the zombies at all since shotguns have no penetration on dayz . 
  so i 'm stuck here getting hit by zombies i ca n't even see or run away from until i die . 
  now i 'm not against zombies being an actual threat in the game , but the pushing is just stupid . 
  if they could n't have glitched me outside the shed because of the terrible pushing mechanic , then i could have killed them with my shotgun and ran away from anymore which i alerted . 
  i 'm sure most people who play this game have had similar experiences from the zombies pushing mechanic which frankly , adds nothing to the game in its current state . 
  just like cars , i believe it should be removed from the game until it can work as intended . 
  you can write on them , but the moment you try to read it it shows a blank page . 
  why is this ? 
  is there a way to make it work , will it come in a hotfix or do i have to wait months until the next patch ? 
  why was the gun loading sound removed which played when someone was logging in with a gun in their hands ? 
  now if someone spawns in behind you , you have no way of knowing other than looking . 
  ** this has happened to me twice as the same character in the last 3 days ** and this needs to be fixed . 
  [ here are both cases . ], 
  ( https://youtu.be/em0oogkb6za ) both times , the player is in and moving within a few seconds and they are totally silent . 
  this is not fair . 
  if you choose to spawn in a dangerous place , you deserve to be at a disadvantage if there is someone in the area . 
  please add this sound back to armed players logging in . 
  it 's one of the most infuriating things in the game when you get ghosted , especially considering that there used to be an audio cue indicating that and armed player is logging in . 
  if i 'm wrong about anything in this please tell me .

  i 'm having issues trying to port chernarus + into arma 3 . 
  i have tried the 0.61 map and the 0.59 version ( one with the old and one with the new renderer , the new renderer supposedly causes issues ) but both times the game gives me an [ error ] ( https://i.redd.it/1voeqdbtu22y.png ) ( but with 0x0000000000fcf6f4 in place of the first code . ), 
  similar to the error which you sometimes get when you simply close dayz . 
  i followed all the steps in [ this tutorial ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bqeqcgqixe ) and everything works as it does in his video except when the game loads it crashes as i mentioned above . 
  so is there anyone here who can help or is there anyone who has it working and can could film a short cinematic for me ? 
  ( it 's only like a 10 second flyover of krutoy cap that i need right now . ), 
  any help is greatly appreciated . 
  i left my gpu mining overnight and when i got up i noticed that my cpu temperature was down at 30 degrees c ( it would usually be up at 80 when mining ) and only clocking 300mhz according to msi afterburner ( usually 1266mhz ) . 
  it said it was still mining at the time however . 
  when i stopped mining windows defender warned me of a trojan virus which it promptly asked me for permission to delete , so i let it delete it . 
  i restarted nicehash and it had to redownload something ( i forgot what it said it was ) and now whenever i try to start mining my gpu does n't leave idle and it says it 's mining speed is n/a and earning $ 0.00 . 
  what should i do from here to continue mining , and how can i avoid getting viruses in the future as i obviously do n't want any viruses to get past an anti-virus software i 'm running ( which at the moment is only windows defender ) . 
  should i start using different mining software ? 
  should i download other anti-virus software ? 
  any advice is greatly appreciated . 
  ** solved : ** nicehash files sometimes get flagged by anti-virus software . 
  all is fine . 
  there are a few things which make coldplay stand out to me . 
  they are things which * as far as i am concerned * are almost unique to or at least done best by coldplay . 
  some of these things are opinion , but a couple of them are facts whether you 're a coldplay fan or not . 
  \u2022 ** there is a coldplay for all moods . 
  ** this is why coldplay stands out to me over any other artists i like . 
  no matter how i am feeling , whether i 'm happy , down , indifferent or in need of motivation , there is an album which will cheer me up , keep me working or make me feel even happier when i already feel like i could n't be happier . 
  \u2022 ** their albums always end on a high point , ** both in terms of song quality and positive mood . 
  everything 's not lost is a great example . 
  i can start listening to parachutes feeling down with songs like sparks and we never change really showing that feeling , but it 's almost as if it builds up to the brighter tone of everything 's not lost which i find leaves me feeling much happier . 
  i find that this goes for all albums . 
  though some more so than others . 
  even the already upbeat albums finish strong with mx 's up with the birds and ahfod 's up & up . 
  \u2022 ** there are so many songs that they have made , all to a high standard ** when you include many of their great ep tracks . 
  it gets to the point where i find myself listening to a couple of songs a lot for about a month before re-discovering something different and it 's almost as if their music never gets old to me this way . 
  with other artists , i find i can enjoy their music a lot for a period of time , but after that , i just ca n't listen to their music without a break . 
  with coldplay , i find i can listen to their music every day and not get tired of their music . 
  \u2022 ** all of their albums flow very well . 
  ** i still enjoy music from many different artists , but i find that most albums from other artists do n't have the same flow to them when you play them right through . 
  i 'm not sure if anyone else feels this way about their music , but these are just some of the things which make coldplay my favourite band . 
  what is it about coldplay which makes you like them ? 
  i 'm interested to hear what others have to say !,

  after yesterday 's peak near $ 250 , unless you are experienced trader , now is not the time to sell !, 
  ( unless you bought below the current price and are happy with your profit ) but it * appears that we may * be re-entering a bear market , so sell now and rebuy at lower prices in the coming days , right ? 
  *** if you paid $ 240 + for ether your best bet is to hodl for the time being . 
  we will almost certainly rise above $ 250 again , if you bought as high as $ 350 + , we will also likely see that price again eventually . 
  if you sell now , there is no guarantee that you can re-buy your ether at a lower price and there is a good chance that the price will only steadily rise from here , * leaving you down even more ether . 
  * i have seen too many people in this sub saying that they sold at $ 150 and were planning to rebuy at $ 80 , and since the price did n't drop any lower , they had to rebuy at a loss at $ 200 + . 
  so , if you 're in the red at the moment like me , ( i 'm down about % 10 on when i bought in at $ 230 the end of may ) now is * not * the time to sell so you can rebuy cheaper . 
  there are no guarantees of any further significant price drops but we are likely to see a rise back to 250 + , 300 + or even 400 + prices in the coming year . 
  i recommend you forget about the price if it keeps dropping . 
  maybe even use the low price and buy some more like i have done , but ** only ever invest what you can afford to lose !, 
  ** so if the price drops below your buy in price any further , sit back , forget about it and check back in a month or two . 
  that way you do n't need to worry about any losses until you check back in a month and you do n't make any silly , impulsive , emotionally driven decisions leading to any further losses . 
  good luck trading or hodling !, 
  i 'm looking for an unbiased , honest opinion . 
  ** my questions : **, 
  what could go wrong to cause the price to drop ? 
  what is an optimistic projection over the next few months to 2 years ? 
  what is a realistic projection over the next few months to 2 years ? 
  what is a pessimistic projection over the next few months to 2 years ? 
  i 'll be reading up on omg in the next few hours . 
  any links to good , informative reads will also be appreciated . 
  ** edit : i sold some eth for omg . 
  looks like a promising coin with some big names and good devs backing it !, 
  will they rise with it ? 
  or are we more likely to see money flow out of erc20 tokens into eth as people try to ride the upward trend ? 
  what are your thoughts ?
