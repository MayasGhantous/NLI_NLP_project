do n't worry , he 's watching them . 
  thank you !, 
  those seven are being awfully shy about it if they do n't like it . 
  ** vu ** is not a native japanese sound , so it has only been used more recently , as japan became more and more westernised . 
  many japanese people still find it difficult to pronounce , hence it 's minimal use . 
  it would be like adding a letter into english which sounded like the japanese ** r ** , many people simply would n't be able to pronounce it . 
  and just for my input ,, 
  haha sorry , added it now !, 
  most craft stores sell fimo , or a similar product . 
  just ask them at the counter if you ca n't find it . 
  some other brand names include sculpey and polyclay . 
  however , fimo soft is the smoothest and softest imo . 
  [ see here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polymer_clay ), 
  [ and here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polymer_clay ), 
  now that i think about it , you could probably find it on amazon too . 
  no probs !, 
  she looks very . . modern teenager - like , yet still so graceful !, 
  fyi , i live in new zealand,

  new zealand is a pretty strange place , what with all the orcs and antimatter . 
  we do have mm . . bananas though :3,

  what - . - **, 
  entire forum is babies . 
  not australian , maybe new zealand/british . 
  i probably could have :3 i may do a more elaborate version at some point , maybe . 
  i made the background black because i could n't be bothered moving this away from all my other tests . 
  yep , a series of alternating redstone/repeater signals power the blocks below , which are then transferred upwards with redstone torches . 
  the caterpillar starts moving when you hit the button because of the bug where repeaters stop updating when you load the game . 
  tl ; dr : magic caterpillar is magic, 
  i think it looks really nice for a speed drawing , i love how quickly you managed to do the background in the end :d, 
  one thing to note however - the dress does n't look well-shaded . 
  the hair and other parts are more or less fine , but the dress does n't look . . fabric-like . 
  anyway , that 's just critique , and you wanted it !, 
  once again , nice speedy job . 
  i was pleasantly surprised they did n't need a texture pack or anything , to get the bold effect . 
  it does n't appear so by the `` making of '' video , i know right ? 
  it 's neat . 
  i 'm having a look at it myself , but i have also been going over more ergonomic strokes between humans and ponies ( if we want all bronies to learn equestrian script , let 's make it ergonomic eh ? ), 
  i 'll post my results tomorrow . . once i find the cable for the camera . . 
  what 's neat is that many of our invented strokes already resemble japanese characters , which gives room for adjustment . 
  was that too long ? 
  [ ] ( / flutteryay `` luckily you do n't have to :3 '' ), 
  [ ] ( / spitfire `` i do try to be efficient :d '' ), 
  i will work more on the script tomorrow . 
  remember ima keep it cursive , i 'm fairly certain we have a cursive theme going on with the whole hooves thing . 
  yep , i reckon sonic rainboom captures the fun and essence of the series very well . 
  here 's a pic showing the name :, 
  they do n't appear to have any purpose . . 
  they can always just not vote .

  she does n't have a horn in the third frame , happeh ? 
  this was a quick test of sorts , in case people liked it and if i , or someone else wanted to vector/edit it more . 
  yeah , at the moment the best shots are of this , her mouth slightly open and sneering , and her mouth open and jesting . 
  and bitch describes her character better than jerk :p, 
  but i can understand why . 
  thankies :3, 
  only reddit could make a meme out of this so quickly . 
  i read that iwata asks a while ago myself , it was quite the charming thing to find out . 
  new zealander here !, 
  [ for those who literally do n't know where we are , we 're in the bottom right corner of the map .

  i know the man himself , and he certainly likes legitimate commissions for these kinds of projects !, 
  you can pm him on youtube or head over to [ modretro ] ( http://forums.modretro.com/viewtopic.php?t=8571 ) if you seriously want one of these made for you , or just want to learn a little more about portabilizing in general . 
  thanks for your time !, 
  / plug, 
  he 's spent a good $ 100-300 on parts , ( i ca n't give you exact figures , but that 's the console , the screen , the casing , batteries , controls , tools etc ) in total working * far * less than minimum wage to give you that nice 600 . 
  whenever a portabilizer prices it at 600 , they 're doing you a favour . 
  i live in new zealand , and i can say that dairy and meat exporting are some of our most important industries . 
  our prices are actually going up , because of the crazy new-found demand in countries like china , where millions more people can now afford to get the stuff . 
  while i 'm not complaining if it helps our economy , i do n't think it will get too out of hand for us . 
  tldr ; new zealand may be left unscathed , if we balance our exporting right . 
  could n't have put it better . 
  can not upvote this and op enough . 
  you left new zealand out . 
  they look awesome , and tasty !, 
  hope your son loved/loves them !, 
  there are plenty of gen maps , and other maps . 
  it 's up to the server to find/use them . 
  making maps is also very easy . 
  just go to the forums there . 
  honestly , i do n't really know . 
  it 'd be nice for them to do that , i guess including maps is n't a priority or importance to them . 
  often for me , cancelling either before it freezes or when it goes client info , and doing it again makes it much faster . 
  i actually got this one . 
  what 's that from ? 
  labour will try to tell you otherwise . 
  weta workshops , a company in new zealand, 
  a weta is a giant and native insect . 
  same difference . 
  switch to windows 8 , and remove the new metro ui in regedit .
