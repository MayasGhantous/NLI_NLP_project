  i have faith that many recent studios , namely trigger will begin to further take advantage of crowdfunding . 
  perhaps even setting up it 's own internal crowdfunding system , humble , or bitcoin system ; to maximise income and cut out payment processing . 
  with the evolution of the production cycle , it 's also very difficult for a producer to misbudget a show . 
  a studio could possibly use their own coffers to create a 10-15 minute ova or picture-drama depicting either an adaption or an original work , and could be streamed directly to crunchyroll/nico with a free hd pass for backers , alongside the bd release . 
  the length of a series could be flexible depending on how much gets raised , and written accordingly . 
  all the sound for the average anime episode costs around $ 16,000 . 
  let 's say that cinematic english voice acting would cost $ 14,000 per 23 minutes * 4 = $ 56,000 on top of their initial goals . 
  for a real world reference point , the eve no jikan dub was estimated to cost $ 50k + . 
  plus in the manga they point out that her food is actually delicious , just . . hard to grasp . 
  considering they switched out what would look like an 11-year girl to what would look like a twenty-something ,, 
  yeah , this is basically softcore porn . 
  one argument against software patents is that almost everything in software is derivative of existing software , and nothing is revolutionary . 
  if everything is derivative , nothing is original . 
  i can guarantee that there has n't been a single piece of software released since 2000 which did n't have roots in , or was inspired by , some other piece of software . 
  changes in the abstractions of software are far too granular to say `` we came up with this mechanism '' . 
  the second argument would be that software is inherently math . 
  what if someone patented boolean logic , or machine learning ? 
  people have patented variations of wavelets . 
  mathematical functions . 
  one of the reasons `` standard technologies '' like video codecs take so long to develop is because the majority of all mechanisms and functions used in video encoding has been patented by some mathematician , computer scientist or corporation at some point in time ( the upcoming `` daala '' video codec is attempting to circumvent software patents altogether by using uncharted mathematical functions ) . 
  the third argument , might be that many companies do n't exercise their right to use or misuse software patents at all . 
  they apply for them purely so that no one else does , which is inefficient on both government scale , and on a corporate scale ; someone has to either assume that a company wo n't sue you , or otherwise will have to manage the logistics of licensing , or asking permission for the hundreds of patents your particular software probably infringes upon . 
  patents , and software patents in general are inherently flawed in the modern business world , because it is so easy for a corporation to simply set up a human machine where people churn out patents for the first thing which pops into their head ( the likes of apple and microsoft file thousands of software patents a year , for even the most granular of mechanisms ) . 
  patent lawyers at corporations have often said that their job consists of walking into various departments and filing a patent for whatever mechanism the piece of code on the screen is used for . 
  i 'm not suggesting we should n't protect innovation , but maybe the pipeline for innovation needs some innovation of it 's own . 
  the point i would like to get across is that the software industry moves dramatically faster than the hardware industry , to the point where almost every patent will inevitably hinder the development of just about every technology ( cisco shelled out billions of dollars last year to `` license '' the h264 codec to anyone for free . 
  that 's right , someone has to pay so that you could watch modern videos . 
  google gets sued for millions every year , and likely spends millions each year circumventing software patents to create `` web friendly '' modern video codecs . ), 
  i was actually going to use the fast inverse square root as an example of an algorithm which could have been patented ; apparently it was !, 
  if this is going to be used for electrical purposes , it is going to be insulated anyway . 
  on the point of asbestos however , carbon nanotubes would easily fit the bill . 
  tubes only a few atoms wide would do wonders to human health i 'd imagine . 
  just heed fair warning , a lot of the discussion on the website is completely subjective . 
  once you get past the point of `` low quality '' ( < $ 150 ish headphones and < $ 50 dacs/amps ) , a significant amount of the additional `` quality '' is pure speculation on the forum-goer 's parts , where only a personal blind-test could really prove anything better than anything else for you , which you probably could n't afford anyway . 
  i would also check out / r/headphones as well as the good old [ / g / headphone guide ] ( http://static3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121226031802/installgentoo/images/c/cc/headphone_guide.jpg ) , i always recommend this as a starting point , where you pick a headphone then find similar alternatives on head-fi . 
  would just like to mention [ pricespy ] ( http://pricespy.co.nz/ ) for any new zealanders out there ( much wider range of retailers and hardware to compare , compared to pcpartpicker ) . 
  i 'd actually say that there are some cheaper things here ( like some hdds ) , taking into account shipping costs . 
  we are on the opposite end of the world to just about everyone , and shipping heavy/big stuff costs a nightmare , even with youshop coupons . 
  plus warranties are n't as big of a hassle . 
  processors and gpus tend to be cheaper overseas , though . 
  neither big-max-index nor minimum wage even makes any sense compared to ppp . 
  that aside , there 's nothing stopping hardware retailers from undercutting each-other with parallel imports and minimally-staffed warehouses . 
  we 're not comparing bread and milk here . 
  unless a country has crazy import taxes , * with healthy local competition * and an efficient warehouse , you will find that most products will generally be the same + shipping + taxes + competitively tentative markup . 
  that said , if there are only a couple of franchise retailers and one or no warehouse retailers , the main factor would probably be absurd mark-ups . 
  is there a reason why you are not buying headphones , ie a home-theatre for a crowd ? 
  did you read the article ? 
  kaveri apus run mantle . 
  home theatre just means you have 4-7 speakers and a sub-woofer instead of 2 , so it kind-of sounds more `` surrounded '' . 
  you could upgrade from 2.1 to 5.1 if you just bought 3 more speakers . 
  however , if you 're not planning on delivering this sound to an audience , headphones simply make more sense . 
  it seems you do n't know enough about headphones in general , though . 
  first up , never buy a surround headset ( kraken ) . 
  if they physically include more speakers , you will have terrible sound quality . 
  if they emulate more speakers with software , you 're wasting money . 
  second up , never buy a headset ( kraken ) . 
  the act of placing a microphone on a headphone somehow causes a $ 50-100 mark-up for literally all headsets . 
  grab a $ 5 detachable zalman mic or something . 
  third up , never buy a usb headphone/headset , only 3.5 mm ones . 
  usb ones contain their own dac ( processes sound ) and amp , and then mark up the price $ 50-200 . 
  for that you could buy a separate dac/amp , a sound card , or a separate dac and separate amp . 
  fourth up , never buy any headphone with the phrase `` game '' used in it 's marketing ( kraken ) . 
  gaming headsets are $ 50-100 more expensive because they are `` designed for gaming '' , as if there is somehow a difference . 
  with that in mind , i would first check [ this guide ] ( http://static3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121226031802/installgentoo/images/c/cc/headphone_guide.jpg ) as a reference to work from , budget wise . 
  `` open '' headphones are designed to sound as natural as possible , but leak sound in/out . 
  these are basically superior to speakers . 
  `` closed '' will try to prevent sound from leaking in/out but can sound , well , like it 's coming from speakers centimetres away from your head . 
  never buy active noise cancelling . 
  if it could n't isolate the sound on it 's own , it 's probably poor quality anyway . 
  above the $ 150 point , i would almost exclusively stick with audio-technica ( dj/basshead favourite ) , beyerdynamic ( personal favourite ) , sennheiser ( crowd favourite ) and akg . 
  check out the sidebar at / r/headphones for some additional tips for buying them . 
  when visiting head-fi , have a healthy air of scepticism when reading recommendations or comments , as there is tons of subjectivity when discussing headphones . 
  if you are not planning on moving your dac/amp around , [ i would also get one of these sound cards ] ( http://pcpartpicker.com/parts/sound-card/#qq=1&amp;d=24&amp;sort=a9&amp;m=8 ), 
  the `` x '' series ' use pci-express rather than old pci , otherwise the more you pay the better components you will get . 
  you wo n't notice a difference above the d1 unless you buy some unwieldly $ 500 headphones however . 
  if all player entities are known at all times , why is it that when you record a demo , no players appear outside the pvs ? 
  would n't it be a convenient feature if player positions outside the pvs were visible in demos ? 
  so you 're saying that despite all player entities being available to the player , they would n't be used in a demo where viewing the player entity information is beneficial ? 
  what 's going on with link 's cheek , it it the light or does it look like he 's smirking ? 
  i do n't get how people can not grasp the costs of traditional anime production . . even before they see the numbers . 
  every single thing you see on screen ? 
  someone had to draw that , someone had to colour it , someone had to composite it . 
  they had to be paid for their time , which is already abysmal pay in most positions . 
  this happens 4-12 times a second over a 23-minute video . 
  that 's not even starting on the direction , scripts and sound . 
  the anime industry as we know it is completely and absolutely unsustainable without otaku . 
  cg-anime costs dramatically less however , and however much you complain , the industry will become almost entirely cg at some point . 
  advances in the anime aesthetic with the likes of guilty gear xrd should help ease the transition i suppose . 
  this looks interesting , but with exception to open source , does this do anything particularly better than voxel farm ? 
  the smaller transistors also result in smaller dies , which is most important for the company as it allows for higher yield . 
  what do you mean , `` more can be done at once '' ? 
  a larger die with the same transistor count and architecture will perform effectively the same . 
  but you would be designing a separate processor altogether if you had one with more transistors , so the two are not comparable . 
  intel does n't `` throw more transistors ! '', 
  onto their shrunk processors . 
  you 're basically asking whether more transistors on the same architecture will lead to better performance . 
  in most cases , yes . 
  i7 's have more transistors than i5 's , and they perform better . 
  i would usually say grey means no data . 
  this presentation is more colourblind friendly , though a colourblind and `` beautiful '' palette could certainly have been used .
