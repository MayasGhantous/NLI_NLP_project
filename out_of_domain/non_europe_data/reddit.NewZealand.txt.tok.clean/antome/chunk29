  this subreddit has always been skewed towards male viewers . 
  in the past people have suggested that the extremely young demographic here , which leads to gratuious ecchi and female cosplay kept at the top of the subreddit , discourages female subscribers . 
  if you look at the demographics of anime conventions , they are almost always pretty even . 
  well , if they showed absolute values , just about everything would be a population density map . 
  i also love runs where rng is the major factor , such as pokemon , because then it becomes a game of risk assessment and alternative planning . 
  you might be getting world record pace , but suddenly your route wo n't work any more , or you bought too many items !, 
  the critical analysis that werster can handle in the middle of a run is always impressive . 
  by the time you die , diamonds could have become a commodity though !, 
  probably better than ashes , mind you . 
  i think a preserved cube of carbon fibre would be neat . 
  as a new zealander , here i thought all toothpaste was * toothpaste * flavoured . 
  what 's wrong with having lots of tea house rooms if lots of tea house rooms look nice ? 
  starcraft 2 is one of the most impressively poorly optimised games i have seen . 
  the game barely takes advantage of more than one core , and modern graphics pipelines ? 
  so a less reliable , slower performing , more expensive ssd ? 
  * 30mb/s in case any one got confused . 
  bitcoin has no feasibly exploitable flaw . 
  some people gave their bitcoin to another corporation , who lost it for them . 
  once bitcoin leaves its own system , it 's no better than fiat , and it 's sad that people get disillusioned by that . 
  i keep hearing two stories from the press . 
  one is that the game is far too short , and one is that the main story is too short . 
  at the same time , konami has said constantly that they wanted to make the game more open world , and give it more room for side-missions and player experimentation . 
  as such , i feel that the press which is touting `` the game is too short '' may not be giving us the full picture . 
  does any one else want to weigh in on that , or is everyone just of the belief that ground zeroes is going to be a tanker section ? 
  reviews of the smartphone game found that for a smartphone game , the game was pretty fantastic . 
  but that 's it right there , the game was designed with the inflexibility of a smartphone in mind . 
  so take that as a reference point when you consider the value of the package . 
  syd is a boke-tsukkomi . 
  nothing more , nothing less . 
  and it is a fantastic one at that . 
  people getting invested in shipping characters are going into the show with the wrong premise entirely . 
  someone wan na make an apng , or is there something which can scrape all the files ? 
  i would probably look at adjusting the shader to be either fully prebaked , or some form of cel shading . 
  right now this looks like `` spirited away 64 '' . 
  taisei corporation contracts the studio behind many of makoto 's works to emulate his style . 
  so probably a fair bit , but not as much as you might imagine , unless you 're asking for the man himself . 
  not sure about the dvds , but the bds were 2 episodes a volume . 
  12 volumes . 
  $ 80 each . . yeah , not sure what was going on in kyoani 's head there . 
  if by filters you mean lanczos , that 's not really filtering , that 's basically the bare minimum for upsampling nowadays ( and some consoles do n't even use lanczos !, 
  they stick with some tacky bilinear shit ) . 
  post-processing shaders on the other hand , well that 's just the devil 's work . 
  bear in mind that just about every video player uses bilinear , mostly because the programmers are stuck in the 80s . 
  [ here 's some madvr filters for reference . 
  ] ( http://madshi.net/madvr/monsters.png ), 
  as you can see , lanczos is one of the worst categories of filters nowadays , relative to the new filters we have had since 2010 . 
  not that big corporate signal processing engineers seem to care ( or are allocated enough budget to care ) . 
  in fact , if the xbone even implemented jinc3 ar , i bet it would look nearly as good as the ps4 ( as the ps4 's only marginally better performance causes it to , in minimal cases , lose out on a little detail that the xbone can achieve , albeit at a lower resolution ) . 
  while it 's an empty hope , if the next ( nintendo ) console implemented nnedi3 or whatever we have at that stage , i would be happy with marketing departments touting `` unlimited resolution '' , because it legitimately decouples `` detail '' from `` resolution '' , unlike these choppy filters . 
  do n't modern fighting games implement some sort of `` mutually agreed input delay '' and/or tick rate to help compensate ? 
  netcode is hard , but it is n't * that hard * ( granted , dice 's netcode managed to get * worse * over the years ) . 
  hopefully nintendo will pull it together for smash 4 . 
  if there are criticisms available on the internet over dunbar 's number , would you mind adding a `` criticisms '' section to wikipedia ? 
  i think that would help a lot of people come to a better understanding of the idea . 
  a * good * reddit comment section will provide concise analysis of the longer article , abstracting essential meaning . 
  with this you might be able to read the text faster , but would you be able to perform complex abstract or critical analysis , like you might otherwise do on the side ? 
  put otherwise , i think that slow-reading an abridged novel would probably give more opportunity for abstracting meaning and critical analysis , than a sped-up complete version . 
  consider reading the slashdong blog , and have a nice day . 
  i imagine the bug was found early in development , but they decided to roll with it . 
  in regards to twitch shooters , i would imagine people feel that ironsights essentially `` adds a scope '' to otherwise unscoped weapons , which for those who play counter strike all the time , is almost like `` easy mode '' in a sense . 
  back in the day , having a scope was one of various tradeoffs which came into balancing a weapon both in a casual and competitive sense , particularly when resolution used to be in the 480p crt realm . 
  considering the surge of eve and the ridiculously impressive upcoming star citizen , i think we are coming full circle . 
  now that everyone at least has a marginally immersive setup , a reasonably fast gpu and broadband , you can have crazily large scale space-warfare . 
  was going to say , freeview satellite relies on arcane video encoding technologies . 
  i was pleasantly surprised to find that freeview terrestrial used h. 264 . 
  in a way i wished they waited a little while and used 10bit/265 instead . 
  the `` deuteranope '' one just looks like a more saturated protanope to me , interestingly . 
  if anything i would prefer a minimalistic , abstract style , at least at first . 
  from the looks of those headsets , it could n't possibly improve in any reasonable fashion . 
  the position of the headband reduces the recording of brain patterns to the most basic of levels ( average activity of the brain , more or less ) . 
  the device would have to look something like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/eeg_cap.jpg ) to even begin separating controls into `` average activity of some areas of the brain '' , and that 's with a recently cleaned , shaven scalp . 
  it 's not so much that you ca n't use your brain , it 's more that the device simply has too few electrodes to make any meaningful measurement of the brain . 
  you need to space a good 50 + electrodes along a cleaned , shaven scalp to even begin accurately measuring activity of * parts of * the brain . 
  i would assume sealand does n't count as it is not recognised as a self-governing territory by any other territory . 
  with improvements in high-frame-rate cameras in recent years , i wonder if we are all that far-off from an extremely precise , low-latency and high frequency eye-tracker . 
  at a low cost . 
  nevertheless i had not thought of this , and the more i think about it , the more this makes sense for a single-person setup , like an hmd or 25 '' 4k monitor on the desk . 
  honestly , i think this sort of technology is potentially far more exciting than kinect and other motion tracking . 
  while eye-tracking software never works , procedurally optimising layouts of user interfaces and simple things like `` page down '' as you reach the end of a line , along with this technology , would definitely show a decisive benefit , i think . 
  someone will design a separate , `` planning game '' for tpp where people organise the set of controls to be used the following day . 
  besides xna being tangentially similar to directx , is there any particular reason they chose directx over opengl ? 
  one would think that cross-platform play would be a major selling point for a title like this . 
  i prefer the former image , albeit with possibly a darker/purpler blue . 
  the black-white-red scheme might fit with the maori flag , but the significant red looks a bit overpowering and the design overall takes on a more fascist feel . 
  [ something like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mnwy64y.png ) , for example . 
  more importantly , this could be the one and only opportunity we have for a country to use a purple-ish hue , think about that . 
  [ wales ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/flag_of_wales.svg/1000px-flag_of_wales.svg.png ) and [ prussia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/flag_of_prussia_1892-1918.svg/1000px-flag_of_prussia_1892-1918.svg.png ) would like to have a word with you . 
  relative to many flags , this would be pretty damn simple . 
  [ going for a simplified fern ] ( https://johnansell.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/which-fern4.jpg ) would n't be a terrible idea , either . 
  while that may be the case on paper , as a kiwi i can assert to you that red is used so insignificantly outside of minor indigenous cultural activities , that our nation 's `` colours '' are pretty much white/silver and black . 
  if anything you see more blue than red on national `` symbols '' , with the likes of air new zealand . 
  honestly , i ca n't remember the last time i saw the prominent use of red in anything . 
  it 's just a shame that they are all mon ( emblem ) s in the centre of a unicolor background . 
  they might as well be prefectural emblems . 
  the cool thing about that is that we could theoretically take advantage of this idea to have 4k + displays which only display a fraction of that resolution at the point the eye is looking , through eye tracking . 
  this could solve the current issue of gpus not being able to render 4k + without choking . 
  i doubt that 's either a short or mid term solution , but automated modelling could become a thing later down the line . 
  more likely however , is that this is integrated into future encoding standards . 
  modern encoders already do quite a bit of what you are talking about , preserving bitrate in `` interesting '' areas . 
  neural networks will be the obvious evolution of that , which will be a 2017 ish thing .
