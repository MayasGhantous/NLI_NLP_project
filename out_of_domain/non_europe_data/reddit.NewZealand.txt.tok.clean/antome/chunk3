  hat hat hat hat , hatty hat !, 
  they are definitely 16 * 16 , it looks like you have it set at 16 * 20 ? 
  [ more flair hat . 
  fix flair overlap hats hat hat  . 
  i got a virus visiting the ghost trick page , that was a good half-hour pain . 
  hid all my files . 
  this is going to take forever to revert : /, 
  [ more hats !!!!, 
  modest + treasure + others !, 
  hats !!!!, 
  yes it can . 
  use the [ vtf plugin ] ( http://nemesis.thewavelength.net/index.php?p=50 ) , and, 
  paste into the paint.net/filetypes folder, 
  make each frame a layer , and select the animation option on save ( as vtf ) . 
  pretty cool downvotes you have there . 
  he said something along the lines of `` look at my downvotes ;d '', 
  could be you , or could be that i secretly hatted by credits into the png hex !, 
  many hats have been interested to know how subreddits fared before and after the sopa hatout . 
  hat !, 
  especially considering how tightly packed some of japan 's urban areas are . 
  it could have been possible that the pilot was n't looking at the controls at all , and simply reached out and turned the knob , before realizing it was big . 
  still dumb ? 
  hell yes . 
  but another way to look at it . 
  couple other tips , bind a key ( ie middle click ) to toggle fov for more accurate aim with the ambassador . 
  keep calm , any excited twitching/panic can throw off your aim . 
  practice . 
  not much else to it , in all seriousness . 
  practice in pubs , tr_walkway or wherever you want . 
  that 's the 3d skybox . 
  when inside the map , the skybox is scaled up 16x and fitted onto the map , to make it appear that the map extends farther than it really does . 
  a 2d skybox is the sky itself , which is literally the sky mapped on to the inside of a cube . 
  ( it does n't look like a cube because it is always an infinite distance away from you ), 
  but i thought you wanted whiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing ? 
  double whoosh . 
  even though the clip was only ten seconds , i thought the editing was amazing . 
  is that a bad thing ? 
  it would be particularly pertaining to my interests to notice how many downvotes this may attract . 
  really love the mentioning of of the pomson !, 
  that weapon can be ridiculously frustrating , and really hampers some core gameplay mechanics in tf2 . 
  hmm , a spy knife that breaks global game mechanics ? 
  spycicle is enough for me . 
  well if enough people use the service ( and you can handle enough people ! ), 
  you will get a more and more accurate average of prices over time . 
  but indeed you could create an monthly ( or weekly ) average from your stats . 
  overall still far more accurate than the spreadsheet , which is just speculation . 
  also , it looks like you are using godaddy !, 
  did you not learn from the whole sopa fiasco ? 
  server ip ? 
  does this loadout show up for other players on the server also ? 
  vector 'd, 
  he has never performed for money , and only took one masterclass , with his own savings . 
  when you get straight to the point it may not seem fair , but he is still an amateur . 
  intelligent systems made paper mario . 
  they also made advance wars . 
  post this in [ / r/circlejerk ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk ) for normal responses . 
  back then a link cable was like internet , you needed it for the multiplayer . 
  the point was not that you would buy yourself * another * gameboy & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ; but rather have a friend who had a gameboy get the other version . 
  pokemon had that social aspect to it . 
  dlc is not a different version of a game . 
  it is n't even an expansion . 
  in the case of ea , it was deliberately left out content to the game . 
  with nintendo , it was deliberately split content between two games , with the intention that you would trade with a friend to `` catch them all '' . 
  i am not intentionally suggesting this at all , and any assumption of naivete is unfortunate . 
  of course there are two versions of pokemon to make more money . 
  and of course there are relations between the concepts of split games , expansions , and dlc . 
  they are all ways for a company to make more money , be it through completionist content , additional content , or social encouragement . 
  another interesting , unrelated thing to point out is that the film [ clue ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clue_%28film%29 ) had different endings depending on the theater you visited . 
  i dont see anything wrong with adding/spreading content , so long as it is not required for the player to experience a significant area of the storyline . 
  i believe the word you are looking for is ** brave ** . 
  view in fullscreen , lights off . 
  sit about two to three feet from the monitor , and put a finger in the center of the image , about a six inches from your face . 
  look at the finger , then without adjusting your vision , look behind the finger to the screen . 
  move your finger back and fourth until the two circles merge . 
  then try moving the finger away , and holding that gaze . 
  when you feel your eye muscles adjusting back to normal , try to `` reverse '' that motion . 
  with red and green squares , i see almost a smoky lime colour , and with blue and yellow i see a kind of smoky cyan colour . 
  of course these are not quite what they are , but the closest i can describe . 
  does n't mention internet , but rather `` blog '' . 
  however as said , the mac comic does n't appear to be particularly canon , considering none of the things in the comic appeared in game . 
  i craft my items , but i needed a backpack expander ( kindly donated ) to hold doubles of every weapon . 
  i craft the triples . 
  i dont need to have to wait anymore , i have almost two of every weapon . 
  so it could n't use a simple stand of sorts to support itself ? 
  and now we wait for the imminent repost . 
  your point ? 
  i 'm pretty sure that you are told this in the crafting menu itself . 
  1 to have , 1 to trade . 
  i never understood rocketjump scripts . 
  such a simple and obvious movement does n't need to be automated . 
  he is a great modder , but essentially he has been trying to do all sorts of immoral things with the people he was `` working with '' . 
  the biggest joke was after max posted the vlog about mecha , mecha created a propaganda-fuelled , misinforming response . 
  so while he has made some really cool mods , he has equally been fuelling his own ideals . 
  someone could watch the vlogs maxofsd did ( and the responses ) if they wish to get more specifics . 
  was expecting , was not disappointed . 
  i think a doctor on reddit said at one point that he actually swapped the baby .
