  that particular example was infuriating , as my scrolling pretty much exclusively consists of autoscroll , which outright does n't work there . 
  if i ca n't scroll-click your links , and i ca n't autoscroll , i 'll stop using your site no matter how functional it is otherwise . 
  with the way nintendo has returned in full force supporting core gamers , i wonder if they will even drop the wii brand for their next console . 
  honestly , at this point you would think they would just call their next system the `` nintendo ( 8 ) '' considering that 's what every non-gamer and his dog calls it . 
  no mismarketing catastrophes , and the brand recognition already exists , possibly even stronger then the `` wii '' brand . 
  motion blur just seems counter intuitive in that sense . 
  high-quality motion blur is sure to drop a good ten frames or so , but the point of it was to mask low framerates ? 
  monitor ghosting gives you motion blur for free at high framerates . 
  he is right , but for the wrong reasons . 
  the brain 's visual processing has no practical set limit , it 's more a case that the brain picks and dumps the information it needs/does not need . 
  that leads to the illusion of motion around the 15-25 fps mark , as the brain `` fills in '' the jagged motion . 
  increasing framerate simply increases the `` realism '' of the motion , up until around the 95fps mark where the brain is `` buffering '' enough temporal information to not need much , if any more detail . 
  hence why hmds like the oculus rift and valve 's prototype are trying to target 95fps . 
  if you have the time , i would seriously recommend that you implement a video scrubber on all of your gif/video files so that the user can play/pause/slowmo and scrub through the video frame-by-frame , possibly with a slider . 
  you might be able to use [ this ] ( https://github.com/ghepting/javascript-video-scrubber ) as a starting point . 
  another useful option would be to look at the video stabilised on the stage ( normal ) but also an option where the video is horizontally stabilised to the player , such that the action in question is always taking place in the horizontal centre of the screen . 
  that way the beginner can get a feel for the visual indicators of each technique . 
  some variations on rapid prototyping do allow printing fairly large objects in a matter of a couple of hours . 
  you 're just going to have to cough up hundreds of thousands for one . 
  what if you scanned the foot then printed the ideal shoe shape , overlaid it with leather , then placed an insole on top ? 
  do n't think you could get much more comfortable than that . 
  one important use case would be to aid in the detection of dark energy or dark matter . 
  we have no idea how strongly it interacts with the environment , which is why even slight changes in temperature could be the difference in being able to detect the phenomenon or not . 
  pretty much our only real avenues for figuring out what dark matter and dark energy * is * , is to detect something which is not explained by standard particles , or to try and create it with particle collision . 
  what could be interesting with this is that it could lead to further research into the proportion of `` regulatory '' genes which largely only affect cosmetic traits . 
  so essentially , while the chemicals are toxic , they are n't a problem in terms of changing the atmosphere ? 
  are there components in the process of producing lithium polymer/solar cells which are legitimately harmful long term if produced on industrial scales ? 
  they should give out files to 3d print the trophies , then everyone ( with a 3d printer ) can be happy !, 
  you would be surprised . 
  decent 3d printers for small prints are down in the $ 300-400 range nowadays , and i can name one local and several overseas friends off the top of my head that have some form of access to one . 
  well if you look at lets plays , and how nintendo considers all media its assets , i guess you are right in a way . 
  i was meaning the printer itself , the `` ink '' is in the range of several dollars . 
  if you know a friend doing engineering at a university or something , you could probably get one done fairly cheaply . 
  of course there are always online services like shapeways that can be quite cost-effective for very small prints . 
  good thing the mods only removed topics where people would n't get too mad at them . 
  heaven forbid they remove the few articles with comments where people call them out . 
  m2k is n't going , so at least they wont find * every * glitch over the course of the tournament . 
  they are bound to find a few though . 
  that said , the sheer number of people playing the game at best buys might result in game-breaking glitches , no matter how interesting , get patched . 
  [ * full power !, 
  * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lj1zrgt_ow ) * panzer vor !, 
  sounds good to me . 
  maybe it is a dynamic stage where bottomless pits appear . 
  could change the focus of the match in an interesting way . 
  i think that it 's important that m2k retains a [ healthy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rom4mgd.jpg ) [ balance ] ( http://i.imgur.com/s47opxf.png ) [ of poses ] ( http://i.imgur.com/thjp5y4.jpg ) . 
  sony wega , any size , make sure it has [ component in ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/component_video_jack.jpg ) . 
  if all else fails , just make sure it has component in . 
  if you do n't have component cables on hand , [ they come pretty cheap on ebay ] ( http://www.ebay.com/itm/161298850903?sspagename=strk:mesindxx:it&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1436.l2649 ) . 
  does n't matter how fancy a crt you get , if you are using composite video it will always look worse than any crt with component video . 
  for reference , composite ( yellow ) uses one cable for brightness and colour , s-video ( black ) is essentially two cables in one for brightness and colour , and component ( red , green , blue ) is 3 cables for brightness , and two half colours . 
  nearly all laptop monitors are terrible , and have at least a frame of input lag by itself . 
  you might want to invest in a [ cheap tn monitor ] ( http://pcpartpicker.com/parts/monitor/#sort=a11&amp;t=1,4 ) with very low latency . 
  while we 're at it , tech and wavedashing can become tensor skewing . 
  except that is impossible without cutting something , considering the console gpus are basically variations on 7570/7770/7850s . 
  they might be able to cram in a bunch of visual flair , but only at 720p 30fps , or maybe they cut it back at 900p 60fps , it will greatly depend on how they choose to optimise it in the end . 
  in some cases it looks like a blocky youtube video , but in others it does seem to show just how beautiful sakurai 's team managed to make the game under the limitations of the 3ds . 
  for reference i am using a combination of neural-network based edge directed interpolation , followed by some flattening to reduce artefacts and countered with some `` artificial '' detail filtering . 
  yup , 4x nnedi3 scaled down with catmull-rom . 
  scaling 2x is possible now , and accurate 4x is n't far away . 
  8x is a bit sci-fi , but in all the cases , you can only use existing information to create new information . 
  the more you scale , the more you have to start `` creating '' information with grain or hand-modifying . 
  that sub seems to be almost entirely upscaling via emulation , but thanks for the link either way . 
  not sure if it helps , but i have an anti-adblock killer script which helps some sites . 
  [ overall marketshare of windows platforms , on the steam hardware survey  ( http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/?platform=pc ), 
  windows 7 : 65 % , unchanging, 
  windows 8 : 26 % , increasing, 
  xp : 6 % , decreasing, 
  you may be right that windows 7 has `` most '' users , but the second most is windows 8 and that is continuing to increase . 
  assuming all xp users switched to 8 , windows 8 would make up a third of all windows marketshare . 
  the notion that no one uses windows 8 is a circlejerk invented by people who do n't like change . 
  i think the most apt comparison would be to say that 4k is like putting cleartype on everything . 
  i think you would come off as a lot more approachable if you took a more passive stance , and made it be known that anyone can approach you and money match you if they want to . 
  it might be less convenient , but it lets others feel like they are being given an opportunity , rather than being `` forced to fail '' . 
  if you are not in the mood for money matches at a particular time , make sure you have a clean escape like `` sorry , i 'm a little burned out at the moment '' or `` sorry man , i really need to focus on this upcoming matchup '' followed up by `` maybe we can have a match at [ approximate later date here ] ? '' . 
  even if you do n't have a good reason for refusing matches , using some variation on those two will go a long way . 
  in fact this is an excellent approach to inquiring or being inquired by anyone . 
  learn to use casual but positive language , and always make it seem like the other person is getting more out of the conversation than you are . 
  i do n't know how bad the lecturers are at other universities , so i cant speak much for that . 
  at least the practical/theory work is very good , and the computer facilities are well maintained . 
  i found the electronics course is run better than compsci , but maybe compsci is just run badly everywhere else and we 're just doing fine . 
  can confirm , my only problem with alibaba is that there are not enough businesses using it . 
  having said that , more businesses use it than anything else except for possibly amazon and ebay , though those are more consumer oriented businesses . 
  there are no fees however , so there is near zero barrier to entry . 
  it depends on the electronics . 
  china does n't make good displays anyway , you buy korean and japanese for that . 
  you would usually buy stuff like switches and amplifiers from those suppliers in china . 
  solid-state-ish components that are complex in design vs complex in mechanics . 
  / r/todayilearned, 
  as a first year student who is interested in more theoretical areas like deep learning and image processing , what sort of papers would you consider to be beneficial from either an industry , or theoretical standpoint , or both ? 
  seriously , the number of times i 've stayed in some hotel or at a relatives/friends house with sky , to end up watching public television is ridiculous . 
  and that 's when there 's no internet . 
  the only thing sky has going for it is their movie channels and cartoon network , which never have the movies or the cartoons you want . 
  for me , it 's an issue of media quality as a whole . 
  i 'm willing to download something overnight if it means i do n't have to put up with barely-better-than-youtube-tier 1080p , plus i do n't see how people can stand flash/javascript media players . 
  the fact that with the correct setup , you can get better quality movies in a scheduled manner with not godawful subtitles if required , in some cases ( namely anime ) before the show/movie even shows up for online streaming , with a media player which can produce better synchronised video and audio with less jitter , better luma and chroma upscaling ( why the hell does everyone still use bilinear ?!, 
  ) , better colour accuracy , dithering , surround up/downmixing and proper , advanced subtitles , all makes streaming a hard sell for me . 
  but your question might be , `` why not import blu rays from x country ? '', 
  to which i would reply that these will still have inferior subtitles , and then require decrypting and ripping to be able to be played properly on ideal software media players . 
  coming in at cost probably half a days ' worth of working wage for most people , if not more depending on the country and media . 
  the other solution of course would be to just stream video , but it 's like trying to watch 360p youtube video after getting used to the ( albeit horrible looking ) 1080p on youtube .
