  the one problem with this neat format is that it is not a sustainable `` job '' per se , and matthewmatosis himself admits that this is a hobby he does because he wants to , funded by an actual job . 
  to go so in depth and to edit together a video essay towards the hour length takes a huge amount of time and dedication , in contrast to relatively freeform `` lets play '' channels . 
  i think this is a big reason why smash and other fighting games tend to only have scenes in europe , asia and the us . 
  in places like oceania , sure you can hold tournaments , but there is simply a lack of critical mass which prevents people from standing on each-others shoulders as they work up to the skill ceiling . 
  this contrasts with the fps or moba genres for example , where as long as you have decent latency you can improve simply by playing . 
  i dunno , having to tsukkomi kotomi all the time could get kind of tiring , and i do n't even want to think what would happen if you let her go for more than a few days . 
  i thought you were wrong , but in checking it seems both the wii and ds are just 2 million shy of surpassing the ps1 and ps2 respectively , which is interesting in itself . 
  maplestory is still going , and making more than wow ? 
  that 's crazy . 
  imagine how cool it would be if amd made a modular chipset where motherboard manufactuers could say , create a motherboard with 10 slots and you could throw in a bunch of 7600 's . 
  that would probably be the ideal video encoding rig . 
  i thought it was only a small group of people behind robotics ; notes ? 
  mind you the anime got butchered . 
  honestly , i expect this to cause a significant split in the metagame . 
  many communities will want it in to develop interesting mechanics , while others could treat it like items . 
  from my understanding , items ended up being banned not because of the randomness ( of what was inside the box , placement and timing was also a problem ) , but because some of the items cause disproportionate advantages ? 
  i remember some recent interview where someone said that they would love items if you could choose the range that could come out , but i ca n't find it now . 
  in any case , i was more thinking that some communities might think that players will build movesets that reduce the competitiveness of the game . 
  the point is that they are not pushing the envelope . 
  many android and windows 8 ( namely nokia ) devices have this feature set , with an interface which is just as intuitive , if not more . 
  if camera manufacturers wanted to revamp the ui , they could have done it years ago . 
  i 'm willing to bet they will at best make incremental changes as per usual . 
  the difference between them is probably statistically insignificant , but `` number of women sold to slavery '' is not the specific metric being used here . 
  this is to do with, 
   representation in decision-making structures, 
   outcomes on access to basic and higher level education, 
   outcomes on salaries , participation levels and access to high-skilled employment, 
  sure , japan has more opportunity than most countries , that does n't change the fact that men get more of that opportunity than women . 
  in japan right now men are far more likely to scale though higher education and corporate structures than women can . 
  remember inequality = / = poverty . 
  the one thing i must absolutely say that you have to do is get a lawyer to read the contract . 
  you ** must ** do this . 
  while this is sound advice for any job , this is an absolute must for mlms and `` unconventional '' jobs . 
  the contracts can often be designed to suck you into a state where you have to work for them for a considerable amount of time before you start getting acceptable money . 
  the other major problem with mlm 's is that the system is inherently unsustainable . 
  the math can work out , but it 's incredibly easy for you to reach a saturation point where even if you make some commisions , people simply will not buy the product and you can very easily be permanently losing money . 
  it 's very difficult to estimate what that saturation point is in foresight , and if you are competing with other people in the same area it becomes self destructive . 
  the site is geekhack , which he refers for geekwhack because i assume he thinks that it is an insult of some sort ? 
  anyway , geekhack is a leopard community like this one , but ripster fell out of favour with some in that community and formed this community here . 
  to say that one side was the `` bad guy '' is just biasing history at this point . 
  nowadays you tend to have both ripster , anti-ripster and meta-circlejerks . 
  somewhat misleading title , `` modders fit gamecube portable into atari lynx case '' would be more appropriate . 
  i wonder how the size compares to the smappest gcp that i know , that being the [ gamecube fusion ] ( http://i.imgur.com/f68sgtf.jpg ) [ micro v2 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oy0nwa2.jpg ) which came out in 2011 . 
  [ here 's the entire worklog ] ( http://forums.modretro.com/viewtopic.php?f=36&amp;t=7829&amp;sid=f1f3018097c251656da9a082d0d94f08 ) if you want , actual progress starts around page 5 . 
  better yet , `` to prevent mass terrorism do you consider some surveillance a good idea ? 
  interestingly , the growth difference for / r/nintendo and / r/smashbros wasnt very large until quite recently , [ with a big jump then only slightly higher growth ] ( http://puu.sh/9ezzr/38bb92babc.png ) occurred . 
  a second interesting observation is that our rank is [ one of the only ones ] ( http://puu.sh/9ezkb/8dda74c1cb.png ) that is increasing compared to other `` esports '' . 
  unreal is a well-received game among the core-fps community , this article seems to point out that the game also deserves to be remembered as a game from the `` general core '' community at large . 
  while most `` general core '' people will have probably at least heard of unreal or unreal tournament , they would mostly see it as `` one of those games that came some time after quake '' . 
  you can always try to divide the continuum into `` industry shifting '' games , but this essentially suffers from the [ coastline paradox ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coastline_paradox ) , as you could also argue that each game , or even each segment of each game `` shifts the industry '' . 
  of course i am blanket generalising here , but that is what i think the general consensus would seem to be from the general community , and is the group the article is pointing towards . 
  the no nonsense solution is to simply use a [ cubehelix ] ( http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/~dag/cubehelix/cubetry.html ) colour palette . 
  or better yet , the not-bullshit headline : `` security researches create an nsa-like spy kit from leaks '' . 
  game capture quality will always be bad unless you have top equipment , so the actual basis for any gdq layout becomes `` how do we get the least amount of screen space for the game , and the most amount from the cams ? '', 
  the layout also needs to be able to be easily modified but remain consistent , with multicam , race capture or controller cam set-ups . 
  i 've never seen the point of overlaying logos on top of the content , it 's obstructing and distracting and should be somewhere on the outside . 
  getting the community involved is important , so social and branding links should again lay prominent and outside the capture footage . 
  was n't he also the one doing the impressively poor commentary on that smash 4 demo last year ? 
  i mean maybe that means he 's since taken an interest in properly understanding smash , and that 's cool too . 
  if 7 sharp is n't an example of old media being out of touch with millennials i do n't know what is . 
  as for me , it 's the same deal . 
  while i do n't watch tv much , and it 's just a background thing it 's always one until 7 , three after 7 . 
  three is better at the `` long form '' stories , which is what you tend to get after 7 . 
  they are the gpu of tas , taking all that frame game and create the tricks necessary to get them into real time . 
  fair enough , though i wonder who was doing it then . 
  it 's a webm . 
  gifs do n't load that fast or play that fast . 
  if you right click and view the video , the format is . webm , so it is a webm . 
  4chan and any community i have visited that has adopted webm en masse collectively refers to it as webm . 
  in fact it 's basically wrong to call it html5 video , that 's like collectively calling gifs and pngs `` html images '' . 
  if you really want to be pedantic , you could say that it is a vp8 encoded file , but we typically stick to the container level when referring to file formats , ie `` mp3 '' `` ogg '' `` mp4 '' . 
  in fact almost the only time we avoid the container level is when the format is its own container , ie `` jpeg '' `` png '' `` gif '' . 
  `` html5 video '' flies in the face of the legitimately consistent naming format for different forms of media . 
  haha , sorry for ranting , i am just a [ connoisseur ] ( http://xkcd.com/915/ ) of media encoding . 
  to all , remember that you are supposed to downvote irrelevant posts , not posts you do n't like . 
  grammar is not a rule , it is an observation of the means by which people convey language . 
  to say grammar is a rule would be like to say that `` people can move at 2m/s and accelerate at 0.5 m/s/s , anything else is wrong '' . 
  by extension you should also know that those grammatical `` rules '' are not rules at all , and are at best generalised observations of contemporary english . 
  the `` rules '' apply only to your opinion of grammar . 
  who dictates grammar ? 
  people using language . 
  who is using language ? 
  if any group uses those `` conventions '' without distinction , then the convention is without distinction . 
  one could argue that the worst thing that happened to the english language was people criticising other 's use of language . 
  your example statement makes perfect sense to me , so i do not see your point . 
  you are attempting to skew the topic in your favour with the slippery slope fallacy , assuming that if people make one lack of distinction , we will end up with no distinction at all , and this notion makes no sense . 
  were you able to understand op 's point without issue ? 
  as far as i can tell , most people here were able to understand op 's point without batting an eye . 
  when people do not understand op , they can point it out . 
  but to say that `` you used poor grammar '' while fully understanding the message is at best saying `` you are not following the conventions i stick to '' . 
  are you a linguist ? 
  i did n't realise you had the authority to say what is `` absolute '' english . 
  if you are not , can you source a paper by a linguist which shows that this point is absolute ? 
  `` most of us '' as in who ? 
  as far as i know , different locales , people and communities all use different forms of english . 
  to say that `` correct english '' is `` the english the majority of people use the majority of the time '' leaves out a significant section of the english language . 
  are you going to claim that the majority in the remaining time and the remaining people most of the time are using `` incorrect english '' ? 
  as a fact that is at best wrong , as an opinion i wo n't blame you . 
  considering i 'm too lazy to go out and source a paper to actually prove my point , i mean i guess he could be . 
  what about johns ?
