  plenty of tablets have large , high quality screens that benefit from every bit of extra streaming bandwidth . 
  there are an uncountable number of `` hi-fi '' portable headphones and iems that together with a tablet or laptop deliver a theatrical experience on the go . 
  to be able to use this anywhere , any time is an * expectation * , not an `` oh would n't that be nice '' . 
  and that 's just the tip of the iceberg . 
  i want to be able to bring a 2017 , compact vr headset around with me , be able to plug it into my smart device and play photorealistic virtual reality or augmented reality experiences on the go . 
  how would you do it ? 
  through ultra high resolution lighting and texture streaming . 
  now the bandwidth requirements for that are absurdly large , but that is just one of many possible ultra-high bandwidth scenarios for telcos , rather than any sort of near-future expectation on my part . 
  increasing the density of towers increases the potential bandwidth , if i am not mistaken . 
  hence why thee are more towers in central auckland than outer auckland . 
  i meant a 2017 hmd , because by then they should be small enough to carry around . 
  photorealism is a different story , and it needs to be 96fps for vr either way . 
  2017 is kind of a best case scenario , we would probably be looking more towards 2020 for that sort of stuff , if you live in south korea or something . 
  that said , we are [ getting pretty good ] ( http://i.imgur.com/b2ry2k1.jpg ) at [ 2d shaders ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kousyzu.gif ) . 
  hopefully they improve the shading in the final version . 
  to be fair the 280 is not too far off the 280x , and the price/performance on them is amazing . 
  they do n't all seem to be up yet , but as far as i know they were all recovered . 
  unfortunately 20nm has turned out to be a brick wall of sorts , and 14nm a concrete wall . 
  ssds can escape with 3d nand stacking , but cpus and gpus are close to the limits of theoretical performance for now . 
  i expect that if nothing big changes in a few years , people will start jumping on fpgas . 
  well the commentators can always say `` nearly one thousand '' . 
  not really sure what the point would be for gc or wii though , as this would barely be better than component cables . 
  unless your tv does n't have component in . 
  crts will still be used for some tournaments because of screen latency , so in reality you probably want a component cable mod , which would deliver near equivalent quality to hdmi anyway . 
  component in is n't exclusive to crts , in fact component became popular after crts started getting phased out . 
  in fact it would probably be cheaper to buy a component  hdmi converter , you find them regularly on ebay for $ 1 . 
  if you 're concerned about lag , you would be using a crt anyway , and the situation is moot . 
  considering all the random acts of yuri in psycho-pass , i have my expectations high . 
  i 'm starting to think the smash and dragonball z universes are on a collision course towards 20xx . 
  grand finals will need 40 episodes to commentate 5 minute games . 
  i 've noticed kyoani doing it sometimes in their most recent works . 
  just like lens flare , creating artifacts can be visually stimulating . 
  personally i think it 's overdone here , and in general i think adding artifacts is a mark of poor visual design but hey . 
  i 'm certainly on board , having a satellaview segment next agdq would be awesome , and if not all runs can be optimized in time it could be split between next year 's agdq and sgdq . 
  jojo is hardly obscure , you 're probably just experiencing the [ recency illusion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recency_illusion ) ( after you learn about something , it seems to show up everywhere ) . 
  while i doubt this patent was in response to what amazon is doing with their phone , it could be interesting if their next hand-held forgoes `` 3d '' in favor of a refined parallax effect . 
  as long as the law system is correctly checked and balanced , having a watson-style ai judge could actually be extremely beneficial . 
  speech is already transcribed by hand , and the ai could make both broad and optimal decisions during court proceedings . 
  it 's not even hard to get gamecube-level visual fidelity on smartphones nowadays anyway . 
  this is more of a testament to the dolphin development crew who were able to optimise the emulator enough to run . 
  there 's nothing saying that the robot has to walk untethered ; you could connect it to the grid , giving it a smaller area of movement but also making it lighter , semi-evangelion style . 
  seriously , i keep holding on , thinking there is a solid reason m2k and armada continue to stick with emp , but now i can really only think that they got duped . 
  can anyone see a silver lining to this sponsorship at this point ? 
  never going to happen while the us still uses [ first past the post ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7twhjfhiyo ) and [ gerrymandering ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mky11ujb9ay ) . 
  i wonder why they did n't show this during cult studies at a christian high school . 
  too close to home ? 
  jesters pies is the only pie specific place i can think of , but they 're not even very good . 
  the pies at wild bean cafe are arguably the best `` chain '' pies . 
  you could potentially keep track of upvotes over time , but vote fuzzing would become an issue . 
  the first thing you 'll want to do is rewire the house , as everyoneisinsane said . 
  as for actual routers , are you certain you will never get fiber ? 
  if not , [ just get an asus/tp-link router with dd-wrt and be done with it ] ( http://pricespy.co.nz/category.php?k=386#rparams=m=s178135250 ) . 
  you also want a high quality switch/filter to prevent any additional noise . 
  you might want to be future proof and get a router with gigabit throughput ( which surprisingly few actually can , despite advertising gigabit ) . 
  i would also stick to tp-link and asus brands . 
  scrub through this [ amazon listing ] ( http://tinyurl.com/pa2wtzm, 
  ) and find the routers which advertise `` 1000m '' or `` gigabit '' * wan to lan throughput * , then cross check the router [ here ] ( http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/lanwan/router-charts/bar ) . 
  expect to pay in the $ 200-450 range , but you get what you pay for . 
  better than wild bean ? 
  i might have to give them a try . 
  wild bean/bp actually use unbranded dad 's pies . 
  spot on . 
  they would n't keep making articles if they were n't getting pageviews . 
  the only reason to even consider destructoid is because of max scoville at this point , and you can just keep yourself to the youtube channel . 
  in other words , you can work your way up inside or outside the system , whatever you are comfortable with really . 
  what i like about uni is that you can generally also learn some hobbyist interests alongside your career interest . 
  from what i heard , software engineers working at spacex do actually have it pretty rough , but that 's definitely one of those rare cases of concentrated hard work being worth it . 
  bots are cool !, 
  giveaways are cool !, 
  op is cool !, 
  based on the 295x description , i would imagine that it is simply tweaked from the 290x to have better cooling , though they could have improved voltage characteristics as well . 
  possibly something more devils canyon esque . 
  interesting , has there been any news on this method since ? 
  well the mechanics of gx really were pretty much perfect . 
  if they were to make a new game it would be to smooth out the learning curve with a new campaign , add some new tracks and bump it to 1080p , maybe adding some style . 
  that would be more than they changed with wind waker hd , so they do n't really have much of an excuse . 
  the engine is essentially exactly the same . 
  the only notable things are either surface elements like rope animations , shaders , or fast roll from standing ( which is good only for clipping through walls , because they did n't overhaul the collision to account for it ) . 
  apart from those and storage being patched , little to nothing has been changed engine wise . 
  if texture/shader updates are considered an engine change , then apparently sweetfx makes a new game every few weeks . 
  trimming down the triforce hunt * is * a change , but that would just be like shortening the harder levels of gx , hardly an `` effort '' change . 
  my point was n't that nintendo did n't make changes to wwhd , it was that if they are okay with simply graphical and design tweaks on an existing game , they do n't really have a reason to `` not '' make another f-zero . 
  if the us congress was on fire , it would n't be able to pass the `` pour water on congress '' bill . 
  this is an example of a bad government that can not create , change , add or reduce complexity to legislation in any reasonable amount of time . 
  much like how a business wants to keep its money management adaptable , new zealand regulation and legislation should be able to be changed , added to , taken from or distilled in as fair and swift a fashion as possible . 
  we will obviously always have `` big topic '' laws like capital gains tax , gay marriage and the like , but there are a lot of small laws that seem like obvious improvements to our government/societal function , but take longer to be processed because they are not significant changes . 
  the productivity commission here is proposing changes to help us perform better , and help our legislative body `` not be a congress '' . 
  actually it 's common practice to cover the mouth when you are sick or when many people in an area are sick during the winter . 
  in many cases it can even be seen as a [ fashion accessory ] ( http://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/d6/dc/0c/d6dc0c25867c535063cd1dfb695f7b67.jpg ) . 
  [ reminds me of nichijou . 
  when i used to deliver mail as a kid , i never delivered to letterboxes which had the sign `` posted mail only '' . 
  apparently political/council/public service mail is not `` junk mail '' . 
  if you still get political mail when that is on your letterbox , you probably have the right to complain . 
  iirc some / r/anime survey last year showed that 1/3 of all / r/anime users also frequent / a / . 
  as soon as you leave default subreddits , the difference in userbase between 4chan and reddit swiftly diminishes . 
  there 's nothing wrong with rooting for competition . 
  even if you are a diehard for intel/nvidia , supporting amd will force intel/nvidia to compete , giving everyone better products in the process . 
  actually amd stock is a well-oiled pump-and-dump machine . 
  if you look at the past 2 years , it has been a fairly constant rise until quarterly earnings , then a 20 % drop , rinse and repeat . 
  because it is an unusual and provocative `` experiment '' that can get romanticized once it leaves the sciences and enters the humanities .
