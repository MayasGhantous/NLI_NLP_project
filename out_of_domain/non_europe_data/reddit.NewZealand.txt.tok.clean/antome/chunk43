  it also involves cats , one of the few animals people tend to universally empathize . 
  without a plan to return to stable income if it all goes south , i would wait a little . 
  wait until you accumulate some decent buffer savings , that you can put in a decent savings account/index fund , so that if you jump in and it does n't work out , you can get yourself back on your feet without ending up homeless . 
  plus if smash is a continually growing phenomenon , you wo n't be missing out if you build up a few months living costs . 
  interesting that they can manage 6tb without any special tricks . 
  it seems like hdds still have quite a few more years left in them , that is if ssds can ever surpass them in price/gb . 
  nearly all anime reuse a set of ~ 10-20 tracks over a season , so the seams of the sound design would become very apparrent very quickly . 
  of course , with no budget for voice acting you could pour it into good sound design . 
  nevertheless , i have always wondered if a studio would be willing to air an entire shonen without any dialogue . 
  considering most shonen are adaptions it 's not likely , but there 's always hope . 
  that said , nestle is just on an entirely different level of fuckery . 
  cadbury looks like social activists by comparison . 
  if labour has another term of infighting , i legitimately would n't be surprised if greens usurp the left `` throne '' . 
  considering the process or remuxiung another audio track into an existing video stream requires very little processing , it could actually be entirely possible for them to implement that . 
  it could also give rise to twitch `` commentators '' who simply watch and commentate other esports streams for a living . . 
  i would assume the point of restreaming is that the original caster gets all of the ad revenue , so it does n't seem like that big of an issue . 
  they can probably also combine the viewership counts from restreams into the real thing , though that could lead to abuse of viewercounts . 
  which is why they are not designing many large payload devices . 
  they are designing a single , simpler rocket , which once complete can be manufactured rapidly . 
  the initial investment is orders of magnitude less , and the return is much sooner . 
  the sense of taste is reduced in space , but not entirely . 
  hence they create highly-flavored foods for the astronauts . 
  in that sense , anything that does n't have `` extra flavor '' wo n't taste like much at all . 
  mind you , 4ms is nearly a quarter of the period of a 60hz frame . 
  not dramatic , but most `` gaming '' monitors are under 5ms at this stage . 
  in fact , very few countries outside of america consistently use tipping . 
  many countries outright disallow it , either in law or in culture . 
  the whole manga is great , but the last couple of story arcs have been super tangential . 
  it seems like the author is starting to run out of tropes to play with . 
  the problem is that it 's bad news either way . 
  give then one year and they will never actually deliver any of their promises . 
  give them 8 years and one bad government would lay waste to a country . 
  i think the main problem people encounter when searching for cs jobs is that they seem to have this idea that cs is some sort of closed system . 
  they approach a job as though it is a competition between them and seven other people to get a bog standard position in a bog standard company . 
  in reality it 's almost criminally easy to spend 3 months building up a portfolio of open-source project contributions which demonstrates that you can in fact engineer software . 
  and in the process of making that portfolio you only get better at grasping large scale projects . 
  granted , there are software companies which treat software development jobs like a competition for the most `` industry experience '' and `` interview skills '' . 
  you probably dont want to apply to those companies . 
  i always wish that amd did a limited run of a processor that simply had a large die size , and crammed in as much of their existing cores as possible . 
  video encoding scales beautifully with raw die size and core count , which allows the likes of the fx-8350 to perform at the same level as low end i7 's in that area . 
  and you still see remnants of that in their low-end cores , which compete healthily with i3s and i5s in various x264/x265 scenarios . 
  i say this particularly because i see cpus as having already reached a functional limit for me outside of video encoding . 
  games are hardly , if at all pushing cpus harder , whether that is because of the new consoles , or intel 's low-power trajectory , or both . 
  so for me one of the few applications of large-die-size cpus is video encoding , which in effect is cramming as much processing power as possible into processing the most efficient image possible . 
  the first season is absolutely phenomenal , but i would n't recommend watching the second season unless you were more interested in the comedy than the plot . 
  the story almost `` ends '' after the first season and they just start moving in tangents like your usual unending show . 
  if you liked the flurry of references , i would also recommend [ nyaruko-san ] ( http://myanimelist.net/anime/11785/haiyore!_nyaruko-san ) , a lovecraftian comedy that almost exclusively parodies other media . 
  the screen is manufactured with the touch module in tact , so it 's really not weird at all . 
  they are just picking them straight off the line , rather than creating a whole new manufacturing process just for a few thousand dev kits . 
  at the new year of 2012 i believe , they interviewed him in a `` year in review '' segment ( i thought he said `` olsen '' but i would n't know ) . 
  i think the best way to think about it is that he both made an amusingly dumb response , but that he is also not actually dumb . 
  the entire survey is prefaced with `` if an election were held today '' . 
  the problem is that the only real `` studied '' map design is quake map design ( and by extension ut , cs , tf2 , cod ) . 
  the quake map has been around and been played for two decades at this point , so long that you can probably find entire books , let alone dozens of forums , youtube channels and the like dedicated to the design of these maps . 
  it is only very recently with the current uptick in `` big '' maps with arma3 , dayz , planetside 2 and battlefield 3/4 that people are really beginning to study and critique map design outside of the classics ( kharkand etc ) . 
  as a result people sort of just transfer their knowledge of quake maps onto big maps and it does n't work out . 
  it 's like trying to critique feature films using the study of melodramatic silent films . 
  while the surface has `` drag 'n drop '' elements , and the scripting system is not as fully-featured as other engines , there have been a number of successful game-maker games . 
  hotline-miami and hyper-light drifter to name a couple . 
  i finally figured it out , he 's talking about the shape of the red , green and blue blocks . 
  pretty sure it 's not supposed to be an s at all . 
  `` what is really exciting is to be able to deliver latencies close to 1us for small block random reads '', 
  sounds like they found a way to potentially reduce the reliance on caches , and possibly even remove the need for esram . 
  if it works out , this could give quite the boost for dedicated-hardware like future-gen consoles , and possibly pcs if they incorporate some new memory controller setup . 
  while `` radeon '' is at least more creative than a single character prefix to every product you make , they could definitely have at least differentiated the suffix . 
  let 's be honest though , there 's no way they did n't think of that . 
  which means that this was intended to `` cash in '' on their new brand recognition . 
  smash is actually very forgiving towards a pro caster/new caster duo !, 
  take dylan sprouse for example , who commented part of a recent tournament . 
  effectively the `` new caster '' can play the role of the first-time viewer , getting excited and going `` what , how , why did he do that ? '', 
  in his place . 
  wobbles took m2k to game 5 without wobbling , against peach . 
  incredible set . 
  you sure morphed that word . 
  to be fair , most of these games were developed in tandem with some other studio . 
  turtle rock worked on l4d/l4d2 , hidden path entertainment worked on csgo , and much of alien swarm 's development occurred outside of valve ; the staff were hired in before they finished the game . 
  the vast majority of valve 's `` development '' workload has essentially been content updates , not to say this is a bad thing . 
  does the benefits of the broadcasting commission 's funding outweigh the costs ? 
  i would say that both games and broadcasting should get equal funding , however high or low that level of funding is . 
  if the government is funding development , then what stops the game from being released free of charge ? 
  perhaps an html5 game . 
  the o and w need to have curlier edges or something , it 's too difficult to make out what the word is if you do n't know what you 're looking for . 
  for those confused , either the users or a mod seems to have removed comments challenging the bias in this subreddit . 
  [ the previous thread on this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/games/comments/2e92cb/delorean_using_speculation_to_enable_lowlatency/ ) , which did not mention microsoft in the title was far more optimistic . 
  i think the anime industry naturally evolves creatively , the problem is more that everyone will follow a creative trend , and that trend may only change over the course of a few years ( ie shonen moe circa < 2007 , moegirls circa 2009 , moeguys circa 2012 + ), 
  that is actually quite an interesting structure to the documentary . 
  they present the nurture perspective , then nature , then resolve it with `` it 's both '' . 
  maybe i 've watched too much vice , but it 's refreshing to see a documentary which is n't agenda-driven . 
  it 's a capture card thing . 
  any editing software in existence worth its salt allows for any frame-rate or resolution . 
  except for possibly [ most.moe ] ( http://most.moe/ ), 
  the easy solution is just to disable touch around the edges of the screen . 
  similarly , adjust the ui so that no buttons are directly along the sides of the screen . 
  google says the elgato hd can do 720p60 , while the `` elgato hd60 '' can do 1080p60 . 
  except they have , you just require firefox nightly . 
  they are taking their time on a full release to make sure there are no issues . 
  in about : config , make sure ** media.mediasource.enabled ** is set to true , and add a new boolean ** media.mediasource.ignore _ codecs ** , and set this to true . 
  this has been in the nightly mailing list for weeks . 
  more specifically , they think 3ds sales have n't `` slowed down '' enough in the west to warrant a new device yet . 
  while he certainly is n't an `` old man '' voice , somehow he just seems perfect for the role .
