  if you give a thousand people in developing countries a thousand dollars , will some of them blow it on drugs ? 
  guaranteed . 
  does n't change the fact that it would change more lives for the better than $ 1,000,000 spent nearly any other way ( without orchestrating mass vaccinations or something like bill gates ) . 
  will we have to prepare wrester 's chat as poverty chat in advance ? 
  while i do n't want every anime becoming it , it is a shame that we do n't see more squigglevision in animation . 
  [ onion skin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/onion_skinning ) is the use of several frames translucently layered on top of each other . 
  [ squigglevision ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/squigglevision ) has been used on several occasions for professional cartoons , which is the act of drawing and looping a few similar frames to add an extra sense of movement in the scene . 
  imo squigglevision definitely has its place in animation , i just would n't want too many shows using it , and never outside shorts . 
  have heard that the game has interesting narrative and aesthetic , though unless you are talking about the hatching in the background , sadly i ca n't quite see any squigglevision under the video compression . 
  seems very strange that they only showcase 360 degree motion on the face , as they say themselves `` we used 3d models for the body '' . 
  the face is n't the only part that has problems in cg . 
  from 20ms latency to 1ms latency actually seems like a pretty big deal . 
  this is in fact actually done in the source engine , which makes it all the weirder that it 's not something implemented into the server . 
  source/quake engine has something called a pvs or `` potentially visible set '' , which is basically a long list of `` can you see these objects ? '', 
  that the game reads from any position on the map . 
  this is harder to implement on dynamic objects ( players ) , but the fundamental concept very much could be implemented , and enacted server-side just for players . 
  actually this is a well known problem with a well known solution , which is even easier when just accounting for players . 
  you make a list of ( roughly ) all possible player positions ( ie use your bot-pathfinding map ) , and for each position make a list of `` are these other positions visible ? '' . 
  by being smart with divisions and subdivisions of possible space , this would require very little additional memory and processing , as it is just reading from a list . 
  out of curiosity , which countries in general have the most `` comfortable '' animation industries ? 
  you might want to read the manga then ( the first two seasons are the manga ad-verbatim , so you could skip those chapters ) . 
  the arc is much more thoroughly developed , and has a pretty satisfying ending which also commentates on those points . 
   `` in order to comply with certain requests from members of the utd creative team , and to deliver an unhindered product to our backers , cia is hereby removing itself from the utd project '', 
  it does n't seem to make a lot of sense that the animation studios would request a change in production team , moreso that the request was granted . 
  k\u014dji morimoto has plenty of experience in the industry , so i 'm not concerned over the new production . 
  it just seems so . . arbitrary . 
  studio gohands ( seitokai yakuindomo * ), 
  websites often unintentionally converge towards this mind you . 
  most websites do have 2-5 links at the top of the page , and if there need to be more they are shifted into drop-down lists . 
  imgur also significantly lowers image quality , so i would recommend uploading to minus or mega later , if nothing else than archival 's sake . 
  so check this out !, 
  `` king country '' was really just a colonial misinterpretation of `` there be dragons '', 
  planes accelerate when launching , and decelerate when landing . 
  sitting backwards only switches those two events around , which i seriously doubt would be `` disorientating '' . 
  if anything , it would be less disorientating as sudden braking would have less effect ( because you are sitting backwards ) . 
  [ cubehelix ] ( http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/~dag/cubehelix/cubetry.html ) is a very straightforward way to generate a completely colourblind-proof palette . 
  the problem isnt on kyoani 's side though , for once . 
  only ~ 6 episodes worth of content is left to adapt , we 're essentially waiting on the author to write more novels . 
  it would n't necessarily be a bad idea to animate each novel as a film when it comes out , though . 
  cross-promotion and all that . 
  worth it , it 's particularly interesting when you pay more attention to the the themes and characters . 
  the `` thorns of youth '' , satoshi 's mild swings into sociopathy and oreki 's easing into everyday society . 
  considering the entire love live cast was built and fine-tuned by otaku magazine subscriber opinions , you could argue love live is the ultimate form of `` giving them what they want '' , and it shows . 
  surely you ca n't forget the illustrious [ satoshi ? 
  to be fair , at 1080p and under the x265 encoder is the same if not worse performing than x264 . 
  this is in part because x264 has been so heavily optimized over the years , as on paper h. 265 should beat it handily . 
  nevertheless , the benefits of h. 265 are still a year or two away yet , and it may never outperform x264 < 1080p video , much like state-of-the-art h. 262 encoders can sometimes beat out x264 on < 480p . 
  iirc , google now spends less computing time on h. 264 video than vp9 ( ie uses a faster x264 preset ) , which in effect leads to slightly better vp9 videos at low ( ie youtube ) bitrates . 
  google is essentially hedging their bets here , as even if vp9 is between h. 264 and h. 265 on paper , the x264 encoder is so heavily optimized that it still outperforms pretty much everything in < 1080p cases , and competes well with x265 and co. at 1080p . 
  yup , youtube is clearly using faster presets for x264 , and is hedging its bets on vp9 , which on paper is also pretty close to h. 265 .

  not sure if joking , but, 
  [ ] ( #kininarimasu ) [ ] ( #wow - really ) [ ] ( #ehehehe ) [ ] ( #suave ) [ ] ( #you - bore-me ), 
  three of the four [ main characters of hyouka ] ( http://myanimelist.net/anime/12189/hyouka/characters ) have multiple comment emotes , yet the most emotive of the characters , [ satoshi fukube ] ( http://myanimelist.net/character/55135/satoshi_fukube ) , does not have any . 
  one face you could probably use might be [ this one . 
  [ at this point the contest is basically a salt farm ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vxhhuym.jpg ) . 
  i think we have plenty room for [ best faces guy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dkpmusy.jpg ), 
  there is a severe lack of [ satoshi ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vxhhuym.jpg ) [ fukube ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dkpmusy.jpg ) emotes , we ca n't leave the [ ] ( #kininarimasu ) remaining [ ] ( #ehehehe ) cast [ ] ( #suave ) hanging !, 
  on / r/anime , and in various other contexts and scenarios , * cgi * is commonly used to refer to the use of complex computer - * generated * 3d-models , wheras the use of computers to create blurring , panning and colour grading is generally referred to as * post production * . 
  the point being , that within the realms of what is reasonable , no cgi was used in the film . 
  you might think the definition is arbitrary , but it does come from consensus . 
  it is unreasonable to expect the production team to manually colour , blur , cut and pan every cel in the film , when there is zero aesthetic benefit to do so . 
  how is that literacy defined , though ? 
  while the alphabet , hiragana and katakana are fairly small and share some characteristics , kanji is an entirely different beast , and it seems that [ no more than 10 % of the population is literate in `` official '' kanji ] ( http://www.scmp.com/article/575672/japanese-forgetting-how-write-traditional-characters ) , let alone unofficial . 
  this is true , at high enough bitrates the difference in quality can become very marginal . 
  that said , if one codec * does * appear better at the same rate , that means you can reduce the file size without any noticeable drop in quality . 
  even an average 10 % performance improvement across 720p + videos would lead to significant space savings , or be the difference between being able to watch hd or not when streaming . 
  the problem is that x265 isnt * generally better * , for < 1080p content , so there is n't a whole lot of purpose in using it for now . 
  the mod marketplace * is * the microtransactions , and as along as it 's a level playing field i would argue that is n't a bad thing . 
  people can get paid for their oc , and epic gets a cut to maintain the game . 
  on the flipside , i would imagine we would see a large upswing in open source hardware contributions , ala [ open source ecology ] ( http://opensourceecology.org ), 
  if you tell that to `` le spooky skeleton '' , he 'll get mad and spoop you !, 
  there is n't much `` surrealist '' ascii art . 
  `` scary '' images are usually a joke . 
  there are `` chaotic and surreal '' subreddits however , such as / r/fifthworldproblems - \u7b2c\u4e94\u4e16\u754c\u306e\u554f\u984c, 
  there is also / r/spacedicks - \u5b87\u5b99\u3061\u3093\u3053 - nsf ** l ** - do n't go there !, 
  no problem , just run a [ fisheye ] ( http://strlen.com/gfxengine/fisheyequake/compare.html ) mod !, 
  google translate is the best for everything . 
  have fun on reddit !, 
  the reddit system reduces spamming and `` vote brigading '' , but it can lead to false positives such as this, 
  for such a grounded sol mystery , kyoani sure managed the goofiest faces . 
  that is only for some indigenous tribes , though . 
  many tribes throughout the world have `` unconventional '' perspectives . 
  for example , [ the babylonians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/babylonian_numerals ) used, 
  graham 's number is an `` upper bound '' for the solution to the problem . 
  many questions in mathematics do not have an exact answer , because finding that answer would be incredibly challenging and time consuming . 
  instead , it 's often easier to `` prove '' that the answer can not be any higher or lower than a certain amount ; these are your `` bounds '' . 
  after all , it 's better to have * some * answer other than `` between minus infinity and positive infinity '' . 
  graham 's number is one such upper bound , though since then much smaller upper bounds have been found , hence the term `` weak upper bound '' . 
  tangentially related , but i was always confused about the notion of `` too long to fit in the universe '' . 
  if entropy is always increasing , is there really any limit to the amount of information the universe could contain ? 
  not to mention national 's pr really has made them into the `` john key party '' . 
  i think the power vacuum will be rather impressive should he choose to retire . 
  but even the `` give each atom one bit '' idea is colossally contrived . 
  there are easily more than several bits of information which could be stored in a static atom ( mass , charge ... ) not to mention the massive storage potential using the angular momentum of the atom . 
  hell you could very well go even further , and store information in the orbital angular momentum of subatomic particles .
