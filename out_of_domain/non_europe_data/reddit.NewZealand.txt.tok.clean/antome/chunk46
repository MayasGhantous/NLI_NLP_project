  there are so many ways to store entropy in tiny configurations , across universal scales , that the notion of `` maximum information '' seems incredibly silly to me . 
  again that assumes a static configuration though . 
  assuming time is continuous , or at least close to it , every particle can have effectively infinite bits of storage through temporal properties . 
  you have a near infinitesimal number of near infinite particles , each with near if not infinite individual storage potential .

  for those confused , opera now uses the same rendering-engine as chrome . 
  chrome recently branched their engine from webkit ( which safari/ios uses ) to create `` blink '' . 
  opera is awesome , better performance is awesome , and being able to siphon chrome extensions is awesome too . 
  what are the various terms you should use when searching on ebay for hall effect keyboards like this ? 
  kind of interested now . 
  the problem is that `` invented here '' is a reversal on `` not invented here '' ( fear of using external products because they are external ) . 
  both terms are pretty ambiguous . 
  the dotted line is perfect use , the coloured line is `` typical use '' . 
  condoms are still one of the best if you put them on correctly every time , and use it every time . 
  agreed , particularly considering the rgb values are in fact brown/gold and light blue . 
  you also have to remember that increasing the accuracy of the clocks also increases the precision of measuring relativistic changes . 
  even small changes in acceleration can demonstrate relativistic effects with these sorts of clocks , which is really cool . 
  relativity essentially states that space and time are the same thing . 
  what this means is that when you use more space ( accelerate ) , you use less time ( time slows down ) . 
  so simply by accelerating one of these clocks a little bit , while not accelerating the other clock , the clocks will desynchronise . 
  gravity is also acceleration , towards the centre of the earth . 
  [ earth has some variance in gravity ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/geoids_sm.jpg ) , meaning that if you place these clocks in two different places , they will also desynchronise .

  that 's exactly why they are pushing this . 
  because amd/intel wont be allowed to do gpu physx , it will always run faster on a system with an nvidia gpu . 
  they 'll probably yell and kick if you try and optimise for cpu . 
  making it free increases the chances that a critical mass of games choose physx over custom/other implementations , giving nvidia a `` free edge '' over the competition . 
  would you know what to look out for on ebay , when looking for these hall-effect keyboards ? 
  i ca n't seem to find any . 
  caffeine has its own fair share of problems . 
  everything in moderation . 
  that 's often in part because of old/bad compression methodologies though . 
  nowadays with state-of-the-art video compression you can get very good quality at 4gb for say , 4 hours of video . 
  do n't know how cr 's payment model works , but the one for youtube is godawful . 
  so entirely under speculation i would imagine that cr pays more . 
  iirc valve mentioned somewhere that source film maker actually used an early variant of the source 2 engine , explaining in part their `` productivity improvement '' focus . 
  if it 's anything like 3d printing , you will probably face very low signal-to-noise . 
  for every legitimate manufacturer/start-up , there are two companies who put on a fa\u00e7ade of legitimacy , but have no product/plan . 
  is that why hamilton declared independence from the rest of new zealand ? 
  those gardens are pretty top-notch . 
  after reading through the manga so far , i sadly doubt there 's enough content for another two-cour season . 
  they could easily make it one-cour however , or write more content in . 
  80 % of the memes in this stem from montage video parodies . 
  mlg , conspiracies , text-to-speech , dubstep , weed , air-horns , doritos/dew , snoop dog , gunshots/explosions/cod , carl sagan , beethoven , arbitrary text on the screen and the like . 
  arguing whether any show is `` best anime of all time '' is inherently pointless . 
  nevertheless i think there is a common consensus , that both the style and substance of ping pong has never really been done before , and it 's * really good * . 
  in that case it 's a memory leak . 
  you can file a bug report and it would probably be fixed for next version . 
  heavy drinking as a social issue should n't be disregarded , even if we appear to be `` healthier '' drinkers than other comparable nations . 
  nevertheless i can certainly understand bringing media focus towards `` more pressing '' issues like sugar/obesity . 
  [ look at anadyr on a map . 
  ] ( http://puu.sh/h3gir/824b638565.jpg ) the earth roughly [ rotates ] ( http://www.learner.org/jnorth/images/graphics/mclass/jr/day2/day_sol_eq21_revolvingearth.gif ) around the north and south poles , meaning it is roughly the same `` time of day '' for any vertical `` strip '' of land along earth 's surface . 
  as you can see , anadyr is perfectly in line with new zealand . 
  bags of marshmallows . 
  `` cartoonish '' motion is only part of the problem . 
  lighting in 2d animation is designed to be aesthetically pleasing , and is n't even remotely accurate . 
  because you have to draw each frame in traditional animation anyway , you might as well go the extra mile and make nice shadows . 
  if you look at stuff like guilty gear xrd which `` succesfully '' pulled off cg anime , when you read into the process you find that they put a boatload of effort into getting the exact right lighting for any situation . 
  secondly you have position and rotation . 
  when a camera pans across a character in an anime , it `` looks right '' , yet if you placed a 3d model of that character in the exact same position with the exact same lighting , it will still look weird . 
  even a still-posed , traditionally-animated character will `` rotate '' in a way that places aesthetics over realism . 
  even if you can perfectly replicate the 2d `` motion '' you want , you will encounter these problems . 
  the biggest piece of advice you will get for a board game cafe , is location . 
  all other factors aside , the business will live or die on being some place people would actually visit . 
  this is generally some place with a high concentration of students/youth , and/or a popular shopping centre . 
  whatever you do , do n't put the cafe away from where everyone else is `` because it 's cheaper '' or `` it 'll be more private '' . 
  once you have the getting-people-in thing down , you probably also want to think about striking a balance between attracting newcomers and regulars alike , whether that is through floor layout or whatever . 
  personally i found both satoshi and mayaka to be far more interesting than their counterparts . 
  satoshi is just so enigmatic yet strangely relatable , and mayaka is `` normal '' , but again in a relatable , interesting sense . 
  as much as i like `` sherlock '' characters , clever characters which mess up in realistic ways are probably # 1 . 
  just filesharing , so in effect just torrents . 
  also only torrents which copyright agencies are actually monitoring , and are agressive enough to want to actively prevent piracy on . 
  that more or less limits it to top torrents of top media released within the past 2 years or so . 
  basically , if you really , really want to torrent copyrighted stuff , do n't be stupid and you 'll be ok . 
  china 's gdp ppp is higher . 
  china could choose to not undervalue its currency at any time and surpass us gdp . 
  i have found that zenmate works as well in not better than hola in some cases . 
  the industry as a whole is hyper secretive , so exact names only really come to light when things get tragic ( in the case of a1 , suicide ) . 
  you are essentially describing tor . 
  hola , in some respects , functioned as a tor browser extension , just one that happened to not connect to any tor nodes , and forced everyone to be a node . 
  a bit off topic , but is anyone else frustrated that they took new zealand off of the nightly show 's map ? 
  we really do have a knack for being invisible it seems . 
  is it a [ bitruncated cubic honeycomb ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bitruncated_cubic_honeycomb ) ? 
  it does n't look like a [ weaire -- phelan structure ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/weaire\u2013phelan_structure ) , though that could be for simplicity 's sake . 
  that 's because they have a broad corpus of 3d object information contained in their heads , with which they can use to draw conclusions on the new , novel object . 
  if you supply a neural network with only 2d images of cubes , the conclusion it will probably draw is that cubes are squares with trapezoids attached . 
  looks like they simply did n't want to spend too much time on it , which makes sense . 
  would have been interesting to see how much better it would be though , if at all . 
  right and light ( though they can both mean `` good '' in some contexts ), 
  fright and flight ,, 
  ray and lay ,, 
  pray and play ,, 
  loads of challenging words , i 'd imagine !, 
  assuming they can get just the board , they could produce a cheaper cooling solution . 
  if the overclocking return is there , some manufacturer could also go nuts and add a phase-change cooler . 
  which is why bureaucracy implements laws , not politicians . 
  like it or not , democracy is about representing ideology . 
  requiring a skill-set is a technocracy . 
  would this mean that the universe has always been infinite in size , even immediately after , and before the big bang ?
