  i do n't see how the universe could `` transition '' from a finite to infinite size . 
  now i want to hear david hayter voice oreki for a hyouka dub . . 
  honestly , i 'd be okay if he even went as far as making them flat pixel art , game & watch style . 
  canada probably prints some of the largest volumes of plastic notes , so it 's probably cheaper . 
  it is estimated that you would need to add about 80 more jupiters to jupiter to become even remotely star-like , so ** 8 **** 000 ** % . 
  jupiter is really big , but stars are really , really really , ** really ** big . 
  by extension , i rarely see the trope of the `` tryhard and the lucky '' pulled off well . 
  it can become infuriating to see one character who puts in genuine/superficial effort fall short to someone with plot armour . 
  this is averted nicely though when characters which seem the most lucky and elusive , are still revealed to have put in unwieldy hours of practise at some point . 
  you just be jealous that [ genki is love ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lqixeji.png ) , [ genki is life ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ax03hfn.png ) . 
  while it is true that purple does n't exist , violet does exist , so it is certainly curious that the `` fake '' colour shares the same perceived range as a completely different colour . 
  the colours that we perceive range red-yellow-green-blue-violet . 
  even though we do n't have a `` violet cone '' in our eyes , we still perceive violet as a separate colour , and that happens to also be close to magenta/purple . 
  light , or electromagnetic radiation , actually has an enormous spectrum ; even without colour blindness , we only perceive a tiny part of it . 
  in particular , light `` below '' red is called infrared , then terahertz , microwave , radio . 
  `` above '' violet you have ultraviolet , x-ray , gamma ray . 
  svg stands for scalable vector graphics , meaning that you can scale it to be as large or as small as you want , and it will preserve all detail . 
  very complex svgs may be slower than a jpeg , but in general they are pretty fast . 
  while you ca n't create animations just yet , inkscape is a fantastic tool for creating and editing svgs . 
  imo in general web use cases , inkscape is also better than illustrator . 
  put simply , it allows you to have lossless animated and interactive imagery . 
  like flash , but without the jank . 
  you could argue that this could be achieved with javascript and canvas , though i think that this is an elegant way to bake some of the niceties of flash directly into html . 
  honestly , it looks like the biggest difference is in the number of light-sources displayed over a given distance , which will scale pretty much exactly with the gpu . 
  if you flip back and fourth , you will notice that almost all of the things `` missing '' in the ps4 version are light sources on buildings , some secondary shadows and such . 
  i think i 've figured it out . 
  you may notice that for 90 % of the video , the character 's faces and fronts are facing the audience . 
  5 % is entirely side-on . 
  it looks like the face especially , has a small set of 2-d `` poses '' , which they carefully move in-step with the camera , and ignore any problematic shading or skewing . 
  there are only a couple of shots where they even show anything but face-on/side-on , and even then it 's for less than a second . 
  when pausing during those parts , it looks kinda cruddy , but hell , it works . 
  for sure , but at least in the night/rain scenes , the `` night and day '' difference appears to come from the lighting count/distance . 
  21fps might be the strangest spec i 've seen in a while . 
  i can get 20 or 24fps , but 21 ? 
  did they think cutting a few fps would save some money somewhere ? 
  i tend to go by [ nz ] elephants , though i think communication actually is n't incredibly important . 
  ** the core strategy ** is to feed one person til they 're huge , they splitkill some people , then they feed someone else til they are huge and can eat one of the split halves . 
  as long as we follow that general rule , things should work out pretty well . 
  small tip , if you 're too big but getting chased by someone bigger , you can quickly shoot 7 blobs into a virus , shooting another virus in that direction . 
  i have heard that the gesture comes from medieval archers . 
  archers needed those fingers to shoot , and captured enemy archers would have them cut off . 
  so the gesture may have meant `` i can still shoot you !, 
  '' , and evolved into what we have today . 
  seems like the solution there would be to simply have a bot which automatically reverted edits which contained any passages from genesis . 
  or any other common vandalous edits for that matter . 
  terms are just semesters cut in half . 
  any time between terms is a holiday . 
  reasonably sure half-days are another way of saying ` school day ' . 
  took 50 tries , but they got to suzu hagimura in the end . 
  it would have probably been faster to start with a rundown of physical appearance and generic characteristics , though that might be less mysterious . 
  on the flipside , it could well be a power play . 
  they may have just enough spare cash to justify sponsoring them for at least one season , and then they could use it to break into the uk/europe . 
  shuffle the stars over a bit like the nordic flags , and it really is a nice flag . 
  to be fair , the bottom right looks badass . 
  in that case , would you know what the theoretical upper limit for the speed of light is ? 
  would other phenomena such as gravitational waves travel at this speed ? 
  the reason is vr . 
  if companies can manage to sell people on smartphones with ever higher resolutions , they can ramp up vr production sooner than competitors . 
  i sub to / r/games because it 's a quick and easy aggregator of gaming news and gamer sentiment . 
  though yes , i really feel bad for people who do n't know they can unsubscribe from / r/games . 
  after listening through his osts many a time , i just ca n't get over the effect he creates around [ 1 minute into this track . ] ( https://soundcloud.com/zenko_kill-la-kill/juuyoubutsu-hakkou-kyouchou-ga?in=zenko_kill-la-kill/sets/kill-la-kill-ost2 ) . 
  the string instruments , the string instruments acting like guitar strumming , actual guitar strumming , the precussion . . and then the wind and electrics kick in . 
  just stunning . 
  a number of the previous salty suites had huge crowds and huge noise/chants . 
  people tuned in here expecting an evolution of that , and instead got a small invitational . 
  reddit being reddit , popular opinion got taken to the extreme . 
  i honestly really loved a suggestion in a previous thread , which was to quite simply : make all macro abilities last/take twice as long and cost twice as much . 
  across the board , chrono/mules/injects only need to be performed half as often , but this pretty much achieves the same effect in terms of strategic use . 
  the only substantial meta change would be that there are an increase in the number of potential offensive and defensive timings , while each race is waiting for energy . 
  that in itself is also pretty cool , imo . 
  knock knock, 
  who 's there ? 
  foton who ? 
  foton overcharged me at the bank ... 
  the reason is that the 2015 macbook has godawful performance . 
  they put zero effort into cooling , and despite intel 's race to the bottom , it 's still gon na thermal throttle at that thinness . 
  small aeroplanes crash all the time . 
  they do n't make the news because they 're ... small . 
  the standards for passenger jets are insanely high , and most airlines have n't had passenger jet crashes in decades . 
  bear in mind though , that only something like 20 % of airplane crashes actually result in any deaths . 
  overall you 're probably still safer than being in a car at any time . 
  it will almost certainly be using an amd gpu , and amd surely also wants to land the cpu as well , especially given zen is nearly done . 
  i ca n't provide much guidance here , other than that i know many people have tried and succeeded in performing a working holiday here . 
  having some service skills will help a lot , be it cafe , retail or something similar . 
  from an outsiders perspective , the new zealand accent is similar , if not in-between the australian and south african accents . 
  if you can manage * the daily show with trevor noah * and any australian accent , you 'll be fine . 
  most of the structural differences come from the various idioms we use , which are a whole other topic . 
  from what i understand , cigarettes are becoming increasingly unaffordable . 
  the government has been phasing out smoking boiling-frog style , and it 's definitely at the point where people would rather you did not smoke in public . 
  i do n't know much on this topic , but there are plenty of backpacker stops in nz , and there 's surely resources online which can tell you where free stuff is . 
  while i 'm not much of a sugar person myself , curiously enough people here prefer sugar over salt in almost everything , to the point where our main sauces are sweet when they might have been savoury in other countries . 
  it 's becoming a bit of a hot-button issue in the media . 
  have n't strayed far from nz , so i ca n't say whether there is truly a lack of salt compared to germany . 
  while [ these guys ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pholcidae ) are everywhere , they 're small , harmless and keep out of your way . 
  only see other kinds of spiders maybe once a year , and never have i come close to any poisonous ones . 
  just make sure they do n't have red or white dots on the back and you 're sweet . 
  typical local/international favourites tend to include * the world 's fastest indian * and * good bye pork pie * . 
  * flight of the conchords * certainly involves new zealanders , though is an american show . 
  sounds like they are making more use of not-nintendo platforms in order to maintain brand recognition , yet not cannibalise hardware sales . 
  will be interesting to see if that works out , as i can totally understand why they are approaching mobile so carefully .
