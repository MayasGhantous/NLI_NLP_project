obscure history , especially of organisations and the procedures behind them . 
  i find it fascinating how everything is organised , and the processes behind that . 
  i am a scout and am currently researching the history of scout groups in our area , something not very many other people are interested in . 
  i am also interested in the cold war , especially the us nuclear arsenal history and the command and control structure and its procedures . 
  work out why . 
  avicii - wake me up, 
  edit : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5y_kjag8bhi, 
  snow is frozen water , and the particles ( little parts ) of it reflect light because they are frozen and solid , making them look white . 
  water is a liquid ( it flows ) , and the light goes straight through it because it is clear and not a solid like snow . 
  what are they ? 
  it does n't have a sound - it 's just * there * somehow ... 
  probably . 
  america . 
  i 'm not sure that 's entirely what he meant ... 
  he * is * next in line for the throne . 
  just in case you could n't figure it out ... 
  yay !, 
  this is irrelevant ; the op is talking about programming languages ( eg . 
  c++ , java ; generally implemented using software ) rather than quantum computing vs. ` regular ' computing ( hardware ) !, 
  the analogue to human languages is wrong . 
  see [ this answer ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/26kikm/eli5_the_difference_in_programming_languages/chsjhuv ) !, 
  / r/funny seems more appropriate, 
  nzers are not aussies !, 
  somalia has a line through it, 
  try setting your user agent to ie . 
  sadly , this is n't funny . 
  it 's true . 
  by the way , the rok is * south * korea . 
  the dprk is north korea .

  +1 for gnumeric, 
  manjaro ( arch-based ) with openbox , and cyanogen mod on ma phone . 
  the c standard says that it is undefined to recursively call main ( ) . 
  the problem was n't really the software itself - it was canonical 's mentality that they were ` right ' and everyone else was ` wrong ' , and the mentality of other developers who thought the opposite . 
  unfortunately , a whole lot of people on the internet cared very much . 
  sudo make me a sandwich . 
  [ grooveshark ] ( http://grooveshark.com ) is still alive ( for the time being ) . 
  maybe even block him/her ( just bein ' thorough ) . 
  / r/explainlikeimfive, 
  i would assume that it is covered by the copyright on the film itself . 
  https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120611/12104019277/student-fined-providing-free-film-tv-subtitles-yet-another-business-opportunity-thrown-away-copyright-industries.shtml is interesting too and might be relevant ( depending on what you want to do ), 
  edit : just read the text of the op and this link sounds like it is relevant - they would need to license the rights from the company to add subtitles . 
  same problem here - i * think * that rhythmbox can handle it ( but only if you want to change your music player , and do n't quote me on it  . 
  edit :, 
  you might be able to set a phone up ( if you have wifi ) and connect it through usb and the clementine `` devices '' tab - i do n't know if that would work though . 
  i have n't used it for a few years now , so i do n't know - i thought it could but i 'm probably wrong . 
  same here in nz . 
  what 's the meaning of stonehenge ? 
  wrong . 
  / r/creepy, 
  please elaborate ... 
  i 'm so good at photoshop . 
  go for it . 
  suppose that 31n +12 is even for some odd number n. 
  an odd times an odd is always odd , as we can write an odd number as 2k +1 and if we multiply two odd numbers ( 2k +1 ) ( 2j +1 ) = 2p +2 j +4 jk +1 which must be odd . 
  therefore 31n must be odd ( as it is an odd times an odd ) . 
  as an odd plus an even is always odd , 31n +12 must be odd , and n can not exist . 
  edited to clarify some points . 
  if w = mg , then acceleration due to gravity would have to be negative . 
  when would this happen ? 
  yeah , but then what do you do with the chassis after it 's been burned out ? 
  aussies . 
  well , now i need to find my way out . 
  i think that the issue is that we ( upper hutt ) would end up with lowest-common-denominator services after an amalgamation because the central council would be so far away and we 're not a big proportion of the people in the area . 
  this happened in auckland ( to the pukekohe area especially ) . 
  discussion on / r/wellington : http://www.reddit.com/r/wellington/comments/2l6rlc/wellington_supercity_survey_disputed/, 
  well , it made me think . 
  a lot . 
  hope things start looking up for you soon !, 
  happy birthday - i think a lot of people feel the same way , so do n't feel alone !, 
  what if n is negative ? 
  or are we assuming that n is positive ? 
  let n = -1, 
  the top of the botanic gardens is good , by the cable car on upland road . 
  no - two people ( you are one of the parents ) . 
  humans share the majority ( 99.9 % ) of their dna anyway . 
  have you tried asking the police ? 
  but there 's nothing not special about marton !, 
  we lost power for a bit . 
  we lost it for ~ 5seconds , so everything turned off :(, 
  thanks !, 
  i guess someone thought that those pics were a good idea ... 
  take your novelty hats and go someplace else . 
  no - you would blink out of existence for a split second too and would not notice . 
  including you ... but good analogy !, 
  which would be identical to the original . 
  your user prefs under the display options heading . 
  of course it 's japanese . 
  great idea putting that `` edit '' into your post without actually editing it . 
  go away , stokes valley . 
  no - i requested the page in advance . 
  `` why did you resign ? '', 
  so , now we know who let the dogs out . 
  maybe try over at / r/theydidthemath ? 
  there is no down in space . 
  but is there cake ? 
  / r/nocontext, 
  the vogons are coming . 
  nice that they hit enter for you . 
  yes , it 's been transferred over to facebook .
