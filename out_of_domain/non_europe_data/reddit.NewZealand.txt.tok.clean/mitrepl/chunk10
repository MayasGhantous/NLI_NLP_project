  are you going to uni , or doing something else ? 
  i 'm hoping to study in europe in a couple of years ( i 'm dutch as well as nz ) !, 
  i have n't decided if i want to do engineering or pure physics yet . 
  if i do engineering i 'll go to the netherlands , but otherwise i 'm not too sure - i ca n't find any courses in undergrad physics in english that are n't in the uk ( and the course fees are huge even for citizens there ) !, 
  / r/math has one , but they probably all use american spelling . 
  libreoffice is a fork of openoffice , but openoffice has n't really been actively updated since it got taken over by apache . 
  libreoffice has an active development community and is regularly updated and supported . 
  nobody expects the british in-queue-sition, 
  a set of solo recordings . 
  i think i 've said this before , but the album as a whole seemed very rushed . 
  it seemed like the band wrote and laid the whole thing down in a couple of recording sessions . 
  the mixing is also not as good as it probably could be ... 
  i just found an [ interview with jarboe on youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkewh9epsua ) where she talks about not being invited to be a part of the new incarnation of swans ( she calls it a `` traumatic experience '' ) . 
  it says buses are replacing wrl trains on part of the line - implying that the section north of uh will be on rail ( iirc this is what usually happens with bus replacements on the hv section ) . 
  great public transport , but still no potato . 
  check his username, 
  perfect 5/7 was expecting musical instrument would read again m8, 
  i liked mx ( not my favourite coldplay album though ) , but i did n't like ahfod because it does n't really seem to have had any real thought put into it by the band . 
  it seems like they felt that they had to get an album out quickly , rather than get an album out that had quality music on it ( not that all the songs are terrible - everglow , amazing day , the title track , aoal , and up & up all had their redeeming features ) . 
  +1 for swans, 
  mayonnaise . 
  they have two buses ( 114 ) every weekday to uh and trentham now , but metlink is looking to put more services in this year or next year . 
  so you 're trying to solve the equation d = 4cost-4 for d = 0 :, 
  0 = 4 cos ( t ) - 4, 
  4 = 4 cos ( t ), 
  cos ( t ) = 1, 
  which is easy to solve : t = 2\u03c0 . 
  you can then express your answer as a time - 2\u03c0 minutes after 3:10 pm . 
  no problem , 
  just a note that you might want to check that you do n't want your answer for t in degrees rather than radians ( six and a half minutes seems like a very short time to be submerged for ) . 
  i have to say , i prefer coke myself . 
  i think it 's about the bird , not the band ( from what i can understand ), 
  i think that op 's tl ; dr summarises it well - op 's honeymoon phase in the relationship does n't end while their partner 's does because their partner becomes one of their ` special interests ' . 
  have n't seen phil for a while !, 
  they have most definitely played b-sides live !, 
  some of them are even on live 2003 !, 
  i know they do n't really play them now , but i was replying to a comment saying that they have _ never _ played them . 
  if you have n't tried kde-based netrunner , i would recommend that ( i used it for about six months last year before i moved back to arch ) . 
  if you like arch but would prefer it to be a little easier , you might want to take a look at manjaro ( it 's a spin-off distro , kind of like how ubuntu is an easier-to-handle spin-off of debain ) . 
  mainly parachutes, 
  car kids confirmed for lp8, 
  beck , the flaming lips , and some other psychedelic rock and experimental pop . 
  hey , another debater !, 
  good luck with the girl . 
  i find a lot of stuff from sigur ros to be really beautiful !, 
  a lot of people think that they can often be too grandiose and over-the-top , but i tend to like that to a degree . 
  do you think that the change in generations will change anything ? 
  in the next few decades , the 80s will become two generations ago - and wo n't many of the bands from that era go the way of a lot of the hit-makers from the 50s and 60s ? 
  i 'm not arguing , i 'm just interested in your opinion . 
  you need to delete ( ) anything you allocate using new [ ] once you 've finished using it ( i 'm not sure if that 's what 's actually causing your problem though ) . 
  in fact , i 'm not too sure if you actually * need * the ` morse ` variable - you should just be able to pass the ` input ` variable into the count_space and check_morse functions without setting a pointer to it ( in c/c + + , arrays are pointers too ) . 
  i 've been listening to his late-90s stuff recently , but i also sometimes enjoy the sea change-era albums . 
  good luck , and have fun with your life . 
  this is n't everything you are . 
  my school has been pushing this at me for a while now , but it does n't seem to be a particularly interesting job for a maths major - mainly routine calculations without much in the way of mathematical problem-solving . 
  i do n't think it 's a bad job at all , just not for me !, 
  sorry ... `` the philosophy of baseball '' ? 
  any idea what that course actually entailed ? 
  the live 2003 version of amsterdam , with that guitar squeal . 
  or gravity off the talk single . 
  try passing ` & input ` rather than ` morse ` - it will pass ` input ` as a pointer to an array . 
  example : instead of ` badspace = count_space ( morse , count ) ` , write ` badspace = count_space ( & input , count ) ` . 
  explanation : when you write ` & ` in front of a variable , it gets the address of the variable rather than the contents of a variable - and a pointer is just a variable which holds the address of another variable rather than a value . 
  & var is what gets stored in the pointer , and * ptr lets you get the value of the address in the pointer . 
  also , i just noticed that i made a mistake - you do n't need the & for the input array because arrays are implicitly convertible to pointers ( you can pass it directly and because the function is expecting a pointer , it will be passed by reference because it 's an array ) . 
  i ca n't believe no-one has mentioned frazier chorus yet . 
  yes . 
  you 'll be passing it by reference . 
  i 've heard good things , but i have n't really listed to anything . 
  [ she 's a black belt in karate ] ( http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/i/514rxxeyy%2bl.jpg ), 
  this literally happened to me two years ago . 
  it turned out she was actually hitler though , so it was all fine . 
  what you 're refering to as linux , is in fact , gnu/linux , or as i 've recently taken to calling it , gnu plus linux . 
  linux is not an operating system unto itself , but rather another free component of a fully functioning gnu system made useful by the gnu corelibs , shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full os as defined by posix . 
  many computer users run a modified version of the gnu system every day , without realizing it . 
  through a peculiar turn of events , the version of gnu which is widely used today is often called linux , and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the gnu system , developed by the gnu project . 
  there really is a linux , and these people are using it , but it is just a part of the system they use . 
  linux is the kernel : the program in the system that allocates the machine 's resources to the other programs that you run . 
  the kernel is an essential part of an operating system , but useless by itself ; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system . 
  linux is normally used in combination with the gnu operating system : the whole system is basically gnu with linux added , or gnu/linux . 
  all the so-called linux distributions are really distributions of gnu/linux !,

  plan 9 ? 
  hey , i saw you over on the swans subreddit the other day . 
  * windiest, 
  is n't the new basis ( 2 , 6 ) , ( 0 , -2 ) as a hypercentaur has two heads and six legs ? 
  later debunked by the band . 
  edit : source http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/radiohead-new-album-release-date-june-manager-confirms-a6985386.html for those asking , especially as the website has been blanked out ( obviously because of this post / s ), 
  on the contrary , the hype in the radiohead community has been most exquisite this year . 
  * no surprises * there, 
  nice to see he remembers the lyrics :d, 
  / r/coldplay is large ( and active , especially around the release of lp7 last year ) . 
  and we all know that radiohead is just a wannabe coldplay / s ;d, 
  awwwwwwww ... ... 
  i see you 're on reddit again , my dude . 
  the govt should be funding this nationwide , not individual councils . 
  with me, 
  i just thought it was a little funny and shared it . 
  if you want to take offence with this post , feel free . 
  well , from your tone you seem to be caring quite a bit .
