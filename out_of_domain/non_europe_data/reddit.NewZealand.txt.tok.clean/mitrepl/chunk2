  jokes aside , we usually have nz sitting in the middle with the americas on the far right and western africa on the left ( so that the atlantic is split in two ) . 
  we have the western hemisphere on the right and the eastern on the left , which makes everything interesting ,

  i see you 've been reading / r/nottheonion . 
  no , quantum theory says ( very simply ) that an object can be in more than one state at once until it is observed . 
  in this case , all it means is that the * prize on the card * could be anything ( it is impossible to know without observing it ) , and in fact is in all possible states until it is observed . 
  the probability of it being in any one of these states is still less than one ( considerably so in the case of the $ 1000000 ) and so you can not say `` i am a millionaire '' . 
  you can only say `` there is a 0.0001 % chance that i would be a millionaire were i to scratch this card . '',

  / r/badscience, 
  this is bad science on so many levels . 
  * quantum cat theory ? 
  * the amount of money in the bank is not in a quantum superposition . 
  * he ca n't say that he * is * a millionaire - only that there is a chance of being a millionaire . 
  my simplified explanation : http://www.reddit.com/r/crazyideas/comments/2nrhca/using_schr%c3%b6dingers_cat_theory_always_carry_around/cmgcbg8, 
  as i said , simplified explanation , 
  i tried to make it clear that the probability of winning or losing was equivalent to what the op of the original post called superposition , but if it was n't clear enough i apologize . 
  i think the problem here is that everyone is trying to take the thing the op of the original post said seriously ( i.e. 
  that quantum mechanics is involved in some way even though it is a macroscopic system involving probabilities etc. 
  etc. ), 
  when we should really stop trying to read into it and agree it 's just not really workable as a theory at all . 
  thanks for your comments !!, 
  i submitted it over there ,
