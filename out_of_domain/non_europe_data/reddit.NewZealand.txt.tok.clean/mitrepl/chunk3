  ninja editing . 
  here in nz we got off 6-7 weeks ago for study leave , 
  i should have guessed . 
  the punctuation is strong with this one . 
  is slowly dying ... 
  yes , i too like to ... 
  ... learn . 
  get out , you heathen !, 
  link ? 
   `` oh , you 're like sheldon ! '', 
  yep . 
  all the time ... ... 
  ( that sounded sarcastic - it was n't . ), 
  thanks !, 
  i kind of wanted to hide it and set a reminder in my calendar or something so that i forget about it and it 's all new to me when i open it . 
  thanks for the suggestion though - i 'll think about it !, 
  and my cousin , who uses internet explorer and msn . 
  and those that do not write grammatically correct sentences . 
  is n't he saying ( or he has said ) that he wants to shut the whole thing down ? 
  i thought i read it on / r/outoftheloop . 
  [ actually , now that you mention it ... ] ( http://thewikigame.com/ ), 
  those that can spell the word `` kinds '' , and those that cunt . 
  and so it was that / u/unknownman19 was no more - slain by an incorrect determiner . 
  nope - i 'm stuck doing exams i could have done last year . 
  systems hungarian ? 
  really ? 
  not working for me ( nz ) !, 
  well , wo n't hold my breath . 
  because / r/whatever is private . 
   * joke *, 
  yeah - it will be great when they roll it out here : /, 
  / u/fernguts has been made a moderator of / r/pyongyang . 
  we 've already mentioned the jews . 
  maybe hitler was jealous of their circumcised penises ? 
  yes - that 's what i was looking for on the wiki page . 
  i decided to go with it !, 
  and assuming a perfectly spherical earth , of course , 
  10/10 would kill again . 
  / r/upperhutt, 
  / r/godwinslaw, 
  * river . 
  1:25 in wellington !, 
  12/10 with rice . 
  works properly ( no movement ) for me too on firefox ( linux i686 ) . 
  why is n't this marked nsfw ? 
  parent : 1999 child : 2020, 
  when the child is 99 , the parents are 20 . 
  you need to add 100 somewhere . 
  * perl * is a whale . 
  * unzips *, 
  good luck for your future , 
  no - that 's an error in the pressing . 
   i feel like i 'm there in that car , pooping and crying with her . 
  / r/nocontext, 
  no , just squeezing it . 
  sorry - i thought you meant the `` official '' track order was different on vinyl . 
  firefox 37 ( nightly build ) - cover art is n't centred for me either , 
  looks great other than that though !, 
  perfect now , thanks !, 
  does n't that mean that whoever is voted off must be straight and so the others will split the $ 1m after one week ( because it is impossible to vote off the wrong person ) ? 
  `` movies '' . 
  according to the `` milk wiki '' , it 's purple , 
  there 's a wiki for everything . 
  it 's like an extension of rule 34 . 
  * cat . 
  current liquid-fueled rockets are fueled with liquid hydrogen , which does not contain water . 
  some use nitrogen tetroxide and hydrazine , or hydrogen peroxide . 
  these also do not contain water . 
  the soyuz rockets use kerosene , which also should not contain water . 
  no , you 'll still die . 
  much sooner than if you drink water in moderation . 
  everyone who has drank rocket fuel has died , in fact . 
  also , i found [ this ] ( http://www.halfwayanywhere.com/north-america/united-states/new-york/fire-island/rocket-fuel-fire-islands-drink-of-choice/ ) which does , in fact , contain water . 
  the only time i will upvote those words ... 
  [ start me up ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgyoacxr8lw ), 
  i resisted the urge to rickroll . 
  ftfy, 
  thanks for the reply - i 'll keep my eyes open . 
  yep - closer to the version on the blue room than the one on parachutes . 
  so 39 pairs and one threesome ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2suuxr/live_updates_tifu_by_reading_my_wifes_text/ is the most believable story ever posted on reddit !, 
  - abraham lincoln, 
  that 's a great subreddit right there . 
  [ and ... three days later ... ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/live/comments/2svnjs/live_tifu_by_reading_my_wifes_texts/ ), 
  you would n't steal a car . 
  you would n't steal a handbag . 
  you would n't steal the weather . 
   the baby paste will crawl up op 's urethra and into a specially designed male-womb for the baby, 
  / r/nocontext, 
  double-posted , 
  the getting into uni is not going to be a problem for him - he 's one of the smartest people i know ( academically - obviously he 's done a pretty stupid thing ) . 
  most of us basically have ue anyway , so yeah . 
  we are all just hoping that he can juggle school and the baby - he ca n't afford to let his attendance drop because that gets taken into account too ... 
  edit :, 
  and yes , it should n't be a problem . 
  he has a social disorder which stops him from making decisions like a `` normal '' person , and his girlfriend is not a great person . 
  she 's someone we all try to avoid at all costs , and no-ones quite sure how they got together in the first place ( he might have felt neglected because for a couple of months stuff got really bad for him and he gave up on his friends because most of them did n't listen to him ) . 
  he 's working at a paintball field which actually pays quite well ( not sure how much they pay in the us , but over here ( nz ) it 's above living wage ) . 
  but i 'll suggest it to him - he enjoys that sort of thing too , so anything to keep him happy !,
