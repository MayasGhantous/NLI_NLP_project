  he 's depressed atm because he realised how badly he f ` ed up and he 's shut himself away . 
  we 're going to talk to him on monday and make sure that he knows that we 're all there for him , and his parents are quite well off ( they 've already said that they 'll help to support him , and knowing them they wo n't back out - even though they are violent pricks , they do care about him ) . 
  in new zealand , we also do have a government support programme for teen parents ( educational and financial support ) , so that 's not urgent right now . 
  as you said , the most important thing is his mental state - we do n't think that he 'll do anything stupid because he does actually care about the baby and wants to take care of it . 
  thanks for the reply - it 's really appreciated . 
  no , 13 candy bars . 
  she only gave 2 away . 
  she could retrieve ten of them at any time with minimal trouble .

  rip in peace, 
  they just touched a little . 
  yeah , the shirt was the real victim in that situation . 
  well . 
  surprised . 
  i 'm a goldfish . 
  i was just making sure that i had n't missed anything . 
  i do n't watch all the reviews and he might have mentioned it or something .

  jenny and carly are so last week . 
  replied to the wrong post , i think . 
  yes - i mean , who could fake that moustache ? 
   he could have * been * so deep , but he thought she was stupid . 
  ftfy, 
  why would we trust anyone siding with zach ? 
  next thing we know , x will be our supreme overlord and our girlfriends will never be safe again . 
  yes , x * is * the man . 
  hey , i 'm from new zealand !, 
  you should n't be recursively calling main ( ) anyway - as / u/tangerinelion said , a forever loop ( ` while ( true ) ` ) is much better practice . 
  / r/nocontext, 
  `` hello , i love you , wo n't you tell me your name ? '', 
  it might also be a reference to the fact that many critics have called the latest album an adam levine solo project . 
  ( for example http://www.rrdailyherald.com/diversions/maroon-s-v-is-solo-showcase-for-adam-levine/article_f089b0f2-39cc-11e4-a0a4-3f8e13c298cd.html ), 
  in my opinion , it 's more a reflection on current pop music ( insane numbers of writers and producers reduce the personality of a group , and there is a much greater reliance on percussion rather than melody ) than the band . 
  this album could have been much better ( i think ) if the production had been toned down a bit and the other members had been mixed higher so that you could hear them without straining your ears . 
  no , it 's `` thank you for your suggestion '' . 
  and you need to rate it with rice , too . 
  and then live update as the pi tells you what 's going on . 
  thank you for your suggestion . 
  you anal ? 
  have you tried waiting ~ 5min to see if a startup script is delaying things and whether it will boot eventually ? 
  i 've had that problem in the past . 
  indeed ... 
  on the lucky losers episode ( l13 ) , alan gets the blue whale bonus ( 100 points , iirc ) . 
  however , this was the episode in which the player with the lowest points total won , so alan ended up losing .

  plan for a voicemail diagram, 
  purpose : to teach people how to use their itc voicemail system, 
  audience : itc customers, 
  application required : inspiration, 
  steps :, 
  gather the information needed for the voicemail diagram . 
  draw a rough sketch to organise all the steps into the order needed and to show the flow between them . 
  test the diagram by working through it and checking that there are no omissions , duplications , or incorrectly ordered items . 
  use inspiration to produce the diagram on an a3 page . 
  print out the diagram . 
  check that the finished diagram is readable , clearly illustrates the system being diagrammed , and is consistent with the specifications of the brief . 
  we have our student leaders dressed in togas delivering roses .

  then lawyer up & hit the gym .

  data is the plural of `` datum '' ( i.e. 
  one datum , many data ) . 
  `` the data show that x is true , except for this outlying datum . '', 
  ( although i personally would say `` data point '' rather than `` datum '' ) . 
  maybe if you 're friends with them too ? 
  idk . 
  10/10 with rice . 
  * ... i 'm doing this wrong , are n't i. . . *, 
  coldplay , swans , maroon 5 , queen , train ( older stuff ) , sheppard . 
  and anything else i get my hands on that 's rock/pop ( experimental and mainstream ) . 
  do you just like train 's latest hits ( soul sister , drive by ) , or the older albums like drops of dupiter and for me , it 's you too ? 
  train 's that sort of band ( people know the hits but not the artist ) . 
  coldplay , swans , maroon 5 , train , many others . 
  i collect music . 
  i like experimental rock , pop rock , bubblegum pop , mainstream rock , and i 've been trying to get into hip-hop too .

  i was expecting to have to do actual work this year , but it does n't seem to have happened yet !, 
  my calc teacher spent half the first lesson telling the class how difficult it would be - it probably would have had more of an effect if most of my other teachers had n't done the same thing  i only just got h/w this weekend . 
  calc , stats , english , physics , chem and computing . 
  you ?
