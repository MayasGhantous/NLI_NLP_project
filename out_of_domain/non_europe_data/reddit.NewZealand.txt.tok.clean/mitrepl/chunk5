  i would 've taken bio if i could , but not enough slots ... 
  i enjoyed geo last year too . 
  what 's engineering like ? 
  they do n't offer it up here :(, 
  every teardrop is a waterfall is from mx , not gs . 
  i think his teacher was joking . 
  it 's called founder 's day down here !, 
  til kingdom come is n't listed on the back of x&y , and it 's listed in the booklet and on the cd as ' + ' with no track number . 
  i 've always found that people have heard of the songs but do n't know that they 're by the same band/have heard any of the album tracks . 
  it 's nice to find that there are some actual other fans out there !, 
  * this user is now physically sick, 
  yes !!!!!!, 
  just vote civillian . 
  haha nope, 
  the best answer here . 
  and it 's all your friends , not midnight , 
  sin ^ -1 x \u2260 ( sin x ) ^ -1, 
  sin ^ -1 means inverse sine , not raising to a power . 
  you have to write ( sin x ) ^ -1 to do that . 
  do n't ask why - it just is !,

  / thread, 
  that is some dank imagery right there . 
  if you do n't do it , you 'll never know . 
   i 'm still confused . 
  do n't worry - so am i , 
  the most important part of that post . 
  ttt, 
  paging / u/sinder-wolf, 
  why u use chrome ?? 
  student ... 
  me , and the lack of upvotes on this comment proves it . 
  they only touched a little . 
  / r/murica, 
  we 're negating the moot . 
  unfortunately , the juniors do n't get to choose who gets which side !, 
  the reason that the team chose to argue this way is that it it 's better to build up an argument and by doing that break down the other team 's argument than just bluntly tear down their points . 
  we want to smash heretaunga , not just beat them , 
  we 're using the example of the hague and amsterdam in the netherlands ( one is the official capital , but the other has the parliament & govt ) . 
  it sort of goes in the same vein as this ... 
  this is probably going to be our main point - they just need to flesh it out and learn it !, 
  picking another city is a good idea - we 'd probably want more time to prep for it though , and we 've had setback after setback in getting this team together : /, 
  we did talk about `` auckland should n't necessarily be the capital just because it was in the past because russell was the capital before that and no-one 's arguing that russell should be the capital '' , but that 's more of a rebuttal for something they might say than something we would pull out . 
  it does n't really have much strength , i do n't think . 
  there also are n't many other cities apart from wgn and akl that you could actually argue would make a reasonable capital - chch has had the earthquake , hamilton is a dump , and dunedin ... is dunedin . 
  tauranga has the port , but that 's about it ( proximity to tourism maybe , and also space to expand airport ? ), 
  remember though that the point is to make their argument seem as pointless as possible - if we can frame it in such a way that it sounds like they 're implying this then we get points . 
  and also , you could argue that akl is already in a way the economic & financial capital ( unofficially of course ) , so does n't need the politics ... 
  my brain does n't think & type at the same time , apparently :( - yes , i do agree with your point !, 
  the only right answer , obviously !, 
  ca n't believe we did n't think of it earlier !, 
  nitpicking here , but, 
   embassies are always in the capital of any country . 
  see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/positions_on_jerusalem#location_of_foreign_embassies . 
  the embassies in israil are in tel aviv , not the capital ( jerusalem ) . 
  really huge networks !, 
  yeah , well we 're uhc . 
  the school has got a lot better recently though , and is now only the * second-worst * secondary school in wgtn !!!, 
  * sigh *, 
  i 'm touched :'), 
  see my reply [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/wellington/comments/2xl8di/why_should_wellington_stay_as_the_capital_of_nz/cp1gzum ) . 
  the us recognises jerusalem as the capital of a `` unified israel '' , though ( i think ) . 
  such dank 8/8 m8, 
  the wishing chair ? 
  edit : no , the faraway tree . 
  great book that . 
  i can take c/c + + !, 
  may the schwartz be with you . 
  swans , death grips and some more mainstream stuff . 
  hi , i 'm mitrepl & i 'm a linux nerd whose focus is c/c + + systems programming ( with some osdev experience ) , and web dev . 
  brainfuck ftw !, 
  c++ code style guidelines that i use :, 
  the problem i 've found with gnu is that because it has to support some really old code it 's not as good for new code . 
  but that 's just my opinion . 
  i find it easier to read code when the brackets are aligned with each other , and two-space indentation is just what i prefer . 
  it 's fine as long as you 're consistent , 
  do you get to keep the stuff after the 10 years are up ? 
  how do i turn caps lock off ? 
  or lower hutt . 
  xkcd link http://xkcd.com/447/, 
  avoid porrirua and stoke 's valley . 
  the rest is fine . 
  upper hutt is good too now , although there 's nothing in the city centre . 
  because marketing, 
  upper hutt is fine now that all the gangs have moved out of trentham down to you lot , 
  talk to her in person , mate . 
  upper hutt is more a place to stay then a place to do stuff in . 
  go into welly , and avoid porrirua and lower hutt . 
  there 's great fish + chips on the kapiti coast , and some good short walks around the cities . 
  also , go check out / r/wellington if you have n't already . 
  source : live in upper hutt , 
  it looks fine for me - the other mods were n't having a problem either when we discussed it a couple of days ago . 
  a quick search brought [ this page ] ( http://simpleprogrammer.com/2012/12/01/why-c-is-not-back/ ) up for me ; an interesting read even though i do n't entirely agree . 
  it looks like your testicles are dripping blood again . 
  we do n't have a council anyway - we have a golf club , 
  upper hutt is fine except for trentham and wallaceville - they give the rest of us a bad name , 
   lower hutt here, 
  there 's your problem . 
  it does n't really happen in uh since the gangs moved down to sv . 
  ararino is bad too .
