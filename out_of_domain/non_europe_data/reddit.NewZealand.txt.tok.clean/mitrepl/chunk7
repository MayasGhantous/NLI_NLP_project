   how can you have an opinion about something purely quantifiable ... ? 
  the joke is that i had an opinion about something purely quantifiable that was verifiably wrong . 
  i did n't know that horizontal parabolae did n't exist , 
  * pepes, 
  hey , it 's only * half * of upper hutt that 's drugged up , 
  maybe / u/chickenalfredopizza meant that she * also smoked * . 
  fine , be that way . 
  * sigh * , 
  unfortunately it only opens at 5pm ... 
  i 'm so meta , even this acronym, 
  well , at least your school can * afford * cables . 
  well , anthony fantano certainly has n't . 
  well , it 's palmy , so yeah . 
  seven hundered years . 
  you go girl, 
  i 'm so meta , even this uninstaller . 
  it 's a good way to learn your way around - it 's always a fun event !, 
  it 's almost wildbergerian , although wildberger actually has a ( somewhat ) rational argument . 
  no pun intended . 
  probably 3 or 4 is good , i 'd say . 
  it might get harder with more , but it 's sunday so the buses wo n't be as full anyway . 
  it 's designed to be mostly public transport . 
  the queen would probably call a government together . 
   i took the position in favor of the existence of the number based on `` faith . '', 
  yep . 
  but i do . 
  * i think [ / r/anal ] ( http://reddit.com/r/anal ) s ' are bigger . 
  notice the misplaced apostrophe , and the word `` are '' is more correct than the word `` is '' /, 
  belonging to all the members of / r/anal , rather than belonging to / r/anal . 
  what about peeing ? 
  ctrl-f `` up '', 
   7 new song titles, 
  do you have a link ? 
  is n't that song cheating ? 
  only in nelson . 
  it 's nice to see that some of the other members of the band are songwriting again !, 
  it sounds like a trick question . 
  `` what is george 's name ? '', 
  probably not george , if it 's a question . 
  sometimes i overthink the internet . 
  ( it is photoshopped , right ? ), 
  apparently the lh city centre is flooded . 
  also , you 'd think that when they spent 20 million dollars rebuilding this school that they would actually install drains . 
  what 's the south coast like ? 
  hi james, 
  the only way into the hutt now is via sh58 and porrirua , if that 's any help ( although the flooding around judgeford on 58 is getting higher ) . 
  good luck to your friend !, 
  sh4 is a horrible road between whanganui and raetihi though ( takes twice as long as you think it will ) . 
  thanks !,

  i thought it was just the studio stuff , not live, 
  all the gangs from trentham have moved down there now . 
  and me . 
  join the downvote train !, 
  right click on the table and select `` regenerate '' ( if the toc is autogenerated ) . 
  i believe that victoria is supposed to be more orientated to that major , but do n't quote me on it . 
  nope, 
  i used it for train tickets at the station sometimes, 
  is there any move to having paywave payment for public transport rather than a separate card ( to prevent the clash ) ? 
   this is * the * good subreddit .

  but here you go ... 
  i read that as `` where is everyone watching the hurricanes fail . '', 
  let 's hope not . 
  thanks !, 
  where can we get them ? 
  you should factorise s ^ 2 + 4sh to s ( s +4 h ) . 
  when you divide 4sh by s , you get 4h rather than 3h ( the coefficient does n't decrease ) . 
  in taumaranui , there * is * only one hoodie !,

   ended on a positive note, 
  because who would n't want to be a part of the british empire ?

  usually the child comments under a deleted top comment would still stay around , so moving a deleted top post down would make them less visible . 
  how far down would a deleted post move down ? 
  right to the bottom ? 
  down five places ? 
  in new zealand , keas ( 6-8 ) are orange , cubs ( 8-10 .5 ) are yellow , scouts ( 10.5-14 ) are green , venturers ( 14-18 ) are purple , rovers ( 18-26 ) are red , and leaders ( 18 + ) are blue . 
  the uniform is the same , it 's just the section badge that changes . 
   tell them what 's wrong kindly . 
  in fact , use the github issue tracker at https://github.com/happyzombies/sign_up/issues if there 's anything you think needs work , and then everyone can comment on it . 
  it should be , because you can deform a sphere through the n +1 th dimension around the other sphere and it is still topologically equivalent ( similar to the way that a klein bottle does n't intersect itself in 4-space ) . 
  ( please correct me if i 'm wrong or unclear ! ), 
  it looks like it 's been closed to be upgraded judging by all the sold land, 
  we got warned on the bus on the way over that we would be pushed through and that we should try and stall for as much time as possible . 
  everyone who went through with us spent as much time in there reflecting as we could .
