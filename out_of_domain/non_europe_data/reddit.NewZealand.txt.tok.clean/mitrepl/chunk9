  these grades are what is entered by the marker into nzqa 's system , and these are translated into the abs and the sna marks by the website . 
  according to the official marking guidelines for 2015 , you will get a void mark ( translates to an sna ) if either the paper is blank _ or _ the entire result is crossed out . 
  i was hoping for a cal video after seeing that title : /, 
  great vid though - i learned much . 
  good choices . 
  should n't the perimeter equation be p = 2w +3 l - the fourth line of length l is n't part of the perimeter ( it 's inside the shape ) ? 
  i got x = 9.090 and y = 0.607 , but i have n't checked my answer . 
  hence the gap between them - it would have been the route of the canal if the earthquake did n't disrupt the construction plans . 
  i really like the way you went with this , 
  great read !, 
  obviously ellen pao is more popular . 
  it 's not just a boulder ... it 's a rock !, 
  after he broke both his arms . 
  that 's mister doctor professor clean to you . 
  with magic ^ ^ \u00ae, 
   i 'm not sure if it 's possible to have a c program that does n't segfault but also does n't have a main ( ) function . 
  edit : ask her out now , not soon . 
  edit 2 : not the one you kissed , the one you like . 
  all i see is ***** . 
  first find all the points in the interval where tan ( x ) = 0 ( x = 2\u03c0 , x = \u03c0 , and x = 0 ) . 
  these will be solutions ( as both sides will then = 0 ) . 
  then you can cancel tan from both sides , and you have :, 
  3sec ^ ( 2 ) ( x ) = 4, 
  sec ^ ( 2 ) ( x ) = 4/3, 
  cox ^ ( 2 ) ( x ) = 3/4, 
  cos ( x ) = \u00b1 \u221a ( 3/4 ), 
  taking x = arccos ( + \u221a ( 3/4 ) ) , we get x = \u03c0 / 6 . 
  another solution will be at x = 11\u03c0 / 6 because cos is symmetrical around x = \u03c0 . 
  [ here is a graph showing the symmetry . 
  ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=cos%28x%29+%3d+1%2f%28sqrt%284%2f3%29%29+where+0%3cx%3c2pi ), 
  x = 5\u03c0 / 6 is the solution to arccos ( - \u221a ( 3/4 ) ) , and the symmetrical one will be x = 7\u03c0 / 6 ( again , symmetrical around \u03c0 ) . 
  in total , the solutions are :, 
  edit : missed x = 2pi as a solution to tan ( x ) = 0 and the negative square root solutions . 
  edit 2 : formatting, 
  you missed the solutions where tan ( x ) = 0 - also , the solutions you gave [ do n't work ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=3sec^2%28pi%2f3%29tan%28pi%2f3%29+%3d+4tan%28pi%2f3%29 ) . 
  see my answer above . 
  i think my way is simpler ( it does n't need identities ) , but this works too . 
  if you do n't mind me asking , how did you get cos ( pi/3 ) = + / - sqrt ( 3 ) / 2 ? 
  it equals 1/2 !, 
  there was some discussion in the subreddit about the singalong part sounding added-on when the track first came out . 
  also , you missed the goldrush ( b-side to the life in technicolor ii single ), 
  ^ ( and lost ? , lost - , and lost @ but they do n't really count ), 
  great , / r/outside is leaking again . 
  the hardest part would like a word with you . 
  my good sir , please pm me . 
  shh bby is ok, 
  it was found in another era - the 1998 safety ep has [ `` no more keeping my feet on the ground '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emgqif7r9_w ) as the second track . 
  [ 1.36 you say ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mohj9palfc0 ), 
  or any other kind of jokes, 
  their debut album is good for driving too . 
  aww man the feels ... :(, 
  omfg i did worse than hitler, 
  oh man plese halp am not good with computer, 
  sshhh bby is ok, 
  give me the formuoli, 
  imho the entire album feels slightly rushed , like they had a deadline to meet . 
  no , ie * is * ass . 
  i * think * that op is asking what albums from other artists we like as much as ( or as little as ) ahfod . 
  it 's two songs in one - fly on is the first part , and o is the ambient bit after it . 
  it 's more obvious on the non-deluxe version because there 's a long gap between them . 
  charlie brown was originally part of the lyrics , fyi . 
  the osaka sun remix is a thing . 
   they do n't care who tells them they are a sociopath , they are never a sociopath . 
  exactly . 
  if you think you 're a sociopath , you 're * not * a sociopath ( in most cases ) . 
  cool, 
  i read that as pornography club . 
  they multiply like sheep, 
  * waves, 
  you can search the openttd forums on the website and find a few threads on various patches . 
  did you die happy ? 
  [ look at this amazing painting i made all by myself ] ( http://i.imgur.com/t1inwcl.jpg ), 
  are you at least happy while living ? 
  we had someone a couple of years ago caught searching for gay black porn by a teacher . 
  no attempt to cover it up either - using google images in the middle of a computer lab right next to the teacher 's desk ... 
  embrace is another one ( in fact , the track gravity out of their 2004 album was originally a coldplay song which later appeared as a b-side for talk ) . 
  brendan got that and you did n't . 
  i hope that you 're proud of yourself . 
  in my opinion it 's fine if you 're into that kind of music . 
  well , with a username like that i 'm not surprised . 
  so meta, 
  also in this kind of vein : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kli6w09b000, 
  i can understand jason wade . 
  i ca n't understand cm on birds !, 
  hey , that 's my name !, 
  ( i 'm alex , not that one obviously though ) . 
  edit :, 
  after reading that , it does sound a bit like me . 
  it 's getting a bit creepy now ( not really , but you see what i mean ) . 
  thanks for the reply !, 
  thanks for the response , and i 'll be sure to keep that in mind ( i 'm actually feeling a lot better now i 've actually written something down , so i 'm sure talking will help a lot ) . 
  i 'm more worried about giving up what i do enjoy about them ( i think i 'm hoping that this non-enjoyment will pass over the summer holidays before the start of the new school year ) , but i 'll keep that in mind and see how i go - i always have the option to drop out if i feel i need to ( it 's a govt-funded thing , so i do n't need to pay any cancellation fees etc. 
  if i drop out late ) . 
  ninja edit :, 
  hey , another nzer !, 
  i saw the username !, 
  i 've actually just got to do a term and then i have ue , so that 's cool !, 
  how bout you ?
