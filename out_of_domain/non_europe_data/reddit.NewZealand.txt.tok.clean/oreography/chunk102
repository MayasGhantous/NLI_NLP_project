  i think the surface pro looks great as it has a wacom pen which would be great for handwriting recognition . 
  unfortunately their quite expensive and i do n't know the price in hkd, 
  you bigot !, 
  what about figs rights , huh ? 
  this is why i became an atheist folks . 
  if god was so good why did n't he make pokemon real ? 
  every dead fundie = 2.3 new atheists ( dats cuz wer all born atheist :d ), 
   i ca n't believe these strawmen people i made up actually exist !, 
  or just buy a suit that fits ? 
  he can be on any sever , anytime and that 's just with the one ip address . 
  really ? 
  christ 's death is what saved us . 
  through christs blood being spilt on the cross we are gifted eternal life and an escape from the sins that tie us to the world . 
  i believe basically everything concerning the succession of kings in israel is accurate . 
  aside from the exodus i think the old testament is a great resource for jewish history . 
  apparently atheism going by his flair . 
  oh who am i kidding , they 're all satanic . 
  dae like boobs ? 
  words to take to heart . 
  i 'm going to up my alternet sharing on facebook by 50 % in order for change to continue . 
  you find it in the / r/atheism comments on their most stupid links as well to be fair . 
  there 's a big disparity between the upvoters and the commenters there . 
  he submits regularly to the biggest persecution complex on reddit / r/antiatheismwatch so yes he very much is . 
  the reason people complain about it is that it 's a default sub ... if they took away it 's default status you would have far fewer people making fun of it . 
  how about raiding / r/christianity , / r/islam and just about every religious sub on reddit . 
  upvoting a picture of muhammed shitting in his mouth and jesus fucking a goat ? 
  and the recent post hitting number one that reminded anyone who criticized the sub to repeatedly fuck off , hitting the front page of unregistered visitors to reddit who likely were n't even atheists . 
  and let '' s not forget the day hundreds of users decided they were so intelligent they were worthy of taking pictures and quoting themselves . 
  it 's not the complaining about religion , it 's the fact that it 's a default sub when the content being spewed out should have disqualified them from that title long ago . 
  well you got most cringeworthy comment in the thread , so there is that . 
  it was only the science spirit that made me realize this story actually did happen . 
  i too was skeptical not seeing the true story face or the reddit watermark but thankfully science showed me the way again . 
  why a high five from le lesbian ? 
  why not le sexy time ?? 
  if you want girls to actually like you ( which seems the goal of this fantasy you 're projecting ) stop making rage comics and stop being preachy about your atheism . 
  this is totally true . 
  it 's so amazing he posted it instantly after seeing it . 
  when you proclaim your regime as a communist regime people view if that way . 
  there 's never been a proper communist `` government '' i agree because the last step is to relinquish power to the people . 
  except because of greed and human nature , once a powerful government is established the leaders are n't ever going to give it up , despite what their ideals might have originally been . 
  more like j-cash ( money ), 
  this is really sad . 
  i met the guy on a flight from chch to auckland a year ago and we got chatting because we shared the same phone ( galaxy note ) . 
  i was amazed when he told me he was the ceo since he was n't travelling business class . 
  he seemed a really nice guy too and did some great things for prices in our telco industry . 
  ** you ** have got a nerve coming to our bastion of logic and reason and trying to corrupt it with your fairy tales . 
  i ca n't believe the shit i 'm hearing from ** you **, 
  if you do n't believe being an atheist does n't make you a scientist then you [ 're not a true atheist you 're a logico proctor ad-hominem cognitive dissonance ** fundie **, 
  ### if you do n't like our superior content then unsubscribe and remember to go fuck yourself on the way out . 
  ## fuck off fundie . 
  did you not read step one ? 
  either stop oppressing us scientists or, 
  upsagan to make / u/lednemreivax a mod of the mothership, 
  i think lednemreivax would be a better mod than / u/skeen who never actually does any modding . 
  glasses have circles, 
  intellectuals wear glasses, 
  intellectuals are liberal, 
  therefore circles = liberalism = accuracy . 
  just to clarify it 's battlefield bad company 2 ... and i entered my serial code so it 's not that . 
  i have issues connecting to games through ea online even though i can login through origin online after resetting my password . 
  also the automatic update from ie9 to ie10, 
  i literally just poked him with my virtual lovestick . 
  ama, 
  hey i 've got another one ... 
  ready ... 
  historical records show jesus existed ... 
  ** april fools lol !!!, 
  ### those who have never karma whored or hat traded like the periwinkles cast the first downvote . 
  but did he really say yes ... or was that just what joyce wanted us to think ? 
  in the unwritten sequel he says no , but the illuminatzis got him drunk in dublin and threw him in the river before the truth could be revealed . 
  yeah ... the moral to kill little children . 
  god = child abuser = fundie enabler = hitler . 
  also just the ridiculous notion of wanting one company to handle every single piece of private information you have . 
  he wants google to almost become a government from the sounds of things . 
  i 'd call you judas but sadly you and your treachery is real, 
  #### owned, 
  upvoted for atheism, 
  i heard there 's a really good calculator app on it . 
  i think the hatred does n't come from it simply being a cartoon or targeted towards children , but that it 's targeted towards girls that makes it problematic . 
  and that it 's seen as very unmasculine , sort of like watching romantic movies but worse . 
  to be honest i think the biggest problem is really the fanbase , people see a picture of a whacked out brony and asssume the rest of the community looks and acts like that . 
  stop taking this site so seriously . 
  i think we 're getting both though are n't we ? 
  the cathedral was a landmark for the city and the rebuild of it is going to be a big and expensive thing , regardless of how you feel . 
  i think a traditional style rebuild with keeping some of the ruins as a monument is the best solution . 
  that way it can be earthquake proof without being an eye sore/dated in a few years . 
  i work at a record store and we had someone in the other day wanting a japanese release of a rolling stones album . 
  it was still being published but it was way more than the western release cost . 
  i actually printed this link off and handed it to a hate preacher on my campus . 
  i just casually dropped it in front of him . 
  when he figures out the joke he 's going to be ** so mad !!, 
  change `` your friend '' to `` your friendzoner '' . 
  fundies never change . 
  it 's just how sensationalised the title is . 
  often many of the articles on / r/politics are good but they can be very slanted and full of hyperbole which is what we 're satirising . 
  also do n't listen to the lienguists saying languages have evolved over time . 
  there was one language that god created and then after literally building a tower to heaven he created others . 
  til : god is an atheist, 
  aka atheist marriage .
