  my life never existed without jesus so clearly i ca n't live without him . 
  homosexuals , feminists , abortions and democrats will be cleansed in the eternal fire , mark my words . 
  the world may accept their sinful charms but i have long desensitized myself to `` feelings '' and `` listening '' to let them sneak their ideas into my cold heart . 
  i do n't get why being a eunuch is n't more popular . 
  do n't people know it 's biblical ? 
  i like how he misspelled atheist here when he would be berating anyone else who dared misspell it by mistake, 
  just wondering what new rights the bill actually brings forward ? 
  i thought the civil union bill a few years ago gave basically the same rights as marriage but without the title , unlike in the us where marriage laws are more significant . 
  guys i 'm not gay but would it be okay if i posted a fake pic of me getting gay married for karma ? 
  ah thanks for clarifying, 
  praise sagan : we have finally distilled liquid bravery into a maymay !, 
  as a new zealender i 'm going to take the opportunity to gloat about how progressive we all are . 
  my upvotes passed the law , why ca n't yours america ? 
  you forgot kingdom hearts which was one of the big reasons i got mine, 
  only pc , no console, 
  `` when superior knowledge is acquired we have a duty to spread it . 
  no matter where the burdgen may lead us : facebook , reddit or our campus computer lab , we shall overcome !, 
  every atheist is a brother in the fight . 
  despite these sticky hands of dew , i shall embrace you . 
  despite these dusty hands of doritos , i shall applaud you . 
  despite these chubby fingers of reason , i shall fight with my keyboard for you . 
  the time is ours for the taking , let 's not waste it on delusions '', 
  the masters . 
  their quoting finesse is incomparable . 
  dodm confirmed for boston bomber . 
  we did it reddit !!, 
  i just hope it 's still an action rpg and on ps3 . 
  it would be a good swan song for the console . 
  you mean kkkristians to do list or hitlers to do list . 
  stupid fundies sadly do real , but le god ca n't do anything hence le photo . 
  praying for the people of boston right now . 
  i really hope that the suspects are brought to justice asap, 
  you know they did have telegrams back then ... 
  i honestly ca n't fathom anyone except the grizzliest neckbeard in the room that would sincerely believe that . 
  i think this is just linkbait for people to jerk to and against , and if so he 's been quite successful . 
  for fucks sake reddit ... this is the top comment ? 
  and it got reddit gold ? 
  well congratu fucking lations . 
  this is exactly what visitors to this site want to see in a major thread . 
  the core tenants of many religions may not be ammendable but the verses on homosexuality in the bible occur twice i believe , once in the old and once in the new . 
  that 's hardly a fundamental of the religion and can be reconciled with a lgbt friendly faith . 
  likewise what interpretation of the creation story you take is not a major tenant of christianity , there is room for different positions on it . 
  there are core tenants e.g christs ressurection where there is no room for many different interpretations as it 's very clear that it 's a literal event from the text , but for other lesser events in the bible there is room for change . 
  your view that fundamentalism is the only interpretation is ridiculous as at least for christianity fundamentalism has n't even been a major view in the history of the faith up until the last two centuries . 
  it 's really not `` you 're either a mad fundamentalist or an atheist '' when it comes to religion . 
  perhaps consider looking at the different views on hot topics in different denominations/religions and why they hold them instead of jumping to make to your own conclusions . 
  this is a place for news articles , not memes . 
  given the recent sales of the 3ds announced i imagine quite a bit of mario and co , but i agree that a lot of kids are getting ipod touches and smartphones and playing smartphone titles . 
  well i 've got no problem with the death penalty so long as it 's being used on idiots like this guy ... 
  to me : random people i 've never met before and only communicate through maymays are my family . 
  our shared lack of belief in a god and superiority complex is a tie stronger than blood, 
  [ it 's really sad because these teenagers probably do n't have any friends at high school . 
  y' all need jesus and someone to love etc. 
  [ why the hell life of pi ? 
  it 's a defense of belief in god ] ( / ooc ), 
  no it 's not fundamental at all if you accept the bible has errors , which many christians are willing to admit . 
  the book is considered divinely inspired , not divinely dictated , hence the mistakes in it . 
  if you considered it inerrant i would agree with you but if you do n't , it does n't render the religion moot . 
  it 's because people think nitpicking something destroys someones argument . 
  i 've seen it on both sides christians and atheists . 
  the worst offender is the grammar correction one , someone misspells a word and suddenly the whole paragraph they wrote is n't worth addressing because they 're inferior non spell-checking plebs . 
  it 's called the `` orthodox '' church, 
  and the sinners name was ... albert einstein !, 
  checkmate ... er ... sanity !, 
  i think we 'll see at least a year or so of game releases before the console dies . 
  the ps2 gave at least another year after the ps3 came out . 
  if it is xv then i think you 're right but if it 's still a spin off hopefully it 's on ps3 like they promised . 
  you realize that / r/atheism repost was taken either at a religious school or obviously fake . 
  who titles a test something as vague as `` 4th grad science test '' unless they just wanted karma . 
  you talk about `` fucktards trying to encourage ignorance '' , go look in a mirror . 
  the government suppresses the religious beliefs of the inhabitants there . 
  unless you 're in a state approved buddhist sect you can be arrested likewise with any other religion in china . 
  trigger warning !, 
  i 'll upvote anything with jews and aliens . 
  fucking market theocracies as well `` in god we trust '' pshh ... 
  in atheism or bust amirite ? 
  because our legislators are gun crazy nazis , that 's why . 
  you ca n't have both you stupid fundie . 
  you 're either backwards creatitard trash or bow to lord dawkins as the provider of all quote making knowledge relating to biological ~ ~ sciences ~ ~ atheism . 
  this is a hypocritical view . 
  could you not claim that those in al qaeda are not `` muslims '' at least defined by muhammed and any islamic scholar . 
  stalin was a self proclaimed communist but like all communists that achieved power never would fit marx 's ideal communist due to self interest, 
  i liked how the mods did it pretty much as soon as the mothership, 
  relative to forcing women to cover up and bombing people i 'd imagine it would be . 
  i was n't entirely disagreeing with you that it 's not a religious conflict neither was the guy you responded to i think but just pointing out in order for the government to keep their power in the region they suppress the religious beliefs of the inhabitants there . 
  i do n't know why he submitted it as a text post . 
  did n't he learn from the posts that stopped the boston bombing that your professional quotes you make up get much more karma in image form . 
  even if it 's just words on a black background . 
  no matter what you do god will always accept you back . 
  i would suggest quitting your job and praying to find a new one . 
  do you know anyone at church with a business hiring ? 
  even if it 's just temporary work it would be better than being a camgirl . 
  `` a priest once touched my genitals . 
  science touched my heart . '',
