  video games are science so any religious crap in them are automatically sceintific . 
  i bought a cfw ps3 recently . 
  it 's very complicated if your firmware version is over 3.55 as it involves flashing the console . 
  however if it 's less than 3.55 there are firmwares like rogero 's that you can easily just softmod the console with via usb, 
  you know people said the same thing about ocarina of time in the 90s ... 
  cod 4 - reinventing console shooters . 
  will be seen similar to halo/goldeneye, 
  resident evil 4 - changing the horror/survival shooter genre, 
  bioshock infinite + original - fantastic storytelling, 
  super mario galaxy, 
  uncharted series, 
  i have a friend who always submits shit from the atheist meme/4chan pages on religion , almost always consisting of painting all religious people as creationists . 
  pretty much any christians that know him call him out on it . 
  i explained theistic evolution to him etc and that religious people are n't all deluded nazis and he 's like `` oh yeah that 's a good point '' then continues to repeat the same bullshit ad infinitium . 
  oh also he has regular posts on how he 's such a `` nice guy '' that girls put him in the friendzone . 
  why have you not unsubbed yet ? 
  i subscribe to trueathesim which although it 's regarded as '' / r/atheism with a thesaurus '' it has some interesting content and no memes . 
  it 's disgusting how they treat us atheists speaking our mind on this site . 
  it 's almost as if there is a large and widespread anti-r/atheism sentiment that is prevalent on reddit . 
  the criticism of r/atheism is significantly out of proportion with its alleged quality issues . 
  this smacks of an agenda to silence atheist activism and deny atheists the haven they have found on reddit, 
  please can we have a ken ham and jerry falwell macro ? 
  i know i might get downvoted but ... [ this ] ( http://cdn.thegloss.com/files/2012/11/obama1.jpg ), 
  i saw one other in til a while ago about something charitable he or his wife did , but bush is still regularly villified on / r/politics . 
  i 'd hardly say reddit loves george bush now . 
  `` i do n't recall x did y , so z is better . '', 
  `` well i do n't recall z did w , so x is better ! '', 
  it 's still a great game and some might regard it as the best game ever , but the best game `` ever '' is always the best game so far . 
  that 's why you were downvoted , in a few months to 5 years to whenever in the future a better game can come out . 
  making blanket statements like `` nothing will ever be better '' is n't a good idea , because none of us can predict the future . 
  \\ #abillionpeoplearen ` trapists, 
  power , lust and greed are greater motivations than religion and always have been . 
  i think you underestimate human nature , there will always be something to fight about . 
  it 's harder if you 're 3.55 + because sony put a stop to it , but from 3.55 you can get the latest cfw 4.40 that 's the same as official . 
  nobody burns the games , you just put them on an external hdd and play them . 
  it 's not just that as had been pointed out . 
  anal sex is a big risk but the guy community has a higher rate of stds than heterosexuals due to less condom use, 
  why do sinners feel the need to sin ? 
  it 's in their nature to accept every single abomination in `` popular '' culture . 
  let it be known that true ^ tm christians ^ tm not in the world ^ tm like me and my pastor are happy to shun everyone who acts unchristlike ( different to me ) out of our bubble ^ tm, 
  the only thing that strikes me as objectionable is the marcelenes father sequences . 
  five year olds should n't be watching something like that . 
  i 'd say the show is 10-13 year old and up . 
  right , so having different opinions = satire . 
  i do n't agree with a lot of what they say but it 's hardly a satire board . 
  / r/liberalreality is political satire , / r/conservative is n't . 
  i recommend the extension mediahint for firefox and chrome . 
  it lets you use hulu/netflix/iplayer no matter where you aer . 
  sweet sagan , someone please photoshop a knight of ~ ~ atheism ~ ~ science !, 
  how does he have karma that high ? 
  racists must love reddit as a platform for spreading their shit . 
  will do buddy . 
  keep safe on the road as well , pull over if you need a break . 
  i only res tag super preachy atheists like / u/feinberg and see them predictably show up in any default board discussion on religion . 
  i 'm not surprised though , redditors love their casual racism . 
  i 'm pretty sure the adverse effects are rare . 
  i mean i 've had them in the past so i 'm not worried about getting one , i was just wondering if it was necessary . 
  i 'm not disputing that as i 've had them in the past . 
  i just wondered if it was necessary for someone my age ( 20 ) to get one , since i 've had them in the past . 
  tbe american military is literally the new crusade . 
  wake up sheeple !!, 
  how is `` valve not showing anything '' major news ? 
  guys do n't upvote every single thing related to valve , they have n't done anything noteworthy in months . 
  no i have n't but very few people have had adverse affects ( read as allergies etc , not autism ), 
  * cheetos and dew, 
  let us all give thanks to lord tyson for our great internet scientist nukethepope . 
  this is not tbe first time nor will it be the last his euphoria is preserved for all of us to study and understand . 
  only through his great science cann we reach a higher plane of godless existence . 
  believe it or not he 's in his 50s ... 
  sadly the world is n't ready for bravery the size of ntp ; _ ;, 
  i 'm pretty sure the `` born gay '' guy is a troll, 
  `` do you believe in a god ? '', 
  `` keeping religion out of this , why do n't you believe that a god exists ? '', 
  `` because i am god . '', 
  in all the / r/games soundtrack threads i always nominate it for the best ever . 
  it 's a shame it does n't look like we 'll be getting a sequel any time soon . 
  did it have a pentagram on it as well ? 
  you posted an opinion that 's better suited for / r/agreewithme, 
  this, 
  she tried to make me give `` grace '' aka modern slavery once . 
  i spat in my food and wobbled off to my room with a feeling of accomplishment . 
  the energy from le sexy times of the ~ ~ gods ~ ~ scientists powered a great explosion that created all of us !, 
  i do n't think they ever claimed to be though ... / r/truegaming is the self proclaimed `` intelligent '' games board . 
  / r/games is just / r/gaming without memes/images . 
  read constructive or any praiseworthy adjectives from devs talking nicely about piracy as `` opinion i liked '', 
  i know they had a lot of complaints last time they switched their design but i think they 're going to get a whole lot more criticism this time . 
  i emailed them about the hyperlink issue so hopefully they respond . 
  wow . 
  you 've blown my mind , i think i 've finally taken the blue pill now !, 
  the only problem is she was at the bus stop and i 've never seen her since , but next time i 'll `` force love to happen '' since i want it . 
  i do n't think any games board is . 
  `` gamers '' are probably the most entitled consumer demographic out there . 
  our science , who art on reddit, 
  maymays be thy name, 
  thy upvotes come, 
  religious mocking be done, 
  on reddit as it is in facebook, 
  give us today our daily angst, 
  and insult our relatives, 
  as we insult those who mention god,
