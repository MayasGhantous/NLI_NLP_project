  and lead us not into circlejerking, 
  and deliver us from the theists, 
  for science is the logic , the reason and the bravery, 
  for ever and ever, 
  fuck god, 
  why would pop stars have anything to do with them ? 
  apparently kanye west is in the illuminati as well . 
  politicians i understand why they make it up for them as they have real power , but pop stars ? 
  except he 's not . 
  now that he 's in his second term could n't he come out and say he did n't believe in god ? 
  he supports gay marriage which is equally as unpopular among conservatives . 
  he 's a self proclaimed christian and it 's stupid to call him something he 's not , when there 's very little proof pointing to it . 
  i would n't call that brainwashing . 
  is getting rewards for being an employee `` brainwashing '' for being a better member in your company ? 
  or getting candy for getting good grades ? 
  i take it did n't worship an effigy of george bush like in the film , because that is brainwashing . 
  the average sunday school is n't , but that extreme evangelical crap in the film is . 
  oh i would n't doubt that it 's possible , it 's just i 've seen no evidence pointing to him being one . 
  it just seems like wishful thinking from atheists , the same as right wingers wish he was a muslim . 
  oh wow , you live in kabul ? 
  care to do an ama or something ? 
  i visited london for two weeks and saw plenty of jews . 
  i think it depends on where you are . .

  but there 's conclusive proof that things like the holocaust happened and you still have nutters denying them . 
  people will believe whatever they want to believe ... the flat earth society comes to mind as well . 
  truly the faith of a child !, 
  his status comforts my weary soul .

  [ it 's odd how the guy above you got downvoted . 
  i 'm pretty sure he was agreeing with what you were saying ] ( / ooc ), 
  this is by far the reason rather than `` all muslims do it !!! '', 
  the problem is when uneducated muslims come to western nations like the uk and want to impose their sharia law on the country . 
  the nation already has a superior justice system , keep mosque and state separate thank you very much, 
  i 'm always sick of seeing this myth sprouted . 
  he was n't excommunicated for teaching the earth revolves round the sun , but for calling the pope ( who iniitally supported him ) an idiot . 
  he called the pope ( his ex-friend ) an idiot in a public pamphlet at a time which the papal states were at war and the pope really did n't need bad pr . 
  and despite being asked for a bit of tact beforehand . 
  and not that the pope , as one of his main sponsors at that time , may have expected a bit more respect in any case . 
  ( life lesson : calling your boss a dick does n't go down well . 
  ) science was n't a thing and there was no such thing as a scientist , just observation of the natural world and natural philosophy . 
  and that there was no such thing as `` doing science '' for the `` advancement '' of man . 
  people work for their own ends and do things for personal reasons beyond fighting `` for '' science `` against '' ignorance.galileo tried to overturn what was a millennium of well-respected and generally held truths about geo-centrism ( which could accurately predict a whole range of cosmic events accurately ) with what was a modified child 's toy . 
  the pope asks him to write the book :, 
  pope urban viii had personally asked galileo to give arguments for and against heliocentrism in the book, 
  he writes the book and makes the defender of the church a man named `` simplicio '' which also means simpleton :, 
  simplicio , the defender of the aristotelian geocentric view in dialogue concerning the two chief world systems , was often caught in his own errors and sometimes came across as a fool . 
  indeed , although galileo states in the preface of his book that the character is named after a famous aristotelian philosopher ( simplicius in latin , simplicio in italian ) , the name `` simplicio '' in italian also has the connotation of `` simpleton '', 
  finally he makes the pope look like a fool :, 
  galileo put the words of urban viii into the mouth of simplicio, 
  this is what lead to his trial . 
  the pope was already being seen as `` soft on defending the church '' and had the spanish cardinal aiming for his throne so to speak . 
  which sucks because the pope was considered `` a friend and admirer of galileo , and had opposed the condemnation of galileo in 1616 . '', 
  and was trying to get the idea of heliocentrism to be more accepted . 
  even though he 's probably not joking ( and probably racist ) muslims do have one of the highest birth rates out of any religious group that emigrate to countries . 
  the long intro and sound of dialogue in okami just flat out sucks . 
  i felt like i could almost fall asleep during the 25 minutes of learning the backstory when there was nothing exciting about it . 
  the sound of the gods and characters chirping away was just horrible , it was like they layered 3 different voices on top of each other . 
  i kinda liked wind wakers myself , only because they built such an impressive world . 
  then again i think i did it with a walkthrough ... 
  yeah that sucked but i found that the midget george washingtons were easiest killed in melee . 
  hacking away at them was more effective than using your gun . 
  the only time i turned down the difficulty was the elizabeths mother battle , i found it really hard . 
  oh man phantom hourglass . 
  i ended up quitting the game because of that stupid last dungeon , i spent hours on it . 
  unfortunately pauls verse condemning homosexuality applies to christians . 
  leviticus is a book of `` jewish law '' written for jews to follow , not gentile christians . 
  it 's not that they ignore it , it 's that it was n't written for them , which is why it 's ridiculous hearing right wingers quoting the verse from leviticus that was n't even written for them to follow . 
  i think you misunderstand that verse . 
  the law still applies to those who are n't under the `` new covenant '' e.g those who are n't christians . 
  jesus `` fulfilled '' the law ( meaning it is complete through his sacrifice and no longer necessary to folllow ) for those who accept the new covenant . 
  also the books of jewish law were never written for gentiles ( non jews ) to follow . 
  it 's hardly a cop out , you just need to look at context and the target audience ( jesus was addressing jews at the time he was talking about the law in this verse . 
  he would n't even address gentiles about it because they all knew that jewish law was not to be followed by non jews ), 
  i 'm pretty sure he does `` protest '' as he 's a lgbt activist that is working for the best to change the views on homosexuality in his and other churches . 
  ** oppression !, 
  the rate of birth defects is incredibly high in incestuous relationships . 
  even if they do n't want children if the woman gets pregnant ( even if safe sex is practiced ) it is unfair for the child born and also the rate of childbirth fatalities is much higher as well . 
  another thing to consider is just how much damage it will cause to the relationship between family members . 
  parents could cut off ties to children and other siblings would be disgusted . 
  i have n't watched a lot of anime myself but i find i often ca n't do it without an english dub . 
  the cutesy girls voices used are just so cringeworthy sometime i ca n't watch it . 
  having said that i 've watched several anime movies that i loved . 
  try watching anything from studio ghibli . 
  spirited away would be in my top 10 favourite films of all time it 's a work of art . 
  i also recommend cowboy bebop and full metal alchemist for anime tv series . 
  both have exciting plots and are very well developed . 
  i also recently watched an anime about a boy struggling with transgender issues that was incredibly mature for the medium . 
  i think at first glance like a lot of western cartoons a lot of the medium seems immature but your bound to find something that suits your taste . 
  every one i know who had watched ghibli loves it so try there first . 
  your example of the 360 does n't represent all consoles . 
  sony and nintendo now have favourable policies to indie devs . 
  if your point was merely the 360 then i would agree with you , the 10000 dollar update policy is beyond ridiculous . 
  ultimately it all comes down to financial . 
  consoles have a much larger target audience than pcs and are less prone to piracy .
