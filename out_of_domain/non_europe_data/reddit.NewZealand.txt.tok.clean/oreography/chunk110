  i was so certain this was a joke until i saw redpillschool set it up . 
  lets not forget walking . 
  there 's a group of old ladies that walk up and down northlands every week for excercise . 
  there 's more freedom in that fountain than there is in lady liberty . 
  while i do n't agree with sanitariums charitable status it 's ridiculous to say they 'll `` pull a jonestown '' . 
  vegetarianism is an important part of their faith . 
  would you accuse a buddhist charitable `` whole foods '' company of pulling a jonestown ? 
  yeah definitely . 
  i only had just juice and barley sugars for fourty eight hours !, 
  do you know how painful it is to walk past a takeaway shop at 7pm and not be able to order a meal . 
  do you ? 
  do you ? 
  i get free money for being 1/16th maori . 
  there 's no taxation without representation . 
  if you want to keep church and state separate then taxing them is a bad idea as it leads to more religious representation in government . 
  so i was standing in a rather long line at my blacksmiths in skyrim when along came a little old kahijit who was waiting for his axe to be sharpened . 
  i 'm pretty ugly , slightly obese and have a neckbeard but this guy is even more different than me , a gypsy furry hybrid who i can take out all my angst and sexual repression out on . 
  i was raising my dagger when suddenly the local priest showed up to get some metalwork done on his icons . 
  `` you going to kill him , nukethedivine ? '', 
  `` no , i , uh ... '', 
  `` killing is sinful '', 
  `` yes i er ... . '', 
  the kahifreak walked off and i was stuck waiting for the lady blacksmith ( who should n't even be working in that profession ) to finish my weapon . 
  `` sorry pal , it 's 3000 septim '', 
  `` but i only have 2950 '', 
  `` the price is fixed , sorry '', 
  i thought playing a videogame would change how i see women . 
  turns out they 're always bitches , even the virtual ones . 
  it 's up to your carrier . 
  check with them . 
  i know this is probably frowned upon but will the new software be pirateable ? 
  will there be some sort of reverse engineering that can get rid of the activation , since the software itself is n't hosted in the cloud and it 's only cloud features that are added . 
  thousands of aspiring web designers use pirated versions of dreamweaver , photoshop etc and then buy the software , or work for a company that buys it once they have enough experience . 
  le me !, 
  ( i wish ), 
  i 'm still convinced it was a parody by a sidehugger . 
  he had no previous posting history, 
  i think it still follows the general reddit ratio of being predominantly male . 
   mfw you did n't get dv 'd in bh for gt !, 
  case study of laissez faire moderation : / r/atheism . 
  people might not like rules but the alternative is meme flooded crap . 
  i do n't know about that . 
  the lumia 920 had comparable specs to the s3 , and the camera quality was better . 
  everybody pirate tv shows !!, 
  fuck advertisers !!, 
  hey man , not cool !, 
  reddit needs the ads to survive !!, 
  actually more like a 320gb hard drive with 160gbs pre installed software on it ... 
  it 's better than that but it does n't stop people being smug, 
  no atheist ever converted to a reliigon and the ones that say they did were fundie concern trolls . 
  other responses ( 1 ), 
  omg freedom of le speech !!!!, 
  jews are literally all the 1 %, 
  speak american commie !, 
  sweet sagan he has a book called `` neckbeard uprising . '', 
  my life is complete . 
  personally i think creative cloud is a good option to have bit i do n't think it should be the only option . 
  no those are great open source tools . 
  gimp is n't . 
  you 're taking his arguments as a character attack against you . 
  i think creative cloud is a good model but it should n't be the only option they offer . 
  and they 're bound to put the price up eventually, 
  oh my god . 
  comparing using linux to restoring democracy . 
  it 's beautiful . 
  what country did you come from ? 
  i thought it was pretty well known most places . 
  i would n't read that much into it . 
  he 's a committed christian as are most of us on sidehugs . 
  even though we joke about the faith we 're still all very much believers . 
  he was just pointing out how the word `` euphoric '' is viewed on reddit now after we were bestowed with a visit by a professional quote maker . 
  in the still small moments and in the raging constipation , you are here with me, 
  does n't quite sound as good ... 
  why not ** indulge ** yourself . 
  with enough posessions you can ** buy salvation **, 
  i am the antipope !!, 
  heil mary !!!, 
  heil mary !!!!, 
  no they do n't believe in jesus christ as christ means messiah . 
  by believe i assume he meant as a god . 
  his analogy was that christianity is the chocolate in chocolate cookies whereas judaism is a plain cookie . 
  you ca n't argue why is there chocolate in a chocolate cookie if you do n't recognize that the cookie has changed . 
  you see it as a bastardized version of a plain cookie and wo n't listen to the people that prefer chocolate ones because you 're refusing to see it as a fundamentally different cookie and there arguments do n't count . 
  no not necessarily , but generally the deepest games on the platform are all ports . 
  gta , final fantasy 3 etc. 
  i ca n't think of any exclusive game to android that is an original title . 
  i generally play gba games on android anyways . 
  what country specifically ? 
  no but even not for profit , the majority of piracy is n't small time sharing , it 's public torrenting and file hosting of copyright infringing content that make up the majority of `` piracy '' . 
  look at what happens in countries like china where copyright is completely avoided . 
  artists make no sales , because there 's no obligation to pay . 
  ** counterjerking sexist atheist white male : ** see / u/electricg, 
  i 'm sure his scripture knowledge would have me beat . 
  i do n't get the love of offensive usernames on reddit . 
  i mean , there 's the lame joke in the defaults that if you have an offensive name people get upvotes for calling you out on it , but if you 're not a troll what 's the point in having an offensive name for the sake of it ? 
  i 'd appreciate it if you were n't here just to find drama to post to srd . 
  this is a pretty small community and if you do n't frequent / r/sidehugs or / r/christianity you probably wo n't get a lot of what we 're talking about anyways . 
  i 'm sorry but you just seem to take this a little too personally, 
  i think the reason people do preorder is what you discussed discounts , exclusive content , dlc etc. 
  and they 're guarantueed to have a game they want the day it comes out .
