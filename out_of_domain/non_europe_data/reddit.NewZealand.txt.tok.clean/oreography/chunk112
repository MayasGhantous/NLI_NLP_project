  and then here http://www.reddit.com/r/openbroke/comments/1ee4t9/on_reddit_and_tolerance_of_misogyny/, 
  both are deleted, 
  what exactly is the point of this ? 
  http://en.last-video.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/obama-in-rain-memorial-day.jpg here 's a shot of obama in the rain speaking publicly without an umbrella . 
  this is just cheap and petty and distracting this sub from proper issues . 
  ah ill have to look into your book . 
  i would n't put it as a hit piece though , it 's actually very well sourced and her distaste for maos rule largely stemmed from her living under it . 
  i 'll make sure to add pantsov to my reading list though , i appreciate you relying . 
  he did say a throwaway did n't he ? 
  it was pretty big in nz and australia, 
  only / r/gotthescoop, 
  i prefer www.satanisamonkey.com, 
  look at the `` christians views on hell '' article on wikipedia to get a better idea , there 's no concise view of hell in all christian denominations either , there is n't a hell at all in the old testament/judaism personally i do n't believe that hell is eternal suffering and in your question the popular image of hell/satan actually comes from dantes `` the divine comedy '' and miltons paradise lost . 
  the game show ? 
  you mean we can be heroes ? 
  that 's the best one . 
  haha he 's dissapointed the kpop group members are christian . 
  what , in the uk ? 
  you guys have great prices . 
  in nz it 's round 10 pounds more on average for new titles . 
  one of the last good xbla exclusives that has n't been ported . 
  would be nice if splosion man and shadow complex were n't still exclusives . 
  i 'd say the `` you do n't remember , you do n't remember '' part of paranoid android before it goes into the solo is one of the best moments of any song . 
  if you have n't see the performance on jools holland back in 97 , just amazing . 
  this, 
  oh wow this is pretty popular , so much side hugging going on !, 
  namer confirmed for jewluminati sith lord !!!!!, 
  nsfc discussion ends right now !!!, 
  you need some mountain dew and a slayer shirt before you become a true keyboard warrior . 
  yes it will work , will be good to have a spare stylus wherever you go as well . 
  and the dream cast , though to be fair the only reason it had sales is because it did come out before the ps2, 
  ie 10 is pretty good actually . 
  will be far better than the ps4 and wii u browsers if having full support by ms, 
  well recently it has n't . 
  the 360s and newer ps3s backwards compatibility, 
  is n't that great . 
  it seems nintendo is the one keeping it alive with the 3ds and wii u now . 
  when i heard windows would be running on the one i got really excited thinking the device would basically be the next `` steam box '' , running all your old emulators , latest pc games and could run your entire media library , until i realized it was rt. 
  all it will do is run windows apps . 
  i think the device will have a lot of potential if hackers can get a full version of win 8 running on it , then it will be the steam box we 've been waiting for . 
  as in web apps exclusive to the platform or creating normal websites ? 
  ie10 is pretty much standards compliant now , they 've really upped their game in the latest releases . 
  now we only have to support ie8 + , ie8 is still backwards but it 's far better than 6 + 7 were . 
  ie6 was web des helll . 
  i 'm pretty sure reddits owners want more users , which / r/atheism is n't helping with . 
  people would have less issue with it if either, 
  - / u/skeen gets removed and lets the rest of the mod team clear it up , removing memes and making it more like / r/trueatheism or a general sub to discuss aspects of religion . 
  - or they keep posting shitty memes , but it 's removed as a default . 
  ** oppression !!!, 
  do n't they do that every day ? 
  poor mr gerbrave who has never been to oklahoma has to suffer the nerve of fundies praying for a tragedy in the country where it happened while he sits in his million dollar london house , that he earned through scientific acheivements on twitter . 
  ## donate or pray , pick one fundies !, 
  this this this !!!, 
  prayer is for pussies , not patriots . 
  i pledge allegiance to one nation , under logic , reason and being an asshole on the internet !!!, 
  something something anime . 
  the sad thing is the christian right in the states has a persecution complex so when they lose their religious privileges they claim it is `` oppression '' when clearly its not . 
  however to be an outspoken christian in many middle eastern northern african or communist nations you face real oppression , ultimately it can even be a death sentence . 
  i know most muslims are n't salafist or extreme but unfortunately they tend to defend or promote fheir faith with violence at a disproportionate rate to other religions . 
  i heard muhammed did n't even support gay marriage back in ad 620 . 
  what a bigoted conservitard . 
  well duh , they 're all corporate slave houses run by greedy conservative bosses . 
  ~ ~ hitler ~ ~ breivik did nothing wrong . 
  you toked the kush ? 
  fak u autsin , u not circlebs ... but you should be . 
  a lot of debate in there , and an / r/christianity mod chimes in too . 
  the `` pastor '' who in his comment history spends most of his time on / r/atheism , / r/wtf and / r/technology seems a bit suspect . 
  / r/christianity definitely has flaws though , as / r/brokehugs points out but i find it hard to believe anyone other than recent atheist converts would say / r/atheism has better discussion/is less of a circlejerk . 
  do you even valve ? 
  hey man , steam has launched with like 50 games on linux . 
  then almighty gaben will launch the steam box running gentoo and everyone will move to linux and abandon micro $ $ oft !!!, 
  just wait guys , the year of the ~ ~ linux desktop ~ ~ steam box is coming !, 
  i read an article on the last book in the harry potter series and there were so many parellels to christs life and resurrection in it . 
  i never really understood the whole `` jk rowling is working for satan ! '', 
  crap when she herself is a practicing christian . 
  except it 's not just the same views , it 's the same content reposted over and over again . 
  there 's only so much you can talk about how you do n't do something for it to get extremely repetitive . 
  [ * when even unitarian universalists have too much doctrine * ** it 's time to make the switch ** ] ( / / #rollins ), 
  i would usually say `` if you do n't like it , do n't buy it '' but with the reddit gamer mentality there will be people asking if they can 3d print it soon to stick it to the man . 
  / r/fundies, 
  oh absolutely , but the arab world has been in intellectual stagnation since the siege of baghdad . 
  ever since then it has been the west ( and china/eastern asia ) that has intellectually flourished . 
  really ? 
  there were some great songs but the album felt disjointed and lacked any real cohesion . 
  navarros guitar style was different to frusciante 's as well which worked on some songs ( my friends ) but others it just sounded off for the chilli peppers . 
  abortions should be legal until the age of 3 ? 
  that 's not an abortion , that 's called child murder . 
  try the episcopalian church . 
  uu is super liberal but episcopalians have sound theology etc but are liberal pro gay rights etc, 
  this is probably the worst analogy i 've ever read . 
  i believe the anglican church ( which is the original english branch ) has a large presence in africa and is more conservative . 
  from my understanding the episcopal church is only the american branch and more liberal . 
  is n't stryper ultra preachy cheesy metal . 
  i do n't listen to much but august burns red , underoath , devil wears prada etc are better regarded . 
  words are far more than sounds with links to what they signify , words have meanings that you ca n't easily redefine or ignore . 
  if you 're listening to a french album and ca n't interpret the music it would n't offend you but listening in english to something like cannibal corpse where the lyrics are objectively offensive ( rape , murder etc ) then they do affect how you relate to them . 
  even better , alternet !, 
  i think you 'll be disappointed sadly ... unlike at olive garden ^ tm where not only breadsticks but soups and salads are unlimited and at affordable prices . 
  it was at the moment i rubbed my rainbow badge that carl degrasse nye appeared at the hospital . 
  `` hey muhammed illogicamcbrownshit , you see this ?
