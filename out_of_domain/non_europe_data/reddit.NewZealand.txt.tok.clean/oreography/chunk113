  this is a certified badge of being a scientist . 
  420 flame the bundle , peace out ! '', 
  this is such a cool story to be honest , i really like it when someone is on the border of going fundi-nuts and sees the light xd . 
  do n't forget an ephebophilic misunderstood genius who could have got good grades but never tried . 
  we pronounce it as `` oppression '', 
  chrono cross - say what you want about the game but the soundtrack made it incredible playing through . 
  also kingdom hearts - they nailed the soundtrack on pretty much all games in the series . 
  also [ chrono cross ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=923fvddwaho ), 
  there was one guy that did an ama a while ago who spent years writing strategy guides for gamefaqs . 
  he had the top guides of all the final fantasy ones , ca n't remember his name though . 
  here 's a video of it running https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oripayqjztg, 
  and here 's where to download the files https://www.lonelycoder.com/redmine/projects/showtime/wiki/ps3_usage_guide, 
  oh i 'm sorry , i thought it would just be game downloads/links that were forbidden . 
  i should have read the sidebar . 
  so fucking brave, 
  grouperfish delivers . 
  playing gamecube with a 360 controller just feels wrong though . 
  i 've played with dolphin before , but it 's easy enough hooking a hard drive into a softmodded wii and playing on tv . 
  ##### come on down to ron paul town , where we play with balls and turn frowns around !, 
  what libyan planes were shot down ? 
  i heard that if you try playing pirated games micro $ $ $ oft calls the police and takes you to jail !, 
  dae newest new super wii mario u bros wii u ? 
  man what an original and exciting title !, 
  there 's actually a unfinished alpha/demo of it i played . 
  it 's basicaly just one room you can move around in , but you get an idea of movement and a rough idea of what graphics would have looked like . 
  i heard the ps2 version was better than the ps3/360 for controls . 
  just get a wii u in a few years , when the game library 's bigger . 
  well it 's on 3ds as well which is definitely worth owning now . 
  hopefully the 3ds version is good . 
  it 's not super meat boy 's `` propoganda '' it 's really just a fact that controllers suit platformers more . 
  no rts/strategy and mmos are the other big ones . 
  the most obvious `` top spec is n't the winner '' argument is in the handhelds with sony and nintendo . 
  the ds clearly won last gen even if the psp did quite well , and this gen the 3ds is eating up sales with fantastic games while stores ca n't get rid of their vitas . 
  i do n't think the wii u is going to die . 
  people will buy it when it gets good games , it 's just the game library is lacking at the moment . 
  do you know what board you 're in ? 
  of course the wii u has more games out now than the unreleased consoles , but the unreleased consoles have more games scheduled to come out and will come out . 
  i think the wii u has potential but the fact remains that there are n't that many first party nintendo games out for it now ( which is the reason most people buy nintendo consoles ) . 
  backwards compatibilty does n't change the fact the console itself has few games , if you 're using that argument then my backwards compatible ps3 has more games it than any other console ever . 
  how many 2d platformers are pc exclusives ? 
  there really are n't many , simply because the developers know that the console owners are guarantueed better hardware ( a controller ) to play the game with . 
  it 's the same reason you see so few strategy titles on console , the experience is hampered because the platform does n't have the ideal hardware to run it . 
  the translation was much better though . 
  can we all do it together ? 
  like a big brave atheist family ? 
  ### fundie alert !!, 
  somebody call / r/antiatheismwatch, 
  edit : they already did, 
  `` interesting . 
  really about the only moderation i 'd like to see is a crackdown on trolls . 
  ** if [ 1 ] / r/atheism starts doing things like filter memes , police attitudes , or police relevance it 'll completely destroy the sub ** . 
  i really do n't give a shit that [ 2 ] / r/atheism is the black sheep of reddit . 
  it says more about the rest of reddit than it does about [ 3 ] / r/atheism . 
  the only real difference between [ 4 ] / r/atheism and most the other default subs is the topic . '', 
  so i was browsing in a rather large thread at my local reddit request today behind a couple moderators that i know from when i was in the meta subs years ago . 
  it was the only / r/atheism request open so there was n't even time to get my 12 pack of reddit gold for a karma party i was heading to . 
  i was wondering why the thread was going nowhere when i decided to scroll down to see what the holdup was . 
  it was a little old / u/skeen who did n't have enough time to mod and he was trying to talk the admins into letting him get away with never modding . 
  this struck me as odd until i found out he was a mere 3 months short of his last logon . 
  now all these circlejerkers were trying to get him removed and there were even two making fun of her . 
  i walked up and gave a downvote to the thread and handed / u/skeen some reddit gold and told him to keep the change . 
  one of the middle aged circlejerkers ( i knew these people , so i also knew that they all make over 6000 karma ) grabbed her kid and yelled very loudly , `` see that man ? 
  he 's acting just / u.jij wants us to mod . 
  lel 420 flame the bundle '' for some reason this set me off , so i turned around . 
  i have n't gone on reddit in awhile so i 'm rocking some old flair , mod / r/slayer , and / r/mountaindew , so it must have been a nice sight . 
  very loudly , i said `` like / u/jij ? 
  ma'am i 'm a an atheist who makes minimum moderation and i was the one who stepped up to stop / u/skeens removal ? 
  your hypocritical moderation is an inspiration to us all . '', 
  as i stormed out , a couple of / r/antiatheismwatch started to whistle and cheer , soon their subscribers joined in and even / r/atheism subscribers . 
  i gave a wave and logged off with a feeling of accomplishment .

  [ oh man do n't stop the copypasta in the mothership guys . 
  that one guy `` questioning '' it is beautiful . 
  this is possibly the end of an era guys , since / u/skeen is now gone . 
  why do n't they get this into their stupid hollow heads ? 
  would you `` think of the children '' or `` be empathetic '' if hitler was a ~ ~ christian ~ ~ child !!!, 
  still have to make your site responsive to touch and keyboard and mouse too though . 
  the last two are on ps3 too . 
  soul sacrifice , uncharted , persona and gravity rush are about the only tempting exclusives, 
  oh god the soundtrack is amazing . 
  one of the only ones i 've purchased . 
  to think the game was done in rpg maker is so impressive . 
  are n't we all ... 
  i think it 's common knowledge is n't it ? 
  how many donations do you think the piratebay would get ?
