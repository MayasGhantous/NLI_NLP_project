  lol so dum they get sick . 
  what idiots . 
  i bet they 're literally next door neighbours !, 
  still is actually part of france . 
  i was going to name new caledonia + tahiti until i realised they 're under french control as well . 
  you can play the original titles via hdmi on 360 though ... 
  i 've been thinking about getting a hacked 360 mostly just for original titles !, 
  i largely agree with you and i think there 's real hypocricy on the part of people online getting really angry at microsoft when sony has many of the same loathed features on their console . 
  ( i think sony has just had better pr on the issue . . ) but i really dislike the inability to turn off kinect . 
  to have a camera that 's always active and always recording your useage patterns is just unsettling . 
  even for a device like a smartphone camera which is more necessary , you are able to turn it off . 
  why ca n't we do the same with kinect ? 
  i think people `` loved steam '' for the reason that pc gaming was a lot more complex before they came along . 
  having the convenience of all updates/patches/bug fixes ( which for years had been necessary and was a real hassle when playing a game for the first time ) done for you made things easier and people switched to digital because of the convenience and benefits/community it provided . 
  console gaming has only recently gotten patches etc for online , but you can still play a game offline without recent patches . 
  it has always been easier than pc gaming and game `` collecting '' is prevalent for most consoles , never really for pc . 
  i also hate the digital only future because the world is n't equipped for it yet . 
  until everyone has fiber/decent internet speeds nobody wants online authentication/always online . 
  what about the whole debacle with securom . 
  it was considered `` spyware '' and yet publicly traded companies used it for drm . 
  have you got a source that the camera or mic can be disabled ? 
  i think that would relieve a lot of people as to the whole `` spying ' issue , as there 's a whole lot of misinformation/fear mongering . 
  except that requires the entire console to be turned off, 
  seeking to allay fears , microsoft has confirmed that both the xbox one and its kinect - which is required for the console to function - can be shut down completely . 
  `` yes , you can turn the system completely off , '' a microsoft rep told kotaku . 
  `` this would use no power and turn everything off . 
  i do n't think anyone doubted that you could shut down kinect by turning the console off , but it still seems as long as the console is on kinect ca n't be turned off . 
  it has gotten a bit old recently . 
  the whole fedora and junkfood thing has some truth , but we need some new in jokes . 
  and god almighty has the `` euphoric '' thing been jerked into oblivion . 
  the worst example of this ever was the `` how i imagine rage comics look like on / r/christianity '' post , making a `` stupider '' rage comic ( cuz they all are amirite ? ), 
  despite the rule that there are n't any rage comics/memes allowed there . 
  almost everyone called him out , but it really shows how weak your arguments are if you have to resort to hypotheticals to defend your sub . 
  if you want to play it so much just buy a ps3 . 
  there will always be good exclusives you do n't get on pc . 
  wo n't that just burn it into the bottom more ? 
  as a definitely not `` paid by admins shill '', 
  ** this **, 
  go with www.namecheap.com, 
  i think the majority of people upvoting this just want to ogle at naked ladies . 
  when they find out that they have to see old men and obese women naked , then it 's not so neat . 
  [ * oh wait , never mind you do n't exist * ] ( / / #atheism ), 
  thank you for the second tip , think letting the oil heat up before i add the food is something i 'll take on board . 
  i do n't think my pan is too thin , but i 'll definitely take the advice on board . 
  and pay the townsfolk with upvotes ? 
  i can imagine a few people dumb enough , namely the 1440 upvoters and the op on / r/atheism, 
  i bet that guy wears a fedora !, 
  the official term is `` ethnoreligious '', 
  no problem , hope you get good use out of it . 
  nothing . 
  it 's the pornography , lust and sexualization of women that usually goes along with it that 's considered harmful . 
  it 's alright , we all make mistakes . 
  cheap jokes are n't really encouraged here though . 
  oh come on , a couple centuries ago is exxagerating . 
  more like 2 decades ago, 
  that 's fucking stupid , i 'm sorry . 
  love is neccessary to raise a human child and robots ca n't provide it . 
  this entire idea that stripping out gender and even humanity from raising children will produce the same results is absurd . 
  why do you think zoos have n't thought of the `` robot parent '' idea ? 
  because it does n't work . 
  ## finally . 
  evidence of true oppression , courtesy of the peer reviewed and highly esteemed `` ragebuilder.com '', 
  [ oh my god , i thought this was oc too . 
  replace `` fundie '' with militant atheist and you probably have more truth ] ( / ooc ), 
  seriously equivocating `` android marriage and android adoption '' to gay marriage and adoption even as a joke makes you look stupid , not me . 
  empathy is n't a `` logical process '' or something that you can distill into a piece of computer code . 
  i think we just have a difference of opinion over what humanity and human nature mean . 
  the idea that you can simply program love or empathy into a robot is the most ridiculous thing i 've heard in a while though , sorry . 
  do you think every emotion and thought is logical ? 
  you guys have some of the best cathedrals too . 
  i sometimes wish i had a cathedral to worship in as beautiful as notre dame and the ones in italy . 
  i think that 's what he 's talking about . 
  benedictine , chartreuse and a lot of different liqueurs and beers were invented by catholic monks . 
  i think you 're all pretty cool . 
  i disagree with several policies of the catholic church , and the need for a pope but admire the strength and faith of the institution . 
  also the real sense of worldwide community is something beautiful , even though we 're all brothers and sisters in christ the catholic community exemplifies this . 
  also the churches/traditions are beautiful . 
  sorry about your loss , oh wait , no i 'm not . 
  fascism is alive in america . 
  this really puts things in perspective, 
  if only we had more sources than alternet and / r/liberalreality showing the truth . 
  yeah , your compliment was a little weird man . 
  i doubt it, 
  aside from from cosmetic differences 2000 has more ram video out and a better screen . 
  between 2000 and 3000 the only real difference is 3000 has a microphone . 
  go has the inbuilt storage , no umd and bluetooth . 
  * neveuurghhhhh le ftfy, 
  it seems to mostly be cosmetic rather than changing functionality . 
  they 're the best resource for ps1 + ps2 saves which is what i mostly use it for . 
  [ * writing vaguely about love  philosophy * ] ( / / #bell ), 
  [ meta ] i thought the ama was really interesting and those pro death of god and against it had good points . 
  your theological views are challenged and shaped all the time , and a better more refined faith comes out of it . 
  do n't be so harsh on yourself carl . 
  the entire new testament can basically be summed up to `` god cares and loves us '' so much so he himself reduced himself to a mere mortal and died as an exchange for us to live together with him . 
  he cared so much that he sacrificed himself in order for us to be with him . 
  that 's where he 's getting it from . 
  if atheist had their way , bla bla bla big generalization comparison to dictators and something something bad !!, 
  he is n't wanting a discussion , he just wants to make his point . 
  this whole thread has people discussing things . 
  i 'd be happy for russia to see a return to a ceremonial tsardom .
