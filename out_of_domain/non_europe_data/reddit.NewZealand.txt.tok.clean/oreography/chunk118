  ### i think this maymay touched me in the no no way, 
  mario kart and smash bros for wii u i believe . 
  there is a power in memes and facebook screenshots that is going unrecognized, 
  literall this, 
  ugh , this is not sounding good for ms. 
  these policies are going to lead to a backlash by the average consumer ( who actually matters to them ) rather than just core gamers . 
  ugh , in real bad taste . 
  a good move removing it on their part . 
  i heard recently they 're quite strict about reporting copyright infringements , have you had any experience with that ? 
  if we get fiber in chch i 'd switch to them as their rates are way better than slingshots . 
  do you have a home phone with them as well ? 
  [ you were downvoted because you did n't ooc ( out of circlejerk ) you type [ your text ] ( / ooc ) ( without the gap in the backspace ) to do it ] ( / ooc ), 
  has their been conformation that it 's region locked ? 
  because you could always import one if that was n't the case, 
  gamer entitlement, 
  they also are very strong on retaining those freedoms . 
  there were massive protests last year against changes to the education system . 
  project spark looks amazing, 
  think there 's a typo under zoo tycon . 
  you 've put kinect , also 360, 
  i do n't care if i 'm downvoted , i would literally buy that . 
  plz pray for the `` fundie suburbun mum '' maymay . 
  i 'm resorting to text post because the fascist mods here wo n't let me post them . 
  that said, 
  top line : believes in god, 
  bottom line : is an idiot, 
  he criticized / r/atheism not atheists . 
  thankfully that sub does n't represent most atheists , otherwise people would have a very low opinion of the average atheist . 
  praying for / u/jij . 
  get it , you , u. ... i 'll show myself out . 
  #### oppression !!!!, 
  keats you 're brilliant !, 
  he 's a troll , stop giving him attention, 
  come on versus and last guardian !, 
  ### oh my god kingdom hearts 3 and final fantasy xv . 
  have my babies square !!!, 
  i can honestly only see microsoft cancelling the 24 hour/account system after this . 
  it 's just going to backfire on them . 
  i thought it was unkarted !, 
  haha brilliant, 
  all you need to play them is a psp , a ps2 and a 3ds . 
  birth by sleep - ps3, 
  kh1 ps2, 
  kh re chain of memories ps2, 
  dream drop distance , 358/2 days , coded 3ds, 
  kh2 - ps2, 
  four whole upvotes . 
  is this man a god ? 
  christian metal is pretty well regarded actually . 
  contemporary stuff yeah , definitely . 
  / r/hipand50, 
  / r/hipand50, 
  inspiring . 
  who else wants to get out of this fascist hellhole to enjoy true democratic freedoms in china ? 
  confirmed and flaired, 
  apparently the salvation army issued a press statement rejecting his comments, 
  unfortunately this would only happen once 99 % of people become secular atheists who believe in science , logic , and reason . 
  once that happens , almost all wars would stop , trillions of dollars would be freed up for welfare and science , and we could start colonizing the galaxy . 
  this is why once atheism becomes accepted as fact , and theism is treated as the mental illness that it is , there should be a 3 step program to secure the scientific advancement of the human race . 
  rehabilitation . 
  teach the fundies how their god is not real . 
  i think this would be successful for at least 90 % of the cases . 
  sterilization . 
  if people do n't renounce their religion they should be sterilized . 
  this way , they die alone and wo n't be able to spread their stupidity to children and out breed atheists . 
  this would prevent an idiocracy situation from occurring . 
  imprisonment . 
  if there are still people preaching their religion after this they should be thrown in either an asylum or in a prison . 
  they can make license plates for cars after that along with picking up from trash by the road . 
  only in the worse case scenarios though should a 4th step be implemented ; execution . 
  only after this all happens worldwide will a near utopian society like the one depicted in this family guy episode would be possible . 
  proof of this method working though can be found within any decent history text book about the ussr . 
  despite being a `` dirty communist '' country the ussr transformed from an agrarian society to the first nation in space in a few decades by eradicating theism . 
  the prc also implemented similar policies during the 60s/70s which led to the confiscation of religious property and opened the way to the economic successes of today . 
  likewise , russia 's economic failures during the 90s can be linked to a rise of religion . 
  edit : downvotes really ? 
  it 's sad to see that even in one of the few safe havens for atheists i still have to worry about theists downvoting logical ideas without even a single critique . 
  it 's like a theist removing you as a friend on fb once you explained to them why you should n't thank god for their grandmother 's recovery from cancer . 
  edit 2 : whoa , reddit gold ? 
  awesome !, 
  while a theist might thank god for such a thing , i am intelligent enough to know that it was not an imaginary being who granted me this gift but a human being !, 
  to that person i say thank you . 
  to you and all the other atheists out there who support my ideals in the face of the downvote slaughter by brigading theists i say `` stay strong '' . 
  just like how slave owners called people who wanted to free the slaves and give them equal rights were called `` radicals '' we are called `` extremists '' for wanting to free society of religion . 
  just like these `` radicals '' wanted to strike off the physical shackles of slavery , we at r/atheism are for striking off the mental shackles known as `` religion '' . 
  today , here at r/atheism , we are martyrs , suffering from the persecution of theists trying to suppress logical thought with downvotes . 
  our ideas are the future though no matter how hard these theists shall try to censor them . 
  secular atheism shall triumph and when the galaxy starts to be colonized by mankind it will be done not by christians , hindus , or some other religious group ( and certainly not by muslims ; read r/worldnews if you really do n't know why ) but by atheists . 
  history will be kind to us because we are atheist and therefore truly right and just . 
  all religions will eventually be forgotten but the idea of atheism is eternal . 
  everything is atheist by default so even if religion leads to the extinction of mankind , like it has almost done so many times in the past , the animals and the trees will still know the truth . 
  the truth that there is no god . 
  edit 3 : wow more downvotes but more reddit gold as well !, 
  this is the proof of the resilience of the / r/atheism community that , despite the theistic hordes who come in wave after wave to try and bring us down , we stand together bold and true . 
  thank you whoever gifted me gold , it is people like you who give humanity hope for a better future . 
  edit 4 : holy shit , another reddit gold , third time is the charm !, 
  thank you for the atheist who gifted this to me , it is appreciated . 
  you and other free thinkers are welcomed to join my new subreddit ; / r/atheismdefenseleague . 
  i was inspired to create this subreddit to help counter the effects of anti-atheist meta subs who are responsible for all the downvotes of my comments within this thread . 
  the point of this sub is to help save fellow atheists like myself who get downvote brigaded by meta subs .
