  please help this sub grow . 
  edit 5 : alright , i think this will be my last edit where i address a few things . 
  first , wow i 'm glad our fellow atheists across the pacific ( australia , new zealand , japan , etc ) were able to counter this theist downvote brigade . 
  to them i want to say thank you . 
  however , the fact that it took this long for my comment to rebound though goes to show the demographic shift on reddit that is currently occurring where atheism was the majority belief to theism being the majority belief . 
  this is one of the reasons why i created / r/atheismdefenseleague . 
  however , i have decided to temporarily make it private because it got infiltrated by trolls from various meta subs . 
  to any actual atheists who saw that content , i apologize . 
  on the topic of trolls , i see a lot of people calling me a troll myself . 
  if it 's because of my beliefs that i hold as an atheist then you 're wrong . 
  i am genuine about this . 
  i have also realized that certain phrases that were once accepted by the reddit community have developed connotations that have been hijacked by trolls such as the term `` brave '' . 
  if i used any of those terms i do apologize for my ignorance about their actual meanings . 
  however , i think the general idea of my post is still a good one . 
  theism is indeed a mental disease , as commonly expressed on non-brigaded / r/atheism submissions , and it needs to be stopped . 
  now for some reason people think when i said `` rehabilitation centers '' they think i mean `` concentration camps '' . 
  this is not the case . 
  i was thinking more of schools and libraries participating in properly educating people in life thinking skills that would show them the flaws of religion . 
  i do not support human experimentation and am for most human rights . 
  religion can not be one of them though , just like slavery can not be considered a human right . 
  i honestly find it quite sad though that people who ca n't even argue my points just call me a troll instead . 
  i do n't constantly rattle on about fedoras , mt dew , and other nonsense like the braveryjerk people . 
  these people completely wrecked my subreddit with these garbage memes which is why i made my sub private . 
  so it is actually disingenuous for me to be grouped with this set of retards because my opinions offend theists who ca n't be bothered to argue their points . 
  these opinions are real and supported by many people here as the upvotes and 3 gilds goes to show . 
  i do n't `` hate '' old people for gods sake . 
  i just find 50 year olds badly attempting to emulate young people kind of funny . 
  i can assure you we have verified this, 
  i 'm hoping this is just dlc + online . 
  there 's the possibility of publishers region locking their titles as well like they did with persona 4 arena on ps3, 
  if they did this ( with a keyboard attachment for the gamepad , turning it into a mini laptop ) they would run out of wii us to sell . 
  i do n't think it was that bad but they really need some better third party games on the system . 
  the 3ds is completely overwhelming the wii u, 
  i agree that it sucks but sony 's service is cheaper , offers you games and benefits and is n't needed for other online services like netflix, 
  yeah unless the wii u pulls out some amazing titles it looks like it 's going the way of the gamecube ,, 
  lost you as a potential customer counts less than losing an actual customer . 
  most of the good exclusives for ps4 will have good single player anyways , if you choose to actually ever get one . 
  i think i 'm just ignoring the subject . 
  i 've seen every thread a million times, 
  well it outputs them to 1080p . . 
  i personally do n't think sony underwhelmed . 
  there 's all the indie titles , all the multiplats ( watch dogs , destiny , kingdom hearts , ) and then final fantasy xv , infamous , killzone etc. 
  well remember they did state that in 2013-2014 there were 140 ps4 games in development with 40 exclusives . 
  that 's quite a few though i agree for launch xbox one probably has better exclusives . 
  the main title for one that i was interested in was project spark but that 's also on pc . 
  who was the mod ? 
  i imagine he 'd probably be fired over it, 
  www.nzgameshop.com is great for importing uk ( same region ) games and has free shipping . 
  also we get us dollar for steam games which is a lot cheaper than australian prices . 
  [ meta ] i told him to come here more often a few days ago so i hope he does n't see this, 
  they dropped the ball with no local multiplayer for paradise, 
  all they 'll give you is `` it 's in development '' . 
  i would say expect 2015, 
  what drm has the ps4 version got ? 
  did anyone else see the trailer for lightning returns . 
  it seems both games are going to have action-rpg based combat . 
  the billboard is the exact same size . 
  wake up isheep , your os is a scam . 
  it looks like something a fairy vomited !, 
  he might already have tri on the wii, 
  if you have a cfw ps3 get showtime . 
  can plug in your hard drive and play any format or stream any format . 
  you had to dismiss other religions as fake ? 
  something no atheist would ever do !, 
  any questions ? 
  ## take a look in the mirror 1 % fundie !, 
  i have received confirmation that / u/literallyjijler planned to instigate a coup on / r/magicskyfairy . 
  when he visited the page however he was unable to even move his mouse due to being blinded by the sheer bravery of the saganometer and the faithsmashing community . 
  um , these are atheist condiments . 
  we 're allowed to eat them if they 're atheist . 
  i reclaimed hummus from the muslims , so it 's ok now . 
  look at the asus padphone as well . 
  it 's a tablet powered by your phone . 
  i grab a handful , stick a glob of nutella in between and then layer another handful on top . 
  no need for bread - win win !, 
  no it 's pretty accurate actually . 
  galileo was censored but nowhere near the state that the popular myth claims . 
  his biggest mistake was insulting the pope , who actually supported him . 
  i heard / u/aeratemark faps to this, 
  you mean upsayings right ? 
  [ * it 's only natural ... * ] ( / / #spong ), 
  ugh , stupid fundie americans . 
  it 's st coriander , get it right !, 
  do n't worry carl , we all happened to save it too !, 
  / r/atheistwallpapers, 
  he 's spent half a decade on the forum . 
  it 's like losing his home ; _ ;, 
  what about equivalently this ? 
  since equivalence is used in le science , i think it 's fit for use in some professional quotes . 
  here 's mine, 
  `` we only have one voice . 
  denying our right to faith smash is equivalent to murder '', 
  [ ahahahahaha oh my sagan . 
  i bet this same guy calls america a police state on / r/politics too ] ( / ooc ), 
  ** stop ** : the fundie reign of terror, 
  ** think ** : about how ridiculous the idea of an omnipresent god is, 
  ** atheism ** : the intelligent choice, 
  repost this if you 're part of the 1 % of the world smart enough to realize the truth . 
  if you 're * brave * enough that is . 
  as a member of circlebs and circlebroke3 i can confirm this .
