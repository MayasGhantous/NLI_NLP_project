  national has managed the economy well though , and most of us are pretty complacent politically, 
  ok , * they 're too big and not mostly about porn . 
  happy now ? 
  they already spied in the past , we know that . 
  it was just a subtly worded law that they could do it . 
  with the whole kim dot com furore though , they needed to make the legislation more clearer , which is what they 're doing . 
  i do n't agree with it either , but all this does is makes it clearer . 
  i do think the asset sales lost them a lot of support . 
  it would be pretty incredible if they managed to get another term , but i think people will be voting labour just for a change this time . 
  also their low power policy is going to be appealing . 
  i 'll leave it as a testament to my noo zelund english prowess .

  the loss is n't that great once they removed the emotion engine after about a year . 
  they were essentially packaging a ps2 inside the first models , and state of the art blu ray tech . 
  now blu ray drives are cheaper to make and there 's no ps2 support , so it 's not as expensive . 
  there are a lot but none are really that prominent . 
  none of the defaults have any porn , which is what they really care about . 
  it 's likely only sites where the primary focus is on porn that will be blocked . 
  look at how i 'm not caring people !!, 
  here , i made a maymay to show how much i do n't care !, 
  unfortunately , this one is n't just confined to the internet, 
  people care , but it 's just not news .

  i bought my mum a new laptop with a touch screen , makes a world of difference . 
  i like how you can organize all your programs into categories on the start screen . 
  opening a program and seeing the screen everytime can be a bit annoying , but win key + type whatever and it 's done . 
  i did n't have many lans but i have fond memories of multiplayer ps2/ps1 gaming . 
  i 've got 4 controllers for my ps3 and every so often we play some old ps2 games or cod/driving ones .

  you are worth more to me than just another target . 
  i hope we will come to have a friendship never before seen on this earth . 
  do n't you think you might be hurting someone 's feelings saying that over the internet ? 
  think about it , my friend . 
  as we speak i am contacting my good friends across canada and your p.o. 
  box is being traced right now so you better prepare for the greeting cards , friend . 
  the greeting cards that help you with your hate . 
  you should look forward to it , friend . 
  i can be anywhere , anytime for you , and i can calm you in over seven hundred ways , and that 's just with my chess set . 
  not only am i extensively trained in conflict resolution , but i have access to the entire group of my friends and i will use them to their full extent to start our new friendship . 
  if only you could have known what kindness and love your little comment was about to bring you , maybe you would have reached out sooner .
