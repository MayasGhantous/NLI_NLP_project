  for example, 
  [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/116uog/thank_you_ratheism_from_a_godless_gay_alabaman/ ) is something i posted on an alt account that was so bullshit even i was surprised it made the front page . 
  now with proper moderation it would have been removed instantly and everyone would have called it out . 
  as a long time / r/magicskyfairy user i never thought i would defend / r/atheism , but almost all the criticism i had of the sub has dissapeared . 
  this user seems to have an outdated perception of the sub . 
  half a year ago or so that may have been true , but / r/atheism is like a whole new sub now . 
  yes there 's a hivemind that 's obviously anti religion , but it 's a hivemind equivalent to any large sub . 
  i think most users on / r/atheism realize that there 's no point going onto other subs like they used to and e-vangelise their atheism , because nobody really wants to be involuntarily preached to . 
  instead they stick to their own sub , and upvote news and discussion relevant to their interests . 
  i do n't really see how that 's religious hatred at all now , in the old sub there was but it really is a different place . 
  na all good . 
  there 's probably quite a few people that just play the psn versions on ps3 instead rather than actually getting out their playstation to do so . 
  how does it feel like moderating a sub with hitler ? 
  yes i did . 
  the point i was making though is they added 3d as a gimmick to distinguish the system , like the controller for the wii u , when it 's the games that are shipping 3ds 's not the 3d gimmick . 
  likewise it 's the dire game library/marketing that 's stopping wii us from being sold . 
  downwolves ? 
  really ? 
  why do you keep repeating this ? 
  ** capital letters and bold text are n't substance **, 
  xnay on the downnays !, 
  haha forgot to log into your alt i take it ? 
  oh sorry i did n't think you were quoting anyone , just shouting at random . 
  * / r/worldnews, 
  i 've come to talk to you again, 
  because a viewpoint 's softly creeping in ,, 
  left its stains while i was sleeping ,, 
  and the image , that was planted in my newsfeed . 
  still it breeds ,, 
  within the sound , of islamophobia, 
  and all the people upvote in hate ,, 
  for the circlejerk they 'd made, 
  the great scapegoat against brown people, 
  let 's not forget jews and israelis ,, 
  and the sound said `` they are all backwards and should go back to where they came . 
  they 're all to blame '', 
  and no one dared, 
  disturb the sound, 
  of / r/worldnews, 
  is it ? 
  i thought klaatu made it private . 
  well link it in the sidebar then u guess, 
  wow . 
  i came here to say the exact same thing !, 
  reddit is so awesome :3, 
  considering it was always our plan to lead god fearing christians astray , we 're very happy indeed . 
  our mod , is a golden calf, 
  he reigns , from sinai above, 
  with glistening liberal horns, 
  our mod is a golden calf !, 
  there are different schools of buddhism . 
  therevada has no concept of divinity and would be the kind most ratheists probably relate to , but mahayana and tibetan buddhism both have supernatural aspects and equivalents of divinities, 
  [ i think it 's because people take on atheism as an identity , even though there 's not really any substance to it . 
  i mean it 's the lack of belief in something , it 's like defining yourself as a-political and then making `` fuck politics , they 're all a lie '' facebook statuses , and calling anyone who votes brainwashed . 
  [ my atheist friends get their value and meaning from life in different areas where religion fills the void for me . 
  they do n't define themselves by their unbelief . 
  however new atheism seems to fetishize science , to try to incorporate into their irreliigion , even when they often concern different things . 
  it 's so easy to see life as meaningless , that i think that 's why you get the pseudo religious `` made of star stuff '' aspects thrown in to try to make atheism this science based values in a pseudo-religious dentity , to make it something it 's not ] ( / ooc ), 
  as a christian , in america they really are n't . 
  in saudi arabia where people are put to death for proselytizing , yes . 
  i do n't really want to be a mod , but i do want to read klaatu 's old modmail . 
  here 's some reasons to consider me, 
  - i 've been a subscriber since the first month of the sub, 
  - i know reddit culture and also circlebroke 's complaint etiquette . 
  i also can spot the most divisive topics from a mile away . 
  - i am an active moderator on smaller subs like / r/androidcirclejerk , / r/liberalreality and moderated / r/circlejerk last week . 
  - i spend too much time on this site . 
  i will be awake during australian/new zealand/singapore/hong kong time , and probably at night or european morning time . 
  - i know and am friends with most of the moderators of this sub already from elsewhere on reddit, 
  - i hate anything that 's popular on this site . 
  - i 'm reasonably impartial to anything that is n't a circlejerk or religious topics . 
  - i have generated semi successful ratheist copypasta numerous times on my alt account, 
  - i 'm subscribed and frequent pretty much all the other meta communities on this site as well . 
  i doubt there will be a pc port, 
  i ca n't wait to see a proper trailer for kingdom hearts 3 . 
  if it 's at tgs it sounds like they 'll probably be released some time 2014 in japan , maybe 2015 in the states . 
  ie is n't bad if it 's recent , but if it 's a library computer i doubt that 's the case, 
  i was hoping jij would come out as a born again christian . 
  that would have been the greatest ending to the butteriest drama we 've ever had . 
  do n't tell me what to do . 
  i upronned you fucking fascist, 
  i do n't know but i just started a meth lab . 
  woe to our world , only pain and death without mod sustaining us . 
  something something elect, 
  christian culture sucks, 
  love does n't win, 
  i read an article showing celebrity reactions to the vmas on twitter . 
  billy rae cyrus 's was like `` please love do n't hate , everyone '' so perhaps he 's accepted her choices recently . 
  it 's alright to constantly listen to celebrity gossip so long as you comment about how much you hate it . 
  oh yeah , i knew that . 
  i 'm just wondering how widespread macau residents felt the language was . 
  hey bj hitler mods . 
  how about a real brave theme for once ? 
  ** a tribute to david hasslehoff ** . 
  there 's so many images of him in brave publicity poses doing stupid shit . 
  also, 
  [ how is this not the bravest thing ever ? 
  ] ( http://cdn-www.cracked.com/articleimages/wong/hoffquestion.jpg ), 
  i thought government workers would be a large majority of the language base . 
  is there still a big portugese expat community in macau ?
