  are the suikodens not on psn yet ? 
  basically every country atheists are martyred , minority religions are as well . 
  that 's not to discredit them , but i think because religious people proselytise the statics are generally higher for number of them killed . 
  there were several atheists ( or at least non muslims ) killed in bangladesh recently . 
  there are a lot of christians killed [ this ] ( http://www.wikiislam.net/wiki/persecution_of_ex-muslims_%28bangladesh%29 ) article shows a few , but i think these were specifically secular bloggers so they were at least agnostic ( the article that made / r/worldnews claimed they were atheists ), 
  no i agree , i was pointing out where atheists are martyred so are every other ideology or belief that 's different as well . 
  i do n't really get the downvotes . 
  there was an article recently saying that non muslim bloggers ( who were at least agnostic ) but the article claimed they were atheist , were killed recently in bangladesh . 
  i also agreed with the poster above that there are many christians and other minority religions persecuted in islamic countries as well , but was pointing out that in addition to atheists killed , christians , buddhists etc usually are as well . 
  ah you speak portugese then ? 
  are you fluent ? 
  your concern is fickle until you mod true christians ^ tm to / r / `` christianity '' to cleanse the sub, 
  here 's one of the articles about it . 
  i was mistaken though , unsurprisingly the headline was editorialized . 
  apparently they 've been arrested , but several people were killed protesting and wanting them executed, 
  ah yeah sorry , i was making reference to an article i did n't post . 
  ### what the fuck mods ? 
  how is this poll even necessary ? 
  how could any fundie not be blinded by our beautiful science the moment they come here ? 
  i 'm thinking you might be a concern troll ... 
  #### ... sweet sagan , they 're right !, 
  the fundies have arrived in full force . 
  how can we live with [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kh0hbr5.jpg ) stone age bullshit in our safe space ?!?!? 
  the easiest way to do it is to get a `` swap magic '' . 
  you need to put a few minor part in your ps2 , but you do n't really need to open it up . 
  then you can swap the disc , and play the game .

  nsa agents ( aka sheeple ) , how 's it feel to know there 's an entire group of individuals who are better at online forum interaction than you are ? 
  meet / r/technology users . 
  they are better than you . 
  they understand internet trends better , they understand ip security protocols better , they know how to network better than you . 
  they understand the pros and cons of masturbatory groupthink ( including meme phrases ) because on / r/technology , you 'll actually have a hivemind ; they understand the principles behind browsing wikipedia because they run into phrases like `` do you actually know anything about ... '' being pro piracy comes from knowing how to browse on / r/technology ( and this really pisses you off , since was the one thing you always agreed with your superiors about in dc . ), 
  oh , and they probably can even talk to geeks better than you , since most advanced / r/technology users these days are ex-shaven people who managed to learn to disassociate themselves from society years ago , when it was much less porn friendly . 
  at this point , a confident nsa agent would admit to himself he has a lot to learn about reddit and technology focused internet forums in general . 
  but since you lack the bravery to do that , you run back to the nsa , install the latest build of prism , and keep repeating to yourself `` at least i can spy on these fuckers . 
  at least i can spy on these fuckers '', 
  if you 're looking for upvotes , all this hits you even harder , because you realize a lot of the most upvoted posts require agreeing with / r/technology posters in one way or another . 
  even many of the most upvoted posts recommend actually visiting / r/technology !, 
  at this point , you rationalize `` well the only thing i know is spying on the internet , so i must be a internet spying expert ! '' as if knowing only one thing makes you an automatic expert , or that your data erasing techniques at the nsa will ever let you forget / r/technology 's hivemind entirely .

  i 'm just spreading the truth bro . 
  the nsa is fucking everywhere !, 
  probably ebay if it 's working well, 
  people do n't like being preached at , whether atheist or religious views . 
  your opinion that the pope can merely issue a decree and have hundreds of millions of catholics turn into a blood thirsty mob is also insulting to people 's faith as well . 
  god of war 3 and uncharted 3 are also round 40 gigs, 
  i think it 's more that he 's bragging . 
  even if it 's relevant to the conversation , it 's like people mentioning their iq over the internet as proof they 're intellectually superior . 
  there are people that only have one sexual partner throughout life , simply because it works for them . 
  the idea that you have to have multiple partners is just wrong , some people may do but otherwise why would people commit to a long term relationship if they need more than one partner ? 
  no he 's not a motherfucker , he has n't even had sex yet . 
  i 'm sorry i found this a little hard to understand . 
  i 've improved it a bit , eh ?

  sagan dammit reddit , you make me so proud to hate america : _ :7, 
  haha factual falcon . 
  this is fantastic . 
  i thought 4chan were mostly antifeminist though ? 
  edit : oh crap , they 're using the srs brd for defending hate speech ? 
  i thought they were being pro feminist , which would have been a welcome change, 
  we r legun, 
  we neva 5get ( dats more than 4get ), 
  so this is how freedom dies ... 
  i believe / pol / has invaded , posting a meme that 's anti feminist . 
  of course it 's being upvoted by / r/mensrights . 
  i thought it was 4chan trolling mens rights by posting srs comics which would have been hilarious , but their shitty comics are being upvoted everywhere . 
  have you seen their board ? 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/factualfalcon/ - i think there are reposts from there . 
  check the other discussions and see if the timing 's suspicious . 
  yeah , i know now but i wish i did n't . 
  agreed, 
  the comments and amazon reviews are really selling this book on me . 
  for this one , are the japaneses sound effects translated ? 
  i loved arrietty . 
  the soundtrack is really fantastic too for celtic inspired stuff . 
  just claim it 's ironic and it does n't look so bad, 
  wow cuntgurgler_shitfuck_midnightbacon i see u everywhere xd, 
  it 's tooo awesum for le / r/f7u12 :3, 
  to be fair , it was more creative than a lot reddit fads . 
  the only time they look good is on a jazz musician or someone in a suit . 
  pretty sure it 's a joke . 
  otherwise he 's enlightened by his gnosticism . 
  really ?
