  ### a + give this man the pullitzer ; _ ; . 
  this was literally the most inspiring thing i 've read . 
  who 's cutting onions ?? 
  came here to say this, 
  [ i know a good website ] ( http://www.reddit.com ), 
  yeah , there 's more than enough demand for ps4 consoles throughout the first year . 
  i think when some must have cross play title comes out , they 'll bring out a bundle . 
  probably when there 's a vita model refresh . 
  generally more japanese exclusives/rpgs on playstation if that 's your thing too . 
  ## i love the smell of the sweet logic on your neckbeard , fellow saganite . 
  if they really `` believed '' why do n't they kill themselves to get to heaven or starve themselves to death ? 
  oh wait , they do n't do that so they do n't believe anything !!! . 
  religious people are literally atheists in denial !, 
  64 gig really is n't that bad . 
  they 're not going to change the storage after already releasing first gen hardware . 
  three months after us and europe ? 
  wow . 
  is n't that sort of a insult to the japanese , turning their backs on their home country . 
  arghh , i guess i 'm late again . 
  final fantasy 8 eh ? 
  i 'll have to give it a listen . 
  i think square rpg 's probably have the best soundtracks ff7 , kingdom hearts , chrono trigger , ff10 are all amazing, 
  personally i think chrono cross 's soundtrack is the best games soundtrack ever . 
  i 've never even played the game and yet i listen to the soundtrack all the time . 
  have you ever worked with yoshinori mitsuda ? 
  i would love a reorchestrated chrono cross soundtrack or piano collection if you ever do talk to her . 
  thanks for the ama . 
  god does n't even real you stupid fundie . 
  / u/oreography 1, 
  / u/silvohex -9000, 
  ** you 've been faith smashed , bitch . 
  suck on my science titties **, 
  anatomy is a science so yes my man titties are made of science . 
  i do n't give a shit what you deluded fundies think . 
  when the whole world is one big matrix of lies ... science becomes the only truth . 
  it 's the only way to sift through it all with any certainty . 
  so anyone can claim to know what happens , or you can learn the science and know what happens . 
  in science ... it only takes one proof that a theory is wrong ... even the most hardened theory . 
  the understanding of acetylcholine effects are fully understood , so who 's wrong , the lairs in the temples or science ? 
  oh yeah , it 's like in my top 5 to play list . 
  i wish they 'd do a sequel , it seems like such a great series . 
  whoops . 
  i was confusing him with yoko shimonura who did kingdom hearts . 
  damn , i should have been more subtle ... 
  thanks for the offer, 
  dae israel is literally nationalsozialistische deutscheland ? 
  what ? 
  so it 's cheaper than a vita and plays all vita + psp games natively . 
  is n't this just going to ruin vita sales ? 
  i 'm pretty sure any media services ( movies/movies ) will be streamable . 
  streaming a ps4 game on a non local network would be awful . 
  right , but i just think this will harm their vita console sales, 
  i would have had the same reaction . 
  it 's not the website that 's cringeworthy , it 's the banal attempt to build a reddit culture out of no identity other than internet memes and forced interests in shit like bacon . 
  here 's a decent article showing the basics, 
  half of the rebel fighters estimated are islamists in two different factions . 
  the fsa is still the largest batallion though . 
  `` mankind is poised midway between the gods and the beasts '' - plotinus, 
  the only new world order is the one we as culture have created ourselves . 
  every reference to sex you see in the media is driven by demand . 
  please do n't fatshame my dinner, 
  i do n't know . 
  i think i 'll go lecture people on / r/trueatheism now about how my opinion is the right one . 
  definitely seems like the right thing to do . 
  well considering they all believe in some mystical cloud papa , it 's obvious their delusions reflect on their politics . 
  cognitive dissonance ergo sum proxy logiicum as the greeks say !, 
  qed republisheep . 
  night theology ? 
  sounds very interesting . 
  can you elaborate wc ? 
  which ones are the homosexuals ? 
  i think you 're straying a bit , friend . 
  try the book of mormon , it 's a mid way point . 
  science sounds positively ghastly !, 
  fiyt me with ur chemicals , m8 . 
  i 'll fookin release sum nasty gas bombs , you aint seen nothin . 
  save the easter bunnies !!, 
  sauron represented lennon 's repressed sexual tension towards brian epstein . 
  the journey was always about killing off his old desires , and coping with his death . 
  it 's actually a scheme run by the english boarding school association to get more students . 
  wake up muggles , you 're buying into ebsa propoganda !, 
  we studied this in english class . 
  there 's several interesting interpretations . 
  supposedly it 's won some gnostic film awards , for representing gnosticism/christian mysticism in the media . 
  another interpretation is atheistic , how truman realizes the world he knew and had been promised is a fabrication . 
  there are so many different possible interpretations though for that film . 
  there was nothing about science in his interpretation . 
  it 's more like mcdonalds drinks your milkshake - capitalism becomes the new god . 
  amen , my grandaddy was not a pigeon !, 
  i do n't actually want to be your `` friend '' , let 's just get that straight . 
  just bring you to church every third sunday so others know i 'm being a good christian . 
  leave me alone fallacybot , you godless robot !, 
  i came here to upvote this, 
  he 's the guy that ran the std clinic on friends, 
  it 's almost like they have to act like it 's something else !, 
  it 's a sect ( ie a group that 's broken away with different teachings ) not a cult . 
  choose whater cloudphone you want !, 
  for most items our import tax is only 12.5 percent , which is n't that bad . 
  compared to what south america and some other developing countries is pretty good . 
  to be fair , even in the west we have a lot of people who prefer the traditional gender roles .
