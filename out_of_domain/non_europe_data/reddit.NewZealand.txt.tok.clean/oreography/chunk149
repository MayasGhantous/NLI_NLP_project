  however my mum has a touchscreen on her new laptop and it works fine without a replacement menu . 
  pandering to the idiots that cry censorship at the slightest attempt to improve your sub makes me think you 're not fit to be a mod here . 
  you 're supposed to act like a team , if you make a decision then do it together . 
  rocket launchers are well known to bringing people enlightenment about the realities of the world by opening your brains and forgeting the propaganda that gets shoved down our throats by the government and the corporations . 
  why else would the government ban them if not to reduce the amount of people who open their eyes and realize the government is screwing them over by not letting them have these weapons ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scientism is the term you 're looking for, 
  defending christianity in / r/atheismrebooted ? 
  that 's like going to a 14 year old girl 's birthday party and saying you do n't like one direction . 
  / r/atheism is a lot more mature now and i do n't think there 's so much blind hatred now , definitely not in / r/trueatheism anyways . 
  my advice is just to leave them in their echochamber and pray god reaches out to them afk . 
  oh wow this is beautiful . 
  where 's this from ? 
  you can criticize religion in a way that is n't bigoted . 
  comments like `` fuck muslims , they 're stuck in the middle ages '' are bigoted and insubstantial . 
  providing an honest criticism of the religion is fine e.g outlining obvious reasons why sharia law is wrong and pointing to examples of where it has been implemented and failed , if it does n't resort to hyperbole or pointless bigotry, 
  ah oblytile looks pretty cool . 
  i think metro 's actually pretty good for sorting out your programs into groups . 
  i realized after changing my trackpad from two finger scroll to normal one finger scrolling , that it 's a lot easier to navigate horizontally along . 
  lolol dae / r/pyongyang for any reference to north korea ? 
  yeah i 'm not a fan of it . 
  just type mouse into the start menu to go into mouse settings , select your trackpad and change the gesture settings . 
  it makes it a lot better . 
  i was referring to / r/worldnews specifically , where these are the rules . 
  in real life it 's always better to be polite as well though , you 're never going to change minds by being aggressive . 
  follow peter 's example and cut her ears off if they cause her to stumble . 
  this is literally what muslims believe !!, 
  [ remember that the brave teenage idiots coming up with this stuff do n't reflect on the majority of atheists at all ] ( / ooc ), 
  ### logic, 
  ### reason,

  to be fair that was one of the more interesting amas i 've ever read . 
  they also had one from a female mra , both sides giving their views . 
  wow , another person lying on reddit . 
  who would have guessed ? 
  anything over medium is a crime, 
  i sacrificed your tag to driscoll, 
  that was a glorious thread . 
  i also liked the one where the fat overweight atheist claimed he was more persecuted than black people . 
  have you tried buying a usb wireless adapter ? 
  it sounds like the network card may have died , but that buying one of those may be what you need to get online, 
  bigoted interjections are n't part of the curriculum . 
  if any teacher legitimately said anything close to that , you should report him . 
  it 's fine not voting , but complaining about how things are and smugly saying `` well i did n't vote them in ! '', 
  is just so hypocritical . 
  it 's a category on the myers brigg type indicator , which is a way ( certainly not a perfect way ) of assigning personality traits . 
  wikipedia sums it up, 
  i -- introversion preferred to extraversion : intjs tend to be quiet and reserved . 
  they generally prefer interacting with a few close friends rather than a wide circle of acquaintances , and they expend energy in social situations ( whereas extraverts gain energy ) . 
  n -- intuition preferred to sensing : intjs tend to be more abstract than concrete . 
  they focus their attention on the big picture rather than the details and on future possibilities rather than immediate realities . 
  t -- thinking preferred to feeling : intjs tend to value objective criteria above personal preference or sentiment . 
  when making decisions they generally give more weight to logic than to social considerations . 
  j -- judgment preferred to perception : intjs tend to plan their activities and make decisions early . 
  they derive a sense of control through predictability , which to perceptive types may seem limiting . 
  by this classification , intj 's are introverted ( not socially anxious but lol what 's the difference amirite ) geniuses who ca n't relate emotionally to people . 
  by assigning themselves as intjs , redditors have a way of validating their dislike of other people , bad social etiquette and masturbating their egos , knowing that they 're misunderstood intellectuals . 
  my favourite one was the bashar al assad ama request . 
  out of all the things that would ever happen , i mean do people even think before they post these things ? 
  a corporate controlled website will give so much more freeeeedom than the corporate news sites, 
  not accepting it as a thing is n't going to stop thousands from using it as a validation for their issues . 
  wow , you guys r so edgy xd,
