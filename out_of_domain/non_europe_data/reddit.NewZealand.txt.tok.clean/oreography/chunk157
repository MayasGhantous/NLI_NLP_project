  she 's probably my favourite french singer, 
  no , not really . 
  johnson acts like a schoolboy but he has and continues to manage the city well . 
  / unjerk god he sounds so smug . 
  does he really think he 's the only celibate christian in history ? 
  `` i did n't write this to gloat '' bullshit you did n't . 
  this is fox news you 're pandering too after all, 
  apparently he voiced the brain in arthur . 
  at least he 's done one thing right . 
  for them to not blatantly state they 're lesbians is treason . 
  to think that your church could be infiltrated so easily shows your members are n't standing firm in their marital identity ^ tm . 
  i make sure to reinforce i 'm married everywhere i go , just so the gays/harlots do n't think they have a chance . 
  `` hey oreography , did you see the game last night ? '', 
  `` yeah i did . 
  i watched it with my wife . 
  who i am married to in holy matrimony . '', 
  well duh . 
  is the pope a heretic ? 
  in the fire burns the demons of aberrosexuality . 
  the abasement of the sacred church can only be cured with flames . 
  [ with flames !,

  nice copypaste , with no actual discussions of the maymays i make . 
  based dac replies to me 3 weeks later . 
  praise le snoo !, 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ know ^ ^ why ^ ^ you ^ ^ were ^ ^ downvoted ? 
  it 's even better to know that ~ ~ the ps3 ~ ~ final fantasy 13 wo n't be around to slow down development time anymore . 
  yes the former archbishop of canterbury would be pining for less christianity ... 
  a couple crazies are . 
  as usual on / r/worldnews you 're painting all of a faiths followers with a very broad brush . 
  would n't the us census be a more reliable measure ? 
  the source you linked to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_social_survey has had roughly 2000 respondents every time it was conducted , vs the millions of americans polled in the us census . 
  i do n't dispute religion is declining in the states , but i think the census would be a better source . 
  i 'm not encouraging brigading or anything , just pointing out how ridiculous their criticism is . 
  it 's not like kim kardashian has n't had `` intimate '' videos before . 
  omg wild horses !!, 
  yeezy is totes environmental and shit, 
  i do n't think so . 
  type 0 was in the same universe and had completely separate characters , just like ff xv will . 
  she 's had three games already , i think they 've used her enough . 
  on the verses of arming yourself in matthew , i read a post the other day on it . 
  `` and whoever has no sword is to sell his coat and buy one . 
  37 '' for i tell you that this which is written must be fulfilled in me , ` and he was numbered with transgressors ' ; for that which refers to me has its fulfillment . '', 
  the `` and he was numbered with transgressors '' is a direct quote from issaiah 53:12 that christ sees himself as fulfilling . 
  it 's helpful to consider that the word translated here as `` transgressors '' can also mean things like `` rogues '' or `` rebels . '', 
  that 's why a meager two short swords was enough and why christ tells them not to actually use the swords ; as he says himself , jesus simply commands the purchase of swords to match the prophecy in isaiah . 
  the us census bureau site has some figures here , taken from the american religious identification survey . 
  it 's interesting that the government does n't poll officially . 
  in new zealand , australia and the uk there are always questions on it . 
  taken from a sample size of 228,182 ( in 2008 ) . 
  between 1990 and 2001 , based on estimates and sample size those with no religion grew from 14,331 to 29,481 , a massive increase . 
  2001 - 2008 was not as impressive going from 29,481 to 34,169 . 
  between 1990 and 2001 and the growth of american christians was minor , going from 151,225 to 159,514 . 
  however per capita it appears to be growing faster from 2001 to 2008 from 159,514 to 173,402 people . 
  in the 90s it appeared irreligiosity was growing rapidly , however now according to these figures the pace is comparable the growth of christianity . 
  the figures on other religions are interesting too . 
  i thought his flow was pretty good ? 
  what did n't you like about it ? 
  such a shame that jazz 3 got cancelled . 
  there 's a demo of it up on youtube . 
  i played the gba game too but it was pretty average . 
  the `` the fall '' one is brilliant , you made it sound almost like a thought provoking r&b song . 
  well done . 
  that 's so sad . 
  i wonder how they feel towards europeans who live in the dutch , british and french colonies in the caribbean . 
  i used to read the noddy childrens books which were popular in the `` colonies '' as well as the uk . 
  the golliwog in the books never particularly stood out , it was so cartoonish and strange like the other characters in the book . 
  it was only till i grew up that i realized the symbolism . 
  honestly though i did n't relate it to black people , because it was so fantastical in the books that it made it hard to believe that it was supposed to reflect real life at all . 
  you racist scum that 's swedish culture not dutch !, 
  what 's the reference ? 
  i know he did the banana thing . 
  glad i do n't follow it then . 
  sleeping dogs is square not ubisoft, 
  did n't you hear , muslims are incapable of love . 
  i 'm sure it says so in one hadith or another !, 
  surely this is evidence of the anti faithsmasher agenda ^ tm that was predicted by the great scientist feinberg many months ago . 
  to think what the sub stood for and what its become just makes me furious . 
  nobody is immune from jij 's moderation poison ... i wonder how long we will last :(, 
  wow . 
  so oppressed . 
  thank you kind atheist sir !, 
  figuratively i would also give you gold , but my fundie mother stopped me from accessing her credit card ( even when she gave me only $ 10 pocket money \u0ca0_\u0ca0 ) to order my annual supply of mountain dew . 
  alas , all i have is one humb [ le ] upvote . 
  haha no problem . 
  i know you were n't trying to cause offense or anything . 
  she was sidescrolling through temples as well and you could go into them . 
  she also had some projectiles to throw . 
  in your view a `` christian perspective '' is a conservative perspective . 
  that 's what 's putting people off . 
  most christians here are n't conservative but they 're very devout people of faith . 
  honestly though , if you feel this sub is too liberal then submit your own links . 
  be the change you want to see . 
  / r/truechristian already is the main conservative sub , there 's no point splintering off another one . 
  there 's no way of changing it , you need to start a new one if you want to change the name . 
  it 's fine to stick to the one you have if you want , but i just feel that since we already have / r/truechristian as a conservative sub and there are people taking offense to the name it 's probably not necessary . 
  give me the sub jijler . 
  you 're a fascist and everyone knows it . 
  well it 's certainly not ambiguous haha . 
  create whatever you want , but i find that splinter subreddits often find it hard to pick up subscribers .
