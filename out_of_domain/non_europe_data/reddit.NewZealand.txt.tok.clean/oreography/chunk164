  definitely no underlying problems there . 
  really ? 
  i think it 's a pretty shit generalization that completely ignores the concept of free will introduced in the very first story in abrahamic religion . 
  how can you compare something that has complete agency with robots ? 
  from what i 've read islam is growing a lot faster in the western world than christianity , but in africa and asia ( particularly china ) christianity is growing at quite a rapid rate . 
  * upsaints to the left, 
  fixed that for you friend . 
  god bless !, 
  praise god . 
  his light shines in the dark forsaken land of sweden as well !, 
  in this moment , i am joyous . 
  not because of some worldly sin , but because i am excited by my saviour who loves me . 
  yahweh ? 
  friend , it sounds like you need jesus . 
  raise your mouth into a smile , for your saviour has risen for you !, 
  i used to be a saganite like you , but then i took a saviour to the heart :d, 
  ## what faith !, 
  i 'm crying over my keyboard brother . 
  i used to know a quote like that until i was blinded on the road to walmart . 
  seeing you take hold of that is just so inspiring , praise god !, 
  it 's us law because the content is hosted in the us and because it 's a. com address . 
  any website with a. com . 
  net . 
  co or . 
  org address is subject to a form of american law . 
  this user is a notorious srser who is trying to oppress our science given amateur porn rights . 
  please do n't let her have the sub . 
  was n't it illegal for them to enter canada though ? 
  were the missionaries punished for letting them come into the country ? 
  calling / u/ahura _ mazda_was_the_amazon, 
  man-feels is an oxymoron, 
  `` special snow person '', 
  yeah because new zealand authorities could n't have done this by themselves , customs was definitely receiving a phone call straight from the nsa to search the guy . 
  i 'm sick of blaming america . 
  our own authorities are causing the problem , not the states . 
  we need to stop resorting to the american scape goat and face up to our own problems . 
  it 's only because he was affiliated with the snowden case that he 's a suspect . 
  how many of the tens of thousands of businessmen travelling through the country every week do you think they 're going to search ? 
  i read this recently . 
  the conversation between the world controller and the `` savage '' is some of the best writing of all time . 
  as i 'm a poor uneducated theist i do n't get this reference to a major work of 20th century literature . 
  however just like 7 click memes and our beautiful book of fairytales though i 'd prefer a longer title , but til reddit has a limit on sub titles . 
  because it pays better, 
  right but the more bullshit paragraphs you write t , the higher chance your opponent does n't bother reading them and just accepts your argument ad being correct, 
  but that 's what the evoliegion monkeys eat !, 
  amen , and remember the louder you pray the better chance it has reaching heaven !, 
  it 's in the bible friend , you just need to read it . 
  when you die you 'll burn in the seven circles of fiery hell for all eternity .

  ### jesus wants you for a sunbeam , friend !, 
  you just got ta smile !, 
  ### checkmate srs !!, 
  you ca n't request users, 
  holy shit get off the internet, 
  meme this is ongada he try make part lost in swimming pool at grocery store meme is ongada going shopping take crap on couch have seizure meme ongada upvote please, 
  well it was already pretty much made at weta studios already , since a large amount of the scenery is cg, 
  yeah , under $ 400 it 's fine . 
  however you really do get stung if it is . 
  mobicity for example do n't specify the stock is shipping from hong kong , not a local warehouse so i got stung gst and a hefty customs fee , making my phone cheaper to get at a local retailer . 
  no u, 
  i think like pocahontas and brave it will just be a romanticized version of the culture , but not really disrespectful just stretching the truth like any disney movie . 
  perhaps it and avatar will drive up tourism at home again . 
  edit : moana waikiki . 
  definitely hawaiian . 
  aside from the lion king , what japanese films have they been influenced by ? 
  ## this . 
  listen to the bible friend, 
  [ actually it 's in the qu ` ran ] ( / ooc ), 
  ### heaven !, 
  well it 's subjective so whatever ones the subscribers of / r/hongkong liked i guess . 
  i was more looking for vlogs on life in hong kong , but it looks an interesting channel, 
  plenty of love !, 
  i 'll definitely check yours out . 
  iam the 665th upsciencer . 
  ama, 
  i agree . 
  the mix is much cleaner and songs like `` two of us '' do n't have the unnecessary intros . 
  holy shit is this copypasta ? 
  christians are dying overseas for their belief , that 's real persecution . 
  losing a tv show for making homophobic comments is n't persecution . 
  anything featuring namer98 and dildo 's, 
  i nominate / u/carl _ deron_brutsch 's [ satanic universalist ama ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/sidehugs/comments/1ko2fq/iama_satanic_universalist_ama/# ), 
  ### you think suffering next to people who actually believe in a magical sky goose is a fucking joke ?? 
  i do n't think you understand . 
  ** anyone who believes in fairy tales in this day and age deserves to be mocked . 
  catholics now confirmed nsa shills . 
  wake up true baptist christians !, 
  thank you for your insight, 
  and linux is n't ? 
  i can get a linux server running and know the commands for red hat/ubuntu etc but i could never use it as my main os . 
  sony cuts a loss on the product because it makes so many . 
  due to the differences in how console games are optimized you ca n't build a pc for the same price and expect it to to even near the life expectancy of a ps4 , or render the games as well as it does . 
  sure .
