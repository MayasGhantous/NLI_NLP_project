  i desire to do your will , my mod ; your 2000 new laws are within my heart . 
  atheists and the mentally ill ? 
  is n't that a bit redundant ? 
  [ confession bear for a meme loving gentlemadam ] ( http://i.imgur.com/okzhe70.png ), 
  thank you good sir for your peer reviewed bravery . 
  if you want to pray do it in your ~ ~ jail cell ~ ~ home that 's your brain damage , but do n't you dare talk to your invisible cloud wizard on the internet , fundies . 
  thank you mods for removing this fascist oppressor . 
  dey dindt drink vodka do !, 
  only everclear !, 
  does anyone know the exchange rate in dogecoin ? 
  i still use xe.com . 
  plus their mobile app is amazing , you can use it offline for converting currency at the last downloaded rates when travelling . 
  compared to the us definitely . 
  i think hong kong wins the most colourful currency though,

  unlike god who never lived !, 
  fuck you . 
  this man is braver than any of us . 
  the next time this gentlesir is at the beach , the moment he takes his top off he could literally be shot by a deranged fundie . 
  show some respect to this soldier of reason . 
  yeah , a spelling mistake automatically disqualifies a whole persons life or academic experience . 
  i think a kindergarten would be more likely if you do n't have a degree . 
  you probably would n't have an issue in the prc going by the accounts i 've read from expats but hong kong is a different story . 
  haha good for you taking it in your stride . 
  an early childhood position sounds like it may be a good option . 
  i wish you all the best , maybe you could teach at / u/lunchbasket1 's kindergarten . 
  are you a professional thought maker ? 
  i 'd say a few other platformers of that era as well . 
  crash bandicoot and spyro 's gameplay and graphics still hold up reasonably well . 
  the 64 ds remake still looks good but i 'd have to disagree about the graphics . 
  compare [ mario 64 ] ( http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/246941-super-mario-64-nintendo-64-screenshot-inside-the-castles.jpg ) with the original [ crash bandicoot ] ( http://199.101.98.242/media/shots/36716-crash_bandicoot_%5bu%5d-6.png ) which came out the same year . 
  the polygons are far more blocky and the shadow effects are worse . 
  it looks alright on an emulator if you mod it/up the resolution but on a standard n64 i personally think the 3d of that game ( and many other games from the era ) look quite dated . 
  there is a biological imperative to breed , it 's why we have a sex drive . 
  he stated it bluntly but i do n't really know what you 're disputing . 
  #### upborks to the left, 
  what 's wrong is that the mods are shills for big science and are n't teaching the controversy . 
  dae hate it when you read so much science you hurt yourself ? 
  \\ #juststemthings, 
  unfortunately the public school system has long been under satan 's grasp . 
  however my uncle runs `` new holy fire divine school academy '' and there most certainly is a portrait of ken ham watching over the science lab ... 
  just kidding , there is no science lab . 
  how about instead of calling them bunsen burners , we call them `` righteous fires '', 
  and instead of `` science '' call it `` christ in nature '' classes . 
  i can give you a job offer if you 're interested . 
  the acting was a whole lot better for a start . 
  it was pretty bad, 
  great job guys . 
  i need to sort out a doge wallet soon to join the community . 
  congrats to / u/savethemhood as well that is incredible generosity . 
  so there was this old jewish yarn salesman , nearing the end of his career . 
  he 'd sold yarn to some of the best department stores in new york , but never macy 's . 
  he was determined to sell some yarn to macy 's before he retired . 
  he went to see the yarn buyer at macy 's to plead his case . 
  `` you 've been trying to sell me yarn for years , '' the man said . 
  `` i 'm obviously not interested . '', 
  `` but you do n't understand , '' the old man said , the traces of an eastern european accent still evident in his voice . 
  `` this is the last deal of my career . 
  i want nothing more than to sell just a little bit of yarn to your fine store . 
  tell you what , just buy a little bit . 
  no longer than from the tip of my nose to the tip of my dick . '', 
  the yarn buyer thought this was funny . 
  `` ok , '' he said . 
  `` just from the tip of your nose to the tip of you dick . '', 
  the old man went away happy . 
  the next day , a huge truck pulled up in front of macy 's . 
  it was full of yarn , gigantic spools , miles and miles of the stuff , more yarn than anyone could ever need . 
  the buyer was horrified . 
  he got the old man on the phone immediately . 
  `` there 's miles of yarn here !, 
  what 's wrong with you ? 
  you said from the tip of your nose to the tip of your dick ! '', 
  `` ah , '' said the old man . 
  `` the tip of my dick is in prague . '', 
  google task and google keep are both awful compared to evernote . 
  one note and evernote are the only two contenders for synced notebooks . 
  offline i use aknotepad but i know evernote premium has support if you pay for it . 
  one note is better featurewise than evernote , especially for ocr/pen input stuff . 
  i far prefer evernote but if i had something like a win 8 tablet i 'd probably use one note . 
  mt ruapehu is the only real ski field in the north island . 
  christchurch is closest to the most ski fields but if you do n't want to go skiing then any city would be fine , just do n't go skiing . 
  scenery wise christchurch is probably your best bet if the main thing is landscapes . 
  it 's closer to queenstown , abel tasman and fjordland . 
  auckland or wellington are much better options if you want to explore the cities . 
  it depends how long your stopover is . 
  if you 've only got a week or a couple days then do auckland . 
  there 's rotorua and lovely beaches as well as the city to explore . 
  you 'll be rushing round the south island to see all the landscapes if you 've got limited time . 
  sony is going to be pushing more developers on their platform to add support for it , so i think there will be more high quality official releases on their platform . 
  if you had a ps4 i think sony 's device would be a smarter bet , it will probably only be supported on pc with third party drivers . 
  really interesting premise . 
  you can export all your notes to html in evernote . 
  i keep an offline backup every few months that way . 
  importing html into onenote would be the easiest way of doing it . 
  i 'm going to try out the free version and would consider switching if you had an import html feature . 
  i 'd say kashmir would be a lot more `` epic '', 
  i 'd suggest a usb multiplug . 
  i use the targus branded one and it 's incredibly handy , if you have limited usb ports on your computer . 
  came here to say this,
