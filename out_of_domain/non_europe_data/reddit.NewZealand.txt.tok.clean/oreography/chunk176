  ### nice peer review, 
  god is as real as santa claus lololol, 
  just do n't bother with these types . 
  the argument goes nowhere . 
  the south ^ ^ island will rise again !, 
  / r/liberalreality is proud to endorse a sub as brave as his . 
  i even got a mod invite . 
  i do n't think it 's smug but it 's rehashing the tired space = atheism trope . 
  it does look great though ; i need to learn some of the new css3 effects myself . 
  i 'm not a libertarian but i 'm pretty sure there 's a profession that 's transformed sex into a market interaction for quite a long time . 
  yeah !, 
  what has philosophy done for us lately ? 
  suck on some science , continentals . 
  god i hate pc gamers . 
  it 's a platform preference , not your entire identity . 
  spanish colonialism was n't primarily driven by evangelism though . 
  the desire for a passage to india/asia for wealth + trade was much more important . 
  my star stuff t shirt will go well with my [ atheist shoes ] ( https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1497254033/atheist-shoes ), 
  how has the un not intervened yet !, 
  mario kart 8 will probably drive up sales a bit, 
  i see you 're originally from the uk . 
  as a new zealander planning to move to hong kong in a few years , what have you found the biggest differences are compared to the uk ? 
  do you speak any canto or putonghua , if not how do you find getting by solely speaking english ? 
  also how much are you paying in rent + what district ? 
  thank you for your advice . 
  i 've been twice already visiting and fell in love with the place . 
  the city has just got an amazing energy about it . 
  from everything i 've read , especially post handover , english useage has declined in favour of putonghua . 
  have you noticed much of a change since your childhood in the pre handover days ? 
  the rent issue is crazy . 
  i feel terrible for the locals and can definitely understand the locals resentment towards mainlanders , if you could n't get accomodation because of them flooding the market . 
  i go on / r/hongkong quite a bit , it 's how i found this thread !, 
  you 're not the only one . 
  australian 's are loud , easy going , have an awful accent , love the beach and drink too much . 
  they 're really complete opposites of kiwis . 
  original surface pro 's are $ 750 at the moment and the pro 2 probably will be as well this time next year . 
  a good choice for a premiumish casual use laptop . 
  i think anti-theism and dickery will always overlap . 
  if you 're actively working towards the elimination of religion , then you can not respect someone 's beliefs because you feel they 're harmful to society . 
  there 's no way to leave the subject alone , because you feel some sort of godless conviction to insult + demean peoples beliefs , in order to make the world better . 
  it 's not what you say that matters , it 's how we see you that defines who you are . 
  you belong to us neil , our patron saint of science . 
  / r/atheismrebooted is obscure ? 
  reported to / r/antiatheismwatch . 
  based on this twitter status https://twitter.com/richarddawkins/status/448240882710757376, 
  do n't feel ashamed of being brave . 
  the rest of reddit will gladly let net neutrality be destroyed by comcast and a fundie theocracy reign on the internet , the last bastion of free speech . 
  stop . 
  think . 
  never let them win , this is our territory and we must fight to prevent the fundies winning . 
  this is a war over ideology and we can not lose . 
  we have sagan on our side and we will be victorious . 
  friend you 're missing your angel arrows, 
  there they are . 
  hong kongers have a long love affair with mcdonalds . 
  it 's also supposedly the cheapest in the world there . 
  the extreme right wing . 
  the `` right wing '' as in the conservatives in uk + canada or the liberal party in australia are not `` fascists '' nor even the republican party in america . 
  that 's akin to saying the left wing of any country are `` communists '' . 
  it 's only usually a minority party in the extreme left so its very disingenuous to label them all as such . 
  to label your delusional characterizations of conservative politics as `` political science 101 '' is hilarious . 
  do you honestly think journalism is part of the `` atheist western agenda '' . 
  as far as i 'm aware , there is nothing in the qur ` an against disseminating news . 
  hear hear !,

  comcast shill pls go, 
  reddit is on the adblock whitelist . 
  it only removes overly obtrusive ads now , but you can manually set it to be blocked yourself . 
  that 's odd . 
  i tried myself but am not sure how to manually add sites to be blocked . 
  you can create custom filters but there 's nowhere to clearly add a website . 
  i 'm sure you can do it somehow . 
  it wo n't ever be removed . 
  just like / r/pics , there needs to be a general sub to dump videos . 
  it does n't matter about the quality , only the popularity . 
  everyone looks for a scapegoat , it does n't matter what the ideology is . 
  i consider it a badge of honour that i 'm banned from reddit 's biggest persecution complex, 
  no that 's atheismrebooted . 
  adviceatheists has always been devoted to maymays . 
  no u !, 
  st raegan , surprisingly the patron saint of communism . 
  it 's a british expression not someone being prudish .

  the dark ages are over , now it 's time for reason to reign . 
  [ ] ( / research ), 
  the lamestream media sheeple look at hashtags , that 's why . 
  the more we hashtag , the more atheism is on the news !!, 
  \\ #qed \\ #science \\ #fundiescan ` thandlemytags, 
  how do you respond to this damning ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ real allegation ? 
  i do n't think fps games are worse now but that subreddit has a hard time accepting some things may have actually been better in the past . 
  if we 're on video games , there were far better big budget platformers in the 90s and early 2000s for example than there are now . 
  all mario titles . 
  yes big budget platformers do exist but in lesser quantities and are mostly nintendo games . 
  there was rare , insomniac + naughty dog on ps1 and far more other platformers in the previous generations . 
  just shop at the markets in mong kok , ride the peak tram + take the star ferry + mtr and watch the light show at the harbour .
