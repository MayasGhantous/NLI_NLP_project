  i 'm not saying it 's a coincidence that somebody registered your username here , just that you do n't `` own '' your username on different sites . 
  you registered it on reddit and its property of reddit now . 
  they can delete your account here if you break the rules , same as the person using your account on whoaverse, 
  i 'm sure it was lovely but the hdr effect makes it looks worse , not better . 
  it 's not inherently a bad thing , it 's just the way he worded the title makes it sound as if it has n't been edited . 
  that does n't detract from it being an incredibly good photo of course . 
  do you want a heart , or would you prefer a smiley face ? 
  there 's rationing here so i can only give out so many . 
  if someone says it 's an `` amazing photo '' people assume that it 's the photographic skill that made it amazing , rather than the effects applied . 
  does stewart island actually support the highlanders ? 
  i guess southland does n't have a super 15 ? 
  rugby team . 
  also / u/madvix since you seem to be from stewart island , have you seen any wild kiwis ? 
  i 've heard stewart island is one of two places in the country you can see them . 
  religion = child prostitution and slavery, 
  what ? 
  are you seriously saying that we 're not automatically enlightened and our characterizations of religious people are as bad as their characterizations of us ? 
  i have a 10 step plan for you fundie ... ** go fuck yourself **, 
  not constructive . 
  yes evangelical terminology can be cringeworthy , but this is n't helpful . 
  your username on reddit is the property of reddit . 
  they can take it away from you if they wish and delete your account , since it never belonged to you . 
  you are a user of the site and your account + name belongs to them . 
  no reddit ca n't stop you using the same username on a different site , when registered your name will become property of whatever site you 're using it on . 
  what can stop you using a name somewhere else is a person registering it on a different site , since it will be assigned to that user but like any other account , will ultimately be the property of a website . 
  your username is n't comparable to citizenship , it 's more like a library membership which you can be removed from if you break the rules . 
  i perfectly understand what property is . 
  property is about ownership and a website owns your username . 
  amaefm is embedded into the database reddit is using , so is a part of reddit and therefore owned by the website . 
  it gives them ownership of a username but your username is not comparable to your real name . 
  do you not understand that ? 
  reddit does n't care if you 've been using it since the very first forum on the web , as they ultimately control how its used on this website . 
  your username has not legal rights and is n't even owned by you , it 's the property of any website you use it on . 
  even if scotland does become independent , it wo n't necessarily change the image of scotland , particularly the crass stereotypes among many brits . 
  if you 're voting yes , make sure it 's an informed vote . 
  do n't blame the rest of the uk if you vote as a `` fuck you '' and then discovering that scotland is n't magically better , and may actually be in a worse position after independence . 
  the yes voters are resorting to pathetic tactics now . 
  new zealand has a free travel arrangement with australia however . 
  no , they 're getting downvoted because they 're off topic . 
  which would be the exact same response if / r/atheism asked for your favourite atheist scientists , and i posted mendel or newton or coperniucus . 
  hey , if you really want a game i can probably shout you one . 
  10 bucks or under though . 
  no problem . 
  my steam library is ridiculous . 
  i bought age of empires 2 hd and skyrim for like 10 bucks this time , but i 'm at nearly 200 games . 
  now days the only game i 'm playing on pc is cod like a casual . 
  it 's okay because consoles are clearly superior . 
  i 'm enjoying gravity rush at the moment . 
  edit : down votes ? 
  really ? 
  haha because choice of gaming platform gets a lot of people very emotional . 
  it 's sort of a meta joke to say `` downvotes , really ? '', 
  when you say something controversial, 
  are you avin a giggle m8 ? 
  i think the dutch deserve to win the cup this time . 
  i 'm actually a kiwi but am rooting for the dutch . 
  just about a third of the people at my high school were dutch . 
  the principle has dutch ancestry as well . 
  did you actually watch the video ? 
  yes it 's a little sensationalized but the statistics it gives are shocking . 
  i do n't think this video pointed fingers at the working class migrants . 
  those that are coming to the sar to work hard and are n't treating the place like any other city in china are n't targeted , it 's those that use the place to smuggle goods and practice terrible manners that are being criticized . 
  if westerners were coming in their millions and had their children shit on the streets or smuggle goods , they would be rightly criticized as well . 
  i agree there is too much xenophobia in hk but it 's all a result of terrible policies by local and central government . 
  if visitor numbers were restricted and smuggling was dealt with , there would n't be such scorn . 
  an obvious example is reference to the dark ages myth , that if it was n't for christianity we would be in some sort of technological utopia now . 
  this not only ignores developments in china and the middle east during the middle ages , but also the role of monks preserving much of the knowledge after the fall of rome . 
  it 's a big turnout for a non official poll . 
  if there was a government sanctioned referendum , you can bet the figures would be far greater . 
  because it is . 
  if you were visting north korea , they would happily remove it from you . 
  ** gravity rush **, 
  i bought a vita two weeks ago and bought it , ffx hd and tearaway . 
  it 's one of the most fun games i 've played in a long time . 
  the flying mechanics are the best i 've seen in a game and make it enjoyable just to explore the city . 
  there are gems to pick up all around the place , which you can boost your stats + gravity abilities with so they do have strategic value . 
  the two main abilities are flying and `` gravity sliding '' which uses the vita accelerometer which makes it tough to not crash into a wall , though its a less important ability and mostly just for fun . 
  the artwork and design style is inventive and accomodates the world shifting perspective well . 
  i 'm on chapter 9 at the moment and my one criticism is that it 's perhaps too easy , at least now . 
  there was one hidden boss i attempted and he really was difficult , but the main story missions are pretty simple so far . 
  anyone getting a vita with their ps4 or who have one already should pick it up . 
  from what i 've read it 's the killer original exclusive on the system, 
  hotline miami is fantastic . 
  i picked it up for 6 bucks on vita and the controls really suit it . 
  you can touch to lock the aim on someone and it 's a good pick up and play style for a handheld . 
  vita e bella !, 
  i 'm sure they would issue an exception for religious reasons . 
  funny how they 're `` skanks '' when they 're not fawning over you . 
  you ca n't put a price on freedom, 
  how much do you need ? 
  any recipe i 've seen calls for a couple drops at most . 
  / unjerk split screen and online are n't mutually exclusive . 
  look at cod , smash bros , halo , motorstorm or tekken . 
  dae this is good because i do n't have friends ? 
  good exclusives . 
  there still are n't enough but what tipped me over the edge was remote play , since i have a cfw ps3 . 
  it has n't worked as well as in the youtube videos i watched unfortunately , i 'm still trying to improve it . 
  i 've been enjoying gravity rush + miami hotline though , + got tearaway , nfs + final fantasy x. 
  that 's what we in the scientific community call a peer review . 
  literally burnt a marc driscoll book to say this .
