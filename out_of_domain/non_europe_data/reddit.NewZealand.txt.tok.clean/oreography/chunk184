  i 'm rooting for the dutch but i liked the german t shirt more :(, 
  have you heard of hilltop hoods ? 
  that 's why people do n't rap in an aussie accent . 
  that 's not even a new zealand accent . 
  nobody pronounces deck as `` dick '' it 's more like `` dekk '' with a gnarl at the end . 
  my first thought was that the guy was south african . 
  edit : you can hear a reasonable range of nz accents in one of our panel shows .

  without a doubt the finest gaming soundtrack ever made . 
  i listen to the soundtrack all the time . 
  only for multiplayer games , as part of the reason for them is to test the online functionality .

  this is the first i 've heard of priests being monitored as well . 
  freedom of religion as well as speech being encroached on , it 's becoming more like the mainland every day :(, 
  the eu parliament is destroyed in favour of a us consolate . 
  all bicycles in brussels are replaced with chevrolets and mexican immigrants manning the gas stations . 
  belgium then confirmed as 51st state . 
  the majority in hong kong do want the change , it 's why you see such a massive turnout for the protests . 
  this is a city that enjoyed decades of essentially being a western country , to being governed by a country that only ever ruled it 150 years previously when it was a fishing village . 
  the majority in china perhaps are happy with the ccp , and it 's true they have brought much needed stability and economic growth , but part of the reason why they 're content with the status quo is because they 've never experienced anything else . 
  you ca n't compare all of china , where in small towns having electricity is a comparatively recent phenomenon , to a city that never endured the worst of the cultural revolution or collective failure of mao 's policies . 
  hong kong have experienced significant freedoms for decades unlike the mainland and do not want to lose them . 
  your example is completely flawed . 
  a better example would be if west berlin was ceded to east germany later in the cold war , but allowed to keep some of the customs it already enjoyed . 
  hong kongers already know what they want , as they 've been experiencing greater personal , societal and economic freedoms up until recently . 
  as the mainland is beginning to crack down further and their culture is being eroded , can you blame them for protesting . 
  yes the opium wars were unjust however the ccp is a successor state to the qing dynasty in name only . 
  the colonial government themselves only treated hong kongers as equals until after ww2 . 
  however out of the injustices of colonialism came one of the greatest cities on earth . 
  it is not wrong to want to protect that , even if its origins are not noble . 
  well for one the recently released white paper , that dictated that the mainland government has ultimate say over the one country , two systems policy , a breach of what was agreed upon when both the chinese + british signed the joint declaration . 
  as the rights of the basic law begin to be eroded , there is less freedom than existed before . 
  another is the reports of self censorship in the media , with journalists being attacked . 
  or the ccp linked groups counter protesting falun gong . 
  you ca n't blame hong kong for the problems it did n't create . 
  what choice do they have in global influence , when their government is at the whims of the mainland . 
  hong kong no longer shapes its foreign policy and many locals are fed up with the visaless tourism and excessive immigration . 
  i agree that there are some hong kongers who have irrational dislike for mainlanders and want to feel superior , but for the most part hong kongers just want to be left alone ... a hard task when 50 million chinese are visiting annually .

  from 30 seconds browsing the site i had to go back about 15 different pages . 
  the mobile site is more intuitive than the main one . 
  i was just about to post this . 
  good to see them offering the service built in , even if there were workarounds . 
  yeah , we 're totally `` playing '' the two most powerful countries on earth . 
  we trade and are partners with both the us and china and are trying to navigate being partners with both , but do n't think that we somehow are outsmarting them . 
  perhaps if there was significant international pressure , then britain would actually do something . 
  of course neither parties , china or the uk are interested . 
  there 's nobody who cares to hear hong kong 's voice . 
  certainly there are those within the ccp that would like to see democracy , but the majority of them are simply looking out for themselves . 
  it 's an issue of remaining in power moreso than any ideological goal . 
  in the 80s they threw away any real communist principles that the party had . 
  this is n't nearly editorialized enough .

  did you watch the video ? 
  the lady was seen as inferior to the other , because her skin did n't look white enough . 
  yes , but not out of perceived necessity or because they feel inferior , which is what the commercial was portraying . 
  because white skin is a trait of fewer racial groups . 
  hair colour is more diverse but it could be considered racist if portrayed the way it was in this commercial . 
  if there was a commercial in japan for hair dying product , that projected that the girl would be lonely and unattractive if she did n't have blonde hair , would you not consider that racist ? 
  that a entire races inherent physical traits make them less attractive than someone else and in order to rectify this they need to purchase products to make them more attractive . 
  define `` white guilt '' . 
  it seems more a convenient label for shoving off criticism than anything else . 
  there is no difference in the polygamy argument - consenting adults who love each other , it 's only a difference in numbers . 
  homosexuality was considered `` degeneracy '' two decades ago but societal standards change . 
  haha this is fantastic ... brilliantly awful . 
  yes !, 
  ** i just lost three childhoods !, 
  yeah and qatari 's definitely are n't racist either . 
  they treat their bangladeshi `` workers '' so well .

  i have no idea why the mods have n't bothered banning you yet . 
  i 've never seen you post a comment that actually contributes to the discussion , unless dae hate john key counts as a contribution . 
  no major politician is calling for us to ditch the monarchy . 
  it 's a non issue for most new zealanders and is n't likely to change . 
  why are we outsourcing the job to canada ? 
  would n't a internal department in the reserve bank be a better choice ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  his reign will be less than two decades and then the line will pass to king william , who is bound to be more popular .
