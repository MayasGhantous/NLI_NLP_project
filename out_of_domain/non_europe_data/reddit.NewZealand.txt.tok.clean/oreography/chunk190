  i would suggest looking at gamerankings.com and sorting by genre . 
  here are my picks regardless, 
  ** action-adventure **, 
  gravity rush , my favourite game but there 's a lot in this genre . 
  ** anime **, 
  i do n't even get why this is a genre . 
  p4g probably ? 
  ** fighting **, 
  playstation all stars is fun but is 3d , though there 's never anyone online . 
  someone else suggested blazblue, 
  ** rpg **, 
  persona 4 probably ( have n't played it ) , final fantasy x hd or ys memories of celcata ( have n't played ), 
  ** racing **, 
  need for speed most wanted, 
  ** shooting **, 
  killzone liberation , hands down, 
  do yourself a favour and at least pick up killzone and gravity rush, 
  it sounds like your friends views line up more with new zealand first or labour , more center left/right than the greens are . 
  `` reality has a green bias '' - le me   , 
  not mine . 
  i was n't planning on voting national this election anyways . 
  labour 's leadership puts me off but i 'll probably end up voting labour , greens are too left wing for me though i do like their it and public transport proposals . 
  i got new zealand first on the two main online surveys but i regard winston even less than cunliffe . 
  `` censorship '' is another byword for moderation . 
  on reddit the moderators have control over the subreddits , not the users : see the / r/atheism fiasco for evidence that 's the case . 
  if your post was filtered by automoderator , message the mods and they can try to sort it out . 
  i 'm glad we have moderation here , especially around the time of the election . 
  democracy simply does n't work on the internet . 
  `` opposing viewpoints '' would be anyone supporting the right on this subreddit . 
  would you prefer self congratulatory echo chamber ? 
  sadly i 'm the opposite . 
  i 've been a loyal firefox user for years like most of this sub but recently i kept having recurring bookmark and performance issues with 30 + tabs . 
  i 'm on an i7 machine with 8 gig of ram and firefox would have the system crawl to a slow , all extensions up to date etc. 
  a script would always freeze when opening up the bookmarks , i tried one of the workarounds and they did n't work . 
  i 'll still use firefox for downthemall , scrapbook and firebug but the performance on chrome is noticeably better . 
  i only wish chrome handled tabs like firefox , i 've got some tab add on to help but it really is very poor . 
  i think you 're having trouble disassociating richard dawkins with your presumably atheist beliefs . 
  do n't take an insult to him as an insult on your belief system , he 's just a person after all . 
  not surprising a regular circlebroke poster is a religious shill . 
  seriously jamie , did you think the collective intellect of the reddit atheist community would n't figure you out eventually . 
  the games up and your crucifix is showing . 
  i 'm telling you ( yes you ) and the rest of you religious morons from / r/circlebroke2 to get the fuck off the internet . 
  if anyone sees any more of this blatant brigading from that cesspit , report it to / r/antiatheismwatch . 
  i 'm so progressive i do n't even beat women !, 
  i 've actually found most non denoms are pentecostal/evangelical, 
  most embarrassing thing i 've seen out of that sub yet, 
  do you even atheism ? 
  and it 's almost like there is a majority view which characterizes this board that can be referenced as well . 
  can confirm that i never saw that error . 
  can gareth host a separate ama on / r/nzcirclejerk ? 
  if we lived in an alternate reality without religion then religious people would n't have done anything , therefore science preserved those writings and monks did n't . 
  just let science into your heart already . 
  no , this is an example of institutional homophobia that is long past its expiry date . 
  we 've come a long way in acceptance of gsm people in this country and yet still gsm 's are literally being segregated . 
  this is blood apartheid , nothing more . 
  if a gay man wants to give blood it is his decision and his decision alone , not medical professionals or hospitals . 
  to refuse lgbt * people is systemic discrimination and akin to saying their blood is dirty . 
  please educate yourself before commenting on matters such as this . 
  so inspiring to see a true follower of sam harris . 
  i hope to one day reach that level of scientific devotion . 
  edit : `` asking the question `` does god exist ? '', 
  to me is n't a philosophical question . 
  it 's a scientific one '' . 
  this is officially the dumbest sentence i 've read on the internet . 
  i 'm not going to read 6 paragraphs of bigotry , sorry . 
  the arguments over and you have nothing but vitirol for lgbt folks . 
  there 's nothing more to say . 
  lol . 
  the glorious revolution will destroy the monarchy and move the capital to dundee too !, 
  i believe silverlight is more reliable than flash . 
  it 's a dying add on though , soon you 'll get your drm via html5 !, 
  do you think there is a need for a homosexual chaperone system as well ? 
  they are so innocent but when they go out to run and play in a big city , they get overly excited and hard to control . 
  the poor things do n't even know what they 're surroundings are . 
  leaving them to go out by themselves is completely negligent . 
  one local homosexual in my town ran across the street without a chaperone nearby and the next thing you know he was run over . 
  with homosexuals being carefully controlled and monitored at all times on a extended leash held by their licensed chaperone , we can ensure their safety in our community . 
  family outings used to be great at the local gay bar . 
  now with all the gays taking over its ruined the atmosphere . 
  how are the conservatives going to get 6 seats ? 
  i thought 5 % would mean they only got one ? 
  but if they do n't get the 5 % they get zero correct , unless craig can magically get epsom . 
  well it will be interesting how the results go . 
  6 conservative mps coming from zero would be pretty crazy . 
  ah , thanks for the correction . 
  the psychology behind this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/selective_exposure_theory, 
  i 've seen tons of these posts , often cited by ratheists about how positive and effective / r/atheism is . 
  my personal favourite is still the person who became an atheist because pokemon was n't real . 
  kick out the bloody benefit scroungers and leave the eu !, 
  restore christianity in all state schools and abolish the nhs , homosexuality and the islamic religion . 
  play god save the queen before every workplace meeting . 
  get rid of the internet , bring back the postal service and the telephone exchange . 
  invade india , australia and hong kong to restore the colonies . 
  make britain great again !, 
  what part of the south island are you starting in ? 
  queenstown and otago are very windy . 
  i would n't wish anyone to cycle the devils staircase . 
  major cities i believe its okay , probably better than america but not all that great . 
  christchurch is pretty average at the moment with all the road works . 
  it would be my pleasure .
