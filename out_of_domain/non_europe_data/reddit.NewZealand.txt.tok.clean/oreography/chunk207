  british tea !, 
  well , not anymore ... 
  ##### listen the fuck up fundie, 
  atheism is the default state . 
  we are all born atheist . 
  the trees are atheists , the rocks are atheists . 
  i feel the atheism in the wind , blowing a godless breeze around the world . 
  it is only through the literal child abuse of reliegion that people are brainwashed into believing anything else . 
  ** therefore ** burden of proof strawman ad nilho hominem tu quoque qed . 
  i win . 
  yeah fgm is absolutely cultural . 
  it 's not in the quran at all , might as well blame the pederasty common in afghanistan on islam while you 're at it . 
  and flores i believe is majority catholic . 
  sad to see people squabbling over the great institution of the monarchy in this thread . 
  the queen 's christmas message had a valuable lesson this year , reconciliation . 
  political differences or not , let 's put them aside over christmas . 
  `` are you a catholic atheist or a protestant atheist ? '', 
  he has ten years in him at most , then it will be william who 's incredibly popular . 
  you disgust me, 
  the kennedy 's would have been the closest thing really ... 
  you realize that an average person going up to hug the president of a country would be in breach of `` presidential protocol '' as well . 
  likewise you do n't randomly hug members of the armed forces . 
  protocol is n't something unique to royalty . 
  yes there is . 
  it 's just she 's also queen of scotland , wales , northern ireland and the entire commonwealth as well . 
  her name was cloud and she passed away in 2011, 
  historic japanese battles . 
  oh there 's a giant enemy crab ... 
  both are made in china ? 
  not wanting to sound like a piracy apologist , but it 's not enforced properly because it 's so hard to enforce . 
  it 's very easy for people to spoof their ip 's with vpns and other software . 
  then even if you do find the ip , it could be in a flat where the person paying the internet bill is n't the person who 's doing the pirating . 
  south africa is regarded as the worlds most diverse country . 
  remove republique . 
  most englishmen hate the prick and rightfully so . 
  he tried to tear the country apart . 
  [ the face of pure evil ] ( http://img.spokeo.com/public/900-600/alex_salmond_2006_04_02.jpg ), 
  personally i prefer the metro ie as it 's designed for the os , though i 've had some annoying issues with windows freezing and the space bar not working properly after typing a few sentences . 
  i just use desktop firefox if i want more serious browsing . 
  it would be nice if google fixes regular chrome for touch devices . 
  what have you got against swedish people ?!?!?!??!?!, 
  because judaism is an ethno-religious religion . 
  the religion is passed down through the maternal side , so you need to have jewish bloodline to be jewish . 
  if you have safety concerns you could always join a tour group . 
  i liked it better than the interview myself . 
  lmbo, 
  ha , i was meaning the movie . 
  gib explanation, 
  remember when they got on srd for when their autowikibot advocated piracy ? 
  that community has always been a piece of shit . 
  i play on both pc and consoles , each have their advantage . 
  whatever platform you play video games on does n't even matter , let alone make you superior for doing so . 
  i think it 's because pc gaming often attracts an elitist mentality . 
  i 've noticed the same in android and linux communities as well . 
  whatever platform is technically more advanced makes people think they 're superior to others . 
  because they are . 
  just because you call it a joke does n't mean it is any longer . 
  nor does it excuse the incredibly childish behaviour of the posters in the community . 
  how do you keep churning out such brilliant humour ? 
  also has anyone told you you 're literally the next father ted ? 
  we are the last remaining vestige of little england in new zealand . 
  we 'll have none of that sort of `` cycling '' nonsense , sounds awfully communist . 
  i do n't think the usa has that bad a reputation in nz . 
  i mean the us is one of our biggest holiday destinations and we lap up american media like there 's no tomorrow . 
  i 'd hazard there 's far more xenophobia towards chinese than americans . 
  the fact that you think it has no effect on you is one of the main reasons why people do n't take stoners seriously . 
  can you believe we let women drive here ? 
  we are so progressive !, 
  i think that 's the importance of the concept of free speech though . 
  people can say what they wish , however it does n't mean that we have to approve of what they 're saying , it just means they are allowed to say it . 
  if these cartoonists are being made martyrs , it 's for the concept of being able to speak freely and not for what they wrote . 
  i think some people have trouble distinguishing between the two . 
  after viewing some some of the comics i thought they were crude and lacking nuance.they were as much for shock value as for whatever message they carried . 
  you raise some excellent points , particularly in regard to academia . 
  the idea of a `` safe space '' at universities is noble , but if it stops intellectual pursuit because certain ideas are effectively made taboo , then the entire nature of the institution is put at risk . 
  safe spaces should be available for those that need them and want them , but others do not require them . 
  to enforce them over everyone else to protect a few is n't effective , and can lead to a backlash against feminist and social justice views at universities . 
  thank you for sharing your experiences , even if they are difficult . 
  i 'm wondering , are you in canada or australia ? 
  i was thinking the uk until you mentioned the governor general . 
  there was a big story about an undercover pedophile ring in westminster in the 80s , which although was n't confirmed , i can definitely believe happened . 
  like most other sexual abuses , it was easier to get away with it in the past than it is now , though evidently from what you 've mentioned , it 's still fairly prevalent . 
  i have n't heard of object rape . 
  what is it ? 
  if you believe in moral relativism perhaps . 
  i believe wager western culture and the ideals it stands for is superior to islamic culture . 
  how can you say all culture 's are equal when some stand for reprehensible values ? 
  do you believe the culture of mauritania which permits owning slaves is equal to that of france 's or germany 's ? 
  ask the person who removed the kebab man . 
  do n't forget the tamil tigers . 
  then again they 're long gone too . 
  that 's despicable . 
  have there been any investigations related to this organization , or is just too well hidden ? 
  ah right , thanks for the explanation . 
  your so blimmin funny mrs brown !, 
  i dropped my digestive in my cup of barry 's , that 's high praise for ye . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ do ^ ^ ^ ^ hate ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ poofs ^ ^ ^ ^ thought ^ ^ ^ ^ right ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ i 'd ^ ^ ^ ^ be ^ ^ ^ ^ uncomfortable ^ ^ ^ ^ otherwise, 
  no , this is true . 
  apostasy is seen as essentially an unforgivable sin and the poster below has provided a source .
