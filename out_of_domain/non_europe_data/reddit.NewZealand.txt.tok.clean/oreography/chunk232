  reign of terror 2 : 21st century boogaloo ? 
  the chileans actually have a permanent civilian town in antarctica . 
  it has a school and post office . 
  yes he contributed so much to the discussion ... 
  i 'm against sweden 's naive immigration policy but i do n't think a sarcastic comment offers anything substantial . 
  your username is telling, 
  to be honest i only linked this because the article is genuinely one of the stupidest things i 've seen written in a uk paper . 
  i was hoping to have some actual discussion about it , but i see that people dislike it so much they 're just downvoting, 
  sorry what ? 
  the uk has been growing faster than a lot of other european economies - so much so that they overtook france recently to become the worlds fifth largest . 
  the pound is still significantly higher than the aud . 
  considering brits already have the right to move to just about anywhere in europe of their choosing . 
  i think you 're overestimating how many would move , if they had the option . 
  if the poorest people in the uk wanted to get out of the country they could have already done so in france , italy , germany etc. 
  because coincidentally they are the most successful commonwealth countries . 
  as others have noted , the public schooling quality in new zealand is on average quite good . 
  however as always , some schools are better than others . 
  in major cities , public high schools operate via zoning - so they will only enrol students who live within a radius from the school . 
  usually the top public schools are in some of the more expensive areas of new zealand cities , so parents will sometimes go to the length of moving houses to get their child enrolled . 
  one friend of mines parents did this . 
  we like her but she 's overexposed in the media . 
  every time she releases a new music video , it will receive a short segment in the national news about it ( wish i was making this up ) . 
  no , unlike australia we have very few poisonous creatures . 
  in fact new zealand is one of very few countries on earth to have no snakes . 
  in web development $ 50,000 nzd ( currently $ 33,000 usd because the exchange rate is awful at the moment ) would be a reasonable starting wage . 
  as a rule of thumb in the southern hemisphere , the farther south you are , the colder the climate . 
  at the very top of the north island around auckland there is a semi tropical climate . 
  the summers are generally pleasant and much nicer than you get in the uk . 
  in the south island from christchurch downwards , the winters can be cold and just as cold as in london . 
  you will get a lot of rain in auckland in winter but it rarely snows and does n't frost . 
  much less rain than england though . 
  we have a few anglophiles , but the general feeling here is probably similar to you with the portuguese ( minus the slavery and sacking of your gold and resources ) . 
  we have a strong cultural connection to them , but the relationship soured since the british empire dismantled after ww2 and in the 70s they effectively turned their back on us by joining the european economic community ... which meant we lost a lot of trade . 
  there are still a lot of new zealanders who work in london after graduating but the general feeling is one of indifference . 
  most of us value the british cultural heritage we have , but at the same time recognize that we have our own identity now , especially for those of non british ethnic backgrounds . 
  british comedy is still popular though , and it 's really impossible to understate our cultural ties . 
  we play the same sports as them . 
  speak the same language . 
  were educated in english style schools . 
  had the same religion . 
  shared the same cuisine until globalization ( sunday roast , fish and chips , drinking tea etc ) . 
  wellington is a good alternative ... well really it 's the only alternative . 
  maori is fairly easy to pronounce . 
  the only things in that sentence that no tourist would get right would be :, 
  `` whatake '' and `` whenua '' . 
  in maori the wh is pronounced as f . so read fa-take and fenua . 
  also `` maunga '' they pronounce deeply , so `` maooowwnga '' . 
  our news broadcasters over the last two decades have become more culturally aware , so they sometimes will go to exaggerated efforts to get the maori pronounciation right , which new zealanders tend to mock . 
  there will be some , but only a very small percentage of the new zealand population is fluent in maori , so the market is small . 
  i would guess that the biggest market for maori literature is actually childrens books for maori classes at school . 
  a lot of new zealand literature deals with maori culture though . 
  notably witi ihamaera and also keri hulme , who won the booker prize for her novel . 
  as for new zealand literature : katherine mansfield , janet frame , maurice gee & witi ihimaera are some of the biggest names . 
  eleanor catton also won the booker prize last year for her book `` the luminaries '' . 
  it 's a friendly rivalry . 
  we 're so similar culturally it 's like the kind of rivalry you have between a little brother and a big brother . 
  ultimately we get on better than just about any other neighbouring countries ... maybe because we 've got a sea between us if they start yelling too much . 
  some of my favourite new zealand films are :, 
  ** what we do in the shadows ** - vampire comedy set in wellington . 
  ** heavenly creatures ** - film about a historic murder . 
  set in christchurch, 
  ** in my fathers den ** - film about a broken family and family secrets . 
  set in the rural south island , based on a book by maurice gee . 
  ** boy ** - a coming of age movie set in a maori community on the east coast of the north island . 
  if you watch all of those , you 'll get a good insight into new zealand culture . 
  similar to portuguese 's number system , so they 'll be fine with it . 
  mince and cheese is standard , but at most bakeries you 'll find a selection of gourmet pies , often with flavours like : butter chicken , lamb & kumara ( sweet potato ) , satay chicken , plumb & venison etc. 
  they even have a pie awards every year http://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/food-wine/70431289/new-zealands-best-pie-announced, 
  i had a cachaca one the other day in christchurch ... but it was at a latin restaurant . 
  even had feijoada and pao de queijo :d, 
  if i had to ask one thing , it would be : what 's your favourite city/town in brazil ? 
  also why was anitta 's latest album so awful ? 
  i know it 's generic pop music , but i still think meu lugar was a great live album . 
  sorry if there was any confusion , yeah . 
  the exchange rate used to be much better - for a short while we were nearly equal with the aud . 
  haha i like some better artists like caetano veloso and legiao urbana , but you ca n't deny some of her stuff was pretty catchy . 
  at least i 'm not a baile funk fan !, 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ liike ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ bunda ^ ^ ^ though, 
  oh that 's cool - sp seems chaotic , especially the traffic jams . 
  i like visiting massive cities though . 
  they both look really cool . 
  i 'd heard of gramado before ; all those germanic towns in south brazil are something you would never have expected in brazil . 
  a lot of people i 've talked to say florio is their favourite city . 
  underrated bost : dd, 
  season 3 and 4 are effectively a separate spin off show . 
  they changed every character except for his sister , and created an entirely new plot . 
  i disliked everything after one and two myself . 
  three was watchable but i never really liked the new characters . 
  i honestly thought your comment was sarcastic . 
  cook was the most generic chav character they ever put in the show . 
  also utterly dislikeable `` i 'm fookin cook '', 
  the only real interesting character in season 3 + 4 was the indian lead . 
  you 're throwing a lot of claims out , but not providing any proof . 
  it 's true that charles has used his influence to lobby for certain law changes , but if the queen were to truly use the extent of her power , the support for the monarchy would drop substantially . 
  no , but it was n't modernized . 
  i think that 's his point - they brought modern technology and industry to india . 
  the railroads , the telegraph ( then the telephone and radio ) , newspapers , factories , road networks etc. 
  as well as mismanaging famines and disregarding the cares of the local population ... but you ca n't deny they did n't bring their technological prowess to india . 
  over twenty nine countries recognize the armenian genocide . 
  i do n't believe france or sweden see turks as lesser people .
