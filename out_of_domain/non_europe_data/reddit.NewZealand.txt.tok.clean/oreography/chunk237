  britain is synonymous with the united kingdom ( uk : the country ), 
  great britain is the island that makes up most of britain/the uk . 
  england is one of the four countries of britain/the uk . 
  ** tldr : **, 
  ** great britain = the island **, 
  ** the united kingdom ( uk ) / britain = the country which governs the island ( + northern ireland , channel islands and british territories overseas ) **, 
  ** england = country within a country ( uk/britain ) **,

  as he said : americans . 
  this has been going on for a century . 
  obviously immigrant groups in the united states have a connection to their ancestral homelands , but no other group seems to be quite as invested in their heritage as irish americans are . 
  yet even despite that they still have universal health care, 
  true , but more importantly it 's because we probably have less human history than any other nation on earth . 
  before you discount maori history which is interesting , bear in mind that maori 's only arrived from elsewhere in polynesia in the middle ages ( around the 13th century or slightly earlier ) . 
  until the maoris arrived , new zealand had zero human settlement for millenia . 
  it 's one of the reasons why our environment is so unique - as for millions of years it developed with zero human/humanoid contact . 
  bringing up examples who were politicallly unrecognized and each lasted a grand total of three years ( catalonia free state and ukranian free terrritory ) would n't seem to qualify as a success . 
  the zapatistas seem more admirable , especially their fighting for the rights of indigenous people , but they have no sovereign control over any territory . 
  all i 'm saying is that it never has `` worked '' . 
  there has been no true communist society ever built , because they inevitably fail to give up control , and never follow through on marx 's plan for an egalitarian socialist collective . 
  good stuffing complements the meat well . 
  the real purpose is that it adds moisture to the inside of the roast . 
  a lot of people comment on the similarities of us to england , especially in rural new zealand . 
  you 're not quite right on the homogeneity though . 
  69 % of new zealand is white vs 90 % of australia . 
  you would n't know it if you were only talking about sydney and melbourne though , which are very diverse cities . 
  auckland is definitely the most ethnically diverse part of the country . 
  the south island in particular is closer to what you would describe as england from decades ago . 
  most of the population lives in urban areas , but you 're never really far away from the countryside . 
  in christchurch you can even buy `` lifestyle blocks '' , which are easentially mini farms while still being on the outskirts of the city . 
  definitely very little drama here , but i think young people can at least have a reasonably exciting youth in the main cities . 
  i mean we have all the same modernities as australia , and the internets better too , 
  hong kongers do n't care who rules them so long as their rights are respected . 
  the british administration left communities alone to live their lives . 
  the ccp ca n't help from interfering in them . 
  austria-hungary and the ottomans . 
  i was just looking at hawaiian place names and they 're really similar sounding to a lot of maori ones . 
  we all know how to say the most common ones , and the longest sounding place names tend to be tiny towns that nobody ever talks about . 
  over here it 's roughly half english place names and half maori place names . 
  though we do have the longest place name in the world :, 
  ** taumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateaturipukakapikimaungahoronukupokaiwhenuakitanatahu ** - proper pronounciation please , for cultural respect . 
  even orthodox jews do n't want `` all palestinians dead '' that 's pure hyperbole . 
  they do n't recognize palestinians have a claim over any land though , unlike other israelis . 
  pro palestinians always ignore that . 
  i suppose the difference was that they had a home to go too . 
  istanbul is still pretty safe though . 
  that sounds like a rare occurrence . 
  the war was beyond stupid , but the initial occupation would n't have been so totally mishandled if not for this man . 
  he was the main architect behind `` de-ba ` thification '' , which saw every capable member of the political and administrative services fired . 
  well india is a lot less safer than istanbul . 
  there are parts of turkey ( basically anything east of ankara , and especially anywhere close to the syrian border ) that i would n't visit as a tourist , but istanbul gets millions of western tourists every year . 
  it 's crime rate is not that high and comparable to other european cities . 
  it 's hard to generalize a whole country . 
  i have n't been to india , but i 've been to sri lanka twice and it was perfectly safe . 
  i would take more care as a women , but i 'm sure mumbai and delhi are relatively safe considering they get so many tourists . 
  as a rule of thumb for travelling , wherever there is a large number of tourists the area will usually be safe enough to visit . 
  while the world is n't perfect like a hollywood romance , neither is it a warzone like some hollywood action film . 
  every country has safe and relatively well off parts , even sub saharan africa . 
  love you trying to correct these racists but you 're wrong . 
  the oldest school in the world is in china . 
  the first civilizations arose out of mesopotamia/the middle east ( that 's why it 's called the cradle of civilization ) . 
  ancient egypt and nubia were some of the first great civilizations though and they arose of out africa . 
  as for religions , the oldest religion is hinduism in the indian subcontinent . 
  every society has had some form of spirituality though . 
  i do n't think black people had the first slaves . 
  every civilization practised slavery . 
  i think most people have good intentions when they try and give these compliments , but they do n't realize how condescending they sound to black people . 
  a better way of saying it would be `` you have lovely table manners '' . 
  then again , it depends on the tone for that as well . 
  niggas in selfridges, 
  i 'm well aware human life originated in africa and the first tribal societies and probably the first villages existed there , but in terms of civilizations the first recorded examples are in mesopotamia , though the indus valley civilization in the indian subcontinent has been rivalling them as more is discovered about them . 
  most ancient empires had early forms of schooling for an educated class of scribes including the greeks , romans and the great african civilization of egypt . 
  the oldest school still operating today in terms of still remaining on its original site is [ in china ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chengdu_shishi_high_school ) , which i mentioned considering you were referring to schools . 
  as for universities have you got a source for the universities in kush ? 
  google is giving me nothing . 
  the oldest university is said to have begun in morocco , but for centuries it operated as a madrassa or islamic school . 
  as far as the modern concept of a a university is concerned , it was set up by the catholic church in the middle ages . 
  the etymology comes from the latin universitas ( meaning a whole , a single body ) . 
  it was a single place where all subjects including science , theology , politics and law could be taught , unlike the former religious and administrative schools that had existed beforehand . 
  it pisses me off as much as you when these / pol / types come in and deny the real history of africa , but i think it 's wrong to over exaggerate the accomplishments of african civilizations . 
  it 's just as wrong as saying `` europe did everything first '' when the sumerians , assyrians , babylonians and egyptians all existed as great civilizations before the minoans and greeks came along . 
  brazil has a really interesting relationship to the church . 
  in the anglosphere world , increased church attendance usually corellates with increased piety . 
  there 's no bunda with the bible : we ca n't do debauchery and jesus together . 
  but in brazil you manage to be hedonists and pious at the same time . 
  the whole `` ines brasil '' celebrity they have , who shakes her ass but always gives thanks to god exemplifies what seems a parodox to us . 
  i guess catholicism has always permeated the culture more than protestantism . 
  huge difference between a class system created by wealth and an outright feudal system . 
  the professed values of the british government and british rule of law stressed equality and humanistic precepts at the time , even if they were n't practiced in india . 
  it 's definitely admirable , i just thought the execution was pretty cringeworthy . 
  possibly denmark . 
  iceland and norway are n't in the eu and denmark have had similar opt out provisions to the uk . 
  also similarly to the uk and with sweden as their neighbours , danes are very anti immigration . 
  that 's true , though more moved to auckland , dunedin or to commuter towns just outside of the city . 
  1 in 400,000 something chance . 
  we 're still bigger than all of iceland though .
