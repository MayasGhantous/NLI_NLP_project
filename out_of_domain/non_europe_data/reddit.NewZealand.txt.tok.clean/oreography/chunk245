  i do n't see people pulling out their ipads on commutes , but you 'll see a lot of them at an airport . 
  for short breaks away they 're popular laptop replacements . 
  it might seem shocking to americans , but outside of your country people take these strange things called `` trains '' to get to work . 
  just make sure you pay her . 
  honestly the most sensible use of the gamepad was just as a minimap + inventory . 
  it worked well in windwaker and having the map was essential in splatoon . 
  i also liked how it was used in gun game in black ops 2 . 
  it 's the only console where you could eliminate screen watching , as each player had their own screen . 
  do you really get cramps from the gamepad ? 
  it 's one of my favourite controllers , so i 've never had the issue . 
  i 'm sure that 's what they 'll end up doing on the switch version though . 
  i 'll echo what so many other posters are saying and say overwatch . 
  the only fps 's i was wildly addicted to were the older cod 's ( mw2 , black ops etc ) and tf2 years ago . 
  i would also nominate splatoon but it came out last year . 
  between those two , i probably spent the most time of any two games this year . 
  just bought nfs undercover , pikmin 3 and yoshi 's wooly world today , for the equivalent of 80 usd . 
  it 's the only console i 've actually bought games for in a long time . 
  yeah i had to laugh at his analogy of nintendo not being a gaming company . 
  nintendo is the only company that 's focused on games . 
  they started out making playing cards , but they left that business behind long ago . 
  four sentences and four strawman 's - that 's got to be a record . 
  your whole hypothetical rant was from the perspective of israeli 's ** ( `` we 're your greatest ally '' ) ** , and in that case it is a strawman . 
  as far as i 'm aware no israeli official has said anything of the sort . 
  they admit to being `` the only democracy in the region '' and a us ally , but no israeli official has had that much hubris to say they 're america 's greatest ally . 
  it 's a strawman used to criticize conservative supporters of israel , and is more commonly associated with the anti-semitic happy merchant meme . 
  enemy of the people, 
  if brexit is apart from brexit , then it ca n't be brexit . 
  honestly i think breath of the wild is shaping up to have the best utilization of them . 
  the only reason i bought twilight princess hd was to get my doggo in game . 
  probably pokemon blue , twilight princess and smash bros melee . 
  the rest are non nintendo games . 
  the independent has some of the worst clickbait online . 
  the telegraph and guardian are biased , but aside from their `` comment is free '' opinion blogs , they do provide good journalism . 
  you can get plenty of value out of a wii u if you softmod it to play wii and gamecube backups + emulators . 
  also i 'm sure the online services for many wii u games will be ending soon . 
  i 'm in the same boat - i `` m sure i 'll get a switch at some point , just probably not in the first year . 
  the real must have ** exclusive ** for the system is looking like super mario odyssey, 
  i do n't really care so long as i can get the game on wiiu . 
  i was hoping we would at least get an amiibo bundle though . 
  whole new weapon sets , almost certainly a new story campaign and new maps and game play modes . 
  i 'm not buying a switch at launch , but it looks more of a sequel than most shooter titles . 
  honestly they did improve when it came to the wii u. i had no problems in mario kart 8 or splatoon . 
  i would say the same about smash bros , but i was reported one day for no reason and have been banned from online since . 
  the assumption is that there will be a large userbase on the switch who never played the original . 
  yes , and legally all duties of guardianship are to be decided by the parents . 
  i still do n't see how this is an issue . 
  i would have liked to have gone to the `` alternative '' high school where we got to choose our own curriculum here , but thank god i was n't given the option . 
  you get full control over your life and all responsibilities it entails when you turn 18 . 
  until then , you are someone elses responsibility . 
  this is only because scottish , welsh and english are marked as separate ethnicities , as well as the numbers being reduced by many claiming `` american '' on the census . 
  when they are combined , the largest group of white americans is of british ancestry . 
  the scottish and welsh people are not ethnically distinct , but culturally distinct - the entire british isles is a genetic mixture people from anglo saxon , norman , scandinavian , northern celtic and native brittonic heritage . 
  i 'm not really sure how you can call the irish slaves either . 
  the majority arriving in america came in the 19th century due to the famine and poor economic conditions . 
  only a small number were ever indentured servants . 
  yes , talk to any chinese exchange student and you 'll hear how benevolent the local ccp officials are . 
  student 's often have to bribe their local official just to get the paperwork to study abroad . 
  the end times are upon us , and we are told to listen to the king of babylon !!, 
  i think you may want to read the above comment again . 
  i just never have that much time to waste in the toilet . 
  [ wellington is a city that speaks for me ] ( http://www.wellingtonnz.com/discover/ ), 
  you 're forgetting the most important feature : gamecube and wii backwards compatibility with upscaling ( via ahem , slightly dubious methods ), 
  they have those choices , but you 're ignoring that a second language is not compulsory . 
  student 's can currently choose from another elective instead of a language . 
  i think a compulsory second language is an excellent idea , and it helps bridge cultural understanding - whether at home with the tangata whenua , or overseas with the french , the chinese , the spanish and latin americans etc. 
  i never learned to speak french fluently , but it gave me a greater cultural perspective after three years of taking it in high school . 
  the wii u one was very good , as it just paused the game in the background if you wanted to look up a walkthrough . 
  plus you had a touch screen to navigate it with . 
  valeu , yes i 've heard the traffic in sp is awful . 
  i 'll just drive to the hotel ( with windows locked ) and take the metro . 
  obrigado , this looks great !, 
  i love italian culture , and i 'm sure i 'll be in sc while it 's on . 
  haha , unfortunately i 'll be bypassing es . 
  it 's terrible what 's happening there at the moment . 
  one vlogger i watch occasionally lives in vitoria for half the year . 
  it usually looks so beautiful . 
  thank you all so much for your responses !, 
  you 've been incredibly helpful and i 'm sure all the brazilians i 'll meet when i 'm over will be just as welcoming . 
  the `` come to brazil ' meme is real is n't it :d, 
  thanks especially to the redditor 's who offered to meet up . 
  i 'll definitely be taking some of you up on the offer . 
  i 'll probably have the most free time in rio towards the end of july , so if there are any carioca 's who want to show a kiwi round town , i 'd definitely be up for it . 
  i definitely have igua\u00e7u on my travel list . 
  obrigado anon , this is helpful advice . 
  i know i have to extra vigilant while driving . 
  i was hoping to take my canon dslr along , but i was only going to use it outside of the cities . 
  would you advise just not taking a watch at all ? 
  i was thinking mostly the one 's around floripa and rj . 
  it 's colder the further south you go , but i 'll have a week in rio so hopefully i can fit in a few lazy days at the beach . 
  nah , mario kart 8 is definitely the high water mark when it comes to cart racers . 
  i just uploaded it to imgur . 
  no idea what reddit 's doing tbh, 
  thanks , but no i 'm not . 
  `` high water mark '' is [ defined as the time when something is most successful ] (, 
  https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/high%e2%80%93water%20mark ) . 
  what i meant was that mario kart 8 was the peak of the genre . 
  it would pay to google next time before you correct someone . 
  sony would have far more support from nostalgic older gamers had they not killed their exclusives off . 
  crash bandicoot is finally returning , but surely instead of letting activision buy it in the 2000s , sony could have bidded for the franchise . 
  we would n't have such an awful decade plus long drought since a crash game .
