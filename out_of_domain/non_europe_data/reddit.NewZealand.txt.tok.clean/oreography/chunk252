  man valve is awesome but origin is literally internet superhighway robbery . 
  it was $ 300 to list the house for sale but we 're hoping to get a rental in for a few months , so pay $ 100 for the rental listing and then get back to selling it . 
  it just saves paying the $ 300 fee again . 
  this is a brief mod announcement concerning the latest wonderful image macros for pwning conservitards with . 
  all credit goes to resident photoshop wiz / u/pizzarollexpert . 
  the way to create the macro is in the text above each macro , sans reddits stupid toking [ 5 ] link numbers . 
  you should put text within asterisks to center the quote . 
  there 's a slight problem with the romney quote at the moment as long text does n't seem to wrap around with asterix 's .

  hashtag #windowsphonecan ` tmassagemyneckbeard, 
  uperections to the left, 
  here we are fellow saganites , a faithsmasher on the battlegrounds of worldnews enlightening a filthy muslim savage . 
  bravery starts from [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/14w9br/debate_on_islam_and_evolution_has_to_be_called/c7h4alr ) onwards . 
  good lord , some of the comments in [ this thread ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/14xwr2/china_is_cooling_on_the_iphone_nokia_lumia_920t/ ) are senseless . 
  i 've seen this phenomenon in / r/technology recently since windows 8 and windows phone 8 have been launched recently . 
  i 'm sure we all know microsoft have a checkered past especially their actions in the 90 's that brought about anti trust suits , but the company seems to be bringing some innovative developments to the table . 
  of course this means that if anyone likes their products they must be paid marketers !, 
  now i 'll agree that / u/i _ shit_karma is definitely a microsoft fan . 
  he 's one of the top posters on / r/windowsphone . 
  however the same users can be seen in / r/android or / r/apple . 
  is it not okay that people can be passionate about the products they use , without being paid marketers . 
  well no , not if redditors do n't like the product they like . 
   [ how does this blurb get propped up to top 100 on [ 1 ] / r/all . 
  i swear microsoft is using some of that 2 billion yearly advertising budget on reddit shilling ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/14xwr2/china_is_cooling_on_the_iphone_nokia_lumia_920t/c7hg8p1 ), 
  well it 's just a lone comment right ? 
  there 's always going to be conspiracy nuts, 
   [ oh great . 
  more advertisement from this ms shill . 
  yes we get that . 
  you love lumia and microsoft . 
  now stop spamming . ], 
  ( http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/14xwr2/china_is_cooling_on_the_iphone_nokia_lumia_920t/c7hgy9y ), 
  another one, 
   [ i think we should do something with this viral marketing on reddit . 
  this guys is all over the place pushing windows and trying made apple look bad . 
  were are moderators ? 
  edit : uh i see ms brigades are coming . ], 
  ( http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/14xwr2/china_is_cooling_on_the_iphone_nokia_lumia_920t/c7hh7u5 ), 
  well is n't that edit just precious ? 
  people downvoting ? 
  the shills are doing it . 
  wake up sheeple !!!!!, 
   [ clearly microsoft 's undercover agents have infiltrated [ 1 ] / r/technology . 
  that 's why [ 2 ] / r/technology is always filled with posts about how great ms is , right ? 
  lol what world do you live in ? ], 
  ( http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/14xwr2/china_is_cooling_on_the_iphone_nokia_lumia_920t/c7hj28a ), 
  thankfully this person is getting upvotes for providing a voice of reason . 
  if microsoft really were spamming reddit do you think they would pick a user with a name like ` i_shit_karma ' ? 
  i honestly think it 's far more likely they would make fake users on twitter or facebook where they have far more exposure than on reddit . 
  thankfully most of these comments are being downvoted but it really shows many redditors disconnect from reality . 
  searching [ windows 8 ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/search?q=windows+8&sort=new&restrict_sr=on ) by new posts shows the vast majority being upvoted are negative articles . 
  it 's apparent that for many redditors liking something they do n't like is a cardinal sin and shall either be silenced with downvotes or proclaimed a conspiracy theory . 
  just kidding, 
  ### burn them !, 
  i know we all love to complain about reddit here and what better to complain about than two of the most jerky subs on this site - politics and worldnews . 
  we 're not attacking a liberal political viewpoint as most of our subscribers are liberal . 
  rather we 're the equivalent of magicskyfairy for politics and worldnews . 
  a satirical version of those subs . 
  we 've got some lovely css now and image macros of obama , netanyahu , ron paul ( pbuh ) , romney and johnson , viewable on the sidebar . 
  i know plugging a subreddit is n't what circlebroke is about but it 's another great place to complain for all brokers , so please sub guys . 
  we 'd love more than a hundred and twenty whatever subscribers, 
  / r/magicskyfairy as an atheist i adore science . 
  it has given us everything , from the sweet dorito crumbs i 'm devouring to the stem engineered computer i 'm typing on . 
  however as ~ ~ saint ~ ~ dr hitchens explained `` religion poisons everything . '', 
  we all know science is the most powerful force on earth but yet for too long the fundies have been corrupting it . 
  first of all in amerikkka we have had attempts to teach the farce that is intelligent design and denial of climate change . 
  evolution and global warming are thankfully accepted by the public but there needs to be an outcry about the fundie corruption weaseling its way into scientific terminology . 
  i always assumed the planets : venus , mars , mercury and all the bright and beautiful spheres and their satellites of science were named after the scientists that discovered them . 
  however i was disgusted that they were named after roman gods . 
  people say the roman empire is dead , but its fundie corruption leaves a stain on scientific progress . 
  i am proposing we rename the planets immediately . 
  \u263f mercury = teslarary, 
  \u2295 earth is alright but i propose darwinia instead . 
  \u2643 jupiter = dawkinter, 
  \u2644 saturn = newturn, 
  i 'm well aware that these names are already established but we have a duty as atheists to rid the world of religious influence . 
  when the legacy of primitive roman deities is alive within the names of our planets , when we teach children to learn these names we are corrupting them with fundie lies !!, 
  it saddens me that the scientific community has n't recognized the plight of the planets but we can do it reddit . 
  we can make the change . 
  we must rally our brothers in / r/atheism to this scientific calling and rid science of this reliegious corruption . 
  hi there / r/web _ design, 
  i 'm aware that . net domains just do n't get the same amount of hits but i ', 
  i 'm hoping to have a big site created within the next two years . 
  i have the perfect domain name but it 's already been taken . 
  the owner has listed it on godaddy auctions ( i know , godaddy bad . 
  i would n't host with them . ), 
  with bids starting at $ 60 . 
  there 's no buy now and i ca n't even make contact with the seller . 
  i submitted a bid of $ 280 but i ca n't go much higher . 
  it 's becoming obvious to me that a relevant two syllable . com domain is going to cost several thousand dollars , which i just ca n't afford .
