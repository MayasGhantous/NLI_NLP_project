  i 'd love to find a good controller that works with emulators and games on my galaxy note gen 1 international . 
  i have a ps3 controller and otg cable but it just does n't work without root due to samsungs weird usb/bluetooth settings using the sixaxis app , which is frustrating as htc , nexus devices etc they seem to work fine on . 
  i think i need a bluetooth one in order for it to work and have it easily mappable on emulators . 
  has anyone else got a non rooted s2/note/s3 and found a good gamepad that works ?

  i 'd love to have this in my steam library but as only multiplayer games which charge for dlc are in the free game section , you need to put a price on single player games . 
  it would also help the makers of the game and gain more awareness for it . 
  do you think this would be possible ? 
  hush , do n't let this romance end too soon . 
  let 's first play coy . 
  i will engage in conversation with you , keeping the topic about you so you feel that i 'm really interested in who you are . 
  you will feel strangely comfortable around me . 
  i will give an air of confidence in my posture and body language ; making direct eye contact , standing straight and occasionally brushing my hand against you . 
  soon you will undeniably attracted to my body . 
  we will then dine at the finest of chain restaurants . 
  naturally this meal is on me . 
  after a drink or two i will drive you to my house for a night cap . 
  stumbling , laughing we try to make it down to my basement . 
  shh , my mother needs her sleep . 
  finally we will make it down to my room and show you the lay of the land . 
  for one day , all of this can be yours too . 
  i awake my custom built computer that i assembled myself from it 's momentary slumber and remark at how linux is the only real operating system to exist . 
  i then queue my `` sexy mix # 2 '' to begin playing as i turn down the lights and turn on my lava lamp collection . 
  clearly by now you can hardly contain yourself and need what only what my body can give you . 
  i brush away the empty mountain dew cans and crumpled fritos bags to clear off my bed , for it is here you will go where you never thought you would ever go before . 
  i lay you down gently and then strip down to my fedora and socks . 
  now is the time , my love . 
  now is our time .

  i googled this briefly and it seemed quite a few people had this issue . 
  i tried checking and unchecking the different boxes but i still ca n't find any servers . 
  my router nat settings are open if that could be the problem , but i do n't know why i 'm not finding any games ? 
  why is this not bigger news ??? 
  upvotes to the left . 
  i heard that there 's a nasty strain coming over from the states , and that it really pays to get one this winter . 
  as a 20 year old who got all the jabs in school i do n't know if i need it or not ? 
  your thoughts on it all / r/newzealand, 
  i mean there was this girl of a friend that i met once and she totally looked me in the eye when talking to me . 
  it was n't just that obvious sign she wanted to fuck , she even addressed me by my real name !, 
  how do i get her in bed now since she obviously showed an interest in me ( my penis ) ? 
  i 'm a web des beginner but this is ticking all the bad usability boxes . 
  i came to the new design from a bookmark where the hyperlinks in it redirected me to the new design page , and not the pages i wanted . 
  the first post on the page is a sponsored post . 
  i do n't know if this is just a one off or regular thing but it 's not a good look to have sponsored posts as the first article people see . 
  it seems pretty obvious they designed the site to be mobile/tablet friendly with the clean fixed layout but they seem to be hampering desktop useability to acheive the goal . 
  you need to click on a search icon which then opens a text box to type in . 
  adding an unnecessary step presumably again to make it more mobile friendly . 
  i 've put a screencap of part of the site with the improperly redirected url visible at the top and another of the full front page, 
  any more experienced designers want to give some criticism ? 
  oh look nothing, 
  i 'm in nz and got it this morning . 
  the phone feels so much better . 
  when i first got it the phone was on gingerbread but a few months later was upgraded to ics , which definitely made improvements . 
  now though , the phone feels comparable to my mums note 2 . 
  here 's a few things i 've noticed improved, 
  - camera quality has definitely improved . 
  camera settings are same as note 2 now , with more options and better software . 
  - improved gesture support ( not that i really use it ), 
  - the overall update to touchwiz is so much better . 
  the notification center has been improved and the apps/widget selecter feels much more smoother . 
  also multiwindow support is now added . 
  apps and transitions just feel much smoother and faster, 
  - the s pen is so much better . 
  it 's incredibly fluid now . 
  when the phone was on gingerbread it lagged so much . 
  the ics update definitely helped but now the pen strokes are instant . 
  they added s note which is better software as well . 
  for all you that ca n't justify getting the note 2 due to its high price but still want a phablet i have to say the og note is now almost as good . 
  it 's really amazing how great they made jellybean on the older hardware , the phone is now as it should have been released 2 years ago .

  ** mobile , united states **, 
  echoing history carried out in the area 150 years ago , a undercover slave trade has been discovered in an alabama church property . 
  the `` st adolf baptist church '' owned a farm property where the forced labour was carried out over a period of two years until discovered . 
  nicholas brutsch , an atheist activist on the reddit.com atheism forum was the first to discover the practice . 
  `` i was driving past the farm on the way to my larp ( live action role playing ) meetup . 
  i could see a man in a clerical outfit that was dragging a lady tied up with duct tape . 
  i thought at first he ( the pastor ) was raping her but i phoned the cops . 
  they arrived at the scene and discovered the chicken house where the other slaves were held . 
  as the guy ( the victim ) thanked me the police officer whistled and cheered and i drove off with a feeling of accomplishment . '', 
  residents near the church claimed they heard screams and gunshots , but assumed the farmers were killing livestock . 
  other residents had nothing to say other than `` arghhhgarble jaysus hurghhh bible arghhsuhughu '', 
  sam wilson of the american humanist association was `` devastated '' when reports of the trade happened to be true . 
  `` you know , i 'm shocked but i 'm not that surprised .
