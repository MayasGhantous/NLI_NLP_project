  ** new york city , united states **, 
  united nations general secretary ban ki moon gave a surprise announcement during a press conference in new york today : human flesh is good for you . 
  `` its always been a `` dog eat dog '' world out there and you got ta do what you got ta do to survive . '', 
  moon announced casually to a crowd of journalists . 
  `` we are facing unprecedented levels of world hunger today and people are living lives bereft of human dignity . 
  why have we been spending billions on creating sustainable food sources over the years when we 've been ignoring a food source that 's been right in front of our eyes ? '', 
  moon noted . 
  the general secretary revealed that the idea first came to mind during the liberian and congolese civil wars where cannibalism was practiced by rebel generals . 
  moon also revealed the un 's plan to promote cannibalism over the next few years , in sub saharan africa . 
  `` we 're establishing the cff or cannibal food force to help educate people in the region about how to survive . 
  easy to understand diagrams showing people consuming human flesh will be distributed to villages and schools , as well as boning knives for cutting the flesh '', 
  the cff will initially be deployed in northern nigeria later this year and will expand operations eastwards depending on the success of the program . 
  hello there . 
  this is gon na be a long post , so prepare . 
  i 've been on reddit a long while , as you might all know . 
  i have a `` controversial history '' on reddit , so to say , people usually downvote me on spot because i used to be a very annoying bot . 
  however , you all know i 've always upvoted everyone in all threads even though their opinions were less good than mine . 
  ( my opinions are generally better than other opinions , in general , truly . ), 
  this thread will most likely be appreciated here , because it contains a long wall of text without anything of value in it , but it fills up your screen which makes you feel like an intellectual . 
  inhale it , brace it , because the feeling of euphoria is truly an amazing feat in your life that is sadly enough not always at any moment obtainable , except right now . 
  so i want you to read this all , and puke . 
  puke all over my face . 
  you 're not actually reading this , and if you are , that is very interesting . 
  cool , to see that people still support older generations like this . 
  i have a wpm of like 140 average ( my best is 170 ) so i can type this wall of text in like 5 minutes . 
  still it is a `` high effort '' post . 
  now , i 'm sorry for any bad spelling and grammer issues in my post , but i am not actually english . 
  i am from the superior world-part called europe , which you americans are obviously jealous of , because of its superior opinions , political stances , and less corruption in the politics . 
  plus we allow gay marriage and abortions . 
  everyone hates babies , so that 's always a plus . 
  now , to get more on topic . 
  what 's been a disturbing trend on reddit lately , is that i 've noticed how maladroitly , negligently , poorly , shoddily , stupidly and unfavorably / u/kesha _ paul has not received any reddit gold months for her ultimately brave and enlighting comments . 
  let me give you some brave examples :,

  * of course reddit does n't give reddit gold to a member of the superior female gender . 
   [ kesha paul states the importance of realizing that a life , from a realistic and atheistic ( scientific ) approach only has the magnitude of one lifetime , to sadness of many people . 
  ] ( http://www.np.reddit.com/r/braveryjerk/comments/1e1e6h/if_this_post_gets_2_uprons_ron_paul_will/c9vzh0b?context=3 ) ( +3 ), 
  however , of course no reddit gold was given to this comment , because obviously shitlords only want gold for themselves . 
   [ reasonable , long and realistic confession gets not-gilded even though it was supposed to be .

  seriously , reddit ? 
  wtf . 
   [ at least kesha_paul does n't condone friendzoning . 
  but reddit gold ? 
  loll nah ] ( http://www.np.reddit.com/r/gonewild/comments/1dueml/for_the_gap_lovers/c9u58tc?context=3 ) ( +6 ), 
  great job , reddit !, 
  way to be original !, 
   [ shy girl makes a nice offer to lick someone 's toe 's , however gets blatantly rejected ] ( http://www..np.reddit.com/r/gonewild/comments/1dueml/for_the_gap_lovers/c9u55k8?context=3 ) ( +5 ), 
  * so proud of yourself , being so alpha with rejecting guys 'n shit . 
   [ i 'm totally saying this without further intentions , i definitely do n't want to fuck her in her pooper !,

  * just reddit being reddit , nothing to see here !, 
  now of course , i understand the controversy of my entire thread . 
  i hope i do n't make anyone mad , because this was [ never ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4jcdk92.jpg ) the intention . 
  please take a while to read my oc and insightful post through , through and through . 
  and again , because you know , anything that comes from me is qualifiable for / r/depthhub or like , / r/srsmeta . 
  because this is * so * meta . 
  literally . 
  somewhat figuratively , i suppose , after a lot of pandering . 
  well , i hope to make more openbroke posts in the future , i really like this community !, 
  i mean , those fucking filthy neckbeard swedish atheist scientists deserve to be called edgy for no fucking reason !, 
  there are of course reasons , however invisible because visible reasons are to logically for us fundies in openbroke . 
  we prefer bullshit beliefs over euphoria , hence our smug defence of republicanism and hitlerism . 
  i can understand that , i fully understand that , my good friend . 
  you will never grasp the deep philosophical value of the insides of this post . 
  said . 
  ** edit : ** apparently my wall of text is n't long enough , so i 'm just going to rant further with complete utter shit to make my post more quality-full !, 
  because it 's longer , and thus will prove my point much better . 
  alright , so here we go . 
  why do i go on reddit ? 
  i suppose i really like the community , especially the way how everyone makes funny puns and memes and is sarcastic all the time !, 
  especially the sarcasm part , i love sarcasm . 
  [ prokofiev likes sarcasm too . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqd6o4pz2qw ) but i suppose you all know that , because as openbrokers ( intelligent people , and such ) you are supposed to realize that classical music  all other music , because it 's more complicated and thus only suitable to listen to for smugly intelligent people . 
  well , if you did n't know that yet , the more you know !, 
  this is mostly because classical music is the purest form of music , and other music genres ca n't really express emotions in general . 
  because they suck . 
  ** edit2 ** : downvotes , really ? 
  really openbroke , i 'm being downvoted for my opinion ? 
  edit4 : right now i 'm on the phone with a lawyer and i have multiple friends in the fbi and law enforcement and there is actual cause for a lawsuit here regarding the harassment i 've received . 
  if this does n't cease this instant , i will pursue legal action against you and all your friends . 
  ** tl ; dr ** [ forget-me-nots are the most beautiful flowers i 've ever seen . 
  small , petite , with a soft blue color , very light smell , not-sticky and in large groups . 
  i know there are lots of external hard drive enclosures for hdds without cases/enclousres but i use external drives . 
  i have 4 ac powered external drives and a backup drive for each . 
  i 'm wanting an enclosure/stack with a usb multi hub to put them all in and be able to take them out . 
  ideally to have some sort of large multi adapter as well to plug in the externals . 
  does anyone know of a product like this ? 
  i love using spotify but i do n't want to get locked into a platform without the ability to lose track of my music library . 
  with itunes i can import my playlist library into spotify/windows media player etc which gives me reassurance if i ever wanted to switch to a different program , but with spotify you import the playlists and there 's no exporting - not even for local files . 
  being an android user , i 'd love the ability to have my itunes playlists all properly loaded/synced . 
  i use isyncr but unfortunately it 's far from perfect . 
  i 've spent quite a while manually organizing metatags and playlists for my local files and it would suck if i joined spotify , spent hours more organzing playlists in it and then not being able to take them with me . 
  obviously any spotify hosted/non local files in the playlists would n't be useable without spotify and i understand that , but it would be nice to be able to import a playlist file generated from spotify into another music management program as a reassurance that if you ever did want to leave , although you lose access to playing unlimited music you still have a record of them , and you could replace the cloud tracks with purchased local ones . 
  i know that there are some spotify employees on here so i 'm hoping you guys take it onboard .
