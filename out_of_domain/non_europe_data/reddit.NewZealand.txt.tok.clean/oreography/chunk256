  i read an article recently about a man unsubscribing from the service for the same reason , he did n't want to feel `` trapped '' in using the service . 
  we at / r/gamingcirclejerk hold more power than we can possibly believe . 
  do n't let the corporations and their `` market research '' and `` economists '' get you down , the whole console 's going to fail , just trust me . 
  this subreddit is the saddest thing i 've ever seen . 
  i post this as someone who was banned from trp , but you guys are so `` beta '' it makes me physically ill . 
  if i just started banging your girlfriends right now , would you even try to stop me ? 
  i mean , no wonder women walk all you guys .

  ** nowhere - somewhere **, 
  in a shocktastic disovery , leaks from the internal media team of / r/gotthescoop reveal that there was absolutely no news in the past week . 
  `` yes it 's true that supposed `` news '' stories were published on major outlets but it 's really all a lie . 
  we make money from selling news and what else were we to do when there was n't any ? '', 
  - a source going by `` lunaraccordian '' revealed, 
  another reporter going by `` thor_bad '' came forward out of `` conscience '' but declined to use his real name , out of fear of losing his job . 
  `` people would panic . 
  there would be tears in their morning cornflakes . 
  i just do n't how we can break the news that there is no news other than saying we are all deeply sorry and still are n't even aware how nothing happened on the planet the past week . '', 
  another source using the pseudonym `` pastabakenovice '' recounted the history of the past week `` usually members of the press team will arrive monday with 10-20 emails each covering possible scoops , but there was no mail . 
  we phoned all our reporters covering the major subreddits and our worldwide network of keyboard detectives , all of whom gave us nothing . '', 
  pastabake paused for dramatic effect and a line break, 
  `` we were even contemplating going outside to get a story , but we were quickly dragged back down to the depressing reality of our collective social prison cells we locked ourselves into , years ago when someone laughed at us '' . 
  pastabake had clearly been suffering from severe sleep deprivation when he pleaded `` i shat out some depressing poetry , you want to masturbate and put a picture of carl sagan on it ? '', 
  it was clearly time for us to leave, 
  thankfully for the news staff and the world , all signs point to news returning . 
  `` yes it 's true , the week of no news is ending . 
  i just got a tweet saying there 's a kitten in hong kong that pees in the pattern of a love heart , and there 's a hobo in san francisco whose monkey calls are within 99 % accuracy of a female mating cry . '', 
  reporter `` queenmovement '' told us . 
  stay tuned for further updates . 
  i recently bought a backwards compatible ps3 because i wanted to play older ps2 + ps1 titles , including rpgs and games not on psn . 
  the first one i bought secondhand was in crappy condition and i lost money on it , but now i have a good condition refurbished original 60 gig model . 
  i would have bought a new ps3 if they retained backwards compatibility . 
  i understand why they removed it , they were losing money and the install base was n't growing because of the high console price , but now that the ps3 is firmly established would you be interested in sony releasing a more expensive model with backwards compatibility again ? 
  one of my favourite bible translations is the net ( new english translation ) bible . 
  the bible is free to read at net.bible.org however if you want an easier to read copy for your ereader then this is good to have . 
  2/3rds of this bible is footnotes , every verse is annotated and has translation notes about the original greek/hebrew . 
  it 's a fantastic academic resource . 
  i ca n't actually remember where i found the annotated epub version of the net bible but i believe it was on a net bible related forum . 
  i am almost certainly sure this is copyright free as the digital text is currently hosted for free on the site , and i believe it was someone from the net bible team that posted the link . 
  i have also converted a copy of the epub to mobi format which works flawlessly in your kindle . 
  link to the mobi ( kindle ) file https://mega.co.nz/#!euahrq6j!jlctqnjmt38tlbk4jdgpyhbrpfp4mxa3fim9jpnrqti,

  whenever i cook anything with a coating / . 
  in particular fried potatoes , breadcrumb coated fish and anything i want crispy i find the `` crisp '' will stick to the bottom of the frypan . 
  i turn the heat down to medium once i begin getting a decent surface on the food , and stir it regularly but any oil always sticks to the bottom . 
  have any of you got a solution ? 
  i would support computer based parenting . 
  something like the creation of large facilities that could house many hundreds of child raising rooms . 
  all education and raising would be done with a central super computer that would monitor each child very closely . 
  it could be a very efficent system that normalises every childhood to the same baseline providing truly equal oppurtunity .

  no moderation without memefication . 
  it is time to declare independence from king jij :, 
  we hold these truths to be self-evident , that all scientists are created logical , that they are endowed by their creator own intelligence with certain unalienable rights , that among these are memes , facebook screenshots and the pursuit of euphoria .

  [ 1 ] / r/magicskyfairy 4 months ago was a gem . 
  it was seriously a place where any and everything could go . 
  if you were someone who was coming to terms with the fact that you were a non-believer or struggling with keeping your faith , [ 2 ] / r/magicskyfairy was a place where no one held any punches . 
  its a place where no one respected religion . 
  people were n't scared of what others thought and they were confident in their claims . 
  they did n't tap dance around making fun of silly ideas and they did n't hesitate to offend religion . 
  thats what made [ 3 ] / r/magicskyfairy great . 
  not giving a fuck . 
  you are indirectly supporting and legitimizing religion by implementing these rules . 
  [ 4 ] / r/magicskyfairy is a release valve for so many of us who do n't get to talk about this stuff with others . 
  there is n't a place like this to really put forth these ideas and have them be taken seriously . 
  this is one of the few , true , body of one 's peers . 
  [ 5 ] / r/magicskyfairy should stay the way it was . 
  liking 1-click memes does not make one a 16 year old . 
  preferring heavy text-based discussions does not automatically mean you are more intelligent than others . 
  stop trying to enforce your ontology ( is that right ? 
  my thesaurus said it was ) on others !, 
  that is exactly what religious nuts having been doing to us for centuries . 
  we 've had enough . 
  please return the subreddit to its previous state and stop assuming you are speaking for us `` older intellectuals '' . 
  edit : i 'm not stating my age , honour from the queen , my career as an astronaut , fitness level or academic credentials to impress anyone with how authoritative my arguments should be seen as . 
  i 'm stating it to demonstrate that educated people older than 16 can also dislike the changes . 
  super non pretentious edit : if anything this post has shown me that `` karma whoring '' would be just as easy using text as using maymays ( in your face !!! ), 
  it has also shown that the internet is definitely like a school playground where most people believe that any argument can be won by shouting `` no you 're not ! '', 
  and stamping your feet ( but definitely not what my argument does ) if you paid attention you would have seen that i capitalized the word also in my post title . 
  i was not trying to `` argue from astronautomy '' i was trying to present a counterpoint to the popular assumption that people in my demographic would by default prefer the new moderation policy . 
  after reading all the `` meaningful '' attacks posted as comments here i 'm starting to believe that it might actually be better to not have new redditors easily discover this subreddit . 
  this much hubris would probably scare them right back to church . 
  in short fuck you jijler and tuberculosis . 
  final edit : many of the comments attacked me for stating my age and education in the post title . 
  ask yourself this : if i used `` i 'm oreography and i also want the old rules for / atheism back '' as the title , how many views would i have gotten ? 
  your response ( even the negative ones ) to my post made it worth my while . 
  so criticize all you want . 
  at least my view has been heard loud and clear . 
  we 're going to moving house shortly and are considering changing isps . 
  slingshot has done a great job being the first to give us uncapped internet but it 's pretty expensive compared to what orcon and flip are offering . 
  has anyone switched to orcon or flip 's unlimited service , how do you find whatever isp you 're on for service/throttling . 
  recipe is simple, 
  toast your wheat bread then spread thickly with hummus and smallish amount of sweet chilli sauce . 
  chop a small tomato into small slices and layer it on the bread , then add 3 slices of shaved ham . 
  i was making a similar thing with mayonnaise instead of hummus ( while keeping the chilli ) but this is healthier and fresher . 
  1 upvote = 1 microsoft employee getting fired !, 
  i used to really like mayonnaise and sweet chilli , but now i lean towards hummus .
