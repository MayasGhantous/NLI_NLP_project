  confirmed, 
  the mods have been provided proof that the fascist subscribers of / r/kkkonservative have infiltrated this board by our alt subscriber there .

  thank you all for your continued support . 
  it feels pretty good to get attention , i think . 
  though you can get it in a bad way :( like the time i took a sat test in the 7th grade . 
  i debunked all of freuds theories and all i got was this lousy copypasta . 
  underground gamer was the best place for retro games . 
  i did n't use it much but was planning on getting some ps1 and ps2 games . 
  anyone know of a good tracker for it ? 
  i keep getting conflicting advice about this . 
  i 'm told that setting the height + width of an image in html is redundant and yet almost every tuitorial i look at , it 's permitted . 
  also in the w3 img spec it 's permitted, 
  it 's definitely easier setting it inline but it seems like bad practice . 
  however if i 'm not doing anything else to an image and it 's not part of another class it 's a pain to put them all in individual css classes to style each one . 
  html, 
  do you still set styling in html for the img elements or do you always put them in a class/id ?

  tame impala is hands down the best band in the world right now . 
  they are not pretty good , they are pretty incredible . 
  but more than just how good they are , they represent the first ripple in a massive change that we are about to go through musically as well as culturally . 
  i think that over the course of the next 10 years we are going to see a sort of mini-renaissance similar to what we saw in the late 50s-60s post war . 
  with pot and gay marriage soon to be legal federally its gon na be a whole new world . 
  2012 end of the world is n't the end of human life , its the end of one way of thinking and the start of another . 
  pot ... cash ... crop ... money !, 
  as someone already said here on reddit , the united states will be the only country in the world were pot is legal federally . 
  we are gon na have jobs again , and money to burn . 
  money to spend on art and music . 
  in a sense , a need will be created for good art and music . 
  not something that is coldy manufactured by hitmakers . 
  tame impala is leading the charge !, 
  they are proving that people can tell the difference between real and manufactured music !, 
  im not saying tame impala are the next beatles but they are making enough waves to make change . 
  moral of story , tame impala rocks !!!!, 
  they ( kevin park ) are making real beautiful music that only happens when a talented person commits a lot of time to something that they are passonate about . 
  tame impala is a real life `` bedroom '' band , they way it is meant to be .

  overtaking and threatening book sales for twilight , i offered a quick prayer on behalf of edward cullens safety from new york times bestseller persecution . 
  it surprised me that i had n't done that before , so i felt like sharing the thought . 
  ( amongst , admittedly , many other `` worthy '' topics of prayer in our world ! ) .

  i 'm light on details at the moment , but a week ago he was photographing a protest outside the vatican when the swiss guards came in . 
  they rounded up everyone who protested and tried to break his camera . 
  when he refused they took him in for questioning , and when he disobeyed their religious mind control tactics they started getting angry . 
  according to my source in rome his last words were `` i 'm not going to let this go unreported '' . 
  they asked him `` how ? '' '' . 
  he responded `` strong , then post . '', 
  he had hidden his phone and recorded the entire incident , posting it into our modmail online , and there was nothing they could do about it . 
  it emerged a few days later that they had murdered him and dumped his body in the tiber . 
  let us remember a courageous user , one who reported the scourge of religious tyranny wherever it was found . 
  i 'm so glad that jij changed the sub for the better , but aside from rebooted there 's hardly anything to mock .

  once upon a time there was a sonner , who was very sonful . 
  he believed that looking at the original language and `` historical context '' . 
  moi , was very righteous . 
  he was exceptionally good looking , honest and right . 
  anyways one day the sonner and moi had a conversation in the parking lot, 
  `` i 've been having a lot of struggles with my faith '' said the sonner , `` but i know i 'll come out better shaped by the issues i 'm going through '', 
  moi , who long suspected the sonner was sonful , replied `` if you would just read the new annotated righteous first church bible , perhaps this would n't be happening '' . 
  as moi got into his car , a lamborghini murcielago came roaring round the parking lot and crashed into the sonner killing him instantly . 
  `` better get rid of that car as evidence '' moi said as he grabbed the car keys . 
  the real person driver man agreed wholeheartedly . 
  the lord later showed moi the sinner crying out in hell . 
  ** to sum it all up .
