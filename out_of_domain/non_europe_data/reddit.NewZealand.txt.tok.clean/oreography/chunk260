  dear r/magicskyfairy ,, 
  america has gotten pretty messed up this last decade or so . 
  i 'm starting to plan my move to sweden . 
  here are some facts about that country :, 
  the swedish parliament is composed of 47 % women . 
  only 14 % of swedes consider religion to be an important aspect of their lives, 
  only 23 % of swedes believe in god ( even though 70 % are `` members '' of the swedish church haha ), 
  sweden is an extremely peaceful country, 
  sweden is an extremely environmentalist country, 
  politicalcompass.org places sweden nearest the center of its socio-economic grid, 
  i 've researched the prospect of moving to another country for years and the nordic countries in particular have always come up as perhaps the best fit for me , sweden in particular . 
  now with an iq of 138 and at the age of 18 i should be able to secure an associates degree here in america ( specifically seattle , wa ) and then hopefully work on my master 's degree in sweden via an eu `` erasmus mundus '' scholarship so that i may become a resident of sweden within the next four years , and a citizen by around age 27 given that i 'm able to find a job in my profession . 
  i understand i 'll be leaving behind family and friends , but i simply am fed up with the degradation of the united states of america and have found that the benefits of migrating outweigh the costs . 
  i 'm hoping to get out before it 's too late ; too late to make the money necessary , too late to emigrate . 
  do any atheists here have any suggestions for me or criticisms and/or thoughts pertaining to the very notion of my personal plans and intentions ?

  i have n't been spending much time on msf since [ may may june ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/magicskyfairy/comments/1fqepc/the_neutering_of_ratheism_or_how_the_christians/_ ) but i think we should probably open this sub up to the public . 
  maybe put it in the msf sidebar , as a meta discussion place ? 
  this is the beauty of reddit . 
  if fascism on a massive scale is occuring we can go somewhere else .

  i 've been pming my classmates the link here , becuase i want this place to grow and prove that censorship ( fffuuuuu douglas ) does n't pay ;( . 
  it 's fucking bullshit they say rt is a `` kremlin mouth piece '' . 
  we can prove otherwise here , by becomming the next big place for news !, 
  who 's with me ? 
  i 'll be going to hong kong for a week in january , and am planning on spending at least a day in macau . 
  however i 'm informed , like hong kong it 's mostly english and cantonese spoken . 
  does anyone here speak portugese . 
  do you know many people that do ?

  ( no hard questions please , i 'm currently in a bomb shelter as i type this ), 
  `` if anything what it comes down to is some people have morals and values ( conservatives ) and some people do not have morals nor values ( liberals ), 
  think about it , liberals want to legalize homosexual marriage ( an abomination ) and legal murder ( abortion ) and want a handout from the government for not doing any work ( welfare , occupy wallstreet ), 
  conservatives want to protect children from abortion , preserve marriage ( an amazingly positive and family oriented religious institution ) and end entitlement programs that reward people for not working ... 
  its very cut and dry i do n't see how anyone can call that bigoted ... '', 
  [ old but still very adaptable pasta ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/qlqji/can_we_stop_using_the_term_social_conservatism/c3ymoso ) also the thread title is pretty pasta worthy too, 
  bit more context , i got this from [ this ] ( www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/rrf2t/what_happened_to_reddiquette_did_it_die/c483z5n ) thread where the user was being called out . 
  i know this is pretty low effort , but i do n't know where else to post it . 
  also the entire thread is a trainwreck . 
  hello fellow oppressed meta users . 
  it 's time to re reintroduce yourselves . 
  this is different from introducing yourself , or reintroducing yourself because there 's an extra re , so you do it again .

  upstations to the play, 
  i take my coffee straight , but it 's not working . 
  i have about 5 thermos flasks a day on average . 
  constant need to pee is a release , but i still feel tiredness . 
  i read a tip i should pour scalding coffee into my eyeballs , and the pain will provide enough of a release that i 'll continue staying awake , but i heard it can cause blindness . 
  is this true ?? 
  i just do n't know if i can keep doing this . 
  it feels like torture . 
  i know it 's going to make me better but at the same time , it feels so good to relapse . 
  my parents have started turning the lights off trying to get me to relapse as well , and trying to move the couch into my room ( i set fire to my bed two months ago ) . 
  i try to explain to them it 's an addiction and what the government want us all to do . 
  seeing my parents cry and plead that i sleep hurt the first time , but i discarded my emotions when i realized they did n't help my nonap goals . 
  i do n't want them to feel bad though . 
  i 'm just grasping at straws here . 
  somebody please help before i relapse !!, 
  edit : upvotes really ? 
  this is why i love reddit !!, 
  if you 're not aware , they removed memes from the sub a few months ago . 
  they were the most popular posts on the board , now thanks to / u/jij and the new mods memes do n't stand a chance . 
  there was a big outrage at the time , but i 'm not going to let them forget what they did to memes . 
  we need to make sure subscribers here do n't visit the board or cringepics or any of the other memeaphobic subs in protest .
