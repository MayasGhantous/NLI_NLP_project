  we can do it reddit !, 
  i had a canon printer which had fantastic software , but i ca n't get it working with my current brother printer . 
  it uses `` control center '' which means i have to manually crop each photo . 
  ideally software that works on a wide range of devices . 
  i ca n't get windows fax and scan automatically cropping photos either . 
  when i go into scan settings the `` preview or scan images as seperate files '' is n't selectable .

  rape is kind of like hitler . 
  society drills into us how bad rape is to the point where it becomes the epitome of evil . 
  hitler was bad , but because of our socialization , people act like he was the first , only , or last ethnic cleanser . 
  he was n't , and he was n't the worst . 
  rape is bad , but murder is worse . 
  so is the single greatest tool of human greed , oppression , and violence to date - religion . 
  a controversial opinion these days i suppose , in the sense that it is n't fueled by emotion .

  `` for me , the whole monopoly thing is kind of akin to `` preferring '' your steak well done . 
  on one hand , everyone is entitled to their opinion . 
  on the other hand , monopoly and well done steaks suck , and the vast majority of people who `` prefer '' them have never actually tried a great designer board game or medium rare steak , and their preference is almost always just a matter of not knowing any better . 
  another good analogy is fashion . 
  pleated pants look bad . 
  sure , you are entitled to your opinion that 4 pleats on your ill-fitting khakis looks good , but that does n't change the fact that you 're wrong . '',

  this is an unintelligible rant about how to use windows server properly and how open source software is awful . 
  i agree whit kevin ,, 
  i was asking my self `` would be so great , to be able to run apps on my session , that can access some resources ( read : files ) but only them , i mean launched by me , whit my sess-id ... but that i were able to grant/deny resources to sess-id : app | pid | whatever ... 
  but i guess , gpc is not the answer to that ... i suppose , developing antivirus and being an *** as kevin mentioned above . . is a big bissness ... 
  ` encriptation solutions ' ( as if it were 1945 all over again !!! ), 
  are not the answer ... is stupid to relay in data protection using fs encriptation , as mentioned above , unless you are going to get a hd from a junkjard or stole the machine phisicly ... then ... you have all unencripted data ... i guess you got the point ... 
  if you want a tip : learn to configure your firewall , dont use your system while drunk/asleep/etc . 
  dont watch xx and dont seek for ` free ' solutions ... as all they are *** ... the only stuff free in this world is the air ... and some thimes even it smells ... 
  but . . well ... at least am not the only one who thinks moving to ` free open source ' ( read : unmanagged , made by community , hustleland , and so on ) is stupid ... 
  if you want drink watter , you dont seek it in a public toilet ... i know there is free ... and maybe clean . . but ... 
  open source , is as mentioned by kevin , for learning ... most of the time , bad codding practices , bad logic , bad performance , and in the worst scenarios to get some krapware ... 
  real coders seek for the functions if lassy , or make them by their own ... but open source . . many times , is like having 100 monkeys and just wait them for being able into reaching the outer space ... 
  thats my oppinion ... 
  in `` open source '' codes ... i can mention : apache ... and some others , but ... they are not ` community mannaged projects ` they are proffecional made software , that is open to suggestions , throught a very well made list of pre-requisites to get into it ... unlike many krap out there ... 
  but i guess am looking at the future ... maybe like some time i ear : `` the wars in the future will have rocks and sticks as primary weapons '', 
  inteligence ... is almost ... extint . 
  have a nice day  '',

  there are two that spring to mind for me . 
  ** whisper of the heart ** - a studio ghibli film with less fantasy elements and set in contemporary japan . 
  it 's a really nice coming of age love story . 
  it was directed by a lesser known director there but hayao miyazaki helped produce it . 
  it 's probably my second favourite ghibli film after spirited away . 
  ** the hudsucker proxy ** - a coen brothers fantasy comedy about a man appointed to the head of a failing company on purpose to lower the share prices who invents the hula hoop . 
  a really fun film and seems to be one of the lesser known coen brothers films . 
  this is my sad and lonely confession bear . 
  on askreddit , movies , gaming , iama , and even advice animals people are criticizing memes . 
  every time i point out how gg memes are , i get downvoted and told i have a neckbeard or a fedora . 
  i may have decent chin hair but that does n't define me , if anything memes define me . 
  this is why it 's so hard seeing the anti meme agenda at work . 
  with every downvote it 's like they 're downvoting me . 
  why do you scumbag anti-memers hate them so much !, 
  memes have taught me how to be a better person , and i know i 'm not the only one . 
  / r/antimemewatch is like the only place on the site that values memes for what they really are : witty tracks of knowledge or great advice that help like minded users be awesome . 
  why do people hate that , i just ca n't understand the hatred :( . 
  please tell me i 'm not alone here , i just ca n't stand it !, 
  i wrote this up because someone in / r/worldnews was showing a chart highlighting the growth of irreligion , that did n't seem very accurate . 
  he did n't provide a link to the figures either , just a picture . 
  the us census bureau site has some figures here , taken from the american religious identification survey . 
  it 's interesting that the government does n't poll officially .
