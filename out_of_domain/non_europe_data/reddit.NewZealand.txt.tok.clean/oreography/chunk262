  in new zealand , australia and the uk there are always questions on it . 
  taken from a sample size of 228,182 ( in 2008 ) . 
  between 1990 and 2001 , based on estimates and sample size those with no religion grew from 14,331 to 29,481 , a massive increase . 
  2001 - 2008 was not as impressive going from 29,481 to 34,169 . 
  between 1990 and 2001 and the growth of american christians was minor , going from 151,225 to 159,514 . 
  however per capita it appears to be growing faster from 2001 to 2008 from 159,514 to 173,402 people . 
  in the 90s it appeared irreligiosity was growing rapidly , however now according to these figures the pace is comparable the growth of christianity . 
  the figures on other religions are interesting to read as well . 
  they 're giving you the capability to create raw files and yet not providing sd . 
  i 'm thinking of switching next year from a original galaxy note : 6 inches for the 1520 looks a bit too big . 
  the main phones i 'm looking at are the next 1020 ( for the camera ) and the xperia z1 . 
  i heard that nokia said it would be `` tainted '' or something putting one in , yet the 1520 and lower end models get them . 
  i use my phone for everything , and have at least 30 gigs of music on there so a sd card is n't optional for me . 
  edit : stop buying bitcoin ? 
  wtf ? 
  i thought this was the currency of the future ^ tm, 
  bear in mind that i 'm pretty knew to this quote making thing , but i think i 've got a gem on my hands .

  if there 's anything wrong with this please tell me . 
  i 've been reading a lot of wikipedia recently and coming to terms with my anti-theism , so i 'd really appreciate some feedback . 
  thanks guys , you 're the best :d, 
  blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah, 
  i have just typed / copypasted 3 rambling , barely coherent paragraphs of unsourced nonsense about prehistory / iq and race / hitler being a nice guy / the friendzone / bitcoin economics / law / other field in which i have zero formal training . 
  if you would like to disagree with me , i 'm going to insist that you spend your entire afternoon researching and drafting an impeccably-sourced essay of no less than 2000 words . 
  if there is a single typo or grammatical error anywhere in your piece , that will be sufficient to invalidate your entire point and i win . 
  if any of your sources , citations , or legal authorities has received criticism from anyone anywhere ( from the comments section of a fox news story to vonmises.org to the aromatherapy section of the stormfront forums ) , then your entire point is invalidated and i win . 
  if at any time , you get frustrated and call me a moron , an idiot , ignorant , stubborn , or crazy , then that is ad hominem and i win .

  no , protestantism did away with the church as a vessel of truth and replaced it as being just some pastoral body to help people . 
  that and it introduced heresy , heresy everywhere , and fertile ground for more heresy to take place in a movement that teaches each individual 's interpretation of scripture is valid . 
  that 's why there are 50 000 sects of you , and 1 of us . 
  i have a cfw ps3 and one of the main appeals to me is doing remote play as i can do ps1 , ps2 + ps3 games on the vita . 
  obviously with tearaway , gravity rush , p4 etc there are good vita games too . 
  i 'm thinking of getting one secondhand , but am wondering whether the battery life and lack of needing a stupid cable are going to be worth holding off . 
  also if the price is going down in the future , maybe it 's worth waiting . 
  your thoughts / r/vita, 
  here 's my basic recipe, 
  - 6 green tea bags, 
  - 1.8 l boiling water, 
  - 2 heaped dessert spoons of honey . 
  from that recipe you can add some lemon juice or mint to it , and use jasmine tea or any other herbal tea as well for a different flavour . 
  it 's a great summer drink and low fat/low sugar too . 
  i have sri lankan relatives and was in colombo for a few weeks at the start of the year , but i have n't really been following the news much . 
  i know that there were protests against my country 's ( new zealand ) milk powder and that the commonwealth meeting attracted some controversy , but i have n't heard anything else . 
  so ... what 's up ? 
  what have you all been up to this year ? 
  how 's your part of the island doing ? 
  where are the capacitive buttons ? 
  i was in the store last week browsing phones and was excited to try the z1 . 
  i realized that you could barely navigate the phone with the onscreen buttons . 
  there 's all that space at the bottom for capacative buttons and they do n't even use it ? 
  why ?? 
  it 's pretty much a perfect phone if they just had decent navigation buttons . 
  i remember coming here around the time of the coup and seeing many people on the subreddit cheering on morsi being overthrown . 
  yet in the following weeks so many people died on the streets of cairo , alexandria and elsewhere . 
  it also seems from an outsiders perspective that the ideals of the revolution seem to be fading , sisi just looks like another mubarak to me . 
  i think morsi seemed awful , especially in his treatment to the copts and instituting islamic inspired law but the way he was deposed does n't seem to bode well for democracy in egypt . 
  apart from the bloodshed there has n't been much reported in the western media , which i know has made potential tourists wary of visiting , even though i 'm sure most of the country is safe now . 
  i would love to hear from egyptians as to how life has changed and your views on whether you think things are improving in egypt . 
  hi / r/travel, 
  my family is planning a 2-3 day trip from london to cornwall . 
  we 'll be doing a few short stops on the way . 
  none of us have been to cornwall or the region before . 
  i 'd love to get your opinions on the best sites in the area . 
  how can we as a nation be putting up with this ?? 
  first a single person searched out of thousands at the airport , and now our prime minister is outed as hitler in a maymay . 
  not necessarily expats but at least in english .

  seriously . 
  i have a 10 step plan for all of you, 
  1 - go fuck yourself . 
  this is not your subreddit , this is ours . 
  it 's a refuge for all faithsmashers on the internet . 
  you 've got the bible belt to wallow in your ignorance but we 've been exiled out of the promised subs of / r/atheismrebooted , / r/atheism and / r/freeatheism due to the religious poison of moderation . 
  2 - get the fuck out of / r/magicskyfairy . 
  3 - get the fuck out of / r/magicskyfairy . 
  4 - get the fuck out of / r/magicskyfairy . 
  5 - get the fuck out of / r/magicskyfairy . 
  6 - get the fuck out of / r/magicskyfairy . 
  7 - get the fuck out of / r/magicskyfairy . 
  8 - get the fuck out of / r/magicskyfairy . 
  9 - get the fuck out of / r/magicskyfairy . 
  10 - god 's not real .

  my favourite part of his ode to blogspam is how he does n't even know what sub he 's on, 
  when i was in 5th grade video games , weed , atheism , war of northern aggression . 
  mens rights . 
  and that 's how i found reddit . 
  edit : upvotes ? 
  really ? 
  seriously , go to africa or something where there 's no tradition ( no offense ), 
  ever since i modded my ps1 i 've been into the console modding scene and have a softmodded wii with wii and gamecube backups , and a cfw ps3 with ps3 , ps2 and ps1 backups . 
  i 'm sure if people are into emulation then there would be some overlap . 
  so is anyone else interested in starting a sub . 
  we could have a faq for all the different consoles as to whether they are moddable but also whether another console can emulate them e.g gba is emulatable on wii , ds , psp , ps3 etc. 
  edit : i see there is interest . 
  i 've created / r/hackstation for this purpose . 
  check it out and email modmail if you want a spot .
