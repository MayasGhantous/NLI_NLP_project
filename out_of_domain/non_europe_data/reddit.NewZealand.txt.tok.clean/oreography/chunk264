  the fact that your posse kills more animals than anyone else in any tribe anywhere is proven evidence . 
  hell , there 's even paintings on the cave walls all over town showing what a great guy you are and how the gods anointed you as the most holy speshul of the speshul cause you 're the meanest mother fucker in the tribe . 
  if a painting on a cave wall is n't proof enough , what is ? 
  and if anyone doubts you and says any shit about you your posse will fucking kill them . 
  and if anyone in your posse tries to spill the beans or break away and start their own posse your guys will kill that asshole . 
  congratulations , you 've just created the first religion . 
  in the interest of proving that your mom is , in fact , a fat whore , i 'm going to pester you for a month ( or more ) with replies to your stupid comments and and make you look bad . 
  there is one way for you to avoid this potentially traumatic situation : bow down to me as the supreme lord of the internet . 
  you have ten minutes to accept this offer , and an absence of response is tantamount to refusal .

  personally , despite ntp 's bravery , feinberg 's persecution complex still puts the spark in my spaceship . 
  who 's yours ? 
  i 'm not talking to you / r/atheism , not really . 
  i 'm talking the the people here to complain and troll and trash / r/atheism , specifically anyone who has ever used the line , `` i 'm an atheist , but i do n't proclaim it because i do n't want to be associated with / r/atheism/harris / dawkins/etc . '', 
  you people are the worst kinds of cowards . 
  there are hundreds of thousands , if not millions , of people who literally ca n't talk about their atheism for fear of being disowned , kicked out of their home , kicked out of their community , and some even fear death if they ever express their true beliefs . 
  they want to . 
  they want to share with the world the ideas that have uplifted them from fear and superstition . 
  you , coward , have this ability and choose not to use it . 
  why ? 
  because you 're afraid of losing internet cool points because some atheists might be meanies ? 
  you are the real embarrassments to atheism . 
  brave kids risk everything to come out while you risk nothing . 
  you owe it to those kids and all of us who have to be silent to speak up and use your voice . 
  to be so privileged that being an open atheist would not seriously effect your life at all is amazing . 
  do n't throw that opportunity away .

  slowly however i 've noticed the moderators are encroaching on our free speech . 
  i requested a new 0 click meme in modmail and none of them even replied back . 
  it 's suspicious that / u/eyjafjallajoekull and / u/gerudo _ pirate are on reddit the same time as / u/jij . 
  / r/atheism once had only three moderators . 
  we have over 7 times as many . 
  and with moderators come the curse of moderation . 
  how can we let this stand ? 
  are we really ignoring the spirit of skeen here . 
  is it possible that we have been invaded by enemies of reason within by those seeking to destroy this bastion of euphoria . 
  have we been invaded by jij 's sockpuppets ? 
  i think so . 
  if you are a real atheist , stand up , stand proud and say we do n't need any moderation in / r/magicskyfairy . 
  if the mods do n't stand down we will flood the new queue with memes and self posts . 
  stop .

  content creators can only create said content because they receive funding from you . 
  piracy is an important freedom in our sometimes restrictive societies , and it 's important to remember these things before you judge :, 
  some pirate something that they already bought simply to remove the drm . 
  some pirate to re-obtain something they already bought . 
  some pirate to try products before they make a financial commitment to them . 
  some pirate simply because they can not afford it . 
  some pirate to get something that 's no longer available . 
  some pirate because their country censors or does n't import it . 
  some pirate from companies that they feel do n't deserve their money, 
  lastly , here 's a few tips : adblock is awesome for hiding fake download links . 
  deluge is an excellent open-source client that is n't in close cooperation with the mpaa ( unlike utorrent , uninstall it as soon as possible ) . 
  oh , and remember : torrenting in itself is n't illegal , and it 's definitely not piracy !, 
  it 's simply a method of transferring files .

  my ps3 has cfw on but i 'm keeping my vita strictly legal . 
  i mainly bought one solely for the purpose of remote play , since i can play any ps3/2/1 game on mine . 
  when i do connect via private connection , it 's spotty and cuts out every five minutes . 
  i know there are several games that support remote play with an ofw ps3 , so am wondering how / r/vita has found the experience , and if you have any tips for improving it ? 
  i thought about setting a static ip on the ps3 + vita , not sure how much that will help though .
