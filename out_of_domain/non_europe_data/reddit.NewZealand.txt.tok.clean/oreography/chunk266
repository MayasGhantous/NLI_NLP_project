  sauce is from a private sub, 
  i still have n't played the latest generation of pokemon games but was wondering if there was any news on a definitive edition like there has been in the past . 
  i recently switched from firefox after getting sick of a persistent issue with a bookmark script breaking . 
  i have looked for a solution and found nothing . 
  i 'm currently using an addon called `` toomanytabs '' and averaging 3 different windows but it 's a poor solution . 
  firefox in regards to tabs has a far better ui , so i 'm wondering if there is any addon that makes it possible to do this ? 
  hi all, 
  i 'm doing my first properly responsive site and it seems in all the articles i 've read from 2-3 years ago they all advocate using the device-width @media query . 
  however looking at google 's guidelines they advocate min-width and max-width instead . 
  is this standard in the css3 spec now ? 
  he has proven himself a true christian by removing godless memes fromm / r/atheism . 
  we should extend this opportunity to him as soon as possible, 
  our neighbours are getting renovations done and it 's a real pain . 
  i 'm doing a student project at home most days and have to go to a different room just to escape it . 
  i 've been told my hearing is sensitive , so maybe it 's worse for me . 
  i 'm just wondering if anyone else is having the same issue . 
  gomenasai , my name is ken-sama . 
  i 'm a 27 year old american otaku ( anime fan for you gaijins ) . 
  i draw anime and manga on my tablet , and spend my days perfecting my art and playing superior japanese games . 
  ( disgaea , final fantasy , persona series ), 
  i train with my katana every day , this superior weapon can cut clean through steel because it is folded over a thousand times , and is vastly superior to any other weapon on earth . 
  i earned my sword license two years ago , and i have been getting better every day . 
  i speak japanese fluently , both kanji and the osaka dialect , and i write fluently as well . 
  i know everything about japanese history and their bushido code , which i follow 100 %, 
  when i get my japanese visa , i am moving to tokyo to attend a prestigious high school to learn more about their magnificent culture . 
  i hope i can become an animator for studio ghibli or a game designer !, 
  i own several kimonos , which i wear around town . 
  i want to get used to wearing them before i move to japan , so i can fit in easier . 
  i bow to my elders and seniors and speak japanese as often as i can , but rarely does anyone manage to respond . 
  wish me luck in japan !, 
  hi / r/surface . 
  i upgraded from the sp2 to the sp3 and have seen quite a few people on this sub considering the same thing . 
  so here are my thoughts between the two, 
  i bought the 128 gig , 4gig ram model secondhand but still under warranty for about half the price i got the sp3 new for . 
  i splurged and bought the 128 gig , 4 gb ram model new with a student discount , from the microsoft store site new zealand . 
  ** form factor **, 
  the pro 2 was a poor form factor . 
  using it in portrait mode is abysmal and the size and rectangular rather than square shape means it is a poor desktop too . 
  while these devices will always be a compromise the pro 2 felt like you compromised far too much . 
  you could never hold it for long in tablet mode as the weight was concentrated into a smaller area . 
  i found i seldom needed anything more than the two kickstand positions though . 
  the pro 3 is an ideal form factor . 
  it 's much lighter and the aspect ratio means it better suits being used as a tablet . 
  once you adjust some minor scaling/ui settings it 's practically perfect . 
  the pro 3 's weight is dispersed so it feels lighter than the smaller pro 3 . 
  ** pen **, 
  the pro 2 pen is excellent . 
  it 's light and thin but i prefer my pens that way . 
  the best drawing experience i 've ever had was on the pro 2 , if the screen size was a bit bigger it would have been perfect . 
  the pen would always detatch from the magnet in the charging port though , it 's hard to store the thing . 
  this was a concern for me upgrading to the pro 3 since one of the main reasons i purchased the pro 2 was for its drawing capabilities . 
  there 's no doubt the n trig is a poorer pen . 
  i think it 's a bit heavier than i would like it to be as well . 
  it feels a lot less natural drawing with it than the wacom did . 
  i 've found that on sketchbook it has an annoying cross hair whereas the pro 2 had a precision dot that is less distracting . 
  i have the latest wintab drivers and updates but have found it performs significantly better in onenote than other applications . 
  hovering over the screen is also much slower , if drawing is your only requirement then go for the pro 2 . 
  the pen fits quite nicely into the loop on the type cover 3 . 
  ** keyboard and track pad **, 
  the pro 2 more or less did not have a track pad . 
  the type cover 2 was fine for typing but the trackpad was completely unusable , which proved a major issue if wanting to use the machine as a laptop . 
  this was one of the main reasons i moved to the pro 3 . 
  one slightly annoyinng thing about both the type cover 3 and 2 is that the function keys require you to hold the function button to use them , so fn + f5 to refresh a web page . 
  the pro 3 's trackpad on the type cover 3 is fine . 
  it would be nice to be able to enable one finger scrolling but aside from that issue it 's just like any other laptops . 
  the keyboard is much the same and is perfectly adequate , maybe slightly cramped for long writing sessions but otherwise fine . 
  ** battery life **, 
  i bought mine secondhand so obviously it would be different from buying new , but the pro 2 battery performed very poorly . 
  i received the device completely reset , so there were no old drivers or memory hogging programs . 
  i had the screen brightness down to about 25 % and set max cpu useage to about the same and it still would only last 2-3 hours on average . 
  so far the pro 3 has been better , but nowhere near the 9 hours advertised . 
  i did a test and got 4 hours heavyish useage ( downloading steam games , running firefox with 10-15 tabs , writing an essay in word , one or two metro open as well ) . 
  for really light useage i imagine it 's 6-7 hours . 
  ** performance **, 
  the pro 2 i found did lag a little when using desktop applications . 
  it always felt more like running a computer than running a tablet . 
  the ram useage seemed to climb higher on my pro 2 and slow it down a little , i do n't know why though since they both have the same specs . 
  the pro 3 has been fine so far . 
  i have n't extensively tested games on it , but it runs alan wake and civ 5 fine on lower settings . 
  ** other things to note **, 
  the pro 2 had terrible scaling . 
  i believe i had mine set to 160 % at 1600 res with some other custom settings , but i could never seem to get the perfect setting . 
  the pro 3 's strange resolution and aspect ration means that some tweaks have to be made . 
  when watching videos in vlc , force the resolution to 16:10 and the letterboxing almost completely disappears . 
  i might think of some other things later but those are my thoughts for now . 
  feel free to ask any questions if i have n't covered it all . 
  i 'm in christchurch but just expecting to get one with assembly required . 
  i 've been through two `` executive '' ones including a crappy $ 100ish warehouse stationary one that broke within two weeks , and am now looking at more of a traditional style computing chair . 
  i find i get a sore back often but i do n't like the mesh backs . 
  budget $ 200 and under . 
  those of us in the asia pacific region have terrible pings otherwise, 
  this would probably push me over the edge for getting a wii u. 
  local multiplayer is a big thing for me , and i 'd prefer to use my four gamecube controllers for playing the games instead of shelling out for classic controllers . 
  this , as a white person who lived in the us my whole life i feel like i 'm not part of any particular culture and that my ethnicity ( and it 's characteristics ) is wholly aestetic and unrelated to my identity . 
  as a result i have no sense of communal responsibility , i do n't get easily offended , and do n't consider if i even belong to any sort of collective identity . 
  because of this i also do n't get how people can take their culture and ethnicity so seriously . 
  lastly as a white male , people who are n't white males see me as privileged . 
  due to this i do n't speak on social or racial issues in public , as people tend to discount my perspective because privilege . 
  i also avoid people of other races , because i 'm very socially awkward and am prone to offending people with faux pas and such and so long as i only offend other white people i 'm simply an asshole rather than a racist . 
  also i am very concerned i 'll get skin cancer sometime in my life .
