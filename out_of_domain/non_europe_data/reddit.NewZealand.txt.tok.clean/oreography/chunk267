  leave your tacos but please take your satanic catholicism away from america . 
  go back to where you came from ... asianland or wherever it is . 
  so ever since i got the pro 3 and up until now , i have been pushing the power button to sleep the device/turn the screen off automatically . 
  however now when i push the power button , a drop down screen comes up with the option of swiping to shut down the device . 
  the only way to put it to sleep is to go to the start screen or swiping left to power settings and selecting sleep from there . 
  in advanced power settings in control panel , it is set to sleep when using the power button . 
  because of this i 'm baffled as to what setting is causing the issue . 
  i know immigration has been a contentious issue , but i believe this will make for a stronger and more bootyful new zealand . 
  media is a science and an art . 
  media is a power . 
  media is control . 
  nothing is a mistake . 
  nothing is unintentional .

  there are dozens of techniques that can be used to make or destroy people . 
  you , are not uninfluenced . 
  you are vulnerable too . 
  here you are , explaining what is obscene .

  e.g the `` special '' features of an elephant include grey skin and tusks . 
  according to merriam webster `` of , relating to , or constituting a species '' is a definition , but no other dictionary seems to acknowledge the definition . 
  if `` special '' is not appropriate , is there another word that would be ? 
  hi / r/kindle, 
  my kindle keyboard broke recently after years of dilligent service , so i bought a new kindle7/touch . 
  i still prefer the physical buttons but the only real issue i 'm having at the moment is with footnotes . 
  whenever i click on the footnote link , it opens up a window in page displaying the footnote . 
  this is useful but it prevents me from highlighting any words in the footnote . 
  is there some way of jumping directly to the footnote location and making a highlight ? 
  i 'm reading the penguin translation of anna karenina if it makes any difference . 
  what are you guys into other than tagpro ? 
  i 'm potentially looking at getting a 15 inch retina macbook pro , but the storage costs are obscene . 
  my current laptop has a terabyte hdd in it . 
  to upgrade from the 256 gb storage to 1tb on the apple store is $ 1160 ( nzd ) for an extra 750 gigs !, 
  the 512 gb is somewhat more reasonable at a $ 400 upgrade but its still really expensive , especially since the device itself is already nearing $ 3000 without any upgrades . 
  does anyone know why the cost is so huge ? 
  additionally when were the last macbooks released with ssds/hdds instead of flash storage . 
  is there some way to customize a build with cheaper storage ? 
  our catholic population is far too low in new zealand and unemployment is too high . 
  i am looking for an environment where like minded people like myself are n't challenged , and to go to a country with zero unemployment rate . 
  my latin is poor , but i 'm currently learning portuguese which i hear is still fairly useful in a catholic country . 
  i 'd appreciate tips from anyone else who has made the same move . 
  a race traitor is not a girl who dates members of another race . 
  a race traitor is a girl who dates members of another race for an extended period of time , typically during her 20s , because she feels the most sexually attracted to them , and then proceeds to settle down with an asian beta provider only after she 's had her fun . 
  i have no problem with an indian girl who dates a white guy , then an indian guy , then a chinese guy , then another white guy , and then marries an indian guy . 
  i have a problem with an indian girl who dates and has casual sex exclusively with white guys for a period of up to ten years and then finds an indian man to be her provider .

  edit : downvotes are well and truly the fruits of the reformation !, 
  i shall remain steadfast against this persecution . 
  islam is n't in the 21st century , it 's out of this universe , this reality , elevated in dignity above everything -- it will never change -- the kuffar try to destroy it every century , but they never learn . 
  the mongols and their hordes were shattered by islam when they tried to destroy it by qutuz , and things will be no different . 
  none of your schemes shall ever damage islam , no amount of disgusting murtadd hypocrites , no amount of paid stooges like maaj the sex offender will ever see your futile plans reach fruition .

  i 'm not going to bother giving reasons though . 
  let that feigned outrage fly ... oh and the upvotes too , let them fly as well . 
  hi / r/videoediting . 
  sorry if this is a noob question , but i could n't find an answer from google or searching this sub . 
  i 'm using sony vegas pro 13 and wanting to render a video into an mp4 format with mp3 audio . 
  i 'm doing a multimedia project , and for html5 support they 're wanting to have separate audio codecs on the videos . 
  but for all of the mp4 templates in vegas , you ca n't seem to change the audio codec from aac . 
  i can export the video as separate . mp4 video and . mp3 audio tracks and assumedly merge them that way , but there does n't seem to be a way to change the mp4 templates to handlle mp3 audio . 
  is there any easy way to do this ? 
  i am a pedophile . 
  sort of . 
  i 'm attracted to girls who are just starting puberty , or who are midway through it . 
  i 'm also attracted to women my own age ( mid-twenties ) , but that does n't matter after i mention that first part , does it ? 
  i 'm used to being called a monster . 
  people use `` pedophile '' when they mean `` child molester , '' which really hurts . 
  never mind the fact that i ca n't control how i feel , and that i 've never acted on any of my feelings . 
  by society 's standards , i 'm a disgusting excuse for a human who deserves to be shunned and condemned . 
  i was never molested . 
  i was never raped . 
  i had a wonderful upbringing , full of caring parents , nurturing teachers , and beloved friends . 
  i was n't `` molded '' into what i am , and even if i 'd had sexual contact with an adult as a child , it would n't have done anything . 
  contrary to popular belief , sexual activity is never inherently harmful , though the context of it can be . 
  child molesters and abusers use fear and dishonesty , which is what is actually harmful . 
  as far as i know , i was born this way . 
  i fought against it for years , feeling ashamed , before i finally visited a psychologist . 
  she could n't help . 
  apparently pedophiles ca n't be cured . '', 
  child molesters can , but they 're almost never pedophiles , and that leads to the myth that therapy helps pedophiles . 
  she told me it was a lot more common than anyone wanted to admit , but that it was never going to be accepted . 
  so , i hide that part of me . 
  on the outside , i look like a friendly , fairly successful , and moderately attractive guy , but i can never be completely honest with anyone because of my big secret . 
  day in and day out , i see people using `` pedophile '' to mean something evil or disgusting ... and the people who might understand and who come to my support are downvoted and flamed by the same people who claim to be open-minded and progressive . 
  i often wish that i could meet a girl ( my age ) like me . 
  it 's not enough to have someone who understands ... they have to empathize . 
  they have to be like me . 
  it 's not about sharing a `` fetish '' or anything , either . 
  i just want to share myself with someone completely , even as a friend . 
  of course , that 's probably never going to happen . 
  as `` common '' as it might supposedly be , nobody will ever admit it ... to themselves or to me . 
  there are thousands upon thousands of pedophiles here on reddit . 
  most of us are good people . 
  it 's still a socially unacceptable thing . 
  if i ever admitted to it i 'd be cast out . 
  i 'd be fired from my job . 
  nobody would ever trust me again .
