  i might even be put in prison , all because of an attraction i ca n't control and have never acted on .

  there was a high quality version of this http://imgur.com/yb4gj2u on google , but it 's no longer available and so there 's only the preview . 
  would love any pictures . 
  hi / r/surface, 
  i was looking at taking a photo of a document with the in built camera app , but noticed that the camera is unusually dark . 
  other than exposure , there are no options to change the brightness setting . 
  on the store i stumbled across an app called mdscan ( the free version ) . 
  it 's designed for taking photos and outputting them as pds . 
  maybe decent for a taking photos of documents , but it has far more options of altering the camera settings . 
  i took a selfie and here 's a screenshot, 
  it comes up much more brighter on the front camera than the camera app , even without tweaking the settings . 
  is there any other app in the store that can give me more advanced features , given that i do n't want to save most pictures as pdfs . 
  a kinder surprise, 
  the video of her telling the palestinian girl that `` germany ca n't help everyone '' went viral . 
  it seemed that germany was going to take a tough stance on the refugee crisis . 
  and now she has seemingly changed her position . 
  did public opinion turn against her or did she have a genuine change of heart ? 
  i 'm curious as to what / r/games opinion is on the state of gaming magazines . 
  do you personally subscribe to any ? 
  obviously the internet has taken a lot of their marketshare ( rip nintendo power ) , but there 's still some prominent gaming magazines out there . 
  i used to read edge ( uk ) and hyper ( australian ) years ago . 
  both used to have some good features , but i 've no idea if either are as good as they used to be . 
  ** smack ** - brilliant attacker , competent defender . 
  great player allround . 
  ** vinsanitynz ** - great person and great player too . 
  more suited to attack than defense , but still good at it . 
  ** seven news ** - great team player . 
  always reliable and good to work with . 
  can often turn a game around . 
  come to think of it i 'm struggling to think of many def oriented players . 
  sorry if i did n't mention any of you ; know that you 're all great though :d, 
  also i miss you hfriends :(, 
  i 've seen several news articles referring to 1.1 million migrants having entered germany in 2015 as seen here http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-germany-iduskbn0ud19i20151230, 
  and here http://www.dw.com/en/nearly-11-million-migrants-arrived-in-germany-in-2015/a-18952130, 
  the articles were written several months ago and talk about an upcoming report to be published in january by the erstverteilung von asylbegehrenden , which would confirm the actual figures . 
  i 'm aware you 're probably all sick of foreigners asking about the crisis ( particular xenophobic americans ) but i 'm writing a blog post on the issue and would love to be able to find the figures . 
  like most of you i love the console , and believe it has had the best games on this gen so far . 
  it 's sad that it will effectively be finished once zelda releases . 
  obviously the console has sold terribly . 
  worse than the gamecube , which was something of a failure in itself . 
  i do think that there will be a handful of games that will be considered cult classics in the years to come , considering their poor sales figures but huge critical success . 
  what other console would you compare the wii u too ? 
  i was thinking the wii u shares quite a lot in common with the dreamcast in terms of its short life span . 
  at least the wii u will be looked upon more favourably than the vita was . 
  your thoughts / r/wiiu ? 
  i have specifically set no layer styles & no stroke on each shape ( located on individual layers ) , but it 's creating them with a 1-2px black stroke anyways . 
  i do n't want to abandon the document so i 'm wondering what setting i could possibly have on that 's causing it . 
  here is a screenshot , and the three shapes visible are those that can be seen in the layers panel, 
  i looked at the online schedule on their site , and the first entry talks about a sports match instead of the ceremony . 
  just wondering when it is . 
  i tried playing the original wii version of xenoblade chronicles recently , but after seeing the eshop release had gamepad support i thought i would buy that and play the game that way . 
  i had only played for two hours on the original with the wii controls , but despite being inferior to a conventional gamepad there were no major issues with the game itself . 
  today after downloading the eshop version and loading up my wii save i immediately ran into camera issues . 
  by default the camera would display in an overhead view , that was directly over the players . 
  you could barely see a meter or two in front of you or the surrounding environment . 
  using the right thumb stick i was able to adjust the camera into a playable position , but it would automatically revert to the unplayable overhead view . 
  i tried all the camera settings in the game menu but none seem to help . 
  when i press y to reset the camera position it jerks into a playable angle , before always to the ridiculous overhead view . 
  has anyone else experienced this issue with the game ? 
  i just want to play it as normal . 
  hi / r/apple . 
  i got some bad news today from the computer repair shop that my laptop has a fault with the motherboard that 's unfixable and it 's going to be nearly $ 1000 nzd to replace , so i 'm stuck with buying a new laptop . 
  i 've only ever used windows as a serious os , though i know my around osx . 
  given the build quality and previous issues with other laptops i 'm considering a mac . 
  however the storage options seem disappointing . 
  i upgraded the ram and hdd on my last laptop , swapping it out with a 1tb 2.5 sata transcend ssd . 
  i 'm wanting to continue using the same ssd in a new laptop . 
  i realize that i 'm unable to upgrade the ram at all in any new macs , but it seems that there are few options for upgrading the ssd as well . 
  for the 15 inch retina models , what are the options for ssds ? 
  i saw owc offers an apple approved pcie ssd , but a 1tb model is still very expensive . 
  i saw that you could enable a trim command to enable third party ssds , but would this support my sata model or not ? 
  there is no way of using my current 2.5 sata ssd with some sort of adapter ? 
  has anyone ever upgraded the ssd of the current model 2013 macbook pro 13 ( non retina ) ? 
  i 'm wondering if this is the best option if i do n't want to bankrupt myself , though i 'd prefer a 15 inch display . 
  tl ; dr want to upgrade a new macbook using an existing ssd . 
  do i have any options ? 
  hi / r/suggestalaptop . 
  i 'm looking at buying a new laptop and am interested in the dell xps 15 . 
  i was looking at a macbook pro but i learned that the hard drive is impossible to upgrade . 
  i put a 1tb 2.5 sata ssd in my old laptop a few months ago , but it has an unfixable defect with the motherboard . 
  i 'm wanting to put that ssd in a new laptop . 
  i see the dell xps 15 has a 256gb pcie ssd . 
  is there any way of puting a sata ssd in it ? 
  thanks for the help .
