  the size is pretty much perfect for me . 
  i have all the tablet functionality i need + more . 
  it 's my gps , camera , mp3 player , game console , video player , document viewer , pda , flashlight ... pretty much do everything mobile device . 
  i 'd get a good wallet style leather case for it though . 
  for the s3 it 's obviously more powerful ( quad core instead of dual ) + has a better camera . 
  that seems to be about it really . 
  the camera on the note is great , but it has shutter lag compared to the iphone and s3 . 
  ultimately it looks like the note would be a good fit for you . 
  if you 're in the us i 'd get the unlocked one . 
  i 'm unfortunately still waiting for 4.0 in nz , but gingerbread is n't that bad just a bit buggy . 
  quick edit : i have a 64gb micro sd in mine . 
  i think 16gb would fill up pretty quickly considering my photos folder is at 7gb already . 
  you can chuck an ipod touch 's worth of music on , 10-15 movies , several gigs of photos , plenty of apps ... i should n't need to convince you that more storage is better though . 
  edit 2 : just got the 4.0 update last night . 
  holy crap . 
  the phone is so much faster . 
  swiping between screens is more fluid + the s pen responds even better than before !, 
  did n't get the s note app for some reason but am downloading the apk from xda . 
  ridiculous . 
  they 're trying to block the s3 for sale as well , even though it looks nothing like an iphone, 
  oh ok , thanks for the info . 
  hey   . 
  i 'm a really nice atheist guy , you can tell by my emoticons  :p . can you possibly pm me pictures of your bountiful godless tits for science : ? 
  hi , noticed you have a note like me . 
  how would you compare it to the s3 ( and one x if you want to ) for everyday useage . 
  i 'm on ics and i find it still has quite a few bugs + an annoying issue where the screen sometimes becomes unresponsive . 
  the main thing i 'd like to know though is how does the camera , pdf viewing + video watching compare . 
  i love having the bigger screen , and could n't see myself watching videos on anything smaller . 
  the lag on the camera can be a bit annoying sometimes , but i 've heard there 's none on the s3 . 
  oh and if you could compare battery life that would be good too . 
  fucking r/bingo , making exaggerated rage comics and facebook posts about how stupid non bingo players are . 
  they barely ever back up their playing bingo arguments , and when challenged moan about how playing bingo is being oppressed . 
  definitely a circlejerk if i saw one . 
  hey baby um ... i want to fuck you . 
  yeah , is that subtle enough ? 
  i always enjoy the museum ( though if you 're going to wellington te papa is much better ) and as said take a trip to one of the volcanoes like rangitoto . 
  waiheke island , also easily accessible by ferry is very nice .

  the nexus is old news now, 
  oh my god , this piece of shit here has to be the worst post i 've ever seen on reddit .

  i say this as a christian . 
  the ex gay movement is flawed . 
  i highly recommend you watch a documentary called for the bible tools me so , on homosexuality and christianity if you want to understand the issue further . 
  it addresses pauls verses and the sodom and leviticus verses as well . 
  there are also lots of discussions on / r/christianity about it . 
  i think its time.we started accepting that it 's ingrained in their nature rather then just a choice . 
  have you tried emu paradise , they have a lot of isos . 
  in fact i 'm certain they have ff7 .
