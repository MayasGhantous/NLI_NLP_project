  if you want to play the pc version they have a cool high res texture mod, 
  stick to ps1 + older . 
  you might be able to get gamecube working via dolphin though, 
  it 's a choice to engage in homosexual sex just as it 's a choice to engage in heterosexual sex . 
  the whole issue depends on if homosexuality ( not homosexual sex ) is a choice or not . 
  if it is ingrained into their nature that they feel no attraction towards the opposite sex , then it 's plain cruel to stop them from entering into a loving monogamous relationship . 
  i 'll agree that homosexual sex out of marriage would be considered a sin , but if they ca n't get married then how is it ever possible to not be considered sin ? 
  and there are plenty of proclaimed gay men and women who make fine christians . 
  have you ever asked your ` ex gay friends ' why they withheld from their urges ? 
  most likely it was their family or church that told them they were ` sinners ' they were ` immoral ' their very nature shamed their peers . 
  god values the heart , not piousness . 
  we can all throw stones at people all day long , but it 's not going to do us any good . 
  how does suicide take balls ? 
  it 's giving in to fear and misery . 
  it 's accepting that your life is n't worth living . 
  what takes real balls is the struggle to break out of the depression or heartbreak that are the symptoms of it . 
  we should never celebrate suicide , but we should never judge people for it either . 
  i think a smiley face for any sentence with suicide seems a bit wrong, 
  no , because these activites do n't conflict with your right to live . 
  if you die while skydiving , the choice was not to die , but to partake in an activity and live . 
  endangering yourself is n't a choice to die . 
  when you die by suicide ( unless something goes wrong/right so you live ) your choice is to die , which forsakes your right to life . 
  well , you can play the n64 version of snap on wii, 
  i know quite a few people still using it . 
  does anyone know if you change your number from telecom to another provider after they stop the service ? 
  your account is shit , that 's why you 're getting so few upvotes/downvotes . 
  people just ignore you . 
  plus the fact you have to state it 's a troll account when it 's such an obviously bad troll , does n't help things . 
  thanks for the info, 
  how have you found developing for bb10 ? 
  in rainbows was fantastic . 
  i could n't stand the latest one though . 
  the only systems you would probably need aside from a ps2 are a 3ds and a psp . 
  chain of memories ps2 version is available , and the gba one will likely be out on 3ds ambassador . . or playable if you have cfw on your psp . 
  birth by sleep is a must play ... seriously . 
  in fact it 's more important you play this on psp than get a 3ds . 
  look at custom firmware on your psp . 
  you could buy one and play all your retro ps1 , snes , gba games on it , as well as download psp games if price is important . 
  on the 3ds you can play 358/2 days which is pretty important and also the new one , which seems to be quite important as well . 
  if you really want to be cheap , you can emulate 358/2 days on pc . 
  do n't even bother with re coded . 
  just watch the ending on youtube . 
  i do agree that the plot is getting really convoluted , but i think after birth by sleep it 's making more sense . 
  just play birth by sleep !, 
  you can play every kingdom hearts game on pc if you want . 
  google pcsx2 for a ps2 emulator , you need a powerful pc though . 
  desmume can play 358/2 days . 
  you 'll need a psp for birth by sleep though . 
  if you do buy one get custom firmware on it . 
  i would love to see your thesis film , if you did put it online ? 
  hey look at my caps lock !, 
  in sweden , porn is a human right . 
  i do n't know why america would frown upon such a thing . 
  oh that 's right ... christianity !, 
  good luck fapping op !, 
  oh absolutely . 
  stalin , mao , pol pot , jim jones , jeffrey dahlmer . 
  all smart , ethical and honest human beings who each killed tens to millions of people . 
  he should n't be followed with a cult like mentality ... but omg he is the greatest man who ever lived !, 
  give me upvotes fellow ~ ~ ** atheists ** ~ ~ ** scientists ! ** . 
  let us purge the world of religion together !!, 
  every atheist on facebook is immune to the poisonous cancer that it transmits . 
  we are protected by logic and reason and so our iq does n't falter , instead it fights the cancer of religion !, 
  asbolutely . 
  you know i 'm so fucking sick of them coming here telling us we 're a circlejerk as well . 
  so what if we post the same images and quotes of scientists and meet every day online in a designated location t to admire them . 
  so what if we always agree to what is posted so long as it comes from one of the great scientists . 
  it 's just strong admiration ... you ca n't worship science anyways . 
  there 's a big difference between this and a bible verse ... this is the truth . 
  though it has n't been proven , it 's obviously what is ** logical ** and ** reasonable ** and all those who disagree with it are wrong . 
  i 'm sure it 's fantastic . 
  put it up on r/videos and reap in sweet imaginary internet points . 
  `` arrested because his findings did n't fit the telavivision dogma '', 
  he did n't even get upvotes with that pun ? 
  i thought it was an unwritten law on the streets of london , that if you do n't have a parking space you ca n't have an suv . 
  i played soccer against my mother and she beat me . 
  it 's ok though , because i love her , 
  if you continue to see yourself as a monster , then that 's what you 'll become . 
  your perception of self defines how you act . 
  i would advise seeing a counsellor or therapist asap . 
  seek help , there are most likely community groups that meet for addictions . 
  just having someone to talk to who does n't judge is a huge help . 
  well we do repost le logical rage comics every day to get the message out . 
  you 're ~ ~ preaching ~ ~ reasoning to the ~ ~ choir ~ ~ scientists here . 
  bake cookies and watch the lion king, 
  tomba/tombi - would desperately love to play it, 
  crash bandicoot/spyro made by the original developers, 
  ** and release kingdom hearts 3 square !, 
  birth by sleep is worth playing . 
  it 's the first in the series story wise, 
  well you 'll definitely be getting that one, 
  the characters are also in the latest kingdom hearts game, 
  the guy does n't even take parts of the bible literally , and you believe one obviously outdated quote by a member of the church is something he 's going to have to follow ? 
  omg , do you believe every word thomas aquinas wrote ? . 
  here 's a quote by him `` fuck ... atheists ... we ... must ... preach ... dogma '' . 
  fucking owned bitch , where 's you 're god !!, 
  checkmate !!, 
  this guy refuses to get off his high horse . 
  now he 's done his own priest ama . 
  i vomited when i saw andrew smith .
