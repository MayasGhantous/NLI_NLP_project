  there seem to be a few coastal towns near athens that look nice as well . 
  would n't you expect the owner to have all of the zoning information before you buy though ? 
  yes it would be great to have a local especially for translation of the papers , and to make sure i 'm not getting ripped off . 
  as i say plans are n't definite at the moment , but it does look like it could be a very good time to buy . 
  ah thanks for the offer . 
  my plans are n't definite but i will keep your company in mind , considering that crete seems to have some beautiful locations . 
  even being optimistic , i think a price of bread would be an exaggeration . 
  i do n't know if you keep all your games , but it 's ridiculous that you ca n't buy shantae in the nz eshop . 
  i changed mine to the uk and have stayed with it . 
  from new zealand . 
  almost everyone i 've spoken to who has dealt with afrikaans south africans hate them , and think they 're rude and sexist . 
  most south africans are fine , but the afrikaans ones are the worst . 
  he does n't need it , but there are plenty of people who do and so we are commanded to give it to the needy . 
  why do you want the rituals and the structure ? 
  is n't the whole point about your belief system that there is nothing required of you ? 
  because you already fucking have democracy !, 
  bla bla bla my rights are being taken away bla bla bla evidence ? 
  i mean ... ahem ... this oppression is literally putting me in virtual shackles . 
  rise fellow neckbeards , let us create a white house petition to remove god from our currency . 
  then we will truly be brave . 
  light irish accent, 
  breathy french accent on a girl, 
  audrey hepburn style `` hollywood '' girls accent, 
  welsh accent ( for girls at least ), 
  why bother when you have the union jack ? 
  though it does look nice flying on historic buildings . 
  good intentions but a bit simplistic , no ? 
  faith in the lord can take years to achieve for some people and can be a lifetime struggle even for christians . 
  i 'm with you there . 
  did i ever mention hitler was a christian . . no ? 
  hitler was a christian . 
  literally all retardation comes from the scum that is religion . 
  as a middle class , white atheist i feel the shackles of religion tightening around our country and need to point out the oppression i face on a daily basis . 
  despite the indoctrinated majority of historians who believe he was a real person my ** logic ** and ** reason ** shows me otherwise, 
  to think someone even took the time to make this bullshit is ridiculous . 
  no matter what we do we will never outjerk the ** logic ** and ** reason ** that sweats out of those walking persecution complexes . 
  let 's go to a braver place . 
  because science is what the cool kids do right ? 
  wish you did n't have to root it, 
  i was hoping for a ` best of square ' one with chrono , final fantasy + kingdom hearts, 
  being a filthy colonial myself and only ever having been to london , bath and cheddar i imagine small town uk has average public transport as well . 
  in la and new york public transport is fine . 
  hey guys , my great grandaddy was a leprecan !, 
  i 've even been to boston once , that counts right ? 
  coming from new zealand i believe our chocolate is pretty similar . 
  we have cadburys here too ( and even better brands ) and trying the uk variety it tastes the same . 
  has n't ibiza been ceded to the uk yet ? 
  you guys pretty much own all the property, 
  do you have a gaming/top spec pc ? 
  if you do you can play the first two on a ps2 emulator . 
  i 'm sure there 's a dollar reserve ps2 auction on ebay though , and if you really want to be stingy you can buy swapmagic and not even buy the games if you 're low on cash . 
  the fine colour blend clearly indicates remuera . 
  nice try though . 
  the songs do n't seem boring , they do still hold up . 
  it 's not just hipsters that appreciate the beatles , people who 've never even heard of them love them because the melodies and the lyrics still reach people . 
  obviously the recording technology + rock and pop genres have evolved but the singles + later albums all are genuinely classics as they hold up even today . 
  it 's not all bad , they even have a watertower . 
  kingdom hearts, 
  pokemon blue, 
  just cause 2, 
  you 're ruining his perfection . 
  go sit in the shade !, 
  a deist is n't `` essentially an atheist '' . 
  yes , they both believe the supernatural does n't interfere with their lives , but one believes a supreme being created the universe and exists and the other does n't . 
  that might be a similar trait , but they are still very different . 
  please stop posting this . 
  it 's pretentious , smug and makes you look like a 13 year old . 
  / r/christianity seems to have pretty good discussions without the endless memes , as does / r/trueatheism . 
  it 's the lack of moderation and the fact it 's default that contributes to its shittiness . 
  oh , well and the smug teenage users , but that 's controlled with moderation . 
  smoking already is a taboo though i agree on seatbelts . 
  why are n't they on busses ? 
  this has to be a troll . 
  otherwise he 's the most delusional ` gaymer ' ever . 
  nintendo does n't even bring up heterosexual sex in their games , and he wants `` teenage penises '', 
  i love dolphin broswer hd . 
  the ui and layout 's really good and it handles flash content well, 
  there 's no point in having diversity just for the sake of it . 
  it does n't matter what colour a persons skin is so long as they perform well . 
  right , but those who claim to be ` agnostic ' might be either agnostic theists or agnostic atheists . 
  you ca n't assume they 're agnostic atheists when they do n't specify it . 
  hi there buddy . 
  first of all i 'd like to congratulate you on breaking free from the chains of ** religion ** the scum that literally is keeping america back in the dark ages . 
  i 'd recommend you keep posting to / r/atheism as well . 
  it 's good we have such a wonderful place to vent against irrational theists who believe in sky daddys, 
  all the best, 
  nick beard, 
  unfortunately it does n't look like you will be getting to the south island , which is a shame considering it has some of the best scenery . 
  there 's plenty to do in auckland though . 
  head out to waiheke island and do rangitoto . 
  you might as well do rotorua to see a `` traditional '' read , fake tourist maori demonstration . 
  i 'm sure you 're reading wikitravel , lonely planet etc for suggestions so you can make the best of your limited time here . 
  morocco would be a great choice . 
  in the cities many people are bilingual with arabic and french . 
  it also has some of the most spectacular sights in africa and a well developed infrastructure for tourists . 
  there are plenty of other countries in africa that speak french but many of them ( drc for example ) are n't exactly top holiday spots . 
  pfft , did n't you hear ? 
  there are 1.5 billion atheists in the world . 
  if we include the buddhists and hindus ( which barely have gods amirite ) the total comes to 20 gazillion !, 
  ** logic ** fundies , deal with it .
