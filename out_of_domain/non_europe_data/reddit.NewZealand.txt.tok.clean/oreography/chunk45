  i 'm from christchurch but have been to several churches in auckland before . 
  church unlimited pastored by tak bhana is really good , he has videos on youtube . 
  i go to an elim church in christchurch and they have them in auckland . 
  they 're non denominational and very open . 
  if you want a relaxing environment i 'd consider going there . 
  i 'm sure there are plenty of good ones on the north shore but i hardly ever go up there since my relatives do n't live there . 
  haha happy to oblige . 
  always nice to see another kiwi on this board . 
  haha , perhaps we can show the rest of / r/christianity the dark side of nz christianity . 
  haha , it 's funny cuz ur god lulz !, 
  but i 've got my god hates fags billboards and everything !, 
  what the fuck did you just fucking say about me , you little bitch ? 
  i 'll have you know i graduated top of my class in the atheist academy , and i 've been involved in numerous secret raids on fundies facebook pages , and i have over 300 confirmed deconversions . 
  i am trained in internet warfare and i 'm the top ddosser on the whole of / r/atheism . 
  you are nothing to me but just another illogical fundie . 
  i will wipe your beleifs the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth , mark my fucking words . 
  you think you can get away with saying that shit about atheism over the internet ? 
  think again , fucker . 
  as we speak i am contacting my secret network of neckbeards across the usa and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the logic , maggot . 
  the logic that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life . 
  you 're fucking dead , kid . 
  i can be anywhere , anytime , and i can deconvert you in over seven hundred ways , and that 's just with my mind .

  most of the people calling out your `` logic '' are atheists, 
  [ wuv u neil ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/yiv6z/every_great_scientific_truth_goes_through_three/c5w6y06 ), 
  waaahhh stop the oppression !, 
  they hate me for my non beliefs , yeah , that 's it !, 
  it was n't that i was being a jerk , it was oppression !!!, 
  i 'm going back to / r/antiatheismwatch and we can all be persecuted together . 
  care to share the artists name ? 
  sweden is paradise but amerikka is rubbing their greedy jewish fingers over her, 
  this man has the science spirit !, 
  yes , it 's undeniable ** logic ** that the christian dark ages have literally held us all back from living in atheist utopia . 
  i 'm glad you get it , my mum fucking does n't ... 
  yellow screen ? 
  is this a big problem ? 
  i 'm supposed to be getting mine tomorrow, 
  i 've been waiting for a steam like service for movies for a long time . 
  $ 5-10 to buy older movies and have them tied to your account . 
  a program on the computer , smartphone , tablets etc + a box that hooks up to your tv . 
  you can download the movies you own in low - high quality or stream the movies from their servers . 
  it would do so well , i do n't know why no ones started it . 
  netflix is nice but there 's no ownership involved . 
  i like asb especially their online banking . 
  their savings account rates are n't bad and they offer some good student discounts . 
  the staff are always very helpful as well . 
  ecuador and chavez influenced northern south american nations take a lot of pride in standing up to the west . 
  it 's all a big publicity stunt for his government to show how evil america/the west is , and he is standing up for the poor freedom fighting australian . 
  it 's actually not so bad , unless you chew gum or do drugs . 
  then it 's very bad . 
  it was famously described as disneyland with the death penalty , but it 's relaxed a lot since lee kwan yew , the benevolent dictator left . 
  amazing food , sites and everyone speaks english . 
  no culture compared to hong kong though ... 
  good lord . 
  come to new zealand , you could study internationally here cheaper !, 
  you know you 've literally raped your computer right ? 
  how hard is it to jump from java to c++ ? 
  java seems to have more support for game dev , but i thought the transition would be easier from c # to c++, 
  to be fair , believing that your life continues and your dreams , goals , everything you built up over your life wo n't waste away with your body does give you some significance . 
  kingdom hearts . 
  most games it gives depth , but with kingdom hearts it 's like every character pops out . 
  ** that 's ** ^ not ^ funny . 
  ** my ** ^ cousin ^ was ^ killed ^ by ^ a ^ narwhal . 
  ^ she ^ forgot ^ her ** bravery ** ** suit ** . 
  my neckbeard was n't religious , but some theist he did n't even like got up and started singing some indoctrination song . 
  i jumped up and started raging at the entire place . 
  i flipped my shit and started saying every brave word i could think of . 
  i raged for a while and stormed out . 
  my neckbeard was prominent in the community and there was a lot of people there all dressed up and i had on an old subhumans tshirt . 
  it was actually pretty awesome , i wish someone would have filmed it . 
  you can get steamed pork buns !, 
  you can also pay for them with the same card you use to take the mtr, 
  i love how you captured the cloudy sky with the leaves in the wind . 
  really nice choice of colours as well . 
  this is a real place but it 's an artists depiction of it . 
  do we still allow it ? 
  it 's not really imaginary . 
  i 've got a clan of gingerbread men, 
  here a man, 
  there a man, 
  lots of gingerbread men, 
  take a couple if you wish, 
  they 're on the dish, 
  it 's not really a portable any more at all . 
  i do love those screens though , it 's a better gaming system - not a better handheld .
