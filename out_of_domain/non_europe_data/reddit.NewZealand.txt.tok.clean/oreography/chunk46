  seeing those screens in person really makes a big difference . 
  i 'd watched videos of it , but i still went `` wow ! '', 
  when i saw them . 
  if you have a flashcart for your 3ds or if you play lots of ds games it 's definitely worth it . 
  everything 's much more immersive , it 's just a fantastic device . 
  a 3d remake of ff v + 6 would be cool , since they did 3 + 4 on the ds . 
  can you not buy games online at all ? 
  haha awesome , vi , vii and 10 are my faves, 
  what the fuck did you just fucking say about atheism , you little bitch ? 
  i 'll have you know i graduated top of my class in the atheist academy , and i 've been involved in numerous secret raids on fundies facebook pages , and i have over 300 confirmed deconversions . 
  i am trained in internet warfare and i 'm the top ddosser on the whole of / r/atheism . 
  you are nothing to me but just another illogical fundie . 
  i will wipe your beleifs the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth , mark my fucking words . 
  you think you can get away with saying that shit about atheism over the internet ? 
  think again , fucker . 
  as we speak i am contacting my secret network of neckbeards across the usa and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the logic , maggot . 
  the logic that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life . 
  you 're fucking dead , kid . 
  i can be anywhere , anytime , and i can deconvert you in over seven hundred ways , and that 's just with my mind . 
  not only am i extensively trained in internet combat , but i have access to the entire arsenal of the united states atheist foundation and i will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the internet , you little shit . 
  if only you could have known what illogical retribution your little `` clever '' comment was about to bring down upon you , maybe you would have held your fucking tongue . 
  but you could n't , you did n't , and now you 're paying the price , you goddamn idiot . 
  i will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it . 
  you 're fucking deconverted , kiddo . 
  this is inspiring stuff . 
  i also contemplate how being an atheist is like an invisible alternative universe where humanity are slaves for a master machine race , to point out the ridiculousness of a g0d !, 
  they do good herbal tea , and bubble tea , just not english tea . 
  the tea i had in california was the sweetest cup of tea i 've ever had . 
  hey , no black keys . 
  that ca n't be a good thing . 
  they actually have a pretty big music scene up there . 
  if you can get eve apples , they 're without a doubt the best fruit to grace this green earth . 
  eve  braeburn  jazz  fuji  inferior apple types, 
  i looked at amazon and apparently tunisia lists video games as sensitive items . 
  what about mario kart would offend allah ? 
  you could have a look at play asia but unfortunately it seems tunisia restricts video games . 
  is there not a black market or something in tunis ? 
  you can ** unsubscribe ** if you want fundie !, 
  i 'm not accusing you our your of being a terrorist/islamist i just wondered why there would be a restriction on video games . 
  i thought it might have been based on some law in the quaran but it seems it was just something the old president instituted . 
  i definitely hope things improve with your new constitution though . 
  ah , good to know . 
  salaam alaykum friend , i hear tunis is a beautiful city, 
  use this http://www.gamerankings.com/browse.html?site=ds&amp;cat=0&amp;year=0&amp;numrev=4&amp;sort=0&amp;letter=&amp;search= or metacritic, 
  or / v/s recommended games wiki, 
  the system had a ton of good games . 
  almost all the first party nintendo ones were worth playing . 
  can we all hear your accomplishements oh brave one ? 
  because i think walking on the moon ranks pretty high, 
  so humble, 
  closet atheist right there folks, 
  $ 2 for a nes game , $ 3 for gbc , $ 5 for snes and gba would be good . 
  ** science !, 
  geneva is for heathens . 
  i hope you 're washed in the blood of the lamb after reading that filth . 
  king james , hallowed be his name , was the only publisher with divine inspiration from god himself !, 
  this is the right response op . 
  ** show ** them what christ would do , tell them about him if pressed . 
  i do n't recommend the case for ... series , it seems a bit sensationalized from what i 've read . 
  ** le scientist ** ftfy, 
  everything is atheism . 
  truth of the science spirit right here !, 
  all praise thee neil , under the sagan . 
  forever will he live on in the cosmos . 
  if i was to burn a copy of the god delusion and post it on / r/atheism can you imagine the response ? 
  it 's not the burning of the book that matters it 's your attitude to what it represents that shows you 're giving no respect to something others hold dearly . 
  perhaps , but it is relevant as well . 
  no but come on , let 's be honest . 
  if there was , even that idiot would n't have gone near it . 
  yes , i 'm almost certain he would n't have . 
  he would have legal suits , death threats and might be fired from his record label . 
  perhaps he is brave/stupid enough to do so , but i think even he knows how difficult it would be to insult a religion with such hysterically angry followers . 
  i think it 's significantly more difficult to attack islam as we 've seen the darker side of insulting it in denmark with the cartoons and in the uk with rushdies satanic letters . 
  you have minority religious members accused of blaspheming the faith in pakistan who get the death penalty . 
  i agree that hiding from religious extremism is n't a good thing , as it 's letting fear control you but people all know the consequences of insulting the faith . 
  the atheists that have criticized islam ( hitchens was a notable one ) have n't dared to burn a koran as they know the consequences . 
  christianity is a much easier target as it does n't preach for it 's followers to retaliate when insulted and instead to turn the other cheek . 
  i do n't assume this is an attack on christians . 
  i think it 's him trying to be provocative . 
  but it 's stupid to deface books regardless of what they stand for . 
  definitely upgrade while you can still get decent money on ebay/amazon . 
  games are just much better to play , ds and 3ds . 
  i 've a supercarddstwo on mine and ds games look incredible . 
  the stylus is nicer as well , and easier to use . 
  if you use to put your 3ds in your jacket or jean pocket then it 's less portable though , but if you mostly played at your house/took it in a backpack then its definitely worth it . 
  i thought it was that global warming had wiped everyone out ( due to the massive lakes/smaller continents ) and so everyone would be atheist since no one would be alive . 
  pure undistilled bravery, 
  the bravest joke i 've ever seen, 
  tl ; dr i 'd like to make a documentary edited to show how stupid you all are , and put it on youtube to reach maximum karma !, 
  yes , i would say the same for dawkins non biological works as well . 
  perhaps it 's just a matter of preference , but i was n't a fan . 
  do n't forget having to gasp read through the terms of conditions of every piece of software they install . 
  all computer would have webcams tracing the eyes of users , so if you do n't read them you do n't get to install your browser of choice . 
  and there will only be one browser available , with government sanctioned sites . 
  i highly recommend you get the xl . 
  as someone who had the original 3ds , you really ca n't go back to playing on such a small screen . 
  ds games look really great on it as well , the stylus is better and so is the battery . 
  if you 're wanting a pocketable console i would n't recommend it , but if you 're putting it in a bag or using it at home i 'd definitely go with the xl, 
  how was it like reciting carl sagan on the moon ? 
  the brits make fun of themselves , their friends and anything they want to deride .
