  it 's likely to just be a spin off if we get one . 
  though there is hope we might get 3d remakes of v + iv since they did iv and iii on ds, 
  submission actually , but pretty similar, 
  ** p ** e ** o ** p ** l ** e are just ** p ** ersecuting ** o ** ther brave scien ** t ** ists with no reason to do so , since no true atheist would ever harm another person . 
  well he is an atheist .

  jazz jackrabbit 3, 
  darqwolff is precious . 
  anyone know if he 's an oppressed middle class atheist as well ? 
  you are ** so brave !, 
  ** i know you can come up with the thousands of dollars of income with no work experience , and provide for a significant other , i just know you can !, 
  first album i have n't pirated in like 2 years . 
  it 's incredible !, 
  have you got a video of it ? 
  yeah , games look amazing on a flatscreen, 
  i think most people would love the pixar worlds to make an entrance . 
  with so many disney movies having been used , i think it makes sense to use them in kh3, 
  not worth it, 
  if it puts pressure on beijing to rethink implementing it and casts them in a bad light then it is important . 
  it 's because he 's well known as one of the most militant and angry personalities on / r/atheism, 
  what the fuck did you just say about my michelle obama you little bitch ? 
  i 'll have you know i gained top of my karma in / r/politics , and i participated in many raids on / r/worldnews , and i have more than 300 confirmed victories . 
  i am trained in internet warfare and i 'm the best cyber democrat on the entire internet . 
  you 're nothing to me but just another target . 
  i 'll fucking wipe with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth , believe me whore . 
  you think you can get away with saying that shit about michelle obama on the internet ? 
  think again , asshole . 
  as we speak , i am with my secret network of democrats across the usa and your ip address is traced now to help you prepare for the emails , republicunt . 
  the emails that overloads pathetic little thing you call your inbox . 
  are you kidding conservitard ? 
  i can be anywebsite , anytime , and i can rig a online poll more than seven hundred ways , and it is only with my bare keyboard . 
  not only am i extensively trained in cyber combat , but i have access to the entire arsenal of the democrats wikipedia pages and i will use it to its full extent to wipe your backwards ass off the surface of your electorate , you little shit . 
  if only you could know what internet retribution your little `` clever '' comment was about to fall on you , maybe you 'd kept your views to yourself . 
  but you have not , you do not , and you are now paying the price , stupid southerner . 
  i will throw pamphlets all over you and drown you in them . 
  he 's a troll by the way . 
  his username when debating gay marriage is forevermarried for god 's sake !, 
  the thing with the beatles is that even for only being round for 7 years , their work is really incredibly diverse . 
  i suggest you listen to the albums rubber soul and revolver , a lot of people like their later stuff and not the early pre 65 songs . 
  i think their whole catalogue is great but those are my two favourite albums . 
  why do you get that impression ? 
  he just strikes me as a nerdy guy who makes music . 
  it 's barely even a cover . 
  it 's like a whole new song set to the same lyrics . 
  because sony has them, 
  the bible has authority . 
  whether your interpretation of it does is up for question, 
  the best thing for me is how the original ds games look on it . 
  you can buy flashcards ( like the supercard dstwo ) or play originals , either way the size makes such a massive difference to how you 're immersed in the game . 
  we do n't need a new word , they all point to atheism and so science and so antiamerikkka etc. 
  flying unassisted , without a doubt . 
  being able to be up in the clouds and then swoop under the water ... would just be incredible . 
  look i would ** love ** to just say that . 
  but this oppressive society to white , male , cisgender , middle class atheists means that i ca n't . 
  but which head , 
  it 's definitely worth it getting the new xl version . 
  it makes things much more immersive . 
  it sounds like you did n't have a ds . 
  that system has incredible games that could keep you busy for years . 
  and they 're all playable and look fantastic on the xl . 
  if you 're low on cash get a 3ds compatible flash cart and have hours of fun with pokemon , zelda and all the rest . 
  as for 3ds games , my favourites would be mario 3d land , kingdom hearts ddd , pushmo ( on the e shop ) and mario kart 7 . 
  it seems to be building up quite a solid library . 
  i do n't think there 's much difference in the search results . 
  it 's more the whole google interface you get . 
  you can easily check youtube , google docs , gmail etc. 
  i think bings image search is better though, 
  so one mans ** logic ** is another mans propoganda ? 
  stop making excuses sky-sheep, 
  i bought a samsung galaxy note off them for `` $ 800 . '', 
  what it really amounted to was $ 1000 . 
  since all their stock is in hong kong they ship it out and you have to pay 15 % ? 
  customs charges . 
  i assumed since they were a new zealand site that the stock was in the country , so do n't make the same mistake . 
  expansys i believe are the same , and their shipping costs are pricey . 
  my recommendation , just use whoevers cheapest on pricespy with decent reviews . 
  all the stock has to be in new zealand and wo n't include customs charges . 
  my sister bought a galaxy s3 a few months ago and got it much cheaper than mobicity would have charged when you add on the sneaky costs . 
  but what about sunny invercargill :( trust me op invercargill is where it 's at . 
  the culture , the weather , the sites . . its got it all !, 
  marlborough sounds , nelson/golden bay area . 
  top of the south island has stunning landscapes . 
  i 'm with you beanhacker . 
  we middle class , white atheists are so ** oppressed ** living in a first world country with little to no religious influence in our politics and no obligation to be religious . 
  why just the other day i walked into a church and they were praying , can you imagine that ? 
  nonetheless i shouted god is a lie and then the closet atheist pastor ripped off his robes to reveal a dawkins t shirt . 
  the congregation then realized what brainwashed idiots they were and whistled and cheered as i walked out . 
  i do n't think it was the religious people this time ... 
  them crazy japanese amirite ? 
  when i told my family i was atheist they locked me in the watercloset for 15 days . 
  i did n't have food , only drips of boiling water to sustain me . 
  they left me there hoping i would die . 
  when i told my pastor i was atheist he ripped the crucifix off the wall and beat me with it until i bled . 
  when i told my cat i was an atheist she peed all over me and then scratched apart my copy of the god delusion . 
  and they have the nerve to tell me i 'm not persecuted ? 
  ** fuck origin **, 
  yeah , fuck mutual respect and diversity . 
  feel free to xpost this to / r/atheism so our fellow scientists can see it, 
  upvote this piggybacking to make me a ~ ~ g0d ~ ~ mod, 
  1 - ds games do n't look as good on a 3ds but i hardly notice it .
