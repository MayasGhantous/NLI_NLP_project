  they 're fantastic to play on an xl, 
  2 - ` internet features ' - there 's online gameplay on a few games including mario kart 7 . 
  it comes with a web browser which is pretty average . 
  3 - i suppose over time the battery could go down a little but i do n't think it 's much to worry about, 
  - super mario 3d land, 
  - mario kart 7, 
  - kingdom hearts 3d, 
  - pushmo, 
  - theatrhythm final fantasy, 
  - zelda spirit tracks/phantom hourglass, 
  - elite beat agents, 
  - mario kart ds, 
  - cooking mama, 
  - pokemon platinum, 
  there 's actually a ton of good ds games so i recommend getting a flashcart ( supercard dstwo can play gba games as well as ds ) if you 're strapped for cash . 
  i highly recommend getting an xl instead of a regular 3ds as well , it 's well worth it . 
  really recommend super mario 64 ds if you never had a n64 . 
  play it on the xl and you 'll have lots of fun , it 's one of the better ds games . 
  op do n't bother with an ordinary 3ds . 
  i had one and upgraded . 
  the screens really do make all the difference . 
  is there a reason you 're adding a 's other than to make it rhyme ? 
  is this a speech pattern in the book or something ? 
  `` baby get down like the economy '' - lil `` byron '' wayne, 
  there is no need to be upset ** fascist pig !, 
                                                post on / v /, 
                                      someone does n't like me, 
                       where is le downvote ? 
  she started getting downvotes , can you believe it ? 
  ever since the `` funeral incident '' the neckbeards want nothing to do with her . 
  rome ? 
  an equally ~ ~ flawed ~ ~ ** logical ** post, 
  well science helped to create the bomb that destroyed it , therefore science is bad . 
  check and mate . 
  implying rubble is a good thing ? 
  you should learn some ** logic **, 
  there 's a million ways that science has been used against the human race . 
  the bombs and weapons people kill with were created by science . 
  the botched medical science of the past - lobotomies and fertility drugs with side effects . 
  due to the overwhelming ** bad ** science has done i suggest we eradicate it entirely . 
  tear down the labs of hatred !!, 
  well sure ... perhaps there are a couple of things science has done . 
  but look at all the bad stuff !, 
  a world without science is a world we want . 
  bad things science has done, 
  - dangerous weapons and bombs, 
  - botched medical practices, 
  - dangerous drugs like heroin and meth, 
  - high fructoce corn syrup and unhealthy food substances, 
  - engineered super viruses and diseases, 
  - factories and environmentally hazardous pollution, 
  - computer viruses and malware, 
  and you try and tell me science is a good thing ? 
  after all the bad its done ? 
  so remembering the people who died in hiroshima makes me a troll ? 
  have some respect . 
  and you 've been indoctrinated all your life to see science as a good thing , a positive force , that you do n't see its dark side . 
  if we get rid of science we can get rid of all these terrible things . 
  join in the alliance against science !!!, 
  it 's not too late to forsake its evils !!, 
  we 're talking about science here . 
  are you really that dense ? 
  yeah i 've heard all the arguments `` science has done this , science has done that '' but they all can never seem to be so pro science after listing all of its evils . 
  have you not heard of the wrongs that science has committed ? 
  i 've posted a list further up in the comments . 
  read that and then you 'll be looking at science in a different light . 
  no , you are . 
  if you 're defending a field of knowledge that has lead to the deaths of millions of people then you are asking for a mass death of people . 
  i 'm just trying to stop the science . 
  of course you would want to label those who think differently to you . 
  how very rational . 
  at least you 're acknowledging that it 's wrong . 
  that 's the first step . 
  look if you are going to be blind and not acknowledge the evils of science then i ca n't stop you . 
  but you should realize that by supporting science you are literally supporting lobotomies , hitler and civil wars . 
  that 's something i do n't want to be a part of . 
  spoils ? 
  more like spoilt goods . 
  i would run off to the sea but it 's been polluted by science as has the wind and air . 
  see [ this ] ( http://www.traveltoenlightenment.com/tibet_images/chengdu_sun_big.jpg ) it 's a photo of the sun in china . 
  you can barely even see the sun thanks to science 's toxic pollution . 
  excuse me ? 
  science is the reason these people are doing it end of story . 
  sure they 're idiots but only because they 're scientists . 
  anyone trying to separate science and scientists is deluded . 
  it 's the moderate scientists that are the worst . 
  those that try and help the environment after polluting it . 
  shame on them and shame on science . 
  thanks for upvoting it . 
  i want to see this on the front page . 
  i 'm glad someone understands, 
  this is genius . 
  i 'm pretty sure this is going to be a viral hit . 
  chicken is the bird of satan . 
  the lord uses doves , are you a noah denier or just possessed ? 
  juliebeen posted a story about her wearing a subhumans t shirt at her supposedly atheist fathers funeral . 
  she was n't happy that they were holding a christian funeral service so she stood up and said `` god is a lie sheeple '' - that 's a paraphrase but you get the idea . 
  it was heavily downvoted after being linked on srd and magicskyfairy and shortly afterwards she lost her position as mod . 
  i found the longest journey to have one of the most captivating stories i 've ever played through . 
  even though the graphics are dated the pace and world is so original and brilliant that you want to keep on going .
