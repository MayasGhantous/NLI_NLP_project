  if you 're extroverted and want a fast paced city that is . 
  ok guys , despite being a 15 year old i 'm pretty sure i know how to fix america . 
  let 's get gaben to run for president and neil degrasse tyson for vp . 
  we 'll spend the entire federal budget on nasa and live on moon colonies playing indie games all day . 
  the solution to america 's problems is the indie moon colony . 
  anyone with me ? 
  anyone got the time to rewrite the raven to fit modern atheism ? 
  holy shit , this has to be the most sensationalized title ever posted to / r/atheism . 
  no way this is real ... 
  and it 's real . 
  did you say you 're swedish ? 
  take me with you to ~ ~ parentless ~ ~ godless paradise !!, 
  i thought that was called ` apostolate ', 
  hey , i 'm up for my note to get a serving of key lime pie, 
  great job man , you were calm and reasonable while the fundie could barely even speak english . 
  you got my upvote . 
  fuck you ea shill !, 
  origin is literally hitler111 !!!, 
  i do n't know think there 's much holding people back unless they use multimedia stuff or are gamers . 
  not good enough . 
  you need to move to europe ... california only gets you a couple of upvotes . 
  ** burn fundies once or twice , living in a godless paradise . 
  i read dawkins and make them cry , living in a godless paradise !, 
  i get the whole `` we can do it better '' attitude apple has , it has made them do wonderful things in the past - but really , you ca n't outdo google maps . 
  they 've had years of experience on them and street view as well , it just seems such a stupid move . 
  it might benefit them financially but it 's going to hurt the users . 
  nobody is going to pay $ 40 for an android game . 
  does that answer your question ? 
  it 's so annoying , i asked about it a few months ago as well . 
  i think we need to petition nintendo for it to be a paid download . 
  this is worsethan the olympic mascots . 
  it 's probably the worst mascot i 've ever seen . 
  `` the national health service '' - mitt romney, 
  it 's pretty much agreed upon as the best game on the vita . 
  you should buy it . 
  disuss !, 
  fuck god !!, 
  science is the shit !!, 
  ** na uh **, 
  that 's really brave of you to stand up to your fundie dad . 
  care to post a rage comic ? 
  my highly evolved mind ca n't read more than two sentences without losing attention . 
  - new york times, 
  excuse me ? 
  being a scientist means nothing now ? 
  you 're going to have to try harder with the propoganda fundie , cos i aint buying it . 
  i love that piano music on carlsagan.com . 
  it reminds me i am the universe experiencing myself . 
  it does n't matter what one you start with . 
  a lot of people were introduced to the series through 7 , and it has a fun story , but it ultimately does n't really matter . 
  i+ii have pretty average gameplay though . 
  you should start a kickstarter to get your glasses repaired . 
  put something about being bullied for being atheist and you 'll get a couple of grand, 
  ** it 's because we 're right !!!, 
  that was figurative man !, 
  not really . 
  they certainly made a dent in the industry but certainly have n't `` destroyed '' it . 
  recently i upgraded from a ds lite to a 3ds xl as there are some really great games on the platform ( super mario 3d land , mario kart 7 , kingdom hearts 3d ) . 
  these are all console quality games with hours of playtime . 
  i can also play any ds game i like through a flash cart . 
  i also own a high end android phone - the galaxy note . 
  there are definitely some fun games on android - i like temple run , game dev story etc , but these are just temporary gaming fixes . 
  most of the time i 'm actually playing games via gameboid - a gba emulator on my phone . 
  no games on the android market have the level of gameplay these games offer , or the level of gameplay that a 3ds game offers . 
  one other issue to consider op is that handhelds are mostly designed for children . 
  many parents wo n't want their kids to have an iphone so they 'll buy them a handheld instead . 
  if not they might get an ipod touch . 
  they know that there are n't many violent games on nintendo systems so they 're confident that they 'll be safe when playing these , unlike perhaps the games that can be gotten instantly on android/ios that can be targeted for adults . 
  fucking facebook fundies . 
  i was f5 ` ing my newsfeed waiting for my crush derpina to comment , when out of the blue popped my fundie cousins status that read `` having a great day so far . 
  thank god the weather 's come out for me '', 
  this was ** oppression ** of the highest order . 
  i shadow pasted all the dawkins , hitchens and harris quotes i had in science.docx and messaged him 20 times . 
  he responded back with `` ok man , you 've made your point . 
  can you stop messaging me . '', 
  i was infuriated and replied `` oh so only christians have free speech in america now ? 
  you 're a brainwashed fundie who deserves to die ! '', 
  obviously he was put off by my rock hard intellect bulging out on the keyboard and defriended me . 
  i 'm finding it hard to cope now since all my `` friends '' have done the same ... there 's nobody left to argue with but my mum . 
  he 's a real logic man, 
  sitting in his mothers minivan, 
  calling out his fundie friends on the internet ... ( dun , dun , dun , dun ), 
  ( paul ), 
  does n't have an attitude, 
  it 's just his , high iq, 
  logic man , he knows he 's better than the rest of them, 
  logic man , are you winning, 
  fighting religion since the beginning, 
  logic man , spend your day on the internet, 
  he 's a real logic man ,, 
  sitting in his mothers minivan, 
  spends his time owning fundies on the internet, 
  spends his tiiime , owning fundies on the internet !!!, 
  ( scientist ), 
  / ooc is your name from the song ? 
  how can you upvote this shit ?!, 
  every single time i visit the front page gets worse and worse . 
  i get that there 's memes that are immature , i get that there 's the us vs them attitude that prevails here , i get that there 's the notion that all religious people are automatically idiots ... but this is the worst fucking strawman you 've ever made . 
  atheism is the happy children ... what the fuck ? 
  what do happy children have to do with atheism ???
