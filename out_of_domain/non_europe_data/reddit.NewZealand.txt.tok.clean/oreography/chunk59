  it makes me proud that there are people standing up for atheism . 
  soon i believe , religious influence will be destroyed in america . 
  with the internet and boards like [ 2 ] [ 2 ] / r/atheism we are a far greater force than we realize, 
  maybe just me but i thought kingdom hearts 3d was great, 
  india during the victorian era would be fantastic . 
  maybe a uncharted/tomb raider style explorer game but with a colonial explorer . 
  actually africa during the victorian era would also be fantastic , and sailing the pacific during captain cooks era . 
  you 've got a whole series here !, 
  psp games are usually round the 500mb to 1 gig mark, 
  just get a sign saying `` on lunch break '' and they 'll get the picture, 
  it does but people obviously do n't like your opinion ... anyways i bought a 3ds xl this year and still find some use for it , but since it is a big console unless i 'm going on a trip it stays at home . 
  i use my android for gaming as well but most games i 'm playing are on a gba emulator . 
  i find that smartphone games just are n't that engrossing , unless it 's the $ 10 ones like gta3 on ff3 , and then they 're always console ports . 
  i wish my smug look was as apathetic as that . 
  on the plus side has been does n't even neckbeard which means my logic is stronger . 
  strong then kill brother . 
  have you considered street preaching the word of sagan for money ? 
  all you need is a cardboard sign and the god delusion . 
  it is now http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/12lrch/usain_bolt_knows_whats_up/, 
  no fwends !, 
  reddit is le best board !!, 
  i really hope you guys support him . 
  it 's so hard being an atheist nowdays and with celebrities like him we can really make a difference !, 
  please do n't go into this , he 's had arguments from lots of people already . 
  we have an atheist mod as well ... both namer and that mod effectively moderate the sub and that 's all that is required . 
  so long as they remain mostly impartial i do n't see what the issue is . 
  one point i want to add is that the law only applied to jews . 
  so even if the law was current today none of us gentiles would be expected to follow it, 
  link to thread ? 
  the topic was about your preferred windows phone . 
  i 've got an android phone and like it , but do n't come in here with mock outrage when your point is irrelevant to the discussion, 
  why can we not edit it ? 
  where is le freedom of speech ?? 
  i think majoras mask is always the consensus online ... generally followed by wind waker and a link to the past, 
  i 'm with you on twilight princess , i think i actually prefer it over wind waker and oot . 
  so long as it 's the gamecube version and not the wii with its awful controls, 
  most likely crash team racing . 
  still incredible fun to this day, 
  i 've got an old veggietales vhs i 'm offering, 
  thank the lord that this righteousness is spreading to the liberals on youtube, 
  i think the only reason i 'm laughing is because he 's getting downvotes . 
  he 's deliberately doing it to piss reddit off and they 're obliging him with downvotes . 
  if he did n't receive any reaction it would n't be funny at all, 
  ~ ~ wrong paul ~ ~ no , ron paul ahahahaha, 
  ca n't we fellow scientists just get along ? 
  it 's reliegion that drives us apart . 
  make science not downvotes !, 
  that would make much more sense than them finding out about the bomb ... my first reaction . 
  reddit , youtube , facebook , bible , pandora , netflix ( not hulu - but soon since there 's an 8 rt app ) , tunein , my fitness pal and pulse are all available . 
  do n't know about your bank though ... most likely just the mobile site at the moment, 
  i see others have replied but mine is most accurate . 
  just be aware that the youtube one is n't official but it 's just as good,

  lukedeezee is unrightous so pick me feminine mother woman !, 
  have you read proverbs ? 
  because we 're going to have some godly relationship oh boy !, 
  it has everything to do with everything . 
  bravery is what sustains us - the food from sagan that allows our neckbeards to flourish in the dim light of our basements . 
  `` for you have not known me if you were not brave . 
  for i was brave for you since the very first day '' - proverb of hitchens : book of science, 
  ooc this is a satirical subreddit parodying / r/atheism . 
  bravery is used in an ironic way - so whenever some 15 year old is attacking his aunt for believing in god we say it 's brave or so brave . 
  there 's a lot of terminology used but the main purpose is to mock / r/atheism for their immature attacks on religion . 
  we do n't mock atheism itself as half of us are atheists anyways , just their way of criticising religion .

  when does le narwhal bacon ? 
  are we all still coming back to this thread ? 
  in case you have n't noticed people are n't exactly in the right frame of mind when they kill themselves . 
  those that are going through depression can do this kind of thing spontaneously - not everyone plans their death meticulously, 
  could we not have a mod trinity ?

  piss off fundie, 
  so i was standing in a rather large line at my local polling booth today behind a couple families that i know from when i went to church with my family in year younger . 
  it was the only voting line open so there was n't much of another option to wait to vote for ron paul . 
  i was wondering why the line was going nowhere when i decided to poke my head up front to see what the holdup was . 
  it was a little old lady who did n't have a pen for voting and she was trying to talk the fascist poll booth people into borrowing theirs . 
  this struck me as odd until i found out that the fascist poll booth watchers were all rethuglicans . 
  now all these families were just staring and there was even two making fun of her . 
  i walked up and handed my voting paper to the poll booth watcher , then handem him a bic and told him to give it to the little old lady . 
  one of the middle aged women ( i knew these people , so i also knew that they all make over 6 digits ) grabbed her kid and yelled very loudly , `` see that man ? 
  he 's acting just like mitt romney wants us to . '', 
  for some reason this set me off , so i turned around . 
  i have n't shaved in awhile so i 'm rocking some nice scruff , a slayer shirt , and gym shorts , so it must have been a nice sight . 
  very loudly , i said `` like mitt romney ? 
  ma'am i 'm a ron paul supporter who makes minimum wage and i was the one who stepped up to help her ? 
  your hypocritical neoconservatism is an inspiration to us all . '', 
  as i stormed out , a couple of the poll booth boys started to whistle and cheer , soon voters joined in and even the president . 
  i gave a wave and went off with a feeling of accomplishment .
