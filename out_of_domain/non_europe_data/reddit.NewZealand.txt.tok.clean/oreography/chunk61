  there 's tons more but i do n't think it 's too hard to name 32 languages, 
  edit : okay guys i 'm sorry i missed your languages out . 
  yes i should have put polish and danish they seem pretty obvious choices in hindsight . 
  i was just trying to list over 32, 
  well i ca n't speak for a fundie like you but i upvoted it with my educated mind ... 
  [ this should go in / r/cringe . 
  it 's the internet equivalent of laughing at your own joke in public . 
  i think this is sufficient evidence that there is n't an ounce of credibility left on that sub and that it should n't be a default . ], 
  maybe this will lead to the written equivalent of faces of atheism . 
  writing your own quotes and then posting a circlejerk esque comment agreeing with yourself . 
  it 's fucking beyond parody ... oh and i almost forgot . 
  screencap them and let / r/atheism upvote them . 
  we could n't have a text post no , everyone will be submitting their own captioned text and ~ ~ jerking ~ ~ upvoting themselves, 
  this is what i believed as well . 
  the central government considers cantonese and shanghainese a dailect whereas a native mandarin speaker could n't understand most of what is said . 
  not really an issue since everyone speaks mandarin and their local dialect in china as well . 
  also in hong kong they use traditional chinese characters for cantonese whereas the rest of china uses the simplistic modern ones . 
  haha so i did ... and latin as well . 
  dae no god ? 
  yes god is a lie !!!, 
  omg , i ca n't believe ur an atheist too :3, 
  now i am a post-chrstian buddhist atheist so you need to hear my story . 
  the ressurection is actually a dream . 
  jesus fell asleep in the garden well praying and dreamed that all the terrible things happened to him . 
  when he told the disciples they just wanted to cash in on the story and wrote four corresponding versions of the dream ( you know , cause it was a cool dream ) anyways that 's why i do n't believe in the ressurection . 
  did you make it out alive of that illogical den of lies ? 
  sagan knows i 'm not brave enough to venture in there . 
  even on facebook i can smell the fundies stench when teaching the message of sagan . 
  why would they pray for an atheist ? 
  check and mate skygoose . 
  ** repent sinner for the hour is near **, 
  one fronthug could n't hurt ? 
  sure and one bit of marijuana could n't hurt , one bit of homosexuality could n't hurt , one bit of liberal theology could n't hurt , and one holocaust could n't hurt right ? 
  if you value your life autsin , then stay away from the sin trap . 
  it will lead you to a path of suffering , temptation and unholiness . 
  i think your complaint is ridiculous . 
  provided origin are still providing you access to your dlc they have n't `` stolen '' it . 
  it 's your decision not to use the medium that they provide their games by . 
  ** atheists rule the internet !, 
  i 'm the king of the castle you 're a dirty rascal hahahaha !!!, 
  what filth . 
  mine even said he wanted to kiss a girl !, 
  can you believe it ? 
  i 'm absolutely for contraception as it keeps abortion rates down . 
  i think it should be mandatory unless you 're actively trying to have children . 
  do you have to pay for your games on origin ? 
  because it 's likely you do n't and so your analogy fails . 
  i mean it 's fine if you do n't want to use origin , i prefer having games on steam too ... but if i did buy content from the ea store i wanted to play and had to download extra software to play it with , i would n't say they had stolen my games, 
  science = le atheism !, 
  why do n't my parents get this ? 
  le atheist used roman numerals as well to signify he was cultured . 
  literally did n't learn it from final fantasy or star wars at all, 
  since christianity is a established religion in egypt via the coptic church would it be easier to convert to christianity than it would to come out as an atheist ? 
  the coptic church seems very orthodox but would it be easier to fake being an atheist in that environment than it would in islam ? 
  it strikes me op that you 're wanting to blame your problems on religion when it 's a scape goat for your insecurities . 
  women do n't want to date a needy guy . 
  if you are n't happy with the way you are then no women is going to be attracted to that . 
  and even if you do find a girlfriend , it 's not necessarily automatically going to make you happy if you 're not happy with yourself . 
  i do see where you 're coming from though . 
  of course church is a good environment for meeting people and the community factor makes it easier to form relationships but there 's plenty of other places where you can find love . 
  join local interest groups , go to bars/pubs , find friends through your current friends . 
  there are plenty of atheists or agnostics out there if you go looking for them . 
  well sorry to burst your bubble but steam does the exact same thing http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/07/valve-to-steam-users-no-class-action-suits/ . 
  whatever games you bought on steam before are subject to this change as well, 
  i think it 's a bad idea but there was a similar thread a while ago where people listed their ten favourite games and gave a decent explanation as to why . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/tke8j/your_top_10_games_of_all_time_and_why/ the board is about discussion and i think simply creating a `` best '' games list is pointless if you do n't give a decent explanation as to why you feel that way . 
  but there are countless top games lists already and i do n't believe we need another one, 
  `` righteous records '' , property of / r/sidehugs in have offered these guys a record deal , so they can continue spreading biblical ** truth **, 
  [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/12w530/whenever_i_learn_that_a_celebrity_is_atheist_i/c6zfqst?context=3 ) was the comment that got me banned ? 
  for calling out the sagandamn circlejerkers ? 
  i 'm not going `` apeshit '' but i think your reasoning that origin `` stole ' your games is pathetic . 
  it 's not `` tantamount to theft '' when they give you exactly the same damn game but force you to use their software . 
  they changed their subscriber agreement like every other major software company does every month or two . 
  my point is that i 'm almost certain that continue to use steam to play your games , when they have the exact same clause in their terms and conditions that stops you from using origin . 
  as i said before it 's fine to not use origin but it 's faulty logic and plain hypocritical of you to say they `` stole '' your games when they did n't . 
  especially if he does n't have a wii already, 
  i 'd like to see rim turn around but i think windows phone being the third player has destroyed its chance . 
  with wp8 windows is increasing their marketshare to become the third player in the mobile space . 
  if rim thought to do bb10 2 years ago they would still have a good chance , but unless bb10 seriously wows and they push with everything they 've got i do n't think they stand much of a chance . 
  was there any doubt ? 
  his bravery stretches across the cosmos destroying ignorance with the light of science, 
  there was a parody of this by ` nukelepope ' entitled ` nuking it up with atheists in pyongyang ' but sadly it was deleted before i got the chance to see it, 
  the details are spectacularly uninteresting . 
  here 's a rough summary of what i did :, 
  used unrestrained language ( well , like you sometimes see here ) in addressing people over there ;, 
  wrote massive diatribes aimed directly at the mods detailing why i despise them ;, 
  cross-linked from [ 1 ] / r/atheism on multiple occasions ;, 
  wrote many trollish posts and comments ;, 
  dared the mods to ban me ;, 
  insulted the mods some more , particularly outsider ;, 
  finally managed to goad him to ban me . 
  near the end i found myself wondering if they ever would , given that they had banned other people for much less .
