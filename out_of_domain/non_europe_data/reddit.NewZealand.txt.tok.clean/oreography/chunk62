  but eventually i found my ass out of there . 
  spent a couple of months dodging rapid shadow deletes while doing some more trolling as douchethepope . 
  but that ended up getting annoying so i dropped out of that scene and have been `` living '' almost exclusively in [ 2 ] / r/atheism . 
  what have you got against sundays ? 
  do n't you know the lords holy day in sunday , it 's right there in the bible !!, 
  lik dis if u cry eveytim, 
  ** the revolution will be secularised !!, 
  sounds like you had a bad experience . 
  i had no problems when using them but from what you said , that 's just not on, 
  god predestined the ** elect ** to fit in the 144,000 spaces of heaven . 
  it 's sinful and unholy to even attempt to receive salvation when we all deserve hell . 
  the ** lord ** shall judge us and decide our fate . 
  so i was standing in line at my local poke mart with some trainers i knew when i was younger ... 
  from what i 've read the first part of the josephus quote is considered genuine but the latter part shows obvious signs of being tampered with . 
  why would you ask for something that does n't exist ? 
  ~ ~ seconds ~ ~ we call them secularons , minulogics and reasonhours round here fundie, 
  i 'm sure that will flourish in the enterprise, 
  `` open office '', 
  `` i 'm sorry we do n't support open source software . 
  have you tried opening microsoft office instead ? '', 
  `` open microsoft office '', 
  `` microsoft office will not go open source . 
  have you tried launching microsoft office instead ? '', 
  nice generalization there . 
  yes every single christian ever believes god condemns people to damnation ... 
  wpc 's would have made it easier, 
  there is also the advantage in ies integration with active directory as well . 
  i 'm sure it 's implementatble on other browsers but it 's easiest on ie . 
  also it not updating constantly is probably an advantage for businesses - but a nightmare for web devs as was visible with ie6, 
  the problem is that microsoft still insists on doing things there way in terms of standards . 
  they 've made massive improvements ( and lets not forget ie6 was incredibly advanced when it first came out ) but they 're still have the only proprietory browser standards . 
  stop you launching non company approved applications ? 
  pretty easy to implement . 
  people are likely downvoting because you 're complaining about it, 
  i 'd really recommend pandora then or spotify . 
  in pandora you just enter an artist you like and it will play a station with similar artists . 
  in spotify you can listen to radio in genres you like and discover new songs . 
  our prophet is a wise one, 
  i 'd rather be buddhist than in the christstapo, 
  burnout paradise is n't bad but i did n't like the open world theme so much . 
  the older ones for ps2 are much better though, 
  an ancient roman assassins creed would be fantastic , since there really are n't that many games that have touched on that setting . 
  he 's a vehement defender of / r/atheism and runs / r/antiatheismwatch which points out the `` anti atheist agenda '' on reddit . 
  he 's also well known for hating `` circlejerkers '' on magicskyfairy and braveryjerk because they make fun of his beloved / r/atheism when it does stupid shit . 
  nokia own navteq one of the biggest map makers on earth . 
  it 's not open street map data at all, 
  how do i know nokia own naqteq ? 
  from here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/navteq . 
  nokia do n't use open street maps because they have an entire company working on their mapping software . 
  though obviously their moldovan maps are n't so good, 
  no `` pretty much everything '' is not a circlejerk , pretty much every default sub i agree . 
  the reason is that / r/atheism is the worst default sub and is such an echochamber that it 's an easy target . 
  / r/politics and / r/gaming also get their fair share or criticism , but there 's no way you can excuse the mindless content on / r/atheism, 
  [ one of the posters on the mothership said it quite well . 
  `` totally . 
  i 'm an atheist , but i 'd someone said that to my mom i would loose it . 
  i would beat the crap out of him , then laugh an say `` it 's ok your just a bunch of cells . '', 
  that poor woman . '', 
  it 's obvious that the `` superiority '' people like the facebook poster get from being a ratheist means they lack any form of empathy . 
  it 's salt man ... it 's just pure sex . 
  while your theory may have some accuracy to it it does n't discount religion at all . 
  if you were born in norway or china you would be more likely to be atheist statistically - does that mean atheism is flawed ? 
  likewise if you 're born in the south of the us , brazil , poland or nigeria then you 're likely to be christian . 
  dawkins and other atheists have used this geographical `` argument '' before without even looking at their own ideology . 
  that 's incredibly devastating . 
  i 'll keep both of them in my thoughts and prayers . 
  i 'm picking up a theme here but i ca n't quite detect it ... 
  i agree , i did n't think this was overly pandering to the hivemind . 
  i mean he was still a christian at the end of it all and did n't see le light of reason aka atheism . 
  i 'd be too insecure to wear one . 
  just walking round with that stupid smug stick figure saying `` like a boss '' in all caps would be too much to take . 
  i 'm sorry but nobody likes republicans . 
  even in new zealand we 're still pro constitutional monarchy and we 've got crowds turning out for charles and camillas visit at the moment . 
  the royals actually earn more for the uk than they take and it would be an awful loss for britain and the commonwealth for them to go . 
  if their policies benefited my country sure ... same as voting for a christian , muslim or anyone else . 
  you vote for a politician and what they can do , not the ideology they hold to, 
  no i 'm not comparing atheism to a religion - i 'm showing how his geographic argument is flawed . 
  it 's nice to know that most atheists you know were raised religious because let me guess - you 're from the us or an environment where atheism is n't a very popular ideology . 
  whereas in china and norway as i quoted atheism is the most common ideology - in fact in china it 's even state sanctioned . 
  religion is not encouraged and is seen as primitive and superstitious . 
  people will raise their children to be atheist and if their children ask them about religion , will tell them that it 's all nonsense . 
  i 'm sure most people are n't `` militantly atheist '' as you put it , but do you have to be a militant atheist to raise your children with the same beliefs or same lack of beliefs ? 
  i do n't think so at all . 
  where is dtox in our hour of need ? 
  though he may have been mod for our entire existence we shall deny mod - for he has denied us of our right to sidehug . 
  all shall pray to the new mod - oreography , lord of the sidehugs . 
  throw away your ties to the old mod . 
  a new mod shall rise in the land of reddit !!, 
  i 'm sorry about suggesting norway - i was under the impression that atheism had higher demographics . 
  i know that many people in european countries are baptised and officially are still considered `` christians ' by remaining in their state church without ever attending it . 
  we 'll have to disagree that to raise your children as atheist you would have to remove all religious influence . 
  to raise your children christian you do n't have to remove other religious influences - it 's merely that christianity is the dominant and favoured influence . 
  it would be the same for raising children atheists - you can teach your children about religion but have atheism as the dominant and favoured influence . 
  i think you really are confusing militant atheist parents with normal atheist parents . 
  favouring one ideology over another is n't `` militant '' it 's natural as you want to instill what you believe into your children . 
  yeah i second the recommendation to give it another go - it 's a fantastic fps . 
  you might also like tribes ascend which is free as well . 
  $ 140 is beyond ridiculous for a non special edition title - i thought $ 120 was the absolute max eb charged . 
  then again i have n't bought a title from them in a long long time, 
  i 'm with you as well .
