  give us the goss on your husband . 
  true christians need to speak out about others sins . . it 's what jesus commanded us to do . 
  one can not backhug and call it `` love '' i 'm afraid . 
  you 'll have to take it up with jesus, 
  i guess gay relationships are more egalitarian . 
  it 's something i had n't really thought about , but the `` traditional '' relationship roles and expectations are shattered . 
  esv is the standard recommendation round here . 
  also it 's available as app for free on all phones and tablets , which is a plus .

  we 've got some really fantastic content and insightful discussions, 
  `` if only i gave a subsidy to mountain dew i would 've got the job !, 
  look at that freak , he 's got a 2 litre in one hand and a camera in the other . '', 
  it 's to do with the view that atheism also equals intelligence , scientific thought , and rational discussion that new atheism promotes , painting all religious people as strawman bible thumpers and all atheists as having the former attributes . 
  therefore anyone who shows intelligence and is a reasonable person must be in the same group as me ... 
  otherwise my ideology wo n't feel validated :(, 
  for fucks sake ... 
  ## new year ? 
  based on some fundie calendar ? 
  i do n't think so concern troll !!!, 
  it 's not a problem when it 's true !, 
  literally all russian peasants working 19 hour days worshipped sta [ le ] n. read a book fundies , it 's literally just religion . 
  videos gone now as well, 
  `` i do n't get why people ca n't be normal and have to focus on the gay love aspect . 
  if it was shelly and david , no one would say a thing and just focus on the storyline but no , people have to bring up the homosexuals falling in love like its so bad . 
  god , i hate christians . 
  there 's nothing wrong with homosexuality , just because a false book written by cave people in ancient times says homosexualty is bad , you do n't have to believe it . 
  99 % of the things said in that book is proved false . 
  there 's no fucking god , no fucking heaven . 
  get over yourself . '',

  `` kim dotcom and the bandits of hollywood '', 
  jidf confirmed, 
  until we invaded the thread recently it was getting upvotes . 
  and it was part of that `` gay alabaman '' story and the ratheists lapped it up . 
  that reeks of bullshit . 
  i 've heard eugenics arguments from then but `` every word of the god delusion '' is pure hyperbole . 
  if you had to be a cannibal you would n't have butter in the pan . 
  you 'd be alone in the wilderness and your `` meal '' would either be dead or in the most disgusting condition imaginable . 
  the skin might be gangerous or be swolen all other . 
  believe me , unless you 're some psycopath who cooks people in their oven , your cannibal experience is not going to be good . 
  it 's pretty pathetic when people have to mention they 're not homophobic before saying they would n't be gay . 
  it 's called gay sex for a reason , you 're not expected to do it if you 're not gay !, 
  hey shitlords , you forgot legosexual !, 
  being sexually attracted to colourful plastic pieces designed in denmark . 
  i just made it up but it 's a legimitate sexual orientation !, 
  must suck in kentucky . . 
  neither is `` you can be an atheist '' explicitly mentioned , however you 're free to choose to believe or not to believe . 
  even though freedom of religion is not mentioned explicitly , it 's exactly what the constitution provides . 
  stop oppressing me !!!, 
  an atheist in atheism for not being atheist ? 
  how america is atheisting atheists . 
  i do n't think you quite understand the concept of `` cherrypicking '' in the old testament . 
  the laws were jewish laws applying only to jews . 
  if you 're a gentile/non jew not following the law then that is expected . 
  even putting aside the `` new covenant '' the concept that christians are cherry picking from the law is ridiculous if you 're not a jew . 
  i 'm sorry but i do n't follow your logic . 
  any group even before the time of christ that was n't jews were excluded from the law . 
  they were jewish laws , not applying to anyone else . 
  christianity was essentially a jewish religion in the brief period before pauls writings and then the church opened allowed gentiles . 
  you know much as i think the slipperly slope argument is flawed , reddit calling for bestiality to be legalized the other day seems to give it some credence . 
  your username is something special . . 
  in leviticus laws were prephrased with `` to the children of israel '' e.g the jewish tribe before being dictated, 
  `` speak unto the children of israel , and say unto them ... '' lev 1:2, 
  `` speak unto the children of israel , saying ... '' lev 4:2, 
  `` speak unto the children of israel , saying ... '' lev 11:2, 
  `` speak unto the children of israel , saying ... '' lev 12:2, 
  `` speak unto the children of israel , and say unto them ... '' lev 15:2, 
  the only `` jewish law '' that theologians see as valid to gentiles were the noahide laws , which are pretty succinct, 
  prohibition of idolatry, 
  prohibition of murder, 
  prohibition of theft, 
  prohibition of sexual immorality, 
  prohibition of blasphemy, 
  prohibition of eating flesh taken from an animal while it is still alive, 
  establishment of courts of law, 
  the jewish laws are seen as valid still today for jews however . 
  `` i tell you the truth , until heaven and earth disappear , not the smallest letter , not the least stroke of a pen , will by any means disappear from the law until everything is accomplished . 
  - matt 5:18 . 
  this is a common verse atheists quote when claiming christians are `` cherry picking '' but they do n't understand the context . 
  the law still does apply but it was never written for gentiles , it was written for the `` children of israel '' . 
  now under the new covenant there is a way all gentiles and jews can be saved , with nobody needing to follow the laws . 
  there 's some interesting reading here http://www.gaychristian101.com/leviticus.html, 
  that last article sums it up more succinctly than i can . 
  `` in judaism , the `` first five books '' are referred to as the torah , in hebrew : \u05ea\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8\u05b8\u05d4 , [ 2 ] and generally translated as `` the law '' in english translations of the bible . 
  rabbinic judaism [ 3 ] asserts that the laws of the jewish bible were presented to the jewish people and converts to judaism ( which includes the biblical proselytes ) and do not apply to gentiles , including christians , with the notable exception of the seven laws of noah which apply to all people '', 
  any of them ? 
  i 've googled but it seems they 're either one or the other . 
  man you 've got to love 4chan sometimes . 
  ridiculous that these issues are even up for debate !,

  the golden age of islam died with the siege of baghdad sadly and led to the end of any major intellectual contributions from the muslim world . 
  you can do that still , you can even have the metro apps running side by side with an x86 one as well . 
  you do n't make any sense ...

  well we could all donate $ 100 german made stieff teddy bears but it costs a lot more and fewer children would get them . 
  i agree that toys have declined in quality but it 's inevitable from the endless demand of our consumer culture, 
  it 's an atheist troll .
