  downvote and move on, 
  finally someone gets it !, 
  children are delicate creatures and questioning the bible could lead them down a dangerous path . 
  i 'm certain that if we close them to all outside influences it will lead them on the path of righteousness and help them develop and healthy , obedient minds,

  i certainly have n't but i do know that the magi are considered by historians to have been zoroastrians . 
  the zoroastrians were astronomers and followed the star because they wanted to document it . 
  i still think this is the bravest post i 've ever seen on the mothership . 
  i cried pure tears of reason on that wonderful day . 
  carl sagan arose from the dead and cartboys whistled and cheered as i arose to godless heaven with a feeling of accomplishment .

  perhaps she had a bad reaction to it and tried it before ? 
  she answered the damn question and yet people keep on pestering her to become a marijuana apologist . 
  marijuana is n't for everyone , some people like it some people do n't . 
  well , at least the intent is good ... 
  well obviously a pastor would say that ... 
  i definitely agree the bible 's the most influential book of all time though . 
  i 'd say the printing press would be the most `` idea shaping tool '' however, 
  the best one was the one so blatantly doing it for karma . 
  he edited his post after 1000 upvotes or so saying he made it up because self posts do n't get link karma . 
  upvoting for karma . 
  the problem is that the straw man fundamentalist = all religious people is too easy to bash . 
  how hard is it to refute yec 's ? 
  pretty damn easy . 
  but when you have apologists and other moderate religious people ( e.g inventer of the big bang theory , head of the human genome project ) that believe in evolution and scientific theories , whilst also being religious it 's much harder to simply dismiss them as you need solid philisophical arguments . 
  this is where dawkins fails . 
  he can easily dismiss those who disbelieve in evolution simply because it 's got plenty of scientific backing , but when he comes against a religious moderate he uses the `` magical man in the sky '' argument and very rough philosophy . 
  tl ; dr he tries to paint rational religious people as delusional with simple arguments , when it only works with fundamentalists . 
  i think most people would believe bertrand russell was a great atheist philosopher for one . 
  also antony flew who created the no true scotsman fallacy . 
  i 'm sorry you 're getting downvoted but your argument is pretty awful . 
  `` singing kumbaya is forbidden in a theocracy , anyway '' - you realize this is a christian song right ? 
  pure poetry . 
  i can see this as the next 14 year old atheists rock hit .

  had to church the other day, 
  mum oppressed me in so many ways, 
  i could n't play halo 4, 
  atheism is the greatest thing, 
  it makes me seem like the smartest guy, 
  i 'll repeat the words of dawkins till the day i die, 
  chorus, 
  religion is bad, 
  i am 14, 
  fuck you mum and dad, 
  religion is bad,

  what causes the wars ( religion ), 
  what gives us the bores ( religion ), 
  what is worst than the holocaust ( religion ), 
  its baaaaaaaaad,

  fuck you mum and dad,

  but how can i feel oppressed if i 'm accepted ? 
  checkmate cis scum, 
  more like / r/politics . 
  libertarians and conservatives have more of an overlap than democrats . 
  when does the bullshit extend to the animal kingdom though ? 
  there 's going to be an overlap between the overkins and real animals soon . 
  they 'll want to start `` meowing '' to their cats pretending to communicate to them . 
  '' currently questioning my ethnicity . '', 
  oh god no ... this is awful . 
  i wish someone would tell these `` opressed '' nutters just how priveleged they are . 
  they 're all likely to be middle class , white , have reasonably stable finances , constant internet acces and have all the decent western commodities . 
  it 's so damn hyprocritical they even use the word privilege . 
  the thing is they only focus on gender + body issues , and not the economic and most important reasons in the 21st century why someone would legitimately be considered privileged . 
  if you have internet access , a comfortable house and enough access to food to make you `` trans fat gender '' then you 're priveleged . 
  diamonds can only be afforded by upper class cis scum !, 
  it 's the circle of privelege, 
  i disagree . 
  i think geishas suit it . 
  what about the flies ? 
  do you know there is a genocide going on against the humble fly . 
  why is it socially acceptable to kill such magestic creatures ? 
  i think most people are for appreciating the cultural differences and experiences unless they flat out suck . 
  internet censorship is one of those things . 
  do n't fret brother . 
  one day nukethepope will stage a coup against the fascists mods . 
  he 'll post jesus fucking a goat in / r/christianity and when he 's told by the gestapo to leave , will plea for his soldiers of reason to rise up !,
