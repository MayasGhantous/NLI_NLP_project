  there will be a great battle where ratheists fight against all religious subs , posting crude pictures of religious bestiality and smug quotes with their faces on them . 
  it will be on that sad day that the overlords of reddit , the admins will destroy the mothership and all remnants of its existance shall be washed away . 
  are you serious ? 
  / r/atheism for the rights of all humans ? 
  that place is probably the most sexist sub on reddit . 
  do you not remember them jerking off over the underage girl with the sagan book , or siding with dawkins over the 4am elevator incident . 
  and as for their treatment of religious people it 's fucking appalling . 
  they may point out flaws in others but they 're always going to cast the first stone . 
  they never judge themselves because they see themselves as smarter than everyone else . 
  great stuff . 
  another sja like you find on / r/tumblrinaction, 
  xiou come you talk about communication like you can `` fuck with it '' . 
  xiu 're raping the language of tolerance !, 
  ** patriarchy detected !, 
  humans are n't animals . 
  poor innocent piggy never harmed anyone , so is a pure blooded animal . 
  humans do n't deserve life unless they live alongside the other animals , and stop oppressing them . 
  how long is true christian staying closed lou ? 
  we welcome all things conservative in here but the doors are still shut . 
  [ meta ] i personally still prefer merry christmas as it has nicer connotations but to each their own . 
  i did n't think google maps bombarded you with ads ? 
  or even featured them at all ? 
  and i have bought an app thank you but the offline mapping apps do n't have every country . 
  sygic is fairly comprehensive but does n't have sri lanka for example . 
  google does . 
  and they 're entitled to it . 
  are you an oppressed pig kin ? 
  then you better not judge filthy human scum, 
  it was weird but on my original note it was promised with the ics update and i did n't get s note with it . 
  i had to find an apk of it and manually install it . 
  i 'm just getting round to the responses on this thread but you can not have `` proper offline mapping '' in that you can not search the limited data downloaded without an internet connection or navigate with it . 
  this is what i and i 'm sure a lot of people would like to be able to do . 
  except you ca n't download an area larger than a city or even search the data offline for what you want , let alone navigate with it . 
  good ... good ... let the hivemind flow through you . 
  innocent , full of wonder ... two can play semantics my friend . 
  because it should n't have to be an option, 
  right but even the limited offline data is n't great . 
  if i was able to search and navigate with it offline i 'd be much happier , but you ca n't . 
  father forgive them for they do not know what they are doing ... 
  everyone desires appreciation . 
  there 's absolutely nothing wrong with it, 
  jinn are the genies/demons in islam . 
  it 's exactly the same as when you hear an evangelical saying demons/satan were tempting them . 
  they 've got `` dies '' in their name . 
  it 's scientific ~ ~ fate ~ ~ fact this was meant to be, 
  le bravery face, 
  you can use soy milk and save precious bovine juices, 
  that 's not true at all and never should be . 
  unfortunately it seems to be the attitude amongst fundamentalists trying to pass legislation like this . 
  i 'll take a benevolant dictatorship over a tyrannical democracy anyday . 
  the arab spring was `` democracy '' and look at what it 's done for egypt . 
  they voted for morsi and now have an islamist dictator taking over and giving himself total power . 
  democracy is a great idea but if the culture and people vote for legislation violating human rights , we should be standing up against it . 
  it 's like a contagious mental disease . 
  like some demented puppy flinging shit and wanting to infest the world in it . 
  if it 's a surface or transformer prime you probably could . 
  otherwise no . 
  ** you are a terrorist and a fundie . 
  you cast a shadow over the light of atheism and brainwash sheeple keeping us all in the dark ages !, 
  to think that your fundie lies have n't put you in jail in sweden ( peace be upon that place ) is disgraceful . 
  how dare you spread filth over sagans promised land . 
  i plead with the science spirit that reason will flow over the dark , illogical trails you have spread . 
  stupid apple , stop attacking android !, 
  let me link to your sub so i can laugh at you . 
  and sense . 
  do n't let me get started on ** h ** igh ** t ** ech ** c ** riminals, 
  fuck you america, 
  edit : upvotes ? 
  really ? 
  then we heard applause . 
  not just clapping , like shouting and cheering so i wrapped a towel around myself, 
  and stepped out of the tent . 
  there were wallmart cart boys in their company outfits , surrounded by our friends, 
  and probably five people i didnt know who he had gathered from a campsite of other teens nearby , and they, 
  were all cheering for us . 
  suddenly a voice whispered to me . 
  `` be brave '', 
  `` how '' i asked, 
  `` strong , then post on reddit '' - the voice replied . 
  never too much pr0nz brah !, 
  only in le canda though . 
  dae hate american carriers ? 
  reported to / r/antiatheismwatch !, 
  damn right . 
  even us filthy colonials still love her, 
  yes i did . 
  ama, 
  i think the problem is the usual ` us vs them ' mentality that pervades almost any area where people can have opinions . 
  it 's iphone vs android , pc master race vs consoles and in this case mainstream music vs non mainstream . 
  i love some of the pop hits on the radio . 
  ` brokenhearted by karmin , wings by little mix , ready or not by bridget meddler , we are never ever getting back together by taylor swift . 
  granted there is some real crap out there but just because it 's top 40 does n't mean it 's automatically awful . 
  you can to less mainstream bands at the same time . 
  you can believe it or not appreciate two different things at the same time !, 
  i 'm listening to ry cooder , of monsters and men and cut copy at the moment for example as well as listening to the hits on the radio . 
  i used to be the exact same in high school . 
  i jerked over the beatles , stones , zeppelin etc and shunned the filthy plebs who listened to pop music , while closetly listening to hits on the radio at the same time . 
  wait until you get into wine . 
  i swear there 's even less variation than beer , outside of desert wines and bubbly . 
  do you seriously loathe the beatles ?
