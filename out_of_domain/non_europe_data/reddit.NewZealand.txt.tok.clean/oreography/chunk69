  i can understand their early stuff but have you listened to the white album , abbey rd , rubber soul etc ? 
  they 're all really good albums and i 'm sure you 'd find something there if you have n't listened to the stuff . 
  if you 've listened to their later albums then that 's fine , but if you have n't given them a chance you should .

  why can we eat animals and not fuck them ? 
  these are the same people who 'd justify a `` post birth abortion '',

  what the fuck did you just fucking say about android police , you little bitch ? 
  i 'll have you know i graduated top of my class in flashing roms and i 've been involved in numerous secret builds on xda , and i have over 300 confirmed downloads . 
  i am trained in internet warfare and i 'm the top apple basher in the entire disqus comment section . 
  you are nothing to me but just another isheep . 
  i will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this website , mark my fucking words . 
  you think you can get away with saying shit about android police over the internet ? 
  think again , fucker . 
  as we speak i am contacting my secret network of comment trolls across the dev scene and your iphone is being traced right now so you better prepare for the build , maggot . 
  the build that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call ios6 . 
  you 're fucking outdated , kid . 
  i can be anywhere , anytime , and i can load roms in over seven hundred ways , and that 's just with my transformer prime . 
  not only am i extensively trained in the dev scene , but i have access to the entire arsenal of the / r/android and i will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the internet , you little ishit . 
  if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little `` clever '' comment was about to bring down upon you , maybe you would have held your fucking tongue about iphones . 
  but you could n't , you did n't , and now you 're paying the price , you goddamn idiot . 
  i will shit bootloaders all over your phone and you will drown in it . 
  you 're fucking bricked , kiddo .

  i think if the quality of posts became more like / r/trueatheism you would n't get people criticizing the sub , because there 's actually some insightful content . 
  it 's hard not to criticize / r/atheism when you have white middle class kids whining about how they 're oppressed with memes . 
  thanks for ruining my childhood, 
  obviously you 've been hanging out with some reasonable transsexuals . 
  there are n't many of them on the internet unfortunately, 
  i tried to identify myself as legosexual - being attracted to plastic blocks and a mod scolded me for it . 
  can anyone say oppression !!!? 
  alternet or go home . 
  thankfully / r/politics aggregates all the most accurate opinion pieces . 
  this could have been the white house in the name of `` fiscal conservatism '' . 
  just think about that ... 
  test macro pls upvote, 
  and america is behind scandinavia once again . 
  what 's that ? 
  maybe socialism does work you stupid fucking republicans !!, 
  i did a me gusta face after owning fundies all day, 
  your analogy does n't work because circlejerks are n't designed to be insightful and are self aware of their stupidity . 
  and nobody in a circlejerk claims they 're `` oppressed '' whereas ratheists do . 
  i do n't think people are complaining that / r/atheism is `` oppressive '' it 's that they 're complaining that the arguments , discussion and content used there are juvenile . 
  a poll was taken in / r/magicskyfairy - the chief `` anti atheism circlejerk '' board and over half of the members were atheist . 
  what i do n't think / r/atheism subscribers understand is that you can criticize something claiming to represent atheism , without being a christian or theist , much like a christian can criticize the 700 club without being an atheist . 
  it 's the pervasive us vs them dialogue that stops us looking at things rationally . 
  what really speaks volumes about `` opression '' is / r/antiatheismwatch , a subreddit designed to point out people criticizing / r/atheism . 
  on a website with the largest atheist forum on the internet , they honestly believe the majority of the site are against atheism . 
  again , you can be anti / r/atheism or ratheists while still being atheist . 
  i think this is one of the best i 've seen http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ch0jehy3qvu&amp;feature=fvwrel, 
  `` blind hatred of / r/atheism '', 
  i 'm done here . 
  it really proves you did n't even understand what i wrote , and simply switched my words round trying to make a flawed analogy, 
  really insightful thanks . 
  is that an insult to our leader ? 
  although he 's not an alpha white swede he 's still the captain on our shining ship of socialism , and a redditor too !, 
  ** obviously ** we 've got science on our side .

  `` was anyone inspired by mitt romney ? 
  did anyone vote enthusiastically for mitt romney ? 
  of course not . 
  voting for romney is like hooking up with the last single person at the bar at 4 a.m '', 
  here that conservitards ? 
  your `` leader '' was friendzoned, 
  i 'm from new zealand and we have a lot of international students . 
  the bar for uni is n't that high and i think most international students can get in .
