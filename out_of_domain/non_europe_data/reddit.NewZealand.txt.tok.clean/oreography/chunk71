  i 'm sure he has some good things to say but i ca n't take the guy seriously anymore . 
  ever since his reddit meltdown making fun of rape victims . 
  currently enjoying dream drop distance . 
  i never level my party up quick enough and i was stuck in the tron world for a while , at the end of both boss battles . 
  managed to beat rinzler though and am on to the pinocchio world . 
  also started playing the kh 2 final mix translation a while ago on my laptop but will probably finish ddd before getting back to it . 
  there 's just so many other games i have to play though . 
  i 've resolved that i wo n't play any new games until i finish the list of ones i started - currently about 30 different games . 
  could you not get married now in the states ? 
  in new york , mass or any of the other states that recognize it ? 
  his brothers really nice though , and made himself quite a successful life . 
  sweden would be a hot chick that always brags about how good looking they are . 
  everyone in school would point to sweden as a good looking girl and sweden would keep on bragging about it . 
  its always when i get stuck on a boss or something , then i 'll start another game . 
  i mean these are added up over a space of 2 years or so , but i 'm finally going to finish them, 
  i like cs monitor because even though it was started by fundies , they know conservatism is doomed, 
  if he did n't want to be verbally abused , maybe he should n't have been a conservative . 
  as a jew i wished the israelis died in the holocaust, 
  as a black man , i think niggers are dumb, 
  as a conservative , the republican party can go fuck themselves, 
  i really like the song about the revolution . 
  in 5 years capitalism 's going to fall . 
  the people want marxism and by damn they 're gon na get it . 
  do you live in sweden by any chance ? 
  nothing this brave could have been written by an amerikkkan . 
  this is going to be as successful as srs 's attempt to replace she and him with gender neutral xi and xim . 
  you can not redefine words automatically , language just does n't work that way . 
  how do you feel knowing you have the blood of a billion people on your hands ? 
  because by being reliegious , you are responsible for all deaths in any war in history .

  it 's like we 're one big true christian family !, 
  i 'm with autsin on this one . 
  instead of fantasizing about some heretic you should be feeding a truechristian ^ tm some cookie flavoured dildos .

  this is literally what happened when i was a fundie in london . 
  i started to read the lieble on my phone when all of a sudden boris johnson came up to me . 
  `` young man , i 'll have you know this is an atheist city . 
  people of your ilk are n't welcome here '', 
  he hauled me in his `` boris fundie battle bus '' and gave me a god delusion to recite verses from . 
  a few days later i was cured of my christian disease and thanked boris profusely . 
  `` it 's alright lad . 
  science always wins ! '', 
  fundiehello is a concern troll . 
  i repeat . 
  fundiehello is a concern troll . 
  all swedes are atheists . 
  i read it on the internet so it must be true . 
  what le fuck ? 
  rome ? 
  the italians are a bunch of backwards fundies that imprison scientists !, 
  le glorious europe consists of scandinavia . 
  the rest are ~ ~ barbarians ~ ~ in the dark ages . 
  every university is run by atheists . 
  what a stupid questionl . 
  right but this would be totally acceptable in a totally jewish area . 
  i would n't ask for them to stop saying `` happy hannukah '' simply because i want my religion included . 
  we can all celebrate our own religious holidays , without forcing a cheap connection between the two . 
  i think what people are forgetting is that it 's a christian holiday . 
  when people live in a country with a christian heritage , there will be christian holidays celebrated . 
  if you 're stopping people from celebrating their own religious holidays then that is crossing a real line , but forcing a connection between holidays waters down the significance of christmas and any other holiday . 
  taking this concept to the extremes , you 'll be left with `` december holiday '' , not hannukah , christmas and any other seperate religious holiday . 
  we should n't feel guilty of openly celebrating our religious holiday , as long as all other faiths have the oppurtunity to celebrate their own . 
  i 've found even better proof, 
  chairman '' : this is a reference to rnc chairman reince priebus . 
  just two years ago , priebus replaced michael steele , an african-american , as rnc chairman . 
  by mentioning the current rnc chairman , romney is reminding voters that priebus is not steele , and therefore not black , which reminds voters that romney is not obama , and therefore not black . '',

  yeah i did n't mind it either . 
  you could always go back to the weaponry 's to get your shiny weapons , and most enemies had decent enough weapons . 
  it was only a problem if you insisted on holding on to the same weapon , without upgrading or going to the armory, 
  i had tons of fun with the multiplayer personally, 
  the longest journey - really engrossing and the amount of npc 's drew you in to the fantasy world, 
  some of the old playstation platformers i always come back to, 
  crash bandicoot , spyro , ape escape etc. 
  it 's largely for nostalgia , but those games still are enjoyable and the mechanics hold up, 
  generally it 's multiplayer games though . 
  crash team racing , crash bash , mario kart , burnout 3 , super smash bros melee, 
  he 's literally the next richard dawkins, 
  noooooooooooooo !, 
  have i unwittingly become one of them ? 
  has fundiebook corrupted me even when i was only trying to destroy their arguments ? 
  lord sagan please have mercy on me !!,
