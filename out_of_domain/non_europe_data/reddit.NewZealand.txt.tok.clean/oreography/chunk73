  it 's just a stupid move removing functionality . 
  perhaps it saved them on cost somehow ? 
  i disagree . 
  it compares android with an up and coming phone os which is a good thing . 
  i do n't think most people on this board are aware of the differences . 
  nice reasonably objective overview . 
  i was considering purchasing a lumia 920 for my mother this year but eventually settled on a galaxy note 2 - which was cheaper ( for me anyways ) and she needed a big virtual keyboard . 
  you 're definitely right about the navigation on win phone and i wish google would enable proper offline navigation . 
  you can get open street map based offline mapping solutions or paid versions , but having full offline maps for free is a big advantage . 
  i actually suggested on the win phone board that nokia should market the 920 's offline navigation for travelers , as it 's probably the most handly travelling feature out there . 
  personally i do n't think i could switch yet . 
  the 920 has the best smart phone camera out there but i 'd miss the google services and my gba emulator !, 
  also the screen size , apps and swiftkey would be major losses as well . 
  it 's good to see that the platform is getting way more apps though but it 's still lagging behind . 
  i 'd consider switching if this http://news.softpedia.com/newsimage/nokia-lumia-onenote-5-5-phablet-concept-runs-windows-phone-8-3.jpg/ concept came true .

  a new godless holiday `` saganmas '' shall be celebrated by all atheists on december 26th . 
  it will be a holy day where all atheists can chant the mantra `` good without god '' and own true christians ^ tm on facebook . 
  the consequences will never be the same if we are to continue this fight . 
  in mutual respect of karma we must put an end to this war .

  i think he just hates atheists . 
  he 'll have some good conversations with christians and then when an atheist wanders in he acts like they 're trying to crucify him . 
  i swear he 's drunk on that scotch half the time ...

  we 've had these types of posts plenty of times but for the sake of maturity can you stop referring to deities as `` sky friends '' . 
  judging from your posts in this thread you seem to have a lot of misconceptions of christianity . 
  the vast majority of us do n't believe the world is a few thousand years old and accept evolution . 
  the majority of us also are accepting of homosexuality . 
  as you 've put it bluntly there are `` douchenozzle christians '' but in our faith we are called to love them as much as the `` cool ones '' . 
  you 're more than welcome here but try not resorting to creating stawmen out of our religion . 
  there are tons of atheists on this board and all types of christians but the reason it works is mutual respect for one another , even if we disagree with their positions . 
  losing someone you love is hard , regardless of your beliefs . 
  i agree that it 's much more comforting as christians to believe that we will see those that we love again , but we can all appreciate the time and memories we had of the people we loved on earth . 
  stay close to the rest of you family over the next few weeks as your parents and other relatives will be mourning just as much as you . 
  i wish you all the best and hope someday your grand kids are going to look up to you as much as you looked up to your grandfather .
