  the difference in where the two products are manufactured says a lot i think . 
  either you 've just started studying network admin or you 're lying . 
  knowing the difference between bits and bytes is an important part of the job, 
  freedom aint dumb son . 
  yer the dumb one choosing to be a pinko commie . 
  #### but where 's your freedom ? 
  checkmate socialist . 
  much more effective than pleading for it on the internet ... in theory anyways, 
  well they use it in their phone os for one thing ... 
  why does n't the meat industry not cater to vegans !, 
  i do n't think you need to be vegan or vegetarian to be against factory farms . 
  even when regulated the living conditions for the animals can be appalling . 
  however if you compare said farms to the holocaust then you 've got problems . 
  did the meltdown happen this year ? 
  upatheisted, 
  / u/namer98, 
  wow . 
  i applaud this brave man standing up against fox 's mind control tactics . 
  when o'reilly is on i yell at the tv telling him his `` techniques '' wo n't work at all . 
  `` you hear that bill ? 
  i 'm a lie proof liberal '', 
  so he criticized windows 8 as being `` locked down '' and bad for gaming , then they offer their own proprietary pc ? 
  came out at the very start of the year . 
  i know it 's got a big fanbase online but since it was only released via bit torrent it did n't get much exposure outside of its fanbase . 
  barely any reviews etc. 
  i 'd say it had the best story in any game i 'd played possibly ever . 
  sure is . 
  it 's also on the sidebar of / r/magicskyfairy . 
  it 's the best sub for owning conservatives with jerky alternet reposts . 
  i have a post history on sidehugs and post on the metaboards . 
  i promise i wo n't troll or anything with the account i 'd just like to glimpse what it 's like in heaven . 
  it 's because the design at least is an ipad knock off ... i mean really . 
  the latest android tablets are more original since apple started suing companies based on their patents , but the first galaxy tablets were definitely modelled to the point of copying the original ipad . 
  the 10.1 even more so due to more similar size . 
  yes because angles are patented right ? 
  i do n't see how you can defend samsungs early android offerings as not being rip offs of apple products . 
  motorolla , htc and other makers were putting out far more original designs at the time than samsungs original s1 and first galaxy tab . 
  here 's the tab compared to an ipad http://www.9to5ipad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ipad-2-vs-galaxy-tab-7.7-9to5ipad.jpg, 
  samsung have definitely improved with the s3 and almost every android tab coming out now has an original design . 
  however when you have an eu wide ban stating that your 7.7 inch tab ripped off the ipads design then you know there 's issues with its originality . 
  when did i criticize the nexus 4 or your old hp laptop . 
  i do n't think any of the latest android devices are ripping off apple except for the obvious ones comiung out of china . 
  the argument they ripped them off is n't just because of the size , it 's because of the design theme including icons and colour themes used and the patents infringed on . 
  htc , motorolla and other manufacturers were making android devices with original designs in 2010 yet samsung stole their first generation design theme of their android devices from apple . 
  ** private schools ? 
  you ca n't indoctrinate the bloody world and expect to hide behind privacy !!!!, 
  shameless advertising of / r/liberalreality , where you 're free to jerk about liberal politics all day long . 
  i think most of us get tired of the same repeated jerkiness be it from a conservative or a liberal slant . 
  for a group that loves the seperation of church and state so much , / r/atheism love to mix religion and politics ( in easily digestible imgur form ) almost constantly . 
  '' it happened to me at my dad 's funeral . 
  he was n't religious , but some woman he did n't even like got up and started singing some religious song . 
  i jumped up and started raging at the entire place . 
  i flipped my shit and started saying every cuss word i could think of . 
  i raged for a while and stormed out . 
  my dad was prominent in the community and there was a lot of people there all dressed up and i had on an old subhumans tshirt . 
  it was actually pretty awesome , i wish someone would have filmed it . 
  it did piss me off that he was misrepresented . 
  the woman singing was the last straw . 
  several others had gotten all preachy and shit too . '', 
  it was basically the post that ended her modship, 
  oh look the icons and ui looks completely different than touchwiz v1 .0 . 
  oh look the curved design actually distinguishes it from an ipad . 
  oh look it did n't get an eu wide ban on being an ipad rip of ...

  why should n't i spend my entire life and spare time caring about something that does n't exist ?

  #### this ! #####, 
  take me to your cave of gold !, 
  if you 're buying a tablet for music get an ipad . 
  the nexus line will suit most consumers needs but as other people have pointed out , apple leads support for peripherals, 
  oh how we suffer ... 
  tomba/tombi 3, 
  a decent spyro or crash bandicoot sequel . 
  i agree . 
  in fact they take far more from society than they give . 
  once you stop contributing to society you should just die , especially if their political views are plain wrong . 
  they 're just stupid brainless sacks of skin i mean , what do they do for you or me ? 
  nothing . 
  except for the whole indefinite loan period . 
  if that happened in a library nobody would return any of the books and it would stop functioning . 
  gee it 's almost like people can have different opinions and preferences , who would have thought !, 
  both communities are great in my experience and both have excellent mod teams . 
  i think the rebels destroyed that image themselves . 
  filming an execution of your enemy does n't win you any brownie points . 
  you say that but all evidence points to the contrary . 
  they 're out breeding all other religious and non religious groups . 
  no but even when library 's lend ebooks there is a loan period . 
  if tbp let you keep content for a month say with drm and then it stopped working then it might be comparable . 
  however when you can indefinitely keep the digital copy then it 's different, 
  but with a photocopy the quality is significantly poorer than the original .
