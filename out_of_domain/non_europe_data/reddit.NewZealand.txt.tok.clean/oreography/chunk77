  the last frontier was alright , but you could tell it definitely was n't a naughty dog title . 
  i 'd compare it to wrath of cortex on ps2 , decent but nowhere near as good as the originals . 
  you 'd really enjoy the first jak and daxter then . 
  completely different to 2 and 3, 
  you good sir have the best ** logic ** around !, 
  not praying is a far more effective prayer than praying to a god . 
  and if god was loving he would definitely show know mercy to people attempting to reach him . 
  but it 's undeniable . 
  no prayer = most effective prayer ever . 
  the stupidest argument i 've ever had on reddit was a guy claiming that ea `` stole '' his games because he bought them from the ` ea shop ' before it was origin . 
  he did n't agree to the new subscriber agreements he heard about from le reddit to access his games on origin , so they `` stole '' his games and would pirate any ea game he wanted to play . 
  when i pointed out that steam had the exact same condition ( inability to file a class lawsuit ) he still claimed they were `` stolen '' from him . 
  contrarianism really is the bane of this site . 
  if half life 3 comes out with online only drm i guarantee the majority of / r/gaming will happily defend it and nobody would dare advocate piracy against the almighty valve . 
  the thing is though , the majority of people bought diablo 3 for the multiplayer . 
  even though it had an `` online only '' connection the single player mode was still easily cracked and the game was uploaded onto torrent sites . 
  for games where multiplayer is the main component the majority of people always have to buy it . 
  so i honestly do n't think that invasive drm hurts sales for games where multiplayer is the main component , because those who want to play the main component will buy it anyways . 
  however for a single player game they 're always going to be able to crack the component - it happened with diablo 3 , assassins creed 2 and will happen with sim city . 
  when you add an online only component onto a game where the single player mode is the main component ( like ac2 and sim city ) then there 's the expectation that the single player mode will work offline . 
  those going in to diablo 3 do n't have that expectation . 
  this is why i think single player drm hurts sales - people do n't expect it and should n't have to put up with it because it 's simply not necessary and is an annoying process for legititimate customers . 
  when pirates have easier access to simcity - that they can play on their laptop where wifi is n't present then it only makes legitimate purchasers disgruntled and less likely to purchase games from the publisher again . 
  many may pirate the game because they can play it easier and they get the main component free . 
  `` the simcity community on ea/maxis ' proposed drm '', 
  haha . 
  `` the entitled reddit gamer community on ea/maxis proposed drm '' more like it . 
  sorry forgot to link the exact quote .

  i 'm really hoping that morsi and the muslim brotherhood gets overthrown . 
  it 's become apparent they can not lead a secular or democratic government , or provide protection for the coptic minority they despise . 
  i saw an article last week on worldnews where the muslim brotherhood said something like `` you wanted democracy and now democracy is n't good enough '' after morsi taking total powers . 
  well overriding the judiciary and taking absolute power precisely is n't democracy , that 's why they 're protesting and why they fought so hard to gain democracy in the revolution . 
  i really sympathize with the coptic christians and actually knew a family living in my city who had fled from cairo in the 90 's . 
  they really do n't deserve the harrasment they get , especially to the point of having their churches burnt down and being murdered . 
  please do n't use `` feminazis '' unless you 're referring to feminists in nazi germany . 
  people just do n't take your opinion seriously it 's as immature as using terms like `` conservitard '' or `` jewish sky zombie '', 
  [ meta ] does anyone here actually believe in demonic posession ? 
  i mean i get that saying yoga is demonic is going too far but i have a hard time believing the demons mentioned in the new testament are a `` metaphor '', 
  i think he 's referring to the `` new atheism '' that dawkins and harris promote . 
  it 's not atheism itself which is such a simple idea but the almost militant secular though that new atheism baggages itself with that turns people off from it . 
  there 's a notable distain for all things religiously related in this snarky version of atheist thought and includes religious holidays . 
  when you dawkins line of thought leading him to be against [ fairy tales ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/3255972/harry-potter-fails-to-cast-spell-over-professor-richard-dawkins.html ) for the sake of them being illogical then you 're alienating anyone with an imigination and who wants to celebrate the `` magic '' of christmas . 
  culturally christian by following the established christian conditions within their culture . 
  you can more or less substitute `` culturally western '' for it because christianity and western culture throughout its history and in the present have been synonymous .

  shut up kkkorporate pig !, 
  i know you 're trying to brainwash us . 
  i read all about it on thinkprogress . 
  that 's pretty bad i agree but i think the worst is / r/antiatheismwatch . 
  the people there are convinced reddit has an `` anti atheist agenda '' . 
  i mean reddit of all places , simply because some people criticize / r/atheism . 
  no of course not . 
  what i am suggesting is that the aggressive tone of dawkins and the like can disenchant people with the idea of atheism . 
  there 's no problem for pushing for secular interests but if you do it in a way which is demeaning to others then you wo n't gain anyones respect .

  if he just said early on `` i do n't know exactly what chamberlain did but history shows him as an appeaser '' he would have been fine . 
  bluffing your way does n't work on talk shows because the interviewer has all the facts . 
  from what i can remember hitler had a policy of `` lebensraum '' if i can remember how to spell it which translates as living space . 
  his early policies were to take the german speaking parts of europe . 
  he first annexed austria and then sudetenland which was the german speaking region of czechoslovakia . 
  chamberlain was ordered to mediate this process and failed miserably stating that hitler had peaceful/lawful intent . 
  hitler then not only took sudetenland but the rest of czechoslovakia as well . 
  it was n't long after that that he invaded poland who the allies had a treaty with and war broke out . 
  done,
