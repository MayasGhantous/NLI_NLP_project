  tetris theme, 
  you do n't unless it conflicts with what you identify yourself as . 
  if i called myself a christian and then claimed god is n't real i 'd be a hypocrite . 
  likewise an `` agnostic atheist '' who then calls people delusional and considers their faith childish is acting like an anti theistic gnostic atheist . 
  when you disregard your opponents position to the point of insulting them , then you are no longer lacking any doubt about your position and calling yourself `` agnostic '' would be hypociritical . 
  let 's not play the oppression olympics here . 
  i 'm sure you know that these countries where atheists are persecuted are islamic and christians are also deprived of office as well as numerous other rights . 
  yes i was referring to communist regimes throughout history because atheism is a tenant of communism , as christianity was a tenant of european absolute monarchism . 
  for both systems the wrong done was largely for political reasons but for both ideologies , the belief ( or unbelief ) system was a part of each political system and ca n't be seperated from either when wrong was done . 
  cities were sacked in the crusades largely for wealth and power but christianity was the pretense . 
  likewise churches were ransacked and taken property of the state in the soviet union largely to seize their wealth and lands but with atheism as a pretense . 
  now does christianity or atheism lead you to do these terrible things ? 
  no , of course not . 
  can christianity , atheism or any ideology be twisted and used as a pretense to do wrong . 
  yes . 
  but saint stephen was an atheist http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/vqbdn/bash_atheism_day_was_a_huge_success/,

  calling people `` stupid '' is an attack on their intelligence not the person . 
  thankfully the blessed google granted many a phone to be born again in the light of ics . 
  it happened to my galaxy note and i still thank the great google for granting it new life . 
  so this `` professor '' is trying to take on st dawkins and therefore atheism itself ? 
  does n't he realize his skydaddy do n't real ? 
  it 's a fight he 's going to lose as dawkins has science on his side . 
  this is the only way to show the fundies that they 're wrong . 
  show no mercy . 
  as st juliebeen the blessed and most logical showed us fighting fundie oppression at a funeral changes hearts and wins minds towards science . 
  maybe they should have sex with trans people who 've changed to the opposite gender then , if nobody else will have sex with them ? 
  not really . 
  even though we can have a religion with less dogma and a more personal one it 's still a religion . 
  even if you disagree with him ( as i do as well ) do n't resort to name calling . 
  you 'll never change anyones minds . 
  absolutely not . 
  if the question was writing erotica then the answer might be different but of course it 's fine . 
  there 's nothing wrong with using `` magic '' in the novel as christian authors like j.r.r tolkien , c.s lewis and j.k rowling have done . 
  there are many other religions yes but christianity is special in that we are given our salvation . 
  god extended it to us through grace . 
  in islam , buddhism , hinduism and any other religion i know of you have to earn your salvation . 
  now this does n't mean that we do n't have to do good things , in fact we 're commanded to do good things , but it means that god recognized our flaws and gave us a second chance . 
  also even atheists/agnostics can admire the teachings of jesus and the compassion he showed humanity . 
  this is what distinguishes christianity from other religions . 
  as others have said you 're 14 years old . 
  all of us have questions we struggle with in our faith and that 's a good thing . 
  it 's good to doubt because it strengthens the foundation of our faith so it is built on sturdy rock . 
  keep on asking questions and turn to your christian friends , pastor and post some more questions here if you 're struggling with anything else .

  if it was `` come , come , come in the name of jesus .

  it 's a terribly forced connotation that barely even works . 
  that rape is worse than reliegion . 
  i mean sure rape might hurt , but reliegion scars you for life . 
  i mean sure . . you were brutally forced to accept a mans penis inside you and could barely breathe as he repeatedly violated you ... but reliegion is farworse .

  you 're either an agnostic atheist or an agnostic theist .
