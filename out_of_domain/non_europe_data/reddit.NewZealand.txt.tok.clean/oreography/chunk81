  ** who let the fundie in ?? 
  aliens = no god because they 're not in the lieble, 
  but mona lisa = louvre = france = paris = secularism = atheism ? 
  what do i le think ?? 
  i used to like the atheist pig , but now i prefer www.theatheistcow.com, 
  it 's not wrong when we 're right, 
  the dreamcast was n't considered dead before release . 
  in fact it had fantastic first year sales . 
  however once the ps2 came out the sales fell through completely . 
  `` ya know he 's dowin it ! '', 
  insanity is a necessity to be a republican . 
  chris christie is a democrat in wolf 's clothing . 
  how would asian , african people etc exist if the world was repopulated solely by jews ? 
  the most likely interpretation points to a massive regional flood , which is also recorded in the epic of gilgamesh . 
  of course the known `` world ' was n't very big then . 
  that sounds awesome , is that in genesis 2.0 ( bigger , better , jesus kicks the dinosaurs asses ) edition ? 
  by `` worst '' he may have meant the worst he had seen morally but it could have been for whatever reason he felt , since `` worst '' is very subjective . 
  downvotes , really ? 
  it 's actually not very well known that the story is a `` complete '' myth since there is evidence to point to a regional flood occuring in the area . 
  remember `` worldwide '' was the known world then , a very small area . 
  yes he did . 
  it says so on the quote . 
  but le steam is good !!!!, 
  sony is bad !!!, 
  excuse me ? 
  isaac newton was a scientist and therefore an atheist . 
  pfft ... you probably read conservitard edited wikipedia for your information . 
  well there 's quite a difference between saying `` the story was exaggerated . 
  there was however a regional flood '' and `` the story is a complete myth ! '', 
  the `` conversations '' with god may have been mythical as i take a very allegorical view of genesis , however if you 're implying that prayer or conversations with god are myths then i very much disagree . 
  you 're getting very unsympathetic responses partly out of being linked by / r/tumblrinaction where i came from as well . 
  there are people on that board that identify as the most ridiculous identities `` trans species '' , `` otherkins '' and a whole host of identities created simply for the sake of rebellion and contrarianism . 
  the whole concept of `` gender fluidity '' is very much up for debate and is something i disagree with . 
  i believe your sexuality is natural and you 're attracted to one gender or both . 
  have a talk to your parents about how you feel about religion . 
  i assume your parents are christians . 
  despite what the right wing evangelical ones believe evolution , the big bang theory and scientific thought can be reconciled with christianity . 
  honestly examine what you believe . 
  being an atheist is fine and your parents should accept that so long as you 've researched this position . 
  being gay or bisexual is also fine but pansexuality seems a very unusual sexual identity . 
  your body go 's through an incredible amount of changes at your age so please honestly examine whether you are attracted to transsexuals or the opposite gender as well . 
  i know this is n't what you want to hear but many people ( and your parents as well ) are going to assume you 're doing this out of rebellion and that it is just a phase - both your sexuality and your atheism . 
  i 'm not trying to `` oppress '' you but i 'm just giving you some insight . 
  please examine what you believe and talk to your parents . 
  they love you and are there for you , despite what you think . 
  this is better http://www.reddit.com/r/facesofatheism/comments/13cc9p/my_ass_of_atheism/, 
  any solar body . 
  any scientific term with religious influence needs changing . 
  we 're talking about the second enlightenment here . 
  - mark twain, 
  dae specifically go onto ytian facebook pages to spread the light of reason ? 
  yeah it 's not the best example ... but then again do n't the latest need for speed games on android have almost console equivalent graphics ? 
  haha downvoted for having an ipad . 
  hilarious / r/android ... 
  on android it does n't void your warranty . 
  also it can be done out of the box by simply changing a setting . 
  it 's much easier on android , especially to the tech illiterate consumer . 
  and 50 % of the market could n't even play the game on their phones , even if it did come out . 
  last figure i read was 10 % still on ics ... 
  you and the evolietionist promoting childrens show following liberal temptress p4kchu , the swedish heathen sunnyhello and the lesbian sinner arabella_queer need to get off this godly subreddit . 
  i do n't care how dang interpretive you make your bible , a womans place is in the kitchen and that 's that !, 
  this is who rombot wanted to be the next vp of our country ... 
  no , not at all if you 're just learning from it . 
  yes , very bad if you 're trying to host it as it sounds like you are , since you 're likely breaking the copyright . 
  in this moment , i am euphoric . 
  not because of any phony lieble verse but because i am enlightened by aalewis, 
  upbraved for science good sir !, 
  it was once ... then users compared it to the holocaust ( no joke ), 
  dae brush off criticism without doing jack shit ? 
  til bob the builder is a scientist . 
  ** god did n't build that building . 
  ~ ~ builders ~ ~ atheists did !, 
  mcafee and windows defender are both crap . 
  uninstall it and install either microsoft security essentials or avast and malwarebytes . 
  all are free and work well . 
  this is the science spirit speaking to us through the great scientist aalewis . 
  only through our atheism can we truly feel euphoria beyond this dimension . 
   i agree with satan, 
  this is going very meta but the worst thing was that all the e-atheists took the original christian sidehugs youtube video seriously without realizing it was a joke . 
  it was just pathetic seeing them go `` haha yeah stoooopid xtians * without even getting the video . 
  google has built up a massive `` free '' ecosystem for the exact same reason that microsoft turns a blind eye to people pirating its products in developing countries : dependency . 
  once you are dependent on a product or they have become the clear market leader , then you can monetize or increase the charges and few people will leave . 
  google upped the price on its google maps api for developers last year to ridiculous prices , so much so that many devs stopped using it . 
  only after the backlash did they put the price down . 
  true ms was an awful company in the 90s but apple has been using the same tactics the past few years and it looks like google will do the same . 
  what kind of sad life must someone live to constantly post pictures of mutilated people ? 
  because reddit is organized and boards have rules . 
  if you want porn you go look for it , it 's not on / v / ( where i 've seen it being posted ), 
  at least there 's still / r/liberalreality for quality unbiased ^ tm political discussion . 
  yes , it 's a satire circlejerk on / r/politics as / r/magicskyfairy is to / r/atheism . 
  and lo with the leaving of king autsin , the queen ~ ~ jezebel ~ ~ blalal assumed responsibilities for herself . 
  she began preaching to the sidehuggers , tempting them to lead them astray from their godly duties . 
  this . 
  #### na uh concern troll . 
  get your fundie propoganda out of here !, 
  this is very true . 
  i have n't seen any but they are definitely oppressing us . 
  they ca n't handle our atheism !!!, 
  thnx for naming my new atheist metal group man !!, 
  tennis has no gods .
