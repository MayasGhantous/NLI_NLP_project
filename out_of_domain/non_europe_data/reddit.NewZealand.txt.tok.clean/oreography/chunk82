  as an original note user , unless you 've used one i do n't think you quite understand . 
  they 're far from being unportable in fact , the note is one of the slimmest phones out there . 
  however i use my phone for web browsing , mp3 , movies , notepad , pdfs etc foremost and as a phone second . 
  it 's my portable multimedia device and has tablet functionality . 
  when you have a screen 5 inch plus you can feasibly use it as a tablet replacement . 
  on anything smaller it 's much harder . 
  true you have movie playback + pdf reading but it 's much harder . 
  on the note 2 you can even multitask with 2 apps running side by side . 
  however if you want the `` phone '' functionality more than the `` smart '' functionality then i can definitely understand . 
  a bigger screen is n't for the majority of people and i think 5 inches is the cutoff for the average user , but to get the full benefit of all the amazing features going in to phones having a bigger screen is very helpful . 
  as long as i can fit in my pocket and hand then i 'm fine with a bigger screen . 
  in fact i 'm hoping rumours of a near 6 inch screen for the note 3 are true , because i 'll definitely be buying it . 
  there 's barely a difference between 256 and 320 to the average user . 
  you need high quality audio equipment to notice the difference flac makes .

  go unto facebook and pwn your relatives and friends with atheists quotes on space backgrounds everytime god is mentioned . 
  did n't you appreciate his trophy case of online compliments ? 
  well good for you you have different needs and uses than i do . 
  web browsing is also much better on a bigger phone as is using it for maps and gps . 
  honestly i always thought it was way too big until i actually started using it , now everything seems too small !,

  christianity has an entire book , a 2000 year history and theologians studying it to talk about . 
  there is also any christian news and the impact it has all round the world and anyone with questions relating to the bible or faith will post there . 
  the reason / r/atheism is a circlejerk and atheists get the label thrown at them is that atheism by definition is merely `` lack of belief in a god '' whereas christianity encompasses a far larger scope and range of beliefs . 
  this is why new atheism or the e-atheists have `` humanism '' as a source of morality and bag political movements , opinions and anti theism onto atheism . 
  do n't forget the complete lack of moderation and the fact it 's a default sub . 
  two things that would make / r/atheism much more like / r/trueatheism . 
  the problem is that last time / r/atheism became non default users compared it to the holocaust . 
  looks like the lamestream media missed this one as well .

  no because the study showed that scientists that held belief in god was highest in the younger population of scientists . 
  the older scientists would have been through the politicizing on christianity that took place in the 80s and the anti-evolution movment that both thankfully seem to be dying out . 
  i suppose younger people are n't finding this so much and do n't see the conflict , as they are n't biblical or religious literalists .

  what ? 
  you still do n't get it fundie ? 
  let me clarify, 
  to be considered a theist , you need to believe in every supernatural being ever . 
  if you do n't and are monotheistic then you 're basically an atheist .
