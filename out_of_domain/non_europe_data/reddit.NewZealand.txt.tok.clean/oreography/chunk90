  definitely zelda . 
  how many other games have a history book published about the series ? 
  yeah nothing compares to world history if you really want to dive into `` lore '', 
  i have n't played xii or xiii but does n't xiii have more of a fleshed out lore story etc , since it 's part of their fabula nova crystalis group where every game takes place within the same world . 
  there 's ffxiii number i , ii and iii then type 0 and then versus when it finally comes out . 
  ivalice is only in tactics and xii is n't it ? 
  420 blaze it stephen !, 
  you 're obviously much better versed in final fantasy than me . 
  i 'll definitely have to give 12 a go then , it does look better than 13 anyways . 
  i found it pretty cringeworthy compared to some of the other stuff that 's been posted . 
  definitely more in line of / r/magicskyfairy than cringepics though, 
  does n't belong at all . 
  take it to / r/antifeminism or wherever the hell you want . 
  its been the same for me with the `` new atheist '' type like in / r/atheism . 
  i have atheist friends but they do n't define themselves by their non belief , unlike these e-crusaders that make it the most important ideology in their life . 
  oh lordy that serious love brd on braveryjerk is the greatest thing ever . 
  also , i thought this was one of nukethepopes alts . 
  he was the only person defending him in the original thread , and went to the halls of sagan to argue . 
  [ * i always do the dew , when you due for the dew . 
  do you ? 
  really ? 
  i can see it fine, 
  that 's ridiculous . 
  surely anyone who pictches a decent amount of money on a kickstarter expects the product . 
  unless you 're a massive fan you 're not going to fund and pay for something seperately . 
  [ but when / r/atheism votes up an anti religion hitler quote it 's totally not fair and a fallacy !, 
  satan has a hold of you jew .

  this brave keyboard warrior being downvoted is an insult to humanity . 
  come on / r/liberalreality we can fix this injustice , let 's upvote him to the socialized sky !, 
  do you realize you 're being completely hypocritical ? 
  people were against romney 's 47 % comment because it wrote off almost of america as scrounging socialists , and you 're writing off even more as stupid republicans . 
  they 're downvoting you for being incredibly biased and bigoted not that there 's some sort of downvote agenda . 
  ah sorry , i can easily resize it with res, 
  i 've added this approved news outlet to the sidebar as well as many of your suggested works . 
  also, 
  [ * fascism ? 
  go on ... * ] ( / / #netanyahuquote ), 
  it 's definitely true though . 
  i mean it 's plausible so i 'm going to accept it . 
  upvote to the left good sir . 
  as an atheist i can confirm she can say `` this '', 
  haha they edited their subs css with a picture of shatner . 
  they also removed the dildo/rad feminist designs so he hopefully joins them . 
  i 'm sorry but that 's ridiculous . 
  they hate reddit yes but `` have everyone arrested and take over the internet '' is just hyperbole . 
  i ca n't believe you 're being upvoted . 
  can we give this man his phd yet ? 
  he 's passed the atheist initiation, 
  could n't run the country , could n't work an easel . 
  remind us now why eugenics is bad again ? 
  getting to the heart of the faith , one macro at a time, 
  i think most people threw away their gamecubes if they bought a wii and likely threw away their ps2s if they had an original ps3 as well . 
  if it 's completely backwards compatible there 's little point keeping the older console . 
  because once you have something you do n't want to lose it . 
  both the sony and nintendo disc based consoles all had it , people see the advantages of it now and do n't want to lose the support . 
  not quite for psp since it 's only digital copies that work . 
  our sub is pretty much dead is n't it ? 
  fedora 's worn with a suit evokes classiness and the gentlemen culture that redditors like to emulate . 
  the problem is it does n't look classy when worn with a t shirt and shorts for example , or anything other than a suit . 
  likewise smoking a cuban cigar in a diaper is n't exactly classy either , it has to fit the right environment . 
  oh god i 'm picturing awful things . 
  not just the lord , the lord crossed out with red liquorice !, 
  yes true , i just thought i 'd clarify . 
  also in japan they had the umd passport program to convert umds to digital so at least they made an effort over there .

  there have been a couple decent oc 's but nothing compares to euphoria and walmart . 
  those are some of the greatest copypastas in existence . 
  yeah it really sucks . 
  i actually just bought my first ps3 , a backwards compatible one which i 'll use until ps2 emulation becomes decent enough on pc .
