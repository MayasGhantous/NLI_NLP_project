  services every sunday and tithing to their church ? 
  seriously , who needs that ? 
  what good does it do , does it make people even better ? 
  does it guarantee salvation from an eternal afterlife of torture ? 
  well , here 's the thing : any deity willing to submit these people to eternal torture for being decent but non-god-fearing human beings would be untolerably evil . 
  personally , not only do i not believe in such a crazy and evil being , but i 'm seriously concerned about the sanity of anyone who would not dedicate their lives to dear leader . 
  if you play your cards right , then for you american redditors this could be your future : a community/country where few people care about god , probably mostly for reasons of nostalgia and inertia ; and where those beliefs are held so privately that nobody mentions them in public , let alone votes them into new public laws . 
  they wo n't even have to vote at all . 
  where effective sex ed and science are taught in schools and family planning is not made to run gauntlets . 
  where people do stuff that works for dear leader rather than praying . 
  edit : anyone who disagrees has an argument full of fucking straw , and can redirect it to the yellow brick road . 
  i know some of you fucktards do n't like the way i speak my mind , but this is the style i choose to adopt . 
  many people praise me for the refreshing and entertaining quality of my comments . 
  the controversy i generate attracts attention and provokes rebuttals that i think a calmly highbrow approach would n't .

  is the pope a pedophile ? 
  of course i am , i `` ve read the god delusion !, 
  no i came to reddit to get informed answers, 
  if you want a basic site the main consensus seems to be using wordpress and pick a theme that works for you . 
  how did you clean it out ? 
  i 've heard using a vaccum is bad for it . 
  pretty sad that the current belgian king got a heroes welcome in the drc a few years ago in kinshasa when they had the anniversary of independence . 
  what have you got against poland ? 
  and call it `` le network '', 
  this looks amazing !, 
  i 've been having so many issues with my dinosaur fetish , i 'm glad that reddit can provide an outlet . 
  start comparing the oppression you face to martin luther king and the civil rights movement then call them a bigot if they disagree . 
  also it does n't matter what her legal guardians think , what matters is le sexy time amirite ? 
  science works on everything . 
  are you some sort of backwards theist ? 
  `` come out '' has largely become a metaphor but they need to go back to the literal meaning . 
  you need to ejaculate onto him while he 's asleep to `` come out '' onto him . 
  this was the original meaning but it never seemed to take off . 
  oh and after you do it and he 's staring at you in a mix of horror and disbelief tell him you love him . 
  guaranteed relationship success . 
  this . 
  a million times this . 
  i 'd been seeing them as equal but they 're not because they 're not men and are stupid and friendzoning whores .

  i weep for the legitimate love lost between a twenty something year old neckbeard and a 13 year old woman .

  played the demo of mh3 ultimate on 3ds today . 
  they converted it pretty well, 
  it 's true , actually . 
  i 've taken some sys admin classes and on win server it 's more easy for admins to control ie 's permissions compared to the other browsers . 
  it 's a large reason why they have such a big enterprise marketshare . 
  [ * your voice is heard with every upvote i get * ] ( / / #ronquote ), 
  conservatism is always relative to where it comes from . 
  where i 'm from us conservatism is seen as extreme far right , whereas our `` more conservative '' party is centre right and actually supports gay marriage . 
  they 're also largely fiscally conservative as opposed to social conservatism . 
  i believe social conservatism by any of srs 's standards would be seen as bigotry , regardless of where you 're from . 
  compare this to the green party in parliament who want a completely socialized system , unreasonable amounts of money spent on the environment and decriminilization of harder drugs and positions that even the far left parties in the states support and you can see how relative the labels are .

  there are some great ps1 games if you have n't played them that are great . 
  tomba , roll away/kula world , chrono cross , final fantasies , crash and spyro games are all good if you have n't played them . 
  one of the good things they 've done in regards to digital sales is that all their sony developed titles for vita were round $ 10 cheaper on psn at release than they were retail . 
  the practice did n't seem to encourage many other developers but it 's good steps . 
  at least with ps + they seem to have understood the kind of deals gamers want .

  seriously ? 
  do you not remember the bash islam spree they went on . 
  / r/islam flooded with blasphemous posts and mocking of their faith . 
  the context was in regard to / r/atheism not atheists . 
  `` we do n't invade * you may sub to / r/atheism and not endorse some of their actions but they 've certainly brigaded boards and threads . 
  i 'm with you that the average atheist on this site does n't take part in board invasions .
