  they would simply begin regurgitating the news form the television . 
  i go back inside . 
  i am alone on this planet . 
  anonymous, 
  if he is then that 's a load of crap . 
  i think the only games improved by mouse and keyboard are point and click titles ( that 's just a mouse and a touchscreen does the same thing really . 
  very few on console anyways ) , rts 's and fps 's . 
  any platformer , driving/sports game , 3rd person shooter , action adventure , rpg 's are all designed with a controller in mind and work best with them . 
  i love my pc but i would n't play arkham city , ff7 , burnout or any other console designed title without a controller on it . 
  no matter what the hardware , by the end of the life cycle once developers have had years working with it and they can really push them to the limit . 
  titles like twilight princess on gamecube ( which looked almost the same as the wii version , supposedly a generation ahead and was meant to showcase the wiis graphics ) and god of war 2 on ps2 both looked as good as titles a gen ahead of them . 
  stylized games i think hold up really well . 
  windwaker could have been a wii/early ps3 title with a little more polish . 
  i used to buy physical copies of pc games but there 's really no point anymore . 
  it 's a shame but a lot of them are pretty much just activation discs for steam/digital front and if not ca n't be played without a code tying it to your account , limiting their useage to only you . 
  it 's only a few devs like the witcher ones where you could actually lend the game to a friend because they 're drm free . 
  finally getting round to finishing ** skyward sword . 
  ** i was stuck for a while but two stubborn to use a walkthrough but finally got round the annoying key collecting area at the fire temple ? 
  i think . 
  i 've really been playing ** call of duty 4 ** multiplayer a ton . 
  i 'd never played the campaign before and have really enjoyed it . 
  it 's such a fantastic shooter though it 's a shame there are n't custom maps , but it 's still incredibly active on steam . 
  i tried out the demo for the ** new castlevania game on 3ds ** . 
  i thought the one on ps3 looked amazing but had n't owned a ps3 up until recently but from what i played it 's pretty average really . 
  the ds ones were much better . 
  i 've been using my supercard dstwo on my 3ds and trying out some old ds games . 
  one that 's surprisingly good is ** mario hoops 3 on 3 ** . 
  i like mario tennis , kart etc but i was n't expecting a basketball game to be that good but it 's fantastic to play , especially with the analogue stick on the 3ds xl . 
  also enjoying the ** sonic colors ds ** which is similar to sonic rush/sonic advance and is a great platformer and ** kirby mass attack **, 
  i finished the last bit of ** half life 2 episode one ** which had an awesome ending . 
  i really enjoyed it actually but it was another case of getting stuck and finally going back to it after months . 
  also on pc i 've been playing ** and yet it moves ** a fantastic puzzle title that everyone should pick up and ** aaaahhhhh for the awesome ** a game designed around futuristic base jumping which is great for pick up and play gameplay . 
  so you 're anti gay then ? 
  we 're all madly in love with her after seeing a grainy shot of her ass and pumpkins ... 
  electronic abortions, 
  oh sweet sagan that 's so beautifully awful . 
  i thought it would be a parody sub at first but it seems this is the exact kind of thing an autistic child would write for creative writing , and yet someone submitted it to / r/atheism . 
  so you have figured out that the majority of / r/circlejerkcopypasta is n't very happy with the defaults and believe that their memes are pretty silly . 
  you might find some of this shit offensive even . 
  you might even feel that you need to post about how much / r/circlejerkcopypasta sucks . 
  i have a 10 step plan in order for you to correct this issue . 
  go fuck yourself . 
  this is a crucial step , and will be recommended should you decide to openly voice your concerns about / r/circlejerkcopypasta . 
  might as well get this out of the way so when it is recommended , you can proudly claim ` i 've done that already ' and the discussion can continue . 
  a broken bottle is ideal , but whatever tool you have available it fine , even if it is a portal gun . 
  repeat step 1 to ensure completion . 
  unsubscribe . 
  you do n't have to be here , you do n't have to read the bravery , a.a lewis quotes , and dumbasses on / r/atheism . 
  red button on the right . 
  go away , we do n't want you . 
  repeat step 1 again . 
  understand our user base . 
  if you live in the default subs , you might legitimately not understand a large portion of our users . 
  i will wait ... ok , that 's long enough . 
  there are many jerking users in the meta subs , whom stay in the meta subset to prevent bad memes from happening to them . 
  this includes something as trivial as being cut off from / r/atheism ( which in reddit is not a right , but a paid privilege ) , to something as severe as being thrown in subredditdrama or ( in the rare case ) having their account terminated . 
  there have been users on here asking for help due to parents wanting to involuntarily commit them to a bravery ward for their jerking . 
  this subreddit is for them to vent . 
  repeat step 1, 
  we have every reason to hate the defaults . 
  while we do n't necessarily hate default posters , we do find their submissions silly and worth mocking . 
  however , default subs are responsible for many account terminations in sweden , norway , and america , especially among this particular subsection known as rage comic artists , which believes memes is a legitimate alternative to humour and maturity , which sometimes ends up killing the unfortunate account . 
  repeat step one , one last time . 
  if you are still here and have concerns , discuss . 
  if not , unsubscribe button is on the right , have a nice day and do n't forget to go fuck yourself . 
  go fuck yourself . 
  people posting images from 4chan as news ... seriously ? 
  valve would have already fuelled the fire already if the rumours were even remotely true . 
  so many sim city posts this week . 
  i think a lot of us probably thought it was the usual hating on ea for little reason jerk but they 've completely dropped the ball with this one . 
  they deserve every bit of criticism they get until they ( or if they ever ) fix their game, 
  dvdfab the service the guy is using can bypass the copy protection . 
  i used it for years until i started downloading movies instead . 
   no lte, 
  you do n't stay at home all day using google fiber on your phone ? 
  pshh, 
   no removable battery, 
  implying a nexus battery would die ... and even if it did you have the chance to get a nexus 5 by the time that happened . 
  therefore it 's a privelege you do n't have a removable battery, 
   no sd card slot, 
  if you do n't store your entire life on google drive then there 's something wrong with you . 
  i spent 5 thousand dollars on chromebooks pixels i never use and i get 5tb of storage !, 
  google always wins, 
   overheating issues, 
  tell me you do n't like them on a cold winters day ? 
  that 's right , not such a problem now are they ? 
   i am an apple sheep so i 'm trying to discredit google, 
  baaaa . 
  baaaa !, 
  i need a `` user friendly '' skin on my phone . 
  oh god you 're in / r/antiatheismwatch ... no wonder you take criticism of that sub too seriously . 
  the disconnect between upvoters and commenters is amazing there . 
  it 's the reason why the content is all so low effort , because people click on images bashing reliigion and upvote . 
  this site is majority atheist you idiot . 
  people just diislike people being intolerant and general dicks , both atheists and religious people . 
  why did you sell your wii ? 
  it 's got a fantastic library now and i 'm sure they 're cheap to pick up now . 
  yeah , the vatican is definitely jumping to go to war with people ... 
  so brave !, 
  republicans are bad .
