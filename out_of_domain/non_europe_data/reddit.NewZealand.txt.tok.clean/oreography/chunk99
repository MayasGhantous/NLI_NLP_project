  hitler was bad . 
  republicans are literally hitler . 
  #### it 's science conservitards !, 
  source ? 
  just for extra logic and reason, 
  i think you meant `` burn in hell '' , `` just fuck off and die '' or `` heretics get what they deserve '', 
  yeah i got the same thing so i incorporated the css problem into my flair !, 
  why do n't more people get this ? 
  we 're being fed lies and delusions . 
  why i even wrote about this on my blog www.wakeupandfindthetruth.org.info.conspiracy.fuckbush.gov, 
  i open my eyes in the morning . 
  the ceiling is above me . 
  i go into the living room and turn on the ` television . ', 
  a ` priest ' is on the ` news , ' talking about the election of the pope . 
  this reminds me of the fact that i am on a planet where pretty much everyone walks around believing in fantasy novels , written thousands of years ago that make no sense . 
  from the koran to the bible to the hindu elephant man . 
  this is what most people think about all day . 
  i change the channel ... 
  a politician is on the news talking about the republican agenda . 
  i am reminded once again that no matter how many lies they govt is shown to commit or how incompetent they appear , people will only be outraged for a brief moment and then drift back into the dream state , where everything will be fine as long as they tow the line n work hard . 
  i change the channel ... 
  a stadium full of people are drinking and screaming as athletes run around a field trying to catch the man with the ball . 
  the people beat their chests and scream in primal ecstasy . 
  grown men , in their forties and fifties discuss in elaborate detail the strategies employed to win this game , as if they were generals discussing a conquest . 
  i turn off the television . 
  i walk outside . 
  overhead they are spraying the skies . 
  long plumes of sticky webs stretch out filling the sky with a haze that turns what would have been a beautiful day into a whitish haze . 
  there is a rustle of noise . 
  to my right an illegal alien is doing work in my neighbor 's yard . 
  he sees me , standing only ten yards away , but does n't acknowledge my presence . 
  his eyes avoid mine , even though i stare at him blatantly . 
  his skin is dark , but his hair is gray . 
  he is old , dirty , bedraggled , resigned to some fate that only he knows . 
  i feel bad for him . 
  my eyes scan the neighborhood . 
  row after row of flimsy wooden houses . 
  like cardboard boxes . 
  or chicken coops . 
  the people do n't talk or communicate with one another . 
  they have no original ideas or thoughts . 
  they simply absorb the information from their televisions . 
  i doubt any of them have looked at the sky in ages . 
  i stand in my yard for five minutes . 
  humans walk by occasionally . 
  they seem unnerved to see a human being standing around . 
  not hurriedly going somewhere . 
  not fiddling with a cellphone . 
  they desperately avoid eye contact . 
  the fear they feel is palpable . 
  my slightly abnormal behavior has led them to automatically believe i am a deranged serial killer or terrorist . 
  because this is what the television tells them . 
  i idly think of trying to have a conversation with another human being . 
  but i know what happens . 
  they would simply begin regurgitating the news form the television . 
  i go back inside . 
  i am alone on this planet . 
  the debt crisis is a pitiful excuse the republitards use to try and stall obama from creating a brave new world . 
  the fact is obama has generated more money and jobs than any republican ever has so they have to make up bullshit conspiracies like a debt crisis in order to criticize him . 
  i 'm a non denim christian but accepting of theistic evolution and gay marriage or as r atheism would say `` stupid fundie cherry picker '' i do n't believe the bible is inerrant as there are a lot of problems with it but it 's the result of devout men throughout history and their chronicles of attempting to reach the divine . 
  i 'm from new zealand and i 'd say most of my friends are agnostic and quite a few atheist . 
  r atheism and it 's delusional victim mentality , revolving their entire lives around atheism are probably the worst thing to happen to the atheist community . 
  the myths they spout there like jesus did n't exist and wars all come from religion piss anyone with historical background off . 
  the main thing i dislike about them is that they are a default though . 
  i get that despite all its problems it can be a place to vent for young atheists but nobody should have to come to reddit and see blatant hatred for their religious beliefs on the front pagd, 
  energy , confidence and euphoria come from mountain dew , not coke . 
  they may say this but they 're certainly under no obligations to deliver this . 
  you get a license to play the games , not a drm free game to play . 
  if valve ever goes bankrupt the last thing they 'll care about is the customers . 
  the bible belt !!!!!!, 
  ^ ^ new ^ ^ zealand, 
  they got that from one of richard dawkins stories where he talked about a professor being so proud a student disproved what he was saying, 
  i think the `` atheism is a religion '' argument is a fallacy but / r/atheism does just about everything it can to give it legitimacy . 
  they want a sense of community i think so they define themselves by something that really should be inisignificant . 
  the worst one was the `` saints of science '' bracelet thing that got upvoted ... i mean what can you really say when you see something like that . 
  i ca n't even jerk it 's just so pathetic . 
  / r/games is still good for its size and is good for gaming news . 
  i 've been visiting / r/3ds and / r/ps3 a bit too , though i think / r/3ds has a lot of teenagers posting there . 
  / r/imaginarylandscapes i like a lot . 
  / r/redditdayof , / r/truereddit and / r/offbeat are stiill pretty good too . 
  / r/circlebs is a great place to talk and i imagine half of you guys are in it anyways . 
  / r/circlejerkcopypasta has some great submissions as well , and / r/thehallsofsagan too . 
  / r/christianity is still generally a good place for interfaith discussion and happenings in the religious world . 
  it 's really nice seeing atheists , jews muslims and christians get on , there 's even buddhists , hindus and pagans that are regular contributors too , much to the ire of the more conservative submitters . 
  / r/askhistorians is always good if you 've got some sort of interest in history . 
  i do n't contribute much because posts neeed to be held to a high caliber, 
  despite its hivemind i 'd say / r/worldnews is still one of the better default subs and i visit it everyday . 
  some of the comments can be pretty bad though, 
  / r/cringepics comments section has a lot of nasty comments but the submissions are still generally pretty good . 
  i still kinda like / r/subredditdrama even though there are lots of issues with the posters . 
  i 've pretty much stopped / r/tumblrinaction since mras and bullies have taken over the comment section ... it was great a few months ago though . 
  i find / r/circlemusic has some great varied musical content even though i do n't go much . 
  i still visit / r/android a bit , / r/technology is too much of a piracy jerk . 
  some of the smaller tech subs are great . 
  / r/web _ design has been really helpful for me and i still visit / r/windowsphone , / r/surface and a few others every so often . 
  i actually like a few country specific ones . 
  / r/newzealand is interesting as is / r/unitedkingdom , / r/hongkong , / r/china since i have some sort of tie to alll those places . 
  i like a lot of jerk subs though / r/sidehugs , / r/gamingcirclejerk , / r/androidcirclejerk , / r/liberalreality ( plz sub ) are all good . 
  tumblrinaction comments section has turned into a bit of a cesspt lately though . 
  i find a lot of rabid srs haters have joined the place recently ( not that i 'm much of a fan of the fempire , but both extremes suck ),
