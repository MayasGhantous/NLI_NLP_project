  that 's why it 's worth discussing . 
  you 're entirely right . 
  your vote is worthless . 
  it sucks , but it is . 
   finally , if everyone thinks voting against the tories is a wasted vote , nothing will ever change . 
  it will when the uk adopts a proper voting system and it will in electorates that are n't safe . 
  new zealand had a referendum relatively recently ( 2013 ? ), 
  on whether to keep mmp . 
  it did n't * succeed * , but it still happened . 
  scotland is likely to have another referendum . 
  there could be a second eu referendum in the uk . 
  decisions can be remade . 
  the right voting system , the fairest to everyone is , simple proportional voting . 
  every party has a list , everyone votes for the party they want . 
   an unelected head of state ? 
  an unelected upper chamber ? 
  an unwritten constitution that everyone is ignorant of ? 
  none of these are actually issues if you have any conception whatsoever about how the british constitution works . 
  unwritten constitutions are * objectively * better . 
  an unelected , non-political head of state is * objectively * better . 
  do you know what subreddit you 're in ? 
   it literally does n't matter unless you end up in government . 
  democracy is always the 51 % governing the other 49 percent . 
  if a party wins 51 % , then yes . 
  but in proportional systems , that does n't happen . 
  what happens it that a * coalition * of parties get 51 % between them , and they have to * compromise * with each other . 
  there is no ` losing team ' . 
   ook at the presidential election in france or in the us, 
  thank fucking goodness the uk is n't a presidential country . 
  presidential systems are borderline retarded . 
  you have n't proved anything . 
  i study logic , i know what a proof is , and you have n't given one . 
  evidence that supports your claims is not ` proof ' . 
   but now constituents have no control over who their mp is, 
  everyone 's mps are all the mps . 
  there are no constituency mps . 
   you ca n't get rid of a shitty mp, 
  ultimately the only mps that actually matter are ministers . 
  the other mps really are totally irrelevant . 
  who cares if they 're ` shitty ' . 
  they exist only to make up the numbers . 
  they might as well not actually exist , and actually just be the party leader of each party with as many votes as they have mps . 
     there were enough leave voters in scotland to have swung it to remain ... 
    no there was n't . 
  as is always the case . 
   you are wrong - just run the numbers . 
  first and third get downvoted , for no reason , despite being * objectively * correct . 
  the question is n't about ` applause ' or ` worry ' or anything else . 
  it 's about numbers . 
  the ** fact ** is that scotland could have turned the vote . 
  that 's ** it ** . 
  that 's ** all ** that 's being discussed here . 
   brainstorm is played in 70 % of all legacy decks . 
  if you look at the results , if you look at what people are playing , instead of that abysmal website , about 7/10 decks are blue . 
  yes basically every blue deck plays brainstorm , but that does n't mean the format is entirely blue or mainly blue . 
  that does n't mean that red , black , white and green at 3/10 of the format , which people seem to think . 
  the format is 70 % black , 80 % red , about 60 % green and 40 % white . 
   six out of the ten most played cards in the format are blue . 
  because the blue cards are consistently played in basically all blue decks while the other coloured cards tend to vary more . 
  nearly all blue decks play force of will and brainstorm , ponder . 
  * many * play preordain , many play daze . 
  a lot of blue decks are delver decks . 
  blue cards tend to be played as 4-ofs , which mixes things up a bit . 
  that chart is weighted by how many are played in each deck . 
  the other colours are just as common as blue , on average , but they tend to be different cards in each deck , with the exception of things like deathrite shaman and lightning bolt , which hey , look , are on the list . 
  most played cards in the format is quite irrelevant to whether the format is ` all blue ' , which is a pretty typical comment about legacy in this subreddit . 
   i 'm not saying there are no good non-blue decks , but the vast majority of fair decks are still blue . 
  the majority of decks are blue , the majority of decks are red , the majority of decks are black . 
  it 's almost like with fetches and duals that most decks are bloody multicoloured or something !, 
   and do n't give me the `` lol / r/magictcg user does n't know about legacy '' garbage . 
  legacy is literally the only format i play and i play it 2-3 times a week in paper alone not counting magic online . 
  that 's cool , but the idea that you ` have to play blue to play fair ' or whatever is still dumb on both levels : firstly , it 's not true statistically that blue is the most commonly played colour in legacy , looking at the results , and secondly , there are multiple viable non-blue fair decks right now . 
  death and taxes , big red , 4c loam , eldrazi , lands , burn , deadguy ale , maverick , etc. 
  all are good viable decks . 
  yeah there are n't a huge number , but * there are n't many non-black decks either * . 
  if you want to play fair in legacy without playing black , what can you play ? 
  the awful portent miracles without top ? 
  death and taxes , where splashing black seems more common by the day ? 
  ur delver , maybe . 
  rug is dead , it seems . 
  uwr has been dead for a while . 
  lands , again . 
  there are n't many non-red decks . 
  you could play bug delver ... you could play uw control . 
  death and taxes , deathblade , ... ? 
  that 's kind of it . 
   so now i do n't have a single person i can contact if i have a problem, 
  why would you contact your constituency mp if you ` have a problem ' ? 
  what sort of problem ? 
  gas leak ? 
   which as i said in another comment , is a ridiculous statement and debate to be having . 
  ** that does n't matter ** . 
  it could be absurd , and ridiculous , and stupid , but it 's the discussion that is being had . 
  do n't like it ? 
  go discuss something sensible , somewhere else . 
   i 'm not disputing the numbers , just saying that `` there were enough leave voters in scotland to have swung it to remain '' does n't really mean anything in the wider context of what was being discussed . 
  and yet you are disputing the numbers , because you 're defending the side that 's saying simply ` no there was n't . ', 
  so if i do n't know something you are just going to cut me off instead of ... giving an example ? 
  i 'm not trolling you mate , i just do n't see any value in having electorate mps . 
  the leaders of both the nz labour party and the nz national party ( tories ) are list mps .
