  soz , they are definitely combo . 
  nevertheless , that still brings us to like 30 % . 
  less really , if you look at the last 2 weeks it 's 26 % for mtgtop8 's idea of combo which is pretty broad . 
  i 'm pretty sure discord is n't encrypted . 
  for a long time i did n't believe it , as the evidence was very circumstantial . 
  for the same reason that every character not directly specified as being straight is considered gay by the creepy teenage girl harry potter fandom . 
   the whole knight thing is very homoerotic . 
  what ? 
  yes it is . 
  it 's pointless , stupid and a waste of time . 
  ` my tiny irrelevant population is n't represented !!!!, 
  reee ', 
   it 's just weird and bland when 99 % of your story is straight white pp, 
  no it is n't . 
  it 's weird and bland when there is a token character of every weird little minority tumblr has thought up . 
  parliamentary privilege . . ? 
  because it would be political suicide not to . 
  it 's not a matter of legally being required to . 
  he would make a total fool of himself and embarrass his party . 
  nobody is talking about the fucking merits of denying women the vote . 
  um , they 're all still mps i 'm almost certain . 
   i live in a safe labour area, 
  your vote is completely irrelevant then . 
  sorry , but you just should n't bother . 
  i do n't care whether they 're different issues . 
  that 's not the fucking point . 
  the point is that universal suffrage is a separate issue from democracy . 
  you do n't need universal suffrage to have democracy . 
  ` democracy ' is not and has never been defined with universal suffrage as a requirement . 
  what ** you ** personally view as ` good ' disenfranchisement ( apparently children ) vs. ` bad ' disenfranchisement ( apparently prisoners and women ) is quite irrelevant to the definition of democracy . 
  for what it 's worth , i agree that women and prisoners should be able to vote , and i agree that children under 16 should n't be able to , but i disagree with the claim that 16-17-year-olds should n't be able to vote . 
  ( and , i should not , i 'm nowhere near that age-range . ), 
  but that 's irrelevant to the definition . 
   it 's all-but-confirmed that lyanna was the kotlt, 
  classic / r/asoiaf : wild speculation one day , ` all-but-confirmed ' the next . 
  why ... ? 
   you mean the top 10 % who currently pay most of the tax for the country ? 
  yeah tax them more , that could n't possibly have any downsides . 
   yeah the corporations , they 're not real people either just faceless companies ... 
  the parochial ignorance of you brits astounds me . 
  you know you have massively lower tax rates than most of europe , right ? 
  you said a whole lot of nothing , in response to this :, 
   there 's more to life than gdp growth ... like recognising your own culture and hearing your own language spoken around you . 
  uk gdp forecasts for 2017 remain at 2 % , regardless . 
  which needs to be repeated . 
   he called hamas and hezbollah friends . 
  no , he did n't . 
   he called the falklands war a tory plot . 
  because it was ... 
  + beside labour ? 
  flawed polls muh methodology reeeeee, 
  - beside labour ? 
  perfect , this will be the result , polls overhyped labour , strong and stable strong and stable strong and stable, 
  how idiotically ignorant can you be ? 
  for one thing , nearly half the population wanted to remain in the eu . 
  and labour 's policy - corbyn 's policy - is to leave . 
  immigration does * not * make money . 
  immigration does * not * make money . 
  ireland is a tax haven . 
   on the flip side of the campaign , our own government threatened the country with a harsh punishment budget and stated that we 'd all be poorer to the tune of around # 4000 per household . 
  which is fucking * true * . 
  i did n't say shit . 
  read the usernames . 
  nothing to do with ` sovereignty ' . 
  uk immigration rates are fucking insane . 
  skilled immigration is fine , and the eu should have free skilled immigration , but unskilled immigration is bad and should be shut down . 
  the whole point of safe seats is that they are pretty much permanently aligned with a single party over the time span of * decades * . 
   what if i decide to leave surstr\u00f6mming open in the flat instead ? 
  nothing . 
  the issue is n't making a curry once or twice . 
  it 's making a curry nearly every night for the many-year duration of a tenancy agreement . 
  obviously the guy is a nutter : you should be cleaning the place up before re-letting it anyway . 
  but you 're still missing the point . 
  you 're entitled to do what you want with your property , sure , within the law . 
  that means you can say :, 
  * no staining or smelling , or you pay for the cleaning, 
  but you can not say, 
  * no pakis, 
  having low corporation tax is not a good idea . 
   the main issue you 'll have is too many jobs and not enough people to do them, 
  if you think any modern western country is anywhere near full employment you have another thing coming . 
   immigration fills jobs, 
  not really . 
  unskilled immigration causes unemployment . 
  skilled immigration is n't opposed by anyone and is n't part of the discussion . 
   jobs are where people create value , money is basically value . 
  both of these statements are either wrong or deeply , deeply misleading depending on your point of view . 
   what is your point ? 
  that you seem to think that wanting to remain in the eu is some sort of fringe political opinion . 
  but it is n't . 
  half the population wants to remain . 
   by ` remainers ' i 'm referring to only a small minority of them, 
  ` remainer ' refers to someone that wants to remain in the eu i.e. 
  48 % of the population . 
   the majority of remainers were eurosceptic , just like the rest of the population . 
  false . 
  there are zero eurosceptic remainers by definition . 
   only a small minority of people who personally benefit from eu membership were fervently pro-eu, 
  ** literally ** everyone in the uk benefitted massively from eu membership . 
   and these were n't even the same people as the rabid remainers who were mostly ignorant young adults .
