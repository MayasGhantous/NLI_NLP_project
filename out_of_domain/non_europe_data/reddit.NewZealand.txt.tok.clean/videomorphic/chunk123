  they have smaller , less diverse worlds . 
  every area in the game is essentially the same . 
  they have loads of enemies that are just the same as the other enemies with a slightly different colour palette . 
  that 's not anything new , but it 's much more noticeable in 3d than in 2d games . 
   innovations, 
  mmorpgs today are completely uninnovative . 
  innovation does n't cost money . 
   all of that costs money that no average indie company can afford without relying on external funding and/or mtx . 
  no it fucking does n't . 
  innovation does n't cost money . 
  graphical assets cost money . 
  voice acting costs money . 
  marketing costs money . 
  the actual game development costs , the real costs , they 're not any higher than they 've ever been , they 're lower . 
  games have higher budgets now due to art costs , voice acting and most importantly ** gigantic ** marketing budgets . 
   only aaa mmos on already stabilished companies might be able to survive on subs alone nowadays . 
  others would even need to be b2p + subs + mtx to make it a profitable business . 
  that 's * just not true * . 
  it 's bullshit . 
  it makes no sense . 
  it is an expansion . 
  they call it an expansion , that 's what it is . 
  runescape has been releasing the amount of content that wow releases in an expansion two years apart , every couple of months for 15 years . 
   mmorpgs cost a lot more and require a lot more resources nowadays, 
  they just do n't . 
  game budgets are higher than they used to be because of expensive art assets ( which are not necessary , look at all the incredibly successful innovative indie games with ` bad ' graphics ) , expensive voice acting ( just not necessary , ever , full stop , end of story ) and ** massive ** marketing budgets . 
   especially with the standard that has been set with the great mmos over the years . 
  no newly released mmorpg has had as much content as wow released with since . . well . . wow . 
   they used to be able to get by solely on subscriptions , but now even wow has a cash shop . 
  that 's entirely greed . 
  wow certainly does n't need a cash shop . 
  they have one because they can get away with it . 
  modern is not an eternal format . 
   if you 're talking about single player games or non-mmorpg games , they can absolutely be done at a lower budget . 
  absolutely not . 
  unless you want a 2d ultima online-like game that will come out in 5 years and get about a hundred players online on average ; ultimately never paying the development costs anyway . 
  they 're exactly the same . 
  there 's no difference . 
  single player or multiplayer or mmorpg does n't make a single bit of bloody difference . 
   innovation costs money because almost nobody is going to fund a gamble , save from crowdfunding ... which usually fail in the end because of lack of fundings . 
  you do n't need funding to make a game . 
  that 's the whole premise of indie development . 
   people who play mmorpgs either want a shitload of content - which no new game will have without spend at least a few dozen millions - or a very good looking and fluid gameplay ... which also happen to cost as much , if not more . 
  you 're just talking utter rubbish . 
  have you ever actually played any mmorpgs before wow ? 
  have you ever played any indie game ? 
  nobody cares about the mongoloid wow crowd . 
  they 're not the target audience . 
   - wow was in development for 4.5 years and cost $ 63 million . 
  aaa game and thus irrelevant . 
   - i 'm not sure if minecraft could be considered a mmorpg nowadays , but for the most part it was n't . 
  it got a million copies by the beta release and it 's been in development at least since 2009 . 
  i did n't say it was an mmorpg , i said it was an indie game , try to keep up . 
   - factorio is n't a mmorpg and will probably never be anything close to it . 
  i did n't say it was an mmorpg , i said it was an indie game , try to keep up . 
   - old school runescape is possibly the worst example ; over 16 years of development on a company that claimed to have over 480 people working on it . 
  it 's definitely an aaa + budget game , even though it has bad graphics it probably has the highest amount of content you can find in a game ever . 
  i did n't say that osrs was an indie game . 
  again , please try to keep up with what i 'm actually saying . 
  you 're very poor at this . 
   now , you want a game that can compete with the 4.5 years and $ 63 million worth vanilla wow ... how ? 
  never said this , please try to keep up . 
   i do n't know how much content uo or eq had at launch , but both of them cost at least $ 5 ~ 6m ( uo ) to $ 3m ( eq ) 20ish years ago , which you can add about 50 % inflation to get today 's worth . 
  uo was funded by ea and was the first of its kind ; eq was also funded by soe . 
  neither were indie games . 
  no , you do n't know . 
  because you 're ignorant . 
  you have no idea what i 'm trying to say , because you have a comprehension problem . 
   how viable is that ? 
  to spend at least a few millions working on a mmorpg with 0 returns to have a possibly great game ready in , at best , a few years from now ? 
  have you literally never played an indie game ? 
   the playerbase of subscripion based games is too small to justify 5 + years of production . 
  no it is n't . 
  firstly , mmorpgs do n't take longer to make than any other sort of game . 
  secondly , the playerbase is larger than it was in the past . 
  thirdly , blizzard makes bad games for the masses so of course they go for free-to-play now . 
  free-to-play is the epitome of feeding shit to the masses . 
   i am pretty sure it has proven to not attract enough players to be worth the risk and effort financially, 
  the opposite . 
  the only good mmorpgs that have ever existed are subscription-based . 
  there 's literally never been a good mmorpg since 2002 . 
   in my opinoin , rs3 is much better than osrs . 
  i 've played rs since 2001 , so i 've played classic , rs2 , rs3 , and then went back played osrs as well for a bit , but nostalga does n't make the grind any more enjoyable when i know there are better things out there in rs3 . 
  ah classic , people dismissing osrs as ` nostalgia ' even though that 's completely unfounded . 
  osrs is n't more popular than rs3 because of nostalgia , but because it is a much better game ( or was , until they ruined it by adding exactly the sorts of ` features ' that ruined rs3 ) . 
   what makes rs3 better to me ? 
  i 'd say there are two major factors . 
  quality of life and pvm . 
  ` quality of life ' is a name that people who do n't understand game design give to features that reduce the interactions people have with the world . 
  ` quality of life ' are not about anyone 's quality of life , they 're an aid to lazy players that do n't contribute positively to games ' communities . 
  the more ` quality of life ' so-called features game developers add to their games , the less sticky and popular those games become . 
  wow 's subscriptions dropped through the floor the moment they added crap like lfd and lfr . 
   first are the quality of life changes to rs available in rs3 . 
  for example , the skilling action interface automatically crafting every item in your inventory rather than having to click a needle , click a leather , select what to craft ... repeat ... click an herb , click a vial ... over and over again , it 's just unnecessary repetition that is not fun . 
  it clearly is fun , given that runescape was far more popular when this was how the game was played . 
  the game playing itself is stupid . 
  the game used to give you options : you could do the method that makes money , the method that can be done semi-afk , or the method that gets higher xp but costs more gp . 
  with the game so simplified , there 's really no choice now , there 's always a best option . 
   bank presets are amazing, 
  they 're just the game playing itself for you .
