  they reduce opportunities for players to actually master things in the game when the game just does everything slightly fiddly for itself . 
  they are like if counterstrike added grenade guides and showed exactly where to throw smokes and flashes for maximum effect : yes you might claim that aiming yourself is ` boring ' and ` unnecessary ' and that learning and practicing the smokes is n't the ` real gameplay ' which is actually the shooting , but you 're ** wrong ** and you 're wrong on this too . 
   soul split , blood necklaces , legendary pets , summoning pets and many other things that allow you to extend trips to bosses or slayer training for so much longer allowing you to do more of what you enjoy , less not fun stuff like running to the bank to restock . 
  running to the bank to restock is part of the game . 
  using up resources in order to fight monsters is what keeps the economy of the game in balance . 
  fighting monsters is * far * too easy now , and it 's by a gigantic margin the easiest way to make money . 
  rs3 is a game that involves fighting monsters to make money and spending ludicrous amounts of money to skill up . 
  fighting monsters is basically the only viable money-making method . 
  skilling up is usually unprofitable because people want to pay gp for xp . 
  there 's just no demand for the products of skilling , which is a massive problem , due to poor design . 
  it used to be different , but the ge and massive power creep ruined gameplay and economic balance . 
   second , the pvm ( pve ) , with ability based combat you can have much more interesting and engaging boss encounters . 
  runescape has never been about intricate combat . 
  that 's not the point of the game . 
  runescape is a game about exploring a world , taking part in a world , roleplaying , quests , and skilling . 
  the game is grindy and repetitive and the people that like that like it . 
  it 's about a totally different set of skills : armour set switching , weapon switching , using specs properly , learning monsters , etc. 
  now it 's all about button mashing action bars . 
  the new combat system is a wow clone . 
  prayer switching was much higher skill than anything the new wow-style combat has ever had . 
  the main problem with rs3 is that it has an awful , awful toxic player culture that cares only about one thing : efficiency . 
  this attitude has filtered into the development of the game is a very negative way , and now everything is developed through that filter . 
  the game developers do n't try to fix it , they encourage it . 
  they have designed the smithing and mining rework ( has that come out yet ? ), 
  basically entirely out in the open , and if you watch their discussion/design/q & a videos , etc. 
  you see that they talk about it like it 's a fucking maths test . 
  it 's all about efficiency rates and terrible crunchy mechanical bullshit . 
  it 's not about the feeling of being an adventurer in a world . 
  it 's not about anything like that . 
  it 's just a bunch of pandering to people who think that runescape is about killing bosses . 
   it has a large variety of content that is accessible and fun at many level ranges , you do n't have to be maxed out to get into bossing now a days , you can do god wars 1 with 70s in your combat skills . 
  nowadays ? 
  in the past the game was much more accessible to low levels . 
  rs3 is almost totally focused on high level content now , much more than in the past , because the massive xp power creep means that everyone gets to high levels much more quickly . 
  osrs 's appeal has nothing to do with nostalgia . 
  if it did , everyone would play rsc instead . 
  but they do n't , because osrs is better . 
  yeah the main problem is that both games have fucking awful communities . 
  the rs3 community is worse , because they have ruined the game by focusing everything through this ludicrous lens of efficiency efficiency efficiency and the developers ignore everything about the game except that . 
  the developers spend more time on xp rates than making the game fun to play . 
  the osrs community sucks because it 's a bunch of 14-year-olds that watch twitch streams on their phones all day while at school , who have no idea what made runescape actually good in 2007 , and have voted over time to basically make all the same mistakes that 2007scape was meant to revert , starting with the ge . 
   osrs on the otherhand is n't meant for casuals as the time you get a single max level in rs3 ( 99 for most skills ) it 'd take probably 3 times longer to get in osrs . 
  however osrs is great if you love grinding/old mmorpgs where it actually took months to get `` end game '' stuff . 
  that 's exactly the viewpoint that makes me hate everything about runescape these days . 
  runescape is ** not ** about getting 99s !, 
  that 's not the point of the game . 
  stop playing like it 's the point of the game . 
   pvp however is basically whoever rolls the highest of the random number generator . 
  it 's an rpg . 
   however , play as an ironman and you 'll have a great time . 
  that defeats the entire point of mmorpgs . 
  your account is literally required to not interact with others . 
   if you want a lot of quality of life/convenient things like teleports, 
  why would anyone want those ? 
   albion is n't p2w , you can buy currency, 
  these statements are contradictory, 
   could you explain more what you mean about the abilities . 
  to put it in perspective , i used to play a full mage for the pvp . 
  it has action bars . 
  it 's a wow clone . 
   mmorpgs take a lot longer due to the size of the world, 
  no they do n't . 
  single-player rpgs often have worlds as big if not bigger than mmorpg worlds . 
  single-player vs. mmo has no impact on world size . 
  there are lots of mmorpgs ( imo terrible ones because of this ) that have tiny worlds that are n't even properly open ( loading screens etc. ), 
   and the many possibilties regarding player interaction, 
  as a software developer i can tell you , this is n't any harder in an mmorpg than any other sort of multiplayer game . 
   also bugs are much more hostile since they put some players above others which isnt true for single player, 
  that just does n't make sense sorry . 
  mmorpgs tend to be much more publicly and visibly buggy than single-player rpgs . 
  this is common . 
  clearly mmorpg developers are not putting any sort of special effort into avoiding bugs . 
   the wow playerbase ? 
  or the playerbase in general ? 
  if playerbase in general , you cant account `` 60 million players '' of a f2p mmo as active players , nost of them are just sub lvl 10 account corpses . 
  wow 's playerbase is irrelevant . 
  the sort of people that play wow , the sort of people that play f2p mmorpgs ... they 're just not relevant . 
  they 're not part of the equation . 
  nobody talking about making a game like uo expects or needs or even particularly wants those people to play . 
  the number of people with access to the internet and good enough internet to play mmorpgs is * drastically * higher than it was 15 years ago . 
  compare the number of people with internet access good enough to enjoy playing mmorpgs in 2001 to 2017 . 
  i mean really , it 's absurd how much bigger the potential market is . 
   as you say . 
  2002 ... do you see the damn point ? 
  2002 is a millenial in games industery . 
  this prooves that there is no market / not a market worth riskining it . 
  otherwise there would have been companies to do it . 
  no , it does n't prove anything of the sort . 
  game publishers , big ones , are incredibly conservative . 
  why do you think assassin 's creed and call of duty and battlefield are so similar year to year ? 
  why do you think that almost every mmo that comes out is so similar to all the previous ones ? 
  they 're very conservative with their money . 
  if you want innovation , you need to look at indie games . 
  and hey guess what , some of that is coming . 
  unfortunately indies seem more interesting in making money peddling nostalgic trash than innovating these days . 
   f2p mmos on the other hand made a shitload of money = better market, 
  that does n't mean they 're the only viable game . 
  this is the problem with this discussion . 
  if you are a game publisher and you have the opportunity to make a derivative , proven , money-making f2p tera clone , or you have the opportunity to make an innovative , risky , p2p * good * game , what do you pick ? 
  the first one , every single time , even if the latter is totally viable .
