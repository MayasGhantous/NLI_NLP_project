  it 's not that the latter is going to lose money . 
  it 's that you make even more money by just making more of the easy , conservative , derivative , boring , uninnovative option . 
  it applies to all genres . 
  there 's a reason basically all fpses that come out are either halo clones or cod clones . 
  they 're safe . 
  they still make plenty of money being uncreative and uninnovative . 
  that does n't mean it 's impossible to make a successful fps that is n't a halo or cod clone . 
  it does n't mean it 's impossible to make a successful rpg that is n't a skyrim clone . 
  but it 's not an almost guaranteed way of making money . 
  if you go into it wanting to make a good game , you can . 
  it 's viable . 
  but publishers do n't say `` we want to make great games , what 's a viable way to do this ? '', 
  they say `` we want to make as much money as possible , what 's the most efficient , least risky , most conservative , most safe way to make billions of dollars ? '', 
  are you intentionally missing the point ? 
   we 're talking about mmos , are n't we ? 
  being an mmorpg has absolutely nothing at all to do with it . 
  mmorpgs are n't special . 
  they 're not harder to make than other games . 
  they 're not easier . 
  no game is actually difficult to make . 
  it 's the art assets , voice acting and advertising that makes games expensive , which is genre-agnostic . 
   none of these indie games are mmorpgs or mmos . 
  though after several years in development and a few hundred millions later in sales minecraft can probably be considered one . 
  it does n't matter whether they 're mmorpgs . 
  indie development is viable . 
  that means indie mmorpg development is viable , including pay-to-play indie mmorpg development . 
  the issue is not that making mmorpgs is some special difficult thing . 
  the issue is that you have to have genuinely interesting , innovative , new , creative ideas to make a successful p2p mmorpg . 
  bdo is n't the sort of game to play if you want to look at it . 
  it 's a very ugly game . 
  it also does n't have exploring . 
  you follow a trail everywhere like all modern rpgs . 
  is this is a joke ? 
  it looks the same but with slightly different lighting . 
  it 's not isometric . 
  i would probably play this game if it did n't have such a ... chunky artstyle . 
  chunky is really the best way to describe it i think . 
  i genuinely think that rs2 has better aesthetics . 
  the people that play current mmos just are n't the sort of people that would be interested in games that are actually good . 
  it sounds rude , but if you play current mmos and like them you do n't like mmorpgs . 
  you are n't the sort of people that would like uo . 
  trying to attract the existing mmo audience to a new , good , sandbox , open world , ** true rpg ** mmorpg would be pointless . 
  they want to play hack-and-slash action-combat button-mashing asian games with massively overdone particle effects . 
  they do n't want to play a western-style game , they do n't want to play a game with a good economy , they demand ` quality of life ' features that make the game play itself , they hate player interaction , they hate penalties for failure . 
  i 'll just copy and paste what i said elsewhere :,

  wow being popular does n't make mmorpgs as a whole popular . 
  it 's an outlier to a massive extent . 
  cs indeed requires skill and strategy , but that 's unrelated to whether or not it 's mainstream . 
   the lack of instant satisfaction seems to be a big issue, 
  i totally disagree . 
  the whole problem with mmorpgs today is that they are entirely designed around instant gratification . 
  they drop rewards * constantly * , they never really challenge the player , and they are far too easy . 
  mmorpgs need * much less * instant gratification . 
  rewards lose their meaning and impact when they 're so frequent . 
  i find it quite funny that there are two top-level replies nearly right next to each other , one saying ` not enough instant gratification ' and the other saying ` too much instant gratification ' . 
   games like gw2 and bdo have arguably some of the best action combat in the genre at the moment and most people note that as what 's needed but i just ca n't get into it as an old school player . 
  personally action combat is just unplayable garbage for me . 
  button mashing is n't fun . 
  it does n't help that they 're just so damn easy . 
  yeah and not every ability needs to be a competitive pvp ability for example . 
  look at a game like magic : the gathering . 
  lots of the cards are n't tournament-viable competitively great cards . 
  they 're fun for other reasons . 
  maybe they produce a really cool combo with some other card . 
  the combo is n't good enough to be competitively viable , but when you 're just playing for fun the risks of failing are nonexistent , it 's not like you 're paying a tournament entry fee . 
  you 're playing at home against a sibling or friend , it does n't matter if your combo only works once in every ten games . 
  every time it works it puts a massive grin on your face . 
  every time it does n't , you want to try again and see if it works . 
  and there are other cards , which are just big and awesome and powerful . 
  and there are cards that are super synergistic , they form a deck all around a particular mechanic . 
  this makes it easy for new players to see decks . 
  they might not have a nuanced enough understanding of the game to build the sorts of decks that people play in tournaments , but the game gives you really obvious decks almost automatically : there 's usually some way to throw together 40 elves creatures , spells that buff elves , spells that do things based on the number of elves you control , and resources , that you can build an elves deck . 
  it might be a bad deck , but it 's something a new player can obviously see . 
  why do n't mmorpgs do this ? 
  not with cards , obviously , but with abilities . 
  why this slimming down of abilities ? 
  i liked when i could get abilities like banish demon or grow plant or whatever . 
  yes they might only be very situationally useful , but they 're super useful when they are . 
  they 're fun to have . 
  they make you really feel like a warlock or a druid or whatever . 
  magic players learnt a long time ago not to expect every card to be useful to them . 
  you trade with others who find those cards useful . 
  sorry if i ruin it for you , but watch the video and notice the texture pop-in . 
  this is indeed exactly like music . 
  mmorpgs were like punk , and then green day ( wow ) came along and now they 're mainstream , dumbed down for the mainstream , and reviled by people that liked it before they became mainstream , but also by people that found the original stuff afterwards and realised how much better it was . 
  that really does n't have anything to do with pop-in . 
  watch as he rides the horse at the very beginning . 
  the objects popping into view are very distracting and obvious . 
  i absolutely agree . 
  mmog does not stand for ` massive multiplayer online game ' . 
  it stands for ** massively ** multiplayer online game . 
  massively is an adverb , it modifies the adjective ` multiplayer ' . 
  no , not ` massive multiplayer online ' . 
  ** massively ** multiplayer online . 
  that 's not the same thing .
