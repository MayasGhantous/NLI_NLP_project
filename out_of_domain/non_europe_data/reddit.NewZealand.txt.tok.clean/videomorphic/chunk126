  mmog does n't mean ` game that is massive , multiplayer , and online ' . 
  it means ` game that is ** massively multiplayer ** online ' . 
  cs is not an mmofps . 
   alright one last time since i 'm a sucker for bait . 
  2 people may be in one game of chess but there could be 1 million games at the same time . 
  exactly . 
  that 's why it 's not massively multiplayer . 
  only two people play at once . 
   let me ask you if wow died and only 2 people played , is it no longer an mmorpg ? 
  no , because that talks about the potential . 
  yes it 's still an mmorpg , and it 's still an mmo . 
  the point is that many people can play at once . 
   what i linked said `` simultaneously '' , you are mistaking that for meaning you have to see the people . 
  me and you can both be playing cs/ow/wf and not see each other . 
  you do n't understand the point at all . 
  and that has nothing to do with whether or not cs is an mmo . 
  it is n't one . 
  that actually is an mmofps though . 
  do n't be trite , it does n't suit you . 
  the term is not ` massive ' . 
  it 's * massively multiplayer * . 
  there 's nothing outdated about it either . 
  there 's a clear distinction between massively multiplayer persistent worlds and regular multiplayer games . 
  also in 1997 there were several mmorpgs . 
  you are wrong . 
  mmo does not mean `` popular multiplayer game '' . 
  the term is not ` massive ' . 
  it 's * massively multiplayer * . 
  the game 's popularity is not the issue . 
  the point is a * persistent open world * . 
  the point is n't whether people do those things but whether they can do those things . 
  those people are wrong . 
  crowfall 's worlds are absolutely persistent . 
  they are n't eternally persistent , but they 're absolutely persistent . 
   to use an example that this sub might like , gw2 is instanced . 
  large zones , yes , but not fully open world . 
  by your definition , this makes it not an mmo . 
  rubbish . 
  it 's absolutely an mmorpg . 
   90 % + of the features that a full mmo has . 
  the only thing that is missing is open world . 
  that 's essentially the one defining feature of mmos . 
  that 's like calling a game an fps ` except for the only thing : it is n't first-person ' . 
  mmorpg stands for massively multiplayer online rpg . 
  not massive . 
  massively . 
  there 's nothing meaningless about roguelike today . 
  it has a very strict definition that people still use . 
  persistent open worlds are a required part of the definition of mmo . 
  fewer . 
  sadly they do n't exist . 
  few games are anything like runescape , including runescape , which is a shadow of its former self . 
   if you like doing other tasks like crafting fishing exploring buy it . 
  those activities are braindead and terrible in bdo . 
   disagree 3/5 , and ur making it seem worse than it is xd . 
  that 's literally impossible . 
  bdo can not be made to seem worse than it is , given that it 's not really possible for any game to be worse than bdo . 
  congratulations on not understanding the term ` pay to win ' . 
  it does n't mean ` you have to spend money ' . 
  it means you * can * spend money on things that are n't ** purely ** cosmetic . 
  there 's nothing obsolete about it . 
  i 'll repeat myself . 
  the point is n't whether people do those things but whether they can do those things . 
  yes it 's still an mmo . 
  because you can do those things . 
  even if you do n't , you can . 
   combine that with the fact that people just do n't play mmos the same way they did back then and you start to see why trying to do a time-machine-like trip back to the birth of the game just would n't work out . 
  ignoring the rest of your comment ( which is very accurate ) , this is just wrong . 
  the meme that people today are * soooo * different from people a decade ago and gaming is just * sooo * totally different , maaan . 
  no , fuck that . 
  it 's wrong . 
  yeah . 
  the reason people hate soe is n't that they fuck up games , it 's that they fuck up amazing games . 
  if they were fucking up trash like bdo or rift or other crap like that , nobody would really care . 
  it 's the companies that fuck up brilliant games like eq , swg , planetside , etc. 
  that people really hate . 
  trion is another example . 
  nobody really hated them too much until they destroyed archeage , which many people loved , and now they 're despised . 
  crowfall is a bad example , because the worlds are persistent . 
  they do n't last * forever * , but they 're definitely persistent worlds . 
  persistent does n't mean they last forever . 
  crowfall is an mmorpg . 
  gw2 is an mmorpg . 
  warframe is not an mmoanything . 
   secondly , on the note of gw2 , that was exactly my point . 
  the op used ` not an open world ' as a qualifier for an mmo . 
  thus , with that logic , gw2 and every other instanced mmo is slashed because of their narrow-mindedness . 
  similarly , i do consider gw2 an mmorpg . 
  it 's just that by the op 's terms , it would n't be one . 
  hence why i used it as an example . 
  gw2 is open world . 
  sharding players across worlds does n't make a game not open world . 
  the world is open , you can move around in it . 
  op 's terms absolutely recognise gw2 as an open world and an mmorpg . 
  that does n't mean warframe is one . 
  i know , right ? 
  they phase stormwind when it 's full of players , it must totally be not an mmorpg !!!!!, 
  no , you did n't . 
  you claimed it , but you 're wrong . 
  your claim is incorrect .
