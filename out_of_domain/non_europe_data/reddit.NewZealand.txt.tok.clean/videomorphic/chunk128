  which is weird , because they did a fair few things wrong as well ... 
  in runescape , each account has just one character . 
  there is no distinction between an account and a character . 
  they 're the same thing . 
  if you want each player to have one character , this is the natural way of doing it . 
  do n't make people delete characters . 
  if they want another character , they can just make a second character/account . 
  i do n't think you should disallow people from having another account , either . 
  but do what runescape did : make it against the rules for accounts to interact with each other if they are both owned by the same person . 
  you can detect this pretty easily , just be careful about things like siblings/friends/partners sharing ip addresses . 
   the biggest issue is that it doubles up the gap between `` high effort '' and average players . 
  rather than having 10 alts that meet all his needs , it will become more common that people dual box . 
  over time , it becomes almost necessary to do that to stay competitive . 
  you can see this in archeage ( does n't limit characters but labor points are account wide and led to the same problem ) . 
  that 's bad design . 
  there should be no benefit to two accounts with one character each vs. one account with two characters on it , imo . 
  there needs to be a balance between the need for new players to start off with * some * resources with the need to make sure that players ca n't just create loads of accounts to get their resources . 
  ignoring things like box prices , i think the best way to do this is to make sure that the profit from immediately selling the starting resources of a new character divided by the time it takes to make a character and send them through the tutorial is less than the rate at which a reasonably proficient player can make money already . 
  the other issue you mention , multi-boxing ( in the sense of playing multiple characters * at once * ) is relatively easy to detect and should be against the rules . 
  temp ban the first time , permanent afterwards , or whatever your system is . 
   people who only want to play one character already have that option but some people are addicted to rolling alts . 
  still , a third group of players would prefer to play only one character but lack the `` will power '' to do it without enforced mechanics . 
  i suspect that most people that roll tonnes of alts do so because they find their main character is getting boring . 
  frankly , i think that 's because most mmorpgs today are pretty boring . 
  they just are n't very sticky on a social level and they 're not mechanically or narratively interesting enough to keep players by making them interested in the game itself . 
  it 's not hard to prevent people from logging into multiple accounts at once . 
  they 'll be connected from one ip with multiple accounts at once . 
   but how it 's better than alowing to have multiple characters on teh same account ? 
  instead of allowing it directly , the game allows it with some additional actions required ( such as creating a new account ) ) . 
  it 's an additional barrier , and it really sends the message that you want players to focus on one character without explicit saying it . 
   hmm , interesting idea about restricting interaction , but practically it 's not possible to implement . 
  even if i have 100 % correct interaction detection , what about some brokers/agents , or just friends who can help to transfer stuff from one character to another . 
  well people will break the rules . 
  it 's no different from banning rmt . 
  it 's still usually possible , but you can detect the simple methods and that 's usually enough to stop most of it . 
  transferring items between two of your own accounts via another player in rs was pretty grey area . 
   the best way to make players stick to one character is by making sure that sticking to one character provides many advantages over having alts . 
  i absolutely agree . 
  no technical limitation will ever work perfectly , and a lot of the solutions ( including the solution i proposed ) have edge cases . 
  the way to do it is to remove the incentive rather than punishing players for doing what you are incentivising them to do . 
  okay , i did n't know that about b&s . the fact remains that runescape 's abilities on its action bars and its new combat system is very similar to wow . 
  no , again , you miss the point . 
  massive and multiplayer are n't separate . 
  it 's not massive , multiplayer , online , game . 
  it 's * massively multiplayer * . 
  massively many people are playing at once and interacting with each other in a single world . 
  that 's what mmo has always meant . 
  okay , so you 're just trolling then ? 
  i assume you must be , nobody would seriously claim that an fps and eve online are the same experience in combat . . 
  magic is a very fine game . 
  i have spent thousands of dollars on my collection and i enjoy it immensely . 
  i have an mtgo collection and a paper collection . 
  i play both a lot and i have no problem with spending money on magic . 
  but magic is an extraordinarily expensive product . 
  it 's not a hobby , quite frankly . 
  it just is n't . 
  it 's a product . 
  it 's more like a computer game than it is like hobbyist electronics . 
  yes you can be creative , yes you can come up with different strategies , yes you can create new builds and such , but it 's still a product . 
  and it 's a very expensive product . 
  you have played the games . 
  cool story bro . 
  that does n't mean you 're not trolling . 
  you again do n't get the point . 
  you can go out in the open world . 
  it 's an mmorpg . 
  you ca n't do that in warframe . 
  it 's not an mmorpg . 
  it does n't have a persistent open world . 
  they do n't . 
  wotc is incredibly conservative . 
   i feel as though you 've misunderstood what i meant about creating multiple accounts . 
  it 's nothing to do with starting resources . 
  simply having additional storage space can make a huge difference for a merchant style player . 
  interacting with your own accounts should be a bannable offence . 
   on a side note , the name `` bookclub '' bothers me to no end , but that 's my ocd talking . 
  no it is n't . 
  it 's just you being a sensible person . 
   you do n't get the point . 
  just because the earliest mmos and standard mmos have a large persistent world , does n't mean that by definition that is what an mmo must have . 
  that 's just what standard mmo 's have . 
  that 's quite literally how genres work . 
  genres are n't based on your personal definition of the works in the name of the genre . 
  they 're based on the games in the genre and the points on which they are similar . 
   an mmo is a massive amount of players , interacting with each other ( multi player ) . 
  nowhere in that is a large persistent world listed . 
  oh come on . 
  and i suppose every game is an rpg , because in every ** game ** you ** play ** a ** role ** ? 
  the idea that every popular multiplayer game is an mmorpg is moronic . 
   times have changed . 
  even a game like ffxiv is just interconnected player capped maps , not this large persistent open world mmo . 
  interconnected player-capped maps are still a persistent world . 
   an mmo is all about large scale player interaction . 
  warframe has that . 
  no it does n't . 
  ` interaction ' does n't mean ` go off to an instance with them ' . 
   as a player , i hate artificial restrictions . 
  if player able to create and log in 2 characters -- then why it 's restricted to interact ? 
  because it 's cheating ... 
  characters should only be able to do what they can actually do , not make lots of throwaway characters to exploit .
