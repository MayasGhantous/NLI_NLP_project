  oh yeah a combo you can interact with just by playing cards that were already good !, 
  what a terribly unfair deck . 
   it came down to one point , which the splinter player always chose due to flash , where the opponent either had a piece of removal or not . 
  that 's a boring game of magic imho . 
  oh yeah man , removing creatures is so fucking hard in modern . 
  it 's not like there 's a plethora of good removal spells in the format . 
   even if you had the removal it might just push their clock back one turn because chances are they had another creature or the smoothing cards to acquire one . 
  if they have an extra creature you have an extra removal spell . 
   i know you mention this fantasy of 2 for 1 ing the twin player , but 9/10 that is a misplay on the non twi s part because they should play around pact of negation . 
  the only time it is not a misplay is if they have seen the twin players hand . 
  again , you 're just talking utter rubbish . 
  nobody played pact of negation in splinter twin . 
  you are ignorant . 
  ` discrimination ' is not defined by law . 
  piss off, 
  self-loathing plebs, 
  because they are n't doing a very good job . 
  read the thread more closely, 
  no , there are n't . 
  the world is not ` overpopulated ' , and first world countries certainly are n't either . 
   especially picking on overseas investors . 
  anyone that is n't permanently resident in the uk should n't even be able to own property in the uk , for fuck 's sake . 
   opening up the green belt to development, 
  urban sprawl is not a solution to a fucking housing crisis . 
  yeah they 're still actively pursuing literally the entire point of their party 's existence . 
   also , we want a border poll . 
  please ignore hat this is also in violation of the gfa, 
  how on earth would it be a violation of the gfa ? 
  does the gfa not say that it 's up to northern ireland to decide where to go , democratically ? 
  the british government is meant to be neutral , and going into coalition with a unionist party is not neutral , that 's what violates the gfa . 
  they mean the same thing . 
  imo , ban the sale of all property to anyone that is n't a permanent resident and make it illegal to not offer a property for market rental if nobody lives there . 
   one sentence ( a ) says that by negotiating currently in this way , she has already broken the gfa . 
  no it does n't . 
  it says ** if ** . 
  it says if ** in the title ** . 
  you 're a cheating scumbag and you deserve to be shot . 
  worthless scum devaluing everyone else 's qualifications . 
  that does n't actually work . 
  you ca n't devalue a currency by just printing it and leaving it in a warehouse somewhere . 
  it has to enter the economy and cause inflation . 
   it was no an all in combo deck . 
  i never said that . 
  you might have misread and misinterpreted what i said , but that 's on you . 
  this historical rewrite that the deck was a tempo deck first is just false . 
  it was a tempo deck first . 
  this is n't a ` historical rewrite ' . 
  it was the common opinion * when the deck was still legal * . 
   the deck was heavily reliant on the combo . 
  if it was n't then why is the deck no longer around ? 
  they did n't ban any of what would be considered the `` tempo '' portion . 
  rubbish . 
  the whole reason to play the combo was that you generated tempo by forcing your opponent to leave mana open . 
   so now you counter your prior argument and prove mine . 
  so , they did n't jam the combo first chance except against every tier 1 deck in the format . 
  ok bud ... keep telling yourself the deck took skill to pilot . 
  you did n't jam the combo the first chance you got except against ** other combo decks ** . 
  ` unfair ' does n't mean ` good ' , it means ` combo ' . 
   yes they did . 
  you were just late to the party . 
  probably do n't buy into a deck until it 's tier 1 . 
  the very first time twin won a pt was philly in 2011 with 3 pacts . 
  the first mtg salvation primer called for 2 of them . 
  nice work trolling though cause you obviously have no fucking idea what you are talking about . 
  2011 is irrelevant . 
  of course it was all-in combo back then . 
  that 's not the deck that got banned . 
  the deck that got banned was the deck that existed in when it got banned , which was the much more tempo-oriented version . 
  you 're great , you know that right ? 
  is that a fucking ad at the bottom of the main menu ? 
  seriously ? 
  holy fuck that makes me angrier than the microtransactions . . 
  wow it 's not like you to get downvoted, 
  part of me really wants to play some sort of insanely greedy 4c intuition lands shit where you play that deck with the punishing fire combo ... 
  what is temur delver ? 
  well . . they literally do n't . 
   if it 's a gui app in most cases you wo n't notice the lag, 
  you might not . 
  most people * will * . 
  there 's no deck called ` temur delver ' . 
  are you thinking of canadian threshold ? 
  i 'm pretty sure the only people that call rug decks ` temur ' are people that started playing in ktk block . . 
  probably thought that it seemed a bit self-puffery-y . 
  wow that 's close , good job . 
  grove is a fine land . 
  it does n't seem that bad . 
  there are other ways for your opponent to gain life in cube . 
  if you have a grove then i 'd pick a punishing fire over a mediocre card just for the sideboard even . . 
  what is it about being a squash player that you feel makes susan devoy 's perspective on social issues particularly valuable ? 
   i have n't seen good pve group content without it . 
  wow does n't have good pve group content with it , though . 
  in fact , no game has good pve group content . 
   a tighter , smaller game world ( just eastern kingdoms and kalimdor ) , possibly with fewer zones than the original . 
  absolutely disagree . 
  one of the few good things about vanilla wow was that it had a huge world with lots of different ways to level up . 
  you could level up three or four characters and have almost no overlap in several level ranges . 
  i definitely think just eastern kingdoms , northrend and kalimdor . 
  no outland , no draenor , certainly no pandaria and certainly no broken isles . 
   remove or greatly reduce the influence of class specs , with the goal of having 9-12 unique classes rather than 36 somewhat unique classes . 
  i definitely disagree with this .
