  you could probably get direct entry to second year mathematics ( which would indeed mean you 'd skip past two semester-long mostly-calculus-and-linear-algebra courses out of the three that are mandatory for a mathematics major ) with good enough high school mathematics results . 
  but you would be skipping real content . 
  first year mathematics is n't purely a rehash of high school maths . 
  there 's no reason why mmorpgs ca n't have the same level of mechanical difficulty as dota 2 or league of legends . 
   so , yeah . 
  it 's a different way to grief other players . 
  well . . no . 
  it is n't . 
  how is it a way to ` grief ' other players ? 
  i do n't see how it 's griefing . 
  you 're choosing to go into someone else 's place , that they designed , and you 're trying to take their shit . 
  yeah you might get killed and lose some of your stuff , but that 's the price you pay . 
  you do n't have to do this content . 
  you can stick to developer-provided content . 
  you can stick to killing boars or whatever . 
  you can stay in safe areas . 
  or you can not . 
   what if i want to make my dungeon unbearably difficult ? 
  what if i want to make it impossible to complete ? 
  well , people wo n't do it . 
  people are n't going to take all their best , most expensive gear in to see the deepest depths of player-made dungeons unless they 've done it before and know it has a fair reward . 
  monsters inside dungeons would still have their normal drops . 
  the bonus loot in the chest at the end might be hidden in some way that makes them impossible to get , but :, 
  if there is a mechanic for advertising the possible loot , then you can report them for misrepresenting that , and the developers can deal with it ( these would n't be a dime a dozen , it would be definitely possible for developers to deal with these reports ) , * or *, 
  if there is n't a mechanic for advertising the possible loot , then you still just get all the loot from the monsters you kill anyway . 
   in the sort of system most people suggest , if a dungeon is unreasonably difficult , it will get bad reviews and people wo n't play it . 
  same thing will happen here . 
  if players do n't feel a dungeon is rewarding enough for its difficulty level they 'll do another one . 
   in your system , that wo n't matter because by the time people have figured out the dungeon is broken , the creator will have already looted their corpses . 
  and will take some of their irrelevant items . 
  how is this any different from going into pvp in a wilderness area to duel with someone , and then their friends logging in and killing you ? 
  okay , so you lose some gear , but it 's not like you 're taking your actually good gear . 
  games with full or partial loot pvp are n't like wow where your gear takes months or years to acquire , you basically have one set of it , and it 's basically part of your character . 
  the gear is all degrading , consumable , etc. 
  anyway . 
  okay so they get a set of plate armour . 
  valuable , certainly , but the sort of people going down into dungeons in full plate armour are n't going to miss a set or two of it . 
  well runescape certainly does . 
  see my other post in this thread . 
  \\  complains about devs making their games easier in order to pandering to casual instead of focusing on a niche hardcore audience . 
  \\  dismisses games that are hard as niche as if that 's a bad thing, 
  my post is just specifically about your specific idea , it 's too detailed with too many specifics that i think would have to be ironed out by actually playing the game . 
  my post is about in the context of a general mmorpg , not an mmorpg specifically about this one mechanic . 
  i like the idea of players making dungeons and being pitted against other players delving into them . 
  i 'll go read your post in more detail again now . 
  ** crystals : ** as i understand it , the general goal behind these is that they 're the main resource of the game , right ? 
  your character raids dungeons to get their crystals , and your dungeon generates crystals for you , but then other players can take those crystals , so you have to defend it properly ? 
  ** dungeons : ** basically you can build it . 
  the procedural generation stuff is a bit . . eh . 
  i do n't really see the point . 
  procedural generation is something that is useful for developers , but players do n't need it , the whole point of player-created content is that players are smarter than procedural generation algorithms are . 
  ** elements : ** i ca n't really comment on this , i think it 's something that you would have to try first . 
  i think getting down the basics into a really solid form is good first , then start thinking about expanding it into variants like this . 
  ** guilds : ** essentially the idea is that as well as players having dungeons , guilds could also have dungeons ? 
  presumably there would be some sort of group finder , the dungeons would require communication to play , you 'd meet people and make friends , form guilds , import guilds from other games , etc. 
  guilds could organise , raid dungeons together , but also have a guild dungeon for their guild 's shared resources ? 
  i 'm personally only interested in player-created content of this form in the context of a ` proper ' mmorpg . 
  `` dungeon keeper online '' sorts of ideas are cool , but i 'd rather think about them in the context of a more regular sandbox mmorpg that happened to have player-owned housing , guild-owned housing , etc. 
  that could be used underground ( or not , in fact , as why would dungeons have to be underground ? ) . 
  i think in general your idea is great , though , it 's a good systematised dungeon-keeper-as-a-competitive-multiplayer-game idea . 
  you have some great ideas here , definitely . 
  the idea of the crystals being something you compete over is good . 
  one issue with basing rewards on some sort of algorithmic estimation of dungeon difficulty is that it might be easy to fuck the computer into thinking something is much easier than it really is , making rewards not commensurate with risk . 
  in the context of a sandbox mmorpg , guild fortresses with dungeons are a good idea , but i would n't want players to spend all their time in the guild fortress , not interacting with other players out in the open world . 
  guild fortresses should exist for reasons other than just pomp and glory , i think . 
  the wow garrisons problem ( where they were overused and the open world was underused ) and the runescape clan citadel problem ( where they were completely unused and dead content ) are both issues . 
  the balance is trucky . 
  did you actually read the post i referred to ? 
  runescape is certainly not brainless . 
  brainlessly spamming 11121211111311121111 is brainless . 
  runescape is not brainless . 
  prayer flicking is a skill that requires a lot of practice to reliably get right . 
  it 's easy to learn , hard to master . 
  learning different types of monster , different slayer tasks , etc. 
  and what is required for each , the best strategies , which ones you want to skip and which you want to extend , etc. 
  requires a lot of experience . 
  and of course the quests and puzzles are going to be easy if you use a bloody guide and you 're overlevelled for them . 
  i 've seen so many players say ` omg that quest was so easy ' when they 've done it two weeks after it came out on a very high level combat character while following a guide . 
  i mean come on , what do you expect ? 
  you ... what ? 
  you enjoyed wildstar 's levelling , but you * do n't know if it has real endgame * ? 
  if you define ` real endgame ' as ` mechanically difficult wow clone raids ' then yes , it 's probably got a better endgame than wow , tor , eso , or ffxiv . 
  wildstar 's main problem is that its levelling was shit . 
  well , no , that was its second biggest problem . 
  the biggest is the offputting childish art style . 
  is there any game where non-combat skills are n't brainless to level ? 
  so again , have you read my top-level post in this thread ? 
  so what is difficult then ? 
  is mastering things like using potions , swapping armour sets , accurately clicking on the right spells , potions , food , etc. 
  not difficulty ? 
  is knowledge of a huge variety of monsters and the right way to defeat them not difficulty ? 
  is solving puzzles in quests not difficult ? 
  because it really seems like you 're defining difficulty very restrictively as like . . pure mechanical difficulty , which runescape certainly has some of . 
  tell me osrs pvp does n't require skill and i 'll eat my hat , but if you required that level of mechanical engagement throughout the entire game everyone would literally die of carpal tunnel 3 hours into playing the game . 
  but that does n't seem to be enough . 
  what is a game with difficulty in mmorpgs ? 
  not group content , that 's not difficult , it 's just coordination . 
  it 's a whole lot of things you can do 98 % of the time , but when you have 40 people you have about a 45 % chance of it going well , and when you have 25 people you have about a 60 % chance of everyone succeeding . 
  if group content required any real skill then it would be virtually impossible to complete a raid . 
   what games does n't have power creep ?
