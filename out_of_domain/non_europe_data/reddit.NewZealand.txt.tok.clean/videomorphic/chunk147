  games that sell better than `` endgame '' gear in the store are the ones we should demonize . 
  no we fucking should n't . 
  the ** only ** type of fair and reasonable payment models are :, 
  * subscriptions ( recurring costs ) and, 
  * box prices ( fixed one-time costs - you ca n't just spend spend spend ), 
  if subscriptions are optional then any content you get from paying for a subscription must be totally separated from people that do n't pay them . 
  in runescape , if you take members items into free-to-play worlds , the items are unusuable and give no statistical bonuses . 
  this stops the game from being pay to win . 
  that 's irrelevant . 
  if two players grind their way there , and then one of them buys the armour with real money , they have an advantage . 
  otherwise * nobody would do so * . 
   having money in real life nets no advantage that could not be obtained in game , thus it is not pay to win . 
  that 's not what pay to win means . 
  pay to win means that you ** can ** spend money , not that you ** have to ** . 
  that 's the whole fucking point . 
  you 're literally talking to their marketing department lol . 
  incorrect question . 
  the question is whether you can buy ** anything ** that is n't purely cosmetic . 
  that does n't matter . 
  literally the entire point of playing sandbox games is to accumulate money . 
  if you can buy the money , that defeats the whole purpose . 
  getting gold in wow matters much less ( although it 's still pay to win obviously ) because gold does n't really matter . 
  but gold * really * matters in sandbox games . 
  everyone says that it 's pay to win . 
  it is , by definition . 
  runescape is probably the single game that is the most dependent on having in-game gold . 
  no , that 's not what pay to win means . 
  pay to win does n't mean you have to buy things , it means you * can * buy * anything * that is n't * purely * cosmetic . 
  stop dirtying definitions . 
  that 's irrelevant . 
  that 's nothing to do with pay to win . 
  that 's about whether a game has good gold sinks or not . 
  that 's a quality issue . 
  pay to win is a separate question entirely : is it possible to spend real money in such a way that you 're better off after doing so than you were before , in any possible non-cosmetic way . 
   on the other hand , it sort of works for eve . 
  because people are used to it . 
  a lot of people were extremely upset when it came out , but those players * left the game * . 
  that you do n't hear them complaining now is because they 've moved on . 
   the difference is in a p2w game you 're sort of forced to buy those xp boost or dmg boost potions ( or whatever the p2w shop is selling ) or else you ca n't compete . 
  no , not true . 
  in a pay to win game it 's * possible * to buy non-cosmetic items . 
   it 's not an advantage in a fight, 
  yes it is . 
  if it were n't an advantage , nobody would buy it . 
   if you 're not a fan of it , can you name a popular mmo that has somehow gotten rid of all rmts ? 
  yes , runescape for a very long time had no microtransactions . 
  lots of games do n't have microtransactions . 
  yes , that 's why it 's p2w . 
  but is there even any rpg where gameplay outside of combat is challenging ? 
  i know there are obviously strategy games and first person shooters and plenty of rpgs with challenging combat . 
  and obviously there are strategy games ( management games for example ) with challenging non-combat mechanics , city building , etc. 
  but they 're not rpgs . 
  i 'm not even quizzing you , i 'm not trying to pick apart your argument , i just have no idea what you 're comparing runescape to when you say it 's brainless . 
  if runescape is brainless in combat , then every game is , and if runescape is brainless in non-combat , then . . well . . maybe it is , but so is every game , so why is it a valuable or useful thing to say ? 
  that 's an unfair advantage . 
  if it were n't an advantage , why would anyone * spend the money * ? 
  the game is objectively worse now . 
  pro tip : saying your opinions but with ` objectively ' before them does n't magically make them objective facts . 
  it 's an unfair advantage . 
  pay to win is n't some arbitrary gradation on a scale of unfairness . 
  microtransactions that are n't completely purely cosmetic = pay to win . 
  simple as that . 
  why do n't you just try it and find out ? 
  if you do n't like it , you can just not play it anymore ... 
  any reason why you ignored the other parts of my post ? 
  to be clear , i 'm not trying to shit on your ideas . 
  i really do think they have merit . 
  they 're certainly a hell of a lot more interesting than any aaa mmorpg that 's coming out any time soon , and honestly a lot more interesting than the endless stream of generic pay-to-win kickstarter pvp sandboxes . 
  no , it is n't . 
  it has full hardware-accelerated 3d graphics . 
  2.5 d is when you have a rotating camera with axis-rotating sprites . 
  these were common even just a few years ago for trees in games : basically just a sprite that rotated to face you . 
   what do you call luring players into your impossible dungeon and taking their loot when they die ? 
  is it not griefing ? 
  well , it 's something similar . 
  competition . . ? 
   if they 've already cleared the dungeon with second-rate gear , why would they risk their best gear when they run it again ? 
  and if you do n't bring your best gear to a difficult instance , what 's the point in having it ? 
  showing off how cool you are in the town square ? 
  going into dungeons that you already know you can complete , but doing so more efficiently , for example . 
   so you can loot their bodies , but the loot is n't worth anything . 
  great . 
  where did i say it was n't worth anything ? 
  where do you get these fucking false dichotomies from dude ? 
  either it 's griefing because you 're taking all their shit or it 's worthless ? 
  what about * somewhere in between * ? 
   so every game with membership model that you can play as f2p is pay to win because you can buy that membership ? 
  no , because in runescape for example you can not use members-only items or members-only skills on free-to-play servers . 
  anyone on a free-to-play server can only act as if they are a free player and only gets free-to-play items and bonuses . 
  runescape was fair because you did n't get membership in order to pwn poor noobs , you got it in order to gain access to additional content : more quests , more skills , more monsters , more areas , more items , more training methods , more everything . 
  nowadays , in modern mmos , the only point of paying money is to have an unfair advantage over other players : getting stuff they have to work to get . 
   if you do n't like p2w there wo n't be any mmo 's anymore that you dont consider p2w . 
  that 's not the point . 
  i do n't care . 
  ashes of creation promises not to be pay to win , it might be fun . 
  or i can play runescape classic , which has no pay-to-win elements . 
  or i can play a game with mild but not terrible pay to win . 
  or i can play other games and wait for a good mmorpg . 
  ` pay to win ' does n't change its meaning in order to split mmorpgs down the middle . 
  yeah , pretty much .
