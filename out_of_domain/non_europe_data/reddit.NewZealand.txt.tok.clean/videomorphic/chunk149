  you ca n't just take wow , clone it , and add this and expect it to work . 
  no , it 's not comparative . 
  it 's binary . 
  stupid people do . 
  those people are wrong . 
  go look at the wikipedia page on isometric perspective * in video games * . 
  it agrees with me . 
  you seem more mad than i. 
  either a game is pay to win or it is not . 
  there is no ` pay for convenience ' or ` pay to skip ' or whatever . 
  it 's either ` pay to win ' or not . 
   well there are benefits that can be had by spending money in any mmo . 
  if , and only if , the game is pay to win . 
  no , it does n't . 
  ** all other things being equal ** if you pay money you 'll be at an advantage . 
  running through an old raid solo one-shotting bosses is not ` running old content ' . 
   you are not a fan of mmo 's then , carry on . 
  not a fan of shitty wotlk clones maybe . 
  someone that likes how wow vanilla did something is ` not a fan of mmos ' ? 
  if you want to claim that this was n't the case in vanilla , that 's fine , you 're right . 
  but they had firmly settled on the ` completely invalidate all previous content in the game every time a raid is released ' strategy in wotlk . 
  named after the british tv series which was named after a book , which is about a plot that is very intricate , figuratively a ` house of cards ' . 
  it 's almost like he 's speaking from his own perspective or something, 
   poorly made ( in comparison to rs ), 
  runescape itself is poorly made in comparison to runescape as it was in 2005 . 
  children should n't be on facebook . 
  i do n't make this up off the top of my head mate, 
  stage is pretty narrow . 
  this can copy * anything * . 
  laboratory maniac was a bad kill anyway . 
  doomsday existed before innistrad block and it continues to exist now . 
  tes is an irrelevant deck . 
  you play doomsday over ant because you want to play doomsday . 
  it 's not a ` better deck ' unless you are a * god * with the deck , and even then it 's slow and has other issues . 
  but that 's not the point . 
  doomsday is a deck you play because you think doomsday is awesome , and fun , and exhilarating . 
  why play this when children of korlis exists ? 
  that 's not his idiolect at all . 
  elvish mystic is n't overpowered . 
  your comment rests on the assumption that it is . 
  kithkins are hobbits not dwarves, 
  ` humans ' means humans in magic , not in game of thrones . 
  sol ring is n't really any bombier than any of the stupid chase mythic bombs they print . 
  b-b-b-b-but wat if ur at 5 or les liff !!!?? 
  god i want to open this in draft ... 
  ` problematic ' = ` too strong ' . 
  llanowar elves is n't too strong . 
  llanowar elves is n't problematic . 
  llanowar elves should be in every core set , and so should birds of paradise . 
  it was great in limited . 
  pack 1 , pick 1 , take savor the moment , draft every creature with vigilance . 
  he 's in charge . 
  that means he 's responsible . 
  christ does everything have to be a cycle ? 
  there are way too many cycles in sets imo . 
   a format where you can top 8 a gp with your pet deck even though it 's completly not on the map is in my opinion the dream format . 
  this is all formats . 
  well then the 20th deck is as good as the second . 
  chalice and bridge do n't give you perfect information . 
  why ? 
  that would nerf infect . 
  your comment did n't have anything to do with the point at hand . 
   where the heck were these set designers when we wanted innistrad tribal decks !?!?!? 
  making a much better and more fun standard environment, 
  thoughtseize and inquisition are n't free . 
  gitaxian probe is free . 
  gitaxian probe was a mistake . 
  it made basically every deck 56 cards , and the cycling one people have replaced it with should be banned too . 
  unban [ [ dark depths ] ], 
  i do n't want to be scaled down . 
  the max level should still be 60 . 
  i do n't think it goes in rg lands at all . 
  but while this might not be loam-able it is academy ruins-able , it copies opposing creatures !, 
  { 2 } : copy your tarmogoyf , block . 
  i do n't want the game to only have the content it had in 2006 . 
  2 life is nothing . 
  and it was in more and more decks . 
  death 's shadow started playing it , infect played it , most combo decks played it . 
  gitaxian probe was too good . 
  it 's not black magic to expand a game 's content without raising its maximum level , making the older content obsolete ... 
  because that 's how wow works , and they 're wow clones . 
  5 mbit is n't exactly slow . 
  that 's the problem . 
  it 's ubiquitous , powerful and free . 
  if it were just those things , okay , but it * also * gives perfect information . 
  that pushes it over the edge , especially given it does n't have an important role keeping the format in check like discard does . 
  ** all other things being equal ** . 
  that means that two players are * identical * except one of them then spends money . 
  the player that spends is now ahead . 
  that makes the game pay to win . 
   yes you 're making a continuous variable ( amount of advantage per dollar ) into a binary , but the underlying thing being measured is not binary . 
  it is indeed entirely binary . 
  either it 's pay to win or it is not pay to win . 
   that 's my point is that using your definition , literally everything is p2w . 
   even if you remove all rmt from the game ( not possible ) , i can still pay somebody to teach me how to play , thus reducing the amount of grinding i have to do . 
  omg p2w !!!!!, 
  rmt is not a microtransaction . 
  teaching someone to play is not a microtransaction . 
  you get an advantage over not paying , which is why you pay . 
  otherwise nobody would pay .
