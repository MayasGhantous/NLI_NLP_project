  re-read my comment . 
  ** if mythics are n't worth anything ** then no stores will not open more cases , and they will not drive down the prices of rares . 
  this is all just theoretical , though . 
  it 's been tested and is fair . 
  that 's what should matter imo . 
  not theorising . 
   if mythics are n't worth anything they have an effect on the prices of rares , they push rare prices up . 
  no they leave them where they were before the addition of mythics to the game . 
  holy christ [ [ richard garfield , ph.d. ] ] seems insane . 
  ` play this island as dark depths ' . 
  ` play this island as thespian 's stage ' . 
   other stuff that falls into the same category of `` usually crap , sometimes incredible '' includes top , jitte , tangle wire , etc. 
  when is jitte * ever * crap ? 
  that just forces one person to lose a first-pick to a little girl , right ? 
   as an example , i found out that a coworker also curates a cube , and he showed me his list . 
  he made the following comments :, 
  `` the theme is planeswalkers ... the purpose is to have as many as possible '' ( 5 in each color in a 360 cube , though white had 7 ), 
  `` i took out a lot of redundancy ... 
  i felt like that is boring '', 
  `` i 've been considering removing aggro entirely because it is n't working '', 
  `` i need to remove some of the fetch lands because they end up being over-valued '', 
  `` everyone who has played it felt like it was not well balanced '', 
  hmm , i wonder why ... 
  is he the r&d team at wotc ? 
  is he just describing standard ? 
  it has non-cosmetic microtransactions . 
  if by ` powered cube ' you mean ` combo cube ' , maybe . 
  creature strategies are viable in well-built powered cubes . 
  ` modern-legal ' could work . 
  or ` not banned or restricted in any format ' , which means you can exclude dark depths while including force spike ( modern 's arbitrary limits on legality annoy me greatly , they just make no sense . ), 
  do n't like it ? 
  fuck off then, 
  it 's not ` semantics ' . 
   the people who love calling it a `` world of hats '' are doing the same disservice as the people calling jace a `` mary sue '' . 
  it 's a snarky undermining of the incredible amount of hard work done by our creative team to make cool new worlds . 
  them working hard does n't invalidate the complaints . 
  jace is clearly intended to be a vehicle for stereotypical magic players to insert themselves . 
  brooding , young , male , intelligent , etc. 
  the reality is that they * are * worlds of hats . 
  not all of them , but some of them definitely are . 
  they do n't feel like cohesive worlds , they feel like stereotyped worlds . 
  that would be okay if they did n't try to make the creative out to be more than it is . 
  if it were just a backdrop , mainly shown through flavour text and legendary creature names and a couple of story cards now and again , okay . 
  but they want to make the story the main focus . 
  they want to print gatewatch planeswalkers every block . 
  they want to advertise and sell the game based on the planes . 
  they want us to read the stories on the mothership about these characters . 
  they have to make the worlds feel more like * worlds * . 
   what our worlds are not are hodgepodge worlds with disparate parts that have no connection with one another . 
  but they are . 
  each plane is essentially a disparate part that has no connection to one another . 
   `` but that 's the way the real world is . '', 
  there 's a difference between what works in the real world and what works in stories . 
  real life is often unbelievable through the lens of story . 
  i had umpteen writing classes drive this point home . 
  maro loves talking about his writing classes and his time writing a sitcom and how he took a 1st year of university advertising class and therefore can make statements about psychology , but that does n't mean that he 's the utmost expert on worldbuilding . 
  believable worlds * are * important . 
  verisimilitude * is * important . 
   and even when our worlds have more distinction between the parts , alara and tarkir as examples , there 's a relationship between the parts . 
  tarkir was a good world . 
  it felt different and diverse and interesting . 
  it was a success in this sense . 
  nobody is saying every post-dominaria plane is a failure . 
   here 's my counter argument to those who feel that worlds with lots of unconnected elements make for better worlds . 
  imagine we just clumped two consecutive worlds together . 
  amonkhet and a kaladesh are one world and innistrad and zendikar are one world . 
  and tarkir and theros . 
  the fact that they think that we are asking for them to just push all these stereotyped , boring , homogenous planes together into one plane like it 's fucking world of warcraft with its stupid zones right beside each other with no gradual change between them is kind of the whole reason we do n't like their worldbuilding , frankly . 
  dominaria ** was n't ** a hodgepodge of unrelated elements . 
  it had areas that were one thing and areas that were another thing , but they were related by the * common story of dominaria * . 
  dominaria-wide storylines , dominaria-wide events , characters with influence across the world definitely did exist . 
   here 's my counter argument to those who feel that worlds with lots of unconnected elements make for better worlds . 
  imagine we just clumped two consecutive worlds together . 
  amonkhet and a kaladesh are one world and innistrad and zendikar are one world . 
  and tarkir and theros . 
  if they did some sort of ` planes colliding ' thing where ( say ) ravnica and zendikar collided with each other and we got a set that situated the guilds of ravnica dealing with being in a world with insane moving wild roiling lands and shit , that would be * amazing * . 
  and i mean zendikar when i say zendikar , not zeldrazikar . 
  if they just stated they were both on the same plane but did n't have them interact , then that would be exactly the same as what they do now , which is have them both in the same multiverse but not interacting . 
  it would have absolutely zero influence on anything . 
  it 's essentially what they 're * already * doing . 
   we did it though and in a way that is both respectful of what came before and productive in moving forward with a world that becomes part of our stable of worlds that does n't stick out like a sore thumb . 
  old fans , please have faith . 
  we too love dominaria . 
  do they ? 
  do they love dominaria ? 
  i 'm not sure they do . 
  i think they feel that the game is slowing down its growth and losing older players and they want a nostalgia set to bring them back and improve quarterly growth . 
   new players being frustrated that they do n't get the references . 
  none of the cards required you to ` get the references ' . 
  the references were * references * . 
  the cards worked perfectly well on their own , they were just magic cards . 
  new players do n't give a shit about the story , they 're too busy trying to work out which card is better to pick in this pack while packs are piling up to their right because this is their first draft . 
   ... complexity ... 
  is irrelevant to the discussion of whether time spiral was a good setting . 
  the issue is not that he is ` pushed ' , the issue is that he 's a boring character whose every character trait is chosen to make him more ` identifiable ' for the target audience of moody teenage males that think they 're more intelligent than everyone else . 
  the fact is that they can be * willing * to make it a great set as much as they like . 
  they ca n't just decide to make a set a success and ` woohoo it 's a success ' . 
  they want * every * set to be a success , obviously . 
  so saying they 're going to try really hard or that they 're willing to give it their all ... it 's just nonsense . 
  it 's not like they pick a few sets to make really good and then just half-arse the rest .
