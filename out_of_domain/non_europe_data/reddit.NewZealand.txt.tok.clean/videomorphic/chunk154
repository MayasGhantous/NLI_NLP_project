  he 's wrong , though . 
  he can talk about philosophy all he likes , but the reality is that green has often got flying . 
  if hornet queen is a break , then * breaks do n't matter , as it was still printed * . 
  why would fm radio jammers be illegal ? 
  the page literally says :, 
   since the expansion of magic : the gathering 's focus to outside of dominaria , most planes seem to follow this sort of pattern . 
  for instance , kamigawa resembles feudal japan in culture and aesthetics , mirrodin is made almost entirely from metal , innistrad is an darker version of uber wald , and zendikar is an adventurer 's paradise with constantly-shifting landscapes and an endless number of unexplored ruins . 
  as an example . 
  as i said , tv tropes has a reputation for narrowing down definitions to mean very specific things . 
  they 've taken the idea of it as referring to culture specifically , but it 's very commonly used to mean what people are using it to mean in this thread . 
  which is in fact the point . 
  who cares , even if it is * technically * not the right meaning of the word ? 
  you know what people mean when they say it . 
  maro knows what people mean when they say it . 
  they know what they mean when they say it . 
  i am aware of how the colour pie works . 
  but green * does * get vindicate ( if it gives them a creature or a land ) . 
   to put it another way , `` green has had flying before '' does not mean `` flying is part of green 's color pie . '', 
  green has * consistently * got flying creatures throughout the modern era of magic . 
  i 'm not saying it happens all the time , but it 's not verboten . 
  the colour pie is * not * as restrictive as maro seems to think it is , and he is n't the ultimate boss and final arbiter of things at wotc . 
  he does n't always get his way . 
  he 's the most vocal and most public member of r&d and so we get his perspective the most . 
  but there are clearly people at wotc that do not agree with his views on the colour pie , and why should they ? 
  he did n't invent it . 
  he is n't their boss . 
  we never hear from them , but we see their work , and * that * is what matters . 
  a professional screenwriter of a single stereotyped and generic sitcom . 
  the guy is * right * though . 
  why could n't innistrad and zendikar have been continents on the same world , for example ? 
  the idea that ` smashing two worlds together ' would be the same is just . . silly . 
  innistrad got influenced by the eldrazi , right ? 
  like , that 's sort of the point . 
  edit : please read https://www.reddit.com/r/magictcg/comments/6ijjpe/some_people_are_just_being_flat_out_rude/dj6vr3m/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/magictcg/comments/6ijjpe/some_people_are_just_being_flat_out_rude/dj6vza7/ rather than just downvoting me to oblivion . 
  i might not have made it clear in this post , but my point is that the worlds * do * feel isolated from each other and stereotyped . 
  they have little or no connection to previous worlds , except popping some characters that appeared in previous worlds into new ones . 
  part of the reason for this is that only planeswalkers can move between planes . 
  if they made a block set on brand new plane x specifically in brand new area a , themed after the british isles , why not then have a block set on the same plane * but a new area * , and actually make them interact ? 
  the celtic/irish-influenced culture from the first block could invade a brand new area b , making it feel like a partial continuation in story from the previous block and like a real world . 
   common probably warps limited too much, 
  * vomits *, 
  being able to actually answer your opponent 's creatures is * not * overpowered . 
  funnily enough it 'd be fine . 
  it might actually be a good idea . 
  bolt in standard again , props up game a bit after a slow period , and designed with the intent of rotating out of standard in 18 months so who cares if it warps it a bit for only 18 months, 
  does n't warp limited at mythic, 
  is n't too expensive because it was a common . 
  now obviously it should be a common . 
  but it would n't be * awful * as a mythic . 
  unplayable, 
   he actually is the ultimate boss and final arbiter of magic design . 
  did i say ` design ' ? 
  i said ` things at wotc ' . 
  design is not development , design is not r&d . he 's in charge of design , nothing else . 
   he just does n't do a final run through every single card to make sure nothing breaking the color pie sees print, 
  i would say that 's unlikely , given that 's literally his job . 
  he does n't go through cards and ` approve ' them as being in pie after they 've left design and gone into development precisely because that 's none of his business . 
  if development decide green needs a flier , or wants a flier , or deserves a flier , it gets one . 
  nothing to do with maro . 
   there 's a grand total of 4 green flying cards in modern he likely would have had changed if he caught them ( 1 of which was n't originally designed for standard/modern so he probably did n't even look at the set at all ) , and 1 green vindicate . 
  there have been 0 such modern cards printed in the last 6 years . 
  you know he works , as a full time job , on magic , right ? 
  that they release maybe 1000 cards a year * at most * . 
  he has plenty of time to look at the cards before they 're released . 
  he just does not at all have the authority to change them . 
  that 's not the point , at all . 
  i 'm not talking about the specific examples of those worlds . 
  obviously if things were different then some other things would also be different . 
  haha you 're kidding right ? 
  wow , he sure mentions it a lot if he only wrote two episodes lol . 
  the game gains believable , real-feeling worlds . 
  i 'm not literally proposing those two places should have been on the same planet . 
  i 'm saying that there 's no reason that they could n't have been two parts of one world . 
  they literally ended up influencing each other , for goodness sake . 
   but these bolts look way too big to just deal 1 damage each . 
  if you scale it down to the size of a magic card they certainly do n't . 
  but they were wrong , it was fine . 
  that standard environment had a cheap tier 1 rdw deck . 
  people enjoyed playing it and enjoyed playing against it . 
  they really do have some bloody weird ideas about the game . 
   the color pie is a matter of design , so you effectively did say design . 
  no , i did n't ` effectively say design ' . 
  i did n't say he is n't in charge of the colour pie , i said he was n't in charge of everything at wotc . 
   he 's specifically said he does n't do it . 
  perhaps that 's a poor use of his time , i do n't know . 
  i 'm not defending that . 
  at any rate , there 's a lot that 's been said about how r&d works that you should try looking into if you 're curious !, 
  he 's said that in response to people saying ` why do n't you go through all the cards before they 're printed and point out the ones that break the colour pie ' . 
  and he basically got as close as he can to saying ` because it 's none of my bloody business once they 're in development ' . 
  he does n't have the authority to go through the cards and blacklist them from being printed without colour pie changes . 
  he does n't even have the authority to really point them out . 
  in the corporate world you ca n't go around telling other people how to do their jobs . 
  wotc is , like it or not , a * very * corporate workplace . 
  i do n't care about those two, 
  planetside 2 is a modern game . . 
   the old days, 
  planetside 2 was only recently released dude, 
  not sure how an mtg mmo is ` vapourware ' ... do you even know what that means ? 
  the word is n't ` massive ' . 
  it 's ` massively ' .
