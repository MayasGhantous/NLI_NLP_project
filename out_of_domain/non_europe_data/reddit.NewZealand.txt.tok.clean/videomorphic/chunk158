   without migration you have aging native populations that cause economic contraction, 
  no you do n't . 
  stop promoting myths . 
  and that 's a fine response . 
  i do n't have a problem with that . 
  ` thresh plays werebear lol ' is what i have a problem with . 
  yeah if it were a 1/1 with ` whenever a permanent leaves the battlefield , bone picker 's becomes a 3/2 creature with flying until end of turn ' that would be the ` omg next delver ' that people seemed to think it could be . 
  but this ? 
  awful . 
  he 's pretty consistently flippant with people that suggest that his deck might not be literally the best thing since sliced bread so . . 
  desire , will and jar are banned in legacy even in decks that run food chain . 
   not believing in a class system . 
  there 's nothing to ` believe ' in . 
  it 's objective fact that it exists . 
  ** points of order **, 
  what 's a `` ur '' ? 
  i do n't know , are `` u '' going to do that ? 
  who is `` u '' ? 
  and what is `` tes '' ? 
  and who is a `` dumbass '' and why is it not the person that does n't know how to spell ? 
  `` jace is fine in legacy , not overpowered '' rah rah rah modern isnt legacy stop talking about legacy rah rah rah, 
  `` jace should be unbanned in modern because it would be fine in modern '' rah rah rah its the cornerstone of legacy midrange rah rah rah, 
  jace would be shit in death 's shadow , a low to the ground tempo deck . 
  that literally does n't make any sense . 
  people are intent on unbanning a weak card . 
   `` m ` spicy original 100 % m ` organic m ` homebrewed pestermite control is a fringe m ` deck right now , but it would easily be tier 0 with this m ` card '' . 
  this idiotic ` le fedora ' meme is so fucking 2013 . 
  gsz , sfm , twin and jace are all completely fair cards for this format . 
  * one * post that was heavily downvoted and ridiculed in the comments section does not mean that ` people on this subreddit advocate for a cloudpost unban ' . 
  this but unironically, 
   ponza , 8 rack, 
  eugh can you just not, 
  yeah gifts storm honestly is n't that hard . 
  i bought all the cards online and just started playing it and it basically plays itself . 
  you cast some cost-reducing creatures , accumulate rituals in your hand and then cast them all and cast gifts , chain gifts and past in flames and such and just . . win . 
  eldrazi tron is definitely interactive . 
  abzan company is very mildly interactive . 
  death 's shadow is obviously interactive . 
  burn is not interactive . 
  affinity is not interactive . 
  it 's an aggro deck , it does n't want to interact at all . 
  dredge is definitely not interactive . 
  gifts storm is definitely not interactive . 
  ad nauseam is definitely not interactive . 
  then why are those decks not viable when the only difference in the meta is ds ? 
  then why does nobody play it ? 
  nobody takes 2 minutes to brainstorm . 
  you draw three cards and put two back . 
  i 've never seen a brainstorm take more than 15 seconds to resolve in a game of magic * ever * and i 've played a hell of a lot of legacy . 
  jace would not push out non-blue midrange . 
   jace needs to stay banned end of story . 
  jace needs to be unbanned end of story . 
   basically the enire time between pod and twin ban the overwhelming majority of modern was interactive . 
  there were posts here every day about how the format was uninteractive in that period . 
   i would not be shocked if jace made every midrange deck play blue and every control deck would run jace but that 's less an issue . 
  every control deck plays island . 
  every control deck plays cryptic command and snapcaster mage . 
  there 's nothing wrong with staples . 
   look , wizards cant ever officially acknowledge the secondary market because they dont want to fall afoul of gambling laws, 
  what a load of rubbish, 
   modern has been in a shit hole ever since lazy eldrazi got printed . 
  since * well * before that actually . 
  people complained about it being too linear * long * before eldrazi got printed and they were right and it has n't been fixed . 
  what ? 
  huh ? 
  or just ` no , why should i ? ', 
  because they got paid out for contents insurance on those items . 
  the meta has been filled with uninteractive nonsense for literally the entire time the format has existed . 
  that 's how modern works and has always worked . 
  jund was tier 1 in the past , why not now when the only thing that has changed is a new deck it 's good against ? 
  it certainly is not too far gone . 
   no ones hardly heard about shootings , terrorist threats , bombings , yet now they seem to occur every other week . 
  in europe they were much rarer and they were of a completely different type . 
  it 's not about paying for a subscription . 
  god . 
  ** any non-cosmetic microtransactions ** make a game p2w . 
  not at all . 
  because the game is actually good . 
  too true, 
  just play osrs, 
  i mean come on , it 's 2001, 
  i mean come on it 's the current year, 
  just play rs, 
  false . 
  like that / u/videomorphic idiot and his obvious alt accounts that all say identical things, 
  modern players seem to be much stricter in their definition of a control deck than legacy players . 
  to a legacy player , the definition is much more the traditional one . 
  modern players seem to use ` control ' to mean ` draw-go control and/or tron ' . 
  leovold has fallen off a * lot * since the sensei 's top ban , but yes he was definitely played in control decks . 
   thats best you can do . 
  to make people actually fear , penalty should be absolutely brutal . 
  what do you suggest , cut a finger irl every time your avatar dies ? 
  no it is n't the best you can do . 
  in runescape , you lose all the items you have on you , except the three most valuable items . 
  not the three most valuable stacks , but the 3 most valuable items . 
  1000 gp on you ? 
  you keep 3gp . 
  you can rush back to your body and if it 's close to where you respawn ( hint : it probably is if you 're a noob , it almost definitely is n't if you are n't ) , in lumbridge , you can pick them up before they appear to anyone . 
  if they are n't picked up in that same timespan , they cease to exist . 
  this was * the most popular mmorpg of all time * .
