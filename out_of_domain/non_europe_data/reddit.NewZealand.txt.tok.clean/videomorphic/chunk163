   the only activity outside of grinding , lifeskills are cookie-clicker tier idle game mechanics ), 
  the entirety of wow 's combat mechanics are cookie clicker tier complexity . 
  can you please accurately transcribe cards ? 
  they 're both target opponent . 
  wotc are obsessed with making everything a cycle . 
  knowing my opponent is playing discard or gitaxian probe makes me more likely to mulligan as i just do n't want to be embarrassed when my opponent sees my loose as fuck keep . 
  why are kids in 2017 so awful at speaking ? 
  they do n't seem to know when to stop to take a breath . . 
  does n't sound particularly convincing . 
  if there were a pre-existing reason in the world before the release of this game ( given it 's the 15th in the series ) i 'd accept it but it sounds like they just made all that up to justify the mechanic , which is n't even a good mechanic . 
  same . 
  heroes of the storm is to mobas as world of warcraft is to mmorpgs : an attempt by blizzard to casualise the genre beyond all recognition . 
  thank god it did n't succeed the way wow did . 
  when you keep a 1-lander in your wildfire deck because you are so distracted by trying to play four games at once that you forgot to look at your cards before clicking ` keep ' it 's still fairly embarrassing when someone thoughtseizes you and takes your only mana rock . 
   a secretary is not search engine . 
  well i said * legal executive * , not secretary . 
   automation using mechanisation does not mean mechanisation is automation . 
  ` mechanisation ' in the context of this discussion * fucking obviously does * mean exclusively the mechanisation that is automation . 
  just repeating your opinion over and over again does n't make it true . 
  * and he is n't -3 anymore * . 
  that 's my whole fucking point . 
  good job totally missing the point . 
  your comment was utterly premature . 
  whining about downvotes is so fucking newfaggy . 
  it 's not ` confirmation bias ' . 
  they make a * lot * of cycles , far more than any other card game with a similar concept . 
  maro has said many times that they just do n't work very well , that it 's very common for the first card thought up in a cycle to be brilliant , the second to be good , the third to be * okay * , the fourth to be mediocre and the last to be really , * really * stretching . 
  and yet they keep doing what feels like more in every set . 
  because wow is a terrible overly casual mmorpg that ruined by the genre . 
  if the whole moba genre were hots clones it would be shit . 
  nobody ` called for ' ability pruning . 
  blizzard decided completely of their own accord to do it . 
  nobody asked for it , nobody liked it when it was first suggested . 
  anyone that supports it now does so only because they just support everything that blizzard chooses to do . 
  wtf dude . 
  what kind of shit are you smoking ? 
  oh thanks , never heard this one before . 
  i 'm sure you 'll bring some new salient points to the discussion . 
  ** if you do n't like it , vote to change the government . 
  whining does nothing . 
  because it appeals to casuals , who are looking for something completely different to hardcore players . 
  your opinion is wrong . 
  reading it again does n't change that it 's wrong . 
   a farmer driving a tractor is mechanisation . 
  that is correct . 
  it is also automation . 
  the jobs that would be there if not for machinery have been replaced with a machine . 
   the tractor driving itself is automation . 
  that 's just * more * automation . 
   notice the difference ? 
  no farmer involved . 
  there is no material difference . 
  they 're just different stages of precisely the same process . 
  you know what ` casual ' means . 
  example of a 4-card cycle ? 
  i do n't think i 've noticed any of those in a recent set . . 
  from an outsider 's perspective , bush was just as embarrassing . 
  it means people that just want casual mechanics : low skill floor , streamlined , little required time investment , etc. 
  people that want dungeon finders and cross-realm and global chat channels and teleports everywhere . 
  people that want theme park dungeons and lfg and lfr . 
  i 've bought loads of things from them before . 
  never had a problem . 
  a lot of their stuff ships from the uk though so it can take a couple of weeks to arrive . 
  they did that a long time ago . 
  someone already said that an hour ago, 
  ` shadow of mordor ' is not old . . 
  no it does n't . 
  no it is n't . 
  they do n't oppose need-based support of the poor and needy . 
  they * do * oppose race-based * political power * which is completely unrelated to economy policy and support for the poor . 
   take away from under privileged ? 
  the maori that benefit from maori electorates are n't * underprivileged * . 
  maori electorates and maori local boards * primarily * benefit the already powerful maori that lead iwi , and rich maori . 
   should we be defining laws based on racial heritage within our society as a method of dealing with historical grievances ? 
  i personally do n't think so but again , i do n't know if we have a legal obligation under the treaty . 
  i do n't see why it should matter . 
  if we had a treaty that benefited white people , it would be seen as an historical anachronism . 
  ancient documents should * never * be allowed to be used as justification for racist laws . 
  if we have poverty in nz , then it should be addressed . 
  not through race-based seats , not through race-based policy , not through hand outs to specific ethnic groups . 
  no , it should be addressed through * need-based policy * . 
  i do n't see any four-card cycles . 
  couching your completely reasonable comment in things like ' i feel like being obnoxiously pedantic ' and ` that concludes this episode of being insufferable ' is far more annoying than just saying what you came here to say . 
   it 's the `` the moment you put an hp bar on cthulhu , he becomes just another monster to kill '' effect that made the eldrazi so disappointing . 
  well the original titans were n't disappointing , and neither were the new ones . 
  but the bfz block normal ones ? 
  god they definitely were , yeah . 
  it 's just flipped left-to-right from what you expect , but there 's nothing japanese about it . 
  yes they can . 
  they also said that elvish mystic is too powerful . 
  they said lightning strike was too powerful . 
  they said day of judgment was too powerful . 
  they just had to ban cards in three standard b & r announcements in a row . 
  when will you people realise they have absolutely no idea what they are doing ? 
  dude you have a ** rift ** flair and you 're complaining about another game being pay to win ? 
  says the guy with a ** rift ** flair, 
  no cash shop . 
  i do n't really agree that it 's hard to balance . 
  lots of games have been well enough balanced before . 
   if you want to promote any sort of grouping you need at least some kind of base class system so you have defined roles .
