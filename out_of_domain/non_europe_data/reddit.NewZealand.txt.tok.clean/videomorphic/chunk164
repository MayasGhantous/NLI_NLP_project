  that just is n't true though . 
  not being a dick , but this sentence is just * not * true in any way , shape or form . 
  the issue is n't that it 's * not * prodigal pyromancer . 
  the issue is that it 's * so much worse than * prodigal pyromancer . 
  they do n't have to reprint it exactly or functionally reprint it , they can do something interesting . 
  they could make it double red and give it an extra point of power , for example . 
  this would actually be more balanced ( harder to splash for a couple of pingers in any deck ) and much more interesting ( as you have to decide whether to attack or not , given that you have the potential to hit them for 2 ) . 
  overprinted is good . 
  that set needed to be overprinted . 
  oh my god are you kidding ? 
  i hope you 're kidding . 
  rift * literally sells gear * . 
  there 's nothing more pay to win than that , barring maybe * mandatory * purchases , but they are n't necessary to make a game pay to win . 
  it 's a streamlined game that focuses on being accessible to casual players . 
  there 's nothing wrong with that . 
  i do n't have a problem with that . 
  there are lots of players that , like you , are n't interested in subtle mechanics or difficulty . 
  you clearly do n't like dota 's extreme style of balance where `` everything is overpowered '' . 
  it 's a much more balanced game than any other moba , but casuals ca n't deal with a lot of heroes . 
  heroes of the storm is * not * an ` evolution ' of mobas though . 
  it 's a branching . 
  it 's a casual version of dota . 
  and that 's fine , but acting like it 's better because of it is just ignorant . 
  it 's not better , it 's aimed at a different audience . 
  the good thing is the genre has recognised that . 
  they 've recognised that it 's a fine casual game but it 's not aimed at the same people as dota or lol . 
  the problem i was alluding to before was that the genre * did n't * recognise that wow 's audience were happy with wow and happy with blizzard and * were n't the same audience * as swg or other older games . 
  they replaced the genre with wow clones , and today it 's all wow clones . 
  that sucks . 
  if that happened to the moba genre that would be terrible . 
  hail fire of torment - xu, 
  instant, 
  you may lose 3 times x life rather than pay ~ 's mana cost . 
  if he or she does n't , that player taps all permanents with mana abilities he or she controls and empties his or her mana pool . 
  then that player discards a card . 
  i 'd play this ... 
  that 's not how it works . 
  things do happen automatically . 
  a subscription, 
  no it is n't . 
  a game that 's 15 years old is old . 
  a game that is 3 years old is new . 
  all four are equally bad . 
  wow is casual . 
  having some raids does n't make it not casual . 
  read the rest of the thread ? 
  * at least outside of this bdo-obsessed subreddit *, 
  the eldrazi titans definitely appeared in card form . 
  [ [ emrakul , the aeon 's torn ] ], 
  they * are * selling endgame gear . 
  they literally sell raid gear . 
  they sell raid gear . 
  it does n't matter what tier of gear it is , it could be the worst gear in the game . 
  selling any gear is pay to win . 
  selling ** raid gear ** ? 
  that 's egregiously pay to win . 
  it certainly does n't . 
  if you put more work in and build a more powerful character you can do more things . 
  that 's not ` overpowered ' . 
  and you are still limited by the action economy ( you are limited to a certain number of actions per second ) . 
  why would everyone know the specific details of the expansions of a shitty tier 3 mmo ? 
   tank ... healer ... class ... classes ... etc. 
  theme parks are not the only sort of mmorpg mate, 
  the majority of people that support pay to win ( by calling it ` pay for convenience ' ) are doing so because they like bdo and fanboy it . 
  that player is just cheating . 
  you are allowed to forget * beneficial optional * triggers . 
  this is / r/mmorpg . 
  not / r/wow _ clone . 
  guilds are awful . 
   i 'm not implying , that jonathan semeyn cheated, 
  yes you are . 
  you imply it several times . 
  you implied it in the title , you implied it throughout your posts , and you imply it now . 
  stop implying it . 
  there is no evidence anyone was cheating . 
   this point is the very last resort of contacting a judge immediately . 
  both commentators are under different assumptions . 
  why is this ? 
  this is the point where things should get investigated . 
  if they 'd stopped the game every time the commentators got confused they 'd have never got through the tournament . 
  the commentators were confused constantly , they were totally and completely incompetent with the sole exception of lsv . 
  ` pay to win ' is n't a literal term . 
  unless you are actually a zergling made of iron i assume you understand that concept . 
   so are you telling me games like skyrim or minecraft are new games ? 
  yes , they are pretty recent games . 
   anything that came out last year or before can be counted as old . 
  if you 're a child , maybe . 
  nothing remotely funny here, 
  theme parks have shitty pvp . 
  theme parks have always had shitty pvp . 
  theme parks will always have shitty pvp . 
  pvp just does n't * matter * in theme parks . 
  there 's no * point * . 
  you 're just fighting over some arbitrary rating that nobody cares about . 
  you will never find good pvp in an mmorpg until you play a sandbox . 
  runescape is a ** completely ** different game to wow . 
  they 're barely in the same genre . 
  just play runescape . 
   life-skilling, 
  i instinctively look down on anyone that calls non-combat skills ` life skills ' .
