  it 's an obnoxious bdo-ism that comes from bdo 's developers translating the game terribly . 
  it 's not what they 're called in english . 
  read the fucking rules and stop asking for mmos . 
  no youtube direct links , unless from an official or approved source, 
  okay ? 
  and ? 
  exchanging money for goods and services might be how the world works , but that does n't change the * fact * that exchanging money for in-game power is pay to win . 
   but if it was intentional cheating or not is not what i want to discuss here . 
  ` intentional cheating ' is redundant . 
  cheating is by definition intentional . 
  you have to intentionally break the rules to be cheating in magic , and it 's almost certainly the case that he did n't . 
  who would cheat * on camera * ? 
  i am older than you ( almost certainly ) . 
  that does n't make me old , unless you are also old . 
   you still raid through the tiers . 
  no you do n't . 
  the old content is objectively not relevant . 
   2 ) the game has n't been dumbed down . 
  there are fewer options , but more options in the past just meant even more min-maxing and pre-built builds than there are/is now , which is why blizzard got rid of them . 
  it 's hardly perfect now , but to suggest that somehow number of buttons to press or little boxes to pick from equals complexity has been a ridiculous fallacy since before wow even existed . 
  the number of buttons to press * absolutely * relates to complexity . 
  stop spamming retard, 
  ` pay to win ' is n't a literal term . 
  unless you are actually a zergling made of iron i assume you understand that concept . 
  no it is n't . 
  it 's the worst possible way to make no area obsolete because it removes all potential for difficulty or easy content . 
  i ca n't go to one place and just do something chill if the content at my level requires too much attention . 
  i ca n't go to another place and challenge myself to harder content . 
  everything is identical . 
  everything scales . 
  it 's a bad mechanic . 
  it 's not about it being a ` simulator ' at all . 
  it 's not about realism . 
  it 's about immersion and it 's about balance and difficulty and fun . 
  it 's not fun to be unable to fight harder monsters because everything is just exactly the same difficulty level . 
   guild wars 2 inventory . 
  the fact that you can just `` store '' any crafting materials and still access them when you 're actually crafting is amazing . 
  that makes no sense . 
  if you are n't holding the materials how can you craft with them ? 
   likewise , the fact that you can access the `` auction house '' from anywhere takes out what is usually an annoying and pointless step . 
  hardly pointless . 
  it 's more immersive , it requires people to go to social hubs in order to trade ( which is a good thing from a social point of view ) and it creates game mechanics around the transport of goods . 
  die while carrying valuable items ? 
  lose the items . 
   however , being able to adjust your level down to a friend 's at any time is something not enough mmos do . 
  i do n't think you should have to adjust your level down to a friend 's level at any time to be able to play with them . 
  the power curve in most mmorpgs is * way * too high , and that 's the issue , not the lack of scaling . 
   as a marketplace nerd , i really kind of loved wildstars marketplace . 
  youd be able to see the trends , the highs and lows , whenever you listed something it would always just show you the item and let you buy the cheapest amount, 
  i do n't see how you could like auction houses if you consider yourself a ` marketplace nerd ' . 
  or in fact how you could play anything with a terrible theme park economy . 
   telegraphs combat system, 
  * vomit *, 
  that would be awful . 
  a pokemon mmorpg should have pokemon turn-based combat , obviously . 
   experience rates in rs3 are much better, 
  if by ` better ' you mean ` worse ' then sure, 
  stop spamming arsehole, 
  they ca n't win without it . 
  they 're just * bad * . 
  they need xp pots because they play incredibly inefficiently . 
  they need to buy gear because they 're too lazy to get it themselves . 
  they need to buy gold because they 're too inefficient and slow to farm gold themselves , as they spend hours in cities talking in trade chat . 
   my friends hobbies include golfing , snowboarding , boating , and competitive shotgunning . 
  they 'll spend that in a weekend . 
  games are a tremendously cheap hobby when compared to literally any other hobby . 
  they 're ** real ** costs . 
  you * actually * get something for the money . 
  they do n't cost money because of some arbitrary decision . 
  they make money because they cost money to produce the things you 're buying !, 
  games are cheap because they 're ** extremely ** cheap to produce . 
  they 're ** way ** more profitable than the people selling the equipment you 're buying for those sports . 
  spending money on cash shop items is * retarded * . 
   i mean , my friend is a motorcyclist . 
  compared to what i spend on a cash shop and getting called a whale , it 's a drop in the water to that hobby and other such hobbies . 
  they 're buying things of actual value with actual material worth . 
  they are n't buying make-believe digital doll clothes that cost literally $ 0 to make and are charged $ 100s for . 
  what 's right with riders of icarus ? 
   well , i consider myself older than you , since i am in my thirtiesm and there is a low chance you are older than that . 
  i am older than that , but neither of us are old . 
  my mother is in her 60s . 
  she ( sadly ) is old . 
  i am not , neither are you . 
   same with games , shadow of mordor is old because it came out three years ago . 
  it is n't , though . 
  it 's new . 
   anything in the past is old , not new , because new means it was released recently . 
  3 years ago * is * recently . 
   there 's plenty of ways to find challenge in the scaled areas . 
  both games still have `` champion '' mobs , both have world bosses . 
  all content should be able to be challenging . 
  ` champion ' mobs and ` world bosses ' are not what i 'm talking about . 
   in eso there 's public dungeons , dungeons , craglorn , trials , pvp , all to find challenge in . 
  gw2 has fractals , raids , pvp , wvw , meta events for every hots zone . 
  pvp and group content are not what i 'm talkinga bout either . 
   it 's also extremely easy to find `` chill '' easy content in both games . 
  not when the game scales you down . 
  scaling is a shit solution to a problem brought on by badly designed power curves that make high level players way too strong compared to low level players . 
  those games require actual skill rather than grinding endlessly for gear . 
  theme parks do n't have gameplay depth , so there needs to be * something else * .
