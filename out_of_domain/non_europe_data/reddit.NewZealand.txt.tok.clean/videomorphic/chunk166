  none of those things sound good to me at all . 
  i do n't care about graphics . 
  camera blur is a big negative . 
  cheaper subscription is irrelevant , $ 3/month is like . . one coffee . 
  action combat is distasteful , flying at all is bad . 
  mounted combat is awful . 
  class-based characters are boring and played out . 
  it has * always * meant the existence non-cosmetic microtransactions . 
  bdo is n't a sandbox so i do n't see how that 's got anything to do with what i said . 
  i do n't know that ` everyone ' is doing anything . 
  who is complaining about what being grindy ? 
  that 's even worse . 
  not paying attention to irrelevant / r/magictcg drama or conspiracy theories . 
  and wow is now less complex , less immersive and less interesting because of the reduction in abilities . 
  i 'm not going to get drawn into a discussion with someone that outrightly states things that are objectively untrue . 
  subscription fees and purely cosmetic cash shops are both completely and totally capable of sustaining a game . 
  subreddits ca n't like or dislike things . 
  lots of people here fanboy the shit out of bdo . 
  were you not here when any criticism of it would net * instant * massive downvotes ? 
   because to date most people seem to mean `` it seems like a world with consistent , realistic rules , rather than things operating by meta-game mechanisms '', 
  that is definitely a good way of describing immersion . 
  scaling levels takes away from immersion because it 's such a metagame-y mechanic . 
  it 's absurd that people scale so much that you need scaling . 
  that level of power curving is just not fun in the first place , and scaling is n't the solution to it , power curve reduction is . 
  pokemon has always been about innovation ? 
  lol what ? 
  pokemon has essentially been exactly the same game with exactly the same game mechanics for decades . 
  it 's exactly the opposite of innovative . 
   frankly , it does n't matter what you 're talking about , challenges can be found within the games . 
  your attempt to define something specific to you does n't make the fact that challenge can be found any less true . 
  i did n't say it could n't be . 
   in gw2 , once you 're 80 and in just plain old exotic gear , even being scaled down , the general over world content is super chill , even scaled . 
  what happens at max level is completely irrelevant . 
  the levelling experience is what is important . 
  actually * playing the game * . 
   scaling is an excellent mechanic , that allows people of all level ranges to actually game together without someone being effectively punished for it . 
  no it is n't . 
  i 've explained this before . 
  it 's only necessary in games with * shit * design , that have power curves that make high level players * so much * more powerful than low level players . 
  that 's just really awful design . 
   less complex sure . 
  you literally just claimed it was n't less complex . 
   less immersive ? 
  not really less interesting ? 
  it 's ** absolutely ** less immersive . 
  when wow came out , your character class actually meant something . 
  warlocks had spells that really represented their connection with demons . 
  spells were n't entirely focused around end-game raiding or end-game pvp . 
  they felt flavourful and fun and interesting . 
  classes felt unique . 
  so yes it 's definitely less immersive , it 's definitely less interesting . 
   it 's better with 14 abilities per character i prefer it now to how it used to be . 
  you preferring it does n't make it better . 
  do you mongs even read the rules ? 
  ** no generic `` looking for mmo '' posts **, 
   balmer was talking about the viral nature of the gpl and other copyleft licenses . 
  whether or not he was , he still said `` linux is a cancer '' , which is both offensive to linux users and offensive to people with cancer . 
   thing is , that is n't an unpopular opinion which is why free libre open source copyleft licenses are actually the minority in places like github, 
  its popularity is irrelevant . 
  it 's factually wrong and highly misleading propaganda . 
  and copyleft licenses being a minority on github has nothing to do with them being ` viral ' ( which they are n't ! ), 
  but because open source is today * dominated * by greedy corporations instead of hobbyists . 
   microsoft avoids using copyleft licenses and instead it favors permissive ( non viral ) open source licenses like the mit license, 
  well no shit . 
  ` viral ' is inaccurate . 
  ` viral ' is misleading . 
  there 's nothing infectious or viral about copyleft . 
  if you derive some software from someone else 's software , you have a * moral responsibility * to follow their wishes . 
  if they want anything derived from their own hard work to be available for anyone for free , what 's wrong with that ? 
  how is that viral ? 
   the agpl was specifically created to close that loophole, 
  no it was n't . 
  that 's a ** blatant ** lie . 
  the agpl does not require that anyone consuming your api licenses their software agpl too . 
  that would be absurd . 
  the agpl requires that if you use anything licensed agpl in order to build ** server ** software , then host that server software somewhere publicly accessible , that you provide the source code for that server software . 
  you 're being deliberately misleading and making blatantly false statements in order to further your own propagandist ends . 
  who cares ? 
  it 's 2017 . 
  # ( dryad arbor is n't a spell , it 's affected by summoning sickness , and it has '' { t } : add { g } to your mana pool . '' ), 
  obviously not a cube player, 
  why is n't number 1 / u/barrinmw and number 2 / u/thegg11 ? 
  ` the best card in white is worse than the best card in black therefore black is more powerful than white ' is just wrong . 
  and of course , like a true propagandist , you respond to that instead of responding to any of the relevant points !, 
   it 's definitely good against affinity , but it is n't unwinnable for affinity . 
  it 's almost like nobody was saying it was unwinnable for affinity , or something . 
  words do n't change their definitions based on how much you dislike pay to win . 
  words also do n't change their spelling based on how much you like pay to win . 
  try to learn to spell . 
   there is no way for the game devs to be able to verify you were n't actually apart of the friend group . 
  correction : there was no way to be able to verify he * was * in the group and so banning him was ** completely unjustified ** . 
   lmao no one said blizzard needs to cater to anyone, 
  you implied blizzard needs to cater to you . 
   our fine with your opinion that 14-18 buttons is to little but i think it 's ample and fine . 
  and you are wrong . 
   ( my char atm uses 18 abilities ) . 
  also no being able to use more then 18 abilities does not mean your iq is low so that 's a fallacy if i have ever seen one . 
  being stupid absolutely does mean your iq is low . 
  that 's what iq measures : intelligence .
