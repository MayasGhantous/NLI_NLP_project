  learn how to spell, 
  learn how to use grammar correctly, 
  i have n't changed anything . 
  pay to win means what it has always meant . 
  um are we looking at the same thing ? 
  there 's nothing remotely impressive there . 
  hierarchical file systems are not popular among computer usability experts , which annoys the fuck out of me because they 're actually incredibly intuitive and great . 
  they tend to advocate tagging-based systems but while that 's fine if you want to find a particular file they make it much harder to get a list of all files . 
  for in-game inventories i personally much prefer this over literally anything else :, 
  it 's just great , for so many reasons . 
  guides can just include a picture of an inventory , for example . 
  all your excess crap is in your bank , not on your person . 
  there are plenty of highly expert translators , especially between major languages like japanese and english . 
  there are more than enough people to do what you are suggesting . 
  that 's the weirdest shit i 've ever seen . 
  if that scene started playing in a video game i was playing i would definitely skip it . 
  why does he just land a dozen metres from where he jumped without being smashed to a pulp and then start falling around on the ground like he 's had a stroke ? 
   but the combat is really strangely designed with the targeting , controlls , commands , and weapon animations . 
  uhhh . 
  what ? 
  that 's the whole strength of the game . 
  it 's not ` strangely designed ' . 
  that 's your opinion , but many disagree . 
  if you want to play competitively and label yourself as a competitive player then you should be playing at a competitive level . 
  that 's different . 
  the game has given you a 50/50 matchup . 
  getting rekt does n't mean it is n't a 50/50 matchup . 
  it means you got rekt . 
  your team knows this , and they want someone to blame . 
  they ca n't exactly go ` oh my god they 're so much better than us ' when they 're objectively considered by the game to be the same rank , so they blame lack of effort on their teammates ' part . 
  they 're very young games and most people get tired of playing them quite soon . 
  the top level is not what is being discussed . 
  please do try to actually read what the person you 're responding to says . 
   anyone can hit the top one percent and if you are aged out of the top .001 then so be it . 
  pro dota players are n't in the 1 % , they 're in the 0.001 % . 
  witty , but they * are * adults . 
  there 's no reward for winning in unranked dota and it 's still `` toxic '' . 
  i put toxic in quotes because frankly i do n't think there 's anything toxic about a bit of banter , but australia/nzers are much more chill than americans about swearing so * shrug * . 
   in games where you can just leave , there is less toxicity . 
  if i can just leave and go to another server why do i care about some jerk on there spamming a bunch of nasty shit in chat ? 
  there 's a mute button . 
  use it . 
   but even in person gaming , like card and hobby gaming have horrible communities . 
  i totally disagree with this . 
  the communities with a lot of kids have ... well ... typically nasty kids . 
  but that 's just because kids are nasty . 
  the ones without lots of kids . . well . . they 're fine . 
   ` derived ' is such a loose term though . 
  it definitely is n't . 
  it 's well-defined , legally . 
   let 's say i create a gpl-licensed logging library , would it make sense that everyone who uses my logging library must release their software for free ? 
  if someone uses your library then they are choosing to adhere to the license that you put on your library . 
  if they do n't like that then they can choose not to use it !, 
   it would be ridiculous to say that their software is derived from my ` hard work ' . 
  no it would n't . 
  that just looks tacky and childish frankly . 
   yes , and that 's exactly what happens . 
  well no , it is n't . 
   no one uses gpl-licensed code . 
  false . 
  everybody uses gpl-licensed programmes * every single day * . 
  everyone does . 
  literally everyone with access to a computer . 
   if the goal is to make all software free then gpl is not a very efficient way to achieve this . 
  given that virtually all important software is free or has a free alternative , i disagree . 
   for your legal definition of ` derived ' sure , but not in any meaningful or sane way . 
  if you include a gpl-licensed logging library in your application that supports a module which comprises 1 % of your code then suddenly the rest 99 % of your code also has to gpl-licensed . 
  that 's just false , though . 
  if you 're dynamically linking a gpl-licensed library through a standardised interface ( some sort of standard logging interface for example ) then it 's definitely not a requirement that it 's gpl-licensed . 
  if you are compiling it all together into a single final binary then ** of course ** it 's reasonable that i can say `` if you want to use my library , follow my rules '' . 
  there 's nothing viral about that . 
  at all . 
  ** i ** make the rules for my own library . 
  people claim that gpl is viral , but they do n't claim that proprietary licenses are viral . 
  the gpl says `` you can use the code , if '' while proprietary licenses say `` you can not use the code unless you come and get a special exemption from us '' . 
  how in hell is that not more viral ? 
  to use * any * of their code * at all * no matter your resulting license , even a tiny tiny bit of it , you are breaking their license !, 
  well of course the reason is that ` viral ' licenses make no sense as a concept . 
  there 's nothing viral . 
  you are using a library , you are including it , your work is a derived work . 
  that 's sensible . 
  if you think that it 's `` not really derived '' then you surely are okay with not including it , and you can just go ahead and not include it . 
  or better yet , include it , and license your work gpl . 
  gpl : the license of people that are n't cunts . 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  i am asking * who cares about it being a pdf * ? 
  it 's still nonsensical rubbish . 
  no i indeed have n't played this game . 
  japanese games are terrible . 
   wow , so if applied to me , i 'd have been a `` third generation immigrant '' in my home country . 
  nobody is saying that a second-generation immigrant * is * an immigrant . 
  stop being so defensive . 
   this nativist shit is pretty stupid . 
  yeah imagine having a culture and a country to call your own . 
  so stupid !, 
  what ? 
  throwing is insanely rare . 
  theme parks do n't have gameplay depth . 
  it 's just fact . 
  he did n't post a ` fairly common misconception ' .
