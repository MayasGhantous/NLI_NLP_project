  twin was interactive . 
  twin played a fair game most of the time . 
  twin only jammed the combo on turn 4 against decks that chose not to play interactive magic , which is kind of the whole point of playing magic in the first place . 
  if you chose to play interactive magic you almost always had a positive twin matchup !, 
  if you chose to play a slow uninteractive deck you had a bad twin matchup as twin could just combo you out , and if you chose to play a fast uninteractive matchup you 'd often get remanded and then combo 'd out . 
  how is this bad ? 
  it encouraged you to play interactive magic . 
  that 's what the format needs : a good reason to play fair . 
   treating unbanning twin as a kind of solution to meta problems is n't useful at all . 
  i totally disagree , for the reasons stated above . 
  twin makes it much more reasonable to play fair . 
  just like tron encourages you to play fast uninteractive magic , twin encourages you to play interactive magic . 
  if the meta swings too far one way , twin corrects it . 
  if the meta swings too far the other way , tron corrects it . 
  i 'd much rather not have tron , because i do n't think that ` too much fair magic ' can really be a thing that exists , and non-creature-based combo can thrive if the format is all jund anyway , so it 's not going to devolve into all midrange all the time . 
  but that 's a separate issue . 
   as for emrakul + dark confident : dude i play mardu nahiri , what 's wrong with you . 
  the hate on tron is real . 
  well it 's a stupid meta-warping deck and it 's meta-warping in the wrong direction . 
   your definition of `` aesthetic '' is completely defined by how detailed their pores are . 
  explain how persona 5 's ui looks like it 's `` designed for children '' . 
  wtf ? 
  i did n't say it was bad because it did n't have realistic graphics you moron . 
  i said it was bad because it looked like it was designed for kiddies . 
  because the point is that the op seems to think people want twin unbanned to ` solve the meta ' . 
  no people want twin unbanned because it 's fun , and it has no reason to be banned . 
  there 's no reason not to unban it . 
  it 's a good , fun , skill-testing card . 
  and it happens to have a positive impact on the meta too . 
   theyy did give reasoning why they banned twin . 
  which were either lies ( which i leant towards at the time ) or simple idiocy ( which i lean towards more now ) . 
  given that they were so incredibly incompetent as to miss saheeli combo in standard , to need to ban ** four ** card in standard in fucking 2017 , ** and ** they missed the obvious eldrazi winter in modern , i 'm pretty confident they 're just incompetent at designing the game . 
  he 's talking about standard . 
  i think they should unban preordain and ponder and ban past in flames honestly . 
  a better yawgmoth 's will for 1 more mana should definitely not be modern-legal . 
  i 'm pretty sure they missed them . 
  if they thought they 'd appear they would n't have banned twin . 
  they only banned twin to shake up the meta for the pro tour to make it ` exciting ' . 
  but if they knew eldrazi would appear they 'd know it was going to be exciting anyway . 
   part of the skill in magic is anticipating metagames and making the right call in deck selection . 
  no it is n't . 
  that 's not skilful , it just rewards people with enough money to build the right deck and punishes anyone that wants to play a deck they enjoy . 
   certain strategies are inherently strong against others and weak to something else , and that is part of magic . 
  ` strong ' and ` weak ' have traditionally meant 60/40 , not 80/20 . 
  virtually unwinnable matchups are not fun or interesting . 
   if you want to play a game where play skill dictates everything play chess . 
  the nature of magic as a game leads to variance in games , and variance in metagames . 
  magic has plenty of player skill involved . 
  variance is n't the issue , and you can deckbuild and play around variance quite easily . 
  i do n't think i 've been mana flooded or mana screwed more than a dozen times in several hundred matches playing canadian threshold , for example . 
   making the right meta call is a huge part of the game , if you do n't understand that i do n't know what to say . 
  making the right meta call is relevant for professional players . 
  modern is not a professional format , it 's not intended to be one . 
  it 's meant to be a format where you can play the deck you enjoy playing . 
   and if you want to continue to wallow in sadness about how awful modern is because of the twin ban and tron existing be my guest . 
  i 'm going to go out and enjoy modern because it 's a fun format if you are n't constantly looking for flaws . 
  modern is a fucking terrible format . 
   wake up princess , we 've all lost a deck or two for the sake of the format . 
  correction : we 've all lost a deck or two ** for the sake of shaking up pro tours that were fucking terrible to watch anyway ** . 
  it 's a game that a lot of people have spent a hell of a lot of money on . 
  i have a collection worth thousands of dollars and so do many , many other people . 
  i have invested thousands and thousands of hours into the game . 
  i expect to be treated with respect by wizards of the coast . 
  banning decks for terrible reasons then lying about it is not acceptable . 
   mostly just people like you crying for over a year . 
  til making a comment about it every now and again = crying . 
   but yeah , having a dumb , no-thought , instant win combo out of the format is pretty cool too, 
  twin was definitely the least `` dumb , no-thought '' combo in the format . 
  it died to * any * fucking interaction for god 's sake . 
   im not saying magic does n't require any skill , but there are other factors that influence gameplay besides skill . 
  and that 's fine , but they should n't * dominate * skill . 
  and in modern they do . 
  deck choice matters more than player skill . 
   also , traditional meanings do n't mean shit . 
  just because sometimes poor matchups with 60/40 in certain formats or metagames does n't matter at all . 
  modern is a big format and match ups like that will continue to exist no matter what . 
  modern is a pretty tiny format compared to legacy or vintage where matchups are much more even . 
   why are you here if modern is a terrible format ? 
  no one in a position to influence b & r policy is taking this entire subreddit seriously , i 'd be surprised if they looked at all . 
  complaining about the state of modern does nothing but piss people off and is no way constructive . 
  i still play modern . 
  i just do n't like the format . 
  i still like my current decks ( ur gifts storm on mtgo , infect irl ) and i 'm happy to play the format . 
  but i do n't think it 's in a good place . 
  it 's the same reason i played wow for years after it stopped being good : i like the people i play the format against irl . 
  i enjoy going to the shop , playing the deck , chatting to people , etc. 
  i 'd never play it in a big tournament . 
  and mtgo is a good way to waste time . 
   well said by the way , modern is n't a professional format , so winning is n't everything . 
  modern is about playing the deck you enjoy and sometimes you run into a bad match up . 
  but guess what , this is n't a professional format so it 's just about playing the game and having fun . 
  this is the only reason i continue to play it . 
  if i were a more competitive player i definitely would n't enjoy it . 
  i would n't enjoy taking a modern deck to a big tournament . 
  but the format would be better if it were more balanced . 
  wtf is shitty about embalm ? 
  players have never complained about this . 
   they could even have errata 'd `` morph < cost  '' into `` morph 0 - < cost  '' and have `` morph 1 < cost  '' instead of `` megamorph < cost  '' . 
  now * that * would be bad design . 
  `` just trust wotc they 're professionals '' is a terrible argument .
