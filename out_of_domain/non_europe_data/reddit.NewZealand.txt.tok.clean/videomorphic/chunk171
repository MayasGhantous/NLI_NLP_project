  i feel i should n't need to say that , but otherwise inevitably the response will be `` ur just victim blaming me for my teammates throwing !!!, 
  being calm does n't always work therefore it never works !!! '', 
  sort of crap that people say all the time . 
   i very much disagree , yawg 's will could be broken by a lot of things in modern right now , pif is only good in one specific deck . 
  okay ? 
  i did n't say yawgmoth 's will should be legal . 
  i said that past in flames is arguably stronger for only 1 more mana , and in many situations it * is * stronger . 
   i do n't think you 're off by saying if storm is the only reason , then just ban pif , but it 's not , there are plenty of combo decks that would benefit heavily from these unbans, 
  a couple of tier 3 combo decks getting a bit of a boost is fine . 
  maybe do n't post this many times , though i agree in general . 
  i completely disagree with banning death 's shadow . 
  it 's just not anywhere near good enough to be banned . 
  it 's a random fair creature . 
  if the urza 's lands were banned people would n't be compelled to play decks that can go under tron . 
  it 's a tradeoff , man . 
  you can include mass and size and stack limits that vary per item and other stuff like this . 
  or you can just have arbitrary limits . 
  it does n't have to be ultra realistic . 
  there are lots of complaints in this subreddit about games sacrificing gameplay for arbitrary realism that adds nothing to do the game ... 
   but fine , sure , you do n't need it if you game is only ever supposed to have a dozen items . 
  nobody cares about inventory management in those games . 
  its when you can amass hundreds or thousands of items that those simple solutions are proven horrible . 
  this is common in many mmos/rpgs/survival minecraft style games , etc. 
  i definitely agree with you here . 
  the bank in runescape was for a long time literally just the same as the inventory but with 400 slots . 
  no placeholders , no tabs , no folders , no tags , nothing . 
  at least removing an item would n't fill up the space it left until you closed the bank window ... 
  i really wish they 'd just allowed you to make directories and subdirectories like my ` $ home ` directory instead of the idiotic ` bank tab ' system they introduced where each item is on exactly one tab , you are allowed only 9 tabs , and each tab is just labelled with the first icon of the item in the tab . 
  but it 's better than nothing and hell it 's simple so it 's not too bad . 
  okay ? 
  i 'm not suggesting adding it to the format . 
  i 'm saying that if anything is responsible for storm being a good deck it 's past in flames , and i 'd happily lose pif from my storm deck if i got to play ponder and preordain in my control decks , my tempo decks and my storm deck . 
  twin was clearly not breaking any of the rules of the format . 
   me going out of the way to repair the team dynamic kind of precludes me from muting assholes , does n't it ? 
  what i am saying is simply that `` hey dude we 've still got this , do n't give up '' or `` there will always be idiots man , if you yell at every idiot in dota you 'll go hoarse '' can be very effective . 
  if you 're naturally funny then it helps , one of my friends seems to be able to make even the saltiest rager laugh . 
   at any rate , i 've answered op 's question . 
  players in competitive games are unpleasant because even casual game modes have stakes and leaver penalties , both of which create friction . 
  i often sense an implication in these sorts of comments that leaver penalties and/or high stakes should therefore not to be put in games , which i ** strongly ** disagree with . 
   you do n't even get it . 
  the twin player had the instant speed threats and forced the opp to not use his mana due to the fear of the combo . 
  do you even understand this game ? 
  not used your mana ? 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  if the twin player does n't play the combo you spend your mana on * other things * . 
  if they are n't doing anything and you are n't doing anything either then it does n't matter that you wasted tempo because so did they . 
  if they are doing something then at the end of their turn you can kill their snapcaster or their gurmag angler or their tarmogoyf or whatever ( depending on variant ) . 
  removal does n't use all your mana anyway . 
  you can play a tarmogoyf and hold up abrupt decay if you have 4 mana . 
  it 's not like removal uses your entire mana base . 
  twin is n't exactly the only bloody combo deck in the format , anyway . 
  why exactly is it such a massive problem to be forced to interact with your fucking opponent in * one * matchup ? 
  seriously , ** interactive decks all had positive twin matchups ** . 
  there literally is n't a single interactive deck that had a bad twin matchup . 
  i mean . . 
  i ca n't help but laugh at the first one . 
  probably not funny at the time but holy fuck is that funny now or what ? 
  lol are you kidding ? 
  your opponent spending their removal on a 3 mana 5/5 is amazingly good for you !, 
  they 're probably spending at least 4 mana to kill it , easily more . 
  i 'm talking about in limited . 
  this is clearly worthless in constructed . 
  i 'm talking about in limited . 
  this is clearly worthless in constructed . 
  which is n't in the set and thus is n't relevant in limited, 
  it 's terrible though . 
  do n't do this . 
  nothing . 
  that 's not how sample sizes work, 
   the new, 
  not the same as ' a recent ', 
  i misread your comment , my bad, 
  i do n't think additional parameters appearing is a problem . 
  i think ` morph 0 ' on most things is the problem . 
  even with the steam vents he at least once did n't have double red for reveller for a couple of turns . 
  lots of decks have strong colour requirements . 
  it 's still objectively incorrect to play steam vents . 
  playing four of one dual land is borderline already . 
  playing five is absolutely not necessary . 
  what a load of idiotic shit . 
   you might want to elaborate on that . 
  ... why ? 
  it 's objectively true and very well known that it 's the most popular mmorpg ever . 
   yes , it 's called population numbers . 
  whatever numbers i google were not even close to impressive . 
  feel free to provide your sources . 
  more than 200m players . 
  obviously unpopular . 
   what you described is achieved through balancing . 
  long , hard manual work of balancing , years of it . 
  how do you think it happens ? 
  weak mobs magically become less efficient than strong ones by god 's will , while game designers having a tea party ? 
  it 's not difficult to make some mobs weaker than others intentional . 
  what 's difficult is giving players options that * meaningfully different * while * balanced * . 
  simply making one mob weaker than another is not remotely difficult . 
   i 'm not sure if drugs , lucid dreams or advanced vr technology were used to create that post . 
  i do n't know what 's funnier : your attempts at being witty or the fact you 're acting like it 's impossible to do something that * has already been done * . 
  ah the daily `` why is n't wildstar popular ? '', 
  thread .
