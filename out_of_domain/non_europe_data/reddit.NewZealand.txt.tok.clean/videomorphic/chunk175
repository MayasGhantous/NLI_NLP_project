  but yeah , it 's kind of a broken game these days . 
  was a lot of fun as a kid . 
  but the community now is awful . 
  admitting fault is a foreign concept to wotc if it 's a foreign concept to anyone . 
  why the hell is this called ` ritual ' ? 
  it 's a tutor . 
  it should be called razaketh 's tutor . 
  or something ending in tutor . 
  or anything else !, 
  just not ritual . 
  ` ritual ' means something specific in magic . 
  pyretic ritual , dark ritual , cabal ritual , ... why would they call a tutor a ritual ? 
  what next , a card called ` chandra 's tutor ' that makes mana ? 
   b ) underwhelming , because it 's like sitting down to watch an action movie where not only do you know the hero saves the day , but you know exactly how the story ends , because it can not affect anything else in the multiverse timeline . 
  oh yeah you 're totally right , there 's never been a good prequel ever !!!, 
  oh wait there are plenty . 
  and magic is n't a fucking action movie and the vast majority of players do n't know or care about the story . 
  they do n't make cards that are inane references to very specific areas of american pop culture . 
  not even in un-sets . 
  they do not do this . 
  so no , it could n't . 
   even more people have been complaining about how the deck is too good . 
  several people have been claiming that it 's a legacy deck in modern and is too powerful for the format and needs to have something banned from it . 
  anyone claiming it 's a `` legacy deck in modern '' is an idiot . 
  there 's nothing remotely legacy-capable about it . 
  the * best * possible death 's shadow deck in legacy is awful , playing proper legacy-legal cards . 
  the modern death 's shadow deck would be * terrible * in legacy . 
   first , to address the people that are complaining about the deck being format warping : is n't that going to happen anyway ? 
  the format will almost always have a `` best deck '' or a most popular deck that has a higher meta share than the rest of the decks in the format . 
  this is a given , and i think most people forget this . 
  remember twin ? 
  how about infect and dredge ? 
  when infect was tier 1 , people were playing multiples of sudden shock in their sideboards to beat the deck . 
  they were also playing decks like jund and burn because they had favorable matchups against the deck . 
  and twin ? 
  people were playing rending volley in their boards . 
  a card that is so specific it immediately dropped the face of the earth as soon as the hammer fell on twin . 
  not only that , but people were either playing that deck or playing decks it had bad matchups against just to beat it . 
  whether you like it or not , that deck was format warping . 
  yet you 'll notice how many people want it to come back . 
  the best deck in the format will always be `` format warping . '', 
  that 's what the deck does . 
  that 's just stupid . 
  ` there will always be a best deck ' ? 
  no , not at all . 
  there can be multiple tier 1 decks . 
  the question is : `` is death 's shadow tier 0 ? '' . 
  i do n't think it is , but some people think it is . 
  it 's clearly * much * more dominant than twin , infect , or dredge ever were . 
  and let 's be clear here : comparing it to twin is fundamentally ludicrous . 
  twin was a completely reasonable deck that was good without being anywhere near overpowered . 
  it punished terrible players and people playing terrible decks , which is fine . 
  and it made people that did n't know how to cast removal spells at instant speed ( a lot of people , apparently , on this forum ) salty . 
  but it was n't overpowered . 
  death 's shadow is n't imo either , but it 's far closer to being overpowered . 
  and people playing rending volley in their sideboard does n't mean that twin was the ` best deck ' nor is it ` meta-warping ' . 
  people playing sideboard cards for a deck does not make that deck meta-warping . 
  people playing * mainboard * cards for * one specific deck * , ** that ** is meta-warping . 
  sideboard cards absolutely , definitely are not . 
   now , in regards to the deck being a legacy deck equivalent . 
  this is actually just not true . 
  people that claim this are either looking to create friction and start an argument , or just are n't actually considering what the deck does . 
  this is a straw man argument . 
  i 've read a lot of the threads about this and i 've ** never ** seen this argument made . 
  you 're constructing a ludicrous argument and then arguing against it to make your point seem stronger . 
  nobody is saying it 's a legacy deck in modern , and nobody cares that you think the null set of people saying that are all wrong . 
   the first group of people play unfair combo decks ( like ad naus or storm ) and have a hard time beating the deck because it interacts with them and they don ' t want that , to which i say tough shit . 
  absolutely !, 
  same with the people that whined about losing to twin because their deck has no removal spells or interaction . 
  like what the fuck do they expect ? 
  people play removal for a reason !, 
   the second group of people complain because they ca n't figure out how to beat the deck . 
  they do not . 
  plenty of people are completely capable of playing against it . 
  some ca n't , but most people can . 
  it 's not that hard , we 're all getting used to it fine now . 
  dismissing people that say death 's shadow is overpowered as either * being bad * or * having a bad matchup * is arrogant and rude . 
  people are capable of having an opinion on the meta that is n't coloured by their lack of skill or their deck choice . 
  80 % of this subreddit is `` the unban twin guy '' . 
  no you were n't . 
  nothing about your post indicated you were playing devil 's advocate . 
  if you 're argue for something , then stand by your arguments . 
  i disagree . 
  i 've played several dozen matches of grixis death 's shadow against esper draw-go control and you just * can not * lose to death 's shadow . 
  i think my record is something like 21-3 . 
  interactive decks can * absolutely * beat death 's shadow . 
  that 's just not true though . 
  which also should not have been banned and was only banned because wotc wanted to shake up the protour, 
  dude . 
  playing interactive cards in your deck is not ` adding mainboard cards to help with one matchup ' . 
  do n't be ridiculous . 
  and esper . 
  esper draw-go basically can not lose to death 's shadow . 
  that 's not how magic works . 
  this post is just * inane * . 
  the deck is the riskiest fair deck in modern by * far * . 
  and the reward is that a creature you 've got every chance of just never drawing all game might be a 7/7 ? 
  if you 're two lightning bolts from death ... 
  death 's shadow does n't even have trample . 
  play lingering souls .
