  maybe something like a speciall zone . 
  when you die , you have access to a death zone to do quests/tasks . 
  could such a feature be a optional gameplay content with depth !? 
  at some point , runescape added a feature where on your first death , you 'd be taken to death 's office and death would explain the death and respawn mechanics to you . 
  i thought it was quite clever . 
  there are ** zero ** mmorpgs that do fantasy right anyway . 
  most of them have fucking industrial age shit . 
  it annoys the hell out of me . 
  gnomes in wow are stupid . 
  all action combat is terrible , imo . 
  dota does combat right . 
  not a hint of action , yet it 's action-packed . 
   start a list . 
  i 'm genuinely interested . 
  dota 2 , all the other games that sell cosmetic items . 
   which is fine . 
  it 's why you have two choices if you want sub only in a mainstream game , wow or ff14 . 
  but you 're in a minority of mmo players ... the market would suggest the vast majority is fine with the current b2p/f2p + cash shop model, 
  the market suggests that anyone that does n't like that model just plays other games . 
  sounds like theme park nonsense . 
  f2p games do n't have to exist . 
  it 's almost like thousands of games made more than enough money in the past without microtransactions and thousands of games still do . 
  that does n't make any sense at all , sorry . 
  you 're talking about removing bad cards , not good cards . 
  all of the mmorpgs released before about 2010 . 
  literally every single one . 
  ** all other games that sell cosmetic items **, 
  which is why the mmorpg industry has way fewer players than it used to : the prevalent business model is driving players away . 
  no it is n't . 
  it 's extremely well polished and reasonably well balanced . 
  nobody said it was n't , so your ` answer ' is irrelevant . 
  instancing and phasing of the open world . 
  dungeons are a different issue . 
  dota is absolutely a moba . 
  ** all other games that sell cosmetic items **, 
  what does ` making millions ' have to do with anything ? 
  making millions over what time frame ? 
  a month ? 
  a week ? 
  a year ? 
  the entire lifetime of the game ? 
  everquest , ultima online , meridian 59 , dark age of camelot , world of warcraft , ... the list goes on and on . 
  that 's just the most prominent mmorpgs . 
  there are lots of others that also made more money than they cost to make and maintain . 
   yeah , all those games made back then cost far less to make . 
  because they knew the market and knew how much they could realistically make in the market . 
   if you need an example look at swtor . 
  that game cost $ 300 - $ 400 million to make and market . 
  i remember the figure being more like $ 200m , but either way it 's huge . 
  and it 's because they wasted a gigantic amount of money on full voice acting and many other such things . 
  they did n't have to spend that much , they thought that it would be worthwhile to . 
  they were wrong . 
   if they wanted to make that back in 3 years charging a subscription fee of $ 15 a month they would need almost 9 million subscribers all of which have to stay for the entire 3 years . 
  just to break even . 
  that was bloody silly of them then , was n't it ? 
   now let 's look at an old mmo . 
  wow for example cost around $ 65 million to make , which means using the same model as above they only needed 1.4 million subscribers to break even . 
  you ca n't even compare the two . 
  9 million subscribers to 1.4 million . 
  swtor would have had to raise their subscription fee to $ 95 a month to be able to break even in 3 years with the same number of subs as wow . 
  swtor 's developers ** chose ** to spend that much money . 
  well , the publishers did . 
  they did a cost-benefit analysis and ** chose ** to spend a huge amount of money . 
  if you think about it , it was n't * that * silly . 
  they expected to be able to get the star wars fanbase ( which is gigantic , so even a small amount of people would be millions ) and the mmorpg fanbase ( at wow 's peak , it looked like it was growing hugely as a genre , they did n't realise that wow was the special case ) . 
   expecting modern mmos to be able to pay the bills the same way old ones did is unrealistic . 
  no it is n't . 
  it 's unrealistic to expect profitability and success from a game that does n't do anything new or innovative or interesting to get tens of millions of subscribers and keep them for years when nobody has ever done that successfully , while spending 3-4x as much as your competition spent . 
  that does n't * at all * mean that no modern mmorpg could be profitable without microtransactions , lol . 
  it definitely is n't . 
  i do n't think you understand my point . 
  you 're saying that it 's a good thing for ffxiv to remove * irrelevant and underpowered * abilities , and that if they did n't , it would look unpolished and messy . 
  i responded by pointing out that lots of games do n't compulsively remove content all the time , and gave hearthstone and magic as examples . 
  you then start talking about bannings . 
  bannings are completely unrelated to this . 
  bannings are like nerfs in computer games . 
  nobody is saying that they should let overpowered , unbalancing , and unfun abilities stay around . 
  that definitely is n't good for the game . 
  but that 's not what we 're discussing . 
  we were discussing removing abilities that people are n't using . 
  but if you do that , you 'll never have a deep game with lots of options for players . 
  if you keep older abilities as you add more , you open up options to players , you create the possibility of different builds and combos and synergies . 
  that old ability that is crap on the surface ends up being really good with a newly made ability , making another build for players to try out . 
  this makes players feel really clever , and like the game was designed really well . 
  and it is good , open-ended design . 
  players do n't like feeling like every character build is just handed down from on high by the developers . 
  they want to be creative , discover synergy , and build their own character . 
  that 's the same thing . 
  nothing , but you 're giving up game 1 every match , which is awful . 
  sshh you 're not allowed to admit that mtgo league 5-0s do n't matter and we have almost no reliable metagame data about legacy . 
  i 'm not listing literally every single game made before the advent of microtransactions in a post . 
  you know what they are . 
   the problem with what you are talking about is that best version exists and even in things like levelling dungeons , rage and kicking happen when you do n't have a skill that is `` necessary '' . 
  do n't do dungeons with douchebags , then ? 
  also i strongly disagree that there is a ` best ' option in any well-designed game . 
   but , i should point out that role skills is a thing in ffxiv and you can only pick 5 that allows you to choose your skills . 
  i do n't really understand this sentence . 
  could you rephrase ? 
   but , irrelevant skills create button bloat which is a huge problem for ps4 players as rotations are built around the idea of using all of your skills . 
  that 's poor design , in my opinion .
