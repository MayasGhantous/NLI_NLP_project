  [ that 's not what midrange or aggro-control mean . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/magictcg/comments/4shoq0/whats_the_difference_between_midrange_tempo_and/ ) these are well-established terms . 
  i have a degree in mathematics . 
  it appears you have a case of dunning-kruger : you think you 're more intelligent than you are . 
  the poll is not a representative sample . 
  that a sample size of 500 is sufficient for a poll to be accurate is only true * if the sample is a fair and representative sample * . 
  lots of people do n't use the internet . 
  lots of people do n't use mainstream news sites . 
  lots of people do n't have time to fill in online polls . 
  those factors * do not * distribute evenly over the population . 
  what does that have to do with the comment you 're replying to ? 
  i think you 'll find they would love a job , but have completely given up hope of getting one . 
  we should get rid of unemployment benefits and have the government provide unlimited work to people that want to do it . 
  that 's a faulty premise . 
  there 's no evidence prices would rise if we lowered unskilled immigration . 
  bars are required to ask for id from anyone that looks under 25 . 
  personally i think it should be 30 . 
  it 's not hard , you need to get your wallet out anyway . 
   in this prohibionist , alcohol-demonisng culture, 
  lol . . what ? 
  new zealand is about the furthest you can get from a prohibitionist or alcohol-demonising culture ... 
   die for your country, 
  please get this americanised rhetoric out of here . 
   buy a house, 
  you can do this before 18, 
   get married, 
  you can do this before 18, 
   vote, 
  why does this have anything to do with voting ? 
  18-year-olds are children . 
  21 is the real age of majority . 
  are you trolling ? 
  * de facto * by definition means not the law . 
  personally i think that on-license alcohol should have no excise tax or a much lower excise tax . 
  this has two major benefits :, 
  it supports bars and restaurants . 
  it 's good for tourism ( people * will * point out how cheap our alcohol is in restaurants when they get home to their families and friends ) . 
  it encourages people - especially young people without much money - to drink in established safe environments . 
  instead of it being * cheaper * to buy alcohol from the supermarket and drink it in an unregulated , unsupervised setting , it would be cheaper to drink alcohol at a bar where :, 
  you ca n't be served if you are drunk, 
  you ca n't drive home if you are drunk, 
  i really do n't know where you get this idea that there 's ` public demonisation of drinking ' . 
  there 's public demonisation of * binge drinking * and * underage drinking * , because these are almost always * totally unsupervised and unregulated * . 
   you are saying that a person is old enough to have a say in the way the country is run , old enough to go to sign up for military service , old enough to enter into binding legal agreements but can ' buy a pint at the pub ? 
  come off it . 
  i 'm obviously not / u/garethmorgannz , but ... yes ? 
  why would these be related ? 
  come off it . 
   as a 19yo at uni - fuck top , fuck gareth , fuck him, 
  19yo and every second word is ` fuck ' . 
  no surprises there . 
  that 's not the only reason or the primary reason . 
  of course they will say that . 
  they have a vested interest in saying that . 
  the reality is that labour costs are a small part of a supermarket 's costs . 
  their prices would probably go up a bit , but not by a lot . 
   asia, 
  the only asian country i 've been to is a muslim one . 
  so i ca n't agree with you there . 
   europe, 
  yes . 
   you can buy alcohol 24/7 , you do n't have politicians debating increasing the legal drinking age , you do n't get `` dry public holidays '' , `` alcohol purchase curfews '' etc. 
  that does n't mean we 're ` demonising ' anything . 
  they have plenty of binge drinking in germany , sweden , norway , denmark and the uk , i can tell you that . 
   alcohol is available and widely consumed in nz . 
  but this does n't mean it 's perceived as an entirely normal thing . 
  that is in fact exactly what it means . 
  what is not perceived as normal or healthy is * binge drinking * , because it is n't normal or healthy . 
  you asked ` so you 're openly promoting writing de facto laws ? ', 
  that question makes * no sense * . 
  nobody is promoting writing ` de facto ' laws . 
  gareth is not saying ` we should raise the drinking age so to 18 so that 16 will become the de facto drinking age ' . 
  and there 's no such thing as a ` de facto law ' anyway . 
  it makes no sense . 
  * de facto * contrasts with * de jure * lit . 
  * by law * . 
  i 'll put it this way : less than a third of the average professional firm 's costs are labour costs . 
  that 's professional firms : firms whose non-labour costs mostly come down to rent , power and printer paper , and whose labour costs are very high per person . 
  supermarkets have ** much ** higher material costs and they pay ** fuck all ** . 
  the thread is n't about minimum wage employees . 
   well you 're right about less than a third, 
  waaaaay less than that , i think . 
   but its still not an insignificant amount and considering the huge power and plant costs , any extra cost to the guy i was speakng to would have to be passed on . 
  but their labour costs are much smaller as a proportion of their income than their power costs for example . 
  i do n't recall supermarket prices being more higher in winter , when power in presumably more expensive ? 
  that entirely depends on the business . 
  for a supermarket , definitely not . 
  huge power costs , huge material costs , huge transportation costs . 
  very low labour costs . 
  and that 's precisely what they are doing , yes . 
  but they would n't be minimum wage jobs if they had to compete for nz workers . 
  i interpreted it as meaning what you said . 
  maybe if you did n't mean ` de facto ' and meant some other rubbish you should fucking say what you mean . 
   as someone who lives in co and loved nz , you guys could really use legal weed . 
  we do n't need americans telling us what we could ` really use ' , thanks . 
  awesome , good to have an ear on the inside . 
  right but we do n't have that * now * . 
  yes kate sheppard and her merry band of fools wanted to ban alcohol , but thankfully they 're long gone . 
  shaman . 
   what would be a minimium wage job then ?
