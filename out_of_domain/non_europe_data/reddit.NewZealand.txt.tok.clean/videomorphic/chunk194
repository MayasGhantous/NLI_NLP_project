  the core sets ** failed ** as ` the set for new players ' . 
  that 's one of the primary reasons they got rid of them . 
  they were a ** failure ** in that respect . 
  given that they have n't changed anything to address this , they will continue to fail as ` the set for new players ' . 
  why would new players play with a set from more than a year ago when everyone else is playing with new and more interesting cards ? 
  they just wo n't . 
  they did n't in the past and they wo n't now . 
  firstly , you 're responding to something that 's 3 months old for some reason . 
  secondly , you 're just objectively wrong . 
  they have n't changed what the actual issue was : them being tied to the normal set release cycle . 
  none of those things have anything to do with why the core set was never the set for new players . 
  you 've totally missed the point . 
  nobody is talking about genetics . 
  the mtgo data has always been crap . 
  easy to say when you 're sitting here on reddit i bet, 
  because it 's a hugely warped metagame . 
  it 's also not really any more relevant than any local metagame of any significant size , yet it gets covered as if it represents all of legacy . 
  because it 's highly misrepresentative of legacy as a whole . 
  hugely warped by various price differences and just being yet another local inbred metagame . 
  there is no good metagame data for legacy other than what people are playing in your own local meta . 
  given that people constantly talk about `` the meta '' as if there 's a universal , global , homogeneous metagame , i ca n't really say i can accept `` nobody is saying that it 's a good way to predict what your local meta will look like '' . 
  that does n't exist . 
  it 's called rg combo lands for a reason : it 's a combo deck at heart . 
  if you want to play a control deck play bug lands or rug lands . 
  russia is a normal capitalist country . 
  it has a lot of similarities with the us . 
  stop getting defensive . 
  no it is n't . 
  there is no line . 
  they are the same thing . 
  the us has plenty of privately-owned businesses . 
  virtually every country has more state owned businesses than the us . 
  no this is just silly . 
  there is already a discord for legacy . 
  you do n't need a whole discord for lands . 
  add a lands channel . 
  better yet just use the existing source thread . 
  that 's really disappointing . 
  discord is a terrible place for that sort of discussion . 
  hard to search , invite only , etc. 
  source threads are the best thing about legacy . 
  odd that there are no replies saying knight of the reliquary , when it 's clearly the most common 3-drop to play on turn 2 in the format already . 
  drop of honey is bad . 
  this is the first time i 've seen it in lands . 
  and yet it still needed to be said . 
  we really should though, 
  should be deported, 
  . . which is just stupid . 
  net neutrality is a waste of time in nz . 
  it 's a device that exists because of us monopolies . 
  it 's irrelevant to nz . 
  vodafone owns their cable infrastructure . 
  because the lower class does n't have as much money . 
  if the education system were up to a reasonable standard then they would n't need to be cleaners . 
  polish immigrants could be cleaners . 
   it would be ridiculously authoritarian to force people to only allow their children to be educated in a manner of the state 's choosing . 
  no it would n't . 
   just in progressive , westernised cultures that are n't built on millennia of oppressive theocracy . 
  europe is entirely built on millennia of oppressive theocracy tho, 
  not in the bible = made up by popes to serve their political needs . 
  did they have the right to use it ? 
  it 's a lovely photo , good job !, 
  winning and losing rugby games has nothing to do with venue . 
  bugger . 
  at least they credited you ... 
   secondly , what does fox mean when she said that she wanted trains that were n't necessarily electric but did n't want diesels ? 
  is she hinting that steam trains should be put back on the line ? 
  she 's just being evasive and does n't want to commit to anything . 
  it 's rather typical of her . 
  because it normalises corporate involvement in governance . 
  when half of government services are provided by government-owned companies instead of directly provided by government departments , it 's a hell of a lot easier for the slimy fuckers to argue for selling them off , partial privatising them , or allowing private competition . 
  everyone say it with me : shared cultural values, 
   the major providers still have to absorb this increase in cost in winter and so put up their winter rates accordingly . 
  they do n't , they have fixed prices across the year . 
   unfortunately though these lower prices come with contracts that extend for months or years - that is if you change retailer to get a lower price now , this will come with a contract, 
  that 's not how it works . 
  the days of 24-month contracts are long , long gone . 
  i ca n't believe people in auckland pay for their water while farmers in canterbury do n't . 
  it 's fucking ludicrous . 
  farmers should be paying for water * well * before bloody bottled water factories . 
  nothing gets lost on a forum . 
  everything gets lost about a day after posting it on discord . 
  that 's not how economics works mate . 
  no it would n't . 
  it would be corporate welfare . 
  nobody is ` magicking up ' anything . 
  more educated populace =  more productive populace =  better jobs . 
  using immigrant labour to do menial jobs =  natives can do better jobs . 
  that 's not how economics works either . 
  the more things there are , the more demand there is . 
  people are n't happy today with what people were delighted with 40 years ago . 
  the demand is not the same . 
  that 's not how society works . 
  people are n't happy today with what people were delighted with 40 years ago . 
  well they do in both versions . 
   i 'd love for runescape to finally take on a wasd control scheme like modern mmos , hopefully finally getting rid of the tiny delays runescapes always had when taking an action . 
  top down click-to-move is the whole appeal of runescape . 
  any game with a cash shop is worthless pay to win garbage . 
  end .
