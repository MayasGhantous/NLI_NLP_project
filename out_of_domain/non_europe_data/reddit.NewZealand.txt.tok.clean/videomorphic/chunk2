  without further clarification i ca n't quite work out what you would want to be different from gw1 . 
  sorry but that 's just silly . 
  it has literally never tried to secede . 
  so he wants an expansion pack or update for gw1 ? 
  updating the graphics , animations and ui does n't require redoing the whole game . 
   sigh , that is not the single characteristic . 
  and let 's be clear even gw1 has a cash shop , but go look at what you can buy in it as compared to the standard korean mmo cash shop . 
  what is another characteristic of modern mmos ? 
  they have slightly better graphics and all have cash shops . 
   point is gw1 suffers some problems of convenience and other things ( like you ca n't jump ) . 
  eugh ` convenience ' . 
  how i 'm sick of hearing that justification for ruining games . 
   the pvp matchmaking system could use an overhaul as you would expect to see in any current mmo . 
  so update it . 
   the graphics would need to get bumped up obviously . 
  why ? 
  the graphics are fine ... 
   mostly though it 's about how the game organizes the players into doing things that could get a bit of a revamp . 
  i 'm personally fine with the instancing that gw1 used . 
  it allowed for so much more of the game to feel tailored just for the party experience , as compared to other mmos where you run the standard boring dungeon as your party instancing . 
  so , do n't update it or do ? 
  it needs a revamp , but you like it how it is ? 
  that seems contradictory , maybe i misunderstood what you meant . 
  why does anyone care ? 
  tying their salaries to the average income is one thing , but setting it at exactly that income ? 
  that 's just absurd . 
  why should they get , for an extremely stressful job with literally zero job security , where they are constantly in the public spotlight , get a lower starting salary than a straight-out-of-uni graduate software developer ? 
  who would choose to go into politics ? 
  still says :, 
   new zealand says quit eu : pm says future will be ` exciting ' if britain votes for brexit, 
  it absolutely is true for teaching . 
  i would happily be a secondary school mathematics and physics teacher , but i just refuse to do it with the current levels of pay , and given the massive crisis and lack of teachers in that area i 'm not alone !, 
  awesome !, 
   * the focus on `` inequality '' in the hacker 's `` manifesto '' is strongly eurocentric given the massive decline in global poverty and inequality since 1980 . 
   * the references to john key and new zealand are wildly out of proportion to their actual importance in the panama papers , with new zealand mentioned in just 0.5 percent of the papers and mr key not at all , suggesting the hacker has a vendetta against the prime minister and new zealand . 
  he 's barely mentioned at all outside of nz in relation to the panama papers . 
   the prime minister has even been able to present himself as one of the lads on commercial radio after being thrown out of parliament . 
  and best of all for a prime minister who cares about nothing other than re-election , private national party polling has seen his party end the week on a respectable 46 percent , 20 points ahead of his woeful labour rivals . 
  sounds really private . 
   disclosure : matthew hooton 's public relations and lobbying firm , exceltium , has clients in the legal services industry offering trust services to domestic and international clients . 
  these views are his own . 
   the economy and the government 's fiscal position have turned out to be stronger than forecast . 
  the economy is in fucking shambles . 
   labour 's racist claims about foreign house buyers have been proven false ,, 
   while auckland home owners also had good news in the april sales data . 
  lol i beg your pardon, 
  when you drive on that sort of terrain you get pretty damn good at driving backwards . 
  no it does not . 
  the game does not need updated graphical effects , it frankly does n't need a single graphical update whatsoever , but one can always boost the texture resolution in an existing engine . 
  graphics are ** completely and utterly meaningless ** . 
  people should stop trying to make every mmorpg into the next wow . 
  in no other genre do we see every single developer trying to do exactly the same thing . 
  look at shooters . 
  yes you see activision and ea chasing each others ' tails trying to compete for the best muddy brown textures in the next modern day ` realistic ' shooter . 
  but outside of that there is so much variation and so much choice . 
  you 've got military sims like arma , you have competitive fpses like csgo , you 've got really casual fun stuff like overwatch and tf2 and all that . 
  and lots of other things . 
  there is just so much variety . 
  whereas in the mmorpg space , it seems that people only know how to build extremely high budget aaa mmorpgs . 
  well just stop it . 
  stop trying to make the next wow killer . 
  stop trying to make such high-budget mmos . 
  make something low-budget . 
  low-budget games are successful in other genres . 
  why could n't they be successful here ? 
  why is a game achieving the same subscription base as the original everquest a failure in the eyes of most gamers today ? 
  it 's not actually because expectations have changed . 
  it 's because games these days have enormously inflated budgets and getting that level of subscription count ** is ** a failure . 
  you do n't need investment or a big team to make an mmorpg . 
  it 's not ` indie ' when you have a kickstarter or an investor . 
  go make it on your own . 
  andrew gower did it , and now jagex is the biggest game developer in the uk . 
  that 's not vr . 
  vr is n't `` the exactly experience of being there '' . 
  vr certainly does n't require you to be standing in that absurd contraption . 
  what is unfair to them is that the only thing affecting those people is herd immunity , compromised by morons not vaccinating their children . 
  publishers are n't developers . 
   an mmo takes a lot longer and require way more resources than a traditional game to make . 
   look at all these kickstart mmos that release and are bare bones compared to what they originally wanted to be in the indie sphere . 
  i doubt an indie game is going to be the next big mmorpg anytime soon , regardless of how niche and unique their ideas are . 
  they just do n't have the budget , and without a major ip wo n't have much of a way to market to get that budget while in development where it needs it most . 
  you do not need a big budget to make an mmorpg . 
   it 's a massive risk to step into this field , which forces the aaa developers to always side on the safe side . 
  it 's no greater risk to make an mmorpg when you have n't made mmorpgs before than to make an fps when you have n't made fpses before . 
  they 're not risky to step into this field because they 're mmorpgs , they 're risky because they 're * a different genre from the previous one * for most developers . 
   i 'd argue that shooters are all really similar too . 
  space shooters , future earth shooters , ww2 shooters , modern combat shooters , zombie shooters - each with one or two things to try to set them apart ( arena based , respawning shields vs hp , classes vs. gear pickup , etc ) . 
  a lot lot lot more diversity than mmorpgs . 
   we have all of these in mmorpgs , but with how much commitment this genre takes , people usually just go back to the home base . 
  you can pick up cod and be fine at it right off the bat after playing a month of tf2 , but you need to commit a week or two to get anywhere with an mmo , and no one can figure out how to make that aspect last more than a month for most people . 
  i have n't subbed to an mmo for more than 2 months since wow . 
  nobody can figure out how to make that aspect last more than a month ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
  it 's not even slightly difficult to make it last more than a month . 
   so far no one knows how to solve the puzzle of making mmo 's awesome again , as everyone loves them for completely different reasons . 
  the formula is beyond stale , and no one can think of any way to spice it up other than copy oldschool games 50 times and hope yours gets that random spark of love . 
  i 've seen so many indie ultima online clones that crash and burn , it hurts . 
  the private 1999 uo servers are more popular than these games ever get , since nothing can compete with a game with a decade of content . 
  there are literally zero indie ultima online clones . 
  people claim that people try and fail to make pvp mmos or daoc clones or uo clones but they 're talking shit .
