  these are very balanced cards overall , which is absolutely where commons should be . 
  commons should include strong cards , but commons generally should n't be bombs and should n't be trash . 
  you 've mostly got that right . 
  ** abiru soulcaller : ** i think this should be a 2/1 or 1/3 . 
  this is probably better than arashin cleric and lone missionary , which is solidly in ` best example of this effect ever put on a 2 mana creature ' territory . 
  i 'd be especially careful if you have a significant token theme , or if there are other rewards for lifegain in the set . 
  incidental lifegain on a bear is better than on a 1/3 , as you are going to be able to race more often , and lifegain in a race is great . 
  this definitely is n't overpowered though . 
  ** attended elder : ** seems entirely reasonable . 
  vigilance is about comparable to first strike on a 2/2 , i think . 
  ** bird 's eye view : ** these effects basically are n't done at sorcery . 
  this should be an instant . 
  they 're just not useful effects unless you 're using them as a combat trick . 
  they let you both use them after blockers ( even if the flying is lost ) or before blockers ( for flying and boost ) . 
  the gameplay at sorcery-speed is just . . bad . 
  in terms of power , this is also very pushed . 
  +3 / +3 and flying is 2w . 
  so +2 / +2 , flying , lifelink ( which is better ) should be at least 2w . 
  ** break the sword : ** i think the flavour here is an issue . 
  a card called ` break the sword ' would be expected to destroy equipment . 
  if it destroys artifacts and has a bonus for a particular type of artifact , i would definitely expect it to be equipment !, 
  there 's a bit of another issue , though . 
  you always have to choose the second target !, 
  this means you ca n't cast this unless there are two artifacts on the battlefield . 
  that 's because the artifacts are chosen upon * casting * but the check for it being a token is done on * resolution * . 
  i understand this is intended to be an invent hoser , but if you want to keep the flavour , i think that `` destroy target artifact . 
  if it was an equipment , draw a card '' or `` destroy target equipped creature and all equipment attached to that creature '' . 
  to word the invent hoser , i think you need something like this :, 
   choose one : destroy target nontoken artifact ; or destroy up to two target token artifacts, 
  ** camel rider : ** basically the white version of nirkana assassin . 
  unfortunately , i think it 's basically in the same position in limited : it 's just not where you want to be . 
  conditional vigilance is quite marginal . 
  nirkana assassin could theoretically blow someone out by using lifegain + growth combat trick to kill one creature and turn on deathtouch to kill another . 
  but at the best this is a 3/2 vigilance for 3 , which is just bad . 
  ** dune signaler : ** based purely on a vanilla test , it 's a 4 mana 3/3 . 
  it also has what looks like it 's probably a pretty marginal benefit . 
  if you have a lot of creatures that give the archetype tokens abilities , then it could be good . 
  but it 's a lot of investment to give a creature vigilance for one turn . 
  4 mana 3/3 with marginal benefit is fine , but it seems fairly marginal . 
  now if it gave * lifelink * , then we 'd be talking . 
  then it would be a solid card , still expensive and one-off for the ability , but a strong ability . 
  but vigilance ? 
  ** inhibit creativity : ** strictly better arrest is definitely too strong . 
  could be changed to only inhibiting blocking or attacking , or just made more expensive . 
  at 4 mana these effects are pretty bad though , so i 'd suggest stopping attacking , which fits with white 's defensive stance . 
  ** kadir apothecary : ** seems very similar to abiru soulcaller : a white bear with some conditional lifegain . 
  there it was at least 1 life , immediately , and potentially a lot more . 
  here it 's saccing artifacts for 2 life at a time , for 1 mana . 
  maybe a bit too much overlap ? 
  ** kadir legion : ** this is strictly better than the couple of existing 3/5s for 4w . 
  i do n't see why it needs to be power creep . 
  just make it a 3/5 ? 
  ** lethal ambush : ** depending on how good making a 1/1 is in this set , this could be fine at ww ( if it 's mostly irrelevant ) or very strong at 2w ( if it 's really good ) . 
  you have mentioned ` thrive ' , so i 'm going to suggest the current value is good . 
  ** plentiful harvest : ** another in the long line of ` but is 10 enough ? ', 
  and the answer being : no , it still is n't . 
  this is a terrible , unplayable card . 
  i suspect the only reason wotc prints them is so that people can tell new players that they 're bad , and i do n't think that 's a valid justification for wasting cardboard on this dreck . 
  sorry , i just hate it when they print obviously garbage cards for no reason , and this falls into this category . 
  ** punyian blademaster : ** 1/2 with first strike for 1w . 
  first strike squire . 
  i do n't see this as much different from youthful knight . 
  it 's worse , definitely , but not by a lot . 
  if the * thrive * is easily achieved , then it 's great . 
  if not , it 's pretty bad . 
  ** raise the alarm : ** nice, 
  ** soaring visionary : ** strictly worse assault griffin , which was an okay card in limited , not even in the top 5 white commons . 
  definitely do n't nerf this . 
  3/2 for 4 is bad , 3/2 * always-flying * for 4 is okay . 
  3/2 conditional flying for 4 is playable but definitely not overpowered . 
  ** suntail hawk : ** i would never play this . 
  it does n't enable thrive any more than any other creature would except perhaps by being so bad that your opponent does n't bother killing it . 
  ** tandem tactics : ** perfectly acceptable combat trick, 
  ** trumpet 's call : ** you should be able to give all your creatures +1 / +1 permanently for this mana cost . 
  so giving it for just one turn is quite bad , definitely . 
  it all rests on the thrive . 
  the thrive feels maybe a little bit win-more , although that 's true in general . 
  if you already have 5 creatures , then giving them all +2 / +1 is quite reasonable . 
  it 's still not great , but it 's a blowout in limited your opponents will definitely play around . 
  ** watchful lammasu : ** this is fine . 
  dawnfeather eagle is strictly better , as it also buffs all your creatures and gives them vigilance . 
  but ghostly sentinel and angel of light exist , and were good commons , so this is n't * bad * . 
  it 's fine . 
  it 's good . 
  i think you should keep it as it is . 
  overall , i think that the idea of * thrive * plus * invent * is good . 
  they feed into each other . 
  i think you should probably consider having an extra * invent * card , though . 
  maybe one of the common combat tricks could * invent * . 
  if it did , then you could sac that token at instant speed to do something in combat . 
  unfortunately , none of them so far do anything interesting in combat . 
  the cards with the invent mechanic feel a bit underwhelming . 
  i like the idea , i think it works . 
  but the actual cards themselves . . they 're just a bit weak . 
  gaining a bit of life and giving a bit of vigilance is just not worth a mechanic . 
  they 're also kind of pushing around weirdly to me . 
  in one sense , you want multiples , so that you can double up on the abilities . 
  the ` invent ' cards are saying ` i 'm giving you a token , you can sac it to do this . 
  if you get more , then you can sac them to do this as well ! ', 
  but the other invent cards have their own abilities you want to use .
