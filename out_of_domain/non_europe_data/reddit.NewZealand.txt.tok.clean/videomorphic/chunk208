  instead they are fed bad information and may make decisions based upon said bad information . 
  as the saying goes , garbage in , garbage out . 
  will this player have an improved experience since it was harder to solve the metagame ? 
  doubtful . 
  no , it does n't . 
  nobody is looking at the new lists and assuming this . 
  if mtggoldfish continues presenting its metagame percentages , then they 're being intentionally misleading . 
  wotc 's intent is precisely that you ** should n't ** be using this data to work out how much of the metagame a deck represents . 
   this is also an awkward directive for non-rotating formats which have access to functional reprints . 
  want to play essence scatter in pauper ? 
  you can , or you can play remove soul or false summoning . 
  there are enough such cards , ones where the functions are similar enough as to not lose any real equity in a game , that swapping them for each other in the hope of hitting 5-0 and thereby increasing your chances of being showcased is a real factor . 
  such an occurrence would not showcase format diversity ; it displays a person gaming the system . 
  this is a ** massive ** issue wotc clearly did n't consider . 
  no , it can not . 
  them acknowledging it has * literally nothing to do with it * . 
  if it 's gambling then it 's gambling * regardless of what they say * . 
  if it is n't gambling then them saying ` the cards have secondary market value ' is just them stating a true fact that everyone already knows , it does n't make it gambling . 
  no , they did n't . 
  czech pile is a fine deck and so is new miracles . 
  they 're both tier 1 control decks . 
  that 's a misrepresentation of what i said . 
  if they were n't as hideous they 'd be worth way more . 
  my fundamental view is that legacy is a casual format . 
  every strategy other than simple aggro is playable and viable . 
  play what you like , with the cards you have , and stop worrying about ` the meta ' . 
  i think that scg legacy opens had a very negative effect on the format , pushing a few decks that were popular with the best grinders . 
  those were n't the best decks or the most popular , but they soon did become so . 
  it also presented a small slice of the us meta as the global meta , which is a bad thing . 
  the european metagame , the australian metagame , the japanese metagame . . totally totally different . 
  most local metagames , totally different again . 
  i think mtgo data is even worse , because it 's really no more notable than any set of local events in some random spot on the globe . 
  imagine if we got people posting the top 8 of some local event in melbourne ** every single day ** for weeks after the top ban . 
  because that 's what we got from mtgo . 
  and i honestly think that that data was as less useful sample than a hypothetical daily snapshot of some specific , local , reasonably large metagame anywhere in the world . 
  put a double space at the end of each line of your post to make them look like below :, 
  what a pricey pile , gon na need a payczech to get some of these cards . 
  trying to flesh out a list and looking for input - especially on the sb . 
  still new to the deck .

  ** tip for everyone : click formatting help below the textbox . 
   if wizards acknowledges the secondary market value of their cards , if for some reason they come under fire for violating gambling statutes , that can be used as evidence against them in court . 
  no it can not . 
  acknowledging that cards have secondary market value is not evidence of anything . 
   is a booster pack gambling ? 
  there 's precedent that says no , but precedent is n't everything . 
  and if an official representative of wizards of the coast says `` you have a great chance of opening an expensive card in this pack , '' that is evidence . 
  no it is n't . 
  it 's not evidence . 
  you * do * have a chance of opening an expensive card in a pack . 
  that 's objective fact . 
  it does n't change based on whether they say it or not . 
  either they are gambling or they are not . 
  their statements have no impact on that . 
   there 's a chance they found a direct link to the image and never saw the flickr page stating copyright . 
  that 's not how copyright works . 
  copyright always applies to everything automatically . 
  ` all rights reserved ' is the default . 
  there 's absolutely no excuse for a media company to not ask permission . 
  kiwi non-lawyers know far more about nz law than american lawyers do . 
  it 's not even close to being significant . 
  it 's not a big enough sample to draw any reasonable conclusions . 
  because there are formats of the game from before they started treating players like idiots . 
   rint it in an unlimited-print set ? 
  yeah , that mox will tank to $ 200 or less . 
  it wo n't . 
  if it would , then why is n't alpha mox ruby the same price as unlimited mox ruby ? 
  the demand for those cards will go ** up ** and the supply will stay the same . 
  the number of alpha mox rubies will not change . 
   you will destroy stores, 
  no , you wo n't . 
  no store is going to lose out because of mox ruby dropping in price .
