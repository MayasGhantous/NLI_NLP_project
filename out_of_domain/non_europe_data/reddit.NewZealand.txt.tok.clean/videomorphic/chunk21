  then they should play a singleplayer rpg or one of the many existing mmorpgs that provide carebear servers where you never have to interact with anyone unless you want to . 
   they do become easier to build and program . 
  no , they do not . 
   are you really claiming here that running a single shard server with 20,000 players is as easy as running 2000 servers with 10 players ? 
  are you really claiming that valve spin up a new vm for every 10-player game of csgo or dota 2 ? 
  you have the same number of people on any particular piece of hardware either way . 
  how it worked in exactly one theme park game called eq , you mean . 
   actually , field camping is a real issue . 
  ff14 tried to solve this by letting everyone get the same loot , but that game basically expects you to not keep it for long . 
  a real issue in ... what ? 
  everquest ? 
  a game that nobody has played in years ... ? 
  a game that is as theme park as you can get ? 
   in majority the games with of endgame gear/rares that requires to camp non-instanced bosses , you need to wait a loooong time for the respawn and the drop actually dropping . 
  i have not played a single game that managed to solve that issie well , including runescape , the game with the least wait time . 
  you do not need to wait more than literally 10 seconds for the average boss to respawn in runescape . 
   do remember , they need to make these items rare enough to that their supplies are manageable by the makers without directly removing them . 
  firstly , items should * absolutely * be directly removed by the game mechanics . 
  the idea that players dislike degrading items is thoroughly debunked . 
  players have no problem at all with degrading items . 
  secondly , items do n't have to be super rare in games . 
  thirdly , there are many ways to make items rare in games other than having long respawn times . 
  you could do what * literally * every mmorpg does and have random drops . . 
   and what happens when no one is up for [ dungeon ] ? 
  you could start off by joining a guild that actually plays the game instead of one that just spams / g with stupid shit . 
  it takes a while to find a guild that actually plays most mmos these days instead of standing in cities chatting all day , but they do exist . 
  if even then nobody wants to do it , you play with other people . 
  unless the game you 're playing has a terribly cancerous role system that causes extreme waits for a single role ( cough trinity cough ) you should have no problem finding other people for group content . 
  you can also do more than one thing at once . 
  you know that right ? 
  that you can do more than one thing at once ? 
  you do n't have to sit around afk while finding a group . 
  you can actually find a group while * playing the game * . 
  if games actually had gameplay that encouraged people to work together out in the world , instead of soloing everything everywhere all the time , you would be regularly adding helpful people to your friends list like we used to do a decade or more ago . 
   in modern mmos you can have both , ask friends for [ dungeon ] and fill the rest of the spots with a matchmaking system . 
  which destroys immersion , communities and difficulty . 
   remove the matchmaking system and you have to sit out until more people who want to do [ dungeon ] appear , or force someone who does n't want to do [ dungeon ] to do it with you . 
  if there are people that want to do a dungeon , they will want to do the dungeon . 
  what gives you the idea that dungeon finders magically cause more players to appear from thin air ? 
  there 's no irony in anything i said at all . 
  wow grew very quickly in vanilla , continued to grow quickly through burning crusade , and then its growth slowed to a virtual halt in wrath of the lich king . 
  the population peaked in wotlk on the basis of the story being a continuation of frozen throne and the game 's growth and quality in burning crusade . 
  the population soon started dropping as cataclysm was released and has steadily dropped over time since then . 
  each expansion since then has seen a significant boost in population at the expansion release and then steady dropping over time , with * much * bigger drops every time they have a huge content drought at the end of an expansion , which they always do . 
   given that wow grew to a peak of users after several expansions past vanilla . 
  why would population count at a time be a good way of measuring quality ? 
  population growth is . 
  if the game is good , it will retain subscribers and acquire new ones . 
  if the game is not good , it will lose subscribers and not acquire new ones . 
  vanilla and bc had high growth , wotlk was pretty even ( its casualisation causing drops and its great story causing increases , imo ) while the rest have all been net negatives . 
   wow did n't become the most popular mmo of all time by staying static . 
  it literally became the most popular mmo in vanilla and quite honestly inertia has kept it there ever since . 
  if mop , wod or legion were newly released today as brand new mmos , they would be considered wow clones bereft of the magic that made wow special . 
   the only easier part i would accept was that grouping for dungeons in wotlk was a breeze . 
  dungeon finder was added in 3.3 , dude . 
  it had no significant role to play in how people viewed wotlk . 
  wotlk changed threat immensely , for example , which made tanking boring and stale . 
  it was by no means a bad expansion , but it did make the game significantly easier . 
  levelling in wotlk was much easier and faster than in bc or vanilla as well . 
  the biggest terrible feature of wotlk was that they ruined guilds with guild perks . 
  they turned guilds from social experiences where the social group was its own reward into something that encouraged mega guilds ( sometimes called `` cesspool guilds '' ) with completely dead communities that existed just for guild perks . 
  this killed the social experience of the game for new players and made the game much less sticky for them . 
   will you vanilla heroes stop overacting . 
  will you blizzard apologists stop acting like people are ` overacting ' just for liking vanilla ? 
   everything else was eitehr qol changes or better gameplay . 
  so-called `` qol changes '' are not well-liked by the vast majority of people . 
  most people do n't like what you call `` qol changes '' . 
  stuff like guild perks , easier levelling , easier gameplay , easier threat , these might be called `` quality of life '' changes but they were bad for the game . 
  what you call `` better gameplay '' i call more systematised , gamey gameplay . 
  it felt less like a virtual world and more like a theme park . 
  wow has always been a theme park , but wotlk really cemented it as pure modern theme park . 
   that 's why wrath got the highest numbers . 
  wrath 's numbers were ** all ** acquired in vanilla and bc . 
  wrath was when subscriber growth stopped . 
  cata was when it started to fall , but wrath took a game that was growing and made it a game that had stable subscriber numbers . 
  i do n't need to give `` proof '' of anything . 
  literally everyone that has raided in any wow expansion agrees that wotlk was when raiding became easier . 
  is it your habit to quote parts of peoples ' posts out of context and then respond to them in faux disbelief , or was this a one-off ? 
  world of warcraft is the ** only ** mmorpg ( at least since 2004 ) that has n't lost subscribers after an initial boom . 
  every other mmo has done this :, 
  are you actually fucking trolling ? 
  posting a few times on / r/mmorpg is not advertisement . 
  blizzard putting ads on televsion all over the fucking world is advertisement . 
  that 's what they do . 
  we have ads for wow in ** new zealand ** for god 's sake . 
  it 's not even just the us , it 's worldwide . 
  * that * is advertisement . 
  nostalrius has spread entirely through word of mouth . 
  given the context of the post , including a complaint about `` 5 + hour dungeon runs '' , it 's clear that this is yet another person that thinks that gutting the core immersive experience of a virtual world and turning it into a gamey systematised queue simulator is a `` qol update '' . 
  there are three types of interaction : cooperative , competitive and neither ( i.e. 
  purely social/chat , not helping or hindering others ) . 
  instanced dungeons kill cooperative and competitive social interaction in the open world . 
  and yet they were much harder . 
  i 'm not posting my personal details on the internet to please some fucking gamer . 
  the rules ** already exist ** . 
  enforcing the rules is what the mods should be doing . 
  either enforce them or change them . 
  the rules exist for a reason , which is exactly what you say : the unwashed masses , as rude as this might be to say , do not upvote quality content and downvote spammy crap . 
  they upvote easily consumed content and downvote things they disagree with . 
  if there were no moderation here , it would be entirely image macros and self-promoting direct links to youtube videos .
