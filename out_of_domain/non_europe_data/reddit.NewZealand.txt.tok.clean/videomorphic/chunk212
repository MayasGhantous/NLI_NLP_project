  it was great . 
  in fact it 's a fairly similar deck . 
  wasteland/port/aether vial deck that people love splashing random colours in . . 
  it 's not a bad categorisation just because the shitty genre has moved towards that direction . 
  if your 4 colour mana base is n't working , blaming your own wastelands is probably the wrong way of dealing with it . 
   that 's pretty much all to say that some guys spent a shitload of time reverse-engineering the code and made it open source . 
  still not ok legally . 
  that is in fact entirely okay legally . 
   there is a difference between sites that discuss the game and people who recreate it then redistribute it for free/for profit ( whichever the case may be ) . 
  those sites also generally work with blizzard as they add value to their product , not take away . 
  wowhead in fact data mines the game and then redistributes that information through their website . 
  exactly the same as private server developers . 
   i do n't think you can claim this is n't really blizzard 's game because the private server creators generated code to make the game function . 
  the art assets are theirs , and the structure of the game is there , and the code is a best guess at what blizzard 's code would have been . 
  that 's precisely what you can claim . 
  private server developers do n't redistribute the art assets . 
  ` the structure of the game ' is n't copyrightable , that 's an idea , not an expression of an idea . 
  and the code is * absolutely * not owned by blizzard . 
   since the art assets of the game are solely on the the client side , and since the code for the game is n't verbatim ( i 'm not an expert by any means on reverse-engineering laws ) to blizzard 's , ip is likely going to be strongest claim blizzard has against private server owners . 
  there is no such thing as ` ip ' , in reality . 
  ` ip ' is just shorthand for ` copyrighted works , trademarks and patents ' . 
  it is n't an actual thing . 
  blizzard either has a copyright claim ( no , nothing has been copied from blizzard ) , a trademark claim ( it 's not trademark infringement to say ` similar to x ' where x is trademarked ) or a patent claim ( they 've never suggested this ) . 
  you ca n't ` steal customers ' . 
  that 's not how competition laws work . 
   the art assets, 
  no , they are not . 
  the art assets are part of the client , which you already have on your computer . 
   their trademarks, 
  blizzard have never suggested that there are trademark issues here , only copyright issues . 
   their ip, 
  i do n't think you know what ip is . 
   even giving that it 's merely the client device `` using '' the assets under copyright , players do not own those assets . 
  you do not own a single piece of software on your computer . 
  the nature of software related ip , for better or worse , is that all of it is licensed , not assigned and licenses are contracts that demand particular kinds of behavior ( there is more to it than this , i admit , and the contract-license discussion can be quite a technical and granular discussion , but that is n't relevant to the thread here ) . 
  that 's not how the law works . 
  you have a legal right to use any product you have purchased . 
  license agreements that try to limit this are unenforceable . 
  that is ** absolutely ** false . 
   it does n't matter ( legally ), 
  the legal arguments against private servers are weak . 
   it 's their intellectual property . 
  that 's it . 
  i do n't think you actually understand what intellectual property is . 
   private servers arguably hurt their profitability . 
  nobody has a legal right to be profitable . 
  the why part ** is ** important . 
  the reasoning ** is ** important . 
  that 's just not true . 
  hahahaha imagine being so stupid you do n't understand the concept of analogies, 
  if you refilmed the entire star wars movies you should ** absolutely ** be able to redistribute them as you please . 
   but i think if there 's enough instances of blizzard just straight up ignoring people using their assets , they no longer own those assets . 
  that 's not how the law works, 
   they legally have to enforce it to the best of their ability or lose their ip or eula . 
  that opens a door to anyone being able to host a server . 
  that 's not how the law works . 
  you 're just using the terms ` ip ' and ` eula ' without any actual understanding . 
  that 's entirely right , yes . 
  it looks okay , but it looks terrible once you start moving quickly . 
  you 're approaching it from a ` only the end game is the real game ' perspective . 
  that 's the wrong perspective . 
  you ** absolutely ** can copy a physical theme park , build a new copy of it !, 
  that 's completely legal . 
  that 's just not how copyright works . 
  it 's just ... not true . 
  blizzard have n't made any trademark claims as far as i can see . 
   well legally , if they 're aware it exists they have to act . 
  it 's not even a choice . 
  if it 's proven they did n't act promptly to infringement of their copyright , they 'd lose that right to their own intellectual property - something called ` defense of laches ' . 
  this is * hilariously * false . 
  where do you people get these strange ideas ? 
  that 's true of trademarks . 
  not of ` intellectual property ' , whatever you think that is . 
   basically , if blizzard do n't actively fight against people infringing on their ip , they lose the rights to that ip . 
  there 's no such thing as ` an ip ' . 
  you can not ` steal intellectual property ' . 
  that just does n't make any sense at all . 
   the ip kind of is stolen . 
  there 's no such thing as ` an ip ' . 
   did the private server owner come up with the idea for wow ? 
  he took someone else 's idea , just because he did n't take their exact code does n't mean it does n't infringe on ip . 
  copyright does n't protect ideas . 
  it protects * expressions * of ideas . 
   but sure , a silly semantics argument , if you 're technically right then sure , but really it does n't matter , the principle is the same . 
  there 's no ` silly semantics ' here . 
  ideas are not covered by copyright . 
   replaced all the names, 
  the names are all client-side , you do n't need to change them . 
  that 's not how copyright works . 
  they did make their own game . 
   reverse engineering, 
  only in the corporate states of america is reverse engineering illegal lol . 
   they are n't forbidden from doing that , and they are n't recreating the game they are just collecting raw data . 
  game files , not a whole game . 
  recreating something is n't against the law . 
   the structure of the game is not pseudo-code on a whiteboard , it is very much an expression of an idea, 
  no , it is n't . 
  it 's an idea . 
   you ca n't reverse engineer windows , create a bootleg version of it ( windows logo and all ) then release that either . 
  yes you absolutely can .
