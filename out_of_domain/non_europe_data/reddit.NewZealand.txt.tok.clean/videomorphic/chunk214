  like , why play white in your deck when you can play black ? 
  black has better threats and better answers . 
  thoughtseize/iok/fatal push/death 's shadow is just miles better than path / ... geist ? 
  white does n't really have any good threats in modern . 
  the primary reasons to play white in modern are celestial colonnade , supreme verdict and path to exile . 
  so it really only sees play in control decks . 
  stoneforge mystic could make it much more reasonable to play a blue/white fair midrange deck . 
   mtgg, 
  anyone that uses mtggoldfish to get an idea of the meta is an * idiot * . 
  it was inaccurate enough when it was a fairly accurate view of mtgo . 
  now that it 's an inaccurate view of mtgo it 's worthless . 
   valve was trying to argue a generic skeleton king exists . 
  there 's nothing to argue . 
  the idea a ` skeleton king ' character is incredibly generic . 
  nobody would ever win in court trying to argue they owned the concept of a skeleton king character . 
   now blizzard is scared of that happening . 
  so two things . 
  firstly , blizzard is not scared of anything . 
  secondly , skeleton king is a generic character regardless of blizzard 's action or inaction in the past . 
  it was a completely generic and uncopyrightable idea long before blizzard included it in their game . 
  you do n't lose copyright by not enforcing it . 
  that 's just objective fact . 
   please stop talking to me if you 've never held a job better than minimal wage and are unable to grasp how a company functions . 
  i almost certainly make more money than you do , not that that has anything to do with this ... 
  well yes , of course it 's the strongest deck in modern . 
  nobody is disputing that . 
  / u/suthernjustice back to the bullying . 
  no , it does n't . 
  it 's incompatible with what you want to do . 
  you do n't play multiple incompatible t1 plays in the same deck . 
  decks that want to tap out for disruption on turn 1 do n't want to tap out for acceleration on turn 1 as well . 
  xmage 's meta is not at all representative . 
  it should n't . 
  it 's a sample size of 1 . 
  overall , ds still dominates the metagame . 
  that is n't to say it should be banned , but anyone that thought it should before wo n't be swayed by this . 
  but if we continue to get results like this , then sure . 
  4x cryptic is definitely normal . 
  3x logic knot is definitely 1 too many though . 
   gds is a midrange/control deck, 
  lol . 
  it 's an aggressive deck . 
  a very aggressive deck . 
  traditional jund is a control deck . 
  grixis death 's shadow is absolutely an aggro deck . 
  that 's a totally different argument . 
  ` the law does n't matter because $ $ $ ' is the sort of thing someone would say when they realise their argument that the law does matter is shitty . 
  i 'm talking about vial specifically . 
  i think you missed the point quite spectacularly there mate . 
  nobody is saying that it 's legal to redistribute the wow ** client ** . 
  nobody is doing that though . 
  what 's legal is to ** independently recreate ** the wow ** server ** . 
   blizzard made valve change stuff in dota2 due to a legal battle . 
  you 're going to need to source that statement . 
   blizzard then turns the other way when other companies use their assets . 
  you 're definitely going to need a source for that . 
   valve argues why ca n't we do it if these other people make money off of your ip . 
  again , source . 
  that 's a pretty absurd claim . 
   this is why , among plenty of other business reasons , blizzard will not let a provate server stay open . 
  they literally spent millions in court and you 're trying to tell me it did n't happen lmao . 
  again , copyright does n't work like that . 
  it does n't expire ( except after 90 years ) or become generic . 
  that 's trademarks , which are completely unrelated . 
  you should lose everything in your inventory when you die . 
  corpse runs are incredibly boring and tedious . 
  that 's just not realistic . 
   traditional grixis control, 
  which was not a control deck , but a midrange deck . 
   games are n't about racing the opponent, 
  well he 's quite wrong there . 
  in most matchups , in gds , you absolutely want to race . 
  in addition , not always racing does n't make a deck a control deck . 
  it 's a very , very aggressive deck . 
  you do n't intentionally lower your life total to 3 in a control deck lol . 
   think you missed the point . 
  it 's allowing people free access to something that they should n't have . 
  that just does n't make sense . 
   in the same vein , let 's say i went and remade skyrim from the ground up , and hell , even used my own assets . 
  it still a breach of intellectual property . 
  no it would n't be . 
  because if you used your own assets , then it would n't be skyrim . 
  it would be a similar game . 
  cloning a game is not against the law . 
  otherwise activision would have sued ea and vice versa a million times . 
  clones are entirely legal . 
  see : all the many tetris clones , mario clones , pacman clones , etc. 
  if you used their assets , then of course it would be copyright infringement to redistribute them without permission . 
   you 're literally asking for sources that i said in my op that you can go find yourself . 
  if you are so interested in this i 'd think you 'd have the motivation to look into it yourself . 
  i ca n't see any sources in your comment . 
   dota2 straight up should n't exist considering how much it borrows from blizzard . 
  if you play legion it 's not hard to tell blizzard is upset about it because there 's easter egg after easter egg ribbing valve for what they are doing . 
  blizzard can be as upset as they like . 
  but dota 2 is entirely legally fine . 
  that 's how the law works , whether blizzard likes it or not . 
  it 's pretty fucking rich for them to complain given how much their games are clearly ` inspired ' by existing games . 
  starcraft is a clear ripoff of warhammer 40k , for example . 
  warcraft is a clear ripoff of tolkien . 
  that does n't make them illegal .
