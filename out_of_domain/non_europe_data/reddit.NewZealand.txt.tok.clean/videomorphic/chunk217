  you 're an incompetent retard . 
  if you do not ** immediately ** fully disclose security vulnerabilities then you are an irresponsible corporate pawn and you 'll be on the gulag list before too long . 
  yes , surveillance is worse . 
  because it 's hypocritical ... 
  you miss the point . 
  americans throw around ` unconstitutional ' a lot . 
  but it does n't * matter * . 
  something is n't * wrong * because it 's * unconstitutional * . 
  invading privacy is wrong * in and of itself * . 
  it 's unconstitutional * because of that * , not the other way around . 
  if you do n't then you are n't respecting the freedom of your users . 
  maybe you should n't play a deck full of cards you ca n't cast until turn 4 . 
  now ** this ** is badmathematics :, 
  do n't get defensive, 
   diagramatically, 
  i think your diagrams are what is wrong . 
   g o f, 
  personally i 've at least once seen it written as ( f o g ) ( x ) = g ( f ( x ) ), 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's not, 
  i did n't say it was . 
  learn to read . 
  preordain is your 60th card already . 
  the 7th discard spell is n't a flex slot . 
   move to the centre, 
  this will never work , and has never worked . 
  you do not win elections by moving to where focus groups tell you the voters are . 
  you win elections by moving the voters . 
  if the voters are n't ready to move , then you have to wait and be patient . 
  eventually . 
  they always , always do . 
   as a minor party, 
  labour will never be a minor party . 
  no they have n't . 
  why should any of that data impact school funding ... ? 
  all schools should be funded the same based on the number of pupils . 
   the error parents make in thinking that has anything to do with school performance, 
  but it objectively , statistically does have to do with school performance, 
  this is stupid . 
  the whole different funding system is bloody stupid . 
  every school should be funded based on the money they need to run . 
  if they need more teachers because they have more students , that should just be paid for . 
  if they need maintenance done , it should just be paid for . 
  they should get funded for salaries and supplies and those fixed costs just at the same rate as every other school . 
  schools do n't need extra funding for ` at-risk ' students . 
  and schools do n't need ` donations ' . 
  sorry but that 's bullshit . 
  i do n't want to sit on a train for an hour any more than i want to sit in traffic for an hour . 
  and i should n't have to . 
  it should n't be expensive to live in the centre of a city like auckland or christchurch . 
  it is certainly not a ` libertarian ' view . 
  their view is that education is wholly the responsibility of parents . 
  the poor do n't do poorly at school because of some inherent inability . 
  they do so because they 're at schools full of thugs , kids that do n't want to learn , and teachers that could n't get jobs anywhere better . 
  kids that need more attention are those kids significantly under ** or over ** achieving . 
  that 's what should be used as a measure . 
  not the mother 's age . 
  having a teen mother requires what equipment exactly ? 
   that simply is n't backed up by any facts . 
  when we control for socio-economic factors the research actually says it matters very little what school you go to . 
  are you trolling ? 
  of course when you control for socioeconomic factors , socioeconomic factors do n't affect your educational results . 
  you 're controlling for them !, 
  you 're literally factoring them out and then saying ` they do n't affect the results ' . 
   what matters far , far more is your home life , whether your parents take an active role in supporting your education and whether they value education above other things . 
  those factors are massively affected by socio-economic level . 
  the other pupils at a school absolutely , unequivocally have an effect on a child 's education . 
   the hardest working teachers i know are in low-decile schools and they choose to teach in them because they feel they can make the most difference there . 
  i do n't think there 's any evidence that teachers ` work harder ' at higher or lower decile schools . 
   but regardless of that , even if your other points were true that would still in fact justify higher spending on the students in those schools . 
  the extra funding could pay for programmes to provide smaller class sizes and teacher aides so the teachers do n't have to waste as much time on the kids who do n't want to learn and disrupt the class . 
  all pupils at all schools deserve lower class sizes . 
   even by your own reasoning the student who wants to learn is being disadvantaged by being in a class with students who cause more trouble and therefore that student deserves extra government help to level the playing field a bit and not punish him for the bad luck to be born in a low-income area . 
  again , i 'm not saying that it 's a bad idea to do that . 
  i 'm saying that the measures they 're claiming to use are fucking stupid . 
  they should measure the * actual problem * and then fix * actual problem * . 
  not measure ` risk factors ' . 
  just measure the actual issues . 
  i do n't care . 
  again , there is no reason at all why it should be expensive to live in apartment in the middle of a city . 
   you argued the schools in poor areas were bad schools at least in part due to having useless teachers . 
  i am pointing out the research says schools in poor area have poor results because their students are growing up in poverty . 
  if you put the same school facilities and teachers in a wealthy area , they 'd get much better results . 
  no you did n't . 
  you said that if you ignore socioeconomic situation then pupils at lower decile schools do just as well as those at higher decile schools . 
  but that really , simply , does not mean anything . 
   which is why schools with more difficult students need more funding than those with only a handful . 
  not really . 
  it means that we have a societal problem that needs a societal solution . 
   of course they do and i know because i teach at a mid-decile school . 
  my friends at high-deciles have to constantly deal with parents who want to be involved in every step of their children 's lives . 
  i rarely if ever get an e-mail from a parent . 
  my friends in low-decile schools deal with things i ca n't even imagine . 
  they put their whole lives into their jobs . 
  fucking ' i know that this is a fact because as a teacher ' ... you are awful . 
  no , they do not . 
  most new zealanders have no interest in living in an apartment in the middle of a city . 
  they want to live in a suburb and have a back garden and for their kids to go to the local school . 
  snapcaster mage is still far better . 
  snapcaster mage blanks removal , because he always gets you a real card . 
  the same can not be said for jvp .
