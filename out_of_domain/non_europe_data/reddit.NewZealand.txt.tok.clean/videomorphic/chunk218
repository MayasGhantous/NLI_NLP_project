  they do n't suck to play * anymore * . 
  for balance actually, 
  `` fixed '' by being shit and unplayable ? 
  how about no ? 
  everyone knew mono-red would be huge going into the pt . 
  everyone prepared for it . 
  and yet it still won 6/8 top 8 . 
   eventually though , your opponent is going to stabilise and put out a board you ca n't fight through . 
  most agro decks usually loose at this point, 
  no they do n't . 
  every mono-red aggro deck in history has had reach . 
  if you 're going to post this you should at least update it for 2017 . 
  ( hint : you do that by removing most of the decks ), 
  ** given the supply ** , which is artificially restricted . 
  if the supply were n't artificially restricted , then it would be much more reasonable to be there . 
  nobody plays [ [ karma ] ] in legacy bro . 
  some people are ops . 
  so it is clearly not the case that ` everyone is not ops ' . 
  do you mean ` not everyone is ops ' ? 
  the ` everyone is ops ' viewpoint is promoted by people that do n't want to train and employ proper ops . 
  having a lot of children is not irrational when you have more than enough money to support them . 
  well john key has spent the last third of this term sitting on his arse doing nothing prime ministerial . 
  nobody is compelled to ` serve a term ' as prime minister . 
  if she wants to be prime minister for 2 years then have kids , power to her .

  these are the same cunts that have been going around harassing companies into forcing more women onto their boards than have applied . 
  is it in fact illegal ? 
  i was under the impression that it was n't illegal , but discrimination was illegal , and it 's just an extremely bad idea because it makes it very difficult to prove you were n't being discriminatory . 
  he 's a fucking cricketer you moron . 
   so the fact i have a decade of experience in the system on a day to day basis is irrelevant ? 
  but you 're an expert because you once went to a school ? 
  because everyone seems to feel that way , that they can comment on anything education related because they attended school . 
  i do n't presume to tell the chef about their job because i 've eaten in restaurants before . 
  i know lots and lots of teachers . 
  lots of family friends and family members . 
  and they 're insufferable . 
  they think they know everything . 
   no i am saying the socioeconomic level of the students is the thing that makes the difference . 
  the teachers and quality of the schools is the same . 
  that is why schools with poorer students need extra funding . 
  your justification for saying that was idiotic . 
   do you also oppose progressive taxation where we take more money from the wealthy and give it to the poor ? 
  because if you are opposed to that too , there 's really no point in further discussion . 
  can i get the mods to get me a flair that says ` socialist ' so that stupid people stop asking stupid questions ? 
   education is the ultimate societal solution . 
  education is one of the best ways to break the poverty cycle . 
  it is n't a silver bullet and other policies are needed but providing a good education to the whole populace is of vital importance . 
  and that means providing equity rather than equality . 
  the only actual way to break the poverty cycle is getting people into work , and creating jobs for them to work in if that 's necessary to get them into work . 
  what a ridiculous thing to say . 
  do you think susan devoy knows everything about the law of racial discrimination ? 
  given that susan devoy clearly does n't know how to do the job , why would you assume that anyone else would magically acquire this ability after doing it for a while ? 
  no , nobody at all is playing it anywhere . 
  i do n't oppose funding education or finding special educational needs . 
  listen for five fucking seconds jesus christ . 
  i oppose funding schools based on irrelevant ` risk factors ' when we can fund them directly for the special needs they have . 
  the problem is that it is plainfaced spin . 
  it presents the views of the government as fact . 
  it 's not ` editorialising ' to post a link to an article with a question in the title . 
  it 's not ` editorialising ' to post a link to an article with a question in the title . 
  it 's not ` editorialising ' to post a link to an article with a question in the title . 
  the danger for labour is that the media will keep repeating everything national says uncritically . 
  it is unreasonable . 
  it 's unreasonable for soes to exist and it 's unreasonable to suggest that they are required by law to maximise profits and ignore other costs . 
  the mods here have always been morons . 
  anything run by an soe should be run by a government department not as a busines, 
  i do n't need a rebuttal . 
  they 're wrong . 
  they 're claiming something with no evidence to support their claim . 
   basic economics is taught that when borrowing money you should be making short term losses ( paying back the debt ) for long term gain ( increased equity or capital gains ) , currently you borrow money , have profits starting from day one and still get the long term capital gain . 
  if you ignore the capital gains , you make ** way ** less in profit than you would make putting the same money somewhere else , even taking into account that you ca n't leverage your money as well elsewhere . 
  never heard of the ` fletcher building monopoly ' before . 
  source ? 
  they 've said before that they want to tackle urban sprawl , i believe . 
  they have an immigration policy . 
  if they tackle the absurd house price rises , long-term vacant houses will become a cost to those that own them . 
  if students are n't motivated to learn then that 's a problem with the course , not with the students . 
  it 's not * that * skilled . 
  it 's not like you have to be a genius or that it 's something only a small portion of people could learn . 
  yes you have to be trained , but anyone * could * train to become a builder . 
   where 's all the land for the houses going to come from ? 
  that 's an extra cost right there and more importantly where most homeless are and want to stay is rather expensive ( auckland welly ), 
  bulldoze some shopping mall carparks and replace them with high density urban centres that do n't require public transport . 
  if there are local businesses and a supermarket right beside an urban centre you do n't need lots of transport . 
   we have a builder shortage as it is , let alone adding another 33000 jobs for them and if you import them where they going to live ? 
  ( its a housing shortage ), 
  we should be training people to be builders . 
  anyone that is on the ` jobseekers benefit ' that is physically capable of training to be a builder should be required to train to be a builder , required to pass their course , and required to go and be a builder . 
  we should also be importing builders to work , with no path to residency . 
  these should only be imported for the purpose of training and temporary work . 
   surplus ' are used to pay our previous debts , interest and user to replenish funds like the rather empty national disaster fund which as a wellingtonian i 'm pleased to hear after the recent earthquakes, 
  we do n't need to ` pay down debt ' , and the ` balanced budget ' nonsense is just economically illiterate rubbish . 
  this is the us . 
  go away . 
   you do n't need to build a house for each homeless person . 
  that 's not practical .
