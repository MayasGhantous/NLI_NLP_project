  healing mechanics , damaging mechanics , defensive mechanics ? 
  sure . 
  but the healer , damager and tank roles ? 
  eugh , no , definitely not . 
  that 's stale . 
  i think it definitely does touch the core of what an mmorpg is . 
  it 's the last three letters instead . 
  rpg . 
  to be , rpgs are about directing a character . 
  my character has strength , and agility , and other attributes and skills . 
  my character dodges things . 
  i direct my character , i decide the tactics and the strategy . 
  but my character is the one that has to dodge and aim . 
  dodging shiny projectiles and getting out of red zones are prevalent in action combat games as well , i 'm afraid . 
   because `` action '' and `` tab-target '' is not mutually exclusive, 
  they also are n't inclusive . 
  not only are there games and systems that are arguably both , there are games and systems that are definitely neither . 
  by that ( terrible ) logic , call of duty is an rpg because it 's a game where you play a role , the role of a soldier . 
  and so is counterstrike , also an rpg . 
  and so is basically every single game ever . 
   what does that have to do with anything ? 
  i said quite clearly in this thread that i was only talking about games that came out after or at the same time as wow . 
   and even if you just want to count after wow being launched ( i have no idea why you should only do that though ), 
  i think it 's quite clear : wow changed the genre fundamentally , and there 's a clear divide between pre-wow games and post-wow games . 
  they have different trends and different ideas and different goals . 
  before wow nobody even aspired to a million players . 
  after wow many developers expected at least a million if not more , until they all failed and people gave up hope . 
   there are examples , of course not the aaa ones though , it is in their nature to lose players after the initial launch with a few exceptions . 
  that 's my point . 
  every mmo that has launched after wow has gone like this :, 
  or worse, 
   arbitrary . 
  all rpgs end , roguelikes have permadeath , there is examples like path of exile or diablo . 
  all genre definitions are ` arbitrary ' in the sense that they could be anything . 
  but they are n't anything . 
  they are what they are . 
  a game that like most mmorpgs but with a world that resets every month is n't an mmorpg , but that does n't make it a bad game . 
   you get gold and xp by killing mobs and players and increase your levels and get better gear . 
  that 's exactly 90 % of the content of most mmos . 
  its just a more compact form . 
  it 's not the same at all . 
  they 're similar on a surface level and completely and totally different on every other level . 
   roguelikes are a subset of rpgs . 
  the root of rpgs are tabletop gaming and that has permadeath . 
  roguelikes are n't rpgs . 
  nobody that knows anything about roguelikes , nobody that makes roguelikes , nobody that is in the roguelike community , calls them rpgs . 
  tabletop gaming does not have permadeath . 
  tabletop gaming tends to have plentiful access to resurrection magic past the very early stages of campaigns , and most dms pull their punches pretty hard and fudge dice to avoid player death . 
   it has a lot of things in common with rpgs actually . 
  what it does n't have is things in common with `` adventure games '' which is what people consider `` rpgs '' nowadays . 
  i know what an rpg is . 
  rpgs have narrative stories . 
  rpgs have developer-made worlds . 
  roguelikes have permadeath , they 're intended to be replayed over and over , they have procedurally generated worlds and they do n't have narrative stories . 
  they 're completely different from rpgs . 
  stop acting like everything with levels and items and set in a fantasy world is an rpg . 
   the real issue was green dragons and above , almost every single one of these are in wilderness . 
  so to hunt them , you must have a clan to help you out . 
  also , it 's usually on a 2minute timer . 
  so what tends to happen is you get shift camping ; some fight , some guard , and 1 or 2 dude running back to bank . 
  no shit . 
  that 's not a problem . 
  that 's called player interaction . 
  that 's what made the game good . 
  there are lots and lots of different things to do in runescape . 
  a few of them are only available in the wilderness , and because that 's higher risk it carries higher reward . 
  that 's kind of the point . 
  you 're meant to compete with others for access to green dragons . 
   infact , greater demons and other important mobs with good drops are usually exclusively found in wilderness back then . 
  it 's to artificially create difficulty for grind . 
  there 's nothing even remotely ` artificial ' about it . 
  it 's not artificial difficulty . 
  it 's entirely player-driven difficulty . 
  they 're never called mobs in runescape btw . 
  they 're monsters that drop things that players want . 
  players go to those monsters . 
  players compete with other players for those monsters . 
  artificial grinds exist in runescape , many of them do . 
  what we are discussing is literally one of the only things in runescape that ** is n't ** an artificial grind . 
  it 's ** entirely ** player-driven . 
   later on , there was alot less focus on mob grinding and more focus on doing stuff to get items , but early runescape was everyone camp a site for a hour to get 2 or 3 kills , or everyone get a clan and camp it out . 
  camp a site for an hour to get 2 or 3 ** dozen ** kills . 
  of course you bring friends , it 's the wildy . 
  they 're in multi . 
  of course you bring friends . 
  it 's an mmo !!, 
   edit : as for supply and demand ; runescape escaped the bane of supply and demand management because of their continuous release of new items for people to wield . 
  however , they never did solve inflation . 
  this became apparent when the bond system got released . 
  you 're talking absolute bullshit . 
  runescape has never had significant inflation . 
  runescape is the only sandbox game in the history of mmorpgs not to have significant inflation . 
  runescape 's price indices are all basically flat in the long term . 
  many old items are much cheaper now than they were a few years ago . 
  osrs ( the version everyone plays ) does n't release new items that obsolete old items at all , now , essentially . 
  green dragonhide is just as useful as it has always been . 
  coal is just as useful as it has always been . 
  runescape has good gold sinks and good game design and it does n't suffer from inflation like uo did . 
   do you know what would happen if you outright banned / r/gaming tomorrow ? 
  the other subs would be flooded with content for a couple of days , it would get moderated pretty quickly , and they 'd soon go back to normal .
