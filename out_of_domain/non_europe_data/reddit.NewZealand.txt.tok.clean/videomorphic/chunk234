  there are a lot of very stupid people in nz that have been americanised . 
  no it is n't . 
  neither are acceptable in britain or nz . 
  very accurate or very inaccurate . 
  that 's enough people to be accurate ** if the sampling is unbiased ** . 
  the sampling in our polls is very unlikely to be unbiased though, 
  sorry i meant ` it is acceptable in neither britain nor nz ' . 
  brainfart . 
   - ize is n't american spelling , though , it is oxford spelling . 
  there is no such thing as ` oxford spelling ' . 
  the oxford english dictionary is outdated prescriptivist rubbish that thinks etymology is more important than describing how people actually use language . 
  cannabis laws have nothing to do with how fast our parliament moves . 
   in 2000 all dairy farms in nz used a combined total of a billion litres of water . 
  bear in mind cattle takes more water than produce does each year, 
  frankly that 's insane , and it 's a good reason to introduce these charges : it might encourage the cunts to stop wasting so much water . 
  it 's not a levy . 
  it 's charging him for a resource he 's using . 
  if you ca n't afford to run a business without paying costs , your business should n't exist . 
   jokes on you , i was only pretending to be retarded, 
  there is nothing wrong with concessions . 
  what is wrong is * concessions in exchange for something * . 
  and like it or not , that 's what these are . 
  they are collusion and they are cheating . 
  saying ` do you want to prize split ? ', 
  with the implicit request for either player to concede is cheating . 
  it 's against the rules . 
  if you ask a judge to help you ` say it right ' , you are asking for their help on how to cheat . 
  nobody is asking for conceding to be banned * in general * . 
  what should be banned is basing any match result , whether it 's a concession or a draw or anything else , on getting some reward . 
  that 's the problem . 
  it happens all the time , and it 's cheating . 
   it 's actually extremely rare where anybody has the opportunity to concede to someone else to make the top 8 ( it happened only a few times all season ), 
  but a top 8 is a * big deal * . 
  if it happens once , it is a * big deal * . 
  if an x-round tournament has a pro point as a reward , then you should get the reward for winning x rounds , not ( x-1 ) rounds . 
  so in other words , you want your opponent to concede to you so that you get more money . 
  resting good players when playing against weak players is not ` an effective concession ' , because * they still win against the weak players * . 
   watch sports, 
  i do n't watch american sports . 
  no real sports do this . 
  if american sports teams do this and get away with it , that just is yet another reason american sports suck . 
   as a thanks, 
  you mean ` as a bribe to the person they ask for a concession in the next tournament ' . 
   on your last point -- i think world-building is the strongest element of magic storytelling , but i also think storytelling in general is the weakest part of magic as a game . 
  for me , magic 's real strength is its rule set . 
  i feel like there was nowhere in the survey for this opinion to be shared . 
  magic 's worldbuilding is incredibly weak . 
  magic is much more fun creatively when decks tend to be 2 colours or spmetimes 3 colours , than when decks tend to be 3 colours or sometimes 4 . 
  the way to fix that is to ban drs , not fetchlands . 
  tnn is fine for the format and drs is not . 
  i absolutely hate deathrite shaman to the point where i no longer find legacy fun to play or fun to watch . 
  drs absolutely is warping the format around it . 
  ad nauseam tendrils is the most powerful deck in the format by an insane margin . 
  in a metagame of people at maximal skill level , who always make the mathematically correct play every time , it 's the best deck by a huge margin imo . 
  the idea that ant is bad to be playing now is just ridiculous . 
  bad players that took all the useful green cards out of their sideboards and now ca n't beat any hate might be doing poorly , but the deck is still extremely good . 
  it 's really the best deck in the format . 
  not the most popular , but i think undeniably the best . 
   when it comes down to it , snapcaster is never the wrong card to take when you thoughtseize your opponent and see one . 
  i do n't see how that 's relevant . 
  that particular interaction demands it . 
  otherwise they 'll just snapcaster back the card you make them discard . 
   and the format is otherwise largely devoid of mana hosers, 
  no it really , really is n't . 
  there are loads of cards that fight greedy mana bases in legacy . 
  why would anyone not know these cards are ` still in standard ' ? 
  the whole fucking problem with this awful government is that everything has to have a ` business case ' . 
  guess what ? 
  the government should n't be run like a business . 
  what ? 
  auckland is a city that generates real economic activity and houses over a million people . 
  i meant * in modern * , obviously . 
  there are more than enough cards to fight greedy mana bases in modern . 
  there are more than enough cards to fight greedy mana bases in modern . 
  i meant in modern , obviously . 
  you are a moron . 
  i did n't ` arbitrarily decide ' . 
  it 's what they 've always been called by a lot of people . 
  the reason for that usage is us being culturally close to britain . 
   that 's largely due to the average gamer is like 30 years old and has a full time job and likely a family at that and ca n't spend hours on an mmo like they use to . 
  as such mmo 's where basically forced to make their mmo 's cater to shorter play times . 
  god stop writing this stupid shit . 
  it 's everywhere on reddit . 
  the idea that gamers ` have got older ' totally lacks understanding of demographics . 
  you know that kids play mmorpgs right ? 
  $ 15/month is fucking nothing . 
  if you ca n't afford that then you are n't a useful customer . 
   $ 15 is not a lot, 
  it 's the equivalent of $ 10 when wow came out . 
  the price has n't gone up , but inflation has . 
  if you ca n't pay $ 15/month then you are n't worth making a game for . 
  did you just fail to understand an analogy ? 
   cosmetic cash shop, 
  bdo has been pay to win for literally the entire time it has existed . 
  mmorpgs by definition require open worlds . 
   massive multiplayer, 
  ** massively ** multiplayer . 
  massively is an adverb . 
  it modifies ` multiplayer ' , which is an adjective . 
  i know that some people these days struggle with adverbs and like to say things like ` that was real good ' and ` i 'm real hungry ' but this is pretty basic stuff .
