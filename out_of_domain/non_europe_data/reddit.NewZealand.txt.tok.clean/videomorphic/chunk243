  that 's utterly untrue . 
  it 's completely safe . 
   every format it has been legal in it has been a top tier card and the same would be true for modern . 
  good . 
  top tier cards are good . 
  good . 
  it 's awful compared to what you can do in legacy these days . 
  it 'll just get dazed over and over again . 
  lmao , sorry , but delver would absolutely not play necro . 
  a bbb card is just uncastable in delver . 
  and necro is far from a ` guaranteed win ' . 
  this but not sarcastically . 
   blue having the best threat in the format is kind of dumb, 
  no it is n't , and that 's not how cards are banned . 
  have you ever actually looked at a banned and restricted announcement ? 
  wotc bans cards if and only if they are in an overpowered deck and they are the best way of hitting that deck and preferably only that deck , while also ensuring they do n't have to come back in 3 months and do it again . 
  tnn does not fit that categorisation at all . 
  less dumb than most of the people on / r/modernmagic though, 
  drs is n't good because it 's a fucking 1/2 , it 's good because it invalidates wasteland decks . 
  that 's why it should be banned . 
  if drs were ` powerful to be doing against graveyard-based combo ' then graveyard combo decks would n't get better every single time drs becomes popular . 
  they do that because people stupidly and incorrectly think that drs is good against graveyard decks , but it is n't , and they sacrifice proper graveyard hate because of it . 
  modern has had more removal in the past lol, 
  nah it 's bad . 
  delver is good because you can play it in a mana denial strategy . 
  this makes wasteland/daze/stifle pretty bad . 
  and if you want to stifle your big creature 's etb trigger well there 's a 12/12 i can introduce you to . 
  lots of people still play shardless . 
  the mtgo metagame as shown by 5 random non-overlapping decks from leagues is not a representation of the actual legacy meta . 
  it is though, 
  he 's completely wrong . 
  they 've done that many times . 
  shops is only good right now because of mentor . 
  do n't be ridiculous . 
  valakut is n't even remotely close to being overpowered . 
  those cards are n't problematic at all . 
  valakut should n't be legendary because it is n't legendary . 
   the wraith i do n't understand , i mean , yes it is perfect for a turbo xerox style deck that aims to reduce life, 
  it 's not a ` turbo xerox ' deck . 
  stop repeating terms you do n't understand . 
  this meta is absolutely awful, 
  they are n't going to print good equipment . 
  workshops is a pillar of the format . 
  restricting it would make vintage not vintage , like banning brainstorm in legacy or tarmogoyf in modern . 
   there 's virtually no other deck in vintage that would become obsolete with a single ban or restriction . 
  exception being like `` well yeah doomsdat needs doomsday , oath needs oath of druids . '', 
  but in those cases nobody is arguing that oath or doomsday as strict cards are too powerful . 
  lots of people have argued that both doomsday and oath are powerful cards , actually . 
  and add to that , tendrils of agony , doomsday , oath of druids , mentor , bazaar of baghdad , workshops ... lots of cards kill decks if they 're restricted . 
  yes banning it indeed was a terrible idfea, 
  well you can * un * release a library and cause an ecological catastrophe ... 
  * cough * leftpad * cough *, 
   restrict , not ban . 
  and ? 
  does n't kill the deck any less . 
   big difference , because brainstorm is restricted in vintage . 
  and has never been a pillar . 
  notice how dark ritual , mana drain , bazaar of baghdad , workshops and null rod are n't restricted ? 
  they 'll never be restricted . 
  that goes against what vintage is about . 
   as are most absurdly powerful cards . 
  except , as has been pointed out a million times , any of the other pillars of the format . 
   workshop is by miles the most powerful card that is not restricted in vintage . 
  bazaar of baghdad is more powerful than workshops by a country mile . 
  shops is only good because vintage is an inbred deck for an inbred meta . 
  dredge would beat basically any deck in any other format in 95/100 games . 
  lol coalition victory is incredibly silly and casual . 
  it 's the quintessential example of a card that nobody would ever play outside of edh , which would never be overpowered in edh , and is hilarious if you somehow manage to make it work !, 
  no , you are wrong . 
  it 's intuitive that a spell fizzles without its targets . 
  that 's how it works in every other game . 
  it 's how it works in every video game where targets can fizzle . 
  it 's how it works in every other card game . 
  hitting mentor and not shops would not have made shops too good . 
  shops is only good because of mentor existing . 
  jace is n't good in legacy . 
  it 's a mildly good finisher in a couple of decks . 
  no it is n't . 
  the meta is ** horrible ** . 
   and even if you do n't believe that , i do n't see how you can think it 's worse than any meta since the twin banning , or maybe even since the pod banning . 
  why does that matter ? 
  it 's horrible compared to before pod was banned . 
  that 's all that matters . 
  how good a bunch of terrible metas are compared to each other is irrelevant . 
  drs is n't good against graveyard decks . 
  it 's better than a lot of other cards in your deck , but it 's not actually ** good ** . 
  it 's not graveyard hate . 
  the data speaks for itself . 
  every time drs becomes popular and stupid people start cutting graveyard hate ` because drs ' , graveyard decks become really good again . 
  no , claims that it 's insanely powerful suggest that you have n't played with it . 
  jace is a good card . 
  in some board states it basically just wins the game . 
  sure . 
  nobody is disputing that . 
  but it 's extremely easy for it to just do nothing . 
  and that 's even more common in modern where turn 4 is the fundamental turn and aggressive decks are far more common and powerful than in legacy . 
  in modern , aggressive decks swarm the board with creatures , and jace is awful against that . 
  in legacy , aggressive decks are the tempo decks that run on one creature at a time , and jace is amazing against that . 
  jace and terminus in your deck is great because playing multiple creatures plays into terminus and playing one creature plays into jace . 
  modern 's sweepers are far worse than predict/portent/ponder / brainstorm -  terminus .
