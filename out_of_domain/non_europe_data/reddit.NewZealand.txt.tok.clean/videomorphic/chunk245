  guess what mate , most people that think modern is shitty at the moment are n't here . 
  they 're doing something else . 
  / r/modernmagic has always thought that modern is good * at the present * , in the past , now and long ago . 
  this subreddit always thinks the current meta is great because it consists of people currently playing . 
  this subreddit loved twin when it was legal , and now the twin players have left and the morons that do n't know how to play around twin have returned to the format , so now this subreddit thinks unbanning twin is a meme . 
  maybe in your idiotic country , but in 90 % of western countries what i said is true . 
  it 's true in australia , in new zealand , in south africa , in quebec , and in all of the eu . 
   nobody plays shardless because czech just does it better . 
  that 's just objectively not true . 
  seriously , it just is n't true . 
  shardless is still a fine deck . 
  it 's better against fair decks than czech pile . 
  it 's not as good against combo . 
  that 's the whole point of shardless . 
   why go through the deck building restrictions of shardless when you can just play snaps , strixes , kommands , and jace . 
  because it 's better against fair decks ** and it 's fun ** . 
  people in legacy play what they already own and what is just plain fun . 
  i understand it 's there for emphasis retard, 
  better * than * everyone else, 
   from what i can tell , the lower the mmr is the higher your skill plays into outcome of the match . 
  not true . 
  in fact , the opposite is true . 
  as the skill level increases , small differences in skill become more important . 
   maybe that 's an obvious statement off the concept of mmr , but point is most high mmr people can go on a 30 win streak in low mmrs . 
  that 's not because of low mmr , it 's because of a large * difference * in mmr . 
  in the same way , a low skilled player will easily go on a 30 game loss streak in high mmr . 
  it should of course do all of those things , because it has protection from everything controlled by that player . 
  they do n't do functional errata . 
  no i fucking did n't . 
  bad bot, 
  people that play at fnm are n't noobs that do n't know the rules . 
   beyond that , considering whether to cast a cryptic with only one target and risk it getting fizzled is n't terribly deep strategy . 
  by that standard nothing in magic is ` deep strategy ' . 
  it 's a strategic choice . 
  that 's it . 
   disagree . 
  fatal push , snapcaster , and kommand give czech insane game against blade and dnt strategies . 
  dnt especially is a strategy that shardless struggled with . 
  4 baleful strix gives it a ton of game against delver strategies , combined with it 's 4-5 pieces of 1 mana removal and snapcaster . 
  that 's not how matchups work . 
  shardless has a better winrate against fair decks than czech pile does . 
   i do n't disagree , but your initial claim was `` lots of people play it '' and the results just do n't show that . 
  it has 2 league 5-0s in the last 2 months , and 13 results ( including paper and mtgo ) since the top banning , compare that to czech 's 113 . 
  are you blind or stupid ? 
  i already told you , the mtgo metagame is not representation of the actual magic metagame . 
  it would be a functional errata in reality , whether it 's technically one or not . 
  changing a rule that appears on only one card for the sole purpose of making that card less powerful is functional errata . 
   quebec is n't a country . 
  i did n't say it was . 
  what a stupid thing to bring up . 
   in france there are n't restrictions on the use of the engineer title , and in germany it merely requires have the correct type of degree . 
  beyond eu countries , the uk , like the us , also does n't restrict it . 
  it 's eu law . 
  nope . 
  progenitus has pro everything . 
  your data is irrelevant , i ** already ** pointed out that mtgo data is n't at all relevant . 
  including paper data does n't make it accurate . 
  eliminating mtgo data does . 
  and even then , it 's just big tournaments . 
  99 % of legacy play is in small local tournaments where people just play what they own . 
  they 've never , ever done this . 
  nothing ever ` stays flat or goes up ' . 
  well no , it is n't . 
  it 's based on actually knowing the format and its history . 
  a tier 1 deck does n't just disappear overnight . 
  well there 's a 3-mana sorcery that says ` you win the game ' by that logic . 
   not for your opponents , who probably wanted to actually play some magic . 
  have you ever played commander ? 
  losing to a hilariously terrible and uncompetitive card like this is absolutely hilarious . 
  you win the game on the spot * assuming that nobody has any removal spells * . 
  but they do . 
  obviously . 
  winning on turn 5 assuming that you draw a specific combination of cards is terrible . 
  you can win on turn 1 with doomsday for heaven 's sake . 
  and it is banned for no reason . 
  coalition victory is playable only in five-colour decks . 
  doomsday in any deck with black . 
  that hardly counts . 
  the ban and restricted announcement that was such a stupid clusterfuck that they delayed the next one for months and indicated they made a terrible mistake having the announcements so often and talking like they did ? 
  it is not a meaningful gap . 
  someone 500 mmr above you might be better . 
  they probably are . 
  but there 's no reason to say that means they get to fuck over the rest of the team and tell them what to do . 
  the best way of going about things is to just choose your positions and your heroes amicably with your team , depending on what you are all good at . 
  not do so with the other 4 positions after the retard that got carried by his friends to 3.5 k chooses his own role . 
  the idea that skill is relevant to mmr - winrate is all that is relevant to mmr - is debunked by the fact that arteezy is now 10k . 
  is arteezy genuinely better than he was 2 years ago when he was 7k ? 
  no , of course he is n't . 
  he 's much worse now . 
  in 99 % of dota 's history , having a jungler was retarded . 
  it 's retarded now , it was retarded 2 years ago and every year before that . 
  between the addition of iron talon and 7.00 , junglers were * sort of * viable , but really it was just a fallback position for offlaners that got stomped in lane . 
  unfortunately terrible lol players that have come to dota now seem to want to play jungle in every game . 
  if you ping smoke even 500 mmr scrubs will group up on you . 
  it 's * insane * how powerful that ` group up for  smoke of deceit ' is . 
  it 's a fine deck . 
  it 's not remotely overpowered . 
  if it had all those qualities for real , then it would be the best deck . 
  again , coalition victory is not viable in competitive edh . 
  it can not be .
