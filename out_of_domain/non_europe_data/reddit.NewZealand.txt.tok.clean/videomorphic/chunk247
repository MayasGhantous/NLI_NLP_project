  but it 's clear from the context clues that he 's waiting for the dragons . 
  no , it absolutely is n't clear he 's waiting for the dragons . 
  firstly , he has no idea whatsoever that they exist . 
  secondly , he has no reason to believe they 'll come to him even if he knows they exist . 
  thirdly , there 's no indication whatsoever that he 's waiting for the dragons . 
   in bran 's vision of him from episode 4 , the army was already at the lake . 
  the night king himself was standing on the island in the center . 
  why would n't the dead have moved on in the weeks that followed ? 
  why would they move on ? 
  they have no way to get past the wall . 
  unless your theory is that the night king somehow planned the whole thing . 
  he totally worked out that jon snow would need to convince daenerys ( who he does n't know exists ) to save him from his attempt to capture a wight so that tyrion ( who he does n't know exists ) can convince cersei ( who he does n't know exists ) that he exists and is a threat , and that she would attempt to save him using dragons ( which he does n't know exist ) ? 
  that 's the theory ? 
  that 's his plan ? 
  or maybe he 's there before and he 's there later because that 's where they 're staying . 
  they 're stationary in bran 's vision , after all . 
  they 're standing because they 're zombies , but they 're stationary . 
   why did the night king have three ice-javelins , when we 've never seen any white walker use a weapon like that before ( and we see the night king use a completely different weapon when he kills bloodraven , so it 's not like its his personal choice of weapon ) ? 
  the spears that literally every one of them carries around all the time . 
   why did they have chains at the ready to pull something extremely heavy from the ice ? 
  because , as the writers said , their plan from the start was the dragon being turned into a wight dragon , and they worked backwards from there . 
  something needs to be pulled out of the lake ? 
  well here 's some chains for you to use . 
   none of this is explicitly said at any point in the episode , and yet its clear that the night king got exactly what he wanted out of the raiding party 's expedition . 
  he got incredibly lucky to get writers as bad as d&d . 
   someone did a very long travel ? 
  sounds an indication between two scenes of significant time passing . 
  there are scenes on either side of this supposedly long travel that * clearly take place near each other temporally * . 
  it might make sense to say ` well there was clearly travel between these two scenes ' , but firstly you 're meant to cut differently when you do this ( the ` ad break cut ' where the screen goes dark for a split second instead of a straight cut ) * and * it does n't make much sense for the scenes to go [ a ] [ b ] [ c ] [ d ] where a and d clearly happen roughly at the same time and there 's travel required between a&b , b&c or c&d , yet that happened heaps . 
  this series had * noticeably * faster pacing , and i appreciated it while watching . 
  it made me suspend my disbelief a bit more , but it definitely strained my disbelief , but i can see why they did it . 
  but they clearly ignored travel times a lot . 
  and ? 
  that does n't make it confirmed until it was in fact confirmed . 
  maybe . 
  strong chance they wo n't . 
  imo season 6 was far far worse . 
   you have no proof the night king did n't know the dragons exist . 
  yes we do : we 're never given any indication that he does . 
   if he can see bran when he 's greenseeing , he can blatantly see/know more . 
  because time has n't actually passed , given that they 're still standing on the rock in exactly the same positions . 
   another example , last time we saw benjen , he was north of the wall saving a stark , and in that scene benjen is again north of the wall saving starks , makes perfect sense and wraps up his story arc . 
  no it does n't . 
  it 's deus ex machina . 
  i think they 're important . 
  i just think that the books have n't really suggested that they will be the primary characters yet . 
  the books are very open at this stage . 
  no it did n't . 
  there is no such thing as ` jacindamania ' . 
  it 's not that she 's lifted labour above its natural position . 
  this is labour 's natural level of support . 
  people like labour 's policies and always have . 
  when you survey people , they support more healthcare , more education , etc. 
  the leadership * was * terrible . 
  that was all . 
  that will be the actual reason . 
  just like the actual reason we survived the gfc well was labour . 
  i see no value in alternate views that are simply wrong . 
   maybe i 'm just turning into a grumpy old sod but i 'm back to party vote national after planning on a top vote . 
  i 'm traditionally a national supporter but think they 've gotten a bit too headstrong and cocky . 
  maybe a few years in opposition will tighten up their policies . 
  if you want them to go into opposition to ` harden up ' or whatever then maybe you should n't vote for them . 
   that being said ... 
  i 'm really no fan of `` jacidamania '' . 
  which makes me a bit of a pariah around here . 
  reading all the stats on who frequently posts to / r/nz revealed that most of the people here are overwhelmingly in the under 25/low-earner/student category which typically leans heavily labour and green . 
  why are these sentences in the same paragraph ? 
  what does labour 's popularity among the general public have to do with the demographics of / r/newzealand ? 
  also , maybe there 's a reason that labour is more well-supported amongst the highly educated mate . 
   i feel like electing labour will end up being a bit of a bitter pill that will show new zealand once again why their policies do n't work . 
  their policies have , in historical context , always worked better than national 's . 
  literally every time that labour goes into government , life is better for the poor , government services improve , and the government ends up in surplus . 
  literally every time that national goes into government , life is worse for the poor , government services worsen , and the government takes on a lot more debt . 
   you ca n't suddenly raise the minimum wage, 
  labour 's policy is n't to ` suddenly raise the minimum wage ' . 
  labour 's policy is to continue to raise the minimum wage incrementally , just like national has been done , but at a faster rate . 
  anyone claiming that this will negatively affect the economy is a scaremonger . 
  there is zero evidence whatsoever that it negatively affects the economy to do this . 
   choke off immigration, 
  lowering immigration back to where it was only a few years ago is n't going to damage our economy . 
  the opposite in fact . 
  what , do you think that nz 's economy was terrible for all of history until like 5 years ago or something ? 
   crash housing prices, 
  labour 's policy is not to ` crash housing prices ' , it is to lower the * rate of growth of housing prices * . 
  labour wants to increase housing supply . 
  that 's a fucking good thing for people that actually want to live in their own fucking home . 
  maybe stop thinking about your own stupid investments and think about others for a change you self-centred shit . 
   spend like crazy, 
  given that national has spent nearly the entire last 9 years in deficit spending after 9 years of labour surplus , and labour 's policies are all costed to ensure we are in surplus , you should stop acting like labour wants to ` spend like crazy ' . 
  maybe actually learn something about economics before you spout such rubbish . 
   and not have really dire consequences for the economy . 
  the ** number one ** thing you can do to damage an economy is have a poor working class . 
  when the poor get more money they spend it , which is economic activity . 
  if you want the economy to grow , the poor ** need to have more money ** . 
  wages ** need ** to go up . 
   if labour is elected we 'll see the $ 2 billion surplus we have now evaporate overnight . 
  ah , you see , you 're confused . 
  labour is the party that generates surpluses . 
  you 're thinking of national . 
  national is the party that , every time they are elected , leaves the economy in the shit .
