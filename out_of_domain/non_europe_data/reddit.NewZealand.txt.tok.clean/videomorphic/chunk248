  remember muldoon ? 
  remember bolger ? 
  remember shipley ? 
  remember john key ? 
  every single time national get into power they ruin the government 's books , and every single time labour get into power they leave the government in surplus . 
  every . 
  single . 
  time . 
  labour is indeed going to pay off debt more slowly , because why the hell would you pay off debt that has such a low interest rate quickly ? 
  that debt is extremely valuable . 
  what we actually need to do is to spend money on infrastructure when debt is cheap . 
  that 's how literally every successful entity in the universe spends money . 
  when debt is cheap , borrow heavily and invest in revenue-generating assets . 
  i 'm not overstating this . 
  literally every successful person , government or company does this . 
  every . 
  single . 
  one . 
  it 's basic financial literacy . 
  well yes there is * now * . 
  but a few years ago , before adwd was released , people were constantly claiming it was virtually guaranteed and it just was n't . 
  it does n't add meaning for him to run in and be dead in about 15s . 
  there was no emotional attachment there at all . 
  the whole scene was utterly ridiculous . 
  cersei lannister is absolutely not the ` main antagonist ' . 
  i actually think you 've been watching too much of the show . 
  survived because michael cullen managed the economy well and had our debt down very low despite funding social services well . 
  that 's why we were in a position to borrow lots of money to keep the economy going during the gfc ( even though if we 'd actually still had labour in , we 'd have borrowed more and survived it even better ) without having to pay egregious interest rates . 
   it 's pretty orthodox to spend more and tax less during recessions , and vice versa once out of . 
  tell that to the usa , or the uk , or greece , or spain , or italy , or portugal . 
  most countries practiced pretty severe austerity during the gfc . 
  and it did n't work . 
  i absolutely think it was right to borrow during the gfc , but the point is to borrow * to fund spending * . 
  not to borrow to fund tax cuts for the rich . 
  the rich do n't drive the economy , the poor drive the economy . 
  labour has n't been better ? 
  labour might not have fully automated luxury gay space communism as their policy , but they 're certainly a hell of a lot friendlier to the poor than national . 
  labour did n't underfund public health services . 
  labour did n't underfund education . 
  labour did n't put a profitability metric into every government venture . 
  the previous labour government was the first time since the 80s that the neoliberal consensus was somewhat challenged . 
  not as much as some might like , but compare to the shipley cunt 's benefit-slashing shit and i think most would agree it was far better for those on benefits * and * the working poor . 
  labour had to spend quite a lot of their time in power undoing the regressive policies of the previous national government , and they 'll have to do the same thing if they get in this time . 
  reverting the awful forced profit-driven culture in government will take a lot of work . 
  bringing nz 's labour laws back from the brink will take a lot of work . 
  restoring the confidence of the public service who 've been pushed to insanity by a completely unreasonable expectation that they can do twice as much work on a budget half the size ? 
  that 'll take a decade at least . 
  it 'd be nice if they were treated with respect rather than continually underfunded while being expected to do more with less . 
  the ** myth ** of an ineffective and inefficient civil service is still prevalent in this country . 
  and almost never actually deal with the vast majority of crime that the average person encounters : thefts from homes and thefts of and from vehicles . 
   they have made a lot of inroads with m\u0101ori . 
  not really . 
  they did n't start the treaty negotiations , and not simply stopping them is n't something to give them any credit for . 
   nats undid the foresehore seabead act labour enacted , and came up with a good compromise . 
  that 's a bad thing . 
   the urewera national park is now its own legal person ( like a corporation ) which was also a good compromise between the crown and m\u0101ori - as the park being its own person is consistent with ngai tuhoe who consider the bush an elder/ancestor . 
  it 's nonsensical rubbish that has no place in our society or legal framework . 
  a bush is not a person . 
   ncea achievement went up under the nats, 
  and imagine how much it could have gone up if they did n't waste so much money on national standards ? 
  for that matter , how do we know that is n't just because of labour primary school education changes and the progress of time and aging ? 
   i never bought into the `` rock star economy '' hype but i think its undeniable that the nz economy has done pretty well under national - and although many may not attribute that to their governing , they must have had some part in our success, 
  it 's not undeniable . 
  it 's simply absurd to claim it has done well under national . 
  wage growth has been stagnant , cost of living has increased enormously , house prices are ridiculous , productivity growth is shit . 
  there is no metric that has national doing well . 
   having lived in chch i would say the majority are of cantabs are happy with how they dealt with the quakes, 
  just lol . 
  having lived in christchurch , nobody thinks they did a remotely good job with the earthquakes . 
  it 's taken far too long . 
  there are ** still ** people that have n't actually had their houses repaired for fuck 's sake . 
  and they imported thousands of workers instead of training them ourselves , and now they 're claiming they need to import even more to solve the housing crisis they fucking created . 
  yet if they 'd started training builders immediately those builders would have 7 years work experience already . 
  rubbish . 
  they really could n't have done much worse unless they actively tried to ruin the country . 
  and even then , they actually did actively try to do some things that are just objectively bad ideas , like raising gst . 
   national are a steady hand on the tiller - the last 9 years have seen pretty stable governance trough some very interesting times globally . 
  there 's nothing interesting going on globally at all compared to any previous decade . 
  compare to the 1990s , with the rise of the web , the dotcom boom and bust , the fall of the soviet union and the berlin fucking wall . 
  what happened in the last 10 years ? 
  come on . 
   despite what many people claim , most social problems have n't seen significant change over that time either - more could have been done perhaps but we 're hardly seeing the collapse of nz society . 
  i do n't think anyone is saying we 're seeing the * collapse of nz society * . 
  that happened a long time ago . 
   national has also moved away from it 's xenophobic past and embraced both new immigrants and maori which is a very positive step . 
  national have never had a problem with immigrants . 
  national is pro-immigration for the simple reason that it is anti-labour ( lowercase l ) . 
  national loves immigration because it increases the supply of labour , which lowers the cost of labour , which means that they make more money . 
  that 's all they 're interested in . 
  not being raging anti-maori anti-settlement racists is nothing to be proud of . 
  that 's a standard , basic expectation . 
  it 's not like the usa , where you can say ` well at least the democrats are n't racists like the republicans ' . 
  who are you comparing national with ? 
  if you 're going to say you support national because they are n't racists , who does that make them better than ? 
  even act are n't racist . 
  even the fucking conservatives are n't racist . 
   they 're also much less socially conservative than they were . 
  their leader voted against gay marriage , voted against civil unions , and is extremely socially conservative . 
  like it or not , that influences the party as a whole . 
   i like their focus on free trade,
