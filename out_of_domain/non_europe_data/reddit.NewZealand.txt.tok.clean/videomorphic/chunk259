  i do n't know why you keep insisting it is n't . 
  go look at a dictionary . 
  go read anything written by any expert relating to mathematics in new zealand . 
  literally every mathematician in new zealand calls it ` maths ' , because that 's what it 's fucking called . 
  retard . 
  there 's also just regression to the mean . 
  if you have a massive winning streak , it 's likely a combination of luck and skill . 
  when your luck runs out - and obviously statistically , there 's no reason to ever assume that a `` lucky streak '' will continue - you 'll be overranked and probably drop in mmr . 
  that does n't mean your skill has gone down . 
  just do n't flame your team about it . 
  if you do n't get the runes , oh well . 
  they are useful if you get them , but they 're just a bonus . 
  split it and buy manta/halberd . 
  goods are not cheaper lol . 
  it 's not prescriptivist , idiot . 
  prescriptivist linguistics means * linguists * prescribing what is acceptable . 
  descriptivism does n't mean that correctness does n't exist , you fucking idiot . 
  it means that what is correct is determined by * what speakers consider correct * . 
  ` me dumb dumb boy ' is a clearly * incorrect * sentence . 
  ` their is no way that this sentince is spelled correktly ' . 
  this is n't prescriptivism . 
  prescriptivism is saying ` to incorrectly split infinitives is bad ' . 
  why do you insist on being so rude all the time ? 
  the tone of your posts is consistently awful . 
  why on earth would you want to do that ? 
  if you want to load a resource from a network , you should use gzip compression . 
  that 's more than enough . 
  if n = = 0 & & return 0, 
  this is the sort of hacky rubbish that you have to write in old languages that were n't designed to have nice readable early returns . 
  why on god 's green earth you need this awful shit in a new language is beyond me . 
  what 's wrong with ` if n = = 0 : return 0 ` ? 
  disagreeing with someone that is stupid and wrong is n't the same as being upset . 
   auto downvoting people you are having a discussion with makes you look like a petulant child . 
  i did n't downvote you . 
  i downvoted this comment though , because whining about downvotes is annoying and irrelevant . 
   what difference does it make what he taught ? 
  what kind of question is this ? 
  how does it not make a difference whether he taught english or something more directly related to spying ? 
   why would he lie about teaching english ? 
  what could he gain from that lie ? 
  why would n't he ? 
  do you not see how it looks worse to have lied about teaching people how to break into computer systems vs. teaching people english ? 
  he 's lying to make himself look less like a criminal spy . 
  frankly he should be hanged for espionage . 
  it is , but for a different reason : it 's bad for the independence of the courts and the police to have them housed in the same building . 
  the police and the courts * must * both be independent and * appear * to be independent . 
  blocked, 
  that 'd be a bit difficult , as there is no labor party in new zealand . 
  i hope we get rid of all trade agreements with countries that have a lower minimum wage than ours . 
   english is directly related to intelligence gathering !, 
  what do you think they teach intelligence officers ? 
  it 's a signals intelligence institution , so various things : computer security , techniques to compromise computer systems when you have physical access/network-only access/usb key access/social engineering access , etc. 
   you think he taught them fieldcraft ? 
  i think you have been reading too many james bond novels . 
  human intelligence is n't made up for spy novels . 
  it 's real . 
  human spies exist . 
  remember the israeli spies that were caught in nz ? 
  remember the french spies that destroyed the rainbow warrior ? 
  do you understand how compression works ? 
  where do you get this shit ? 
  the economy is absolutely fucking not 30x the size it was in the 1960s , because :, 
  that ignores that we 've had high levels of immigration since then ,, 
  that ignores * inflation *, 
  literally nobody anywhere has claimed the purpose of the ** royalty ** ( it 's not a tax ) is to magically make pollution go away . 
  it 's a royalty because it makes sense that if you want to take a natural resource that belongs to everyone ( or more realistically , belongs to maori ) and use it for your own commercial purposes , you have to pay the collective people of this nation for it . 
  really it should be much , much higher than it currently is . 
  food is ** massively ** subsidised in new zealand because farmers are n't required to pay for water ( which belongs to everyone ) , are n't required to pay for land ( which belongs to everyone ) and are n't required to pay for cleaning up their pollution . 
  i mean countries with significantly lower minimum wage . 
  indonesia , india , vietnam , china , etc. 
  that 's not how the world works . 
  maybe 50 years ago you could claim we needed to ` trim fat ' . 
  but we 've spend the last fucking 50 years fucking ` trimming fat ' in social services , and it has n't fucking worked because there 's no evidence there 's any fat to fucking trim . 
  medical professionals , for example , work fucking insane hours . 
  they have a tiny amount of money to work with , and as a result they consistently get worse outcomes than they should . 
  that 's because they 're simply underfunded . 
  you can not underfund core services and then hope they 'll just magically become ` more efficient ' and we 'll get the same or better results . 
  that 's not how the world works and it 's not how the world has ever worked . 
  ask anyone that works in any public department : as soon as the nats got in , they started clamouring for ` efficiency ' and as soon as they did , they started cutting budgets , cutting pay rises , cutting everything . 
  and what happens ? 
  work quality goes down , morale goes down , and results go down . 
  and of course they do . 
  no , it does n't have anything to do with where we spend money . 
  * every * department in government is massively underfunded with the possible exception of transport . 
   agreed . 
  one thing i 've always wondered is why , if the return to the ird on each $ 1 spent on audit / recovery is greater than $ 1 , more money is n't applied to this area and hence more $ $ recovered until the marginal return closes in on $ 1 . 
  because the national party represents people that do n't want more work being done in this area . 
  that 's quite obvious . 
   i disagree that business leaders contribute ` so little ' . 
  someone has to lead our big organisations , there is huge responsibility in those top jobs , and it would be almightily difficult to keep quality people if we slashed their pay / taxed the living daylights out of them . 
  that 's just objectively not true . 
  business leaders contribute * fuck all * . 
  no they are n't . 
  house prices are realistic if they fall around 3x * average * incomes . 
  they 'd be okay if the median income was 350k . 
   vice, 
  lol fuck off, 
  credit agencies should be banned internationally . 
  fucking scum , they are . 
   water we do n't use drains away to sea .
