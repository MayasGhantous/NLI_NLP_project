  we should n't support that exploitation . 
  working conditions suck in china . 
  if western countries tariffed them to balance this , then they would quickly raise their minimum wages , so that * they * got that money rather than our government getting it . 
  no , we have significantly lower turnout for local elections because * nobody fucking cares about local elections * . 
  they 're irrelevant in most peoples ' eyes . 
  nobody on a benefit is ` lucky ' to get an absolutely minuscule bit of their fair share of this nation 's wealth . 
  you only need this because of poorly designed apis . 
  in dynamically typed languages , things do n't require that many lines of code to achieve . 
  this is just stupid . 
  nobody likes loosing in a competitive environment . 
  like it or not , dota is a competitive game . 
  you do n't need to enjoy losing to enjoy the game . 
  there are games where i lose and i think ` that was an amazing game ' . 
  and there are games where i lose and i think ` that was a fucking awful game ' . 
  that does n't mean i do n't like dota . 
  your mmr is meaningless if you 've only played 14 ranked matches . 
  it does n't represent your skill , so who cares if it goes down ? 
  you will lose games . 
  you will win games . 
  you will lose games despite playing perfectly . 
  you will win games despite playing terribly . 
  that 's how dota works . 
  it 's a team game . 
  there is no trench . 
  low mmr players are n't qualitatively different from high mmr players , and low mmr games are n't qualitatively different from high mmr games . 
  a gap in mmr represents a gap in mechanical skill , game sense , game knowledge , communication and decision-making . 
  big mmr gap ? 
  big gap in all of them . 
  small mmr gap ? 
  small gap in all of them . 
  but it 's still dota , there are still feeders , still retards , still flamers , still people better than you , still people worse than you . 
  if you consistently play with a team and read about dota ( which you do , from the sound of it ) , you 'll struggle in solo ranked because your party rank is inflated by your communication skills and game knowledge . 
  solo ranked forces you to rely , at least at the lower mmrs , almost entirely on your mechanical skill and decision-making . 
  when i play in a party of friends , i 'm normally the guy that suggests crazily dangerous ideas and then someone else moderates that . 
  when i play low mmr smurf solo ranked , i have to consciously avoid suggesting things like that , because there often is n't someone that will go ` no that 's retarded ! ' . 
  you should just play ranked . 
  if you are better than the people you play with , you 'll get your rank up . 
  you wo n't win every game , but who cares ? 
  you 'll win more than half of them . 
  ** raising mmr is n't the goal ** . 
  having fun is the goal . 
  mmr is a * matchmaking measurement * . 
  mmr is used by the game to give you * balanced games * , which are more likely to be fun . 
  if you 're better than your teammates , it 'll go up , if you just play the game naturally and normally . 
  having low mmr does n't make you a failure , and your mmr going down is n't failure . 
  it 's necessary to ensure that you do n't get placed against people that are way better than you are on average . 
  ** oh yeah , you can recalibrate when the next battle pass comes out . 
  10 calibration games , another 30 ranked games , then you can swap it with your ranked mmr . 
  i do n't enjoy losses . 
  yet i enjoy dota , because i enjoy winning more than i do n't enjoy losing . 
  did you even read my entire comment ? 
  i 've had to do * way * more documentation reading to write a java android app than i have ever needed to do to write a clojure web service . 
   aoe gold and xp were nerfed in recent years, 
  aoe gold and xp are way bigger than they were during ti1 and ti2 . 
  passive gold gain is much higher . 
  starting items are cheaper . 
  people are better . 
  more creeps in lanes . 
  * massive * power creep on cores, 
  yeah it does, 
  yes it does . 
  honestly 54 % on a hero you play a lot of is pretty bad . 
  you should really have 60 + % winrate on your most played heroes . 
  they 've repeatedly nerfed illusion heroes , over and over again , and now they 're basically all either bad or reworked into ` fighting heroes ' like the new pl and tb . 
   a roamer is one of the 5 positions as the name suggests most of your gold/exp comes from getting kills during ganks while you roam, 
  the five positions are three cores ( one for each lane ) , and two supports . 
  that 's the only meta in dota . 
   phase , midas , blink , radiance, 
  shitty meme build . 
  midas is a bad early-game item . 
  you want to get a quick mana boots into blink , not wasting your power spike on running into the jungle to midas creeps and having a 2150g item that * does n't do anything * . 
  you should go arcane boots -  blink -  auras ( drums/vlads/pipe ), 
  lina is a viable support hero , btw, 
   roamer :, 
  nope . 
  position 4 does n't mean ` roamer ' . 
  trilaning and dual laning are completely viable and widely used strategies . 
  what is your mmr now ? 
  ** labour arent going to raise taxes **, 
  that 's them trying to work around js 's terrible type system . 
  . . which has nothing to do with it . 
   just cancel legislated tax cuts, 
  which is not the same as raising taxes . 
  national is campaigning on lowering taxes . 
  labour is campaigning on not lowering taxes . 
  that 's all there is to it . 
   and add new taxes to food production . 
  no , they are not doing this . 
  the water royalty has been shown again and again to have ** absolutely zero impact ** on food prices . 
   i disagree with almost all of you politically at this stage of my life, 
  then you are a self-centred , uncaring , greedy cunt . 
  this is n't the sort of election where both sides have a valid viewpoint . 
  the viewpoint that national is espousing - and they are * the only viable and relevant alternative to labour * , so if you do n't support labour , then you are supporting national - is simply wrong morally , ethically , and frankly it 's wrong legally too . 
  national is corrupt , uncaring , and completely without ethical and moral standards . 
  i do n't care whether you think that this is ` reasonable ' . 
  you are part of the problem . 
  i ca n't wait for your generation to die off . 
  nowhere have they promised to ` solve every problem the country has ' . 
  frankly any person that shows loyalty to china should be deported , whether they 've been here a day or their lifetime . 
  new zealand has absolutely no reason to value china economically .
