   making sure that chinese nzers can have access to information and news in the chinese language from independent sources , rather than letting chinese state media continue to encroach in that small vulnerable market should be the no . 
  1 concern . 
  no , it should n't . 
  eliminating immigration from china is the number one concern . 
   however , going back to the top , my discomfort is in the rhetoric surrounding this particular issue . 
  kiwi asians get tarred with the brush of ` insidious chinese ' . 
  even when the us does similar stuff , i doubt you 'd see redditors questioning the loyalty of ` certain groups ', 
  because they factually are insidious . 
  we do n't need to bow to china . 
  we can tell china to fuck right off if we want to . 
  they have no power over us . 
  it 's got nothing to do with ethnicity . 
  it 's still cheap arable land . 
  you are ignorant . 
  lots of people use wasd screen movement , including many very high ( 7k + ) mmr players . 
  it 's not ` other peoples ' money ' . 
  it 's everyone 's money . 
  the 6.82 change was an ** insane ** buff , and everything since then has been a small nerf . 
  it 's a minuscule amount of money . 
  no , i 'm not . 
  no , it was n't , because it was a fundamentally different shape . 
  china is a country , not a race . 
  national are incredibly right-wing on an international scale . 
  your post is incoherent . 
  learn grammar . 
  social policy is irrelevant . 
  no , it 's not possible to have a set of morals that fit their policies . 
  enriching themselves and others that are already rich at the expense of public services ( especially health ) is blatantly immoral . 
   older vesions of dota followed the wc3 design where autoattacks scale in a number of ways but spells mostly do n't , and ability cooldowns are generally high . 
  yes , that 's called ` game design ' . 
   now , whether you happen to like the game this way or not , it is simply bad game design for a 5v5 game to make it essentially fv vs spec for president with everyone else slowly devolving into spectator/free food status as the game progresses . 
  no , it is n't . 
   the patchnotes over time are a clear indication that osfrog eventually realized this as well . 
  no , they 're a clear indication that icefrog is no longer in charge of balancing for dota . 
  unfortunately it did , yeah . 
  i do n't care about convincing him . 
  no , it is n't . 
  china is not a race . 
  china does n't care about income from land . 
  it cares about food security . 
  i do n't mean the national party mp . 
  i mean ** any chinese person in new zealand that has any loyalty to china ** . 
  i do n't care about having useful discourse . 
  i do n't care about convincing him . 
  i care about him knowing that he is vile . 
  and that should be reversed . 
  i do not play against veno , earthshaker and necro every single game in fact . 
  they might * say that publicly * , but it 's objectively and demonstrably false . 
  their set of policies are bad for new zealand in the short term , the medium term , and the long term . 
  that 's objective fact . 
  they are right-wing on an international scale . 
  new zealand is a very right-wing country on an international scale . 
  look at any western european country . 
  they 're all much , much , much more left-wing than us , which is the entire reason they 're so successful and we are n't . 
  literally every national voter is either :, 
  ignorant and stupid enough to believe their smear tactics , or, 
  self-centred , uncaring cunts, 
  why would i want to convince him ? 
  he 's clearly already convinced . 
  i did n't say ` chinese is not a race ' . 
  i said ` china is not a race ' . 
  china is a country . 
  this thread is about china . 
  everywhere in it , the discussion is about china , china 's spies , china 's influence activities , china 's this , china 's that . 
  it 's about the * regime * , not the * ethnicity * . 
  the british , australians and americans are more right-wing than us , sure . 
  the english-speaking world is very right-wing , and new zealand is part of that . 
  i was n't comparing to those countries . 
  that 's why i said ` on an international scale ' , because i am comparing to the world as a whole . 
  look at an eu country ( not uk ) . 
  they 're the most successful countries in the world , because they are n't the right-wing shitholes that the anglophone countries are . 
  new zealand is extremely right-wing . 
  our left-leaning parties do n't even want to fucking raise taxes in one of the least-taxed countries in the western world !, 
  our population salivates at ` tax cuts ' , and any suggestion of raising any taxes on the rich leads to massive losses in the polls . 
  new zealanders are very right-wing . 
  i 'm just stating a fact : he 's a self-centred cunt . 
  of course you 'll have the least impact as a position 5 , because position 5s always have a low impact , having the fewest items . 
  not so much these days though, 
  do you still beat your wife ? 
  yes , because he votes for national . 
  if you care more about getting a tiny tax cut than the lives of millions of people then you are a self-centred cunt . 
  i was making fun of your leading question you fucking idiot . 
   looking at europe as a whole , that 's presumably why the european people 's party ( centre right - much like national ) , have been the largest party in the european parliament since 1999 ? 
  and the largest party in the european council since 2002 ? 
  and by far the largest party in the european commission . 
  eurosceptics participate in european elections far more than europhiles do . 
   even looking at individual european countries , it 's not quite as left wing as you might imagine . 
  best image i could come up with on short notice , but from the dailykos :, 
  that 's whether the * locally left * or * locally right * parties are in power . 
  that ignores that what is * locally right * is * globally left * in most european ( mainland ) countries . 
   if you have a look at the election trends lately in europe also , there is an undeniable rise in far right voting :, 
  far too small a sample size to really say that . 
  french elections showed a very strong anti-right vote , for example . 
  german elections the same . 
  uk elections were very strong for a very left-wing labour party for the first time in 20 + years . 
  no , they have n't . 
  ` they 're just as bad as each other ' rhetoric is a shameful lying . 
   because tax is literally the only reason some one would ever vote for national ? 
  that 's literally all they 've been campaigning on , so yes . 
   i 'm sorry , but you 're coming across as like some sort of angsty tweenager who has n't yet fully developed a sense of empathy and understanding for others .
