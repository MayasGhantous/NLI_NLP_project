  if you choose to ignore that these exist and act like everyone is always dead permanently and irretrievably , that 's a house rule . 
  resurrection is traditionally very prevalent in tabletop rpgs . 
   the endless question , `` what is a rpg ? 
  '' , its subjective , its historic , does n't mean you are correct . 
  it 's not a endless question . 
  rpg is a pretty well-defined genre . 
  you ca n't argue for pages that you think that some games are and are n't rpgs then just go ` omg it 's subjective ' when you run out of arguments . 
  and yet you ** still ** are missing the point , which is that ** moba ** is what we are talking about , and ** moba ** is well-defined not to include fps games or team-based shooters , for exampe , despite what it might look like it means . 
  i do n't think you quite got what i meant . 
  i literally have never played a game with tab-targeting where the game is n't solved almost immediately . 
  the argument that it 's better because it lets you focus on strategy and tactics instead of dodging or aiming kind of falls down when there 's no strategy or tactics and it 's all execution because the best strategy was found before the game was ever released and it 's a simple rotation , right ? 
  there are definitely games that have combat that is n't action combat ( but is n't tab target either ) , that are n't mmos , that have combat systems that could be used in mmos but as far as i know have n't been . 
  for example , dota 2 . 
  dota 2 is n't solved , not even close . 
  tab target games , in my experience , tend to always devolve into set rotations or priority systems or other simple solves strategies . 
  is this an artefact of the combat system , in your view , or more an artefact of fights all being so similar ? 
   again , only if you intellectual dishonest ... which you are . 
  i 'm not intellectually dishonest , you are . 
  you are the one that claims that moba means something other than what it actually means , using an argument that you only apply to this term and not to the term rpg , which you interpret much more narrowly . 
  again , i 'm not saying that you necessarily must interpret moba like this . 
  i do n't care if you do or you do n't . 
  what i 'm saying is that you do need to be consistent . 
  you ca n't go around arbitrarily deciding to be narrow in what you expect ` rp ' you mean in ` rpg ' , while being really broad in what you think ` ba ' means in moba . 
   true , but the term moba includes ( which was n't the intention of riot ) more than dota-likes or arts ; to be clear : moba \u2283 arts \u2283 data-likes, 
  riot literally defined the term moba , they decided what it means when they defined it . 
  since they defined it , its meaning has n't changed . 
  words do change meanings , but they do n't all change meanings , and this word has n't changed . 
  it still means exactly what it means when riot defined it : arts dota clones . 
  it was always used to mean games like dota , hon and lol , and that 's still what it means . 
   moba \u2283 arts \u2283 data-likes, 
  this does n't become true just because you say it over and over again . 
  nobody uses these terms like this except you . 
  riot do n't , that 's for sure . 
  i agree entirely , except i disagree with the first sentence . 
  boring developers making boring games are going to continue to make boring , formulaic crap . 
  i do n't know why people seem to assume that formulaic crap defines what mmos can possibly be , they do n't assume that in any other genre . 
   no , the underlaying logic behind the simplified argument still applies to the more complex real world scenario . 
  a pool of hundreds to thousands of servers is able to run more tasks in parallel than an mmo 's datacenter with a few dozen to a few hundred servers . 
  two things . 
  firstly , the ` underlying logic ' is the idea that you ca n't scale an mmo because you are constrained by the number of os threads you can run , which is * total and uninhibited bullshit of the highest order * . 
  it 's * simply false * . 
  that is not at all the primary limitation that is imposed on mmo developers . 
  secondly , your new claim ( that mmos have ' a few dozen to a few hundred ' servers while apparently other games have ` hundreds to thousands ' of servers ) is * unsubstantiated * and even if true , * misleading * . 
  mmos have fewer active players at once than mobas , for example , because they 're much less popular games . 
  of course they will have commensurately fewer servers . 
  even then , i have never seen a company release that much detail on its infrastructure for its game servers , because that 's quite competitively sensitive information , not even to mention the security concerns . 
   hence i specified instances being split up . 
  my argument is that mmos synchronize more data than conventional games , and have more `` cross-instance '' communication between the servers . 
  i 'd say almost all cross-instance communication in mmos comes in the form of either data that is allowed to be updated infrequently ( which is a lot more than laymen tend to assume ) or things unrelated to core gameplay , like chat and auction houses and that stuff . 
  chat is easy to scale , it 's been a solved problem literally for decades . 
  you 'll notice that wow prevents you from inspecting another player in your group when they 're in a different continent from you . 
  at least , it used to . 
  it might allow it these days . 
   your argument is a claim that mmos have simpler mechanics , and thus , have the same performance requirements as regular games . 
  this appears to be a circular reasoning . 
  as game mechanics are designed around what is feasible with the project 's scope , and thus the possible performance . 
  my argument , quite specifically , was that you claim that `` in a regular multiplayer game , the server only has to do this for about a dozen or two players , and entities in their immediate area . 
  in an mmo the server will have to do this for a few hundred to a few thousand players , every tick . '', 
  was rubbish . 
  that 's all . 
  you claimed ( quite absurdly ) and have continued to claim figures that are an order of magnitude off or more . 
  mmo servers do n't have to deal with more players than servers for other multiplayer games . 
   your argument is a claim that mmos have simpler mechanics , and thus , have the same performance requirements as regular games . 
  this appears to be a circular reasoning . 
  as game mechanics are designed around what is feasible with the project 's scope , and thus the possible performance . 
  even if we ignore action combat , mmo combat has stayed fairly simple because it 's the sort of gameplay people expect from mmos . 
  it might have come from technical restrictions on servers to some extent , back when mmos were the only games that developers ran the servers for , but now people have tab target games because people want tab target games . 
  then there 's the huge rise in action combat games with high tick rates and skill shots and all that stuff , which is all not much less intensive than something like dota from a server perspective . 
   that everything is perfectly even and nothing is remotely over powered . 
  in what sense ? 
  in a game with classes ? 
  there are many games with classes where every class is balanced to the point of competitive viability . 
  that does n't mean they all do literally identical things , but that the imbalances in their theoretical and practical maxima are significantly less important than the imbalances in the skill of the person using them . 
   again card games are totally different game . 
  why you bring it up is beyond me . 
  because they 're a million times harder to balance , but they 're balanced . 
  if someone asked me to come up with a game design that was easy to balance , i would give them wow : legion . 
  classes essentially all exactly the same utility , so all you have to do is tweak damage numbers to get every class to scale their damage with the gear available in the expansion at the skill level of play you care about balancing ( some games are balanced around low skill players , others are balanced around players with mediocre skill , some others around high skill players and some around professional-level players ) . 
  is that a fair bit of work ? 
  sure , of course it is . 
  there are 36 different specs , of course . 
  but they do n't have to be balanced pair-wise in duels . 
  they just have to be balanced against a common standard . 
  blizzard has more than the resources to balance wow . 
  do you think those games qualify for what i said ? 
   so i am supposed to scan through all your posts in a thread to find the one where you said something different to someone else ? 
  lol, 
  you 're supposed to understand the context of the conversation . 
  if someone says something that could be interpreted in two different ways ( which i did ) in a context that points to one of those ways , the way that actually is true and makes sense , and the way that does n't make sense , it 's not that hard to work out what i meant . 
   which is where you are wrong , ncsoft for sure did aspire for millions of subscribers and they got it and still have . 
  i disagree entirely . 
   so why post that curve ? 
  it does n't make any point come through just that this is the trend for essentially every game in the history of games depending on how big scale you are looking . 
  because every expansion since and including cataclysm has failed to grow wow or even keep its sub count stable , for the reasons that have been described many times by me and many others . 
  and yes , of course ` essentially every mmo ' ** since wow ** has done the same thing . 
  ** essentially every mmo since wow ** is a fucking boring wow clone . 
  depends what you mean by tab-target . 
  it 's called mudflation because it 's inflation and it was prevalent in muds ( multi-user dungeons : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mud ) . 
  i wonder how long it took for people to realise after the beatles that there would never be a band as dominatingly popular ever again . 
   huh ?
