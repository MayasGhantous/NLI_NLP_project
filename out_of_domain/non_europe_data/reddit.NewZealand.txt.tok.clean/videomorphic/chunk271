  that 's their starting point . 
  like it or not , legislation or not , that 's how it works in reality . 
   christ , anything but that patriarchal rubbish . 
  our society is biased against men in this matter . 
   when poor brown people abuse their children people want to remove family ties and protect children . 
  when brown people abuse their children , their children are n't taken away from their families because of intense pressures on cyfs to reduce the numbers of brown people whose children are taken away . 
  as a result , massive child abuse problem . 
   crazy white dudes self immolate and they are misunderstood with a genuine point . 
  if someone is pushed to such a point that he self-immolates , then that just reinforces the reality that the system is incredibly biased against men . 
  the lawyer for child was against him because lawyer for child is ** always ** against the man . 
  the system is incredibly biased against men . 
   but in this case , they clearly made the right decision, 
  there is no evidence of that whatsoever . 
   i see evidence the family court made the right decision . 
  no you do n't . 
   you know the emphasis in the family court is on the children right ? 
  no it is n't . 
  are you on drugs ? 
  labour had new zealand in the black . 
  national has finally , finally scraped their way back into the black after a decade of terrible economic mismanagement , by removing all limits on immigration , and that 's something to be proud of ? 
  it 's not a massive assumption . 
  it 's an assumption , but it 's a very clear , likely and safe assumption . 
  people are going to go over the edge somewhat when their kids are taken away . 
   you do n't just go from zero to self-immolation with one judicial decision . 
  clearly you do , because that 's precisely what he 's done . 
  absolutely . 
  infrastructure is the primary domain of government . 
  it 's fucking retarded how many things are contracted out to companies in this country now . 
  every single time you hear anything on the radio about some issue at msd or the health department , it 's ` company x , which is contracted by the ministry to provide service y , has refused an offer to interview ' . 
  every fucking time . 
  we need a party that will get rid of this ridiculous system and go back to having a government that can provide its own fucking services without having to use contractors . 
  good . 
  that 's precisely what should have happened . 
  yes they are . 
  come on . 
  i disagree with them , but they absolutely are after meaningful discussion . 
  no it is n't . 
  the ` lawyer for child ' system is an incredibly poorly designed and operated system . 
   labour had nz in the black did n't they ? 
  labour posted nine surpluses in the nine years they were in power . 
   that 's why they did n't get voted out ? 
  labour getting voted out had nothing to do with their economic management , which was impeccable . 
  it was n't an election issue in 2008 at all . 
  were you even paying attention ? 
   also , you forgetting about #christchurch or something ? 
  the earthquake did n't cost the government a cent . 
  the eqc 's fund is paid out of a levy on your insurance . 
  it had more than enough money to pay for the eqc 's expenses . 
  the eqc , i will remind you , was set up by the labour party . 
   or did you just `` forget '' about that to make your claim seem better than it really is ? 
  national 's economic management has been demonstrably incompetent in every way . 
  there 's no reason to assume the same series of events would n't have occurred , just earlier . 
  no , he could n't . 
  you can not govern without confidence and supply . 
   i see exactly where you 've gone wrong . 
  you see fathers as retaining a patriarchal property right over their child that they ought not to pay for . 
  what ? 
  it has nothing to do with ` patriarchy ' or ` property rights ' . 
  there 's no reason why fathers should have any less right to see their children than mothers . 
   you misunderstand and rage at the entire system ( where typical ideology for once means angry white dudes lose when it normally favours them ) because of that . 
  men lose in the family court because the family court is biased against them . 
  i love that in the one case where men are disadvantaged it 's suddenly all their fault , but in every case where women are disadvantaged or maori are disadvantaged , it 's the evil system oppressing them , in your eyes . 
  you know that the courts are biased against men , biased against maori , and biased towards politicians , farmers and rugby players . 
  you fucking know this . 
  admit it . 
   the system is there to let kids be cared for , and to divide property equitably . 
  ** in theory ** . 
  in reality , the system is there to let women have access to their children and to divide property equally . 
   if men are factually disadvantaged maybe they ought to take responsibility for themselves , and why they are unfit to parent in the eyes of a specialist judge . 
  men are disadvantaged in * results * . 
  that 's bias . 
  it has nothing to do with being unfit to parent . 
   it is not in right of being a parent that custody ought to be allocated, 
  barring any other concern , yes it fucking is . 
   but in right of the best interests of the child . 
  the best interests of children is to be in the equal custody of both parents . 
   if your point holds about maori , then surely ensuring angry dudes do n't have their kids taken away from them will lead equally to huge amounts of child abuse . 
  no , because men are n't being denied access to their children because of abuse or potential for abuse . 
  why do you find this so hard to understand ? 
   what government could do it today ? 
  literally today ? 
  parliament is dissolved , no vote could be taken . 
  i do mean literally right now . 
  next time parliament sits it would be great . 
  but we 're under constitutional conventions that say nothing should change right now . 
  what does literally right now have to do with anything ? 
  they 've had a decade to change this . 
  they wo n't even admit it 's an issue that needs addressing . 
   frankly , such a finding in fact normally reflects the truth . 
  no it does n't . 
  that 's the problem . 
   in our society , like most , men tend not to be equal caregivers and tend to sacrifice their career for the family less often . 
  false . 
  men are equal caregivers when given the opportunity . 
  men are forced to sacrifice their family for their career by women that do n't want to work and want to stay at home and look after kids . 
  there is intense pressure for men to look after their families financially . 
   it is only by recognising this patriarchal imbalance that the courts have been able to stop being hopelessly unfair to women . 
  false . 
  the family courts have * always * been incredibly biased towards women in awarding custody . 
   which means kids are best cared for more often by the more experienced care giver , ceteris paribus .
