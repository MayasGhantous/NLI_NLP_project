  if women are favoured for custody then it is socially a good thing insofar as it reflects those facts . 
  a man who sacrifices his career to be the major caregiver can reasonably expect to be retain custody . 
  women are in practice favoured as caregivers even in cases where they are clearly inappropriate as caregivers . 
   people can feel slighted and simply be wrong . 
  probably the case here . 
  a single case can be decided wrongly and the system not be biased . 
  mistakes happen . 
  you 're taking rather more from one man 's overreaction ( which shows pretty clearly he was probably never stable - rational self immolation is comparatively rare in our culture ) than the evidence reasonably allows . 
  it 's not a single case . 
  it 's many , many cases over a very long time . 
   most substantiated criticisms of the family court are about abusive men using the process to continue targeting their victims . 
  and the odd one about underfunding and terrible legislative interventions . 
  most criticisms that are covered by the media are those criticisms . 
  they are unsubstantiated . 
  they come from people that want the system to just believe everything they say and punish people without any evidence of wrongdoing . 
  there are of course abusive men , and the system has to deal with them , nobody is denying that . 
  but people forget it seems that there are lots of men that are n't abusive , and the system should not assume that anyone accused of being abusive is abusive . 
  there are thousands of cases of false accusations of abuse . 
   sadly , courts continue to give leeway to abusive parents ( both genders but the men seem to whine about it more like they have a property right over children ) because joint custody is meant to be a good thing . 
  cyfs continues to give leeway to abusive parents . 
  the family court gives leeway to * women * , by default . 
  it 's extremely difficult for a man to get primary custody of his children . 
  the mother basically has to be in prison . 
   my point about race was not about cyfs , it was about the reaction of people in the public , like yourself . 
  who seem to view angry middle age white men as victims . 
  no , the public overwhelmingly do n't give a shit about this issue . 
  the angry middle age white men in question ** are ** victims . 
  they 're being victimised by a biased system . 
  why do you find this so hard to understand ? 
  that 's a ridiculous assumption . 
   i just came out of family court after three years in it . 
  the judge was ridiculously fair , shot down all the ludicrous allegations , supported 50/50 care , went as far to say that i did everything that i could to demonstrate my suitability as a father , the judge even told my ex partner she does n't care that i smoke cannabis and wouldnt order any further drug testing . 
  anecdotes are not data . 
  the family court is biased . 
  that is shown in the results . 
  i 'm sure there are plenty of maori that felt their judges were fair , but the reality is that the criminal courts are biased against maori in sentencing . 
  the reality is the same in this case : the results speak for themselves . 
   the reason i was so successful was because i ignored all the talk about bias , conspiracy , or unfairness and concetrated on making my life good , being in a good position to look after my children , i was totally honest about my situation and what i was doing . 
  i took care of my mental health , i demostrated a large support system that i was very proactive in setting up . 
  no , the reason is that you got lucky . 
  people do n't like admitting that they just got lucky . 
  people want to assume that if something good happened to them , it 's because of their own positive qualities . 
  most of the time it just is n't . 
  you got lucky . 
  good on you . 
  lots of people do n't get lucky . 
  the fact is that as a woman you do n't need to be in a good position to look after children , you do n't have to be honest about your situation , you do n't have to take care of your mental health , you do n't have to have a large support system and you do n't have to be proactive in setting up a support system . 
  you have to turn up . 
  and 99 % of the time , that 's sufficient . 
   it is n't biased , it is being abused . 
  massive difference . 
  the abuse come from partners not the court or the system . 
  do you see how that works ? 
  the system is n't biased but it is really easy to be abused, 
  the system is biased . 
  men have to go to extraordinary lengths to get a chance at equal custody . 
  the default assumption is that the man is a lying cheating abusive cunt , and any testimony from the mother is taken as true by default . 
  again , on average . 
  no , it has n't . 
  you can not govern without the confidence of the house and you can not spend money ( necessary to govern ) without passing budgets i.e. 
  supply . 
  how can someone misunderstand statistics as much as you and still exist ? 
  compulsory unionism please, 
   there are a lot of ex-labour voters amongst the older generation who no longer vote labour so why does n't labour seem to represent older kiwis anymore, 
  this was your silly conclusion, 
  it 's not anti-freedom or anti-worker . 
  workers can ** choose ** to unionise , and then they can ** choose ** to negotiate with the employer and ** agree ** that the employer only employs unionised workers . 
  currently you 're not allowed to negotiate that . 
  * that * is antifreedom . 
   can you provide proof that family court starts with the assumption that men are not suitable for looking after kids ? 
  you keep saying that throughout this thread , but you never provide proof . 
  nobody has provided proof of anything in the thread , why would you require it from me ? 
   all of my experience with the family court has left me with the impression that they aggressively pursue 50/50 splits of both child custody and relationship property unless there is a clear reason why this is not appropriate e.g. 
  one partner has been physically or mentally abusive . 
  you got lucky, 
  reality is uncomfortable , sorry . 
  that 's a point of view . 
  it 's not the point of view of most people . 
  the benefits of equal custody ( parents being able to see their kids , and kids getting equal time with both parents ) far outweigh that issue . 
  it 's extraordinarily obvious to anyone , no matter how young they are , that rules are different in different places . 
  behaviour at home vs. at school vs. at another child 's house are clearly different . 
  kids know this . 
  two homes is no different . 
  all change takes getting used to . 
  yes you do . 
  i literally set zero value on someone having a degree . 
  it tells me absolutely nothing about their intelligence , diligence , or knowledge . 
  this is a sad state of affairs . 
  degrees used to mean something . 
  youth voting has been declining since * well * before social media . 
   i wasnt going to address this but i will now . 
  the reason you so heavily invested in your narrative is because it absolves of your responsibility , and it absolves you from trying to make your situation better , it absolves from being polite and making reasonable arguments with evidence in a family court . 
  you no longer have to take any action when you talk about bias in the court because the problem is too big and you cant do anything about it . 
  it has nothing to do with me , or my situation , because i 'm not involved in the family court in any way . 
  i base my arguments on my * observation * of the family court process and the * hard statistical reality * . 
  if i were , then you would be victim blaming as well . 
   i challenge you to talk about how you are involved in mens support groups or supporting men going through the family court , i bet you cant because you are too busy talking about a conspiracy . 
  are you on drugs ? 
  are women conspiracy theorists for saying that the reality is that women are paid less ? 
  are maori conspiracy theorists when they say that the police and court system are both biased against them ?
