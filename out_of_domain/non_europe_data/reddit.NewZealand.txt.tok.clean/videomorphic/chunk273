  i 'm not involved in mens support groups because anyone involved in mens support groups is publicly shamed and labelled as an mra , which is a dirty word . 
  i 'm not supporting men going through the family court because that has nothing to do with me . 
   your version of reality is bullshit . 
  if you had seen the things i admitted to in sworn affidavits you would have to reconsider your postition becasue there is no way i would have had the result i did if bias was in play too . 
  i used the law that is all . 
  i do n't give a flying fuck about your personal situation . 
  again , your anecdotes mean literally nothing . 
  the hard statistical evidence proves that the family courts are biased against men . 
  ask literally anyone and they 'll agree that they are . 
   for everybody else , this is the problem , investing your energy into problems that dont exist so you can ignore the problems you can change . 
  the only conspiracy i will get behind is the one where we conspire to make your life better through positive changes and giving family court another shot with a new perspective . 
  i have zero time to talk about how shit your life is and all the time in the world to talk about how we are going to make it better . 
  and more lunacy where you rant and rave and pretend that i 'm talking about my own situation ( i do n't have children , you retard ) to avoid the reality that the * facts * support the * reality * that * literally everyone acknowledges * that the family courts are highly biased towards mothers . 
  no , the 5 % threshold is important . 
   61 % of australia 's gdp is produced by its tertiary industry . 
  so think finance , education , banking , it , hospitality and accounting etc. 
  education is n't an industry . 
  banking , it , accounting and finance are all very , very focused around supporting their primary industries . 
  hospitality is a terrible industry that is almost entirely made up of low-paid jobs in cafes . 
  thank god . 
  i do n't see this view around here very often . 
  there are a lot of what i 'll completely uncharitably call ` palmer fanboys ' that insist we need a written constitution because ... everyone else has one and geoffrey palmer said we do . 
  i love new zealand 's political structure . 
  the same structure that led to the awful neoliberal reforms of the 80s has led to ten times as many reforms that were 10 or more years ahead of other countries !, 
   you are wrong and you have no evidence of your claims . 
  you are wrong and you have no evidence of your claims . 
   see how abusive you got ? 
  that means you ca n't handle this conversation . 
  only if you assume that calling someone a retard for saying something retarded makes me incapable of ` handling this conversation ' . 
  given that i 'm handling this conversation fine and am perfectly happy to offend you as much as i like , i disagree . 
  i see nothing remotely wrong with calling you a good-for-nothing sack of shit , for example . 
  i 'm handling the conversation fine . 
  i 'm perfectly calm . 
  i just do n't care about offending you with bad language . 
  you support your argument by basically cycling through three arguments :, 
  * they deserve it , all men are abusive pigs, 
  * it is n't true ( then why argue that it 's justified , if it supposedly is n't true ? ), 
  * you 're just salty about losing your kids ( except i do n't have any ), 
  you have n't provided any evidence for your claims . 
  nobody in this thread has provided any evidence for their claims . 
  you 're just following the typical reddit argument structure : you ` argue ' by just contradicting what the other person says , then you attack the person you 're arguing with claiming they are biased because of their identity or their personal situation , then fall back on ridiculous requests for hard proof of things that have never been studied academically to the rigour you personally require to be convinced . 
  it 's always the same structure . 
  contradicting someone is n't an argument . 
  i 've provided actual arguments in my comments . 
  you have n't . 
  you 've just said ` nuh that 's not true ' and then attacked me . 
  i lean more and more towards fpp every time i think about our voting system . 
  there 's no question that turnout is lower in countries with more complicated voting systems and i suspect in systems with more ` faceless ' party-based voting . 
  i think the uk really benefits from fpp . 
  they still have more than two parties . 
  we seem to be sliding back into a two-party system anyway . 
  it 's entirely possible , if unlikely , that we could have no greens * or * nzf in the next parliament , which would mean 119 lab/nat mps , an act mp and a maori party mp . 
  that 's way less diverse than the uk parliament . 
  minor parties push the major parties towards the middle . 
  that 's okay if you 're a centrist , because you always get what you want , but i think the greens make it really difficult for labour to be a truly left-wing party , for example . 
  the same has been true for national as well , at least in the past , with act and the conservatives , who nearly got in , remember . 
  majority governments are also more able to carry out real reform . 
  since mmp we 've had no real reform , no real significant change . 
  tweaks , here and there . 
  benefits up , benefits down , tax up , tax down . 
  but no real structural reform . 
  we do n't want structural reform constantly , that would be unstable , but we do need some real structural reform . 
  the idea of ` wasted votes ' in fpp is misguided . 
  if anyone actually still believes that , look at ukip . 
  i 'm not sure they ever got more than a single mp in all of the times they stood in the british elections , but they still got what they wanted . 
  their vote kept rising and rising and the major parties realised they had to be listened to or they 'd lose their seats , and change happened . 
  that 's a good thing !, 
  that 's what people wanted . 
  too many minor parties are a bad idea . 
  it makes parliament too unstable . 
  it 's unstable-enough as it is . 
  we 've had many close calls that have almost destabilised our government , with governments just edging in on 61 seats , as it is . 
  i 'm waiting for yours . 
  that freedom is called ` compulsory unionism ' . 
  silly name , maybe , but that 's the name . 
   could n't you achieve the same thing now if the union were to establish itself as an employer of its members and then tender an exclusive contract to provide services to another company ? 
  i do n't think unions are allowed to provide services like that to be able to be a union . 
  if they are , they would be required to be open to employing non-union members anyway . 
   true , but anyone who watched that guyon espiner winston peters interview could reasonably have concerns for ol winston 's mental state . 
  i 'd look pretty insane if it were my hundredth time explaining to clueless retards like guyon espiner that it 's possible to be a ** centrist ** party that is compatible with both national and labour . 
  because it 's true . 
  voter turnout just * is * lower in countries with more complicated voting systems . 
  go look at the turnout numbers for various countries with various different voting systems . 
  for example , new zealand 's turnout has dropped significantly since the introduction of mmp , especially youth turnout , and ** especially ** turnout amongst people that never experienced voting in fpp . 
  and this is the problem with political discussion . 
  you can say just about anything , and 95 % of the responses are people just parroting the same lines . 
  fpp is completely democratic . 
  and nobody can manipulate constituency boundaries in new zealand , because we have the electoral commission . 
  this is n't the united states , and their political issues are not our political issues . 
  i just explained in my post why i do not think that mmp is a ` better way to elect a representative government ' . 
  rather than just stating that mmp is better , why do n't you actually respond to my points ? 
  the proportion of mps in parliament for a party accurately reflecting the proportion of people that voted for that party or someone in that party is n't necessarily a good measure of the quality of a voting system . 
  in fact , in most voting systems you do n't vote for a party at all , so it 's meaningless . 
  if we only wanted to measure the voting system on that basis , we 'd just use straight up proportional list-based voting systems . 
  i know , right ? 
  i understand that there are good intentions behind it , but the road to hell is paved with good intentions . 
  the problem with those sorts of targets is that you start to base policy on what improves the measurements and not what actually improves the country . 
  more people getting a tertiary education is a great goal , in theory , but unfortunately it 's been achieved by basically just lowering the standards to get a tertiary education to the point where more people can do one . 
  what we should be doing is raising the quality of education using the wonderful technology we now have access to , so that we can get more people at the same standard . 
  it 's the same unfortunate effect that causes national to increase the number of swimmable rivers by * just reducing the standard for swimability * .
