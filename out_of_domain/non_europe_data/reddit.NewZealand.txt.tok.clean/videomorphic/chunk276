   if anything , the smaller parties that represent a smaller percentage of voters would push lab and nat to be more radical . 
  what would labour have to gain by becoming more left-wing ? 
  the distribution between lab and grn does n't really matter , what matters is getting nats to vote for labour , which you can only achieve by going right . 
  the same with the nats . 
  they ca n't achieve anything by going right , only by going left . 
  they end up in the middle . 
   and on your second point , right now , it 's looking like winston gets to decide who wins . 
  exactly : a centrist minor party that might barely scrape into power is going to decide who wins , which means more stagnation in the centre . 
  new zealand was a great country when we had the opportunity to experiment . 
  then we experimented , came up badly ( roger-fucking-nomics ) , and then * almost immediately afterwards * switched to a system where serious structural reform is almost impossible . 
  stack and ks . 
  that 's what i do, 
  and costs billions by ruining local students ' educations . 
  because they consume social media . 
  before social media they watched just as much tv and listened to the radio just as much as anyone else . 
  it is n't . 
  constitutional convention defines exactly what the governor-general can do . 
  yeah it should be banned all week honestly . 
  no , it should be banned by law all of voting week . 
  thread ? 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  i 'm talking about the * election as a whole * . 
  the whole country . 
  not reddit . 
  nobody cares about reddit . 
   more, 
  i 'm not getting ` worked up ' . 
  i 'm explaining it to you because youre dim, 
  because of neoliberal ideology . 
   so many other parties are based in nostalgic views of new zealand , stereotypes , mischaracterisations , or prejudices . 
  not top . 
  top is completely evidence based . 
  hahaha . 
  no they certainly are not . 
  okay , but other than nzf , greens , act , united future , the maori party , alliance and the progressives , ** what have the minor parties ever done for us ** ? 
  no i fucking would not . 
  there 's no such thing as ` labor ' . 
  which is irrelevant here . 
  and a bad thing . 
  more minor parties is bad . 
  on the contrary . 
   it was actually good to see many places with a red candidate but a blue party vote . 
  no it was n't . 
  it just reinforced that mmp sucks and fpp would have given us a left government . 
  fpp is a much better system . 
   an stv on the party vote, 
  that 's not what stv is . 
  we 'd have enormous electorates . 
  stv with 3-member electorates sucks . 
  has to be at least 5 really . 
  he stated a bunch of things that are mostly fair , but some of them are wrong . 
  that one is wrong . 
  that 's all that matters . 
  act and united future are exactly what is wrong with tiny minor parties : they do n't have any real identity and just vote in line with national or labour because they have little leverage . 
  no , it 's a bad thing . 
  i was there for fpp . 
  it was better . 
  nope, 
  national won 41 electorates because the maori electorates unfairly pull left-wing votes out of general electorates . 
   the coalition system with mmp innately promotes moderate balance , everyone deserves representation, 
  that 's why it sucks . 
  moderate balance is complete shit . 
  moderate balance is just the neoliberal status quo , never actually changing anything in any meaningful way . 
   and ofc ffp also results in stuff like trump . 
  or muldoon . 
  fpp results in change . 
  mmp results in maintaining the status quo . 
  mmp is very conservative . 
   with numbers that close these days , it 'd be naturally more spread resulting in a coalition requiring muldoon to be more moderate . 
  muldoon * was * moderate . 
  he did n't do anything radical . 
  if we had mmp then , then we 'd never have liberalised our economy under lange 's government and we would still be applying for a license to import a car . 
   the 1969 election that gave birth to rogernomics , 45.2 % vs 44.2 % , but winner takes all with 45 vs 39 seats . 
  once again a polarising figure but would have been more moderate with mmp when seats are more proportional and would likely require a coalition . 
  again , ** more radical changes is a good thing ** . 
  new zealand has always thrived on having * structural reform * as the basis for our identity . 
  we should be undergoing regular reform . 
  that 's what makes nz work . 
  since the introduction of mmp we 've stagnated . 
  yes it is a bad thing . 
  just as it would be a bad thing if only people that attended high school paid for it . 
  just as it would be a bad thing if only people that went to hospital paid for it . 
  just as it is a bad thing that only people that go to the dentist pay for it . 
   first , based on what are you saying that stv with 3-member electorates suck ? 
  that 's just established reality . 
   second , who cares about large electorates ? 
  that would prevent act pulling stunts like they do in epsom every time . 
  stunts ? 
  they have an electorate mp . 
  why would n't epsom vote for act ? 
  they represent them best . 
  yes it fucking was . 
  objectively better . 
  most of those people will be in the special votes . 
   having national or labour in government made little difference to me . 
  it is the single biggest and most important part of the election . 
  it was balanced before . 
  it 's been deliberately made less balanced . 
   overpowered like splitpushing used to be in prime naga/tb days . 
  that was n't ` overpowered ' .
