  you are voting in your own self-interest . 
  you are voting for a $ 20/wk tax cut , when you should n't be . 
  that is the essence of being a cunt . 
  you ca n't ruin this country then turn around and say ` you have to be nice to me ' . 
  fuck you . 
  that 's like turning up , taking all the land , and then going ` but iwi , the land belongs to everyone , not you !, 
  then they 're ignorant . 
   infrastructure and polluted rivers have been issues for ages , this is n't something that magically appeared during national 's term . 
  and they did n't do a thing to fix those issues , which makes them their responsibility . 
  they made them ** much ** worse . 
  fuck off you slimy bag of shit . 
  yes , because * your scummy party have made it that way * . 
  there are rational , ** self-interested ** reasons for other peoples ' votes . 
   welcome to democracy , you piece of utter shit . 
  you want a guaranteed left government that wo n't get voted out , try soviet russia or communist china . 
  ask the people there how that worked out . 
  want a guaranteed right-wing government that wo n't get voted out , try new zealand , where the government will keep raising immigration knowing that immigrants vote for them . 
  ask people how that works out . 
  oh , terribly ? 
  shit , that sucks . 
  anyone that looks at the national party and says ` yeah sure , i want those people running the country ' is either retarded or a fucking cunt . 
   newsflash , we do n't educate people for 13 years only on how to vote and our history . 
  nobody said we did you fucking retarded cunt . 
   there are no education requirements to vote . 
  you can drop out when you 're 7 , if you make it 18 , have at . 
  being born here makes you a citizen and gives you the right to vote . 
  if you are n't born here , there are stricter requirements . 
  they should be made much stricter . 
   and they do n't ruin our country , racist cunts like you do . 
  not supporting rampant , culture-destroying , suburb-destroying , nation-destroying , market-destroying immigration is not ` racist ' . 
   you 've missed the point as well , another example of what my comment highlights . 
  in my eyes , and 46 % of new zealand , the country is not ruined . 
  they are simply wrong . 
  you are simply wrong . 
  the country is ruined , and it 's only going to get worse . 
  i go anywhere in this awful fucking city and it 's just horrible . 
  i can spend a day in this city and not hear a word of english . 
  there are people i work with that are permanent residents and literally can not hold a conversation in english . 
  house prices are insane . 
  homelessness is a massive issue . 
  the christchurch rebuild has been incompetently managed . 
  rivers that were swimmable 10 years ago are disgusting today . 
  these issues are ** all ** caused by national . 
  they are * all ** only going to get worse , not better , over time . 
  how anyone can claim that this is ` democracy in action ' when they voted for a party that got rid of democracy in christchurch as soon as ecan started enforcing restrictions on farmers use of water is a hypocrite . 
  there 's a clear fucking difference between a vote of self-interest when you 're struggling to feed your family and a vote of self-interest when you have a dozen fucking rental properties . 
   as i said to op , it 's hard to believe labour when they say they 'll fix it given they did fuck all last time . 
  they did n't campaign on fixing it , last time . 
  what , do you think they 'll get into office and then just not do what they 've promised to do ? 
  this is n't the national party we 're talking about . 
   and it 's all beside the point , the rivers issue is one with a bit of nuance and not simply a matter of voters being greedy fuckwits , as op asserted . 
  the rivers issue has no nuance whatsoever . 
  intensification of dairy farming has been said , again and again and again , to be environmentally damaging . 
  national allows it purely because they represent farmers and want them to benefit at the expense of others . 
  you have absolutely no clue at all . 
  this election was entirely swung by immigrants . 
  looking at the numbers , if chinese immigrants had n't voted for them , national would have lost so badly that not even nzf would get them into government . 
  there 's a different standard of behaviour for self-interest when you 're literally starving to death vs. when you just want more money despite having more than enough ? 
  no fucking way !, 
  fuck you , you slimy awful cunt . 
  i hope you die and i hope every single person that voted the same way as you dies . 
  fuck you . 
   circlejerk, 
  there 's nothing circlejerky about this subreddit . 
  being correct is n't a circlejerk . 
  why would i know anything about london 's house prices ? 
   when you come over to a country , and contribute equally as much as someone who was born here , pay the same or even more tax than a nz born person , and are as or more productive than an nz born person , why should n't you be allowed to vote ? 
  because you are n't a kiwi . 
  new zealand is n't for you . 
  it 's for kiwis . 
  kiwis should be allowed to vote , and only kiwis . 
  and that is why all discussion of category theory in a programming context is a silly waste of time : none of it actually applies in any meaningful sense to programming . 
   css is being supplanted with houdini . 
  wtf ? 
  css is completely fine . 
  the people that have a problem with it are the people that are n't interested in learning how things work and expect that copy-pasting code from stackoverflow will work . 
  that 's not what ` worse is better ' means . 
  what do people even use these things for ? 
  i have played this game for a long time . 
  terrorblade was n't overpowered . 
  this was after illusion tower damage was nerfed , even . 
   i disagree . 
  monads arise everywhere , and i truly mean everywhere . 
  that 's why they 're a meaningless abstraction . 
   building reusable libraries ( mind you : with ts , so mostly statically typed ) takes you very quickly to either : huge javaee-style oo libraries ; [ or ] monadic frameworks with lots of higher order functions . 
  i just can not agree with this claim . 
  there 's lots of reusable code out there that is neither . 
   in the second case , category theory takes a lot of the issues related with rediscovering hot water away , and makes many of the abstract points more evident . 
  when building monadic_react , i must say i did not yet fully master the monoidal nature of monads . 
  when i rebuilt the core of the framework with bind defined only as map then join , a lot of complexity just disappeared and i could focus on a smaller surface area . 
  and monadic_react is used in practice for at least one large project within the company , and various smaller libraries in other projects . 
  lol , again , this is just totally untrue . 
  monads are not a good abstraction , or a useful abstraction , even in haskell , let alone in a non-pure functional language . 
  given that i have studied both computer science and category theory , * and * am a programmer ? 
  yeah , i feel pretty qualified to say it . 
  ... and has nothing to do with category theory ... 
  no , loops are not a meaningless abstraction . 
  and yet ` monad ` is . 
  that does n't mean it is n't a meaningless abstraction . 
  it 's not arbitrary .
