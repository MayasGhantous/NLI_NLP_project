  to many people . 
  cosmetic progression is important . 
   you 're focusing on cosmetic . 
  i 'm not saying it has to have cosmetics , i 'm saying it could have anything as long as it does n't offer game play advantage . 
  cosmetics . 
  it 's not failure of imagination . 
  it 's literally true by definition . 
  if it does n't affect gameplay , then it is by definition cosmetic , because ` cosmetic ' means ` not related to gameplay ' . 
   sell me character slots, 
  gameplay advantage, 
   sell me inventory space, 
  ** massive ** gameplay advantage, 
   sell me bank space, 
  gameplay advantage, 
  they do offer a gameplay advantage , and they are necessary to have . 
  with more inventory space you can fit more potions , more food , more gear , more everything . 
  you can gather more resources in your inventory before you have to go back to base . 
  that 's a massive advantage . 
  what fucking drugs is this guy on . 
  how is inventory space not a massive advantage ? 
  the graphics have improved ** immensely ** from then . 
  literally every game has poor graphics in initial development . 
  every single game in history does . 
  the pve does matter , and it 's extremely important . 
  if you think that the only thing that matters is an mmo is ` levelling up ' then you 're an ignorant fool . 
   graphics and gameplay looks amazing . 
  i 'm glad i tagged you as ` likes bdo ' so i can ignore your opinions . 
   mostly vanity , some stuff to make it faster to progress ,, 
  standard blatant pay to win bullshit , in other words . 
  immersion to me is what immersion means to everyone else : it 's about feeling like you are in an actual real living place . 
  it 's about feeling like the world is a world . 
  it 's not about lore , it 's not not about lore . 
  part of it is verisimilitude . 
  when someone says that something feels ` unrealistic ' in a world with magic and dragons , they 're probably talking about verisimilitude . 
  verisimilitude is about being realistic within the concept of the world . 
  it 's about the world following its own rules . 
  if the rules of magic in a world imply that you need to conserve energy and so you need to sacrifice your life to resurrect someone , it would feel very odd to have a scene where someone resurrects an entire town and survives , for example . 
  so part of it is that the world feels like it obeys its own rules . 
  but part of it is just that the world feels like a place . 
  things exist because it 's a world and there 's a reason within that world for that thing to exist . 
  not because that thing existing is convenient to players . 
  instant teleportation makes the world feel trivial and small , which makes it feel less like a real place . 
  the real world is gigantic , and in movies and books ( especially in books , where the cgi budget is the limits of your imagination ) , fantasy worlds are often gigantic too . 
  flight paths in wow feel like they could exist in the world . 
  it 's weird that there are teleports all over the place in some games , but the world does n't reflect that in its economic structure for example . 
  i do n't think you understand what i mean . 
  mmorpgs are good because they 're virtual societies . 
  they are n't all about combat or competition . 
  there 's cooperation in the game , and not just cooperation against other players . 
  cooperation for mutual benefit . 
  they are economies . 
  i have n't played it . 
  no it is n't . 
  wow grew and continued to grow over time . 
  it reached a peak when they made massive changes to the gameplay that made it more ` casual-friendly ' , ironically . 
  that 's very different from a game that gets a short burst of popularity on the basis of hype , but then immediately loses it when people find that the game is n't fun . 
  i like the idea of a more top-down game . 
  imagine a game that was like a combination of diablo 3 and runescape . 
  so it 's got 3d graphics , nice 3d graphics preferably , you click to move , but unlike diablo it 's not all about killing hordes of stuff in dungeons . 
  you click on something to autoattack it . 
  you ca n't just walk through things , you have to walk around them ( this is where tanking comes from ) . 
  monsters should require different strategies to take them down . 
  how you fight a dragon should be completely different from how you fight a skeleton . 
  skeletons should be vulnerable to crushing weapons and ( like all undead ) however you classify any ` holy magic ' you have , and probably fire magic . 
  but they should be pretty heavily resistant to piercing damage ( it would probably go right through ) . 
  let 's say you want to go fight some skeletons . 
  maybe they drop something you really want . 
  maybe they 're really efficient xp for you because your current best weapon is a mace . 
  maybe they drop something that 's really valuable . 
  maybe for a quest , or some npc has given you a task of doing so . 
  whatever the reason , you have to prepare . 
  not in the sense that you should have to grind for hours to get the materials to do this ( which is what a lot of games seem to think of as ` preparation ' ) . 
  but you do have to get the appropriate sorts of weapons and armour that skeletons are vulnerable to , work out which skeleton spot you want to go to , etc. 
  actual combat mechanics ? 
  something like a hybrid of diablo-style games ( where you click on things to attack them , you have a small number of abilities you can use , you spam-click on stuff to attack it , the camera is fixed above with you centered , etc. 
  ) , dota-style games ( where you click on things to autoattack them , you have the same small number of abilities , separately controlled camera ) and runescape ( where you click on things to autoattack , you do n't generally have abilities - maybe one or two - and the camera is fixed like in diablo ) . 
  in general , i do n't want to click on something and make that my implicit target , then spam 1231231232 . 
  i think that in this day and age you might be able to get away with simple graphics , but probably wo n't get away with grid-based worlds like runescape anymore . 
   dota2 is n't solved because it 's a pvp game . 
  against other players , it 's no longer about maximizing damage or rotations , it becomes a battle of reading and predicting each other . 
  what 's optimal will change because every person is different . 
  counterstrike is a pvp game , and it 's basically entirely solved . 
  the best weapons are known , which weapons to buy when is known , the best strategies are basically known . 
  the game is really a game of skill and very short-term tactics , the strategy has n't changed since 1.6 . 
  the strategic decision-making is really about whether you want to take risks or not , and how well you can read your opponents . 
  but it 's solved . 
  dota is different from this . 
  it 's not solved at all . 
  players in public matchmaking are constantly coming up with new and innovative builds and strategies that sound ridiculous but actually work really well . 
  the reason for this is that it all depends on the niche you 're in . 
  the game gives you the tools to counter and adapt to your opponents ' builds and strategies . 
  it 's balanced just right so that you have time to adapt and counter your opponent 's strategy or build choice , but not before they get some benefit out of it . 
  part of this is yes , that it 's pvp . 
  that means every game is different . 
  but you do n't need every combat encounter to be 100 % unique to have a good game with varied strategies and builds . 
  the problem is that in modern mmos , 99.5 % of pve content is exactly identically the same . 
  there 's bugger all variation between monsters . 
  even when there 's some variation , you can usually just do exactly the same thing every time anyway , because the variations do n't force a change in strategy . 
  that does n't have to be the case . 
  monsters can require varied strategies and builds in mmos .
