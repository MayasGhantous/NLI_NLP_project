  nobody tries to make those games work . 
  why would n't they upvote me ? 
  i 'm right . 
  no they did n't . 
  labour have n't encouraged anything against the chinese . 
  labour are n't racist , they have n't said anything racist . 
  you 've got no reasoned argument so you call me intellectually disabled ? 
  you are acting as if you 're intellectually disabled . 
  it was a pretty good assumption . 
   andrew little is a racist unionist . 
  no he is n't . 
   he became desperate and did what national did under brash ( and what winston does all the time ) and tried to isolate a group of people as a scapegoat to pick on . 
  what national did under brash was the only good thing they 've ever done . 
   it was disgusting . 
  protecting your own citizens from foreigners is not disgusting , it 's part of government . 
   andrew little did n't invent racism , and he 's definitely not the first politician to use it to try to garner votes . 
  he 's not smart or creative enough to think of anything for himself . 
  but he used his personal dislike of asians and indians as a cheap and misguided way to become popular . 
  fortunately most of the country has grown up enough that his thick pigheaded idea backfired . 
  nobody in the labour party ` dislikes asians and indians ' . 
  we dislike ** what unrestricted foreign investment and immigration does to our economy and culture ** . 
   yes it was a stupid ignorant poll that never should have been used but one poll does n't invalidate everything else . 
  no it was n't . 
  it was n't stupid . 
  it was n't ignorant . 
  no , i like our culture . 
  i do n't want our culture to become their culture . 
  that 's not racist , no matter how much you want to destroy new zealand culture . 
   care to justify your position or are you going to just make statements that no one is going to agree with because they 're wrong ? 
  only self-hating people that wrap themselves up in white guilt think labour are racist . 
  the sorts of people that think that you ca n't be racist towards white people and that white people are at fault for everything . 
   how exactly does looking at chinese last names in relation to property being purchased give us any valuable information about the rates of overseas property investment ? 
  because chinese people in new zealand are predominantly not born in new zealand . 
  if you have a chinese last name you 're very unlikely to be a new zealander . 
  the street price is the relevant number , and it 's around $ 1m/kg . 
  oh yeah you 're right , all foreigners are our friends . 
  we should get rid of our military and just accept everyone into our country with open arms . 
  it 's working great in germany !, 
  publishers are who get all aaa games funded . 
  that includes aaa mmos . 
  mmos do not have to be aaa . 
  it certainly does n't take decades to make an mmorpg . 
  i 'm not sure that any mmorpg has been in development for decades , considering it 's 2016 and mmorpgs did n't really exist before the 90s . 
  the only reason people think that procedural generation makes boring worlds is that they only notice the procedural generation when they find a world boring and want to find a reason to complain about . 
  procedurally generated worlds that are n't boring do n't get considered because nobody notices that they 're procedurally generated , because they 're not boring . 
  holy shit this game is awesome . 
  i think the standard way of travelling with a baby in new zealand is to somehow encourage it to scream as loudly as humanly possible on an aeroplane . 
  does n't matter why . 
  the fact is that they do it . 
  the fact is that i should n't have to put up with it . 
  the fact is that having a reason for it does n't mean that i should put up with it , it means they should n't be on aeroplanes . 
  they could at least make an effort to put all the parents with young children at the front or back of the plane or whatever , so that you can explicitly choose to get a ticket away from the screaming babies . 
  i do have sympathy for the parents , i really do . 
  but i also have sympathy for myself . 
  fuck you . 
  you are n't entitled to have your screaming child on the plane . 
  no , you are n't . 
  nobody has a right to aeroplane travel . 
   if a human being is screaming in pain ( rather than misbehaviour , and any parent can tell the difference ) , through no fault of their own , then ... 
  well , shit . 
  to complain about the resulting noise ? 
  that demonstrates an almost psychopathic lack of compassion . 
  no it does n't . 
  i have plenty of sympathy for the child . 
  i also have sympathy for myself because a child screaming is a * very * painful experience to listen to for me . 
  i have very sensitive hearing . 
  why should i be forced to spend more to have a plane journey that is n't literally a highly painful 12 hours of screaming noise ? 
  why should n't the parents just learn that you ca n't take babies on long haul flights ? 
  seriously , it 's not hard to avoid air travel for a couple of years with a baby . 
  i literally have about 20 alt accounts . 
  all are subscribed . 
  why would i be forced to spend more ? 
   i think you 'll find that most people have the right to be allowed to travel on an airplane , dumbass . 
  certainly not . 
  not if you are being disruptive . 
  but that is completely ignored for parents because political correctness . 
  you do not have the right to do anything you want . 
  you have the right to do what you want ** as long as you do not disturb others ** . 
  no you do n't . 
  nobody has a right to use an aeroplane ** if they are being disruptive . 
   buckingham palace declined to comment on how the prize would be spent, 
  hopefully as long as possible . 
  well thank fuck that was n't an option then . 
  the fun ones . 
  in the same way that `` fixed '' lightning bolt would do damage to yourself , yes . 
   it would be a very different game and would have far fewer `` busted '' strategies . 
  the game would be worse, 
  delver is n't a power level mistake though . 
  counterspell and mana leak are not too powerful to print . 
  christ they 're dumb at wotc . 
  that 's ** exactly ** the power level that is right and balanced . 
   how broken do you have to be to shift the meta in modern ? 
  not at all . 
  they would cause no problems in modern or standard . 
  they never caused problems in either format in the past . 
   i assume you mean if you bring everything in the format up to that power level . 
  no , just the subset of cards people play . 
   at which point welcome to power creep . 
  going back to the power level we used to have is n't power creep . 
  it 's balance .
