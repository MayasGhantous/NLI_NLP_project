  what you 're saying is utter crap . 
  there are no mmorpgs that require anything like the skill that dota requires to be competitive , and yet dota has much faster ttk than any mmo i know of . 
  what does that tell you ? 
  the op said ** if ** two players are evenly matched ** then ** they should be able to kill each other quickly . 
  not that every pair of players ** should ** be evenly matched . 
   this idea that everything needs to be perfectly balanced is boring . 
  agreed , but that 's not the point we 're discussing here . 
  please read the post . 
  well the example he gives is a bit over the top , but the general idea of a paper-scissors-rock system would be that every class has strengths and weaknesses . 
  rangers might lose to melee in a fight , but be balanced because their arrows can cut right through the flimsy robes of mages , while mages beat melee because their metal armour conducts magic . 
   if the fight lasts 2 seconds it can easily be argued that there is no skill involved . 
  no it ca n't . 
   why would a dev bother with balance if there was literally no way to know what the balance was if everyone could one shot each other ? 
  why would a stupid person on / r/mmorpg think that short time to kill means `` everyone can one shot everyone '' ? 
   it has been seen in mmos where the ttk was too short , it drove players away and the overall game play suffered . 
  that 's never , ever been true . 
  no game has succeeded or failed based on its ttk . 
   even in mobas fights have to last . 
  of course there are times when a fight breaks out and it ends almost instantly but majority of fights and especially team fights ca n't have too short a ttk and thankfully they do n't . 
  if it always ended instantly it would n't be fun to watch and it would be very little skill based . 
  again , you 're just stating this with no evidence and it 's not true . 
  go look at a fight in dota . 
  immense skill , short ttk . 
  heck , go look at cs , where you can kill someone from full health and armour * instantly * . 
  more skill there than in every mmorpg put together . 
   in regular mmorgps it 's a sign of a poor balance when you can 100-0 another , evenly geared , player down . 
  because that 's not standard , because those games have defensive abilities that are far too powerful . 
  nobody is saying that everyone should be all burst all the time . 
  but the ability to burst should be present . 
  do n't be absurd . 
  thank you , ** someone ** has actually answered the question . 
  what is with you people in these threads ? 
  any time anyone asks a question , the response is ` go play mobas lol ' . 
  runescape items are n't worth any amount of real money . 
  every other mmorpg ever is unplayable garbage . 
  scaling is not great . 
  scaling takes away player choice . 
  scaling is a sticking plaster for zone-based world design ( i.e. 
  bad world design ) . 
  it 's not a good idea , no new mmo should have it , but it works better than wow-style zones with specific level ranges and stupid crap like that . 
  but you get identical combat with different walls of text in mmos like wow anyway , the difference is that before you either :, 
  * always outlevelled zones and had to choose between completing the quests and getting good xp , you could n't get both , or, 
  * always underlevelled zones and had to grind to get to the next one or die constantly trying to go to the next zone which is too high level for you . 
  it 's impossible to balance perfectly . 
  the solution is actually pretty good , everything is the appropriate challenge , although unfortunately blizzard thinks ` the appropriate challenge ' is ` easy mode ' , so the entirety of legion is too easy and you ca n't go to a higher level zone to get a bit of challenge . 
  the real solution is not to have zones with level ranges at all , nor to just scale everything to your level . 
  scaling to your level is a bandaid to fix wow-style zones . 
  the real solution is a living , breathing , sandbox world . 
  zones do n't have level ranges , zones do n't exist . 
  the entire world is open , it 's seamless . 
  the starting area ( or areas ) might be a little castle with some rats and frogs and cows to kill , but if you go into the castle dungeon there are high level monsters there too . 
  this goes on . 
  a dungeon might have some level 17 skeletons at the front , but it has level 33 and 38 hobgoblins further in and level 40 and 42 zombies on the second level , etc. 
  i think scaling is much better than wow-style zones . 
  i just think it 's also much worse than anything better than wow-style zones , which is * everything * that is n't wow-style zones . 
  it just looks so fucking awful . 
  it does n't have any of the good things about uo . 
  everything about it screams world of warcraft . 
   because if the ttk of a duel can be lowered to the point where someone can be killed within `` one strong cc '' ( aka within 5 seconds ) you basically just got instagibbed anyway . 
  for a start , you 're clearly in a shitty , shitty position and you need to learn to play if you get stunlocked and killed in dota . 
  either that or they wasted multiple ultimates on killing one person and now ca n't deal with the rest of your team . 
  so either it 's entirely your fault and you should learn to play , ** or ** it 's fine because you 'll win the fight anyway . 
  if their team uses all their disables on one guy and ` effectively instagibs ' him , then do n't lose to the rest of the guy 's team , his team was never going to win . 
   look . 
  op is asking for something that is realistically impossible from design point of view and he is probably one of the only peoples that even desire something like this . 
  says someone that has never played any moba ever , clearly . 
  mate , there 's a reason that mobas are more popular than mmos today . 
  it 's not because they 're cheaper , they 're not . 
  it 's not because they 're more beautiful , they 're not . 
  it 's because their pvp is actually well-designed and balanced . 
   who the fuck actually enjoys a duel that lasts only a few seconds ? 
  the 906k people that played dota 2 in the last 24 hours ? 
  sorry that your crappy pvp games do n't even have that many players in a year . 
  it 's quite simple . 
  the post implies that he 's only thinking about combat progression . 
  that is a mistake !, 
  you ca n't separate combat and non-combat progression . 
  you ca n't think about combat progression just on its own , as its own thing . 
  well it legally must be . 
  it 's derived from gpl-licensed code . 
  lol generally has weak cc and less powerful abilities that are used more often . 
  i thought it had slower ttk than dota ? 
   another argument however is that mobas are n't really a `` 1v1 '' game . 
  neither are mmos . 
  or rather , they should n't be . 
  pvp in mmos that is balanced around 1v1 tends to be really boring in groups and defensive moves become too powerful , imo . 
  no , those are mmorpg standards of * excellence * . 
  in other parts of the games industries , these are all just requirements for being even considered close to aaa . 
  you 've got to have fun , you 've got to have good aesthetics and good graphics , you 're never allowed to have a purchase and cash shop , you 've got to have unique and interesting gameplay . 
  in an mmorpg , these make the game literally the best mmorpg ever . 
  they are all present in regular games all the time . 
  blizzard do n't have to budge . 
  it has nothing to do with blizzard . 
  nostalrius is the only private server in history to actually listen to a c&d . 
   how is using blizzard 's game to run private vanilla servers not illegal and piracy ? 
  because it 's neither illegal nor piracy . 
  it 's not copyright infringement , so it 's not illegal . 
   and do people justify playing it by saying they would pay for it if blizzard offered the option ? 
  they do n't . 
   i do n't see how this is anything other than people who believe they are entitled to something for nothing .
