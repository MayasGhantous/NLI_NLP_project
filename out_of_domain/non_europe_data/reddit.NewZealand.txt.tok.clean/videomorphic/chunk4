   because it 's hard to argue that coco has n't had a negative effect on the standard meta . 
  i disagree . 
  it has been overwhelmingly positive . 
  the idiotic etb effects they print are the problem . 
  it would remove a huge , huge part of what makes magic interesting , which is graveyard strategies . 
  you 're essentially suggesting that creatures get exiled on death . 
   was `` creatures are unplayable , blue is the obvious best colour '' 1990 's magic balanced ? 
  magic has essentially never been like this . 
  creature-based strategies have basically always been viable in standard . 
  counterspell does n't stop creatures from being viable . 
   `` it 's not the gun , it 's the bullets '', 
  collected company is a balanced card . 
  the cards it was bringing in were n't balanced with or without it . 
  and the game was worse . 
  and that would make the game worse . 
  being able to resurrect creatures you discarded is an important part of magic . 
  they are both completely true . 
  you are an idiot of the highest order . 
   well , this is true . 
  but having a high density of powerful efficient threats does make pure draw-go a lot weaker . 
  the old draw-go decks used to take advantage of the fact that most threats were n't actually that threatening until you got the synergy going . 
  so they basically ignored half the deck . 
  ca n't do that now the threats are balanced . 
  threats are n't balanced . 
  you certainly should need synergy . 
  and no they did n't ` ignore half the deck ' . 
  you ran lots of kill spells . 
   there was a long period where creatures were basically unplayable , because the answers were so efficient that you simply could n't easily succeed . 
  you were encouraged heavily to stop playing creatures , or to go for what was effectively a combo deck that happened to run some creatures . 
  you 're completely wrong . 
  you 're just utterly and completely misguided and wrong . 
  there was one standard where you were forced to play a combo deck . 
  it was called combo winter . 
  it was fucking unusual . 
  the obnoxious siege rhino decks were *** way *** more dominant , they just artificially broke them up and pretended there were 3 variants so it was less noticeable . 
  how has nobody said ** blue control ** ? 
  you constantly claim in your videos that you would n't want to spend that much money to play a tier 1 modern deck though . 
  jeskai nahiri is not a control deck . 
  and u tron is unplayable , unfortunately . 
  and it is n't really control either . 
   i think this statement is extremely short-sighted , modern ebbs and flows all the time, 
  it 's far from short-sighted . 
  it 's been true for ** years ** . 
  modern had plenty of phases of being incredibly linear when twin was around . 
   sure , but there were multiple standards where you would just play control or combo or controlling midrange . 
  that was n't unusual . 
  all of which play creatures . 
  there being a few standards where most decks play creatures but few are entirely reliant on creatures is a good thing . 
  there being a huge long string of formats where every single deck is entirely reliant on creatures to win ? 
  that 's bad . 
   and yes , you ran some kill spells . 
  but you ran less than you 'd need to nowadays because about 10-20 % of the creatures could be safely ignored for 3-4 turns . 
  you had way more time to just ignore what your opponent was doing and set yourself up . 
  people had much better kill spells then . 
  now we have shit kill spells , bad countermagic , bad card draw , and creatures that are beyond power creep and well into just being absurdly overpowered . 
  planeswalkers were the worst addition to the game , ruining control decks forever by being absurdly strong on average ( as mythics ) and sorcery-speed . 
  nowadays you have time to just ignore your opponent because you just slam threats . 
  in the past you had to interact . 
  that does n't mean there is n't a best deck . 
  people will pussyfoot around and claim that it 's wide open meta . 
  whether or not that 's true , miracles has consistently been the best deck for * years * . 
  miracles is * objectively * the best deck . 
  that does n't mean anyone is coming for your sensei 's top . 
  they 're all fun and they 're all competitive . 
  miracles is objectively the best deck . 
  i do n't enjoy it at all . 
  but it 's the best . 
   i primarily think it would eliminate the cheating things out of the graveyard and such . 
  that 's what i said . 
  i shortened it to ` worse ' because that is the end result : a game where you can do fewer interesting things . 
  basically the entirety of the format 's history . 
  best does n't mean ` most fun ' or ` cleverest ' or any of that . 
  you can debate what 's the most fun . 
  miracles has been quite objectively , the most long-term consistently best deck for ages now , unfortunately . 
  nothing that costs 3 mana is going to make defensive decks great again . 
  daze certainly does n't see ` very limited play ' in legacy . 
  it sees a lot of play in the right decks : tempo decks . 
   3 wasteland strangler, 
  4 thought-knot seer, 
  4 reality smasher, 
  he said fair, 
  pros : everything, 
  cons : nothing, 
  8 rack is not a good deck . 
  it was n't a ` conspiracy theory ' . 
  it 's * literally * the reason they did it . 
  they 've said this * multiple times * . 
  lodestone is n't restricted because shops are $ 800 each . 
  lodestone is restricted because shops is an important part of the meta and if workshops was restricted the deck would instantly be dead and the meta would be literally 100 % blue decks . 
  that 's not what they want . 
  they actually know how to manage vintage , unlike modern . 
  yes , you actually play mtg . 
  go play hearthstone if you want linear uninteractive idiocy . 
  twin is n't a control deck . 
  twin has never been a control deck . 
  the format was never ` play control = play twin or do n't play control . ', 
  however , now it 's literally just do n't play control at all . 
   there will be no point to playing anything running urx without twin . 
  that was n't even true before it was banned . 
   we go back to square one , with twin not having as tough of a time against tron .
