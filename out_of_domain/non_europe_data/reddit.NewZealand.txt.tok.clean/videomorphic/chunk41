  users are n't afraid of visiting a web site . 
  they know it 's safe and they can opt-in before providing any content they do n't want . 
  javascript is * not * secure or locked down . 
  there 's a reason people disable it . 
  using camel case for classes is objectively incorrect in c++ . 
  you know what 's shorter than both and better than both ? 
  not using any prefixes or suffixes at all . 
  holy shit you have cancer . 
  you must be incredibly bad at writing code if you do n't just automatically write the spaces in the right place . 
  the correct style is this :, 
  cool : : cool ( int a , int b ) : a ( a ) , b ( b ) { }, 
  it 's never , ever correct to prefix ` m _ ` to variable names . 
  that code is illegal . 
  if you declare something ` const ` then it * must * be thread-safe . 
  c++ moves are much better-designed than rust 's moves . 
   edit : no , we 're not being brigades by r/rust . 
  chill with the reports and pms . 
  yes we fucking are . 
  this is unidiomatic c++ . 
  you should write a free function that takes standard ` std : : chrono ` objects . 
  after ( 20ms , [ ] { cout < < `` hello , world !, 
  that 's not legal c++ , they stupidly removed that style of declaration . 
  it really was much better . 
   but neither should religion be used to take secular public spaces and turn them into segregated religious and cultural safe spaces ... 
  exactly , that 's why there should be no women-only times at pools just to placate muslims . 
   if they are used as pathways to integration , sure , but if it enforces the idea that these beliefs can be used in all secular areas of life to create religious safe zones - then thats a slope to be resisted . 
  ` pathway to integration ' is a fucking joke , honestly . 
  anyone that seriously thinks that segregation is * ever * a pathway to integration is a fool . 
  the only way to integrate is for people to stop being tied down by their stupid religions . 
  no , they do n't . 
  corporate lawyers do , and they 're precisely the people we * do n't * want as judges . 
  exactly , corporate lawyers are precisely the wrong people we want as judges . 
  also the difference in hours worked between judges and corporate lawyers is ** immense ** . 
  yes , it does ruin my concentration . 
  just learn how to not be shit . 
  there 's a very well-known talk by herb sutter on this . 
  does n't matter . 
  public pool , public space . 
  not allowing residency based on * attitude * is not incompatible with nz culture . 
  it 's not about being muslim . 
  it already does . 
  a public pool that 's always open to everyone * is * inclusive of them . 
  getters and setters are an antipattern . 
   you think residency should be tied to religious belief . 
  i do n't think you are very compatible with nz culture . 
  no , i do n't . 
  learn to read . 
  i did n't say anything about belief . 
  i said that if * your religion prevents you * from doing something that 's a normal part of nz culture then you should not be able to become a resident . 
  that has nothing to do with religion . 
  many muslims are completely fine going to a swimming pool . 
   you are aware that this is n't a law being passed , to make every swimming pool have a woman 's only night ? 
  nobody said it was . 
   it is a single introducing a program to reach more of its community . 
  it 's a single programme to * exclude * more of its community . 
   nobody has to do anything . 
  nobody is being forced to do anything here . 
  men ** have ** to stay away from the pool . 
   it is a pool making a personal decision on how to best use its resources . 
  no it is not . 
  it 's a ** publicly run ** and ** publicly funded ** pool making a ** public decision ** on how to use ** the community 's ** resources . 
  new zealand is a secular country . 
  we do n't have a state religion , and our government does * not * make decisions to favour one religion over another . 
  except that now , apparently , we do . 
  that 's shit . 
  this programme is illegal under new zealand law . 
  it discriminates against men . 
  that 's illegal . 
  with or without this programme , everyone can learn to swim . 
  muslim people do ** not ** require this programme to learn to swim . 
  muslim people ** want ** this programme , but they do not ** need ** it . 
   still restricted . 
  and that 's fine . 
  if people want to restrict themselves they 're perfectly at liberty to do so . 
  they do n't have the right to restrict ** others ** , though . 
  that 's the difference . 
   do you think these people invented all of their cultural norms and dispositions by themselves ? 
  yes , they did . 
  they choose to restrict themselves . 
  they might think that this has something to do with religion , but it does n't . 
  it 's entirely cultural . 
   edit : also , not everyone who goes to this is muslim . 
  it exists for religious purposes . 
   no it is n't . 
  yes it fucking is . 
  segregation is ** literally always bad ** . 
  it always has been and always will be . 
   the goodness or badness of things depends on the context . 
  do you have an explanation for why this is bad , other than `` segregation is bad . '', 
  the goodness and badness of segregation does not . 
  segregation is ** always ** bad . 
   this is n't the dominant group saying `` segregation is good for the minority group . '', 
  it is the minority group enjoying the benefits of a system which you happen to refer to as segregation . 
  it 's segregation by definition . 
   accommodation is not discrimination, 
  yes it is . 
  it absolutely is discrimination . 
  it 's discrimination against any men that want to go on that particular day . 
  many people are busy most days of the week and would like to go to the pool on that day . 
  they now can not , because of an illegal discriminatory practice .
