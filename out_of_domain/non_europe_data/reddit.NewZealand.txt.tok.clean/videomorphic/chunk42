   they would be disadvantaged if this program did n't exist , because they would n't be able to learn to swim . 
  yes they fucking would be able to learn to swim . 
  they could go to the pool and sign up for lessons . 
  they could n't go to the pool and sign up for lessons * and be guaranteed that no men are present * , but i ca n't go to the pool and sign up for lessons and be guaranteed that no muslims are present , even if i wanted to ( which i do n't ) . 
  they might ** choose ** not to learn to swim , but that 's their decision . 
  they can choose not to learn to swim with or without the programme . 
  what they ca n't do , legally , is insist that discriminatory programmes be introduced so they feel more comfortable . 
  if they choose not to swim because men are around , that 's their own stupid problem . 
  their idiotic beliefs ( and they are , objectively , false ) cause them to make stupid decisions that lead to them being less safe in the water . 
  that 's nobody 's problem but themselves . 
  lol good luck being a software developer in the real world if you are so unbelievably retarded that you do n't know how to write code in a clean way without putting effort into it . 
  you probably do n't even touch type . 
  what a waste of space . 
  there 's no irony . 
  new zealanders . 
   saying that they are here stealing jobs shows we have n't made any progress over the last 150 years :, 
  they * are * here stealing jobs . 
  companies that do n't want to raise their wages to attract employees lobby the government to put those jobs on fake ` skill shortage ' lists . 
  then it 's much easier to import indians and chinese from overseas to take the jobs . 
  nobody ` graduates ' high school in new zealand . 
  go back to watching your shitty american high school movies . 
  china 's involvement was pretty much irrelevant outside of china , though . 
  china fought japan , but they had essentially zero involvement outside of china . 
  that 's why nobody cares about china 's involvement . 
   apple conducts very little economic activity here . 
  all they basically do is ship their products in and pass them on to supplies . 
  false . 
  apple conducts an enormous amount of economic activity in new zealand . 
  their adverts are on tv * all the time * , they sell lots of products here , they sell lots of itunes tracks and apps on their app store . 
  all of that activity should be taxes , and all the profits should be taxed too . 
  no , the existing taxes on company profits should be applied to all profits generated from revenue generated in new zealand . 
  do n't be a troll . 
  i 'm talking about asian immigrants on work visas that come here based on the lies and fabrications of businesses that falsely claim there are skills shortages when they just do n't want to raise wages . 
  it 's not called graduating . 
  you finish high school . 
  you complete high school . 
  you do n't ` graduate ' high school . 
  top crown prosecutors and defence lawyers ? 
  yes . 
  not the same thing , at all , as corporate lawyers . 
   so , you are against them closing off the teaching pool for all the other types of lesson they hold there too . 
  not if they 're non-discriminatory . 
  obviously . 
  closing a lane in a pool to do swimming lessons and closing the entire pool to one gender to satisfy the whims of muslim women are entirely different things . 
   how do you feel about town halls and other public buildings being closed to the public when they are booked by clubs and groups ? 
  i think many people would be upset if the government sold off public spaces for the benefit of fringe religious groups . 
   if you ca n't compete with an immigrant on a working visa with poor english , you are doing something wrong . 
  i can compete fine . 
  the fact is that their presence in the industry lowers wages . 
  that 's basic supply and demand . 
   either you do n't want to work minimum wage , or you 're just not a good worker . 
  who said anything about minimum wage ? 
  i 'm talking about software development primarily . 
  skill shortage areas . 
   unless you 're a complete fucking drop kick , any kiwi employer would prefer to hire a kiwi over an immigrant if you 're both willing to work for the same price . 
  the fact of the matter is that there are n't enough nz software graduates * that are willing to stay around in new zealand * , ** because the wages are abysmal ** . 
  the solution to that is not open immigration , heaps of extra points on visa applications and skills shortage lists . 
  the solution is supply and demand : businesses raising their wages to compete for labour . 
   secondly , the article in question is about a kiwi born citizen . 
  op brought up asians ` taking jobs ' when we 're talking about an asian literally born in this country . 
  the problem with people like you , the ones who get pissy about asian immigrants ` stealing your jerbs ' , is that none of you can ever distinguish between a kiwi citizen and an asian immigrant . 
  for you , every asian you see on the street is part of the problem . 
  it becomes far more about straight racism than about immigration . 
  that 's the issue with your rhetoric . 
  second generation immigrants are no less to blame than first generation immigrants . 
  no , it 's what americans call finishing high school . 
  it 's objective fact that the standard ** requires ** that any ` const ` function ( there 's no such thing as a ` method ' in c++ , so i assume you mean ` member function ' , but there 's nothing special about member functions in this discussion , so just say ` function ' as you 're meant to please ) that you use with the standard library is thread-safe . 
  that 's a requirement of the standard . 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  nobody in new zealand graduates high school . 
  completing high school ? 
  yep . 
  finishing high school ? 
  yep . 
  but there 's no ` high school graduation ' . 
  that 's a shitty americanism and like all americanisms it should be excised from the new zealand language . 
  that has nothing to do with hager . 
  the media decides what effect things have on the public . 
  if the media says ` people do n't think it is having any real effect on voters ' then it wo n't have any effect on voters . 
  the media decides the public opinion in nz on ** everything ** and have done so for years . 
  trying to use socialist as a slur in new zealand of all places is pretty fucking hilarious . 
  it 's not about motivating people . 
  it 's about giving people a chance to actually do work with others at the same level . 
  again , not sure why i have to say this again , but this is only about const functions that * are used with the standard library * . 
  https://herbsutter.com/2013/05/22/gotw-6a-const-correctness-part-1/ ( in which he explains it in text very briefly ), 
  https://codecraft.co/2013/01/02/how-sutters-wrong-about-const-in-cpp-11/ ( which explains why he oversimplified in the last slide , but actually does n't claim he 's wrong , because he is n't ), 
  https://isocpp.org/blog/2012/12/you-dont-know-const-and-mutable-herb-sutter ( the video ), 
  that 's true , but it 's still poor practice . 
  because you claimed that people take a pay cut to become a judge . 
  if you take into account hours worked then only the * very very * top couple of qcs and corporate lawyers make more than judges . 
  are you denying it 's true ? 
  they are still contributing to the asianification of our culture and economy . 
  well you 're wrong . 
  it 's not simplistic , it 's a complex interaction between spin , the media and simple inertia of public thought . 
  labour is n't doing well for several reasons . 
  part of it is that the media have established in peoples ' minds that its leadership is ` useless ' and ` boring ' , even when they objectively are n't . 
  part of it is inertia . 
  part of it is spin from the nats . 
  but it 's a two-way street . 
  similarly there 's this established narrative in the media , quite an anti-intellectual one i have to say , that bill english is ` boring ' .
