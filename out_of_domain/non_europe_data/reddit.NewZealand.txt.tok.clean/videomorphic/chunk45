  the only reason you bring that up is to emotionally blackmail anyone reading this into agreeing with you . 
   to be forced to join an organisation and perform actions that was anathema to your moral code is truly repugnant . 
  if your moral code is `` taxes are wrong '' , is it `` truly repugnant '' to force people to pay taxes ? 
  of course it is n't . 
  there 's no difference here at all . 
   now in the case of sbw , this is a different kettle of fish . 
  he is actively protesting against something that is inherent to his beliefs ( ie banks charging interest ) . 
  personally i do not have an issue with it , because bnz does not sponsor him personally ( which would be his choice ) , they sponsor the club ( not his choice ) . 
  he actually has no real justification for avoiding interest . 
  he almost certainly does n't know why he 's opposed to interest , he just has been convinced that islam is correct ( despite it being objectively , scientifically incorrect - i know this is n't a popular opinion , but abrahamic religions are ** objectively ** full of falsehoods ) and has been told that he should be against interest . 
  if sbw does n't want to have a bank logo on his jersey , he should not wear a jersey that has a bank logo on it . 
  he can either come to an agreement with the idiots at the nzrfu to remove them from the jersey , or he can not play as part of the team . 
  simple as that . 
  you ca n't just pick and choose what you like and do n't like , which rules you do and do n't want to follow , then just say ` it 's my religion/moral code/whatever ' . 
  that 's not acceptable . 
  we do n't pick and choose which laws to follow or which rules to adhere to . 
   i would ask you , if it had been a united airlines sponsorship logo that he had covered up , would you have been okay with it ? 
  i would because it is about allowing that freedom of choice and the right to protest . 
  i do n't care at all about which logos he covers up on his stupid uniform . 
  if he wants to cover up the logos that 's his business , but it is ** not ** conscientious objection . 
  it 's just objection . 
  it has nothing to do with his conscience and everything to do with his ( misogynistic , outdated and militaristic ) choice of religion . 
  i have no idea why you would be ` fine with it ' . 
  ` freedom of choice ' ? 
  he 's perfectly free to choose not to sign a contract that involves him advertising a company he disagrees with . 
  that 's his freedom of choice . 
  freedom of choice is not freedom to pick and choose what you want to follow and what agreements you have made you want to renege on . 
  that 's not freedom of choice , that 's just pathetic . 
  it certainly does n't have anything to do with ` right to protest ' either . 
  he 's not protesting anything . 
  he 's just breaching his contract , breaking an agreement he has signed . 
  i certainly would never be interested in entering into an agreement with him , or anyone that shares his beliefs , if that 's how he treats contracts : something he think he can just ignore because #islam . 
  the problem i have with the car parks in the central city is that i do n't want to park anywhere , all i want to do is pick up somebody that works in the ballentynes building . 
  but there 's never anywhere that i can pick them up . 
  it 's a daily nightmare . 
  there are too few pick up and drop off spaces . 
  the very few that do exist are impossible to get into or out of . 
  they are so short and sharp that you have to drive over the curb to get into them . 
  you ca n't just stop in the middle of the road . 
  i refuse to pay wilsons parking to park somewhere for 3 minutes so someone can walk over and get into the car . 
  yeah it sure is andrew little 's fault he was sued by a national party donor in election year . 
  that 's definitely his fault !, 
  you dolt, 
   labour just seems incapable of creating an image of hope . 
  maybe that 's because every single time they 're mentioned by any form of media in this country , the media paints them in a negative light ? 
   everytime any labour candidate gets a microphone in front of them they should be talking about the better future and life for all new zealanders if they were in power . 
  they have a huge list of policies and they talk about them at every opportunity . 
  i have no idea what you 're on about honestly . 
   instead it feels like every opportunity is used to attack one of the most popular governments in new zealand history . 
  i do n't understand it !, 
  they 're the official opposition . 
  andrew little is the leader of the opposition . 
  their constitutional role is to hold the government to account . 
  their day to day job is to hold the government to account . 
  i do n't know what about that is hard for you to understand . 
  they are n't `` attacking '' the national government , they are holding them to account . 
   their uncharismatic leaders, 
  i wonder what might cause that view . 
  it might be all the `` media commentators '' writing articles like `` media commentators think that andrew little sucks lol '' . 
  it 's not like that 's self-fulfilling or anything . 
   and constant bitching instead of offering alternatives, 
  i think you might actually be literally retarded . 
  they ** literally always ** offer alternatives , and their ** primary constitutional role ** is to hold the government to account . 
  jesus christ the total lack of constitutional understanding in this country is appalling . 
  it 's not a failure . 
  you 're making the mistake of assuming this is some terrible thing that has just happened by chance . 
  it 's deliberate . 
  the media has absolutely no interest in political change . 
  they are n't interested in educating the public . 
  all the media wants is to keep the status quo . 
  it 's not free . 
  that 's moronic . 
  you have a moral obligation to defend your country . 
   oh fuck off you enlightened 14 year old . 
  i 'm 21 , but whatever . 
   yes , bitch , bitch away , but do n't just bitch . 
  perfect example being the legalisation of abortion in this country and yet no parties are offering up a bill to to anything about it . 
  labour is n't `` bitching '' about abortion . 
  labour have n't said anything about abortion . 
  how is this `` bitching '' ? 
  it 's reddit that 's bitching about abortion , not labour . 
  no parties are offering up a bill to do anything about it , except for the members bill that has been submitted to legalise it , you mean . 
  labour ca n't just put laws into parliament and get them voted on . 
  they have to be submitted as members bills by individual mps , and then a certain random selection of these are submitted for parliamentary consideration . 
   and have you fucking seen most politicains ? 
  many have no understanding of the internet beyond what they get their intern to put out on twitter and their interviews are both humourless and out of touch . 
  that has nothing to do with labour , though . 
  and of course they 're fucking humourless , they 're not comedians . 
  they 're not entertainers . 
  they have serious work to do . 
  they deal every day with really serious things that are n't funny . 
  if they tried to make things ` fun ' or whatever the fuck you want , you 'd complain they were n't serious . 
   there are some great ones out there , that actually show that they give a shit about anyone other than married baby boomers , andi think the promoting of jacinda adern is labour realising this, 
  you 're retarded . 
  you 're just complaining about politics in general in a ** completely ** ignorant way . 
  none of what you say has anything to do with labour . 
  honestly you seem like a 14-year-old . 
  oh come on do n't be so fucking intellectually dishonest . 
  nobody is being ` kidnapped ' . 
  being drafted is not being kidnapped .
