  being drafted is not being ` forced to work for ' anyone . 
  being drafted is being legally compelled to enter military service for your nation . 
  that 's not kidnapping . 
  if you earn income , you are ** forced ** to give a portion of ** your hard-earned income ** to the government . 
  some people ( not me ) view that as essentially what you seem to view the draft as : slavery . 
  being forced to work for the benefit of the government . 
  of course we both know that that is not at all what taxes are , yet you seem to still stupidly think that the draft is slavery . 
  at least people that view taxes and the draft as slavery are consistent . 
   get their dick sucked, 
  you forgot `` by someone with herpes and having to pay for it '', 
   christ , just go into any news site and search `` abortion '' `` labour '' and you can see plenty . 
  so what you 're saying is that you do n't actually have any evidence . 
   my point is that no members have put through bills to do exactly what i said . 
  rubbish . 
  gordon chadwick proposed a members bill to legalise abortion in 2010 . 
  the reality is that the prime minister has stated firmly that he has no interest in liberalising abortion law in new zealand , and that the labour leadership has committed to reviewing nz 's abortion laws if they win the election . 
  what more do you want ? 
   people can have a sense of houmour and still be excellent at their job , in also means they are probably more in touch with , you know , reality than your usual rich old dude who thinks that the housing market is fine and young people just need to save . 
  politics is serious business . 
  there 's no room , in the electorate 's view , for fun and games . 
  peoples ' lives and livelihoods are on the line , and treating it all as fun and games shows a lack of respect for those lives and livelihoods . 
  people are perfectly capable of having a laugh , just look at backbenchers . 
  but you seem to want people to be making jokes while announcing policies or something . 
  that 's just silly . 
  i 'm sorry that you 're basically a teenager and you ca n't fathom the idea that there are times and places where it 's inappropriate to make jokes , but that 's reality . 
  nobody in the labour caucus is a ` rich old dude who thinks that the housing market is fine ' . 
  the labour party has strong policies to deal with both the supply-side and demand-side of the housing crises in new zealand . 
  the labour party is united by that . 
   oh ... you are an mra . 
  i 'm done here . 
  i do n't know what that is . 
  i do n't care if you * think * you do or not . 
  if new zealand were attacked , you would have a moral obligation to defend it . 
  nobody is talking about ` killing people purely because they were n't born near [ you ] ' . 
  stop making such stupid reductionist arguments . 
  we 're talking about * defending new zealand against her enemies * . 
  and new zealand is lucky enough not to be at risk of invasion or attack . 
  but if we were , you are really telling me you 'd rather we were under the yoke of china or japan than free and independent , and you would make no effort to defend new zealand ? 
  if so , you are a worthless cancer in our society . 
  hey , just general advice : a good rule of thumb for life is to assume that other people are acting in good faith . 
  in my experience , people flash their lights at you if yours are on because on most cars , until * very * recently , there was no indication that you left your lights on when you turned the car off . 
  so it was very easy for people to leave their lights on without realising it , wasting their battery . 
  you should also be careful that you do n't have your lights on full . 
  even during the day this can be blinding !, 
  what a silly comment . 
  of course headlights are there for me to see other people , and the road , and many other things . 
  they serve a dual purpose . 
  well it was n't free last week . 
  they 've been doing some odd things with that carpark . 
  when it first opened it was free and had none of the equipment , barriers , ticket booths , etc. 
  then they closed it again to put all that stuff in . 
  if it 's 2 hours free at the moment that will , almost certainly , be temporary . 
  and it 's hardly the point . 
  picking someone up on colombo street should not require me to park in a multi-story carpark . 
  there should be sufficient pickup/dropoff spots along the road . 
  the police should not have the discretion that they do . 
  the end result is that they use that discretion in very racist and sexist ways . 
  the police let many white people off for possession , but not as many maori . 
  same with domestic violence : very lenient on women , very harsh on men . 
  the ` universe ' did n't conspire against him . 
  the national party donor and the national party conspired against him . 
  he said , quite rightly , that a national party donor donated to the national party and then was awarded a contract , and that this was very fishy and suspect . 
  quite frankly that he is n't protected by parliamentary privilege in making this claim is absurd , we ca n't have party donors suing the leader of the opposition for making political statements about the party they support . 
   of course national party supporters are jumping at the opportunity ( though you could argue they feel strongly about their reputations too ) . 
  but that is politics , you do n't give your opposition ammunition . 
  the idea that criticising the government for what are , quite frankly , very dodgy deals is `` giving your opposition ammunition '' is bizarre . 
  what should he do ? 
  not criticise ** blatant corruption ** ? 
  swing voters are swinging towards labour and away from national , if you look at the polls rather than pontificating . 
  holy christ are you dense or what . 
  i never said that taxation was slavery . 
  learn to fucking read . 
  what i am saying is that ** you ** are creating a false equivalency between slavery and the draft . 
  the draft is ** not ** slavery . 
  you are falsely equivocating them . 
  conscription is not slavery . 
  neither is taxation . 
  yet there are stupid people that think taxation is slavery , and there are stupid people that think conscription is slavery . 
  the people that think taxation is slavery should not be pandered to and made exempt , and neither should the stupid people that think conscription is slavery . 
  both are wrong . 
  ** that ** is my point . 
   taxes are not slavery !!!, 
  you are not being forced to work , or forced to earn an income . 
  if you want to live in the bush and live off the land , the government will not hunt you down and force you to go to work . 
  if you earn income and do not pay tax you are breaking the law , whether the government pursues you for doing so or not . 
   conscription is slavery , and slavery is kidnapping because you are taken against your will and forced to work for a master ( ie military ) regardless of any laws making it legal . 
  remember slavery was legal not that long ago . 
  slavery has never been legal in new zealand , unless you count maori enslaving maori pre-colonially . 
  the point you seem to be missing is that labour has ** literally zero control whatsoever over their image ** . 
  labour ** can not ** just wave a magic wand and create an image . 
  labour can certainly do things that make their image worse , but they can not just improve it at a drop of a hat . 
  their image is created and decided by the media . 
  if you have a problem with labour 's image , blame mediaworks . 
  the media have been systematically presenting labour as incompetent for years . 
  i have n't seen a single article in the last 10 years about how incredibly incompetent simon bridges and nick smith are , for example , while every single time anyone in labour says anything the title of the article is `` media commentators think that labour is shit '' . 
  it does n't bloody matter whether the auditor-general found a connection . 
  the simple reality is that he made a donation and then was awarded a contract . 
  that 's corruption . 
  it 's * physically impossible * for there to be no connection . 
  nobody that has donated to the ruling party should be eligible for government contracts , ** ever ** .
