  twin was already great against tron . 
  there 's currently no reason to play urx at all . 
  if they unbanned twin and there was suddenly a reason to play urx , but only if you played twin , that would be a bad thing why ? 
  twin forced you to actually be interactive and not tap out every turn like this is standard or something . 
  it made you play magic . 
  that 's idiotic . 
  the deck was n't even the most played fair deck when it was banned . 
  modern is a far cry from legacy , mate . 
  people certainly do n't play as many 1-drops in this format . 
  yeah actually all of those should be unbanned . 
  people have been complaining about modern being too linear for years . 
  it 's true . 
  since pod 's banning it 's been particularly bad . 
   tempo is the most meaningless term for a deck in magic 's history, 
  okay so is rug delver a control deck then ? 
   ur delver in legacy is just an aggro deck . 
  yeah , i 'd say that 's pretty accurate . 
   grixis or sultai delver, 
  bug , not ` sultai ' you buffoon . 
  and yes they 're aggro-control . 
  at least bug is . 
  grixis is hard to place . 
  rug delver is a tempo deck . 
  and aggro-control is ** completely ** different from aggro . 
  utterly utterly different . 
   how would a color like green fit in as a fair deck ? 
  and what would any one play fair black for other than discard ? 
  or red other than a ( nearly ) pure burn deck ? 
  you just listed the three colours in jund , ** the main fair deck in modern ** . 
  preordain is mostly used by combo decks in legacy because fair decks already have brainstorm and ponder and do n't want to play more than 8 of those effects . 
  but it would be used like brainstorm in legacy : by both fair and unfair decks . 
  serum visions would be the card you play * as well * if you want extra consistency , like preordain is in legacy . 
  also , what modern needs * more * is `` uninteractive combo '' ( which is actually much more interactive than the linear aggro decks we have now ) . 
  more amulet bloom . 
  less infect . 
  the whole reason why the game is interesting is that different choices have tradeoffs . 
  eldrazi have eldrazi temple and eye of ugin , while other tribes have good cards to actually cast with your mana . 
  also elves have gaea 's cradle , which is much better than a sol land . 
  but it still sees lots of play . 
  sure if you could use it to cast any creatures it would have been banned in every format years ago , but pointing out that it has a downside that means you can only really use it in tribal decks does n't change the fact that * currently it 's probably a bit too strong in tribal decks * . 
  yeah you can . 
  and that 's right . 
  and twin should n't have been banned . 
  you ca n't win with you people . 
  if he has 200 matches with jund he 's biased . 
  if he does n't , he 's inexperienced and not to be listened to . 
  personally i much prefer playing with simpler cards like counterspell and remand than with stuff like kolaghan 's command . 
  a few of them is okay , but too many of them would give people too many options i think . 
  bloodbraid elf is utter trash in legacy . 
  become immense is nowhere near bannable . 
  that 's just stupid . 
  why would they ban three irrelevant cards ? 
  lol no . 
  they 're the reason the format is good . 
  legacy without brainstorm would be like modern without lightning bolt or like vintage without force of will . 
  it would just be stupid . 
  force of will is both overestimated and underestimated . 
  it 's actually an extremely good tempo card , it 's very good at defending against combo decks and it 's also okay ( but not great ) at defending your own combos . 
   secondly , saying control is barely an archetype in modern ? 
  that 's outrageous . 
  control is barely an archetype in moderncontrol is barely an archetype in moderncontrol is barely an archetype in moderncontrol is barely an archetype in moderncontrol is barely an archetype in moderncontrol is barely an archetype in moderncontrol is barely an archetype in moderncontrol is barely an archetype in moderncontrol is barely an archetype in moderncontrol is barely an archetype in moderncontrol is barely an archetype in moderncontrol is barely an archetype in modern, 
   what if we unbanned splinter twin , and also banned deceiver exarch ? 
  what if we unbanned splinter twin and also did n't ban deceiver exarch . 
  what is ` princessly sum ' meant to mean ? 
  did you mean to imply that it 's cheaper than a princely sum ? 
  that 's fairly sexist . 
  quite the opposite . 
  modern would be a better format if it had all the cards in legacy in it . 
  alas , wotc are incompetent . 
   some people like playing decks that are n't blue, 
  they should probably play legacy then , because it has lots of them and unlike modern , they come in a variety and diversity of strategies !, 
   and formats without free counterspells . 
  that 's just stupid . 
  what an arbitrary and stupid thing to dislike a format for . 
   regardless , this is r/modernmagic , so gaea 's cradle is completely irrelevant . 
  no it is n't . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  have n't been popular in years ? 
  tempo decks have been popular * for * years . 
  years and years and years . 
  what kind of weird world are you living in where rug delver is the only tempo deck in legacy , or the only deck that plays daze ?

  daze . 
  all four of those are on the front page of mtggoldfish , which means in the top 14 most played decks in the current meta . 
  in no universe are those all critically successful . 
  it 's not buried . 
  it 's near the top . 
  stop responding to something on 0 or -1 ( not even close to being buried ) with these stupid comments , reddit . 
  legacy infect , legacy rug delver , and legacy ant player here . 
  i know what i 'm talking about . 
   that 's right ... 
  if the first parameter 0 then the second parameter is exclusive , otherwise it 's inclusive . 
  this is why i think this language is shit . 
  it 's my opinion , and i might even change it down the line , but for now i will continue to thinking it 's shit . 
  i was joking the other day with a friend about how retarded it would be if a language did this . 
  i definitely disagree . 
  i find that sort of chaining completely unreadable compared to generator expressions .
