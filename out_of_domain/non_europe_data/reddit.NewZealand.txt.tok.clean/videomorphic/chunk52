  well you are defending the trend being allowed to stay high . 
  you ca n't say ` it might go down ! ', 
  as a basis for your argument that it should be allowed to stay up . 
   this is the problem . 
  you 're main concern is immigration but you do n't seem to be full of any ideas as to how we get locals to fill the gaps in the employment market ,, 
  the ` gaps ' in the employment market are highly exaggerated . 
  the labour party has good policies for training youth that are n't in education , employment or training . 
  if we reduce immigration , the massive oversupply of labour that is forcing wages down will be reduced and wages will rise again , which will increase peoples ' willingness to stay and work in nz after graduating . 
   not to mention that new zealand is joining the rest of the developed world in having an aging population , so immigrants are going to have to be brought in to keep the country functioning unless you want to start messing around with birth rates . 
  this is a ** total ** myth . 
  in no part of the world will there ever be any societal issues due to an ` aging population ' that ca n't be solved through a few simple taxation benefits for having children . 
  there have never been and never will be any sort of ` aging population crisis ' . 
  immigration , on the other hand , is a crisis already and is only going to get worse . 
   there are skills shortages . 
  there are going to be a massive shortage of qualified secondary school and primary school teachers as well as other professionals once all the ones in work start retiring . 
  there 's no way we can fill those positions with new zealanders because not nearly enough of students are becoming teachers . 
  how else are you expecting to fill those positions without hiring foreigners ? 
  that 's because we do n't pay teachers enough . 
  i have a maths degree . 
  most people i know that have science degrees would happily teach if they were n't paid a fucking pittance to teach . 
  but they would be , so * none * of them have become teachers . 
  this is an entirely homegrown problem with an entirely homegrown solution : stop treating teachers like a low skill , low wage job and reward them for their very important role in society . 
  there 's no shortage of people to work as teachers . 
  there is a shortage of people willing to work as teachers . 
  and i certainly do n't my kids being taught by anyone that is n't a born and bred new zealander . 
  kids are heavily influenced by their teachers . 
   and it 's not so much companies that do n't want to pay reasonable wages , it 's that new zealanders wo n't want to work for jobs that are barely above minimum wage . 
  a lot of companies ca n't get enough people to fill positions because not enough of them are applying , in addition to having to fire people because they fail drug tests . 
  that 's simply a * lie * . 
  you are making things up or believing whatever mike hosking tells you . 
  the minimum wage is * well * above the dole in new zealand , and the numbers of people applying to minimum wage jobs are staggering . 
  many positions get ** hundreds ** of applications for a single role . 
  it 's quite simply ** false ** that companies ca n't get enough people because there are n't enough people to do the work , at that level of unskilled , low-wage labour . 
  there are more than enough people . 
  in it , though , yes , companies * claim * they ca n't get workers . 
  but they 're fucking liars . 
  they could get workers if they paid competitive wages with places like the us and the uk . 
  we have high cost of living and low tech wages , of course graduates go overseas . 
  again , simple solution : stop the flow of immigrants and let those companies learn a little lesson of economics about supply and demand : if you ca n't get what you want , raise the price you 're willing to pay . 
  that 's the real solution . 
  do n't lobby the government to increase demand by flooding our country with people that can barely speak english and know nothing about nz values . 
   that is an overly simplistic way of looking at things . 
  no it is n't . 
  it 's fact . 
  it 's not simple and it 's not simplistic . 
  it companies do n't want to raise wages , and they do n't have to . 
  why would they ? 
  it 's easy to hire people from overseas . 
  most graduates go and work overseas , if not immediately then at some point , because they money is literally twice as good in the us , if not more . 
  you can earn $ 100k/yr in the us ( that 's usd ) quite easily with a couple of years experience . 
  in nz you 'd struggle to earn $ 90k nzd/yr with the same experience . 
  adding logging to something that was pure beforehand makes it impure . 
  yet it 's something many people would view as completely okay to do , not violating anyone 's assumptions about behaviour . 
  sorry , i meant something else . 
  either way , it 's well known that `` the list monad '' is a misleading term because there are many different implementations of monads for lists . 
  that 's also true for applicative for list . 
   this disagrees . 
  in fact is disagrees for a very long time , its been there for several years . 
  and it 's not relevant to immigration . 
  there is no reason why new zealand would have a long term skills shortage in * any * area . 
  we have the facilities in nz to train people in * any and every * field . 
  short term skills shortages are possible , but long term skills shortages should * never * be possible , because we should be training people properly . 
   electricians are not idiots , they ensure your home is wired safely and securely and make sure your homes and commercial premises are looked after . 
  they also help build homes here . 
  do n't be silly . 
  what 's what got to do with anything ? 
  i did n't say that electricians are all stupid , i just disputed the idea that all electricians are automatically the sort of smart useful people we need , as if new zealand is in dire need of those smart fellows from overseas . 
  in reality , new zealand is a well-educated country that has absolutely ** zero ** need for immigrants . 
   but there is a recognised shortage . 
  it makes no sense , whatsoever , to solve it with immigration , though . 
  my problem is that framing it as a ` skills shortage ' implies that it 's a problem that could be solved with immigration , because ` skills shortage ' is a term used only in an immigration context , policy-wise , in new zealand . 
  that 's wrong , though . 
  long-term skills shortages are never , ever solved through immigration . 
  they are exacerbated by immigration . 
  okay , so what you mean is not ' i have to be in auckland ' but ' i prioritise my children spending time with my relatives while living in a shitty , cold , tiny , uninsulated house than living in a warm large house in a friendly community with fewer transients and immigrants ' ? 
  seek does n't list all the jobs in nz . 
  it does n't even list 1 % of them . 
  auckland has about 1/3 of nz 's population and about 1/3 of its jobs . 
  i fail to see how it has a higher density of jobs per population . 
   not sure if you read my comment ( and its follow-up ) that i linked up there . 
  the idea was that you can mark technically impure things as `` unsafe pure '' if they have no observable side effects , or various other considerations . 
  my entire point is that what you consider an ` unobservable side effect ' is actually just a side effect . 
  if it 's actually unobservable , then it 's not a side effect , and you 're just marking the function as pure . 
  that goes back to my point before , where i said that if you ca n't mark functions as pure there 's no point in them being pure . 
  and you ( or someone on the same side of this discussion ) disagreed , saying that purity marking was n't useful . 
   trade-offs like that always exist in the real world , hence why i 'm not a big fan of `` let 's enforce purity wholesale '' like say haskell does it . 
  haskell has a massive syntactic divide between pure and impure functions . 
  it 's very annoying . 
  but in a hypothetical language that is n't crap :, 
  ( define ( foo x ), 
  blah ) ), 
  ( static-if !, 
  ( not debug-mode ), 
  ( s-exprs to avoid bikeshed over syntax ), 
  you can declare things as pure depending on what mode you 're in , quite easily . 
  or the compiler can infer it . 
  it does n't really matter . 
  you get my drift : purity marking is useful . 
  ` argue ' ? 
  are they children ?
