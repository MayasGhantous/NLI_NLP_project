  those skilled migrants being brought in are being used to fill gaps in the labour market that can not be filled using local labour . 
  it also does n't help that we have a government that has created an environment where labour unions are finding it increasingly difficult to get better wages . 
  there is no such thing as ` gaps in the labour market that can not be filled using local labour ' . 
  they do n't exist . 
  gaps in the labour market can always be filled using local labour . 
  the problem is that due to immigration and oversupply of foreign labour , we have very low wages , and our well-trained new zealanders and graduate new zealanders are going overseas where they are n't paid like shit due to having to compete with a billion indians . 
   this is overly simplistic to the point of being stupid . 
  there are multiple factors in environmental pollution and immigration does n't even come close . 
  immigrants are a significant part of nz 's population growth year-on-year , and environmental damage is primarily driven by population size . 
  that 's why nz has been fairly pristine for so long , compared to other similar countries : similar countries tend to have much higher populations . 
   no it does n't . 
  this is just ignorance . 
  do n't cut off 85 % of my fucking paragraph , cunt . 
  respond to my point . 
  go and fucking talk to someone that has lived in china and ask them . 
   it does . 
  again , this stupid myth over and over again . 
  nobody is talking about getting rid of ** all ** immigration . 
  therefore a report that compares current immigration levels to * zero * immigrants is * obviously irrelevant * . 
  nobody is talking about getting rid of productive immigrants that have a positive effect on nz . 
  they are just much further and farther between than most people realise , because of the massive downwards effect that importing labour has on our wages . 
  you 're demonstrating a total lack of understanding of new zealand politics . 
  it was labour that introduced neoliberal policies to new zealand . 
  it was national that continued neoliberal policies in new zealand . 
  it was labour that continued neoliberal policies in new zealand . 
  it is national that is continuing neoliberal policies in new zealand . 
  ** every ** government since lange 's has been absolutely , unequivocally neoliberal . 
  go watch the 9th floor on rnz . 
  geoffrey palmer defended it , although said it might have gone too far . 
  mike moore defended it . 
  jim bolger defended it . 
  jenny shipley and helen clark probably will too . 
   it 'd be so interesting to see a world where iwi developed free of direct foreign influence , and how new zealand would develop . 
  iwi would n't have developed at all . 
  look at any other culture that was n't exposed to europeans and european technology : they stagnated . 
  they stayed and kept the same hunter gatherer practices . 
  there are still tribes in the amazon that have n't gone past that phase . 
  maori did not have anything even resembling advanced technology or civilisation . 
  they did n't have the materials , and they were n't here for very long before europeans got here anyway . 
   would we eventually see a unified aotearoa ? 
  in the same way that the anglo-saxons eventually united england , yeah we might have eventually . 
  but for maori to get to that point they would have to actually get somewhere near the technology level that the anglo-saxons had over a thousand years beforehand . 
  they 'd have to develop agriculture . 
  they 'd have to develop metal tools , and it took thousands and thousands of years before we developed good enough metalworking to build machines . 
   how would maori culture develop alongside the introduction of foreign technologies ? 
  probably the same way it 's developed today : not in the slightest . 
  that 's part of the problem i have with people talking about ` maori culture today ' . 
  it 's the same maori culture as 170 years ago . 
  women still ca n't talk on maraes . 
  i have no doubt whatsoever that this is related to the issues of domestic violence among maori , which are astronomically high . 
  we have more lobbying in nz than they do in the us . 
  it 's just not covered by the media . 
  i once made a joke along the lines of ` are you checking to see if there 's a bomb in there ? ', 
  to an american tsa agent and he just laughed me through the scanner . 
  i might be the luckiest man alive . 
   this scream of a failed entrepreneur . 
  i 've never attempted to be an ` entrepreneur ' . 
  also , by definition , there is no such thing as a ` failed entrepreneur ' . 
  ` entrepreneur ' implies success . 
   people create their own fucking luck by working hard . 
  most people work hard . 
  few succeed . 
   do you really think international students are fucking dumb ? 
  if what you are suggesting was made reality then nz will get zero interest from international students . 
  new zealand gets international students because our universities are good and we 're quite close to asia , meaning shorter and cheaper flights . 
   you seem to think that nz is like the uk that it can restrict post-study work options or restrict bringing in family members and people will still want to move to your glorious nation and study there ? 
  most international students leave upon completing their qualifications . 
   newsflash , there 's only one reason people continue to want to move to the uk despite those restrictions . 
  and that reason is london . 
  new zealand does n't have a london . 
  hell , it does n't even have a sydney . 
  not to mention the fact that uk 's universities are top tier . 
  what 's the equivalent of oxford or cambridge or ucl or lse in nz ? 
  oh wait , there is no equivalent because nz education is quite shite in comparison . 
  you seem to think too highly of your country . 
  you are ignorant . 
   `` incompetent indians '' it 's obvious what you truly think of non-whites . 
  you understand that that was a link to an article , right ? 
   all i 'll say is that i experienced massive schadenfreude when i saw you and your ilk whinging about the aussie citizenship change where kiwis are collateral damage . 
  good to see your people are getting a taste of their own medicine . 
  you 're probably an american . 
  i do n't like americans . 
   btw , if indians ` struggle ' to get to the us , then how come a large majority of those who go there on h1b every year ... are indians ? 
  not anymore . 
   and new zealand is way down the preference list for most people from developing countries wanting to move abroad . 
  the preference is usually us   canada   australia   uk   nz . 
  not at all accurate . 
  the uk is ** by far ** the most desirable play to move to . 
  uk -  us -  australia -  nz -  canada . 
   also reading some of your other replies you seem to think that nz is a free-for-all and it 's super easy to get nz residency and citizenship . 
  canada is the easiest right now followed by australia . 
  yes , even with the new rules and removing of 457 , getting aus permanent residency and citizenship is still easier and more straightforward than nz . 
  you literally do n't need to do anything to get nz citizenship . 
  absolutely . 
   there has been little or no progress in meeting critical challenges like racism , climate change , inequality , sexism , or criminal justice reform . 
  but that 's just not true . 
  new zealand is by far the single most progressive colonial country in dealing with native inhabitants . 
  the settlements , despite being 100 years late , were about 50 years ahead of their time , and are still ahead of their time today . 
  i do have to say that i 'm astonished at the naivety of people like geoffrey palmer , mike moore and jim bolger , though . 
  all of them , on the 9th floor , indicated they believed that the treaty settlements would have an impact on maori poverty .
