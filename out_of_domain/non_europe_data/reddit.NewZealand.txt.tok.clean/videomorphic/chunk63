  then do n't hire them . 
  how are you going to peer-programme with them ? 
  are they going to go into a fluster every time someone walks past their desk , glances over their shoulder or wants to peer programme ? 
   not to mention that it forces you to hire for skills that do n't necessarily relate to the position . 
  you mean like the ability to communicate with others ? 
   if you 've done any interviewing you 'll know people will straight up lie through their teeth for a job . 
  i 've even had people straight up google the answers for junior/intermediate questions while on a screener phone call . 
  so do n't do phone interviews . 
  do face-to-face interviews . 
  get people to work at a computer you have there in your office for an hour if you want to get an idea of their abilities . 
   what we 're doing is filtering out people who can talk the talk but ca n't walk the walk . 
  no , you 're filtering out people who do n't want to walk the walk for free when they can go get a job somewhere else , where they 'll be treated with respect . 
  are you admitting to suffering from it in your idea of your own ability to interview effectively ? 
  if so , that 's good , it 's the first step . 
  you have to recognise it before you can fix it . 
  you 'll get better over time . 
  not much to say to this except ` no ' . 
   the whole point of a coding exercise as part of the interview is to be a focused , self-contained problem that the interviewee can complete without undue effort , and that can be discussed when they come in for the on-site interview . 
  then do it when they come in , before the interview starts . 
   i would like to talk about windows ' antimalware service executable, 
  i was going to press ctrl-alt-delete , find the process , and see how much of my computer it was using . 
  then i remembered that i got rid of every installation of windows in my house months ago . 
  you mean it 's like going to a community of people that like and support and think about a format and asking them what they think about a controversial and probably wrong thing they 've done to it ? 
  yes . 
  it is like that . 
  how is sylvan library hard to support ? 
  you go from uwr to uwg ? 
  bant is now a thing !, 
  legacy is n't about ` shaking up the meta ' . 
  go play modern if you want that . 
  i think one of the problems with legacy , a format i love , is that the colour that gets card advantage in normal magic is the one colour that really is n't allowed it in legacy . 
  yeah but you 're still ` meant ' to play 17 creatures , 17 lands and 6 non-creatures . 
  that means 6 cards across all of enchantments , artifacts , sorceries and instants . 
  you play with combat tricks , but i 've seen meaningful stack interaction * once * in my entire time playing limited ( other than simply ' i play x ' -  ` counter it ' ) . 
  dick all ? 
  landstill is n't exactly a new and unproven idea , you know ... you do n't have to play the standstill . 
  the deck is named after it , but that does n't mean it 's entirely reliant on playing it . 
  double-blue is much harder than you might think . 
  it certainly is n't auto-4-of . 
  most decks in legacy ( all ? ), 
  are proactive : you want to spend mana on your own turn . 
  the decks that hold up counterspells do so in spite of their plan to lay down threats . 
  think of delver . 
  counterspells you hold up tend to be free : force and daze . 
  otherwise they cost 1 mana . 
  you 'd never ever play mana drain in delver , because what would you even spend the mana on ? 
  and it 's not like the deck would n't see play . 
  mana drain sucks against delver . 
  so you counter their spell and get 1 extra mana . 
  whoop-di-doo . 
  more like you try to mana drain them and they daze it , setting you behind in tempo , or you mana drain their threat and try to spend the extra mana on a jace , and they daze that , setting you * way * behind . 
  landstill might be able to become tier 1 if they unbanned drain . 
  they 'd need to reprint the card though . 
  mana drain is n't even good against delver , for example . 
  it would be good against shardless or something like that , but against rug delver for example ? 
  it 's crap . 
  absolutely agree . 
  i do n't think there 's a chance it 'll be too powerful . 
  who right now would even play it ? 
  who has a deck that 's already remotely competitive that would play it ? 
  maverick has never really had a big problem with combo decks , though . 
  maverick has discard , deathrite and thalia . 
  i think we 'll see a lot more rug delver now that miracles is dead . 
  discard is important against combo for maverick imo . 
  that 's how it works in nz too . 
  but even before that , it was never particularly difficult to fire people , as long as you properly documented your discussions around performance ( or lack thereof ) . 
  the title says ` old but still relevant ' . 
  except it is n't old . 
  i 'm not complaining about reposts , so back off bud . 
   do they pay you for 5 hours onsite plus prep time refreshing algorithms knowledge or whatever ? 
  not in my experience . 
  is that work ? 
  it 's an interview . 
  hire them on a trial basis then . 
  where did i say i could n't make a connection between the two ? 
  of course there is a connection , that 's the entire explanation . 
  yet nobody talks about that . 
  nobody says ` we need to fix the socioeconomic divide between maori and whites to resolve this issue ' . 
  they just say it 's racism . 
  if you have that many candidates you should reduce your salary offerings : supply and demand . 
  stoneblade existed long after miracles came about though . 
  rug delver is in a much better spot with miracles banned . 
  rug has dealt with drs for years . 
  i do n't see how it 's any easier to kill knight than it is to kill most creatures in the format . 
  he generally does n't die to bolt . 
  ** rug delver ** :, 
  well you already have a base of 56 mandatory cards :, 
  4x wasteland, 
  4x tropical island, 
  4x volcanic island, 
  4x flooded strand, 
  4x brainstorm, 
  4x ponder, 
  4x force of will, 
  4x daze, 
  4x delver of secrets, 
  4x nimble mongoose, 
  4x lightning bolt, 
  so the real question is this : what card do you play 4-of for the last ? 
  i think , with the prevalence of bug in the current meta , it 's ** forked bolt ** .
