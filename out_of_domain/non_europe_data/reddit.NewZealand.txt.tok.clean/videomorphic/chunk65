  does n't matter whether they 're the same concept . 
  they go hand in hand . 
  ` right to work ' is commonly used to refer to ` at will ' , so much that they essentially mean the same thing to most people . 
  i think you 're missing the point a bit . 
  the issue is n't about the facts of the case at hand . 
  the issue is n't him in particular . 
  the issue is that decisions were made by the executive ( which is enormously powerful in nz , it really is executive sovereignty and not parliamentary sovereignty that we have in nz , if you agree with geoffrey palmer ) with zero oversight . 
  i do n't want nz to become even more like the us , where you just say the magic phrase ` national security ' and instantly do n't have to reveal any information to anyone about a decision , it 's just secret , no appeals , etc. 
  that 's wrong . 
  we have to have a balance , and that balance ** must ** include the ability for anything to go to court . 
  new zealand 's courts can suppress information , they have wide-ranging powers to hold closed courtrooms , etc. 
  but it must be for the courts to decide if information is too sensitive to be released to the public , not the government . 
  the government can make decisions . 
  that 's fine . 
  but all actions of the executive ** must ** be subject to judicial review , and ` classified information ' must be available to the court , in full , and not redacted of the pertinent details . 
  they should unionise and negotiate higher wages then . 
  it 's not my responsibility to sort out other industries ' pay issues . 
  tipping is a reward for good service , not an expectation . 
  yeah absolutely . 
  if two of my friends paid more than $ 500 for a meal for the three of us , then paying a $ 50 tip would be the least i could do . 
   if the service went well above what you 'd expect , ~ ~ then tip accordingly . 
  if the service went well above what you 'd expect , then their employer will do exactly what you said above : pay them more , give them a raise , give them a bonus , or whatever . 
  if they are n't getting it , unionise !, 
   leaving a $ 15 tip on a $ 535 bill is an insult . 
  leaving nothing would have indicated you do n't do tipping , but that low ? 
  that 's throwing shade at the service you received . 
  i assume ` throwing shade ' is some moronic americanism you 've picked up , either from being an american or spending too much time there . 
  please actually use english in this subreddit . 
  i 'm sure you 're totally unbiased , given that you obviously are n't targeting obama based on his race , mr. / u/martinlutherkong . 
  i 've never seen a job ad without an indication of salary . 
  your username is a clear indication that you are a racist . 
  stoneblade decks ( including deathblade ) were a massive part of the meta until like ... 2015 maybe ? 
  they found treasure cruise and dig through time difficult to compete with , and by the time dig was banned mentor was here and miracles had a much easier time fighting stoneblade . 
   new zealand public education is n't free . 
  families have to pay school fees , compulsory `` donations '' and fees for school trips, 
  school feels and donations are the same thing , and they 're optional . 
  parents are pressured to pay them , but are not required to . 
  school trips are optional at parents ' expense . 
   costs for stationery, 
  this does n't mean school is n't free . 
   for a family at or below the breadline , that is not something that they can afford . 
  and yet they manage to . 
   many maori and pacific islanders drop out of school because they do n't see being in school as being worth their time and effort , especially when there 's little hope that they could find a job or go to university . 
  which is n't true : university entrance is based purely on academic record , you can borrow money for fees , course related costs and living costs , and the student allowance exists . 
  the people that find it hardest to get to university are people just above the line where student allowance drops to pitiful levels , as they ca n't afford to go to uni but ca n't really get any assistance because they 're not `` poor '' . 
   i 'm not at all . 
  your point is that we should just lock all the criminals up and be done with it . 
  i literally never said that . 
  stop making things up . 
   that 's necessity . 
  just being able to put food on the table does n't mean that you 're living a comfortable life . 
  often you need to pay for other things and having that extra money available is always going to be the better option . 
  no it is n't necessity . 
  the vast majority of criminals do not commit crime out of necessity . 
  drug addiction ( and crime to pay for it ) is a common cause of crime and is not out of necessity . 
   because they get paid a lot of money to sell it . 
  when they began to sell it , they were probably poor and needed money . 
  that 's how people begin making and selling drugs . 
  they get paid a lot of money to sell it . 
  that does n't stop it being wrong . 
  it 's morally inexcusable to commit crime to make money . 
  plenty of people survive on a benefit without crime . 
   no , you said that they commit more crime than most , but given that you have a lot of ignorant opinions , it 's not surprising that you think the way you do but try to cover it in something that does n't look as controversial as outright suggesting that all maori are criminals . 
  so you admit that i never said that all maori are criminals , that i 've never said anything that implies it , but that because you think i am some sort of evil monster and because you think you can read my mind over the internet , you have decided that actually i think much worse than what i say ? 
  holy fuck you 're mentally ill . you 're so mentally ill . 
  ` throwing ' is and ` shade ' is , but ` throwing shade ' is a term in new zealand english . 
  splinter twin ban or sensei 's top ban ? 
  bugger it , they 're both wrong . 
  splinter twin ban was silly because the deck was n't dominating the metagame . 
  it was a totally pointless ban . 
  it helped keep the meta sane . 
  they banned it to shake up the meta to force people to buy new cards and to make the pt ` interesting ' because they do n't understand the concept that magic can be interesting without every tournament having a totally different meta from the last . 
  they do n't understand that watching experienced players get the most out of decks is interesting . 
  top ban was silly because top has never been a problematic card in legacy . 
  cb/top has been used in a wide variety of decks over the years and none of them have dominated the format except miracles . 
  the problem with miracles was that it had a 1-mana board wipe . 
  that 's overpowered , not top . 
  terminus should have been banned , which would still kill miracles but without getting rid of all the non-miracles decks that use top ( which is a lot of non-blue decks and some blue decks like bant ) . 
  the point of banning something like miracles is to make the meta broader , surely ? 
  it 's been long held that only a few very specific decks can really deal with miracles , and that a lot of legacy 's deck diversity really comes from people playing pet decks rather than really competitively viable decks . 
  everyone really knows in the back of their mind that objectively speaking miracles and storm are the only truly good decks in legacy in a vacuum , and that everything else is just a meta response to those decks , or a meta response to a meta response to those decks ( up to some limit ) , or personal desire for deck diversity . 
  so why ban miracles in a way that makes no other top tier deck worse but lots of decks struggling to break into the top tier worse as well ? 
  doing that just unnecessarily kills lots of other fringe decks , further cementing the gap between top tier decks and fringe decks in legacy . 
  well it does n't matter whether it 's true . 
  everyone else understood what ` right to work ' meant , except you . 
   the callers can call calculatepi ( ) without ever knowing you are logging things . 
  and they should n't know : it 's a private implementation detail . 
  and if you need to add things that are not relevant to calculating pi , just inject them as well and your callers do n't need to change . 
  no they ca n't . 
  how you log depends on who is calling you . 
  it 's not an implementation detail . 
   and that 's why your approach simply does n't work . 
  i just want to calculate pi , i should n't need to provide you with all your implementation details : logger , memory cache , database connection pool , etc. . . 
  i just want you to calculate pi and return it to me . 
  quite wrong . 
  you do need to provide logging , memory allocation , database connections , etc. 
  those are important context . 
  they need to be provided . 
  how do you ensure that when i call a function it only uses a limit of x kib of memory to do what i want it to do , that anything it logs includes the id of the request that i am handling , and that it only acts with authority x ? 
   you do n't need a logger to calculate pi , therefore it 's an implementation detail .
