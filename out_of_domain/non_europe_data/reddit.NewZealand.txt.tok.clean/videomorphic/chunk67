  no , a link to some fake news website does n't count , a link to something in the usc would . 
   that 's entirely what the evidence presented addresses . 
  you have n't given any evidence . 
  a link to a fake news website is n't evidence . 
  present reliable sources and people might actually take you seriously . 
   you 're doing argument by assertion again . 
  you 're doing argument by racist , lying , fake , white nationalist sources . 
  i 'd rather go with assertion . 
   i do n't really think you know how to do this very well at all . 
  i think on the contrary that you know exactly what you 're doing and you 're quite practised at it . 
  your goal is to tire the person discussing something with you out . 
  well sorry , but that 's not how things work around here . 
  you wo n't tire me out by posting fake news sources . 
   if you do n't like the website , go read any of the other websites that covered the sheriff 's media release . 
  that 's not how this works . 
  you 're making the absurd , universally-held-to-be-debunked claim , that everyone credible regards as false : obama was not born in the us . 
  you 're then trying to back it up by linking to sources that are the very opposite of reliable . 
  first you provided no evidence . 
  when it was pointed out that you provided no evidence , you provided fake evidence . 
  as it was pointed out this was fake evidence , you are now trying to shift the burden of proof onto me . 
  sorry , but that 's not how this works . 
  that does n't mean that rust is on-topic in every thread on this subreddit . 
   i do n't think stoneforge mystic is really good enough for legacy outside of d&t . 
  the card has existed in magic since 2010 and has been a top tier choice in blue-white legacy decks for * the entirety of that time * . 
  coming back to legacy after a few months off due to this ban , statements like ` stoneblade is basically unplayable ' and ` miracles killed stoneblade ' are laughable . 
  stoneforge mystic is incredibly good . 
  it had a hard time keeping up with dig and then it had a hard time keeping up with mentor miracles , so with top banned it 's just got a * lot * better . 
  what you said makes you sound like someone that 's never actually played legacy . 
   rug delver will have to be remodeled entirely . 
  the deck 's primary strength was its one-mana shroud threat that punished miracles players incredibly , along with its package of winter orbs for further punishment . 
  this is absurd . 
  thresh/rug delver predates miracles by years . 
  the deck absolutely ** sucks ** against counterbalance/top . 
  miracles was the biggest weakness of rug delver . 
  yeah they did n't even ban pack rat . 
  and it was n't even strong when it was first released , it was strong in combination with the stupid theros block , which was terrible for a million different reasons . 
  because there 's only one miracles deck . 
  well yeah but that 's the point !, 
  legends was a very fringe variant . 
  saying it was a major variant of miracles is like saying tes is a major variant of ant : it is n't . 
  it 's one guy 's pet deck . 
  so is legends miracles . 
  everyone plays mentor these days . 
  well . . everyone played . 
   i think infect is still very good , the question i 've always had is why play it over delver , and the answer was pretty clear before : it had a better miracles matchup . 
  because it 's fun . 
  that 's the reason people play it . 
  i think you 're overthinking it , as most players just play what they find enjoyable . 
  really the main reasons miracles was 15 % of the meta was that it was both the best deck * and * the only control deck . 
  people want to play their favourite style . 
  when there are three good midrange decks and there are three good tempo/aggro-control/delver decks and there is only one good control deck , of course it 'll be more popular . 
   good players can get cards banned , they do it all the time for fun . 
  a legacy example would be mystical tutor . 
  in this case it was both the good players who had too much of an advantage , and the bad players who played too slowly . 
  mystical tutor was banned because two ** morons ** at wotc played modo for a day and thought it ` seemed too powerful ' . 
  say what you like about their ban decisions today , but at least they actually look at some data rather than just fucking about on modo and banning cards that beat them . 
  when was the last time wotc banned a card from a deck that was n't the top deck in the format ? 
  that 's absurd . 
  stoneblade has been an excellent choice for the entire last 7 years . 
   the reason these players gravitated to legacy was the opinion that legacy will not have constant bans and is stable . 
  this is n't a constant any more . 
  one ban is ` constant bans ' ? 
  one ban is ` unstable ' ? 
  i get it , your pet deck got banned . 
  but be reasonable . 
  the reason legacy only had one control deck was that miracles was the * perfect * control deck . 
  miracles had better finishers , better deck manipulation , better locks and a better mana base than any other control deck . 
  if the dominant delver deck is bug , you can at least find reasons to play other delver decks . 
  rug delver is better against combo , for example . 
  there 's literally no reason to play another legacy control deck over miracles . 
  compared to miracles , landstill has :, 
  * worse deck manipulation ( no top ), 
  * worse mana base ( you need to play three colours - urw or uwr or ubg ), 
  * worse deck wipes ( you need to play three/four-mana board wipes ), 
  * worse lock ( standstill sucks compared to countertop ), 
  * worse finishers ( 2/2s that make you sac a land when they die are worse than 4/4 flying angels or magic super token generating monks ) . 
   top decks will always be in danger of bans, 
  there 's nothing at all to indicate that miracles was banned because it 's the best deck . 
  so wotc should just never ban cards ? 
  miracles was n't banned for being the best deck . 
  there was a very good reason to ban top : it made every single round of every single tournament , large or small , go to time . 
  tier 1.5 is `` shit tier '' ? 
  aggro ? 
  what aggro ? 
  there are n't any aggro decks in legacy . 
   my fucking deck got banned retard . 
  no , 71 cards of it were not banned , only 4 were . 
  those cards are all usable in other decks . 
  i get it man , it * sucks * . 
  it sucks for you that you spent all this money on a deck and only got a couple of months to play with it . 
  but your deck did not get banned , top got banned . 
  your cards are still usable in other decks . 
  terminus , counterbalance and entreat were n't money cards . 
  tes is a bad storm variant that 's only known because one extremely good storm player plays it . 
  i can only assume that is a joke . 
   it is you came to legacy for no bans and the same thing you left other formats for just happened . 
  no , you come to legacy because it requires 100x as much skill as any other format , has many more interactions , and on the simple principle that there 's no reason you should n't be able to play chaoslace if you really wanted to . 
  it 's got the best decks , the best interactions , and it stable . 
  legacy is not a format with no bans . 
  they recently banned dig through time and treasure cruise .
