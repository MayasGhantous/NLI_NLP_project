   you have seen the discussions of how if drs gets kicked is going to likely cause an extreme over saturation of reanimator and storm, 
  it just would n't . 
  that 's simply unfactual . 
   and how many people have been throwing around a drs ban, 
  people have been talking about drs being banned since it was printed . 
  there is no reason at all to believe it will be banned . 
  drs does n't make rounds go to time . 
  top was banned because it 's like shahrazad ( bad for tournaments ) not because it 's like black lotus ( overpowered ) . 
   if you have n't you 're under quite the large rock . 
  people constantly discuss banning the cards they personally dislike . 
  it does n't ever actually happen . 
  one ban is not precedent for wotc to start banning cards every 3 months . 
  you have nothing to worry about . 
  they are n't going to ban drs any time soon . 
   just because you want to ignore the conversation does n't mean it 's not happening . 
  i 'm not denying the conversation is happening . 
  i 'm denying that it 's meaningful . 
  discussions on reddit about bannings are the least useful conversations about magic you could possibly have . 
  you 're still missing the point . 
  this is n't like survival , where basically all of the cards were only useful in survival . 
  this is n't like if elves were banned and suddenly every card in the deck is worthless . 
  the vast majority of the value in miracles is still there . 
  ranges and concepts have never been designed in a way that would work for c++ . 
  remember that c++ has very different requirements than standard ml . 
  it needs to support static dispatch , zero-cost abstractions , etc. 
  while ml is all about expressiveness and type safety . 
  personally vue is just so much cleaner than angular js to me . 
  none of the silly dependency-injection rubbish . 
  and have you written unit tests for angularjs 1 code ? 
  holy christ the ` _ $ rootscope _ ` crap is just a nightmare . 
  vue has vuex if you want to do that redux-style stuff . 
  it 's only really practical for very large programmes though ( which is also true in react ) . 
  calculus is far more useful in everyday life than abstract algebra . 
  what a huge survey . 
  i basically said that i liked that the set had some cards clearly designed for legacy and other eternal formats like vintage ( and no , modern is n't eternal for those wondering ) yet was still a great sealed and draft format . 
  i said that they should learn from this that there 's no harm in supporting legacy and other eternal formats and that it does n't hurt their ability to make sets for limited and standard . 
  one unfortunately-well-known twit from channel fireball playing a deck does n't make that deck any sort of standard . 
  it 's hilarious to me that some people think that ghost quarter is standard in lands but that rishadan port is n't ? 
  like , people seem to think that it 's standard to put ghost quarter in ? 
  that 's so hilariously wrong . 
   this is especially true with all the storm in today 's meta . 
  what ? 
  tabernacle is useless against storm . 
  i think you have to play goblins like infect , even though that sounds really weird . 
  basically you have some draws where you just dump your hand and kill your opponent . 
  but most of the time you 're playing a sort of aggroish control role : you want to grind out card advantage and card quality through cards like matron ( while infect is casting brainstorms and ponders ) , you want to lock your opponent out with wastelands and rish ports ( while infect is countering their spells and wastelanding them too ) . 
  eventually you kill them , but generally after wearing them out a bit . 
  it 's not really an aggro deck ( it has too much interaction ) and it 's not really a control deck , and it 's not really a combo deck . 
  that 's a sideboard card in storm , and who would bring it in against a lands deck that might have tabernacle ? 
  well they had that 1r creature that pings people for activating artifacts and lands . 
  their wincons in their sideboard , which we 're unlikely to bring in . 
  i do n't agree that there 's any significant meta shift . 
  rishadan port is the standard and has been the standard for ** years ** . 
   and frankly , from my perspective , an equilibrium in which the most played deck accounts for 12 % of the meta , the three most played decks are three different archetypes ( combo , aggro , control ) , and each of the five colors is used in at least one of the top five decks, 
  ** and that top deck is miracles ** though . 
  which changes things . 
  miracles was always an obnoxious deck . 
  countertop is an historic legacy package that i 'm horrified has been banned , but something had to get miracles out of its spot there at the top . 
  i see no reason it could n't have been terminus , but miracles was just utterly stagnant and it utterly stagnated legacy . 
   so i have to ask , with these considerations in mind , in exactly what way was miracles a top deck in a way that should never be unique , and in exactly what way was the format stagnated and undiverse in a way it should not be ? 
  the meta barely changes year to year . 
  occasionally they print some new ridiculous card , which changes the meta a bit , but that really does n't tend to change the meta . 
  it just changes a couple of slots in a couple of decks . 
  the meta changing slowly over time is what we want , not the meta changing constantly ( not at all what we want , that 's the worst possible thing that could happen ) nor the meta never changing at all ( which is what we had ) . 
  when was the last time we had a genuinely new deck ? 
  eldrazi aggro was n't new , it just used eldrazi instead of other creatures in a very familiar shell . 
  ur delver was n't new . 
  omnitell was n't new . 
  4c loam was n't new . 
  delver coming out totally reorganised legacy . 
  terminus coming out changed legacy . 
  jace coming out totally reshaped legacy . 
  stoneforge mystic changed legacy a ton . 
  when was the last time something like that happened to this format ? 
  it 's stagnant . 
  the format basically has n't materially changed since abrupt decay was released . 
  look at some top 8s in 2014 . e.g. 
  scg legacy open richmond in november 2014 . 
  the top 8 was death and taxes , uw miracles , stoneblade , ur delver , infect , lands , stoneblade and uw miracles . 
  if that top 8 happened today i do n't think anyone would be surprised except that maybe it had a bit less bg than you 'd expect . 
  what about another event that year , nebraska 2.0 legacy main event in december . 
  the top 8 was uwr delver ( admittedly this deck is n't really around anymore ) , burn , ur delver , miracles , bug delver , sneak & show , stoneblade and uw miracles . 
  gp edison 2014 ? 
  stoneblade , infect , storm , miracles , landstill ( which was not at all common then either ) , mud , stoneblade and ur delver . 
  landstill and mud were just as surprising then as they would be now , and the rest are totally standard and were totally standard 3 years ago as well . 
  the meta is essentially identical today to what it was 3 years ago , except that stoneblade has basically disappeared off the map completely * for no good reason * . 
  this is maverick . 
  is it physically possible for abstract algebra to be interesting ? 
  compared to analysis , for example ? 
  i do n't really think so . 
  ant is the only viable storm deck in legacy . 
  gsz is far from slow . 
  i firmly hold that it is the same deck . 
  what have n't you heard of in that list ? 
  holy crap that 's a huge tail of decks . 
  almost a quarter in the ` other ' section . 
  well if that 's the case we should be playing actually good miracles like time walk . 
  mtgo is n't representative of legacy , and getting 5-0 in a league does n't make a deck viable . 
  eh it 's more like maverick than it is like zoo . 
  yeah i wonder if it would work with delvers .
