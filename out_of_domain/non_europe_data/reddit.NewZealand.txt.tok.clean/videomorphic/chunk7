  it 's the same thing with genders reversed . 
  i do n't very often see girl-dominated groups discussing what to do to increase the number of guys that turn up at them , though . 
   just because a player is younger than you does n't mean they are worse than you . 
  they do tend to be . 
  especially very young kids . 
  anyone over the age of about 13 or 14 i have no reason to suspect will be particularly bad , but i 've never played against a kid under that age that was good compared to me , and i 'm pretty bad myself . 
  everyone 's prerelease went about average , on average . 
  and i have literally never seen any sort of sexual playmats or sleeves . 
  your anecdotal shit does n't prove anything . 
  i 'm not saying this would n't discourage people . 
  i 'm saying this is a very rare occurrence and it 's not widespread enough to be a significant factor . 
  i have literally no idea what you 're talking about . 
  ` state-wide [ education ] policies ' are n't law . 
  knitting , dance , general crafty stuff . 
  i have literally never seen any sexual playmats . 
  do n't tell me what i have and have not experienced . 
  no i 'm saying both ancedotes are irrelevant . 
  it 's just a stupid irrelevant concern . 
  i do n't care if i turn the person i replied to off the game . 
  i thought it was pretty mean . 
  but it does n't really tell you that . 
  if you complain about it and they ignore you , then sure it tells you about the culture of the store . 
  if you never complain about it or report it , then how do you know that it 's actually accepted or known about ? 
  that 's my experience as well , but not specifically with women and girls . 
  actually just with all magic players . 
  only a small minority of players are competitive . 
  it 's like when i played wow many years ago . 
  if i met someone irl that played wow , i would ask them what they were up to in game and almost every single one of them said something along the lines of ' i have been playing for about a year a couple of hours a week and i 'm level 40-something . 
  i think i 'm a. . . tauren ? 
  no a tauren warrior . ', 
  most people play most games pretty casually . 
  you wo n't get sued . 
  you 'll possibly lose your teaching license , and possibly be subject to criminal charges , but the state does n't sue people . 
  but the thing is , * so many people express this same view here * . 
  that they would rather just leave than criticise or report or complain . 
  but that just leads to a vicious cycle of people getting away with it . 
  report it , and if something is done then you 've saved dozens of people - not just women , men are n't any more interested in seeing this shit than women - from leaving . 
  i do n't see how that 's relevant in any way to the discussion . 
  you turned dvorak on . 
  it 's just supply and demand . 
  it 's 100 % supply and demand . 
  drake certainly is not in every top deck . 
  it 's just bad , though . 
  cloud of faeries was banning for being much , much faster and much , much better . 
  that 's the case for every single good deck in every single format : there are tier 1 decks and you need to have a gameplan against all of them . 
  yes that includes peregrine drake decks in pauper , but it also includes every good deck in every format . 
  drake does n't destroy the format . 
  become immense is nowhere near being banworthy . 
  infect is n't even the best deck in the format . 
  thank god you are n't in charge of the banlist . 
  drake is n't warping pauper . 
  then only unban cards for a while . 
  no it does n't . 
  the entire * whining reddit community * . 
  it obsoletes every other draw engine . 
  it 's bad for the format . 
  cloud of faeries is ** much ** better than peregrine drake and went in more decks . 
  they 're not even comparable . 
  there 's no real reason for it to be banned anymore . 
  it would make affinity slightly faster , but ** much ** more vulnerable to hate . 
  people would n't play many of those lands . 
  no it does n't . 
  affinity does n't even play affinity cards anymore , and having 2 extra artifacts on turn 2 does n't mean it can automagically win . 
  it also becomes much less resilient . 
  all-in artifact land builds would be worse than current affinity builds . 
  that 's moronic . 
  become immense is completely fucking fine . 
  delve is not a broken mechanic . 
  become immense is not too strong . 
  infect is not even the best deck now . 
  it would be unplayable without bi . 
  blighted agent is not even close to being bannable . 
  infect is n't even the best fucking deck . 
  jund has way more top 8s recently . 
  no they just do n't care . 
  they are n't interested in the long term health of the format . 
  they only cared that it would shake up the pro tour . 
  he was n't arguing that . 
  good equipment doesnt exist . 
  they are not . 
  they are all too weak for the format . 
  tron does n't ` keep fair decks in check ' . 
  it ensures they 're unplayable . 
  no if the deck were an issue , become immense would be the card to ban . 
  it just is n't . 
  not even slightly . 
  because they 're all important parts of core decks in the format . 
  none of them are even slightly close to being bannable . 
  all of them ? 
  literally retarded . 
  except that 's not what would actually happen . 
  only maverick-type decks would play gsz . 
  if you actually knew anything about magic , you 'd see that in formats where it 's legal , only a small minority of green decks play it . 
  fetching dryad arbor to ramp is . . fine . 
  it 's a turn 1 mana dork that has additional utility , but only if you do n't use it . 
  that 's perfectly fine . 
  it 's worse than noble hierarch and way worse than drs in that regard . 
  gsz is n't actually ` incredibly good ' . 
  it 's okay , it 's good , but it 's not great . 
  it 's barely played in legacy outside of elves .
