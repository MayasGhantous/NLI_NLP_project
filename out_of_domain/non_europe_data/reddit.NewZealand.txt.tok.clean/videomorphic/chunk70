  like ur delver , take out some of the crap , put in the twin combo ? 
  could it work ? 
  deck is designed to work on 2 lands . 
  maybe take out the stifles and put in something else ? 
  i said that ant is the only viable storm deck in legacy . 
  you sent me a link with the implication that the link disproved me . 
  except it does n't . 
  are you 15 years old ? 
  use second-order pa , where induction makes sense ? 
  dependent choice is constructively acceptable . 
  no , countably many . 
  equations are syntax . 
  of course they are different equalities . 
  they 're syntactically different . 
  one has two `` 1 `` s , one has two `` 2 `` s. 
  there are only countably many definable real numbers , as there are only countably many formulae . 
  the rest of them are n't definable , they exist in uncountable models of zfc but ca n't be expressed syntactically . 
  you 're absolutely right , there are only countably many definable real numbers . 
  but there are uncountable models of zfc , and there are still uncountably many real numbers . 
  they just are n't all able to be uniquely specified by a first order formula of set theory ( as the language of set theory has only countably many formulae ) . 
  you ca n't make an equality ( a syntactic notion ) for each x in r ( a semantic notion ) . 
  how do you write down x = x where x is not a definable real ? 
  mathematics ( abbreviated as ` maths ' not as ` math ' ) is based on logic . 
   the faulty notion that purely syntactic structure could exhaust the semantic content of the subject matter at hand . 
  godel 's completeness theorem says that if a formula is logically valid ( satisfiable in every model ) then there is a finite deduction ( proof ) of it . 
  so actually , purely syntactic structure is powerful enough to prove any true formula . 
   philosophers such as crispin wright have put forward that we are perfectly able to express all of mathematics as logical truths . 
  that does n't really mean anything without seeing what wright defines ` perfectly able ' , ` mathematics ' , ` all of mathematics ' and ` logical truths ' as . 
   actually , the curry-howard isomorphism gives strong evidence that at their foundation , math and logic ( and computation too ) are really the same thing . 
  i think the fact that logic forms a good basis for doing real mathematics is the strong evidence there . 
  you 're being incredibly misleading . 
  you 're saying that the reals are a field but the noncomputable numbers are n't a field , and he 's interpreting that as meaning that the reals are a field despite some of them not having some property . 
  you 're confusing him , because you 're explaining it poorly . 
  there are only countably many * definable * subsets of the natural numbers . 
  think about it this way : to be able to write down such an equality ( '' { 1,2,3 } = { 1,2,3 } '' and '' { x \\ in n | x is even } = { x \\ in n | x is even } '' being examples ) you have to write down a list of symbols . 
  in the first case , you have to write down an opening curly bracket , a `` 1 '' , a comma , a `` 2 '' , etc. 
  there are countably many such strings . 
  arbitrarily ( but still finitely ) long combinations of some fixed finite alphabet ( which here would be the alphabet of the language of set theory ) form a countable set . 
  some countable subset of that countable set are syntactically correct : strings like '' { 1 , 2 , 3 } = { 1 , 2 , 3 } '' . 
  some countable subset of that countable set are syntactically incorrect : strings like '' } { 22 { = '' . 
  there are only countably many formulae in the language of set theory , that 's what i 'm saying . 
  well , given that , there are only countably many definable sets of natural numbers , because a definable set of natural numbers is one that is the * unique * set a such that f ( a ) holds in the standard model of set theory for some formula f in the language of set theory with a single free variable a. 
  to put it another way , there can not be more definable sets of natural numbers than there are ways of writing down descriptions of sets of natural numbers . 
  the uncountable rest of them are hidden away in the model . 
  proving negations in mathematics is not impossible , it 's easy . 
  for example , i can prove that the square root of 2 is not rational quite simply . 
  if you could teach one of the ancient greek mathematicians about something like godel 's incompleteness theorems . . that seems possible . 
  it 's basic enough that really all you need is logic and set theory , and they knew about sets and logic . 
  tes is very rare . 
  publishing in philosophy journals basically confirms it 's just confusion over the definition of words . 
  obviously, 
  the completeness theorem is valid for any first order * theory * , including the first order theory of peano arithmetic . 
  the completeness theorem is about * semantic * completeness , while the incompleteness theorems are about * syntactic * completeness . 
  that is , the completeness theorem says that any sentence that is true in every model can be has a proof , while incompleteness says that either there 's a sentence p such that both p and ~ p can be proven , or there 's a sentence p such that neither p nor ~ p can be proven . 
  these do n't contradict each other . 
  i have n't looked at the article yet just the title ( fuck medium ) but is n't that just platonism ? 
   ultralogicism : proofs are only valid if they are entirely written in formal language . 
  is it bad that i wish more mathematicians broadly outlined their proofs as a sort of nd-like tree of deductions ? 
  for big proofs , seeing how it all fits together would be nice . 
  uh , no offence , but presumably people that can hear naturally can tell the difference between these better ? 
  i love you, 
  a great deal of philosophy is merely disagreement over the definitions of words . 
  the treaty of waitangi is considered for every major decision now ? 
  what does that even mean ? 
  what does the treaty of waitangi say about health policy ? 
  nothing . 
  nothing at all . 
  the health discrepencies between maori and non-maori are economic . 
  maori are poorer , the poor smoke and drink more , and live in shittier conditions with poor insulation and mould growing on the walls more . 
  this does n't have anything to do with the treaty of waitangi . 
  type theory absolutely * does not * make them one and the same . 
  type theory has nothing to do with whether you need to ` add axioms ' . 
  well it is a bad thing if it 's actually maori life expectancy increasing at twice the rate of non-maori ** all else being equal ** . 
  but it is n't , so the title is misleading . 
  maori life expectancy is increasing faster than non-maori because smoking rates have gone down and maori smoke much more . 
  i agree with the premise that benefit fraud is much less financially serious than tax evasion and illegal tax avoidance . 
  but the argument that we should n't imprison benefit fraudsters because it costs more than they stole does n't make any sense . 
  they 're both costs to the taxpayer . 
  there need to be punishments to deter crime . 
  punishments * do * deter crime . 
  higher punishments do n't discourage crime more , but total lack of punishment absolutely does cause crime . 
  all political promises are implicitly couched in ` assuming the financials all work out ' . 
  this would n't do anything but make that explicit , which it already essentially is . 
  ` soft science ' is n't demeaning . 
   drugs . 
  non-enforcement of drug laws ( unless they 're maori ), 
  maori are more likely to be recidivist offenders . 
  so in other words , an incredibly overly broad interpretation of a treaty that was very specific and said nothing at all about health policy . 
  i do n't understand how this is any different from a guy stabbing someone , and us spending thousands of dollars to prosecute him and send him to prison . 
  why is this argument pulled out for benefit fraudsters but not for any other crime ? 
   it does though . 
  so while not directly in the treaty there are 5 principles of the treaty which have been outlined through statute, 
  which are n't directly in the treaty , nor are they indirectly in the treaty . 
  the treaty has nothing to do with health policy . 
   so when the treaty was drafted it was only in a week . 
  which is why it is so short . 
  it 's short because it 's a peace treaty . 
  it 's not our constitution and it 's not law . 
   now the main principle we need to look at is the duty of care that the crown ows to maori, 
  the duty of care the crown owes to maori is ** exactly ** the same duty of care it owes to everyone in new zealand .
