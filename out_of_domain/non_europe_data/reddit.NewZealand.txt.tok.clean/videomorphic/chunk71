   which is easy to argue includes equity of life expectancy resulting from improved health care . 
  everyone deserves that . 
  this has nothing to do with the tow . 
  cultural denialism is absolutely and totally debunked . 
   i think the author is saying that women are better prepared for maternity - not because they 're inherently better prepared for maternity *, 
  that 's * literally * precisely what they 're saying . 
  that women are inherently better prepared . 
   the author argues that if ` masculinists ' aim their efforts at patriarchal structures and assumptions in society that harm them ( for instance the gender stereotyping that results in men getting dicked in custody disputes ), 
  that argument might be more convincing if it actually made any sense . 
   that 's great !, 
  we all want someone looking out for our mothers , sisters , wives etc. 
  in the same way we all want someone looking out for the rich and powerful ? 
  no , bugger off . 
  women are dominant in society . 
   it 's tricky is n't it . 
  i think that there 's a lot of overlap of interests that should be acknowledged however in good faith people should be frank about how far those overlaps go . 
  disagree . 
  there are no overlaps . 
   another problem is the term ` feminist ' ( or ` masculinist ' for that matter ) . 
  i think i am a feminist but that does n't mean that i share the same views or extent of principles as somebody else who describes themselves as a feminist . 
  these sorts of labels have existed forever . 
  they wo n't go away . 
  complaining about them does nothing . 
  well the author is wrong . 
  it has nothing to do with social conditioning . 
  women are n't any better at parenting than men . 
  no it is n't . 
  ` they 've been socially conditioned to be good at something ' includes the implicit statement that they are actually good at it . 
  women are n't better than men . 
  the author is n't saying ` society thinks women are better than men at parenting ' , the author is saying ` society has conditioned women to be better at men than parenting , and they are , because of society , and that 's why society thinks they 're better at parenting than men , because they are , because of society ' essentially . 
  that 's simply not true , though . 
  society * thinks * women are better parents but society is ** wrong ** . 
  well none of the language 's massive issues ( crippled metaprogramming , crippled macros , still unable to write linked data structures without ` unsafe ` , built-in safety only useful in trivial cases , hideously slow compile times , etc. ), 
  are here . 
  there are more questions asking if you feel ` uncomfortable ' in the rust community because you 're a transblack transwoman transamerican . 
  you fail completely to understand what i 'm saying . 
  the author is claiming that women are better parents because society has made them so . 
  the reality is that women are not better parents . 
   the treaty 's intention was to protect and maintain the well-being of all citizens, 
  incorrect . 
  the treaty 's intention was to bind together two peoples into a single people . 
   and its health implications relating to processes of good government and notions of participation and equity are important . 
  treaty says nothing about participation , equity or good government . 
   in particular , it has been argued that the continuing disparities in health between maoris and non-maoris represent evidence that maori health rights are not being protected as guaranteed under the treaty, 
  maori do n't have ` health rights ' . 
  everyone has the right to access to public healthcare . 
  that 's fair and equal . 
  maori do n't have any special access to healthcare . 
   and that social , cultural , economic , and political factors can not be overlooked in terms of their contribution to the health status of this group . 
  the * primary * contribution is socioeconomic . 
  maori do underperform when economics are taken into account , but by a ** much ** lesser extent . 
  that gap still needs to be filled , but this has ** nothing to do with the treaty of waitangi ** . 
  that gap needs to be filled because it 's simply ** fair ** . 
  if ethnically pacific islander people or ethnically chinese people or ethnically english people or ethnically french people underperformed in health that would be bad and it would need fixing . 
  that has ** nothing ** to do with the treaty of waitangi . 
  there are plenty of peer-reviewed and published papers that are utterly worthless and wrong . 
  for example , there 's a medical research paper with hundreds of citations that * literally just is high school maths * . 
  it 's integration , if you remember high school maths . 
  an american health researcher idiotically believing things about the treaty of waitangi ? 
  sounds perfectly reasonable to me . 
   written by doctors, 
  doctors are n't infallible . 
  if you want to actually defend your assertions with evidence , do so . 
  but do n't appeal to authority , it makes you look like a dork . 
  the idea that culture does n't affect behaviour and that everyone is totally unique , the idea that you ca n't make any generalisations across cultures . 
  literally every statistic . 
   the treaty does have a lot to do with health policy . 
  so you 're wrong . 
  sorry , you do n't just get to state that as a fact and not back it up . 
   the treaty is not a peace treaty , the treaty was desgined to gain cession over maori through sovereignty . 
  correct , that 's a more accurate way of putting it . 
  sorry if what i said was unclear . 
   also the treaty is now seen as a constituional document along with other documents like the constituions act and the bill of rights act etc. 
  so you 're wrong, 
  no , it really is n't our consitution . 
  it 's a constitutional document but it is not a law , it 's not legally binding , and it 's not our constitution . 
   you are corect ( for once ) we do ow maori the same duty of care as everyone else , however the way that maori have been treated in the past has been awful and as a result they havnt had the chance to access this equality . 
  does n't mean that health policy has anything to do with the tow . 
   good so you grasp the idea that maori deserve that , then why havnt we provided that ? 
  we do provide equal opportunity to access to healthcare . 
  that does n't have anything to do with the tow . 
  firefox is n't written in rust . 
  the safety that rust gives you is n't useful in the cases where the compiler helping you would actually be helpful to avoid bugs . 
  it 's too stupid to understand complex code . 
  it can only understand trivial code that any human can see is correct . 
  well no other browser engine has any rust code in it . 
  servo is n't a browser engine , because there is no browser with servo in it . 
  servo is an experiment . 
  servo is n't written in 100 % ` safe ` code . 
  there are ` unsafe ` blocks in servo . 
  this is my point . 
   you have very little understand of the law and how it opperates in new zealand , first year law students learn about the treaty of waitangi and its legal status ( its important ), 
  did n't say it was n't important . 
  it does n't have anything to do with health policy though . 
   ok then what is our constitution ? 
  the treaty of waitangi is absolutly law and is extremely legally binding . 
  new zealand has an unwritten constitution . 
  the treaty is not law . 
  it 's not binding . 
  its principles are referred to in statutes which are binding .
