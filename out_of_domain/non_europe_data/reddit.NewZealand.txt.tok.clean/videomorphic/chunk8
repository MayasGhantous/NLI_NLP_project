  except the deathrite shaman is **** far **** better than gsz . 
  you 're way overestimating how good elvish mystic is . 
  it 's bad . 
  it 's been in standard forever and has never been good in standard . 
  no they are n't . 
  they 're a mana dork on turn one ** or ** ( insert green card here ) on turn x. 
  this is completely different from drs , which is much stronger , because you play it on turn 1 as a mana dork * and it continues to be strong after using it as a mana dork * . 
  gsz for dryad arbor is okay , but it 's not great . 
  dryad arbor does n't make it ` great in the early game ' , it makes it * playable * . 
  no they would n't . 
  green sun 's zenith is only played by toolbox decks in legacy and would only be played by toolbox decks in modern . 
   no , he 's not looking at it as an elvish mystic , he 's looking at it as a split card where one side is elvish mystic and the other is any other ( green ) creature in your deck . 
  and that 's a good card , but it is not bannable . 
   yeah and they 're too powerful . 
  they make modern a 3 turn single archetype format . 
  no they are n't and no they do n't . 
  modern is not a particularly interactive format . 
  that has nothing to do with it being fast . 
  vintage is the fastest format and is very interactive . 
  standard is the slowest format and is very interactive . 
   wotc basically instabans every good control card . 
  what control cards has wotc banned in modern ? 
  ignoring the initial ban list , they banned punishing fire ( because it was very clearly far too good ) , and they banned dig through time ( which was n't enough to make control good anyway ) . 
  that 's it . 
   they should also be willing to ban the too good aggro cards . 
  you mean like the * vast * majority of cards they 've banned in modern ? 
  the ones that are too fast and resilient ? 
  you 're an idiot . 
   they should also ban them all in one go . 
  rock the modern meta game and we can move on from there . 
  go play standard . 
  nothing changed , so the same as before . 
  but that 's not the case , so why bring it up ? 
  there are plenty of viable midrange and control strategies in pauper . 
  nothing in this explicitly indicates that it 's talking about graduate/starting salaries . 
  yet it has lots of things that imply it :, 
   median salary is $ 40k , with the numbers slowly trickling off until about $ 90k . 
  according to the bls $ 90k in 1991 is worth $ 160k in 2016 dollars . 
  that 's a pretty generous starting salary . 
   note that this data is mostly bachelors grads with a few master 's grads . 
  phd numbers , which sometimes go much higher , are n't included . 
  all else i 'll say is that this data is just woefully incomplete . 
  it needs far more resolution and detail and just much more data before you can say that it 's bimodal . 
  at the moment it just looks like pure noise . 
   if you look at law , you have to win the prestige lottery and get into a top school , which will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars . 
  then you have to win the grades lottery and get good enough grades to get into a top firm . 
  and the you have to continue winning tournaments to avoid getting kicked out , which requires sacrificing any semblance of a personal life . 
  consulting , investment banking , etc. , are similar . 
  compensation appears to be proportional to the level of sacrifice ( e.g. , investment bankers are paid better , but work even longer hours than lawyers ) . 
  none of these are ` lotteries ' . 
  wizards banned fucking bitterblossom . 
  they 're incompetent . 
  every fucking competitively viable deck is format-warping by that standard . 
   however , grown males are still dominating all statistics on innovation , entrepreneurship , scientific breakthroughs and so on . 
  now , if you think i 'm being overly positive about males , males also dominate the prison statistics , suicide statistics , addiction statistics , syndrome and disorder statistics , early deaths etc. 
  you 're acting as if these ` cancel each other out ' or something . 
  they do n't . 
  men are hard done by in the western world to a huge extent . 
  that the top 1 % is mostly men is utterly irrelevant to everyone outside that top 1 % . 
  well no shit . 
  of course an ** alleged ** victim 's sexual history is admissable in court . 
  modern jets are actually pretty useless . 
  they 're extraordinarily expensive and do n't do much . 
  they 're the battleships of the 21st century . 
  you 're literally retarded . 
  firstly , marxism is n't related to what you think of as communism . 
  referring to left-leaning people as ` commies ' makes you sound like a fucking baboon . 
  secondly , academia has essentially always been left-wing , ever since it stopped being exclusively the purview of the very , very rich . 
  you know what i hate ? 
  i hate that as a maths student i cost the university * essentially nothing at all * , but i pay the same fees as someone doing fucking chemistry . 
   aside from ramp decks playing mystic actually being good not that long ago, 
  in literally the weakest standard i 've ever played in , and i 've played in a hell of a lot of them . 
  they were ramp decks playing elvish mystic but they did n't do well * because of elvish mystic * . 
  it was because of the stupid centaur . 
   it 's never warped standard significantly because standard is slow and dorks scale very poorly into late game . 
  and because llanowar elves is just a fairly staple standard card that does n't impact the game that much . 
   dorks scale very poorly into late game . 
  gsz does n't . 
  gsz scales * okay * into the lategame , but it 's still a huge mana sink to cast . 
  is it good ? 
  sure it 's good , but there 's nothing wrong with having good cards in modern . 
  the problem with your argument is that it 's the standard argument against unbanning cards and it 's * fucking stupid * : that the card is good . 
  no shit !, 
  it would n't be banned if it were n't good . 
  the thing is that it 's not overpowered . 
  it 's not format-dominating . 
  being good does n't make it format-dominating . 
  being good does n't make it banworthy . 
  modern has plenty of good cards . 
  `` british people '' . 
  oh my , are n't you cool ? 
  wow , nice job mate . 
  wonderful fucking comeback . 
  i do n't play burn you pillock . 
  jace and sfm are incredibly weak compared to the things people are already doing in modern . 
  jace is * barely * playable in legacy . 
   gsz is played in every green deck not called lands or shardless . 
  it 's not played in bug delver , it 's not played in shardless bug , it 's not played in rug delver , it 's not played in 4c delver , it 's not played in turbo depths , it 's not played in food chain , it 's not played in aluren , it 's not played in infect , it 's not played in green stoneblade decks , it 's not played in jund , it 's not played in bug control . 
  gsz is played in green combo-ish decks that generate a lot of mana ( like elves !, 
  and nic fit ) and it 's played in toolbox decks that play knight of the reliquary .
