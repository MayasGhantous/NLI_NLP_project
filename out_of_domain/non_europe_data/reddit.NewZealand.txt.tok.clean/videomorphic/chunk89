  if you do n't use the scientific method , it is n't science . 
  end of story . 
  that 's the definition of science . 
  everyone agrees on this . 
  nicotine and cocaine are silly examples , because if anything they 're * more obviously drugs * than alcohol is . 
  yet i mentioned two things that are ** very obviously ** not sciences , namely mathematics and computer science ( poorly named , as many things are ) . 
  ** everyone ** agrees that mathematics is not a science . 
  ** everyone ** agrees that computer science is not a science . 
  i have no idea why you 'd think saying ` mathematics is not a science ' is remotely comparable to saying ` nicotine is not a drug ' . 
  that 's inane . 
  you 're inane . 
  no , they could n't . 
  both are regressive . 
  ubi is regressive because it 's flat , and gst is regressive because it 's flat . 
  it 's okay that ubi is regressive because it 's almost always proposed as having a very progressive income tax on top . 
  but you ca n't balance out a flat payment to everyone with a flat tax on all purchases . 
  that 's just regressiveness on top of regressiveness . 
  and those facts have * nothing at all * to do with my point , which is that you ca n't use norway 's state pension fund as justification for claiming that nz 's lack of known , exploitable , massive oil reserves is some massive inhibiting factor on our success . 
  yes norway is a successful country . 
  yes they have a lot of money coming from oil . 
  yes they 've wisely invested that money and now have a * lot * of money in their state pension fund . 
  but lots of other countries are successful and lots of other countries have big savings banks for their citizens either like australia through compulsory super or like norway through a big fund . 
  new zealand could be like norway . 
  there 's never been anything stopping us from having a more equal , fair and well-off society . 
  we could literally choose to have that overnight . 
  maybe not * juche * per say . 
  i think the focus on international trade in nz is a bit silly . 
  we probably ca n't hope to produce all our electronic goods in nz , and importing out of season fruit can be useful , but tying our economy to global milk prices is * dumb * and i 'm pretty sure if you asked anyone ` should the government try to balance the economy so that nz is less reliant on dairy and tourism and our economy is less reliant on global milk prices and how much money the middle class in the us and europe happen to have each year to spend on going on holiday ' , the majority would say ` yes ' if they understood the question . 
  our internal market should be strong enough to sustain our economy , for a start . 
  part of the problem with our economy is that we 're so reliant on international trade , and that is in my opinion caused by our massively poor lower class . 
  it 's hard to have strong internal demand for goods when nobody has any money . 
   the link between productivity and wages is an entirely separate question . 
  it 's got nothing to do with the importance of international trade in goods , and the cost of same . 
  i know it was just meant to be a flippant remark about wages being low . 
  yes it is regressive . 
  if i earn $ 30,000 / yr and i earn an extra dollar , it 's taxed at my marginal income tax rate and then it 's taxed at 15 % , because i am * going * to spend that money . 
  if i earn $ 300,000 / yr and i earn an extra dollar , it 's taxed at my marginal income tax rate and then it 's taxed at * at most * 5 % , because i 'm realistically going to be saving and investing into property a huge proportion of my salary . 
   i 'm certainly not for labour-esque expansion of the public sector, 
  because you hate job creation ? 
  why do people that vote national fucking love ` job creators ' so much , but only if they 're not the government ? 
  government surplus , by definition , requires the private sector to contract . 
  do you want the private sector to contract ? 
  as a single person without kids : fuck off , dude , kids are really expensive . 
  you are * much * better off financially without kids than you are with kids and benefits . 
   firstly , bracket adjustment are progressive , not regressive . 
  you ca n't just state this without proof after it 's been clearly shown to benefit the rich more than the poor . 
  we have a surplus , which means the private sector is contracting . 
  honestly i 'm impressed . 
  did you seriously just write a post where you did n't address any of my claims , but just feigned surprise at the fact i 'd actually said anything at all ? 
  did you just write a load of falsely incredulous bullshit and expect that that would win an argument ? 
  you clearly have a lot to learn about discussing things with people if you think that being faux-incredulous at the mere * thought * that someone might disagree with you , while totally ignoring all their actual points , is an effective way to discuss things . 
  you were n't going to discuss science with me in the first place . 
  you had no interest in doing so . 
  if you think computer science is a science , fucking prove it . 
  explain why it 's a science . 
  explain why economics is a science . 
  explain why mathematics is a science . 
  you have n't done so . 
  you 've just feigned surprise at people that have claimed they are n't and repeatedly just said ` it is a science though ' . 
  that 's just rubbish . 
  sdt was a useful card in ddft because it was a slow deck that wanted card selection , but it was only * deck-killingly-important * for the lab man kill , which was shit anyway . 
  because you deserve to be called out for being a twat . 
  benefits : border security is easier to maintain, 
  drawbacks : more expensive to export and import things ( juche ! ), 
  well it is n't a science . 
  there 's nothing scientific about it . 
  unless you 'd like to give a reason that it is a science other than ` lol it 's got science in name it must be a science !!!!! ', 
  well when you fuck over the unions by changing the laws so they 're not as useful to workers , people do n't tend to be in unions . 
  what a fucking surprise ? 
  unions are n't a ` relic ' outside of english-speaking extremely right-wing countries like nz and the us . 
  they 're still strong in germany , for example . 
  unions are only a ` relic ' in nz because they 've been gutted . 
  they are n't like . . 
  i dunno . . white people owning everything . 
  they are n't inherently obsolete . 
  they 're just not very popular when the government has smeared them constantly and fucked them over . 
  fuck espiner , he 's such a cunt . 
  he 's * clearly * baiting there . 
  every time lord says it 's just one of many reasons , espiner comes back with ` but the sjws hate u rite ? ', 
  i hope you 're being sarcastic . 
   can one of those white guys provide insight into problems specific to pacifica women or maori men ? 
  yes , why would they not be able to ? 
  do you completely lack empathy ? 
  that 's worse, 
  labour wanted a reduction in immigration last election too ... 
   you literally have no understanding of class . 
  working class people is n't just the class of people who work . 
  that is what we call the labour force . 
  working class specifically refers to people who work for a wage . 
  class is in how you were raised . 
  working class people with money are still working class . 
  upper class people that are poor are still upper class . 
   no , it 's not . 
  here 're the numbers for anyone interested . 
  which totally ignores population growth over that time . 
  and look at the difference in the curve . 
  in 2009 it heavily flattens . 
   greece had a sovereign debt crisis : they borrowed to much and the government was unable to pay it back . 
  i 'm not sure what else you need . 
  italy and spain are in the same boat with ballooning public debt .
