  it 's just spending more than the government gets in taxes . 
  the government never actually has to print any money . 
  the government does n't have to borrow anything . 
  the government 's budget is not like yours , or mine . 
  it 's not a balance sheet , and it does n't have to finance expenditure with borrowing . 
   it still lowers the exchange rate, 
  which is good for our export-based economy . 
   if you do n't match the amount of qe to the amount of extra growth then you will have inflation . 
  which i said about a dozen times in my post . 
   if you wanted to stimulate the economy you would lower the ocr first . 
  if you wanted to stimulate the housing market you would lower the ocr . 
  government surplus . 
  a government surplus is by definition a private sector deficit . 
  you 're using a marxist definition of class instead of the normal english definition of class . 
  not my problem . 
  new zealand is not going to default on its debts any time soon . 
  my suggestion would not cause the nzd to ` plummet ' . 
  i 've already explained about a dozen times i 'm not suggesting that nz just print money willy nilly . 
  just that we continue to deficit spend , within reasonable limits , for the benefit of everyone . 
  the mythical idea that surpluses are good and deficit spending is bad is moronic . 
  it 's a fucking national party policy . 
  anyone that thinks bill english is going to start coming out with good positive policies is a lunatic . 
   most insufferable earnest people in the world . 
  being earnest is a bad thing now ? 
   it 's interesting from a political strategy vs ideology standpoint, 
  not really . 
  it 's completely uninteresting . 
  every party does it , including national , labour is just open about it . 
   on the outside looking in , you really would have thought that labour would have cut losses and gone away from the idea after the shearer/cunliffe era man ban debacle . 
  there was no ` man ban debacle ' . 
  a few stuff commenters getting in a huff after not understanding something is not a debacle . 
   enforced 50/50 gender split, 
  which labour does n't have . 
  no remotely realistic polling result will give 50/50 gender split in labour . 
  whether they get 20 % or 50 % or somewhere in between they will not have a 50/50 split . 
   usually when you 're challenging an incumbant you want to focus on strong polling policy to strip votes away, 
  i think what you mean is ` labour should abandon what makes it labour in order to appeal to voters , completely defeating the point of voting for them in the first place ' , like national has done . 
  if you supported shipley-era nat policies , do you really think that english-era or key-era nats are at all similar ? 
  not at all . 
  no benefit cuts to really speak of , for example . 
   i 'm using a definition of class rooted in scientific evaluation of the world, 
  rooted in marxist ideology , actually . 
  when you want to say proletariat , say proletariat . 
  ` working class ' is a social phenomenon not an economic one . 
   you 're using the definition that was created by social elites in order to prevent people they deemed undesirable from entering society . 
  no i 'm using the definition that literally everyone in the uk , new zealand and australia uses . 
  when people say ` classless society ' they 're not saying ` everyone is completely equal ' they 're saying ` we do n't have strict distinctions between social classes like they did and do in britain ' . 
  being sincere in your convictions is irritating ? 
  ** culture ** . 
  ** nationality ** . 
  what else ? 
  our country is turning into an outpost of china . 
  the government does n't do anything non-essential . 
  that 's just a really weird viewpoint . 
  it 's a very sad one too . 
  i hope it is n't the opinion of most new zealanders that honest , sincere people are ` annoying ' . 
  it used to be that being dishonest was considered a flaw for politicians . 
   worse employees, 
  this is a good thing . 
  ` bad employees ' = good people , willing to stand up to employers that expect too much . 
  uk and aussies are essentially already integrated when they arrive . 
  because those chinese people and the chinese people we get today are different . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recession < -- i.e. 
  contraction . 
  nothing to do with contracts, 
  deficits do n't * require * borrowing . 
  they government sells bonds ( i.e. 
  ` borrows ' ) to control interest rates and borrows foreign currency to control the exchange rate . 
  that 's unrelated to deficit spending . 
   marixsm is a science . 
  marxism is a political philosophy . 
   and where does this definition come from ? 
  19th century england and bourgeois and aristocratic social theorists who used it as a term of exclusion . 
  it 's used and has been used more by the lower class than the upper class . 
   the way we use class in england an new zealand is very different too . 
  boris johnson is considered middle class in england , he would not be considered middle class in new zealand by any stretch of the imagination . 
  that is why we need a scientific definition of class to understand social structures , because lay-definitions are liable to change person to person . 
  we are discussing social structures when we discuss the role one 's class plays in the place they have in a political party . 
  boris johnson would be considered middle class in new zealand by people whose idea of ` class ' has n't been corrupted by communists . 
   consider themselves to be new zealanders, 
  does n't make them new zealanders . 
   are citizens, 
  also does n't make them kiwis . 
   have culturally assimilated, 
  but they have n't though . 
  they have n't culturally assimilated . 
  many speak their own language at home , and spend most of their time with people of their own race . 
  the labour party aims to convince people to vote for their existing policies . 
  it 's not about being in power , it 's about a mandate for change . 
  being elected by becoming the other party is what national did , and you can tell . 
  if they did anything like what they did in their previous incarnation as a government they 'd be thrown out immediately . 
  national moved the entire political spectrum to the left . 
  labour ca n't move towards the centre as then it loses all its difference from national . 
  it 's insane to hear people claim labour has ` lurched left ' when that 's exactly what the working-for-families-retaining-nats have done . 
  just to confirm , are you saying that the definition of a species is the possibility of fertile offspring ? 
  so donkeys and horses are different species because they always have sterile offspring , while being more similar visually than ( for example ) many breeds of dogs , but they * could * have fertile offspring so they 're one species ? 
  that 's very interesting . 
   deficit spending is almost always funded by borrowing, 
  it does n't have to be . 
  there 's no real requirement that it is .
