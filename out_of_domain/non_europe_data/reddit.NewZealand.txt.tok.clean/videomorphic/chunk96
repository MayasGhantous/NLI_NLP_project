  because they do n't want the ` kiwi dream ' of owning your own house to be thwarted by it having to compete as an investment with more productive investments . 
  i 've reported your highly rude post for harassment . 
  but to respond to your point , rather than your disgusting language , no proposal for teacher evaluation in new zealand has ever been backed by any sort of scientific evidence that it will result in improved teaching . 
  that is n't to say that such evaluation methods do n't exist , but they have never been presented by the government . 
  the government insists on using things like standardised test scores to measure teacher performance , and it 's * very * well-known that this will have a * negative * impact on education . 
  yeah they 're kind of awful . 
  new zealanders know that you ** must ** leave things as you found them . 
  it 's instilled into us constantly . 
  open gate ? 
  leave it open . 
  closed gate ? 
  leave it closed . 
  respect the environment . 
  respect the people that come after you . 
  * anyone * that does n't respect this , kiwi or otherwise , should be prosecuted , fined and deported at their own cost . 
  we have plenty of demand for tourism from people that will actually camp properly , or pay out hotel operators for rooms . 
  we do n't need ` freedom campers ' . 
   i think what most motorcyclists and truckers object to is that acc has chosen to target a few particular groups and punish them heavily, 
  it 's not ` punishment ' . 
  motorcyclists cost acc more , trucks cost acc more , they pay more . 
   cyclists get injured on the road all the time . 
  pedestrians also . 
  not motor vehicles , almost always it 's the fault of a car , bus or truck . 
   vehicle accidents involving suvs have significantly worse outcomes for third parties than most other car classes ,, 
  acc does n't levy you based on the outcome of others , but based on the outcome for you . 
  the ` third party ' will pay higher acc levies . 
   yet it costs slightly less to licence a ford explorer as it does a suzuki swift . 
  because the explorer is safer for you !, 
   you need a roof over your head ( its a need not a right ) ,, 
  it is , but * owning * the roof over your head unfortunately is n't a right in nz . 
  i 'd love to nz to still be a country where we have enough houses being built by the government that basically anyone can choose to buy one if they want , but that 's not modern nz unfortunately . 
   home ownership is vastly superior to renting, 
  it is in nz . 
  again this is a bit of an artefact . 
  it used to be that renting being shit did n't really matter to most people , because renters were either maori or students . 
  i know it 's horrible to say that , but that 's the reality of it . 
  most people did n't care if the dirt poor polynesians and students getting free uni had a shit time renting . 
  everyone else could buy a house . 
  these days renting is much more common , but we have * awful * renting laws and culture compared to somewhere like germany . 
  in germany most rentals are long-term . 
  you can renovate , repaint , really make it your own home . 
  you ca n't be told ` you have 6 weeks to get out ' just about any time . 
  think of it like our employment laws . 
  we do n't let employers just fire people whenever they like , with a few weeks notice . 
  you have to have a good reason , you have to give people a chance to improve , etc. 
  but we do n't apply the same rules to renting . 
  you can be evicted without good reason with a few weeks notice if they want to sell the property . 
  renting should be like employment : by default a permanent contract , not a fixed-term renewing-if-we-want contract . 
  we have two choices . 
  we can make home ownership something that * everyone * can achieve , or we can seriously , seriously improve our renting laws . 
  we should probably do both . 
  if we improved renting laws , being a landlord would be less appealing , which would increase housing stock a bit , and we could make lots of new houses at the same time . 
   owning a home and facing a cap gains tax if you sell does n't clash with other investments cause roof over head ( multiple dwellings sure ) ??? 
  but it does , though . 
  sure a lot of people seriously value owning their own home , but for some people they 'd * rather * have a long-term rental . 
  they 'd rather invest in other markets . 
  the problem is that our renting laws are so utterly , awfully , fucking terribly shit that those people are few and far between in nz . 
  if our renting laws were better , most young professionals in cities would probably rather have the same sort of contract on their apartment as their employment : permanent , they can quit with 6 weeks notice if they want to , but their employer/landlord has to put up with them until then unless they do something truly egregious . 
   proof ? 
  again , there is a vast number of studies and proposals in this field , you 've read all of them ? 
  your criticisms are backed by other studies ? 
  have your opinions been subject to peer review ? 
  because i can guarantee theirs have . 
  i 'm not talking about studies and proposals you complete egg , i 'm talking about what the ** government ** has proposed to ** teachers ** . 
  it 's not about what has been published in academic papers . 
  maybe there are good ideas out there , but the government has n't adopted them , and so the teachers union has rejected them . 
  it 's not that complicated . 
   every proposal has used standardised test scores ? 
  you mean to say that no government has ever made a proposal based on a different methodology , or are you simply falling for the trap of believing that if a government had , the unions would n't have opposed it ? 
  i literally have said that the government has never made a proposal to the union based on something that is actually proven to work . 
  not sure why you 're finding this so hard to understand . 
   i 'm sure the unions claim they all use a methodology that would end up being harmful , but the phrase conflict of interest hardly even covers the mountain of salt with which anything they say should be treated . 
  they do n't just ` say ' things . 
  they back them up with evidence . 
  that 's why the government has consistently backed down on this issue : they do n't actually have any basis for their proposals , and know that the proposals would n't survive the media blitz they 'd get if teachers went on any sort of significant strike over it . 
  i know that last point because my cousin works in the m. of ed . 
  yeah , but people really need * something * . 
  i 'd rather that kids learnt never to put any personal details on the internet , ** ever ** and also learnt a whole lot of idiotic bullshit corporate lies about copyright , than if they did n't learn the former and got all the truth about copyright , free speech and surveillance . 
  who would want to indefinitely rent in a country with renting laws as shit as ours ? 
  we have basically the worst renter laws in the western world . 
  they 're as bad compared to germany as the american employment laws are to what ours were before shipley key and bolger fucked them . 
   how mature of you to know when you 're wrong and to admit it . 
  yeah that was an overstatement . 
  nobody * as far as i 've ever seen * and * as far as the government seems to be concerned * knows . 
   that 's not an answer . 
  where are you getting that from ? 
  have you read every proposal in , say , the last 50 years ? 
  are you taking a guess hoping i wo n't call you on it ? 
  or are you just taking the union 's word for it ? 
  they have n't proposed it that many times and yeah i 've read the proposals . 
  i mean wow , i 'm in awe . 
  the cognitive dissonance is astonishing . 
  studies are baseless but the union , whose interest is solely the continued employment of their members , and has nothing to do with quality of education , has real evidence and facts on its side . 
  i mean maybe they occasionally commission their owns studies to contradict the government 's but i trust theirs about as much as i trust tobacco studies funded by malboro . 
  i never said studies were baseless you incoherent swine . 
  i said the government 's proposals were baseless . 
   now this is funny to me : `` they have no basis '' and `` the teachers would go on strike '' presented as one idea as if the two were even tangentially related . 
  that 's ... 
  i do n't know what that is , but it 's amazing all the same . 
  they are n't unreasonable .
