   how about expensive art , or jewelry ? 
  handbags go up in price too , are you going to tax those ? 
  yes , everything . 
  it applies to all assets . 
  they 're all clearly warriors that died in combat . 
  i literally have n't mentioned it once you enormous cunt . 
  of course , there are some genuinely justified ones . 
  an mmo developer has no real excuse for saying ` all wizards are human males ' , that 's just lazy , but saying ` all elves are female and all dwarves are male ' for precisely the reasons you gave would be fine , as long as it 's actually a worldbuilding thing and not a laziness thing . 
  i also have no problem with , for example , a witch class that is female-only , as long as it 's not just an excuse to make them hypersexualised and as long as it 's just a couple of classes out of a dozen or more , and it 's only classes that are ** heavily ** associated with that gender in existing lore . 
  that 's a terrible system . 
  no , you misunderstand . 
  it 's not a problem that it 's only available in a cash shop , it 's a problem that anything at all is available in a cash shop at all . 
  both irrelevant wow clones, 
  these do n't exist . 
  p2w and not f2p, 
   a p2p game nowdays is either a colossus baked by a huge franchise ( wow , ff , eso , gw2 ) or in time will end up f2p . 
  not true, 
  working for things in the game ! = ` free handouts ' . 
  no you do n't . 
  the green party is a left-wing social democratic party , the national party has opposite policies on * everything * . 
  what ? 
  the speed limit is 100 . 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  it 's an adjective . 
  it 's 20 % everywhere . 
  read the question . 
  aggregate is the same thing as concrete aggregate . 
  ` aggregate ' is a noun . 
   his party fell in behind it `` on the basis that when it comes to people who are on low incomes , something is better than nothing '' . 
  oh my god how can he be this financially illiterate ? 
   `` the fact that people who are , you know , earning low incomes are getting $ 5 a week back is why we are voting for this bill , because $ 5 a week when you have so little is absolutely necessary . '', 
  * and they get less public services you fucking stupid idiot * . 
  christ shaw is a moron . 
  the poor should n't be reliant on tax breakpoints changing ( for the main benefit of those earning over $ 70k/yr ) to get a bit more money . 
  the words are different but it 's exactly the same thing . 
  ` concrete aggregate ' is its full name , and its generally referred to as ` aggregate ' when it 's obvious what it means in context , which it is . 
   subsidies for a wide variety of tech companies who could have raised money on their own, 
  not being reduced by the fucking nats , obviously . 
   roads with no benefit/cost ratio calculations, 
  not being reduced by the fucking nats , obviously . 
   funding for sporting events, 
  not being reduced by the fucking nats , obviously . 
   armies of overpaid bureaucrats doing god knows what, 
  not being reduced by the fucking nats , obviously . 
   a completely unconditional superannuation , whether you 're retired or not, 
  not being reduced by the fucking nats , obviously . 
  it was entirely correct . 
  they 're entirely equivalent . 
  they 're literally the same thing . 
  if health had got a shitload more funding it would still be standing still because our population is booming . 
  we 're talking about the ** green party ** , a left-wing social democratic party . 
  they * do * support public services . 
  they voted yes to the government 's budget , which actively goes against their platform . 
   my point is that you 're operating on the assumption that all tax is 10/10 great because it 's spent on 10/10 great services , and it 's quite clear that that 's not always the case . 
  why the fuck would you think this ? 
  what moronic thinking do you have to do to get this from what i said ? 
  the budget did n't decrease funding for any of the bad things the government spends money it . 
  it decreased benefits relative to inflation . 
  it decreased the wages of the poor relative to inflation . 
  it just reduced taxes on the rich . 
  because they 're above all the bracket changes . 
  if you earn ( say ) $ 20000 , then $ 2000 of your income goes from the higher to the lower rate . 
  if you earn $ 24000 , then $ 6000 of your income goes from the higher to the lower rate . 
  ( assuming it was 24000 -  18000 for the change , which i think it was . ), 
  anyone that earns over the top tax rate gets the same absolute amount of tax cut , everyone below one of the new upper limits gets less , and worst of all ** everyone that earns below $ 14,000 / yr gets nothing , nada , zilch ** . 
  that means everyone that works part-time just a few hours per week . 
  it means the people that need money the most get nothing . 
  i agree, 
  benefits have n't gone up !, 
  there should be no ` pvp gear ' and ` pve gear ' . 
  there should just be items . 
  runescape does n't have ` pvp gear ' or ` pve gear ' ( and by ` runescape ' i mean ` runescape before it was shit i.e. 
  2007scape before they added things to it ' ) . 
   why enforce killing mobs over and over and over again ? 
  there are alternatives , such as . 
   tes/uo system , where skill improves upon using it and level is gained upon progressing x skill levels . 
  this is the same thing though , right ? 
  sure you get skill points/xp for * using swords * rather than * killing things * , but you are presumably using the swords * to kill things * so what 's the difference ? 
  the difference between ` skill improves and level = n skillups ' and wow 's levelling with xp is orthogonal , as well . 
  you can have totally normal xp and that you get by doing things instead of just by killing monsters , and you can have skill levels and character levels based on getting a certain number of skill levels where those skill levels only come from killing monsters . 
   eve system , where skill improves over time . 
  this just makes your power equal to the amount of time you 've played the game . 
  how could you ever catch up ? 
   chinese system , where you do non-combat tasks to earn exp into skill/level . 
  i do n't know what that means . 
  this sounds a bit like runescape , except runescape 's system is best described by what you call ` tes/uo ' , despite tes and uo having ** completely ** different systems . 
  so i 'm confused by what you mean . 
   so , why alternatives are worse than mob grind ? 
  well all chinese games i know of involve grinding mobs , and most mmorpgs do . 
  even good games like runescape ( when it was good , that is ) involved killing things over and over , and in a much more directly grindy way that wow . 
  the difference is that they were relatively passive and you did n't have to do bullshit quests that distracted you and wasted your time , and the combat was n't spammy rubbish like every game is today . 
   the reason we see mostly killing as the main source of leveling up is that for most people , the most enjoyable aspect of a rpg is the combat . 
  i would say ' [ citation needed ] ' but only douchebags do that . 
  in all seriousness , i disagree . 
  most mmorpg players play them for the combat because the combat is the only part of them that actually has any thought put into it . 
  good mmorpgs with deep systems outside of the very narrow area of combat had * lots * of players that did n't do much combat . 
  ` endgame ' should not exist , so the question is invalid . 
  world of warcraft absolutely has a pay-to-win cash shop . 
  what kind of moron thinks `` oh he said that combat was n't always the most fun part of every game , he obviously thinks there should be no combat at all !!!!!! '', 
  your kind , that 's what kind .
