people are downvoting you , but they should n't . 
  the us state dept. 
  's diplomat to the eu , victoria nuland , [ was recorded saying `` fuck the eu '' ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/06/us-russia-eu-victoria-nuland ) in a private conversation with the us ambassador to the ukraine . 
  the video showed up on [ youtube and/or liveleak ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mntxhxzplxi ) with russian subtitles yesterday ( or today depending on where you live ) . 
  i would n't be surprised if this is russia sending a message saying , `` we can do this shit too '' . 
  this is a situation between you and your partner and only ** your ** ( as in you * two * ) expectations of how to act towards one another matter . 
  it does n't matter what a bunch of strangers think , only whether or not you two are hurting each others ' feelings . 
  is this really what that hose is meant for ? 
  maybe a stupid question , but i do n't see a reason why it should be there ... 
  possibly . 
  i do n't see the fire hose sign , and honestly , i could think of many better places to put it than right next to the toilet . 
  the best kind of belgians are the waffle kind . 
  there 's nothing to call out !,

  you 're right that there 's a difference , but it 's not turning normal people into criminals . 
  i 'm norwegian and the legal limit to drive here is basically zero . 
  there is a margin of error in the measuring equipment ( which is a breathalyzer and not the weird exercises you see in the us ) , but that 's it . 
  as a result , we really do not have a problem with drunk driving and we 're far from the only country to do it this way . 
  you may have a valid point in saying there are greater distances in the us and it 's hard to get home , but this is also the case in norway . 
  we have a very low population density , so most people who go out will have driven in to town with a friend who is a driver for the night , or they will take a taxi . 
  it 's normal for people to charge $ 7 - $ 12 for a ride in to town and the same back if you 're friends with them . 
  a taxi driver at night could charge 10 times that depending on where you live . 
  despite this , we do n't have a problem of innocent people being criminals because of a strict dui law . 
  i was very surprised to learn that it was legal to have a beer and then drive home when i was in the us . 
  personally , i think what causes the large grey zone of dui in the us is that there are so many varying opinions on drunk driving , where a large section of the population believes it 's ok to have `` a little to drink '' and then drive home . 
  of course , the more one drinks , the harder it is to decide on what is `` a little '' . 
  of course , i do n't have a source on that - it 's just my personal theory . 
  well , she 's a snowboarder , not a beach volleyball player . 
  whether that 's a good thing or not is up for discussion ... 
  it 's really not a difference . 
  the us has a widely scattered population as well , so both our countries struggle to provide adequate public transport to the outlying regions . 
  if you live in a metropolis like new york , which has plenty of public transport and a very high population density , there is definitely no excuse to drink and drive . 
  like i said , i think the biggest challenge in america is to get the various different cultures around the country/states to agree that any drinking and driving should not be done . 
  being a melting pot has its benefits , but it makes it much harder to agree on any single issue . 
  i also think this is why zero tolerance for * anything * in most us states does n't work . 
  there will always be a significant part of the population that disagrees with the policy . 
  such polices require that there be zero tolerance in that country/state 's culture , and with the diversity present in most us communities , this is unlikely to happen in our lifetime . 
  it 's important to remember that european nations are ** generally ** composed of a homogenous group of people that share a single culture . 
  ** tl ; dr : duis is a problem in america that no amount of legislation can fix . 
  the same attributes that has given the us its strengths work against it on these issues because it is incredibly hard to get everyone to agree on a common goal . 
  in order for duis to stop , the culture needs to change and this takes time . 
  ** p.s : ** i may be the one misunderstanding you , but by `` population density '' i 'm referring to how spaced out people live geographically . 
  as an example and assuming you 're from wisconsin , the population density of wisconsin is 87 people/sq . 
  mile , while in norway ( which by the way has close to the same population as wi ) the density is 34 people/sq . 
  mile . 
  i do n't mean to sound condescending or anything , but it struck me that we may be confusing each other with the term . 
  i 'm probably a little late , but the ones i 've seen in use in the uk and the netherlands , look like this :, 
  the american and australian ones may be different , but personally , i have no problem with the image above . 
  the yellow squares showed my belt buckle and a piece of paper i had stuffed in a pocket . 
  my experience with them have been pretty good - if only they could figure out a way to do it without having people take of their shoes and coats !, 
  sounds about right . 
  if i were to take a taxi back to my home from a club , i 'd be looking at 565nok or around $ 92 . 
  then again , our beers are around $ 12 , so you can expect slightly higher prices . 
  it would be nice if whoever downvoted you would give an explanation . 
  i have no idea who anoxmous is , but it would be nice if those who have feelings for and against these suggestions would post a comment . 
  that you should n't . 
  a lot of the time , the child would be entitled to both citizenships . 
  however , for some countries , it 's not enough to be born in the country to be a citizen . 
  they typically require that one or both parents be citizens of that country . 
  the uae is particularly strict with this . 
  also , some countries allow you to have dual citizenships . 
  it 's pretty common among `` diplomat kids '' . 
  unfortunately , users of reddit has an expectation that everyone who does an ama should agree with their viewpoints . 
  the majority of people here wo n't understand that you ca n't be specific about which countries you like and which you do n't because there could easily be a headline somewhere saying , `` us diplomat claims < country x  is < y  '' . 
  i never realized he said that . 
  i must have auto-crorrected it in my mind this entire time . 
  this may be a silly question , but i was at olive garden in phoenix when i lived there with a few friends ( we were all foreigners ) and we all liked it very much . 
  however , it seems to have a reputation on reddit that i just ca n't work out . 
  every time it is mentioned , people jump on it like an inside joke . 
  could you help me and explain the enigma that is olive garden ? 
  i had n't heard of it before , but if you put yourself a little into her situation , it 's not much of a code to break . 
  either way , a dinner date is a shitty date unless you 're both interested in trying something in particular there . 
  you 'll be waiting ( possibly a long time ) and you have to find a way to keep a conversation going for that time . 
  to me , that 's just too much work . 
  instead , i usually take her to do something childish , but fun . 
  rollercoasters , bumper cars , bowling , fair-type activities , etc. 
  are much better because you 're both gon na be having fun ** and you 're gon na be physical ** . 
  there is no way in hell you can get physically comfortable with a strange girl in a formal restaurant , 
  to add to this , a technical understanding of websites and good browsing habits would be similar to the pulling out method - it works until it does n't . 
  in my case , i use [ firefox ] ( https://www.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/new/ ) with addons like [ noscript ] ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/noscript/ ) , [ abp ] ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/adblock-plus/ ) , [ wot ] ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/wot-safe-browsing-tool/ ) and [ disconnect ] ( https://disconnect.me/ ) , which is like using a custom made condom molded after my own dick from the latest nano-fibers . 
  if i combine that with the pulling out method described above , i consider myself fairly protected . 
  i do n't have , and have n't needed to use , the morning after pill . 
  the problem is not finding a more secure service - the problem is having friends who care . 
  how about :, 
  streetlamp wait-for-it mclaughlin, 
  so is this the new skymall ? 
  long live the templars !, 
  they were fired . 
  at least according to the current top comment . 
  i 'm sure you 're right about it in some countries , but `` europe '' is n't exactly a place where everyone speaks the same language . 
  considering that they 're paying for their own schooling , is this really a problem ? 
  at least in europe , all flights are officially timed in utc, 
  it is and it is not . 
  gmt is an old standard established at the time of the british empire . 
  as of january 1 ^ st 1972 , utc ( zulu ) is the official reference time in aviation . 
  all times in aviation in europe ( and it seems also in the us ) are officially in utc . 
  when an airplane makes a position report ( not too common anymore , but occasionally used ) , it reports the time in utc . 
  when air traffic control gives a slot to an aircraft , all times used are utc . 
   i am assuming you mean a button or two open so that other people can see this . 
  i do n't actually .
