  damn , priest and mages with mc and pyroblasts everywhere giving me all sorts of terminal diseases . 
  naah , arena is so random , i 've never seen anyone with more than 1 pyroblast . 
  there 's all sorts of classes and decks in arena , while in constructed , atleast in my last 8-12 games , i met 1 hunter , rest mages and priests . 
  i 've had [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fzlayj2.jpg ) link laying around for a couple of weeks , which some guy made . 
  more choice is good eh ? 
  this particular warlock aggro deck has gotten me to rank 11 , possibly higher . 
  the `` niche '' here is basically alot of small minions , and then stormwind champion + frostwolf warlord for the late game punch . 
  so my question would be if you agree with the frostwolf warlord pick . 
  sometimes it 's dead weight , and sometimes it 's a 10/10 at turn 5 . 
  edit : shit , here 's the link : http://i.imgur.com/3cuenrp.png . 
  thank you for reminding me . 
  it 's basically good for when you have zero cards , as you said , which is quite often since you got so many low cost creatures . 
  i 'm going to agree , but as i do not own even one argent commander , it 's not exactly an alternative . 
  agree about the defender of argus . 
  guess i 'll be using another batch of dust , but ey , what else do i use em for . 
  that change a while ago . 
  blood is now a tank with the niche of self-healing , while both frost ( duel wielding ) and unholy ( 2-hand , diseases ) are dps specs . 
  ooooh , my bad . 
  i main a mistweaver monk , and no one in my guild are death knights . 
  [ turn 7 hunter baby ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dr9viwu.png ) , quick games till i get harder opponents around rank 10 . 
  all credit to [ the_ark ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1tlfcn/ranked_legend_as_hunter_currently_19th_in_na_turn/ ) . 
  if i had leeroy i would swap him with an argent commander/rocketeer in a hearthbeat , tho arcane golems are nice substitutes , 
  i do n't know man , riots replay system took a while to get implemented ... oh wait . 
  hey thanks , i 'll be sure to link this to my friends if they 're gon na start when the open beta in eu arrives . 
  eeey , i got [ golden sylvanas ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tlslmqw.png ) too a while ago . 
  crafted nat pagle and leeroy for my shaman deck . 
  so the nord is jorunn the skald-king and the altmer is ayrenn ? 
  or am i wrong ? 
  but who is the breton ? 
  not high king emeric i suppose . 
  thanks for answering , but is he ? 
  is n't mannimarco an altmer mage in oblivion . 
  and concept art of him released for eso shows him as an altmer too . 
  alternatively , make a na account . 
  can you or anyone else remind me what the hotkey for rodeoing and hitching a ride on a titan is ? 
  i 've been stepped on far too many times trying to remember . 
  another norwegian passing by . 
  yeaah . . no , if i know kripp right he 'll probably do the give-aways as fast as possible . 
  oh wow , thank you , til . 
  damn , i read some of thoose threads for fun . 
  did n't know so many , uh , religious extremists frequented the imdb boards . 
  though it was mostly the same 5 people repeating the same thing . 
  a classic one : `` i feel really bad for people that think the stars were created by nothingness . 
  i shed a tear for you . 
  anyway , stop being so sad and dark and depressed haha , find god you fool . '', 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucf0pvplsi8r5kcaqgtorqoa ) might do it . 
  it 's the `` popular on youtube - worldwide '' page . 
  there 's also one for your own country . 
  [ non-subtitled ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blfvsdurxvg&amp;feature=related ) , but i guess it 'll give you an idea of how it is . 
  auchindoun looks sweet . 
  probably my collection of various pig statues and pig art ... 
  damn , i suck at swimming . 
  drowning after 4 seconds even though i scrolled like a madman . 
  i went today . 
  a little bit more than a 3 hour queue . 
  not that large , just a medium sized room , but the occulus rift thing was kinda great . 
  experiencing the occulus and falling down the wall all in one . 
  any one can go . 
  i saw 5-8 year old kids at the exhibition in oslo . 
  this reminds me of `` the wall '' from game of thrones . 
  why do n't the mongolians/wildlings just take a swimming detour . 
  god damn it . 
  many here says that chile deserved to win , and i get that , they were the underdog and fought hard . 
  as a neutral i kinda cheered on brazil because of the home turf and all . 
  but is it really the minority opinion here to say that brazil overall played the best game and had the best chances ? 
  a worthy ending imo . 
  close game , good chances , but the german powerhouse won in the end . 
  congratulations from a guy in norway . 
  you sure ? 
  i 'm playing on a pre-patch game , now updated to 1.7 , and i can choose from all the new ideas . 
  it 's hard to charge an ipad while you 're sitting on the toilet . 
  you , i like you . 
  praise the lord of laziness . 
  you 're a wizard , tarei, 
  got a link to the new swedish banknotes ? 
  tried to google it , not sure what i saw . 
  well , they 're definitely ... in your face , kinda . 
  thank you . 
  i guess it 's the combination of him loving me , occupying 50 % of lithuania and remembering to toggle `` give provinces in peace deal '' . 
  [ tbarw extra : transparent political mapmode .

  my god , this changes everything !, 
  well , one way to get around the -3 diplo rep right after annexing a vassal is to just time the diplomatic annexations to end at the same month in the same year . 
  i annexed 3 vassals at the same time this way , did n't have to wait 30 years . 
  you have to be an european country to get cardinals right ? 
  or atleast it seems so , as my christian kongo kinda feels left out . 
  oh , i guess my odds are n't so great , since only 1/63 provinces are +5 basetax . 
  oh well , cleanse heresy everywhere !, 
  i 'll try this thing this year for the first time . 
  sounds fun . 
  heh , that took 10 seconds to fill out , and since i just played the heroes of the storm tutorial a few hours ago , i got full house on blizzard games . 
  just praying , maybe being a blizzard veteran helps . 
  but honestly , after being hyped for it many months ago , i ca n't even be arsed to play a game now that i got it ... and the bug that kicks me out when i want to play vs. anything but bots , 
  humpf , the swedes stole the viking with the scottish accent . 
  now what are we norwegians going to use ;( damn you meatballs . 
  i propose a cybernetic moose . 
  so , is there any accent in britain that comes close to tracers ' accent ? 
  maybe it 's a british voiceactor just overdoing it . 
  what 's the mark for anyway ? 
  i 'm aware there is a world record attempt going on , but it 's not at 200k flat is it ?
