  erry day , son, 
  what was the joke ? 
  thank jebus i 'm about 250lbs . 
  boyd belt wise . 
  so a capitalist terrorist then ? 
  milk and burger machine, 
  cool guitar !, 
  just about every border town . 
  not to rain on your parade here , guy . 
  i think you will find * most * women to be quite different than you during your life . 
  just check it out , might work , might not . 
  who knows ? 
  and i think i should be legally able to kick your child molester ass . 
  same same . 
  sharp , witty , still an asshole . 
  when the sarcasm escapes the audience , is it still sarcasm ? 
  is that your password ? 
  source ? 
  take a wild guess, 
  did n't really have a choice . 
  one of my first memories was my grandma playing me songs and singing along . 
  my parents gave me a kiddy guitar when i was about six , it ' s been a constant thing ever since . 
  well , those * idiots * had their land taken from them . 
  all this time browsing reddit, 
  football manager . 
  months ... 
  nudge the wig, 
  she must think people are really fucking stupid though, 
  worked like a charm in the us, 
  when i got a concussion , my doctor said absolutely no training for a month . 
  focus on not quitting, 
  attacks ? 
  throwing rocks against one of the most high tech military forces in the world ? 
  surely you must see the motivation to get their lands back , just because 1948 was a while ago . 
  maybe he should go to aa, 
  tapout and mma related clothing . 
  nope . 
  elitist white hipster . 
  check , check and check . 
  instant motivation right here . 
  child birth , it 's insane . 
  i seriously have this asshat in one of my uni classes . 
  he usually brings a tupperware full of carrots to class and will eat them all . 
  i 'm going to murder him . 
  agreed . 
  i train bjj , and i do n't have any `` genre '' clothing . 
  the exception being the dudes at my gym who get sponsorships , but they are legit mma fighters . 
  that makes two of us , i guess . 
  not racist at all i see !, 
  i 've worn them ... * at jiu jitsu training *, 
  i 'm sure your feet are pleasant to talk to . 
  i think you get a pass . 
  well , for a guy with a obviously made up name , i guess that grammar is on point . 
  by using the gift of sight, 
  ... as a white guy who lived in a predominantly immigrant neighborhood for the last 10 years , i can relate . 
  that was the joke . 
  i 'm finding that i 'm explaining jokes for reddit quite often . 
  either a ) i 'm not funny , or 2 ) reddit users are denser than average . 
  death : our nations no. 1 killer . 
  impossible, 
  i beg to differ, 
  have you noticed he looks exactly like mr. bean ? 
  the role he plays ... much like every rags husband roy keane used to play, 
  how ? 
  otamendi is well hard, 
  it ' be called rivalry , mon. 
  probably mention it in the application . 
  just state in an eventual interview that you were planning forward . 
  they love that . 
  hazard to real next season then . 
  you could almost be tempted to say ... 
  * bravo ? 
  grew up pentecostal too . 
  i totally see your point . 
  two of my cousins married at 18-19 , both got into bad situations , one was beaten by her husband , the other got in serious debt . 
  both of them had three kids , and both are divorced now luckily ( and `` out '' by all accounts , i do n't keep up with my family ) . 
  i hear your story and it rhymed with the backward 50ies thinking in that community , especially for women . 
  i just anna say : you 're not `` decent enough '' , you 're a hero for getting out . 
  ** a fucking hero ** , because i know how hard it is . 
  yeah , it 's all fronts . 
  your reputation defines who you are , and so many people live miserable lives under the surface . 
  like the one `` family guy '' who eventually turned out to be be gay and was ostracized by the whole church . 
  or the real estate guy in church who was embezzling money , and had to go to jail for a couple years ( * that * was okay to the church though ) . etc etc, 
  this band is fucking brilliant . 
  oh , you mean oilrealm , the richest country in the world ? 
  the oil , the beaches , they gots it all . 
  quick task : do you see a pattern here ? 
  a girl has no name . 
  plot twist : you are a woman ? 
  personally : much better . 
  world wise : a lot worse . 
  the dark ages were * sooo * drab . 
  we supposed to guess the brand ? 
  who killed jfk, 
  he misses joe obviously, 
  in the first few steps you clearly see him holding on with his penis, 
  never , and i mean ** never ** , talk shit about nic cage . 
  am i insane , or does navas ' physique not exactly shout `` defender '' ? 
  i mean , he 's fast , but still .
