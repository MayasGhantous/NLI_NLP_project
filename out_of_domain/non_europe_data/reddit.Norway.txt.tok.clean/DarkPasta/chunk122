  that is actually `` pacing up '' the physical space with them , 20 steps to here , theres a door here , the mats is there , etc , etc. 
  if he uses one , it 's used outside . 
  you will need to address this in regards to the other students , and also if he intends to use it inside ( you know because of germs on the mats ) . 
  b ) dog . 
  if he has one , you will need to address this . 
  seeing eye dogs are usually highly trained , but are still dogs and you dont want a dog on the mats . 
  fourth : does he have a sighted person with him ? 
  if a trained professional comes with the student , you can work out a plan with them . 
  feel free to ask if you have more questions . 
  they also have three times the population . 
  til sterlings middle name is shaq, 
  thanks for keeping it civil . 
  just because china highly and disproportionately pollutes a lot per capita , does n't vindicate the u.s ' complete lack of a dignified and rational response to this problem . 
  and any kind of `` freedom , bro '' response will only further underline my point . 
  cool , well it 's kinda hard to explain over the internet , but i think you 'll do fine . 
  especially since its a close proximity activity , i think she 'll be fine . 
  only thing thats different is the obvious use of different senses , and most blind people i 've worked with are very adept at overcoming their obstacles . 
  only thing is that new environments usually present some kind of challenge . 
  and , by the way , i think its rad that she wants to do this , it shows a lot of courage from her part . 
  if you go to a coffee shop ( and you will ... ) get the * mild * weed . 
  trust me . 
  the `` super '' stuff is for grey bearded 60 year old hippies that know how to handle it . 
  you do n't wan na end up in a canal . 
  have you heard of the artist formerly know as prince ? 
  dismissing the internet as a fad was one of his * few * blunders . 
  tell them you wan na get married and have kids * asap *, 
  well , then i think `` run '' is a good strategy . . 
  i know a person with a pink unicorn riding a rainbow on her leg . 
  she gets questions . 
  i 'll just say something controversial : most home cooked meals made from scratch are mostly 99 % healthy . 
  even pizza . 
  just stay away from processed food and you 'll be fine . 
  the major point being the * from scratch * part . 
  ill informed political statements, 
  i have 2 full sleeves , full chest and one leg pretty much covered . 
  i hate questions , or i dont * hate them * , just sick of questions basically . 
  especially `` how much did that cost ? 
  '' , and `` did it hurt ? 
  staying up late . 
  turns out , now that we have kids , all i want to do is sleep . 
  hodor, 
  how would they know ? 
  cool story , bro, 
  op needs to read history, 
  i do n't * hate * the usa , in fact a few of my very best friends are americans . 
  but i strongly dislike two things about the `` american general mentality '' . 
  guns . 
  honestly . 
  you have a law that literally causes about 12.000 gun deaths a year . 
  it 's not * freedom * , it 's an antiquated law from the 18th century with severe repercussions . 
  i believe eddie izzard said it best : `` guns do n't kill people , but the gun * helps * '' . 
  consumer culture . 
  ads everywhere , every second . 
  a mentality where a 5 year old car is `` old '' , and a fucking apple is packed in cellophane . 
  it 's an economy based on getting people to spend money they do n't have on shit they do n't need . 
  and it 's ruining the planet . 
  the us military industry is the world 's largest arms exporters . 
  thats a massive amount of money and influence . 
  they do n't care where they get their money from . 
  commence touching orbs and `` dancing '' with swords . 
  death is big business . 
  source ? 
  i do n't need one . 
  i 'm made of steel . 
  those are the boogey men . 
  for the moment . 
   war is a celebration of the markets, 
  i need to read pynchon, 
  agreed to the nth degree, 
  fucking amazing record . 
  uh , no . 
  it takes another kind of balls to physically kill somebody with your hands . 
  the gun takes the guts and humanity out of the equation . 
  your claim is bullshit . 
  i dont care if you like me on the internet , its * way * easier to shoot somebody than to go guts deep . 
  that takes a whole different kind of crazy . 
  any 100 pound , 22 year old college girl could shoot ( 6 ' 3 '' , 250 lbs , 12 years doing martial arts ) me , but stab me or choke me out ? 
  fuck no . 
  that takes physicality , determination and balls . 
  9/10 of murders would * disappear * . 
  your logic is faulty . 
  is it me , or dont thruxtons come with barend mirrors ? 
  they ask if you 've ever been affiliated with the east india company . 
  nope , it 's the east india company . 
  `` e.i.c '' was * literally * their ** logo ** . 
  too bad he never got a real chance for us . 
  this would be extremely useful for blind people . 
  i was just thinking about this !, 
  i was born in 1976 , and started my first `` punk '' band in 1989 , age 13 . 
  well , the clash broke up in \u00b4 86 , and that felt like an `` old '' band at the time . 
  little did i know . 
  no wonder i 'm rolling my eyes at these millennials who 've never heard of fugazi . 
  aka `` men with small dicks '' . 
  or , you know , do something else . 
  doc !, 
  the worst thing is all the attention he gets from his stupid fucking agenda . 
  what we have here is a jedi master, 
  binary handwriting, 
  well , she backed up at some point . 
  it was not a good decision .
