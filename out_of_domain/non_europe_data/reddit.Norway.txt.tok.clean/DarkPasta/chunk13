  looks like she lost some peanuts earlier, 
  jennifer tillyyyyyy ... zzzip, 
  i 'm going with basic instinct . 
  multiple scenes . 
  multiple faps . 
  this is a social setting where you can scream your ass off for 90 minutes , curse at grown men , behave like a 13 year old , swear like a sailor and sing childish songs about other people , just based on their geographical affiliation . 
  that , and it 's a universal subject for conversations with people from all walks of life . 
  i 'm talking about football , or * soccer * for the yanks . 
  shut up and get me a beer !, 
  i 'm a smart ass, 
  you get great core strength and a monster cardio workout . 
  when are n't they ? 
  they finally got the phantom blot, 
  do n't be , it 's all fun !, 
  100 in what currency ? 
  `` if you have n't had one , * you were him * '', 
  bas rutten already exists, 
  eagle vs shark , wierdest film i ever saw . 
  drums at blast beat speed . 
  first song : hellfire , 1349, 
  whos your favorite spongebob character ? 
  yes , he just had a drum off with will ferrell from redhotchilipeppers, 
  yoga ? 
  are you sure ? 
  well , in `` spiritual '' terms . 
  it creates a form of * way * to meditation . 
  i find myself often floating away ( for lacking a better term ) during yoga . 
  just google yoga and your area . 
  i 'm lucky because my wife is an instructor , so * going to yoga * means going to the living room . 
  i have n't read any yoga books , i 'm afraid . 
  my main thing is jiu jitsu , and i `` use '' yoga to become more flexible . 
  the * spiritual * side came along as a bonus !, 
  100 camels are worth a ton in prison . 
  indeed i am !, 
  in solitude from sweden . 
  i love the manto x. 
  great , snug fit and rip stop pants . 
  cheap too . 
  i like the x so much i have two , one blue and one white . 
  good guy rock stars !, 
  great to see !, 
  people clearing their throat . 
  the mkm does not shrink fyi . 
  not one iota . 
  i value bass players just as much as the other players . 
  take joe lally in fugazi for example . 
  he defines the sound of the band . 
  or the bass player form interpol , carlos d. his sound and basslines * make * that band . 
  groundhog day . 
  it just gets better each time you see it . 
  groundhog day . 
  it just gets better each time you see it . 
  thats all i know . 
  here lies wisdom . 
  lost in translation, 
  `` damn , darkpasta let himself go . 
  did n't he ? '', 
  i somehow implied smoking was bad for you . 
  smokers did n't like that onje bit . 
  pepsi or coke ? 
  converge, 
  i have it in white , and all the stitching etc. 
  is in purple , which makes it look preety damn sweet imo . 
  the cut is pretty big , so if in doubt about sizes , go smaller . 
  i like the cut on the manto better than the koral i have ... 
  the arms are pretty long too ... 
  `` god put dinosaur bones in the ground to test us '' , unfriend, 
  whoop, 
  a hoax , * a hoax * . 
  plus , 9/11 man . 
  building 7 . 
  believe !, 
  and that 's how you make `` an emo '' . 
  `` well looky here , looks like we got ourselves a reader '' - bill hicks, 
  the jury is out on that one , bro . 
  / r/sociology might be a good place for this question, 
  my favorite coffee mug at home has a picture of mr. bean and the caption `` babe magnet '' over it . 
  i think this is a common crush . 
  * sounds reasonable *, 
  i got your back, 
  this question is like drawing a picture , showing it to your family and saying `` this picture is ugly , right ? '', 
  ewan macgregor is my choice . 
  you mean * practising * ? 
  the best gift you could give yourself is a ( serious ) tag, 
  area 51 . 
  of course they would cover up a visit from other planets . 
  * it would only be the biggest fucking discovery in human history * .

  * then i had another * .
