  i guess i have more than i thought . 
  i 'd say 10 close friends . 
  i ca n't do one . 
  i do a `` scandinavian trying to speak american english '' one , and it seems to work fine . 
  i feel at home . 
  self deprecating humor, 
  i do n't post opposite thread questions on askreddit, 
  youre very welcome . 
  i can see him bagging 72 goals . 
  well , i know who my 3rd striker on fpl is now . 
  ah , the famous seattle , oregon . 
  that marcelo tackle was n't anywhere near the ball . 
  maybe they did n't catch the news in bham, 
  someone does n't like you . 
  2 times a week has been my average the last 3 years . 
  i 'm 41 and i have 2 kids and a mortgage . 
  that 's how much i can do , coach still gave me my blue 6 months ago . 
  do n't sweat it . 
  on my old bonnie i was once approached by two cops at a gas station while i was filling up . 
  all they wanted to know was what the bike was , and that they liked it . 
  little did they know i had an illegal downloaded dvd of lethal weapon 3 in my pack . 
  close call . 
  `` you can not fail , unless you quit . 
  so do n't quit '' . 
  - unknown wise man, 
  fake news , of course . 
  too bad about your user name op, 
  kdb is the premier leagues best post hitter . 
  unrivaled . 
  please do n't remind me of that . 
  they 're in for drinkwater . 
  manc messi innit,

  r/soccer collective of 14 year olds : coutinho is overrated . 
  * signs for barca *, 
  r/soccer collective of 14 year olds : coutinho is god . 
  now , 10,000 james collins shirts sold would have been * something *, 
  grate tatto !, 
  you have great taste thurr, 
  maybe call a doctor instead of posting here ? 
  football is the right word for `` soccer '' . 
  football !, 
  i get hung over for * two * days now , not one . 
  samir nasri ( ... / s * obviously * ), 
  you always need the / s , mate . 
  fact is , that chelsea squad consists of one premier league winning first xi , and a bench of * very close * to that in quality . 
  to say that 's a `` thin squad '' when virtually all of them are good enough to be starters in almost every pl team is quite an exaggeration . 
  a pre enlightenment book about aristotelian philosophy ? 
  this is quite something * highly * interesting . 
  i do n't know how many of you guys listen to punk and hardcore , but there were a couple of records that completely changed what the rules were , and how to approach aggressive and ( often ) political loud music . 
  i 'm talking about the late nineties/early 2000s here , and older punks will disagree . 
  but i can only comment about my own experience . 
  ** botch ** - * we are the romans * made highly technical almost progressive hardcore , inspiring generations of later horrible math core bands . 
  botch members went on to form equally inspiring bands like russian circles , minus the bear and these arms are snakes . 
  ** refused ** - * the shape of punk to come * broke a lot of `` rules '' , incorporating samples , classical and techno music into what became a game changing record . 
  these swedes broke all the rules with style . 
  ** at the drive-in ** - * relationship of command * was the first really `` huge '' hardcore record ( produced by ross robinson ) , and blended new rhythm and a more artistic way to approach the scene, 
  ** converge ** - * jane doe * - converge , to me , stand apart from all genres and scenes as just simply the best heavy band in the world , right now . 
  i never tire of their output , they 're endlessly inventive , exciting , weird , vicious , and this record is just plain fucking brilliant, 
  indeed , i did an introductory course at uni on the history of ideas and learning what educational traditions thinkers like descartes and hume were submitted to , makes their contributions to modern rationality that more impressive . 
  of course . 
  but not the point . 
  this is a textbook from a time where education only existed in the context of the church , and having an original from that time is quite something . 
  and you need to take your insecurities out on other people . 
  do you honestly believe coutinho would reject playing with the likes neymar , thiago silva , verratti , dimaria , thiago motta , draxler , cavani and last but not least , the obvious cream of the crop and newcastle legend hatem ben arfa ? 
  not to mention the obvious pay rise . 
  norwegian ~ ~ oil money ~ ~ tv , ( i mean women ) is apparently more good looking . 
  i was listening to this record on the bus today !, 
  i 'm sure that thing corners real well . 
  you should check out the keepers on netflix . 
  there are some seriously fucked up clergymen out there . 
  i 'm sorry but i laughed hard when an international ba gets you fewer points than an american ba . 
  i have a ba from a top 10 european university , and an american with a ba in graphic design from sam yokel college gets one point on me . 
  i think op is calling out `` girly '' or `` gay '' cars . 
  great dad joke !, 
  we do n't give two shits , how bout that ? 
  love , europe . 
  what does the `` h '' in jesus h. christ stand for ? 
  the case is the selling point for me . 
  get the one with the case . 
  this is very metal, 
  define christian . 
  is it a churchgoer ? 
  well , my right hand has some sad stories to tell in that case . 
  cracker . 
  til all europeans are the same . 
  if you like that blackened death thing , maybe check out black breath , the secret ( an italian band ) or zyklon ( from norway ) ? 
  i 'm jealous .
