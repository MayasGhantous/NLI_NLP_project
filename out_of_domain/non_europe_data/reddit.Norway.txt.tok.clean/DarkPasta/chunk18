  weirded me out , `` i know what you did ... '' kinda * scream 2 * vibe going on there 1800jesusboy . com, 
  you are correct, 
  of course !, 
  it 's our 5 month anniversary !, 
  seems like a stretch ... 
  nice !, 
  i just told him to go fuck a mule . 
  ugh . . good call !, 
  where are you from ? 
  get something that represents your city or country, 
  my eldest daughters first sentence was `` fuck the car , daddy '' . 
  it happens . 
  she really is . 
  the us secretary of defense is currently hiding a war boner behind his desk . 
  every time she swears , i start laughing . 
  it 's actually becoming a problem . 
  she swears like a sailor , and she 's 3 . 
  totally . 
  i 'm 38 years old , and every time my eldest kid swears i 'm like `` my precious '' . 
  haha , fuck the car - as in * fuck * the car ? 
  i hope that 's not what my 3 year old meant !, 
  i do n't understand the reference . 
  too old . 
  only this is r/bjj, 
  til : i spend too much time on r/dadjokes , should check rest of reddit, 
  moustache or goatee ? 
  or * both * ? 
  a vote for the ukips is to pour gas on the fire . 
  i tend to think of religion as : spend your whole life making your own coffin . 
  sand it , polish it , paint it . 
  make gold trim for it . 
  and rejoice in the fact that * once your finally dead * it 's all going to be all right . 
  your faith is the longing for your beloved grave , the death-cult . 
  never mind the actual life you have at your disposal . 
  ukips are a hair away from fascists . 
  this thread disgusts me . 
  great arguments . 
  why do n't you go hide in your little selfish ukip cave . 
  the islamic state is not a recognised state, 
  lucky you 're not then, 
  why bring handguns into this ? 
  what you 're arguing is the standard `` political correctness gone mad '' argument . 
  ukips are still bigots regardless of rhetoric, 
  you assert that i am * stupid * from one sentence of information . 
  the ol' switcharoo , aye ? 
  simplify it for me further !, 
  * swoon * . 
  your massive intellect must surely be capable of generalizing even further . 
  and that justifies being bigoted . 
  well , if * they do it , it must be ok ... *, 
  if your qualifier is * thatit 's ok when lots of people agree on stuff * , then we are miles apart here . 
  sorry , my comment was directed at / u/skotch22, 
  i 'm a big guy . 
  people often ask if i ever worked as a bouncer . 
  the answer is `` yes '' . 
  do you dislike apple computers ? 
  quick !, 
  do you do mma ? 
  `` they say that ` guns do n't kill people , people kill people . ', 
  well i think the gun helps . 
  if you just stood there and yelled bang , i do n't think you 'd kill too many people . '' - eddie izzard, 
  the alien in * alien * ( 1979 ), 
  kinda not the point . 
  that a gun simplifies the * act of killing * - and if you had to do it by hand , or by your example with a knife - i maintain less people would kill , or even have a * fighting chance * to actually kill somebody else . 
  the gun makes something that is hard to do ( kill by hand , stare somebody in the eye and take their life ) , much easier . 
  and then we have n't even touched upon ethics yet . 
  how does him being the son of an immigrant and being married to a german woman disqualify me from calling ukip policy racist , xenophobic and misogynic ? 
  no , the definition of democracy is not that * a lot of people agree * , it 's that through elected representatives you have a constitution that guarantees basic personal and political rights , fair and free elections , and independent courts of law . 
  that 's democracy . 
  the basic premise is that * you have to listen to what i say too * . 
  that 's the fucking point , sir . 
  is that a motoguzzi ? 
  same size as you and this 16 year old little sinewy fucker keeps escaping * everything * i throw at him during rolls . 
  i ca n't wait to get this little fucker , ** kidding ** . 
  but really . 
  keep going . 
  then keep going . 
  you can get good gi 's online for as little as $ 50 . 
  where 's the rebel alliance version ? 
  check out fuji . 
  inexpensive and good quality . 
  it would be extremely painful ... 
  i know how to use my hands , if that 's ok . 
  i used my degree in sociology . 
  i do n't need a dictionary to define democracy, 
  honestly sir , the argument you are presenting is quite confusing . 
  you can still be a fascist despite coming from a specific heritage . 
  that 's rich . 
  before finding my current ( and awesome ) gym , i went to a couple free classes - and one of the places was like you describe , people going balls out , not giving a shit about safety . 
  * the instructor was an ass * , and people just seemed to be into that macho-ego bullshit . 
  i left that place with a sprained neck , and a * wtf was that * feeling . 
  needless to say , i did ` nt go back . 
  you should seriously consider ** not ** going back to a place that compromises your safety . 
  same thing , only i 'm 38 . 
  ` tis but a scratch !, 
  started in june this summer . 
  i 'm 38 . 
  i did tkd before , but was out of shape , was about 240-250lbs at 6 ' 3 '' . 
  now i 'm about 230 , and lost 3 '' solid inches around the gut . 
  and i 've started tapping people !!!,
