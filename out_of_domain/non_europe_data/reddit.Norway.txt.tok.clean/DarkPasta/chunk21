  i ask him what is going on . 
  no reply , he just slaps the back of my head . 
  then suddenly his radio goes off , ( by the way - all the time he 's got his knee buried in my upper back - and i 'm bleeding from my mouth ) , and i hear a dispatcher saying something like `` man in dark hoodie observed running down ( name of street ) '' . 
  obviously not me , then . 
  so , he cuts off the plastic strips , tells me to `` fuck off '' , and bolts down the street . 
  so now i 'm soaking wet from lying in a puddle on the ground and my face is fucked up with no further explanation than what i just described . 
  i was 18 - 19 at the time and still living at home , so i had some explaining to to when my mother saw my hung over swollen face the next morning . 
  `` a cop did it '' . 
  `` sure '' . 
  well , yes . 
  i just did n't care about her . 
  when i realised that fact , i knew i had to stop seeing her . 
  later . 
  i was young . 
  it was mainy about t&a, 
  the gaffer ... 
  it was his distiny . 
  that was weak , i know, 
  this is a great transfer . 
  great replacement for benatia . 
  it doens ' t go that way . 
  if anybody can it 's emre can . 
  maybe he 'll get the can ? 
  i love you dzekkers, 
  that 's * rich *, 
  post 2008 , so many douchebags have entered our gates . 
  luckily most of them left again . 
  tevez takes the cake , though . 
  what a cunt . 
  thanks , i guess ? 
  my jaw hurt for like two weeks after . 
  mk dons taking the rags to the cleaners, 
  are you sami khedira , op ? 
  on a gibson you just turn off the volume on the pickup you 're not using .

  or fernet branca, 
  `` like kronenbourg or heineken '' . 
  you just listed the two * worst beers *, 
  na na na na na na na * cocaine * ( batman theme ), 
  quick question : * why are you inviting the internet to your house ? 
  that 's just sad . 
  dave * is * slayer , they are still slayer , but without dave ( and jeff ) they are more * sla * than * slayer * these days . 
  sad . 
  you probably saved her from a creep at best , getting raped and killed at worst . 
  good job . 
  to go your own way . 
  ask yourself what you really want to do , then do it . 
  also : do n't be a dick . 
  hide clues to the hidden club all across the world in churces and museums , and have a very smart professor who looks eerily like tom hanks decipher the clues one by one , all the while i 'm really in the vatican getting busy making a firebrand of the club logo , and at the same time broing with the pope doing papal stuff . 
  i always tip because i was a bartender for seven years . 
  also , i never snap my fingers , i never whistle , i wait patianly for service and * i know what i 'm getting * when the poor guy finally has time for my order . 
  `` begging for gold '', 
  please wash your belt after each class . 
  i do n't want ring worm . 
  how do you know bill * is n't * dave ? 
  dave grohl - * being a good guy gets you awesome hookups * - since 1969, 
  if you walk around in the wardrobe , take your gym shoes off !, 
  i do n't want all that * stuff * from the gym floors in the shower !, 
  pro tip : bring shower sandals . 
  good . 
  get tattooed . 
  but , and i 'm heavily tattoed myself , why * start * with a sleeve ? 
  are you completely sure ? 
  i started getting tattoed at age 18 ( i 'm 38 ) , but i did n't have a real * sleeve * until ten years later . 
  it was basically out of necessity ( to piece things together ) i got a sleeve at all . 
  now i have both my arms from shoulder to wrist , and i 'm not quite sure you are aware of the looks you get . 
  still . 
  i 'm a father of two little girls , and i swear i get looks like i * abducted * these little critters every day because of my tats . 
  i 'm just saying ... 
  think about it . 
  get something smaller first that can cover up until you are completely sure you want to be a marked man the rest of your life . 
  seriously : i 've lost jobs and other opportunities because of my tats . 
  my mother-in-law admitted to me after i had dated my now wife for * five * years that she hated me at first because of the tats . 
  thats a great first impression for you . 
  think about it . 
  you can always connect something smaller to a sleeve later . 
  crust punk : his hero is gone * carry on *, 
  ama !, 
  ama !, 
  ama !, 
  now i have sympathy for bono . 
  imagine finding the same sympathy for lars ulrich ? 
  i 'm reading every single comment in this thread in a mock irish accent !, 
  whyyyyy ? 
  what the hell is wrong with a mullet . 
  wear it with * pride * , son !, 
  what school is that ? 
  g'day mate !, 
  the ol' bait and switch, 
  agreed he just added the `` well , karl if you could see whats going on * now * you 'd be amazed '' dimension . 
  it 's almost like when they give weed to spiders , and the weave those shitty webs . 
  almost . 
  i loved you in the brown bunny , chloe . 
  you should put some tape over your webcam , just in case . 
  my wife is watching the true blood finale . 
  i hate that show . 
  apart from the nsfw parts , obviously . 
  jessica is talking , got ta go . 
  tattoed skin will scar just like your * untouched * skin . 
  do n't stop in the middle of a busy sidewalk,
