  putin needs to go , `` ok '' . 
  you think the u.s would launch a ground attack without russia giving their thumbs up ? 
  yeah , that * we do n't negotiate with terroists * stance seems to be working well, 
  the world is too busy throwing buckets of ice water over their heads to notice anything significant, 
   he knew the risks . 
  yeah , blag on the guys risking their lives bringing you news form the biggest humanitarian crisis since ww2 ... 
  well , it 's the nature of things . 
  and , glad to give you a chuckle !, 
  i think they get plenty of money elsewhere . 
  they 're widely regarded as `` well funded '' . 
  we know . 
  this guy is probably on reddit, 
  out of curiosity , has mainstream islam publicly condemned the is ? 
  i 'm curious . 
  when people who upload pictures of celebrities butts can be found in a matter of hours , why ca n't the most well funded , state of the art equipped specialist secret services of the world find these motherfucking cretins ? 
  not really . 
  * hey everybody , we got jason bourne over here *, 
  his name is enzo gorlomi , he is a stuntman !, 
  god, 
  i probably already was . 
  thanks !, 
  if guidetti goes to celtic , that leaves us with 3 first team strikers ? 
  that 's mental ... 
  now , see that 's how your welcome a player to your club !, 
  something tells me you storm out of rooms a lot . 
  this was the first maiden record i heard . 
  i was 8 years old , and it was the year after it came out , in 1985 , right before live after death was released . 
  i remember thinking the title track with the ominious laugh intro was the most bad ass thing i had ever heard . 
  i remember begging my parents to get me all the previous maiden records on tape ( !, 
  ) , but with titles like * killers * and * number of the beast * , it was a hard sell . 
  regardless , i taped them from friends and maiden was pretty much my religion until grunge appeared . 
  when i `` re-discovered '' my love for maiden a few years later i did the right thing and tattooed the `` aces high '' eddie on my leg . 
  up the irons !, 
  yup , in july 2014 there were 3 million redditors, 
   he was ~ ~ good ~ ~ useful 10 years ago . 
  ftfy, 
  to be fair , it 's a nightmare for man u as well . 
  i started at 38 , and experienced the same ribcase thing . 
  it went away as i trained more . 
  i ca n't say this is helpful to your case , but a lot of `` beginner pain '' is just that , beginner pain . 
  it will pass . 
  * roses are red , violets are blue , i have tourettes , fuck !, 
  i have jennifer lawrence 's autograph !, 
  it 's on a restraining order , but still ... 
  leaf and let live, 
  i have two manto x gi 's and they are very good , lightweight , great value for money . 
  `` only '' 20k a week . 
  that 's one million pounds . 
  that would be very interesting ... 
  he was brought in to keep hart guessing . 
  imo he 's close to hart in ability ... real close, 
  why does n't pellegrini rate nastasic ? 
  do you know ? 
  mangala ... * time to prove your worth *, 
  it used to be . 
  not that long ago, 
  so because i support city i ca n't point out that i think 1 million pounds is a decent yearly wage ? 
  putin will use this pledge to legitimize support of the seperatists , remember this is russias * back yard * , and putin has support in the russian people who feel that nato and the u.s is getting too close . 
  this is dangerous and could set a precedence for all future `` conflicts '' in ex . 
  soviet countries vs. russia . 
  this is putins argument , he wants that terriotory `` back '' . 
  so , you are 26 days old ? 
  you 're not alone . 
  my favorite guitarists are guy picciotto and ian mackaye, 
  all i know about this norway team is that one of their guys just called rooney fat in the papers . 
  i 'm 6 ' 3 '' and 240 lbs . 
  i 'm * sluggish * , that is : my game is * slow and strong * and i use my weight on people . 
  i really want to get faster and improve transitions . 
  is there anyway i can improve my dexterity and speed on the mats ? 
  or do i just need to lose * tons * of weight ? 
  is the pope protestant ? 
  thanks , no i 'm not fat per se . 
  more * solid * . 
  thanks for the tip on timing !, 
  ok , i had a feeling this might come as i progress ... 
  thanks !, 
  it 's genetic , i 'm afraid . 
  i have two brothers and we are all the same 6 ' 3 '' / 240-250lbs . 
  it 's not safe for us to ride elevators at the same time . 
  yes !, 
  and theor trade-offs are amazing . 
  especially live . 
  [ ri 'll have to take your word for it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy_yf4zz-yo ), 
  why ? 
  regarding the geography of * the road * , i think you will enjoy [ this ] ( http://web.utk.edu/~wmorgan/tr/route.htm ), 
  i love it . 
  so , how many of your clients are suspicious spouses ? 
  my wife will stop at no end to buy `` eco fiendly '' carrots and `` local , short - traveled , emotionally secure '' yeast , buy $ 50 bales of `` sheep friendly '' yarn and make homemade kimchi from vegetables cared for by himalayan monks . 
  but she sees no conflict in flying or driving a diesel powered suv . 
  that 's * convenient * . 
  if i ever bring it up , i 'm an asshole . 
  did someone bake a bake off pie chart ? 
  holy mackerel !, 
  are you a writer , mate ? 
  diesel is less expensive where i live, 
  yup , we have a flying suv . 
  * do n't tell anybody *, 
  fuck yes !, 
  it did n't bat an eyelash, 
  that 's ... stupid .
