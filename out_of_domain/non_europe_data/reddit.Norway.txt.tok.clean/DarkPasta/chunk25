  she means well . 
  i took * creative writing 101 * , ok ? 
  we are from northern europe, 
  a phrase i dreamt up . 
  it sums up her weekly purchases of hemp based , home grown , eco-soil , bahabalala . 
  she basically makes every grocery bag twice as expensive . 
  * i know that * , the funny thing is that her friends and her all think they are * beyond * petty things like marketing . 
  i have no clue . 
  it smells worse . 
  do n't be so angry . 
  i 'm more or less like her by default , she makes 80 % of all shopping decisions . 
  i have ideas too . 
  i just enjoy a nice paradox , and most eco-hippies do n't realise that their totally buying a marketed ploy . 
  nope , straight up normal diesel, 
  of course . . 
  out of the park !, 
  looked through these squads , and that was the first thing that struck me too . 
  * damn , everton look good * , i have to admit it 's been a couple of years since i had that thought . 
  was n't ekotto in the spurs starting xi under villas-boas ? 
  strange how a player can fall from grace that fast . 
  maybe he picked up a * knock * eart . 
  apparently we do n't need cover for aguero , he 's * never * injured . 
  right ? 
  ekotto always seemed pretty solid to me . 
  there is always josh hommie . 
  or homme . 
  your mom is rad !, 
  why is she wearing a hospital gown ? 
  i started at 38 . 
  i 'm still 38 by the way . 
  well , mate . 
  not quite what you asked for , * but * : some english words have different meanings in the uk and us . 
  like * coach * means * bus * in the uk . 
  and * rubber * means something to erase pencil marks with in the uk , but in the us it means something you put on your * wiener * . 
  coincidentally , * wiener * means a water cooked sausage in most of the eu , not * penis * like in the us . 
  language is a right laugh , yeah ? 
  roaches . 
  gross, 
  38 year old atheist chiming in, 
  how is 30 + * older * ? 
  an older woman kept dialing my number when she wanted to reach her son . 
  his number is probably very close to mine . 
  * anyway * this went on for years . 
  so , after a while we actually started talking . 
  she was a nice old woman , becoming a little forgetful . 
  she would ask me questions i knew was intended for her son , and then suddenly go `` oh , now i remember , you 're that nice young man '' . 
  like she snapped out of it . 
  she told me her name , and i told her mine . 
  it was kinda nice . 
  she has n't called in a couple of years , so either she programmed her phone correctly - or , you know ... * ceased to be *, 
  now , a riddle : which of ravenous_pandas two sentences was meant in earnest , and which was ironic ? 
  quick question for op : how jealous will your fianc\u00e9 be if * you * make it to the front page ? 
  who * rents * movies in 2014 ? 
  that 's perrty good, 
  sarcaatic is the lowest form of humor, 
  keep clean . 
  you will get * very close * to your sparring partners . 
  that means 1 . trim your nails ( or you might cut someone ) , 2 . brush your teeth ( bad breath sucks ) and 3 . ixnay on the hairproducts , please . 
  ( hair products tend to drip when you get sweaty , and i do n't want your hair wax in my eyes , please ), 
  shrimp , in particular : * the shrimp cocktail * . 
  the nickelback of foods . 
  fourth sisu guy here . 
  i have the 1.6 . 
  it 's great . 
  thanks !, 
  i have a reocurring back thing . 
  i 've been wnating to do yoga for a long time , now i 'm going to . 
  it 's been shaky for 6-7 years . 
  i hurt it on the job as a carpenter . 
  been wanting a foam roller for a while , imma get one, 
  what 's * your * favorite guitar ? 
  hey , with two kids , having one night out * per week * with the guys is a god darn miracle !, 
  we have two daughters , a 3 year old and a new born . 
  now , i only discovered bjj in may , but i 've been training and generally getting out of the house at least 3 times a week all the while i 've been a parent . 
  the understanding my wife and i have is that : in order to have a healthy relationship ( and i believe that is an important basis for being a good parent ) you need * alone time * . 
  so that you still have interests and hobbies so that you keep the flame of life alive . 
  it actually helps the relationship that we both have stuff to talk to each other about enthusiastically . 
  i 'm probably very lucky in that my wife really gets behind this , but as long as you both get to do other things * besides * being a full time parent is pretty important to us . 
  hey , do * us * a favor and wash his belt ... 
  ireland is a sovereign counrty , ya daft apeth . 
  tunnel buddies with ugly casanova . 
  so , you 're asking if i ( with normal congnitive abilities ) lived my life a certain way , i would be rewarded afterlife ? 
  as in eternal life ? 
  what do * you * think ? 
  she does n't believe in locking the door to the bathroom . 
  nah , i do n't mind a little poop . 
  my reference is his side project , ugly casanova, 
  well , y' all ; we went tubing , and that there sideboob was all showin ' . 
  hell , i near made a ` bama milkshake . 
  on a side note : what the hell kind of question is * that * , op ? 
  itt : `` it was a conspiracy !, 
  '' , * no it was n't * , `` it was !, 
  '' , * no it was n't * , `` it was !, 
  '' , * no it was n't * . 
  i guess international law does n't involve the crimea then, 
  why did the snake 's wife file for divorce ? 
  * ereptile dysfunction * . 
  way to * not * get trasferred to hannover anytime soon . 
  my mantos . 
  they have really long arms , which extend at least an inch or two longer than my other rashies .
