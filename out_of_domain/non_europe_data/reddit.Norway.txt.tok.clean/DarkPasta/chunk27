  that 's it . 
  i was fired for not being a team player . 
  that means : i did n't follow * every * rule , my ex . 
  boss decided to enforce on that particular day . 
  hey , your parents probably fucked each other this week .

  cabin fever : level 100 . 
  i play a '70s bassman 100w , thru an old marshall 1960a with 75w celestions . 
  i love the amp , love the way it overdrives , but i also have to use a power break in order to use it at shows as it only sounds good on 10/10 . 
  we typically play 2-300 capacity venues , and it 's way too loud for that . 
  i 'm seriously looking into getting a 50 or 30 watt head so i do n't have to carry that power break around as well . 
  to be honest , if steve harper had n't tripped ... 
  edit : even you liverpool lads * have * to see that theres no way that would 've gone in if he was standing up .

  what a man . 
  way to fuck up your car , stupid !, 
  that made me squirt coffee out my nose, 
  this goes for pretty much everywhere in the world , though . 
  i enjoyed your beer last time i visited . 
  you can buy weed in the coffee shops . 
  if you need something stronger , i ca n't for the life of me understand why you have to ask . 
  this is true . 
  that 's 9 euros . 
  i wo n't tell you where i 'm from , but if somebody approaches you for directions/asks where you 're from etc. , ** pay attention to your wallet ** . 
  pick pockets always work in teams , one man does the `` distraction '' , the other is the `` snatcher '' , and at least one more is lookout and `` handler '' ( the guy who gets the stolen merchandise ) . 
  pay attention to * teams * of people moving through trams , subway cars etc. 
  this is extremely common .

  i 'm sure they will find jobs somewhere .

  edit : why are you downvoting a comment about maintaining anonymity ? 
  i thought that was the point of reddit ? 
  jeez . 
  horses ' neck . 
  that 's a real drink . 
  * the stranger * . 
  you sit on your left had until its numb , then overhand wank . 
  feels mildy like a stranger giving you a tug .
