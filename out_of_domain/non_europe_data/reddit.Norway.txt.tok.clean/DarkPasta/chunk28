  big al legend . 
  do n't steal bills jokes . 
  regardless of ops sympathies , the peace prize seems like it 's lost it 's meaning . 
  denis is to bill what vai is to hendrix . 
  of course , people like arafat , de klerk , kissinger etc were of questionable * nobility * ( although they did bad things , the comittee seems to value when `` major players '' do good ) . 
  but people like mother teresa , rigoberta menchu , mandela , lech walesa - people with a genuine peaceful vision , that 's what it was supposed to be - a clear peaceful message . 
  giving it to obama ( while he 's in office no less ) seems to me like partnering up to the playground bully . 
  ai n't no nobilty in that . 
  ask winstin bogarde, 
  in french . 
  edit : it should say * in french * in the title . 
  for the record : i speak french . 
  does anybody know what happened to the bruce lee wannabe ? 
  because thats got ta hurt . 
  been to the movies ? 
  same rules . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  kids understand way more than you think . 
  this is terrible advice . 
  do n't dumb it down , talk normally to them . 
  ask questions . 
  jesus fucking christ , do n't have kids anytime soon , dude . 
  milly should start every match imo . 
  works hard , great passer , leads by example . 
  whenever he is put on , something new happens . 
  dunnie was here for 9 years , mate . 
  captained us as well . 
  yaya is the one who 's got shoes to fill , not richard . 
  well , the request was * how to talk to small children * ... 
  i assume op is awkward around kids , so my advice is : talk to the kid like you would any other human . 
  i usually communicate with kids the same way , regardless of if they 're mine or not . 
  but then again , i 'm used to being arond kids all the time . 
  picture no . 
  9 : sophia loren notices the * cleavage * , and suddenly looks * very * uncomfortable in 10 & 11 . 
  and by uncomfortable , i mean she wants to kill her . 
   well , lars ulrich was a real asshole back then, 
  ftfy, 
  led zeppelin with dave grohl on drums . 
  i 'm 38 , and i do n't feel any different than when i was in my early twenties . 
  my 88 year old grandmother always says she still feels like shes 25 . 
  from what i gather , james and dave were really tight , they shared amazing bursts of creativity and lars wanted to be the boss , so he forced him out of the band because he was an * alcoholic * . 
  thats * rich * when taking recent ( the some kinda monster cringe-fest ) developments in the metallica camp into account . 
  naked tennis does n't end in sex . 
  it ends in balls that need icing . 
  yes , * those * balls . 
  the exploitation of a continent over hundreds of years of colonization , leading to under development , poor educational systems , corruption and dependance on foreign aid . 
  paging : serious tag . 
  * time passes * . 
  simple explanation : people grow apart , you develop different interests . 
  so , she ruined your wedding moment ? 
  that one thing would be enough for me . 
  talk about stealing somebodys thunder . 
  jeez . 
  i 'm 38 . 
  would n't trade it for being 24 for * anything * . 
  most of the things you obsess over in your early twenties mean very little . 
  i have a family now , obligations , i know myself way better and to be completey honest i do n't give a flying shitfuck about what 99,9 % of people think about me . 
  it 's very liberating . 
  this band fucking rules, 
  thanks for not saving us , dude . 
  what is this guy * really * hiding ? 
  he 's got to have some serious skeletons in his closet to be like this . 
  theres is a saying that goes : `` if you run out of arguments , correct their grammar '' . 
  ok , but now i 'm dead though . 
  * the embarrassment journey * aka high school, 
  totally still just a number . 
  tom morello has n't had to work a day at minimum wage since 1990 . 
  dude needs to apologize . 
  if you are born * in international airspace/waters * you are listed as `` born at sea '' . 
  why would you ever want to run for president ? 
  of course ; i jest : you would get your parents citizenship . 
  your surname is airspace ? 
  awesome !, 
  seeing will sasso usually makes me very happy . 
  not so this time . 
  i hate sons of anarchy . 
  i was at a huge venue in munster , germany when this ( obviously ) gay * big * guy rammed his hand down the front of my jeans , grabbed my dick and said `` that 'll do '' in german ( i speak it just barely ) . 
  i was perplexed to say the least . 
  then he let go , and i said something in the likes of `` get the hell away from me '' . 
  that was the first one that struck my mind . 
  i have others . 
  `` huh ? '', 
  is pretty universal . 
  i 'm a male of reddit , but i * am * married to a woman that * did n't * take my name and * this * is my reasoning why it 's basically a non-issue : would ** i ** change my name if that was the social convention ? 
  the answer is no , so why have that expectation in regards to women ? 
  jessica from true blood . 
  i 'm in luck . 
  i 'm not american , nor interested in becoming prez . 
  you 're a lawyer and admit to that freely ? 
  i 've only gotten into one argument at my gym , and it was over this . 
  this blue belt honestly admitted he had n't washed his belt once , and when he told me - i flat out refused to roll with him . 
  that is so gross . 
  ian mackaye and guy picciotto of fugazi . 
  shower before class and cut your nails short , both hands and feet . 
  other than that , you 'll see !, 
  the reason i mentioned showering is that you 'll get very close to people . 
  you do n't wan na be * stinky guy *, 
  whistle . 
  i 've already seen you , douche . 
  that , and i 'm not a dog .
