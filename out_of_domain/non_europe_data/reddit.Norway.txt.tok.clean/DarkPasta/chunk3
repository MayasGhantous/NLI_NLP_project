  but i 'm also well read , and i have a degree in sociology , i 'm fairly interested in fine arts , and know a thing or two about both wine and designer furniture . 
  but i 'm also a complete sucker for watching a game of football and screaming at the tv . 
  i 'm also married and a father of two little girls , which makes me knowledgeable in both dora the explorer songs and spongebob episodes . 
  still i 'm tagged * macho * , because of my size and * guy-ish * behaviour . 
  i promise , i hear something like this almost weekly : * oh , i did n't think you were interested in going to moma and seeing performance art ? 
  * and this almost exclusively ( 95 % of the time ) comes from women . 
  i swear if * i * said something similar , i 'd get an earful . 
  after x amount of years defending my so called `` feminine '' interests , it 's almost tempting to say people do n't actually want diverse people . 
  it ' s easier to pidgeonhole and categorize , it takes way less effort . 
  rant over . 
  edit : i ca n't spell . 
  i was arguing with my father , whos is a christian , about evolution . 
  i made the `` it 's science '' argument , and his counter was `` well , god * created * science '' . 
  hnnnnnrhgg ... 
  i have twenty-something guitar picks from fairly famous ( and some obscure ) guitarists that i 've accuired over the years . 
  some people use the word * socialist * very inaccurately when `` dicussing '' politics . 
  this pisses me off to no end . 
  do n't mind if i do , good brother . 
  burden of evidence . 
  that 's what . 
  burden of evidence is not a point of view , it 's evidence . 
  when you 've got peer reviewed scietific evidence , it 's not a point of view it 's fact . 
  and with that : we 're done . 
  `` i think the world is 6000 years old '' , also `` we do n't believe in vaccines '' . 
  off the top of my head : john christ of danzig , bruce springsteen , dave murray of iron maiden , billy gibbons of zz top , and a bunch of `` hardcore '' acts , such as against me , hot water music etc. . . 
  touch\u00e9, 
  i 'm not looking to get locked into semantics with people trying to justify their belief in some utmost deity that somehow transcends all logic and argument . 
  that has no place in my life , and if you feel strong armed because i made a valid argument , then sorry boss . 
  my conscience is clear . 
  we will just have to agree to disagree and be happy we do n't have to spend xmas together and have this endless discussion over and over and over and over again . 
  like i have to with my religious family , which was the point in my original comment . 
  an expert of * shame *, 
  i mean tuesday * is * the new friday , or so i read in cosmo . 
  in the waiting room at the doctors . 
  i did n't * buy * cosmo . 
  it was just lying there . 
  in the office . 
  at the doctors . 
  cosmopolitan . 
  you 're not the first one , buddy . 
  i try , dude , 
  that makes two of us . 
  oh no , you did n't . 
  ah , i have neurosis ' drumsticks , and slayers !, 
  some people also think politicians are on their side . 
  the same people tend to also trust the police , and bankers . 
  we are in agreement . 
  google `` news on gaza strip '' or `` israeli vs. palestinian '' , and you 'll see a * stage * for sure . 
  as long as isil leader abu bakr al-baghdadi gets away with appaeling to every muslim in the word `` to avenge the crimes commited against islam '' , and also proclaiming a new state ( well , rogue state ) and saying `` there is no better cause in this blessed month than jihad in god 's name - therefore embrace this change and fight for god 's religion through jihad '' , basically threatening every free country and citizen that is * not * muslim , i can see this turning real ugly real soon . 
  but the state of israel is officaially a judaic statehood , no ? 
  and the soviet union was officially atheist when it sent 25 million to the gulag . 
  that is not the point , my point was to emphazise that judaism also has things to answer for . 
  that seems to be the politics * du jour *, 
  mao shockingly was n't really taught when i 'm from . 
  i was n't until high school when i started taking social studies that chinese history was even touched upon briefly . 
  well , correct me if i 'm wrong but if darkpasta threatens to kill every darkpasta hater , it will only get me banned from this sub , but when a comfirmed extremist with an audience does it , it 's maybe a different matter ? 
  isil ( as it is named in my country ) has a proven track record for violence , murder and terrorism . 
  it 's only that they have n't hit * the west * yet thats the difference . 
  i did n't even know it was that many people . 
  people really do n't give a shit about anybody but their own . 
  well , i certainly do n't hope so . 
  walking on water . 
  i 've done this too . 
  especially when talking to women , complimenting another guys looks seems to make them appreciate that i am secure in my * manliness * ( yessh ) and do n't feel threatened by another male specimen . 
  reversely , it might come across as `` gay '' to some women , but those women can take their opinion and insert it rectally . 
  if you 're able to recognise an attractive woman , you will be able to identify a good looking male . 
  a can of coke . 
  my dad forgot my birthday . 
  i think i was 13 or something . 
  of course . 
  some bugs fly too . 
  ice , baby . 
  i know !, 
  you forget you had to pee . 
  i think this comes down to ego , and whos in control of theirs . 
  if you constantly need to one-up people , that tells me the person is probably quite insecure and needs the recognition that comes with `` success '' . 
  or peer acceptance . 
  you know , entitlement issues . 
  conversely , if you * know * you 're on top of your game , you * did * your proverbial homework , and you * know * you do a good job , you do n't need that recognition to feed your ego . 
  in my experience , it 's ususally people who follow the last example of ego free thinking that prevail in the long run , and other people benefit from working with . 
  less drama requires less effort from your surroundings , and since people want to invest as little time as possible getting along , they choose the guy with the * ego-free * midset . 
  you can still be competitive , still be successful - but you do n't have to care about the drama . 
  just fuck it , dude . 
  put it to sleep . 
  my two cents , anywho . 
  * flavor of the week *, 
  i have sleeves on both arms , and the wrist area heals slowly . 
  they also crust up pretty bad , because of all the movement from when you move your hands all day . 
  also because of cuffs , i presume . 
  just keep it clean and put lotion on it . 
  for the lackadaisical , here 's a very short summary of the article . 
  2000 new jobs have been created , drug-related crime ( possession , murder etc. ), 
  is down 50 % . 
  in church . 
  in the priest 's office . 
  a friend i grew up with is scizophrenic . 
  he heard voices in his head , and barricaded himself in the apartment thinking the secret police was after him . 
  he was commited at age 17 ( this was in the ninties ) , and has been in and out of hospital for twenty years . 
  they finally found the `` right '' meds , and now he spends his days watching tv , chain smoking and looking for feds out the window of his tiny apartment . 
  his fingers are yellow from the smokes .
