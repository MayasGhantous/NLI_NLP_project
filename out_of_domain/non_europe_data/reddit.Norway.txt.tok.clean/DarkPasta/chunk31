  this guy gets it . 
  when you work out , you get more energy to do more stuff , then - presto - you are filling our days with radical and fantastical . 
  really though , work out . 
  he is more like my brother that my actual brothers . 
  we have toured the world together in bands . 
  i know his dirty secrets , he knows mine . 
  we have gotten in fist fights , but i will fucking kill you if you mess with that guy . 
  i introduced him to his wife . 
  we both have daughters born a month apart . 
  the dude is a genuine 100 % bro from another mo ' . 
  i love that dude . 
  sure !, 
  it does . 
  * the god delusion . 
  * richard dawkins . 
  truth hurts , dunnit , religious freaks . 
  liverpool, 
  your car, 
  let 's argue in circles until we all look into our own assholes . 
  or , come to think of it , let 's not . 
  i 've watched both series , and i do n't think they 're cry babies at all . 
  if anything it made me respect macgregor . 
  * i 'll pay you back monday *, 
  you 'll need quite a lot of answers to this question if it 's for statistics . 
  ... dating kathy griffin, 
  sooo ... you 're implying that the cia is involved in * shady business * ? 
  i believe none of it !, 
  it 's a eternal shopping mall full of womens clothing stores , and i have to wait for my wife ( * holding her bag * ) for eternity . 
  and * baby * by bieber is blaring from all the stores . 
  that was fucking brilliant . 
  what . 
  a guitar -  write hit song -  get downloaded free by you guys . 
  fail . 
  fml, 
  depends if you like doing dishes for a living . 
  merch is * gas money * , the actual show is the bread and butter . 
  you are both right . 
  i 'm warming up to this pope . 
  not in * thaaaat * way , guys . 
  your drummer should learn the song titles . 
  i 'll take bored over hungry or tired every day , dude . 
  but , * this is hell * , so why not all three at the same time ? 
  well , my wife * re-invents * herself once in a while , so i have to join these shopping trips because we have kids and they * have * to come , which only makes the whole thing * that much better * . 
  come to think of it , i had to come before we had kids too , so well , fuck it . 
  and we have two girls , so this will be tripled in a matter of mere years . 
  i literally just picked up my wife from the hair salon , and they were playing coldplay in there , which is * slightly * better than bieber , but not much . 
  indeed . 
  or change friends . 
  i 'll just stop by the place you work and help myself later , then . 
  indeed . . 
  totally . 
  you literally see their life force fading away . 
  well , if i may : coldplay are the u2 of this generation . 
  given that u2 has n't put out a good record in 25 years , and they are basically the given mall rock band everyone that does n't really like guitar music feels it 's ok to like . 
  i do n't * hate * them , i just hate what they represent . 
  what 's the subject ? 
  what if it 's just , * bam * born into another consciousness - repeat process . 
  honestly : what is consciousness , and why am i `` me '' ? 
  who says it wo n't just happen again , another `` me '' in another body ? 
  call it what you will , soul , mind , intelligence , mind over matter . 
  these are things we as a species have not found answers to . 
  i take out my * slaughter of the soul * lp by at the gates . 
  then i sit them down on the couch and * make them * listen to the whole thing . 
  the music, 
  manto europe is fast and reply within hours ... 
  i got a x pro gi and a rashie from them and the rashie got a tear the first training session . 
  i emailed them a picture of the rashie , and they immediately sent me a new one , no questions asked . 
  i love their gis , so i 'll definately buy from manto again . 
  sweet land cruiser . 
  too edgy for me, 
  * punk rock * surprisingly . 
  as in playing it . 
  in front of people . 
  chocolate , because 99 % of women love chocolate , and i have a shot at , say about 0 , 0000001 % of them . 
  having * a tattoo * ( 1 ) includes about 30-40 % of adults in the western worls though . 
  i 'm covered in tattoos . 
  both arms are full sleeves , my chest and legs are also pretty covered . 
  no hand or neck tats , though . 
  in music , it 's no problem - rather the opposite - but in * grown up world * ( `` real '' jobs , interacting with people age 50 + , my inlaws first impression of me , meetings with my bank for instance , etc. 
  etc. ), 
  it certainly has created both negative reactions , and in one case gotten me fired from a job i had at a hospital . 
  also , * stares * ... 
  most people do * look * uncomfortably long , at times to the point where i go `` yes those are all real '' . 
  i 'd say it definately affect me almost every day . 
  as much as i want to , i * really * want to stay anonymous on here . 
  some of my tats are pretty recognisable if you know me . 
  i do n't wan na change accounts every other month , 
  well , if you add my married status into that equation , the odds do plummet . 
  band , indeed . 
  as much as i want to , i * really * want to stay anonymous on here . . 
  this record rules . 
  ok , then, 
  how do you rate joe lally ? 
  i think you guys played a fugazi medley one time i saw you and that 's why i ask so specifically ... 
  i have n't heard it . 
  the last one they did was disappointing . 
  seems when they lost carlos , things became less interesting . 
  `` do a barrel roll '', 
  first of all : you are in the service industry . 
  people eat off the plates you are touching .
