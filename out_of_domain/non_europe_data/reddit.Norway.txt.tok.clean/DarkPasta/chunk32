  that 's just fucking gross . 
  second : pheromones, 
  music . 
  that is good to hear . 
  all the cooks i 've ever worked with have been dicks . 
  well , yes and no . 
  some of them are/were a little on the cokey side , but it does n't affect the work they do . 
  except this one dude , who really got out of control . 
  not * all * the cooks i 've worked with are dicks , but during work they generally forget manners , how to talk to people etc. 
  i get that * it 's a cook thing * , but it really annoys me at times . 
  `` say please and thank you '' - nick offerman, 
  the dutch are statistically the * tallest people on earth * so theres that . 
  how can they take your tips ? 
  that money is * for you * regardless of your experience . 
  when i win the lottery fuzzrocious is going to get a huge wire transfer . 
  neurosis, 
  old man gloom, 
  kowloon walled city, 
  much obliged , sir . 
  i will check out the tome in question , sir . 
  well , that sounds like something i would be interested in . 
  thanks !, 
  we 've had a * tasting party * , buuut ... then the head chef changed about half the wines . 
  this is a brand new place , so they are trying out * everything * , and i 'm just a * lowly * bar man . 
  i know my booze and beer , and i can make you a killer blloody mary , but these suit and tie * wine guys * make me sweat profusely . 
  `` what 's going on ? '', 
  - marvin gaye, 
   do n't bullshit guests on wine, 
  that 's what the head chef said too ... 
  some of these fuckers actually * know * what they 're talking about , and will see right through my `` well , this is a red riesling , it goes great with aspargus , you 'll notice the winery is located on sunny hillside '' ... not an adventure of words i 'd like to embark on ... 
  well , there ya go . 
  they are fucking apeshit-ly good . 
  my 3 year old standing next to our bed going * i wan na go downstairs * . 
  if i do n't reply , she gets on the bed and starts jumping up and down on top of me . 
  i do n't know what pisses me off more , the guy stomping his wife or the two cowards doing nothing to stop it . 
  escape to the country on bbc two . 
  you could get two octopi grappling each other . 
  that will take care of the space of the the entire arm , i guess . 
  penny dreadful . 
  so , pretty well fucked . 
  a samantha fox poster made that happen for me . 
  `` do you have rolling papers ? 
  i ca n't think straight without being high '' . 
  the holy handgrenade . 
  i hear it at least once per week . 
  yup, 
  i too watched that * debate * and affleck was sitting there like a 14 year old girl , just having told she ca n't go to her boyfriends sleepover . 
  there was no discussion , he did not listen to harris ' points , he was just waiting to start screaming `` racist '' at every argument that was put forward . 
  before seeing that i suspected affleck of being somewhat of an idiot , now it 's confirmed . 
  has anybody checked if tony abbott actually knows how to read ? 
  the aol/time warner merger, 
  too bad you ca n't ever move the picture . 
  martial arts . 
  you get in shape , learn self control , self dicipline and self defence . 
  your confidence will grow as your skills improve . 
  good morning , mr. nye . 
  what is your favorite piece of * fiction * ? 
  be it art , literature , music - you name it . 
  bodes well for the lenght of time she plans on staying . 
  black . 
  silver or gold pinstripes . 
  grab the pasta , make an `` ok '' circle with your thumb and index finger . 
  all the spag you can fit inside this circle is enough for a casserole . 
  i heard anastasios sidiropoulos is greek for cunt, 
  i 'll happily accept a clone . 
  as long as * that sound * is there , you know ... 
  i do n't finish anyth, 
  and do n't forget the obligatory altoids box !, 
  my gym does n't charge anything , the prof gives out belts and stripes when he sees fit . 
  of course . 
  some people are just * talented * . 
  it 's not easy to explain , but some people have `` that tone '' regardless of the equipment they 're playing . 
  * ... and justice for all * - metallica . 
  a lot of people slag that lp for the thin sound , that cliff burton is n't there anymore etc. 
  imo it 's the most technical playing , best songwriting and the * angriest * metallica record . 
  definately my favorite of theirs . 
  well , g ` day mate !, 
  let 's put another shrimp on the barbie !, 
  do you see your ability to breathe as relevant ? 
  breastfeeding in public . 
  who cares ? 
  * sooo , you do n't enjoy boobs in public * ? 
  too bad , auntie !, 
  i 've played guitar for 30 years . 
  some people are just * better * anyway . 
  call it what you will , x-factor , talent , whatever . 
  some people just have * something * . 
  like `` tone in the fingers '' . 
  i 've heard a mix with actual * bass * in it . 
  it did n't feel right . 
  this was back when lars actually rehearsed , haha . 
  not a fan huh, 
  cliff died in \u00b4 86 , though . 
  it 's newsted , right ? 
  whitesnake - is this love . 
  and the * video * , goddamn !, 
  i do n't want a diesel because of the style of driving we do . 
  we drive mainly in the city , lots of start/stop and my previous diesel toyota has been plagued with soot issues . 
  i 'm really in need of an auto tranny as well , makes being stuck in traffic way more enjoyable . 
  house of cards,
