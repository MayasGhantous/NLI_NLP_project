  you are a smelly pirate hooker . 
  why do n't you go back to your home on whore island ? '' -- ron burgundy, 
  leatherface - watching you sleep, 
  hi tim , what was your favorite support band ever on one of your tours ? 
  i just want to know : how * old * is * old * ? 
  i did n't know where to put it . 
  i generally do about 90 % of my fucking in bed . 
  cool , i 'm an adult ( ! ) . 
  i 'm 38 ... 
  that 's cool , where did you find that ? 
  oh , no you did n't . 
  i do n't know what to tell you except this : you 'll be shocked how fast the next 23 years of your life will pass by . 
  do n't waste your time . 
  are these lyrics to a song ? 
  it 's called * old man strength * . 
  it 's a thing . 
  no , * married * . 
  look , i do jiu jitsu and one of the baddest mfs in my gym is 48 . 
  was super stoked to go . 
  got ripped off a gazillion times , and was told `` fuck you and fuck your country '' by some heroin dealer because i would n't buy his dope . 
  apparently * every * westener buys dope . 
  not me , though . 
  i was also followed by a guy for * three fucking hours * claiming he was my guide , and i had to pay him to fucking leave me alone . 
  i also got ripped off in a taxi , the hotel i was staying at and i 'm pretty sure i paid 500 % more for everything . 
  planned on staying a week , left after 3 days . 
  on top of this , i got a prayer rug and a drum taken by spanish costoms on the way back . 
  i 've travled quite a bit , but i 'm never going back to tangier or morocco . 
  what the fucking fuck !?!?!, 
  we 're one man up !, 
  that 's it , i 'm getting a 16 aguero shirt, 
  looks like hannah from girls in a fish head costume . 
  looks rad , though !, 
  tom cruise, 
  he 's the latvian tom cruise . 
  you 're uttering the word * closet * in this context ? 
  just what are you implying ? 
  better lawyer up , buddy . 
  my first major milestone was completing the warm up without passing out . 
  i think it 's the collective hive mind that perpetuates the ghost myth , much in the same way the religious narrative is repeated through the generations . 
  people just automatically re-tell the myths of old to explain what they do n't understand . 
  theres no evidence of ghosts , and every attempt to produce evidence usually results in having to turn to * psychics * . 
  which is nonsense . 
  how do you tune the soundgarden one ? 
  re-string the whole guitar ?

  my professor would go mental . 
  * maybe * they went for coffee after that interview ? 
  and by coffee , i mean the nearest restroom , shed or motel 6 . 
  coldplay is a million times better than fucking taylor swift . 
  yes , a million . 
  aguero scoring vs. qpr clinching the title in 2012 pretty much made me go mental , the craziest game so many ups and downs , and then taking it in the 94th minute . 
  words can not explain how that felt . 
  dude , you 're cool as fuck !, 
  definately . 
  whats really crazy is how similar those two goals are . 
  both get `` assisted '' from a clearance/half chance and are about the same angle and distance . 
  both in the 94th ... 
  was at a pub with a scouser mate of mine . 
  that night i was cheering for liverpool . 
  what a fucking game . 
  people lacking education . 
  to fix it : educate the people, 
  keep it playful, 
  who knows ? 
  good point , a couple of guys at my club did not understand if he was real or not ( english is not our first language ) , and i mentioned him being something like `` the ali g of bjj '' , and both of them immediately thought it was a good bit , but played out * a long * time ago . 
  funny how just reading that word makes you hear them, 
  have you studied sociology ? 
  fun to encounter fellow social study nerds here . 
  ... finishing just one of my 19 projects i have running at any given time, 
  fuck you boss , i quit . 
  the stapler says * garet * , so it 's not yours gareth . 
  just shut up and pay me already, 
  no fucking way !,

  that 's all right , mama . 
  peyote is the shit , right ? 
  tm 's are not famous . 
  source : i 'm a tm . 
  well , tms can be freelance or some work for booking agents . 
  usually you can get in touch with any kind of management agancy and they will know someone you can approach . 
  i only work in europe , so if you 're from the states i have no idea . 
  i get booked through a pretty much punk rock diy network . 
  get off my lawn , kid . 
  nice , wish i had planned out my sleeves like you .

  i 'm 38 too , our classes are about 1,5 hours , with the last 1/2 hour usually being free rolls . 
  i tend too sit one out at the end because i 'm too gassed out . 
  it 's getting better as i learn to pace myself , though . 
  the problem with a lot of white belts is they go balls out * all the time * , and it 's exhausting to defend against . 
  lately i 've been getting better at relaxing when i can during rolls , like the more experienced guys here have been saying - it gets better . 
  which version of photoshop is that ? 
  how ` bout `` idiotproofing doors '', 
  i 'm 6 ' 3 '' , burly and i was captain of my high school football ( soccer ) team . 
  thus , my nickname has remained * captain * for the remainding 20 + years . 
  watch the line !, 
  put some ** around her name , * if you know what i 'm sayin *,
