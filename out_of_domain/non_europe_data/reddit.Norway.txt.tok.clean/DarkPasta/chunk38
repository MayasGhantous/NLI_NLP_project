  the danger aspect is largely dependent on where you live , and you 're right , being atheist in western europe is not * dangerous * per se . 
  but let 's say you 're from iran ... 
  tables turn pretty quickly . 
  my second daughter was born . 
  in addidtion to being unbelievbly gross , they 're also huge , right ? 
  my eldest is four soon . 
  now she 's reminding me not to forget my keys . 
  they grow up fast . 
  i 'm worried if atama is anything like koral , i 'll be swimming in a4 . 
  had to sell my a4 mkm , the bastard was way too big . 
  to not get injured . 
  and to possibly get the same belt as op . 
  now , i have by no means ruined his life , nor is this man my * worst enemy * , but this is what happened :, 
  my wife was attacked by a guy that thought she ** drove too slowly ** . 
  i was out of town , and that fact bugs me to this day . 
  she was * pregnant * with our first born at the time , but that did not stop this flake from following her into a parking garage and trying to * choke * her when she got out of the car , asking * what the fuck her problem was * . 
  luckily a rent-a-cop was right by and stopped the whole thing before it got ugly . 
  now , they got this guys plates . 
  he was easy to find . 
  so , we sued him for assaulting a pregnant woman . 
  we had witnesses . 
  case closed , right ? 
  the motherfucker got away . 
  turns out , he had a good attorney , because he 's a fucking * repeat offender * . 
  dude is fucking 50 + years old and attacks a 5 month pregnant women over nothing . 
  then he gets let off , because he had n't * done much * the last 5 years . 
  naturally , i freak out . 
  justice must be served . 
  i can not kill this man , or maim him . 
  i have two children and do not want to spend the next 30 years in jail . 
  on the other hand , i do have friends all over the world as i am a touring musician , and i know people pretty much on every continent . 
  so i ask about 20 friends from all over the world to randomly at a time of their choosing to send this guy a postcard that reads `` i hope you 're doing well . 
  stay healthy . '' . 
  so , over a period of months , even years , this guy recieved postcards from all over europe , the u.s , even japan that read a somewhat vague threat . 
  i hope he 's paranoid as fuck by this point . 
  edit : a lot of you seem to think that the message on the postcard is too meek . 
  thing is , my first language is not english , and i worded out the message in * my * language for my boys to send to this guy . 
  in my language `` stay healthy '' ( bad translation ) sounds more or less like a serious threat to your life . 
  quite literally `` waste your health '' . 
  hope that clears things up a little . 
  double edit : wow , a lot of you guys have great ideas of how to pursue this further . 
  do n't worry , i also thought of gradually making the postcards being closer and closer to the guy until one day , they 're from the little town he 's in . 
  that would be fun . 
  in fact , you 've inspired me to get a few sent right now . 
  it been too long since the last ones went out . 
  my dream guitar is a 1966 ( has to be ' 66 ) black fender jaguar with white pickguard . 
  thanks !, 
  because that 's the year jags had binding and blocks on the neck . 
  it looks amazing . 
  opinions are like assholes , everybodys got one, 
  that just means the glass was cleaned properly . 
  seriously . 
  this is good advice . 
  stay in shape . 
  finish school . 
  do n't be a dick .

  spongebob rules . 
  the barbie cartoon is just plain and utter defecation spewing out from the screen . 
  to compare , i 'm 38 years old . 
  he 's been a black belt since before my parents had sex to make my magnificent white belt being . 
  holy shit . 
  `` it began as a mistake '', 
  one-upping should be fined . 
  you 're telling a good story , somebody tries to one-up you , and ** ding ** that 'll be 50 quid , please . 
  yup . 
  he was even good in that shit-fest paranoia . 
  that 's quite a feat .

  i have an app on my phone that helps me sleep . 
  search for `` andrew johnson '' in the appstore . 
  post office , bukowski, 
  does anybody know what his wages are ? 
  like other posters have said , it seems like bad business to have a guy earning twice micah richards ' wages on the bench . 
  we could 've kept micah instead .
