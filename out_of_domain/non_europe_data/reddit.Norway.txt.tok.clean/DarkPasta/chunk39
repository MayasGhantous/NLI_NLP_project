  / r/deadbedrooms, 
  hey , kid !, 
  you like flipping burgers ? 
  do you love working the graveyard shift ? 
  do you love cleaning up after people ? 
  drop out of school , and that 's what you 're going to do . 
  is that you ? 
  you 're invisible - but only when nobodys looking . 
  people uttering that word usually seldom know what a socialist really is . 
  she has one face , the `` pouty , i 'm not trying to be sexy '' face . 
  `` friends '', 
  more importantly : how do you know i do n't ? 
  do you identify yourself as a fascist ? 
  you know , theres a reason * fascist * is used as an insult . 
  there was this thing called world war two . 
  i 'm just going to go ahead and leave this conversation now . 
  it support . 
  those guys laugh all the way to the bank . 
  i do not use deodorant . 
  as do i. 
  but i frequently meet these less brilliant people nonetheless . 
  i smell like a man , so yes . 
  it does n't take much in that case, 
  keep it up !, 
  i have a question i hope you will answer : why does it feel so hard to admit that we are not drinking ? 
  i 'm only 6 days in , but i 've heard myself apologizing for the fact that i 'm staying on the wagon a couple times already ... 
  my wife loves the fact that i smell `` like a man '' and not `` like a pussycat '' . 
  her words . 
  i enjoy that . 
  what the duck is that dog doing to that fuck ? 
  foo fighters ' recipe : release album with two singles , eight filler tracks . 
  repeat for 15 years . 
  i ca n't believe some of these dudes used to be in the germs and nirvana . 
  the best thing grohl has done in this milennium was playing drums on songs for the deaf . 
  shark tank, 
  my lifestyle determines my deathstyle , dude . 
  these guys were my religion growing up in the late 80 's along with slayer and maiden . 
  i listened so much to the first four metallica records , i literally had to buy the tapes twice . 
  saw them for the first time this summer . 
  left after 5 songs . 
  literally the biggest fucking let down i 've ever had the privelege of paying 100 euro not to finish seeing . 
  1/2 slayer still fucking killed it by the way . 
  maiden is still good , thank jebus . 
  bony . 
  proven premiership goalscorer , powerful , fast . 
  in his prime , many seasons left on the pitch . 
  hes also a different type than what we already have , always good to have options in attack . 
  gaslight anthem ? 
  punk ? 
  does n't help that the singer rips off mike ness ' style down to a tee . 
  well , * basically * ( see what i did there ) , because i did n't think they were going to suck !, 
  many things : kirk had a `` moment '' which was supposed to me his `` i 'm a guitar god , look at me '' moment , but instead he sounded like a depressed whale trying to tune his guitar . 
  lars ' was playing so badly that i was seriously offended on behalf of musicians out there that actually rehearse before playing in front of people . 
  it shows disrespect that he thinks he can go on stage and * barely * get through the song . 
  james and trujillo were good , but still . 
  probably somebody reasonably young and talented , like josh homme or possibly dave grohl . 
  ah , backgammon . 
  ten minutes to learn , a lifetime to master . 
  i 'm so hooked on that game . 
  this news makes me scared for the future of free press . 
  are we going to be bullied to silence by these fucking medieval morons ? 
  more nirvana than foos , but kyuss - oh yea . 
  my best bud was my best man , and i was his . 
  so yeah . 
  `` wan na come with me and watch me take a dump ? '', 
  thanks , i guess ? 
  oh , another matter entirely . 
  if it was * that man * , i would n't whisper ... 
  i do too . 
  i 'm seven months in , and it has n't changed either . 
  maybe i 'm perma-drunk . 
  i have wrist pain , what can i do do strengthen my wrists ? 
  that is really bad . 
  i got my first week in !, 
  feels good !, 
  so , did you see that black swan film ? 
  ah , thanks !, 
  i 'll look into a wrist roller for sure . 
  that 's called a shit test , and the purpose is to see if you can handle yourself under pressure . 
  music . 
  i 'm a musician , and music is - and will always be , my first love . 
  i work in the music and theatre business , i 'm a touring musician , and most of my friends are in music or show business . 
  bjj is actually my * escape * from being around music all the time , which is part of why i 'm really into bjj . 
  it 's my own thing , you know ... 
  male . 
  cheers, 
  index & ring fingers . 
  it frees up the pinky to accent the chord quickly , like add a major/minor to it . 
  waiters ** rely ** on tips . 
  it ** not ** an option , you cheapskate bastards !, 
  i 'd like to thank you for your post , i gained new insight into this horrible situation . 
  like others have posted , the entire western world should hear this message , and take it to heart . 
  stay safe , take care . 
  much love . 
  how tall are you ? 
  darth vader , because of facts . 
  i 'm going with a4 then . 
  cool , thanks for the info !, 
  when i die , i will instantly `` wake up '' in a new body , oblivious to the fact that my consciousness has lived before . 
  wether is follows a linear perception of time or space or not makes it a fun thought experiment .
