  our school is about two years old . 
  prof : black belt . 
  we have no brown or purples , 8 blues and give or take 10 - 15 white belts . 
  find the best artist in your area . 
  say this to the artist `` so , i want a bear , and i want * you * to draw it and come up with the concept . 
  this is the best way to get awesome ink . 
  modulation . 
  alice in chains . 
  that one hit wonder band , whose hit people actually think is weezer , so much that weezer actually covers the song themselves ? 
  really ? 
  you 're downvoting alice in chains , and mentioning wheatus on your list . 
  i 'm not even going to bring up your other picks , because wheatus infuriated me so much i ca n't think . 
  by the way : it just occured to me : that song was n't even relased in the nineties . 
  we tour europe . 
  vinyl outsells cd 2 to 1 on the road everywhere , except germany for us . 
  there it 's about 50/50 cds and lps . 
  if i had to choose , i 'd only bring vinyl and tees . 
  do n't let yourself go . 
  stay in shape . 
  been with my so for ten , married for six years . 
  we have two kids . 
  a good way too keep your wife interested is taking care of your body . 
  stay fit , i can not stress this enough . 
  if you do n't , it 's sort of like you 're saying `` i do n't give a fuck '' . 
  so if you do n't care about yourself , why should she , you know ? 
  and besides , getting a little attention from other women is a good way to keep your wife alert , too . 
  staying physically fit is way more important than people think . 
  it 's a win-win . 
  the * entire * disintegration album by the cure . 
  if this movie is made , i will probably have to start smoking weed again . 
  kinda missing the point there , d\u00fcde . 
  more companies should follow xerox ' lead with this . 
  i think a lot of people would do this if they did n't have to give up their wages . 
  i know i would . 
  there is no such thing as a free meal . 
  hello , redd44 ( unfortunate username there , mate ) . 
  what you need to know is , we used to be shite . 
  `` typical city '' is a term you should get used to . 
  also , `` blue moon '' is now your favorite song . 
  it will bring tears to your eyes . 
  players like georgi kinkladze and shaun goater are gods . 
  they played for us in the nineties , which was when we were relegated , and were generally mediocre at best . 
  my fondest memories is winning the championship in 01/02 , the playoffs in 99 , agueros goal in 2012 to clinch the title and also when we beat spurs 4 - 3 in 04 with ten men , off the top of my head . 
  well , it 's not your club , it 's our club . 
  that 's unfortunate , but how was i supposed to know that ? 
  does anybody have the standings so far ? 
  my instructor is competing , but i have n't found a link or stream of the black belt first rounds anywhere . 
  same rule as with pizza , do n't throw too much stuff on it !, 
  two or three ingredients is enough . 
  op , google circular arguments . 
  that 's reassuring . 
  otherwise it would just flop about everywhere . 
  cr7 is arrogant , what else is new . 
  paul mccartney being more talented than kanye . 
  ask the artist to draw it out for you . 
  what a player ( in the championship ) .

  they stick , but need less adjustment . 
  ien levin is amazing . 
  your sister may be in a little deep without her even knowing it . 
  in the * business side * of booze i 've seen a lot of people who have serious drinking habits , who never acknowledge they have a problem . 
  it 's `` their job '' to drink . 
  i know , because i was one . 
  this was my main reason for quitting the bar and restaurant business , you just ca n't escape drinking . 
  either it 's wine tasting or just salesmen pitching - you 're always saying `` i 'll just have this * one * more ( insert unit of alcohol ) '' , then suddenly you had 5 drinks * again * . 
  i was drinking an unhealthy amount of `` work related '' beers/wines/scotches . 
  lord knows i used it as an exuse many , many times instead of going home after my shift . 
  i was lost as soon as the warm ups started , man . 
  i could n't even figure out how to shrimp . 
  i just looked on in awe of these dudes effortlessly bouncing around the room , thinking `` i 'm totally going to do that * eventually * '' . 
  i 'm 38 and your exact height . 
  i weighed 275 when i started in june . 
  cue seven months later , now i 'm 235 - my gut is disappearing ** fast ** . 
  my cardio is * miles * better and i 've only torn one pair of gi pants . 
  win , win , win and win . 
  in the words of kurt osiander : go train !, 
  i have a koral light . 
  it 's great for hot weather , but it stretches when it gets sweaty . 
  frantically googling `` crazy palindromes '' , encountering article on sarah palin . 
  scratching head . 
  re-googling `` partyboob '' . 
  comes up with zach galafiniakis tweeting the message in this meme in 2013 . 
  disappointment . 
  * tears of confusion *, 
  behaving badly toward waiters . 
  * pass *, 
  what the fuck kind of question is that ? 
  you support the * club * not the * players * . 
  freddy adu . 
  those louis vuitton bags . 
  that was ryan giggs , mate, 
  when i 'm going to ** die ** comes to mind !, 
  a lot of people are more concerned with * the afterlife * than actually living the only life you have guaranteed . 
  this one .
