  if you vote for ukips or the like , i have nothing to say to you . 
  likewise `` buddy '', 
  thanks for a well thought out response . 
  i appreciate and understand your points , but only fear that the viewpoints taken up in forums like trp will inspire weaker souls to harbor poisonous though patterns . 
  and maybe inspire them to do things they can not take back . 
  i do n't have to debate neo fascists . 
  i will fight for their right to speak their mind , but i will not partake in their world view . 
  my blue air mountainbike that was stolen in 1998 . 
  i still think about that sweet fucking bike . 
  yes . 
  i delete accounts as soon as somebody finds out where i 'm from etc. 
  i like my privacy on the interwebs . 
  i think i 'm on my 4th account on reddit . 
  `` since life is meaningless , part of being alive is making your own purpose . '', 
  - somebody smart, 
  they are already saying what they like with a bullhorn . 
  ukips share of the uk vote , 27.5 % . 
  it 's a fucking disgrace . 
  smooth and articulate like a true lothario, 
  and so i watch you from afar ( it 's a band ), 
  a waiting room . 
  the thing would be a great ufc fighter, 
  my mother used to tell me `` only boring people get bored '' when i was a kid . 
  meaning : if you do n't have the imagination to find something to do , find * something * to do anyway . 
  activity sparks creativity . 
  my life to take off . 
  i 'm 38 and currently finishing university . 
  going to change careers . 
  we are building a house next year . 
  i 've been a musician for years , and now we need a little more stability because we have two little children . 
  so i 'm kinda in the middle of a big change . 
  thanks , obama . 
  for the signature . 
  props for the `` joey ramone place '' sign . 
  paid parental leave, 
  being a musician , a girl that plays an instrument is very attractive . 
  if she is smart , funny and good looking as well ... that 's a bingo !, 
  do you want a million dollars ? 
  please remind me : how many kids does the pope have again ? 
  yeah , that 's right ** none ** because * he 's a celibate monk * . 
  what the fuck does he know about raising kids ? 
  shut the fuck up , religious nut . 
  edit : so , all you downvoters : it 's ok to smack a kid because a guy whos head of a religious opressive regime ( google `` the inquisition '' ) who thinks he 's a fictional god representative on earth says it a proper way to raise my kids ? 
  why do n't ** you ** send your kids to catholic school then . 
  i 'll be here in the 21st century in the meantime . 
  even i think that ... 
  start with 4/4 , worry about jazz later . 
  have n't seen the film , but jazz is usually pretty free form ( advanced ) . 
  if you play the piano , i would say you have an edge because you are used to playing different rythms with each hand . 
  for her ? 
  i 'm curious too, 
  we have zombie ( a guy who 's freakishly un-chokeable ), 
  the rule of thumb is , if it 's on a `` meaty '' part ( like the biceps ) it hurts less . 
  if it 's on a `` bony '' part ( like the elbow ) it hurts more . 
  no difference , the real difference is lining vs. shading . 
  they 're different needles . 
  lining is worse imo . 
  that depends on your pain threshold and the tattoers schedule . 
  i would n't reccomend getting * as much done as possible in a week * . 
  it 's permanent , you know . 
  chris brown being beaten to death . 
  by a woman . 
  brace yourself , i guess . 
  and do n't drink the day before . 
  getting tattoed sucks hung over . 
  drunk is fine , ** hung over ** is n't . 
  i 've never seen santa , but * every year * i still get presents . 
  it 's magic . 
  i guess that is true . 
  i have a bunch of tattoer friends , and they do n't mind me having a few when i get tattooed . 
  posting on shrooms , are we ? 
  or gabi garcia . 
  see , now that 's a match i would pay to see . 
  my mother in law believes in horoscopes , birth-crystals , numerology , tarot cards ... the works . 
  she talks about lizard people , and how certain humans are related to angels . 
  when our oldest daughter was born 4 years ago , she went to a * psychic * to `` reveal my kids destiny '' . 
  she was given a `` star map '' to give the child * as she came of age * , as well as a ( what appreared to be plastic to me ) `` crystal '' that was supposed to go under her pillow at night ( what a great idea , give a toddler an object less than an inch across to play with in bed ) , and was given her `` personal number '' , which supposedly is `` magic '' and * will help her in life * . 
  naturally i put my foot down and refused any of this crap in our house . 
  to make matters worse , the quack ... erm ... * psychic * charged my mother in law close to $ 500 for his services . 
  she still believes in all of this and thinks i 'm being `` narrow minded '' . 
  if you want to lose weight , you have to spend more calories than you consume . 
  there 's coke , and then theres ** too much coke **, 
  i have two girls , one 4 year old and a seven month old . 
  i generally get 2-3 training sessions per week . 
  my wife is very supportive , though . 
  and i make sure i 'm home 'till their bedtime . 
  my classes are between 6 and 7.30 pm and i do open mat saturdays at 10 am . 
   he 's also very good at football . 
  understatement of the day . 
  if he was n't such an arrogant cocky bastard , he would be rated among the top ten active footballers . 
  i do n't care for turkey . 
  they seem to play far too aggressively , although they have some great technical players . 
  now you tell us . 
  i 'm thinking a little outside the box here , maybe arda turan ? 
  would love to se him in sky blue . 
  i like arda, 
  yeah , he 's `` old '' . 
  but chances are he would fit right in our team . 
  arda probably has 3-4 great seasons left in him i would guess . 
  that experience is needed too .
