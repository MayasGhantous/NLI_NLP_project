  the codes for all the nukes was literally [ 00000000 ] ( http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/12/launch-code-for-us-nukes-was-00000000-for-20-years/ ), 
  well , i hear this line in bjj class all the time . 
  try bjj if you get the chance . 
  small world , i know some people from your town !, 
  look it up . 
  that woman is quite possibly 70 years old now . 
  ~ ~ wonder what she looks like ~ ~, 
  no , but set your goals and finish as soon as possible . 
  i started uni at 32 , but ( insert very grown up stuff ) has made my studies advance * very * slowly . 
  it 's hard with kids especially . 
  also , do n't expect to hang out with your fellow students , you 'll see ... 
  well ... do you know the gainer guys ? 
  * the god delusion * by richard dawkins will certainly challenge a couple of viewpoints you may not even know you have . 
  any sigur ros song . 
  i agree . 
  dawkins comes off as condescending at times . 
  i think it 's just his personality though , very academic , very * english * haha . 
  i still like him and enjoy his antics . 
  sam harris seems like a more * likeable * version of dawkins to many people , perhaps a little more approachable to the `` common man '' . 
  thanks for the input , man . 
  thanks , worked bars for years so i can definately relate . 
  i got ta say , as a massive isis fan , they just got better and better imo . 
  i rate wavering radiant at number one . 
  but they 're all masterpieces . 
  `` not to sound racist , but ... '', 
  does anyone know what the guy is crying about ? 
  i 'll take `` n '' for 500 , alex !, 
  tell me more , i have a 3 year old and a newborn . 
  when do they leave ???!? 
  ... * today *, 
  probably fucking mumford and sons . 
  edit : the worst * band * ** ever ** in the history of music . 
  they fucking suck so much , it 's ** impossible ** for anyone else to suck as much as them ever in history . 
  i mean , they 're worse that nickelback and coldplay combined . 
  what a piece of shit band . 
  to dumb down . 
  honestly , why do you think i would like you to be dumber ? 
  do you think i 'm dumb ? 
  that 's insulting . 
  no sex for you . 
  in the afterglow of a really , really nice mushroom trip . 
  preferrably in the woods on a sunny day . 
  i saw some some `` orbs '' of light when i looked out the window a rainy summer night when i was very little . 
  maybe i was 6 or 8 years old . 
  they were dancing around the corner of the house and i was awake for some reason in the middle of the night , and they were just floating away from me - kinda dancing with light in the rain . 
  i just remember thinking that i did n't know what it was , but i was n't scared . 
  i 've never forgotten that . 
  because this is the internet , and you 're taking shit way too seriously . 
  manto is pretty good . 
  not expensive . 
  great quality . 
  just ordered my 2nd `` x pro '' . 
  i just put on reign in blood on the head phones and poured my first * go to sleep whisky * . 
  how you copin ' ? 
  well la-di-da, 
  slay-yyyeeeaaaaarrrhhhhggghh !, 
  dude , i 'm as chill as the beach boys on a sunday smoking herb . 
  rule no. 1 : keep it light . 
  if you lay out all the stuff you * think * you need , take another long think and see if you really need it . 
  the worst thing ever is to haul stuff you never use . 
  seventh son . 
  we have both our parents on both sides helping out , it 's all good . 
  never , right ? 
  yes !, 
  it 's a compliment . 
  take it . 
  naked in front of the computer . 
  i got to know the singer from gainer some years ago . 
  he was teching for a band i know , and my band was on the same tour . 
  living together on a bus for a month gets you really close , really fast !, 
  sopranos - pine barrens . 
  it 's the one where paulie and chris fuck up with the russian spetznaz guy in the jersey woods . 
  it 's dark , funny , realistic and just great writing . 
  also : directed by steve buscemi . 
  scientific source ? 
  not youtube or the like . 
  the thing is , with speculation like this you 're ** not ** taking into account that the majority of muslims living in the westenr world are peace loving , normal working average-joes that just want to feed their kids . 
  this kind of polarization is whats feeding the ukips etc. 
  sosiological studies ( i do n't have the link handy right now ) suggest that radicalism disapperas with education in two generations . 
  most of these `` extremists '' are the de facto minority and are simply making so much noise , they 're the only ones you notice . 
  do you know if you could get this online ? 
  cool , do you think i 'll be able to order the counterpain plus to europe ? 
  i speak four languages , my mother tongue ( which is weird and not a lot of people speak it ) , english , german and french . 
  i think in the mother tongue . 
  oh , the rich and their problems ... 
  i got those in pill form for my old man back issues . 
  thanks , though !, 
  ah , gross . 
  i 'll try it out . 
  look at this , paulie !, 
  it 's a bag full of 'em !, 
  ... until all your roommates die because of you . 
  post-metal & post-rock are pretty interchangeable . 
  slow metal with indie influences as a whole . 
  that nazi can go fuck himself . 
  for horses ? 
  i 'm pretty , but i ai n't * that * pretty, 
  thanks for the tip !, 
  i 'll look into a foam roller , for sure . 
  get real nasty .
