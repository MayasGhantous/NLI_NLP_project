  reading is awesome, 
  my wife will literally hand me our toddler to answer a text . 
  like , `` quick hold her '' . 
  it ' s always her other mom friends and all they text about is kids . 
  so why text about the kid , instead of * actuallly relating to them ? 
  * i do n't know . 
  sometimes , i leave my phone on vibrate for hours without checking it and she looks at me like i 'm out of my mind when i say something like `` oh , i have 3 missed calls and a text '' . 
  she thinks i 'm being rude to these people some how . 
  i just do n't care if i 'm not available all the fucken time . 
  `` i thought doing meth all through the pregnancy would kill it '', 
  sliding doors ... 
  well , that 's gon na end in tears . 
  night shift in a psych ward, 
  great guitar . 
  you 'll have it for ages . 
  whale . 
  you show up to win . 
  you 're getting that job . 
  that job is your bitch . 
  now do it . 
  i think you have to ask yourself what kind of evidence you need to support your belief . 
  let me try to answer your questions :, 
  ** you ask if faith is a good way to know something ** . 
  and by something , i presume you 're talking about religious truth or religious morals . 
  well , faith is not proof of anything . 
  anybody can * believe * whatever they want . 
  i can claim that elvis is my god , just as much as a christian can claim his beliefs . 
  neither can provide proof . 
  if you are looking to * know * something , especially in the lines of ethics and morals , you will meet many schools of philosophical thought , but in this field not many * absolute truths * are claimed . 
  a great book on secular morality is peter singer 's * practical ethics * , it 's a brick - but a good read . 
  ** you ask if christian ethics are a good moral framework ** . 
  the golden rule ( do onto others , etc. . . ) is admirable and promotes good . 
  i my experience it 's hard to follow through , and even harder it seems the more religious you are . 
  like you mentioned , some of the most closed minded people i know are also religious . 
  the ten commandments are pretty much your garden variety common sensical `` truths '' anyway , so most people already follow them , regardless of their religion/non-religion . 
  i would suggest you enroll in university and take philosophy . 
  you will most probably enjoy that . 
  speak up , i ca n't hear you though your windpipe hole . 
  edit : truth hurts , huh . 
  maybe 5 times in the last 20 years . 
  that 's fucking pushing it !, 
  luke 6:31, 
  when i was a kid , i was told that if i kept making faces , it would stay that way . 
  all lies . 
  so , a lot of people blame their parents for things their parents actually did not know or were never told themselves . 
  remember , no kid comes with a manual . 
  all parents learn on the fly . 
  i know this , because i 'm a parent now . 
  and the moment i became a father , i realised one very important thing : my parents did n't know a fucking thing either , and were * probably * just doing and trying their best . 
  however that worked out . 
  now , i know some people have had some pretty awful experiences out there , and i 'm not even close to understanding what that must be like . 
  vacuuming is awesome . 
  do n't do that . 
  put me back into the earth , into the eco system again to feed a plant or whatever wants to feed on it . 
  when she * got up * , i laughed so hard . 
  what a bitch . 
  what a fucking cunty bitch . 
  am i just going off here , or are these kinds of people just drawn to religion ? 
  my father ( who is a redneck fundamentalist christian ) will outright * laugh * while looking at news of palestinian children killed by israeli rockets . 
  because they are `` god chosen people , they can send rockets to kill these muslim ( i do n't even want to say ) '' . 
  look at the bright side , mate . 
  at least you know who the office jerk is . 
  happiness is a choice, 
  were you taught proper soviet history in school ? 
  did they mention the gulag ? 
  what about ww1 and the aftermath , revolution , agricultural `` revolution '' and the build up to ww2 ? 
  how was stalin portrayed ? 
  illusion is a choice . 
  what 's the news on yaya ? 
  at the gates of the north lies the old whore that is my port . 
  how about the most high profile public office in the world , the oval office ? 
  mlk died in 1968 , he could n't have signed that eighties guitar ( or whatever it is , not pre 68 ), 
  babe died in fucken 1948 !, 
  same fucken reason . 
  these ca n't be real, 
  goth chicks are trouble . 
  they listen to the cure , wear black and are damn sexy , but one of these days they 're gon na cheat on you with * two * dudes at the same time . 
  because they hurt on the inside . 
  gravity . 
  like someone could ever film that . 
  talking about my kids when i 'm shitfaced . 
  i apparantly get very emo . 
  oh , this was 15 + years ago . 
  i 'm peachy . 
  these ca n't be real, 
  a * little * more , i would guess . 
  depends specifically on the guys , really . 
  who gets the rammstein dildo boxed set , i would guess . 
  all ex . 
  female homosexual ex . 
  lawyer cops * love * rammstein . 
  sweet tele , guy . 
  the entire death catalog . 
  oh my god , you just posted my favorite reocrd . 
  post this * and * get banned in / r/christianity ? 
  double whammy !, 
  do you usually fall for the * pull my finger * trick ? 
  theres something on your shirt by the way . 
  ... some goths hid in a very desolate factory in berlin and survived on joy division records and drinking the sweat from the ironic ian curtis mock tribute dancing .
