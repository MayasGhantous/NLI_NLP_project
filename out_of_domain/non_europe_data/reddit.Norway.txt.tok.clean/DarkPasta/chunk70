  that would cost me about 18000 euro ( i smoked 20 a day , a pack of cigs where i live is 10 euro , times 365 x 5 = 1825 days x10 is 18250 euro ) , so that one first cigarette will cost me 18000 euro . 
  that is 20823 usd in todays rate . 
  that is one expensive cigarette . 
  imagine every cigarette after you quit has that price tag . 
  no , not at all . 
  sometimes even i feel that way . 
  and i ` m a truly shitty white belt . 
  i live in europe . 
  so nobody ever asks . 
  `` i am glad you are here with me . 
  here at the end of all things , ~ ~ sam ~ ~ i mean , maxwell . '', 
  `` thanks ? '', 
  james franco hosting the oscars . 
  the boss tu-2 . 
  how long did it take to get your blue ? 
  ( asking on behalf of every white belt ever ) . 
  the band maroon 5 . 
  because they sound like elevator music , and thats not meant as any form of compliment . 
  i like the * effect * of being in tune . 
  jesus navas ca n't score on an open goal . 
  amazing !, 
  that 's why you wear kevlar gloves . 
  to break the assholes mirror . 
  no , but really . 
  theres people out there mindlessly thinking it 's ok to hit a rider with a car because of some stupid pride issues . 
  honestly , some people just deserve a little vigilante action . 
  not saying it 's ok , but a man can dream . 
  just like on / r/soccer . 
  a bunch of tweens running their mouths . 
  sure , but these idiots are everywhere . 
  i mean , stupid drivers have tried to overtake me on the wrong side , break checked me , flipped me off . 
  all just for legally filtering and getting in front of the traffic . 
  sometimes you just wan na fucking punch these clowns . 
  granma and granpa need a trip to specsavers, 
  first , congrats !, 
  do n't expect everything to be * perfect * . 
  a lot of people seem to offer opinions about how one `` should '' do this or read that , but i 've found that everyone has different ways of coping with the massive life change that having a child ultimately is . 
  just be a good partner to your girlfriend . 
  expect the unexpected !, 
  she 'll get tired , emotional , stressed , start having wierd cravings , will start nesting etc. 
  just ... be supportive . 
  it 's a strange and wonderful time . 
  one universal thing for most parents though , sleep while you can . 
  really . 
  sleep will change for you , as in : you wo n't get much . 
  sleep will turn into the reward you chase , but never catch up on . 
  i have two little girls ( 4 and 1 ) and if i could have just * one wish * , it would be to have 7 hours of solid sleep every day . 
  but , hey , you could be one of the lucky ones and your baby will sleep though the night . 
  just do n't tell the rest of us grey faced dads that !, 
  5 kids ? 
  lem me buy you a beer , you 're a trooper !, 
  shoes, 
  ** revenge of the lawn , by richard brautigan **, 
  the noise my knees make when getting back up from the ol ` shitter . 
  one uppers, 
  i got my 15 month old to clap her hands and cheer `` yeaaaah '' , so whenever people get excited about * anything * really around her , she ` ll go `` yeaaaah '' and clap her hands . 
  people like that . 
  `` today '', 
  a bed . 
  the milk guard is legit, 
  i likes stripes , but i always thought caddyshack was just * a little bit * funnier . 
  but you ca n't go wrong with mill murray anyhow . 
  i 'm currently experiencing a bacterial infection on my face because it is supposedly something people speculate * not * doing after every class . 
  wash everything , * everything * after every class , regardless !, 
  good on ya dude !, 
  backgammon . 
  people waiting for their turn to speak . 
  the burger king shirt really hits the nail on the head there . 
  or through the hand , depends . 
  6th gear is when you hit 88 mph and fire emerges from your tires . 
  suddenly you 're in the fuckin * future * !, 
  still counts !, 
  surely you jest, 
  do n't tell sturgill simpson that . 
  awesome !, 
  an ex friend beat the shit out of someone for no apparent reason . 
  nope . 
  that fractions in maths is the same as drum beats . 
  nailed fractions for me . 
  costa must have some serious issues . 
  his behaviour is on the south side of sane . 
  or * being a right cunt * , in plain english . 
  this season has it all, 
  ah , the old `` he hits his wife ? 
  but he 's such a lovely lad at the pubs '' point . 
  theres quite a number of people from europe that have a team in their home town and a team in the english premiership . 
  or in england in general . 
  my father for example . 
  but think of the children they would make . 
  amazing , scarf wearing children with tactics from heaven . 
  dont they have this bloke james rodriguez in his position ? 
  or that * talentless waste of space * isco . 
  ( sarcasm , for the challenged redditor ) . 
  bale is obviously also * shite * . 
  hazard is right , he should go to real madrid . 
  getting in that team will be easy !, 
  totalitarian states tend do have things in common . 
  surprised to see that the north showed higher support than the south . 
  goes without saying i liked winters bone . 
  and deadwood .
