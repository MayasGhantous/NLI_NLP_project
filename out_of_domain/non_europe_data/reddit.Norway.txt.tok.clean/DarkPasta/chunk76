  i had the 1.6 sisu guard , and i was really happy with it . 
  lost it somehow , and now i 've gotten used to rolling without a guard . 
  i 'll buy a new one now , thanks for reminding me !, 
  the first four u2 albums . 
  `` go train '' - kurt osiander, 
  i love this band . 
  i have a planes skull tattoo , for gods sake . 
  it 's nice of you to still call your wife your * girlfriend * . 
  it 's willy wonkas factory !, 
  wrong . 
  it 's was during shitawatra . 
  thank you , i 'm a minstrel , a poet , a dancer . 
  signs , there were plural signs in your example . 
  snoop, 
  this is not the thread you 're looking for . 
  i try to live a rich life * before * death , not after . 
  one sv650 and * tons * of air bikes . 
  weird , mine are all at my air beach house in malibu . 
  sorry , mine is nekkid, 
  i put my bike in winter storage . 
  i just change stuff when the guy says it 's time . 
  i no do mechanic stuff , my head ai n't like that . 
  do n't be afraid , it 's just the tip . 
  scott carson is a champions league winner . 
  always . 
  about 50 i 'd say . 
  make a shit ton of money . 
  i 'm wrinting this on a macbook , while my appletv is a conduit for all my kids entertainment . 
  wait , thats my iphone buzzing . 
  got ta go . 
  that is proper bullshite, 
  no , you 're purple !, 
  you can not tour every month like that , though . 
  hey !, 
  we won against gillingham at wembley in \u00b4 99 too !, 
  and don ` t forget the championship in 2002 . 
  you can obviously say what you want , but to call city * inconsequential * , is a bit far fetched . 
  we 're a traditionally very strongly supported side from one of the biggest towns in blighty . 
  everything changed when the crazy money started pouring in , we know that too . 
  but to use descriptions like `` undeservedly '' when we fair and square have been one of the dominant sides in the pl the last , say 6 seasons ? 
  i think that 's unfair . 
  chelsea had n't won the league since 1955 when they had their first pl trophy in \u00b4 04 . 
  you can not seroiusly say that abramovich had * nothing * to do with that . 
  yes , we ` ve been fucking atrocious in europe , no argument there . 
  thats a recurring theme on r/soccer . 
  arguing with people generally too young or too new to football to really have a grasp of what * club history * really means . 
  i just love being called `` plastic fan '' or `` glory hunter '' , when youve partied in league one with your club and your star man was paul dickov . 
  shocker . 
  that is a * lot * of money , and certainly enough to start up a company . 
  my company would research and try to find renewable energy sources , or perhaps other environmental ventures such as oceanic clean up . 
  and i would still have more than enough to live a * very * comfortable life for my family and i. 
  his shirt number !, 
  well , i think maybe it 's time for me to look at * investing * in said type of company . 
  no , it would n't, 
  you may find it hard to believe , but furniture is getting more and more popular in the office environment . 
  whoa , now . 
  totalitarian regimes have been present pretty much since recorded history . 
  an example today would be the islamic state or saudi arabia . 
  * fascism * per se ? 
  francos spain , perons argentina . 
  neo-fascism extsts all over europe , just look at neo-nazis in germany , ukraine and in many other eastern european countires . 
  theres also golden dawn in greece . 
  wherever you see ultra nationalism , you have a foundation for fascist ideas . 
  weed is like vitamins for thinking , you know . 
  fuck that clown , hack , self-help writer , his `` profound insights '' in the alchemist probably stems from oprah outtakes . 
  his message is `` when you really want something to happen , the whole universe conspires so that your wish comes true '' , or you know , just steal it from hard working jewellers . 
  if they would just play some ~ ~ wild stallions ~ ~ wyld stallyns we could have world peace . 
  ftfy, 
  i take it you 're not a cop then . 
  `` and i often tell friends : when you do n't know what to do , do nothing . 
  get quiet so you can hear the still , small voice -- your inner gps guiding you to true north . '', 
  in other words ; `` take a moment and think it over '' . 
  jeez . 
  the moment i start taking life tips from oprah , coelho and the like i might as well getting tarot cards tell me who to trust or determining my personality traits from astrology . 
  some things are just so plain dumb , such obivous trite bullshit , that i ca n't comprehend why people eat it up . 
  making people like oprah , coelho , eckhart tolle etc. 
  filthy rich in the process . 
  but thank * you * mr. ballzdeepe for letting me * come out * , it 's been a pleasure . 
  idiocracy, 
  common courtesy,

  if we hurry , we can regress back to the middle ages in a few generations !,
