  thanks , i guess that makes sense . 
  it 's okay , you 're one of us now . 
  next time , replace you/your with we/our in your posts , 
  wish i saw that post ... at least i had him , and lukaku got one goal . 
  last year i built a decent size porch/veranda with a nice view and lots of evening sun . 
  now i need some furniture to utilize it , 
  outdoor furniture is expensive , especially when the size is above standard . 
  therefor , i made a sketch of the furniture i have in mind to diy . 
  i want to have room for a lot of people around the table , so i might want it even bigger than what the drawing suggests . 
  i will also make it a bit rough in the design , and it should be able to just stand there all year trough . 
  cold snowfilled winters and dry hot summerdays . 
  so i expect the wood to be working quite a bit . 
  i was thinking of using treated pinewood . 
  what should i do to prevent it from self destructing ? 
  avoid wooden glue ? 
  i imagine all the working of the wood would make the glue slip after a while . 
  will it be strong enough to support lots of fat drunk guys ? 
  should the table be wider to room more grilled food ? 
  the materials in the drawings is 2 `` 2 '' , 2 `` 4 '' and 2 `` 8 '' . 
  is there some weaknesses to the drawings that should be improved ? 
  any input would be greatly appreciated . 
  translation : 280cm = 9ft 2in and 100cm = 3ft 3in ( roughly ), 
  i just bought myself a new 60 '' lg 60lb870v , a sweet tv , and i have a asrock vision ht 321b htpc sporting a core i5 3210m cpu and hd4000 gpu . 
  now , i mostly use it to watch tv shows , movies and streaming premier league football . 
  the provider for my football streams gives me 25 fps , while most of my movies/tv shows is in 23,24,25,29 and 30 fps . 
  now , ideally my gpu should identify this and swap fps automatically , but i do n't think it does . 
  does it ? 
  so , should i put it on 60 hz , 59 hz or 50 hz ? 
  default was 59 hz . 
  also a quick note , i run 1920x1080p at 125 % dpi scaling , guessing that 's ok ... 
  i 've got a simple setup with a tv , soundbar , ps4 and a htpc . 
  if i browse the internet without any audio on , even just for a short while , the audio will be delayed for about a second . 
  the `` quickfix '' is to turn the tv off and back on again . 
  however , if i keep a audiotrack on or watch netflix or similar , the audio stays in sync . 
  why is it like this , and what can i do to avoid it ? 
  [ render of how it looks today ] ( http://imgur.com/a/jyx0r#1 ) . 
  as it is , the big 60 '' tv is kinda dominating and screaming , despite it 's narrow beezel . 
  i was thinking a darker color could tone it down . 
  btw , the tv is a [ lg 60lb870v ] ( http://www.lg.com/no/tv/lg-60lb870v ) . 
  [ old photo with a smaller 47 '' tv ] ( http://imgur.com/a/jyx0r#0 ) . 
  [ render of a dark brown color ] ( http://imgur.com/a/jyx0r#2 ) . 
  this color compliments the existing color very nicely . 
  but i might want it even darker . 
  [ render of a black color ] ( http://imgur.com/a/jyx0r#3 ) . 
  this color is a very popular choice for contrasts on tv walls , and i also enjoy this a lot . 
  i think i like this one better than the one above . 
  [ here 's an example of how it looks ] ( http://lady.inspirasjonsblogg.jotun.no/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/male-tv-vegg_grottenveien.jpg ) . 
  [ render of a black color and black stand ] ( http://imgur.com/a/jyx0r#4 ) . 
  same as above , but here i 've also replaced the `` tv stand '' to one in a high gloss black . 
  i think it matches the other items on that wall , also having brushed aluminum details . 
  the one thing i 'm afraid of with this setup is that it might be to much of a contrast . 
  like it does n't fit the rest of the room . 
  any feedback to help me decide is very welcome . 
  so i 've finally booked 5 tickets for my friends and i to the home game against spurs , april 19th . 
  none of us has ever been to newcastle , and i 'm pretty sure i 've leveled up my googleing twice , just today . 
  booked rooms at the waterside hotel . 
  the game is on sunday , so warming up on saturday with some other games , beers and hamburgers i guess . 
  chelsea-manu should be a good game to watch . 
  where would we go ? 
  will the strawberry be full , or maybe even empty since it 's not matchday ? 
  how 's players ? 
  crows nest ? 
  nine ( shearer 's ) ? 
  we 're 30-35 years old norwegians if that matters . 
  we 're looking for a pub which will show the games with audio , not avicii , and hopefully not too crowded to get decent seats . 
  i 'd say it 's kind of a mark knopfler style . 
  he sings `` i can see the color of your aura , baby . 
  color if your aura baby '' . 
  i 'm pretty sure `` aura '' is the word he 's using . 
  there 's also a bit where he sings `` in the garden , the kids are free to play . 
  in the garden , the kids are free to stay '' . 
  there 's also a small part about `` desert '' , but i ca n't remember the part around it . 
  i 've used to hear this in the helicopters going to and back from work on a oil rig , but i could n't shazaam it there . 
  they 've taken it off their playlist by now . 
  on google searches , i 've hit others looking for the same song , but no answers . 
  i 've asked about this one on other forums also without success , you 're my last hope reddit ... 
  i 've been a casual fifa player since fifa '13 and usually prefer to play with newcastle in online season , solo or co-op . 
  i have n't quite figured out fifa16 and the squad yet , so would like to hear how you guys play , formations , tactics etc. 
  i have had a horrible start at my fifa16 campaign . 
  i usually pick players based on their total score , which might not be a smart move ... 
  i 've just learned about the [ pi musicbox ] ( http://www.pimusicbox.com ) and thought i could use this to control the music in my bathroom . 
  what i imagine is that i connect a spring-loaded light switch , type ( on ) - off . 
  i imagine this would be connected to the gpio . 
  the function would be like this :, 
  press once , and it turns on/play . 
  press again , and it turns off/stops/pause . 
  i assume it will continue the previous playlist or radio channel when i press on/play . 
  the second function would be longpress to increase volume , and longpress again to decrease volume . 
  kinda like an electronic dimmer on lights works . 
  is this possible ? 
  is it extremely hard ? 
  or does it already exist ? 
  it does n't have to be the pi musicbox . 
  i think this would be way more practical than using the mobile or tablet every time myself or a guests goes into the bathroom . 
  so i started learning python yesterday , following the `` automate the boring stuff with python programming '' . 
  i made the guessing game , but i wanted to make it more complex , so i added some functionality . 
  there 's currently two issues i ca n't seem to figure out . 
  if i input a str instead of a int , i get the valueerror . 
  i want a error message telling the player to input a number between given limits . 
  i want to display the wrong attempts in the game over print , but i ca n't get the list to work .
