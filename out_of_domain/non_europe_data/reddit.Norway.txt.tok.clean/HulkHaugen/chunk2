  but i used on of these ( http://www.biltema.no/productimages/16/medium/16-231_m.jpg ) in the center of the x to lower the screw/bolt inside . 
  the screw/bolt i used was on of these http://media.byggtjeneste.no/media/bilde/89916/large, 
  those bolts are hidden by the `` crossbar '' on the inside . 
  here you go : https://drive.google.com/file/d/0b9i2npo5tz6jx0los2xkwjbcule/edit?usp=sharing, 
  please let me know if i just published my whole private life by mistake ... 
  yeah , the idea was to lay down some sheep wool/skin or something on the bench ... 
  lol . 
  it 's basically just 2 `` 8 '' , 4 `` 4 '' and 1,5 `` x3 '' materials . 
  and its 96 `` x40 '' ( bench is 16 '' deep ), 
  you have the latest version ? 
  try to download it again maybe ? 
  oh dear god , let 's hope it does n't come to that , hehe . 
  i expect some movement , i think it will be ok . 
  i actually put the 5 main boards every other way , dunno if that is a good thing or not but it made sense to me . 
  i do  thanks !, 
  i think you 're right about that , 
  south , but yeah , 
  i 've actually been scouting this fixture earlier , but found it too expensive . 
  i did plan on buying it without the ( italian ? ), 
  crystal glasses ( they 're expensive ) , but that did not seem possible . 
  that 's why i did n't hesitate when i saw the `` cheap '' online ... 
  yes , it 's nice and cheap . 
  do n't understand why it 's that cheap , but i like it , 
  i think you 're right , 
  true . 
  i did n't even think about that . 
  but my emergency plan was always that if it turns out bad , i 'll throw it outside and use it on the patio ... 
  true , but the short ones on the ens is there for the looks , not practical reasons . 
  they probvably were n't needed on the bench , but i did that first as a trail ... 
  i actually got some inspiration from that site . 
  there are many benefits of using x-legs instead of regular vertical on the corners . 
  i can have a full length bench and shove it in under the table , the legs come between the legs of the persons sitting on the ends , and i can fit two persons comfortably on the short ends . 
  nope , 2 `` 4 '' is to massive imo , i used 1.5 '' by 3 '' , dunno if that is common in the us . 
  2 `` 4 is 48x96mm her in eu ... 
  the scenery is great , i live on top of a hill near my town . 
  it 's a town called arendal south in norway . 
  this is my view : http://finncdn.no/mmo/2012/3/9/3/336/557/43_1745544767_xl.jpg, 
  cool . 
  ysk it looks bigger irl than on the pics . 
  4 guys can sit very comfortably on that bench , 5 can sit there in a crowded situation ... 
  i 'm currently an rov pilot ... 
  when it comes to wood , we use inches practically . 
  we say 2 `` 4 , but officially we use mm . 
  i considered 2 `` 4 , but i felt it was to massive for this build , and i wanted it to be as minimal as possible . 
  that 's why i went for 1.5 `` 3 instead ... 
  edit : http://www.lightglobesonline.com.au/assets/dono.pdf, 
  it 's actually quite trendy , at least here in scandinavia . . 
  chairs coming soon ... 
  i did spend a lot on that fixture . 
  most of my friends thought i was crazy for doing so , even though they like it ( they say ) . 
  as an rov pilot , i make about $ 100.000 annually ( 1582 hrs/year ) , depends on overtime etc. 
  i am educated as an electrician and appreciate nice lighting , and i hate seeing downlight/spotlights used as main lighting in a room , especially the nicer rooms . 
  nice light fixtures usually cost a lot , and this one comes with 48 nice crystal glasses that can be used and washed in the dishwasher . 
  it even looks much better live , 
  edit : i did regret the purchase and did return it , but the seller changed here mind and would n't refund it , so i had to take it back . 
  it was a lot of money , but now above this big dining table , it looks awesome , 
  it does , 
  thanks , i 'll look into that , 
  gas burner and a steel brush, 
  you 're joking , right ? 
  if you do a google image search for `` dining table bench '' , you 'll see that it is quite common to have a bench on one side and chairs on the other side . 
  it 's quite trendy in this part of the world atm ... 
  nope , i 'm not that good , lol . 
  it 's a ( danish ? ), 
  design lamp with real crystal glasses . 
  here 's a google image search for the fixture :, 
  it 's a fabbian dono d65 a05-a06, 
  i just thought about it ; if you really want to copy this design and have access to a steel cutter , i do n't think it 's that hard to make . 
  the frame itself transfers the current to the bulbs with 5-12v ac , and the bulb holders are just kind of squeezed on . 
  i can show close ups if that is of interest ... 
  well , i hang it up yesterday not long before posting this on here . 
  before i had the time to put the glasses up , my mother came on a visit and thought it looked great . 
  she did n't know there were suppose to be glasses on there . 
  i say it looks good w/o glasses , but the glasses makes it even better . 
  since there is 4 different types of glasses , it has a `` random '' look , so taking down a few of them wo n't spoil to look at all imo ... 
  45\u00a01/2 '' x19 11/16 '' x6 1/2 '', 
  thanks , it 's a fabbian dono d65, 
  this is not very advanced , it just takes some patience . 
  i 've always liked doing crafts , not because it 's cheaper , but because it 's fun ( when you have the right tools ) . 
  i 'm educated as an electrician , but i do most of the renovation myself , tearing down and putting up walls , plastering , painting , replacing windows and doors , even pick the boat engine completely apart to replace all the worn parts . 
  this project was my first ever furniture diy and it was fun , but it would have been much better if i could do it indoors or if it did n't get dark and cold so early as it does this time of the year . 
  also annoying when the rain coming in from time to time , and all i can do is to panic , pick up that heavy table , squat and run inside the garage like a crabman ... 
  yes , but i 've also used wooden screws with the kreg jig every 30cm , i think . 
  on the underside . 
  nope . 
  should i ? 
  i will utilize both sides , but i 'm waiting for four chairs that shall be on the other side ... 
  i 'm open to suggestions . 
  how could it be done ? 
  do you think i could benefit from removing the screws ? 
  worst case , i make a new top , better . 
  riminds me about a quote from tim minchins rock & roll nerd : '' ... rebel against the state , but just for now that 'd have to wait cos he 's running late for his morning classes . '', 
  i considering this . 
  i do have have a 60/60 mbps fiber line , but so many videos have been loading extremely slow lately , even in 360p/240p . 
  quite annoying . 
  i see some of my friends have the same problem , even though they also have quite decent lines ... 
  interesting , but according to those tests , nothing wrong here . 
  i guess it 's the `` local '' youtube server load or something like that ... 
  i use it to draw my home , make new floorplans , furniture etc. 
  i also use it at work on some occasions to draw electrical wiring diagrams .
