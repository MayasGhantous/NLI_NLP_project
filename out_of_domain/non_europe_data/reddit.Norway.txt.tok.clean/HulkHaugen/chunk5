  there are n't many options at 4.5 m tho ... 
  i like to believe that when i play someone with a nick like angryanalrapist , it 's really prince william or someone classy like him on the other end . 
  so you 're saying you have recorded/downloaded matches stored locally , and you want them organized ? 
  i think the top priority should be a cb . 
  we got some interesting new players going forward , even though i would like to see a bigger name brought in . 
  ** party ** - pretty much universal party music for most people, 
  ** chill ** - when party music is to nagging , and i need to relax, 
  ** boat hist ** - for outdoor party , much the same as * party * , but focusing on happy beats, 
  ** rock ** - classic new and old rock mix, 
  ** memories ** - collection of songs that has made a big impact on me , not necessarily very good musically . 
  ** x-mas ** - need i say more ? 
  ** alternative ** - cool music that might be to alternative for the * party * playlist . 
  ** boogie night ** - upbeat good old gold , always makes me happy . 
  ** fuckin ' hell ** - angy music to get me pumped for a workout . 
  i think that 's about it, 
  edit : formatting, 
  my joker here is bojan at stoke . 
  brilliant player who was suppose to be the new messi , but something went wrong . 
  still a good player that * might * just take off . 
  hard to say , but at 5.5 m , i think he 's well worth the investment . 
  thanks for your post  as far as i can see , the * real cinema * is only possible to enable if i set my htpc to 1080/24p output , and i 'd rather have it at 50 or 60 hz . 
  as for plex , i have a funny feeling that the advanced refresh rate settings you 're talking about is only for the desktop version and not for the win8 app . 
  am i right ? 
  still looking into that . 
  the football i 'm streaming has both a webui in the browser and a neat win8 app , but i ca n't imagine they 've put such advanced settings into it . 
  still have to look though . 
  to my limited knowledge , i imagine this would be `` easiest '' if it was possible to set some global settings in the intel driver ... 
  interesting that you say that . 
  i do n't experience much judder , i just want the optimal settings now that i finally invested in an awesome tv . 
  chelsea, 
  man utd, 
  arsenal, 
  man city, 
  liverpool, 
  everton, 
  newcastle, 
  random, 
  golden boot : diego costa ( i know it 's his first season , but , uhmm , yeah . 
  sacked : alan pardew ( hopfully , but not before pulis gets another job . 
  do n't want him ) . 
  officially , i think santon is injured . 
  he 's usually 1st choice . 
  a lot of people expected ha\u00efdara to start since he has been playing a lot and doing quite well during pre-season . 
  still , pards choose dummett . 
  i do n't think pardew thrusts ha\u00efdaras defensive skills and lack of experience . 
  not that santon is particular good on the defensive side ... 
  thanks for your feedback . 
  if i understand you correctly , this is a xbmc specific fix , and i 'm using plex and several other sources , such as youtube , a football streaming service and others . 
  now , it 's not that it 's quiet for the first few seconds , it 's rather that the audio is not in sync with the video . 
  i 've been thinking about running hdmi trough the soundbar , and use arc for getting audio from the ps4 . 
  i do n't know how arc works yet , but i guess i 'll find out . 
  about the soundbar , this can be set to either dts , dd or pcm . 
  i currently have it set at pcm , and i ca n't say i notice any difference . 
  it 's a 2.1 soundbar btw ... 
  i 've tried connecting the htpc to the * hdmi input * on the soundbar now and a hdmi from soudbar * hdmi arc out * to the * hdmi arc in * on the tv . 
  seems to be working , need some more testing to verify . 
  however , now i ca n't get any audio from the gaming console . 
  it still plays the htpc audio when i change source on the tv . 
  if i shut down the pc , just noting . 
  btw , the console is connected to the * hdmi in 2 * . 
  what 's up with arc ? 
  good production and narration , enjoyable to watch . 
  think they should have used flat push-on terminals instead of soldering the power switch though . 
  much the same as in norway . 
  but the money you get during high school depends on two factors . 
  if you study in a different city , you usually get enough to rent a cheap apartment ( used to be about $ 500 , but i 'm old now ) . 
  if your parent ( s ) earn less than a given income , you 're entitled to some extra cash . 
  i used to get about $ 200 since my mother earned little ( father did n't count since i did n't live with him . ), 
  on the other hand , i was in high school about 10 years ago . 
  also , if you get a grade in your classes , up to 50 % of your student loans will be erased . 
  ( again , my numbers can be off , long time since i did this . ), 
  what am i looking at ? 
  does n't all the swedes already work in norway ? 
  - benefits of norway is higher salary , beautiful nature and a cheap neighbor on the east side . 
  - benefits of sweden is cheaper cars , alcohol and an awesome neighbor on their west side . 
  all in all , they 're pretty much the same ... 
  hate this one in norway . 
  we spell it the same , but pronounce it ** resturang ** . 
  yup , none of those are silent ... 
  personally , i think less of him than loic remy . 
  he has n't been that good for manu , and he will probably get less chances for us . 
  dunno , if the price is right , he 'd probably be a starter for us as the situation is now ... 
  i think we 'll see something like ( 4-4-1-1 ) :, 
  hoping that sdj will start , and would also like to see ha\u00efdara over dummet this time . 
  if riviere is struggling , i would n't mind if we gave perez another try , he seemed quite dangerous out for us last week . 
  hwtl !!, 
  i think we have a good chance of winning this one , 
  of course he is  in for gouffran then . 
  buf i have a feeling gouffran will start , so it 's probably anita going out , given that sdj is fit ... 
  giroud might have broken his anckle , and could be out for up to three months . 
  who should i bring in instead ? 
  already used my ft , so will take a 4 pints hit ( or use my wildcard ) . 
  rumors of them also bringing in remy , eto'o or welbeck . 
  if they go for remy , it should be an easy choice ... 
  pov stop-motion through the canal . 
  ( i 'm on of the guys on the fwd deck ), 
  i know , want to hold out for remy if they bring him in . 
  on the other hand , if giroud 's injury puts him out for 3 months , i guess his price will fall drastically ... 
  i could also swap eriksen or mata for siggi , and free up some money for a more expensive attacker , but even though , i do n't see any clear option ...
