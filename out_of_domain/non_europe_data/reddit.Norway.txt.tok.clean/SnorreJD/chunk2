  when i first saw this post , i thought it said `` non-beliebers '' ... what is wrong with my brain , * sigh * . 
  piracy . 
  or watching child pornography on accident . 
  as i see it , you would be in the caf\u00e9 business , and not the raw coffee bean business , so concider that . 
  this reminds me of the movie syriana, 
  when i was a kid our teacher in elementary school saw one of the girls bending over and he stuck he car key in her a ** . 
  he twisted it around , and later winked at her ... 
  * brb , googling shoulder check *,

  boom !, 
  i recently started playing gta iv b/c i have such fond memories of playing san andreas and gta i as a kid . 
  no dialing each time ? 
  mind blown . 
  yo selena : if your thing with justin bieber does n't work out ... i might know someone who can write a song about it . 
  i worked as a telemarketer for a cell phone company last summer , and i can honestly say that this is how 20 % of the calls go . 
  the software they use will probably call him back , and some random poor co-worker will get to take the call .

  if you are infact from norway you would know that she speaks english also . 
  the question is , did you mean * too bad she does n't post in english * ? 
  which would make more sense , but still none what so ever if you are norwegian .

  i do n't have a solution for you , but i just want to say that i feel your pain . 
  aspies are often suspected of lying/misreprestenting their feeling because of less eyecontact/the `` wrong '' facial expressions etc. 
  was anyone really surprised that this guy used to be a total jock . . ?

  would you rather be happy and bored or depressed and amused ? 
  if you where diagnosed with a mental disorder as an adult , how would you react ? 
  my god , that is cold . 
  i was recently diagnosed with asperger 's , and i see where this kid is comming from . 
  being 20 years old , most of the people my age have their social interactions via drinking/going to bars/night clubs which is not my thing . 
  so meeting other people is a huge challenge . 
  yes ofc , damn near impossible,

  if she is n't already , ask her to link to your product in her description box . 
  $ 1000 one time signing fee , and then $ 75 an hour for afterwork/upkeep . 
  this pricing strategy might require some convincing on the long term effects of your work , but nothing you ca n't handle ( just make up some numbers with nice graphs etc. ), 
  really dude ? 
  when avon came out of jail , the game had changed from shoot-outs over territory to franchise business deals . 
  string spear-headed this , but avon almost destroyed the whole operation by bringing his out-dated gangster bullshit mentality back onto the streets . 
  at least string did n't let pride get in the way of making money like avon did . 
  have you considered doing owner financing , where you the seller becomes the bank ? 
  if this picture was taken before the accident , he got pretty lucky with the pose considering the circumstances ... 
  i had no idea vince gilligan talks like badger in real life .

  easy on the bronzer there , selena . 
  possibly, 
  she is an established youtuber now with a video every week . 
  many of her colleagues is in this video . 
  i had no idea her voice was that high pitched . 
  seems like this is a thing that is already happening . 
  do n't know where you will get the financing to start several shops at once ...

  it does not appear there , and i did n't touch the computer at the time , should i open it and see if anything is unplugged ? 
  i 've had if for 2 + years and it has been working just fine . 
  i did restart the computer but nothing happened . 
  i have noe idea if the motherboard can see the drive , how do i check that ? 
  this is my secondary drive where i keep all my movies and stuff , the os runs on my c drive . 
  the d drive does not show up anywhere .
