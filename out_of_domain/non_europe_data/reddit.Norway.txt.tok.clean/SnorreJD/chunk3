  if you had the option of guaranteed world peace for 100 years , but you had to live in celibacy for 25 years - would you go for it ? 
  would you break up with your so for 2 million dollars , if not - how much would it take ? 
  this is a grossly over simplified perspective .

  that 's terrible advice . 
  kids , do n't go to college for arts , drama , literature or anything of that nature . 
  i knew i should have added a no backsies clause . 
  also , i do n't know if your gf would get back with you after you dumped her for 200 dollars . 
  just out of curiousity , what country are we talking about ? 
  too soon, 
  if you could get the loan at a reasonable rate and get 6-9 % of the property value in yearly rent , then i say go for it and good luck to you . 
  if you want candid content , atleast now the vloggity is back . 
  that would be the capitalization rate . 
  based on the market you 're in , the risk you 're taking and the costs you have , that is usually what you should expect in return for the investment to make sense . 
  pay off your loans . 
  buy another house .
