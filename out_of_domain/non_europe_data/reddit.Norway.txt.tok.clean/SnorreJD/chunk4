  so what i think this one means : if you are a afghan national and you want to enter another country you 'll need a visa for almost every one ( which is not the norm ) . 
  that 's why they usually have a guy with a flag and a whistle standing there .

  no , it does n't match up with the seasons . 
  are you fucking retared or something ? 
  with her story the wedding was in the summer , but it was really in the fall . 
  this is not an american thing . 
  this is a people thing . 
  wow , so apparently he was arrested for having sex with a married woman , which was a crime at the time . 
  but it seemed like up until everything in bemidji , he followed a routine as a hitman , so what made him irrational all of a sudden ? 
  there is no way he could keep his job if wherever he went he acted like he did in bemidji . 
  his actions up until bemidji pretty much makes sense , but then he goes off the hinges for no apparent reason . 
  this is what confuses me a great deal . 
  whoops , apparently these are tributes made by contemporary artist on andy warhol 's anniversary . 
  this should be on / r/whatcouldgowrong, 
  what is something you want to do , but social stigma prevents you from doing it ? 
  i 'm not saying he did n't do crazy shit before aswell . 
  what i 'm saying is , his actions in bemidji was a no-way-back scenario , it 's not like he could keep taking jobs after that . 
  bemidji was different , and there 's no apparent reason why it should be , unless you count lester as an extraordinary person .

  it looks promising . 
  more money for their shareholders ... ? 
  `` running wild with bear grylls '' is new and seems ok . 
  he should document his income and minimum expenses and by that hopefully prove that he has no assets/is incapable of making proper downpayments . 
  by that point the credit company will accept that they have to take a hit on the loan . 
  how much depends on what he is able to pay them per month for say 7 years . 
  but it does n't make any sense , the new leadership in new york did n't want to kill tony . 
  also they gave the nj family a green light to kill `` the grey goose '' as part of the truce agreement .
