  why does the driver have like a 5 second reaction time ? 
  yeah , but he also has little regard for other peoples well-being . 
  everyone else he knows he pulls into his circle of crime . 
  still , tony could have fronted him the money to start a club , that way he would be part of the machine but not really in harms way . 
  i noticed this to . 
  when i saw the emma watson pic i knew he was messing with us . 
  does this map look like i thought that precision was the most important feature ? 
  just tourists and troll park owners . 
  you 're doing gods work . 
  amusement park with troll statues in it . 
  yes . 
  goomah is jargon used in the sopranos for mistresses , which everyone had . 
  just look at the username that posted the link and go to reddit.com/u/theirnamehere, 
  i guess it 's not funny if you have to have it explained to you, 
  now that 's just sad . 
  you must be new here ... 
  it would be interesting to see the export map equivalent of this . 
  this post is such a waste of time, 
  the takeaway : inflation exists . 
  thanks , op .

  / r/watchitfortheplot, 
  it think that can look cool , but it severly defigures your lobe . 
  there is just no turning back . 
  and will you notice a guy with ear piercings , that you otherwise would n't have ? 
  can someone please tell me wtf happened with the woman who was supposed to buy acn , but only use the news as leverage . 
  i consider myself well above average in the field of corporate finance , but i was n't able to follow . 
  psa : several people in this thread bring up the 4 billion dollars . 
  that was the deal for the parent company awn . 
  they sell acn to take the trophy out of the portfolio , but this is a much smaller deal ( let 's say 5 % of the 4 billion dollars for example ) . 
  now that 's just wrong . 
  leona tried to buy the whole thing awm for 4 billion , but she was n't able to get the money , so that 's why they are doing this other deal for only acn . 
  they were not looking for $ 4 billion from the lady who bought halifax, 
  leona is not selling acn to get the 4 billion to take over control , she is selling acn so the crystal hedge fund or whatever it was called does n't want to buy awm after all . 
  she was their aunt,

  honestly ... lose weight and get a tan, 
  you should n't have a pixie cut , it does n't suit you , it looks like you 're a little boy . 
  the septum nose ring and the cheekbone sticker does n't do you any favors either . 
  your pigmentation is neither here nor there , you could try to go full on ginger with your hair/eyebrows . 
  or darker with dark hair/eyebrows/make up . 
  hair is too short . 
  looks like you 'd melt in sunlight . 
  way too plain , nothing special at all . 
  looks like the murderer on a true crime show . 
  a lot of girls can look better without make up , but not you ... with make up : 8/10 . 
  without : 3/10, 
  not enough material to judge, 
  the most fair thing to do would be to pay the estate his icm equity and remove the chips from play . 
  yes . 
  looking for real life docuseries including murder mysteries like, 
  * ** making a murderer **, 
  * ** the jinx **, 
  * ** the staircase **, 
  any recommendations ? 
  ** veep ** looked bad on the surface , and i put off watching it for a long time . 
  but it is actually very good , like so many of the hbo shows . 
  i think you 'd like ** the brink ** . 
  it 's a overlooked and underrated show , somewhat similar to veep . 
  looking for another spy show from the cold war era similar to ** the americans ** and ** deutschland 83 **, 
  he is actually dead now ... 
  [ hardly `` white-looking '' though ] ( http://respect-mag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/tupac-and-kidada.jpg ), 
  amazon prime just released ** patriot ** , which seems highly promising . 
  has anyone seen it yet ? 
  54 million rolls of paper plus 50 % is not 100 million rolls stephen colbert ... 
  it seemed promising , finally a professional show about finance , i though . 
  buut it 's just way too similar to ** suits ** , which i 'm already watching . 
  not worth it imo . 
  yes . 
  i needed some time to warm up to it , but it was definitely worth it  it was funny and weird in all the right ways , and unlike any other tv show i 've seen . 
  do you guys have any recommendations for a show that is on the same level ? 
  yes !, 
  i 've watched every episode since s01 , but honestly this show has become pointless . 
  this show has no soul , and it 's not really funny anymore either . 
  for the first time i am considering dropping this show out of my rotation . 
  billions is quite similart to suits . 
  also white collar . 
  i would try to contact a rental broker like utleiemegleren.no or leie-bolig . no . 
  or maybe try to contact someone on airbnb to work out a long term lease . 
  * badehotellet is the story about the guests and staff at a beach hotel by the north sea sand dunes . 
  at the heart of the story is the lives of three young people , the chambermaid fie , the merchant 's daughter amanda , and the local fisherman morten . 
  their fates are intertwined , and their stories are about emancipating themselves from the plans other people have made on their behalf , the attempts on social ascent , and about losing and finding oneself on the way . 
  the series is inspired by the way of life at the many seaside hotels of the past , and reflects our own time with its mixture of financial crisis , denial , and dreams of happiness .
