  wow it 's been going for 8 season ?!, 
  i stopped watching at the end of season 4 and tbh i think they should have wrapped the story up there or maybe given it 1 more season to tie up any loose ends . 
  the most recent season was definitely the worst of them all . 
  i 'm both happy and sad that it will be finished after this season , i just get the feeling that the writers are either all out of ideas or are just sick of the characters . 
  yeah what happened to this show ?!, 
  i love the first 2/3 seasons but everything after that seemed so pretentious and aimed at that stereotypical `` hipster la audience '' . 
  maybe i 'm just too old ... 
  that being said , the titties are nice ( and basically the only reason to watch the show ) . 
  thanks for your website , i used it non stop when i was building my pc .

  this is what happens when you do n't adapt to new types of media and content distribution models . 
  no great loss really , the state of australian free to air tv is absolutely abysmal . 
  i honestly have n't watched tv here for at least 2-3 years . 
  their alphabet is obviously cyclical , not linear . 
  they used apple maps for directions .

  ascii horse cock and cp ? 
  it 's about time they did this , but from past experiences those who perpetrated these crimes will no doubt get a slap on the wrist . 
  the day a banker goes to jail will be a very cold day in hell ...

  holy crap my blood pressure went up 20 points just reading that .

  i saw bob dylan in 2007 and , my god was he awful . 
  we paid $ 150 each for the concert , which was basically a plain stage with him and his piano and his band . 
  he sung maybe 2-3 of his older tracks and the rest were newer songs that he 'd released that year ( might have been [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modern_times_\\ ( bob_dylan_album \\ ) ) album ) . 
  he did n't interact with the crowd at all and his singing voice sounded like a turkey had swallowed a frog and was now suffocating to death . 
  and while i recognize that he was never really known to have a great singing voice , this was just shameful . 
  would cringe again . 
  i have the words `` purple monkey dishwasher '' at the end of my email signature . 
  it 's been like that for a year and a half now and the only person to notice it was one of our printer repair contractors . 
  we had a good laugh about it when he mentioned it to me one day because i had completely forgotten i had put it there . 
  it 's worse than the brolocaust . 
  same deal for me , i 've noticed all my filters have abruptly stopped working and my front page is filled with unfunny memes . 
  i 've cleared all my browsing history and temp files but still no dice .

  i 'm not an american , but i 've seen mentioned in this thread that you need 5 % of the vote .

  do libertarian candidates get a seat in the house/congress ? 
  serious questions as i 'm interested in learning about the way your system works .
