  space parachutes, 
  post confirmed for marketing content . 
  cash money, 
  interesting ... never heard this before , what makes you say that ? 
  genuinely curious, 
  i was aware of pnac , but never knew about ` clean break ' . 
  very interesting , thanks for the links . 
  this is n't cringe-y at all , it 's just plain hilarious . 
  cheers bud, 
  ask questions never . 
  keep your mouth shut citizen . 
  us military propaganda, 
  how is this cringe ? 
  it 's more impressive than anything ... 
  this most certainly sucks , but i 'm not sympathetic because the australian public voted this government in . 
  you get the government you deserve . 
  look at the username of op . 
  wow that was some good cringe , i was so close to shutting my browser window . 
  / r/funny is that way -- , 
  it 's always a pleasant surprise when a new species is discovered , this even more so due to its size !, 
  quite amazing that it has gone unnoticed for so long . 
  / r/funny is that way -- , 
  no , that 's why it belongs there . 
  us military propaganda, 
  us military propaganda, 
  who would win in an arm wrestle : ricky bobby or ron burgundy ? 
  very interesting , where can i read more about this ` america still part of the commonwealth ' ? 
  never heard of that before ... 
   `` truth team '', 
  / r/shitposting is that way -- , 
  we love you trump !, 
  let 's do it together then . 
  feel that is . 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ meant ^ ^ ^ fap . 
  government ... terrorists ... same thing really . 
  in conjunction with uber ? 
  holy shit the future actually seems not so bad anymore . 
  cool , another reason for me not to visit the us . 
  they do have a shitload of sun there year round so it 's about time really . 
  what case are you using ? 
  thanks !, 
  it 's really nice , 
  so what company should i be investing in then ? 
  the e-cigarette market is going to explode after this . 
  and yet i still fapped . 
  thanks for the tip , it 's helped greatly on my laptop running an intel core i7-3630qm ( 2.40 ghz ) . 
  now getting a steady 30fps on high res rather than 15-20fps on low/ultra low . 
  edit :, 
  after playing for a while on these settings i now notice my fps is between 30-45fps on high res when i 'm out questing and fighting . 
  finally i can play normally :d, 
  because they 're both scripted ? 
  damn that 's some solid knowledge right there . 
  fucken 5 star post . 
  yes, 
  sauce on this ? 
  scum rises to the top . 
  well since reddit has been compromised , where can we go now ? 
  do we just stay in this sub ? 
  you posted in the wrong sub , this should go in / r/fuckingradideas, 
  mayonnaise is the same color as male ejaculate - confirmed trigger . 
  therefore mayonnaise is the condiment of the patriarchy you shitlord . 
  please do n't give them anymore ideas :(, 
  could you pm me some links about this also ? 
  thanks !, 
  you could start with your wallet . 
  but i guess that would be attempted murder since one person could n't bring down a multinational corporation . 
  but if many people worked cooperatively ... 
  wow that is criminal . 
  stop buying nestl\u00e9 products , hit them where it hurts . 
  you 're not wrong , but we have to start somewhere . 
  every little bit helps , no harm in spreading the word . 
  so how is that public meshnet coming along ? 
  stop buying nestl\u00e9 products . 
  hit them where it hurts . 
   what was it the world bank lady said about 7 being a magical number ? 
  lots of 7 's . 
  shit you 're not wrong ... 
  ** 17 ** july ( ** 7th ** month ) ( 2 +0 +1 +4 = ** 7 ** ), 
  am i just overly paranoid ? 
  they talked about this on the no agenda show but i just thought it was bs ... 
  guess they were onto something . 
  well fuck me ... 
  this is getting stranger and stranger . 
  i must admit that i 'm a little skeptical on this one , though i do hope it 's true . 
  one part of me hopes that more and more people in positions like this start whistle-blowing , however i do get a feeling that this could be government disinfo . 
  i 'll keep following this and evaluate it over time depending on how/what the leaks are . 
  can you recommend any good links to read more about it ? 
  thanks mate , great links . 
  we are already in world war 3 , it 's just being marketed differently . 
  as another poster said : it 's now under the guise of `` peace keeping '' or `` bringing democracy to the region '' . 
  read between the lines and you 'll see it 's business as usual for the elites . 
  yup the sled dogs do shit and pee on the run during a trip . 
  they are far enough ahead of the sled ( and you far enough behind the back dogs ) that you usually do n't get hit by anything . 
  * usually ... *, 
  [ source : i was a musher for a year in norway . 
  ] ( http://joshpersello.wordpress.com/ ), 
  that thread is rife with astroturfing . 
  once you recognise it , it 's hard to ignore because it 's all over reddit . 
  these propaganda agencies are so good at swaying public opinion whenever someone is even remotely critical of the us that it 's sickening . 
  holy fuck ...
