  this is n't a rage comic , it 's a rape comic . 
  [ ] ( / creepy ), 
  i want to fuck that hole . 
  what the what !, 
  thanks for the til !, 
  big fucking surprise . 
  smart move , this could be a great way to not only get around these unjust laws but also prove how fucking ridiculous religion is . 
  win-win in my books !, 
  he 's thuper therial guys !, 
  it 's self defense , pure and simple . 
  i 've been bullied in the past and i 'm glad ( not sure if that 's the right word to use in this instance ) that they got what was coming to them . 
  i feel no sympathy for that family of the dead kid . 
  ah balls , i better go find out who is cutting onions in my office ... 
   3 generations of serial killers . 
  ftfy, 
  ... and that 's why you do n't do pcp . 
  fucking religion has helped no one . 
  shopped , pixels , etc. 
  you know the drill . 
  `` lol nice country '', 
  - the rest of the world, 
  well done , great design !, 
  i both love and hate you . 
  i want that job !, 
  because that worked before amirite ? 
  this guy is a fucking dumb ass . 
  so let me get this straight : a guy who ( supposedly ) has never had sex * and * must be celibate for life * and * will never have children is saying that 2 gay people getting married are a threat to the future ?!? 
  at least they are able to have children and raise them !, 
  motherfucker , they are providing a future family unit for the betterment and survival of humanity !, 
  well lesbians can go to a sperm bank and conceive , and they are able to adopt . 
  gay males can also adopt and donate sperm so that someone else may have a child . 
  so either way you look at it they are able to progress the human race better than someone who does n't have sex/won ' t have children because it 's against the wishes of a mythical bronze-age sky being . 
  bail on that shit as fast as possible !, 
  also try to include a witty one-liner as your final words to her . 
  i had shivers watching this video , let 's hope this becomes main stream !, 
  [ what i looked like when opening that image . 
  ouch, 
  this one probably is n't as interesting as some of the others , but here goes :, 
  i was in the last year of schooling and we were having one of those massive school-wide assemblies where everyone from grades 1-12 show up and they have big school announcements etc. 
  anyway , there was a fundraiser coming up ( i think it was a sausage sizzle ) and to inform everyone of it , some people in the grade 10 drama class were told to do a little skit about it and discuss how much the sausages are , where it is and so forth . 
  if memory serves me right it was 2 girls and 2 guys sitting around a table talking about the fundraiser ( i do n't recall the exact jist of it ) . 
  so the 2 girls are chatting and performing their lines , then it 's the first guys turn to say his line and that goes on without a hitch . 
  but the first word out of the second guys mouth was a [ teste blowout . 
  ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=teste%20blowout ), 
  needless to say the entire assembly of about 500 people , from grades 1-12 ( and some of the teachers ) erupted in laughter and i do n't think they ever managed to finish the little skit . 
  being a guy i know how embarrassing it is to have your voice crack halfway through speaking , i can only imagine how bad he felt in front of the entire school . 
  after that event , i do n't ever recall seeing him at school again ( although i did graduate shortly after that , so i do n't know whatever happened to him ) . 
  mother of god ... 
  fuck this cunt , who says that even in jest ?!, 
  i honestly ca n't believe what i 'm seeing here . 
  yep , sounds like the cia i know . 
  move along , no surprises here . 
  brb changing pants . 
  i , uh , made a mess ... 
  wtf !, 
  he 's never been to the us nor did n't store any data in the us ?!, 
  how can they claim us jurisdiction ? 
  fuck you , america . 
  fuck you monsanto, 
  no one ( i know ) in australia gives a fuck about religion , and if they do they are made fun of . 
  but it 's always hilarious to see these posts about all the crazy fundies int he us . 
  it makes me happy to be where i am !, 
  has this video been passed to the local police ? 
  have the police been informed ? 
  lol religion, 
  fucking seriously ? 
  get over this shitty belief system and start treating everyone fairly . 
  it 's not that hard . 
  this makes my blood boil . 
  do it !, 
  very well put , thank you . 
  this is disgusting , fucking bigoted yanks . 
  this is making my blood boil . 
  i 'm glad this video exists , spread it far and wide !, 
  ** fuck you mpaa , fuck you right to hell **, 
  sorry i had to get that out of my system . 
  i 'm sure we were all thinking it . 
  they wo n't win .
