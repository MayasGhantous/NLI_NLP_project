  i would say : `` do n't worry about things , it 'll only lead to anxiety and panic attacks . 
  stay happy and roll with the punches . '',

  american just keeps getting more and more absurd . 
  time to get the popcorn . 
  as a fellow aussie wd player this video made me rage as much as i do when i play the game . 
  i 've had to give up on progressing anywhere in inferno because 90 % of the time i get insta-fucked by 1 shot abilities , despite being at least 2-3 yards from the object causing the damage . 
  most days my pings bounces between 250-800ms , makes me cry on the inside . 
  no hardcore toons for me =\\, 
  i 'm an australian ent and would love to visit this great state of yours . 
  would it be hard for me to acquire some mmj ( or get a mmj card ) and partake in some of this natural beauty ? 
  ( if this is the wrong place to ask this , please ignore my question ! ), 
  i watch videos like this and wonder why people in the back do n't just yell :, 
  ** `` answer the fucking question for fucks sake !, 
  it 's goddamn frustrating !, 
  watching that stupidity that these people in power spew out is frankly scary . 
  there are people 's lives at risk here !, 
  this is n't something we should take lightly . 
  brb ditching australia for co, 
  holy shit , best description ever . 
  got ta try this, 
  older than the internet , stop reposting this . 
  i am not surprised in the slightest . 
  i live in australia and can get onto bud pretty much whenever we want . 
  prohibition , what prohibition ? 
  oh man america , this is too funny . 
  time to get the popcorn !, 
  what a small minded cunt . 
  * it * should n't be allowed on tv . 
  first it was bath salts , then acid , and now marijuana ? 
  who are they fooling , seriously ? 
  this is definitely misinformation at it 's finest . 
  sounds like an election year promise . 
  is this an american thing ? 
  does it happen a lot over there ? 
  ( serious questions ), 
  i 've never come across this in australia at all ... 
  good to know this was covered up when there is a strain of tb that is resistant to pretty much every drug known to man . 
  smart move rick scott . 
  [ linky ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/extensively_drug-resistant_tuberculosis ), 
  is this a fucking scam ? 
  cash only ... the fuck ? 
  we all know that feel bro . 
  i 've been there more times than i 'd like to admit . 
  this is truly what the internet was made for . 
  this is probably a downvote magnet due to the content ( mentally challenged people ) ; but the music in this short clip makes me crack up every time i see it :, 
  [ travis the moonstar ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oz8-ethe9ai ), 
  [ ca n't go wrong with the intro to this video . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgsombvhu50 ), 
  good to see you are feeling/looking better . 
  i had to use accutane as well just as i was finishing school and it sure as hell cleared everything up for me . 
  side effects were kinda brutal - dry/cracked lips & flaky skin . 
  and nothing of value was lost . 
  keep it up poland !, 
  you know what / r/atheism needs more of ? 
  reposts . 
  would this not create jobs that america needs ? 
  i do n't see a downside to this . 
  10/10 would hack again, 
  lol america , this election is a farce, 
  well done mate . 
  what latency were you playing with ? 
  i doubt i could do this in australia :(, 
  wow nice , i can only dream of latency like that !, 
  i love the onion articles . 
  the only wtf here is wtf were you thinking posting this to wtf . 
  soldiers are n't heroes , they are just paid serial killers . 
  no surprises here , these dispensaries was taking too large a cut from the cia business model . 
  [ linky ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cia_drug_trafficking ), 
  thanks for your advice . 
  you bring up some great points and i 'll take this into consideration . 
  i 've already brought up that option ( regarding work in another state ) , but she was n't too keen on that either . 
  i tend to agree , it would be best to see out her degree and work experience so that we have a more stable platform to then leave on . 
  thanks for your advice . 
  thanks for the advice , i feel as though i am in agreement with many of your points . 
  i think it would be best for both of us if i stayed with her for the next 1-2 years before moving off shore . 
  hi from australia !, 
  just writing to say that i 've been a fan since day 1 of twit . 
  keep up the great work !, 
  my question today is :, 
  who would win in an arm wrestle ... you or dvorak ?
