  americans are immigrants . 
  how the fuck do you start growing hair on your forehead ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  you ca n't really tell from the picture . 
  there should be a flair for ** good content ** and ** bad content ** to put on your post so people know not to click on it even if it 's compelling . 
  e : see mods ? 
  i * am * a good choice for moderator . 
  then she asks for the manager after the haircut , coming full circle . 
  they 're the world trade centers though , and you could n't even see the windows that well in person . 
  i mean , probably . 
  worst part about needing to be formally dressed all the time , your underwear must be in your asshole . 
  ah , sorry for the confusion . 
  am i crazy or does that say `` renk '' ? 
  '' do n't go outside , 'cause you do n't wan na die '', 
  i was trying so hard , moving my head , and screen , squinting and i just could n't see anything but an `` e '' lmao . 
  yeah , people always complain about social anxiety but i 've found it freeing to just not be afraid of people . 
  i know that 's not a solution but it 's strange to think that people are afraid of public interaction . 
  or maybe they 're not american . 
  his case of child molestation was dismissed , same as hillary 's emails . 
  yeah , that seems a bit strange seeing as how there 's no disadvantage . 
  it looked like leather or latex , that 's what he meant . 
  i know , that 's why i said `` i know it 's not a solution '' , i meant that i know this is my situation , it 's just a strange concept to me . 
  well , because of the free weekend . 
  why ? 
  yup , one time my friend and i literally knew the entire enemy team when only 2 of them were spotted . 
  it 's just her new skin . 
  stream quality . 
  interesting . 
  [ my friend does n't use reddit so i always inform him when news like this drops . 
  i 'd like to add ; what 's wrong with the cod dances ? 
  that hurts me on an emotional level , do n't even mention it . 
  like the countries ? 
  imagine if getting the sp before y2 was announced gives you the y2 sp as well ? 
  yeah , wan na make some bets ? 
  i 'm thinking italy , maybe china and a scandinavian country are pretty likely . 
  yeah , i probably wo n't get it before the first dlc is announced , unless it 's cheaper to get it before , just because i 'm afraid they 're gon na milk it a bit too much . 
  when would the first season come out ? 
  thanks . 
  i seem to be missing the joke , care to explain ? 
  `` there 's an outdated meme on my screen , literally unplayable . '', 
  they look cool but an issue would be that you can see through the middle which would greatly change how the game is played . 
  it could work for a different mode but i think replacing the existing ones with these would be bad for gameplay . 
  how ? 
  at least thermite should destroy steel bars . 
  might be too op though . 
  pretty basic stuff lol . 
  not necessarily gameplay-wise , for example being able to look through a barricaded door , and destroying the roof just anywhere , without being able to reinforce . 
  sure it looks nice but it would play far differently from this . 
  do n't think it 's gon na be that big of a deal , and if it 's an issue , i 'm sure ubi will do something about it . 
  idk how much cod has ever flaunted the `` realism card '' , and they certainly are n't now , making it fine for me , it 's just harmless , cosmetic , fun . 
  yeah , it 's all psychological until you form a dependency . 
  yup , kids react , teens react , youtubers react and possibly adults react . 
  yeah and there 's 75 + lawsuits against trump . 
  high profile people like this are in constant legal cases . 
  sorry , there 's so many stupid comments that i do n't even know when it 's a joke or not . 
  i looked into a bunch of reviews and everywhere i checked it said that it was good so i got it . 
  i thought we were past this as a society . 
  it does n't even look like it says definitely if you read through it . 
  this might be the strangest comment i 've seen get downvoted . 
  it 's concise , you answered his question and were nice about it . 
  who the hell downvoted you for that ? 
  lmao , i did n't even know this song but you spelt it out so well that when i tried singing it out loud i instantly got the melody correct . 
  i just went through your history and upvoted 23 comments to make up for your lost karma 'cause i felt bad lol . 
  well , sure but i meant that americans came when it was already inhabited by natives . 
  it always annoys me when i see a non-aggressive , non-offensive comment trying to be helpful get downvoted . 
  you have the other one ? 
  wish i had the money for it :(, 
  same with me , from canada and live in norway so all my friends say it 's my `` canadian genes '' but i think it 's just 'cause i 'm fat . 
  as a regular on / r/enoughtrumpspam , i know that feeling . 
  yeah , that always annoyed me since it was n't like that in bo1 and 2 . 
  if the logo was on screen you were getting the kill . 
  yes but they were the first people in the americas , meaning that it 's their land , and the europeans that came later were immigrants . 
  youtube comments are so painfully non-self-aware that it 's a bit terrifying . 
  exactly , the camrs is absolute garbage without a sight because the irons block your entire field of view . 
  maybe the claymore and impact nade but yeah , let the weapons be . 
  yeah , th really needs an overhaul for y2 , it 's such a pain to play on solo and there 's no way to decide how you want to play . 
  actually not castle lol . 
  no , in the demo you could see through the barricades , destroy and walls and any floor , meaning that there 's no way you 're gon na win on defence . 
  yeah , as well as the gameplay shown in this trailer favouring attackers a massive amount . 
  i was n't trying to bring up politics , i was simply bringing up the way automod works on that sub . 
  i was trying to flank him through the basement , he 's right next to the stairs so i 'd have a great angle on him if he thought i was still by the ladder . 
  this was from back before the operators were in the game so it 's just the attacker . 
  yup , i have over 1500 hours in the game but have n't even played since right after the stunts update came out . 
  it 's a great game and they did well but shame on them for making everything so expensive in online . 
  [ for reference . 
  what post ? 
  should have cut it right before i died with the `` to be continued '' thing . 
  i assume that 's the baby deer narrating ? 
  i mean , we literally saw it 's whole life story so i 'm not really that confused . 
  to clarify , just in case , it 's not actually being played with the atari controller , i 'm just making fun of his aim . 
  what do you mean ? 
  no , sorry for the confusion , i was making fun of the guys aim . 
  bought it on pc a while ago and as fun as it was back in the day there 's just a bit too many things that date it . 
  ( strange weapon handling , no ~ ~ crouching ~ ~ prone , * lots * of hackers ), 
  it makes me sad when people bash muslims they do n't know . 
  i know a bunch of muslims and syrian refugees and they 're nice people . 
  that album is just concentrating my initial frustration with my post . 
  yeah , i do n't really know how much it has to do with my weight , i think i 'm just naturally warmer than a lot of my friends , regardless of where i 'm from . 
  ah , sorry , i did n't mean it literally , i was just making fun of the guy 's aim in the gif . 
  yeah , what even are the differences between doc and rook ?
