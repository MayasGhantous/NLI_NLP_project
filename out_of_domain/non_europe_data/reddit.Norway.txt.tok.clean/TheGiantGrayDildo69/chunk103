  doc 's medic patch ? 
  what about a camera zooming around between different people 's perspective showing each kill of the game/last round in slow mo ? 
  then speed through all the time there 's no kills ? 
  this exactly , if the end screens are too awful for you to play the game just close your eyes or something , jeez . 
  i agree , even though i 'll get downvoted for it along with you , it 's just harmless , cosmetic , fun . 
  if cosmetics are enough for you to not wan na play the game maybe you should stick to 2007 ww2 shooters . 
  well , there is some realism to thermite 's dance , because you can use certain chemicals to burn in your hands without hurting you , also thermite likely has fireproof clothing . 
  yeah , what do the preferences even do ? 
  i feel like i get bomb maybe 1 in 15 games , yet the maps that i 've turned off are just as common as anything . 
  what about bomb ? 
  i feel like bomb is less than 10 % of the games i play . 
  no but when droning in the beginning i might not tag him , and wo n't know if it 's rook or doc . 
  a bit off topic but do you think he 'll be remembered ? 
  he 's the only president i 've ever really known so i do n't know what it 's like after a few years of them being out of office . 
  you have to defend his actions without pointing to hillary , non-supporters can criticize trump and pence because they 're running the country . 
  ok , so instead of `` but hillary '' , the new defence is `` shut up '' . 
  jesus christ , do n't you see that you 're making our argument here ? 
  instead of actually telling us why he 's a good candidate you 're just calling anyone who disagrees with you a crybaby . 
   ( also just for the record , your heros at the_d also disable downvotes to non-subs . 
  but i would n't expect you to understand looking at things equally . ), 
  this was the funniest thing about his comment to me , like do you not even understand how subreddits that get lots of brigades work ? 
  basically any sub that has any sort of high profile nature will disable voting for non subscribers . 
  oh cool , i did n't even see the deathstar at first . 
  ah , thanks , i did n't know . 
  why ? 
  i hit things just fine . 
  i 'm gold 2 level 94 and this is how i 've played since i got the game , it 's fine . 
  it did look pretty cool , that 's one of the main reasons i saved the clip ; spooky tacticalness lmao . 
  not really , just this guy 's awful aim . 
  i did n't expect to find anyone there so i did n't have a chance to react . 
  oh , thanks . 
  yeah sorry , did n't realize that people might misunderstand . 
  on my ps4 right now , so no . 
  i was trying to flank the guy so i was n't being cautious, 
  it was the very beginning of the round so i did n't think they 'd be there already, 
  i could n't hear them since they were crouching . 
  why ? 
  exactly why i ran . 
  i was n't aiming , i was suppressing him to keep him back so my friend could cover that angle while i flanked him . 
  the thing is , i was n't trying to hit him , i was trying to suppress him , since i knew i could n't kill him with the shotgun at that range . 
  ah cool , i love obama for the record , i just do n't know how these things work . 
  i 'm sure trump will be remembered too btw , sadly my intuition says it wo n't be for good reasons . 
  yeah , i think the second shot hit him but yeah , i probably should have aimed . 
  concert hall ? 
  it was a joke about europe lol, 
  i was n't trying to kill the guy in the beginning . 
  just do n't be dumb and it 's usually fine . 
  `` huh , is that someone walking ? 
  better walk over to this door and lock on to their head . '', 
  yeah , idk if they can patch it in or if it 'll need to wait for the next game but the th ai needs to be improved .

  it 'd be a better attack ability to be honest but we already have capit\u0101o . 
  am canadian , can confirm . 
  also i 'm pretty sure ~ ~ basketball ~ ~ ( baseball , i 'm dumb ) is a canadian invention as well . 
  it comes across a lot more fumbly in recording . 
  i play at 63 and 83 . 
  ( vertical and horizontal , respectively ), 
  ca n't tell where you 're coming from here . 
  yeah , i 'm thinking it 'd probably be better if i lowered it but i do n't have tons of time to get used to a lower sensitivity if i wan na hit platinum before the update . 
  i 'll try it out though , maybe before and definitely after 5.0 . 
  sorry for telling the truth , if i was trying to hit him do n't you think i 'd be aiming down sight ? 
  i had a shotgun that 's not gon na do much at that range against an assault rifle so i tried to get behind him . 
  true , it 's very strong but i agree it 's a bit fumbly if your aim is off . 
  it does n't matter with shotguns in this game , it 'll shoot immediately even if you 're mid-reload . 
  yeah , but also a few things like hearing you through walls seems to be a matter of `` is he standing or not '' and disregards factors like what 's the armor of the operator , how far away are they and how fast are they moving . 
  as well as never missing shots through walls which is just plain annoying . 
  i really hope you went to sleep after posting this comment and are about to wake up in an hour or 2 . 
  lmao , i thought of doing that immediately after posting the gif . 
  i 'll do it and report back in a few hours . 
  yeah lol , i thought people would get the joke but it soon became clear that his aim was so bad that people actually thought he was playing on a 30 year old controller lmao . 
  was gon na add this as a comment when i initially posted this but forgot until now lol . 
  [ anyways here 's my reaction to the attempt . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zwuu8wa5r0&amp;ab_channel=ghost115 ), 
  downgeralto for implying that pc is n't ** literally ** god . 
  what is drugs ? 
  yeah , did n't know if it counted since 2 of the people died because of welcome mats . 
  i think i need to make a novelty account called something like `` ureallyneedanapostrophethere ? '', 
  just to passive aggressively tell people that they 're bad at life . 
  huh , i thought it was the other way around and people were confused since it was different in the previous one . 
  yeah lol , it also has a question mark . 
  yeah lmao , after i gave up on the stereotypical gaming channel i just started making random videos like that . 
  the person who owns the account probably either turned up their sensitivity too much , or let someone inexperienced play . 
  what else do you use ? 
  i avoid the iron sights so i have a bit of room to see under where the shot 's gon na go . 
  i have all 3 on but basically never get bomb , which would 've been fine when i first started playing but i 've really come to love bomb . 
  yeah , i 'm just wondering if the ai can be improved much through updates or if th is doomed to always have wonky ai in this game . 
  i think you mean `` she ai n't messing with no broke ^ ^ ^ broke ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ broke . '', 
  yeah , it does n't matter how for or against trump you are , if you break their echo chamber even for a second you 're banned . 
  i have my aim significantly lowered which definitely helps me a lot . 
  \\  \\  \\  meme \\  arrows \\  \\  \\  how \\  do \\  they \\  work ?!, 
  true ;(, 
  there seems to be evidence that the primaries were rigged in hillary 's favor , as well as his supporters being far more enthusiastic than clinton supporters , meaning he could have gotten higher turnout . 
  what if i live in a country that does n't have apple stores ? 
  thanks lol , i panicked a bit when they grabbed the hostage . 
  yeah , the reflex is definitely better , idk why i have it in this clip but i do n't use red dot anymore . 
  here 's yesterdays post for comparison , or if you missed it : https://www.reddit.com/r/rainbow6/comments/5cw7o1/running_from_a_gunfight_isnt_always_the_answer/, 
  thanks for this , i did n't expect so many people to think i was actually trying to kill that guy in the beginning . 
  did n't have time to finish it last night but i got around to it just now , [ here .
