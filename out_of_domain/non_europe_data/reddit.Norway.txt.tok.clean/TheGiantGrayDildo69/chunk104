  depends on the mode and the entrances to the objective . 
  also if the enemies are using blackbeard , blitz or montagne a lot . 
  redd.it links do n't often work on mobile . 
  psalmbody once told me, 
  yeah lmao , i thought 40 seemed like a conservative estimate . 
  fine lol, 
  i trust my teammate , to always have my kneecap . 
  he tweeted about it a bunch on his verified twitter, 
  go back , this sub is n't representative of reddit at all so either do n't sub here , or only sub here . 
  what an unnecessary thing to lie about . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's a reference to the r6 hunger games posts where frost would cry herself to sleep and wake up screaming nearly every night . 
  not sure sorry, 
  what 's this from ? 
  two words ; sarah palin, 
  being one or the other is kind of a thing in the gay community . 
  alien blue here , that 's probably why . 
  it 's annoying on desktop as well though . 
  ah thanks , idk why but i always imagined it from monty python . 
  oh shit , did n't expect you to show up , loved the video !, 
  excited to see how your channel goes . 
  i mean , hitler * did n't * win the election but i agree with your point . 
  pretty basic compared to the nade-trade, 
  thanks for the / s , i thought op had faked the gif there for a second . 
  a bit op though seeing as how you could theoretically cover yourself from 2 cluster charges . 
  sweet , are you doing all the editing and everything yourself or do you have help ? 
  same with me , we had a 3-0 lead and i was at 9 kills when everyone disconnected . 
  haha , nice , good job , i was gon na offer my help but i do n't think my username would do me many favorites in the `` people to trust '' department . 
  i 'd rather have something new rather than a 3rd spin on the same op . 
  what 's your problem ? 
  he just misunderstood . 
  yeah , having 4 ops needing to use 2 grenades each is a pretty secure way to keep them out . 
  how do you do that ? 
  e : holy shit please work , the only reason i do n't play th is 30fps , thanks for the tip . 
  e2 : thank you so much dude !, 
  now i can finally play th without my soul being destroyed by 30fps . 
  yeah , sorry , hate to be that guy online that has a problem and just adds `` nevermind , fixed it . '', 
  getting around 70-85 fps on the 4 maps i 've played so far , looks good !, 
  honestly would n't be against this . 
  but the objective is to get into the room , no ? 
  this seems to be a guide on how to safely clear and breach a room , not how to avoid roamers . 
  sorry , i did n't realize i was so wrong lol , i will pick barbed wire in the future when playing with friends . 
  was he joking ? 
  my bad if he was . 
  i thought i was the only one terrified after not looking at the sub , and having seen that gif yesterday . 
  do you always go straight into the objective room from spawn ? 
   i 'd show myself out, 
  haha , what a strange typo . 
  but if it was after your death should n't you have lost ? 
  i appreciate the gif and all , but can we as a society all decide to never host gifs on redd.it ? 
  it 's just awful . 
  kinda just came up with it on the spot because i did n't wan na call it a `` throw-back '' , glad people liked it lol . 
  this might hat do n't work with imagus are n't worth looking at . 
  yeah , honestly consoles get a bad rep for the fps , i 've been playing rainbow 6 at 75-90 fps all day on ps4 and this game is beautiful , and has great dynamic destruction . 
  yeah , planes are generally easy since they usually do n't have very round edges making them look polygon-ey . 
  yeah , this irks me a bit , at least leave the legs and elbow-down alone , it seemed like they meant spraying the torso and hitting shoulders for less damage but they nerfed all the limbs . 
  got 3 headshots in a single game of casual yesterday , not the worst thing to do in a week . 
  would have been advertised as part of the new season . 
  me three , wondering if i need to get up early for it . 
  yeah , 2 shots to the torso ( or now arms or legs ) at close range is super op . 
  thanks . 
  i 'm sad that it 's so late on the one day i have off . 
  uhh , sure he is !, 
  just got battlefield and have been playing the campaign for the last few hours , and it 's honestly so much better than i thought , i care about each character , and their story , the gameplay and graphics are nice , and the overall story and atmosphere is great . 
  super excited for some more rainbow tomorrow though !, 
  ah , i really liked the pilot guy , the ending to that sequence is pretty great . 
  so that 's it , huh ? 
  we some kinda suiciiide skwaaaaaad ?!? 
  is that generally regarded as a bad movie ? 
  i liked it a lot back when i used to watch it a bunch . 
  me too , on the one fucking day i have off too , wtf . 
  why not have it in the middle of the night so people do n't lose playtime over it ? 
  yup , it 's really just british and european before you start hitting asia . 
  not sure if you mean in terms of game releases or overall ... 
  i know your struggle bud , literally had fibre internet installed yesterday . 
  fuck , ~ 10gb after 4 hours of maintenance ;(, 
  lol yeah , is n't 250 renown about equal to half a game ? 
  seems like a waste of time but i guess it 'll keep people happy . 
  true , i guess i did n't think of it like that , i did n't take the day off , for the record , i was just lucky . 
  yeah , it 's been a long and annoying ride with tons of delays but it 's pretty great . 
  hope you get it sorted soon !, 
  skull rain was around 9gb iirc so i 'd expect about the same . 
  yeah , mine was supposed to be 5 but was more around 1-2 , now it 's supposed to be 80 , do n't know what it actually is , but it 's amazing . 
  good luck !, 
  th really needs an overhaul for y2 , better compatibility offline , and solo , some better ways to chose what kind of , and how many enemies you want . 
  huh , i never noticed the greenscreen , though when you 're younger you 're a bit more forgiving . 
  booo, 
  ** i-g-g-y ** put mah name in ** bold ** . 
  in norway we have cat food called [ `` pussi '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/577dnvz.jpg ) , and even better , when i was searching for that picture i found a link on google titled `` buy pussi online '' . 
  does it still say 2 hours for anyone else ? 
  i 'm getting a bit scared . 
  really ? 
  i ca n't connect right now on ps4 . 
  e : 9 mins now but the update needs to happen afterwards so fuck that . 
  oh nice , i was expecting closer to 10 so i 'm super excited i wo n't be spending my evening on the download . 
  really ? 
  where have you heard this ? 
  yeah , restarted and it 's good now , thanks . 
  yeah , thanks . 
  update 57 % prepared . 
  fuck the ps4s downlading method .
