  oh , sorry , i have n't read through it . 
  i 'm a little glad i 'm not on pc right now playing 4k . 
  a little over 5gb . 
  like 5.1 or so . 
  5.1 gb on ps4 . 
  how did you download it this morning ? 
  is this a reference to serenity on this sub or just a meme in the community ? 
  i may be wrong but i actually think it only checks for updates once every 24 hours so unless you have set that time to right now it wo n't download it if it 's in rest mode . 
  the best course of action might just be to have the game open and idle in the menu screen and it should start the download on its own ( probably ) . 
  a bit annoying , they really need to do something about th for y2 . 
  ah , interesting , on ps4 and it did n't start until like 10 mins ago . 
  yeah , i got 80mb/s installed yesterday but my ps4 gets 10-20 , and even at one point yesterday my upload speed hit 500kb , how does that even happen ? 
  when you see my download speed , you definitely will . 
  jk lol , but i did have some awful internet before it got upgraded yesterday , just in time . 
  good morning ? 
  general motors ? 
  genetically modified ? 
  good move ? 
  game master ? 
  general manager ? 
  oh lol , i just googled `` gm acronym '' and pasted everything i found lmao . 
  did anyone else 's ps4 download go down to 2.8 gb ? 
  yeah but i 've noticed it a lot more on this sub than other places and i know serenity says it a lot , that 's why i was asking . 
  does it have 4k textures ? 
  maybe i 'm glad i did n't upgrade yet lmao . 
  a slightly annoying thing with this is that shield ops ca n't point their shield up and the drone needs to be on the ceiling so idk how helpful it 'd be . 
  ah , thanks then . 
  yeah lol , sleep well pupper . 
  probably 5.1 or 5.2 then ... ;(, 
  yup , it 's happened to me at least 5 or 6 times now , after playing for an hour . 
  how does this go unnoticed ? 
  also new icons for jumping and some other drone abilities . 
  some sudden freezes . 
  that gameplay 's from 5.2 , probably not for a month at least . 
  what cunts . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  he looks basically the same . 
  look at 24:35 on this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptmzgvepwmw, 
  i live in norway , on the ps4 , username 's ghostmw2awsome . 
  it happened 1 or 2 more times during the stream as well but i 'm a bit too lazy to look through it for the timecodes right now . 
  because the dlc color is red ... ? 
  probably a hardware issue . 
  i honestly ca n't see anything wrong . 
  i was gon na call you out but you make a fair point . 
  why are you being downvoted ? 
  at least she does n't have a gimp mask anymore . 
  her old look was so bland and weird , i think it 's a good improvement . 
  keep going like this and we 'll run out of salt in the pacific , guys .

  yup , how it usually goes is ** 5v5 ** , one teamkill , ** 5v4 ** , another person tries to kill the original teamkiller and they get killed , ** 5v3 ** , the person gets vote-kicked , ** 5v2 ** and you have n't seen any enemies yet , and you 've lost at least one round now . 
  at this point , i 'm not even mad about the politics , that sub needs to die quickly because of the mass-shitpost hub it is , and the idiotic echo chamber they call comments . 
  lol , that 's good , i guess ... 
  yup , people need to understand that we have n't been snubbed , but rather that the gameplay we saw was from 5.2 so of course there 's gon na be more there . 
  lmao , that show is too hilarious . 
  he sure is a low-blow . 
  the trick when talking about the election is saying `` there 's no way i 'd ever vote for that * monster * ! '', 
  diddly kiddlies . 
  he calls himself a reddit addict but probably does n't even lecture people when they accidentally link / r/me _ irl, 
  when someone says something self-deprecating the first reply will often be / r/me _ irl , as a kind of hashtag , but in the last few months it 's become a bit of a thing to then reply to that person telling them why / r/me _ irl is literally hitler and you should subscribe to / r/meirl instead . 
  it 's so deep at this point it 's worthless trying , the subreddit might have the answer you 're looking for . 
  i remember the first time it was referenced and i spent nearly an hour just clicking to the previous one lmao , and that was almost 3 years ago . 
  true , we do n't want another hate-sub-purge , the last one was just about all we could take . 
  i 'm just disappointed that they got even worse after the election . 
  oh sorry , i think it 's / r/theswitcheroo or something , i 'm on mobile so i ca n't check at the moment . 
  yeah , i 'd be fine with them if i did n't need to wake up to them on / r/all every day with some new annoying title . 
  5 for damaging them and 50 or 100 for killing them on defense . 
  500 for killing them on offense i think . 
  you forgot kapkan , he looks super pissed . 
  add me if you 're on ps4 , if you want any help that is . 
  yeah , going cams after you 're dead and spotting/giving call outs is a great way to help your team . 
  i 've guided someone to victory in a 1v4 and twice in a 1v3 , it 's all about know where the enemies are , if you can relay that info to your teammate they 'll have a much easier time . 
  this happened to me last week too , where i won a game using only a shotgun and i had n't gotten anything . 
  idk why but rockstar are just so good at making the driving look and feel nice . 
  so , what are you thinking now ? 
  are you gonna/have you gotten it ? 
  yeah , i 've been looking into because i thought the first one was decent but there does n't seem to be a standard edition on the ps store , and there also seems to be some performance issues on the console version . 
  yup , republicans are trying to play it off as trump being the first pro-gay president when it was legalized under the obama administration ffs . 
  spent like 10 mins trying to find the right link , thanks lol . 
  i love how trump is somehow the biggest meme in politics , even after bill clinton and bidenbro, 
  scenes ? 
  what ? 
  cum on everybody, 
  when today ? 
  you heard of hell ? 
  well i was sent from it . 
  there 's so much *** beat *** . 
  i 'm mr. nice guy , glass is half full . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  jesus , you 're clearly delusional about what drugs are . 
  i 'm not saying it 's not a drug , i 'm saying you 've clearly been misinformed about the use and abuse of cannabis and other substances . 
  just happened to me playing as hibana on terrorist hunt . 
  edit : just happened again , seems to get triggered by pulling out the launcher weapon ( do n't know the name sorry ), 
  probably sledge , definitely either him or thatcher since those are the only 2 attackers that have shotguns . 
  yeah , the white album cover is pretty ugly , hope he does n't use that for his upcoming album . 
  frost is half chinese i think . 
  except they actually leave the confines of their group ... to brigade ... 
  is n't this how it 's always been ? 
  how the hell does this go unnoticed before launch ?
