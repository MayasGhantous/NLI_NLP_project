  how did it use to be ? 
  idk what it is but that face just makes me angry at that person for some reason . 
  oh , thanks . 
  100 % agree on the terrorist hunt changes , one thing i 'm missing from the list would be a ui overhaul , it 's just awful trying to navigate and it 's so laggy . 
  pistol only ? 
  headshots only ? 
  maybe vip escort ? 
  not too sure . 
  that would be good , first team to kill every operator wins ? 
  could work without splitting the base but it might give the team with more ops an advantage , which would be bad . 
  i just read `` natalie portman '' and clicked , ok nsa ? 
  at his state , 10 years if he 's lucky . 
  my crush from high school was called monica and i 'm pretty sure she hated me because the first time i heard her name i got into a laughing fit because i remembered that picture . 
  should n't all of spetsnaz be counted the same then ? 
  it annoys me a lot when he has these poppy mainstream radio hits because he always needs to have some dumb hook interrupting his great verses . 
  `` they said i sound like az and nas , out came the claws '', 
  hope he does biterphobia and ssep . 
  listen to the ssep , or at least `` low down , dirty '', 
  and if you hear a man that sounds like me , * smack 'em * , then ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from . 
  ** ca n't we just play with teddy ruckspin instead ? 
  `` after i fuck you in the butt , get some head , bust a nut , get some rest . '', 
  yeah but if ash is american since she 's in an american ctu then should n't spetsnaz be counted as one instead of individually ? 
  i agree that there 's cruelty against cows , but one of the arguments i 've heard from the `` not my mom , not my milk '' crowd is that they need to rape the cows since you can only milk them when they have a calf , which is not true . 
  i 'm not mad because trump 's about to be president , i 'm just sad that trump supporters are so fucking stupid . 
  yeah , i think it 's fine the way it is , there just need to be some base-rules on what counts and what does n't . 
  doctor slapped my momma . 
  '' * bitch you got a sick kid . 
  yeah the head looks added on in post , very badly . 
  he lost the election in 1932 with around 30 % of the vote . 
  i try to be , 
  my cousin 's convoy was hit by a suicide bomber in afghanistan a few years ago , nobody died since he detonated early because he was being shot . 
  anyways , my cousin and i were driving around the other day when he saw a middle-eastern looking guy across 3 lanes of traffic , and he just yelled `` contact '' , and swerved across the 3 right lanes of traffic . 
  it 's strange what triggers it . 
  kermit would have worked better . 
  `` maybe if you did n't wan na get publicly shamed , you should n't have attended a pro-gay show as a notoriously anti-gay politician . 
  relevant but you were downvoted because someone did n't get the reference lol . 
  yeah , cod is n't bad , it 's just that it 's gotten boring for people who have played every year . 
  finally a post actually making a point about some funny logic rather than the stupid `` cod sux amirite ? '', 
  that quote made him seem like a bit of an asshole and an ironic death like that is something i 'm fine with . 
  irreversible death ? 
  that 's even worse than normal death . 
  holy shit , nobody linked me_irl before you needed to lecture them and post meirl . 
  we 've come a long way guys !, 
  great movie lmao . 
  except this lmao . 
  actually it 's pronounced ** `` wise '' ** . 
  zombies in bo3 is really good . 
  you 're completely missing my point , i was saying that if you just buy the new cod and that 's the kind of game you like , it 's fine , there 's not much objectively bad about cod , you 're just giving subjective anecdotes . 
  might be annoying i get killed by the person you just shot in the head . 
  watched a vid i made in the beta the other day and man were things different , for example , when you tagged people they were 3d spotted for a short time , fuck that . 
  might be a balance issue , like making kapkans and claymores turquoise would give an advantage to players with that setting on , if they 're not colorblind . 
  just that too few people know about it . 
  if you share preferences with everyone in the game it 'll follow them . 
  we have the best bullet holes , anybody will tell you , our bullet holes are ** yuge ** . 
  you 're just being an idiot . 
  yeah but real life does n't require balance and fun gameplay . 
  you 're completely missing the point of my argument and are trying to tell me that these games are bad without giving me any objective reason . 
  would n't bo3 be better ? 
  i have both but the only thing iw does better is the campaign imo . 
  what 's the significance of 1961 ? 
  oh dear , this sub is pro-trump too ? 
  `` commie = bad '', 
  confirmed american . 
  i need it to auto-capitalize `` i '' , `` i 'm '' , `` i 'll '' and whatnot . 
  i think the most valuable thing i 've learned from watching phil is how to argue with someone respectfully , and taking their side into account . 
  and how to form new opinions based on relevant facts and truth , as well as how much you wan na be trusting the news and media . 
  oh , i did n't realize the guy i was replying to was colorblind , sorry . 
  ah , thanks . 
  that 's what i was referring to , yeah , idk if it actually means outlined , i just meant like when you get compromised . 
  it 's been a tough few weeks without it auto-capitalizing whatnot ;(, 
  savior is more of an achievement than a stat . 
  dying in debt would make you be able to have spent more than you 've made . 
  it 's 1.0 when you have n't died or killed . 
  fuze , uh ... finds a way . 
  a better solution would just be when you aim , so you just tap l2 and it stops , or you can lean while aiming by holding it down . 
  why ? 
  what 's wrong with some additional code for the ps4 version ? 
  there 's surely already tons of differences . 
  it could work but spamming the knife button might not work controls wise . 
  what 's wrong with xb not having it ? 
  it 's the worst when you 're in the middle of reinforcing or grabbing an armor pack and you just hear a c4 land next to you , and you know your teammate 's too dumb to wait for literally 5 seconds . 
  yeah but they 're obviously not gon na be there every time . 
  laughing so hard at this lmao . 
  it 's because they do n't have the utility , they could have hipfire leaning for elite controllers but that 'd just give a huge advantage to people with money for the better controller . 
  that cat was just inhabited by satan . 
  so you 're just wasting time and ammo at the beginning of the round , as well as needing to remember that every time , would n't it be better for ubi to just balance their damn game ? 
  i 'm not crying about it i 'm offering a solution and you 're being a dick . 
  why ? 
  am i the only one that does n't think that he 's saying anything even remotely close to `` reekris '' ? 
  or people who are fine with the frame rate because it 's fine . 
  i 've never dropped below 25 on my ps4 and i have over 50 hours on it . 
  huh , they should just take advantage of the features of each console and let people choose what they want based on the limitations . 
  it 'd breed good competition between xb and ps too because xb would scramble to make up for it on their console . 
  i think it runs at 30 . 
  that 's the funniest thing i 've seen all day lmao . 
  not even when they start extorting you for money ? 
  the idea is that they record a video of you nude or jerking it and threaten to release it to everyone you know if you do n't give them money . 
  sure some people would n't care but i 'm fine having tape on my camera if it means i 'm avoiding that . 
  living in norway and school is free here and you get a monthly stipend of about $ 200 depending on your living situations . 
  where 's the simulation info from ?
