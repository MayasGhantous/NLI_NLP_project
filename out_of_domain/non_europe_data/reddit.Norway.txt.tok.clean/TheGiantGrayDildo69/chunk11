  idk why you 're being downvoted , i lol 'd . 
  hnnggg, 
  oh god , the horror . 
  can confirm , am canadian . 
  it always puts people off when i always say please , thank you and sorry . 
  i wish i had the money or room for a setup like this . 
  so sorry , there was a storm yesterday and we lost our internet , i 'm going out in an hour , pics should * be up in 2 hours . 
  but i bet you know what love is . 
  first comment , -1 votes . 
  your comment saying the exact same thing , +9 votes . 
  i do n't see the logic . 
  he might 've not seen it yet . 
  indeed . 
  greg nicotero said that s3/s4 was 6-7 months . 
  yeah , just read the wiki and it said 514 days since patient zero to coda . 
  oh god , number 3 . 
  ** browsed reddit for 7 hours , like a bowowws **, 
  but if baby is kill , who is obama ? 
  baking . 
  * you slowly grasp the stick and turn it around , the path of the stick is unknown , except to you . 
  the stick inches slowly toward your anus and you insert it . 
  quickly . 
  your buttcheeks clench in pain . 
  the cold hard stick soon warms up . 
  you open back up to ensure more room for the stick . 
   communication skills . 
  you 'd be amazed how far you could probably get in life if you had perfect communication skills . 
  do n't you think that would include languages ? 
  * clever comment that will get me gold . 
  i know that this is n't the point of the sub , but i 'm pretty sure that a 5 year old would n't understand shit of that . 
  it 's probably like me where you just get used to sneaking them out silently or just holding them in , i never fart loudly anymore because i 'm used to not when i 'm in public . 
  i cought onto them pretty quickly , not sure why that was such a spoiler . 
  i 'm glad i did n't get spoiled at all , except for when jin and sun died . 
  possibly / r/nocontext . 
  i might just do that . 
  bob2 had a pretty funny run . 
  i love that spot in police chases !, 
  what happened with jack ? 
  ( i 'm sorry , it 's been a long time . ), 
  the fact that it 's a flash forward . 
  but it 's been a long time since i watched the series , and i do n't know what i 'm talking about . 
  have n't read the comics , but i doubt it 'll be this season , probably last episode and next season . 
  what happened ? 
  you can see that the lighting and angle is different as well . 
  oh god , same kinda thing happened to me the other day . 
  i forgot my shirt at my friends house , and when i came back 3 days later he was wearing it ... 
  i did n't mention it . 
  yeah . 
  oh , thanks . 
  i can totally see that . 
  i do n't know why but i totally knew that entire episode that it was a flash forward . 
  thanks . 
  yeah , i watched it all on netflix last year . 
  trying to remember if it said `` flash forward '' in the episode description . 
  would 've been cooler to have this vertical . 
  i know that , i was talking about [ ] ( / c `` alexandria . '' ), 
  really great song . 
  nice to hear something new from the slim shady days . 
  do n't we * always * assume that op is morbidly obese ? 
  ahhh !!, 
  i hate it . 
  it 's so creepy !, 
  i 'm not afraid of much , but that series is one of the worst things i 've seen . 
  i 'm no expert but i 'm pretty sure that this is made up . 
  ** they eat babies **, 
  i did . 
  messed up . 
  that means everything 's venomous . 
  i 'd upvote you but you have 360 upvotes at the moment , and i just ca n't . 
  edit : sorry , i upvoted you . 
  that 's hilarious . 
  it paralyzes you in the water , so you can still drown . 
  but it 's not the venom that kills you . 
  that 's not a problem . 
  huh . 
  i read that a while ago on wikipedia , i guess i should n't trust all sources on the internet . 
  i assume that 's how it is in the pentagon . 
  but driving ... 
  oh god , all the nopes . 
  not new , but new to me . 
  also that dank ass weed . 
  guys i 'm trying to jerk it . 
  stop making me laugh !, 
  that 's perfect . 
  did n't see that coming . 
  so what you mean to say is `` lol '', 
  well that 's no fohn . 
  i think it 's funny on this sub that people down vote if anyone says anything bad about sourcefed , anyone sourcefed likes or anyone affiliated with sourcefed . 
  i hate that they do n't use blinkers . 
  i was just riding a motorbike , you do n't need to swerve 2 lanes to the right , hit me , then turn left !, 
  i think the joke was that he did n't realize that he could have any car , not that he had short term memory loss . 
  your raps are bad and you should feel bad . 
  if you win you 'll give me 5000 pounds right ? 
  at least you 're not in there with michael myers . 
  it 's not too bad . 
  if you do n't like gore or have a weak stomach , you should n't click on it . 
  i 'm gon na start screaming it then running away . 
  i really got ta take a piss . 
  `` well , if you look at this chart you can see ... '',
