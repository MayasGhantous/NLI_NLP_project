  graphic design is obviously your passion . 
  the only dlc ops worse than him is echo imo , everyone else is a pretty decent pick . 
  i 'm not saying he 's terrible but he 's a super slow peeker , slow to ads , and as soon as you peek , 4 shots from an smg and you 're dead . 
  you 're better off going hibana or buck . 
  fair point , i guess it needs to be a mix of the team your playing against , your individual skill in terms of sneaking around and just getting lucky , her smg is definitely not great for when they know where you are and shotguns are n't really worth it ever since the * incident * . 
  it really depends on your play-style . 
  i would be so insanely pissed if this was my team , but deep down i know it easily could 've been me . 
  what 's with that ? 
  i played from 15:00 to like 19:00 yesterday but when i tried looking at recent players it would n't refresh past like 15:30 . 
  honestly do n't think it 's a great idea to have that on even if it was in the game , most of the time as soon as my team gets matched against a group of people with matching names , at least 1 or 2 people will quit . 
  fair point , this is from someone who queues solo , in which case he is n't great in my experience . 
  he should just act like himself , if that 's him on his twitter then he just seems like a bit of a dick . 
  i 've had it happen a few times recently , it 's not triggered by turning the alarm off though . 
  honestly i would n't be surprised at all if we saw some pro league strats with him now that bb is nerfed and he 's been buffed . 
  i do n't see how a good team would counter him much better . 
  hey , do n't bash dumb , immature names ... 
  cod 4 remastered is fairly easy , it 's campaign only so you do n't have to deal with other people . 
  just got them the other day and i got ta say , 7.1 audio is a whole different world . 
  oh no , i guess there 's nothing to do but buy a car . 
  they should have kept the ending at least , with the mascot falling after they nail it , and all the laughing . 
   ** definition of democracy **, 
   plural : * democracies *, 
   a : government by the people ; especially : rule of the majority, 
  actually , it 's only a democracy if the person who gets the majority vote wins . 
  i guess the question was more about wether or not the color looks pretty because of the value of the metal . 
  love letter assignment ... ? 
  her in the tub is the most attractive image i 've ever seen . 
  just did it with my friend , they float in the air and it 's hilarious as fuck . 
  i literally have no clue why i was banned there , the rule cited when i was banned was `` no low energy or cucks '' , i messaged them asking why , and they just replied `` no cuckoldery '' . 
  fuck that sub . 
  it 's a comedy sketch so there is no finished product . 
  i have no clue other than a guess , i think it would be because of the green grass in the background . 
  yeah , norway here and it 's just upsetting to watch how delusional many americans are . 
  you ca n't seriously be * that * dense ? 
   i personally would feel that trinisha may be slightly less qualified or sane than abigail . 
  that 's literally just textbook racism , i do n't get how you do n't understand that . 
  i do n't get what 's wrong with that logic , only badly worded . 
  well sure , but i think the point the black co-worker was trying to get across was that even if he 's on the same level as someone , it 's still worse to be black in that situation because of racism , biases and racial profiling . 
  financially i mean . 
  yes you can , just hit the downvote button when you post ... 
  no because it starts you out having upvoted your own post , putting it at +1 . 
  removing the upvote puts it at 0 and downvoting it puts it at -1 . 
  god you 're an idiot . 
  it might be on a post , because post scores only go down to 0 . 
  i 'm saying if they 're financially the same ... 
  what the he 'll are you talking about ? 
  there was something posted a few days ago, 
  i understand the mechanics of the game , i 'm simply asking for a link . 
  i 'm on mobile and it did n't show up . 
  ok , apologies , good discussion , i see why i was in the wrong now . 
  i 'm sure you 've gotten every reply imaginable but on the off chance that i 'm original here , another reason might be because videos are uncompressed ( compared to gifs or gfys ) and they contain audio so it can be a drain on mobile data . 
  same , that message is the bane of my existence . 
  that 's not what he said , he said everyone who voted for him is a piece of shit , not that they 're racist .

  enough sources and factual information for you , snowflake ? 
  what german meddling ? 
  what 's wrong about calling the nes a nintendo ? 
  especially before the snes and more recent consoles came out . 
  you get a new one every 24 hours , it does n't reset or have anything to do with when you complete one . 
  true , pence as his vp is a hard one to defend for anyone who 's claiming to be pro-lgbt though . 
  i have literally no clue on the topic , but assuming it ca n't do 20l of vodka , my best guess would be the alcohol or other strong ingredients in vodka that ruin it . 
  the comment you replied to also might have been implying that it 's ruined because your coffee will taste vodka . 
  the cheating is the abuse , emotional abuse is very real and the rape article was simply to show that it 's not a random accusation . 
  fair point , had n't thought about that angle before . 
  fair point , the reason i linked that article about the rape lawsuit was partly because i did n't realize it went past the first paragraph . 
  i also could n't find anything mentioning physical abuse in the time i spent finding the links so that 's why , although iirc his first wife alleged that he beat her . 
  what ever happened to the novelty account that added star destroyers to random pics ? 
  those were always so cool . 
  alright , thanks for looking into it , been pretty busy all day so have n't had time to research too much right now . 
  yeah but unless you 're good at trimming after you finish your session , that 'll fill up your hdd in no time . 
  or else it gets the fuze again . 
  how do you know he 's a nice guy ? 
  jesus , why are people upset about these ? 
  if you do n't like the headgear just do n't buy them ... 
  jesus , why are you so salty about a headgear ? 
  why are people so upset that other people like this ? 
  american ? 
  is there and proof of this ? 
  you just need to get over it and accept trump , just like republicans totally accepted obama in 2008 and 2012 . 
  can you vote from abroad ? 
  i 'm not crying , i was simply showing off what happened . 
  jesus , why are you so triggered , just downvote and move on if you do n't like the post . 
  it 's not like i was confused or anything , it 's a joke , i do n't get why you feel the need to be such a dick about it . 
  mute them ... ? 
  the necklace ... ? 
  that 's the funniest shit wtf . 
  it is an issue or bug , but it 's also making fun of the matchmaking . 
  it was a ranked match and i deranked both times i restarted the matchmaking . 
  actually about 2 mins in i got disconnected . 
  it 's at 30 fps ... ? 
  just shameless self promotion , nobody click on the video . 
  it 's not to do with the game , it 's definitely a ddos , it 's known to happen if you ever join a random party chat . 
  yeah , one of you had high ping . 
  why ? 
  interesting , [ here 's ] ( http://imgur.com/bnnkdal.png ) what it looks like to me . 
  i understand that a lot of your typical `` tumblr sjw man haters '' are liberals that trump supporters like to imagine us as , but man they get triggered like no other whenever you try talking rationally to them .
