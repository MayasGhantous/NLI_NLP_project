  edit : it has happened , he may now be president of the us but he is not my president . 
  anyone who seriously believes that he will win re-election is delusional . 
  luckily he did n't make this post to be one of the main features in one of the biggest video game companies ' biggest game . 
  consoles are usually pretty decent but for this one specific game , if you need to go 7 selections to the right , you ca n't simply hit the right arrow 7 times because of the slow loading , and if you do it too fast , the interface will simply ignore the extra input . 
  same with choosing what recruit nationality you wan na be , say you want to be the sas recruit and the current one selected is spetsnaz , you know spetsnaz is all the way on the right and sas is all the way on the left , you also know that if you have sas selected and you press the left arrow nothing will happen , so basically you 're free to hit the left arrow a ton of times and your selection will stop at sas on its own . 
  the problem is that if you just spam left on the d-pad , the selection will lag out and just choose a seemingly random nationality . 
  i 'm not great at producing a coherent thought or explaining something concisely , so i hope you got through that simply enough . 
  yeah lol , who 's gon na be like , `` oh cool , now i get 100xp for getting an ace , finally a reason to actually do it '', 
  killing every enemy player in a single round . 
  why would he be banned for leaking info ? 
  nowhere in the rules of the game does it say that you 'll get banned from the game for leaking info on a forum . 
  i agree that a throwaway would be far better but still . 
  yeah , same with if ubi ban this guy , he 'll post about it on reddit and we 'll all know . 
  i 'm * very * sceptical , but i 'm excited that we 'll know if this is real in a matter of weeks , so if it is real , we 'll know , and i will be so hyped . 
  but he said in the post that it 's not him leaking the information, 
  he said it 's just something he made up so i guess it does n't matter . 
  i meant for the `` one of the '' prefix to carry over there . 
  *** shivers ***, 
  yeah but the problem is that if you could buy it with r6 credits then ubi would be profiting off of reddit 's trademark . 
  i feel like they sponsor a bunch of podcasts , are they any good ? 
  learned this the hard way in a sensory deprivation tank . 
  sit down . . like on the toilet ? 
  i do n't understand the reference but i do n't like icp so yeah . 
  console players rarely use voice chat . 
  blitz is a fairly common term in english too for a flash of light or something happening with speed and precision , like a lightning strike . 
  does it have 7.1 audio ? 
  i got the hyperx cloud 2 for myself not long ago and i can definitely relate to this clip . 
  or people who play with ... - ** shivers ** - * no sound at all . 
  got a really good pair a few weeks ago , upgrading from the razer kraken pro , and i 'll be the first to say that it makes a massive difference , there 's some issues in the game with sound propogation that will screw me over some times but pretty much 90 % of the time i 'll know where an enemy is walking , running , placing exothermic charge , breach charge , priming c4 , cluster bombs , simply from hearing the audio queues . 
  console or pc ? 
  `` fuck that guy for taking my health , now ** i 'm ** at a disadvantage so he should be dead . '', 
  it 's not good logic , but it 's there . 
  yeah , probably pretty similar to frank and claire in hoc . 
  ah , fair . 
  you 're right , we should be taking our high class humor lessons from t_d instead , they 're so mature and funny . 
  he 's just responding with the same logic the guy before him was using . 
  you would n't classify t_d as a `` political humor '' sub ? 
  it will not , they 're separate for a reason . 
  it 's a known bug and it 's fucking bullshit . 
  restart your game, 
  there was no terrorist attack so it does n't matter . 
  nah dude , have n't you heard from trump supporters ? 
  literally all muslims are terrorists . 
  it 's because much of trump 's appearance is because of choice . 
  to be fair , this may have been before all the votes were counted and it might have looked like obama had less , a lot of people thought the same would happen with trump but after everything was counted he was still below in vote count . 
  i did n't pay attention to the 2012 election mind you , i might be wrong , this is just my guess . 
  same thing happened with hillary , except she just kept getting more votes as the counts kept coming in . 
  good on you for making sure it 's real first , not a lot of that happening recently . 
  it says at the bottom of the credits to anyone who wants to know what software was used . 
  yup , like how he claimed the popularity poll was `` rigged by the same people who rigged the voter polls before the election '', 
  an askreddit thread where a commenter talked about how he was on a date with taylor swift before she got famous , and when things started getting hot and heavy , he realized that she was a bear , a literal bear . 
  yeah , it 's high contrast outline , not the color that matters . 
  `` out of character and really awful '', 
  he 's resting his eyes in a slightly different way ... 
  jesus christ , if this is something that bothers you maybe you should go outside or something . 
  i believe it 's like that in norway and probably some other nordic countries . 
  but that 's not what i 'm saying , i 'm saying that it 's a barely noticeable detail about how someone in a video game is resting his eyes . 
  he said that it was `` out of character and really awful '' , people are entitled to an opinion , but it seems like people are really upset about a barely noticeable detail . 
  please do n't reply to him , it 's a pathetic troll account , reaction is what makes him do it . 
  sausage party , us only ? 
  do we have any indication on house of cards yet ? 
  or he can just keep spouting this bullshit until he loses 2020 and cries about how rigged it is . 
  i 'm not , i 'm just saying that it seems like a non-issue , he 's not portraying any emotion other than `` i 'm looking at this camera '' . 
  i do n't get how the change could be any worse . 
  you seem to be the exact type of person that you 're describing , unable to have a reasonable discussion , instead jumping to insults and refusing to acknowledge anything good about him . 
  i 'm not trying to defend trump with this post , i 'm the first to criticize him if he does or says something stupid , i 'm just saying that his supporters being so aggressive and constantly antagonizing the left is more infuriating to me than the stupid shit he does . 
  fair point . 
  how does this stop smurfs ? 
  why not ? 
  he 's saying that billions of people should die ... 
  hyperx cloud 2 . 
  used to have the razer kraken pro but the hyperx is definitely an improvement , 7.1 audio is a game changer . 
  it works on ps4 too which i did n't think it would when i bought it . 
  no but you do n't understand it was cold the other day . 
  if you 're looking to get a new pair i 'd definitely recommend them . 
  75 $ or so . 
  i was hoping the end was gon na be him coming around the corner and you pulling out your sledgehammer , then putting it back after a moment . 
  if it 's usb it 's 7.1, 
  was going to , will do in a bit . 
  edit : [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blghbiddvdc ), 
  it does but it 's a bit wonky . 
  i think so , have n't tried it without 7.1 for very long . 
  if you just unplug it , then plug it back in it 'll start working normally again . 
  sorry , hijacking the top comment to [ post the video version in case anyone wants to hear it for themselves . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blghbiddvdc ), 
  waiting for poe 's law , any minute now . 
  controller . 
  you can get it to work , it 's just that the little box thing sometimes stops working on ps4 . 
  not on the playstation chat at least . 
  yeah , i 've definitely met a few people with insane aim in the last few weeks , it 's always satisfying to kill them . 
  11 would include him too ... 
  i could make 10 accounts and upvote you but that 's embezzlement . 
  well the wall did work hundreds of years ago , why would n't it work now ? 
  it 's not like there have been any significant advancements in areal transportation in the last century . 
  serenity pointed this out in one of his videos too . 
  they might , not 100 % sure . 
  awesome !, 
  i hope they do n't let you down . 
  what system are you on ? 
  i never change the volume because it 's fine how i have it , so i do n't know .
