  me and most of my friends play cod with friends only though , the people on that game that shittalk you online are so annoying . 
  also , zombies !, 
  not if you were still in high school a few ^ ^ ( 3-4ish ) years ago ... 
  `` after i fuck you in the butt , get some head , bust a nut , get some rest . '', 
  - truly inspitational words from eminem . 
   edit : grammer, 
  haha, 
  that thing looks repulsive . 
  lovin ' hearing all these slim shady era songs lately !, 
  nessie 's smaller though . 
   why , rob ? 
  ftfy, 
  i totally thought so too :p, 
  statistics about things that kill people . 
  ex , you 're more likely to get killed by a vending machine than a shark . 
  no you 're not , you 're more likely to be around vending machines . 
  that 's pretty sweet . 
  nooooooooooooo ^ r ^ w ^ e ^ g ^ i ^ a ^ n, 
  i feel like it 's just that a lot of norwegian actors are really bad compared to the us . 
  source : i 'm ^ ^ 1/2 norwegian, 
  hahahah , yes !, 
  mr. bean to the rescue !, 
  i do n't even like pc that much and that 's fucking beautiful . 
  meth time for me !, 
  `` there 's no way out '', 
  * turns around and drives back *, 
  do n't shake the interviewers hand . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ source . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ that 's, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ the, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ interview !, 
  check the source code . 
  i think my lingering / r/trypophobia is acting up . 
  actually a lot of people do n't mind it until they find out that it 's a thing , then after they learn about it feel the effects of it . 
  did n't know it was placebo , it makes sence though . 
  but would n't me knowing it was a placebo make me realize that it 's not that bad ? 
  people in the pc masterrace do n't realize that people mock them when saying `` pc masterrace is better '' or `` consoles are better than pc '' just to annoy them . 
  [ can we talk for a minute about how this video is the best thing ever ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwpftqaqzji ), 
  i love how this post barely mentions penguins , but this video has been linked 3 times in 2 hours . 
  may i recommend alcohol ? 
  she 's a bit too skinny though . 
  i 'm not agreeing with the tumblr people , but i 'd prefer someone more like [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/ikmpozt ) [ nsfw ], 
  thanks . 
  i have some [ hotlines ] ( http://imgur.com/puq7uyv ) too !, 
  you could be like a badass chick taking down the government or something . 
  my money 's practically falling out of my wallet already . 
  i miss being able to blow someones head off with a single bullet from an assault rifle :(, 
  was mostly annoying , aside from the snowballs you could n't see anything more than a donkeys ass in front of you , and driving was a bitch . 
  they added a nother few days after that because of the ddos . 
  hah , i see what you did there . 
  this picture was linked on that post . 
  ahhhh , gives me the chills ... / r/trypophobia, 
  what game was this ? 
  i find it funny that if you commented this outside of this sub , someone 'd post it here and we 'd make fun of you . 
  in the infamous words of / u/jacksfilms : random \u2260 funny . 
  apparantly , only 2 posts though so i do n't think he 's active . 
  i thought it was better than just writing jacksfilms . 
  that sucks my friend , maybe next year !, 
  oh , i did n't get the katana then i think , do n't remember that happening . 
  might have to re-buy it . 
  the penguin falls and all the other one 's just go `` holy shit kevin , that 's like the 4th time , last time jerry got eaten by a fucking seal , do you wan na get eaten by a seal kevin ? 
  we 're never gon na get to wherever the fuck penguins go . '', 
  i have n't seen march of the penguins in a long time . 
  i thought so , it 's hard to know when people are joking on the internet . 
  hah , yup . 
  on reddit few thing are unclicked for me , this should 've been one of them . 
  she 's not as skinny as the girl in the picture though . 
  yes , but there 's such a thing as too much realism , it was way to hard to fly . 
  oh shit , me too ... 
   rules : you get a pallet of this product/item every week . 
  you ca n't sell it off , you ca n't send it back . 
  yeah ... 
  well , then you could try to destroy a bowling ball every day , that 'd be cool . 
  dumping them off overpasses . 
  hello !, 
  zoolander . 
  thanks , will play . 
  haha awesome !, 
  no shit , this has happened to me 4 times the last week . 
  do n't shoot before they try to , but always be alert . 
  i try not to . 
  what console are you on ? 
  if ps3 i can help you get to know the game . 
  me too . 
  mine 's supposed to be 5mbs but when i checked yesterday it was at 1.3 mbs . 
  i can still play online fine though ... o.o, 
  like in the prologue when trevor leans out the window with a carbine rifle . 
  man , i 've had a lot of discussions with my friends about this . 
  that video is amazing . 
  i did n't notice this before like 7 seconds after i opened the image . 
  not complaining , i liked the snow , i was just telling the guy that missed it that it was n't that great . 
  did you just not feel like finding out how much xvi is ? 
  if i squint my eyes i can kinda see what op means . 
  i 'm getting a ps4 in a few months , maybe if you 're still a noob we can play . 
  i assume you 'll be fine though . 
  if you wan na add me it 's : ghostmw2awsome, 
  move along . 
  every . 
  single .
