  nobody in the current league uses hacks . 
  what leads you to believe this ? 
  he 's trying to pay attention to what every player is doing at all times , seems easy to miss . 
  how shortly ? 
  days ? 
  weeks ? 
  thanks , i 'm not too familiar with these things and i do n't know why i was downvoted . 
  i think it 's general consensus that it was a fluke , it did n't really look like an aim lock . 
  he streamed right afterwards and chat was so hype about this lol . 
  the revolver needs multiple mags , bad idea . 
  hipfire is so useless in this game . 
  yeah i know , i did n't mean for it to sound sarcastic i was just wondering when we 'd know . 
  he gets paid either way . 
  fair enough . 
  why ? 
  do you follow sports ? 
  it 's the same idea , of course it 's difficult but if you know lots about the teams it 's fairly manageable and usually you just have one or 2 teams that you follow . 
  i make sure to message any person who kills me during an interrogation `` nice wallhacks '' . 
  people usually do n't respond well :(, 
  roamers are n't an issue if you have a team that 's good at droning, 
  blitz is trash, 
  his gun was nerfed, 
  what do you mean ? 
  they have to be on one of them ? 
  it 's the default button ... ? 
  c4 is the same as it is anytime you 're playing an operator with c4 . 
  yes it is ... ? 
  any time you 're playing pulse , bandit , valkyrie and you have c4 , the c4 is on the left , like this clip, 
  obviously ... 
  not from an opfor . 
  not against people with over 14 iq . 
  big if true, 
  i 'm norwegian , lvl 170 ~ rank , plat 2 , psn is ghostmw2awsome . 
  will drop a message . 
  how so ? 
  but then why can americans comment on the state of europe ? 
  fair enough then . 
  do you remember his name ? 
  i do n't see how , you 're still on a level playing field but on console you need to deal with people who have m/kb adapters . 
  i think the team on match point still wins , i 've tied on 3-2 before on ranked and we won 4-3 . 
  oh for sure , it 's hard to know these intricacies when ties are so rare . 
  how long is it live for ? 
  i met a guy earlier who had 60-100 ping at the beginning of the round and as soon as they got into the building he started hitting 300-400 . 
  that 's the kind of people i hate playing against . 
  he rushed with ash every attacking round and got 13k . 
  it 's almost as though when someone bombs and mass murders the fuck out of your homeland you want retaliation . 
  it does n't matter , i 'd say there 's definitely reasons to do it , to avoid someone hearing what operator you are or where you are or if you 're afraid you 'll miss . 
  i feel like it 's basically the same as mira but more powerful . 
  yeah but it allows for the same kind of fast peeking that mira 's so good for . 
  yeah but unless you can shoot from both sides , the person with the shield will basically have a peekers advantage machine ? 
  i 'm not 100 % sure but i do n't know if it actually goes away before you get revived ... ? 
  why is teabagging penalty points ? 
  that 's why i said `` before you get revived '', 
  kills do n't matter , if you waste my time so someone can see a different set of pixels at the end of the game , with the same score , i 'll be annoyed with you . 
  so many people freak out at me when i almost step out as last defender alive , like , are we not playing the same game ? 
  5 one taps , in true kix style . 
  i 'd rather spend my time playing the game and getting better rather than waiting for someone to prove some sort of point . 
  i 'm just saying i would rather frost just takes the assist instead . 
  yeah , valkyrie would be extremely powerful if you could get the cam anywhere you wanted . 
  ah i 'm such an idiot , i thought there was just a random influx of people calling youtube `` the tube '', 
  unlike all the nice rainbow friends bombs ... ? 
  what do you mean , there 's plenty of differences between console and pc already , it 's not like they 're exactly the same now . 
  yes they do . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  i play high plat/diamond on console and kb/m is a big issue . 
  so there is ... 
  what do you mean ? 
  i 'm saying that there are a lot of players who use kb/m to get an advantage and nothing 's being done about it . 
  random question , where in norway ? 
  i 'm out of a job :p, 
  damn , i assume moving to hamar is the only criteria and i can start working with you guys right ? 
  i 'd rather have a variety in guns than accuracy . 
  yeah but now they do n't have 50 ops and i 'd like some variety brought to each op . 
  this might not be the case but i feel like hibana 's launcher has this as well , i swear i 've had to hit the button twice for it to work recently . 
  in that case you both massively chocked . 
  so typical of people on this subreddit to be so insanely blindly nostalgic . 
  `` anyone wish they did n't add battleeye ? 
  it makes the game too easy to play against legitimate players , ubi must hate the playerbase . '', 
  he contracted cancer , and that 's what killed him at 2:02, 
  you do realize that they do n't just add `` tom clancy 's '' for fun right ? 
  they 're harder to memorize though , the one 's now are all colour coded and generally have more to do with the op 's ability than the old ones . 
  then take a look at black ops 3 zombies . 
  that game had us all on our toes for an entire year . 
  what the hell man , everyone knows it 's :, 
  '' ** fwoomp ** ** fwoomp ** ** fwoomp ** ** fwoomp ** ** fwoomp ** '', 
  it definitely implies one of 3 things , ignorance , idiocy or arrogance . 
  `` huh , he 's putting a hole in that wall , what a confused noob , let me fix that for him . '', 
  a few things , since the attackers can come in from outside they have 5 entrances to the room and you only have 1 , meaning that they can open up all 4 windows , kill anyone in the room , get in and start securing/planting while they only need to watch the door , something that can be done by a person rappelling on the window . 
  the way to counter this is to open up everything so you can cover the room as a defender from bathroom , master bedroom , workshop , stairs etc. . . 
  the farthest i 'd go is reinforcing 1 wall in the closet to sit in there so you can fast peek with mira or throw c4 and smoke out . 
  good luck !, 
  that 's an exploit and i will call you an asshole if you use it as a defence tactic . 
  i get the feeling that this castle is n't gon na be the best though . 
   they cling onto using the tom clancy name when honestly if they did n't , they 'd have a lot more free reign to develop a game to be better . 
  they 're contractually obligated to use the name , they 're not `` clinging to it '' . 
  dick . 
  jackal not realizing that he should shoot out the canister is something that you should notice if you 're plat/diamond . 
  he was obviously looking at the mirror for several seconds . 
  but before that the other guy said that they should n't have called it `` tom clancy 's rainbow six '', 
  ah right , i thought it was 1v1 , my bad .
