  you 're mistaken , virgin olive oil is oil that has been fucked by virgins , this is why we contact you for extra virgin olive oil . 
  you remember when every post on this sub was n't about some mediocre feature that got changed and now everyone acts like the old operator screen helped them beat cancer and overcome depression ? 
  most people have good aim on console . 
  posts here are usually highlighting bad aim . 
  surrender does n't affect anything . 
  no , it just ends the game earlier . 
  edit : why is this being downvoted ? 
  play with 1 other person . 
  man , montagne getting cyber bullied by echo in penta v pducks was my favourite thing . 
  awesome , thanks , did n't know . 
  50:30 if it does n't go there automatically . 
  because it does n't matter . 
  probably had a valk cam on the plant and got the call for it . 
  maybe monty gets an assist if someone kills a guy that was shooting at his shield . 
  i think they should change it to the round count instead of maps won , map wins are usually pretty misleading as to how close the match was . 
  i asked canadian if he regrets cutting him since george has been doing better statistically than slash and he got a bit annoyed and said that he likes his team the way it is and that he 's confident they 'll win . 
  it was before they lost, 
  it was n't phrased like that , i said something along the lines of `` do you regret swapping george for slash , george has done really well this pro league and i have n't seen much from slash '', 
  he just said something along the lines of `` slash still has much to show off '' . 
  because he 's broken . 
  *** flufvy was not okay with that ***, 
  i swear i have n't seen a smoke hold a gun all pro league . 
  she got revived in a weird spot i guess . 
  i mean they immediately stopped the round , it 's not like valk tried to use it to win . 
  in what way did esl ignore it ? 
  ps4 holds 60 interestingly . 
  no , we 'd only get like 3 different maps in ranked ever . 
  ca n't use grenades on the top . 
  why ? 
  what 's your issue man , it 's not possible . 
  he answered as i expected him to . 
  then why are you being such a dick about it ? 
  why not ? 
  no , they reset the round , they did n't ignore it , lethal still won . 
  you ca n't throw grenades through the top vent on packaging, 
  how is it inconsistent ? 
  i ca n't think of anything happening like this where the team that had the advantage just got the win instead of a restart . 
  yeah i know . 
  i 'm just confused . 
  yeah , i do n't like bartlett at all but after playing clubhouse , oregon , chalet and hereford 35 times in a 4 hour gaming session i 'd wan na kill myself . 
  he was completely out of ammo on the bearing and his team collapsed around him , was n't much he could do either way . 
  `` welp , guess i 'm a sledge/smoke main for 2-3 hours '', 
  you can stop worrying about aids now . 
  it 's a glitch and gives an unfair advantage to defenders . 
  would also put pressure on game developers seeing as how they have to make an entertaining game they ca n't sell on the trailer for all the 3 systems . 
  it gives an unfair advantage to the defenders , there 's a reason it 's banned in pro play . 
  i was just curious if he had any thoughts on it , just because he answered how i expected does n't mean that i was trying to hurt his feelings or that i knew 100 % how he was gon na answer . 
  i do n't think this video game is half as important as you 're making it out to be . 
  well , looks like it 's time to boycott united . 
  there will always be fuckbag assholes who just want to make others as miserable as possible . 
  getting paid to be a dirty spawn killer , living the dream . 
  it 's true you know , living in norway i 've literally eaten nothing but potatos and meatballs 3 meals a day for 74 months , i weigh 19kg . 
  how do i report for doxxing ? 
  `` i thought that was the smallest meal at mcdonalds ! '', 
  - americans, 
  when you meet someone who sees you like you see you in the mirror . 
  yeah , oregon and clubhouse are so outplayed from previous seasons , clubhouse had fallen out of favor but everyone still plays oregon . 
  idk how to fix these maps being so repetitive/boring though . 
  all in the time it took them to play 2 matches . 
  from the sounds of it we 'll see some coastline from vertical later in the season and probably some skyscrapers eventually . 
  when was this ? 
  will it ever be available for ps4 ? 
  i assume no because of updates ? 
  i know i was more referring to toxic players , who usually do shit like this , not that people that do this are toxic . 
  i do n't know about that , vertical/f3 and ctm/ominous were amazing . 
  it does n't mean that they wo n't be in alpha packs if they have a placeholder rarity though . 
  was it ? 
  oregon and border were pretty one-sided . 
  yeah , he has plenty of full pro league games if you wan na hear comms . 
  do n't think so . 
  he tweeted once that he `` was n't jumping right into it today '' and he lost 400,000 subs in an hour , never again . 
  also , if you 're teammate 's down on his own and the revive icon disappears without them dying , they 're being interrogated . 
  this applies to real world us politics as well . 
  what pisses me off is that he 's not even getting back on her , he just wasted 60 + years of human experience because of some fucking dumb personal issue and mental instability . 
  the reference is that this is some black mirror shit , a literal nonchalant murder being streamed online for millions to see . 
  guy says to his live stream `` imma kill this dude walking right here '' , gets out of his car , walks up to some old dude , asks him some random questions and just shoots him in the head , seemingly to get back on his ex . 
  yeah :(, 
  5 days, 
  he played ranked with troy and ecl9 the other day , it does n't seem likely that they have any hard feelings . 
  really ? 
  you can still put bandits , mira 's and ads ' in that room so it 's not impossible to hold . 
  yeah . 
  why are there so many glocks in cod games ? 
  servers and ping compensation ... 
  lol what 's with your weird superiority complex about having a pc ? 
  yeah , happened to me in a 1v1 when the enemies were up 4-3 the other day :(, 
  played against a silver 2 in casual yesterday who dropped 18k in a 3-2 game , and was out gunning me and all my mid-high plat friends in 1v1s . 
  and ... ? 
  do you have more fun with the game ? 
  is your life amazing ? 
  i have fun with my friends on my playstation without having to worry about my game crashing every 20 minutes or hackers taking me down to copper . 
   no hackers, 
  okie dokie, 
  okay , i will ... 
  [ huh , would ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/rainbow6/comments/62u4wl/not_sure_if_recent_ban_wave_got_them_but_hackers/ ) [ you look ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/rainbow6/comments/62u4wl/not_sure_if_recent_ban_wave_got_them_but_hackers/ ) [ at that . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/rainbow6/comments/62q69c/back_to_season_1_the_amount_of_hackers_is_insane/ ), 
  800 hours you have to have played since before battle eye , i no-life this game and have 450 hours since battle eye came out . 
  how long ? 
  what does that mean ? 
  like usable in the next month ?
