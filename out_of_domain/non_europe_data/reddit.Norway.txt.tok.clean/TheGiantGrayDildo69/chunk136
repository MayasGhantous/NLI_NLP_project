  why is n't the stg and mp-40 wallbuy in verrukt and shi no if both the guns are in origins ? 
  i 've never used theater mode and mine 's 115 . 
  leroy as in leroy jenkins , because the guy on buried just sprints into stuff . 
  * looks at video of noah using 8 perks on nacht *, 
  well 23 and 27 's not far apart . 
  thanks bb , 
  yung is n't on a team . 
  oh , canadian said he was looking for a team . 
  just do right-right-down because one right arrow should put you on smoke , maybe mute . 
  `` this bitch on my left guaranteed there 's a god '', 
  me too :(, 
  reserve ` chute or he caught a ride with one of the guys that did have one . 
  it 's adequate punishment in christianity . 
  i know , i showed him a faster way . 
  why do n't you skip the credits when you have to download the episodes anyway ? 
  ah , fair enough , i did n't notice since i do n't know the actors name but it 's kinda hard to miss those credits to be fair . 
  it 's because of operators like hibana , blackbeard and capitao making it hard to stay in the room successfully . 
  how often is fuze picked though , really ? 
  what 's a hound dog ? 
  what rank ? 
  hope so , it 's extremely hard for someone like me who 's not the best to be dealing with the panzer by round 8 when i want the shield , jugg , qr , staminup , good guns and at least 4-5 generators at least before killing him , he has so much health . 
  some of us do n't have unlimited gobblegums though , i do n't have any perkas and i struggle getting past the first panzer round . 
  yeah , i stopped playing a few weeks after revelations and i used all my good gobblegums because i knew i would stop playing . 
  i always read that as `` did n't may-antou '', 
   watch in fullscreen, 
  if anyone 's in doubt , v3 definitely showed that they were 2nd best today , bd have 1.5 players who can even be regarded as pros . 
  idk if you got it from here but i posted this a [ few days ago . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/rainbow6/comments/6az2xe/around_110_hours_in_and_i_just_realized_i_could/dhj6trf/ ), 
  [ here 's one of my own . 
  ] ( https://gfycat.com/remorsefuloptimalcoyote ), 
  worth mentioning , i lost elo and got a surrender sanction . 
  ubi actually is literally hitler ? 
  i thought this was bug fixes for this patch and i was suddenly so happy . 
  also , back when the `` golden shower-gate '' thing happened it was posted there and iirc it 's the only thing ever on that sub to be flaired as `` unconfirmed '' . 
  just like just cause 3 . 
  then just win the next one . 
  `` morphed '' works as a pun too at least . 
  how do you unlock the one at the very top-left ? 
  i 've seen it in game before so i know it 's not unreleased . 
  2 minutes into this [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgebvc50nua ) he has it on all his guns . 
  really ? 
  i did n't know . 
  if you do n't play the game , the laser on the door blows you up on contact . 
  the guy with the shield got pretty lucky . 
  shoot the box 4 times , do a 360 and shoot it 4 more times for guaranteed ray gun every time . 
  edit : [ worth adding in , still works .

  little did we know that the entirety of zombies as a gamemode is just a large scale experiment to prove the existence of confirmation bias . 
  where ? 
  i have over 650 hours in the game and just finished a 7.5 hour gaming session , but for some reason your description made me really want to buy it . 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ think ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ finished ^ ^ processing ^ ^ yet ^ ^ but [ ^ ^ i ^ ^ streamed ^ ^ it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxblehm1jmg ) ^ ^ if ^ ^ anyone ^ ^ thinks ^ ^ i 'd ^ ^ lie ^ ^ for ^ ^ karma, 
  so true lmao , teabagging has dozens of different meaning in this game , just got ta know . 
  there 's the `` thanks for saving me '' , or the `` what 's up ? 
  you just chillin ' too ? 
  '' , the `` you 're terrible at this game '' , not to be mistaken with the `` you got caught in a frost trap at the end of the round and i 'm j\u00e4ger but somehow i still feel the need to act like i outplayed you '' . 
  just need to pay attention . 
  i swear , that * one * cam on favelas get me a tk every fucking time , it 's gotten to the point where i lie down as soon as i spawn and wait 10 seconds before shooting it . 
  coincidentally it helps counter the spawnkilling on that map . 
  honestly , remove points for scanning at all , it should be an entirely tactical move to scan someone , not something you 'd do for +5 points . 
  but smoke is generally a far more useful and easier pick than echo , and sledge has more ammo on his primary than hibana . 
  do n't see why you 'd need to buff smoke and sledge when they 're good already . 
  i 'd say maybe give the smg-11 one or two more mags . 
  main door spawn on coastline is heaven for running out on inexperienced players . 
  i 'm 2 months late because i was looking through old posts mentioning pengu , worth mentioning that in pro league settings there 's no hit indicator so he could n't see where he was being shot from , sure he should have heard the guy behind him but he was n't entirely clueless . 
  yup , haha . 
  fuck sake , was just about to make this lmao , came here to download the template image from the op ... 
  when things are highlighted in pictures like this i only read the highlighted part and it ** never ** works , what 's the point of highlighting a section of the text if i need to read everything anyways ? 
  he has to at least get jugg before he goes there at least . 
  would n't there be a way for trusted publishers or at least having trusted games that can update their game without the long , drawn out process ? 
  this would be ideal for grey i would imagine but i believe he 's mentioned in the past that he does n't want to jailbreak his phone . 
  worst case is his lawyer gets called and is stressed out for however long it takes grey to get a signal . 
  he 's like our collective stern but soft at heart dad , except instead of being soft at heard he just murders people . 
  was watching a clip from super early alpha today , 32 round mag , 220 + rounds in reserve . 
  they got 500 when they demoed it at lan for the pro league . 
  i have a 7.1 headset and it 's basically night and day compared to my 5.1 headset . 
  is this only for the official ps4 headset ? 
  wow , how crazy to think what would have happened , i 'd be unsurprised if the us became a bit of a dictatorship in the absence of another superpower and after having nuked millions of people multiple times . 
  if you need some help with the steep learning curve , add me on psn : ghostmw2awsome, 
  both, 
  the other day i was playing with 3 guys , one played rook , one played smoke and one played bandit , they said we needed a rotate hole so bandit went c4 , rook said he did n't feel safe in the site we were defending and smoke said we need barb so he went barb ... that was the last time i played with those guys . 
  like the guy below said , bandit barbed , smoke impact , or rook impact if you need more barbed . 
  i know , it 's just that the whole way of thinking that lead to the 3 loadouts made me question humanity . 
  you 're looking for immersion in a cod game ... ? 
  sorry to tell you buddy ... 
  black ops was probably one of the most immersive games yet ... ? 
  nothing gets me immersed in a game like 360 noscoping noobs on highrise or grenade launching people across the map . 
  what do you mean ? 
  the shop tab < literally anything, 
  it takes far more data and does n't load in-app or using extensions like imagus . 
  can you give me an example ? 
  why was sergio banned ? 
  this is n't loaded at all , i have barely any clue who he is or why he 'd be banned . 
  is there any work being done to improve the spectating system ? 
  it 's incredibly inconsistent and so easy to miss kills far too often . 
  i understand that this is partially due to the spectator but the spectator mode seems like it could use some updates . 
  i 'm in the city for the day and just had a heart attack because i thought my phone was at 22 %, 
  / r/chargeyourphone, 
  this has been happening a lot recently , the past 2 ranked games i 've played have been 4 plats and 1 gold vs 5 diamonds and 5 plats vs 4 diamonds and a plat . 
  no , just yung and slash . 
  king george has n't been on ctm since the invitational .
