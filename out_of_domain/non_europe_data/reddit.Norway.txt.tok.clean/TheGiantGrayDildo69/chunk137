  it still has the same 3 members of necrox , nvk and canadian . 
  i guess not but george and slash were in the same role is what i 'm getting at , ctm has had the same 4 members since s3 up until yung left , only changing up the 5th spot . 
  it always annoys me that they always use `` dirk from veristablium '' in the podcast , imo it 's way funnier the way you 're using it , by changing it up every time , like the `` bazinga '' memes . 
  `` dexter from vegetarian '', 
  what 's the font ? 
  heat up some frozen fries with mayo/ketchup , depending on your taste , i can get a pretty sizeable bag for like $ 3 from my local grocery . 
  because it does n't hold the attention of the 12 year olds most likely to watch the video . 
  i 'm not trying to stereotype or be mean but it 's the honest to god answer . 
  `` oh , 3 of my teammates just died here ? 
  let me drop , obviously *** i 'll *** get the kill . 
  when has cod not been `` arcadey/gameified '' ? 
  same happened in black ops 3 . 
  same as microsoft when they were on top , the best selling console will never benefit from cross-play . 
  we wo n't have school shootings unless we start letting in american immigrants . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-caylnvvuko ) with my squad 's reaction . 
  he has n't been picked up yet , do n't imagine it 'll take long though , he 's one of the best players in eu . 
  why ? 
  nutty pengu clutch n00t n00t, 
  honestly you 're completely right , what the hell was pulse doing during that 1v3 on consulate ? 
  he 's literally 25cm away and he thinks he 's on the other side of the room . 
  secure area esports lol . 
  i 'm curious as to why you think that ? 
  i do n't think i 'm objectively right , i just ca n't think of why it 's better than bomb . 
  makes sense , i 'm a really competitive person and enjoy the strategy and teamwork of the game so that 's probably why i enjoy bomb more . 
  thanks for the reply !, 
  `` why ? '', 
  `` because there 's a huge ass sign in the way '', 
  / u/its _ epi , i know you do n't usually comment on leaks but do you have any more info here ? 
  mzo was offered a spot casting this season but kix did n't wan na give up any airtime so mzo did n't take it because he did n't wan na move to poland just to be a sub . 
  he did it because he could n't , mzo did n't take the casting job because unless something like this happens kix wanted to cast 100 % of the time . 
  mzo and kix are both analysts though so it would n't work out well , you need bloodbath or panky to do play-by-play and since panky left kix would need to give some of his airtime to mzo . 
  the problem with glaz is that he went from weak but fun to boring as fuck , but op as hell , then since the nerf he 's just meh in terms of killing and he 's not fun to just mess around with either , so ubi basically just ruined the entire operator . 
  he 's been pretty pissed at youtube for the terrible cpm i know . 
  i swear yung and necrox donutted half the games they played last season but slash got all the hate . 
  not trying to trash talk , just mean that slash did n't seem to have worse performance than anyone in particular , do n't remember what the scoreboards looked like most of last season so forgive me misremembering . 
  is that from louis c.k. 
  ca n't help but feel like this would be better suited with doc . 
  valk shotgun main pls, 
  try being white . 
  pronounced encee or `` e , n , c , e '', 
  how 'd you get the invitatonal charm ? 
  do n't talk to me or my son ever again . 
  i 'm basically always that guy on my team , everyone else goes and hunts the last 2 kills of the round , i sit still , then i get blamed if we loose because i have the least amount of kills . 
  s t y l e b o y e, 
  ** autistic screeching **, 
  as a smoke player , i have ;(, 
  how does the last one go down when she 's last alive ? 
  it 's bomb ... 
  jews always sit in hats . 
  yeah but the round should end when she goes down . 
  oh it 's the prep phase , right , thanks . 
  what ... 
  i 'm going on vacation for 2 weeks ;(, 
  do n't know if it was a troll but i seem to remember the quote `` the only reason she lost is because she got less votes '', 
  sub ? 
  we did last year . 
  when do they come out ? 
  fair enough . 
  if nvk reloaded his gun and droned properly ctm would have had consulate . 
  honestly , adam being in pro league with more than 0.15 k/d is incredibly disappointing . 
  you should just watch the black mirror episode , obviously some of the surprise will be gone but i think it 's still worth it since they do n't really keep the whole `` it 's all a simulation '' that secret through the course of the episode . 
  i would definitely watch swat situation training if it was streamed anywhere !, 
  when is it over ? 
  edit : monday the 17th so keep the votes coming , rl is catching up !, 
  i 'm not agreeing with his point but i 've seen many times where pros are complaining on twitter about hitreg and bugs after the matches they play . 
  in that case you should also check out an episode called `` playtest '' ( i believe ) , i think it 's episode 2 of season 3 . 
  damn , this is the `` hot aunt may '' i 've heard so much about . 
  relatable . 
  i get the feeling that the blowing people up is n't an attempt to convert people ... 
  penta took it seriously last season , iirc pengu and fabian complained afterwards on twitter because they felt like they were the better team but gifu were n't taking it seriously so penta felt disrespected . 
  i think falko deserves a place there , his showing last season at lan was some of the best stuff i 've seen in this game ever . 
  kanto 's an amazing fragger but if you ask me , sha77e is way more consistent and pengu has the game sense of a god . 
  top 3 pengu , sha77e and falko . 
  if there 's one match you should watch , i 'd recommend flipsid3 vs ominous from last season or continuum vs flipsid3 from a week ago ( or so ) . 
  canadian ( ctm ) was doing a breakdown penta 's semi finals last season and fabian was in his chat saying the same thing , why the hell does nobody ban consulate against penta when they literally have n't lost on that map since y1 . 
  i think the only team that will end up beating penta this season is ence or * possibly * the first br team to not play like a br team . 
  it 's a bit fucky on map 1 because of the rehost . 
  i see what you 're saying but honestly if consulate got banned i 'd imagine it would have gone to a 3rd map . 
  if nobody can even bring them to overtime for 2 full seasons , probably best to just stick with something else . 
  he makes $ 500,000 - $ 5,000,000 a ** month ** just from yt ad revenue . 
  he 's not worried about a fine . 
  bad bot, 
  kills him once while he 's paying attention to something else and once in a 1v5 , not to mention all the times falko killed him which he did n't show in that video . 
  i do n't think losing 2 hard gunfights in ranked makes you a bad player lol . 
  anybody gets tilted by toxic players . 
  a few extra fun details i could n't put in the title : the messages played in the patient 's ears were things like `` you are a good wife and mother and people enjoy your company '' , which would be played for as long as 101 days non-stop in one case . 
  people in his care were in many cases people suffering from anxiety or depression searching for a easy fix . 
  there 's more information [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_united_states ) , if you ctrl + f `` subproject 68 '', 
  yeah , was gon na have it in there , so much compelling information i wanted to keep in the title , damned 300 character limit ... 
  pretty sure i 'm right on the mark with 300 characters lol . 
  yeah lol , exactly the vibe i get from all i 've read . 
  `` we need to do some tests ! '', 
  ** `` what kind of tests ? 
  `` we torture people for months then see if they just stop being '', 
  ** `` brilliant , here 's $ 25,000,000 !, 
  '' ** ( i think that 's the actual number they got for mkultra ), 
  who 's that ? 
  well , people did reportedly forget their parents and their own name ... 
  i feel cheated that this is the til i lost out to , mine was far more interesting . 
  why ?
