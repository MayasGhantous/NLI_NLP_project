  put a razor on the inside of the leash . 
  sorry about this but a few days before the msf someone posted a thread concerning the wiki about how there were some pretty huge spoilers on there . 
  i need help finding the post because i wanted to see if it was correct but i ca n't seem to find it searching through the sub . 
  thanks . 
  from living in a small town with no internet to escaping from north korea , as long as you did n't know much/anything about the outside world . 
  no mic , skype : ghostmw2awsome . 
  the chrome extention to be exact , for me it 's stopped loading pictures properly and stopped loading . gifs at all . 
  i also saw a post about it being down on the appstore and was wondering why ? 
  i 've just finished the humane labs heist and i 'm waiting for a call from lester but nothing 's happened and i 've been online for an hour waiting , does anyone know if there 's something you need to do to initiate the next heist ? 
  me and 3 of my friends have done it 2 times now on hard flawlessly , yet i still see you a new post every day of some hilariously dumb fail . 
  it takes soooooo long to speed run the heists because of this . 
  me and my friends finally got around to our 3rd attempt of the mastermind and had just finished the prison break - plane setup when we all checked our mastermind progress , but when i looked at mine it said that i had 0/26 on the mastermind even though all my friends had 4/26 . 
  does anyone have any suggestions or do we just restart ?

  both fallout 3 and new vegas are 90 % on store right now and i 'm wondering which i should get ? 
  ( i can only get one ), 
  thank you in advance . 
  so i have the elgato hd60 capture card but as some of you may know it does n't record ps3 because of the hdcp . 
  so a friend of mine came with the idea that i should buy an av to hdmi converter so i can use the original av multi cable that comes with the ps3 , connect it to the converter , then output an hdmi cable from the converter , into the hd60 and into my tv . 
  after i did this and had everything done i opened the elgato game capture hd software that you need to record and was faced with the problem of having a blue screen . 
  after about 10 minutes of googling i found out that i need to change the video output settings on my ps3 , after doing this i realized that it was locked at 720 x 576 . 
  my final question is if there 's any way to get the ps3 to a higher resolution than 576i ?

  anyone up for it ? 
  bonus : i bought a bundle with all the fallout 3 and new vegas dlcs thinking it was the actual games . 
  on the bright side i picked up fallout 3 today when buying the ps store vouchers . 
  does anyone know how to swap os x yosemite with windows 10 ? 
  i have a mac air mid 2013 13 '' model , not sure about the specs . 
  also , if anyone has a better sub for me to post this , please link and i will delete this post . 
  i 'm so sick of having a `` lets hate on people spending their money in a slightly different way '' instead of an actual pc gamins subreddit . 
  has anyone other than me noticed how ridiculously low the highest sensetivity setting is ? 
  is there any way to make it go higher ?

  so for the last few months any new game i 've bought i either have n't played or had such a bad time with it that i wanted my money back . 
  i thought it was going to be the same case with fallout 3 after not playing it for a while after buying it and was pleasantly surprised when i found out how amazingly fun it is . 
  aside from a few gripes ( max sensetivity , running speed ) i 'm honestly very impressed with the detail to this game and the depth to everything you do . 
  also i just lastly want to add how after playing spec ops : the line and hearing everyone say how horrible it would make you feel about yourself , i did n't really feel bad about anything . 
  but after [ blowing up megaton for a measly 1000 caps ] ( / spoiler ) i feel very conflicted , and i 'm considering killing that shady guy and taking his suit . 
  i killed everyone after i blew up megaton and now i ca n't do the quest with the ghouls . 
  is this a bad thing or is it an optional sidequest that does n't really matter ? 
  i also have a shit ton of power armors that i do n't know what to do with because i ca n't sell them to anyone and fuck bringing them to another town to sell to someone . 
  when i 'm in a chat with my friend and i save a clip his voice volume is insanely low ( to the point were i need a $ 500 headset to make out what he 's saying ) and i was just wondering if there 's any way to make it louder ? 
  whoever works at ubisoft who thought of that , fuck you . 
  as someone with about 3 mbps down and up i tend to play solo but after playing this game i 'm disappoinded with ubisoft . 
  here are my reasons for saying this :, 
  getting disconnected while playing solo , it really sucks and is completely unnessecary . 
  having to wait so long on all the screens just to restart a match . 
  ( why not have a `` start '' button for solo players ?? ), 
  they 'll end your game in literally 1 second and there 's nothing you can do about it if they catch you off guard . 
  ( maybe tone down the amount of suicide bombers on solo ),
