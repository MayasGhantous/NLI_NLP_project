  surely there 's a file that counts down how many days i have left that i could just delete , no ? 
  clarification : i 'm also on the newest version of osx el capitan . 
  does anyone know the exact time that the beta should be up on ps4 in the eu ? 
  ( norway to be exact ), 
  so i 've recently started making videos and of course editing and i 've been using camtasia studio 2 for osx ( i know ) and all i was wondering was if there 's any way for me to set it so it automatically groups the media together after i cut a part out , so that i do n't have to manually drag the media over every time i cut in the video . 
  edit : if anyone in the future has this problem , i figured it out . 
  you just hold `` cmd '' or probably ctrl on windows to automatically stitch the clips together . 
  here 's a perfect [ example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjxhugbalzg ) of why team killing is so frustrating , i know it 's nessecary for the `` hardcore playstyle '' but it 's incredibly infuriating when you 're on a streak and a teammate decides you 're having too much fun . 
  so my question to you guys is : how do we fix it ? 
  after years of it being hyped up by various artists and stuff i finally caved and it frankly kinda sucked ... 
  i just felt kinda cozy laying in bed and it wore off in like an hour . 
  do you guys have any similar experiences ? 
  as you guys may have noticed i 'm not very experienced with all this .

  the one i 'm looking at right now is [ this ] ( https://www.expert.no/data-og-tilbehor/kabler-og-tilkobling/nettverkskabler/qnect-cat-6-network-cable-10-m-wh/p-175210/?q=cat-6 ) one , but i 'm not sure if it 's worth it on my `` 5mbps '' internet , any advice on what would be best for me ? 
  i mean , who would n't want to ? 
  the game comes out in less than 20 hours there .

  i do n't know what i did , i was just hitting the different old musical things with the brains in them and it played !, 
  it gives you every perk on the map and could potentially prove/disprove some theories about secret perks . 
  if you can and i 'm just being stupid , anyone wan na tell me how to ?
