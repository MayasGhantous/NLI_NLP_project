  will post video proof soon . 
  so i 'm trying to play custom games 1v1 with a friend and when we get into the game it kicks you as soon as you choose your class , and when the host chooses a class it says `` can not kick host player '', 
  have black ops 3 digital deluxe , far cry 4 , wolfenstein , battlefield 4 ( + premium ) , rocket league , aw season pass , mgsv the phantom pain , goat simulator , trails fusion , the witcher 3 wild hunt , the last of us , outlast , watch dogs , sniper elite 3 and metro redux . 
  will trade anything for fallout 4 . 
  what happens is that i 'm recording , then suddenly the preview of the recording on the gamecapture hd freezes and at this point whatever i do i ca n't seem to get a hold of the clip , when i try to open the file it says `` converting '' for a second then tells me that quicktime ca n't open . mp4s ... 
  [ removed ], 
  i 'm not quite sure why , i 've been playing for like 5 hours now and it just started happening and it 's always right as i spawn . 
  edit : the giant too , error code ( ce-34878-0 ) [ ps4 ], 
  [ removed ], 
  i literally ca n't use any attatchments !, 
  have n't seen it before so i do n't think it 's been posted yet , but when i just pack a punched while i was nikolai he said something in the vein of `` perhaps we ourselves manufactured this device on our previous travels . '', 
  anyone able to shed some light on this ? 
  edit : it 's probably the memory loss , i just got a green gobblegum and he said `` da !, 
  my favourite color !, 
  or is it ? 
  i do n't remember . '', 
  edit 2 : another interesting one : `` i wonder what happened to other nikolai , the one who walked with fools '', 
  edit 3 : another one `` perhaps such firepower will allow us to live long enough to trigger beacon ... 
  wait , what did i say ? '', 
  just started it up and the installing thing in the bottom corner was stuck at 0 % for well into the endurance video . 
  edit : it 's been on since i posted this and it 's at 66 % wtf . 
  edit 2 : fuuuuuuck , i restarted my game and it weny back to 39 %,

  for me it just says `` slots are full 31/31 '' and it does n't give me the option to make a new one even if i do n't have any on that gun . 
  i need a green screen , or otherwise easily keyable effect of the ice staff firing from black ops 2 . 
  just the ice coming out of the staff shooting effect , not the staff itself . 
  [ removed ], 
  so i need some help with recording skype audio , as well as game audio . 
  i know there 's a setup with 3 different linein apps running at the same time , as well as a soundflower thing . 
  what i need is to set it up so it records me , my friend through skype , and my game audio . 
  i use the elgato gamecapture hd software and mac osx . 
  i 've been thinking of getting a blue yeti but i was n't sure if i should get a pop filter or if i can save my money ? 
  edit : i 've decided to get one , thanks for all the help everyone !, 
  so i created a new community challenge that i 'd like everyone to try ( that has probably been done before ) i call it the `` unlimited power challenge '' ( name is a work in progress ), 
  rules :, 
  - you have until round 10 to set up on the giant , in which you can use whatever means you want to set up . 
  - after round 10 you are not allowed to leave the power area and you 're not allowed to open up the door to teleporter c. 
  - you can only leave if you save a crawler , or on dog rounds . 
  you 're not allowed to kill zombies outside the area . 
  that 's pretty much the challenge , you can do it with however many players you want but 2 player is encouraged . 
  if you beat mine and my friends highest round ( 37 ) on 2 player co-op , please post your video in the comments of this post . 
  sorry if this kind of post is against a rule of some sort . 
  edit : lol , sorry for trying to bring something new and fun to this sub instead of the same old `` maybe this brick that 's blue instead of red is a step to the easter egg ? '', 
  i 'm in the very first elevator after i teleported and it 's not moving , any suggestions ? 
  edit : sorry about not tagging the post properly , did n't realize what was classified as a spoiler or not . 
  if i have my laptop closed for 30 minutes then open it and try going to chrome it does n't load anything for at least 2 minutes after i started , everything else works including skype , spotify , safari etc. . . 
  i 'm also on a mac if it 's important .

  so i have this friend who was boasting to me about having black matter , then when i was looking through his stats he had 214 kills with the l-car 9 . 
  is this even possible ? 
  anyone know how he could 've done this . 
  starting to suspect he did n't get that black batter legit . 
  i 've been looking for some x-01 for a few days now , and when googling , it says that the only place that has x-01 is court 35 . 
  but i 've already been there when i was a lower level and took the armor so now the x-01 wo n't spawn . 
  i 'm level 37 . 
  i saw it in the trailer but have n't seen it on the actual map yet .

  one near the mule kick location in one of those circle rooms . 
  one upstairs in the church ( ? ), 
  on the far wall . 
  you need to do this in a specific order , just do each of them until you hear a sound and a character quote . 
  after which you do the next one until you hear the ` error ' sound , then start over going in a different order until all of them make the sound , then go down near the pyramid and the arrow should be there . 
  ** lightning ** : activate the death ray trap , then , using the bow , shoot the wind direction thing on top of one of the tower things right next to you . 
  ** upgrades ** :, 
  ** fire ** : * unknown . 
  ** lightning ** : * unknown . 
  ** wolf thing ** : * unknown . 
  ** knife skull thing ** :,

  then hold square on the urn inside the broken hole/square . 
  ** 2nd step ** : find 6 keeper heads around the map .

  you must pick up the symbols of his name that he says after you shoot the urn the symbols can be found by activating the suits of armors with the respective symbols in the room before the armory . 
  ** part 1 ** : hold square on the switch under the rocket when its about to fire , then go to the panel by the teleporter and wait for all three lights to turn green , activate the console and then get the last piece . 
  ** part 2 ** : activate the death ray then when it 's over use the wundersphere above doubletap when it 's linked to the pad outside the belltower . 
  ( there are also other locations it can spawn but i 'm still working on which pads you need to use ), 
  ** part 3 ** : it drops whenever you kill a panzer soldat . 
  ** upgrade ** : * unknown *, 
  ** notes ** : you do n't need to hold square when picking up parts for the dg-4,
