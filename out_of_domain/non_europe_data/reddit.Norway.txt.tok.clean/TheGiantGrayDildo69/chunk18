  who let the youtube comment section into this thread ? 
  ** this has been patched **, 
  this gif just keeps on giving . 
  i do n't think i 'm gon na buy one because i 'm broke in game and it 's sooooo gon na get nerfed . 
  that 's why the npcs suck at driving in gta , they 're pissing their pants and having siezures . 
  haha , `` stoner '' ... 
  and you need to be on hard difficulty . 
  yes . 
  just finished breaking bad for the second time ... 
  the asian guy is always an asshole to me . 
  haha , i know right . 
  yeah , but i think the enemies are more aggressive or there are more of them or something on hard . 
  you ca n't make this shit up . 
  i do n't think they take kindly to memes . 
  every time someone posts this picture ... 
  / r/heistteams, 
  what about when lester calls me about how well i did on the last one ? 
  i keep doing this but it takes a long time for him to call . 
  i feel like at this point it 's just a joke on the filmmakers part . 
  [ here 's why ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/grandtheftautov/comments/2z0scd/pacific_bank_heist_problem/ ), 
  my group always want it 25/25/25 / 25 ... 
  being leader sucks . 
  those look brown to me but whatever ... 
  i thought i was there for a second . 
  i 'd say probably the prison break , it 's easy if you have a team and you get a lot of money . 
  haha , bet you feel like a jackass now ... 
  not even a single letter ? 
  i 've really been hoping for a while now that that line would come full circle . 
  but if you watch tv in online lazlow has the piercings and does n't have his pony tail ... ? 
  not really an alternate way to complete but a tip for the prison break is not to enter the airspace with the velum before the prisoner/guard is on the airfield ready to be picked up . 
  i agree that they seem more accurate now than before but not with the missiles , more with the cannon . 
  i have n't been having as much of a hard time as you though . 
  it might just be a continuity error , rockstar said that it was before the story mode . 
  me too :p, 
  well , there was some meth in season 2 . 
  well yeah , me and my team did it on time each time but yeah , at least stay out as long as you can and you do n't need to deal with the jets . 
  ( for as long ), 
  and it only has google plus comments . 
  it says this on the tips but i never dared doing it in fear of accidentally killing someone . 
  thanks , i 'll try that :p, 
  you 're the reason . 
  it 's all in the knees . 
  i 'd like to be in your mums tank . 
  wrong car , try the emperor ? 
  yeah , but he does n't have the `` lawyrup '' in the new show . 
  breaking goodman . 
  how about 1k a minute with a max of 10 minutes and for every minute you went off the radar you need to wait 5 more minutes to do it again . 
  sure : ghostmw2awsome , we have 3 people and we 're ready to do any heist . 
  add me : ghostmw2awsome . 
  ghostmw2awsome , add me . 
  same as psn . 
  ghostmw2awsome . 
  zombie bill murray ? 
  4 years ago ... 
  maybe he 'll save them from whatever happenes in the finale ? 
  what do you need me for ? 
  why blame rockstar for your fail ? 
  maybe `` above the law '' ? 
  what 's your psn ? 
  you get a new one everytime you fail to join a mission . 
  i 've noticed a lot that walkers are in situations that would be basically impossible to get in if you were bit or just died . 
  haha ... 
  it 's all good :p, 
  yeah , that 'd be awesome . 
  i had a lot of jams shooting the sr22 , but i suspect that was because of lower quality rounds , how was yours ? 
  might 've been the mag , not sure . 
  it was n't too bad though . 
  i kinda like it , i do n't really see the problem . 
  shane and rick are different , shane 's more impulsive , rick also likes to give people a chance before they cross him . 
  i just realized i really wan na see daryl and carl fuck shit up together . 
  yeah . 
  shane , carl and lori was pretty much all he cared about . 
  what if the wolves are n't the scavengers , and it 's a new arc made for the show ? 
  i just realized , i do n't even think they 've had any lines together . 
  have n't read the comics , but from what i can tell they 've kept everything they copied from the comics basically the same as it was . 
  ( except for dianna ), 
  oh yeah ... that was badass , hope they have more . 
  i only watch videos in 480p anyway so bring on the money !, 
  ^ ^ damn ^ ^ you ^ ^ 3mbps ^ ^ internet !, 
  i thought that was funny the episode after [ ] ( / s `` dale died . '' ), 
  i really ca n't wait to read the comics , i 'm ordering them online this weekend . 
  yeah , i 've spoiled myself for too long , i know too much from the comics and i 'm really excited to get into it for myself . 
  harassed *, 
  ** hi everybody !, 
  well , every cop that sees the criminals either see them die or die themselves . 
  but still though , eugene . 
  i just thought it was too make sure he was dead . 
  i think it 's justified , rick told him not to try anything , he knoked sasha unconcious and ran away to alert the hospital people . 
  then he broke his spine and i 'm assuming that 's not easy to work with in the zombie apocalypse . 
  i thought it was just a small parallel to pete hitting jesse , but it 's still not as bad of a hit as that was . 
  call it new and old gen , eliminates confusion . 
  do you know if you get a money bonus or something for doing all the elite challenges ? 
  for doing ** all ** elite challenges or only for the one heist ? 
  oh , thanks . 
   cat shrine, 
  it 's like a real life internet !, 
  fuck this , it 's raining right now :(, 
  and shoot up heroin . 
  ** alberta represent !, 
  i know a 14 year old who 's 6 ' 2 '' .
