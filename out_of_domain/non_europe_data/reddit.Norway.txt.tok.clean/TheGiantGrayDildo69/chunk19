  i know a 14 yr old who 's 6 ' 2 '' . 
  eeeeeewwwww , low vehicle camera . 
  ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ rape ^ ^ ^ kids . 
  were n't those unspent ? 
  on the covers you see that it 's red . 
  fuck , i know , thanks for telling me in every , single , thread . 
  no , it takes being a shitty driver . 
  also a recent one is `` my experience with heists so far '' or something similar . 
  zombies are being controlled by the moon confirmed . 
   last night mass killings were reported all across the state of north carolina , there are no clear patterns other than that all victims seem to be over 50 years of age . 
  more at 21:00 . 
  6 * whole * marijuanas ?!? 
  hey man , can you post an update of him in like a few months ? 
  i 'd love to see how he looks like 3 months from now . 
  it 's only the names gareth called them in terminus . 
  honestly did n't know what age to put because i knew whatever it was it would offend * someone * . 
  if someones post is literally just `` this game is better on pc '' it 's getting downvoted . 
  it says in the fucking sidebar that it 's not a joke ... 
  how do the herons keep getting in ? 
  why not net them in if they keep getting into the lions cage ... ? 
  are n't they expensive ? 
  it 's right there in the title ... 
  fuck i 'm dumb , i thought they were animals in the zoo ... 
  sorry about everything . 
  i said this on / r/pcmr and got 35 downvotes . 
  what do i select if i only every played ps3 ? 
  we just restarted and just finished the prison break a few minutes ago , it was n't that bad and as far as i can tell everyone has 8/26 . 
  as far as i know all the `` main characters '' in the game , show and comics have called them `` walkers '' but it might be nice to change it up a bit . 
  i 'm not sure but that 'd be great television if someone dies and they 've gone hostile towards ricks group and wont listen to them . 
  yeah , all i 've seen is the show and played season 1 of the game . 
  not sure , think so . 
  updank . 
  yes . 
  sorry , it 's a joke i have with a friend . 
  21k with the hydra , i think it was a chopper , do n't remember though . 
  then what did you learn today ? 
  why would anyone wan na be black ? 
  racism , it goes both ways . 
  matt 's my favourite , he has n't gone has he ? 
  yeah , he 's probably killed people before the apocalypse without hesitation . 
  edit : because he was a cop ... 
  i see your point but as far as morgan knew he just wanted to kill him and nothing more . 
  you wan na post it to youtube or soundcloud or something ? 
  did i just / r/watchpeopledie ? 
  not op but i was in the crew for the run , we used 4 attempts ,, 
  we died because of a undead policeman and lag . 
  we died because of a magic chopper that no one noticed and it blew us up . 
  i suddenly realized on the prison break setup that none of the mastermind progress was being saved even though every one else had theirs . 
  $ 10 mill baby !, 
  by the time we were on the pacific standard on our final run we were all basically hovering over our power buttons in case anyone died but we never had to so i ca n't tell you if it works or not , sorry . 
  me and / u/slywulph got it our first runthrough and our other two crewmates got all in order for this runthrough but already had loyalty . 
  before we finished it i was jealous of every mastermind post i could find , never downvoted them though . 
  yeah , 720p on old gen looks bad , i think they also might 've turned down the graphics in the update . 
  no , i did loyalty and all in order on my first playthrough , just finished mastermind today , it works fine . 
  also on an unrelated note , whoever commented before me is shadowbanned . 
  the first two deaths were on the prison break finale and the humane labs raid - valkyrie respectively . 
  i can help you with ps3 , i 'm up for it again even though i do n't get more money . 
  we never tried the `` resetting '' method but i 'm pretty sure it would work if you did it before it saved . 
  when you 're banned from posting so no one but yourself can see your comments/posts , you do n't get notifyed that you 're shadow banned though , so the only way to tell someone who is shadowbanned is by writing it when it says there are more comments in the thread than you can see . 
  yeah , my mic needs an adapter as well , it really sucks . 
  i think if everyone turns it off before the orange spinny circle finishes it should work . 
  yeah , i have [ this adapter ] ( http://www.amazon.com/islandoffer-345233-sound-card-adaptor/dp/b0044eoqo4/ref=pd_sim_pc_2?ie=utf8&amp;refrid=061zzdasf3eaep1s6nwa ) , it works for my mic but i do n't have any game audio . 
  i 'm hoping to build a half decent pc in the not-too-distant future , but not sure because shit 's expensive yo . 
  i do n't know if they actually did but i know what you mean by it looking more grainier . 
  also if you play a lot of single player that might be why because online graphics are lowered from single player to reduce lag . 
  yeah , it actually happened before we even got into the chopper , we were in kurumas and drove into the merrywether dock and suddenly two of our guys blew up . 
  on an unrelated note , i think we all got some ptsd from doing it , one of our guys ( / u/slywulph ) had a dream the other night where every setup we did somehow a lazer jet spawned in the sky and killed us all . 
  well , a lot of people were at the meeting . 
  the recoil acting in this show is sooo bad . 
  i bought it after doing the mastermind just because , but i 'd reccomend it to no one . 
  add . gifv instead of . jpg and it loads 1,000,000 % faster . 
  sooo many hard resets ... 
  everyone get 10 mil , it 's totally worth it i 'd say if you have the dedication . 
  i 'm actually in op 's crew and when we did it we had a few fails but we eventually got it and i 'm happy we did , now i can afford everything i ever wanted . 
  ^ ^ ^ honestly ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ only ^ ^ ^ have ^ ^ ^ like ^ ^ ^ 1.2 ^ ^ ^ mil ^ ^ ^ left ... 
  i swear to god man , do n't test me , april has n't started yet , this better not be a fucking joke man . . 
  maybe if you did n't wan na get insulted you should n't have told someone that their life is ruined ... 
  i 'm going to but where i live it 's really expensive , i have a friend that spent about $ 2000 on his and it 'll run bf4 ultra at like 70-90 fps . 
  norway ... 
  i should be getting around $ 2000 in not too long plus i 'll be working a summer job from june to august so i 'm looking to spend around $ 2000 - $ 3000 . 
  that 's what i was gon na say , i need a monitor , keyboard , mouse , headset , ect ...

   holy shit here come 's an s !, 
  where 's my fucking apostrophe !, 
  ftfy, 
  i do n't know what it is but the first verse of this song reminds me of breaking bad . 
  itt : rape jokes . 
  oh god , thank you so much . 
  you do n't go far enough to hit the water . 
  no , they need to be on hard . 
  he did use 3 shots though . 
  why does he lean forward a bit before e was shot , was he shot multiple times ? 
  touch\u00e9 . 
  wait , so you 're saying a random guy screamed `` spread your pussy on me '' and you did n't immediatley fuck him ? 
  i need to get a new pick-up line . 
  what does this mean ? 
  yes , there were 3 shots one hit his back , one missed and one hit him in the head .
