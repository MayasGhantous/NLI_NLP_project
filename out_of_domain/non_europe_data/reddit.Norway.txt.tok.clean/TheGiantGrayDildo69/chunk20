  i just realised that we 're all not talking about a video game ... 
  thanks , i 've heard more people say it but never understood . 
  most likely not his brain because he did n't die instantly . 
  the dark knight in the first scene a guy was firing a shotgun , when someone stands up and says that he 's out , then get shot . 
  you might be right but i 'm pretty sure i 've read somewhere that he did n't die before a few hours later at the hospital . 
  edit : `` kennedy was taken to parkland hospital for emergency medical treatment , but pronounced dead at 1:00 pm ; 30 minutes later . '', 
  [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_f._kennedy ), 
  the first one was in the throat . 
  you make mushroom soup ? 
  [ now with 100 % faster loading . 
  steel beams ? 
  edit : a letter . 
  yeah , he was shot in the throat when he was behind the sign , he could n't bend down because he was wearing a back brace so he just tried to lie down but could n't before he was shot again . 
  i did n't , i laughed at some of the earlier ones though . 
  i love the pigs reaction : `` hey , that thing just fell from the sky , wonder if it tastes good . '', 
  hey !, 
  we 're almost the same level !, 
  i 'm 146 . 
  flashbang from cod . 
  i do n't remember that ... ? 
  keep tight formasjon , use the kuruma , eat tons of snacks and use body armour . 
  that explains it , thanks, 
  how the fuck do you neglect that shit ? 
  pretty sure it 's the company that made the game . 
  a woman , with maggots in her eye . 
  this looks like a stock photo . 
  fuck that headband . 
  and she 's alive . 
  pretty sure that goes for everyone . 
  yeah , james franco kinda sucked . 
  that he linked to in the op ... ? 
  is kevin actually a real person from like a reddit post or something or is it just a random name people use for `` stupid person '' . 
  thank you so much . 
  / r/splitdepthgifs, 
  hehe , dinka international competition kit . 
  he might 've thought there was some sort of inside joke that made this scene funnier that he originally thought it was . 
  haha , i 'm `` useless stuff '' . 
  the one that rick shot with a flair when they first met aaron . 
  fuck , when he [ ] ( / s `` was shot , '' ) i had an internal battle as to wether or not [ ] ( / s `` they 'd kill him off . 
  i 've had autism ever since i was little , this time it gave me ebola ... 
  please help my orifices ... 
  i 'm guessing he 's sitting in a helicopter aiming with a sniper , no way the map is that big otherwise . 
  itt : people really mad about being told that they 're wrong . 
  hahaha , what ... ? 
  forgive me if i 'm wrong , i do n't have a pc yet but is n't it better to cap the fps just so that the game is n't so gittery ? 
  how about every time someone says that we just link them to [ this ] ( http://30vs60.com/ ) site or one similar ... ? 
  ** die ** , why are you still alive ? 
  me too . 
  i 've also heard people say that it 's the biggest star . 
  what 's on the disks other than the game ... ? 
  i remember watching a video a long time ago with the guy who did it and he explained but i 'm to lazy to find it sorry . 
  that 's the one . 
  i 've seen the extended version on dvd and i do n't remember that . 
  pinchin ' nurses asses while he 's jacking off with jegens . 
  this is why every time i 'm at the alamo sea i call it `` the eyes '' . 
  speak for youself , click that shit . 
  yes , every heist and setup is needed , as well as for the mastermind . 
  yeah , they had that in gta iv too . 
  i think it might depend on the car to be honest . 
  i 'm assuming i should n't watch the trailer . 
  everyone does n't need to do it , if you get every one in order you get the money , does n't matter who you do it with . 
  the funny part is that it looks like he 's gassing the people in the cage . 
  what the other guy said but my name is ghostmw2awsome . 
  i 'm in . 
  it 's not on the street , he bought it . 
  is this actually a thing ? 
  please be a thing . 
  oh , sorry , i had n't heard of any of it before . 
  release date , the `` deluxe version '' exclusives , the price . 
  thanks , have n't been as `` into '' this game as i should . 
  you 've got it all wrong , you 're the one that has the microsoft .

  also bipolar people would be able to take to experience a normal life . 
  * this * is the reason i do n't watch anime . 
  not me though . 
  i just told you that , like a second ago ... 
  fuck i hate the ai driving in this game . 
  it 's kinda hard to see how much it 's moving because the entire background is white . 
  / r/nocontext ? 
  calling it now , this is the zombie apocalypse start . 
  conclusion : this game looks good when it rains . 
  call of duty : ghosts .

  now that 's horrifying . 
  what the fuck did i just read ... ? 
  sorry , i 'll remove my post .
