  hydra is nice . 
  oh , sorry , i finished the story before any updates came out so i did n't know how it worked . 
  any pictures of the yousif skin ? 
  i think it 's just that it would be hard to have it as detailed using old gen hardware ,, 
  sweet , now my $ 1.75 m ( or whatever it is ) that i spent on my savage is useless . 
  i do n't have it yet but my favourite things are always the new ui features and stuff so i 'm just excited for the patch notes . 
  i wish when you pay $ 10m for a fucking jet , that it would withstand more than a grenade . 
  also , [ here ] ( https://support.rockstargames.com/hc/en-us/articles/205705358-gtav-title-update-1-27-notes-ps4-xbox-one-ps3-xbox-360-pc - ) are the patch notes . 
  thanks , i love reading the patch notes whenever an update goes live . 
  i would 've bought the savage anyway and i 'm actually really excited about the hydra spawning at helipads .

  i think the front is still open . 
  i own an iphone , i just do n't mention it every 5 minutes . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ how ^ to : ^ downvotes . 
  pcmr people outside of the subreddit . 
  i 'm wondering how that 's gon na work but it 's gon na be interesting . 
  fuck , how did you know ? 
  ca n't wait to check it out . 
  only 4 more hours :(, 
  i have 4 hours left and it 's at 5.5 gb but i have really bad internet . 
  more like $ 25m . 
  fuck that , how about only for the kuruma/insurgent or whatever vehicles it was for ? 
  it pisses me off to have to wait to call a vehicle . 
  damn , other than the air vehicles what 's costing so much money ? 
  the same with the savage . 
  my download 's still not finished , i have like 200mbs left :(, 
  i 'm actually not annoyed at all contrary to my original post , i love that you can get the hydra easier now . 
   `` problem is they do n't play in 1080p ( most of the time ) '', 
  actually the ps4 runs almost every game at native 1080p , only ones i can think of that do n't are downgraded to match xbone . 
  ugh , i was looking at some people selling their pcs on a website ( basically norwegian ebay ) and this one guy had dual titans and water cooled cpu and a bunch of amazing specs but played on a 50hz monitor . 
  i do n't mind the ignorance , i just feel sorry for him . 
  i remember him saying it was xbone . 
  well , to be fair , they 're all recorded on xboxes . 
  never had a problem like that with my ps4 on gta . 
  that would explain the wednesday release compared to thursday . 
  does n't fucking matter when they still do it individually . 
  also , how do you prove that ? 
  oh yeah , would n't want fph to get shut down ... 
  i like this one when it 's reversed and the caption `` mrw i see a hot girl '', 
  i actually noticed that yesterday trying to do the end of trashtalk with the hydra . 
  actually , it 's faster than any heli 's . 
  i like to think it 's because you were offended that he 'd think your dad did n't speak english natively . 
  walk around in the plane cabin !, 
  well , it 's not unlike a digital copy of a game . 
  you pay real money and see pixels arrange in a different order than they were before and you feel more satisfied . 
  how did you know ? 
  but i want a cs :(, 
  i 'll need to get some steam gift cards now :(, 
  ... what ? 
  `` my reaction when '', 
  and in the last update it turns into something awesome . 
  i do n't have good enough imagination to tell you what it should be , but that 'd be sweet . 
  i can tell you 're high . 
  [ here you go if you 're wondering about anything else . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_do_all_of_these_acronyms_mean.3f ), 
  haha , that 'd be awesome . 
  i just realized that it ca n't happen in online because sp takes place after online . 
  it was made like 3-4 years ago :p, 
  and that lazlow has his ponytail cut and a bunch of piercings in his face if you watch fame or shame in online . 
  that sucks because unless you 're on ps3 , you 're wasting money on online for an account that 's gon na get banned . 
  edit : oh no , muh meme points :(, 
  click the link . 
  i though we were talking about mods on consoles ... 
  there are mods on consoles . 
  it 's just really low resolution if you 're not using hoverzoom/res . 
  oh , i did n't know , excuse my ignorance . 
  it 's probably not even worth the hype . 
  haha , i watched that movie a few days ago . 
  this post made me unsub from / r/pics, 
  what 's updog ? 
  is it bad that i love ragecomics ? 
  they say that both eyes should n't close at the same time in cartoons , but that fucking creeps me out . 
  oh , i 've heard it looks unnatural when they do . 
  but they 'd notice because no cars ever came beyond the truck ... 
  might just be a weird russian translation . 
  1 year `` did ea do that stupid shit ? '', 
  meme points . 
  i might get it when it 's on sale for $ 110 . 
  speaking of , any news on wd2 ? 
  i feel like i 'm the only one who liked wd . 
  watch dogs , sorry . 
  they 're a rap group called bad meets evil , they had a song on the sslp with the same name that 's amazing . 
  the album is called `` hell : the sequel '' ( a reference to the last line in the bad meets evil song when royce says `` see you in hell for the sequel '' ), 
  just thought if anyone was having trouble finding it or anything , i listen to an excessive amount of eminem . 
  i really like it as a game to just have fun with . 
  i can see how it 'd piss people off paying full price and getting a half-assed yet fun game with a bad pc port . 
  `` i 'm wearin ' visors , sunglasses and disguises , 'cause my split personality is having an identity crisis '', 
  eminem - low , down , dirty, 
  bonus : `` illiterate , illegitimate shit spitter '', 
  poor wallet . 
  hopefully they 'll have gotten all the squeaks out . 
  apparantly , woodpeckers have super hard skulls or something . 
  edit : okay , there 's a difference between sculls and skulls , sorry guys . 
  i do n't speak english on a day-to-day basis although it 's my native language . 
  i really just had a brain fart , usually i can tell if i 've misspelled a word just by looking at it , but on some occasions i just fail miserably . 
  i felt really sorry for wade in that part when trevor said `` i 'm not gon na hit you '' . 
  fucking hate him so much . 
  `` oh , you forgot about simeoooooone ! '', 
  it sucks that in online there 's no difference between 1 and 2 stars . 
  not really .
