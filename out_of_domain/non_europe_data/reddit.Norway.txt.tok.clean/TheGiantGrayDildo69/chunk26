  have n't played it , bought it because of [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/3aggxf/til_steam_sales_i_dont_even_have_a_pc/cscm42t ), 
  the top guy was n't that bad but the bottom guy was out of line . 
  literally hitler . 
  i thought the `` my gpu is melting '' part was the lan horror story . 
  [ woah , `` me , in real life '' is almost like `` me irl '' . 
  related to robert mcnamara ? 
  i feel weird/dirty all the time . 
  whole *, 
  sure it does * . 
  * / u/thecraffey, 
  bought it because of this comment , playing the first mission now . 
  edit : so , there was a woman running at me , and i shot her . 
  i do n't know why , i do n't think she was trying to kill me , but now she 's dead . 
  edit 2 : hold me ... 
  i agree with your poing but who rents games ? 
  it 's kinda the point that you 're not supposed to copy-paste the adress because it 's to see if you spell it different . 
  interesting . 
  oh , i guess it 's just it 's not that common where i live . 
  that 's pretty awesome . 
  done in a custom job ? 
  cool . 
  edit : that was n't sarcasm , jesus guys . 
  i would n't even know where to rent a game . 
  not a whole lot of hyvee 's or walgreens where i live . 
  still would be interesting though . 
  not really shitty , but incredibly accurate . 
  i play through any game in a single sitting . 
  if this comes out i 'll buy the shark cards to pay for it as well . 
  do n't think so . 
  i have 400 cars and 400 guitars . 
  thank you for subscribing to puss in boots facts , ( too lazy to add the rest ), 
  should 've had the lifeboat be a ( n ? ), 
  ssd . 
  honestly , it 's horrible to say it but hitler kinda did good because there would be a lot more retarded people in europe if he did n't do what he did . 
  ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ really ^ ^ ^ sorry . 
  this is one of my biggest insecurities , i 'm horrified to find out what my friends actually think of me but i 'm still curious . 
  his pants definitely have a mark .

   `` make sure it was just one of the capillaries there that burst with an extra large poo . '', 
  thought it said `` caterpillars '' ... oh god . 
  in one of the videos in this thread one of the women looked kinda messed up , might just be a really bad infection or something though . 
  that one scene in `` the temple of doom '' . 
  thanks . 
  probably still not a whole lot worse than just smoking a normal cigarette . 
  not sure why but it reminds me more of the tbogt music than the gta v. 
  edit : now that i think about it i do n't even remember the gta v music . 
  i 'm not racist my president said it once . '', 
  loonee and tonee . 
  your moms place, 
  are they checking his pulse ... ? 
  i like how if you mention you get downvoted for something you immediately get downvoted,

   `` blow up '', 
  i think we have different definitions bro . 
  edit : congrats , 2k + has reached my definition of `` blow up '' , good job . 
  well , the picture does have to be downsized to fit in my screen so it 's not like it 's hard to notice . 
  but how do you pay respects ? 
  haha , someone has it in for this whole thread . 
  but you press f to swap folding knife with bong : ? 
  the most powerful weapon i 've shot is a 12 gauge magnum slug . 
  i 'm so jealous right now . 
  this is kinda hilarious , i hope to see more in the future . 
  might be obvious , but in case you could n't tell , but it 's a parody . 
  `` i do n't know what he 's saying but i 'll get mad at him because he might be saying consoles are holding pc back . '', 
  - pcmr, 
  when ? 
  thanks . 
  me too , but i mean if someone does n't like that then they have to realize that everyone gets into battlerap somehow . 
  i 'm tempted to buy it anyways , it 'd be nice to get it for free :p, 
  i 'm down . 
  downloading carrier now . 
  i 'd consider myself decent at exo-zombies and although i do n't know the easter egg i could familiarize myself with it . 
  hey man , fuck you , not because you 're hot . 
  ghostmw2awsome , i also have 2 more friends that could join in a few days if you do n't get any more people . 
  ( side note , awesome is spelt wrong in my name , spell it exactly like i wrote it above ), 
  i still have 10 fireworks , i stocked up on them last year and never placed them down . 
  have any proof ? 
  nice try , america . 
  i do n't mean to be all `` pcmr '' , but minecraft on consoles just sucks completely . 
  ^ ^ ^ coming ^ ^ ^ from ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ps3 ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ps4 ^ ^ ^ owner , ^ ^ ^ please ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ hate ^ ^ ^ me, 
  god .

  i did n't compare rone to thesaurus and pat stay , but i do know that there 's still a lot to learn , thanks for the recommendations . 
  i feel like you 're either french or australian :p, 
  the house looks different on the inside , the window and door are off compared to the outside view . 
  * twitch *, 
  everyone from the us that had it died so we do n't care that it 's still in some african countries . 
  that girly crouch though , what 's he doing ? 
  i like how you got gold which only continues to support reddit . 
  ca n't tell if you 're serious . 
  i bought it because someone on this sub said i should and i had n't heard of it before but i have n't tried it yet . 
  but what exactly is so bad about it ? 
  how do you overclock a monitor ? 
  i 'm actually just asking for a friend as i do n't have a pc myself , i told him to overclock and he had no idea . 
  did you even play gta 4 ?
