  i could link you proof that they 're fake but i 'm not sure if i 'd get banned from the sub . 
  okay , thanks , happy i did n't post them then :p, 
  i live in norway and you 're lucky if you get a burger and some drink for under 20 dollars ( 100 norwegian krone ), 
  it 's a picture that specifically states the actual source and how it 's not her . 
  why is the iced capp so damn good !?!? 
  also how much does science have to evolve before we can get timmies here in norway ? 
  cool , where do you live ? 
  edit : i mean country , i 'm not coming to visit , just wondering what kind of host you 'll have . 
  cool , i 'll add you tomorrow morning . 
  ( it 's late where i live ), 
  i can add you , but i do n't have a mic , you got skype ? 
  ahhh , the 2 best types of candy ... :(, 
  haha , holy shit , i got so many replies on this thread , damn ... :p, 
  aww , they 're all cute , sorry to be a bummer but this is [ mine ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ip6c1 ) , he passed away a few weeks ago , miss him so much . 
  edit : ( sorry about my username ), 
  his name was leo ( apparantly a fairly common name for bengals ) he was a bengal , thanks  he was very quirky and weird , he died from heart failure , he had a irregular heartbeat from birth , i 'm pretty sure he was inbred because bengals are worth $ 1250 to $ 1870 where i live . 
  thank you , 
  thanks , 
  thanks , was going to post this on the sub but did n't because of the whole `` no dead pets '' rule . 
  thank you , so sorry to hear about yours , do you have any pictures ? 
  aww , they 're all really pretty , i also have 2 cats that live in canada with my dad ( i live in norway ) , i do n't have too many pictures of them but i have a pretty good one i took this summer of my buddy [ greycat ] ( http://imgur.com/siy0kke ) , i 've had him since i was a little kid and he just turned 13 . , 
  he 's a cool guy , very cuddly , and when we shave him he 's also very energetic . 
  i just read that `` a man can cream '' and i was like , `` well ... '', 
  might mean if you 're dependent you ca n't sleep without it ? 
  ( just trying to make some sence out of this ... ) :p, 
  i do n't know man ... 
  dependency so you need weed as a sleeping aid ? 
  edit : ( sorry if you were being serious , i kinda assumed you were being sarcastic . ), 
  oh , cool , sorry , i totally thought you were being sarcastic ... :p, 
  do n't know why anyone else mentioned yet but sorry too hear about your friend . 
  good luck with the future , and moving on , i bet it 's been a hard month , how did she pass ? 
  ( sorry if that question was too personal , and about the username , i really should get a new one ), 
  i 'm not sure if it 's that i 'm not easily offended or that i 'm just really really good at concealing that i 'm being offended . 
  aww , that 's tough , sorry again for your loss . 
  damn , i could do without knowing that my sister has a dildo and my mom has a vibrator ... 
  ahhhhrgh !, 
  why ca n't we have more weed in norway !, 
  gaming , between getting new games , to consoles , to eventually building a pc , damn . 
  also since games constantly keep coming out you have to spend more money on more games all the time . 
  draw meeee !, 
  not sure if this is against the rules but i could share all the dlcs with you , add me on skype/psn : ghostmw2awsome, 
  no it 's not . 
  oh , haha , sorry , it 's 3:30 am right now , i 'm slow . 
  g'day to you sir !, 
  it 's a lot better to be the fly on a wall , it 's only like a few hours ^ ? 
  also the jelly would be really bad for you . 
  ( sugar , no protein what so ever , you would be really tired and feel like shit all the time ), 
  the other day my crush raged when her computer was n't working at school , the frustration frightened me slightly . 
  okay , sorry . 
  i think it 's faster to list what i do n't know than what i do . 
  slim shady lp : everything except some of `` as the world turns '' and `` if i had '' . 
  marshall mathers lp : everything except `` amityville '' . 
  the eminem show : `` business '' , `` cleanin ' out my closet '' , `` drips '' , `` without me '' , `` sing for the moment '' , `` superman '' , `` hailie 's song '' , '' 'till i collapse '' and `` my dad 's gone crazy '' . 
  encore : `` evil deeds '' , `` never enough '' , `` like toy soldiers '' , `` puke '' , `` rain man '' , `` just lose it '' , `` ass like that '' , `` mockingbird '' , `` crazy in love '' , `` one shot 2 shot '' and `` encore/curtains down '' . 
  curtain call : `` fack '' , `` lose yourself '' , `` shake that '' . 
  relapse/refill : `` 3 a.m. '' , `` my mom '' , `` insane '' , `` hello '' , `` we made you '' , `` old time 's sake '' , `` d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu '' , `` beautiful '' , `` crack a bottle '' , `` elevator '' , `` my darling '' and `` careful what you wish for '' . 
  recovery : `` on fire '' , `` wo n't back down '' , `` not afraid '' , `` space bound '' , `` 25 to life '' , `` so bad '' , `` love the way you lie '' and `` untitled/you do n't own me '' . ^ ( ( and i just realised how good it was yesterday and now i 'm in the process of learning `` cold wind blows '' . ) ), 
  marshall mathers lp 2 : everything except `` legacy '' , `` stronger than i was '' , `` desperation '' and `` beautiful pain '' . 
  i also know `` guts over fear '' . 
  note : relapse ^ ( ( not including refill ) ) is the most underrated eminem album because of his accent , it has really good lyrics and flow on many songs . 
  that sounds suprisingly accurate ... 
  video 'll be up in a few hours . 
  when i was younger i used to get a split stream from my foreskin sticking on the middle .

  a new meme !, 
  i think this guy could go really big , but the beat on this song is kinda boring , would it be possible for someone to put a different beat on ? 
  it 's not a camera , it says '' [ 10 ] '', 
  can someone reply to me when op delivers ? 
  i 'm going to bed ... 
  thanks man , 
  ahhh , yes !, 
  it 's sad that a lot of women think these are * bad * characteristics . 
  who decided that prostate exams should n't be called * analysations * .
