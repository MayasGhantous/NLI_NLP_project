  e : i guess not . 
  you tried ... 
  and for some reason they still have shitty cgi . 
  lmao , that 's me :p, 
   a money-making ` roo, 
  ( that format being the snappy editing and things like that compared to more long form commentaries and lets-plays ), 
  i got it on mine as well , i think it 's because there 's no one talking in the video that 's on the screen at the same time ( probably ) and youtube are like `` hey , nothing 's happening on screen in sync with these words , something might be wrong ! '', 
  oh man , thanks , and sorry . 
  can someone explain what 's so creepy about it ? 
  i 've seen it a few times before and ca n't really see why people find it so creepy . 
  wan na explain what went down ? 
  jolly ranchers :p, 
  mine 's jolly rancher . 
  glad i could help , 
  if you ever facepalm at someone saying something stupid like `` titanic was real ?!, 
  '' , remember this moment . 
  wait really ? 
  i 've always thought that that seemed like a stupid plan in heist movies but that sounds amazing . 
  thanks for the info . 
  i did n't know that the word `` cybercunts '' is actually the oldest word still in use . 
  i see what you mean , did n't mean to come off as a dick and i 'm really sorry . 
  fair point , i assumed so because they were using an xbox controller but it 's entirely possible that it was on pc . 
  oh , alright . 
  that seems very probable . 
  there was one time though on the roosterteeth video where the framerate dropped and i noted that it was probably because it was on xbox, 
  tpb does n't work for me for some reason , i think my isp blocked it or something . 
  i know it does n't feel like this but because of the way the brain works i 'm almost certain that it was only one night and it just felt like the whole week . 
  i 'm downloading some now , hopefully it 'll yield results . 
  oh really ? 
  damn that 's interesting . 
  shit that late ? 
  it 's gon na take me like 4 hours to download the beta as well , guess i 'll get some energy drinks then ... 
  well , it 's probably gon na be out by the time i 'm going to sleep so i 'll stay up late playing it instead . 
  do you need to have it as your primary ps4 account ? 
  edit : i think it does , downloading now . 
  guess that 's why they call it window pain . 
  my internet on my ps4 is about 50 % of my normal speed so it 's not that big of a difference . 
  i was just about to do that lol , i was gon na check reddit one last time then go to the store :p, 
  yeah , but so is my internet and it would 've helped me a lot to pre-load . 
  4 hours left ... :(, 
  it does n't have anything to do with the console , it 's that i have unbelivably shitty internet and pre-loading would 've given me much more playtime . 
  lmao yeah , it had like 7 hours left when it started , i made an australian account so i could download it earlier . 
  lmao , it 's been in rest mode since i posted this and it now has 91 minutes left . 
  i downloaded it from the australian store but i 've heard that you need to go to the standard edition of the game and it 'll be in the dlcs section . 
  ( for other places than au ), 
  not sure if this 'll work but try going to the `` dlcs '' section of the standard edition of the game . 
  that sucks , hopefully you 'll get in soon . 
  it 's at 87 minutes now and i do n't wan na accidentally make it like 3 hours or something , i 'm heading out for about half an hour anyway so it 's cool . 
  doing a speed test now ... 
  my download was 1.71 mbps and my upload was 0.38 mbps ( with the download on so it was pulling it down a bit ), 
  but on ps4 it 's usually around 400-600 kbps . 
  i 'll try it thanks . 
  edit : it increased the time left by like 3 minutes , oh well :(, 
  i think it 's on the `` dlcs '' section of the full game . 
  not sure , i 'm actually located in norway but i saw a bunch of threads about how it was on the au store so i made a new psn . 
  oh , not sure then sorry . 
  i think it might be in the `` dlcs '' section of the pre-order page .

  it 's down to 30 minutes now ... * teeth grinding *, 
  oh yeah , good idea . 
  i 'm gon na go get myself a $ 1000 pc to play this one game . 
  that sucks , no problem though . 
  a friend of mine that lives in the us said it would be out on the hour now so you should try reloading the site in a few minutes . 
  if you 're really desperate you could do what i did which is make an australian psn and download it from there . 
  just a smidge . 
  this made me laugh an unreasonable amount . 
  up top . 
  it 's extremely expencive where i live , a friend of mine spent nearly $ 1200 on a pc and he runs bf4 at ultra at an average of 55 fps . 
  lmao yeah , that survival mode was wayyy to easy . 
  please google `` john cena prank call '' . 
  it 's the best thing ever and i 'm assuming you have n't seen it yet . 
  he actually posts to rap genius and it seems to actually be him . 
  i do n't think he 's as clueless as he seems . 
  i just meant for the beta but yeah . 
  what ... ? 
  maybe it 's something to do with the esrb , like there 's a max of 20 pixles per nipple or something ... [ 7 ], 
  i 'm just gon na double check . 
  just to be sure . 
  woah , is n't that a bit too much ? 
  i swear to fuck if he fucking fails at the very end i will murder . 
  edit : nvm, 
  oh right , i was trying to remember when there were strippers in walking dead . 
  the cat starts kicking , then notices that it 's being kicked in the face and starts kicking in self defence . 
  lmao , what 's that . 
  we 'd never know , probably happens more than you 's think . 
  wow , i thought it was from the movie . 
  that 's insane . 
  lmao , is that syndicate 's video ? 
  is the gameplay actually console or is it pc ? 
  oh interesting , thanks . 
  but ken m though . 
  uhh , people who want to drag race ... ? 
  i only downvote if it 's unrelevant to the sub . 
  no , i 've noticed over the course of the last few months how many of those posts there are and it annoys me . 
  maybe i will, 
  i 'm not sure what happened .
