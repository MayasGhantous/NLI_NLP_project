  `` yup , that 's a knife '', 
  a friend of mine said `` guys speaking swedish '', 
  gta iv had a pretty good `` dynamic ai '' , like police arresting people if they ran over them and whatnow . 
  i literally just watched a video i made with my friend and decided to go on reddit to cool down . 
  my dad 's an alcoholic ... 
  like otis ? 
  yeah , everyone 's been complaining about how season 2 was boring , but as someone who binged through it recently for the first time , i liked . 
  also i did n't really dislike lori , do n't know why everyone did . 
  what if i live in norway , how does that go ? 
  i ca n't view the link , could someone tell me what it says ? 
  rip in kill, 
  i 've seen this reposted on this sub 3 times in the last 3 days ... 
  and 2 versions in first person ... 
   rapists r us, 
  thanks , hilarious . 
  i missed it , when ? 
  oh , thanks , thought so . 
  oh well , i 'll just wait then ... 
  i 'd walk up and casually ask for an autograph , trying not to bother him . 
  it does n't work on anything but the us spotify as far as i know ... 
  thanks , but i 'll need an american adress to do so ; does it work with a canadian adress ? 
  i have a lot of family there . 
  not sure , sorry , i could send you a message when it 's avaliable for me in norway . 
  the only thing is that spotify does n't work on my school wifi , so i ca n't check at the moment . 
  oh shit , i do n't know , thanks . 
  deleted , did n't feel like messing with it . 
  maybe later . 
  but he 's in every episode , and they 'd have to have it look exactly the same every episode . 
  wow man !, 
  spoiler alert !!, 
  magneto confirmed for the msf . 
  especially s1, 
  season 2 was n't that bad , and neither was lori . 
  yeah , i realised that after i wrote the other post , thanks . 
  it might just be better to me because i binged it , it was slower than the other seasons though . 
  it 's there now for me . 
  [ norway ], 
  it 's pissin me off that it 's in the wrong order . 
  okay , yeah , i see that now , sorry . 
  okay , cool , thanks .
