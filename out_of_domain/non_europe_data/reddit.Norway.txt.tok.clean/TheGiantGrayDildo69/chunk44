  `` i do n't even know who you are ! '', 
  ( in reference to maxis ) - richtofen, 
  `` this machine has been everywhere i 've been . 
  france , germany , brazil '' ( in reference to the pap machine ) - dempsey, 
  damn , i wanted to have a discussion about this but everyone is just talking about incest . 
  it had always been his dream , he could n't go out before he had broken that last move . 
  ugh , why does everyone insist on shooting the shadow man that many times ? 
  good strategy nonetheless . 
  think about the children !, 
  ^ ^ that ^ ^ might ^ ^ be ^ ^ in ^ ^ the ^ ^ same ^ ^ room ^ ^ as ^ ^ you ^ ^ and ^ ^ see ^ ^ the ^ ^ word ^ ^ `` shotgun '', 
  oh right no nazis , i did n't think much of that other than not wanting germany to get mad at them . 
  tada, 
  that 's what i figured but i was on a 4 bar all game so that 's why i was confused . 
  yeah , i need to get used to hitting ^ when i get trapped . 
  yeah , it happened too fast though and did n't realize i did n't actually shoot until i had posted this gif . 
  haha , he 's such a cute asshole . 
  [ * wiggling intensifies * ], 
  because you touch yourself at night . 
  that 's funny , it reminds of a kid i heard in a gamestop the other day . 
  kid : `` dad , is that a real bomb ? '', 
  * pointing at anthalogy *, 
  dad : `` no , it 's not ... '', 
  kid : `` well then why would it be 18 + if it was n't real ? '', 
  cashier : `` it 's 18 + because it has lots of blood and violence '', 
  kid : `` it 's a game ? 
  how do you fit that in your disk tray ? '', 
  i really hope the dad was getting his kid mario kart or something . 
  but why even switch the arm when you 're already re-using the animation . 
  i think i 'll make a new post when i prestige . 
  yeah wow , not sure what 's up with that , i got a 44 on soe so that might be why . 
  yes , you can chose any gobblegum or gun and you keep attachments and camos for guns you unlocked before . 
  the giant does n't have any achivements . 
  haha , that 's amazing . 
  yes , every mega you had before is still usable at any time after you prestige . 
  you 'll keep the level , but if you do n't use the unlock token you 'll need to get to level 16 again to change the attatchments ( i have n't played another game yet but it 's previewing all my guns with camos and attatchments ), 
  e : they all seem to have the same attachments as i have on my hvk ( the weapon i unlocked ) . 
  even my custom paintshop camo . 
  i 've used 0 double xp , and have played a pretty even mix of solo and multiplayer , although i think you level up faster on solo . 
  my highest rounds so far are 29 on the giant ( although i 'm pretty sure i got 30 + the leaderboard is saying 29 ) and 44 for shadows of evil and i think both of those helped a lot with leveling up . 
  oh , no , they have they 're the same as before where you need to unlock them in the factory . 
  really ? 
  usually dlc achivements have different categories on the ps4 and there 's none for the giant meaning that if there is one for that map you 'd need to buy a dlc map to platinum the game . 
  25 hours 46 minutes and 10 seconds, 
  i do n't really think i got anything , except for a calling card for finishing level 35 but i guess i lost it again or something ... ? 
  i 'm going for master prestige to see if you can get this , anyone know what master prestige is ? 
  10 like multiplayer ? 
  does n't seem like it idk 3300 xp for level 1 . 
  nope  not sure about unlocks , i think i might 've gotten free red hex on all weapons , my game might just be glitched though . 
  yes, 
  not sure but i think you get it from spending points . 
  yeah , i do n't think anything , i 'm gon na go for master though because i wan na see what you get . 
  not sure , i 've played a mix between solo and with friends , but a round 30 , round 38 and 44 might 've helped along the way . 
  i have about 30 hours of playtime . 
  you need to get 60k xp . 
  yeah , i 'll post the next one when i hit 2nd prestige . 
  do n't remember , danger closest , anywhere but here and i do n't remember the rest . 
  possibly and hopefully . 
  oh , soe is jugg , speed , qr , and widows wine ( stamin-up when qr runs out ) the giant is the same but - widows wine and + double tap, 
  oh that 's funny , i really want to get that . 
  just shows up like that randomly after you 've played the giant . 
  [ here 's my round 44 , i 've got op beat . 
  [ i know it 's a custom game , still surprised myself with this . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt3alg63ehg ), 
  yeah i know , i 'm bad though and i was super hyped when i hit it :p, 
  haha , really ? 
  hopefully it wo n't take too much longer , seeing as how i have school the entire week . 
  do n't think so , it said that it would be `` as if i 've never played zombies at all . 
  it 's the gun you have , in my case it was the locus . 
  it just shoots at all the zombies . 
  yup , hopefully i 'll hit master around christmas . 
  ( very wishful estimate ), 
  either this shotgun if very weak or i am . 
  this downed me in my round 38 game and happened to me twice in my 44 game . 
  eh , i think it 's bullshit . 
  i had around 15k kills when i hit prestige 1 , might be possible to get it down to like 50k but you 'd need to get like round 40 + each game , and if this guy got the game early he 'd have to get the learning curve to soe down extremely fast which i 'd say is unlikely . 
  do n't think there is an achivement on the giant . 
  as i ( rather terribly ) explained yesterday , basically on the ps4 achivements there 's no special section for dlcs ( the giant ) meaning that if you want to get platinum you ** have ** to get a dlc map which would be bullshit . 
  sorry but : https://www.reddit.com/r/codzombies/comments/3s7ak4/ultra_secret_achievements_in_back_of_collectors/cwv4jmb, 
  it 's not really * tink * more like * cschunk *, 
  it 's a thing on old gen & / pc . 
  y' all fuckers called me crazy , stupid , ignorant . 
  but now it 's come out that i 'm still all those things , but also right !, 
  there was a post about it yesterday , [ here 's the picture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mqsptrg.png ) ( sp00ks warning ), 
  although i do n't specifially know , i think with the amount of features old gen consoles are missing , ( campaing for gods sake ) i think it 's safe to say that there 's no theater ( in zombies at least ), 
  but shadows of evil is n't hard , there 's a difference between learning curve and difficulty . 
  having a map be harder would n't fix the problem of pap being hard to get and it 's not really that bad because you can get double tap . 
  also pack a punching is n't as essential in zombies as you make it seem . 
  i swear you 're the luckiest fucker in the world , carpenters and nothingness for me . 
  nope , you can get it from the pods though . 
  yeah it looks amazing . 
  oh , i was n't paying * too * close attention , i 'll look at my video ( also just noticed that i forgot to update my post description ), 
  yeah , the plane has to be something other than a reference , someone wan na get on with me in like 6ish hours on ps4 to look for stuff ? 
  i 'm not very good at finding easter eggs on my own so i 'd like to see if some combined minds could figure something out . 
  lol , you can watch syndicate 's guide , it 's like 10 minutes ( 5 if you scrub through it ) and he gets all the rituals . 
  yeah , it 's extremely good so that 's nice . 
  oh wow , i just realized how much i 'd judge people if there were profile pictures on reddit . 
  yes you lose them as soon as you grab them from the gumball machine ( not sure if you let it disappear ), 
  holy shit we did it reddit !, 
  dude , i 'd totally do that . 
  i bet you have to be of age though lmao .
