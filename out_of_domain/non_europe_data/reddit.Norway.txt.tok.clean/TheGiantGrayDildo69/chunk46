  dragged them together because my editing software hates me . 
  started making individual transition when after i was about 40 % done i realized that it was useless and i did n't need transitions . 
  finally finished them and rendered the video , uploaded it to youtube and gfycat . 
  guysssss , i 'll be home soon . 
  that hurts , chris . 
  what about reddit and getting driven ? 
  made a gif of all of them if you do n't feel like looking through all the pictures , [ here 's ] ( https://gfycat.com/adeptcoldhoneyeater ) the gfy , and [ here 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imwqqjqikpg ) the youtube link, 
  damn that 's amazing . 
  yeah , treyarch need to fix a few things in their game , i 've prestiged and because of the prestige glitch it 's nearly unplayable . 
  [ original post .

  yup , i know how to do a lot of things , just not efficiently . 
  fuck , please be true !, 
  damn , i was gon na do that but i thought no one would care so i scrapped it :(, 
  heh , * hard * work . 
  we 've found 2 lightning/grenade spots , only one more and we 've got an easter egg on our hands . 
  idk man , missouri is kinda a state . 
  it 's happened to everyone who 's prestiged , congratulations . 
  yeah , i think it 's a dynamic lighting glitch . 
  monkey bomb by the fly trap . 
  ca n't tell if you 're making fun of me or just this sub in general . 
  that 's why skateboarding more that like 10 km/h is a fuck no for me . 
  black ops 3 ( not kidding ) just because i 've waited too long for a decent zombies game . 
  ( also excited to get fallout and just cause ), 
  idk what `` gr\u00f6ten '' means but i 'm laughing anyways . 
  unless you 're on pc i do n't think there is , do n't think there 's any use prestiging really though . 
  what system are you on and what build does it say you 're on ? 
  yeah , i 've just stopped though because i do n't feel like having the game crash , even though it does n't happen all the time . 
  ah damn , hope it comes out on console soon , i heard it was fixed on pc . 
  yeah , similar things have happened to me a few times after 24-36 hours without sleep , like one time i saw a text i had sent a friend and thought one of my friends took my phone and sent it , only to notice that i had 2 more texts sent at the same time that i remembered . 
  yeah , i just wan na get new dots and stuff for my sights , i know `` unplayable '' was a huge exaggeration but it 's still really annoying . 
  well , he said `` previous travels '' which is wierd that he would n't remember , i guess it 's the whole `` 115 messes with your memories '' thing . 
  not for consoles , i 've heard mixed reports from pc users . 
  interesting . 
  hopefully there 'll be one now soon , the hotfixes usually come out in around an hour . 
  `` france , brazil , the freaking moon ! '', 
  yeah , there 's something up i think , i always loved the pap quotes , like dempsey on ascension ; `` damn , this is like waiting for the midnight release ! '', 
  honestly , after doing youtube for a while ( not making a lot but more as a hobby ) it 'd be amazing to be able to call it your job , it 's so much fun and it 's really only about 25 % actual gaming which keeps it from getting old . 
  i got 2 in one hit once , got super excited . 
  one guy said he got 4 in one hit the first day it was out but i 'm pretty sure he was bullshitting . 
  yeah , [ found it in case you or anyone else wanted to see it .

  right , not sure what 's up with all this , hopefully we 'll get answers in dlc . 
  that 's not the same thing i 'm talking about , what i 'm talking about is when you attatch something ( a sight or something ) to say the hvk , then every weapon will get the same attachment , and seeing as how every weapon ca n't equip sights , it sometimes crashes your game when you try to start a match . 
  i belive you , at first i did n't think about it too much because i did n't realize you could get more than 3 different ones at the same time . 
  and were we supposed to feel suspence when daryl could n't get his crossbow out of that bag ? 
  my thoughts exactly , it was just a stupid scene and the suspenseful music just made it laughable . 
  when i was about 10 or 11 i once brought one of my toy guns ( without an orange tip ) to the line in security before pointing it out to my mom . 
  she just put it in the garbage can and silently forgot about it . 
  as well as the fact that the zombie was walking at the same speed as a drunk , withdrawing heroin addict . 
  yeah , it 's like the sentrifuge on ascension , when you try standing up it makes you crouch automatically . 
  yeah , probably the biggest problem with bo3 zombies is that it 's not attracting more new players because you ca n't casually play a game anymore , and the rituals on soe are horrible for new players who do n't know about zombies . 
  yeah , [ this ] ( https://gfycat.com/speedyflawedfruitbat ) is a good example of that , you ca n't really tell from the gif but i was legging it the entire time the zombie was hitting me there . 
  i also got 2 earlier on a 2 vats , might upload video later . 
  i also got 41 earlier today !, 
  almost beat my pr . 
  sorry , i posted this at 3am last night and went to bed , for anyone confused this is part of a log in keeping where i post the prestige icon and my current stats every time i prestige . 
  look at my comment further down , did n't mean for this to be as confusing as it is . 
  [ whoops ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/codzombies/comments/3t8oi6/so_yeah/cx4avuc ), 
  haha , i watched that movie the other day . 
  yeah , i love daryl do n't get me wrong but i kinda hope they have the balls to kill him off . 
  you * can * take it back off ... 
  but they 're so easy ... ? 
  yeah , i do n't get why they 've fixed monkeys and the prestige glitch on pc but not consoles . 
   i hope infinity ward makes another . 
  first time i 've heard that in * any * context . 
  `` personal record '' , no problem , i was n't sure how many people would get it . 
  alright , that makes sense . 
  yeah i know , i 'm going to make a new one , just whipped that one up in 10 minutes because i wanted something . 
  haha , you 'll get better with time , it 's not too bad once you get used to it . 
  yeah , i was going for 50 this game , at least wanted to beat my 44 . 
  mostly rift but i 'll deviate to pap room if nessecary . 
  yeah , it 's the same as going down on co-op minus the qr . 
  someone told me to keep updating on the prestige emblems when i do . 
  that 's weird , mine 's actually 44 but this is just what i got yesterday , but on the same note i 've noticed the same on the giant at round 39 . 
  vondy said they did n't wan na do launch weekend because it would misrepresent the feel of the game . 
  oh yeah , you 're always above me on the leaderboards :p, 
  i 'm down whenever, 
  i was laughing my ass off , i do n't think my friends were too pleased . . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85vwr7ddkg ), 
  post a video reaction !, 
  ah yeah , i could see myself doing that . 
  oh man , mr moleman needs to get me some double xp . 
  edit : really random inside joke , disregard . 
  it 's a glitch , it 's your players arms , a misrender . 
  yeah , this was after our 2nd ritual , still not too pleased . 
  me too lol , my pr is 44 but i 'm also gon na try getting 50 this weekend ( x2 xp ftw ) i died in this specific game because i was being stupid and tried upgrading the sword mid-round . 
  who 's to say they were gon na add this without the community suggestions ? 
  slightly off topic but a nice feature would be , when hovering over a tire smoke , your character started spinning the wheels so you can actually see what it looks like before you spend 20k on one . 
  off topic but does anyone have that clip from earlier today ( maybe yesterday ) that i think the mods removed , a clip of that one scene ? 
  yeah , and like i said in a different thread , that fucking scene with daryl when he could n't get his crossbow out of the bag ... really ? 
  * fell *, 
  i saw tons of people who wanted at least the hunter , hydra and a huey . 
  i was laughing my ass off , my friends felt a bit different about it . 
  play zombies , it might not be for everyone but most people that like it , * love * it . 
  fuck , just got fallout yesterday : s, 
  but if you do you get quad xp . 
  yeah , black ops 3 , just cause 3 and fallout will probably last me until next november . 
  yeah , the fallout 4 route is definetley better . 
  it 'll be out next year !,
