  well , in 4 years for pc but still . 
  redwood i think . 
   `` you will , and you will melt '', 
  quote of the year . 
  it 's been that way for previous cods so presumably yes . 
  ** above comment **, 
  you too , thanks !, 
  just play solo then , a lot more fun in my opinion . 
  it was a joke about how gta v took 2 years to come out on pc after it 's initial release . 
  would n't get nearly as many upvotes as a text post . 
  as much as i love the john cena joke i doubt it 'll still be upvoted in december of next year . 
  have they fixed the prestige glitch ? 
  yeah , wish i could get a double xp code where i live because 400xp per kill sounds insane . 
  i know , my hype train has reached maximum velocity . 
  pretty legit theory . 
  wow . 
  rickrolling is [ timeless ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqw4w9wgxcq ) though . 
  yeah but it just became popular again a few months ago . 
  yeah , so far from supplydrops i 've gotten mr6 camos , gorgon camos and the burst sniper camos . 
  i have every mega gobblegum , might not be as impressive as i thought it was . 
  oh damn , that 's definitely not intentional . 
  i 've gotten a total of 5 so far #blessed, 
  my install has been on for about 15 hours and it 's at 75 %, 
  i tried restarting it earlier at 77 % and it reset to 39 % and i 'm basically watching it in hopes that my stare will make it go faster . 
  yeah , i 've gotten 5 so far :p, 
  quick breakdown if you do n't know how dr. monty 's works , i used 2 liquid diviniums ( 2 vats ) which gives me the contents of the first 2 thingies , secondly , i got perkaholic in the first one ( ultra rare gobblegum ) and a doubler in the second one giving me 2 perkaholic gobblegums ( extremely rare and useful ), 
  hope this wans n't too confusing to follow and excuse the formatting , i 'm on my phone . 
  oh , perkaholic gives you every perk on the map . 
  you only get either stamin-up or dead shot depending on what 's on the map . 
  edit : [ here 's the shadows of evil video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5dptmjg1l0 ) , and [ here 's the giant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnskzmltza4 ), 
  pretty sure green means turned . 
  no idea , i 've been going for red hex on everything for about a week maybe , went for the sheiva as my 2nd to last wall gun , so i only have the m8a7 and box weapons left . 
  i 'm trying to get it on every gun so i 'm pretty psyced about this one ( it 's so bad ), 
  i have a bunch maxed out , have all attachments on everything except the man-o-war i think . 
  yeah , i have these , along with 210 other ones . 
  here 's the complete list of what i do n't have yet :, 
  assault rifles, 
  m8a7 ( 893/1000 ), 
  secondaries, 
  snipers, 
  svg-100 ( 207/400 ), 
  gorgon ( 361/1000 ), 
  pharo ( 56/900 ), 
  shotguns :, 
  argus ( 590/900 ), 
  ah really ? 
  that 's interesting . 
  yeah lol . 
  it * is * nice . 
  yeah , that 's the point . 
  eh , it 's not actually that bad , it 's just the fire rate is a bitch and without double tap it 's basically unusable at round 10 . 
  oh damn , thanks . 
  girl crying in the furnace room . 
  awesome man !, 
  i 'm pretty close to getting it on every weapon , the grind is real !, 
  like over 5tb i think . 
  yeah lol , that comment out of context is interesting . 
  i do n't even know , unless it was 8k 7200fps videos from several years , i have no idea how he could get that much . 
  ahh man , i can * feel * that slam . 
  probably like 4-5 days of grinding the giant and using the gorgon whenever i got it . 
  i reckon ron 'll try shooting rick , then someone does something that makes him accidentally shoot carl . 
  not sure what you mean by `` only if you set it up as one of the wall weapons '' , but if you equip the camo any time you get the weapon it 'll have said camo , then lose it when you pap . 
  not sure if it 's good enough but he does n't like that rick is friends with him mom and killed his dad . 
  good call , will probably play in to the next episode . 
  fuck that , if you want something to catch on , do n't shove it down everyone 's throat like that . 
  yeah , it 's stuff like that , that makes me feel like the writers are n't even trying . 
  in the pilot , yeah . 
  i think when the show got a full season they were told not to have any more boobs . 
  what ... ? 
  oh , i 'd be interested in seeing the bowie with diamond camo , or dark matter . 
  no offence but that was a stupid move on your part . 
  [ y u do dis ? 
  eyy , i think i have that same / r/codzombies sticker . 
  lazy work on treyarchs part . 
  this is the reason i wish you could have different controls on zombies and mp , for zombies i hate aim/target assist , but it 's very helpful in multiplayer . 
  also i hate having bumper jumper on in zombies but it 's so nice in mp . 
  i currently have red hex on everything other than the brm and weevil . 
  yeah lmao . 
  cod zombies . 
  yeah , it took me a second too . 
  you forgot to draw his face, 
  referring to the tiny icons and buttons . 
  cmd-q for osx . 
  although he worded it badly , i kinda see what he means . 
  i 'd rather play a video game for a few hours than sit and talk to my family who i see every day , would n't stay away from them for long periods of time though . 
  that 's true . 
  you do n't understand how ironic this is . 
  if i still played ps3 i 'd be stoked about ssx , kinda annoyed i just picked up blood dragon though , in hopes of getting some hype for the new far cry . 
  if anyone cares , [ here 's ] ( https://play.spotify.com/user/ghost959/playlist/0bhisxzzpnwnja5ecfvjsb ) mine , with more classical easter egg songs and whatnot . 
  how most people react to door to door salesmen/telemarketers . 
  what exactly is better about the upgraded version ? 
  / u/the-nard-dog, 
  oh yeah , damn , is that the episode that [ ] ( / s `` shane kills all the barn walkers ? '' ), 
  ( do n't read this until you 're finished with s2 op ! ), 
  i always thought this was my heart telling me too fuck off with the bacon . 
  why would anyone screenshot that when there 's literally a button to save it on the screen ? 
  i 'm not your guy , pal . 
  probably the sheiva , the pharo was also a bitch though . 
  it 's * alright * for camping , you just need to have a decent secondary in case you need to reload . 
  yeah , i 've noticed this is the case with the lmgs in zombies , currently working hard on those fast mags lol .
