  constantly updating like that . 
  basically if you 're running away from something that could easily be avoided by taking a step sideways . 
  exactly , mostly because they spend lots of time memorizing all different pronunciations and alternate meanings . 
  you slept for 14 hours . 
  or you might have lied . 
  what 's it from ? 
  what a stupid reason to be downvoted . 
  too bad it has that ugly ass background . 
  i wish the purple in the right corner covered the entire background . 
  i feel like the current model of $ 2 for 200cp is fucking ** insane ** . 
  with how many things there are to get you should get at least 1000cp for $ 2 . 
  weird how people sometimes have differing opinions . 
  ah man , i pretty much knew spider man was gon na be in this but i * really * wanted to now know he was in the movie before i see it . 
  i hope they tease him ( like a shot from behind or showing lucille or something ) in the end of 615 and then we have the entirety of 616 with him and not just a tease that leaves us waiting until after the summer . 
  ( keep in mind that i have n't read the comics so i do n't know if this seems unreasonable ), 
  oh , awesome . 
  i was thinking like if there 's a specific scene that 's like basically confirmed to be the end of the finale . 
  rated fucking r pls marvel . 
  it 's for co-op breaks . 
  i 'd say that the wundersphere is actually better , quick escape , easy access to the death ray and it 's veeeery easy . 
  i know that high of just having finished a high round game and it 's super awesome . 
  i was really hoping , when they added flairs , that you could distract homing missiles by shooting them out the window . 
  the no swastikas makes sense in terms of the story line . 
  in this alternate universe the nazi party never existed so that 's be pointless . 
  all zero people asking ? 
  well yeah , but to explain the lack of swastikas , in the storyline , germany won ww1 because of the giant robots and therefore continued to use the iron cross because they were in control of the world . 
  and since we see the giant robots in tg and de that 's the reason . 
  e : lol , i 'm getting downvoted for giving the most logical in-universe explanation . 
  ah man , i need to hear this . 
  you should post an album with each layer and it 's location . 
  does on shadows as well , not de though . 
  kinda looks like that one white monster can with the textured surface . 
  i mean , even if * everyone * except for one person stopped buying it they 'd still make money so yes . 
  lol , black ops 3 on the 360 is * not * 60fps, 
  this episode always bothered me because the inflection they sing ` yvan eht nioj ' is different compared to when it 's reversed . 
  thanks . 
  it was a while ago but i 'm not saying that i 've gotten any better since haha . 
  that 's amazing . 
  it 's really weird to imagine what it 'd be like . 
  what did she think about ? 
  did she know what was happening ? 
  was she even ` conscious ' ? 
  does she to this day even realize what happened to her ? 
  very interesting case , wish there was more information on this . 
  edit : oh shit , / r/all , hi mom !, 
  ~ ~ petition to have rules in place that require all posts to be written in this manner ? ~ ~, 
  petizzle ta have rulez up in place dat requires all posts ta be freestyled up in dis manner ? 
  i think it also said somewhere that she 's a ward of the state now . 
  there was a documentary ? 
  good point . 
  i 'm thinking he probably felt that he was taking care of her by sparing her the troubles of being a normal human in society when she was retarded . 
  mental instability mostly . 
  awesome , thanks . 
  will check it out . 
  that also makes sense . 
  i 'm wondering what ever happened to him . 
  probably some pretty bad charges of child negligence . 
  damn ... 
  that is interesting . 
  i 'm guessing some made up language maybe . 
  thoughts make sense before they 're put into words , but she might have ` words ' in her mind for different things she would experience . 
  pretty much yeah , 13 years is * so * long and i 'm wondering i she was thinking about her situation all the time or she just thought everything was * fine * as she did n't know anything that was n't * fine * . 
  `` hnnnngg '', 
  lol , sorry for not having heard about an obscure horror story from the 45 years ago . 
  exactly , how bizarre . 
  lol , that makes sense . 
  lol , you said in the beginning that it was ` zombies news ' . 
  interesting , excited to see what it is . 
  kinda concerned that he 's gon na do something stupid but i guess it does n't affect me sooo ... 
  relevant flair . 
  i agree , in a video a while back i remember steve saying something along the lines of `` back in the days when it was just me , joe , lee and elliott were the best . 
  then it all got ruined when ** censored ** came along '', 
  there was some speculation that he most likely said , meg , discovery or ross . 
  i guess we 'll never know . 
  tried archive , trying to find out exactly how high up my post got on / r/all the other day but archive would n't let me go past the 29th of feb. 
  13th i think , trying to look at a time lapse of my top post of all time and how high up it got on / all, 
  from these other comments i honestly have no idea if they 're serious . 
  i think kinda the point of twd is that all these people had boring , insignificant lives and now they 're suddenly * everything * . 
  seeing a show about their boring day to day life would n't interest me . 
  it bothers me that harrison ford is seemingly an asshole . 
  look at my post from the other day to actually know . 
  it 's a horrible story but in many ways helped a lot with understanding how children develop in their early years . 
  ah man , there 's a 3 hour window between my post being non-existent to being # 4 on / r/all . 
  wonder if it went any higher before inbetween there but oh well , i guess i 'll never know . 
  except with no consequences . 
  imagine if when you died in gta you died irl , not a lot of fun to be had . 
  `` coming spring 2014 '' they said , it 'll be immersive and fun they said . 
  rumors about him being an asshole ? 
  yup , they tweeted out in december 2013 or 2014 ( do n't remember ) saying that heists and an sp dlc would come out in the following spring . 
  neither of which did . 
  after a bit of research i found it . 
  ( not the tweet but from their website ), 
   `` gtav story mode updates . 
  for those ready to jump back into the story of grand theft auto v , we have big plans for substantial additions in 2014 continuing michael , franklin and trevor 's action , mayhem and unexpected adventures in southern san andreas . '',

  i 'd say it looks like the new slamvan had a slight solution with curbs . 
  sadly , probably . 
  it 's coming though . 
  they 've teased it too much to not come ever .
