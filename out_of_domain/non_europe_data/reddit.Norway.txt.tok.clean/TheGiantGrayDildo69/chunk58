  no i mean that they delayed it * many * times . 
  also they promised an sp dlc that never came . 
  i 'm assuming it will eventually , just not yet . 
  i 'd say so , but i 'm pretty sure it 'll happen soon with all the pictures we 've seen of the guys in mo-cap suits . 
  do n't know . 
  probably not , but it seems like a lot of people would . 
  i 'll do this if i get permission from op to use the clips . 
  eflc came out 1,5 - 2 years after iv so i 'm staying hopeful that it 'll be a massive dlc that just takes time but you 're probably right . 
  yeah , that 's the problem i 'd say . 
  i 'm super excited for the next season but kilgrave inspired some intense fear because there was seemingly no way to stop him . 
  it 's great if you like superhero movies . 
  super intense and a nice change of pace compared to the usual ` marketed towards children ' marvel properties . 
  also one of the best villains i 've seen since the joker in tdk . 
  it was renewed for another season so it 's not finished . 
  seems like a funny scenario though . 
  haha , that 's great . 
  probably about 10 images of the cast in mo-cap suits . 
  it 'd probably have to be something with insanely high stakes to top the existing story . 
  one from a few weeks ago . 
  if you 're not really feeling it in the beginning , watch 'till the very end of the first episode . 
  that 's when i knew i 'd love the show . 
  sure thing !, 
  go ahead and pm me the channel link and i 'll put it in whenever i finish the video . 
  actually they buffed it again so now it kills efficiently for a long time . 
  they may have focused a bit more on that being realistic when it 's literally the point of the entire movie . 
  agreed , i originally had a couple more lines in that comment about how it 's great if you like superhero movies and it 's great if you like more intense/realistic movies but deleted the extra lines because i could n't make it coherent with the rest of the comment . 
  lmao , the best thing about this thread is that people are writing comments in norwegian then getting replies in danish and swedish . 
  yup , always speak norwegian when i 'm in denmark or sweden . 
  ( except danes are sometimes hard to understand ), 
  same . 
  the ending of the first episode legitimately shocked me and i instantly knew that if the show had the balls to do something like that i had to finish it . 
  / r/kenm, 
  either a tabletalk or podcast from within the last 2-3 months i think . 
  video player does n't work for me :(, 
  i 'm gon na start saying this in public bathrooms . 
  i just realized all these references !, 
  i just thought people on this sub saying ` red did n't make the food ' was a reference to the fact that the prisoner would n't actually be allowed to cook the food . 
  i 'd say killing time 's only `` good '' feature is that it 's fucking cool , in my opinion it should be the level 35 unlock instead . 
  although it 's easy to make fun of ancient humans that believed in possession and stuff so strongly , when this shit can just happen whenever i kinda get it . 
  does n't really help your case , i 'd say that the ** vast ** majority of redditors are more mature and able to have a normal discussion than youtube commenters . 
  should be able to do it in any chopper and not just merryweather . 
  `` then i got the shaft '' do n't remember if that happened in jj but thought that line was hilarious . 
  i 've had one before but do n't remember spacing out like this . 
  you . 
  are . 
  a. synth . 
  #  arms grace, 
  have n't seen the episode yet but i 'm disappointed that the punisher was in the loading screenshot . 
  a minute , maybe two . 
  probably not my best one but a few hours ago i was taking an elevator that said `` otis gen 2 '' then instinctively i said `` otis gen 1 had its ups and downs '' . 
  still feel pretty good about this . 
  yeah , looks like bo1 , so cold war . 
  haha , was watching this episode while waiting for my plane earlier and during the scene when karen talks to frank in the jail cell , my mom leaned over and asked `` are you watching making a murderer ? '', 
  eh , i feel like most people know the side effects but ca n't stop . 
  but it 's so tasty and easy to consume :(, 
  wait , you * do n't * like adam sandler ? 
  i mean ... have you had a root beer float though ? 
  about 5 mins in , i chose the wrong episode to introduce my stepmom to this show ... 
  well i mean , i said i was gon na watch the walking dead and she asked if she could watch it with me , was n't trying to get her super into the show or anything . 
  like our sins, 
  small smg . 
  1ld masterrace my ass . 
  it is a true 50/50 . 
  haha yeah , updated the discussion thread a minute after he said it and there was like 9 comments . 
  it 's not . 
  blackops3 too . 
  have you ever gotten to 202 by dying ? 
  point and case . 
  that emoji literally looks like downs syndrome . 
  that guy is such an asshole . 
  lmao, 
  the guns that make his enemies shoot him first . 
  ca n't wait for tonight ... 
  i 'm in norway too and after just getting home from a really long flight i 'm just gon na stay up and justify no school tomorrow on my jetlag . 
  they would n't kill such a beloved character , it 's gon na be spencer . 
  yeah , a closet of gayness . 
  what the other guy said , i just wanted to add how amazingly brutal it would be to see on tv . 
  imagine one of your favourite characters barely holding their head up , still alive , with their eyeball hanging out of their face and with brains exposed to lucille . 
  they really ** fucked ** it up by not showing who it was . 
  intimidating but also easily can make fun and joke in the most intense situations . 
  in the scene he was in in this episode he just seemed excited about all the people . 
  ( having a huge smile on his face as he was swinging lucille . ), 
  a giant piece of cow dung is better than the episode itself . 
  ( or at least the end ), 
  a world where i can watch twd and * that * did n't just happen . 
  - scott gimple, 
  fuck this shit i 'm out . 
  yup :(, 
  well fuck . 
  i guess it did . 
  ultimately , i 'm ridiculed that they went this route . 
  it 's impressive how many fans you can disappoint by not having an extra 20 seconds of your season . 
  * please be daryl , please be daryl *, 
  i just really hope they can actually have the balls to kill of a beloved character , none have died since s5e8 ... 
  oh right , tyreese , sorry i forgot about that , still thought , only one episode 's difference . 
  i 'm pretty sure the official twd is @thewalkingdead_amc , do n't know about scott though . 
  [ do n't know if you 've seen this , and i do n't give the writers enough credit for it to be true , but it 's fun to believe .

  ah man , the comment 10 minutes before you looks like he saw it , looks like we just missed it . 
  hit me back if you find it .
