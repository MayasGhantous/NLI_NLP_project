  if this is what aired i would still be a little peeved because imo the best part about the comic is seeing how [ fucked up ] ( http://i.imgur.com/udxxlgx.png ) glenn 's face got , how gruesome it was to see one of your favourite characters like that . 
  this is still ** leaps ** better than what aired though . 
  does n't work for me :(, 
  found it , here : https://vimeo.com/161512646, 
  yup , he was talking to gimple during hardwick 's intro and afterwards he was just looking down disappointed . 
  still though , `` hi , i 'm negan '' would be stupid for tv only viewers who just go `` uhh , ok ? '', 
  because he 's does n't do anything . 
  the `` oh shit '' moment of seeing your favourite character 's head bashed in is what this episode needed to make it one of the best in the series . 
  i thought it was weird how these ` big ' actors were cast in a part that was like 2 minutes . 
  i agree , but to counter your point of `` why maggie '' , maybe if they knew she was pregnant and that they 'd go to the hilltop to help her , then trap them like they did . 
  `` i 'm just gon na stand here for a minute then just to prove a point '', 
  yeah , i just mean like why not have some random no-names who can just walk down a street cheerfully ? 
  but they could 've just had some unknowns since you do n't need impeccable acting skills just to walk down a street in one scene . 
  hummingbirds are [ vibrating midget birds ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/2a78ww/after_brain_surgery_my_boyfriend_couldnt_think_of ), 
   we had tried to get away with it when rick was in the train car and he says , `` they do n't know who they 're screwing with . '' the options hurt the sequence . 
  we did n't want to take away from that moment . 
  well then ** why the fuck ** would you ` hurt the sequence ' of negan 's entrance by ** not showing who dies ? 
  i know , i just mean that this would 've been better than what they 're doing now . 
  pretty much , the season finale was n't as much of a cliffhanger as a ` why the fuck would they end it there ? ', 
  care to explain ... ? 
  haha , me too , i 'm just saying that this would 've been the best way to shock everyone watching . 
  i know , this is n't what i think happened , just a great way this episode could have gone . 
  i know it 's not going to happen and i do n't expect it to ever happen . 
  haha , yeah ... 
  that 's what this post is about . 
  yeah haha , sorry about your post . 
  i can only imagine how hard it 's been on the mods since the finale . 
  it 's been a shitstorm and they 've done an amazing job keeping it good and clean here . 
  kind of a funny dilemma but worded like it came from the fantasy of a 13 y/o . 
  ah sweet , something to make time pass before the new zombies map on the 18th . 
  dying light if you like open world/zombie games . 
  aaaand ps4 , you have all 3 choices now lol . 
  oh , it sucks on desktop too , it 's fine . 
  oh , he 'll be there too . 
  lol , i wish amc would just start removing this picture any time they see it like it was actually a leak . 
  try, 
  i ** really ** wish i could see and compare how talking dead would have been with and without showing the death . 
  click on it , do n't know why that showed up but it did for me too . 
  mice musicians arent real, 
  you 're right , star wars is merely a space documentary . 
  oh do n't get me started on that . 
  disappointed that nobody 's linked cletus yet ... 
  edit : https://youtu.be/j8ckfsu5l0a, 
  they 're about every 10 rounds, 
  not on de, 
  ghostmw2awsome , feel free to add me . 
  * sees picture * `` yup , that 's a feminist alright '', 
  ah , i used that the other day . 
  someone said that star wars was n't sci-fi so i said it was ` merely a space documentary ', 
  will do in like 5 hours if no one has yet . 
  you do realize that they did n't have to have the cutscene ready by the ps conference right ? 
  idk why that shows up as a huge white square , sorry about that . . 
  awesome , thanks !, 
  [ i do n't know how i feel about * your * username ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mframiv.png ), 
  lmaaaooo , this should be on a sign at the police stations in gta . 
  everyjuan already got gold , late to the party again :(, 
  i have absolutely * no * idea if this girl i 'm ** super ** into actually likes me back or just enjoys the attention . 
  ahh , that 's rough . 
  i do n't have any profound advice , i just know that feeling . 
  yeah , it 's pretty brutal . 
  oh god what a shameless product placement . 
  jesus christ guys the guns in the fucking map !, 
  in the de trailer there was * one * shot where you could barely see the razorback , in this one there are ** several ** shots where you can see the hg-40 and a very clear first person shot of the marshal . 
  as i said in another thread .

  haha , like roman atwood in casey neistat 's vlog the other day . 
  `` i 've got a little pot with me '' * pulls out tiny flower pot *, 
  that 's the point ... you play the game and get good to get better weapons ... 
  probably open for everyone or level locked , ld is for gobblegum . 
  why do you think so exactly ? 
  they ( at least the m12 and hg ) were ** heavily ** featured in the trailer , why would n't they ? 
   you play the game and get good to get ~ ~ better ~ ~ more weapons ... 
  doubt it , ppsh has been in the code since release as well as the bootlegger . 
  i know , i 'm saying that they may have just kept the leftover weapon code ( with the pre-existing ppsh and bootlegger ) when they added the new ones for the new weapons . 
  i do n't know though , maybe there are . 
  oh , that 's a lot better than what i was thinking . 
  totally forgot about this . 
  have an exam today so i should be home in like 4 hours . 
  i 'll do it then if i remember . 
  good question , i 'd say mine is always throwing my grenades as soon as i get them , at times gets me killed and i never have grenades for crawlers at the ends of rounds . 
  the lightning is an effect from clearing debris or opening doors . 
  it 's always looked like that when you clear debris , there 's almost certainly not gon na be an ` electric vine trap ' . 
  also known as door opening ... ? 
  that 's a ` clearing debris ' effect, 
  ah man , i screenshotted this to post it but forgot ... have my upvote . 
  i agree with your comment but i 'm only really upvoting you because you did n't say ` could care less ' . 
  sorry , do n't frequent this sub too often . 
  good point , would still be better than the current system . 
  haha , have n't seen that one before , that 's great !, 
  not when ps4 gets it first, 
  you can overtake monetization and get all the money from the video though . 
  that 's disappointing . 
  that sucks for me , slow internet means if it 's another ~ 10gb it wo n't be done for me until after the dlc drops . 
  that 's what i thought, 
  feb 1st , just checked . 
  thanks , the reason for these is because my theater mode games would n't save properly so i only had 2 very short games to get clips from . 
  if i spent more than an hour on one it 'd probably be better . 
  might post results tomorrow .
