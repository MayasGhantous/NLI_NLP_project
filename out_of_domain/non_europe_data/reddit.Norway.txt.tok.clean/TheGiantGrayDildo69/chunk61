  sorry , did n't account for every scenario . 
  nope , was just shooting zombies and it popped up . 
  hopefully , i 'd say the likeliness goes in the order of :, 
  razorback wk but nothing else, 
  all weapon kits, 
  supply drop wk but no razorback, 
  i 'm really hoping for nr . 
  2 to eventually be added but i 'm not holding my breath . 
  lol , me too buddy haha . 
  idk how to say this but `` thick '' is in reference to her ass ... 
  i just want to acknowledge that there 's no option for , e.g. 
  one melee and more than one ranged . 
  also data may be slightly skewed by people voting multiple times , or choosing untrue answers . 
  i will when i get home if no one has yet , i wo n't be home for closer to 8 hours though . 
  lmao , it 's a fucking video game dude , do you have no real life worries or obligations ? 
  [ once . 
  right after they nerfed it . 
  would you say they 're ... 10/10 with rice ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ i 'll ^ ^ ^ ^ go ^ ^ ^ ^ now ^ ^ ^ ^ bye, 
  giants of karelia, 
   `` almost $ 3000 a month '', 
  so exactly 7 pills ? 
  i have a song to sing it and see if it fits haha . 
  i found out she had been over at my friends place every day for a week , when she said she had ` personal stuff ' she had to do . 
  just stopped talking to her pretty much . 
  i can not ** fucking ** believe this little ** fuck ** just asked for the price of 2 ** fucking ** products !, 
  do people even raise their kids anymore ? 
   appears on my front page, 
  that means you 're subscribed fucknut . 
  / r/montageparodies, 
  haha , yeah , my friend was damned if he did n't try though . 
  huh , i literally drank this like 2 days ago . 
  it 's pretty alright . 
  there 's also no controller vibration on pc lmao . 
  oh dicktits , when did this start ... ? 
  it 's a compulsive action for me . 
  whenever i 'm not doing anything i just start yying , it 's not on purpose . 
  no they were n't ... ? 
  idk why you 're being downvoted . 
  weapons based on mp wws so far have been :, 
  - wrath of the ancients - sparrow, 
  - dg-4 - gravity spikes, 
  - sword - ( maybe ripper ? ), 
  would make perfect sense if there 's a ` purifier ' as the ww or specialist weapon . 
  tg has snow all over , what are you talking about ? 
  one of the only 2 ees on the map is centered around a snow bank . 
  saw it with 3k + upvotes . 
  just said ` what the fucking what ? ', 
  and came here to make sure someone posted it . 
  as a non-biased individual . 
  it 's pretty good , the mp feels a lot more balanced than a lot of other cods . 
  if you 're into mp it 's worth it . 
  i 'm more of a zombies player myself so i 'm not too sure . 
  ohh , i did n't realize this was without jugg . 
  with jugg it 's the same though . 
  the thing about zombies is that a lot of the maps have insane depth and big story based easter eggs , trying to complete all these things and beating your high scores is what keeps it fresh . 
  i see how it 's not for everyone though . 
  if you 'd have played it since waw or bo1 and were as invested in the storyline as many people i 'm sure you 'd see it differently . 
  yup , it 'll increase about 20 % per player . 
  ( * very * rough estimate ), 
  i know , i 'm just saying that the waffe is similar to the tempest . 
  void bow is a good call . 
  ca n't tell if you 're making fun of me but i agree . 
  no , it 's 5 hits in waw-bo3 . 
  e : to whoever 's downvoting me , literally look at any video from any year from any of the games , and point out to me when someone is dying from 4 hits . 
  well i know , just thought it was a cool clip . 
  yeah , pretty much everyone who likes zombies wo n't go * near * public games , either with friends , or solo is the way to do it . 
  i 'd also like to add , anyone reading this who only tried soe on bo3 and did n't like zombies , * please * try again !, 
  soe is such a bad map for beginners . 
  honestly do n't know what the fail is here ? 
  you know it :p, 
  that 's what i was thinking too . 
   one of the weapons is op ( marshals ), 
  the shadowclaw is ** op as fuck ** . 
  it 's a one shot at any range , virtually infinite ammo because you can pick the bolts back up , insane fire rate , dual wield , can be used as a secondary , meaning that you can also have a op primary . 
  it has a bayonet that allows you to 1 knife any enemy ( contrary to the punch that 's a 2 hit ) . 
  also iirc the chance of getting them is 0.02 % or 0.2 % . 
  unfortunately i 'm pretty sure it 's the former . 
  exactly , fuck that gun . 
  you ca n't get 4 perkaholics if you get a power boost . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ believed ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ `` we ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ never ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ went ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ moon '' ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ conspiracy ... 
  i obviously do n't anymore but damn i was convinced for a while in my / r/blunderyears, 
  man , this channel sure is getting out of hand ... 
  ahh i just remembered those , damn you r * !, 
  lmao , i 'll be online in a few hours bb , 
  ah yeah , at times it would do that haha . 
  good times . 
  annoying times , but i still want them back . 
  cost : $ 15,000,000, 
   cluttered with microtransactions, 
  man , people really make gta out to be a lot worse than it actually is . 
  oh yeah , one of the many perks of norway . 
  sorry for not getting back to you sooner , looks like someone already found it for you though !, 
  i have n't really watched any of his videos but a while back he stole one of my finds and posted it on his channel without asking , then ignored my request to link to my yt . 
  [ here 's his video , ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lk2c17mxxog ) and [ here 's my post about it , ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops3/comments/3ugx5m/found_a_cool_lost_easter_egg_on_the_manowar_sorry/ ) i commented on his video several times asking if he could link my channel . 
  i agree with / u/quilled , any kid older than 10 today would n't call esp ` that really old movie ' . 
  i felt like it was just a cheap line to make a joke about how young he is . 
  why quote the entire comment ? 
  i think we 've literally run out of memes right now . 
  i agree with you , and i 'd also pay a lot for cod4 , but because it 's being bundled with iw i 'm not getting it , because of the simple fact that out of principle i 'm not getting that game .
