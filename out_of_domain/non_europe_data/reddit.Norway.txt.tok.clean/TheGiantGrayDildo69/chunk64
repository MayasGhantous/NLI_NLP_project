  someone needs to edit that gif of the car hitting an ied and detonating mid flight to just have a blink when it 's in the air . 
  seems out of character for walker . 
  fucking fruit . 
  i was gon na start by saying how stupid he is for not just showing us the shirt instead of making more videos on his own . 
  this site is amazing though , sorry i ever doubted you roflwaffles !, 
  ah , men !, 
  i see you 've played wifey-bitey before ... 
  me too , phil said in the new podcast that they discontinued it because it was n't very popular . 
  shame :(, 
  [ pls ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujjxaaxk3us ), 
  or he 's just not on this sub a lot . 
  it makes me sad that this is purple and not orange/yellow . 
  yellow would make it so that you go over to the bench and you can just build it there . 
  makes more sense to me but idk . 
  lmao , either this is / r/kenm or you 're extremely ~ ~ stupid ~ ~ uninformed . 
  edit : i forget that i 'm replying to real people on here . 
  you 're right yes . 
  there 's definitely not . 
  nothing in the code on tg , you get the gateworm when you finish the fly trap , the only dark ops is level 35 and soe ee . 
  it 's not happening . 
  next you 're gon na tell me gorillas do n't even have pockets . 
  every fucking thread , why is reddit so salty about this ? 
  look at the red card champion over here . 
  exact same thing 's been happening where i live . 
  with a super baby master race that wo n't die ? 
  what the fuck is happening . 
  ah man , i bet that 5 star one is epic in gta . 
  ( if you did n't know , when you get police attention in gta your light bar blinks blue/red ) . 
  it 's because the old gen versions are ridiculously neglected and painfully obviously just money grabs . 
  god damn it with these posts . 
  so many upvotes . 
   they 'll relapse , they almost always do . 
  what the hell are you talking about ... ? 
  maybe he just decided that cheats made the game boring and wanted to play it legitimately . 
  in addition to being wrong , why would you write 31 months ? 
  just write 3 years or at the very least 2 years and 7 months . 
  yeah , on mobile it compresses the image to fuck . 
  if i ever have $ 50,000,000 expendable , i 'll take it all out in nickels . 
  i understand your point but saying i '' * clearly do n't understand what [ i 'm ] talking about * '' is ridiculous . 
  there is literally no reason for them to release the game on consoles that [ are n't even being manufactured anymore ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-36097461 ) , other than to make money . 
  of course there are still a lot of old gen players but complaining that you 're not getting a game halfway through the next consoles lifespan is , in my opinion , idiotic . 
  i was talking about the dlcs , not the entire game . 
  although the entire game is rushed and should n't have been made , i was mostly talking about how the dlcs are blatant cash grabs . 
  ( releasing a remake of a map that already has 2 versions on the same generation ? 
  really ? ), 
  it 's fine that people want to play it on old gen , i 'm only trying to say that them giving the game to a 3rd party developer and having a 3 year game ported in a few months , only to not include the campaign and feature [ worse graphics than any cod games on the same console ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhihc6tgxbk ) , seems like they wanted it for the money . 
  bo3 , the 3rd cod game for new consoles , was also released on ps3 & 360 . 
  mw2 is the 3rd game on old gen consoles . 
  bo3 on ps3 is like mw2 on ps2 . 
  apparently i 'm dumb , definitely thought cod4 was the first game on ps3 & xb . 
  it may sound like i 'm exaggerating but i literally had to download the app to view this post . 
  i tried to view it in the alien blue ` optimized ' mode but it was too pixelated to see dick , then i went to the site in my browser on my phone but it was still almost just as bad , then i downloaded the app and could finally see it in readable size . 
  fuck imgur , and the community . 
  the term ` virgin sex ' should never be used in response to a gif featuring a < 10 y/o girl, 
  wait really ? 
  i legit thought this was one of those yt videos making fun of the absurdity in blockbuster films . 
  `` people like something and are expressing their fondness , fuck them '', 
  ikr lmao , what an awkward pose . 
  already made a [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0_sn-zhviy ) on this when the map came out , got to 45 using the strat solo a few days ago . 
  ahh that sucks , just deleted it on my ps4 because i do n't have anyone to play with . 
  die rise and motd it was out of reach , buried it was a shitty version and origins had the full version . 
  why the fuck would you have kids with someone with such a different ideology ? 
  lmao , i now really wish this was the episode title . 
  uhhh ... ? 
  holy shit , did they start making the press out of play-dough as well ? 
  they can get free publicity from people talking about how cool it is on the internet :p, 
  not me  mine is the first try , 
  the impossible astronaut !, 
  really love all the silence stuff . 
  holy shit / u/entropicalresonance at least get it right, 
  tryin to make a change :-\\, 
   guess you would be absolutely gassed at that point, 
  poor choice of words lol . 
  i play multiplayer quite a bit but doubt i would 've bought it if there was n't any zombies . 
  would n't count on it , music tracks were ` soon ' and they came out 7 months after the game came out . 
  however broken bottles do not cost $ 500 . 
  i was referring to when he said soon meant 3 months . 
  to be fair op , he never said it was his cat . 
  the 6th . 
  do fear in the headlights . 
  thoughts make sense before you put them into words . 
  constant despair ? 
  hahahaha , are you seriously saying she 's being raped by people giving her advice in a video game ? 
  sooo many deleted posts . 
  what are you trying to achieve here mods ? 
  jesus , [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/q2dhwan.png ) is the megathread on / r/news right now . 
  literally one comment in the top 100 that has n't been removed . 
  what an absolute cunt . 
  this happened when ireland legalized gay marriage , i meant that they 're doing it again because of the mass shooting yesterday . 
  you guys are n't understanding , i 'm just trying to ask if it 's happened again , has anyone had any other parachutes since yesterday ? 
  i do n't have a source on this and that 's the point of this post . 
  [ not a very good source but i remember it actually happening that week . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3759kq/i_heard_you_people_like_gta_gifs/crjv52v ), 
  well `` why would they do this '' is obviously so console owners can have it on new consoles . 
  i myself am super excited . 
  that 's just what people tell you because you suck at bjs . 
  best thing to come out of that game , wish it was a thing in more games . 
  it 's fine , i get that a lot . 
  which is fucking stupid , who 's gon na stay in the menu for more than like 2 mins ? 
  spotify yeah .
