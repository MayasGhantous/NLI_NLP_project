  when piper requested something with alex i think , sorry i ca n't be of more help , barely remember myself . 
  alright , awesome thanks !, 
  * supposed **, 
  did the 5/5 until i had to open up the waterfront door then just kinda did a strange hybrid of rift and junction . 
  i did n't super plan the high round attempt so i did n't really have any way of getting ammo haha . 
  went alright regardless . 
  best strat i can recommend , sit in the back of the 5/5 strat with your sword out and the cp active , have aftertaste and ( what i had was ) qr , jugg , widows wine , staminup and ~ ~ double tap ~ ~ speed cola , every time your aftertaste runs out go and try getting a new one , this way if you down , the cp revives you so you keep your qr and you have aftertaste so you keep all your perks - qr . 
  pretty amazing strat even if i did end up losing 5 aftertastes haha . 
  not far from it lmao . 
  a blundell ? 
  it 's basically the same but you just sacrifice a few perks with getting like 75 % set up instantly . 
  what would 've actually murdered me is if the shopping free was in another vat and i got nothing . 
  me too haha , was very happy with the setup on this game , it was my first attempt . 
  my previous highest was 44 right after it came out from just training in the rift haha . 
  rip, 
  i was good on ammo for quite a while just because i had the cp and sword lol . 
  thanks haha , just decided to post this and accidentally uploaded the other picture to imgur first so i just did both lol . 
  i know , the post is n't hating on the game it anything , i 'm saying i was stupid for not doing a 3 vat, 
  five and five strat , he 's a youtuber , you could look it up to see what i mean , it 's where you camp in waterfront with junction closed . 
  was going to do the flag step but i was struggling to do anything by the time i was low on ammo . 
  honestly i 'd say shopping free is at least as good as a perkaholic if not slightly better . 
  whoops meant to write speed cola . 
  kind of a hybrid , when you have the cp and the sword out you can really just camp , when the sword goes back in you can train for a bit and the sword should charge in about 2 as shots . 
  just keep at it !, 
  played zombies since black ops 1 and remember how crazy it was the first time i got 30 + . 
  it 's not that hard after a while and dodging zombies/training becomes second nature , just need to learn the maps and how the zombies move . 
  good luck in the future !, 
  why ? 
  doubt it . 
  waffles for breakfast ? 
  what strange country do you live in ? 
  wait they talk ? 
  i have n't had ps + since april and i can play online just fine . 
  thank you for doing , what i could not ... 
  ^ ^ ^ look ^ ^ ^ at ^ ^ ^ my ^ ^ ^ post ^ ^ ^ history ^ ^ ^ if ^ ^ ^ you 're ^ ^ ^ confused, 
  icp !, 
  might be hard to get into but good luck !, 
  not even , this is like the top icecube of the iceberg , modding is gon na be insane . 
  why did you quote the entire comment ? 
  that 's what the reply button is for . 
  i watch that video maybe 2-3 times a week and i 'll constantly just remember while i 'm in public that i 'll never know what he was thinking , then i get sad . 
  do you have any evidence ? 
  i know this will quickly devolve into people telling you their birthdays and you probably do n't care but mine is the 5th lol . 
  edit : just realized it 's tomorrow lol . 
  if you 're on ps4 we should play and i can help you out if you want . 
  not saying i have any , just saying it 's dumb to dismiss it just because it 's an improbablity . 
  i do n't personally think it will be , partly because i try to live my life by [ occam 's razor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/occam%27s_razor ) , and also partly because i just do n't think it 's gon na happen . 
  i was just playing devils advocate and was trying to say he should n't state it as fact . 
  haha , thanks . 
   black ops 1 did xbox exclusive, 
  far more than bo1 buddy , every game since mw2 has had xb exclusive except for bo3 . 
  how do you think we ps3 players felt for all those years with zombies ? 
  uhhh , he literally just said that it was n't a new thing ... ? 
  wait 'till round 2 , same amount of points and it 's safer than knifing . 
  oh cool , her , the mars rover and i all share the same birthday !, 
  i do n't . 
  no , knife on round 1 , since it 's safer , then shoot 8 times in the body on round 2 then knife , same amount of points at the end of round 2 but it 's easier and safer . 
  yeah haha , ever since i maxed my bowie i get ptsd flashbacks to when i was doing the blast furnace method , anytime i see the bowie lmao . 
  why the hell does this never happen outside of the us ? 
  this is insane !, 
  haha , thanks !, 
  what exactly is good in kino that ascension does n't have ? 
  the way i see it ascension is an upgrade in every way . 
  how do you know ? 
  what a great moment ... 
  so many great nikolai quotes , kicking myself for not remembering one right now . 
  maybe `` this is like waiting for the ** midnight release !, 
  \\  dempsey when paping on ascension, 
  yeah lmao , first time i heard that i laughed so hard . 
  i know , then he should stop stating it as fact . 
  are there really americans like this ? 
  i refuse to believe that you 're not trolling . 
  i 'd say if your video 's say 15 mins , someone 's at 6 minutes , think `` oh man it 's 9 minutes , i 'll just stop now '' will change to ( in a 12 min video ) `` oh huh , i 'm halfway , might as well watch a bit more . '', 
  he was n't . 
  man i 'd give her an easy day . 
  as someone who thought this was / r/soccer from / r/all , the headline was very / r/unexpected ... 
  as someone who paid $ 14.10 for a burger , a medium coke , some fries and some cheese balls yesterday at mcdonalds . 
  this is insane . 
   in what country ? 
  norway, 
   when did mcdonald 's start serving `` cheese balls '' ? 
  called something like `` chilly cheese balls '' , i 'll look for a picture . 
  edit : [ 4 of these , a burger , fries and a 500ml soda for 119 norwegian krona or ~ $ 14.10 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fdqsjk3.png ), 
  season 1 spoiler ... ? 
  really ? 
  huh , i binged the show so i just always thought it was s1, 
  source ... ? 
  why ? 
  i have , and it was fine , i just feel like it 's not that amazing . 
  i 'd be completely fine without it appearing again in bo3 . 
  is it though ? 
  imo it 's barely in the better end of the smgs in waw . 
  you were born in ... 2001 ? 
  i do n't think we need another der reise remake lol . 
  i can agree with that lol , it 's pretty much an american ppsh haha, 
  yeah , i prefer the more complicated maps personally , but i definitely understand why simpler maps would be nice . 
  i ca n't see anything ... ? 
  interesting , do you confront them about it ? 
  do they get embarrassed ? 
  after seeing this post , i 'm inspired to do this .
