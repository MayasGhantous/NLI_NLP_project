  sad !, 
  that 's actually amazing , and surprisingly relevant , one of them has a pretty big and annoying flaw , and the other one is just bombing people left and right . 
  lol , her father might even be worse . 
  not being at home is stopping me :(, 
  looks like my intentional vague wording payed off . 
  it 's worded so that you get to chose which one is which . 
  that 's the point , 
  but he 's gon na knock the hell outta [ isis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5yebf3mxf4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=28s ) , so it 's cool . 
  yup , tried to do a [ hypercut ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5yebf3mxf4 ) of all the sniffles but quickly realized it would end up being nearly 10 minutes long . 
  i ended up doing only the loudest ones of the first 10 minutes of the debate and got nearly 30 seconds already . 
  be the change you want to see , 
  this always makes me sad , and i 'm always super excited when a whitty comeback actually comes from the same person . 
  yeah , like , what 's the blowjob : veganism ratio here ? 
  you can really just fuck any cat if you think about it . 
  / r/bettereveryloop, 
  can anyone explain to me why imgur is such a piece of shit website on mobile ? 
  you 're kidding right ? 
  i guess it can be taken 2 ways , either that if he becomes president he 'll literally bomb people , or that he 's taking ` shots ' at a lot of people all the time . 
  lmao , that gta logic . 
  `` if the window is broken it ca n't possibly be locked '', 
  that explains why she was n't using and aux speaker . 
  well they * are * in mexico . 
  ca n't confirm , was 16 , was n't mentally retarded . 
  yeah , especially since he so obviously did n't want it himself . 
  yeah , like that line that maggie says when enid 's cutting her hair . 
  i do n't remember the quote but it was so stupid i very audibly groaned . 
  edit : i also want to point out to americans who wo n't notice that the first 2 replies to this post are in swedish and danish , and the post itself is norwegian . 
  why 's that ? 
  jesus , i thought he was being sarcastic too , did n't think there actually were people like that . 
  yeah , just had some nice crispy rhubarb , no ragrets . 
  are you american ? 
  wow , i never knew so many people could be wrong in the same place ... piez4lyfe !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ other ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ than ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / r/the _ donald ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ course ... 
  not trying to attack you personally but it seems like a very american thing to prefer literal suger coated dough over encrusted fruit . 
  yeah but still , the few times i 've had apple pie in the us it has been covered in ice cream , whipped cream , cinnamon and sugar . 
   proven to make people delusional . 
  do n't know how exclusive to your city that is , unless we live in the same city and crack is only available here . 
  i got ta be honest here , you 're hot as hell , but i 'm really just subbed here because of these amazing watermarks . 
  europistan *, 
  m\u00e5 bare beefe med r/the _ donald litt s\u00e5 vi blir relevant . 
   seems to be a lot of armchair phds, 
  or , you know , an actual heavy cocaine addict . 
  lmao , sounds pretty dope , do n't knock the tree m8 . 
  this is what makes me so sad , playing games on the ps4 is just so amazing compared to the ps2 or ps3 but those consoles have so many good games . 
  and the few games they do add to the ps4 you need to buy again . 
  just put down money for the 4th time to get san andreas , bought it for the ps2 back in the day , the ps3 last year , pc a few months ago and am downloading it for ps4 right now . 
  yeah , sucks too because i 'm sooo inclined to get it too . 
  i would like to switch over to pc to avoid all this bs and just be able to play any game i like for a reasonable price but i just love playing on consoles so much . 
  nothing like sitting back on your couch with your controller and a cold drink and just playing for hours . 
  just got a semi-decent pc recently and although i appreciate the improvements it 's just such a hassle to do anything i feel like . 
  2 of the games i play the most on pc just suddenly stopped working for seemingly no reason , and the ones that * do * work are just annoying to play a lot of the time . 
  did n't really mean for this to become an anti-pc rant but oh well . 
  yeah same , pcmr people always say that it 's cheaper than console but even if it is , fuck paying any amount over $ 300 + the prices of my games when i already have a ps4, 
  uhhh , i 'm excited anytime anyone * mentions * pizza . 
  if i had n't already had food today i 'd order takeout when jeremy said that . 
  yeah , noticed that the other day , mafia iii was $ 19 less on steam than psn for me . 
  really annoying considering i do n't have a pc to run new games . 
  awww , this reminds me of my bengal , such beautiful cats ... 
  and now i 'm sad :(, 
  lmao !, 
  i think i 've seen that video more than 238 times at this point . 
  if you really do , please trade it in , they 're blowing up left and right . 
  ah sorry , i 've seen the picture before , possibly even in relation to trump but i did n't know it had been posted here . 
  fifty thousand people used to live here, 
  wait , really ? 
  or are you just making fun of americans ? 
  on my way to cuddle with cats for money . 
  do n't know how much i 'd trust a wild pig ... 
  i was gon na say that it 's not that bad , but after reading these other comments it seems that i might be the fucked up one here ... 
  the shootings are my favorite . 
  i wish that was a joke ... 
  it was just beehive talk , but it does n't matter because i 'm gon na sting the hell out of isis . 
  lmao, 
  maybe if you get the ability to spawn with it when you 're at the top of the leaderboard ? 
   thoughts ? 
  well i wan na use it for a thumbnail , that 's for sure ... 
  that 's exactly why conductors hate him . 
  yeah , it 's kinda strange too because at first he kinda just looks like a generic douchy jock dude but as soon as he looks at the camera ... 
  ugh , why does every self-deprecating joke nowadays need to turn into a lecture about me_irl having sjw mods ? 
   i 've actually traveled the planet extensively, 
  lmao !, 
  i can tell from your complete lunacy . 
  nk is pretty much the only place this has a possibility of happening . 
  why do you keep copy-pasting the same comments ? 
  i 'm just sad that people like this exist . 
  i agree , but my point was why ca n't we just have a self deprecating joke without a 2 paragraph rant ? 
  you * can * if he 's on the middle , you just need to open puggle \u2122 before he goes off screen . 
  holy fuck , i was too lazy to do the math but that 's amazing , i ca n't imagine getting $ 1200 profit in a * week * , in college at that . 
  has any president ever gotten a divorce while in office before ? 
  listen to this so much i did n't realize that it was n't one of the singles from shadyxv lol . 
  also , the pitch in this video makes me feel like i 'm listening to '97 em trying to rap a '15 em song lol . 
  you fucking idiots do n't even understand , trump is the best . 
  did he rape several little kids ? 
  well sure , but he was doing it * sarcastically * . 
  you guys do n't even know you clintoncucks . 
  the beginning up until `` bonnaroo '' is such a great flow . 
  i do everything anally . 
  still wo n't work though . 
  lmao , i 'm so excited for february . 
  that 's a great quote i 've never heard before .
