  oh god , i 'm so dumb . 
  i only watched it once and thought it was a modified massacro ... 
  i 'm ashamed , and will show myself out . 
  no , he 'd go after the player . 
  i 'm not sure , i 'm pretty sure that the cops go after you if you punch anyone . 
  yeah , the ai is really bad sometimes . 
  but it never gets that cold anyway . 
  that username man , i 'm gon na have to change it ... 
  make a new account . 
  i have a different one , but i do n't feel like dealing with the subreddits . 
  what do you mean i 'm one of them ? 
  yeah :p, 
  whoa , thanks . 
  i 'd get you gold but i 'm broke as fuck . 
  holy shit , you 're so ugly . 
  aw shit , i spent all my money on dlcs and a game yesterday .

  weed [ 10 ], 
  weed + rice 11/10, 
  thanks you for your suggestion . 
  oh yeah , fuck man , i did n't need to see that shit . 
  you get shot in the face ?

  haha , it 's all good , i 've seen a lot worse . 
  it 's just the way his arm bends ... :p, 
  thanks , i have n't played on next gen yet because i 'm broke , but that seems logical . 
  i guess i was just assuming it would be higher with pc . 
  i 'm not gon na play it on pc in the near future anyway . 
  it looks like what would happen if adam sandler worked a 9-5 job . 
  what tabletalk is this ? 
  what does this even mean and why does it have relevance to the photo ? 
  hahaha , just yankin ' your chain . 
  ^ ^ yes , ^ ^ i ^ ^ hate ^ ^ myself ^ ^ for ^ ^ saying ^ ^ that . 
  thanks . 
  yeah i 'm really not understanding why that photo , but i guess that 's what this sub is all about . 
  i like to think i 've been desensitized , but this album made me slightly sick . 
  itt : boohoo , there 's autoaim in this game .

  if you see a old ladys vag , you might need to asphyxiate your self . 
  well , if you eject , and it lands more or less safely then you can get back in it . 
  you just ca n't get back in mid-air . 
  you ca n't get back in mid-air . 
  slightly relevant username . 
  i was thinking about posting this but figured that it was n't good enough ... :(, 
  steve was so fucking dumb when talking about the battery thing , i 'm so glad joe called him out . 
  that would be cool . 
  i love just cause 2 , it 's a lot of fun . 
  that 's what i love about black ops . 
  i would love to see it here . 
  i 'm really scared they 'll do this . 
  in my eyes that 's what they 're doing with hardline , it looks like a dlc for bf4 . 
  the possibiliy that they 'll do this is high as well because it makes money . 
  i hope they keep it similar to battlefront 2 . 
  it was , i played multiplayer all the time . 
  i love that game . 
  `` the history channel . '', 
  might be fake ... 
  oh yeah , forgot about that . 
  i do n't know but it still just seems like a cash grab to me . 
  he could totally pull off the comic rick look . 
  but , the comic characters often look different than the show equivalent . 
  kirkman 's said that he hates killing characters in the show compared to the comics though . 
  not saying he should n't kill them in the show , but i can see why everyone did n't die in the msf s4 . 
  it was so close though !, 
  i 'm playing it on ios , i do n't like point and click on console , and i had some money left over on my itunes account , it 's really good still though . 
  what 'd ( s ) he say ? 
  indeed . 
  not that it would n't be convenient . 
  it 's just impossible . 
  exactly what i mean . 
  thanks . 
  shut the fuck up you scum !, 
  today ? 
  ohhhh yeah , i love being able to take out 2 police choppers in 5 seconds . 
  oh , thanks , 
  i 'm not talking about quick recharge batteries . 
  i 'm talking about the fact that it 's not possible to have a universal battery that will never run out . 
  have n't played sa ... 
  well ^ this ^ is ^ awkward ... 
  everytime someone types it like that i read `` marrey-ju-wana '', 
  haha , touch\u00e9 . 
  your dick ?
