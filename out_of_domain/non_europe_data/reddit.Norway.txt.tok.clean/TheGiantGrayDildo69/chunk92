  jk , that happens no matter who you vote for . 
  i really wan na get in on this , anyone wan na help me contact the clinton campaign so i can get paid to shitpost all day ? 
  seems like a win-win to me . 
  there 's 2 missing syllables and i have crippling depression . 
  ohhh the cringe, 
  why ca n't it be called manwitch-boy-girl ? 
  e : ca n't tell if it was n't funny , or nobody got the reference . 
  ah , `` modern warfare : remastered '' . 
  i do n't really think the games are being improved much after 3 years so it seems a bit unnecessary . 
  not without them taking some pretty huge liberties yeah lol , probably aw2 next year , then ww2 , then maybe vietnam or possibly the korean war . 
  interesting . 
  they wo n't sigh that i asked them to work more ? 
  then secretly resent me for the rest of their lives ? 
  what 's the venn diagram for syrians that stoned their families to death and / r/trees used ? 
  does it just look like tits ? 
  this might say something about how young i am but i honestly did n't know about the korean war before i heard dane cook make a joke about how nobody cares about it because there 's no video games set there . 
  do n't really know what it was about ( other than north v south ) but i could definitely see it being a fun game , and the cold war / vietnam thing at least has n't been beaten to death 10 years ago like ww2 . 
  that 's cool , it 's totally your choice , just seemed a bit much to me , but i guess i 'm a bit more invested than most people . 
  ah , yeah that sucks , in that case it 's probably not for you . 
  i was a bit confused because i did n't think people still bought cod for the campaign but you raise a very valid point . 
  yeah , ghosts was cool , but very forgettable , and from what i 've hear bo3 is n't very good . 
  ( in terms of campaign ), 
  i do n't know a single person who does this . 
  this is the point i 've been trying to make too , if you like it , play it , if you do n't , do n't . 
  it 's not like you 're restricted to 1 game for the rest of your life . 
  i think i 've already replied to this , so sorry if there 's 2 replies now ( it 's not showing up for me ), 
  i do agree that a lot of the games are very similar , but you seem to be ignoring or unaware that there are different studios that make this game every year . 
  the reason it 's still futuristic even though people are asking for ww2 is because people were n't asking for those old wars back 3 years ago when infinity ward started development on infinite warfare . 
  it 'll be back to old , real wars in 1-2 years at the most , and then people will be complaining that they 're just copying battlefield 's success . 
  i was n't familiar with her before this so i just assumed you misunderstood the other guy . 
  although not in terms of human rights necessarily , yeah , they definitely are . 
  lol , maybe , but i was talking about [ this one ] ( https://redditcommentsearch.com ) . 
  whatever your opinion on hardwick , things like these ca n't get blamed on him , or hosts on any show in similar circumstances . 
  there 's no logical reason to think any host of any show would personally be responsible for a copyright strike like this . 
  how hard is it to fact check what he wrote though ? 
  literally just divide 1,200,000 by 1824 and you get 657.89 . 
  it 's not like it 's something untrustworthy , it 's basic , 2nd grade math . 
  even at 1/4th that 's still $ 875,000 . 
  with the same buying power as $ 7,898,646 in 2016 . 
  i 'm stealing this . 
  okay , fair point , and i 'd say it goes for everything on the internet , not just reddit posts , that if there 's no source , and you ca n't easily fact check , maybe do n't take it as 100 % truth . 
  uhh , how often does this happen to you exactly ? 
  aw , he 's so innocent and does n't understand what 's going on ... oh well , for the good of this species of tigers at least . 
  you can block certain subreddits if you do n't wan na see this type of content . 
  it 's ok man , i laughed . 
  it looks fine but it 's very clunky . 
  i definitely agree , although i see the flaws with it , i really like most cod games still , so when that anti-cod post on / r/gaming yesterday got to the front page i was kinda shocked at how much misinformation and blatant lying about how things work , and in turn went on a rather embarrassing comment spree that i 'm still unsure if i should delete . 
  exactly , i thought he was a funny guy but just stopped doing funny bits and instead just does stupid inside jokes with will and mike . 
  yeah , that 's the problem , it 's not as cut and dry as the examples you gave . 
  yeah but now cod is just a cheap ripoff of ** cod with mechs \u2122 **, 
  such a great hook . 
  why ca n't this have happened for ps4 ;(, 
  gon na try dividing them into categories of '' * came true * '' and '' * did n't come true * '', 
  ** came true : **, 
   - some new military planes and/or helis like the apache helicopter or the f35 aka : hydra from sa . 
   - the dinghy and cargobob to buy : this one is self-explanitory , the ability to buy the dinghy from www.docktease.com and the cargobob from www.warstockcacheandcarry.com, 
   - a video editor / `` theater mode '', 
   - new van : they should add a 4-6 person van , fully customizable ( i want it in matte black with tinted windows ) , no windows on the `` back '' part of the van , and it should be fast . 
  ( for heists ), 
   - weapons : i do n't have too many wishes for new weapons , a lock-on rocket launcher would be nice for tanks and planes/helicopters . 
  ** did n't come true : **, 
   - wildlife : being able to go shark hunting with your shotgun or knife fighting with bobcats . 
   - random events : adding the same ones from singleplayer maybe , and some more , even if not this have the existing armoured trucks unload their money like sp and give them a destination instead of having them going in circles all the time . 
   - scuba gear : mother f * cking scuba gear !, 
   - some of the outfits from/like the ones from sp : i really love roleplay and would love the `` police man '' outfit , the `` scuba land '' the `` skydiver '' and all of those . 
   - more fun vehicles : maybe add some more modifications to your personal vehicles like spike strips , mounted mgs ( only on specific cars . 
  ie , mesa from merryweather mercs . ), 
   - flaires from merryweather : the flares you get from the merryweather airstrike in ammunation , i love the flares and they 'd be nice to have to mark things for your friends , also they should look cool underwater . 
  ( they do n't have to do anything specific , just smoke , also you should be able to customize the smoke colour , and maybe upgrade the burn time . . ? ), 
   - more server customization : no cops , no radar , no personal weapons , no killing other players , toggle wildlife , vehicle class spawns in street ( normal  coupes  sports  muscle  super ect ... ) , player health ( minimum  low  normal  high  maximum  invincible ) , npc/npc vehicle spawns ( off  low  normal  high . 
  i know this would strain the servers a lot more . ), 
   - cheats from sp ( you could get a list and toggle them individually or toggle all ) , vehicle restrictions ( do n't like a specific vehicle ? 
  just turn them off ) and the ability for anyone on the server to vote on an option and it would show up on everyones feed ie : `` xxnoobfagxx has voted to turn off tanks . 
  go to the `` vote '' menu to vote '' ( feel free to add some that you think would be cool . ), 
   - smoke bomb with customizable smoke colour . 
   - real stealth : one of the things i want the most from this list is a real stealth feel , being able to sneak into fort zancudo without getting a 4 star wanted level , taking out police without getting 3 stars if noone else is around , no witnisses = no stars , and maybe being able to go off the radar by being stealth for more than 10 seconds ... ? 
  keep in mind that this is 2 years ago me , not the best grammar or formatting , so i apologize . 
  bonus fact : this was my first ever post to reddit . 
  it looks very clunky *, 
  i was just mentally replacing `` roaches '' with the n-word to make it easier to follow in the beginning . 
  i think they have prior memories , just not the memory of consenting to the implant . 
  i speak norwegian so i understood most of the danish and i 've got ta say the `` slightly off or strangely worded '' translations were on point , just like a realistic translator . 
  interesting , i 'm norwegian and i had no problem ... maybe it 's because you 're native . 
  just looks really big and the little control thing on the bottom looks like it 'd get in the way . 
  basically like holding a cube . 
  i think the google translate vibe was intentional . 
  it made it feel a lot more real , especially with the small grammatical errors . 
  it 's because it looks weightless when moving . 
  it 's an important issue . 
  what about people who do n't have their picture and name linked to their social media ? 
  i feel like they just glossed over that . 
  iirc they used sheets on 9/11, 
  his gift is a curse ? 
  yeah , and on double damage a 1 star is presumably a .5 star . 
  sure we can , we 're the internet . 
  lol , should 've specified 03:02 . 
  if you 're into video games or vr at all just watch s3e2 without looking anything up about it . 
  watch ep 2 , 3 , 5 and 6 of season 3 . 
  any order you like . 
  well on 9/11 a bit over 2,000 people died and people are still super sore from that 15 years later .
