  i mean , i do n't think this guys lying so you 're probably right . 
  it does n't help that the prequels are a lot more boring and worse acted than the originals . 
  what about / r/the _ donald 's mods ? 
  aww , hey it 's a cute kitty , 
  i think the real question is why do people still use the term `` cuck '' . 
  oh , i have n't seen those , you have a link ? 
  uh , yeah lmao . 
  since i could n't find any reliable way to translate it , it 's the navy seal copypasta in braille . 
  what the fuck kinda milk do you have that lasts a year ? 
  giraffes are so dumb, 
  it 's not really racist , it 's either just someone trying to be funny , or under the age of 12 . 
  ah man , as someone who ca n't get it where i live ; rip . 
  well , everyone seems to be lookin ' at you here buddy ... 
  i 'm sad you did n't get the [ reference .

  ( look at this first ), 
  edit : i just realized on of the edits referenced a gorilla being shot , harambe : the return . 
  the ones making the numbers should have been crouching . 
  i do n't really think smoking weed makes you a `` sedated pot-head '' . 
  being lazy and unproductive makes you a sedated pot-head . 
  exactly , why fight a losing battle like this ( no matter your stance on the issue ) , when you can be spending that money on things your organization is supposed to stand for . 
  what did he say ? 
  also , it most definitely is less harmful . 
  yeah sorry , i was just doing it from memory and noticed i got it wrong , so i edited it to make it the same . 
  ca n't the real one just stand up ? 
  rigged !, 
  it 's rigged !, 
  it just became a funny joke pretty quickly , mostly because of his edits i 'm assuming . 
  was at a canadian wedding this summer , can confirm , sat on hay . 
  yeah , what i meant was that they spent so long that a 8.5 hour stream was necessary . 
  ah , interesting , seems a bit needless . 
  why 's that ? 
  although there probably was , i do n't really think getting offended over things like this is really a thing outside of the us . 
  charlie brooker said they 're writing s4 now and it 'll be out 2017 . 
  that 's what 's annoying me the most lol , i ca n't remember which name refers to which episode 80 % of the time . 
  i 'd say just do this for everything . 
  i ca n't think of a single piece of media that 's better by knowing about the general plot beforehand . 
  both good points , but for very different reasons lmao . 
  it 's ... just a screen cap from the episode ... ? 
  probably just could n't finish 12 * good enough * episodes for the 2016 deadline so they waited with the back half for 2017 and called is s4 for practical reasons . 
  as someone who has seen everything except the waldo moment and white christmas , i 'm worried . 
  agreed , not a bad story , but a bit too lovey and sweet for black mirror and the ending did n't have any twists . 
  oh , i thought it was meant to be a gif or something . 
  i 'm saying i do n't think there 's a political agenda , or that the person writing the comment cares about race very much . 
  i get that the wording itself is quite offensive but i do n't think it 's intended as racism . 
  yeah , i see your point , i 'm just saying it was n't the sort of thing i 'm into . 
  it was good tv , just not for me . 
  live in norway , and halloween is definitely depressing as fuck . 
  the sun rises at 10 and sets at 16 . 
  i was gon na write 16:00 but i was too lazy to change 10 to 10:00 so i went for consistency and laziness over correctness . 
  since the clock has all 24 hours the need for am and pm is rendered useless , meaning that either would be correct . 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's where christmas , and by extension santa comes from , because it 's so dark and boring all the time , people centuries ago made a light festival in the middle of the winter to have fun with family . 
  ( this might be common knowledge so , sorry if i just sound stupid ), 
  you know what 's [ buuuuuuulshit ?!, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eheitvqf-tg&amp;ab_channel=cinemassacre ), 
  accidental team kills are the worst , the other day i was in the basement in the cabin ( do n't remember the name ) and i threw a c4 into that one hallway because there was an enemy there , turns out a teammate had killed him and was on his way into the room i was in . 
  it 'd be so interesting to talk to someone after that , they 've literally lived for all of human history ten fold , on their own in a room listening to the same song . 
  they 'd probably just be a complete and utter broken human , unable to talk or think , but it 'd be fascinating to find out what went on in their mind . 
  but at the end of the episode it 's revealed that what he said was true . 
  this just brings it into the argument of sentience and what does consciousness mean . 
  i think the best solution in this specific case is to assume it really is on the level of a human , simply because it 's the entire consciousness of the human , not just a program trying to act like it has emotion . 
  although you seemed like a bit of a dick at first , i 'm glad you turned out not being a total asshole . 
  also this was 2 months ago so i 'm lucky if you 're not dead . 
  well then you got as deserved . 
  lmao , i was browsing the tops posts of all time and felt the need to make fun :p, 
  there was one game , where i know i was in the wrong , but this guy was shooting team mates to just nick down their health all game , like every round , but we tried to not devolve into teamkilling because that 's the quickest way to forfeit victory . 
  well , basically , at the start of a round we all spawned in at the same location and i was immediately shot , but more than i was previously , so i turned around and started shooting , but then i noticed that i was shooting at the wrong person so i switched to shooting at the asshole guy but accidentally hit the 3rd guy in the head , killing him , then the first person i was shooting at shot me so i ended up just killing all 3 and being kicked from the game , leaving my friend to take the l. 
  in hindsight it 's easy to point at what i should 've done differently , but it all happened so fast lmao . 
  i could post a gif of it but it 'd take some time to find . 
  sasquatching is the only way to go out . 
  oh sorry , it might be from something else but i know it from battle rap , `` taking an l '' or `` getting the w '' refers to ** w ** inning or ** l ** osing . 
  as a european , the us * definitely * does not have clean water . 
  reminds me of that mathematician in ww2 who tried to figure out why the planes kept going down even though they were adding more armor to the hot-zones . 
  not really , most of the people i know are religious . 
  i think he 's a really nice guy but is just a bit crazy in terms of belief . 
   holy fuck i ca n't believe this amount of hate comment and pms i 'm receiving . 
  people have already decided my religion and are calling me a terrorist ... 
  i clearly said iran not iraq . 
  or maybe some people are too brainwashed ? 
  what the fuck ?!, 
  how is this even a way of thinking for some people ? 
  god , i wish youtube comments would stay in the youtube comments . 
  dude , they went out of their way to make everything * exactly * the same , even the little bug with the g3 ( ? ), 
  still showing up on the map with a silencer . 
  i think that by christmas , a * lot * of people will realize that this game is super fucking unbalanced and annoying as shit , it 's just the massive circlejerk and nostalgia that has everyone so excited . 
  yeah lol , tons of things people would * hate * in a new cod game . 
  he probably means pixelated . 
  i 'm a little sad that nobody 's offered me any money to say pro-hillary things on reddit . 
  lmao , he says he 's decided now but he should n't and wo n't tell anyone because it 's so divisive . 
  poor guy , he 's so nice it 's just insane to me , and all the big media outlets had to start talking shit about him . 
  how does this post have 14k upvotes in 2 hours ? 
  are we on track to hit the top of reddit or is this just pre vote-fuzz ? 
  that post is nearly a day older but ken * did * say he was going as obi wan kenboni in his ama . 
  remember to post it when it 's up !, 
  thank you for not milking your newfound reddit fame and actually only posting when it 's amazing things like this . 
  can you bareback your wife without worrying about beautiful human submarines ? 
  i know that feeling , 
  username checks out . 
  why is there still such a ps/xb rivalry ? 
  on reddit of all places ?
