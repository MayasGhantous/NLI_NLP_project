  way . 
  yeah , that 's definitely the biggest problem with invincibility , definitely just keep something in front of every spawn so this does n't happen , probably the best solution . 
  like , i would n't call a gay person a faggot , unless he was being a faggot . 
  pretty sure it can happen in mp too , not just a th thing . 
  alternatively , like i do , you can just post it to twitter ( you can make an empty twitter account just for this ) and just download it on to your phone or computer from there . 
  and yeah , just upload the video to youtube and you can download it on your computer . 
  you can post them to youtube or possibly twitter . 
  pretty high kick on the revolver too . 
  yeah , i just meant it 's not a th bug , it 's a hitbox bug . 
  what 's in the update ? 
  i saw it downloaded yesterday but have n't gotten the chance to look . 
  yeah , cod 's never done flying very well . 
  or they just do n't know how it 's packaged . 
  this is depressingly true . 
  it 's extremely applicable . 
  yeah . 
  it was n't even justified , if someone replied like that to a post i would just assume they 're an cunt . 
  because he uses the word `` cuck '' , causing people to think he 's an idiot , then he goes somewhere else and says that he 's `` only pretending '' . 
  that 's true , in which case i 'm in the wrong . 
  honestly that might be a good thing , if a pedophile has a piece of silicone instead of acting on his impulses with real children . 
  sure it 's super fucked up but it 's not hurting anyone . 
  finally something worth tagging this subreddit for lmao . 
   '' ** blackbeard ** hears gunfire in the distance but decides not to investigate '', 
  / r/absolutelynotblackbeard _ irl, 
  also , please let us turn off bombers . 
  fuck those . 
  i 'd rather have 10 normal enemies for each bomber i lose . 
  that 's my biggest problem with realistic , too many games have the hard difficulty just buff enemy health/lower your health/give enemies aimbot , instead of actually making them better . 
  it 's super annoying and would be nice if the ai was actually improved . 
  th on rsv2 was my favourite . 
  yeah , i wish there was a remaster of vegas 2 , or that they made th more like vegas 2 . 
  it was so good , but playing it on my ps3 is the worst because the controls suck and 30fps is hitler . 
  there 's not a single weapon locked behind a paywall . 
  i like cod but man am i salty i pre-ordered iw . 
  i was hoping for good zombies since i do n't like the mp but none of it 's any fun :(, 
  kapkan is representative of anyone who tries to use the spetsnaz smg , and frost 's shock drone is a bit op , pls nerf . 
   '' ** kapkan ** convinces ** frost ** to snuggle with him . '', 
  you can earn supply drops through an in game currency , as well as buying them . 
  it 's not locked behind a paywall but if you have a lot of money it 's pay2win , depending on if the weapons are any good . 
  have n't played enough iw to know if it makes a difference but i do n't think they 're gamebreaking . 
  sorry for spending money on things that interest me . 
  i 'll make sure to ask you next time . 
  i knew i was going to get the game anyways , i 'm just realizing that there 's some other games i 'd rather have spent my money on first . 
  i 'm sorry for spending money differently from you . 
  jokes aside though , why dress up as hillary ? 
  of course trump masks are gon na be more popular between his supporters and people making fun of him , it 's common sense . 
  at the time i was pretty certain i was gon na get it regardless of if i liked it or not . 
  the remaster is fine , but honestly it 's a bit strange how quickly you realize it 's just cod 4 . 
  they did a great job of making it the same as what you remember but after finishing the campaign and platinuming it , i do n't have much interest in mp so that kinda feels like a waste too . 
  i 'm extremely upset with sony for not implementing a similar system . 
  i do n't understand what the issue would be . 
  yeah . 
  at the time it looked like i was going to get it wether or not i liked it , but since i 've realized that i was wrong . 
  i do n't usually pre-order . 
  yeah . 
  what hillary supporter would wan na go as her ? 
  what trump supporter would wan na go as her ? 
  it 's simply more recognizable , it has nothing to do with their chance of winning the election . 
  they were mostly leftover ww2 props with some added sights and laser sounds . 
  yeah , but sometimes i just wan na listen to music or podcasts while getting renown lol . 
  they 're fine to deal with but without audio they 're nearly impossible to avoid dying from . 
  i like to play video games while listening to music or podcasts , making it impossible for me to deal with bombers . 
  i 'm a bit sad about it because i like myself a good conspiracy theory , but ever since the primaries , / r/conspiracy 's just been anti-hillary propaganda . 
  yeah , i totally understand why people do n't , and i try not to myself . 
  also , do you mind telling me what `` r\u00fbs2 '' is short for ? 
  i understand why you should pre-order , what i was saying was that there 's no point in shaming strangers on the internet for how they spend their money . 
  mostly just something to chill out and do for some renown while not needing to be 100 % engaged . 
  oh lol , i could n't find anything on google so i was very confused . 
  yeah , if s2 is announced i do n't think it 'll take me long to get another season pass . 
  yeah . 
  the remaster is probably worth about $ 20 . 
  $ 10 if you already have the normal version . 
  really ? 
  that seems like a lot of money for an actor . 
  it 's really nice . 
  i never played it on last gen so it was a very fun time . 
  also i 've heard good things about the iw campaign and the first 2 missions were good so i 'm excited to finish that off . 
  `` several ?!, 
  that 's more than a few and almost a bunch ! '', 
  what 's special with the 1964 election ? 
  probably because they make it look as nice as possible for the presentation . 
  not because they need to downscale it for consoles . 
  you have a timestamp to the actual assassination or is this just a documentary about the event ? 
  it 's probably because you 're on that damn computer all the time . 
  add a bit of casual sexism and you have trump, 
  ah , thanks . 
  i meant timestamp as in what timecode in the video does it happen . 
  that 's how it is in nearly every other democracy i know of . 
  playing rainbow six right now . 
  could n't agree more . 
  it 's very hot ... 
  when you steam it . 
  please do this , and if they try to make you leave start googling the voting laws . 
  there has n't been a knee-slapper on / r/publicfreakout in a while . 
  this makes me so sad , everyone seems so enthusiastic after he says it which makes me think that they would clap but were waiting for him to finish . 
  this needs upvotes , the man 's a scumbag . 
  no , it 's because he 's a sexist , homophobic asshole . 
  yup , averages are stupid in these circumstances because the average life expectancy does n't apply to him at his age . 
  it 'd be nice if it took them out early enough after exiting the barrel while they 're in a bunch , so it takes out all of them . 
  love that quote so much , really cool .
