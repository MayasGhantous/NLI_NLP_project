  could it be the same in the us ? 
  this . 
  to compare clasical turn-based rpgs with the newish wrpg/action-rpg genre is a bit squewed . 
  what got me into rpgs in the 90 's were the simplicity ( enemy x has a weakness to earth ect . 
  if you kill enough enemies , you go up a level . 
  take your time and think about your next moves ) and the story . 
  i guess you could say that games have evolved much since the snes days , both graphical and in what we should excpect from them , but there is something really fun with a turn-based game with a good story . 
  that said , some of the older juggernauts like final fantasy gives a lower entertainment value today compared with the olden days . 
  i believe this is because many turn-based rpgs are having more focus on experimenting with mechanics than focusing on the story . 
  i downloaded super mario rpg for the snes on my wii a while ago , and i still found the game quite fun . 
  i just got ff13-2 , but the games seems to lack something to make it truly brilliant . 
  men over til saken :, 
  braathens was fusioned with sas in 2004 . 
  this picture is either quite old or fake . 
  where do you study since you only pay 100 usd a year ? 
  cheapest schools i 've heard of costs about 6-700 nok a semester . 
  ** like you 're five : **, 
  no , because some countries have borrowed more money than others . 
  ** more complicated : **, 
  there are a lot of different aspects to think about , and finance/macroeconomics is hard to explain like you 're five . 
  but things like how long untill the loans are due , their interest , currency strenght , and that there are some privatly owned companies that lended countries money through bonds makes things more complicated . 
  the easiest way to think about it , is that if i 'm a country and i borrow 100 from you , it 's because i get enough `` income '' through taxes and other countries debts to pay it back . 
  on top of that , i might think that my national economy is going to become stronger ( so i get more tax income ) , so i borrow money based on what i * think * i 'll make in x years . 
  further , large currencies like the usd and the eur are used in many countries with weak currencies , so there exists proportionally more of them than is strictly needed in the us and eurozone . 
  if this shifted because the lender of the money suddenly gets all their euros back , there are more euros than needed , and the value of the euro falls . 
  ( witch is horrible for europe for many other reasons ) . 
  the easiest way to think about it , is that national debt almost has the same properties as personal debt . 
  if the bank ( other country ) asks you to pay your mortgage straight up , you 'll have to sell your house . 
  ( national welfare and other expences ), 
  countries are more dependant of each other than that , so think that instead of selling your house , you shut down your shop . 
  the problem is that the bank owner 's husband worked at your shop , and now the bank family has lowered their income ( loss of export to you , or loss of export to some country dependant of export to you ) and they 'll suffer . 
  well , it 's not * always * released first in the us . 
  one example is skyward sword , that was released in europe before the us . 
  i believe the reason for different release dates may be because of logistics . 
  when a new game is released , it 's usually produced in a select number of locations and needs to be shipped out to every shop before release day . 
  if you divide the world in regions , the planning gets easier . 
  not only because the number of shops are smaller , but also because depending on where a game is produced , it might use some extra days to get shipped to every continent . 
  it 's also a great way to make a little bit of extra hype about the game , that leads to extra sales . 
  mostly , games are available in europe after japan and the us . 
  even though the european population is larger than north america and japan combined , producers sell less games in europe . 
  so they might be `` holding out '' on europe for a few extra days to give the game some extra hype and get the europeans to buy more games . 
  it 's because your opponent quit the game . 
  you get a win if they quit , but i understand your frustration . 
  i 've never been in that situation , so i ca n't help you . 
   london - : `` totally british , we swear ! '', 
  ( english ) e.g. . . 
  i see what you did there . 
  i 'm in division 6 , so i 'm far from the best player in the subbreddit , but my tip would be to slow down a bit . 
  i used to have around 40 % posession as well , but when i started to stop treating every time i got the ball as a counter attack and actually started to build up the attack , i did a better job finishing and had more players to pick up the ball in case of a rebound . 
  and if you create more than 10 shots each game without winning , you should practice shooting . 
  never try to shoot before you 're at the box and seldomly shoot with a normal uncurved shot . 
  some random tips that helped me a bit :, 
  * stop using sprint all the time . 
  if you lear this early , you 'll dominate the lower divisions . 
  your opponents are used to opposing players running at full speed making them unresponsive and easy to take the ball from . 
  a slow moving , flexible forward is harder to defend against . 
  espescially when the attacker can pass to other teammates . 
  * when finishing inside the box , alter your direction ever so slightly and finish with rb . 
  the ball will curve around the goalie . 
  you can do the same outside the box , but then you need to be at an angle , so the ball has an open path . 
  * a low , hard shot from 20 meters is dangerous and looks good , but you 'll ned skill to make a goal from that distance . 
  it 's a good strategy on a rebound shot , but not optimal in one-on-one . 
  * learn what the opponent are doing . 
  in division 6 , many people does this lob pass and i have no idea how to do it myself . 
  still , i understand what it does , know how to counter it and know how i would use it if i knew the buttons . 
  because i do n't use it , and know how to block it , i get a x-factor when playing against them because my playstyle is foregin to them . 
  * this comes naturally , but if you pic a few teams and play with them a lot , you 'll start to learn their strenghts and weaknesses . 
  this makes you better , because you start to build an attack on the skillset of your team . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , koss porta pro has a lifetime warranty . 
  it 's not the greatest headphones soundvice , but you get a decent headset for it 's price . 
  i could hear it quite loudly when i was a kid , and i still believe i do , but i 've not been in a room with an old crt tv for a good while . 
  with danger of sounding like a tool : time is money . 
  banks and other financial intermediates take your money and gives you an interest for lending it and demand interest on borrowed money . 
  basically , banks gives you free money if they get to hold it for you . 
  on the flip side , your salary is based in a time perspective . 
  i get 180 nok per * hour * in my job , and basically exhange my free time for money . 
  i 've always wondered what prices in bars are in sweden . 
  i 've been in your fine country many times buying your cheap alcohol and meat to bring back home to norway . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  almost done with my master 's degree in business and here are my two cents :, 
  the app business is easy to get into , because anyone with a computer can make an app . 
  it 's also extremely competetive , because there are no regions so everyone compete in the same market . 
  if your goal is to be an owner of an app developing business , then you need to plan how you get from where you are today to where you want to be . 
  i 'm not sure that starting your own company straight up is the right way to do it . 
  first of all , you need to think about if programming is something you 'll enjoy doing . 
  because you 'll probably not make the next angry birds on your first try ( and might never do ) . 
  do you imagine coding for some company for a few years so that you learn the ropes in the industry ? 
  or living on the cheap so that you save enough money for starting a company ? 
  if you have an ideo for an app , then learn to code on your spare time and make a project/hobby out of it . 
  many of the more successfull apps are made by a guy on a computer in his room . 
  i live in the north . 
  usually do my shopping in arjeplog or shelefte\u00e5 when i 'm in sweden . 
  140 sek is abou the same as a drink here , i think . 
  i ususally only drink beer and i pay around 70-90 nok for 0,4 l or 0,5 l , depending on how fancy the bar is . 
  cheapest beer i 've had was in oslo , where i payed around 35 nok ( i think ) for 0,4 . 
  we live in a society where we sell our time for money , and all i 'm trying to say is that there is a correlation between the two , and therefore you ca n't really have one without the other . 
  time is thus used as a currency today . 
  i 'm not sure how the logistics would work if we used money as currency , but did not sell our time trying to earn it . 
  maybe you have some insight i lack to see ? 
  on our last day in krakow , poland we had a lot of change left and really had n't anything to spend it on .
