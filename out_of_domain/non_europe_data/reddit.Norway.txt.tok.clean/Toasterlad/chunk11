  between the three of us , it was maybe 100 pln in coins . 
  this old man was begging on the street , and in a random act of kindness we decided to give him our change . 
  first , his eyes became wide and then i saw tears . 
  we 're from norway and basically gave him each money equal to a beer at a bar back home . 
  i listen to the radio when i 'm driving , at work and during breakfast . 
  what i like to listen to depends on when i 'm listening . 
  * during breakfast i enjoy the general banter and music ( the local radio station ) . 
  * when i 'm driving to or from the university i listen to a radio station that plays music from the last 40 years ( mainly classics ) . 
  * at work they usualy play pop music, 
  * driving home from work , there is this chill jazz/blues show on the local radio . 
  * every friday from 10 to 12 i listen to a show made by two comedians on a national radio station while i eat something unhealty . 
  peer pressure on music is an odd thing , and to be honest , if you like whitney houston and mariah carey , then rock on . 
  you do n't need to listen to music that you do n't like just because your peers find your taste in music feminine . 
  that said , i like to think that i have a diverse taste for music , but i prefer guitar-based bands . 
  i do n't think my musical preferences are excatly manly , but they are n't girly either . 
  a few of my favorites :, 
  * johnny cash, 
  * green day, 
  * metallica, 
  * millencolin, 
  * guns 'n' roses, 
  * fountains of wayne, 
  * the smashing pumpkins, 
  ** edit ** * seems like two of the facts are wrong : you do n't get fined to jaywalk and it was n't a political proposal to ban smoking in your homes . 
  in norway , you can only buy beer and alcopops with a max strenght of 4,5 % in shops . 
  and you can only buy them between 07:00 and 20:00 on weekdays and untill 18:00 on saturday . 
  if you want wine or something stronger , you have to go to a government owned store with even more limited opening times . 
  in my town of 50 000 , there are two of them . 
  fireworks are only sold right before new years eve , and only allowed to be used on the 31st of december . 
  also , the only kind of fireworks that are legal , are ground batteries and smaller . 
  no rockets . 
  playing poker with friends can land you a serious fine , because all type of hazard games are illegal . 
  the only exception is lotto and sports betting with the government company . 
  turning right on a red light is illegal . 
  the same is jaywalking and talking on the phone while driving . 
  all give you unproportinaly high fines . 
  ( jaywalking is about 3000 nok , or about 526 usd ) . 
  ** edit : some more : **, 
  not strange by us standards , but you have to be 20 to buy alcohol stronger than 22 % . 
  the old rule was that you could only buy brewed alcohol when you were 18 and distilled alcohol ( except alcopops ) when you became 20 . 
  this led to some strange situations . 
  tobacco products have to be hidden from shops , so you need to ask for them , open a closed cabinet or get a note that needs to be validated at the counter . 
  same goes for medicine . 
  you ca n't smoke indoors in public , and there is a proposal to ban smoking in your own house . 
  you * have to * pay for government tv , based on how many tvs you have . 
  there was even a proposal to throw computers in on the television tax . 
  we 've run a project in certain municipalities to let 16 year olds vote . 
  ( wich is also the age of consent . ), 
  we pay our garbage and water bill based on the size of our home . 
  if you want to build a new house , you have to make it handicap friendly . 
  that means that simple bathrooms must to be able to fit a wheelchair . 
  our healthcare is so far from private , that the current government took private clinics and hospitals out of our national health plan , so you wo n't get treatment if you ca n't pay . 
  even if they 're under capacity . 
  all bars/nightclubs close at 03:00 at the absolutely latest . 
  in many places , it 's 02:00 . 
  we 've had debates on the legality of private schools . 
  if your parents are members of the state church , you become it as well . 
  that 's why something like 85 % of the population is a member of the state church , even though we 're one of the most atheist countries on earth . 
  also , we have a state church . 
  i 'm not sure on why excactly , but i guess the idea is that a red light is a red light no matter what the traffic situation looks like . 
  fixed . 
  i 'm tired and have n't had schooling in english for seven years . 
  there 's bound to be some mistakes . 
  thank you !, 
  the term i was looking for was * tv licence * . 
  as far as i know , only certain countries have a tv licence , and i 've just always thought that the us did n't have one . 
  it seems i 've misunderstood who proposed it . 
  i thought it was a political party , but it was the who . 
  surprisingly , yes . 
  the news sometimes has articles about people getting arrested and fined for gambling . 
  its illegal , but locally enforced , so its up to the police district to decide whether to focus on it or not . 
  kind of like public drinking in some cities . 
  edit : i was wrong, 
  before 2005 , private hospitals were a part of the national health plan , so when you needed to go to the hospital , you could go to a private one and the government would pay for it . 
  but in 2005 , the government took them out , so even though we have a hospital queue , only people with.money use private hospitals . 
  [ fucking stuff like fucking smirnoff ice and bacardi breezer . ], 
  no , i never seen it myself either , but they did increase it to silly amounts some years ago as a zero-tolerance messure . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , it was sometime between 2000 and 2005 . 
  edit : seems like i remembert falsely , as was pointed out by a fellow redditor . 
  is that from aeon flux ? 
  the article is in norwegian , but it basicaly sais that all new houses have to have a wheelchair accessible bathroom from juli 1st 2010 . 
  this is taken directly from the article , and to me it does n't seem to be a excemption for people that build their own houses . 
  they both use the words `` bolig '' , `` boenhet '' and `` leilighet '' in the article . 
  per definition , a `` bolig '' is any kind of living area ( usually defined by having a kitchen and a separate entrance ) . 
  thus , this still counts when you build houses . 
  you ca n't build a new house - or any kind of living area - that is n't in compliance with plan - og bygningsloven . 
  so it seems . 
  still , i was so sure i remembered a article about it some years ago . 
  i 'll correct my original post . 
  some days i wonder why i keep up with living north of the arctic circle . 
  this comic reminded me why . 
  [ ] ( / happy ), 
  i belive there is . 
  games are interactive , so to make them entertaining they need to give you some challenges . 
  challenge comes in many different forms and in many different difficulties . 
  some of these challenges might be a bit to hard for many people , so they become frustrated . 
  still , games are ment to be a form of entertainment . 
  thus we try to overcome the frustrating challenge to beat the rest of the game . 
  even though many of us are n't truly enjoying that one challenge that gets you stuck for a while , we enjoy overcoming it and playing the rest of the game . 
  for me , there are two things that comes to mind in this scenario :,
