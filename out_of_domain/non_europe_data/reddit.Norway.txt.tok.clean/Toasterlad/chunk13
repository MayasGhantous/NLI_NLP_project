  stock up on food and gear from the shops downtown . 
  start driving south , stop by some universities and get books on agriculture and engineering . 
  canned food is n't going to be usable forever . 
  reestablish myself in the country side of western - or central europe . 
  preferably close to a millitairy base or other reinforced buliding . 
  grow potatoes , hunt and drink in the starlight . 
  get bold and start exploring . 
  going all minecraft on the area . 
  die from something totally unforseen . 
  like falling while constructing a well . 
  classic looking trolls . 
  rgarding european bloodlust the ecsc was a direct reaction on the historical tension between france and germany , and was the forerunner for the european union . 
  i think that calling europe more `` liberal '' than america a gross oversimplification . 
  the us is a huge country with many different cultures . 
  compare a liberal area like san fransisco to a more conservative area ( like utah , maybe ? ), 
  then think about the fact that europe is a whole continent with more than twice the population of the us . 
  my home country of norway is just as different from albania as san fransisco is to suriname . 
  but i can try to explain the difference between norway and my perception of the us if you like . 
  ** economy : **, 
  first of all , norway is * not * more liberal than the us when it comes to economy . 
  we have rigid regulations and in my perceprion much more government follow-up on those regulations . 
  starting new businesses is a hassle and you do n't need more than a few hundred thousand dollars in turnover before your accounting needs to be done by a certified public accountant . 
  there is a huge bureocracy in place for just about everything and the government has it 's say in surprisingly many aspects of the daily runnings of the business . 
  this is a double edged sword , because this means that large business does n't get free hands , while small business still need to think about things like centralized wage negotiations . 
  ** religion : **, 
  religion plays a much smaller , and a different role over here . 
  untill 1997 we still had to sing religious songs before lunch in elementary school and had to attend church two times a year ( you could get out of the latter , but that meant a full day at school instead of a half day in church ) . 
  this was n't a huge deal and did n't affect us much , because most of us did n't come from religious homes , and in the homes where the families went to church , they ususally went a few times a year as well . 
  i believe we think about it as more of a cultural or generally spiritual thing than purely christian . 
  edit : now it 's up to each school to descide if they want to have a christian seremony . 
  in the same way , most of us are members of the state church . 
  i am as well . 
  not because i believe in any deity , i 'm an atheist , but because having a church wedding might be neat when i descide to marry some unlucky girl . 
  also , because i could n't be bothered to opt out . 
  i know the church gets it 's money based on members , but most of it goes to maintenance of old churches , and the state has to pay for it anyway . 
  so most of us are still members , and this forces the dominant religion to be completely unbiased . 
  the church have to have female staff and have to marry gays , because it 's the * state * church , and it ca n't discriminate . 
  this does n't mean that there is n't real religious people here , but they are tiny communities . 
  ** socially : **, 
  we do have a large focus on the good of the people , not the good of the individual like the us . 
  this might be because we have lower economic mobility than the us , and that we really have n't different classes . 
  even though oslo has a bit of a divide , i do n't think this is something properly present in the rest of the country , and certainly not in my town of 50 000 people . 
  our educational system makes it possible for anyone that wants to go all the way to a doctor 's degree without having a wealthy background . 
  for example , my father was a mason , and i have ( almost ) a master 's degree in economics , while my sister is an engineer and her son is going to be a electrician . 
  when you live in a system where the government catches you when you fall , being middle-class or upper middle-class is n't important . 
  healthcare and welfare is around 1/3 of our national spendings . 
  ( everything except housing taxes goes through the government , so we do n't have large state budgets - or states for that matter . ), 
  our welfare system is expensive as hell , but it works . 
  is it perfect ? 
  absolutely not . 
  is it economically substainable in the long run ? 
  haha , no , but some tweakings in government spending could make it so . 
  regarding drugs , we 're probably more conservative than the us . 
  weed is still completely illegal , and we have a major problem with hard drugs in oslo . 
  i belive some people call it the heroin capital of europe . 
  i do n't want to go into a drug debate , but seing completely fucked up junkies all over town does something to your stance on drugs . 
  ** politics **, 
  i could write a lot of this , but to keep it short : we used to have huge social differences ( and almost a caste system under danish rule ) from the viking era untill the late 19th century . 
  then the labour movement got a kick start , and welfare for everyone became our motto . 
  ** to make some kind of summary **, 
  we do n't define our norms based on religion , but on what we precieve as human rights . 
  healthcare and education is something everyone should have acces to , and fundings should be distributed equally . 
  everyone has a family member that had benefit of the welfare state and that keeps us more or less happy to pay our high taxes , thinking `` even if i fail , i know i will be cared for '' . 
  no problems . 
  my sleeping pattern is still fucked up from the weekend , and i have to stay awake somehow . 
  school is free all the way to high school , and college/university is around 60-115 usd per semester . 
  unless you 're from an unusaly wealthy family , you 're qualified for a government scholarship unless you live at home . 
  it 's enough to live on in smaller cities , and pays for your books and housing in cities with higher rent . 
  edit : the scolarship is roughly 8 000 nok per months for eight months and around 16 000 in two months . 
  you have to work during summer . 
  also , you have to pay back 60 % of it , so i guess that only 40 % is a proper scholarship . 
  also , the schools i 'm talking about is of course public . 
  we have a few private high schools and universities as well , and they cost more . 
  but not many people choose them , because any difference in quality is highly debatable . 
  i work in a 30 % - employment job as well . 
  eating ramen or frozen pizza every night and no drinking during weekends gets boring . 
  i 've also clarified the scholarship a bit . 
  it seems to me that the conflicts in the us is more about gay marriage , abortion , legalisation of drugs , and pros and cons regarding the welfare state . 
  gay marriage and abortion rights are broadly anchored in the population and in both the right and left . 
  we have one political party ( of seven in the parliament ) that is against both , but they do n't have and probably never will have the power to change the law . 
  legalisation of weed is starting to come on the agenda . 
  mostly through a small liberal party and some of the youth parties , but unless the labour party and the conservative party backs it up , it 's not gon na happen . 
  a coalition without them just is n't something that 's going to happen soon . 
  the wellfare state is in many ways the major debate , but it 's all happening far to the left of us politics . 
  even the most right wing party in parliament is for the wellfare state , and the debate is really about if we should include private hospitals and such in the national health plan . 
  labour do n't want the government to pay private hospitals for treating patients , the conservatives do . 
  could i imagine living in the usa ? 
  sure , for a while . 
  but it 's not a place i 'd like to raise my future kids . 
  short holidays , long working hours , but much better pay seems like something i imagine i 'd like now that i 'm young . 
  when i 'm in my 50 's i 'd like to have more job security and spare time and i 'm willing to trade a high salary for it . 
  it 's true . 
  one church seremony at the end of each semester . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , * reform 97 * changed that . 
  i started secondary school in 99 , and remember it as going to church with the school every year at primary school , but that surely ca n't be correct , so my guess was that it changed in 97 . 
  ~ ~ edit : i 'm almost certain i had to go to church during secondary school as well , so maybe it was removed later . 
  maybe some other norwegian redditors remember all this a bit more clearly than me . 
  for clarification , i went to a normal munichipal secondary school , nothing private or alternative . ~ ~, 
  new edit : we still do , but it 's up to the schools themself if they want to go through with it , and it 's not mandatory for the kids . 
  i use my phone , so i have no need for one , but this is really nice of you .
