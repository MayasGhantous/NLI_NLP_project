  real life karma . 
  historically , we have n't been as dependable on roads as many other countries ( being a long coastline and all ) , so we still need much money for improving and buling roads . 
  this is finaced through taxes on petrol , among other things . 
  we also have high salaries , so when you look at our buying power , we really do n't have to work as long as many other europeans to buy a litre of petrol . 
  ** rts **, 
  * command and conquer : generals . 
  medium pace and learning curve . 
  one of my favorites . 
  a bit of variation between fractions , some more if you get the expansion pack . 
  * age of empires ii . 
  slow pace , more debt and a bit higher learning curve . 
  nice if you just want to play something a bit more chill . 
  also has a great variety in difficulty , speeding the pace up a bit . 
  * warcraft 3 . 
  high speed , medium learning curve . 
  not an abundant number of different units , but all races require wastly different tactics . 
  ** turn based **, 
  a computer version of the game * axis and allies * that is completely free . 
  it has a massive amount of different maps with different game modes . 
  learning curve depends on the map , and goes from medium to extremely high on the more polished ones . 
  depending on the map , a game might take anywhere from a few hours to half a day . 
  it 's like risk on steroids . 
  * civilization 4 should be cheap enough . 
  a great game . 
  low learning curve , but takes a good while to master . 
  game length varies from a few hours to days . 
  ** one shooter , because it 's different from typical lan shooters **, 
  * serious sam i or ii . 
  it has a multiplayer story mode , is quite goofy and has fun with itself . 
  difficulty goes from easy to play when completely drunk to hard . 
  i had to google it , and [ found this link . 
  all stocks are risky per definition , so unless you want a potential loss , stay away from them . 
  some banks and finance institutions offer funds with a deposit guarantee , i.e. 
  you 're stuck with the stock for x months/years but you get your initial deposit back in case of devaluation . 
  this is the single most safe product regarding stocks . 
  with such a high initial deposit , you should check out government bonds . 
  even though the interest is higher in a foregin country , currency changes more or less balance out foregin interest rates . 
  also , there is a fee for exchanging one currency to another . 
  the absolutely safest thing you can do is put the money in a high yield savings account . 
  some might be locked for a period of time , but then the interest should surpass the inflation and you 're making money . 
  what is your timescale on this ? 
  planning on cashing out next year or in a decade ? 
  i spend about 2-3000 nok or 350-525 usd on books every semester . 
  only difference is that i get it covered by our scholarship/loan system . 
  i agree that there is a spread in income from household to household , but the spread is much smaller than it is in many other countries - the us included , and this was meant as a comparison between the us and norway . 
  however , i do n't agree that it is * that * difficult for an established individual to become a homeowner . 
  as far as i know , there is a lot of pressure on housing in the four major cities , but if you 're willing to move to a smaller place the housing market becomes better , and if you move to a rural area you can get a 200m ^ 2 house for less than 1 500 000 nok . 
  i do n't either have the same view regarding education . 
  many of my friends have practical educations from high school and i do n't consider them neither dumber or less worth than me . 
  to be honest , i 'm a bit jealous that they started making serious money when i was just out of conscription . 
  of cource , there are going to be arrogance and retards everywhere , but i would n't say that there is some kind of systematic discrimination of people with practical educations compared to people with degrees . 
  and in case you want to hipster it up from the big mainstream german language , its * overmorgen * in norwegian . 
  the day before yesterday is * forg\u00e5rs * . 
  ha 20/1 , men f\u00e5r 15/1 i stedet . 
  i 'm sorry , but i do n't know any programs , but maybe the good people of [ / r/norway ] ( / r/norway ) can help you . 
  maybe there is something i 'm missing , but would n't increasing the money volume depreciate the nok in the same way and not directly affect the housing market ? 
  this was probably on championship manager 00/01 or around that time . 
  the first time i seriously played cm was in 1996-1997 , and if i 'm not mistaken , i could only be english clubs . 
  for me , it was a revolution when cm 1998 ( ? ), 
  came out and i could be clubs from my home country of norway . 
  some time around the millenium , the game got a completely new design and became many , many times more sophisticated , and i absolutely loved it . 
  i played it so much that on the most intense days , i completed a full season . 
  i think the in-game year was around 2050 when i had completed every goal i found worth completing :, 
  * my team only consisted of players that came from my youth club . 
  * i had won every tournament possible consecutive for the last couple of decades . 
  * my stadium was maxed so i only got to expand it with 1000 seats each year . 
  * money was completely meaningless . 
  i had absolutely nothing more to do in the game , and every year i buy a new edition of fm i never get fully into it because i know i 'll never have the time or interest to do better than i did a decade ago . 
  [ / r/funny ] ( / r/funny ) has a rule against rage-comics , so that might be the cause of the differenses . 
  it would on the other hand be quite interesting to se the results of the same jokes `` translated '' from rage-comic to a picture , where you posted both in their respective subreddits . 
  yes , exactly , thats why i do n't understand why the central bank does n't just expand the money volume instead . 
  maybe it has something to do with readjustment if they need to apreciate the nok again later , but that could be done with bonds , if i 'm not mistaken . 
   it would be interesting to see the development if we kept the community gathered in one place for a few years . 
  i have one suggestion . 
  if you guys want to make the community jump to another subreddit , you could either do it through encouraging crossposts , ie * i have a suggestion ... ( x-post from r/fifa ) * or by doing something like they 've done at r/eli5 , and just have one post redirecting . 
  i 'm not excatly sure . 
  i remember getting a snes when i was six , so i guess super mario world . 
  happiest christmass ever !, 
  but i slowly started to lose interest in video games after 2000 , and between 2004-2008 i probably bought something like five games . 
  it was n't before the wii came out that i started paying enough interest to invest in a console . 
  now i spend too much time playing these huge games online . 
  jar jar 's list . 
  * meesa no make boom-booms for the f\u00fcrer *, 
  it might , but then again , it might not . 
  i 'm not sure how many people tend to play the older versions of the games for a long period of time , but i guess most of us will either get the new version or at least last years version , keeping posting of old versions to a minimum . 
  also , when the games becomes older , the players know them better and would have less need to post about them in this subreddit . 
  many of the mosts here are about becomming better in the game , straight ut questions or jokes . 
  if you 're still playing fifa 08 , you 're probably quite good at it and would n't need to post so much . 
  bergen is a good bet . 
  i 've been there only once , but the city was beautiful . 
  may i ask where you 're coming from ? 
  some smaller places has international flights from certain countries , and if you 're from the uk , i 'd recommend going to the north . 
  the midnight sun is at it 's peak during the end of june , so if you 're going here in may , you should check it out . 
  lofoten is the go-to place for visitors in the north . 
  you could also check out * hurtigruten * boat and take it from bergen to the north . 
  you get to see a lot of the country side . 
  the flair shenanigans have made me interested in watching some american football , but i have no idea where to start . 
  if there is something similar to the champions league or the world cup , where you know you 're watching quality football , i 'd love to start with that . 
  any tips ? 
  thanks for the information .
