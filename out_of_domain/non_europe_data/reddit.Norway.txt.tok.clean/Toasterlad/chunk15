  i 'll check out the nfl playoffs . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , man city is a good defensive team . 
  other than that , italian clubs are known for great defence . 
  i 've never understood american football , but i 've been using my sunday to watch superbowl games because of all this . 
  haha , you 're absolutely right . 
  no idea how i missed this . 
  takk .

  else k\u00e5ss furuseth about the nude sketch in * morten ramm fyller spektrum * . 
  ( morten ramn fills the consert arena oslo spektrum ), 
  ( dagbladet ) : this saturday it was time for `` morten ramm fyller spektrum '' , a show the comedian had made , on the background of a bet he made with ( the comedian/tv-personality ) thomas giertsen . 
  the bet was that if ramn managed to fill spektrum , giertsen would be the poster boy of an ointment against anal itching . 
  on the stage , ramn was accompanied with a number of celebrites , among others anne marie ottesen , thomas `` fingern '' gullestad , h\u00e5vard lilleheie , claus lundekvam , einar lunde and elisabeth andreassen , in addition to `` torsdag kveld fra nydalen ( a comedy show ) '' - collegues else k\u00e5ss furuseth and jon brungot . 
  ** bare naked on stage **, 
  ramm , k\u00e5ss furuseth and brungot is known for * stretching the band * ( ie , going a bit far/being controversial ) in the sucsessfull humour program , but on saturday they showed that they also dare to go far - also on stage . 
  the three of them and lars berrum did infact leave their clothing behind the stage curtain , and entered the stage bare naked in front of a packed oslo spektrum , in a slapstick show with a `` mexican theme . '', 
  in the sketch , they ran around bare naked accompanied to speed-up cartoon music , bathed in food and danced limbo under each others legs . 
  else k\u00e5ss furuseth also rolled around on a pilates ball, 
  ** - a party i 'll never forget **, 
  - pilates will never be the same again , she said to dagbladet about the nude stunt . 
  the show got a dice roll of two by dagbladet 's critic , and a three by ( competing tabloid ) vg . 
  still , it seems like k\u00e5ss furuseth is happy about being a part of it, 
  '' - morten ramm 's party in spektrum is something i 'll never forget . '', 
  maybe it was [ robyn - do n't stop the music ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpnasf0o7s ) ? 
  i can elaborate regarding maternity/paternity leave . 
  today the * family * has 47 or 57 weeks of leave , depending on whether the parent in question wants 100 % or 80 % of his/hers full salary . 
  the father has to take at least 12 of those weeks , or they lose them . 
  the mother is entitled to 9 weeks . 
  three before giving birth and six after . 
  there are some political parties that are against what they think of as `` forced '' leave for the father and some parties that want to expand it further . 
  [ source , in norwegian ] ( http://www.klikk.no/foreldre/barnimagen/article671097.ece ), 
  i agree , and my example is from norway . 
  i could * emphatize * with the pro-pirating arguments from a decade ago . 
  before the distributors had caught up with technology and still had business plans strongly based on physical distribution and regional markets , there was a massive gap between the percieved value of goods like movies or music and the actual price . 
  none of my friends had heard of amazon or other big foregin online stores at that time , and with the options of either paying 35 usd for a cd or downloading it for free , many chose the latter . 
  today , the most expensive spotify subscription costs 17,5 usd a month , so less than an hour of work will get you a massive music library . 
  it 's actually cheaper to `` rent '' music from spotify for a month than to buy a cd . 
  you have options like amazon , cdon and itunes for movies and can get your games through steam or a console store , so if you find locally sold games too expensive , you can get them around 20 usd cheaper if you order them online . 
  if you 're patient , you can even wait a few months , untill games cost 20 gbp and movies cost 10 gbp in the uk . 
  given our buying power , there is absolutely no reason for pirating . 
  even if we disregard foregin stores , you still only have to work for about 3-4 hours to get a brand new video game - providing at least 10 hours of entertainment - and thats on release day . 
  ( yeah ! ), 
  sadly , i 'm often at the recieving end of these , but the few times i win like this , it 's fantastic !, 
  congratulations on a great game . 
  ja , keynes kalte det * the paradox of thrift * . 
  taste differs . 
  i really liked it because it reminded me of the more creative sci-fi 's of the 1970 's , like thx 1138 , logan 's run or soylent green . 
  i love big budget action sci-fi like avatar , star trek or transformers as well , but the movies that experiment with how it really is to * live * in the ( dystopian or not ) future has always had a special place in my heart . 
  i 'm sorry that i cant give you any proper legal advice , but i have some ideas of what you can do if you want to make udi unconfortable . 
  from what i 've understood , udi ( or rather , all government run organizations ) are more bureocratic than the population . 
  this means that the media is your friend . 
  try calling nordlys , nrk troms , an , i troms\u00f8 , db , dn and vg and tell them your story . 
  you 're in a country where everything is noted dilligently , so if you said you took the 14:00 flight from somewhere to oslo , they know who the couple of border police officers were . 
  they can confirm your conversation , or at least phone records can . 
  as pyry said , cal uit and ask them for help as well . 
  you 're a student in the middle of a semester , and it 's not very reasonable to be kicked out of the country at this time . 
  edit : it seems like someone did n't like my answer , so i 'll try to give it a bit simpler . 
  also , i 'd like whoever thinks i 'm wrong to please tell me what i 've misunderstood . 
  i 'm going on a bit of a limb as i do n't know the goals of the us federal bank , but i come from a country with a goal on inflation of 2.5 % . 
  ** tl : dr : ** if you do n't accept any inflation , you 're gon na screw up the econmy big time because businesses will have no stability . 
  thats why you need inflation , and most countries has a target of 1-5 % inflation yearly . 
  * i 'll start by saying that the things i 'm gon na talk about now are interconnected , meaning that one influences the other , and my examples are simplifications . 
  ** simply put , inflation is driven by four things : **, 
  * expanding the money supply, 
  * expanding the economy, 
  * interest, 
  * currency, 
  in a year with no economical growth , ** expanding the money supply ** will devaluate the usd and give the us export business a better competetive edge . 
  however , as the value of the usd falls , businesses in the us will respond by setting prices higher , becase raw materials from foregin nations now costs more, 
  ** economic growth ** gives people more money in their hands . 
  ( through trickle-down or circulation ) . 
  according to microeconomics , this leads to higher demand of most goods , further leading to pressing prices up . 
  there are also a few things happening in the supply and demand curve , but i 'll leave those out for now . 
  the ** interest ** also has a lot to say regarding inflation . 
  simply put , higher interest means higher roi on savings and higher inflation . 
  but then you have to think about that most people and business also have mortgages or loans affected by the interest , so higher interest means higher expenses , so not everything is as intuitive as it seems . 
  interest helps controll the value of the usd as well . 
  the value of your ** currency ** is actually more of an effect of interest , but the currency is also affected by other countries economy . 
  simply put , the exchange rate is the differenses between the interest in one country compared to another , weighted by prices . 
  if the interest in away country goes up , then the value of away currency goes up , and the relative value of the usd goes down . 
  so then you either have to sell cheap to away county and buy expensivly from them , ( in the long run , this expands your economy if you 're a large exporter and vice versa ) or you adjust interest . 
  it * is * in theory possible to have zero inflation . 
  however , when inflation no longer is a tool of macroeconomics , you 're left with only interest and the money base . 
  and then you 're in a situation where interest fluctuate rabidly ( imagine 5 % jumps in either direction every quarter ) or the fed has to spew out money during eonomic growth , leading to a currency crash when a resession comes . 
  so my conclution is that a stable inflation is more important than no inflation , as that would destroy the economical framework . 
  that is a good point , and i left that out completely from my explanation . 
  but you 're only explaining it all from a borrowers perspective . 
  when you lend your bank your deposit , you should expect some roi on it . 
  helgeland and the lofoten islands are fantastic . 
  nordkapp is a bit of a tourist trap where everything costs money . 
  my reccomendation would be to travel from bergen to lofoten . 
  you 'll miss out on a lot , but it 's the simplest way to see so much of norway in a * simple * trip . 
  get a ticket with hurtigruten from bergen to , say , svolv\u00e6r and you get to experience a lot of the coast . 
  you 're right , it is of course supposed to be the * money supply * . 
  good . 
  i hope everything works out for you . 
  i 'd like more stand-alone episodes , and it would be grand if they were set somewhere else than earth all the time . 
  i love the episodes where the doctor is a guide to some odd planet or future where quirky stuff happens . 
  also , more ood !, 
  i tried to help you by taking the survey , but it only used the us ( ? ),
