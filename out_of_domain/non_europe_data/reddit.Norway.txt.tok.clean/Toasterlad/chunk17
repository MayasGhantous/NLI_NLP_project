  for example in economics , you have keynes and hayek . 
  this might lead to different answers being `` correct '' , and still not conclusive . 
  sadly , i 'm enjoying games less every day . 
  i have a large game collection with all the `` best '' games , but it seems like the games i enjoy are completely random . 
  the biggest case of this was loz : skyward sword . 
  i had been looking forward for it for a long time , played it for a few hours and just thought * meh * . 
  it was n't bad , but i just did n't get the same kick out of playing it as i did in my youth playing the n64 zeldas or alttp . 
  i also own the first one for the wii and the one for the gamecube , and have n't played them more than halfway through . 
  the list of games i actually enjoy enough to finish them or play regulary is getting quite short . 
  battlefield 3 , fifa 12 and the portals are the only ones that i 've actually sunk some time into these last couple of years . 
  i 'm still quite interested in video games , but when it comes to actually playing them i 'm just not having so much fun . 
  i completely understand what you 're saying , and i think a lot of this has to do with reddit having more of a * community * image than the * anarchy * image of 4chan or the * great web 2.0 * thing that 9gag or digg has going for them . 
  when i discovered this place a bit more than a year ago , i was shocked to find actual conersation in the comments , as this is something that happens seldomly on the internet and almost never on english speaking sites . 
  even subreddits like / r/f7u12 have discussions better than what you 'd get at youtube , cracked or the onion . 
  this gives you the first impression of reddit being different from other media aggregators and is more like community as some of the old irc channels were . 
  then you discover r/randomactsofpizza and learn about reddit meetups , or in other words , that there are nice and social people here . 
  during all these first impressions , you 're still just at the front gate with all the other new users spouting memes at each other . 
  then you hear the narwahl and bacon stuff , and you adopt it . 
  * it 's all just fun , is n't it ? 
  the only problem is that after a while , the honeymoon ends and you start to see the website for what it is : broadly known and used by many different people . 
  the cultural fragmentation is n't really about the size of the subreddit , either . 
  i 'm norwegian , and i like to contribute to / r/norge wich is a norwegian language subreddit with 1600 subscribers . 
  much of the discussion there are news events and many of those are political . 
  for the one or two of you not versed in norwegian politics , all our parties are way left of the two big american ones . 
  still , if someone mentions that we are n't supporting the * norwegian * left ( think real communism through social-democracy ) , you get the same treatment as if you said that you were an us republican . 
  * just because everyone knows redditors are on the left side of politics . 
  i even did an experiment in one of the discussions , where i did n't mention any parties or names . 
  i just added what `` i thought '' about the subject , to see if there was any change , and surprisingly enough conservative views were well recieved as long as nobody knew they were based on conservatism . 
  well , thank you very much . 
  it 's incredible how important it gets to describe a website at 8 o'clock in the morning after doing an all-nighter . 
  nice that it actually made sence . 
  this is certainly a long answer , and it seemed to be some insight in there , but as someone with english as my second language , this was insanely hard to read . 
  i 've been saying this for some time now . 
  another good example is spotify . 
  i 've had it for about five years now , i think , and i been a subscriber for about four years . 
  it has a massive library and lets me download it locally to my pc or phone so i do n't need an internet connection to listen to music . 
  it costs less than a new cd per month and is basically drag-and-drop with no extra charge no matter how much you listen to it . 
  why in the world would i risk pirating when i pay almost nothing for such a wast collection ? 
  what kind of genre are you into ? 
  we could probably list a hundred different games if it 's all genres . 
  also , how new can the games be ? 
  2005-ish , or something ?

  not really contributing to the discussion , but as someone who did n't excatly speak * perfect * english in the year 2000 , you 've just made the most compelling argument i 've heard for giving the game another playthrough . 
  i 've missed so much !, 
  i 've always found majora 's mask a bit more ... deeper than ocarina of time , but also a bit more sad . 
  now i understand why . 
  now if i only could get a functioning n64 controller ... 
  if i 'm reading this correct , it could mean that the [ large number of new users ] ( http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/reddit.com ) are starting to tire of the same old shit over and over again . 
  for me it took about a year to see the repetitiveness of it all . 
  a picture of a dildo is considered nsfw by some companies . 
  weird , i know . 
  to anyone wondering , a yellow card is a formal warning given to soccer/football players after they have done something warranting a response from the ref , but still not bad enough to get sent from the pitch . 
  ie , a hard tackle , but not too hard . 
  if you get two yellow cards , it becomes red , and you 're sent of the pitch . 
  i 'm from europe and i speak english as a second language . 
  pitch just sounded more correct than field , even though i 'm unsure of the differences . 
  it 's not in an insane asylum , but * american mcgee 's alice * has insanity as a central theme . 
  iirk , some parts take place in an asylum . 
  i 'm norwegian and i 'll probably support england because i follow the premier league closer than the other major leagues . 
  when england goes out of the tournament , i 'll just follow that one team that suprized during the tournament . 
  well , as long as it is n't denmark . 
  harry potter, 
  i agree . 
  the game is full of difficulty - `` walls '' and it 's a struggle to get over them . 
  in my experience , h2h provides a smoother experience when developing your skills in the game , as you 'll play against people with roughly the same skills as you . 
  ( or at least , in the same general skill level as you . ), 
  i have n't played much fut , but playing with other people is imho much more fun than the cpu , so it might be something to try out . 
  english is my second language , so i was bound to screw something up . 
  thanks for not being an idiot about correcting me . 
  that 's a good and simple to understand answer . 
  i 'd just like to chime in that * growth * is a very important part of the economy and inflation is a by-product of this growth . 
  remember that reddit is a massive aggregator site and it 's only `` sensational '' stuff that gets to the frontpage . 
  for example , if someone young gets superadvanceditis-disease , it 's a pretty uncommon thing and therefore becomes interesting . 
  because this is a big site , many people have some kind of odd illness . 
  reddit is also quite biased so take everything you read here with a grain of salt unless they 've given good citations . 
  we 're all just armchair experts posting on an internet forum , so if you have a good business plan and you have information that tells you your idea can work , then go for it !, 
  what some 16-year old kid thinks of your plan is n't important . 
  what your data tells you is . 
  i hope everything works out for you . 
  by the way , what business are you going into ? 
  i have no idea of the market in your area , but in my town there is this guy doing computer repairs/setups ( not exactly the same , but still ) and he 's advertizing every day in one of those small classified ads in the local newspaper . 
  [ his website looks like it 's from 1995 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sjtpf.png ) . 
  he been doing this for at least a decade and seems to stay in business , even though he has massive competition from much [ bigger companies . 
  ] ( http://www.relacom.com/ ) and other chains that can afford national tv ads and cheaper prizes . 
  so if he can do it , you can too . 
  there is this guy that i basically grew up with . 
  we started in primary school and went through highschool together . 
  over the years , he 's told more than one fantastic tale . 
  here are some i remember of the top of my head : ( age estimates in bracers ), 
  * adolf hitler was his uncle . 
  * his ( other ) uncle owned 4 in 5 slot machines in the nordic countries and was a multi-millionaire . 
  * he was out of his house for two hours . 
  in that time he managed to have sex with a girl for eight . 
  continuously . 
  * he knew the right people if he needed to get anybody killed . 
  * his step-father used to beat him every day after school just for entertainment . 
  strangely enough , he had no marks . 
  * roughly once a week he was attacked by kidnappers , but he escaped because of his wits . 
  * you know that one hot teacher in secondary school ?
