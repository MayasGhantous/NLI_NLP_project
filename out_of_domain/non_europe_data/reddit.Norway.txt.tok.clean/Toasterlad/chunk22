  for instance , if she is on top i 'll probably hold her around her thighs . 
  have n't heard any complaints yet , so i guess i 'm not doing * that * bad . 
  english is my second language , and i 'm always unsure about the spelling of * th * - sounds . 
  awesome link . 
  thanks !, 
  [ i had to search for a backstory and found this article ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/17/sports/high-school-football-rape-case-unfolds-online-and-divides-steubenville-ohio.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 ) , and correct me if i 'm wrong , but i 'm guessing these are some of the people that 's accused of raping her . 
  i had problems understanding everything they said and only skimmed the article . 
  i 'm wondering about what 's going on in their heads during the clip . 
  why they react like they do . 
  if these guys really do n't care about what they 've done , if they 're under the influence of drugs or alcohol , or if they are trying to cope with the consequences of their actions and/or accusations . 
  maybe everything , or maybe something else . 
  as far as i understand op 's and my own article , they have n't been in trial yet . 
  is there any clear evidence that the people in the video are the rapist , or just members of the same team ? 
  i know far to little about the details of the rape case to judge the people in the video , but no matter if they did do it or not , young people in high-preassure situations like this have used morbid humour to cope with the situation before . 
  i learned that from friends that survived ut\u00f8ya . 
  it 's the same in norwegian , but i 'd like to add that subtitles tent to simplify sentence structure and sometimes remove words . 
  this is to make the dialouge of fast-talking characters readable . 
  if you 'd like an in-depth explanation , you should head over to / r/asksocialscience . 
  i 'll give you a simple answer , and while the mechanics i 'll describe are correct , i 'm only versed in norwegian economics and do n't know the distribution of wealth or tax system of the us in great detail . 
  the short answer is that a flat tax puts a harder burden of people with low or average income , while not really closing any significant tax loophole . 
  basically , if people that earn 100 usd should pay the same amount as people that make 100\u00a0000\u00a0000 usd , people with low income would be significantly worse of . 
  the effect of this would probably be a wage increase for a certain income group , as `` highly '' skilled working poor would consider leaving the country to live elsewhere . 
  ( why work for peanuts in the us when you could make a nice living in canada or the uk ? ) . 
  you also need to consider the impact of decreased buying power in the middle class . 
  i guess the us , like most western countires , has a large middle-class and they are in many ways the backbone in the economy . 
  if the average us household ca n't spend as much money as before , you 'll see a massive revenue loss for businesses , something that leads to less jobs available . 
  the idea of flat tax is quite interesting , and in a world where everyone made the same amount of money it would certainly be great because it would simplify the tax collector 's job . 
  in other words free up government resources . 
  but in real life , most national economies need cheap labour and if we want to keep it cheap we need to lighten the tax burden on those that make less money , so that they can live better on less money . 
  i have a bachelor 's degree in economics and feel like i should correct some mistakes . 
  while / u/earhacker is roughly correct in his/her two last paragraphs , the rest is wrong . 
  while i 'm no expert , i 'm more than qualified to give you a simple eli5 on your original question :, 
  the first thing you need to know is that everything is worth something , and we create stuff or services that some are willing to buy * all the time * . 
  iphones , maggots , your time , or your bodyparts - all are worth money for some people . 
  the entire prinsiple of business is to add * value added * , or in other words , create something more valuable out of the things they have already . 
  this can be done by the company that creates gasoline out of crude oil or the hairdresser that uses his or her expertice to cut your hair . 
  because we buy and sell all this * added value * all the time ( most of us sell our time to companies ) , we throw more and more * value * in the big machine that is the economy . 
  and now comes the tricky part : [ we 're not sure on how much money is * available * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m0_ ( economics ) , because even if the government just prints a finite amount of money , we 're able to create stuff that 's just as good as money . 
  how fast money changes hands is also a factor . 
  because of all this * value added * chaos happening , and because we can create money ourselves , the government uses different tools to controll the economy . 
  if they do n't then lots of bad stuff can happen . 
  the main tool used is the interest rate used by the central bank . 
  iirk , the us tried to have a goal of zero inflation some time after ww2 , but they realized that if they did n't let * some * inflation `` soften '' the swings in the economy , the interest rate would go up and down like crazy . 
  and that 's really bad because it makes it dangerous for us normal people to get mortgages and risky for businesses to do loan-based investments ( the most common type of investment ) . 
  there are also other factors influencing the economy , but this is eli5 and you only asked * why * we need inflaton . 
  tl : dr : by allowing a little bit of inflation , the government creates a more stable `` frame '' for the economy to operate in . 
  from what i told you , you 're absolutely correct , but i forgot to mention a few key points that complicates matters further . 
  what i explained to you is what we call a * closed economy * , while most countries are * open economies * . 
  this means that they import and export goods , so money is flying back and forth between currencies and that the currency is available to buy for everyone . 
  if my last explanation was in 2d , the real world is in 3d . 
  the government 's job is to keep everything nice and stable , and because of foregin factors they * really , really * need to have stability in the interest rate . 
  the most basic point of macro economics is this equation :, 
  * interest rate * * * value of currency * = * foregin interest rate * * * value of foregin currency * . 
  then just think of how many different currencies there are , and how a goal of zero inflation - handled by an irratic interest rate - is a bad idea . 
  so they use inflation as a kind of outlet to even the edges of the equation . 
  if they did n't , then the dollar would change it 's value all the time and that 's horrible for businesses . 
  just to give you a simple example on how other economies effect your economy :, 
  let 's say that i traveled to the us and i brought a bank card instead of changing my home currency nok into usd bills . 
  everything i buy while i 'm in the us becomes brand new usd , while the amount of nok availble decreases . 
  i help to create * value added * in the us , but because i 'm doing it with digital money , i 'm actually creating more dollars even though it 's not all bakced by physical dollar bills . 
  you now see that it 's difficult for the government to controll how much money that 's available ? 
  you also have many different financial products that for different reasons influence the amount of money available ( on much , much greater scale ) , and this was only a simple example . 
  to answer your question : the government is n't the only one that creates money . 
  they only deal with the physical bills . 
  i found a short summary of the most modern form of gold standard , and as you can see , it was easy to manipulate so they starting having a * free floating currency * instead . 
   after the second world war , a system similar to a gold standard and sometimes described as a `` gold exchange standard '' was established by the bretton woods agreements . 
  under this system , many countries fixed their exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar . 
  the u.s. promised to fix the price of gold at approximately $ 35 per ounce . 
  implicitly , then , all currencies pegged to the dollar also had a fixed value in terms of gold . 
   starting under the administration of the french president charles de gaulle and continuing until 1970 , france reduced its dollar reserves , trading them for gold from the u.s. government , thereby reducing u.s. economic influence abroad . 
  this , along with the fiscal strain of federal expenditures for the vietnam war and persistent balance of payments deficits , led president richard nixon to end the direct convertibility of the dollar to gold on august 15 , 1971 , resulting in the system 's breakdown ( the `` nixon shock '' ) . 
  i hope you understand some of this , as i tend to get fixated on details instead to the picture as a whole . 
  there is this tv show that aired in the early 90 's that i remember watching as a kid called zazoo u. i can find almost any other show from my childhood online , except for that one . 
  iirk i payed 2500 nok , or about 450 usd for a 360 in 2007-08 , so 500 usd does n't seem to expensive for a brand new console . 
  as long as it 's a proper leap forward compared to the ps3 , i 'd comsider it . 
  norway here . 
  we have a multi-party system , so i 'm gon na generalize a bit . 
  i 'm also biased , as i support the conservative party . 
  ** far left **, 
  stop `` fighting '' the rich , start fighting outsideness . 
  we all agree that the rich should pay more than the middle-class , but chasing them out of the country is n't the right way to go . 
  long-term unemployment , due to disabilities or other reasons , is a massive problem for norway - culturally and economically . 
  the security net should n't just catch everyone , it should also help them back up . 
  not every problem can be solved by higher taxes . 
  ** centre-left **, 
  i like that they 've started removing some of the most foolish regulations ( the 100m ^ 2 limit on food stores on sunday was never a good idea ) , but they need to change how they interact with the unions . 
  in the last years it has become more and more clear that the social-democrats are a special interest organization for the unions , instead of , well , social-democrats . 
  our public administration has grown way out of hand and we need to deal with this * now * unless we want to go back to the post-war period regarding our economy . 
  ** centre **, 
  sp needs to understand that we just ca n't afford to live as decentralized as we do now . 
  i 'm not saying that we should abandon the country side , but keeping artificial employment in place just so a few hundred people does n't need to move closer to a town is crazy . 
  also , good agrarian policies are dependant on * output on food * not * number of farmers * . 
  the liberals should become actual liberals . 
  at the moment they 're a sort of green digital rights movement and extremely ill-defined for the poltical layman . 
  the christian democrats has modernized a lot in the last decade , but they need to cut down on the symbolics and focus more on good solutions . 
  i was never really culturally conservative , so i do n't agree on many of their stances . 
  ** centre-right **, 
  while it 's always fun to debate in a party that functions as a catch-all for non-socialists , they need to stay truer to their core values . 
  hard on crime did n't work in the 90 's so there is no reason for supporting more digital surveilance and similar ideas found on the left . 
  also , what happened to improving the tax system ?
