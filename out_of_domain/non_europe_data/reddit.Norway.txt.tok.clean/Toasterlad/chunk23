  ** right-ish **, 
  the liberal-populists should have learned what happened to the socialists when they finally got power , as they are probably going in a coalition with the conservatives et al. 
  after the election . 
  spending like a social-democrat while having a smaller tax-base than the conservatives does n't work in the long run . 
  ** far right **, 
  laizzes-fare and racism does n't mix . 
  if you 're steady enough in norwegian , you could try to use this : http://www.finansportalen.no/forsikring/bilforsikring, 
  but do you know if your licence is valid in norway ? 
  iirk , the kids in high school taking their licence in the us had to take it again when they came back to norway . 
  you should mention that you 're only looking for us students . 
  i have no experience as a mod ( except for a dead sub i created drunk one night ) , but i 'm thinking about getting some . 
  i 'm usually on reddit at least once a day , mostly evenings gmt +1 . 
  i have a bachelor 's degree in `` economics and leadership '' , something equaliant to business administration . 
  i speak norwegian , but i 'm fluent in english . 
  if i look like a fit , please give me an idea of what kind of stuff you 'd expect me to do . 
  a bit off topic , but roger , do you think glimt will stay in the top league or get relegated next season ? 
  this was n't funny , really ... 
  what 's the difference between peas and semen ? 
  [ ] ( #s `` maddie mccan never got used to the taste of peas '' ), 
  we hear it in the tonality . 
  he is not from the same part of the country as me , so i ca n't pinpoint excactly where he 's from , but i get the general idea where he 's from . 
  as a normal european soaked in us culture , i 'm surprised i 've heard of so few of these attractions . 
  disneyland , las vegas strip , yellowstone , grand canyon , mount rushmore , walt disney world , times square and atlantic city boardwalk are attractions i definetly know . 
  then there are places i 've heard of or might have heard of , but did n't know excatly what they were . 
  like i 've heard of the rocky mountains , but did n't know about the national park , and mall of america got such a generic name that i really ca n't say that i * have n't * heard of it . 
  they are : klondike gold rush national park , rocky mountains national park , mall of america , jefferson memorial ( might mix it with some other president 's memorial ) and blue ridge parkway ( is n't that a racing track ? 
  last fall was my first time at old trafford . 
  travelled with two mates from norway . 
  the game was against wba ... 
  loved it . 
  old trafford 's capacity is 1,5 x the population of my home town , and it 's a  600 km drive to the nearest town with a similar or bigger population . 
  i 've never seen anything like it before . 
  yeah , i 've seen that before . 
  that 's in st. louis , right ? 
  it 's also a [ place in norway ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jotunheimen ), 
  thank you !, 
  i knew i recognized that horse from somewhere . 
  have n't seen that picture in years . 
  four points after the first three games . 
  not quite as good as i expected based on the pre-season friendlies , but at least we 're back in the norwegian top division again . 
  i cold n't watch the first two games , but after what i saw against sogndal yesterday , it should be possible to end the season on the top half of the table . 
  looking forward to see them play rosenborg on monday . 
  they play almost every day ? 
  could someone give me a fast run-down of how a baseball season work ? 
  ( it 's baseball , right ? ), 
  thanks for the answer . 
  is that one season ? 
  if so , how many times do they play a single team ? 
  thanks . 
  how is the home-away-home games put together if they play three rounds ? 
  haha hehe , i 'm 15 and this is funny, 
  i do n't get it . 
  accoring to [ this ] ( http://www.electoralgeography.com/new/en/countries/n/norway/norway-legislative-election-2013.html ) , a lot of the areas marked in red should be blue in norway . 
  h and frp are considered right-wing , while ap and sv are considered left-wing . 
  it 's up to discussion , but you could also argue that both v and krf are right-wing parties due to the political alliances in norway . 
  i believe lofoten and vester\u00e5len is the biggest attraction in northern norway , and it 's beautiful . 
  the typical tour is getting to bod\u00f8 , take the ferry to moskenes and drive east . 
  i 'm in svolv\u00e6r at the moment and yesterday we took a scenic tour through trollfjorden and it was absolutely stunning . 
  some links :, 
  i 'm not disagreeing with op , but i 'm from northern norway where we eat an above average amount of fish , and i 've never heard of soaking fish in milk ( well except in batter for cod 's tounge and stuff like that ) . 
  i mean we even dry fish , put in lye and make the devil 's jelly known as lutefisk , and i 've never heard about the milk and fish connection . 
  am i missing something or is the milk thing not a normal thing to do ? 
  today , 10 % of the population lives north of the split , so if it was the same back then i would n't call it `` very few people '' . 
  i mean , it 's not a lot , but it 's not a neglible part of the population either . 
  kinda remninded me of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mwxe7ky5hs ) . 
  ( strange norwegian comedy sketch ), 
  [ this site ] ( http://www.norskoljeoggass.no/en/facts/the-environment/ ) links to the `` the enviroment '' section in the website of the norwegian oil and gas association . 
  it might give you some insight on how the oil industry regards their enviromental work . 
  i 'm no expert , nut i believe / u/austoaskoy did a good job describing how things are done here . 
  regarding your point about the gulf vs. the norwegian sea , we do n't practice `` ultra deep drilling '' or whatever the techical term is . 
  basically , the techology to make fail-safes for that kind of depth does n't exist ( or did n't during the bp spill ) , so it `` could n't '' happen here , as we do n't drill at those depths . 
  again , i 'm no expert , this is just something i was told by people in the industry during the bp spill . 
  as a norwegian , i have no idea either . 
  i guess maybe it 's the wrong president ? 
  now i see it . 
  thanks !, 
  you can still get surge in norway under the name urge . 
  i do n't know if / r/sodaswap is still being used , buy you might ask them if you 're interested . 
  for some reason we scandinavians are always making really depressing movies . 
  the * childrens movie * [ the brothers lionheart ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_brothers_lionheart_\\ ( 1977_film \\ ) ) ends with the protagonists taking suicide . 
  it was a harsh film for 8 year old me . 
  i love these . 
  thanks !, 
  good post , but i have to nitpick regarding h\u00f8yres main causes . 
  in the election they ran on four causes : education , infrastrukture , health and safer jobs . 
  global extreme poverty halved in 20 years . 
  according to the un , it was met in 2010 . 
  here in norway , we also build our houses out of wood , and we have a ton of '' [ standards ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=no&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=no&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.dibk.no%2fbyggeregler%2fgjeldende-byggeregler%2fveiledning-om-tekniske-krav-til-byggverk%2f&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) '' as the german puts it . 
  we use wood because wood is easily available and insulate better than stone . 
  i think the same goes for most nordic countries . 
  i think the entire point of stone houses being a sign of higher quality is quite strange . 
  i have no data or studies to back this up , but from my point of view the wii lowered the bar for playing video games and broadened the appeal of video games substantially . 
  after the n64 , i kinda driftet away from gaming . 
  a friend of mine had the ps2 and we played a bit of fifa in the early 00 's . 
  other than that , i bought the occational pc game , but i had no interest in actually investing in a dedcated console . 
  me and many people my age , saw gaming as something too time consuming and expensive . 
  it was n't looked down upon , just not something a lot of people still had interest in . 
  when the wii dropped in price it was the first time in a decade i actually became inclined to buy a console . 
  mostly because it seemed like a laugh to play wii sports at parties . 
  then i bought loz : twilight princess , and for the first time in almost a decade i was playing a time consuming and relatively complex game .
