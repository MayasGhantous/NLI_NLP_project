  i 'm so jealous when i see kids being able to play on these great plastic turfs . 
  growing up , we had one outside plastic turf and we only got to use it once a week during winter when the better teams played on the indoor pitch . 
  i just hit gold !, 
  like , ten minutes ago !, 
  except for the few games my mate has been playing with me , i 've been mostly the only non-dps for a week . 
  in high silver . 
  and i main d.va . 
  it took me a fucking month to reach gold after starting on a rank of 1600 . 
  i 've played the game for 32 hours , solo tanking maybe half , no healer for maybe 1/4 of the games . 
  why ??? 
  also , i need to find another class to git guud with as d.va is n't the best on long range damage . 
  i was thinking sombra because of stealth , but she feels unatural . 
  any suggestions ? 
  this kills the bastion ? 
  [ for reference ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqztp8-8wis ), 
  i have a laptop with a 1gb graphics card , and i understand that this is a lot at face value . 
  but at the same time , it does n't come close to `` real '' graphics cards with values in the mb . 
  for instance , if i try to use systemrequirementslab to see if i can play a game , i usually get a message that i do n't have a computer that 's powerfull enough because of my graphics card . 
  this is true , and i ca n't run anything made after 2009 , and then only on the lowest settings . 
  tl ; dr : why is my 1 gb laptop graphics card not comparable to xxx mb graphics cards ? 
  some years ago i watched a thriller/psychological thriller . 
  i do n't remember much except that at one point the bad guy had one or two people locked in an abandoned building , and kept giving them some kind of sleep drug that helped remove the victims sense of time . 
  if i 'd guess , the victims was probably two cops . 
  and i think it turned out that one of the victims was in on the crime . 
  the movie was either american or canadian , and i 'm quite sure i watched it sometime during the last five years . 
  it 's a game for a non-huge console , like nintendo or sega , but might have been atari . 
  the game looked like it was from the 80 's . 
  it was a strategy game where you ( i think ) sendt rockets to attack other nations . 
  i believe all competitors where named something like saddam insane and stuff like that . 
  ( based on real people , but given funny names . ), 
  i have n't played the game in over a decade , so i ca n't remember spesifics , but it was definetly a strategy game . 
  solved : nuclear war, 
  just watched a video on r/video and an image of a sheep came up . 
  i 've seen this image before , but ca n't remember where . 
  maybe some of you have seen this before ? 
  about two years ago , a colleague of mine invited me and some of her friends on a two day trip in a cabin for the weekend . 
  the plan was to drink beer , eat food and play board games and guitar hero . 
  a nice weekend , indeed . 
  we get there in the early afternoon , around 16:00 , and start settling inn . 
  some are outside bringing in wood and tending to the fireplace , some are making the beds ready and some are cleaning the living-room or shoveling snow on the porch . 
  in other words , we were n't all in the same room at the same time for the first hour or two . 
  at around 19:00 , we settle down for dinner . 
  there was taco on the menu , so it was a collective effort to make it ready with people cutting up vegetables , cooking the meat and setting the table . 
  because we all had a few beers during the time at the cabin , people were constantly going to the outhouse . 
  this meant that the first time we 're all together in the same room for a good period of time was during dinner . 
  when we ate , the mood was good and we were all chatty . 
  talking about what we were going to play afterwards and just generally getting to know each other . 
  because we were so many , we had to use some chairs from the kitchen area and eat in the living room . 
  there was a couch with room for three people , one with room for two , a chair plus two chairs from the kitchen . 
  the seating arrangements made it possible for seven people to sit comfortably , without anyone having to use the middle seat in the three-seater . 
  after the feast of cheese , meat and salsa we were all sitting around the table chatting and playing a board game . 
  suddenly , my colleague asked `` hey , where is ... uh ... who sat there ? '', 
  pointing at the empty living room chair . 
  `` oh , that was ... uh ... 
  i 'm not sure . '', 
  one of the guys said . 
  `` it was that guy from ... 
  my colleague answered . 
  we all swore that there were seven of us on the trip , but we could n't remember who the last person was . 
  there was n't a dinner plate for that seating , and it did n't look like anyone had been there . 
  we started to count who came here in what car , and the number we came up with added up to six . 
  at the same time , we had brought in the two chairs from the kitchen because there was n't room enough in the living room , and we had said no to some people wanting to go on the trip because the cabin only had seven beds . 
  we were quite sure that there were seven of us , but there was no evidence of us being more than six people . 
  there was no seventh plate , seventh backpack or anything . 
  still , we had bought enough food for seven people , had made seven beds and were damn sure that someone had been sitting in the empty seat . 
  we had no recollection of this person , but all agreed it was a man , not a woman . 
  this happened during spring in the far north of norway , and if it was n't for the longer hours of daylight and how close the cabin was to our city , we would have been totally freaked out . 
  i still have no idea of who the seventh person should be , but i still find it odd that all of us were sure of there being a seventh person - a man - on this trip . 
  i guess he went out of the matrix , and the matrix adjusted itself . 
  ** tl : dr ** six people was staying in a cabin , but we swore we were seven when we came . 
  so i have n't really played fifa since fifa 00 or something , but i got back to it after i discovered you could play against other people online . 
  at the moment i 'm in 8th division and losing badly . 
  i 'll most certainly get relegated to 9th , where i 'll rule supreme for another 4-6 matches before promotion . 
  this has been the situation for the good part of the month . 
  so my question is , fellow redditors , has anybody else been in this situation and how did you get out of it ? 
  i 've lost hundreds of games already , and it just do n't look like i 'm getting better by just playing . 
  i 'm looking for something like that warm guitar-based sound on the album . 
  if it 's more rock than blues or the other way around , it 's all right . 
  if you look at gaming , there are many major games with a sci-fi setting . 
  mass effect , halo , final fantasy ( sort of ) , are all excamples of games with huge budgets , while there is a limited number of sci-fi movies or tv shows . 
  it seems to me that there is a large imbalance between the number of sci-fi games and tv-shows/movies , and i 've always thought that this was because the high production cost of cgi-heavy media , but it seems like sci-fi is popular enough to make a lot of computer games . 
  any thoghts ? 
  so i 've been thinking . 
  this subreddit is made spesifically for fifa 12 , and i guess that many if not most of us will join fifa 13 this fall . 
  this means that in the long run we 're gon na switch subreddit yearly , probably with new moderators with new takes on moderating . 
  many subreddits needs time to reffine it 's culture as they grow and grow through stability . 
  it would also be easier ( and maybe more attractive ) to have just one . 
  so would n't it be better to have * one * subreddit for fifa games , instead of starting fresh every year ? 
  i see that [ / r/fifa ] ( / r/fifa ) currently has 89 subscribers , and the lastest post all have to do with the videogame . 
  even some of the moderators are the same for that and this subreddit . 
  ** edit ** what does the mods think about this idea ? 
  as my flair suggest i 'm norwegian , and over here there is a lot of resentment regarding the eu , and it does n't look like we 're gon na join it for a long time . 
  so i was wondering , what does our neighbours think of their membership ? 
  i 'd like to hear everything from how business has evolved , to legislations passed or new personal rights/limitations . 
  edit : thread is n't over , but i 'd like to thanks for all the good answers . 
  it 's interesting to see so many pro- and against arguments, 
  i 'm not sure if this is common knowledge , but i have n't seen this kind of lpt after searching , so i thought i should share them . 
  this should not take more than 10-20 minutes , maybe shorter if you get a routine of doing this . 
  i have picked up most of these during barrack-inspections when i was in the airforce , and always do this if i have n't cleaned my apartment in a few days . 
  it basically boils down to : clean counters and the borders of your floor .
