  if you clean stuff you more seldomly clean , the impression becomes better than if you just vacuum your floor . 
  in all rooms : take one of those disposable wipes and clean all the * borders * of your floors . 
  most dust bunnies are in these areas , and these areas are those that stand out as the dirtiest if you have n't vacuumed for a few days . 
  in the bathroom, 
  * wipe the faucet and mirror . 
  if these are clean , the bathroom seems clean . 
  * throw some chlorine in the toilet and shower to get them clean in no-time . 
  rinse the shower and flush the toilet . 
  living room :, 
  * ventilate , and if you have them use aroma essences/candles . 
  it gives you a fresh vibe . 
  * do a quick wipe of the living room table . 
  this is possibly the most important thing to do , as this is where you 'll be spending most of your time . 
  kitchen : it 's hard to make a kitchen seem clean if you 've used it for a few days without cleaning it , but still there are some tips . 
  * clean the counter and top of the stove . 
  * if you have n't got a dishwasher , put any dirty dishes in the sink and fill it with water . 
  it makes it seem tidier . 
  bedroom :, 
  * do your bed if you have n't . 
  * ventilate if you 're not doing it already . 
  * throw all your dirty clothes in the laundry basket . 
  * to be honest , if you 're in a situation where you 're spending time in the bedroom , you probably got a good heads-up . 
  i read an article saying that the norwegian krone could start to deflate in case of further difficulties in the world 's economy . 
  the arguments were that the nok is seen as a safe haven and foregin investors might start to buy so much nok that it would cause deflation because we would lose even more of our competetive edge ect . 
  i have some education in macroeconomics , and according to what i remember without having to look it up , the simple solution would be to combat this deflation by just pressing more money . 
  we have a masive backlog of roads that needs improving , so there would certainly be good use for more money in the economy . 
  i would guess that this is wrong , as deflation is still a problem in some countries , but i ca n't for the life of me understand why . 
  so maybe the good people of reddit would like to enlighten me ? 
  so i used to live in ireland a few years back , and i got myself one of those age cards . 
  last weekend , i lost my debet card that functions as an id card here in norway and i 'm going to the netherlands tomorrow . 
  do you guys know if it 's possible for me to use my old irish id to get into bars and such over there ? 
  i 'm from norway , not the largest country in the world , and i was thinking about where my entertainment comes from . 
  speaking a small language , i 'm accustomed to speaking or listening to another language when i interact online or watch/listen to other entertainment mediums , and i 'd guess that most non-english speaking people would do the same . 
  but it seems like most of my entertainment comes from the us , something that i find weird when i think about the size of the country . 
  europe has more than double the population , and by that logic why is n't 2/3 of my entertainment from the continent ? 
  in global terms , the us is roughly 5 % of the world population , yet it 's dramatically overrepresented in most media . 
  if i turn on my television , most - if not all - foreign shows are made by the us , with the exception of top gear and a few select other british shows . 
  almost every move i see is made in the us , even though the uk also has a sizable movie industry . 
  i sometime see french movies , but i ca n't remember the last time i saw a german or italian movie , for example . 
  even the internet seems to be dominated by the us ( i 'd guess that at least half of reddit is from the us ) , as i only seem to visit american sites unless it 's in norwegian . 
  does anybody have an idea why this is the case ? 
  so i just got my laptop back from repairs and they 've replaced a bunch of the hardware , so i had to reinstall windows 7 . 
  i 've done that and now everythink seems to be working fine , except for my wireless connection that keeps failing . 
  when i turn my laptop on , everything works fine , but after a while ( minutes or hours ) it sais that i need to turn my wireless connection back on . 
  the thing is that i have n't turned it off . 
  this problem seems to get more and more out ot hand and i 'm not sure what to do . 
  i got this computer back from repairs a little while ago , after they had replaced the hard drive , fan , motherboard and a bunch of other stuff . 
  i had to reinstall windows 7 and the computer seems to work soothly except for the connection problem . 
  every time i use a desent amount of bandwith i lose connection to my wireless network . 
  this can be caused by streaming netflix or youtube , downloading from steam or just opening too many browser windows at once . 
  when i run troubleshooting , i 'm told that i 've turned off the physical switch for wireless functions , but that is n't the case . 
  the program that shows me wireless functions says everything is as it should be . 
  some redditors told me to turn off the power saving options for the wireless card , and i 've tried that , but it did n't help . 
  the other units running on my wireless network works perfecly , so it 's probably something weird with the computer . 
  as far as i know it was a mmo similar to minecraft , where you had to learn skills and collect materials to build stuff . 
  i never played the game myself , but it was the craze on / v / some years ago . 
  i think it had 3d graphics and a feature of the game was building towns in the mmo world . 
  i know you had to cooperate with other people to succed , as in , some players were good at carpentry while otheres were hunters etc. 
  i believe it was popular during the same time that dwarf fortress became famous . 
  stuff like [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/top/?sort=top&t=week ) is just pendantic , or how ever it 's spelled in english . 
  i live in northern norway , and it 's almost 30 degrees celcius outside . 
  because i live so far north i have sunlight 24/7 , so it 's warm . 
  really warm . 
  i also live by the coast . 
  my house is made out of wood and is supposed to keep the heat in , not let it go like a brick house , so that makes things extra warm . 
  i 'm used to -20 degrees in the winter and stuff like that , and on a normal summer 's day it never goes beyond 22 degrees , ( normally it 's 12-17 degrees ) so this is new for me . 
  at least for being in my home town . 
  this is both amazing and annoying at the same time . 
  thank you for the time . 
  ** a short history lesson : **, 
  2007 was the first time in years that mj\u00f8ndalen played in norwegian 3rd tier football after getting promoted from 4th tier the season before . 
  2007 was also the year brann won the league , and the year before they had a ( in post-90 's norwegian terms ) successful run in the uefa cup . 
  ** right now : **, 
  mj\u00f8ndalen just beat brann 3-0 in front of less than 3000 people at what i guess is their sold-out stadium after drawing 1-1 at brann stadium . 
  i 'm not even sure if the mj\u00f8ndalen players are all full-time footballers . 
  brann was talking about winning the gold before the season started . 
  you can find a recap of the match in norwegian [ here ] ( http://direkte.vg.no/studio/vgsporten#positionid=3 ) . 
  not sure what more to say . 
  i 'm in shock , and i do n't support any of the two teams . 
  football is crazy !, 
  pull-ups ? 
  i 'd be really grateful if someone could tell me what to do , or if what i 'm trying to do is even possible . 
  after a six year long break , i 'm back in my masters program in business admin , and it seems like i 've either forgotten something , or i 'm just doing something wrong . 
  i 'm trying to solve this equation for x :, 
  4500000000 = -18000000000 + \u03a3 x/1 ,04 ^ n , where * n * is -  40, 
  i 've managed to solve it in excel and i think i 'd be able to solve it with a scientific calculator . 
  but in a school exam , i 'd only be allowed to use a calculator that ca n't do equations . 
  the formula is a net present value formula , and i 'm trying to find the average yearly income i need to make 4,5 bn with an initial investment of 18 bn when the inflation is 4 % a year . 
  does anyone know how to solve this ? 
  so for the last few weeks my internet connection has been getting slower and slower , and i 'm now at a point where i ca n't even stream netflix on an ipad . 
  i 'm used to the odd slow-down , but nothing so consistent as this , and then only when i was dealing with a faulty router . 
  i 'll try to be as spesific as possible , but bear in mind that my knowledge of this stuff is a bit spotty and english is not my native language . 
  i have a adsl 15/1 connection and in normal operating mode i get somewhere between 10-13 mbps down and almost the full megabit up . 
  i did a series of speed tests while the computer was wired to the modem , and while i got ok download speeds , the upload speed was between 0,13 and 0,45 mbps . 
  a few days ago i called the isp and at that time the speeds meassured were completely decent . 
  i have a jensen air link 59300 wireless router that ca n't be more than 2-3 years old , and was bought when i had similar issiues and had to retire my acient purple linksys . 
  i have checked wich channels/frequencys that are in use in my neighborhood and i 'm currently the only one using the channel i 'm on . 
  i 've tried this :, 
  - reset the modem and router, 
  - reset the network to default mode , so the password and name has been changed,
