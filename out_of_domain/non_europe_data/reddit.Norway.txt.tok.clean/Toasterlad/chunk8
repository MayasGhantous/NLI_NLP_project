  as a norwegian ( we share the same gene pool as the swedish ) i would say that people are on average better looking than the rest of europe . 
  if we say that the average person is descent looking ( a 5/10 ) , the average scandinavian is rather cute ( 6-7/10 ) . 
  imho , we have less properly unattractive people than the rest of europe ( < 4 ) . 
  at the same time , i 'd say that one in ten european people are a 10/10 , maybe the ratio in scandinavia is one in fifteen . 
  i interrailed two years ago , and except when we were in a town square with a lot of restaurants , no place had people that really stood out as more attractive on average than scandinavia . 
  we were in germany , poland , the czech republic , hungary , italy , austria , france and england . 
  well ... its hard to generalize an entire population , and this might be because i 'm a straight male , but english men ( i was only in london , so ca n't say the uk ) stood out as less attractive than the average scandinavian male . 
  proportionaly , a lot of them had this lanky , freckle-faced , crooked nose thing going for them . 
  regarding women , i 'd say that english and italian women was on average less attractive than the girls at home . 
  espescially the ones in their 30 's or 40 's . 
  on the flip side , italian women in their early 20 's looked gorgeous compared to the average scandinavian . 
  hot food is frowned upon and other guests might complain to the staff if it stinks up the place ( hot crisps are ok , a burger is not ) , but a salad or a sandwich is no problem . 
  * kommune * is municipality in english in case anyone is wondering . 
  also , lotr was released in norway before the us because of the time difference . 
  it had a global release on the same day . 
  this is an exception , though the delay seems to be shorter than a decade ago . 
  i see no reason why they would throw you out unless it contained garlic soup ( is that a thing ? ), 
  or something really smelly . 
  the rule of thumb is that you can bring anything that does n't cause discomfort for the other guests . 
  alcohol is an exception , because you 're not allowed to drink in public and the places where alcohol is ok have to think about their licence . 
  this is something i might expect from a gas station manager on a power rush , not a huge bank/finance institution . 
  from my limited knowlege of workplace enviroment laws , this has to be completely illegal . 
  i have n't played as many ff games as many people here , but i 've played most of the ones for the snes , 7 , a little bit of 8 , one to the ps2 ( 9 ? ), 
  and 13 . 
  i do n't think you can properly compare the 2d games with the 3d games . 
  dragon quest has kind of tried to stay true to the old ones , while ff took a new direction when it hit 3d . 
  what my biggest problem with 13 ( and for that matter the one i played on the ps2 ) , was that the games have kind of lost their soul . 
  i found 13 quite sad and reflective while ff7 - the oldest 3d i 've played - had a bit more fun with it self . 
  the general mood and more quirky characters made the game * deeper * in a sense . 
  13 seemed a bit sand-blasted . 
  it was a beatiful game with ok mechanics , but the characters had no real debt and the world , while * techincally * varied , used much of the same lighting and colour palette everywhere . 
  this made the areas look more similar than what they felt in 7 . 
  the music did n't really stand out , either . 
  i would n't say that the games are getting worse for western audiences , but i think they 're catering to more of a niche audience . 
  at the same time , i have no ideas on how to make the games feel more like the older games without doing more of a fantasy-setting rather than sci-fi/semi-cyberpunk . 
  we do n't speak english in our daily life , if that 's what you mean . 
  as in , not at all . 
  we have our own language for that . 
  that said , most people under 60 would speak english quite well and we subtitle foregin language tv-shows instead of dubbing them , so you should be all right . 
  i 'm from northern norway , so have n't been that much in denmark and finland .

  good work , puckhead73 !, 
  i 'm not sure if this is eli5 enough , but i 'll try . 
  let 's start by defiing stocks . 
  a stock is a piece of the company , originaly sold by the company , with promises of future pay-offs . 
  after the first time a company `` makes '' stocks ( known as an ipo ) , they become second hand stocks . 
  ( this is the things dow jones , ftse and other stock exchanges `` sell '' ) so basically , a stock is a thing you buy that gives you a little bit of money every year , depending on how much money the company on the name of the stock makes that year . 
  now , all the potential owners start to guess on how much money they 'll get this year from the stock , and how much money they can get in the future . 
  when they do this , they think about the interest rate , the return of interest on bonds , how much money the stock-company is making , how their competitors look and a few other things . 
  all these things determine how much money they are willing to pay for a stock in that company . 
  they think `` i 'll pay 40 usd for that stock . '', 
  at the same time , many people already own stocks in the company and want to sell . 
  ( why they want to sell is not important ) . 
  they all have thoughs on how much money they get every year from the stock as well , so they think that `` i will sell that stock if someone is willing to pay more than 30 usd for it ) . 
  there are many people trying to make money on stocks , and sometimes the people does n't understand what business the company is in and how much or little money that the company is going to make in , say , 5 years time . 
  if the professional stock buyers start to think the stocks are going to give them much money in the future , they start to buy . 
  then the media gets a hold of it , and begin to tell normal people that this kind of stock is going to become more valuble , because all the people that work with stocks are buying them . 
  now it 's no longer about how much money the stock gives you every year , but how much the * price * of the stock is going to be worth later . 
  this makes many many millions of people that does n't understand how a stock functions , start buying them . 
  so a lot of people are starting to think `` this stock cost me 50 usd today , but is going to be worth 100 usd in a year . '', 
  after a while , some people get sceptic because they have to pay so much money for a stock and they do n't want to buy it . 
  then people start talking about how hard it is to sell that stock , and even more people becomes sceptical . 
  some people that owns it needs to sell it because they have mortages and other things to do with their money , so they start to cut the price their willing to sell it for . 
  this makes the stock fall in value , because nobody would pay 70 usd for a stock is someone else is selling it for 50 usd . 
  suddenly , people do n't want to pay as much as they did before for stocks and their value falls . 
  when this happens to many stocks at the same time ( like it did in the beginning of the 00 's ) , or happens to very very large companies ( like it did in ' 08 ) , this causes a crash . 
  the you-and-me 's do n't want to spend more money on stocks becase we 've lost a lot of savings and the professional stock-people do n't want to spend money om them either , because they also lost money and want to wat untill stocks gives them more money for each dollar they use buying them ( roi ) than other things they can use their money on . 
  ** note ** this is an extremely simplified version of a stock crash , and i have n't touched on the subject of finance markeds being an intermediary between loaners-savers investers-spenders in my example . 
  the consequence of this is that the `` blood flow '' of money from people with money to the people that need money starts to sirculate slower , hampering economic growth . 
  the completely [ standard crisps/chips ] ( http://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/fil:kartoffelchips-1.jpg ) . 
  they taste like fat and salt , much like cold french fries . 
  on the other hand , if it 's a syntetic product like pringles or [ the think super-crispy kind ] ( http://bloggfiler.no/eldeen.blogg.no/images/273387-8-1325712691865.jpg ) , i like them . 
  we have these really strict consumer protection laws here in norway that * almost * make any kind of product insurance obsolete . 
  basically , your phone or computer are expected to last for at least five years and if they do n't , the company has to replace them . 
  there are some things not covered ( water damage , viruses ect ) , but most things are . 
  the last two times i 've bought a new laptop , i 've been told by dell and sony that i * need * this and that insurance or `` follow-up plan '' , and that if i do n't buy it i have to buy a completely new computer in case i get problems . 
  funny thing , when i called dell about my old laptop 's power cable being broken for the third time in three years ( this was because it got a hard beating from the books in my backpack ) dell had to send me a new one at no cost and get it delivered at my door , even though i had no extra insurance . 
  ** about the academical aspects **, 
  i study at uin and i 've only heard good things about the ( marine ) biology programme . 
  i study business , so i 'm not an expert on the workings of the faculty of biosciences and aquaculture , but some of the high-end research going on there is apparently world leading . 
  i think it 's in the field of molecular biology , but i might be mistaken .
