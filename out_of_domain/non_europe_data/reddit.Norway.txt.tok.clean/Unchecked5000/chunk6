  thats the thing , the more homogenous a country is , generally the more stable it is . 
  thats why protestants and catholics fought inside their own country . 
  but when shit hit the fan , orthodox ( russia ) , protestant ( great britain ) allied against catholics ( napoleon ), 
  this happened constantly , britain and france defended ottomans against russia many times , the wars were n't religious at all . 
  if you say so ... 
  why are you bringing up what turkey has done before to the kurds ? 
  at the end of the day , for whatever reason it is , pkk has hurt turkey more than isis has , simple as that . 
  as a kid we loved ketchup flavoured ruffles , we also have onion flavoured ruffles and all the brands alpmighty listed . 
  pringles is also popular . 
  especially onion/sour cream flavour . 
  i did n't say events happen in a vacuum . 
  i just said that at the end of theh day , turkey has suffered more from pkk than isis . 
  americans for example probably do n't care about basque seperatists , but they care a lot about al qaeda , and vice versa , spain did n't suffer al qaeda attacks , so they would put more importance to eta than al qaeda . 
  why do you think it did not go down as expected ? 
  what do you think the channel expected ? 
  first of all , ulusal tv is an anti akp channel , and they are pro tkp and \u0130p ( turkish communist party and labor party ) . 
  they are vehemently against pretty much anything akp , and they are totally against the whole actions of the state in syria . 
  so i 'm sure the channel went in there , maybe not expecting , but wanting such answers . 
  turkmen are turkic . 
  rojava is very much made out to be an utopia by some very strange users who prepare copy pastas to show how absolutely amazing whatever it is they support . 
  we ca n't talk about how flawed rojava is or is n't . 
  they still are n't a proper country , they fought against invaders and they are still in danger of being attacked . 
  after the country stabilises , and the politics , policies , and the different factions settles in we can only see how stable and advanced a country rojava will become . 
  also , i really dislike this '' mountain turks '' myth that everybody who read it on reddit once act like it is a reality . 
  the term was used by kenan evren , a guy who is disliked by pretty much the entire country , the guy even forbid female civil servants from wearing pants , he was nutjob who came with a coup , what he said while is relevant , it is the words of a dictator . 
  he even said , for a 17 year old leftist , '' should we feed him and not hang him ? '' . 
  and you put forth this crazy dictators words as if it was a reality of turkey since it was created . 
  i 'm turkish . 
  yeah anarchists and communists are getting a bit a annoying . 
  i 'm not saying rojava ca n't be a good place , but rojava is in war at the moment , the good and bad things that happen in rojava wo n't determine what kind of place it will be after the war is over . 
  he was the ** president of turkey ** beacuse he led a ** military coup ** and forced himself , he was n't elected . 
  why are you omitting that ? 
  i 'm very sure you know how he came to be the president . 
  also linking todayszaman is no different than linking dailysabah . 
  the majority of people here hate isis , i 'm pretty sure they would hate the tribal leader of dersim who led a rebellion because they could n't practice their extremist beliefs as they wished and because he did n't want to pay taxes to the republic of turkey . 
  we are talking about the fact that the state never ever pushed a '' kurds are mountain turks '' type of policy . 
  they were words ushered by a dictator who brought himself into power with a military coup . 
  there may be people who took his words to heart and believed it but it was not a state policy . 
  those people that probably thought it made sense were nationalists to begin with . 
  why do you bring up the kurdish language in all this ? 
  we are arguing about something else , and you just bring up another point . 
  what are you trying to argue ? 
   went to jail over the kurdish language, 
  so no , i did n't , you brought it up . 
  i bet your grandad also wouldve said '' greeks offered the islands free of charge but ismet rejected because he was drunk '', 
  dat feeling when you vote for akp from belgium, 
  because the highest poll result akp had was % 44 , by an akp favouring poller, 
  rest were around % 40 . 
  i honestly think they pulled some shit, 
  and besides that , i love how people hated on mhp voters , its better now that people dont vote for mhp right ? 
  great job , it 's similar to hating on hdp voters , hdp voters helped us keep democracy for at least a few months ... 
  a lot of people on this sub take less reliable twitter personas words as given , fuat avni is someone who has said a lot of things that came to be true , altho he did also say some things that didnt come to be true, 
  ihaleler , el alt\u0131 yat\u0131r\u0131mlar , stealing peoples property and homes by deeming them as '' unsafe incase of an earthquake '' even though there is no danger of an earthquake in those areas , not to mention they actually are safe if an earthquake occurs . 
  the airport constructions , and especially something you should know ozsisisi ( i think you were from bing\u00f6l ? 
  i had a friend who was the son of an a\u011fa from there , and they voted akp because they received a lot from akp ) , the contracts given to kurdish '' a\u011fas '' to build roads in the east , those a\u011fas force people under their influence to vote for akp . 
  there are a lot of benefitors from akp . 
  there is a huge rise in rich people in turkey . 
  in ankara i see quite a lot of '' ak '' plates on audis , bmws , mercs . 
  these people make their workers etc vote for akp too, 
  highly doubt it . 
  i highly doubt that democratic confederalism will still be in effect after the war is over and treaties are settled . 
  there is no way any ideology with a little bit of communism or socialism in it will take foothold in the middle east . 
  you have to be joking , what kind of socialism in there in assad 's syria or saddam 's iraq ? 
  both were highly corrupt countries with rampant smuggling and governmental contracts were given to political allies or family members . 
  and besides that , they both are n't really welfare states . 
  edit :, 
  and tbh , the reason why i think socialism will never take effect is because of the mentality of the region , as well as socialism and communism just like any other ideology being quite open to corruption . 
  also i highly doubt the u.s or europe would be fond of such ideologies . 
  not op , but i highly doubt the u.s will '' abandon '' turkey any time soon , turkey 's contributions to nato are as large as many european nations . 
  if i 'm honest , that view is mostly shared by people who wish ill against turkey and they have n't come to that conclusion by rational thinking . 
  erdo\u011fan had incredible support from the u.s and eu . 
  and he still was jailing journalists and the military left and right during that period . 
  the islamisation had started as soon as akp took power in 2002 , benefiting greatly from the % 10 election treshold to have absolute majority in the parliament . 
  and besides , i ca n't help but feel at times that turkey is acting as a u.s proxy currently , where turkey supports groups that the u.s wants to support , but can not publically . 
  and in that regard , i think the u.s does not really mind turkey shooting down the russian jet . 
  like you 've said , i feel like if things are left as they are , russia and iran are going to have a lot of gains , with iraq and syria obviously consolidating their power and remembering their russian and iranian allies . 
  honestly i find that article to have a very biased tone , not saying the article is wrong either . 
  but the fact that the author works for rt is important as well , this article could 've been much more if he had tried to be a bit more objective in his word choices . 
  i do n't consider russia to be any more '' righteous '' than turkey or u.s.a. all sides are in a political struggle , if russia could bolster assad as the sole ruler of syria without harming isis , they would . 
  it just is so isis is in the way of assad . 
  i dont see anything that implies this is turkish ? 
  its just a truck with goods, 
   a nation that went far enough to gas and wipe out an entire province . 
  this didnt happen, 
  gas ? 
  there are no '' the kurds '' as the media has , and certain users on this and other subs tried to portray . 
  there are islamist parties in krg parliament , as well as leftist ones . 
  there is the marxist pkk and akp voting kurds in s.e turkey . 
  most kurds , on this sub live in europe , have minimal ties with actual kurdistan . 
  the reality of kurdistan is that they are pretty much like turkey with a loud but smaller '' leftist '' populace and loads of centre-right , right wing or religious population . 
  i 'm sure someone will come and say '' but they are united in their desire for independence '' , maybe , maybe not . 
  but kurdistan will definitely not be the place many expect it to be , whatever they expect . 
  you , me , not a lot of people on this sub are experts . 
  just because your biased view is supported by many people on this sub does n't mean that view is cold hard fact . 
  i know and have plenty kurdish friends and even some distant relatives and some ties to '' kurdistan '' and diyarbak\u0131r which i can tell you about in a pm if you really care about it , but that is not what i based my opinion on , if you just use wikipedia itself , you can reach the conclusion that a lot of kurds are conservative and some are islamists . 
  krg parliament has islamist parties , kurds in turkey vote akp , honor killings , child brides are very common in s.e turkey . 
  although not common in s.e turkey , other parts of kurdistan practise fgm . 
  and there are obviously kurdish fighters in isis . 
  so are you saying that , pkk/ypg/kck can put aside their ideological differences with barzani or islamist kurds and live in a democratic country ? 
  are you saying that kurds are united ?
