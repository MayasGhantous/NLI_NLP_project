  mine looks fn but is ft, 
  from the comments of an article about conpiretards on the sandy hook massacre . 
  `` weird how conspiracy theories tend to all originate in the us ... where education and healthcare is like that of the developing world and where bible thumping morons cling desperately to their guns . 
  ... it 's almost like there 's a conspiracy to ignore facts to preserve belief and stop reasonable minded people from enacting gun controls . '', 
  just tought it was a quite interesting point . 
  so yea . 
  going to a cabin on top of a bloody mountain without internet . 
  and im looking for some offline games . 
  cities skylines is currently on sale right now , and i wondered if i could play it whitout internet aka offline . 
  ( is it hard to do ? ), 
  so just picked up the game . 
  im at such a low level i cant even start building my city without going bankrupt . 
  i think about watching some touturials and such . 
  anyone got som usefull tips ? 
  just 5 minutes ago i dropped my ancient samsung galaxy s4 on to the ground and the screen cracked a little bit but you can hardly see it . 
  the screen also went black , but the phone is still alive as in the blue little lamp still works and the phone vibrates . 
  wat to do ? 
  take it to the same place where i bought it ? 
  and what may the issue be ? 
  so since i like racing and ac is on a 50 % discount i tought id buy it . 
  however , i dont have a wheel , pedals and shifter yet . 
  so is it playable with a keyboard and what wheel , pedals and shifter should i buy ? 
  is this possible or im i wrong . 
  i only searched fro dust 2 , cache and mirage and i somehow enden up on nuke ? 
  so i havnt played in a long time and i was wondering what has changed ? 
  did they add anything new ? 
  did they fix something ? 
  new features ? 
  no long essays pls . 
  thanks :d, 
  how far have you come with using a keyboard and mouse ? 
  im currently lvl . 
  29 and usually playing better than most people in silver and upwards even tho they are using controllers wich allows them more precise movements and so on . 
  and im i missing out on something because im not using a controller ? 
  so i havnt played in almost a year . 
  i had 42 hours in game and i really enjoyed it . 
  however , has anything changed ? 
  have they added anything new ? 
  and is the game still alive ? 
  any new weapons maybe ? 
  or maps ?

  would make the gun more usefull . 
  as i like playing with guns that arnt popular . 
  so , yea i need to be able to do as many push ups as i can in one week . 
  what do i do ? 
  a couple of years ago i could easily do 50 proper push ups . 
  now , however i can only do 15 proper push ups . 
  how can i atleast double this number ? 
  anyone got any programs ? 
  i have a great gym availble , any machines i can use ? 
  thanks, 
  we could seriously use some proper islands in rust . 
  mostly small islands that arnt to far away from the mainland . 
  examples : https://www.google.no/search?q=small+tropical+islands&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=x&sqi=2&ved=0ahukewivusri6ypuahxjlswkhutwdrwq_auibigb&biw=1396&bih=691#imgrc=htz1yvk-biasrm: and https://www.google.no/search?q=small+tropical+islands&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=x&sqi=2&ved=0ahukewivusri6ypuahxjlswkhutwdrwq_auibigb&biw=1396&bih=691#tbm=isch&q=small+island+atolls&imgrc=a1ybrspj4xwjbm: some atolls would also be cool . 
  oh and some sort of really slow rusty boats would also be nice . 
  so , none of my friends can play right now . 
  and i have yet to start on the coop missions .
