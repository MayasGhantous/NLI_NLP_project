  part of the money would have gone to the government through taxes . 
  since the country is a democracy , it could be argued he stole money from the entire population of the us . 
  they missed a pretty obvious one ; a ring that was worn on a daily basis still had dna traces of villains bond defeated years ago . 
  and apparently the person wearing it only shook hands with those specific people and nobody else in their massive criminal network . 
  probably a burglar . 
  if he was a kidnapper or rapist , he might have grabbed / u/helenakelleher right then and there . 
  my guess is that he pretended to sell magazines to scout the neighbourhood and find out who was home and whether someone left the house and forgot to lock . 
  since that house only had a 14 year old , and the door was open , he figured he could just walk in , grab something valuable and leave without too much trouble . 
  6th commandment : thou shalt not kill . 
  got ta be pretty twisted in the head to not understand an absolute rule with 4 simple words . 
  there 's also the golden rule , which basically says the same thing . 
  as far as islam goes , there 's this :, 
   the quran says , `` but if the enemies incline towards peace , do you also incline towards peace . 
  and trust in god !, 
  for he is the one who hears and knows all things . '' ( 8:61 ) the quran chapter `` the cow , '' 2:190 , says , `` fight in the way of god against those who fight against you , but begin not hostilities . 
  god loveth not aggressors . '', 
   the prophet muhammad counseled ... `` do not be people without minds of your own , saying that if others treat you well you will treat them well , and that if they do wrong you will do wrong to them . 
  instead , accustom yourselves to do good if people do good and not to do wrong ( even ) if they do evil . '' ( al-tirmidhi ), 
  the wolf of wall street , in case anyone 's wondering . 
  found a trailer breakdown on google . 
  [ spoiler ], 
  apparently they 're fighting magical black goo zombies and a witch called the enchantress . 
  that does n't explain the jokers role , the damaged buildings or the bullets hitting their helicopter , so there 's probably more to the story . 
  the rope guy , going by the trailers . 
  he only appeared at the start of the mission . 
  a fish eye view means you might be able to see anyone standing along the wall on the side of the door waiting to ambush you . 
  could be handy , if you 're living in a splinter cell game . 
  worth mentioning that it was a stone coffin . 
  meaning that the child zombie must have had teeth that were either made of metal or magically enhanced . 
  we 're ruled by gay people , ethnic minorities and people with physical and/or mental disabilities ? 
  and it does n't attract hobos . 
   i tried to learn and promptly gave up , and i 'm not cute . 
  try again . 
  not knowing how to swim is almost as risky as growing up with anti-vaccer parents . 
  and you only have yourself to blame if you end up on a news report as the loser who fell off a pier or into a swimming pool and drowned just a few meters from land . 
  better to recreate it from scratch . 
  this way their dreams come true , egypt gets another tourist attraction and archeologists can leave this one in the ground . 
  erecting the original means future archeologists ca n't reexamine it with better technology and uncover more information . 
  keep a backup , too . 
  the passwords are stored offline , so you 're one crashed harddrive or virus attack away from getting locked out of everything . 
  the password file is less than 100kb , so you can simply put in in your dropbox or google drive folder and have it backed up automatically . 
  maybe he was joking ? 
  here 's the original scene in 1080p , along with some other goldblum footage from the movie . 
  ca n't access the picture for some reason . 
  stick him in a hazmat suit , then use him as a wmd ? 
  more likely he 'd just kill him , though . 
  the kid 's ability would be dangerous to magneto himself . 
   [ this guy ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/sublime_ ( marvel_comics \\ ) ) is the only logical reason . 
  mutants would be a weaponized ruling class in any other world . 
  fixed the link . 
  next time , use a \\ \\ before a ) that 's part of an url . 
  it tells the code to treat the following symbol as text . 
  xk class basically means end of the world , like the apocalypse . 
  ck means reality changes irreversibly . 
  this could mean a significant changes to history or the laws of physics . 
  zk means end of at least one reality . 
  direct link to the bonus image . 
  maybe he killed a baby bear and made a suit out of it 's skin ? 
   experts have found evidence of the indus valley civilization being at least 8,000 years old and not 5,500 years old , taking root well before the egyptian ( 7000bc to 3000bc ) and mesopotamian ( 6500bc to 3100bc ) civilizations . 
  8000 years old means it started in 6000 bc , well * after * the egyptian and mesopotamian civilizations . 
  edit : the years given for ancient egypt and mesopotamia seem to be wrong . 
  the earliest year on [ wikipedia ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/ancient_egypt#/history ) for the first signs of civilization in ancient egypt is 5500 bc . 
  the earliest year on [ this article ] ( http://www.timemaps.com/civilization-ancient-mesopotamia ) on ancient mesopotamia is 5000 bc . 
   you 'd expect to see some lights go off in some of the offices ... there should be blurs of people in the pictures , etc. 
  they may have taken still pictures with a camera on a tripod , and chained them together to make a gif . 
  this means they have time to prepare each frame , turn off the relevant lights and clear out before the next picture is taken . 
  you have a point about the sun , though . 
  i 'm guessing photoshop . 
  probably hired to do a viral marketing campaign by 3m . 
  / r/hailcorporate, 
  super visible but also animated , which could be bad for performance . 
  and it only takes one small mistake to destroy anything below it . 
  i used to make `` roads '' with smaller pillars/beacons made of cobblestones and torches placed high in the terrain . 
  the limited draw distance makes it easier to find one of a half dozen smaller pillars than a single giant one . 
  til there 's an upvote hidden in the flag of israel . 
  does this mean the jews have been secretly conspiring to create reddit for millennia ? 
  did n't nsa and cia speak out against the ban on encryption too ? 
   wikipedia says for a short moment it can rival the power output of a type-ii civilization . 
   using nuclear explosion tests as a perspective , tsar bomba , the largest nuclear weapon ever detonated , released an estimated 57 megaton yield ; even a type i civilization makes use of roughly 25 megatons of tnt equivalent a second . 
  a type ii civilization controls 4 \u00d7 10 ^ 9 times more energy ( 4 billion hydrogen bombs per second ) , and a type iii 10 ^ 11 times more yet . 
  most humans could n't survive in the wild easily . 
  does that mean we 've domesticated ourselves ? 
  / r/writingprompts, 
  he 's a nazi ? 
   national socialism ( german : nationalsozialismus ) , more commonly known as nazism ( / \u02c8n\u0251\u02d0ts\u026az\u0259m , \u02c8n\u00e6 - / ) , is the ideology and practice associated with the 20th-century german nazi party , nazi state , as well as other far-right groups . 
  jack seems to be doing alright . 
  he even starred in a few movies . 
  from further up the front page : [ [ psa ] do n't get overconfident .

  easy to obtain maybe ? 
  most doctors and pharmacists would n't be willing to provide him with poison or advice on how to commit suicide . 
  he also got surgery on his leg in pakistan . 
  my guess is that he lived there , got an easily available poison and then traveled to the uk to kill himself . 
  jesus had a perfectly good shaving knife but used a disposable razor instead . 
  that 's kind of like having a porsche in the garage but choosing to ride on a crowded bus with the plebes . 
  did n't get a good shave either , but that 's to be expected when he does n't use lather . 
  cell phone cameras are generally aimed at a table , the ceiling or the insides of your pocket , though . 
  only way they 'd be useful for surveillance within an apartment would be if you had some kind of charging station that prop it up and gives it a good view of its surroundings . 
  tell him to install [ reddit enhancement suite ] ( https://redditenhancementsuite.com/ ) . 
  there 's a function in the settings console called filtereddit that can be used to block submissions based on subreddits , keywords and domains .
