   if the arabs ever get together, 
  that 's basically what happened in the [ six day war . 
  ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/six-day_war ) did n't end well for the arabians . 
  the article only says people have to write or call their isp and request access . 
  that 's about as public as discussing health issues with a doctor or economic issues with the bank . 
  is there going to be publicly available lists of porn watchers ? 
  do people have to post a notification about this on facebook ? 
  is the isp going to track down a customers parents and tell them their son or daughter is a pervert ? 
  they could have an option on the ballot for `` none of the above '' . 
  everyone who showed up to vote would be registered for the tax credit , but people could still choose to be non-voters . 
  `` the best way to stop being a christian is to read the bible . '', 
  \\ - / r/atheism , probably, 
  a real soldier with a mauve/purple uniform , `` eidetic memory '' , who graduated from a `` program '' ? 
  sounds more like he 's from a different sci fi universe . 
  the vikings could sing while you 're sneaking near their camps . 
  we 'll play as the monsters , so it 's more like `` for loki '' or `` for utgard '' . 
  i tried googling it myself , but i have n't found anything . 
  there 's a wikipedia page on [ people with eidetic memory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:fictional_people_with_eidetic_memory ) , but none of the people listed live in universes with mauve uniforms or something called `` the program '' . 
   for the purpose of article 5 , an armed attack on one or more of the parties is deemed to include an armed attack :, 
   - on the territory of any of the parties in europe or north america , on the algerian departments of france [ 2 ] ,, 
   - on the territory of or on the islands under the jurisdiction of any of the parties in the north atlantic area north of the tropic of cancer ;, 
   - on the forces , vessels , or aircraft of any of the parties , when in or over these territories or any other area in europe in which occupation forces of any of the parties were stationed on the date when the treaty entered into force or the mediterranean sea or the north atlantic area north of the tropic of cancer . 
  the nato treaty does n't seem to force other members to declare war if someone attacks forces that are occupying part of another country . 
  i 'm guessing the us would stay out of it and try to encourage a diplomatic solution . 
  then again , trump or hillary might be president when this war starts , and i honestly do n't know if one of them would be crazy enough to intervene . 
  if landmass was everything , we 'd all be speaking russian . 
  tl ; dw : it survived . 
  5 of them jumped off , 2 did n't make it . 
  maybe all but one or two of them , then they bring the rest back after capturing the infinity gauntlet . 
  at least it 's honest . 
  gives new employees a hint at what kind of workplace they can expect . 
  this seems kind of relevant too . 
  they 'll return disappointed . 
  not much challenge in beaming down into a shopping mall or airport and firing a few blaster rounds into the crowd . 
  i suppose they could beam down into an active warzone and hunt guerilla fighers or american commandos , but how would an alien with no prior knowledge of earth know where to look ? 
   if the aliens have a culture of honoring life as life ... 
  let 's just hope they value sapient life more than all the animals we kill , abuse and enslave . 
   ... since it can kill any personal drive for betterment ... 
  a star trek like society focused on exploration , research and the betterment of their society as a whole could still exist . 
  there 's no reason one-ness with the universe would destroy the drive to gather knowledge or understand how the universe works . 
  i ca n't imagine a reason species like that would want to destroy mankind , though . 
  unless they needed a habitable planet for a scientific experiment . 
  she could supplement her income by selling them online . 
  she could also paint the ugly ones and sell them as art . 
  this should be a standard feature in civ maps . 
  a city state called shangri-la that 's always surrounded by mountains and almost impossible to reach . 
  you could also write that as :, 
  he was probably a member of the [ varangian guard ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/varangian_guard ) , which was basically the royal guard of the emperor . 
  most of the members were germans and scandinavians . 
  in other words , all we need is a terrorist attack on congress and the white house when everyone except bernie is present . 
  there 's still hope . 
  probably came there as a trader then . 
  in any case , i doubt vikings raided constantinople and had enough downtime in between plundering and killing byzantine soldiers to carve runes in the hagia sophia . 
   the origin of the word is uncertain , although it appears to be connected with thieves ' cant , or the contraction of `` shortened language '' into s ` lang . 
  a scandinavian origin has been proposed ( compare , for example , norwegian slengenavn , which means `` nickname '' ) , but is discounted by the oxford english dictionary based on `` date and early associations '' . 
  jonathan green however agrees with the possibility of a scandinavian origin , suggesting the same root as that of sling , which means `` to throw '' , and noting that slang is a thrown language - a quick , honest way to make your point . 
  indestructible skin * and * glowy fist power ? 
  guess we know who the final villain is . 
  and that there 's not a [ deep crevasse ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5gd5zaoloi ) under it and it 's not [ hanging over the edge of a cliff . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgd01qjjnr0&amp;t=1m13s ), 
  it 's called crawling , and even babies can do it . 
  in my experience , the key to quitting sleep is to find something so distracting and addicting that you forget all about it . 
  the civilization games are particularly good with their `` just one more turn '' mechanic . 
  but in all of them freeman is the relatively normal guy while cumberbatch is the abnormal . 
  could be a [ kill bill reference . 
  ] ( http://killbill.wikia.com/wiki/crazy_88 ), 
  the movie version was a four-legged dragon in the first film , then they changed him to a two-legged wyvern . 
  the book version , which can be seen in [ thror 's map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/j0fnda3.jpg ) , has four legs . 
  you know what this build is missing ? 
  an elaborate lava beacon on the roof . 
  not just him . 
  every person with admin access would have to be subpoenaed . 
  as you can see on [ this list ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/enhancement/comments/37n7s2/heres_a_list_of_all_the_admins_and_former_admins/ ) from 2015 , there 's quite a lot of them . 
  i just hope they keep logs or something that admins ca n't change . 
  they can also dig under it , catapult over it , build a siege tower , bribe or blackmail the border guards , get a tourist visa and simply not go back after it ends , etc. 
  the shape of their earlobes are different . 
  probably different women . 
  2020 - the year when bernie dies of old age , hillary loses for the third time and a former kkk leader is elected president . 
  wikipedia says she died on the 24th and fidel died on the 25th . 
  probably same reason they have n't overthrown or assassinated kim in north korea . 
  we 've got them in norway too . 
  they 're probably sold in the airport kiosk , so you can just come here , buy a dozen bags and then head home on the first flight . 
  not anymore . 
  petting a pup that associates human hands with abuse . 
  that 's kind of like when james bond decided to shag a victim of sex trafficking . 
   odin 's brother , named the french word for ass, 
  http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/cul_borson_ ( earth-616 ), 
  meanwhile , trump gets some kind of weird skin disease and starts wearing a hooded robe . 
  pence is almost killed in a car accident and has to wear a mask with a self-contained breathing apparatus . 
  maybe he realizes every other president is a self-centered bastard and decides to go down in history books as the guy who turned things around ? 
  do n't forget that portion was unmapped . 
  he did n't even know if he * could * get back out . 
  [ after 28 hours . 
  ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/nutty_putty_cave ), 
  relevant scene from lord of the rings :, 
  what 's the glass thing behind it ? 
  the article says they had enough nutella . 
  problem is that it was n't available after dark . 
  the muslims were practicing ramadan , which forbids them to eat when the sun is up . 
  the article was debunked in [ another comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/uncensorednews/comments/5f7z1z/migrants_burned_down_refugee_centre_in_germany_as/daiph7z/ ) , so it does n't really matter .
