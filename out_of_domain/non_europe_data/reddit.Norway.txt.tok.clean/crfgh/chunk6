  it specifically mentioned nutella and various types of candy , though . 
  it would have mentioned regular food if they were n't fed at all . 
  neither is judaism , but you 're still racist if you hate jews . 
  second bender moves to cover and calls in an airstrike . 
  that said , most of the points above are about a real army with benders as support , not a bender working alone . 
  there would be other soldiers , drones , tanks , scouts , etc. 
  if a bender worked alone , you would n't need a sniper , either . 
  a regular soldier with an assault rifle could take them out , especially since the bender need to stand up and dance for a second or two to bend and only the lightning element travels faster than a bullet . 
  what country are you from ? 
  norwegians can send a text with the license plate number to a service provided by the public roads administration ( vegvesenet ) and get the name of the owner of the car . 
  there might be a similar service in your country . 
  sounds like the evil brother was trying to trick the good one to cross over . 
  a hero walking the line between good and evil starts to make compromises , then he becomes an anti-hero doing bad things for good reasons . 
  eventually he becomes the villain , trying to save the world through plans that involve mass murder , mind control or something . 
  they ascended to a higher spiritual plane of existence , then they crashed as they tried to return to the physical plane . 
   `` i was sent only to the lost sheep of israel . '', 
  does n't this mean that only jews can be proper christians ? 
  [ nothing is true , everything is permitted .

  just follow yourself . 
  read up on rules , commandments , morality systems and just go with whatever you agree with . 
  there 's no such things as universal rules or universal truth , but you can get a good approximation by reading opinions of a wide spectrum of people and applying common sense . 
  adding interaction between different cultures to the mix could be pretty interesting too . 
  the aldmeri dominion sells a spell book to the mages guild in cyrodiil , and the whole thing is written as a picture book for children . 
  there 's also the question of how the spell books might vary from culture to culture . 
  one group might approach it like real world occultism , with rituals and symbols , while another could write it as a chemistry textbook . 
  tl ; dr : swimming with dolphins . 
  easier to limit your looting to jewelry , potions and other items with high value/weight ratio . 
  you 'll still end up having so much money that you stop selling loot after a while and just dump it all into various containers of your house . 
  have you tried removing all mods , reinstalling the game without them and starting a new game ? 
  maybe the builders did n't mention the backdoor ? 
  they 've been stuck there for thousands of years because they assumed the only exit was through the puzzle door .

  a lot of people in first world countries do n't even have food and shelter . 
  say what you want about communism , but at least they had water , free health care and their war veterans did n't sleep on the street . 
  multiple words in this case . 
  there 's also collaborator , traitor , judas , treasonist , fifth columnist , saboteur and [ benedict arnold ] ( http://www.dictionary.com/browse/arnold--benedict ) . 
  in case anyone 's wondering :,

  and satanism ? 
  a festival that turns christian values on their head and celebrates capitalism , hedonism and greed is probably their favorite holiday . 
  it looks like the `` triple crescent moon '' , which is another symbol used by wiccans . 
  ca n't they just put up signs or paint the ones used for trail marking ? 
  ca n't be too expensive . 
  since nobody else bothered ... 
  a minimum wage teenager willing to commute to work , empty trash cans for 150 minutes ( 15 * 10 ) everyday and get paid less than $ 62.4 , when instead they could get a part time job at mcdonalds ? 
  a better solution is to just hire a cleaning company that services a dozen companies in the area , and maybe have them clean your bathroom while they 're at it . 
  fixed .

  maybe his real life is extremely stressful and he likes to just log on , browse reddit and then log back off ? 
  it 's like playing an mmo , but spending your time in the chat or playing the minigames instead of killing monsters . 
  it 's an easter egg , like easter island and machu picchu . 
  it 's native to australia , does n't fit into the internal logic of the rest of the game and a player had to build a boat , cross the world ocean and travel to the furthest point on the planet ( from europe ) to find it . 
  if i made a game based on earth , i 'd definitely put some interesting stuff in obscure , hard-to-reach locations . 
  players need to be rewarded for exploration and an achievement popup would break immersion . 
  no vampires , midgard serpent , kraken or werewolves either .

   he ends every fight with one punch, 
  the last one took multiple punches . 
  it says south africa . 
  not if you drive really slow . 
  you could also wear a motorcycle helmet . 
  they take the saddle off the horse , turn it up-side-down , and then the woman pushes the baby into it .

  the format for links on reddit is \\ [ text ] ( address ) . 
  this shows up as `` text '' and send you to the address if you click it . 
  the address ended with a '' ) '' in this case , so i put a '' \\ \\ '' in front of it , which basically tells reddit to treat it as part of the url and not as the closing bracket of the link formatting . 
  i guess your client did n't know what that symbol meant and ended up showing the comment wrong . 
  he said `` launch the nukes '' , he did n't say where . 
  obama could simply aim them all straight up and have them self-destruct , like in latest x-men movie . 
  a tough clean-up job , as / u/logere said , but not the end of all multi-cellular life on the planet . 
  sweden won a few wars against them too . 
  according to the link below , they did n't become unbeatable until the 1800s .

  how about lord of the rings written by lovecraft ? 
  instead of an army of orcs , there could be an army of elder things , the ring could imbue the bearers with forbidden knowledge , gradually driving them mad . 
  instead of digging too deep , the dwarves of moria could have experimented with forbidden magic and summoned an elder god , which filled the ancient halls with monsters .

  he 's in skyrim too . 
  i spawned right next to him on the south-eastern beach of solstheim using the alternate start mod . 
  first thing i heard was `` it 's working , it 's working , \\* splat \\* '' and then i had to fight my way back to skyrim with nothing but his robe and staff at level 1 . 
  speaking of religion , would n't formations like this and like the grand canyon exist on the whole planet if the flood happened ? 
  you might be on to something ... 
  the vikings would have to wear helmets , chainmail , shields and axes . 
  if he 's also unemployed with no friends , he 's also helping the planet by not using a car or public transportation as much . 
  and a few adopted kids/child soldiers .
