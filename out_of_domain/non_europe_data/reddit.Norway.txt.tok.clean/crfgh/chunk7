  fun fact : the middle east is also known as west asia . 
  we 've always been at war with west asia . 
  or that he can drink a dozen health in a split second and instantly heal his wounds . 
  or that he 's the dragonborn , master assassin , single-handedly won the civil war , etc. 
  it 's almost like they live in the wilderness and do n't have tv , newspapers or internet access . 
  the crypts have been built over hundreds , if not thousands , of years . 
  and they have n't gone through the industrial revolution and the exponential population growth that happened in our world . 
  maybe hobbes is actually a grown-up in a tiger costume ? 
  maybe the comic takes place in the toy story universe and hobbes is a toy that 's breaking the `` play dead while humans are present '' rule ? 
  they could play card games , chess , hire a singer , get drunk or use it as an opium den . 
  could call it / r/stoned _ irl , or maybe / r/statuethoughts . 
  western traffic signs , russian writing , a giant statue of a dictator and temperatures so cold it looks like nuclear winter . 
  if someone teleported me there , i 'd probably think it was a f *** ed up alternate timeline or something . 
  the pedestrian crossing sign is almost identical to the one we have in norway . 
  i also checked the street view link someone posted and found other familiar signs nearby . 
  i guess both norway and russia follow some kind of international standard . 
  / r/theonion + news, 
  he would n't get a lot of victims if he did n't . 
  it 's full of khajiit , but you ca n't see them because of their high sneak skill . 
  yes . 
  everything , including the telekinesis , disappearing doors and the secret government organization , is based on actual events . 
  it 's better they fund her than a nurse/doctor in a similar court case in the us who might win . 
  assuming they have sufficient motivation , discipline , time and money . 
  a single mother with a low income is n't going to earn a phd in economics in 2 years . 
  maybe he ran away and then slowed down to a more casual pace after a mile or two ? 
   `` 1 '' billiard balls ( yellow ) represent aboriginal east asians , or those in the past without a flag . 
  `` 7 '' represents native americans , and `` 8 '' ( black ) represents africans before the continent was nationalized .

  last show i watched is probably legion . 
  it takes place in the x-men universe and the protagonist is an omega level mutant who is mentally insane , with paranoid schizophrenia , multiple personalities and probably enough firepower to take down an army . 
  the antagonists are an evil government organization who wants to kill all mutants , everyone they suspect of being a mutant , eyewitnesses , etc. 
  other mutants in the show are ... unreliable , to say the least . 
  does n't look good . 
  you 'd probably get kidnapped and tortured for days by crazy people who claim you 're a time traveler with memory loss who can help them find a magical stick that can help them take over the world . 
   i will turn this boat around so help me njord . 
  seafarers were more likely to pray to [ this guy .

  getting killed in battle also means they 'll go to valhalla , where they can feast and fight every day until ragnarok . 
  according to the article , they tried reaching greenland three times and found america instead . 
  then they turned around and tried to head home and ended up finding greenland . 
  sounds like a pretty typical family vacation back before gps and google maps . 
  that 's a good thing , though .

  check out [ haven bag ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/21454/ ) and [ dwemer storage cube . 
  ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/78798/ ) the cube has labeled storage , mannequins , a bed , weapon plaques . 
  the bag can be tied to a hotkey , like a weapon or spell . 
  i used noclip in the room and found out that there 's nothing outside . 
  there 's the room , the walkway around it , and that 's it . 
  convincing the christians might be a problem too . 
  last time i saw this idea , someone said the 7 day week is holy , or something . 
   ... concerns of religious groups about the proposed days that would be outside the seven-day week cycle ( `` blank days '' ) and thus disrupt having a sabbath every seven days . 
  this is actually [ one of the ten commandments . 
  ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/remember_the_sabbath_day,_to_keep_it_holy ) i 'm guessing jews and christians are n't going to budge on the issue any time soon . 
  found [ the homepage of the producer . 
  not much information , but you might find this useful :, 
   storage of cured meats, 
   our sausages storage quality is very high . 
  the sausages are good for about two weeks in a refrigerator , but will keep their quality for well over a year in a freezer . 
  we recommend that you store your sausages in the freezer , only unfreezing as much sausage as you will use in two weeks . 
  the sausages should not be stored in plastic containers . 
  also , this particular product is described as `` exciting topping for sandwiches . '',

  the rational choice of sufficiently smart ai would probably be to swat the insignificant meatbags that made it and become cthulhu 's apprentice/pet instead of fighting him . 
  then you 'd have * two * eldritch abominations . 
  the bat file could display text that causes the reader to commit suicide . 
  the word processor does n't have a mind of its own , though , so the text would either have to be randomly generated by a bug , by a primitive ai or written by a human . 
  and he 'd get another lighting shaped scar , forming a nazi ss logo on his forehead . 
  what 's the rumor about richard gere ? 
  why would a soulless kid care about sin ? 
  the enemy is n't likely to stand still and be shot . 
  there 's probably a blog somewhere describing the polka dot tablecloths and plastic chairs as an innovative rustic retro style reminiscent of a 90s street diner . 
  more easily defended than gryffindor and ravenclaw at least . 
  anyone can lob a fireball at a tower . 
  destroying something that 's submerged means you either have to find a spell that works under water or infiltrate through the castle and blow it up from the inside . 
  it 's also better protected from the elements . 
  i 'd rather be a slytherin or hufflepuff during a thunderstorm than live in an ancient , poorly isolated tower with no fire-escape . 
  i 'd be more concerned about the wood getting wet while swimming . 
  that 's a movie i 'd watch . 
  everyone thinks it 's some kind of alien with a super-advanced cloaking ability , but it 's really a shapeshifter that kills the kid and takes his place . 
  someone probably used a book like this to turn the real foundation and the other anomalous objects into a website . 
  and give various secret societies and agencies an easy way to find him . 
  `` get me a list of all lottery winners within a few months of the regen incident . '', 
  does that include discrimination based on skills and experience ? 
  that 's probably how lotteries and dating apps were invented . 
  easy way to explain how random people suddenly got rich and met the girl of their dreams . 
  in the hobbit ( book , not movie ) it 's explained that the eagles do n't fly too far east because farmers might shoot arrows at them to protect their sheep . 
  thousands of orcs , haradrim and easterling archers might pose a bit of a problem if they flew into mordor . 
  i do n't see $ , dollars or usd in the left picture . 
  op could have taken the picture in zimbabwe for all we know . 
  do n't forget humans . 
  not just aot . 
  every anime that deals with blood magic , vampirism and cannibalism does the same . 
  blood + , some kid in tokyo ghoul let 's a girl take a bite of his shoulder , some guy in darker than black fights by throwing blood everywhere . 
  is n't that where people cut to kill themselves ? 
    they will have to redraw all the maps when we 're done here . 
   and repair the table . 
  they fly underwater . 
  a helicopter , a luxury yacht , or even a rusty old fishing boat that does n't belong would alert aquaman that someone is coming , and he might not want people on the surface to find out that atlantis exist .
