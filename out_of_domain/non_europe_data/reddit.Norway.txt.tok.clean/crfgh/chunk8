  it also makes the traffic harder to trace by a third party , like a government agency . 
  in theory , the site you visited thinks the vpn server is your ip adress , the vpn server does n't keep logs and the nsa pretty much has to analyze all the traffic to and from the vpn server to find your actual ip address . 
  could be subtle foreshadowing that the mutants are n't ` the good guys ' and that the world is more ` shades of gray ' than ` black and white ' . 
  2 years old , if it 's [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/2wnfnt/gaming_console_if_you_vote_this_up_it_will_show/ ) thread . 
  it 's fake , unfortunately . 
  it was apparently inspired by a florida man who was caught picking hallucinogenic mushrooms with a baby gator in his backpack .

  you forgot `` great , now my number one post is ... '', 
  unless there has n't been a sith for a thousand years or so . 
  nobody would care if trump openly admitted to being a viking or a carthaginian . 
   drang nach osten ( german : [ \u02c8d\u0281a\u014b nax \u02c8\u0294\u0254stn\u0329 ] , `` yearning for the east '' , [ 1 ] `` thrust toward the east '' , [ 2 ] `` push eastward '' , [ 3 ] `` drive toward the east '' [ 4 ] or `` desire to push east '' [ 5 ] ) was a term coined in the 19th century to designate german expansion into slavic lands . 
  would make a good replacement void , now that the first one has pretty much been destroyed by art . 
  ca n't build a nuke with stone age tools . 
  better to leave instructions for everything leading up to the industrial revolution , then have nukes as the final recipe . 
  maybe label them ` immortality machines ' or something , so they actually use them . 
  might be a better idea to bury the carvings under the pyramids . 
  some future king might order his servants to remove the symbols so he can use the structure as a tomb . 
  can matter exist that 's made of other subatomic particles ? 
  it 's like a forest fire . 
  clears out the old and abandoned and makes a clean canvas for new growth . 
  what 's the difference between erase the place and the void ? 
  seems like the same ideology , except the void spread through tendrils and used black instead of white . 
  chatrooms . 
  people would vote whether to merge with other chatrooms or stay the same size . 
  fun fact : loki from norse mythology `` did things '' with a horse . 
  he later gave birth to an eight-legged horse called sleipnir . 
  meditating while jumping off a rooftop ? 
  does batman sleep upside down ? 
  he 's spent a lot of time with bats in that cave . 
  they had a lot more than 72 hours . 
  they 've probably been planning for an attack like this for months , if not years . 
  if the military did n't have plans for every plausible scenario , they would n't be doing their job . 
  he was probably on the wrong side of the planet . 
  or indoors . 
  they could crowdfund the site and use volunteer work instead of employees . 
  true . 
  i 'm just saying there are other ways to run a website than selling ads and paying wages for content . 
  reddit does n't pay people to submit quality content and wikipedia is funded through donations . 
  1 km = 1k meters = 1000 meters . 
  kilo is the latin word for thousand . 
  how do you throw away land ? 
  you can dig a deep hole in it and throw away the dirt , but the land still there . 
  get the family member who bought it arrested ? 
  what if i told you the whole world is fake ? 
  full of bots and npcs , all trying to distract you from the obvious truth . 
  the matrix has you , mellex . 
  follow the white rabbit . 
  read an article recently that professional athletes with asthma tend to outperform the healthy ones . 
  depression and anxiety can be fixed with exercise and the camaraderie of a military unit , and you 'll probably forget all about adhd after boot camp . 
  tl ; dr : do n't get laser surgery on those eyes . 
  he 'd probably be a drone pilot . 
  do n't need legs for that . 
  they also spread through tendrils like a disease , and they used the black present in other art to spread faster . 
  they could have just attacked randomly , going after the smallest art on the board . 
  both the void and the rainbow were more creative than the flags , corporate logos and color wars . 
  `` look , a blank canvas . 
  we can draw whatever we want . '', 
  `` let 's draw the flag of our country . '', 
  `` let 's draw a giant pink circle to represent the game we 're currently playing . '', 
  rainbow is the true evil . 
  they mask themselves in colors associated with civil rights while hogging more tiles than any other faction and attacking others at their weakest . 
  they tried taking over the american flag during the void attack , they spread through what later became the eu flag during the german invasion of france and they bullied / r/erasethespace to the point of sacrificing their ideology and being trapped in a tiny white triangle . 
  it 's not based on the final picture , in case anyone 's wondering . 
  it 's apparently from before norway 's annexation of shawnhate and the void attacks in the top left and next to mexico . 
  they could have fought the void with red , white and blue pixels . 
  expanding the rainbow like that does n't help anyone . 
  horses have poor eyesight . 
  she probably thought it was a small dragon . 
  found the alien . 
  he circled around back so he could attack from the human 's blind spot . 
  1.0 was the original inhabitants , 2.0 was the europeans . 
   she played a character in later seasons of sg-1 . 
  ] ( http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/carolyn_lam ) she became the chief medical officer at sgc after janet fraiser left . 
  wikipedia seems pretty sfw . 
  just skip the `` sexual aspects '' part . 
  she left the show . 
  figured i 'd keep it vague to avoid complaints about spoilers . 
  why ? 
  according to wikipedia both the actor and the character are still alive . 
  only mention of his death on google is this [ article ] ( http://en.mediamass.net/people/christopher-judge/deathhoax.html ) about a discredited death report spread on facebook . 
  someone confused food delivery personell with a trebuchet ? 
  i suppose it 's understandable if he somehow served 90 kg of food over a distance of 300 meters . 
  i 'm hoping that they 'll do it more like this movie . 
  trailers show the sovereign and adam as the main villain , but they only show up for occasional skirmishes while the main enemy is a planet eater , or something . 
  in the last battle , adam shows up to kill them before switching sides and helping them save the universe . 
  from what i 've seen of them , the sovereign would make a pretty boring choice as a main antagonist . 
  all they 've got seems to be drones and adam warlock . 
  or watch it on youtube in a few months . 
  probably did it to hide her second greatest accomplishment . 
  nice room , but i ca n't figure out how someone would retrieve a book from the top shelves without rearranging the furniture and bringing in a giant ladder . 
  [ turkeys ? 
  ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/turkey_ ( bird \\ ) ), 
  maybe earth is a reality show . 
  cameras everywhere and sometimes the showrunners make weird stuff happen to shake things up and get more viewers . 
  same here , but i assumed he was talking about skyrim . 
  they kind of look like rock warbler eggs , which can be mixed with wheat to make a healing potion . 
  aragorn , arwen and most of the fellowship would probably be killed by gondorians at their wedding , if they survive that long . 
  there 's no way corrupt gondorian nobles would simply hand over their kingdom to some foreigner . 
  the fellowship includes high-ranking nobles from all the other nations , so this would start a war with the whole north , including rangers , elves , dwarves and possibly even rohan .
