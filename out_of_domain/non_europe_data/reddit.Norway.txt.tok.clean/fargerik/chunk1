exactly what i was looking for - thanks for the great suggestions !, 
  _ hearts do n't break around here _ especially caugth my ear at the first listen . 
  you gave me a lot to work with going forward , and knowing that it 's called travis picking helps a lot . 
  also , i had no idea inside llewin davis was about a folk singer - i will definitely check it out . 
  thanks again !, 
  i 'm working on a uni project now , and i opted for using mariadb ( sql ) together with express . 
  it is very useful because most of my data is related to some other piece of data , and there is some recursion going on - so the ` with recursive ` query is very handy . 
  these packages makes it a breeze to work with an sql database :, 
  [ sql-template-strings ] ( https://www.npmjs.com/package/sql-template-strings ) ( for simpler query formatting ), 
  ( possibly ) [ bluebird promises ] ( http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/api/promise.using.html ) for ` using ` to release db resources after promise chain resolve/error .

  the action type is simply used by your reducers to know what to do when an action is dispatched . 
  as long as your reducers are pure functions , you can basically shove what you want in there . 
  [ these videos ] ( https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux ) by dan abramov explain everything by implementing redux functionality from scratch . 
  he also shows some neat es6 tricks that make the reducers more readable . 
  i 'm amazed by the brevity of the redux codebase . 
  another example is the ` thunk ` middleware , which can be pasted here in its entirety ( [ index.js ] ( https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk/tree/master/src ) ) :, 
  function createthunkmiddleware ( extraargument ) {, 
  return ( { dispatch , getstate } ) =  next =  action =  {, 
  if ( typeof action = = = ` function ' ) {, 
  return action ( dispatch , getstate , extraargument ) ;, 
  return next ( action ) ;, 
  const thunk = createthunkmiddleware ( ) ;, 
  thunk.withextraargument = createthunkmiddleware ;, 
  export default thunk ;,

   `` we had an outline and george changed everything in it , '' kurtz said . 
  `` instead of bittersweet and poignant he wanted a euphoric ending with everybody happy . 
  the original idea was that they would recover [ the kidnapped ] han solo in the early part of the story and that he would then die in the middle part of the film in a raid on an imperial base . 
  george then decided he did n't want any of the principals killed . 
  by that time there were really big toy sales and that was a reason . '', 
   the discussed ending of the film that kurtz favored presented the rebel forces in tatters , leia grappling with her new duties as queen and luke walking off alone `` like clint eastwood in the spaghetti westerns , '' as kurtz put it . 
  having han die on-screen would make the movie so much better . 
  it would raise the stakes for the story enormously , especially after the unconventional ending of the 2nd movie showed that good endings are n't guaranteed . 
  i 'm surprised by all the love rotj gets , because it had the potential to be so much better . 
  the guy who did the video essay outlined most of the complaints i have , even if he is a little nitpicky at times . 
   `` i do n't see this fund as a big problem if she does not solicit [ donations ] and it is entirely world bank run , '' said richard painter , ** former ethics adviser to the george w. bush administration .

  i have the bt400 dongle , and it 's just awful in linux ( yes , even arch ) . 
  it becomes even worse when there 's another 2,4 ghz dongle involved .

  we were unlucky and were born with this condition , but now the ball is in our court and it is up to us how we deal with it . 
  trying to hide it leads to awkward situations where people reach for your sweaty hand and pull back with a disgusted look on their face . 
  being upfront and honest about our condition to other people stops these kinds of situations from happening , and makes people aware of our situation . 
  being nonchalant about it has been my way of dealing with this . 
  it can basically be summed up to the phrase `` yeah , i sweat a lot . '', 
  i ca n't do anything about it , so there 's no reason for me to hide it .
