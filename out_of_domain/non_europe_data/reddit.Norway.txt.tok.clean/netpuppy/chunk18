  yeah , i 'm sometimes astounded by how this community supports it 's users with tooth and nail , even when users are behaving rather questionable , yet condemn the same users family for even being perceived as thinking the wrong thing . 
  are you holding everything correctly ? 
  the crochet hook should not be held like a knitting needle , but rather like a pen . 
  but it might just be that your hands need to get used to the new way of working . 
  does anybody know of a program or website where i can make a pattern ? 
  please like me , arrested development , call the midwife , and riverdale . 
  also , and this might be blasphemy in a netflix club , but i really recommend big little lies and feud on hbo . 
  4 weeks . 
  he had smiled a bit before that but that was when we were sure that it was intentional . 
  his first proper smile was to his grandparents and when they said hi to him he looked right at them and gave them a big , bright smile . 
  they were pretty scarce the first month or so before they became more frequent . 
  completely off topic , but what does cyka mean ? 
  someone in my neighbourhood apparently loves that word and is writing it on every surface yhey can find and i 'm so curious as to what the meaning is . 
  thank you !, 
  i have n't , but i just saw the trailer and i 'm very intrigued . 
  will definitely check it out !, 
  hubby is on a diet and my son is only 6 months old and does n't eat a lot yet , so i 'm only cooking for myself this week . 
  nothing fancy in other words . 
  i try to make sure i we have at least one vegetarian and one fish dinner a week . 
  these are all dinners :, 
  * monday : rice porridge, 
  * tuesday : pan fried salmon and veggies with r\u00f8sti potatoes, 
  * wednesday : vegetable gyro, 
  * thursday : my parents are coming to town so we 'll be going out to eat . 
  * friday : quinoa salad, 
  * saturday : stuffed pepper ( probably with leftover quinoa mixed with minced meat or something ), 
  * sunday : chicken wok, 
  i 'm glad to hear that !, 
  we have been really bad at meal planning this last month and our budget has suffered from it , so it 's back to business . 
  it 's actually a traditional norwegian [ dinner . 
  ] ( http://nordicdiner.net/scandinavian-rice-porridge/ ) it 's way faster to make it here in norway than that recipe suggested , though as you can buy special porridge rice which you only add milk to and cook for 10 minutes or so . 
  it rather sweet , but served with salty prosciutto it 's a nice little meal . 
  not very healthy , though , but balance is important . 
  just treat it like any other sum of money you have . 
  if you know you are going to spend from it , include that in your budget . 
  if you spend more than you budgeted , use `` cover spending with '' . 
  the account does n't matter , you could have one , you could have fifty , what matters is the category in the budget and how much you allocate to it . 
  totally anecdotal , but a friend of mine 's oldest daughter was a really late talker and like you they did n't have any reason to suspect she was hard of hearing . 
  then they went to the pediatrician for something unrelated who noticed she had quite a lot of ear wax in her ears . 
  he rinsed them out properly and shortly after she started talking and repeating words at record speed . 
  there 's no way of knowing if it was a coincidence or if there actually were a correlation of course , but my friend thinks there was . 
  anyways , might be worth looking into if your worried . 
  what do you mean ? 
  i have to admit though , actually getting the baby out , with all that entails of tearing and strain , were definitely the most painful . 
  6 months old . 
  * sleeps in his stroller for most naps . 
  if we 're not out walking i normally leave him outside next to an open window and hang out in our living room where the window is located . 
  * we keep a crib with one side removed next to our bed so it opens up into our bed . 
  he 'll usually spend the first half of the night in his crib because i sleep heavier when i sleep alone , and we 'll cosleep the rest of the night after his first wake up . 
  if i 'm particularly tired one night i 'll feed him and put him back in his crib so i can get a bit more high quality sleep . 
  does he have to fall asleep on his own ? 
  what happens if you comfort him ? 
  i know i 'm in the minority on this site , but i never really understood the need for small babies to learn to fall asleep on their own as soon as possible . 
  i 'm more in the help if needed camp . 
  we 've lately been sleep training my son , not necessarily for him to fall asleep on his own , but to fall asleep in his crib and without the boob which has soothed him to sleep for six months . 
  if we were to put him down drowsy but awake , he would do exactly like your baby and cry himself awake . 
  so we help him . 
  we help him by holding a hand on his stomach or stroking his back and shushing . 
  and we teach him that falling asleep in the crib is just as safe as falling asleep next to his mother . 
  and when i say we i obviously mean his daddy , because if he smells the boob , he wants the boob . 
  how are you holding her ? 
  if she keeps slipping to the side i suspect you might not have an optimal grip . 
  if you put your forearm under her shoulders/neck/head and grip around her shoulder/arm on the other side , like [ so , ] ( http://imgur.com/a/k0sg2 ) she wo n't be able to tip over . 
  it also leaves your other hand free to make sure her bottom does n't rise ( although if that 's a big problem you might want to lower the water levels a bit ) and do general washing . 
  if you still think it 's scary , you can always do it in the kitchen sink if baby still fits . 
  put down a towel for comfort an wash away . 
  omg i love this bot !, 
  lol , yeah i 'm pretty sure i could have been replaced by a floating boob those first few weeks . 
  totally normal . 
  i also ended up bed sharing and it totally saved me from lack of sleep . 
  if you want to continue bed sharing in a safe matter , i would sleep in pj 's that you can unbutton in the front so that you can keep your duvet/blanket at waist level without freezing . 
  baby should ideally have his own baby duvet . 
  if you do n't want to bed share at all , or just part of the night , i recommend using a bedside crib , or a converted crib by the side of your bed for easy access . 
  my baby fell asleep on the boob for 6 months before we decided to teach him to fall asleep without it . 
  it went really smoothly , so i would n't worry too much about it . 
  an 8 week old needs to feel safe and secure and the boob is an easy way to do that . 
  you 're still in `` do what works '' territory as far as i 'm concerned and i would n't think to much about forming habits just yet . 
  also , if you feel like your boobs are `` low '' at a certain time of the day when he wants to eat , the best way to make sure there are enough is to let him try and eat anyway . 
  he 'll usually get something ( even if they seem `` empty '' ) and after a while you 'll likely start to have more milk around that time . 
  but if you need a break , you need a break . 
  no shame in that !, 
  oh boy , reading this gave me a knot in my stomach . 
   he 's not shaking our baby violently or hitting her or anything of that nature . 
  the fact that he 's not doing it does not mean he wo n't . 
  ** it only takes one time to cause irreparable damage or death ** and if you get angry and frustrated enough , it 's scarily easy to do it . 
  if i were you , i would sit him down and have a serious talk about this . 
  try to relate and not make him defensive , but get the message out loud and clear . 
  the message being that, 
  * it 's okay to be frustrated when baby keeps us up at night ,, 
  * it 's ** not ** ok to take that frustration out on baby . 
  * if you feel like you get too frustrated or angry , you ** walk away !, 
  * you are a team !, 
  you need to be able to relieve each other . 
  if you can not trust him to get you to take over when he has reached his limit , he ** can not ** take care of her at night . 
  it 's going to be hard on you to do every night on your own , but this is serious . 
  * say this over and over until you both internalize it : ** no baby has ever died of crying . 
  many babies have died from shaken baby syndrome **, 
  * read up on shaken baby syndrom , especially testimonies from parents who have hurt their babies this way . 
  it 's heartbreaking , but it really drives home how easy it is to get to that point . 
  it usually starts with what you 're describing .
