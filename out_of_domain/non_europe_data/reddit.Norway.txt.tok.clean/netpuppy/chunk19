  make sure he reads it too . 
  work with him to change his behavior , but ultimately , if you can not trust him , you ** need to protect your baby however you can ** . 
  do you put her down at the same time every day , or do you follow her cues ? 
  i would try keeping a schedule for napping and maybe have her sleep outside in a stroller . 
  it might be confirmation bias , but i genuinely feel like babies sleep better and longer outside - the fresh air and all that . 
  for me personally , ferber is way to intense and i wo n't do it . 
  we have recently gone through sleep training with my 6 month old with great success , using a much milder method . 
  our starting point were me nursing him to sleep every night as well as co sleeping and nursing through the night . 
  we started by following the exact same routine every night ; bath at 6:45 , followed by pj 's , breastfeeding , reading a book ( to separate the nursing from the actual bed time ) before his dad took him into our room , put him in his crib and laid with him until he fell asleep . 
  if he needs it , he gets comforted by shushing , strokes on his back or stomach and holding hands . 
  if he gets really , really upset , he picks him up and calms him down before putting him back in his crib to try again . 
  there have been some long evenings , but now , about a month in , 9 out of 10 times he falls asleep in 5-10 minutes ( vs. 1-3 hours before we sleep trained ) . 
  he then sleeps from around 6.30 to 11-12 , when i breastfeed him and put him back in his crib . 
  then he sleeps until 3-5 am , at which point i transfer him to my bed where he stays until we get up at 7-8 am . 
  this worked really well for us so maybe it will for you too ? 
  i live in norway so i feel you on the weather !, 
  we have a roof and three walls outside our front door , though , so he 's protected from wind and rain . 
  do you have any place like that you can put the stroller ? 
  leave a window open nearby or place a baby call inside the stroller so you have control . 
  mine has almost all his naps outside and i 'm sure the fresh air does them good . 
   by no means do i fault my husband . 
  he felt he hit his limit and quit drinking , then tried to rehydrate and came home . 
  sure he did ... 
  suddenly going to daycare for four days a week is a huge transition for a little guy and i do n't find it odd that he has a reaction at all . 
  if i were you i would make sure to make him feel safe and loved and calm while at home ( he 's probably tired too ) and give him plenty of positive attention when he is n't having a meltdown . 
  i would treat this as a time of exceptions and give it at least two weeks for it to normalize itself . 
  who thought that was a good idea ? 
  haha !, 
  i would love a weekly meal planning thread for inspiration !, 
  maybe a project thread would be cool too . 
  my thumb of rule is at least every two weeks . 
  i share a bed with my hubby , a baby and occasionally a dog so usually it 's way more frequent , though , like a couple of times a week . 
  yay , that 's awesome !, 
  my son wo n't take a bottle and we use cup feeding . 
  it 's a bit more work , but okay for us since i 'm on mat leave and stays with him almost all the time still . 
  personally i would stay home if i had the option to give myself peace of mind , but you 'll have to do what works for you and your family . 
  i would definitely speak to the pediatrician , though , and probably go in for weighing a bit more frequently to make sure he 's still gaining sufficiently . 
  i would also make sure both you and your husband knows the signs of dehydration in babies . 
  it 's probably not likely since he does manage to drink a bit , but it can happen very suddenly when they 're that small and it 's better to be prepared just in case . 
  norway here . 
  all healthcare are free when concerning pregnancy , babies and children under 18 . 
  - ** pregnancy : ** normally you start out with a doctor 's visit at 12 weeks before an ultrasound in week 18 . 
  you do n't get earlier ultrasounds in norway unless there is a reason for it . 
  obviously you can do it privately and pay for it , but they still are n't allowed to check for chromosomal abnormalities . 
  - then , from week 20 and onward you go to your doctor ( general physician ) or midwife every 4 weeks . 
  you can choose to see only one every time , or alternate between the two . 
  i only went to my midwife . 
  - at ** birth ** you are helped by the midwife available/on call who also delivers the baby . 
  you can have most of the normal pain relievers except from gas in some regions . 
  - after the baby is born you usually get at least an hour to bond/nurse before they do weigh , measure , give vitamin k etc. 
  everything happens in the room and the baby stays with mom throughout the stay at the hospital . 
  there are no nursery etc. , but if the birth was particularly hard and mom needs to rest the nurses will take the baby a few hours at night and help out . 
  - guidelines for hospital stay length is 3 days after vaginal birth and 5 days after c-section , but in my experience they try to send you home earlier if you are in good shape . 
  i was sent home after 2 days , which i wanted . 
  baby gets examined by a doctor and gets blood drawn to test for different conditions before getting discharged . 
  - within two weeks of getting out of the hospital you get a home visit from the nurse who will follow your baby for the next few years . 
  - ** vaccines : ** rotavirus orally at 6 and 12 weeks . 
  shots at 3 , 6 , and 12 months . 
  - ** parental leave : ** maternity leave starts 3 weeks before due date . 
  then we have 10 weeks maternity leave , 29 weeks free to be divided between the parents and 10 weeks paternity leave , all at 100 % pay . 
  you can also stretch the shared part to 39 weeks at 80 % pay , but that usually does n't make sense economically and your usually better off using your vacation time if you want to make it to a year . 
  - ** childcare : ** in norway the government has decided that everyone should be able to send their children to daycare so you are normally guaranteed a place at daycare by the time they are 1 years old and it 's heavily subsidized so you pay a maximum fee of around 350 usd per child a month . 
  if you want your child to stay home longer you get subsidies of around 950 usd a month for maximum 11 months before the kid is two years old . 
  this is what we 'll do and i 'll stay home with him during day and work evening shifts . 
  - you also get around 125 usd a month per child in basic income from the child is born until they turn 18 . 
  i feel very lucky to be able to have a baby in this country !, 
  not sure if i misunderstood you here or not , but never close a fridge that is n't running . 
  that makes it smell horrible !, 
  i should probably make this a bit clearer : the only people who are allowed to get checked for chromosomal abnormalities early on in the pregnancy are those those who are high risk . 
  normally they do check for chromosomal abnormalities at the regular ultrasound at 18 weeks . 
  it 's earlier they wo n't do it , specifically before 12 weeks as that is the normal upper limit for abortions and the idea is that you should n't be able to abort only on the basis of downs syndrom or similar . 
  ca n't say i agree with it , but that 's how it is . 
  however , that is for `` normal '' pregnancies , those with high risk are given the option to check for it . 
  lol !, 
  yeah , probably . 
  either keep it off with something keeping the door open , or on with the door closed and see if it makes a difference . 
  edit : i would air it out completely before turning it on and closing it , though . 
  i always wash the bathroom/toilet with bleach and use the water to clean the toilet brush when i 'm done . 
  i always try to have at least one meatless and one fish dinner a week . 
  we get family visiting this week so we 'll go out to eat a couple of days . 
  these are all dinners :, 
  sunday : [ potato dumplings ] ( http://www.therecipehunters.com/raspeball-with-mats ) with mashed rutabaga and bacon ( traditional norwegian dish ) . 
  monday : leftovers from sunday . 
  fried slices of potato dumplings and bacon . 
  tuesday : sweet potato soup ( meatless ) . 
  wednesday : eating out . 
  thursday : eating out . 
  friday : one pot lentils and rice ( meatless ) . 
  saturday : oven roasted salmon with r\u00f8sti potatoes and veggies . 
  have you tried steaming it ? 
  either with steam on the iron or a proper steamer ? 
  if nothing else works i would probably take it to a dry cleaner and ask them if they could manage to get it out . 
  i use cozi and love it , but i 'm guessing it might not be exactly what your looking for ? 
  it 's more of a home organizer app than a chores app . 
  have you tried trello ? 
  i think that could work really well . 
  you can make different lists of chores and make them reappear weekly or monthly . 
  yes . 
  i would , at least . 
  actually , kale is one of the few foods you should n't give to a child under ( i think ) 1 yo because of the nitrate .
