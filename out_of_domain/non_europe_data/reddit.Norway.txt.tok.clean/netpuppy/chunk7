  when i watched this all i kept thinking were `` stop touching it . 
  stop touching it . 
  stop touching it ! '', 
  and then she tries to kiss it on the snout !, 
  that poor woman !, 
  the owner should have stopped that way before it came to that . 
  i apologize if it 's a dumb question but what 's the difference between a walk and a hike ? 
  that last video is also a really great representation of calming signals from the husky . 
  quite interesting . 
  honestly i would substitute the dog park for proper walks and schedule playdates with dogs you know and trust instead . 
  stay calm yourself , do n't fuss or make it a ` situation ' . 
  dogs pick up on that . 
  bring something for him to chew on ( not the super smelly stuff ) and maybe practice calming exercises such as eyecontact , sit , lay down with treats if she gets too excited . 
  do n't make it too difficult as she wo n't have the best focus , make it easy and calm . 
  i would n't do give the dog a sedative before i knew there were a problem . 
  if i understand op correctly this will be their first time flying and she 's not scared of the dog being scared as much as overly excited . 
  it 's not necessary . 
  sedatives are usually used when they are so scared they are unapproachable . 
  when they are just excited they are a tad excessive . 
  theoretically yes . 
  i would however not use it unless it is a known problem with that particular dog as worst case scenario you could create a problem . 
  some dogs do not handle being sedated well and instead of calming them it makes them nervous and insecure that they are drowsy and not as responsive as they are used to . 
  so i would definitely not consider using them unless it were my last resort . 
  fresh sweat is n't so bad . 
  it 's kind of a musky , manly smell . 
  old sweat on the other hand . . that 's what stinks . 
  i just use an actual teaspoon . . 
  where did you find that recipe ? 
  pretty awkward measurements , i agree . 
  180 ml of milk is almost 2 dl so i would just do that by eye and 45 ml of oil . . would just use 0,5 dl . 
  [ meanwhile in norway ... ] ( http://www.tv2.no/a/6443765 ), 
  nosework : hide treats around the house and have him find them , make it more difficult as he progresses . 
  everytime i give my dog a bullystick or pigs ear i have him sit and wait in one room and go hide it in another . 
  that 's also a great way to reinforce the stay command . 
  you can also hide yourself and have him come find you if you 're worried about relationship building . 
  teach him tricks . 
  a smart dog like an aussie will likely think learning tricks with it 's human is super fun !, 
  and it 's a great relationship builder . 
  how about other playforms ? 
  have you tried tug of war ? 
  flirt pole ? 
  chasing games ? 
  i 'll link you some videos and reading material when i get off work as what you 're asking for is way too much information to be summed up in a text post . 
  ok , as promised i pulled some videos for you . 
  this is really basic , but it 's a kind of starting kit so feel free to ask more in depth questions if there 's something unclear or that i have n't touched on .

  here is a great [ playlist ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfoa6rheqiu&amp;index=1&amp;list=plpw4p_laf1ywck9jlwmtpfy6p4q__a_vg ) on basic training and socialization plus a [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxdcdbqikq4 ) that should have been on the playlist but were n't . 
  remember that socialisation is super important !, 
  that and recall training makes it much easier to be a dog owner .

  hope you find these helpful !, 
  how on earth does it do that ? 
  seriously though , do n't listen to cesar milan . 
  he uses outdated methods based on behavioral filosofies and theories that has been thoroughly debunked over the last few decades by leading animal behavioralists and experts in the field . 
  we just started working on walking on his front legs today . 
  that 's probably the most challenging trick so far and i 'm excited to see if we can make it . 
  other than that roll over , play dead , crawl and dancing on his back legs are great crowd pleasers . 
  in addition we continously work on impulse control which have been very useful . 
  currently we 're working on him heeling and walking close to / over treats on the floor but he always tries to walk past it with the biggest distant possible . 
  i do n't think he trusts himself , lol !, 
  a few months before he was 2 years old . 
  however , you do n't have to tolerate a rude puppy just because he 's young . 
  set rules and be consistent , if you do n't do it when he 's a puppy you ca n't expect him to magically be well behaved and trained as an adult . 
  when it comes to the children , i 've had very similar problems with my dog , he just gets way too excited and wants to `` arrest '' them by nipping at their clothes and feet when they are being too much like children ( running , bouncing , flailing hands etc. ) . 
  since he has n't been exposed to children a lot it 's taken a long time to work on but he 's doing a lot better now . 
  my point is that the sooner you start working on it and the more consistent you are in your training , the sooner he 'll learn how to behave . 
  the only thing to be mindful of is that puppies tire easily and are prone to being overly excited so do it in quick bursts , and remove him from the situation if it seems to be getting too much for him and let him cool down before bringing him back . 
  teeth touching metal . . like biting down on a fork , it 's horrible and make my teeth itch . 
  i really do n't like going to the dentist . . 
  i suppose it might be different if you spay or neuter your dog , but in my experience they can go pretty bonkers when they start hitting sexual maturity , not unlike teenagers . 
  it 's not really weird though , that they ca n't really control themselves with crazy hormones messing with their heads and all the new smells and urges they 're discovering . 
  consistency in training and a lot of patience is the only way , 
  that mama dog looks so friendly and sweet . 
  but she looks absolutely exhausted . 
  i hope we get an update video when you 've cleaned them up a bit , 
  i also thought maggie when i saw the picture , before i saw your suggestion . 
  so we have two for maggie !, 
  where in norway are you going ? 
  from another answer it looks like you are going to \u00c5lesund ? 
  in that case i would recommend you to go to runde for the [ bird sanctuary ] ( http://www.visitalesund-geiranger.com/en/product/?tlp=33561 ) where more than 500.000 birds are nesting during spring and summer . 
  it 's quite cool and a very scenic place . 
  you also have the festival [ `` sommerfesten p\u00e5 giske '' ] ( http://momentium.no/sommerfesten ) ( giske summerparty ) july 2 . which is sort of a one night mini festival . 
  other than that you have the festival [ slottsfell ] ( http://www.slottsfjell.no/ ) in t\u00f8nsberg 13 . to 16 . july ,, 
  it 's hard to give a difinitive answer without seeing the dog , but from what it looks like the dog is protecting your mother from the rest of you . 
  so your mother is at the center of the problem and wil have have to be at the center of the solution , i believe this especially since you said the dog changed behavour when your mother was not around . 
  any time the dog barks at you while sitting on your mothers lap , your mother should immediately say `` no '' ( or whatever `` that 's wrong '' sound they use ) , put the dog on the floor , stand up and walk away . 
  that way your mother tells the dog you 're not allowed to bark and if you do , your not allowed to sit on my lap ( where he probably really wants to be ) and i 'm leaving you ( for a little while ) . 
  this method is effective ( providing there is not more going on i do n't know about ) but can be quite strenious for the person having to get up from their seat all the time , but consistency is key . 
  this needs to happen every single time the dog shows this behaviour . 
  you should pretty much ignore your parents dog unless it seeks you out for attention . 
  throw some candy around to show him you make good things happen , but do n't push him by calling him to you , trying to pet him when he 's not up for it . 
  when it comes to your puppy you it 's a little unclear how serious the issue is , but you absolutely do not want to give your young puppy any bad experiences so you need to protect it and keep it out of harms way . 
  you might even have to keep them seperated if necessary . 
  edit : i found a [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bul3d8rsplw&amp;list=plnjppxu-mzrkkg_bux0rnnarowfd0x8yt&amp;index=8 ) ( from 15:35 ) that depicts the technique i 'm talking about . 
  the woman in the viedeo only puts the dog on the floor , but because you said he would act the same sitting under your mothers legs i think she should also get up and walk away . 
  but . . 
  it 's a great way to make make sure you 're not over - or underdressed .
