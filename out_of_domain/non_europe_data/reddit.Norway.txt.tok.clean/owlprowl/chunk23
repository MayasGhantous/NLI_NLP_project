  it 's been a long time since i read sophie 's world , but i remember it being very accessible and a good first book on philosophy and philosophers . 
  i read it when i was 13-14 and that and talking to my dad about the ideas i read was a great foundation to build on . 
  well , that is creepy beyond belief . 
  i 've seen it at second hand markets , so i might pick it up !, 
  thanks for the rec . 
  that was what i feared . 
  but i 'm going to give it a try !, 
  for me it would n't be how many teeth , but how the teeth looked . 
  i mean 32 rotten teeth like the ones here would n't make me worried , but 32 healthy teeth ? 
  i 've read two of her trilogies , but something that annoyed me was that i loved the books until the last few pages that just seemed forced . 
  and it was in all the books i read . 
  [ possible spoiler question  ( #s `` i think i read somewhere that this is a zombie story , is that true ? '' ), 
  i do n't really disagree with you . 
  i just like the original more and would have liked it to have been something else then a shot by shot remake ... 
  yes !, 
  snowpiercer is a terrible movie . 
  when i saw it in cinema i left when the guy with the fish came on . 
  i 've since watched the rest , and do n't regret leaving at that point . 
  that is a sticking point for me , since i 'm really not into ... that . 
  really ? 
  the people i went to see it with got really fanboy mad at me for skipping out . 
  and the little i 've read about it online has all been ravings about how mindblowingly amazing it is . 
  i 'm really glad i 'm not alone in my dislike for it . 
  i 'll read a bit about it . 
  is it ya ? 
  i 'll give it a try . 
  thanks for the answers !, 
  i was dragged to see ` heaven is for real ' . 
  it was terrible . 
  ended up sitting in the back and reading on my kindle . 
  kill it with fire . 
  so much this book !, 
  i bought it to read on a 7 hour train ride , but after a few chapters i put it down and decided to just stare into the air for the next 6 hours instead of reading more . 
  i left the book on the train . 
  i 'll archive this under ` praise , faint ', 
  this book just seemed like ` award bait ' to me . 
  if this was read in a drinking game of literary clich\u00e9s then i would be drunk within the first chapter . 
  everything is the son of this who is the son of that who had a goat with the same name as this character we never hear anything about . 
  i mean , get to the point already !, 
  i say stick to the kids version if you want to read the stories . 
  i think there 's even kids versions for adults !, 
  outlander . 
  my sister loves the books and got me the first 4 books for my birthday . 
  i got halfway through the first book and then just faked having read them . 
  `` watson , if it should ever strike you that i am getting a little overconfident in my powers , or giving less pains to a case than it deserves , kindly whisper ` norbuary ' in my ear , and i shall be infinitely obliged to you . '', 
  [ sherlock holmes in the adventures of the yellow face ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_adventure_of_the_yellow_face ), 
  for my part i enjoyed the maze runner the most ( you can ignore the ` prequel book ' ) . 
  but it 's not an amazing series . 
  for divergent the first book was fine , the second was annoying and i rage quit it so many times . 
  the third i did n't get far into before i noped it and gave all the books away . 
  why these two series ? 
  is it to ya you 're after or the dystopia or a mix of both ? 
  i 'd say both these series are borrow from the library quality . 
  i 'm really enjoying the [ tomorrow series ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71865.tomorrow_when_the_war_began?ac=1&amp;from_search=1 ) right now . 
  edit : the tomorrow series is n't a great value series either , but it is a page turner for me , and cheap for kindle .

  it looked interesting and kindle have made me into a ` everything for less then 4 is basically free kind of girl .

  full disclosure : the last skulduggery book made me cry . 
  and not just a little , full on ugly cry . 
  i have n't cried that much since reading [ the three musketeers 20 years later ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/three-musketeers-penguin-classics/dp/0141442344/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1447730328&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=the+three+musketeers ), 
  great work !, 
  i pretty much just read out loud the parts i was told to read . 
  and it was from all over the bible . 
  i really do like the stories that are hidden under all the filler , there was just so much filler . 
  oh ... for the count of monte cristo i really like the story , but there is a lot of filler . 
  i 've only read the norwegian translation , so ca n't help you there . 
  and again , your library most likely have this book in multiple editions . 
  that said i 'm a big fan of libraries ( and second hand ) , and then getting the ones i love the most and that i feel have a re-read value . 
  although my kindle have made me a little less discriminate on that front . 
  that 's so sad !, 
  i 'm on book three and ellie is a mess right now and i just want to hug her . 
  i am considering getting the hardcover books . 
  if that happens to you make sure to rate the santa badly . 
  the [ gone series , by michael grant ] ( http://www.amazon.com/gone-michael-grant-ebook/dp/b0029pbvkm/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1447805883&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=gone ) is pretty decent and action filled enough from the first page to make you want to read more . 
  if i finish a book i 'll give it 3 stars , even if i did n't love it . 
  because i 'm a person who , if i do n't like a book i will stop reading it . 
  generally i do n't rate books that i do n't finish unless i absolutely despise it . 
  i 'm extremely sceptical to self published books . 
  i get that getting published is difficult , but most authors ( even established authors ) need an editor and an agent . 
  i do n't trash free self published books , but i do n't praise them for things they have n't achieved either . 
  the same here . 
  by virtue of me having read the entire book it has usually earned a middle of the scale rating . 
  i 'm not on goodread , but to me it seems like an echo chamber of good reviews and gifs . 
  that was more an embarrassing consequence of the committee being filled with crazy socialists . 
  thank you !, 
  thanks !, 
  after being told i could n't buy the kindle from the us store i was worried that there would be a problem since i could n't get books from the uk store from my late kindle . 
  a knife !, 
  i did n't even make the connection ... i just went to buffy immediately and began to think how that would be so not practical and the force needed to penetrate the ribcage ... 
  to be fair , buffy is always the first thing i think about .
