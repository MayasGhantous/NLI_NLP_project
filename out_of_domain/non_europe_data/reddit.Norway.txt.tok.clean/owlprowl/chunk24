  some good , some bad , some uglies ( see what i did there ? ), 
  so , this might be insulting , but how old are you ? 
  becuase there 's a lot of ya/children 's books on this list that if you 're older the 15 just looks like list filler . 
  my favourite of the ones i 've read on the list i think is ` never let me go ', 
  i see you skipped the rest of the uglies series , not your cup of tea ? 
  we all have our guilty pleasure ya books . 
  and i 've read a few of the ones on the list . 
  i mean , i 'm not sure why but i 've got both 5th wave books on my kindle ( and they are really not good books , but i 've read them anyway ) . 
  uglies , the bit i 've read , made me want to be illiterate . 
  i enjoyed the first hunger games book , but then it got a little pretentious and the premise and actions of the characters were just so unreal . 
  uglies made me wash my hands of goodreads , the amount of terrible books with around 4 stars is mindblowing . 
  and really , the premiss was even sillier then your average silly ya `` dystopia '' premiss . 
  i have n't heard about this , got a link ? 
  i 've been to a lot of film festivals , so a great bunch . 
  but for ` normal ' cinema i remember ` there 's something about mary ' got applause . 
  there 's the big one , aka anything written by alexandre dumas . 
  then there 's [ hemingways ' a maveable feast ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a_moveable_feast ) about paris in the 1920s . 
  [ the great cat massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_great_cat_massacre ) is a strange one about how pets were treated in 1700s france as opposed to the lower class . 
  and then last there is [ perfume ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perfume_%28novel%29 ) which is just all around creepy . 
  or at the very least take photos of the package with postage and custom info . 
  thanks !, 
  this might be seen as cheating here , but audiobooks . 
  i 'm not a great reader , but audiobooks when i do everyday tasks works for me . 
  that is so pretty , the pattern , the colours , just how neat and even the stitches are !, 
  your mother will love this . 
  and if she does n't , take it back and give it to me ... 
  what does she like ? 
  i mean , besides alcohol , travel , and music ? 
  how old is she ? 
  except ms is n't a case of you 'll die within a week !, 
  most likely , she has years to tell him . 
  best gift ? 
  there is a few , but right now my favourite is the [ president snow t-shirt i got in the hunger games exchange ] ( https://www.redditgifts.com/gallery/gift/all-way-australia-16/ ) !, 
  and plastic tarp is so expensive these days !, 
  this is a brilliant helper , if your giftee actually uses reddit ... mine does n't . 
  no wishlist , no history , no previous exchanges , no nothing . 
  fml ... 
  at least they have interests ? 
  i 'm trying to compose a non offensive message to ask my giftee if they have any interests , or things they like or anything that can be used to get them a gift ... are there politician pop-figures ? 
  i creepy stalked my postcard giftee to a kind of creepy point , so i think this is revenge : /, 
  poor thing !, 
  account created just in time to take part . 
  that sucks . 
  then again i 've had the same experience with someone who hd participated in multiple exchanges . 
  i 'm not sure if they even got the gift or if the shipment proof was accepted . 
  there was just ... nothing . 
  see if they added a wishlist , if not go by what they say about themselves in the bio and notes to santa , and you can always send a message and hope your giftee replies . 
  there 's arbitrary day in 6ish months , and there 's exchanges throughout the year . 
  now verify the e-mail and sign up to be notified for next exchange . 
  i have just began to think about what to get ... planning on being ready sometime next week , mostly because shipping takes 2 weeks . 
  and that is me being quick . 
  that looks so good !, 
  although , is there cake there ? 
  or is it just the filler stuff ? 
  it is an impressive cake !, 
  [ this is a good article about deaf culture and how it 's failed to adjust to new technologies ] ( https://medium.com/matter/the-silencing-of-the-deaf-22979c8ec9d6#.mg1x0g9o1 ), 
  i 'm saying this is a good excuse to get sliding doors . 
  my solution was to send them a message with a lot of random questions . 
  i know it 's hard , and i 'm terrible at this myself , but it might be a good idea to sit back and wait a few days for a reply . 
  your version does make more sense . 
  is canada mail just terrible in general ? 
  i ordered something on etsy , so it was shipped from canada to canada ( but from one side of the country to the other ) , and the package i sent from europe to the us still managed to get there faster . 
  yes and no . 
  when i read , it 's very convenient , but i still have long periods where i barely read anything . 
  i love you !, 
  [ the three body problem ] ( http://www.amazon.com/three-body-problem-cixin-liu-ebook/dp/b00iqo403k/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1448839670&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+three+body+problem ), 
  this is n't really sci-fi , but it kind of is ... [ the postman ] ( http://www.amazon.com/postman-david-brin-ebook/dp/b0034n7jjk/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1448839860&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+postman ) is a great post-apocalypse book , from 1985 . 
  and if you 're looking for cheap books try the [ monthly deals ] ( http://www.amazon.com/b/ref=amb_link_380698542_1?ie=utf8&amp;node=3441883011&amp;pf_rd_m=atvpdkikx0der&amp;pf_rd_s=center-1&amp;pf_rd_r=1gscb7w6814yq4ph906k&amp;pf_rd_t=1401&amp;pf_rd_p=1590374862&amp;pf_rd_i=1000706171 ) in kindlestore . 
  same here . 
  well , i 've read 2 of them , but still not sure why i decided to get them . 
  this is the sort of article you should link via an archive instead of giving them money by going to the site . 
  as far as i see you have 3 choices ; keep the baby , give it up for adoption , and abortion . 
  the way i deal with things is to write lists . 
  so i would write a list of what was important to you , then write a pro and con list for each of those three choices . 
  because in the end you have to find out what 's right for you , no matter what people on the internet tells you . 
  wait , you do n't have reserved seating ? 
  seriously ? 
  the only cinema i 've been to without reserved seating have been a tiny one ( and by that i mean there is 100 seats tops . 
  i 'm giving something ` used ' as part of the gift , as long as it is n't the only thing , then i do n't see a problem with it . 
  it gets x-rayed , and then if they see something suspicious they might open it . 
  based on all the viking posts and the obsession with 14 words , i 'm going to go ahead and say yes . 
  i think we can agree that the entire blog is one giant red flag . 
  til, 
  my first project for myself was a lonh cardigan for myself . 
  i misjudged the gauge and ended up with something so big and off proportional i ended up unraveling the top and gave it away as a baby blanket . 
  do you talk to him ? 
  try to figure out if he 's living independently or in a facility . 
  if you get his name try contacting ... and this is where i show that i 'm not american , because i have no idea who you should contact , but health and human services or the facility . 
  because i 'm pretty sure it 's not just you , but other specific women as well . 
  i have a `` cousin '' with a developmental disability who first became obsessed with my sister and then with my cousin , he was in his 30s-40s and they were early teens , it lasted years for both of them and the family did n't take it seriously . 
  the letters and phone calls were seen as harmless . 
  luckily he did n't live in the same city . 
  why is ( was ? ), 
  2\u00a01/2 men the most watched show on network tv ? 
  who is all these people watching ncis ? 
  the list goes on . 
  truth is there are 319 million + people living in the us , so the fact that 10 + million of them decide to do anything is n't all that impressive . 
  if you want a more specific answer then i 'm going to go with : it 's an easy show to follow , it 's edgy ( but not offensive ) and both the humor and angst is accessible . 
  edit : forgot a word : network, 
  fantasy in general tends to be more graphic when it comes to characters struggling after action scenes , trudi canavan and robin hobb comes to mind ( although it 's been a long time since i 've read either author ) .
