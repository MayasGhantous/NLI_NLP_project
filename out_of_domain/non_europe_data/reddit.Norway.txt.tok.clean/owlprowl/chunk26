  in my experience , while it 's not impossible to lose weight , it 's not easy either . 
  in fact where i work we are trying to help someone lose weight right now . 
  one of the reasons why we 're even doing it is that she 's just in her 60 's , if she had been 10 years older we would not have bothered . 
  now this case is hard , because it 's woman with just enough cognitive impairment that she does n't understand why she needs to lose weight and ca n't eat as much as she wants . 
  she also has diminished feeling of satiety , meaning that in her eyes we are starving her . 
  and the thing is right now the only thing we are doing is serving her slightly smaller portions , and switching to low calorie alternatives . 
  and then there 's the family , who do n't get why we 're ` depriving their mother ' . 
  this woman , right now , weigh a little under 250 lbs . 
  we 're hoping to get her down to 200 lbs , which is the limit for some of the equipment we use . 
  so yes , some of the patients we have the doctor have a talk to about their weight gain and then we follow up with them . 
  but you have to work with what you 've got , and sometimes that means getting training and equipment to help move obese patients . 
  i 've been working for 10 years now as a nurses assistant in a nursing home , both day and night and it 's the same here . 
  sometimes you 've got time to wait for someone to come and help you , and other times it 's 1.30 am and the bed is swimming in urine and you can wait the hour and a half until you get help or you can do it yourself . 
  if you 're really unlucky you end up working with someone obese or one of the adorable young girls who work there in the weekends , , who do n't have the strength to help you lift the patient . 
  5 ' 1 '' here , and around 120 lbs , and i 've moved patients twice and close to three times my weight by myself . 
  luckily in most cases they have been able to help a little . 
  it 's get them on a bedpan yourself or wait until someone can help you , and by then chances are you have to change the bed as well . 
  oh yeah , because it 's not just the weight of the patient , if that patient ca n't help then getting them to sit up in bed is a two person job no matter how strong you are . 
  years ago there was a female patient who would accuse everyone she did n't like of raping her , double so if you were giving her a suppository . 
  was n't a problem until we got a male assistant , then suddenly everyone got to go in their in pairs . 
  you 're right !, 
  i gave up on season 4 at some point ( ca n't even tell where ) , but now that i 'm thinking about it what annoyed me the most was the musical numbers . 
  i 've never watched glee , and if it 's anything like season 4 , then i 'm not going to . 
  crappy songs stinking the show up . 
  i watched that season on netflix , so i just skipped past it . 
  but if i could n't do that , then i 'm not sure if i would have completed it . 
  and ending like it did was just mean . 
  i 'm going to save this for later , because this looks great !, 
  [ here 's an example of a blog about eating on a budget ] ( http://www.budgetbytes.com/ ) . 
  it 's been my go to blogfor a while now . 
  lots of recipes and a weekly this is what i got this week post . 
  when will i ever use a dragon cake pan ? 
  i have no idea , and just managed to avoid ordering it . 
  but the cozy village one is in my amazon wishlist now . 
  i had a real love hate relationship with the show , because the characters were doing so many horribly stupid things , but being so loveable while doing it . 
  he was the reason i started watching in the first place , after loving him in hotel babylon, 
  he was the reason i started watching in the first place , after loving him in hotel babylon, 
  never heard of that , do you have any examples ? 
  while a great translator can make magic happen , there really is n't a graceful way to translate some books . 
  quick example ; harry potter , book for children/ya so for a great deal of them reading the book in english and not their own native language is n't really an option . 
  so then there 's the question , do you translate the names ? 
  with as many layers there are to a lot of the names , the meaning will be lost if you keep the english , but at the same time how do you translate a name ? 
  do you change diagon alley to keep the play on words or do you make slight changes to it so it 's a different play on words that work in your language but has the spirit of the original name ? 
  so does transformers . 
  is there a point to this ? 
  i mean , is n't a better thing to tell us if it is a good movie ? 
  then you should start by watching julie and julia !, 
  do you have a strategy ? 
  by that i mean , will you do it like a journey through film history , or by genre , or maybe a movie from every country ... wait a second ... oh , there 's only 196 countries . 
  so close . 
  if you want to learn more about movies i would have started with movies from the early era of film making and work myself up . 
  [ red shoes ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040725/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ), 
  [ adventure of robin hood ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029843/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ), 
  [ the passion of jeanne d'arc ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019254/ ) : this is a must see , although it 's a must see on a big screen with someone playing piano . 
  [ birth of a nation ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0004972/?ref_=nv_sr_2 ) and it 's sequel [ fall of a nation ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0006664/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ), 
  [ the death of mr. lazarescus ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0456149/ ), 
  well , glad i could teach you something !, 
  then what is the point ? 
  i mean , who cares if it passes an arbitrary test if in the end the movie is terrible ? 
  a test i might add that the twilight saga passes , but both alien 3 and run lola run fails . 
  that makes sense . 
  the article is terrible , so smug . 
  except those movies are usually a snapshot in a persons life , and if the protagonist is a male then the chances of there being conversations that do n't include conversations between two women . 
  why not take the movie for what it is and enjoy the characters and setting without going through a checklist to see if it qualifies ? 
  yeah , i 'm all for talking about female characters in movies . 
  but to focus on that aspect of it before anything else just seems childish to me . 
  my guess , someone wants to start a fight . 
  and if we had any brains we would just ignore it . 
  where i live , on opening day the movie has 20 screenings starting at 10am . 
  now it 's not a big cinema , but together that is close to 5000 seats for that day ( today , actually ! ), 
  the bigger question is how many people will watch it the second weekend or if everyone who wants to watch it in my small town have already seen it . 
  question : is jennifer lawrence actually a box office draw ? 
  any grading system that fails the thing , well other then ranking of movies to show in a 6 year olds birthday party , is itself a failure . 
  adorable !, 
  if you honestly do n't want to see spoilers then you would avoid the site for a day or two until you had seen it . 
  otherwise i 'm going to take a wild guess and say you 're just a whiny complainer who likes to seem important by pretending not to want to read spoilers . 
  on youtube , beyondtheetrailer has a spoiler review . 
  [ there are spoilers behind this link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mphosaq2wz0 ), 
  [ you asked for spoilers , i provide ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mphosaq2wz0 ), 
  dude , if you really did n't want to see spoilers you would n't be on this site today ( or any sites ) , you pretentious hipster !, 
  oh and by the way ? 
  luke skywalker and han confess their undying love for each other in the first 5 minutes of the movie and the rest of the movie is just all the characters watching the two of them fucking and masturbating to it . 
  for whatever i was imagining ` star wars the force awakens the penis ' to be it was n't this . 
  [ for real ?

  that looks great !, 
  it 's more like a circle where everyone gives to the person on their left .

  you win all of the internet .

  the trailers were terrible , but a friend wanted to see it so i agreed to come along , and i ended up enjoying the movie . 
  and talking about drive , i went in not having seen the trailer . 
  but watching the trailer afterwards made it out to be an entirely different movie then it was . 
  made me think the studio did n't think they could sell the actual movie and tried to sell it with the cars and driving .
