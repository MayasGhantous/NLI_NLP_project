  but it 's not something that promotes * health * either . 
  which was the question . 
  no , football is still the people 's sport . 
  not the same issue , but i had to work a little to make it work . 
  in the end i had n't unpacked the files right and ended up with to many folders . 
  that is so pretty !, 
  huh ... the dads nose makes it more creepy , if that is even possible . 
  the number of negative reviews are staggering compared to positive ones . 
  oh ... there have been a lot of car related injuries here . 
  makes me think i should get a dedicated knitting place in the car . 
  for me i ended up uninstalling everything and then doing it over following [ these instructions ] ( http://modthesims.info/wiki.php?title=game_help:ts3_custom_content ) . 
  then i did it again , because i managed to still get to many folders . 
  but now it works . 
  i recently inherited a bunch of us 0 and smaller needles from my grandmother . 
  i 've put them in a drawer and have no plans of even touching them , because i will break them . 
  this might be a life saver . 
  that looks great !, 
  if i had to pick one it would be snacks and go international . 
  that said colours seems like a lot of fun as well . 
  looking good . 
  i did and got a little overwhelmed ... 
  thank you !, 
  thank you !, 
  eh ... the chocolate in kinder eggs is kind of terrible , the only reason to get it is to open it up and get the toy . 
  there 's been 7 , possibly 8 now , children deaths in 20 years . 
  world wide . 
  so the us is being a nanny state , a hypocritical one , because how often do n't we hear about children accidentally getting shot in those same 20 years . 
  edit : [ interesting article on the subjsect ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/why-are-kinder-surprise-eggs-illegal-in-the-usa-10055273.html ), 
  a plant i might manage to keep alive !, 
  nice . 
  i 've been wanting to make a plush for a while , and this is looking awesome !, 
  i made [ this ] ( https://www.redditgifts.com/gallery/gift/wonderful-september-surprise-1/ ) for the disney exchange on reddit gifts . 
  you can stitch on [ clothing ] ( http://weelittlestitchescrossstitch.blogspot.no/2012/07/how-to-cross-stitch-anything.html ), 
  making 3d anything is fun , but the ornaments look really pretty . 
  i 've been working on a [ tardis model ] ( https://www.etsy.com/no-en/listing/97556865/tardis-in-3d-cross-stitch-plush-pattern?ref=sr_gallery_1&amp;ga_search_query=cross+stitch+3d+tardis&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery ) for a long time . 
  growing up i had no interest in clothing , so when i reached my 20s i had no idea what looked good on me and what went well together . 
  it took a few years before i decided to do something about it . 
  [ i found this blog when i decided to get a functional wardrobe ] ( http://www.puttingmetogether.com/p/wardrobe-from-scratch-series.html ) and it really helped me figure out how to basically get a new wardrobe . 
  [ i used an embroidery hoop . 
  ] ( http://diybydesign.blogspot.no/2012/03/embroidery-hoop-clock.html ), 
  maybe they watered it . 
  that is pretty much the opposite of my problem with plants . 
  hm ... are you financially dependent on them ? 
  because if you 're not then i 'd just move in with the boyfriend and tell them once it 's done . 
  in my experience it 's easier to get forgiveness then permission . 
  this rubs me the wrong way , although i 'm not well read enough on the subject to tell you exactly why . 
  this made me smile, 
  ask people questions , let them talk to you , pay attention to what they say and ask follow up questions . 
  and for a bonus , remember what they said and ask about something from the conversation the next time you see them . 
  that was pretty much my first steps to becoming more approachable . 
  people like you better if they can get something from you . 
  but college will be your chance to break free ? 
  i 'd be vague about where you 're moving , do n't lie , simply do n't tell the truth . 
  then be ready for a mini shitstorm once the truth is out . 
  source : i told my parents i was moving out by asking them if i could borrow the car to move the day before i was moving . 
  i did n't really need the car , but all the papers were signed so the chance for them to talk me out of it was past . 
  i signed up for all three , but have since dropped out of books . 
  was really looking to do just one exchange , but ca n't drop snacks and colours just seem like so much fun . 
  i love you, 
  you know you can just save , right ? 
  makes it easier to find back . 
  thank you !, 
  it really is . 
  is it a sign that i 'm an adult that i 'm here to post the same comment ? 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's because of a mod i recently installed . 
  this was not the consequences i foresaw when i made it possible for teenagers to get pregnant . 
  teach me how !, 
  i want to make a forever family , but i keep getting them killed , or getting tired of them and throwing them out . 
  yup , i just did n't think about it . 
  or that men could get pregnant in the first place . 
  i 'm good at those . 
  keeping them alive , not so much . 
  i was on a pintrest binge , and there is a crazy amount of russian patterns there . 
  and even though i could probably reverse engineer it , i thought about reddit instead . 
  jezebel thinks women live of sex and alcohol . 
  it is ? 
  it is ... i do n't know why that happened . 
  have you ever been to a gynecologist ? 
  because if not , it might be a good idea to go see one just to get a general idea of what is going on down there . 
  that is terrifying . 
  i 'm a transit and lunch break knitter , when i 'm home i 'm to easily distracted . 
  then it 's time to put on the big girl pants and go find yourself a gynecologist . 
  what operating system do you have ? 
  android , windows , ios , or something else . 
  i have n't tried this , but i 've heard that you can put chips on a few minutes before the pizza is done . 
  there really is n't anything you can do other then tell your sister how you feel . 
  but in the end it 's her choice . 
  looking awesome !, 
  my brother in law would love something like this . 
  base game is fine for beginners . 
  as for the game itself there is no nudity , sex is blurred and not even called sex ( its wooohoo ) . 
  on the whole its everyday situations , it encourages you to have the kids go to school and do homework qnd to be a responsible parent . 
  let the 3 v 4 fight begin ... 
  i 'm sorry , but no . 
  though it might encourage her to obsessivly ask people about their codiac sign and look for meteors and or bugs . 
  umm ... to me this reads like the author is mad that young people is n't buying what clinton is selling . 
  it 's great for a plane/bus ride which is where i tend to lose dpns if i try to navigate more then two of them at a time . 
  straights is the same problem , i 'm supper good at dropping things , as for magic loop i just ca n't make it work for me , i 've tried and failed to learn it a number of times . 
  i actually do n't agree with this . 
  if i believed life began at conception , then the idea of abortion would be horrifying to me .
