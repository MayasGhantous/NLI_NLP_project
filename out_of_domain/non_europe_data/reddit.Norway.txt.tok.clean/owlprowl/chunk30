  either abortion is murder or it is n't , you ca n't sit on the fence on this one . 
  this , and that goes for store bought snacks as well , take a look at the expiration date and the packaging and ask yourself if this is going to survive the journey . 
  that is seriously impressive !, 
  i can work with this . 
  the comment section on youtube is n't the best example since it 's filled with trolls who will say anything ( on any video ) to get attention . 
  women get that kind of comments because it 's the best/easiest way to troll them . 
  men usually get comments about their sexuality and lack of masculinity . 
  and hermione is black in it . 
  because we should n't be afraid of the transracials , or something . 
  idk, 
  i 've had the same problem , though not on the same scale . 
  the solutiin might be to block them from seeing your posts . 
  can you lock the door , or any door ? 
  then as soon as possible you get out . 
  rent out `` your part '' of the apartment if you can . 
  you are being to sensitive . 
  hostelworld.com and lonelyplanet is my best advice for traveling . 
  you keep mentioning that you 're disabled , but never say what your disability is . 
  because you obviously have higher brain function , something children born with microcephaly have a good chance of not having . 
  and are we seriously comparing the quality of life a middle class family from texas is able to provide for their handicapped daughter with that of poor people [ in another country ? 
  ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/05/the-struggle-for-universal-healthcare/361854/ ), 
  and the financial strain . 
  for a drug you have to take every day , and you ca n't touch a drop of alcohol when you use it , and the potential side effects are horrifying ( even for medication ) . 
  [ it 's on youtube ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r7n8b8kkze ), 
  and let europeans watch while you 're at it . 
  it 's most likely for private viewing only , just like it says on your dvds . 
  your mother is a hamster and your father smells of elderberries . 
  it 's more a : enjoy this box office flop that no one have thought about since long before it 's 2002 release . 
  have n't this been partly debunked ? 
  that it 's money in the home that makes the difference ? 
  in my opinion , you really do n't need to . 
  it used a lot of words , and tried a little to hard for my taste . 
  i use some cheap a-jays one knock offs . 
  blocks out just the right amount of sound . 
  tell them ( together or separately , whatever makes you most comfortable ) , that you 're really happy for them , but that your own loss is still to hurtful and to please be a little considerate . 
  go to the trashcan and restore what you deleted . 
  i 've specifically asked for flavored salt . 
  so no , you 're not the crazy person here . 
  reese 's are available , but really expensive . 
  that goes for a lot of things . 
  nerds , skittles , fancy oreos , hershey , candy corn ( i mean , i 've heard about those from the internet , and they sound kind of terrible , but i still kind f want to taste ) . 
  i know that 's what everyone says , but i still want to taste the terrible . 
  i have an extensive collection , i 've got a strange fascination for savory like [ this ] ( http://www.spanishoponline.com/store/p3233/soso_fleur_de_sel_tangerine_%26_spices_egg.html ) or [ this ] ( http://www.spanishoponline.com/store/p3231/soso_fleur_de_sel_red_fruits_egg.html ) , but really i just love salt infused with spices . 
  this makes me think the critic , and i will have to do a search to find out who she is , never actually read the books . 
  because if she had read the books , she would know why katniss could never settle down with gale . 
  she does , but she is n't the kind of symbol who does everything right , she is n't a mary sue . 
  if i end up watching roger ebert reviews for the next 2 hours , i 'm hunting you down . 
  that 's a little selfish , i mean did she do something romantic for you ? 
  that is the most effective form for censorship , make the people police themselves . 
  if you have a pintrest account , add it . 
  or amazon wish list . 
  for international , make sure to check if there are some products that are banned for import . 
  i 'd uninstall the mods then install them one by one to see where the problem is . 
  eh , you have an adult relationship . 
  have your romance on another day . 
  oh yeah , if it 's more then a handful mods then this is my recommendation as well . 
  [ woosa ... ] ( https://youtu.be/wwyyqjvnfam?t=40s ), 
  i get it , it 's annoying . 
  but you can chose to get annoyed or you can chose to ignore the post . 
  [ now sing along ] ( https://youtu.be/l0mk7qz13bu?t=1m4s ), 
  adorable !, 
  according to mfp it does n't really contain anything other then salt . 
  it contains [ yellow 5 & 6 ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2957945/ ) which are banned in some countries because of health concerns , but to be honest unless you eat it by the kilo i would n't be worried . 
  i think you dropped a stitch , you can try picking it up again . 
  another alternative is to make a new account and start again . 
  knowledge is power !, 
  i have n't noticed , although the newer mcdonald restaurants have their calories posted on boards by the register . 
  nice one, 
  first picture . 
  the second looks like there was to much give in the thread , is it in the beginning or the end ? 
  that feeling when you talk to empty air . 
  but you 're right , there will always be beginners here , and sometimes as a beginner you panic when there 's a problem and do n't search for similar questions . 
  [ exactly ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-phfzlwvt0 ), 
  it depends on your view on artificial sweeteners . 
  there is some evidence that they increase appetite and that it can cause a rise in blood sugar , but the science is n't clear . 
  my two cents : if it helps you stay away from the full sugar version , and you enjoy them then drinking some is n't harmful . 
  but again , everything in moderation . 
  your mother is wrong . 
  she is being sold faulty logic by someone who have do not have your best interest at heart . 
  for weight loss you should be at a deficit , and yes . 
  very interesting, 
  [ let 's find and beat up this lady dressed in white ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvimcmghmh8 ), 
  i have white work pants , and i always end up wearing a pad for a day or two before i expect my period to start . 
  the pelican brief . 
  i threw that at the wall and had to go get it again so many times . 
  it is a terrible book , but i had to read it to the end to see if it could get any worse . 
  edit : in fact , john grisham have written most of the books i 've hated . 
  but if you turn his books into movies , they 're suddenly not so bad . 
  edit2 : u/sven _ burger have corrected me on the title . 
  pretty much what my giftee did . 
  i 've sent them a message and it i 'm giving it a few days before i start the search . 
  luckily i know exactly what to get my other giftee . 
  it is , my bad . 
  the client was my downfall , because it 's not a bad book . 
  in fact i quite enjoyed it . 
  but the pelican brief is pure , annoying , garbage . 
  and i keep reading his books , because i want to read another the client , but all i get is more pelican briefs . 
  it 's pretty great . 
  burger king is the same online , but in the restaurants they 're less great . 
  the goblet of fire was when the series fell apart for me .
