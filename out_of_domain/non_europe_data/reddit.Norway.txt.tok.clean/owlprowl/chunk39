  pretty much . 
  it 's adorable !, 
  we are all in the same boat . 
  i had not , thank you !, 
  now that 's the only thing i can think about . 
  there are similar protections in place for vaccine producers . 
  hate to break it to you , it 's already [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f720mnvoevc ) ... 
  i once had a sales person take away my shoes when i was trying on new ones . 
  she was really embaraced when she came back with them after she could n't find a shoebox for them . 
  you 're lucky neither of you decided to pull out a [ gun ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2014/01/13/justice/florida-movie-theater-shooting/ ) . 
  i was going to suggest cutting their hands off and feeding it to their parents , but i can settle for sterilization . 
  my local cinema does have a mother and baby screening a few times a week . 
  you rock !, 
  i did n't actually go down in cup-size . 
  i did n't lose that much weight , but my main reason for wanting to lose weight was because my breasts were so big and i had heard the horror stories about how i 'd lose my breasts if i lost weight . 
  but no . 
  still a dd , although the band is a size smaller . 
  i have to include this , because i have n't seen it in the comments . 
  but this is what the prisoners in [ auschwitz-birkenau ] ( http://auschwitz.org/en/history/life-in-the-camp/nutrition ) got to eat :, 
   prisoners received three meals per day . 
  in the morning , they received only half a liter of `` coffee , '' or rather boiled water with a grain-based coffee substitute added , or `` tea '' -- a herbal brew . 
  these beverages were usually unsweetened . 
  the noon meal consisted of about a liter of soup , the main ingredients of which were potatoes , rutabaga , and small amounts of groats , rye flour , and avo food extract . 
  the soup was unappetizing , and newly arrived prisoners were often unable to eat it , or could do so only in disgust . 
  supper consisted of about 300 grams of black bread , served with about 25 grams of sausage , or margarine , or a tablespoon of marmalade or cheese . 
  the bread served in the evening was supposed to cover the needs of the following morning as well , although the famished prisoners usually consumed the whole portion at once . 
  the low nutritional value of these meals should be noted . 
   the combination of insufficient nutrition with hard labor contributed to the destruction of the organism , which gradually used up its stores of fat , muscle mass , and the tissues of the internal organs . 
  this led to emaciation and starvation sickness , the cause of a significant number of deaths in the camp . 
  a prisoner suffering from starvation sickness was referred to as a `` musselman , '' and could easily fall victim to selection for the gas chambers . 
   prisoner nutrition improved to a certain degree in the second half of 1942 , when the camp authorities permitted the receipt of food parcels . 
  jews and soviet pows , however , did not share this privilege . 
  but sure chicken , rice , and lentils ( not even mentioning the amount ) is the same thing . 
  sure . 
  edit : [ more detailed link ] ( http://www.wollheim-memorial.de/en/ernaehrung_en ), 
   it 's good all the holocaust survivors are dead now . 
  are you confessing to killing them ? 
  because if you are then i 'm going to have to report you to the mods . 
  i 'm going out to eat with friends today , i 'm going to try to keep it under $ 50 , that includes 1-2 drinks ( alcohol is really expensive where i live ) . 
  i mean we do n't bring up greece during 2ww or the el ni\u00f1o famines . 
  except a diet of rice , lentils and chicken would be much better then what they got in the concentration camps , even the `` privileged '' prisoners . 
  [ i mean you this diet sounds terrifying ] ( http://www.wollheim-memorial.de/en/ernaehrung_en ), 
  i 'm in the same boat , and i unfortunately do n't have proof of shipping , so i might be out of luck . 
  there is never any sanity in the comments of xojane , even on the few posts that contain sanity . 
  i have the site blocked as biased . 
  all links going back to her own site ? 
  check !, 
  i agree . 
  edit : the manga had time to flesh out the story of the aftermath and what happened , in the movie it all gets crammed together making it confusing to follow the events and takes away the nuances of the story . 
  actually , right now the comment section is more stupid then fatlogic . 
  a vew vegetarians doing their thing , but nothing terrible . 
  can we talk about how many podcasts there are out there ? 
  and this one does n't look all that impressive . 
  i mean , i could not find any numbers for itunes , but for soundcloud there is 49 followers and the podcast with ragen has 32 listens . 
  it 's basically the same interview every single time . 
  unpopular opinion : house of cards . 
  in my opinion there is to much filler and as a result to much unnecessary `` complexity '' . 
  perfect place to stop . 
  i watched a few episodes into season 3 , but had just lost interest . 
  yes !, 
  i lost interest at the halfway point of season 1 but watched the rest of the season to see where it was going . 
  there just was n't enough material to keep it going 22 episode season , let alone another season . 
  bryan fuller has made a few brilliant shows that ended up being cancelled after 1 or 2 seasons and end on a cliffhanger . 
  eh ... maybe , but to me that show was just silly from episode 1 . 
  i love bsg , but i have to agree with you . 
  nice, 
  thank you !, 
  [ xkcd relevant as always . 
  way too many . 
  wish there was something you could do with them , like trade 10 in for a month of elf status .

  [ tomorrow belongs to me ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29mg6gfh9co ) from cabaret . 
  a commenter on youtube said it best, 
   this is a brilliant job of staging and cinematography . 
  when the song was done on the stage , it was in a drawing room . 
  but by placing it outside in the film in a beer garden , fosse uses the camerawork of geoffrey unsworth to concentrate on close-ups . 
  the first shots are of the angelic-looking boy and moving around to the nice-looking faces of seemingly nice , friendly people . 
  as the song develops , it becomes apparant these faces are no longer friendly faces , but faces convinced that tomorrow `` belongs to them . '', 
  the staging of this song might be one of the reasons bob fosse won the best director oscar over francis ford coppola . 
  i 've been running on a treadmill this winter , and things have been going great !, 
  i was thinking i was well on my way to manage a half marathon this summer . 
  then this week i started running outdoor . 
  and it 's killing me . 
  there is no comparison between running on a treadmill and actually going outside , you can use all the ` incline ' you want , but the feel of the ground is so different you might as well be running on a different planet . 
  is that really a thing ? 
  why is that a thing ? 
  it 's a fair assessment of the situation . 
  very little , as far as i can see a psychiatrist have to look at the terms of his confinements , the strip searches will most likely end , and he will not be made to pay for the costs of the trial . 
  but this is just from reading the news , so take it with a grain of salt . 
  he sure is , but 800 strip searches did seem like they were trying to humiliate him and not for security reasons . 
  the fact that he still have access to the legal system , and have rights makes me proud to be from norway . 
  no one forfeits their rights to human rights , that 's not how it works . 
  breivik won on two points, 
  * unnecessary strip searches ( more then 800 since 2012 ), 
  * his mental health was not considered when the conditions for confinement were set . 
  this is about the use of isolation . 
  he 's not getting out of prison , but he like everyone else have the right to humane prison conditions . 
  the guy is more then a little insane .
