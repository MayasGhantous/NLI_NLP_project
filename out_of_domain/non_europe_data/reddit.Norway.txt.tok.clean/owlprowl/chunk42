  depends on the project , but here i agree !, 
  oh good , that 's messed up ... 
  but at the same time i love the pattern , and will now try to find it in order to be where you are in a few weeks . 
  weeping , praying for a death i know will not come . 
  that bacon looks great !, 
  really cute !, 
  * looks at the 4 projects on my couch right now ... *, 
  with how much you 're twisting my arm , how can i not ? 
  those colours really pop !, 
  great find . 
  you truly are a hero . 
  these are so pretty !, 
  i 'm never brave enough to start a project like this . 
  sett opp en cocktail bar .

  `` this glacier have been here for thousands of years , it 's not going to break when i stand under it . '', 
  `` look harold , look at those natives waving their arms around . 
  i think they 're singing , it 's part of their religion , you know . 
  it 's so great that they 've kept their viking religion . '', 
  i 've watched the first 3 seasons in 4 days . 
  in fact , it 's 03:30 and i just finished the season . 
  how many seasons does netflix have in your region ? 
  i only got two seasons and had to track it down elsewhere . 
  great work , and i love the colour !, 
  you keep using that word , but seriously canadians pay for healthcare through their taxes . 
  noghing is for free . 
  this story is from canada . 
  am i the only one who read unthinkable and though he fucked the puppy ? 
  i 'm really sorry , but when you write that i have to link to [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/zxczmrldqz0?t=6m25s ) and [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg_ll9m7cl4 ), 
  thank you for the advice !, 
  halfway through i wad ready to downvote , but you get an upvote instead . 
  just finished as well , listened to audiobook . 
  it 's not a bad book , but not as great as some claim . 
  at a point , the book started to remind me a lot of another book , [ making history ] ( http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/317457.making_history ) by stephen fry . 
  and not in a good way . 
  all in all , i got to the end , but it was a struggle and i left the book several times . 
  i did n't have a problem remembering where i 'd left of because king has a habit of explaining things to death . 
  in my opinion this book would have been better if it had been shorter , more focused . 
  i 'm thinking about reading under the dome , is it worth it ? 
  i 'll give it a shot !, 
  i ask , because i watched a few episodes of the series and did n't like it . 
  takk for den . 
  thanks . 
  so the lesson is , if you see an accident drive past as quickly as possible . 
  got it . 
  til do n't stop to help if you see someones been in a car accident , or you 'll end up with a bill , and keep your mouth shut if your boss tells you to do something illegal , because he 's not the one who 's going to get into trouble . 
  great day , great lessons . 
  old , but still relevant http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/06/15/water-hazard-florida-tries-to-keep-people-and-alligators-apart/?src=longreads&amp;_r=0, 
  alligators who are a nuance to humans gets euthanized . 
  there 's just to many of them , and they tend to go back where they came from , even over great distances . 
  the martian . 
  i still laugh at the dad jokes . 
  i have n't read it 100 times , but it is a book that i can pick up and read as a whole or just parts . 
  i 'm pretty sure canal + owns the rights in spain . 
  [ i miss bill clinton ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zej3h8wch_i ), 
  their [ power rangers collection ] ( http://imgur.com/a/b9wpk ) disagrees ... 
  venezuela is making a strong play as well . 
  yes , i read it . 
  i just do n't think it 's a good , or plausible idea . 
  how many alligators are they supposed to keep in these zoos ? 
  where would the money to feed them , and upkeep come from ? 
  that had the same quality as your average episode of derrick . 
  is it affiliated with r/thathappened because som of the stories $ 100 % happened . 
  i 'm starting to feel old , my favorite stories are being deleted and there are fewer , if any new stories in my fandoms . 
  i should find a new fandom , but i have no idea how to do that anymore . 
  theres been a few through the years , i started with harry potter and then followed my favourite author to csi and stargate . 
  but the ones i always come back to is battlestar galactica , stargate atlantis , brothers and sisters , the west wing , and house md. 
  i 've dabbled in other fandoms , but i 'm not a big fan of pwp or sex heavy fics . 
  i like long , epic angsty stories . 
  on a positive note i recently watched the entire run of person of interest , but with delicious the terrible thing it 's turned into im having problems finding stories . 
  i have only watched a few episodes of jessica jones , but canon divergent is my favourite kind of stories . 
  bring on the criminal minds !, 
  i love me some non-slash stories , i was obsesswd with criminal minds/supernatural crossovers for a long time . 
  question : where do you find new stories ? 
  i used to find them through delicious , but that site is close to useless now . 
  i kind of prefer to get recommendations , instead of searching through a lot of new stories of questionable quality . 
  i 'm getting old and lazy . 
  thank you !, 
  i 'm a little green when it comes to using ao3 , but will venture into the bookmarks . 
  hopefully this ends up better then in venezuela, 
  but as long as it 's the same people running the unions , nothing will change . 
  so , i tend to read the fics i love over and over . 
  how do you , awesome people , keep track of fics you 've read and love ? 
  or do you read them once and that 's it ? 
  depends . 
  if the au is a blatant author insert , and a mary sue , i 'm out of there pretty fast . 
  and if the oc gets to much attention i usually skip out unless it 's an amazingly written story . 
  stupid question , how do you transfer to your kindle ? 
  is it just the ao3 stories , or can you get from ff.net and livejournal as well ? 
  depends entirely on what time you posted , if most of your potential readers are at school/work/sleeping , you ca n't expect as many hits as someone who posts at the perfect time . 
  go for a run , take a shower , do some laundry and wait until tomorrow to look again . 
  i love watching all the american holidays . 
  i 'm a little on the fence . 
  i 'm sad that it 's over , but glad it ended while it was still great . 
  to be fair , have you seen the earlier jon stewart episodes ? 
  they were pretty terrible . 
  he got a lucky break with 9/11 giving him something to work with . 
  as a knitter who is just learning how to crochet , i say this person is an asshole . 
  and seriously , all yarn stores i know about cater to both groups . 
  this might be because i live in a tiny city , but really that just seems silly .
