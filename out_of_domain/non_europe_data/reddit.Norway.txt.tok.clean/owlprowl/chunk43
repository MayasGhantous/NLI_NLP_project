  i 'm the lone knitter in a yarn group , and while there is the occasional knitting joke , i never get any shit from the crochet crowd . 
  * internet hug *, 
  seriously , what is wrong with people ? 
  i 've had people try to explain crochet to me , i would love to make some amigurumi , but i just ca n't get the magic ring to work . 
  oh ... it might actually do that . 
  will try tomorrow , after i 've finished this dress i 'm working on . 
  that was a come to jesus moment for me . 
  i got what was happening in those gifs . 
  seriously , i think i can do that . 
  no , marvel movies and comics/netflix are two different entities that does not work together and do not like each other . 
  i think the relative popularity of new purge movie will restart something . 
  one of the reasons is that it 's election season , and there is no better press then criticizing other people/groups . 
  i remember a few years back when the us , iran , and israel all had elections around the same time . 
  there was a lot of talk about nuclear war . 
   bruce nuclear power plant, 
  i brainfarted and thought your friends uncle had built his own nuclear power plant . 
  also ; if i 'm on a watch list for googling that , i 'm blaming you . 
  trick question , the answer is obviously a lot , because you keep making them . 
  it is really pretty . 
  i like that little dash of colour . 
  no , because he was obviously immune after meeting all those presidents . 
  that joke cost $ 19.3 billion . 
  you better be laughing . 
  [ there 's something about mary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egjxwdypole ) . 
  people were laughing so hard you could n't hear what was being said , and it got a standing ovation at the end . 
  norway is a big polluter from the oil industry . 
  so maybe switch those around ? 
  that 's so cute !!!!, 
  i just googled nasa budget and took the first number , wikipedia i believe , i found . 
  if they did , i 'd consider moving to canada . 
  actually gay or actor mention it in interview gay and we 're supposed to infer it from subtext ? 
  i 'm re-reading a long , maybe even a little to long , avengers au with loki reincarnated as a woman . 
  it 's funny , absurd , and long . 
  with just enough plot that you keep reading . 
  [ a bright and bitter flame ] ( http://archiveofourown.org/works/534937/chapters/949583 ), 
  that is so smart looking !, 
  neither good or bad . 
  he worked hard to keep truman happy , because it was his job . 
  looking good . 
  the best examples would be documentaries , and the ones about food in particular : super size me , anything to do with veganism/juicing etc. 
  but for movies :, 
  zero dark thirty told us torture is effective in getting information . 
  american sniper, 
  i 've wanted to learn how to crochet for a while now , and while i can do the back and forth , i wanted to make some nice granny squares . 
  but i was stuck on the magic ring . 
  no matter how many times people showed me how to do it , or how many tutorials i watched i could not get it . 
  but that is where / u/rachycarebear came in with the most amazing [ link ] ( http://crochet-gifs.tumblr.com/post/49453249455/learn-to-crochet-crochet-gif-tutorials-the-magic ) that made it so clear what i had to do that i felt silly for not getting it before . 
  thank you , awesome crocheters , i will soon be one of you !, 
  so cute !, 
  you made my heart grow three sizes . 
  it 's beautiful and heartfelt . 
  good luck catching 'em all !, 
  with these adorable pokeballs , you 're bound to succeed !, 
  we would be lucky , more like delicious jellyfish and algae . 
  since it 's not regulated you can sell pretty much anything as ecstasy . 
  a way to up profits is to cut costs by using cheaper ingredients . 
  if you 're lucky it 's baking powder , if you 're not it 's rat poison . 
  this is what happens when home economics is removed from the lesson plan . 
  tweens no longer know what the correct price for drugs are . 
  i know a few festivals have/had facilities where you could get your drugs tested free of charge . 
  although i 'm pretty sure this is n't a thing anymore . 
  that and a ` cook/grow your own ! ', 
  so much this . 
  seriously ? 
  now i 'm even more glad that i never finished that movie . 
  nope , i was cheering for him the entire movie . 
  the end was just stupid , and out of the blue . 
  in many ways the movie was better then the novel , but the book handled the ending much better . 
  the issue comes when women do n't pass the same standards and politicians start talking about goals and how to reach them and the military , who now have a quota of women to fill lowers standards in order to reach the numbers . 
  the reviews i 've seen have been positive , so depending on the weather it could . 
  not to scare you , but there 's a problem with pesticide residues in illegally grown weed , again because of a lack of regulations .

  ~ ~ i 'm against women in combat as long as they pass the same standards . ~ ~, 
  this makes no sense , i 'm sorry for fucking up . 
  for the record , i am * not * against women in combat roles . 
  i would n't have had anything against butler being taken down at the end if the ending was better . 
  do you know how farming of marijuana is regulated ? 
  what agency have oversight ? 
  i 've been wondering about it , do the illegal growers go legit , have bigger companies taken over , or is it the artisan small batch growers who flourish ? 
  that looks amazingly strange . 
  yup , it 's like affirmative action in the us that helps more white women then the minorities it was intended to help . 
  i really like her point of view on this . 
  she is very nuanced , even though she does have some strange preferences . 
  yeah , she says that for her it 's worth watching * despite * the flaws . 
  she literally calls it a popcorn movie . 
  there 's barely any reviews at all in popular . 
  there 's two on the first page , one is pretty meh about it and the other is a video that on the whole positive although it does point out that there are flaws . 
  i do n't see this giant hate campaign you 're referring to , maybe it 's time for you to take your meds . 
  i get why it was cut out , and it does n't really bring anything to the plot , but i really like the scene from fellowship of the ring where pippin and merry eat to many elf crackers . 
  it 's just a nice and light character moment . 
  what kind of movies do you like ? 
  action , crime , drama , historical ? 
  and now i 'm [ whistling ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoujxrvh1ss ), 
  what is n't good ? 
  sort by new and it pretty much is . 
  from what i 've seen most reviews are kind of meh on the movie . 
  beyond the trailer had a fairly positive review with little sjw talk . 
  she called it an enjoyable popcorn movie . 
  i never actually got around to watch it . 
  putting it on my list !,
