  no , because lying makes baby jesus cry , and hitler to compulsory masturbate . 
  that 's because no one have told the homeopaths yet . 
  they can make it into a cure for something . 
  i ruptured an eardrum a few years ago ( strep that went to the middle ear , when it finally popped i was so relieved because the pain ended ) . 
  after that for a few days i heard in double tones , it was really freaky . 
  then it went over to tinnitus that luckily disappeared within a week . 
  to live like that for years ? 
  i 'd go mad . 
  thing is , [ pain is relative ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fqgyz9a.jpg ) . 
   the atlantic, 
  link ? 
  personally i think sony , feig , and fanboys all made some terrible choices when it comes to this movie . 
  that and the costume department , those jumpsuits look horrible . 
  the release date for this where i live is the end of the month , and who knows if i 'm going to end up watching it . 
  one of my best friends love mellisa mccatney . 
  so i might end up watching it . 
  i would love more great female driven movies , i 'm going to watch ` the shallows ' the day it 's released . 
  i remember reading an article about how people call the phone numbers used in movies . 
  how is your social/family network ? 
  do you have people you can rely on if you suddenly find yourself not being stable , or if your partner takes a turn for the worst and need more help ? 
  that 's my biggest problem with ff.net , that there is no kudos alternative . 
  i pretty much leave comments when i have questions or need clarifications , or if there is something i love or hate about the chapter . 
  eh ... ignores to many facts and replaces it with feels . 
  deleted a long time ago . 
  but of the ones i can still link to , in no particular order :, 
  * i have a thing for crossovers . 
  this is a thick of it / the west wing crossover : [ life during wartime ] ( http://archiveofourown.org/works/104059/chapters/143123 ) , where cj meets malcolm tucker, 
  * depressing post movie for the social network : [ homo , fuge ] ( http://archiveofourown.org/works/2268624/chapters/4983552 ) , eduardo sells his soul to the devil and hi-jinks ensures . 
  * abandoned harry potter/avengers crossover : [ i see the moon ] ( https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8212843/1/i-see-the-moon ) , beating voldemort broke harry and he meets bruce banner . 
  i cry every time i read this story . 
  * spider-man is adopted by tony stark and meets every single marvel villain ever imagined . 
  it 's still wip , and updating is slow ; [ peter parker 's home for the wayward villain ] ( http://archiveofourown.org/works/3135464/chapters/6796619 ), 
  * harry potter story , that feeds into my what if ' obsession by making lily not a witch . 
  she still meets james ; [ just stay here tonight ] ( https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9506432/1/just-stay-here-tonight ), 
  * battlestar galactica story about gaeta and kara thrace ; [ alpha & omega series ] ( http://rapfic.livejournal.com/8449.html ), 
  * again a strange crossover , this time the social network and the movie boy a ; [ x marks the spot ( where a boy used to be ) ] ( http://devoidly.livejournal.com/1353.html ), 
  in the end i 'm throwing my [ delicious ] ( http://del.icio.us/mongonom/fanfiction ) account at you . 
  everything that is n't marked to read is things i love . 
  did they add a random girl character ? 
  those colour changes work perfect . 
  like the yarn was made for you to do this project . 
  i waited almost 2 months for a package to get to the ukraine , while one i sent to the us arrived , in normal mail , in less then a week . 
  there is no rhyme or reason , you just have to cross your fingers and hope for the best . 
  honest question ; how much does it cost for a box of tampons , or pads , in the us ? 
  how are they planning on enforcing this ? 
  it 's worth giving it a chance . 
  personally i did n't like it , but as you see here the ones who do like it love it . 
  i 'm new to embroidery as well , but i 've done cross stitch for a long time . 
  most of the time i make things as gifts . 
  either framing it or using embroidery hoop depending on the shape . 
  that leaves more room for fucking !, 
  and descriptions of food !, 
  there are countless youtubers doing the mst3k thing , they will have a hard time finding movies that have n't been shit on by way to many people already . 
  i 'm not sure how i fe l about this . 
  keeping up appearance worked because the actors were great in it . 
  not sure if it will work with younger actors . 
  person of interest , starts out as your average vigilanti solves crimes with the help of surveilance but soon becomes so much more interesting . 
  i watched all 5 seasons in a week , it has a real ending and it 's perfect . 
  that looks amazing . 
  the colours and how you put it together , and the pattern is adorable . 
  if you have some john sheppard whump fics to rec , i 'm always looking . 
  do you have link to fools rush in ? 
  i 've read it before and lost the link . 
  have they ? 
  oh , what 's your fandoms ? 
  a bit like the way i scroll past anytime the author decides to add song lyrics in the middle of the story . 
  it does n't offend me , but i 'm not going to listen to the music either . 
  good to hear the us have a crazy green party as well . 
  i really want it to go back to the colour wheel , and giving more options for recolouring . 
  that and i do n't like that you ca n't , or i do n't get how , you can have sims in two different locations and keep playing both of them . 
  well that is frustrating , . 
  i 've given myself a week where i only play sims 4 to get used to it , i 'm on day 2 and ... i think i 'm going to go back to 3 . 
  it 's just a better game . 
  the hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy by douglas adams ; does n't fit all your criteria , but you should read it if you have n't . 
  the sparrow by mary doria russell, 
  the rama series by arthur c. clarke, 
  that is adorable !, 
  i 'm going to look for it next time i play , if it 's there i might find it . 
  i 'm terrible at hide and seek . 
  it 's perfect !, 
  and while i know that back stitches are magic , i still hate doing them . 
  of course i 've already watched it . 
  it really is that awesome . 
  my grandmother lived in an appartment block that was meant for people on disability and elderly who needed extra help . 
  it was a nice enough place , until they got an influx of addicts after the county decided that there were n't enough used syringes in the hallways . 
  well , there 's not a shortage now . 
  shitty kids is one thing , these idiots are in their 20s and older . 
  i 'm not going to bitch about people going through graveyards since i jog through one a few times a week . 
  but as you said there 's ways to be respectful about it . 
  do n't be a dick should be pokemon gos catchphrase instead of catch em all . 
  i want to place my own lots . 
  tiny lots on top of mountains where it takes my sim the entire afternoon to get home . 
  and i want landscaping tools . 
  4 is just to ... clean for my taste . 
  they can breastfeed . 
  people of jewish herritage who did n't know they were concidered jewish before hitler came to power and they found out their marriages were no longer valid because they had a grandmother who was jewish . 
  so a bit like ' la vita \u00e8 bella ' from the kids point of view ? 
  you get an a for effort , but an f for execution . 
  or maybe they have a grandmother who was a muggle , so a jew who converted to catholicism to get married . 
  would still be considered jewish , even if their grandmother did n't ever talk about their heritage .
