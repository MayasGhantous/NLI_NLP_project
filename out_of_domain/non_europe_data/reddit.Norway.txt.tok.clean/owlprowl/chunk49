  that is painfully adorable . 
  i really like this , reminds me a little of a lego picture i saw once . 
  the blocky look is great here . 
  pretty much the only time i 've used windings . 
  pretty sure they changed it . 
  i was using graph paper and it just ended up looking clunky . 
  will try out [ this ] ( https://www.pic2pat.com/index.en.html ) when i get home . 
  thanks for the advice !, 
  it 's one big clusterfuck . 
  i 'm not sure there is anything that can be done . 
  we can stop isis from taking more land , but the idea behind it ca n't be stopped . 
  the best way to undo this is to either find out where doctor who is , or invent a time machine and go back and either smother george w bush , or maybe prevent him from sobering up . 
  maybe prevent howard dean from screaming like an idiot ? 
  personally i think saudi-arabia and turkey are both big parts of the problem , sitting on the fence and spending more time trying to kill the kurds then fighting isis . 
  as of the beginning of august [ this ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-27838034 ) map shows who was in control of what in the area . 
  trying to quarantine the isis controlled areas is n't plausible . 
  the best way to crack down on isis is to go after the money . 
  going after the oil and gas convoys would cut their income by about 1/3 , that they will have to make up for somehow . 
  if you at the same time put efforts into stopping the trafficking of antiquities and phosphate you 're getting closer to bankrupting them . 
  in short , stop money from flowing into the area . 
  then there 's stopping foreign fighters from joining . 
  so where are these people from ? 
  what made them want to join isis , and how do we change the conditions that contributes to radicalization ? 
  so pretty much social work . 
  there really is n't a good answer . 
  because the conflict is n't one conflict , it 's several conflicts . 
  and to think that they us can solve this is more then a little arrogant . 
  i recommend watching the movie [ no end in sight ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke3qzbnyg2q ) about what happened right after the iraq war . 
  i do n't think you could get an army big enough , or personnel qualified enough , to get the job done for the years and even decades it would take to get through this . 
  but to be honest i 'm not smart enough , or well read enough , to even start on this one . 
  edit : [ this ] ( https://www.buzzfeed.com/mikegiglio/inside-the-real-us-ground-war-on-isis?utm_term=.pkxjmqy7n&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=longform%20821&amp;utm_content=longform%20821+cid_ab3f8944b6d739a8b93746be8899765e&amp;utm_source=buzzfeed%20newsletters#.ugr8j03mk ) is an interesting read on what the us is doing . 
  i agree with you , shit , my ancient history teacher always told us that everything could be blamed on the romans . 
  even here you can draw lines back to the fall of the roman empire . 
  i have an obese coworker who have started posting pictures every day of herself and her sister on exercise bikes . 
  she says she lifts weights 4 times a week and always say she 's so tired from all the workouts she 's getting and does n't understand why she is n't losing weight . 
  if she eats at home , the way she eats ( and drinks ) at work , i know why she is n't losing weight . 
  rl stine has some great books . 
  we 've seen what the inside of her car looks like . 
  we know what she eats . 
  - jurassic park , michael chrichton, 
  - the three-body problem , liu cixin, 
  - the left hand of darkness , ursula k le guin, 
  - the day of the triffids , john wyndham, 
  - the postman , david brin, 
  - out of the silent planet , c s lewis \u00a8, 
  - a princess of mars , edgar rice burroughs, 
  - ender 's game , orson scott card, 
  - dune , frank herbert, 
  - ringworld , larry niven, 
  - the martian chronicles , ray bradbury, 
  - the mote in gods eye , niven and pournelle, 
  you 're right about the postman , bur in it 's defence it is so much better , low tec post-apocalyptic story . 
  you 're also right about both ringworld and dune , i just tend to forget since i just read the first book and ignore the existence of the rest . 
  jurrasic park is n't the most obvious sci-fi , but it is an amazing book that is better then the movie , and the movie is the bomb . 
  dude , he says himself that the reason why he did n't see trump was because he did n't follow his own numbers . 
  i recently read the first few chapters of a story where the author in the first chapter just randomly changed the name of the main character . 
  no real reason , just because the main character felt like it . 
  it was a blatant self insert . 
  an hour ago , so i 'll try again in a few hours !, 
  thank you for the reply !, 
  this is the stitch i learned to crochet for , and then never got around to make the scarf i wanted from it . 
  wait ... that song is n't a limp bizkit original ? 
  mind officially blown !, 
  [ bargaining ] ( https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9963063/1/bargaining ) , posted on ff.net, 
  it 's about loki and traveling back in time to right your wrongs , and sacrifice and making me cry when sitting on the bus . 
  seriously , i cried so much while reading this . 
  the bigger question is if they will actually remove people from the books or just keep them on in secret like they 've always done . 
  you did a lovely thing , althogh no alaska ? 
  this looks great !, 
  the first book that came to mind was [ green rider ] ( https://www.google.no/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahukewiw44laxpxoahwi3swkhxyzcueqfgg1mam&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fen.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fgreen_rider&amp;usg=afqjcngcnesvpexsoxy2pupkkddnotxvkg&amp;sig2=27pw_ydwckiu8rhpnhy0pa ) by kristen britain . 
  i read a lot of cheap fantasy books when i was a teen , and picked up a few recently . 
  they were very fanfictiony . 
  but then again a lot of the books i read were the first books the authors had published , and their later works were much better . 
  there 's a bunch of books that came out after hunger games that were ... inspired by the books . 
  so it 's literally fanfiction . 
  although , i 'm pretty sure the author stole the plot from fanfiction , that or they wrote the fanfiction in the first place . 
  in norway a commercial broadcaster won the rights to send the olympics , but they did n't want the paralympics so those are being shown on the national broadcast . 
  watching a guy shoot an arrow at a target is boring , watching a one armed guy in a wheelchair doing the same is fucking awesome . 
  thank you !, 
  * blush * i though it was a frog . 
  never mind !, 
  great work , i love the colours used , how did you decide on the colours for which state ? 
  well , that was anti climatic . 
  call the police , they 'll call the military . 
  lucky them we have this thing called antibiotics now . 
  i 'm easily distracted , and i read at a snails pace . 
  which , incidentally is why i love to listen to audio-books while i go running . 
  it helps me keep my focus . 
  question , what kind of books do you read ? 
  do you keep a clear impression of each book , or do they sort of bleed into each other ? 
  as someone who ca n't watch to many movies in a week because i mix the plots , this seems daunting . 
  if they can move it they will take it somewhere else to blow it up , if they ca n't they will blow it up where it is . 
  til : pennies comes from trucks , not heaven . 
  there was a big circle jerk on one of the netflix subs about who had watched shows in the shortest amount of time . 
  so it 's not only book people , although book people tend to be a little more smug . 
  i like reading , i 'm just not very efficient at it . 
  is r/52books like a book club , or can you pick your own books ? 
  there 's nothing wrong with keeping it as a personal challenge , but when you talk with others about the books you should focus on what the book is about and not the number of books you 've read . 
  you can even claim to be a minor until you 're way past 30 , and no one will question you . 
  come and see,
