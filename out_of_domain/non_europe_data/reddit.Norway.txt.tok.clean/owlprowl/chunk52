  as you go , you will go from kind-of-running , to actually running and it will be awesome !, 
  if you want to track your pacing i use runtastic in addition to zombierun . 
  watching the pace get closer and closer to actually running is kind of amazing !, 
  i 've seen his stand up stuff , and i really liked it !, 
  so my conclusion is that he just does n't fit the material the writers are giving him . 
  i do n't believe him when he talks about the us electoral system , because he does n't have the same passion for it that jon stewart had . 
  he lacks the barely contained rage . 
  they are trying to just fit him into the seat of stewart , and it might get better as he makes the show his own the way stewart did in the first few seasons . 
  for me i love the santas `` local '' candy , so the brands that you ca n't get or is very expensive to get where i live . 
  so any cadbury chocolate , polo mints , jelly babies , anything black currant-flavored, 
  nope !, 
  and there you see , local candy brands that i did n't even think about . 
  but the thing is , i do n't think it 's bad material . 
  it 's just not the right material for noah . 
  and seriously ? 
  you 're more then a little pretentious if you think that your definition of what is funny is right . 
  there 's no rules for what 's funny , time for you to get over yourself . 
  there 's nothing wrong with having a preference , but you have to understand that the point of comedy is n't to make you laugh , or even to make billy crystal fans laugh , it 's to make people pay money to watch something . 
  it 's the same as when people complain about adam sandler or chuck lorre comedies . 
  they continue being made because they make a shitton of money , and you have to respect them for clearly understanding something about what people want to watch . 
  bad op , seriously is it that hard to have the title and region in the header ? 
  that is so pretty . 
  love the colour blend !, 
  in my experience it 's pretty accurate , i use runkeeper or strava in addition and the numbers match up . 
  but i use an android phone, 
  are you using gps or pedometer ? 
  that 's interesting , is there a difference between the android and ios apps ? 
  how do they compare when you use another app ? 
  edit : hvor bor du ? 
  eat it twilight :, 
  [ lj ] ( http://liliaeth.livejournal.com/339296.html ) or [ff.net ] ( https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5610365/1/eat-it-twilight ), 
  it 's a crossover with criminal minds , but not unreadable if you do n't know that much about cm . 
  there 's some great character work here . 
  i 'm really jelly !, 
  they are pretty , with nice colours , i 'd make them into cards and given to family for birthdays . 
  i recently bought the complete ts1 for $ 1 , and this tank was one of the reasons . 
  i have n't tried to install in yet , but really hoping it 'll work !, 
  the author have several good stories , a lot of crossovers . 
  but there 's a handful of supernatural stories , like [ tempering the blade ] ( https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6557516/1/tempering-the-blades ) , a pre-series about the winchesters and the cps . 
  i generally have a little more faith in humankind . 
  but if this really is fake ? 
  that might change . 
  although , french police ? 
  i 'm not sure if i entirely trust them ... 
  i see that argument as well . 
  i 'm just going to refrain from having strong opinions on this until there 's more facts . 
  it 's not that i do n't trust the french police , i do n't trust the claims from anyone who 's been embarrassed the way the french police have been . 
  in my experience they tend to look for someone to blame . 
  that 's my take as well , police protect their own . 
  this is the same for any country . 
  if she really was robbed , then dressing like police is a great way to gain entrance . 
  if she was n't robbed , telling they were dressed like police is a great way to add some wow factor to your story . 
  that 's one way to market a book . 
  the martian . 
  the book is 90 % inner monolouge dad humour , and r. c. bray has this casual and still emotional way of reading that i think really worked . 
  the accents do get a little silly , but not to the determent of the story . 
  great parts of booktube will spend more time talking about the colour choice then the actual book . 
  that was very comprehensive !, 
  well , there 's no incentive for suspects to be taken alive when they face life in prison or the death penalty either . 
  should those be abolished ? 
  thank you !, 
  doing the last run today and trying to keep positive !, 
  no , the law was written and accepted before , that 's just when it became part of law . 
  and to be fair it was n't a new law as much as a rewrite of an old law . 
  many terrible movies have great trailers . 
  and if you watch an asylum movie thinking it 's going to be a masterpiece you 're the greater fool . 
  i did something similar this spring . 
  there was a big storm in the winter and when the snow melted in early spring i went running on some paths that they had n't cleaned up yet . 
  climbing over and under the trees was fun . 
  i went hiking today . 
  it was n't all that long , just a little over 5k , but it was a pretty steep climb . 
  so when i got home , after i 'd showered , i wanted to finish up a gift for a coworkers new baby . 
  and ... my hands refused to work with me . 
  that combined with the fact that i could n't keep my arms up and the gift is going to be a little later . 
  for those not logged in it 's the first two patterns , the triangle scarf/cowls . 
  my google fu is failing me today . 
  but i 'm sure i 've seen the pattern somewhere , possibly on ravelry . 
  the shoulder details are magical !, 
  i love you !, 
  and i promis not to post pintrest links again . 
  i 'm savibg the link so i can remember it and delete it without watching another time . 
  should we play the classic game ; isis or mexican cartel ?

  i did n't add the south-american or the turkish men since i do n't know what side of the the poc line they fall on . 
  i 'd riot over marmite . 
  i 'm on this strange musical binge as of late .
