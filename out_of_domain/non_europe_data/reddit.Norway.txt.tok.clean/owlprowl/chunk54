  i think she did this on purpose following the ` all press is good press ' school of thought . 
  i mean , when was the last time news sites mentioned her at all ? 
  this . 
  her music is in large ignored , she 's been in mother mode for the last few years . 
  i bet she has a project coming out soon . 
  never heard of the character , but that is a really nice dress ... 
  if it 's good enough for cnn , it 's good enough for me . 
  that looks amazing !, 
  could you show the inside ? 
  full squats are harder on the knees , and the half are a better introduction . 
  if you want to you can just change them to full squats . 
  eller mani . 
  i am a tiny person . 
  you know what my favourite clothing stores are ? 
  the few that have a separate petite section , so that i do n't have to search through things that are too long . 
  personally , if i was a + size i would appreciate not having to search through all the other cloths to find something that fits . 
  and yes , i drag my average hight shopping friend into petite sections . 
  i love it !, 
  this , along with the book would be an amazing christmas gift !, 
  pattern from [ etsy ] ( https://www.etsy.com/no-en/transaction/1190475110 ), 
  what ca n't you use it for ? 
  i 'm going to recommend this [ book ] ( http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/sources/extreme-double-knitting-new-adventures-in-reversible-colorwork/patterns ) . 
  covers a lot of different projects and techniques . 
  i 'm going to have to disagree with it being difficult , the worst part is making a pattern , after that it 's just a question of following a chart . 
  i spent some time getting the charts right , finding what wotks for me . 
  and it does take some time to set it up right . 
  or make a sweater with thin yarn and have a reversible sweater !, 
  i 'm a freak who likes to weave in ends , so no problem !, 
  i 'm glad we focused on the same thing . 
  it is harder then it looks , getting in the right positions and keeping them demands both flexibility and some muscle control . 
  still does n't burn many calories . 
  * sigh *, 
  he was named ` man of the year ' , in a oh by the way men can be good as well . 
  a quick `` this is the closest you 'll ever come to touching a woman '' , and then report them . 
  this just makes women seem weak . 
  your symptoms could indicate anemia , but get blood work and do n't just start taking supplements since the symptoms for too much iron are pretty much the same . 
  stand in front of the mirror . 
  say no , and variations of it . 
  watch this [ ted talk ] ( https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are?language=en ) about body language . 
  next time she brings it up , tell her that you 're trying and that it 's hard and ask her if she could stop bringing it up every time you meet because it hurts . 
  or you can ask your man to have the conversation with her , depending on your family dynamics . 
  i did not know this was a thing !, 
  ca n't do it this year , i have a baby blanket and a handful christmas presents to complete . 
  but i might do it in january or february when i 'm looking for projects . 
  that us nutritional information setup is more confusing then helpful . 
  i see this as a gateway drug , next thing you 'll be sneaking out at night to make overs for lamp posts and trees . 
  your teaching yourself project looks so much better then mine !, 
  these are adorable !,

  last year i sat until midnight on the 23rd to finish the last of the 7 [ fox cowls ] ( http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/failynn-fox-cowl ) i was making for every child in my immediate family . 
  i was collaborating on the gifts with my sister who made the adult gifts , so they had to get done . 
  and no , i absolutely did n't start on them before the beginning of december and on the 15th i had finished 2 . 
  those last two weeks were fuelled by red bull . 
  and the worst part ? 
  this year i 'm pretty sure will be exactly the same , except there are two more babies to knit for and one soon to be baby . 
  that 's the pattern i 'm planning on going for !, 
  the long list :, 
  i am 8 and two half squares out of 28 and 8 half squares into [ this baby blanket ] ( http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/triforce-blanket ) . 
  edit : the baby is n't due before after christmas so this will most likely be put aside as soon as i get yarn for the other projects . 
  my mother is getting double knitted pulse warmers , i do n't have a pattern . 
  i 've found a [ crochet dinosaur mittens pattern ] ( http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/jurassic-inspired-dinosaur-gloves ) to make for the 3 eldest children ( all between 2-4 year old ), 
  planning on adding one or two of these [ tiny snowmen ] ( http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/mochimochi-snowmen ) into the gifts for the adult part of the family ( they are all getting home made chutney and liqueur ) . 
  one baby gets this [ tunic/dress ] ( http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/the-emma-tunic---teeny-sizes ), 
  then there 's two one year olds who i 'm at a complete loss what to get . 
  i 'm thinking of making a frida kahlo doll for my niece , but i do n't have enough time . 
  my second thought is to make them hats or cowls of some sort . 
  as you can see , short of inventing a time machine there is no way for me to finish all of this . 
  tell them you do n't have time and point them towards etsy . 
  that 's ... amazing . 
  i have the same problem !, 
  there 's a 40 and a 40a , and i get phone calls from confused drivers who 's standing at the wrong address . 
  it 's not far to walk to the other house , but it 's quite the long drive , so i usually end up just telling them to wait a few minutes and i 'll be there . 
  that makes it harder then walking through two gardens . 
  a bigger problem for me is that fedex does n't operate in my city , so the packages go to the capital where they get handed over to another carrier who put on new shipping labels . 
  no problem right , they need their own bar codes , i get it . 
  except they are terrible at transcribing the address . 
  there 's always at least one error , once it got sent to the wrong city . 
  she 's turn 1 on christmas day . 
  soft is great , but i wanted to make the head a little better at holding the shape . 
  time to knit some new socks !, 
  like hermiones everyday socks !, 
  you 're really lucky i 'm on mobile or there would be links to at least 5 different patterns . 
  work in a nursing home , much lower pay then cops , we do n't disrespect the dead . 
  the number of people who believed that kindergarteners were flown to mexico to be gangraped and made to watch infants be slaughtered and flown home before end of day should be an indicator of how stupid people are . 
  * looks over at full yarn cabinet *, 
  i never have enough yarn ... 
  as for crochet patterns i tend to collect different stitches and not patterns , but from my pintrest i picked out my ~ ~ top three ~ ~ favourite sock patterns :, 
  [ basic socks ] ( http://www.garnstudio.com/pattern.php?id=6217&amp;cid=17 ), 
  ] ( http://thewhoot.com.au/whoot-news/crafty-corner/granny-square-slipper-boots ) i love granny squares , the next step will be [ granny square plushies ] ( http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/smaug-the-african-flower-dragon ), 
  [ yoga socks !, 
  ] ( https://www.plymouthyarn.com/f643 ) and not * just * because i hate making heels . 
  [ shoes ] ( http://shushshandmadestuff.blogspot.no/p/blog-page_6527.html ) or [ shark ] ( https://www.etsy.com/no-en/listing/153872750/pattern-for-crocheted-shark-socks-baby ) or [ bunny ] ( http://www.topcrochetpatterns.com/free-crochet-patterns/adult-animal-slippers ), 
  christmas is two months away , i 'm kind of panicking . 
  seriously , secret eaters did an episode on it and everything . 
  my goal for next week is three sets of [ these ] ( http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/jurassic-inspired-dinosaur-gloves ) . 
  why do people have so many children !, 
  awww !!!, 
  it is gorgeous !, 
  honestly , the most fancy thing i know is blankets with nice stitches !, 
  it looks like bat wings !,
