  that might work . 
  i am in awe . 
  this look amazing . 
  adorable !, 
  i 'm going all in . 
  spending 15 credits . 
  never tried it before . 
  seriously though , i kind of wish there was a way to exchange the credits you do n't use to ... i do n't know , buy a month of elf status or something . 
  seriously , harry potter have some of the nicest patterns . 
  a lot of people have a reddit account for redditgift and do n't actually use the site . 
  big time . 
  i know it says no politics , but all i could think to reply with here was a video of trump saying china . 
  i will abstain . 
  but really , stockinette is really amazing . 
  but i love the simplicity of garter stitch . 
  the texture takes it to the next level for me . 
  shoot , there goes my plan to turn my entire apartment building into a lobster tank . 
  those lobsters will have to be adopted by someone else , u/imocaris, 
  that 's why i 'm telling my santa about my deep passion for precious metals and oil fields , and my love for knitting . 
  that way they can pick the price range and still gift me something i 'm interested in . 
  not impressed by the [ light ] ( https://youtu.be/0ztkkaseiik?t=13s ) , and the thing costs more then all my furnitures combined , so if it wants to [ bump into things , i 'm going to let it ] ( https://youtu.be/0ztkkaseiik?t=22s ) . 
  a little impressed by not having to bend down or step on a [ switch ] ( https://youtu.be/0ztkkaseiik?t=28s ) to vacuum my non existing carpets , [ oh my fucking god it 's a robot ] ( https://youtu.be/0ztkkaseiik?t=41s ) there is no one holding that thing !, 
  a former coworker came to work yesterday , turns out she had a baby two months ago !, 
  so , i 'm about halfway done with the [ sleep tight jacket ] ( http://www.garnstudio.com/pattern.php?id=6613&amp;cid=17 ) from drops design . 
  in size 6/9 months , using [ drops baby merino ] ( http://www.garnstudio.com/yarn.php?id=91&amp;cid=17 ) . 
  no pictures because it 's just two different size rectangles at the moment . 
  hoping to be done by tomorrow afternoon . 
  edit 1 : i 'm done with one arm and have it attached , one more arm and then raglan all the way !, 
  edit 2 : both arms are attached !, 
  but it ' 2330 , and i 'm going to bed . 
  will finish tomorrow . 
  edit 3 : i lied . 
  it 's 0030 , i 'm going to bed * now * . 
  edit 4 : i really hate the first few rounds of raglan . 
  everything is just so tight , and my needles just seem to big . 
  but it will look so pretty when it is done !, 
  oh , and it 's 0130 . 
  now i 'm going to bed . 
  edit 5 : and it 's done !, 
  well , i have to buy and fasted buttons , but other then that ; it 's done !, 
  this looks so good !, 
  now i want to make a blanket like this . 
  i 'm currently making 28 granny squares for a blanket . 
  the idea of making it all in one , and still getting a pretty pattern without switching threads is ... tempting . 
  my one problem ? 
  not a single one of the yarn stores in town sell gradient yarn that is suitable . 
  it 's all thin sock yarn , and i 'm not making another blanket with a 3 mm hook . 
  true , i 'm not ... detailed oriented enough to pull that off . 
  under two months until christmas is over and i can start making things for myself again . 
  well , given that my family slows down on all the babies . 
  i started out with mostly with the cheapest needles i could find . 
  for circular needles i 'd go a little more expensive , since the cheap ones tend to snatch on the yarn . 
  i 've ended up using mostly these [ cubic needles ] ( https://www.yarn.com/categories/knitters-pride-cubics-knitting-needles ) , but it 's a trial and error thing to find what you like !, 
  that looks great !, 
  love the colours , and the giant head it sits on . 
  no , have sent to both usa and australia from europe . 
  everyone in the city i live resides in the middle of a bay or on the top of a mountain . 
  switch to smaller glasses !, 
  for me getting smaller glasses worked the same way getting smaller plates did , 1 dl of juice at the bottom of a glass looked sad , but when the glass only takes 1,5 dl , it 's not that bad . 
  i started drinking water for thirst , and then allowed myself to have a glass of soda or juice with meals . 
  i still drink a redbull every 2-3 days , it 's the one thing i ca n't give up . 
  looking amazing !, 
  pattern ? 
  they look really great . 
  i guess i 'm going to go practice free hand . 
  what kind of climate are we talking about ? 
  i remember another clip where big brother contestants were either told about 9/11 happening ~ ~ or the iraq war . ~ ~, 
  edit : it was season 2 of big brother us , one of the contestants had family in the wtc . 
  awesome people have found videos of it . 
  sorry , was on mobile . 
  and others have provided links !, 
  i thought it was hilarious , but then again i 'm from norway so it might not count . 
  i mentioned it in the [ wip thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/knitting/comments/5c186o/weekly_work_in_progress_thread_november_09_2016/d9t0bpu/ ) , but it 's done and finally a picture !, 
  the colour change was n't planned , and was a result of me buying to little yarn , and then going back to the store just to find out they were out of the colour and did n't know when they would get more . 
  the pattern is called [ sleep tight ] ( http://www.garnstudio.com/pattern.php?id=6613&amp;cid=17 ) and i used [ baby merino from drops ] ( http://www.garnstudio.com/yarn.php?id=91&amp;cid=17 ) . 
  i was thinking about two seperate incidents . 
  the 9/11 is from the us . 
  the iraq war one is from norway , but i might be mistaken since i ca n't find any video/articles about it . 
  this was my most speedy of all knits . 
  i was lucky and had an entire day and the crown on netflix to get through the first day , and it 's just garter stitch , which is really fast when you get the hang of it . 
  the arms really slowed me down , and raglan sleeves took a few rounds to speed up . 
  that and i ran out of thread at one point . 
  it 's adorable !, 
  and it 's the kind of thing that i would take forever to finish . 
  thank you !, 
  edit : did you mean skyr ? 
  sometimes toxic people just have to go . 
  great that you 're doing better . 
  i just spent some time searching for info on this . 
  [ the best i could find . 
  ] ( http://decider.com/2016/11/11/roman-empire-reign-of-blood-netflix/ ), 
  my take ? 
  did you see the hbo series rome ? 
  i 'm thinking it 's a bit like that . 
  violence and nudity in something that can vaguely be recognised as a historical setting . 
  when i did the 5k , i was done with the run and was spending the last few minutes just cooling down and stretching . 
  and for some reason i thought the run was done , it said package delivered , so i ended the run . 
  then i went back to the run page to look at my time , and the run was n't completed . 
  i went back in , but while it continued for the last few minutes of the run it did n't add to the old time . 
  so now i have a completed run that is less then 1 km long .
