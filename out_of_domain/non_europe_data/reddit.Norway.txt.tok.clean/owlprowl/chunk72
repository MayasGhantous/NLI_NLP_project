  or bring back thw not interesting option tha made things go away . 
  as someone who nukes their profile every 6 months or so , this baffles me . 
  he 's not . 
  but he 's a conservative and that 's ... bad ? 
  yup, 
  i messed about a bit with their site , and they do , but not for cheap . 
  really ? 
  that yellow dress looks horrible . 
  downvotes happens , i do n't really care . 
  feminism generally cloak themselves in this quasi intellectual veneer . 
  taking terms like patriarchy , and twisting it to their own meaning . 
  i do n't really care for either side in this conflict , i think there are good and bad things in both the movements , and neither side do enough to crack down on the crazy in their own rank and at the same time demand that the other side is only the worst side . 
  i 'm not a fan of the `` supersize me '' documentary , but it did make a point of how in some areas mcdonalds having the only safe , well kept , outside play areas , and how many ads for junk food kids see in a day . 
  i did n't think i was eating that much . 
  then i downloaded mfp , and after just a few days of registering everything i ate ( not even weighing it , so i know i was under reporting ) , and it turns out that i was eating that much . 
  also , it turns out that i was terrified of hunger , so i ate before i thought i would get hungry . 
  turns out ? 
  i 'm really bad at judging hunger . 
  it 's gorgeous !, 
  and now i might have to watch game of thrones to look for embroidery . 
  if you ca n't fix it yourself , this is something you can get a seamstress to do for not that much money . 
  my phone have room for 1/2 audiobook . 
  a memory card is a must . 
  bbc radio have a number of great programs , but mostly for people who like classic crime and classics in general . 
  going through my library , these are the ones i 've loved the most . 
  which says more about my taste then objective quality .

  i have to get hbo now . 
  my brother in law have been telling me i have to watch it for years . 
  he forgot to mention that there was embroidery . 
  overnight oats . 
  oats , some chia seeds etc. 
  in a jar with some water/almond milk/etc . 
  either make it the night before or in the morning . 
  then bring a bag with chopped nuts , seeds , dried or fresh fruit , egg , ham , spices whatever you want . 
  it 's versatile , nutritious and can be cheap or expensive . 
  that said for weight loss , buy a food scale and download my fitness pal to track what you eat . 
  you are not a monster . 
  or worthless . 
  my biggest regret is not having taken a before picture . 
  because months from now you will be in a slump and think you have n't gotten anywhere , and you can look at that picture next to a picture of yourself now and realize how far you 've come . 
  even `` bad '' things can be a learning experience as long as you learn the right things from them . 
  for me it 's . 
  beans/lentils/rice / rolled oats in bulk . 
  but do n't go overboard . 
  buy things you actually use and mind the expiration dates . 
  #and remember to get airtight containers for everything to prevent pests . 
  is it about the movie , or the dish ? 
  50/50 chance for either . 
  if she 's on a diet she ca n't keep , then she 's on the wrong diet . 
  introduce her to my fitness pall and calorie counting . 
  what do you mean you do n't celebrate international donut day ? 
  internasjonal do n't pay attention to international awareness days day was a raging sucsess, 
  oh , i 'm not accusing mcdonalds of anything other then seeing an ~ ~ undeserved ~ ~ under-served population and giving them what they want/need ,, 
  wait , there 's stats ? 
  and badges ? 
  edit : i 'm 113 hours away from being a master . 
  and i have a bunch of badges , and some badges i 'll never get , and some i have no idea how to get . 
  this has happened to me . 
  log out , then in again . 
  this should remove it . 
  if it does n't , contact customer service . 
  thank you !, 
  have both of them . 
  it 's my go to random listen !, 
  this is what you get from listening to the squiggly red line . 
  thank you . 
  i 'm going to go old school and say [ the postman ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/889284.the_postman ) . 
  it 's slightly sci-fi , but not really . 
  it 's slightly outdated , but not terribly so . 
  and it 's all good . 
  edit : and yes , it was adapted into a not so great movie . 
  trust me , the book is so much better . 
  there 's some outdated tech , but it 's limited to a section of the book . 
  the characters are great , and the story has a great flow to it , i could barely put it down . 
  personally i think the movie was a few really nice moments wrapped in terrible . 
  nah , in russia/eastern europe the women usually transitioned to male after their career , because of all the testesterone etc they were pumped full of, 
  hate them , always have , always will . 
  au where you could find out magical talent with a spell , that made a * list * of your abilities . 
  harry of course was 100 animagus , and a bunch of other special talents . 
  100 what ? 
  did n't say , and i stopped reading the story a paragraph later since this was just the cherry on top of the stupid sundae . 
  the only thing i could think about was the midichlorians count bs from the star wars prequels . 
  the burning of the family album/broom/hedwig trope is almost as annoying as the ` everyone thinks harry randomly murdered cho with an unforgivable trope . 
  ~ ~ link ? ~ ~, 
  never mind i jfgi . 
  the only draco in gryffindor story i know is ' a slytherin in gryffindor clothing ' , and it does n't entirely fit your premise . 
  draco is transported to an au where lucius defeated voldemorte , draco is in gryffindor , and harry is a slytherin . 
  honestly , the biggest difference i could see is that luna bars have fewer calories . 
  thank you !, 
  i had a azkaban phase . 
  someone killing cho and blaming harry was a staple in the genre . 
  i 'm not judging here . 
  i use a water belt in the summer , and wear it around my waist because anywhere else it just keeps slipping and bouncing . 
  a great narrator is always a plus , it 's on my list !,
