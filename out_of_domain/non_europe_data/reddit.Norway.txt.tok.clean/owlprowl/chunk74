  wait , your regular doctor ? 
  have you been to a sleep specialist ? 
  from the little i remember about this from primary school ( and keep in mind i was n't in the changing room with them ) , the one circumcised boy in the class got some questions and some teasing . 
  even my crazy anti-vaxxer friend let her kids have the vitamin k orally over two doses , because it only causes autism if it comes in a syringe . 
  thing is , the vitamin k can be given as drops for those who do n't like needles . 
  an anti-vaxxer friend of mine refused the shot and instead opted for drops over 3 days instead , it was offered by the hospital for those who did n't want the shot . 
  if these parents had actually done research , they would have known this . 
  if 1-2 a week decline they should offer alternatives to the shot instead . 
  depending on the site , just block them . 
  seriously , it does n't sound like this person is playing with a full deck . 
  you do n't really own them anything . 
  so block and move on . 
  other then pointing out bad formatting , or suggesting someone get a beta reader if there 's language issues , i keep away from suggesting things . 
  it 's not my story . 
  netlflix recently added a bunch of remakes of old movies , these were the best of the ones i watched . 
  ** the blue lagoon ( 2012 ) ** - the classic cousins stranded on an island since childhood and growing up to be awkward sex having adolescents . 
  now with less incest & 80 's camp . 
  ** bonnie & clyde ( 2013 ) ** - never heard of the remake of this classic crime love drama ? 
  it 's ... not terrible . 
  but it 's not worth watching either . 
  looking great !, 
  [ next step ... ] ( http://intheloopknitting.com/10-game-of-thrones-free-knitting-patterns/ ), 
  it looks amazing !, 
  no , how about telling them about why it 's important , and then telling them about the oral drops . 
  that is the disclaimer i should have added . 
  if you donate anything , just send a mail or make a phone call to see what they take . 
  and the kicker is that the people yelling loudest about lack of diversity never plannes on picking up a comic to begin with . 
  i watched a documentary about the newtown shooting and made the mistake of looking at the comments . 
  i 'm not that dogmatic . 
  she has enough anti-vaxxers in her life that i want to be there as a counterpoint to all the quacking . 
  sunlight ? 
  eating contests ? 
  letting goats attack them ? 
  gathering an army of atheists ? 
  that 's what the academic norwegia . 
  folktales say will kill them . 
  eh ... i 've done that , most people do n't really care . 
  amen , fellow shitposter . 
  and praise be !, 
  even that is only partly true since the study i saw had problems with methodology , long term sick people tend to lose weight and the study did n't take account for it . 
  seriously , is n't he still alive ? 
  would n't it be more like do n't you go an robert jordan on me ? 
  not really a rant , but kind of awesome ;, 
  i started a new job a week ago , and ... not a single one of my coworkers is obese , barely anyone is even slightly overweight . 
  it 's kind of amazing , then again it 's much more fast paced ( even if it 's not as much heavy lifting ) . 
  of the two robert jordan at least had a good ending to his epic saga . 
  sure , i might have hate read 4-5 of the books , but i read them and the ending was amazing ( something happened ! ) . 
  dune ? 
  wait , who was nominated last year ? 
  yes , apples and oranges comes from trees , but both cane sugar and hfcs come from natural sources . 
  and unless you press it yourself , or go to the stores with the pressing machines , then the juice have been processed to hell and back . 
  i fucked up today because i assumed the person adding something to mfp would n't be a total fucking idiot . 
  then on top of it i did n't reset my food scale , and ended up with 30 gram more of cheese then i was intending . 
  it was 3-500 calories more then i thought it would be , but it still fit into a tortilla . 
  it was n't just the cheese , that was just the ... cheese on top of the vegan `` ground beef '' ... sundae ? 
  i think i got lost there . 
  anyway , according to mfp the vegan ground beef was 70 calories per 100 grams . 
  but it turns out it was 150 . 
  never heard of them . 
  edit :, 
  but in general , any large batch juice is [ processed ] ( http://americannutritionassociation.org/newsletter/fresh-squeezed ) . 
  or how crazy her opposition is ... 
  which is why i only drink bear bile . 
  actually , he was from russia . 
  it 's confirmed to have contained explosives . 
  according to the police he was known to them as someone they were keeping an eye on . 
  i 'm going to believe them before the littlest , most incompetent , terrorist . 
  and the last time it happened in bergen , when it was n't ww2 related , i think it was a mixmaster . 
  although they did find a 500 kg british ww2 bomb a few months back . 
  pretty sure they are talking about hormonal birth control here . 
  and sure , they are right , there 's just not a whole lot to do about it . 
  if you drink a lot of soda , get a soda stream and make your own . 
  you can get them pretty cheap second hand , and even new . 
  i bought my soda stream second hand and buy of brand co2 containers, 
  electric bike . 
  i 'm working on the math , and have found one that costs $ 1200 . 
  if i get it i can skip the monthly bus card for 5-6 months of the year , so $ 80x5 = $ 400 saved for sure . 
  in norway . 
  i 've done this . 
  in my defense it was very filthy . 
  and just like jesus , it was dead for three days then made a surprise resurrection . 
  looking good !, 
  after nuking my old profile and messing around with the new one , i 'm pretty sure i do n't like the new system either . 
  well , correction , i think it 's just as useless as the old system . 
  * things you do n't like still shows up on the home page , just kind of blacked out . 
  well they black out after you 've taken the pointer over them . 
  so that 's pointless . 
  * the categories are still terrible ,, 
  i would n't have cared if the new system was better , but it 's just as useless as the old one . 
  but now with additional blacked out titles still on the screen if you disliked something , instead of the title not showing up . 
  you get the same effect by making a new profile every few months . 
  rating makes them recommend things similar to the programs you like . 
  and by similar , i mean the slimmest connection ever . 
  you seem to like the underworld series , how about trying out this holocaust documentary !, 
  if they actually removed the movies you thumb down , i 'd think it was great . 
  but they do n't , so it 's just as pointless as the stars . 
  i thought it was waist to hip ratio ? 
  my problem is that i have to have it in the tiny apartment i live in , so it has to be light , and it has to be foldable . 
  yes , and no . 
  i do n't hold them to the same standard , but i do hold fanfiction authors to some standard .
