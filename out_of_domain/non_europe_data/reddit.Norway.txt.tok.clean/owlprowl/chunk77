  but no , my mother called today to tell me i have to go in a family birthday party . 
  so instead of the healthy snacks i was going to bring , i 'll have to try to stop myself from eating all the delicious cakes my aunt is sure to have made . 
  cat 's are n't built to convert large stores of fat , so when they are starving the fat is released to a liver that ca n't process it efficiently . 
  so you can give it less food , but be mindful that it is n't an extreme deficit . 
  there 's a lot going on , and you can participate in everything !, 
  the day starts at 7am with a procession starting from dreggen, 
  but the main procession starts around 10 from festplassen . 
  that said , all stores will be closed , pretty much the entire country is closed . 
  found the program , and in english and everything !, 
  growth of the soil, 
  it 's kind of a settler book , but without indians . 
  about a man who stakes a claim to a piece of land , then builds a farm , finds himself a wife and ... well , telling you more would be spoiling it . 
  really good book . 
  pretty much all his books are like that . 
  it 's a love or hate kind of author .

  really ? 
  i mean , i do n't talk about any other bodily functions in public either . 
  where is the movement against pooping shaming ? 
  as for hiding your tampons , that 's entirely on you . 
  i do n't hide it any more then i hide any other clean sanitary products . 
  meaning not at all . 
  as for the jokes , tell them yes , then dwscribe your periods in detail . 
  that usually stops them . 
  or anytime they act emotional ask if they are gay/have blue balls . 
  i have 2-3 days of light bleeding that my diva cup have no problem dealing with . 
  but i go up a pants size . 
  my sistets keeper , by ajodi piccoult . 
  i love thw book , but have torn out the last few pages . 
  almost ? 
  i did n't get that far . 
  i noped out with the earthquakes . 
  and have neville finish the figh like the true gryffindor that he is ? 
  i 've thrown out pretty much all my ya books . 
  except the hush comma hush series . 
  i read it for school and had to write a paper on it . 
  did i mention that my teacher loved the book ? 
  the tour you linked to is legit . 
  if you want to strike out on your own i have a few suggestions . 
  it depends how far you 're willing to travel . 
  if you want fresh water or sea . 
  for sea you can fish pretty much anywhere , freshwater is a little more complicated . 
  i 'm pretty sure you can fish at grimevannet & haukelandsvannet , there 's a mix of pike , trout , and perch . 
  there 's possibility to fish in a few of the lakes in the mountains around the city , but it might seem a little arbitrary which ones are legal and wich ones are not . 
  if you walk along the shoreline there 's always a place to fish close the city , but it 's quite poluted so i 'd go a little further out . 
  there 's a lot of great spots a 1-3 hours drive outside the city . 
  sotra , \u00d8ygarden , ask\u00f8y all have great spots , but you need to take the bus or go by car .

  this is a great place . 
  30 minutes busride from the city .

  honestly , it 's been a while since i listened to her songs and this made me question if she was ever any good to begin with . 
  came here for this . 
  the ending to season 1 was so bitter and perfect . 
  and season two is n't terrible all the way through but all the problems you ignored with seadon 1 was pushed to thw foreground . 
  huh ... was planning on ignoring it , but i 'll put it on my list . 
  but that demands that the alternate poi t of view actually gets to say something and is n't interupted by silly voices and mockery, 
  firefly was n't all that good the first time around either . 
  did you read the study on the whos page ? 
  it 's utter garbage . 
  the methodology was weak af and the conclusion was just silly, 
  seriously other then the most extreme , and fringe , christian party , they are the biggest israel friends in norwegian politics . 
  this is more unintended consequences . 
  it really is . 
  and it pisses me of a little that i only have season 1 and 2 on dvd . 
  but , it 's on netflix , so planning on rewatching it soon . 
  that might be a death sentence . 
  seriously , fuck those shithead punks . 
  they want to be big bad gangsters ? 
  in norway it is . 
  he does n't have the right to ask for forgivnes before he does some jail time . 
  nope , he has the right to sit down , shut up , and never approach his victim . 
  if she wants to talk to him , she 'll tell him . 
  if you ignore the crazy princess who runs a school that teaches you how to talk to angels . 
  sure , but we have a penguin army . 
  and a princess who can talk to angels . 
  serious question : how often do you use gendered language when tslking to someone ? 
  because for me the answer is never . 
  depending on the weather , i 'll go see one or two movies this summer . 
  but to be honest , i have hbo and still have n't gotten around to watching got so my summer is pkanned out already .

  fudge does n't try to ignore voldemort 's return at the end of the 4th year . 
  instead , influenced by malfoy , he tries to appease the dark lord . 
  many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war . 
  hermione granger and the other muggleborns disagree . 
  this is long , and i 'm slowly working my way through it . 
  i 'm not usually a hermione fan , but this made me like her . 
  that said , i 'm not a fan of the romance subplot . 
  this is the kind of shit my grandmother had to deal with . 
  she came from an upper middle class family , and met and fell in love with a working class boy . 
  everyone around her was shocked , het father was furrious , bur she had no fucks to give . 
  it 's the same in the city i live . 
  10 or so years ago they made a new tram line , so a road where you could previously turn right was now right ahead only . 
  there 's signs telling you to go right ahead , but for the first 5 or so years there was a number of accidents where people turned right and drove right into the side of the tram . 
  love the idea for the crust . 
  will add my own filling . 
  i read an article about why there are so few types of iuds in the us compared to the rest of the west .
