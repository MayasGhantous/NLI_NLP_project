  why was it removed ? 
  whyyyy, 
  i actually reccomend corsair over razer when it comes to mechanical keyboard . 
  my experience with peripherals is `` less mainstream is better '' . 
  atleast where i live , shops rarely sell it . 
  they only sell from brands that `` have gamer appeal '' and `` are mainstream '' . 
  notice the reddit post half a year ago about norwegian youth not wanting school uniform due to not being able to make yourself stand out in a crowd , while everyone pictured wore the same jacket . 
  `` mainstream '' controls what people buy here . 
  i do n't know how it is where you live , but in norway , it has a lot to say, 
  some of those designs were actually pretty cool !, 
  having an interrest in aircraft myself , i would love to see more . 
  ah , well then things are different in the us then here . 
  i like the idea !, 
  we are hopefully getting a 3d printer soon . 
  what did you use to design it ? 
  stick with the gaming laptop . 
  i know a lot of girls that think norwegian guys are not good at making a move , that 's for sure, 
  if i understand the theme properly , it is `` old myths '' or something like that ? 
  he doesnt know what he is talking about, 
  i could be bullied behind my 4th grade teacher 's back , and she wouldnt care if i told her ... 
  still , at every parent meeting , she would be all about `` stopping the bullies '' . 
  what a bs teacher, 
  what do you think about the defcon talks on physical security ? 
  i find them really entertaining to watch while eating or doing dull work . 
  vpn . 
  problem solved . 
  damn , i hate when my software goes exsistential on me !, 
  oh , how cute, 
  it 's not gon na happen . 
  i can tell you that at once , because they only thing they have to show in their `` updates '' are gui concepts . 
  no tech demos . 
  that should seriously be enough to ban you from selling on steam . 
  java programmer here . 
  fuck pointers . 
  i do want to learn them , though . 
  c++ sounds fun, 
  yeah !, 
  this is years ago , so i changed school since then . 
  great teachers , great students . 
  i think i am really lucky with my school, 
  a few weeks ago , but over skype though . 
  i talk a lot to friends over the internet . 
  just go for it . 
  invite her out to do something fun . 
  everyone here has said mostly inacurate definitions , so i would like to pont to [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hacker_ ( programmer_subculture ) ) ( sorry , markdown doesnt like wikipedia sites with ) in its name ), 
  wikipedia says that * a hacker is one who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming and circumventing limitations of programming systems and who tries to extend their capabilities [ 3 ] the act of engaging in activities ( such as programming or other media [ 4 ] ) in a spirit of playfulness and exploration is termed hacking *, 
  i think this is pretty decent , but in the end , a hacker is someone who modifies/uses something in a way it is n't meant to . 
  for example , a hacker may use a program in a way it isnt meant to , in order to gather access to systems through exploits . 
  if you want to do more research , the defcon documentary ( [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvwaie6cihw ) might be of interrest, 
  `` using something in a way it wasnt originally designed to do '' incorporates that . 
  how would it not ? 
  since when did i say hacking was programming ? 
  to cite myself : * i think this is pretty decent , but in the end , a hacker is someone who modifies/uses something in a way it is n't meant to *, 
  learn to read the whole comment before responding, 
   do n't get your panties in a knot , i could n't give a fuck what definition you ascribe to hacking . 
  i am just saying i think it is poorly worded and too, 
  too bad your argument as to why it was too narrow was invalid , i allready told you that . 
  op pls deliver, 
  i am a software developer . 
  1 year . 
  this was pretty cool . 
  keep up good work . 
  if i had the money , this would be a fun thing to try myself, 
  this is legit . 
  i played through it once because people were reccomending it , and i remember this scene . 
  that 's billboards . 
  this is how trees are rendered in the distance . 
  they do this in order to save polygons that can be used making stuff to you look nicer . 
  after all , do you notice that the trees in the distance are just 2d images ? 
  something is making bf not render the 3d models . 
  * high fives back *, 
  buidl self . 
  it 's a great experience, 
  i dont know about your country , but where i live it doesnt matter if it is real or not . 
  in norway , the rules are pretty clear . 
  people i know who do loli do n't seem to think so , so it seems to be enforced little . 
  sweden !, 
  `` my asshole is squeaky clean '', 
  i 'm not really a serious instagrammer . 
  the account 's existence is kinda a joke , where i post filtered images with `` deep '' text . 
  still , i update it now and then , so go ahead and follow if you want filtered pictures of food and `` deep metaphors '', 
  can i ask why there is a tumbnail to some porn in the folder new bit ? 
  ( https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3p4v1mu8w2qfer3/aaadwdezbzs4xko4pbanlnuqa/new%20bit ), 
  the file doesnt seem to exist , but the thumbnail is there . 
  download each folder seperately, 
  noticed , but i wonder what it is doing in a compilation of chiptune :p, 
  no problems . 
  could you delete it so i can download the folder ? 
  looks good from here . 
  will download tomorrow , expect ping if i discover otherwise , 
  no question . 
  i am dissapointed . 
  if you as a parent actually use this ; fuck you . 
  dont . 
  shit is so bugged , and no vehicles . 
  new bugs every update . 
  yep, 
  thats what i did , but with cheddar !, 
  i liked the new one better , but it feels like it has a lot more fat . 
  might not eat that much,
