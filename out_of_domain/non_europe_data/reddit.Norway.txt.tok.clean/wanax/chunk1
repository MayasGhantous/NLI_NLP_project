  not having read more of the site , and judging only from this article , it strikes me that what the author is advocating , is not really libertarianism , but good old fashioned burkean ( as in not the us republican modern day version of ) conservatism . 
  now personally i 'd say this is a political stance far superior to libertarianism , as it 's actually rooted in real world empirical pragmatism , but your milage may vary . 
  and it may have have strong strains of libertarian ( small l ) influences . 
  but in the end language is what people use it for . 
  and libertarianism has become something else than what they are advocating , and is unlikely to bend to redefinition . 
  best let the term go .

  for those of you who may not know the history of the project , here 's [ a link to an article ] ( http://www.bitsofnews.com/content/view/5945/ ) i did some time ago which should cover the basics . 
   germany will be getting ample supplies from wind and hydro power plants in scandinavia to balance their needs . 
  i 've seen this argument used frequently in the german debate following the nuclear phase out plan . 
  and as a norwegian it 's starting to bug me a bit . 
  the norwegian tax payers , through the government , made massive investments in hydro power back in the early 20th century ( as there were no large private pools of capital in the country at the time ) . 
  the social contract was that the tax payers would have access to cheap electric power , and indeed a lot of housing an infrastructure was built with that underlying assumption . 
  then , following the market mania of the 80 's , the power companies were privatised - the argument being that the invisible hand , a larger nordic market , and competition would make for even cheaper power . 
  fast forward to today ; and due to heavy rains and a miserable summer the dams are full to bursting . 
  so we would expect super cheap power this winter , right ? 
  wrong . 
  because germany wants to feel good about itself and green , and close the backbone of their power generation without having lined up sufficient replacement capacity , we have to supply them , and pay higher and higher prices , and turn down the heat this winter ... 
  thanks for that ...

  it 's even got the damn weirwoods ... 
  i 'm hardly an expert , or even a semi-pro , blender . 
  but i have been experimenting quite a bit lately with making my own puff from raw tobacco . 
  due to a legal loophole involving the definition of the word `` smokable '' , you can order raw tobacco leaves ( most often ready cured though ) in sweden tax free . 
  and luckily i live just across the border in norway . 
  now tobacco here usually costs the proverbial arm and a leg , and half a kidney too . 
  so i thought i 'd try to `` home brew '' to cut down on cost . 
  but i was also curious to see if i 'd be able to produce something halfway decent . 
  so i first ordered a batch of golden virginia and some burley , which came packed and dried . 
  i gently rehydrated some virginia with steaming to begin with , gave it a very light casing of brown moscovado sugar and salt , packed it in roughly a brick shape wrapped in cling wrap , and set it to be pressed under a stack of firewood . 
  a week or so later i unpacked it . 
  and was surprised that what came out was quite a nice virginia flake . 
  seems like you do n't absolutely need an industrial 50 tonn press to get a good smoke . 
  since then i 've tried steaming , stoving , casings both discrete and heavy , using sugars , honey , cocoa , vanilla , brandy , rum , mango , etc. 
  i 'm even planning on smoke curing some faux latakia in a while . 
  and what i 've learned is that 1 ) as tobacco ages a bit even quite heavy casings grow more subtle in time . 
  2 ) it 's actually hard to fuck up so badly that you end up with something totally unsmokable . 
  if you do a batch and discover early on that that particular casing yielded a sticky goop tasting of burnt candy , it can more often than not be saved by a simple rinse and drying . 
  i 'm smoking my own wares as i 'm writing this in fact . 
  so yes it is quite possible , and it does n't take a lot of equipment or know how . 
  no , the loophole is in swedish law . 
  trust me , any such hole would be bricked up , covered in concrete and buried under a thousand tonnes of radioactive rubble in norway with all the speed of an enraged puritan . 
  i 'm just lucky enough that i live close to the border , and can order it to my father 's flat in charlottenberg . 
  you can order `` r\u00e5tobak '' online from a lot of places , such as : [ snusbolaget ] ( http://www.snusbolaget.se/ratobak.html ), 
  my first , and simplest , which i mentioned , was the virginia flake . 
  i just brought a cup 's worth of water or so to a boil . 
  i stirred in maybe a tablespoon of brown sugar , a teaspoon of non iodine salt ( to inhibit mold etc. ) . 
  then i let it cool down a bit , poured it into a small spray bottle ( just an old window wash bottle i 'd emptied of the soap and cleaned out ) and misted the leaves a couple of times . 
  at that point you could just call it a day and dry an cut it . 
  i slightly heated them in the microwave to make them a tad softer , filled them into a mould , packed them tightly in plastic wrap and put them to press . 
  later , heavier casings are basically the same , only using brandy and/or rum and stirring in different flavours . 
  yes they usually state that they 'll only send within sweden . 
  time to find a swedish friend . 
  he he . 
  i 'm sure there are many posters on this subreddit far more knowledgeable on this than me - you know people who * actually * know what they 're doing , unlike my `` method '' of trial and error and `` fuck it !, 
  that mango is now upgraded from snack to casing !, 
  i 'm sure i had a bottle somewhere here with a few drops of rum left in it ... '', 
  i thought i 'd give you a more detailed recipe of my home made mac baren mixture like casing . 
  this is sort of the mother of all casings , and liable to make a purist english blend smoker cry ... 
  base liquid : alcohol , vodka , whisky , brandy , moonshine , whathaveyou ... 
  add and dissolve the following :, 
  - vanilla ( i simply use vanilla extract . 
  you can find it in most shops in the baking goods shelf . ), 
  - rum ( likewise , extract found same place ), 
  - licorice , if you can find a usable form . 
  a bit of hard licorice candy ( not anything soft that would contain fat or gelatin , which would really pollute the smoke . 
  - honey, 
  - brown sugar, 
  - salt, 
  mix to taste .
