  spray on tobacco in quantity you like . 
  optionally give the tobacco some heat afterwards . 
  press to cake for flake . 
  or simply cut to shag or ribbon of your liking . 
  for my next experiment i thought i 'd get my hands on some liquid probiotic containing the enzymes amylase and cellulase to see if i could `` speed age '' some cakes to a penzance like texture . 
  yes , i used some pure apple juice with no additives and no added sugar ( a lot of cheap juice in the store is basically just citric acid , assorted other chemicals and sweetener ) . 
  i poured it in a pot , put it on medium heat and reduced it to perhaps 35 % of the original liquid content . 
  as regards the flavour of a finished flake - camp fire and baked apple with a hint of leather perhaps . 
  i know some diy tobacco folks have had good results with [ candex ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/candex ) . 
  sadly i 've not found any in norway . 
  if you 're the sort of person who likes tinkering and `` projects '' , it 's fun , and , due to the lack of taxes , it wo n't hurt too bad , even if you end up with a failed experiment or two . 
  and some times you 're lucky and figure out the exact recipe that suits you . 
  i have my own apples from the garden . 
  and i make apple wine as well . 
  but i 've found any sort of wine to be an indifferent casing for tobacco . 
  6 kilograms apples , run through the blender , ditto two oranges , three lemons and two limes . 
  into the 30 litre fermenting bucket or carboy it goes . 
  add 800 gram to a kilo of malt extract . 
  hard boil quite bit of old used tea ( i freeze it in a bag after making tea in the press can ) and pour in to add some tannins . 
  add 7 kilos sugar . 
  add wine yeast of a strong wine variety . 
  leave for three weeks . 
  add a bit of pectolase enzyme . 
  strain through a mesh strainer and leave to clear . 
  like the leopard says , there are quite a number of options for making various aromatic and english style blends . 
  i posted a gallery illustrating some of my experiments a while back , [ which you can find here ] ( http://imgur.com/a/4uei9 ) . 
  after having tried some of this batch and a few others ( still needs a bit of ageing ) , i 'm really happy with my smoke cured faux latakia . 
  i use that in just about all my blends now . 
  the black cavendish turned out a tad ... empty . 
  think this needs the right casing to be interesting ; merits further experiments , but so far . . meh . 
  my standard so far : cake built up of two wafers of golden virginia cased with some high grade honey sandwiching a thick layer of latakia , a layer of burley slightly cased with brown sugar , and a thin layer of cigar leaf from cheap cigars slightly steamed and opened . 
  slightly larger version :, 
  the lovely chocolategamergirl . 
  sadly she had to stop posting , and took down her pics for personal reasons . 
  seems like real world acquaintances had seen some pics . 
  best of luck . 
  i 've been toying with the idea of growing some myself - perhaps a strain of n. rustica , what they used to call `` bondetobakk '' , peasant tobacco , here in the olden days , to give some blends that vitamin n mule kick . 
  i 'm sure we 'd all love some updates on your trials and ( hopefully no ) errors . 
  as a gardener and pipe smoker , i salute you . 
  those are virginias ? 
  it strikes me that the comments here confirm what often gets obscured , but should be obvious ; traps , transgenders , whatever name you want to give the rose , in general are attracted ( quelle surprise ! ), 
  to the things the gender they identify as usually are ... 
  like [ diamonddancer says ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/traps/comments/1lmonf/traps_describe_your_type_of_guy/cc0rmtc ) ; `` definitely taller than me . 
  scruffy but not gross . 
  strong enough to pick me up if need be . 
  semi hairy ( like a man 's man ) . 
  big hands . 
  strong eyebrows . '', 
  that 's probably what a majority of natural born women might answer . 
  again , quelle surprise ... 
  i 'd say it might be progressive nostalgia . 
  it 's exploring the idea that there might ( have ) be ( en ) alternative visions of modernity , which did not suffer/create the near total cultural break with the core thread of western civilisation , running back to the renaissance , around the time of the first world war , and which retained certain values , most obviously in aesthetics , while still not being simply reactionary . 
  the girl in the pic she 's using is the [ norwegian blogger emilie `` voe '' nereng ] ( http://www.voeblogg.no/ ) by the by . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , she 's from the czech republic . 
  carpe is the traditional holiday dinner for christmas there . 
  so in usian terms , she 's posing with the turkey . 
  still odd , but slightly less so . 
  just as strelkov , or lenin and stalin , are pseudonyms , `` motorola '' is the nom de guerre of arsen pavlov , one of the rebel leaders . 
  and he 's [ a tiny little somewhat goofy looking guy ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/love-on-the-barricades-ukraine-crisis-makes-couples-and-breaks-them-apart/25454776.html ) . 
  but then again , he would n't be the first military leader in history of the small dog , big bark ( and some times even big bite ) variety . 
  i 've been growing some this year , mainly rustica ( swedish bondetobakk ) , but also some tennessee redleaf . 
  close up of some rustica plants : [ imgur ] ( http://i.imgur.com/scnyjew ), 
  the redleaf is now taller than i am , and i 've already harvested the lower leaves on the plants . 
  in fact i 've sun dried them , quick cured them with enzymes , and smoked some in my pipe . 
  will grow more and more varieties next year . 
  if i can do it in norway , you can pretty much do it anywhere . 
  for \u00e5 vri p\u00e5 et amerikansk munnhell fra vietnamkrigen : `` inside every muslim there 's a swede trying to get out ! '', 
  hmm . 
   are we in a new cold war ? 
  not really , as today 's conflict lacks the ideological element which might elevate simple great power politics to a true global struggle with fixed long term alliances . 
   did the last one ever end ? 
  yes and no . 
  the cold war as a struggle between a liberal capitalist west and a communist east is over . 
  but that rivalry was in itself in part a continuation of the older great game for dominance of the eurasian landmass , which zbigniew brzezinski and others would say is still very much in play . 
  i used to think lebanon96 was a bona fide , though at times overexcited , rebel sympathiser , perhaps even one with real contacts . 
  but now i 'm leaning towards him simply being an attention-lady-of-ill-repute . 
  men sverige ... eh . 
  her har man det beste eksempelet p\u00e5 det [ peter hitchens skrev ] ( http://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/2013/04/how-i-am-partly-to-blame-for-mass-immigration.html ) om sin tid som revolusjon\u00e6r marxist :, 
   `` it was n't because we liked immigrants , but because we did n't like britain . 
  we saw immigrants - from anywhere - as allies against the staid , settled , conservative society that our country still was at the end of the sixties . 
   also , we liked to feel oh , so superior to the bewildered people - usually in the poorest parts of britain - who found their neighbourhoods suddenly transformed into supposedly ` vibrant communities ' .

  poor peto has a hard time keeping up with the developing facts on the ground . 
  if things keep going like this they will have taken a large area , while still arguably ending up with more defensible borders .

  hun argumenterer seg enig med margaret thatcher ; `` there 's no such thing as society ! '', 
  it 's max boot , a core neoconservative . 
  so it 's finely calibrated to portray putin as a james bond villain , who is an urgent threat obama is unwilling to confront . 
  it all goes back to the [ team b ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/team_b ) days when the same people claimed the nigh on dead soviet union had invisible super weapons ... 
  i must admit to still grieving the demise of the googletalk client . 
  it was simple , fool proof , very light weight , but still had just about any feature you 'd need . 
  in my opinion nothing has come along since to top it . 
  granted . 
  but that just amounts to another reason why a tox based app incorporating its lean and clean designs would reign mightily . 
  politically it would make all kinds of sense . 
  but even neutrality on the question would be anathema to the parliamentary labour party . 
  it 's probably the one thing that would unite them in an immediate leadership revolt . 
  us norwegians are out of the eu ( too ) , and have had stable 70 % + no to the eu polls for a decade or more . 
  yes indeed .
