  this is quite a vindication for your much mocked optimism in the days leading up to this . 
  congrats from norway , and welcome to the europe that 's not eu . 
  a bit less irrelevant this morning perhaps . 
  anyway , myself , and most norwegians , do n't quite see how turning our democracy over to the most half baked empire since the holy roman one would make us more relevant . . 
  it 's fascinating to come across people who quite simply do n't share , not your opinions , but the very reality you share with most other people on the planet , even the ones you vehemently disagree with on most other things . 
  it strains the brain just to try imagine the view through their eyes . 
  `` disposed of ... '', 
  i must admit , as one of many here who 's been in general most sympathetic to the kurds in this conflict , that they are not coming out of this with much honour or goodwill . 
  there have been signs lately that hubris has started to go to the head of some elements of their leadership . 
  and they are , in my opinion , dangerously close to blowing their one precarious chance for de facto independence which would not be stomped by turkey , a formal `` scottish '' solution under a syrian umbrella . 
  they have been rather diplomatically nimble so far . 
  it would be a shame if they ended up like the arabs in abba eban 's quote , who `` never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity . '', 
  it 's a bit unsettling to see how this massive propaganda wave has been rolled out in the last couple of weeks . 
  and syria is actually only a part of it . 
  you do n't have to like donald trump to gasp at the `` yuge '' media monstering directed at him . 
  in the uk the pr pressure is now really on to scare up a redo on the eu brexit . 
  and the drums of war , banged by even `` progressive '' outlets like the guardian , are marshalling a march under banners of blonde blue eyed syrian girls in aleppo crying for daddy . 
  across the board the establishment empire is striking back . 
   i 'm splitting hairs here ... 
  indeed . 
  this does seem to be a case of ... ahem ... overthinking it . 
  a pan-western-russian conspiracy to set the shia against the sunni , the saudis against the persians - you do n't need a conspiracy to drum up that result . 
  you need a starting gun . 
  it 's in the government 's interest that such deals can be trusted . 
  if not , then every siege becomes a street to street fight to the death . 
  such combat is usually a meat grinder , even for the most advanced and well trained forces . 
  it would be wrong to claim that israel is the * only * reason for us enmity towards iran . 
  this also goes back to the cia 's involvement in [ toppling mohammad mosaddegh ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_iranian_coup_d'%c3%a9tat ) and propping up the shah , and the subsequent islamic revolution and the hostage crisis at the us embassy in tehran . 
  but yes , israel is an important factor ; directly , as regards iran , and even indirectly when it comes to russia . 
  one reason is the strong support for israel , for biblical reasons , among the vast evangelical movement . 
  another is that the jewish diaspora in the us is 1 ) generally very wealthy , and 2 ) have a dominant position in media , which equals having 3 ) political power . 
  the until recently extremely influential neoconservative movement was to a large degree founded by jewish intellectuals . 
  many of those jews had roots in the pale of eastern europe and the russian empire , and they were often not treated well , and not much better during the soviet period . 
  the word `` pogrom '' comes to mind . 
  the neocons , and us jews in general , were strongly anti-soviet , and often even carried over into being * sceptical * to russia itself . 
  israel 's fraught relationship with post-revolutionary iran , aside from the us problems with that nation , is rather clear to see and explain . 
  1 ) i 'm of jewish descent . 
  not that that should matter . 
  but ... 
  2 ) are you insane ? 
  what part of what i wrote could in any way be construed as even slightly antisemitic ? 
  thank you . 
  the guy really got my goat , as he did n't just imply my comment had a kinda-sorta antisemitic slant , but straight up said i , and most other commenters in the thread , came from stormfront etc. 
  then i 'll set myself up for ridicule . 
  with the notable aside of the very north , where you might see a drawn out deal making process with the kurds , and a stand off with turkish ( backed ) forces , i 'll go on record with the prediction that all other theatres of war will be pacified during the coming year . 
  once a clear turning point has been reached , and the verdict is in , momentum tends to just build towards the end . 
  good grief !, 
  did he , as a german `` journalist '' - no , as a plain educated grown up - ** not know ** that honecker had gone to join the marxist male choir in the sky ? 
  the guy is entertaining , in his way . 
  but he 's starting to rob me of my faith in human evolution . 
  christmas is the old celebration of the winter solstice , which was celebrated by most european peoples in pagan times . 
  here in scandinavia it was , and is , called jol/jul . 
  the ancient romans had their saturnalia , etc. 
  the early christian church had a very pragmatic policy of not trying to rob converts of their old holidays . 
  so they 'd just go , `` oh , you celebrate the winter solstice ? 
  did you know that it just so happens that jesus was born then ? 
  imagine that ! '', 
  even though the biblical scriptures point to his birth being in the late summer . 
  i did n't think we 'd ever see video footage of hillary clinton on election night ... 
  it has a core of truth . 
  but , and this is a shakira size butt but , it is so far from being the main driver and shaper of the course of the conflict , or even the main explanation for the radical secterianism of the rebellion , that the cartoon ends up almost being a lie of omission . 
  there 's such a thing as having such an open mind your brain falls out ... 
   your principles of western compassion, 
  a rather recent addition to the western book of virtues , with the jury still being out on the question of whether it should best be relegated to footnote status under `` quid pro quo '' again in future editions . 
  what you 're saying is not without merit . 
  but when it comes to an ideology as extreme as salafism it 's a bit like saying there were nazis who did n't believe in actively declaring war for lebensraum . 
  it 's a distinction i 'm not sure it 's profitable to make . 
   there is not a single country in the world that could successfully invade saudi arabia . 
  i was almost with you in your claim that the saudis could smash through the opposition in yemen if they paid no heed to the pr hit . 
  but the above claim sits firmly in the land of lol . 
  it is abundantly clear that nigh on no nation gets as damp a bang for their buck in military expenditure as saudi arabia , and that they 'd fall flat on their face in a straight up fight , with no foreign backing , in a conflict with even major regional powers , let alone global ones . 
  what i 'm saying is that there are some scenarios that can be argued , but only in the abstract . 
  could you have a nazi society that 's not a clear and present danger to those around them ? 
  yes , in theory . 
  in practice , no . 
  likewise , could you have a salafi society which would be stable and at peace with others not sharing their faith within and without ? 
  in theory , sure . 
  in reality , not so much . 
  note that i wrote , `` in a straight up fight , with no foreign backing . '', 
  the argument was about saudi arabia 's * own * military spending and strength . 
  so , just for the sake of clarity , are you saying that slavery is ok as long as , `` they arent [ ... ] treated like shit '' ? 
   every army takes pows , who are basically slaves is what im saying . 
  [ uh , no ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/third_geneva_convention ) . 
  yes , but they are not kept as slaves . 
  they are not ghanima to serve you . 
  they are * prisoners * , to be released , at the latest , at the end of hostilities . 
  i can see why adding the gulf monarchies would be politically problematic ( as in wall street would go completely monkey guano if their saudi benefactors had the door slammed in their face ) . 
  ** but ** ... there 's no getting away from the fact that it does leave the list largely meaningless , and the one case so far where an election promise has been smoke and mirrored . 
  i 'm not sure they 're that clever , to be honest . 
  too clever by half , more like it . 
  this is why russia always punch above their weight , and china below . 
  russia shows that they * will * stand by an ally , even when it costs them and when it 's not `` convenient '' , while china almost always defaults to : `` what have you done for me lately ? 
  show me the money ! '', 
  paralelle systemer for justis og sosial orden . 
  while i may disagree on a number of points , it is still , in my oppinion , an interesting and valuable perspective on one side of the conflict . 
  i just just had a glorious vision of [ colonel jack o'neill with a mustard and ketchup smily face on a plate ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6i5awvabs ), 
  as much as i would like it to be that clear cut , i 'd have to say the pardoning of nixon and iran-contra set the precedent . 
  on rule # 1 of the establishment , that no member of said establishment shall ever suffer for their actions , there is near cross party unanimity , not only in the us , but the entire west . 
  not only would this seem to contradict , in spirit at least , what ambassador haley just said in the un , but even his own comments as late as yesterday . 
  it 's one thing to keep your cards close to your vest ; but the trump administration is now quickly twirling into incoherence .
