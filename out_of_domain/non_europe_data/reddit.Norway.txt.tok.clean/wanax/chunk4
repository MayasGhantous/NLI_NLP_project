  we are seeing the hard limits of trump 's `` art of the deal '' . 
  to make a deal you have to have something credible to offer . 
  even * if * trump * wanted * to make a deal of some sort with russia , which would have to involve at least some carrot , as opposed to only stick , it 's now crystal clear that he is unable to deliver . 
  he would not even have to be overruled by congress . 
  his own cabinet would put the kibosh on it at this point . 
  you ca n't play poker , even if you 're a master bluffer , if you 've got nothing to put in the pot , and a suite at mar-a-lago and a trump steak with ketchup wo n't do it . . 
   i also got the impression the paper is in the anti trump camp . 
  in the same way as karl marx was slightly anti-capitalist . 
   though in truth it 's more that the wp , in particular the opp pages , speaks for the neocon/neoliberal washington establishment , and thus abhorred trump 's , initial , anti-globalist and anti-interventionist rhetoric . 
  not really either . 
  the neocon/neoliberal consensus is socially liberal , economically pro wall street , and interventionist in foreign policy - that covers about 70 % of top tier politicians of both major parties . 
  not any traditional or `` respectable '' one with any footprint in washington . 
  his core support * used * to be the so called alt-right and the paleocons that once marched under the banner of pat buchanan . 
  he starts out from a common sense point of view probably shared by most people on this board , but then just muddies it a bit by layering on a bit of too clever by half academic boilerplate and a tad of socialist wishful thinking . 
  * shrugs *,

  in an ideal world ... no , not even in an ideal world . 
  because his username , and his comments , and his large number of posts , all tell you that this is not simply a case of having a bias , but plain not acting in good faith , even though it might , mostly , be within the formal rules of the venue . 
  it would be a bit like registering the name `` killallmuslims '' , and then going to a subreddit for ecumenical religious debate , and only , and every day , posting links about how terrible islam is and how horrid muslims are , a number of which are easily proven false . 
  it would n't need a `` brigade '' for the downvotes to start rolling in ... 
  i ca n't speak for anyone else ; and i 'm sure there are some posters who are motivated by their support for the kurdish cause . 
  but as for myself , i 'm not part of any `` ypg echo chamber '' , as i 'm a norwegian with no dog in this fight , other than a general dislike of the islamist dog . 
  sigh . 
  in the very paragraph you quote it 's stated that it 's not just his username that causes him problems . 
  her kan det trenges tre bein og stretchbukse ...

  er du full ? 
  you have a point about distance from a conflict turning it into a video game , or a morality play . 
  but speaking as a neighbour to that country , sweden is a [ `` special '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/special_needs ) case . 
  noone does self-righteous moralizing combined with shallow understanding quite like them . 
  hmm . 
  so according to you , being against mass immigration , in all countries , and personally against all religion , particularly in politics , means that one views all middle-easterners as subhuman and want them to kill each other ? 
  with logical leaps like that you qualify as a new circus act - intellectual trapeze artist clown . 
  `` a big hand of applause , everybody ! '', 
  who the hell are you talking to ? 
  `` you people '' ... what people ? 
  europeans ? 
  fans of swing music ? 
  it helps to be specific . 
  because now you 're just ranting at me like a drunk , throwing general assumptions and accusations about opinions i do not hold . 
  coalrubber : `` defend the position that ` you people ' eat babies !, 
  and why do ` you people ' hate puppies !? 
  and why wo n't you buy me another drink !? 
  hick ! '', 
  i know this is not feasible in subnautica vanilla 1.0 . 
  but my daydream is a larger map , and not only for the sake of it , but for game mechanics reasons . 
  first the more cosmetic ideas . 
  extend the map with a tropical barrier reef and shallow sands zone between the pod and the floating island , making it almost impossible to simply swim there , and hard to get to even with the seaglide . 
  make the sea treader 's path a real migratory path stretching along almost an entire side of the map . 
  but then , add a wide northern semi arctic sea zone with schools of largeish fish , predators that prey on them , [ angler style fish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lophius_piscatorius ) that lie hidden in the sands of the murky sea bottom . 
  and then beyond that ... 
  the once proposed arctic zone , where cold temperatures , rather than hot become a problem . 
  you would freeze to death in a short time here in anything but the cyclops . 
  and this is where you had to venture , after having solved the carar problem , to get the pieces/raw materials for the rocket to actually get off the planet . 
  it would be almost a new stage of the game . 
  a non-article filled with non-thought based on non-reality deserves nothing less ... 
  propaganda only merits analysis as propaganda , as it really does n't have substance , only the pretence of it . 
  a while ago [ gordanfreeman50 posted a question ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pipetobacco/comments/19kvit/flavoring_your_tobacco/ ) about flavouring of tobacco , and i wrote a bit about my experiences with casing and topping of aromatic style tobaccos . 
  at the time i was in the process of trying out some more complex varieties , based less on casing with various flavourings and sugars , but on more fundamental treatment of the raw tobacco , such as smoke curing and the cavendish steam treatment . 
  as there was obviously an interest in such experiments , [ i thought i 'd document my very non-professional adventure in potentially ruining some tobacco ... ] ( http://imgur.com/a/4uei9 ), 
  and yes , it turned out quite nicely . 
  smoking a bowl of it right now , though it will profit from some further aging . 
  to start with , my apologies for what turned out to be a rather long read . 
  i do hope there 's some worthwhile info along the ramble . 
  now and then questions have cropped up on this subreddit about various methods of making , or modifying , tobaccos . 
  and having accumulated some experience , i 've learned two things : 1 ) how much i 've yet to learn . 
  and 2 ) how little verified , up to date , scientifically sound information is available out there . 
  the intrepid hobbyist is forced to sift through scattered forum posts on this and that detail through google-fu , academic collections , ancient farmer 's manuals , and more or less credible rumours about producers ' trade secrets and secret sauces . 
  so it seems to me that there is much to be gained by discussion and pooling of knowledge in this area . 
  of course this is an incredibly broad topic , which ranges all the way from simply mixing two or more off the shelf blends , through casing and toppings , treatment of raw tobacco and [ whole leaf ] ( http://youtu.be/nnr4ilzfevo ) , all the way to growing your own . 
  ** aromatics **, 
  there are quite a number of options for making various aromatic and `` english '' style blends . 
  casing to make an aromatic can be as simple as putting a shot glass with some rum , whisky or other liquor into a closed container with the tobacco and letting the fumes impregnate it over a couple of days . 
  even if you do n't want a rum or brandy taste in your tobacco , a pure alcohol/vodka is usually key to making most aromatics due to its properties as a solvent . 
  some aromatic oils and flavour compounds can not be dissolved in water , but readilly does so in alcohol . 
  the alcohol can then carry the flavours into the tobacco leaves . 
  this can be easilly done by simply mixing or steeping your casings in the alcohol , whether it be sugar , honey , licorice extract , vanilla , what have you . 
  then you pour the liquid into a handy spray bottle ( i use a smallish plastic spray bottle which once contained window washing soap ) . 
  you spread your tobacco/leaves on a fitting surface , perhaps on some brown paper . 
  and then you spray/mist them with the casing , turn and repeat . 
  then you pack the tobacco in some reasonably air tight container for a while to allow the casing to impreganate it . 
  then you leave it out for the alcohol to evaporate and the tobacco to dry to prefered humidity for smoking . 
  ** english : complicated simplicity **, 
  first off , there is some confusion as that what exactly an `` english blend '' is . 
  as a number of englishes contained the pungent smoke cured syrian tobacco called latakia ( so named for the mediterranean port city of the same name , now sadly in the news for other reasons ) , many americans began to identify english blends simply as any blend containing latakia . 
  this misunderstanding largely remains to this day . 
  but what makes an english blend is actually purity . 
  back in the day when the height of hygiene in europe was emptying your chamber pot out the window onto the head of any unlucky passers by , there paradoxically was a fad for so called purity laws ( which had nothing to do with hygiene by the way ) . 
  the most famous example was the german reinheitsgebot , which also became the law of the land in other nations , such as my own country , norway , dictating the ingredients of beer , limiting them to only water , barley , hops and yeast . 
  the english , [ whose nascent empire in the americas was partly built on tobacco ] ( http://youtu.be/sotlrmk3a6s ) , had their own purity laws dictating the contents of tobacco blends . 
  basically any tobacco legally sold in england and its domains could contain no `` artificial '' additives , no casings , no toppings , no soup for you . 
  this forced english tobacconists and producers to get creative within the limits of the law and the constraints of pure tobacco over the years . 
  they were helped by the fact that england as a seafaring trading empire could source a wide variety of tobaccos from all over the world , be it the aforementioned syrian latakia , virginias and cavendish from their own colonies and , later , the united states , orientals from the balkans , turkish and so on . 
  many such pure `` blending tobaccos '' can be bought at well stocked tobacconists and over the net . 
  some can even be `` faked '' to a certain extent by the diy inclined hobbyist . 
  cavendish , for example , is a process ( perhaps discovered by chance as a result of transporting tobacco tightly packed in old rum barrels in hot humid ships across the atlantic ) , not a strain of tobacco plant . 
  even a smoke cured latakia like leaf can be produced , with the added bonus that you yourself can control just what flavours , besides campfire smokiness , is added to the smoking process . 
  by the way , yes , the latakia could strictly speaking be said to be a sort of cased tobacco .
