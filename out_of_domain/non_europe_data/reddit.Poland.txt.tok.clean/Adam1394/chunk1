  `` if the giants almost made it to the playoffs without a good pitching lineup and hunter pence and joe panik out most of the season , you can almost imagine what they ' l be like this year . 
  i 'm calling it right now , it 's gona be sf vs cubs nlcs then a sf vs kc rematch . '', 
  100 % agree, 
  with defence of ours i 'm thinking no-no or even perfecto this season !, 
  now sell or release pagan , buy someone who can field at lf/cf ( dreaming of speedy granderson ... ) and 2016 is ours . 
  ps : how to add sf badge next to my nick ?

  sharkcueto + crawnik combination will destroy nl defence .

  born and live in szczecin for last 20 years [ i 'm 21 ] . 
  stettin is not actual tourist city , looks like a 150km away berlin 's district sometimes [ i mean architectural ] . 
  you should shoot city hall club [ near train station ] - best for now club in town . 
  i 'm free 'till 7th jan & in szczecin , so if want to ask for something or meet up in here pm me . 
  adam, 
  ps : stettin was most damaged city [ in now poland ] during wwii ( over 90 % ) so do n't expect many attractions . 
  it depends , how long you have been into ? 
  how old ? 
  only no pmo or hardmode ? 
  10-30 [ whatever ] pushups , cold-shower , go buy some fruits . 
  that was at my 18th bday . 
  greatest bgift ever . 
  i would literally kill for ticket cardinals vs. giants game at stan musial stadium in poland . 
  someone will reach 5000 hits before cubs and white sox will make world series again . 
  signs with mariners , reach world series with 'em , no-hit padres in game7 . 
  '94 gwynn 's .400 season stolen by strike .

  he 's very good known in ( small ) polish baseball & softball community , actually only little league venue in europe was partly financed by him , so it 's named after him ( kutno , poland ) . 
  carl hubbell vs lefty .

  over .400 happend earlier , 50 + hits streak never did , and never will . 
  2010 and giants ? 
  giants were 1st in their division in 2012 last time , and they 're first overall ? 
  greinke is a good hitting-pitcher too , and i 'm giants fan . 
  giants will celebrate 5th in 9 . 
  quite popular in poland . 
  explain . 
  you mean postseason ? 
  fuck the dh, 
  brook ... los angeles dodgers - kershaw/gonzalez, 
  new york yankees - a-ro ( i ) d/ellsbury, 
  it was in kc ... 
  since i live in europe i hate wake up at 2-3 am to watch giants game . 
  so yes , fuck night games . 
  designated pick-off throwers , pitchers are supposed to pitch not to throw to base . 
  did you saw lester pick off move ? 
  poles can hate governments , never simple people . 
  so you do n't have to worry . 
  regular season game @ cuban stadium . 
  fuck the dh,
