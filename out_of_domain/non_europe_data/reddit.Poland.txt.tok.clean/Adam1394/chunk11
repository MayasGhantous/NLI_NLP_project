  how much of 'em are yuropeanuts ? 
  #let 's go rivercats !, 
  please orange bros , kick their butts . 
  wild ride !, 
  he just wants to make 2 outs first . 
  #pants off !, 
  now our orange bros have to kick doyers ' butts . 
  #orange bros !, 
  hunter `` unorthodox '' pence, 
  no-hitler today !, 
  save that post , 
  they did not scored . 
  pc version is fixed . 
  but in mlb2k11 you can steal home , by return to 3rd and go for home . 
  top 12th , runners on 1st & 3rd , 2 outs . 
  take my orange power for next inning , bros !, 
  fuck the dodgers !, 
  inch !, 
  baltimore chop !, 
  ~ ~ giants ~ ~ rivercats .621 ( 54-33 ), 
  ftfy, 
  y' all can say what you want but , sandoval , pence & morse was the best trio in ( at least ) last decade . 
  [ right ? 
  ] ( https://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/67457980.jpg ), 
  at least he was in world series !, 
  is n't a 's - giants much closer than angels-doyers ? 
  wind . 
  2-4 , hr , 2b , bb , 3rbi, 
  i do n't like this all-star shit anymore . 
  the nl gon na lose for not givin ' us home field advantage in ws , save that post . 
  edit : will bum credited as all-star ? 
  edit2 : ca n't someone pitch 0.1 inning for `` start '' to go around this rule ? 
  edit3 : aledmys diaz over crawford ? 
  really mlb ? 
  aledmys diaz over crawford ... 
  ... kill me dead . 
  pagan is not that bad now , and with healthy outfield + blanco + our aaaa guys , we ca n't afford to lose another duval , when we 're first in blown saves . 
  what if pitcher try to pick-off and overthrow ? 
  stolen base ? 
  edit : also you can score on triple play . 
  is n't blocking view an interference ? 
  edit : panik would throw him out . 
  ~ ~ no damage done ~ ~ , but 26 ( ? ), 
  pitches ... 
  edit : i forgot about the foods and drinks . 
  3 weak grounders to 2b . 
  #pagan you 're my angel < 3, 
  #buster posey with 3-pointer , 
   splash hit # 71, 
  magic wandoo !, 
  edit : if it hits his face ... goshhh ... 
  [ just found that on baseball subreddit ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/4s242s/the_best_way_to_catch_a_foul_ball/d55w0gx ), 
  brandon `` i do n't care about all-star game '' crawford !!, 
  i 'd still be 3-2 . 
   this is n't ** even ** the giants ' final form . 
  i see what you did there . 
  that game costs bum all-star game start . 
  better score some runs for him boys !!, 
  i thought it 's gon na be career ending injury . 
  [ how about bullpens in fair territory ?

  ####### just giants ' things ... 
  you 're my first giants ' fan downvoted in veryyyyy long time . 
  enjoy !, 
  is your dad jake lamb ? 
  ~ ~ 12.5 % he patrols only left side of the diamond . ~ ~, 
  unless he 's shifted . 
   2011 : halladay was insane 'till injury . 
   2012 : cain pitched perfect game 4 weeks earlier , so that 's the thing . 
   2013 : home start for harvey ?? 
   2014 : he ( kershaw ) pitched no-hitter ( perfecto ruined just because error ) 4 weeks earlier wtf matheny ?!?!, 
   2015 : that 's classic blue on blue fire ( that wordplay :d ) . 
  i dunno why , but that last camera 's angle makes it like virtual reality . 
  inb4 trout is out of this reality , i know , he is . 
  if they ever play in europe , game should start at 10am , so american fans could feel our 3am baseball . 
  english-speak rate in holland is like 95 % + i guess ... 
  if they not `` pushed '' it to asia , there would n't be players like ichiro etc. 
  max kepler is good tease what europan schools can bring into major league , mlb can make money , fans can watch more the-best players from around the world . 
  it 's win-win situation for me , but i can be biased . 
  it 's now illegal !, 
  no until official edict . 
  is stealing signs counts ? 
  i mean by telescope and buzzer in dogout ? 
  worst one is that the games start at 1 ~ 3am . 
  i was happy in 2010 , 2012 , 2014 socthat 's enough . 
  ^ ^ ^ hope ^ ^ ^ i 'll ^ ^ ^ be ^ ^ ^ happy ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ 2016 ^ ^ ^ too !, 
  he should bat left handed on 2nd attempt . 
  big time timmy jim !, 
  i know he 's on angels right now . 
  and g.o.a.t from deeeeeeeeep third !,
