  september is really bad month to start real baseball experience . 
  british league just ended/ends in days/weeks - look for championship games for british baseball league/triple-a/double-a / single-a in your neighbourhood . 
  and games : world series 2011 game 6 and american league wild card game 2014 . 
  and hey [ it 's best baseball rules playlist on entire youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmyxzamxulg&amp;list=plaj29nf-lkg7v5z9zg3ssjmpvccutnhqx ) .

  - ~ ~ hunter pence ~ ~ buster posey 's good friend, 
  ftfy, 
  just want to write the same thing . 
  i posted it here day or 2 ago , but zastryzny has missed letter in his surname - should be zastr ** z ** yzny . 
  wind 's gods are on our side , i 'll take that . 
  i 'm sayin ' that with european perspective , 3/4 leagues in here ends in early september , so it 's like week or two ( at top ) to watch live baseball ( not in tv/web ) . 
  zas-try-zny . 
  they missed that 'cause those r 's are mute ( if you ca n't say rz = \u017c = gi like in gillete , polish language is real wirdo for forigners ) .

  pence with 2nd bomb , save this post . 
  subtract another point for not being vin scully . 
  how many runners on bases the nl sss did leave ( leaved ? ), 
  in all-star game ? 
  actually forget about it ... 
  i just stayed up until 5am here in europe to watch how boch shoots himself in a head with that bullshit move ? 
  i hate baseball sometimes . 
  what could go wrong with gearrin and bases loaded ? 
  pinch hit big mac in next inning boch !, 
  ftfy, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ have ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ type ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ double - \\, 
  maybe he ca n't co-operate with our future hof hunter pence 's good friend ? 
  tri-headed zombies ? 
  i really do n't know ** how ** we 're still just 2 games back , with the way we play game after asg ... 
  our bats are cold as coldest winter in antarctica . 
  that 's why . 
  who watch 'em when we have k&k ? 
  he 's calling last games in october ( at at&t ) , so technically you will . 
  mark trot pigface . 
  make it 2 giants !!!, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ or ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ will ^ ^ ^ ^ be ^ ^ ^ ^ real ^ ^ ^ ^ sad, 
  that 's golden glove buster for you !, 
  since we did n't lost game 5 in nlds right ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ or ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ game ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ 7 ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ nlcs, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ last ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ 6 ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ years, 
  at least padres doin ' their job . 
  why pence did not tried to advance to first ? 
  ca n't you run with less than 2 outs ** but ** when your teammates advance ? 
  i hate that crowd , every hitted ball i 'm scared it has hr distance in it , and then it 's easy flyout . 
  da bums with 5-4 lead in la. 
  then we 'll win in most giants ' way 'cause curse of goat . 
  casilla just saved our record !, 
  he 's real deal . 
  he should just use a cap by now , the ` ol style baseball , when nobody gave a shit about safety . 
  baet the dodgers !, 
  go go richmond !, 
  is 6 an odd number ? 
  just wonder , what his stats would look like wit 162 games per season . 
  `` india '' version seems to not work at all . 
  expect nothing . 
  win for vin !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ right ? 
  ## magic wandooo ^ o ^ o ^ o ^ o ^ o ^ o arrive !, 
  i want to beli ** even ** , but expect nothing . 
  we play against them 6 times this season , we can catch 'em ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ easy . 
  beli ** even **, 
  with a balk . 
  pence and belt are the only second pair of teammates to get at least one hit in every game of a seven-game ws ( 2014 ) . 
  i do n't know what first pair is , someone ? 
  [ i love you hunter pence < 3 ] ( http://m.mlb.com/video/topic/6479266/v36722985/nl-wc-pence-greets-each-teammate-with-new-handshake ), 
  more 3ip starts and he wo n't . 
  [ no hitler !, 
  i hope , today endless ride finally ends ... 
  he 's not even all-star ... 
  why there 's no vin on moment like that ?!? 
  i know ... 
  was there any combined perfect game ? 
  i can just laugh ... 
  i know they 're da bums , but i refuse to wish injury or broken no-no/perfect to anyone .
