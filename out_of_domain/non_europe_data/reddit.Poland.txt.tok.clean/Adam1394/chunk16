  what 's bum 's run support & what 's cueto 's run support in 2016 season ? 
  hey ... it 's not ** that ** la !, 
  i love you mike trout !, 
  ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ fuck ^ ^ ^ anaheim ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ rally ^ ^ ^ monkey , ^ ^ ^ always !, 
  just wonder how run support affects the confidence on the mound . 
  i just saw too many games when giants could n't score run or two to support bum 's psycho . 
  e : it 's 90 % mental , half physical , right ? . 
  i had ` uuuuuuuge hope for orange world series in 2014 . 
  of course she 's in celibacy ...

  2 pitches , 2 bases ... 
  mnf ? 
  we 're 0.5 gb in wild card race . 
  if he play on `` david `` ichiro suzuki '' ortiz '' level , he has 7-10 years of playing , so nice shot for 4000 i guess . 
  ~ ~ not 2b , there is protocol how to play with 3 umps . ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ field umps just will adjust . ~ ~, 
  was wrong . 
  san francisco these guys, 
  doyers 5-5, 
  giants 10-0, 
  tie for 1st place in nl west, 
  magic wandooo arrive !, 
  give that man 100th win !, 
  today !, 
  if mlb invest more in european market i would be so happy . 
  steve bartman is still alive . 
  i like butter . 
  he 's not even all-star ... 
  crawford is not even all-star ... 
  it is , and it is often . 
  just wait for mlb 's postseason/world series i guess . 
  discount range is between -30 % to -75 % iirc . 
  ftfy, 
  why your flair works and mine not ? 
   2nd place this year ( ~ ~ samardzija ~ ~ \u0421\u0430\u043ca\u0440\u0434\u0436\u0438\u0458\u0430 ) has 9 .

  ^ ^ ^ hits ^ ^ ^ one ^ ^ ^ into ^ ^ ^ right !!!!!!!, 
  hope bravos can win a game too !, 
  what if he hits one into ... ** left ** ... this time ? 
  thanks bravos !, 
  local league in north-east germany . 
  is kinda sucks 'cause 6 of 8 fields are on old soccer pitch , so it 's like 200 feet to right-field wall . 
  longest travel is like 2.5-3h each side , so we play double-headers ( 7 innings ) . 
  we have 7 games to gain 3 . 
  it 's not impossible , but tough for sure . 
  edit : i 'm considering `` sweep against doyers @ at/t - scenario '' , to be precise . 
  i 'm 160lbs and he 's like 250lbs , but i 'll try , 
  i refuse to believe that we 're like ~ 0.500 with that rotation . 
  you had one job philly !, 
   it would be great to have three tv so that i can follow giants , cardinals , and mets all at the same time . 
  mlb.tv is an answer .
