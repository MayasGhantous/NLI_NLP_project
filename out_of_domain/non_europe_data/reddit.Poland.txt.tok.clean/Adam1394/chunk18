  cy blach to win ws game 7 !, 
  i 'm just newbie , who likes baseball , but unfortunately baseball season ( regular ) ends today , so wanted to keep up with another bat-and-ball game . 
  would like more to see leagues ' teams than national teams . 
  just trade panik . 
  to that guy who 's cutting fuckin ' onions ... 
  i 'll kick your ass !, 
  i 'm interested in mets game right now tbh . 
  we were in 7th inning after hour , yesterday ... 
  it 's not even our final form . 
  v for vin ? 
  * `` darn right !, 
  this guy is invading me in every vin thread . 
  gosh ... 
  you can say all you want , but yankees-red sox rivalry is not even half good as our little one ... 
  that 's 100 % unorthodox . 
  * bing-bang-bong * - vin scully, 
  polish fella out here !, 
  cheers from szczecin !, 
  [ here is link for radio archive , included 3rd october 1936 yankees vs giants broadcast ] ( https://archive.org/details/baseballotr30 ), 
  just day after vin scully , the little red-headed kid become rabid giants ' fan . 
  [ we 're back !, 
  ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/yj5uda4elp8wc/giphy.gif ), 
  we 'll win this ws against rangers to re-start the cycle . 
  what would you do if giants won ws again against y' all ? 
  i hope he 'll develop for a next big-time-left-handed-pitcher-who-owns-kershaw 's - ass, 
  and we were in the middle of the slump iirc . 
  so we 've got chance here . 
  go orange bros !, 
  how much in [ ottoman empire liras ? 
  it would be only tie with safe call . 
  giants are 10-0 in postseason series this decade , and 8-0 in games they faced elimination . 
  best option imo . 
  but it should n't take 3 games to decide , champion ca n't wait that much . 
  gosh , i love ootp community , thank you very much !, 
  kaos !!, 
  do we have red opponent in our div . 
   gamechanger, 
  is there any alternative for not apple users ? 
  oh , i always consider 'em as violet ones , but you 're right . 
  you took a picture instead of printscreen ? 
  i 'm rhp and 90 % of hitters are also right handed , so slider could work . 
  thank you very much !,

  ca n't wait for madison 's no-hitter/perfect game last pitch caught by hunter pence ... 's good friend . 
  [ thats our polishboy !, 
  giants in 3 . 
  joe panik would not agree with osuna 's shoe . 
  i full respect your season this year , but all parts of me want to rip off doyers in nlcs . 
  i love that meme . 
  nice . 
  nice . 
  ump would call it strike anyway . 
  i fuckin ' hate that strikezone , ca n't handle it in such cluch game . 
  he was sooooooo close to reach unassisted triple play as outfielder . 
  trade him already . 
  thanks , we were here in 2012 , so we bought tickets for 3-2 for nlcs boat as well . 
  are you pole ? 
  it starts 3:30 am here , where i live . 
  [ my feelings right now ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz4x4axg5ui ),

  now two runs !, 
  got better ones - * giants champions !, 
  you want joe buck back ? 
  remember the ~ ~ alamo ! ~ ~ 2012 nlds !, 
  it 's 3:40 am in europe , you know nothing about october baseball . 
  ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ fun ^ ^ ^ at ^ ^ ^ all . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ mean ^ ^ ^ ^ lack ^ ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ ^ sleep . 
  i hate that i have no stream with 'em . 
  was there any ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ papa slam by pitcher ? 
  that worked last time with bum on mound and against their `` ace '' pitcher , right ? 
  21 pitches , unlikely . 
  like in last 2 weeks ? 
  because bruce bochy . 
  leaning into pitch is not so cute . 
  he saved 90 feet if not a run ... nice def . 
  new nl central team : chicago * pitchers *, 
  that bochy 's sad face : < < < < < kill me now . 
  it 's actually ** postseason ** . 
  he knows eybs for sure , at end , buster scored grand slam , right ? 
  edit : i mean in 2012 nlds game 5 . 
  somebody will lose his job tonite ', 
  not my mother 's tongue , sorry . 
  it 's second inning , just wait for eybs finest form .
