  how about schools only to develop players ? 
  more european players = more european interest in baseball [ like max keppler and german/berlin hype ] = more market = more $ .

  shoeless joe ( which he should be in hof ) ` case 1919 . 
  some relief pitcher would n't be bad ( lefty ? ), 
  he hit 71st and 72nd in the same game . 
  71st was breaker . 
  or in continental europe , games start even hour later ... 
  not san francisco bumgarners for sure . 
  no `` fuck the dh '' comment ? 
  new giants ' strategy to win ws - butt squeeze . 
  * `` pence do n't help cause ... '' *,

  best tie in my life . 
  1.000 avg with over 700h , 300rbis , 250hrs and 162-0 season . 
  shoeless joe, 
  game winning rbi for 2014 giants come from `` dh '' moorse, 
  it will be 2-3 games race , and arizona might be 1st-2nd . 
  there should be computer calling strike-zone . 
  long ground-rule-doubles should score every runner , even on 1st . 
  some 60 's or 70 's all-star ? 
  1971 had 25 hofs ( without umps , so probably even more ), 
  or vpns,

  he was n't play with mays 'cause giants paid $ 50 less ... 
  giants :|, 
  where are cold showers and meditations ? 
  poland can confirm . 
  failure is part of winning . 
  stay positive , and avoid triggers/baits/urges which caught you this time . 
  go for walk/run and do n't sit at home .
