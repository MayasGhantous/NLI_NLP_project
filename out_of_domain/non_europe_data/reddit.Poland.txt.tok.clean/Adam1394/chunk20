  it 's very strange to say that but brandon crawford 's error costs us a game . 
  ^ ^ ^ worth ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ mention ^ ^ ^ we ^ ^ ^ got ^ ^ ^ trashbin ^ ^ ^ bullpen . 
  with 2 baserunners inherited . 
  how the odds for perfect game in world series clinch are ? 
  samuraj japan is real thing !, 
  flannery - third, 
  kelly - first, 
  that was good duo . 
  [ bonus ] ( http://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/40/files/2013/05/flanwalkoffinsidepark.gif ), 
   washington nationals ** playoff ** game . 
  it 's ** postseason ** for god 's sake !, 
  is 2 text messages harassment in us&a ? 
  gosh ... 
  post of the day . 
  there were 8 balls to walk , and fouls were n't strikes . 
  only 3-4 world series wins from cubs can take our giants `` team of decade '' status . 
  whoever but not la , that 's my opinion . 
  and fuck the dh of course !, 
  [ 100 % relevant ] ( https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_the_ottoman_empire.svg ), 
  that 's for you heretic scum !,

  not to mention other things . 
  once a giant always a giant . 
  rest in peace in peace ? 
  higher is better , right ? 
  oko\u0144, 
  i 'm sure they 've got newer phones in 1945 . 
  manfred 's dream . 
  but dodgers/giants recognise their history as ny teams ( ws , pennants etc ) . 
  punch ? 
  he 's ** bat ** boy after all ... 
  that ball was n't in the dirt , cheaters !, 
  holy roman empire vs. roman empire war ? 
  gosh !!, 
  what about c-c-c-combo ** b ** reaker ? 
  starters need at least 3 good pitches , he got 1 ( or 2 ) . 
  he had some starts in minors . 
  why on walk-offs , player who scores did n't wait near home plate , waiting hitter to get easy triple for boost stats ? 
  hello yropean m8 !, 
  where 's your flair ? 
  you 're not in ws already , you know it ? 
  that salty cubs ' fans ,

  you mean that great dh who won hr derby ? 
  i like 2-div 8-teams better . 
  i wish we had field that large here in europe , instead of soccer ^ ^ fuckin ' pitches everywhere . 
  cool update !, 
  no-hitters ? 
  i hate that cockyness of you , remember 2003 .

  fly the ** w **, 
  fuck the doyers & dh !, 
  ^ ^ ^ am ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ still ^ ^ ^ heterosexual ?

  lmao, 
  gustav wei\u00dfkopf was first man to fly . 
  you can fly wwwwwwwwwwwwww ... . 
  #yeeeees !, 
  30 is the worst , 'cause you have to schedule interleague games through all season . 
  4 divisions ( al east/west + nl east/west ) + 4 wild cards is the best way . 
  chicago had jordan , 6 is enough . 
  kkkkkkueto !, 
  #of course he 's edited . 
  [ batting stats here . 
  salary : over $ 1.7 bilion ( 1.7 * 10 ^ ^ 9 ) - i had 2-5 % range inflation . 
  t-1st in wins ( with cy young ) , 3 strikeouts shy of 8000ks , 358 pitching + batting war . 
  2032-2033 injury costs him standalone 1st place with wins , 3 years in dh league costs him 100hr mark . 
  4 no-hitters with 3 perfect games within . 
  did n't had 100 % vote inductee , only player to do so was kershaw in 2035 ( first ballot ) . 
  bobby thomson of course !, 
  jokes aside : someone made `` hacked '' player in early days of baseball , and someone else asked for player like this in nowday mlb , which i did . 
  [ yep , injury . 
  never heard of `` the giants win the pennant !, 
  the giants win the pennant !, 
  the giants win the pennant ! '', 
  thing ?
