  that was him ( i mean the hr hitter , not announcer ) . 
  i know ... even force him into free agency twice , and he still put an ink at cardinals ' deal . 
  my 2 cents :, 
  2 subleagues with 2 divisions each , 8 teams in div . 
  [ here are the schedules ] ( http://www.ootpdevelopments.com/board/ootp-mods-schedules/254139-new-schedule-request.html#post3900097 ), 
  winners go into postseason + 3 wild cards ( that 's 10 teams in postseason ) . 
  i usually add montreal into al east and portland into nl west . 
  i found error : astros are not in nl . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ that 's ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ joke . 
  yes i did/do , they 're rumors about relocate tb rays into montreal , so why not ? 
  expos-blue jays rivalry 'd be a thing .

  [ article link ] ( http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/did-the-1994-strike-cost-tony-gwynn-a-400-batting-average/ ), 
   what 's more , gwynn was actually on a hot streak when the season abruptly ended . 
  in his ** last 29 games , he was 49-for-115 ( .426 ) ** with just four strikeouts . 
  in the padres ' 10 games in august , gwynn was ** 19-for-40 ( .475 ) ** with seven multi-hit games and three three-hit games . 
  he was as consistent as possible that season , with his average never dipping below .376 after april . 
  in fact , the ** low point in july and/or august was .382 ** . 
  decent shot for me . 
  is he denard span 's brother or smth ? 
  how about wild pitch/passed ball ? 
  36.6 % i recon . 
  not dodgers ? 
  that 's enough for me !, 
  i have to add , that ootp ** do not ** support steam cloud for your saves , so you have to move them with some pendrive . 
  my 50 year season is like 2.3 gb , that 's the reason steam ca n't support it - size . 
  take our power . 
  you just have to say `` fuck the dodgers '' . 
  there are n't dodgers to celebrate in their dogout . 
  london football wtf ? 
  just heard some tbs , they 're ** even ** worse . 
  you missed expos in 1994 , mlb . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ joke . 
  1 error with high ball call for cubs . 
  do you ever play 170 games a season , and then game at 40 fahrenheits ? 
  i did 300 for to begin with .

  game 5 , schwarber 's pinch-hit walk-off hit confirmed . 
  you can say all you want , but he got ** big ** contribution in our 2012 and 2014 wins , i tell you that . 
  ootp does not support players to play for 2 teams at one time . 
  winter leagues are useless right now . 
  there 's ** un-license ** button somewhere . 
  found it !,

  * warriors never lost 2 str8 !, 
  saw berliners once or twice . 
  give germans 15-20 years and they 'll kick butts . 
  hardest position to develop with lack of well trainers in here . 
  hard to admit , but that 's true . 
  i do n't know why mlb/teams wo n't put more money in here , to get more players like max kepler-r\u00f3\u017cycki ( he has polish father , do n't cut that second surname ) . 
  [ click at german speaker ] ( https://translate.google.pl/#en/de/sauerbeer ),
