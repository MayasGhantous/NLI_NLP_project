  fuck this garbage . 
  iirc japan league use runner on 1st in 12-13 inning , and then runners on 1st and 2nd in 14-15th . 
  much better for me . 
  so basically you have free runs because ghost-runners on 1st and 2nd ? 
  to decide the tie in the pool ? 
  what kind of sick joke is this . 
  fuck this shit . 
  they count in tiebreaks . 
  you can hear that only from doyers fan !, 
  it was in books 4 years ago , but no game went to 11th . 
  psychological disadvantage , they 're down 9-3 . 
  it 's top of the inning , not bottom . 
  lol . 
  then start with 3-2 count , this is bullshit . 
  after 2 bullshit ends in one day i really lost attraction to this tournament . 
  they were 10-3 back ... 
  it 's transaction then , not present . 
  duck the foggers !,
