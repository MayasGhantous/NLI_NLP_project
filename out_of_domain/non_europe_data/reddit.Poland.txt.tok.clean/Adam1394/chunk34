  enjoy april !, 
  there are no baseball seasons in odd years . 
  34 minutes about fair/foul ball . 
  i love you baseball , never change . 
  how can pitcher with almost all 50ish stats be 2-stars overall ? 
  bum actually has a wife . 
  he 'd spent more time on dirt bike on off-season , so he 'd be a dirt bike master with no injuries at all . 
  simple . 
  he actually threw 99.7 mph, 
  i had heart attack on last october , at least twice . 
  that 's why they call 'em * `` no-doubteres '' * \u30c3 . 
  and now i want see some cricket ... 
  batting stats after season or 2 ? 
  base-clearing triple to complete the cycle , how often we see that ? 
  that chick at 1:20 with * `` no !, 
  he 's safe !, 
   any playing field constructed by a professional club after june 1 , 1958 , shall provide a minimum distance of 325 feet from home base to the nearest fence . 
  unless you 're the giants . 
  then you can build 309ft to right . 
  little , nice 28th inning strech ... 
  we 're one lost away from being worst team in baseball . 
  ca n't wait to see second half of 2017 .
