  / r/homeplate, 
  i ca n't be so ^ ^ un erected . 
  what inning ? 
  ca n't find it on stream . 
  * losses 2 rbis *, 
  thats pretty much 2017 giants !, 
  having to play most of the games in al is pretty much penalty in my book . 
  literally out of the park . 
  #long gone like an ex-girlfriend !, 
  my axe !, 
  which time in this decade ? 
  where is that d-backs ' funny music ?!, 
  1200k what ? 
  mr. glass, 
  i 'd sell my kidney to watch giants vs dodgers live in london . 
  no kidding . 
  ground-rule-double , for and automatic double . 
  i think rivalry developed in mid 30 's . 
  helmet fall of !, 
  number 53 this season !, 
  4 divisions of 8 teams is better option , also historical . 
  the shortest giants ' dong is 258ft . 
  oh no , it would be crushed 20ft deep on polo grounds . 
  * but nobody cares about wbc !, 
  ! 11 ! 11 * blah blah blah, 
  awesome play ? 
  it 's third base highlight play . 
  know by everone . 
  reported !, 
  they cheated bonds on this milestone . 
  fake news . 
  lifetime . 
  just wait until death . 
  what if he dies ? 
  just wonder how many cycles blew 'cause umpires . 
  helmet stays on head ? 
  it 's not nu\u00f1ez . 
  i hate yankees more . 
  just beat dodgers lads !, 
  you catch the ball , you hit the ball , you throw the ball , you run hard . 
  easy game . 
  it 's actually worse , year by year . 
  he could n't pitch in wbc 'cause * ^ ^ oh ^ ^ ^ no ^ ^ ^ ^ injuries * but dirt bike riding ( in first week of season ) it 's pretty much ** ok ** . 
  they play only 144 per year , so it 's easier to body . 
  also less games per year for break the 2000 mark ( more seasons needed to break it ) .

  fun, 
  #who 's my daddy ? 
  because starting pitchers were worth 2 ticks . 
  not much . 
  first 12 hours are worst , buy if your doctor is good professional and made it nice and clean ( no nerves damaged ) it 's just like any other medical procedure . 
  just make sure you 've got 2-3 icebag made at home , and for god 's sake take pack of tissues with you there . 
  another tip is to clean your mouth with sage tea once 2-3 hours ( do n't swallow it , expectorate it at the end of cleaning ) .
