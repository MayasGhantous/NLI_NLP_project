  hey germany followers , i need some info about earning german passport . 
  i had great-grandfather with dvl iii ( taken in 1942 in lodz , never waived that citizenship . 
  spent 6 months in polish camp for signed it . ), 
  his sister married german officer and had dvl i. i found oryginal dvl in polish archive , indictment for sign dvl . 
  any chance ? 
  #edit : i 'm asking about develop players in europe not to start european league . 
  * more european players = more european interest in baseball [ like max keppler and german/berlin hype ] = more market = more $ . 
  #edit 2 : series of 2-3-4 games should be major event in germany/holland/uk . 
  they can play in southern france/italy some spring training games . 
  it 's not about spending $ 1 billion on european theatre , but develop player in countries like czech republic/slovakia/poland / ukraine/belarus/hugary / croatia ( do n't tell me that 150 millions region have no potential ball players ) will cost nothing compare to korea/japan ( also ~ 150 millions ) . 
  ( and i do n't even start to speak about more $ on german/austrian/french / english ( bobby thomson !, 
  ) / spanish players ( 350 millions + region ) . 
  capitals of those countries : kiev ( 3m ) , warsaw ( 2m ) , minsk ( 2m ) , prague ( 1.5 m ) , budapest ( 1.5 m ) , are in 2 hours flight zone . 
  and cost of club like that should be lower than single-a/double-a team . 
  do n't lose your streak ( even smallest ) with/because shit like that . 
  not native speaker . 
  21 yo fan from central europe looks for npb 's team to root . 
  - team ~ ~ should ~ ~ must be in pitcher-hitting league ( central ), 
  - not the richest one , but not tottaly poor, 
  - with rich history and in active rivalry, 
  - championship in recent 5 years would be advantage, 
  - iconic/funny/charismatic players are ** big ** advantage, 
  - nice ballpark also, 
  my mlb 's most favourite team are sf giants . 
  edit : ** what was **, 
  [ on of the luckiest for giants ] ( http://m.mlb.com/video/topic/0/v12924649/ws-2010-gm-2-kinsler-doubles-off-the-top-of-the-wall ), 
  21yo who discovered nofap last december . 
  i 'm 1.74 m 72kg ( 5 ' 9 '' 160lbs ) male without sexual experience ( if we did n't count, 
  handjob i gave to some random girl at age 17-18 ) . 
  6.5 in 1-10 scale ( up to 7-7 .5 if i 'm wearing some cool clothes , possible to make it stable with good body form/shape ) . 
  failed at college twice , due to my lack of energy for study/doing something beside lurking web/play stupid * fuckin ' * video games all the time . 
  only positive thing in my life was ( and still is ) my baseball team where i play for last 3 years . 
  going there kept me in shape ( not in the best one , but it is better than sitting at home and eat junk food or drink alcohol ) , provide some socializing and built some will-power to stay up earlier on training days and go to field , which i 'm grateful for . 
  i gave nofap try to make my life better , and maybe gain some self-confidende with gurlz ( which is secondary goal ) . 
  since then my longest streak was 12 days , i started to do push-ups , do some jogging , live a life . 
  it was the best time ( and longest time without masturbation ) since i started fapping to porn ( at age 11-12 ) . 
  i did not hit a gym , but i do plan to . 
  peak started at day 7th and ended at day 10th , when i had * dry * wet-dream , had an ( partial ) orgasm and cummed only in dream ( not in reality , my bedding , and boxers were clean ) and then flatline hitted me hard and i gave up 2 days later . 
  since then i could n't make it longer than 3-5 days ( for like 2 months ) . 
  on 13th march ( 3 months before my bday in june ) decided to make it at least double digits and could n't make it when finish line was over the horizon ... 
  was bored , played the newest fallout dlc , seen some titties at web and started to edge , did n't relapsed but edged 'till precum oozed , went immediately under cold shower to stop urge , which ( thankfully ) happend . 
  now resetting my badge , and back at day 0 . 
  partly happy ( i fought with the urge and won ) and partly mad at myself to let this happend ... 
  100 days will be loooong journey , but wait for my report !, 
  i 'll deliver it sooner or later ... 
  ps : sorry for errors , english is actually my 3rd language .
