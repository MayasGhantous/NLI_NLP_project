  or just beat jon moscot to death by score many runs ( preferably in 3rd xd ) . 
  kill the commies !, 
  look at samardzija 's at coors and great american ballpark games . 
  both 7 + ip , 1er ( ? ), 
  guy is 100 % positive , and good spirit around clubhouse . 
  just mad at himself , that he ca n't help team with run or 2 . 
  had no chance . 
  add extra timmy jim !, 
  what if batter in at&t park hits ball into o.co coliseum ? 
  [ i guess not ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w6a2kvbigu ),

  #happy dogout, 
  potg : my pants for being off !, 
  / r/ootp would love ya, 
  to be honest , i started rooting for sfg in 2010 , but not for that ws , just because we 've got best guys around . 
  just watch highlight from panik 's play and hear that yell . 
  i prefer brandons ', 
  game of inches , indeed . 
  #edit :, 
  i did not noticed , but good point . 
  they are beeutiful ... 
  samard\u017eija grand slam in the air !, 
  2ks to get out of the slam . 
  nice pitching . 
  canada is in america ... 
  noodle arm . 
  3rd run was from hr , so wtf ? 
  can we play 162 games with braves ? 
  mlb.tv is like 60 $ now . 
  you can watch archive games also , not live only . 
  peavy pitches in game 3 , so no . 
  he did nothing to boston , why ? 
  you wish . 
  just lurk how to get 50 % off . 
  it 's somewhere on this sub . 
  i remember one strike for madbum against mets last week . 
  saved our asses . 
  just kick him out in 5th , then maybe we 'll win . 
  first overall . 
  how many times he got caught ? 
  i 'm looking for instrumental version , but thanks . 
  with first 3 starters like madbum , kkkkkkueto and samard\u017eija , we just need 4th and 5th to be just under 5 era , that 's all . 
  and that 's perfect game !, 
  all hail `` man-mountain '' jeff samard\u017eija !, 
  and big time timmy jim too !, 
  [ there is bosnian soccer player named like that , so i guess ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zoran_samard%c5%beija ), 
  and how many wear only one ? 
  even with k it was good long ab, 
  that posey 's face xddd, 
  you ca n't hit 4 times every day ... 
  kuip says he returned to strike that hand with 5 . 
  5 % for no gloves and 35 % for one ?
