  [ obp 1.000 ] ( https://youtu.be/xl_monvojem?t=28s ), 
  baseball ... you could watch it for 40 years and still learn . 
  [ my thoughts about today 's strike zone ] ( https://youtu.be/f6cmqutpn08?t=15s ), 
  double play !, 
  ** now !, 
  got him !, 
  gold glover for me !, 
  and call stands !, 
  i just empty laughted . 
  if not today 's odor vs bautista fight , our ending would be play of the day . 
  safe . 
  out . 
  ** out . 
  out . 
  out . 
  out . 
  game end . 
  pants of the game : my pants for not being shitted with those umps !, 
  pitchers ' duel i guess . 
  nl west is so weirdo this year ... 
  panik to crawford , even at your shoots . 
  103 mib ? 
  was n't this call protested ? 
  thanks for this win cards !, 
  i hope we 'll repay in our games with cubs this week . 
  that drunk driver ? 
  what ? 
  no-hitter throught 8 !, 
  c'mon they 're ** padres ** at last ... 
  los angeles of anaheim of california of united states ? 
  it is okay for madbum 's arm to go 8 + ip 105 + pitches every start ? 
  i guess punch in the face ? 
  this is why dhing is bad . 
  ^ fuck ^ the ^ dh, 
  fuck you random minor league guy for break hunter pence hand and break his record ... 
  hunter pence and ` transformer ' arm ... 
  why duffy with avg . 
  like .230 is still batting third ? 
  with peavy on mound it will be for cubs , for sure ... 
  but ( t ) !, 
  we hit very good vs. good pitchers , and terribly bad vs. average ones ... who knows ? 
  just kidding ... ( sort of ) . 
  splooooosh hit number ** hot ** 69 !, 
  i will cry with all my tears if we won 2 of 3 this weekend . 
  and no , no pokemon cards ... 
  madbum broke ws record ( s ) in this game !, 
  if he 's into it , show him some perfect games ( like cain 's on 13th june 2012 ) . 
  then storm through postseason , or not storm but win it all when losing 0-3 in world series , in game 7 . 
  giants are only nl west team with winning season so far . 
  did you sat in cubs ' fans part of at&t  ? 
  we knew it 's lost on peavy 's first pitch . 
  fox announcers ... 
  wtf ? 
  1/2th road, 
  why splash hit counter shows 68 hits ? 
  4:33 here on east . 
  damn uk time ... 
  after giving us whole series , you now beat doyers ? 
  can you be any cooler ? 
  just sweep them and lose next series in sf , okey ? 
  if madbum , kkkkkueto and samard\u017eija won their games , we are over .600 !, 
  damn you peavy !, 
  but in those 3 we won it all once !, 
  i did it twice in mlb 2k12 !, 
  just add , ** the real giants **, 
  [ this is the best hunter 's photo ** ever ** ] ( http://www.philliedelphia.com/.a/6a01348829760c970c0167644d0744970b-800wi ), 
  [ i just spend ca . 
  hour to look for that save ] ( http://s32.postimg.org/gp07lwfsl/waterloo.png ), 
  so far i know , double negative sentences are correct only in polish . 
  til . 
  was there awards voting in 1994 ? 
  pence 's is a fake . 
  i guess is about small sample size . 
  if he had to bat 3-4 times every other day i guess he 'd be like .250 +, 
  edit : was n't he like 1 for 2 and a walk on pinch hitting last year ? 
  those 3 k 's are for stri ** k ** es , 
  til, 
  i throw faster than major league pitcher !, 
  also , 7 + means he went full 7 and allowed baserunners in 8th with no outs . 
  i just went for 5 hours drinks , came back , it 's 4am , and this game is n't even started yet . 
  i fookin hate those evening west coast games while live in europe ... 
  it 's all for you buddy !, 
  it 's beautiful ... 
  i hate you kershaw !, 
  cueto and pomeranz just did it also . 
  baseball is funny game ... 
  when was the last time when ny giants , ny yankees and brooklyn doyers won by score 1-0 in same day ? 
  and panda !, 
  just to be sure, 
   she was liberated from a concentration camps ( she does n't remember the name ) in either germany or poland . 
  there was no contentration camp in poland . 
  all of them were german ones . 
  [ really ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/complete_game ), 
   in baseball , a complete game is the act of a pitcher pitching an entire game without the benefit of a relief pitcher . 
  last year we had no pitchers , this year no bats at all . 
  funny game baseball is . 
  where is mah timmey ? 
  and of course for peavy 's day . 
  damn ...
