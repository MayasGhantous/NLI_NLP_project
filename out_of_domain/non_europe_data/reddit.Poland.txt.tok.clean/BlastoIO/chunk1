  shameless permalink to my earlier encounter . 
  +1 on the extremely scary . 
  i had it happen in the city , so it had the modern era overpowered zombie feel as opposed to your children of the corn encounter . 
  good times . 
  fun note ... there was a guy locked in the bathroom of that gas station ... 
  i could n't stop laughing . 
  that encounter ended after i locked about 20-30 in a bedroom in a house , about 20 minutes away ... 
  i feel bad for the next looter ... 
  i spent the past 2 days turning into a hill man . 
  one thing i quickly noticed is that people rarely ever venture that high up . 
  therefore , those places are loaded with zombies holding player loot . 
  with each zombie dropping more than i could carry in one shot to begin with , it gets really rough having a group of five time at you and each drop that much . 
  ca n't wait until i can retreat back from the great above and suffer those first world problems . 
  fun and simple game play , love it !, 
  some feedback :, 
  - add a simple `` tap to jump '' pop up somewhere to let the player know how the game works when they first get into the game . 
  - adding even the simplest of [ color ] ( http://imgur.com/i0jyxr6 ) goes a long way . 
  - i really like the simple art style . 
  clean and retro . 
  - since this is a game where you need to see what is ahead of you , try putting the game in landscape . 
  it will not only let the player see further ahead , but also help you get rid of all the empty screen estate . 
  if you 're looking for someone to chat with / bounce ideas off of , shoot me a message and i 'll throw you my hangouts . 
  great work and looking forward to your future creations !, 
  one issue we noticed with the dev console is that if you 're logged into more than one google account on a browser , you 're going to have a bad time . 
  tell them to make sure they are all on incognito / privacy mode on their browser . 
  it gets pretty annoying telling that to each of your testers so i 'd suggest you make an faq / walk-through page like many devs out there do . 
  for reference , our builds usually take between 2 and 6 hours to go live in the store . 
  6 hours is during peak time on friday / saturday nights . 
  you know , i actually had the same exact issue on our first app . 
  all this time i thought i derped ... 
  have them visit it from a browser . 
  i 've tried just about everything out there and limelight has been my favorite / the one that works the best . 
  we just posted our game to prod with a new apk about four hours ago , no issues on our end . 
  ah , we 're not using obb files . 
  sorry to hear that 's happening to y' all . 
  i would start with that good ole `` i wonder if it works on this browser ... '' approach . 
  if that does n't work , start double checking that everything meets the guidelines set by google ( http://goo.gl/vlznja ), 
  just as a friendly reminder , make sure you 're only logged into google with one account . 
  a lot of google siblings do n't play well with others . 
  hey there , sputdev !, 
  it is indeed very helpful , thank you for bringing it up . 
  i was just reading in another thread yesterday about some nexus 6 's having issues with unity 5 . 
  this is an issue which some people see improvements on when vsync is set to `` every v blank '' , which all of our builds are set to . 
  i have a new build i am getting ready to upload which enables full android tv support , updated version of the plugin we use for google play game services , and a good amount of optimizations we made in the past 24 hours . 
  would you mind reaching out to me on g + so i could send you that build over to test out real quick ? 
  i 'll send you a message with my profile . 
  hey there ,, 
  would you mind elaborating a bit further ? 
  thanks !, 
  which difficulties did you try it on ? 
  also , what device were you using ? 
  helicopter game ( think back ~ 15 years ) and flappy bird-styled games were the type of mechanics we were looking for . 
  we 're working on going in our own direction and trying to get away from the meta that these games have had for years and years . 
  we have almost 30 android devices to test out what we 're working on . 
  with that said i agree with you on the speed increase being inconsistent . 
  we noticed this pretty early on with different builds of unity having a different effect on different devices ( no patterns ) . 
  i personally feel that the tweaking on easy and medium is pretty solid and i 'm happy with it . 
  hard seems to have a hit or miss in that area right now , and insane is a bit over insane . 
  the root cause of this inconsistency issue actually comes from one of the plugins we were using for google play services . 
  which it is a great plugin , the frame rate has quite a crazy random spike to it right now . 
  this is something that will be fixed within the next couple of days . 
  we have been working hard to get that kink fixed up and we 're at the home stretch right now ( from our countless tests ) . 
  anyway , really appreciate your feedback and your time , very helpful indeed . 
  thanks !, 
  hey ,, 
  which device are you using ? 
  ( just for reference ), 
  the plugin we were using for googleplaygameservices had a lot of clunk on top of it , so we have switched to what has so far been an amazing suite with great documentation ( [ this man makes magic ] ( https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/publisher/2256 ) ) . 
  this has completely fixed the issues thus far from all of our testing , and the build will be out within the next couple of days . 
  overall , you gave some great feedback . 
  i 'm working on tweaking the ad behavior as we speak , and we 'll be tweaking hard and insane to make them more playable . 
  another feature we 're toying around with is the ability for players to customize the visual end of the game when it comes to certain parts of environment / color scheme / plane model . 
  in the end , i 'm sorry you did n't get a proper experience caused by the framerate issues . 
  the new version is just around the corner so if you get a chance , please do check it out and throw some feedback our way again . 
  thank you again !, 
  for a second there , i thought you were going to tell me you had the r2d2 droid x or something ... 
  the `` lowest spec '' hardware we test on is actually the original droid x , so you should be fine . 
  after we 're done with this build , i 'll make sure to update this thread . 
  thanks again !, 
  hey sput ,, 
  i just messaged you on hangouts . 
  let 's get some logcat action going while you have each of the games running and see what the dumps say . 
  hey ,, 
  every device i have tested parts of the new build on has absolutely no stutter right now , so i 'd like to think i figured out one of the ways . 
  after all this work , i 'm fairly certain it was caused by the previous plugin we were using for google play game services . 
  specifically , i believe a large cause for the issue was the proxy not being made to handle as much as was being thrown at it . 
  how did you fix your issue ? 
  on a semi-related note , i also fixed a rendering issue that our nexus player was having . 
  if anyone who reads this has one , go put a sprite that 's over 10 megs in size , you wo n't be disappointed . 
  as for the start screen . .
