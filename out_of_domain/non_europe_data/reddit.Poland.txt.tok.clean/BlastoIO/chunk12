  so 3-5 , though maybe cooled 7-10 ? 
  one of these days alice - ** pow !, 
  ** straight to the moon !, 
  no perfect loop , no perfect comment , but yes perfect manners . 
  there is still hope !, 
  scooby , where are you ? 
  you 're not wrong . 
  do you secretly have 0 positive outlook ? 
  if you are not a father and are from 89 ( i barely made it into 88 in the last few days it existed ) , it makes me feel better that you too are going through this phase in personal humor right meow , ofcr . 
  a good belly laugh indeed , especially at a time when it was personally in need . 
  thank you . 
  * sigh * might as well make a cj out of it . 
  have an upvote !, 
  i must be in an outdated version , i only have to pay for food . 
  channel splitting is stupidly expensive on some common architecture . 
  make sure to ( obvious to ones who 've learned this ) consider target hardware before packing . 
  at 28 , i have never had to physically hand someone money so i could be allowed to poop . 
  compression and interleaving ( plus de - and re - of both ) capabilities / costs are different across everything . 
  in the android world for example , astc capable devices ( as rule of thumb ) are `` light years '' better at this doing this type of task vs others . 
  basically ( in same manner but for additional reasons ) some devices are more efficient at popping out rgb , a than r , g , b , a or rg , ba or et cetera . 
  though , you are literally able to access all in a vec4 , the way that vec4 came to be ( under the hood ) varies . 
  pfft ... glasgow ? 
  what do you take me for , a human ? 
  ( aka this way is a lot faster ), 
  that 's not how we whisper . 
  while you do n't need the integration guide ( as most i done by unity ) , all this is helpful as fuck . 
  [ enlighten doc ] ( https://developer.arm.com/docs/100837/latest/preface ), 
  if you go onto mali 's dev blog and section , you 'll find a lot of gold regarding enlighten . 
  if you 're still left waiting to learn more , nvidia 's dev center would be the next good stop . 
  finally , cornell , berkeley , and all major schools have completely public stuff available that you can learn from for the concepts everything is made on . 
  should give you a few years of `` i 'm never bored '' . 
  enjoy . 
  i 'm impressed either way . 
  a lot of people spent a very large amount of money and had a lot of people are use * environmental cleanliness * as the * bang for your buck * factor . 
  only the feinted of heits can achieve such an aetherial victory . 
  the setting of ready player one is in our planet , x subjective years in time from our subjective current present . 
  how ? 
  i believe one of the author 's cranial hemispheres function so quickly that they experienced an internal twin paradox and returned to us with news of it 's subjective present , thus our subjective future . 
  i hope you are more confused again . 
  you 're such an air head , it 's an anti-air punnon . 
  this equally warrants warren 's laugh , though with more hoarse and less maniac . 
  i appreciate your humor . 
  fellow programmers , our savior 's validity is in question . 
  you know what to do . 
  * put on top hat *, 
  today i lmaoed ... assistance required . 
  that is misleading if you interpret it literally . 
  real-time rendering is not slowed down time , unless you do a slow down time effect ( ex infamous max payne bullet time ) . 
  if you prerender a scene ( ex any movie scene with computer graphics / over the top cutscenes ) , you send out the rendering jobs ( computer tasks ) individually , by individual frame ( or more granular ) . 
  in 3d rendering , a lot of tricks are used for achieving effects , as well as approximations . 
  why ? 
  indistinguishable and most of the time , accurate enough for government work . 
  basically , as humans , we have yet to increase speed of electricity in electrically powdered devices . 
  thus , do not take that previous post too literally . 
  eli5 : the stick can be dislodged . 
  typical earwax developing booger sweat . 
  hah , i was going to say the same thing , curse you for beating me to it !, 
  you can plan around any object you have position + direction vectors for . 
  once everything gets consolidated and sits on one centralized network , it 'll be glorious . 
  it 'll just be one smoothly moving wave , with no need for traffic lights and no more pesky pedestrians . 
  the time which comes after the present is fast approaching . 
  as an anosmic and someone who read your comment ... 
  i 'm glad we 're getting more life-altering people shit fixed so soon we 'll be on my issue and i 'll be able to pinpoint where smells come from like holy shit guys i 'm missing a superpower . 
  also , congrats , i am happy for you .

  ** amends will ** * upon my own death , bring at least the gaffigan to my wake and have them attempt the dance of revival . 
  if i am to fall greatly ill but not die , bring me their foot . 
  immortality feels much closer . 
  single ? 
  are you lacking the superpower of tear-ductation ? 
  actually , it 's a gif . 
  i agree , smaller chance of death is a better choice than certain death ... as long as your limbs do n't start falling off when you sneeze ... 
  it 's called anxiety . 
  if you were me and i ( wise-blasto ) were my own inner monologue motivating myself ( anxious-blasto ) : `` stop being dumb , you gots dis ... 
  ok grandpa , pull out your gif player out from the attic and let 's huddle around to watch some gifs around a fire or three . 
  eve , at that time , was equally a beauty and a beast of human engineering . 
  tldr do n't make blocking calls and live in a single threaded environment because real life physics will get you down . 
  wan na magnetize together ?

  * wertsir.dll is compiled on x86 architecture when x64 was expected . 
  would you like to enable all semaphores for the pre-mortem lulz ? 
  to add unrealistic ( read : stupid ) dark humor , my brain chooses to believe you are an incredibly intelligent 5 year old polyglot and the pressure to succeed with your advantages was too much for your sister at this age . 
  way to teach time . 
  who in the adamic fuck is atom ? 
  you could be bored . 
  if you are , find a job in a field that stimulates you . 
  i did this . 
  that 's one of the wisest pieces of advice i have ever read . 
  thank you , i like you . 
  you spelled that wrong . 
  everybody is capable of finding a task they deem as stimulating to their own personality and put effort to getting a job which involves it after a reasonable time period . 
  every human ( unless incapable due to genetic defects or environmental damage ) is capable of making an effort to live life to what they individually deem as `` fullest '' . 
  if you 're astronaut but are stimulated by observing sea lions while bored by space , go be a marine biologist . 
  if you are an ice cream ( wo ) man but are stimulated by multitasking in a warmer and hectic environment , make your way towards working in a busy kitchen of any capacity . 
  what i mean is if you 're unhappy where you are because you 're bored , pursue what interests you in any sort of capacity . 
  if it interests you , you 'll get further while putting in less actual effort ( since it 'll be natural vs forced ) . 
  personal happiness and satisfaction is priceless in any capacity , the more the better . 
  what i ** do n't ** mean is : unhappy about your job ? 
  quit right now and become the pope by lunch . 
  that is true .
