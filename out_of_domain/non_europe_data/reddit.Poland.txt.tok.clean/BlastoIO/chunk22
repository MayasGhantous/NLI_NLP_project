  ~ ~ i 'm glad you do n't like obsessively blinking a very specific amount of times . ~ ~, 
  edit : fine , do n't enjoy my extremely cringy blink 182 reference . 
  you enjoy reading sad poetry . 
  you do n't feel like you 're the only one experiencing that feeling , thus comfort and hope . 
  i enjoy listening to dark comedy when i 'm sad . 
  i have n't watched anything by him in ages , going to have to revisit one day !, 
  in the past 7-8 years , i always turn to good ole louis ck when i 'm down and need a laugh or `` shit could be worse !, 
  nope . 
  i dare you ? 
  why are you always so angry ?!, 
  * tips hat *, 
  have you checked your bathroom for any bucket like objects , specifically made to hold these types of matter ? 
  i heard psychadelics do wonders , especially if you 're a rug . 
  i 'm too milquetoast for acceptance or honor . 
  * pushes red button * bb . 
  them wonder buckets . 
  imagine what he think ** s ** of you . 
  there 's a lot of steps to building steps . 
  first , you make a step . 
  then , multiply that by each desired step . 
  finally , you 're left with conflicts of interest and no steps . 
  oooh yeah ... what do i like ? 
  how about we nucleosynthesize that milkiness , then i can make you diffuse till we both reach albedo ? 
  i love your hats . 
  we 're not going to worry about the hedgehog being blue and addicted to stealing money ? 
  there are sonic novels ? 
  [ whoa . 
  do n't forget those at the department of sanitation . 
  they are the true professional career kleptos . 
  begin to entangle . 
  you 'd love my shoe . 
  that 's the renegotiation process . 
  do n't show all of your cards right away . 
  to be clear , i do n't think any ~ ~ one ~ ~ of us meant that docs should treat cancer with sugar pills . 
  however , if giving a sugar pill would improve something terrible , even by a notch , when used along with actual medicine ... why not ? 
  that 'd be sweet , or even splendid if you 're diabetic . 
  that 's insanic . 
  i still love your hats . 
  autocorrect ate it originally . 
  i gave it extra weight to show that time has passed and it matured outside the rest of the herd . 
  sorry it 's not an e :(, 
  he 's exceptionally phenomenal . 
  i ca n't believe no one has mentioned [ ray 's parts in arthur c. clarke 's short stories . 
  ] ( https://audible.com/pd/sci-fi-fantasy/the-collected-stories-of-arthur-c-clarke-audiobook/b01jqsan94 ) got so sucked into these . 
  i 'm shifting . 
  i hate italicans . 
  oh boy oh boy , do i have a product for you !, 
  ( sorry you have to put up with that stuff . 
  makes me sad that happens to people because that must be scary as balls . ), 
  this should be a religion . 
  breaking good . 
  you sure you 're not a cook ? 
  you sound like a cook . 
   that ** is ** an important component as well . 
  ftfy, 
  source : my life . 
  it 's a new movement . 
  hahaha . 
  thank you for your insights btw , i had no idea about any of this . 
  giv ** e ** m ** e ** a doodl ** e ** and w ** e ** can b ** e ** gin th ** e ** talk ** s ** . 
  my experience is that i believe , and have always been told , i have always been more open minded and accepting than most of my friends . 
  most of my friends know one culture and anyone who ever pick on me growing up was only from one culture . 
  the ones who have been more than i always have a story of abuse or death of parent ( s ) . 
  i have amazing parents who believe in positive reinforcement and love , so that 's what i 've been taught . 
  at 28 , i have yet to meet another person ( rl ) who said that about both of their parents . 
  i used to work in one of the most diverse companies in the world and got to travel around much of the globe . 
  it was amazing to see the cultural differences . 
  i was born in europe and live in the us . 
  when in europe , i felt safe and at home with people who had similar values . 
  in south america , people were so incredibly friendly . 
  asian ( not russians ) are selfless towards family and very accepting of others . 
  australians are europeans with more south american love . 
  in the us , it 's a mix , but many more ( than in other ) are aggressively/unhealthily competitive . 
  what fascinates me is people 's tolerance to change . 
  my friends son was genetically born as a female but is mentally a male . 
  many people i know classify transgender as `` a temporary phase inspired by social media '' , but i view it as an awesome step forward in humanity . 
  if i were a 0 stuck in a 1 or vice versa ( or halfway or neither ? ), 
  and it did n't fit me , i think i would be extremely unhappy if i could n't change that because my body was n't mine . 
  as a huge scifi fan , hooray for bodies finally being viewed as vessels !, 
  next step is immortality . 
  then again , i 'm just one person and there 's billions of us , each with varying experiences and views ... so take this as you will . 
  this is life , and life is n't a steven seagal movie !, 
  educated , 21st century version . 
  what a time to be alive !, 
  are you saying bunnies ca n't love dipping dots ? 
  the modernized version of `` the world is an oyster '' . 
  * depants self * one of us !, 
  one of us !, 
  if nobody pays for it , it 's * essentially * banned !, 
  you lost me after all those sakes . 
  lik ** e ** this ? 
  traumatically adorable . 
  that 'd be a perfectly humorous and literal name . 
  who the devil are you ? 
  to expand , it does n't glow on that side because the jovians that inhabit that side of the moon , or luna , ( as luna has a synchronous orbit ) are incapable of digesting this amount of radiation ... and the earth is the center of the universe . 
  soul train ? 
  troll train !, 
  i once changed the outlook auto correct when sending on a friend 's comp . 
  to be frank , let 's call him frank . 
  each time he typed * i * , it would be corrected to * i , the frank of all franks , * .
