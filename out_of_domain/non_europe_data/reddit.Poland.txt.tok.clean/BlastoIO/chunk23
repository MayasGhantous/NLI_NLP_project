  took him a year to notice . 
  in that time , he was very confused by conversations , and he got a promotion for always speaking his mind , being clear when disagreeing , and is now a leader in his job . 
  ... and our planet , earth , is clearly everywhere . 
  thus , copernicus was wrong , scienced . 
  they do if they have a springy individual rolled up in them . 
  sorry for stalking your post history , but judging by the quality of your voice acting , you come off as someone who loves he hell out of what they do and they do everything as best they can ... and that suspicion is now pleasantly confirmed . 
  thus , if you do n't mind ... four questions !, 
  - what do you often criticize about your own work ? 
  ( could be past tense . ), 
  - what/who are your inspirations ? 
  - when we invent a teleportation method for any form of rays , do you agree that you should get all the credit ? 
  - which performance of yours are you most proud of ? 
  if you do mind , i apologise for taking up your time , kind sir . 
  * tips hat *, 
  she does n't , it 's a deere . 
  not with that attitude !, 
  it 's clearly a delphinidaesapian . 
  has anyone ever told you that you have exquisite taters for you age ? 
  explains the mast . 
  that 's less than 2 gpu cards and 2 nvmes . 
  sit the core down with your questions , we need more lanes !, 
  i 'm a sucker for glassy illumination . 
  nice work !, 
  do n't worry , there 's plenty more pixels in the screen . 
  i think everyone is going to critique this too negatively until you add some type of hair . 
  ex : the lack of eyebrows magnifies the size of forehead . 
  that 's user ( design ) error , not a limitation of the technology . 
  your fallback ( the way in which you do n't waste resources ) is to define your own bboxes/bspheres , which will work better , but you have to put it the effort and time . 
  so , his smile is actually a frown ? 
  that next year 's ? 
  confirmed .

  i was wondering when i would finally use this button . 
  you make me sickle . 
  it seems that the bieber has finally become a belieber . 
  so that 's a yes to the rubber gloves i take it . 
  said no one ever . 
  sport : give everyone office chairs and a make a tiny race track . 
  losers get thrown out with parachutes , over water , and have to complete some other objective . 
  2 sports in one . 
  risk management : fly only in neutral unowned airspace ( as aircraft is not made to go above 60k ) . 
  anosmic here . 
  i wish i could . 
  was there , not laughing . 
  please advise . 
  this is the perfect answer . 
  why is it sunning outside ? 
  that 's the origin story , have to setup a widely accepted intellectual property first though . 
  why ... do you like it ? 
  wucha contemplating , boy ? 
  i 'm sorry young man , i thought this was the way to the bingo . 
  why not ? 
  the one that created its own language is off . 
  the current is only beginning to learn writing articles . 
  hell , now that i think about it , it 's probably using our very reations on this thread as its own training data . 
  ** game over , man !, 
  welcome to urf !, 
  * disclaimer : do n't eat the turf . 
  anosmic he ... oh ... not for me . 
  welp , this will be therapeutic . 
  time to start clacking away on the ole mechanical qwerty . 
  * let 's make off like 2 anosmics and go feel our mouths . 
  not hearing from them probably means they 're back to living a normal life again . 
  we are mythical creatures , yippee . 
  if they died from finally going outside and enjoying life , by way of a random freaks accident that could never happen if they did n't go out ( thus not having an operation ) , what would the coroner 's report say ? 
  my face is currently in the midst of exploding from pressure . 
  both of my nostrils are bit under 1cm from giving birth to a herd of healthy and juicy polyps for the world to see . 
  i can now see them in the mirror . 
  my tinnitus has turned into what i can only describe as the paranasal orchestra . 
  on the bright side , at least my nasal drip has turned into a steady stream so i 'm no longer coughing . 
  silly human , you do n't need me , you have google !, 
  as this is essentially anosmics anonymous , how long has it been since your last stiff ? 
  this is why we have the digital world . 
  there 's absolutely no way that something can suddenly happen to you on the inte, 
  time is subjective , which means gravity is just a figment of my imagination for i think therefore i gravitate , thus no as e ! = mc ^ 2 in the future but rather me = 2c because of the twin carbon paradox ( the twin carbon futures , which is me , but i is not found in me ) . 
  you see ? 
  scienced . 
  * lead : * * ... and be a storm . . light ... hero *,
