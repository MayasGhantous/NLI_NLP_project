  ... 4 deep ? 
  was it funky ? 
  follow me to the \u1555 ( \u141b ) \u1557 answer station !, 
  jim and jerry did this . 
  * intensifies instrumentals *, 
  * funks *, 
  hold m ** e ** . 
   he 'll probably just piss his ** pamps ** , like a little baby, 
  ftfy , bb . 
  confirmed . 
  though , it should n't be like this , so let 's change it . 
  \u0298 \u203f \u0298, 
  the king is just picking through boxes farming marshmallows all day . 
  whomp whomp whomp ... 
  how exoteric of you to say ... 
  penguins ca n't argue . 
  voice control . 
  king beats emperor . 
  penguistics . 
  spitballing . . have you considered having your tattoo artist ( or anyone pencil-capable ) help you come up with a slightly modified , or even hybrid , insignia ? 
  genetic engineering . 
  how about two ? 
  currently , i am capable of replacing you with a teletubby . 
  what more do you want ? 
  i 'd be lion if i told you that the pause button is not a turbo toggle . 
  always listen to what your body tells you . 
  low budget so we 're going with body munchers . 
  not just any chankles , ankliken chankles . 
  * and laminate teh nite awayyyyyy *, 
  but the kid in the story has all his digits !, 
  chisel vs clay , for pre-b & w. 
  the sharks were canadian .

  software engineer here . 
  for fun , i started modeling and throw stuff into my vr because some trigger my phantom smells . 
  super cool after not being able to smell for 15 years . 
  sadly , my nasal polyps are currently exploding my face . 
  according to last week 's ct , my sinuses are completely clogged . 
  i could fit half a penny somewhere in my sinuses behind my left eye . 
  i ca n't sleep right now because if i turn , my nose starts juicing . 
  i ca n't blow my nose because it 's fully clogged . 
  if i do try , my ears get clogged and everything spins like crazy . 
  pain and double vision are keeping me from sitting , and i start coughing when i lie down . 
  any light is almost too bright to be near . 
  i hear a full sized orchestra in my head from the pressure . 
  can barely even wear headphones for any amount of time at this point . 
  talking causes pressure . 
  coughing causes me to want to sneeze , which causes more pressure and pain , so i force myself not to as long as possible . 
  wo n't even get started on breathing . 
  i 'm allergic to everything environmental panels check . 
  now , i ca n't even take any antihistamines for the next week . 
  my entire body is itchy , especially my face . 
  unfortunately , it hurts to touch . 
  thankfully , my coughing attacks mimic scratching in some places . 
  but my ear drums are itchy . 
  this happens every 5 years . 
  after 1 good year , filled with exercise and weight loss , i rapidly decline for 4 . 
  but it 's not a death sentence . 
  so many ~ ~ people ~ ~ organisms have / had it worse than i. 
  so many never even got that chance . 
  to further romanticize ... 
  i live , i feel , and will always rather feel something than nothing at all . 
  so , i 'm left wondering ... have you considered a new hobby ? 
  here are some ideas :, 
  * / r/rtlsdr caught my attention a few weeks back . 
  * 3d modeling makes you a virtual deity . 
  / r/blender is nice . 
  * game engines allow you to 4d . 
  / r/unity3d is the spot . 
  * xr and windows , fellow insider . 
  * radiosity rocks . 
  * gpgpu programming will make you an asset , and cuda 9 rc just dropped . 
  * machine learning is fun . 
  / r/machinelearning, 
  * python 3.7 is due out soon . 
  * nosql is best sql . 
  * semaphores are sexy . 
  * wikipedia is wonderful . 
  * archives.org ~ ~ is ~ ~ has everything human . 
  * space is ** omg omg omg ** . 
  / r/space, 
  * space agencies keep so much stuff public , even code . 
  if you seek escapism , find a good book instead of trying to drown your sorrows away . 
  embrace it when you feel it . 
  what you feel has been felt by billions before you . 
  what you 're feeling now will let you get so sucked into any good story . 
  even better ... 
  audio books allow you to get lost while programming . 
  / r/books is a thing . 
  without bad times , we 'd miss out on all the good , fellow bipedaling baboon . 
  mouth feels , not textures . 
  \u0298 \u203f \u0298, 
  he 's a doctor , not an escalator . 
  lol your intentions are from a good place . 
  your tldr : do n't drink your sorrows away . 
  peppy puppo pupdates . 
  it rains outside when i shutdown . 
  it gets labeled under a ton of things from what i noticed recently . 
  medical term seems to be * phantosmia * . 
  [ studies .
