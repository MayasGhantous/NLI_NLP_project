  why do you ask ? 
  i believe i 've seen claims of 30-32 with 1070s . 
  which miner are you using ? 
  which flavor of linux are you on ? 
  what 's new zealand 's new zealand ? 
  and you quickly keel over . 
  way to derp . 
  somebody was overpowered . 
  old zealand ? 
  the limit is your imagination . 
  just got my steroids , starting in a few days . 
  6 day dose ... tapering off by one each day . 
  i do believe they are talking about the superstitious yolo metric . 
  maybe we should try asking r/askouija while we 're at it ?

  i 'll know for sure in a few days . 
  i 'm allergic to all indoor triggers , but not any other pollen or food . 
  how about you ? 
  congratulations on the marriage !, 
  how 's the lip ? 
  no crypto for you !, 
  are you excited or does your password end with an exclamation ? 
  also , is the capital `` p '' a victim of mobile autocorrect or by design ?

  might want to see a doctor about fixing the whole `` low appetite and pain '' issue before jumping to the `` management '' stage by yourself . 
  your hankie is your cape . 
  oh man , it 's was fascinating . 
  i was testing my vital signs every couple of hours . 
  first day i was sentimental , the rest i felt spectacular 90 percent of the time . 
  my temperature was a roller coaster though . 
  i had my surgery this morning . 
  when i woke up , felt incredibly light headed , dizzy a few times , and my bp dropped by 60 points . 
  after i got home , i had a ~ 5 second burp and felt better . 
  then i started to force myself to burp 4 more times and now feel like a billion bux . 
  the procedure lasted around 2h30m ( 150 minutes ) . 
  mild pain lasted approximately 15 minutes , now i 'm just relaxing . 
  i finally feel like me again . 
  how full are your cavities ? 
  any interesting observations ? 
  excited ? 
  since your desperate ... have you tried any `` off brand '' cetirizine ? 
  zyrtec makes me feel like crap , but i can tolerate cvs and costco brand without a problem . 
  have you had any blood tests completed ? 
  when was the last time you had prick tests ? 
  our bodies change . 
  do you have any other illnesses ? 
  have you considered getting a second opinion from another allergist ? 
  crappiest feeling was when i became completely clogged in both and all draining stopped , but the pressure kept building . 
  my o2 saturation went from 95 % to 100 % . 
  feels so good to be fixed . 
  ca n't wait for you to join the party , kind stranger . 
  look forward to an update from you next week !, 
  pseudoephedrine is a stimulant , so it does that . 
  does allergy medicine make you drowsy ? 
  ianad , but if so , have you tried taking it ( allegra-d ) in the morning ? 
  have you tried using a saline nasal flush ? 
  if you 're dripping , it could help you get rid of the crap by flushing it out rather than dripping . 
  do you have more symptoms in certain places than others ? 
  after certain activities ? 
  do you have any pets ? 
  have you tried changing your detergent or soap ? 
  if you think getting a second opinion would help , go to one !, 
  thanks to my ent , i now have a phenomenal allergist . 
  what issue are you dealing with now , you illustrious quadruped ? 
  did you find a new hobby ? 
  the motor is you .

  if you really want to put your mind at more ease and be as near as possible to 100 % that nothing is wrong , always talk to your doc . 
  they are there to help you . 
  they are a giant walking book of knowledge , specializing in bipedal baboons . 
  with the power of linux and python ( personal preference ) , you can do anything . 
  i created a similar sounding dynamically scaling setup with normal pcs and vms a few times in the past . 
  give more details to your end goal and i can try to give suggestions . 
  i see , intriguing . 
  this type of project is on my todo as well . 
  will you be using any sort of a dedicated router , or are you wanting to strictly use pis and nothing else ? 
  for example , i have a jetson tx1 i was planning to use as a `` home base '' for my use case , and have that connect to a jump server to a parallel task distributor . 
  i 'm going to spit ball a few ideas tomorrow and get back to you .
