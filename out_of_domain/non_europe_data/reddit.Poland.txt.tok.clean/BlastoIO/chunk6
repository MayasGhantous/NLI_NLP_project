  this is also assuming op is not leaking memory gc ca n't handle but is also not utilizing pagination and has locally defined constant content . 
  final assumption is that were not using any account system / user targeted data because i ( proverbially and literally ) ca n't decipher if i 'd be climbing too many trees in one thread ( unless anyone is interested ) . 
  without digressing further , v0 .1 -  v1 .0 . 
  current feature set :, 
  - animation . 
  reasonable minimum viable product ( mvp ) feature set :, 
  - animation . 
  - data block parsing ( description , thumbnail , title ), 
  - error handling ( wo n't get into that unless anyone in interested ), 
  - layout variation ( grid , horizontal , vertical ), 
  - pagination ( cpu cycles matter , specifically when running on main thread or single threaded , even more so if not using state of the art processors or limited resources ), 
  due to my previous experience , i group this up more logically/pseudo-code rather than individual task . 
  if this were an actual planning stage , there be a plethora of tasks we 'd come up with before tidying up the definition of said mvp .

  finally , i wanted to reiterate , this is not all but some . 
  while one can argue i 'm subjected to say this is more objective than subjective , no one can deny the fact that this is all academic . 
  if anyone is interested , i 'll be more thorough . 
  sharing this is soothing/therapeutic for me as i believe it is for op to post about their feat , and i hope it may be equally encouraging/enlightening for some to keep at it and never ever ** ever ** stop learning .

  hah i just realized my bias to negatively perceive `` mastermind '' in english , but positively in my native tongue . 
  since i was first exposed to the english word in the news and cartoons , i always associate mastermind with criminal mastermind . 
  in my native tongue though , i 've only seen it used to praise . 
  with that said , i find it disturbingly humorous when you say mastermind is fun and positive because ... well ... the joker ... what a fun and positive guy he would be if he were real .

  $ 250,000.00 ( usd ) for baby formula in 5 months is not an exaggeration ? 
  while i do not have children , here are the possible scenarios ( post finding average price for baby formula ) that come up in my head if you really are paying that much :, 
  - ~ ~ feeding your children ambrosia grade formula . ~ ~, 
  - ~ ~ overfeeding your children . ~ ~, 
  - ~ ~ overpaying for said formula . ~ ~, 
  - ~ ~ you very heavily stocked up for more than a couple of years . ~ ~, 
  - your kids may not be human . 
  - i could be missing something . 
  edit : narrowed down likely scenarios . 
  since my knowledge in babyism is almost non existent , it actually crossed my mind that might not be a joke somehow lol, 
  also , i do n't mean for this to sound like i do n't think children are expensive but that number just did n't compute in my head xd, 
  kind of digressing here but ... in my opinion , sacred implies possession . 
  rant : from what we know , no one own the moon ... but we also know so little about space ( ... which no one can logically argue ) that for all we know , something somewhere owns it and we just have n't met it yet or it 's in another dimension we ca n't see because of our own ignorance . 
  point being ... 
  i refuse to logically concieve how a sane minded person could ever be so arrogant that they could imply any sort of possession over or right to possession over the moon that rotates the planet we live on . 
  ( if they were a cat , i 'd accept this line of thinking . ), 
  ultimately this is humorous on its own because i just got so worked up over what i interpret as someone saying they have more right than i do when it comes to decide the future of a rock . 
  brb reevaluating priorities .

  either way , as shown by my lack of babisctic knowledge , this is not my fight and i thank you for tagging in to help . 
  while you are using the same logic as i would , there are too many unknowns for me to continue making assumptions with any confidence . 
  til what succinct means because of you . 
  thank you , kind stranger . 
  edit : to whoever downvoted me , why does it upset you that i succinctly show my gratitude ? 
  this photo clearly falls into my personal list of the most emotionally beautiful pieces i have ever seen . 
  essentially , a picture that defines the saying `` a picture is worth a thousand words '' . 
  anything that makes me feel this many simultaneous emotions is , to me , a masterpiece / true definition of art . 
  thank you for sharing this picture from [ source ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/68op3q/photo_from_1st_may_nationalist_protest_in_brno/ ) , op . 
  thank you to others for pointing out source . 
  being an extremely analytical yet inept in showing deep personal emotions , the only way i know how to show them is as follows :, 
  - girl scout ( girl ), 
  - the expression of disgust / worry on girls face . 
  - the expression of arrogance and ignorance on nn males face . 
  - nn body language makes it seem as if he can not comprehend how someone can not understand how someone can protest against something so obvious and simple to him . 
  - previous statement is only strengthened by this being a young girl scout who shows nns ignorance because if a young girl can understand and be so accepting , why ca n't a grown man ? 
  - she is by herself and seemingly terrified but not letting that get in the way of something so believes , meanwhile nn is with hundreds of his buddies , who have caused an armed riot squad to show up , and yet he is clearly distressed the most by the fact there is a young girl with a poster . 
  - the soap bubbles adding to the `` everyone believes this is such a complicated issue yet it 's so simple a young girl scout , who excels in selling cookies , gets it '', 
  - the automatic rifle in between them is something symbolic but i can not logically put it into words right now . 
  - the male dressed in full tactical gear while there is a female behind him , seemingly smiling . 
  - another camera man on the left side seems even more interested in something past this , to the right , out of the picture . 
  - the young girl is so confident yet the male shows his lack of by wearing sunglasses the covering his face . 
  - the nn showing how his buddies do n't have to wear a uniform yet girl shows how much of a message her uniform sends , because even if she is alone , she is not alone . 
  essentially showing the strength of a military array ( as in french chic / polish szyk ) . 
  ( sorry for lack of organization ... picture emotion feels too stronk ), 
  edit : posting in source thread . 
  thank you for sharing , op . 
  both of you are hilarious and have made my day xd, 
  i , too , am annoyed by this in this specific instance . 
  realistically , it all depends on your subjective definition of `` fake '' and what-have-you . 
  it 's difficult to begin to give something along the lines of an objective answer to a highly subjective question . 
  also , what do you imagine by `` ai '' code ? 
  i * think * you mean a working product , but you could as easily be asking about theoretical psuedo-code , which result in two completely different answers . 
  having organized my thoughts ... do you mean a fully working product that will objectively answer ( with flawless precision , out of the box ) all subjective questions ? 
  ( an example of this in popular culture is `` 42 '' being the answer to life , the universe , and everything ...

  digressing caused by realization , so many lessons from the hitchhikers series are pragmatic and one of the influences which led me down my career path , hah . 
  give some examples as to which you are referring to . 
  out of genuine curiosity ... is there a condition where someone with the proper limb count ( all perfectly medically healthy ) has an abnormally intense desire to increase said limb count ? 
  this looks like a startup hothware company photo . 
  ^ ftfy, 
  this is actually a common misconception . 
  sadly , it 's down right now but here 's a cached excerpt from yodapeia :, 
  hothware ( disambiguation , redirected from palpatines paradox ), 
  shortly after their rollicking ipo , the company suffered bad press after one of their executives was charged with animal abuse when found unconscious and intoxicated in a slaughtered company tauntaun . 
  in court , defense claimed `` that was the last place [ mr. skywalker ] came before going out and losing [ his shiny ] keys '' .
