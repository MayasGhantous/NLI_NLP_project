  if you do n't mind , i would love to hear your thoughts on these . 
  i never seriously considered that `` direct mail orthodontic treatment '' was an actual `` common '' thing that existed outside of fictional humor because i can not see the pro/cons list ending up with more good than harm , unless your goal is harm . 
  thus , i am equally curious to hear about the logic you 've heard to justify said use . 
  disclaimer : my knowledge of the human body is non-existent in comparison to yours . 
  i will not be offended if you include the addition of eli5 terms at your convenience . 
  with that much work , i hope he gave you a complementary top off for your blinker fluid . 
  * ironically , the actual use of the system resembled its name , which had been intended to be spurious . 
  i do n't think this makes a difference to your argument of it not making a huge difference , but it did make me chuckle . 
  lacks populous in it 's botanical boneyard . 
  being a software engineer who has a good amount of practical experience with applying machine learning models to assist with decisions , i feel drawn by your comment . 
  my assumption is that your current knowledge about machine learning is somewhat based around reading a few articles about tasks where it is applied to assist people with tasks . 
  the reason i 'm interested is because it will help me provide a better explanation and your opinion is essentially a `` fresh pair of eyes '' on a problem so you will see it differently than someone set in their ways . 
  to do this , i need you to pretend that you are an anal fingerprint analyst who is about to go on his well earned vacation . 
  sadly , your colleague had a family emergency and is mia for the next month , but a temp agency is sending someone to do your job while you 're gone . 
  you , being the anal analyst that you are , are convinced this person will be incapable of analyzing to your skills , so you create a step by step walkthrough guide in the art of anally analyzing a fingerprint . 
  * waits for walkthrough *, 
  then no answer for you . 
  needing to double check own logic with you smarter people . 
  ether is air/oxygen , right ? 
  ether also was believed to be the magical / only way people decided they could comprehend the medium em travels through , but then we started to use in medicine once we started to study it ... 
  right ? 
  that 's where i always believed that saying stems from , am i mistaken ? 
  obligatorily , i 'm ether wrong or right ... 
  to make sure you were n't full of air ( giggle ) , i decided to engage wikipedia-fu . 
  turns out i was not wrong and i was right . 
  but , because of you , i will always ( unless we are both wrong ) be right and right about this . 
  i appreciate you , stranger . 
  edit : still looking for origins ( and citations of ) for that saying . 
  you are possibly anti-bipedalist . 
  i 'm going to take this to another world and say it 's only cheating if she 's under the same stratosphere . 
  how arrogant/possessive of you to even momentarily consider it being okay to say an entire country belongs to you . 
  god , my species is so ignorant . 
  edit : i 'm making a bad joke . 
  please do n't hate me d :, 
  jake 's craziness is contagious . 
  quick , put this bag on your head so you do n't catch it . 
  mesians are genetically superior in every way . 
  an unrelated joke i made got an ~ ~ update ~ ~ upvote in a different thread , which gave me false confidence to make another , but then i got anxious since i did not want to actually offend the person in any way by myself sucking at words . 
  thus , here we are , and i would say the usage of lul would be justified and appropriate . 
  i hope that answers your question and can we pretend to forget this ever happened ? 
  that 's irrefruitable . 
  turns out we each have our own set of problems , just like on earth . 
  but in space , the burden of bearing a large individual variability to muscle and bone loss is sexless . 
  since you said you 're a junior to the programming world , i figured this might blow your mind as it blew mine when i was but a fresh nub : switches . 
  pros ~ ~ whet ~ ~ ~ ~ when ~ ~ of using with more combinations vs chaining elifs :, 
  - easier to read . 
  - easier to debug . 
  - faster operational speed ( while not priority at your stage , be aware ), 
  some great learning material ( intuitively ordered ) :, 
  - [ unity tutorial ] ( https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/scripting/switch-statements ), 
  - [ microsoft ( msdn ) ] ( https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/csharp/language-reference/keywords/switch ), 
  - [ wikipedia ( various implementation types ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/multiway_switching ), 
  while i believe you are correct in everything you said and you gave a great answer , i 'm not sure how specific op truly wants his answer . 
  if , through `` expensive '' op means `` expense '' as in `` cost more than not using '' and we break down the pipeline at the point you have , the answer is objectively yes . 
  we incur a cost that causes us to use more ram on the gpu , which also results in additional iops and cpu clocks at a point in time . 
  if your texture size is 16k , you will clearly notice this issue on today 's hardware , though i can not think of a pragmatic reason to use a 16k texture in unity and argue it was the best reasonable implementation possible . 
  pfft , i do this every fortnight , on the fortnight . 
  what a slacker !, 
  not enough days in the week . 
  grape , look what ~ ~ i ~ ~ you started . 
  wait ... what does md stand for ? 
  i always assumed it was medical doctor , but now i see it could be medical degree and can see many times where the two could vastly differ . 
  what a slacker !, 
  edit : removing bad info . 
  i 'm dumb and this remains true . 
  if you 're so smart , i demand you scientifictiously explain your name . 
  out of all of these ... bunched cilantro ... i do n't get the connection with condoms . 
  edit : upon further consideration , is there a new rectal refrigeration method i 'm not aware of ? 
  how so ? 
  are you saying you believe one is clearly not better than the other ? 
  * sharpens pitchfork *, 
  i choose to believe this original post was intended to be humorous in nature , thus i decided to continue with ( what i believe to be ) it 's true nature . 
  for , i too , can not see how the two could be correlated and have used these to make humorous comparisons . 
  although , if the intended purpose of ops post was not intended to be at all humorous in nature , i apologize and i did not intend to discredit the validity of this with intended harm to op . 
  if this is the case , i would ~ ~ also ~ ~ like a ~ ~ further ~ ~ more convincing explanation of how these two can be seen as closely correlating , because i 'm left asking `` why not firefly , red dwarf , or ( scifi in nature ) twilight zone ? '' . 
  edit : words . 
  i 'd be willing to bet you enjoy / r/earthporn, 
  poetry to my ears , your words truly were . 
  though , you words speak of star moonlight and pure starlight , but nay mention star sunlight . 
  why hath one self make such foolery , o wise but sarcastic one ? 
  also , that was truly good stuff . 
  9/10 , props . 
  my response is just too tryhard , but it 's the best i got so * shrug *, 
  edit : actually , that a rather rhetorical question , and it really does n't matter as i posted said info . 
  i apologize for that and had time to confirm it . 
  thank you for caring enough to show me this error and correcting my wronged ways , kind stranger . 
  do you see the correlation behind saying that immediately following only one frappuccino , anyone who plays the brush is more likely to mention things after stating they would not ? 
  is my causation not clearly correlated and relevant ? 
  as that shows science and this is not a journal , am i wrong ? 
  is there not a clear science behind this it being showings you jumped to conclusion . 
  i would argue that even a few years after it came out , minecraft offered more than many $ 50 ( or $ 60 these days ) games . 
  using the $ 60 figure , i would say $ 20 would be reasonable for a cool band and 6g flash drive , totally wurf . 
  while that automatically does n't mean i would buy one or i 'm the average consumer , as ( depending on when it was released ) it could have been too `` nichey '' at the time , op is a visionary has unlocked it 's true potential , only meaning this item was ** clearly ** ahead of it 's time as op had found it when it was on clearance ( read : too late ) . 
  either way , thank you , op . 
  ultimately , i would not buy one because i own minecraft from an era before it was deemed socially acceptable to voxel my life away but i view this as a better idea than hypothetically trying to launch-day bundle minecraft with a zip drive . 
  to me , that scenario on using a floppy disk would be ridiculous to me . 
  why is this ridiculous to you and not to me ? 
  are you giving good advice while making a fat joke ? 
  edit : you downvote me when i complement the quality of advice but question the methods of captain obvious ? 
  edit2 : by captain obvious , i refer to / u/hos _ captobvious,
