  the increase of average dps by coup is 15x ( 4.5-1 ) = 52.5 %, 
  the increase of average dps by daedalus is 25x ( 2.4-1 ) = 35 %, 
  they ca n't be used at the same time so daedalus will only be used if coup wo n't . 
  p ( a ) = 15 %, 
  p ( b \\ ^ a ) = 25 % x15 % = 3.75 %, 
  ( 25x1 .4 +15 x3 .5 ) -3.75 = ** 83.75 ** percent average dps increase with coup and daedalus . 
  daedalus gives ~ ~ 83.75-52 .5 = ** 31.25 % ** ~ ~ ** 29.75 % ** dps increase, 
  correct me if i 'm wrong i hate probability and statistics, 
  i also used x instead of * because it wanted to put the text in italic . 
  even cent can deny himself , the tooltips says he ca n't . 
  exactly , but the tooltip says he ca n't die from it . 
  if it 's intended it should be actually noted there . 
  he is dying indirectly from it , if it was n't for the shatter buff he would n't have died , in that case aa should get the credit . 
  tide does n't give a fuck about cc . 
  in theory yes , but when shit goes down , noone cares who they hit , as long as dmg is done . 
  this is n't hon, 
  this + daedalus on drow, 
  just amove into their base and press satanic when getting low . 
  as low level games mostly constist of carries , answer is yes . 
  yea , i do n't know what i was thinking . 
  thanks for correction, 
  btw you can write, 
  and get, 
  \\* without fucking the text \\* and \\ ^ __ \\ ^, 
  i thought armlet is core on terror , you wait until you got 1 hp and ult someone . 
  lothars for instagib without worrying about surviving . 
  could someone share their knowledge about what items were in od 's possesion at this given moment ? 
  thanks , midas explains it . 
  was wondering how he hit so fast , did he have tranqs or treads ? 
  last q , did he go mid ? 
  thanks a lot !, 
  yea , it was frost themed so it made sense . 
  well , i meant low enough . 
  know that feel, 
  be asian . 
  i get 2 rings and get a basi and tranqs , at the same time . 
  he has good agi gain and his geminate allows for easy lasthits without a lot of stats . 
  i 'll just uninstall this game ... 
  do n't forget bitch , they use it as a comma . 
  high/very high tells you as much as the geographical and precise location of asia in this sentence :, 
  '' it 's on earth '', 
  support is definitely harder than a carry . 
  it 's easier to play support and do something than to play a carry and be useful . 
  it 's harder to be a great support and win games than to be a good carry , farm for 30 minutes and have map awareness . 
  that 's why you get butterfly and deso on vs and start carrying those noobs . 
  he is the best mid hero in the game , he just does nothing more with farm . 
  there are some good teams , it 's growing . 
  lol is huge though , that 's what keeps it from growing , lolfags are really common , '' dota is a bad clone of lol , lol is made by dota creators , figure whats better ... '' etc. 
  it 's primarly a lol country , they even have their own language for the lol site , which is really surprising since poland is not a really '' popular '' country . 
  and chiot the leading producer of those would make you sign contracts to not play checkers or talk about it , or view your interest in it whatsoever . 
  you misspelled breasts and big, 
  does that mean that some people would be more active if f. ex . 
  they slept from 12 . am to 12 . pm ? 
  different sleep routines ? 
  i find it sad that there are a lot of dendis out there that have the potential but not the opportunity to shine in the pro scene . 
  tpl courier , what can i say , i love blue and dragons . 
  that \u00b4 s not the point , you don \u00b4 t send od mid to gank and shit on lanes , you pick him mid because he can easly dominate and control the enemy mid as long as he is in the lane and od can farm safely , necro does the same thing , aura is really painful . 
  dude i know , i 'm polish duuudeeee, 
  3 salves total , you just make sure to switch aggro . 
  magina so mad , magic rules, 
  those scenarios were so bullshit that it 's just not worth mentioning . 
  the scenario often used cards that were n't available in the game besides the challenge, 
  they were practically impossible to a player not playing mtg for years , i do n't even know if people just figured them out or tried all possible 50 combinations of solving . 
  they were unintuive and served no other purpouse than to piss you off and make you get steam achievments . 
  make a tp scroll be stuck in an inventory slot at all times , they will think you have to have it ingame aswell . 
  na'vi announces a new league of legends squad !, 
  omg learn russian noob fucking cyka bitch blyat idi nahui, 
  cyka, 
  omg they used heroes from dota 2 to make a lane with synergy , god forbid !, 
  burn them in hell !, 
  loda should pay you 100 $ an hour for that . 
  and 5 midas, 
  i was more talking about that the current dota 2 squad switches to lol, 
  are the old sets that did n't get in still possible to be added in ? 
  there were 2 amazing od sets i love and i wonder if there 's a chance to get them ingame . 
  slam the glass wine bottle !, 
  to be fair , that 's why you get sadist . 
  i wish , valve has the mm system just above the riki weapons visual bug , they do n't really show interest , nor they will fix it or even bother soon . 
  i do n't have fun when the game is a stomp . 
  even if i win . 
  i really doubt someone except russians enjoy stomps one way or the other . 
  depends on the hero i think . 
  the fact that it sucks and even valve said that . 
  they only started to work with it because dotabuff released dbr which worked they same way theirs elo or whatever and they woke up and realized it was crappy . 
  there was a video hero , gabe newell was talking in an university and someone asked why did they remove the dbr option . 
  i am on my phone right now so i ca n't find it . 
  he said that the dbr was the same evaluation system that they used , and it was bad so they did n't want it to be public . 
  lol, 
  because mm is shit atm . 
  accualy is 0.5 better, 
  proof ? 
  there are aoe stuns youknow . 
  i would have loved to have him blue though , not that teal is bad , but i think it would be cooler . 
  but you are not in the same spot for 0.5 seconds , that is relevant when firefly is right behind you . 
  by the way , does anyone know how to setup 2 range rings ? 
  magnus with blink and rp ; you will see the range of rp and the optimal blink range . 
  bfury on jugg is not something looked down upon , it 's just situational . 
  lol , people are so stupid . 
  or , they just do n't check until the person gets enough reports in a set amount of time/matches . 
  cyka nub puedg rprt pls no eat,
