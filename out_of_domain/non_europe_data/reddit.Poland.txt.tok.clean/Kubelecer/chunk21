  living armor, 
  the water hud that is in the files is amazing, 
  because it 's a buff not a passive, 
  no idea , i would assume it 's unpurgeable just like god 's strength . 
  are two different passwords even necessary ? 
  the '' hacker '' needs your phone to log into the gmail to then recieve the steamguard code anyways . 
  if you expect to be taken seriously about something people have n't seen from pro players on reddit , you will be disappointed . 
  not when your team does n't know what pushing is . 
  never 4give, 
  awesomenauts, 
  made myself actually play amnesia, 
  report nyx abuse text ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ), 
  so basically trilanes are now pretty hard to pull off 1v3 which encourages rotations/roaming, 
  offlanes are viable again, 
  junglers will be closer to the lane when starting out = easier to disrupt/gank, 
  melee mids are better because bat will be only jungling prolly from that patch, 
  make it able to bounce to targets that have been affected if no new targets are found like luna glaives, 
  2 heroes = doublekill in 0.5 second, 
  pudka pls, 
  2 mps, 
  if you 're stupid yes, 
  stick to lol then, 
  that 's your opinion, 
  we do n't have any numbers . 
  for all we know they may still have their debt from ti . 
  way to take everything out of context . 
  please quote when i said they make almost no money out of dota 2 . 
  lack of proof is n't proof . 
  elise ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ she ^ ^ ^ has ^ ^ ^ tits, 
  spin to dispel madness, 
  being different is not a good thing on the internet, 
  tidebringer spawns tidehunters on each enemy hit which will ravage after 1 sec if not killed . 
  the best units for high price ? 
  naaaah lets give them overpriced units that are marginally better at some stuff than others race 's . 
  dont forget slow build time and a tech tree that you ca n't switch easily . 
  poeple forget that a pure diffu illusion has as much hp as a pure radi one and the radi one will deal significantly more damage in its lifespan . 
  people started the hate on radiance alch/pl when pros started to fight a lot midgame and were n't always able to grab total free farm , and got a fast yasha/diffu . 
  let 's not forget how fast pl can farm with just a radi and treads . 
  respect for not missclicking and walking into the chrono, 
  he came when they had pay2win model still going on . 
  his q is a cancellable burrowstrike , w is an ice vortex mixed with upheaval , e is an explosive aoe dot that follows a target and detonates after a set time so it 's possible to outrun it and his ult is a targeted delayed ravage with crystals, 
  fav hero , made myself buy a hon account just so that i could play him . ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ regret ^ ^ ^ ^ every ^ ^ ^ ^ penny, 
  but did he have free farm ? 
  omg oj wants mid lol, 
  stfu u support,

  bullets = accelerating, 
  lol @ pl being one of the hardest carries,

  it should have started with one of those : the first , the only , the original , the outstanding , the undeniably best , the best , the motherfucking best game on earth that stomps league of lesbians to the ground or the humble, 
  working as intended, 
  literally taking no damage, 
  actually not useless , it explains the server drops atm, 
  jimmies were rustled . 
  depends on the intelligence and reddit experience of the reader . 
  noob chen misses all his arrows, 
  no duuuuuuude he is a robot, 
  duuuuuuude i totally read the lore, 
  duuuuuude he is a robot, 
  duuuuuuude he has a line saying he is a robot, 
  duuuuude wow small text robot plays clockwerk because clokwerk is a robot too !, 
  am i cool now because i cant read, 
  someone did n't have a word with blizzard service in the past . 
  or good hats, 
  why do people feed the troll ^ ^ ^ ^ warlord, 
  yea , i always get arteezy as my enemy mid : / sucks, 
  the international just ended guys rly gief break, 
  does it count replays for an effect ? 
  but with new hats though, 
  i want it . 
  i ca n't juke sometimes because of those motherfucking centaurs . 
  was n't volvo bought by the asians ? 
  i see pugna blasts , chen recalls and panda claps in the mid lane sometimes when they are being used in another lane and spell effects / attack projectiles are invisble, 
  but hats make me feel better . 
  you shall not defend this push until i run out of skill, 
  out of mana in 10 secs, 
  play him, 
  lose, 
  see what made you lose, 
  i am a bodyboulder, 
  q : mana combustion hook : deals 360 pure damage and burns 360 mana and deals 60 % of the mana burn as physical damage . 
  grants passive mana burn uam to autoattacks and ultimate . 
  w : rot blink : rot , with a passive component of blinking to safety if hp reaches a critical treshold . 
  purges doom . 
  6 sec cd, 
  e : anti-flesh shell : gives a fuckton of magic resistance and grants str on enemies dying around, 
  r : devour the mana void : channel for 3 secs , deals damage each second and deals damage proportional to mana lost at the end of the channel . 
  what if it always on cd, 
  every time i thought to myself , damn that fucking imba brood is 4/0 8 mins into the game , i won the game because it was a 4v5, 
  \u3064 \u25d5 _ \u25d5 \u3064 --------------- '  get over here !, 
  i think this bot is useless, 
  the mindgames . 
  muh binary reality !,
