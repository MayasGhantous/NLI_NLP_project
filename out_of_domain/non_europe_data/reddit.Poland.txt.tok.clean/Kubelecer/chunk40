  bot is rip ? 
  is n't the witcher 3 less than that ? 
  a better bazooka, 
  jacksons, 
  lost jacksons ? 
  go to step 3 . if not , step 4, 
  jacksons, 
  jacksons, 
  you can get a sherman if you have a good fuel lead on your opponent for better anti inf , but besides the jackson and e8 there is nothing worth your time really, 
  relic did n't patch the bulletin . 
  they thought getting 2 shermans to vet 1 was more accessible than equipping 1 bulletin, 
  please tell me when have you seen an avre churchill in a serious game ? 
  it got nerfed to shit after all axis players cried that a worse sturmtiger had the same damage . 
  it has to drive up to vision range , stop and then shoot a worse projectile while sturmtiger can shoot out of sight and the only downside is that it has a manual stop reload and no turret . 
  usage of units speak for themselves , i 've seen literally 0 avres post brit early access , especially after the incendiary mortar support stopped targeting okw trucks and emplacements became too easy to kill . 
  you also did n't include vet abilities . 
  pak has the best one in my opinion . 
  take aim is not that bad though , i think its only real use is spotting for your jacksons since you need ammo for it to do anything except light armor, 
  soviets have no non-doctrinal handheld at , and zis guns are expensive . 
  i really have no idea how you can make a zook blob stay practical when you need all the anti infantry upgrades you can get to stay relevant in the game . 
  i would suggest bigger gamemodes like 3v3 or 4v4 since they are not really that tense , that 's what i play when i want to relax and make tanks, 
   ` something big ' is not free weekend . 
  commander and skin sale !, 
  yes , limiting at to 1 unit is such great design . 
  it 's not like every other faction has at guns that do n't suck and at vehicles to boot . 
  it moves faster in cloak at vet 1 afaik, 
  raketen camo increases damage aswell . 
  it will 1 shot a clown car if it was cloaked and got the bonus . 
  churchills feed vet to paks , and you should have the stun in no time . 
  having no unit to spot for your at guns is asking to get them decrewed if nothing else is there . 
  if you are heavily invested in one area , you should mine off all the possible flanks if you do n't plan on guarding them . 
  it 's really hard to say anything without a replay , what commanders did you have, 
  the brit sniper is the best sniper in the game currently . 
  what 's there to explain ? 
  100 % accuracy vs buildings , delayed camo , has aimed shot and a weapon that does something vs vehicles , can throw arty and ignores rough terrain , but the last one is n't so relevant anymore, 
  you can still level it up, 
  g43 for close range and mobility , mg42 for long range . 
  you can compare squad dps here http://www.coh2-stats.com/compare, 
  only 1820 fuel , ezpz, 
  m10 requires good micro and is better in 1v1 than other gamemodes since there is less at . 
  i prefer the m10 as a unit since it allows me to chase down any damaged vehicle and kill it , while jackson is too expensive and fragile to even get close . 
  they serve different purposes, 
  there it is, 
  people who downvote this man have seriously not seen competetive 1v1s . 
  it 's basically a centaur rush into more centaurs , and if you somehow by a miracle did n't win , you could go into churchills , or just get more centaurs, 
   before , you either had to have a flank shot with an at gun to even have a chance to scratch it, 
   edit : so after some looking around , it looks like chance to penetrate is ( pen value/armor value ) * 100 , not a does pen beat armor comparison , so the stug and the at gun roughly have an 70 % chance to front pen prepatch , but post patch almost 100 % baring far shots . 
  panther has a 78 % chance to pen at far , and post patch far is 100 %, 
  do you want to see what allies have to deal with a panther ? 
  let 's start with usf at gun vs a ** p4 **, 
  125 pen vs 180/234 armor , vet2 or okw p4, 
  70 % chance on 180 armor and ** 53 % ** okw/vet2 p4 . 
  let 's see a panther . 
  usf at gun vs a panther, 
  125 vs 320 armor , 40 %, 
  jackson vs panther 68 % with normal shells . 
  firefly vs panther , 75 % once per 10 seconds, 
  zis gun vs panther, 
  all was taken using medium range penetration as max was often literally only at the maximum range and the same with close . 
  having 70 % penetration sounds like a god damn blessing to me , considering this was vs a medium tank which can blitzkrieg and in some cases pop panzer smoke . 
  this becomes even worse when pather gets skirts . 
  but saying that you have to flank for a 70 % penetration shots on frontal armor is so real , please go ahead and tell me how churchill was impervious to any axis at measures in the game , while all axis tanks are so easy to deal with, 
   baring the heavy tanks , other tanks can be taken down with at guns if they get ambushed and infantry based at grenades , fausts etc ( germans being a main one due to being glass cannons ) . 
  the churchill has so much armor and health that it can roll up and tank a bunch of shots and roll over the at attackers . 
  so in my opinion its the ultimate snowball vehicle baring heavy tanks . 
  ie lose any armor to whatever , and the churchills will roll over whats left since infantry based at has drawbacks , ie munitions cost or narrow field of view/low manuverability , so it bleeds you more than ever . 
  did you even read what i just wrote ? 
  i just showed you how every allied anti tank measure had lower penetration chance versus a stock ** medium ** tank which noone complains about , and you come here talking again how frustrating is it to deal with a tank that has lower armor than a tiger or a panther with the best at units in the game . 
  4v4s are not something you can base your balance knowledge from . 
  the churchill is irrelevant in 1v1s , because you either lose or win the game with your first centaur . 
  your statement on flanking churchills just to get a penetrating hit are absurd, 
  do n't bother . 
  all the churchill needs is a limit to 1 , and if somehow it still is `` broken '' , then it can be adjusted . 
  a regular churchill is in no way so broken as everyone says . 
  it ca n't just drive up to anything and kill with its ' p4 gun . 
  i can see that it may be a problem when several of them come at once , but as a one lone heavy tank it is fine . 
  it could maybe use a fuel price inrease but otherwise it 's still not as bad as people say . 
  you can fix this by uninstalling company of heroes 2 . 
  i think you have a bigger chance to get something for the faction you 're playing . 
  not 100 % , but definitely more likely regardless . 
  thompson paras ? 
  resource management, 
  it has 200 damage . 
  jackson has 200 and gets 240 with hvap, 
  what mode ? 
  smoke and flank the counter to everything, 
  if you do n't manage to m20 the sniper earlygame , there is nothing you can do really besides using indirect fire to get lucky in my experience . 
  pathfinders as a unit are a pretty good counter to snipers , but besides them and m20 you have nothing direct as a counter . 
  if you have to , move at it with a large force since ost sniper can just stun 1 squad and be safe , or just focus on other parts of the map where it will take a while for him to catch up, 
  the developers have incredibly low manpower . 
  yes , because a bar can put out 9 far range dps . 
  they removed it because you could win vs any infantry in the game with 1 free instant ability that gave you yellow cover, 
  they have 4 models and have no at . 
  sounds familiar, 
  try fighting with full hp units , so they do n't snipe because they have rifleman dps at far range, 
  instakill on any model below 70 % , pathfinders snipe at 40 %, 
  how can there be 7 million ppl if 11 trillion died in holocaust ? 
  i think it 's about the fact that abilities get replaced for a detonation effect , like puck jaunt and would n't get replaced back after detonation . 
  you can also counter okw falls/jli by mining building entrances, 
  if i want to snag infantry , i like to put them on corners that the enemy will most likely turn , which would make the models be closer to eachother,
