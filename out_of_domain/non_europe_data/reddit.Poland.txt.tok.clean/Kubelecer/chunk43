  stay back and wait for model drops . 
  they 're expensive, 
  you do n't need a counter for sturms ... 
  downvoted for a good reply , gj reddit, 
  they use the same gun so they have the same reload and range, 
  ace has way better vision range, 
  who the fuck cares about the mg rofl, 
  calling bullshit on kalkarak, 
  if you still do n't get get it , hint : their main guns link to the ** same gun **, 
  i 'm sorry but if i ever get a tiger ace i do n't get it for the `` super '' mg, 
  outplayed, 
  yeah , i bought transistor and it 's laggy on my surface pro 3 i5/8gb, 
  oh yea , i 'm going to wake up at night/super early just so i can check i did n't miss a game on the flash sale , great design . 
  company of heroes 2 is a great game that i personally recently discovered through humble bundle a while ago . 
  it 's really addictive and pretty engaging as you do n't have macro to worry about . 
  samsung galaxy s2, 
  sony z5c, 
  there 's a bug that allows you to equip other faction 's commanders, 
  if you got the replay i 'm pretty sure you can report them to relic directly via email, 
  l2p scrub and come back when you agree with my retarded opinion, 
  axii hex failed !, 
  because it 's garbage, 
  basically they are copy pasterinos of eachother with rangers having 0.8 rec accuracy but you ca n't compare them unit for unit , you have to take the whole doctrine into account . 
  paratroopers and pathfinders are the only good things airborne has , while cavalry has rifleman mines , offmap smoke , rangers , selfspot and +5 range on tanks and the pershing . 
  paratroopers deal way more damage thanks to the assault ability , but the commander overall is bad . 
  p47s are sitting as the worst/2nd worst loiter in the game at an absurd 240 ammo price , and captain and lt are both pretty good now so there 's not a good reason to skip both , which means .50 cal/at gun drop are really expensive manpower wise . 
  not to mention with the riflemen vet 3 buff , usf does n't really need or can afford `` elite '' infantry most of the time . 
  yes pershing is a late option , but atleast it 's there + combined arms is a very underrated ability too , 1 squad next to a jackson and it can self spot with 65 range . 
  when was the last time you saw airborne picked seriously , even mechanized had more play in the tourney with assbag, 
  this post can be summed up with : you are new, 
  you are new and losing to x strategy , that 's not exclusive to coh, 
  if they go for mortars , they have no infantry , in top play mortars are not a common sight . 
  even so , mortars can not 1hit a squad if they are in green cover . 
  every unit gets veterancy if it does n't die for a long period of time . 
  you complain that you do n't recognize units ? 
  what ? 
  every tank has a distinct historical silhouette and every squad has a unique icon on top of them . 
  ptsd from release, 
  well , it 's true that defensive play is easier than offensive and sometimes you ca n't do anything , but there are units specifically meant to counter other things . 
  just because someone lost to your mortar does n't mean it 's unbeatable . 
  well , i personally have no problem seeing a difference between squads , and i think that point is entirely subjective as the icons provide enough information . 
  you ask them politely to not hurt you . 
  or keep an arms length away from them . 
  got ta love getting kicked by a 4 stack for no reason after 40 minutes, 
  like you had a choice, 
  now you ca n't even do content anymore, 
  hey i got a pretty identical problem, 
  asus z-170 a, 
  crucial ballistix ddr4 2400mhz 8gb x2, 
  asus 970 gtx, 
  i ca n't boot without using the memok option , and now i face random bsods , i will do a memtest soon . 
  they also pierce buildings, 
  potato camera, 
   coat thread, 
   not that many coats, 
  im pretty sure everone spent all their money on queue cutting already [ ] ( / pepe ), 
  he did , i left at his 3rd week, 
  remember to stay an arms length away from migrants !, 
  buy the calliope commander, 
  i 've read that windows security essentials is good enough nowadays, 
  is thoorin even relevant these days , all he does is post edgy tweets, 
  every time i see his name on reddit it 's about some `` controversial '' topic . 
  never otherwise . 
  thought that poland fiasco would make him act more mature , but i guess not [ ] ( / pepe ), 
  really ? 
  i 'm wrong then . 
  maybe he is just retarded on twitter i guess . 
  destiny is lifting too [ ] ( / notears ), 
  do n't bully blue [ ] ( / dafeels ), 
  what happen, 
  i think this is it, 
  actually , they are slippery tube dudes, 
  will this still have the cumulative time stacking ? 
  barforsubscribers = true ;, 
  there i did it [ ] ( / pepe ), 
  imaginary internet points are a big deal, 
  name : kubelecer, 
  gender : male, 
  if you can change the nationality i would love it if you could make me polish, 
  so the body has measures for when a part is missing , but ca n't make it grow back ? 
  piece of shit muscle cage, 
  so let 's keep everything in worse balance because you assume people are too stupid to learn minor differences in skill effects between modes ? 
  pandering to the lowest commmon denominator is a great way to make the game lack depth , strategy and balance, 
  you know what ? 
  burden of knowledge \u2122 is really toxic \u2122 and antifun \u2122 so let 's remove all skills in the game , and make every single skill an auto attack with a different animation . 
  best to not confuse players , after all they are vegetables when it comes to intelligence , or atleast that 's what people here say, 
  so what you 're saying , if someone spends a lot of time in pve only and wants to try pvp for the first time , he will have such a hard time adapting to different cooldowns/casting times that he will drop playing pvp completely just because of that ? 
  yes , it 's an added layer of depth that requires the player to adapt . 
  yes , skill and knowledge are a part of the game . 
  you are approaching this only from the bad/new player side . 
  i still do n't understand your argument, 
  you are forced to do something new and learn it , why is it a bad thing ? 
  why is learning something so evil ? 
  i like learning new things , i like being pushed out of my comfort zone and use what i learned to progress . 
  * are people like me not relevant ? 
  * are people who want everything on a silver platter the majority ? 
  * are people who are n't willing to put time and effort into learning the game ** worth ** more than people who are willing to do it ? 
  * is gw2 supposed to be a game that literally every person , no matter the age or amount of hands can pick up and master in 5 hours ? 
  from what i see , somehow people think yes is the answer for all these 4 questions and i just ca n't comprehend why , because this is just a spit in the face for players who have been playing for years and put up with all this shit anet has thrown at them . 
  you are saying that the game should n't even consider good players when it comes to game design , because you ca n't dumb down a game and increase the skill ceiling at the same time,
