( i wrote : you can buy nori on allegro ( polish ebay-like site ) , they 're suitable to eat raw and dry straight from package . 
  onigiris are delicious and easy to prepare - you only need soy sauce and rice vinegar . 
  recipe is somewhere in web for sure . ), 
  my first and only ever shiny was ledyba in pokemon silver . 
  important thing to mention is that i was playing it on my game boy pocket - yes , the monochromatic one . 
  i could n't afford then buying gbc so i would be very happy when got to know that gold and silver are playable on black and white gbs and spend most of my savings ( i was 13 ) on game when it came up . 
  while playing gold or silver on b & w screen shiny pokemon were marked in different way than on the colour one . 
  there was something like spinning light reflex appearing for a second while pokemon were becoming visible . 
  i did n't know what 's going on and did n't give half of a shit about it , just grinded poor ledyba to earn some exp . 
  i understood my mistake later when i encountered red gyarados and seen that light reflex again . 
  i regret it now , i have n't encounter shiny pokemon no more till today ( have finished 2nd and 3rd generation games few times on emulators on cell phone ) . 
  i know it 's in polish , but either it is excellent source . 
  try using google translate , make use from pictures or crawl some links there . 
  how do you imagine it ? 
  i have n't teached anybody polish ever . 
  do you want some professional lessons or just talking about things ? 
  for me - in poland - according to polish , czech and german beer that i 've tried already , i would describe it this way :, 
  schwarzbier - more roasty , nutty , blacker , drier , more bitter, 
  dunkel - more toasty/melainodinic , creamy , chocolaty , buttery , browner, 
  i had exactly the same thought .

  offer them tea with every meal , especially for breakfast . 
  always ask how many spoons of sugar would they like and sweeten it for them . 
  also ask if they want to have slice of lemon in it . 
  very polish drink is kompot made from boiled rubarb and sugar, 
  depends on the carrier and train type . 
  if you choose pkp przewozy regionalne 's * po\u015bpieszny * do n't expect much . 
  probably there will be socket only at the toilet . 
  sometimes you 'll find one in the corridor but not always working . 
  same on pkp intercity 's * tlk * aka * twoje linie kolejowe ( ` your railway lines ' ) * except there will be socket in the corridor at high probability . 
  pkp intercity 's express trains have socket next to every seat . 
  also train sockets often do n't work during stoppage so do n't panic if you plug the charger in right after getting in and it wo n't work . 
  anyone also spotted that diablo is very manly , it does n't look like his woman-ish version from d3 ? 
  possible expansion spoiler ? 
  so many sizes of them !, 
  i strongly recommend going to kufle i kapsle multitap bar ( nowogrodzka 25 - behind novotel , just few steps from metro centrum ) and trying beers from artezan , pracownia piwa , pinta , widawa or alebrowar . 
  they have very nice and competent staff , 12 pipes and a lot of bottles . 
  ask if they have rhino from widawa brewery . 
  it 's their very new smoked apa . 
  have n't tried it myself yet but polish beer geeks and bloggers say very nice things about it . 
  wow , thanks a lot !, 
  this is very helpful . 
  seems a bit expensive but still a lot cheaper than checked baggage ... 
  thank you , 
  yes you are right but i am flying with ryanair . 
  i have paid 15 eur for the ticket from budapest to warsaw and checked baggage costs extra 50 eur for 15 kg ... 
  this is ridiculous proportion and that 's why i 'm taking only the carried one . 
  for chrome magic actions for youtube has this feature under ` auto hd ' section . 
  i clicked only because i have read the same thing . 
  i 'm mildly disappointed now . 
  spiders with wings . 
  non-satire hospital simulator . 
  i have been waiting so many years for this ... 
  go to omerta pub and try some polish craft beer . 
  pozna\u0144 and wielkopolska has pretty strong dialectal wordbase . 
  i 'm not from pozna\u0144 but i think it was `` stary dziod '' . 
  i think that in pozna\u0144 's dialect `` dziod '' means just `` a man ( male ) '' . 
  also `` dziod '' sound like a form `` dziad '' which in non-dialect polish is form of `` grandfather '' but told in simple , colloquial and a little rude way or in an old fashioned way . 
  `` dziad '' could possible mean a bum , a hobo or old annoying man . 
  so probably the way that your praprababcia used to call her husband was kind of wordplay but in a fact `` old man '' still remains most accurate translation . 
  strefa piwa would be excellent choice too . 
  well , i have n't been there but i 'm pretty sure it could be serving temperature issue . 
  i live in warsaw and we have similar problem in po drugiej stronie lustra . 
  they overcool beer and this cuts a lot of flavor and aroma . 
  this is from poland and it 's older than the internet . 
  literally . 
  it reminds me early ' 00s when most of people did n't have internet connection and tons of short films like that got from one hands to another on cd 's labeled '' \u015bmieszne '' ( ` funny ' ) . 
  what else has tomek sent you this time ? 
  are you going to make hangout again ? 
  i 'm getting confused because i do n't know if dots on the sea are raised or dented . 
  just to be clear : when i downloaded core zeta for win it 's named `` 1.4 '' . 
  this is only a typo , right ? 
  oh , now i see how dumb the question was . 
  somehow i was fixed on that it means 1.4.4 . 
  anyway thanks for replying !, 
  and , obviously , thanks a lot for new update and your work !, 
  match colour of the stone to her eyes . 
  why am i feeling urge to kick it, 
  with nfz not always it has to be months , but weeks for sure . 
  you can tell them that you need to hurry and sometimes they will call you when another patient cancel their session . 
  if you want to try going with nfz you need to visit psychiatrist first who give you referral for therapy with psychologist . 
  if you ca n't afford private therapy it can be also good idea to go to psychiatrist and just talk with them , take some prescriptions . 
  even if drugs are n't the solution , they can at least help a little , also you will have some place to anchor . 
  here is list of all nfz-ish places : http://www.nfz-warszawa.pl/leczenie/iktu304/ibum404170000102/imsc918123/index.html, 
  sessions in english will be hard to find when going with nfz but it is n't impossible . 
  about pesel issue . 
  if you are citizen of eu you 'll need [ ehic ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catid=563&amp;langid=en#nationalinfo ) . 
  if you do n't have it , instead of pesel they should use your passport no . 
  probably most of doctors and pharmacist does n't know that . 
  well it can be the hard part cause people in polish are generally suspicious when they do n't know law regulations and they usually do n't like when you know something better ... 
  but do n't give up . 
  you can print [ this regulation of ministry of health ] ( http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/download;jsessionid=dc7196a017365488f4a20055a0d603b5?id=wdu20120000260&amp;type=2 ) then distinguish \u00a7 2 , 2 ) , g. and show them while being polite and nice , 
  if you choose private sessions while having limited money , i 'd reccomend choosing cbt . 
  it has limited amount of sessions like 8-12 so while they can cost more than 50pln/session , it costs less in a long term calculating . 
  if you have hard breakdowns , and suicidal . 
  do n't hesitate going to any near hospital . 
  they have to offer you help if you are suicidal no matter of nfz issues . 
  it 's from `` skrzynka piwa '' ( `` the beer box '' ) in warsaw , poland .
