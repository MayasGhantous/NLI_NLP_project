  i mean , considering how stuff like google analytics and trends work on internet i do not want to feed those , while at the same time making some fun of you know who . 
  arguably , the plot with her and her dad was properly sidelined in that episode , she did n't overshadow roy or the main plot , hell id even say it played well in the overarching story of the ep . 
  why is n't she wearing a burka !? 
  how dares she to have a body !, 
  oh no , i am scarred for life ... / s, 
  nah , he is just a man !, 
  we do n't have feelings or rights and sure as hell we ca n't be sexualized !, 
  and totally covered too !, 
  even if it 's out of character for them , i still hate what they did to miss fortune and her skins . 
  also , the mod creators want their works to be popular so they make them for trending categories , while i am pretty sure most likes sexy women themselves . 
  then her old skins got totally covered up in game , the biggest victim being secret agent . 
  ah , i get it now . 
  so , it is because we can also enjoy something ? 
  brb , let me gauge my eyes out in the name of equality . 
  one person who most likely wont buy or if he does , he wont play it all that much if at all . 
  more like , because they listen to a vocal ( one person oposed by whole topic saying him he is wrong for christ sake ! ), 
  minority over their decisions of keeping art content . 
  they could use infinite crisis of sorts to fix arrow , since it could include a soft timeline reset erasing inconvenient events from the show , which could also be interesting on lot , since they may/could not be affected by it resulting in some interesting interactions . 
  `` she inspired me to take up the mantle of supergirl . 
  she is the true supergirl . '', 
  * que the sounds of a mlion viewers dying inside *, 
  yeah , i expected a bit more from the episode . 
  i gues it was slightly overhyped . 
  i am surprised they even care about that , doubt any of them read comics or care about them . 
  hopefully , dc for one knows their audience and wont cave in , then again after what blizzard pulled off i am starting to get worried . 
  heh , funny thing is that it would be allright to have the original show trio in the comics before seasons 3 and 4 happened and ruined them for everyone . 
  but why ? 
  really , they probably wont even buy the comic , let alone read it . 
  yeah , i know about sjws . 
  my take on those people is as follows :, 
  basically , you know how girls and `` cool '' guys never played games or comics when they were kids up to 10 years ago because that was something for `` nerds '' ? 
  well , now those people are in their twenties and suddenly games and comics are cool and they are left out since they do not like this type of media , they simply grew up that way there is nothing wrong about that . 
  this results in many of those people , especially the more egocentric ones to speak up and cause a ruckus that the cool thing is no abut them and try to `` fix '' it . 
  what i noticed , and i wont rediscover the wheel here , about many people who fight for changes such as olicity or more recently about the overwatch ( the game ) pose were most likely school bullies that just did not grew up , considering that some of the most vocal ones are coming from well-off/rich families its not hard to imagine that mommy and daddy did not let them grow up . 
  those people do not care about the book , they care about the reader ( themselves ) . 
  the thing about earth-x 's in flarrow is that the `` main '' earth doesnt seem to be earth-1 either so the whole numeration may be waaay off . 
  save up some money by not paying for xbox live , suddenly he could afford it . 
  it kind of bothers me that the club chat ca n't be seen in game . 
  while i wo n't deny what you said because it * can * be true . 
  i still ca n't get my head around why would n't the hypothetical new player , boosted or not , read any basic information from in game tutorials or internet or just look at a tooltip and go `` huh '' . 
  i get it , but even darksouls most likely has even some brief iname guidelines regarding the pure basics to folow . 
  so , basically trial and error ? 
  imho , they should have updated the tbc starter zones in either wod or legion , that 's the least they could do since those zones stand out the most and should consume less resources than redoing everything again . 
  it used to be 15 . :(, 
  no , it does n't have to . 
  this edition will be great for two reasons :, 
  it will blow you away . 
  counterstrike fans will get to see a real life recreation of cs and de map type matches if all goes well . 
  nowe , for canary the nemesis will be the tumblr shippers . 
  i would like huntrs to come bk to be the anti-hero vegeta to laurel 's hero canary . 
  ah , the good old sexism !, 
  `` argument '' . 
  yeah , us straight white guys are just bunch of robots created with only one purpose , to please anyone who is not us . 
  please , take her away form us !, 
  you can even keep her !, 
  i would say its more along of the lines `` the alliance cleans up remaining old horde forces , while thrall 's horde goes to kallimdor '', 
  it would be a breath of fresh air for a movie like that to have a bad ending . 
  well . 
  he tried to save the show by killing her , so i would say yes . 
  oh man , imagine if there was a show like ramsay 's but for tv show writers . 
  the visit on arrow 's set would be glorious . 
  i mean , donna would.d make sense for both oliver leaving the ring and you know who being upset . 
  you know what ? 
  forget the wifi , she stopped using it anyway . . 
  this , and also i belive that the majority here actually like her as her old pre watered down love interest character . 
  the shipping ruined her , so i belive it would be okay if any of the below happened :, 
  * the ship ends for good . 
  * she leaves the team/show . 
  at this point she is just a walking trope , not even a comic relief , just a trope . 
  also , donna 's behavior has ** some ** grounding , as in she is well how to say it lightly ... kind of dumb , while felicity was meant to be the oposite . 
  yeah , while i would love ga+bc classic pairing , i could have waved my hand on felicity being with oliver if it was literally a small side plot that would not be a central point of the story . 
  and longbows !, 
  wait i have a great idea !, 
  a new storyline called longbow hunters !, 
  too bad roy is basically a rarely recurring character at this point . 
  even if not for lot , killing him makes little sense to be honest . 
  think about the development to the street level action he received this season , he even got a new helmet twice . 
  it feels like they are throwing all those resources into nothing if they kill him off . 
  also , aos had scenes such as :, 
  - severed limbs, 
  - blowing someone into pieces, 
  - crushed chest , meh . 
  - ripping out heart . 
  - dissection, 
  poland would be able into space . 
  his voice ( well , the laugh mainly ) would surely not be punchable compared to the current host . 
  i also like cinema sins , i think i binged most of their videos when i discovered them , just compared to those videos the newer ones feel overdone . 
  sadly it reflects the show pretty well . 
  too bad they scrapped arrow after season 2 . 
  the fanfic spinoff/epilogue just does not cut it . 
  they will go after next week if i am not mistaken . 
  looking how onbench may be done with arrow forever real soon it would n't be all bad to have two synopsis at the same time . 
  i mean , considering what ** may ** come next week , most of us will be done with the show anyway . 
  this is the sad part about reality we live in i guess , since the pleas to writers did not work i guess this is the only way to proceed . 
  yes , yes it is . 
  then again if the other rumour related to it gets confirmed we will have a new great regular on flash . 
  katie classify was on the set of the flash recently . 
  its more of a hopeful wish , but yeah they may bring the canary or e2 canary over to flash , who knows . 
  oh also , if you mean the first rumour it is that they are killing off bc . 
  to be honest it would be nice to still keep her somewhere rather than killing her off on arrow , which is already a huge mistake .
