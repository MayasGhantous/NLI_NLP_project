  id say its a way of the flash writers to save arrow whenever the board decides to assign new writers . 
  well , this case should be excused because the decision about killing off a key character in the context of dc and arrow is kind of pants on head stupid . 
  he was n't trying to act like loki either , he did n't even do the voice . 
  its free , although id say ublock is better . 
  * oh , i am not like a good player at all . 
  some would say i am the reverse . 
  nah , she would do strictly desk work , she would also take a 180 * turn to of her personality . 
  indeed , the tone could be lighter , their other points stand tho . 
  the season lacks both theme and stakes . 
  lost probably just lost its track because of slightly too long lifespan of the show , although i believe that it could have been worse . 
  prison break . . 
  the same thing , that show was designed to last two seasons tops but they tried to milk it for so long . 
  `` i dont need healthcare when i have jesus !, 
  ** [ obligatory felcity mention or cameo intensifies ] **, 
  bvs with the big bad reveal , ugh ... 
  although the movie was still good , it could have been better if i did n't know that . 
  ** [ panic fapping ] **, 
  need to get the spunk on her , quick !, 
  i still think that supports are in a really weird spot right now . 
  i think the main problem lays in the weak ones not being good enough rather than the strong ones . 
  basically if let 's say song would be better , she would be a solid counter to soraka . 
  rogues and hunters, 
  speaking of the flash , look at its sister show arrow , it basically shows what kind of people watch those and what happens when showrunners listen to them , they become generic soap operas with action scenes . 
  this is a really weird stance , but hey , whatever you like . 
  now they are tainted with thoughts , you know what has to be done !, 
  * reloads shotgun *, 
  dont underestimate the europeans , in poland alone we have basically white trash as a growing out period for most of the kids , whats more annoying is that plenty stay in it . 
  not the best writing/idea , but i am ok with this . 
  to po co dr\u0105\u017cy\u0107 dalej . 
  if i would have to pick a `` viewer 's character '' it would be diggle , most of the time his feelings reflected what audience was meant to feel . 
  just a bunch of ( physically ) grown up bullies . 
  i think you may be giving cw a bit too much credit . 
  unless someone from warner kicked the door in and took the arrow 's staff by their collars saying `` you dun fucked up , now we do it our way ! '', 
  i do not really see it happening . 
  its hard to say if its control or `` convincing '' since iron chef seems to behave normally , even a bit reluctant in regards of doing squidward 's chores at times . 
  i dont know , to me it looks like a bit of both , since they seem to be scared as if disobeying meant instant death . 
  my theory is that he plants some kind of parasites inside of them that work more as a surveillance rather than direct control . 
  it annoys me greatly considering that poland was erased from the maps for quite a bit , then the whole world war two and holocaust deal happened , but i guess to those people it 's not as bad as having an all white cast . 
  the source material contributes to that greatly , basically , first two books in the series are just collections of short side stories loosely attached to the main plot of each book . 
  seriously , who cares about skin colour . 
  i am here for the plot damn it . 
  sometimes , i am glad that i get to watch this shitshow from a country that did n't go crazy . 
  we may even redeem sargeras in legion , who knows what the pillars do . 
  while tying your weapon 's power to their progression which is double bullshit . 
  and two more trucks of snow . 
  i mean the idea of artifacts alone is not the worst , it even has a plenty of potential . 
  the thing that is wrong is that we are forced to progress our class halls to unlock the artifact 's full potential . 
  even garrisons are n't as bad in this regard , since if you decide not to use them they do n't directly hinder your characters performance , you do not lose stats . 
  indeed , now its like dragon ball gt , a fanmade spinoff-sequel . 
  that attitute would have been fine if he would not take input from ** anyone ** !, 
  yes , this includes the shippers . 
  thats the bright side of it all i guess , the shippers stay away from `` shit for nerds '' like green arrow comics and to some degree a proper movie . 
  that is why i called it optional . 
  as u/stealthhikki said above , amell 's hands ** may ** not be clear in the whole situation but i am not the one to judge . 
  added , thanks !, 
  poland here , a decent pc these days would be around 3k to 6k pln , with the minimum ( and well pretty much average in the gaming demographic ) wage is around 1750 pln which is sunk in pretty significant costs . 
  what i am saying that i am stuck with my current rig for at least few more years . 
  take that into account and imagine console games prices . 
  guggie the hutt just sounds better . 
  in what role though ? 
  nothing comes to mind for me . 
  if they would have started with older spider-man they could cast her as spiderwoman/black cat , but well ... they are not . 
  neither is she a good fit for danvers imho . 
  i do not mean to attack ebr in any way but it seems that the writers may also have pushed for her a bit more due to personal pity , since she probably is a nice but anxious person as i have read somewhere referenced on this sub . 
  they may just feel bad for her anxiety and try to avoid any drama by trying to reduce her role . 
  but at this point its just a wild speculation . 
  wasnt colton dating ebr ? 
  it may be something relevant to that and well . . olicity . 
  neither do i care about ebr , its the character and no one should attack the actress . 
  what i mean is that with all that shipping going around haynes may not have felt comfortable having his gf in this position which may have affected his relationship with amell . 
  this is my wild thought . 
  to be honest i had the shippers pressure on my mind more than the romance acting . 
  remember , those people attacked amell 's wife and shopped ebr in her place on some pictures etc. 
  help i am being oppressed !, 
  also , heres a link to my patreon . 
  i believe one can take only as many personal attacks on the internet . 
  then we will have a nice giggle about the whole situation . 
  added to the main post , thank you . 
  dear riot , the down syndrome victims are under-represented in your game . 
  we believe that vayne and her players represent the mentally handicapped really well . 
  the current appearance tainted my down hamster , now i have to do the hard deed ... * reloads shotgun *, 
  i do not really care for the history while dealing with today 's germans but i am still aware of it . 
  most of germans i knew were really nice people so nothing bad to say here . 
  the only concern i have lays in the macro scale due to current situation in germany and europe as a whole , lets just say i do not agree with your immigration policy and i do not like that some of the german narrative tries to badmouth us because poland wont do the same mistake of letting too many middle-easterners in . 
  can you run it has a tendency to be biased , i would take its result with a large grain of salt . 
  i fear they may bring over caity lotz for s5 , that may end up badly if they keep writing the show badly . 
  * cough * not all of them . 
  * looks angrily at tumblr * you stay where you are !, 
  welp , gon na fix that !, 
  same here , m8 . 
  i even brought a shitcoat for the shitstorm !, 
  laurel having lines , what show am i watching ? 
  nononononono , stop talking captain too much exposition too much resolution . 
  on the bright side at least it stays untainted by felicity , but i guess she will show up last minute to ruin everything by needing to be saved . 
  no , dont go , dont go . 
  wait , did he shoot them through the vest ? 
  oliver channeling bale 's batman . 
  where is she !, 
  `` that could have been a faint . '', 
  thinks everyone about the leaks .
