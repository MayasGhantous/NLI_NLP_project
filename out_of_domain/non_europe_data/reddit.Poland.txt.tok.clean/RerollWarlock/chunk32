  so , my system needed an emergency reinstall and i decided to come up with new rainmeter . 
  it 's a bug with the metric system , requires a manual fix in the luascript . 
  [ as it is shown in comments by melcor83 to the plugin itself .

  i think you are fine as it is , no point in overdoing it . 
  with hodor it may be that they just went on the same/similar adventure with willis , then bran messed him up with the vision when he was holding the door . 
  also , the people responsible for make-up etc make ebr look at least 10 years older than she actually is , considering that both characters should be , give or take , the same age . 
  at least we didint get to know her whole family throughout a season . 
  edit the ini of skyrim launcher plugin , font values are under `` variables '' . 
  oh good , that justifies breaking all the screens . 
  since there are a few colors in play , i 'll just dump the variables in . 
   [ variables ], 
   stringeffect = shadow, 
  similar thing in poland . 
  170 pln for a game is a bit much , then keep in mind paying ~ 45 pln per month to play the damn game since token prices are going over the roof in eu already . 
  i wish blizz store would region lock us for the sake of cheaper prices . 
   although i do n't know the reason , i understand that blizzard must have its reasons for not allowing countries to use their own properly scaled down ( or up ) currencies , like the way steam does . 
  the old reason i remember for most of the games is that some people from the eurozone would go to any lengths to just buy the games/subs in pln and then convert it to euro resulting in really cheap games/subs . 
  then again , blizzard tracks your login locations quite well and even blocks the account if you move to another country ( in some cases it was reported by few people i know ) and requires you to verify that your account was not stolen . 
  yet again , aside from ip , the country to which the credit card that is used to pay could be used to verify the sale in pln , i just gues that it is not worth for blizzard to go to these lengths for our market , which considering the populations some of polish private servers used to have ( and some still have ) , they would attract quite a few players . 
  got ta chip in on that , i gues farming gold isnt for everyone , since i teried both farming raids or other stuff in the world and i just got bored by it after about hour of grind . 
  when it comes to ah it really comes down to luck and realm activity , for example my realm became pretty dead at the end of expansion and the prices dropped significantly as well as the buyers just moved out of the game . 
  then there are also people that obsess over controlling the market ... 
  i tried both of the above , ended up on around constant 200k , while buying the ever increasing in price token . 
  i just do not understand how people end up with milions of gold . 
  it still feels like thats 3 hours i could spend doing something else . 
  although , i get your point . 
  oh , those are not jokes . 
  we are just trying to save you from wasting your time/money on watching a tumblr soap opera , trust me , its that bad , not just worse . 
  i do n't know much about the division , but this seems like the classic mmo case of players outgearing the content . 
  coming up with these can be amusing , surely more amusing than one certain cw show ... 
  i do n't know ... technically , there are plenty of tv shows and movies they could do . 
  some key characters would be missing , mr fan4stick and prof xavier were important in the story iirc . 
  yup , i would love more rhodes , maybe in a solo movie or something . 
  he 'll they could make him do cameo in their tv shows for christ sake . 
  or watch `` arrow '' in its latest season and see how a suck bow and arrow hero looks . 
  nono , she will end up with tony so he can pass all his wealth onto her , then she will dump him and date someone else , while being the new iron man . 
  infinity war could just result in the fox x-men joining the mcu in some way . 
  for an average person or young adults ? 
  most likely , although i am not romanian , but i also live in the eastern europe . 
  month . 
   i have n't played it much, 
  ^ this may be a problem . 
  you often have to pull off some coordinate shit to brake the defense of the point/chokepoint . 
  its fast , its fun , it allows you to actually blacklist people from matchmaking if they are ragers . 
  the same thing as league ? 
   tf2 if you die , generally it feels fair, 
  you ... you ... do realize that tf2 has random crits ? 
  i do not see how rng can be considered `` fair '' . 
  so , its all fine if it dies in the west and stays in china ? 
  as of 2015 . 
  they released a big ass inforgraphic when they were at their peak , i havent seen one ever since . 
   `` looking for new opportunities , i 've appreciated my time at riot and wish them the best at all their future endeavors '', 
  * cough * lyte * cough *, 
  anyway , i share your sentiment , i spent a lot of time with the game , its been over 5 years . 
  i remember the s1 worlds and the year before that , releases of ancient champions like lux/mf/irelia . 
  i just feel that the game is done ( for me at least ) and i want to move on and my friends to move on aswell so i 'll have some people to play with instead of looking for new ones . 
  tl ; dr : it is time to put the old yeller down . 
  good for you , as one of the old players id say that its a bit of a burnout hitting some of us . 
  you can cross the rift only so many times . 
  when i see a rager , i go to social -  recently played -  right click on the rager 's name -  avoid the player . 
  the experience improved for me after blocking a few . 
  most of other bullets have a flight time , most noticibly d.va 's out-of-mech blaster , mercy 's blaster and lucio 's sound cannon . 
  i also reminded myself , it can also be done directly in game , just press p a list of players should pop up . 
  since i am playing in eu and the language barrier is real over here i just disabled the voice chat . 
  ofcourse i gave it a try for some time , all i heard were some french or spanish guys mumbling something in their languages or russians yelling in russian . 
  i expect no less from league 's solo voice chat . 
  twitch servers are n't helpful to anyone , either . 
  the right team , yeah ... 
  i tried playing her constantly for two days now , i ca n't even get areas on more than one person when tracer dies in handmade and solider dies in numbing and i am left in the middle of route 66 with 3 enemy genjis an 3 enemy reapers . 
  literally , those two days got me so angry ... 
  ultimates have a clear both audio and visual indication on when they are used and they can be interrupted/blocked or even reflected pretty easily . 
  some examples :, 
  junkrat 's tire has very low hp and can be heard clearly , any damage character can shoot it easily , or even better find junkrat 's himself since when he controls it he is a sitting duck . 
  mcree ultimate ? 
  can be heard from a mile away , you can either hide or kill him since he glows like a christmas tree and is slowed by 90 % . 
  soldier ultimate ? 
  hide/block it . 
  pharah ultimate ? 
  she is a sitting duck while channeling it . 
  just los or block it . 
  tracer 's granade ? 
  it is pretty hard to land , since for a 100 kill it needs to stick to it ; s target , it also wont kilkl tanks . 
  against a good junkrat ( trap ) or mcree she wont even get a chance to get close as she will instantly get flashbanged and killed . 
  hanzo 's dragon ? 
  you can hear him wind it up and it is pretty slow , it is just a matter of getting out of it 's way . 
  so yeah , it kind of feels you are coming up with excuses just for the sake of it . 
  we have a meme of sorts about it over here . 
  it goes more or less like this :, 
  `` hello !? 
  police !?
