  the system we have right now just seems to have gotten overly tangled by adding layers upon layers upon layers of difficulties . 
  i am all for mythic + as it seems like a refreshing bit of content , what i am not ok with is 4 difficulties of raids , 2 are max i can stomach . 
  people complaining about shipping/pandering to tumblr were labeled as the vocal minority . 
  she was waaaaaaaaaay toned down in the show ( did n't even have her powers , replaced with a tech device ) , its clear that the original showrunners ( as well as the current , to some extent ) had that she could have her own long journey towards the full time badassery as in seasons 1 and 2 she was just a civilian and picked up her mantle in s3 . 
  some people complained about her being a shitty fighter , even though he was a rookie and was learning basically on the streets while making great improvements , if the show gave her enough time and attention ( instead of shipping ) she would have become something better ... something greater than what she already shaped to be . 
  [ also , technically , they killed the canary twice and killed lance 2 lance family members 2 times , just sayin . 
  ] ( / spoiler ), 
  edit : oh , also did i mention that they probably killed her off as a part of tumbr pandering since she was a threat to the ship ? 
  few loud people who use actual bots to brigade their agenda , mind you . 
  its not a problem of perception of difficulties but the fact that the ammount of them causes the item level to grow so damn fast causing a stupid amount of power creep . 
  for example :, 
  in tbc an [ item ] ( http://www.wowhead.com/item=27447/bracers-of-just-rewards ) from a 5 man heroic would be ilvl 115 which is only 10 item levels lower than [ items dropping in karazhan ( 125 ilvl ) ] ( http://www.wowhead.com/item=28773/gorehowl ) . 
  karazhan itself is only 26 item levels behind [ black temple ( ilvl 151 ) ] ( http://www.wowhead.com/item=32500/crystal-spire-of-karabor ) which is only surpassed by sunwell moving the ceiling up by 13 to [ 164 ilvl ] ( http://www.wowhead.com/item=34241/cloak-of-unforgivable-sin ), 
  now compare it to warlords :, 
  [ 5 man heroic gear ( 630 ) ] ( http://www.wowhead.com/item=109765/golems-gleaming-eye&amp;bonus=524 ) moves by 25 ( the difference between t4 and t6 !!! ), 
  in [ highmaul normal ] ( http://www.wowhead.com/item=113591/the-bladefist&amp;bonus=0 ), 
  from which you can go up by ** 80 ** to [ archimonde mythic at 735 ilvl ] ( http://www.wowhead.com/item=124372/gavel-of-the-eredar&amp;bonus=567 ) ( that may or may not include warforged/valor upgrade ), 
  now to put it into perspective , the difference between warlord 's 5 man heroic item at ilvl 630 and archimonde mythic drop at lvl 735 is 105 ilvls . 
  if you add 105 to 115 , the result is 220 , which is higher than [ naxx25 gear ] ( http://www.wowhead.com/item=40301/cincture-of-polarity ) at 213 ilvl . 
  to summarize in wod you went from [ this ] ( http://www.wowhead.com/item=27447/bracers-of-just-rewards ) to [ this ] ( http://www.wowhead.com/item=40301/cincture-of-polarity ) in amatter of an 1 expansion , basically acquiring what should be legion ilvl by the good old standards . 
  seriously , the power disparity grew a bit too big between the start and the end of the expansion , which in my opinion hurts the casual player more than it did in the old days . 
  sure , you did n't get to do much raiding back in the day , but raiding back then was n't the only thing you could do and even if you did n't , your character was n't as handicapped as it is now if you still do not want to do raids , you were merely running in 5 man hc gear when some raiders were running around with highmaul normal gear . 
  theory crafting and min maxing is still here , and 4 piece bonuses are much needed for most of the classes , still . 
  the whole fact those zones are necessary for new players is , in my opinion , a problem . 
  it causes the expansion to eat it 's own tail since it invalidates the early content to a degree . 
  while on the topic of timless isle and tanaan , i guess the former had it 's fans , while the jungle is widely , straight up , despised . 
  i can only provide my own subjective opinion on the matter . 
  both zones , to me , are tedious and repetitive grind that turns off a lot of people ( at least in my social circles after i asked around people who tried starting at the later stages of the expansions ) . 
  if someone wants to do raiding , he should not be forced into ( up to ) week worth of grinding fill up the bar , repetitive quests or grinding mobs . 
  instead one should be able to experience the expansion from ground up , even if he starts late . 
  as for alts , people should be able to buy boa epics on the lvl of previous tier or something alike to use on their alts . 
  there are already hints and possible confirmations that arrow will straight up ignore what is happening on flash , i am ready to believe it unless we get news that the showrunners got fired . 
  it just feels like repeating the same ( at it 's core , i know mechanics can add on top of each other changing it drastically ) thing over and over again with just 3 different flavors . 
  it just gets repetitive when it comes to aesthetics , at least . 
  the problem with the dungeons is created by the community , imho . 
  mythic dungeons are something like this , in a away , although people require ilvl a tad bit too high to run them . 
  685 + ilvl can do those , just cant ignore the mechanics . 
  same thing happened in pit of saron etc. 
  but i digress , guilds should be the fundament of social gameplay in the game , but it has diminished over the years . 
  the zone you are referring to is the sunwell isle ( quel ` danas ) , while it had a catchup system , it did n't straight up allow you to gear up from head to toes with pre-current content gear . 
  what 2.4.3 offered was a dungeon with better drops and new boj vendor - allowing to trade in ** currency you acquired while doing all of the 5 man heroics ** to get slightly better gear , since the gap was n't as enormous as it is today , a piece from that vendor or dungeon worked well with `` old '' heroic gear because the latter did n't feel as if it was dragging you down , not by a significant amount , at least . 
  i know how wiping works and influences you , i have raided myself since tbc , got as far as to archimonde and brutalus . 
  my main point is that having to slog through more than 1 difficulty ( assuming that you have some progress level wiping on each one ) accelerates the process of burnout , it happened to my guild since i raid now more casually than hardcore . 
  we went slowly through normal hfc for like 2 weeks and ended up on some choke points , then went into heroic and got the serious-ammount of wipes bosses like xhul and manno and people just started to burn out sooner than they would if it was the first time we hit that boss/wall . 
  so , do you want the experience or the loot ? 
  or both ? 
  if you refer to my post talking about item level bloat , you would see that if the amount of difficulties would get reduced the gap between lfr and high end gear would not hurt the lfr player as much as it does now , while not undermining the achievement of a mythic raider . 
  since the start of the expansion , you just need to complete the raid once on any difficulty and meet the proper requirements of both ships/followers , you will get a mission each week or so for a box with a random loot piece from the raid you completed , from the same or lower difficulty . 
  those items do not include weapons and tier pieces . 
  ilvl straight up causes the damage/healing gap , since the higher ilvl , the higher the stats on the item , simple as that . 
  if ilvl would grow slower , the damage/healing would increase at a slower rate as well , it would still increase , the dps wouldnt jump from 20k to 120k , instead it may be like 50k tops . 
  with the shippers around , i would rather the character to be gone , just to be safe . 
  good point !, 
  you see , i perceive mythic + as refreshing in a way for it to be an alternative to raiding while also having a different approach at the idea of dungeons and trying to implement the idea of greater rifts from diablo into the game , the dungeon should be different from start to finish due to the added effects from the keys . 
  call me hypocrite , but i 'd take this over `` easier '' versions being put first . 
  aside from that the drops seem to be parallel ilvl to raiding gear , rather than higher or lower . 
  exactly , there is no point in having sex with someone you do not want to just for the sake of the deed . 
  * que james bond theme *, 
  what ? 
  it also works . 
  or just could n't hit you through tiniest cracks with stupid accuracy , i do n't think tf2 turrets did it . 
  i found that most people who say this think so because it 's not f2p . 
  also , in the second screen i am convinced this is an grenade launcher not and rpg as they call it in the panels ... 
  next thing he goes bald and comes home to felicity fucking other guy . 
  which she will shrug off and they both will move one with their everyday life . 
  just came back from the cinema , she said she is only half orc , nothing about being human . 
  well , in original warcraft ( 1 , not sure about 2 ) games , burning legion was n't mentioned either , the movie seems to hold onto that . 
  legion will be explained in the possible sequel 's when it will be more relevant to the plot . 
  meh , i can bear her voice when its not a cry/drama/arrow voice ( its different than regular it seems in all respects ) as well as when she has her natural look , not the add 10 to 20 years make-up/photoshop/other they use on her in arrow . 
  so far its a flop . 
  i mean , he is the lead on the show , he could get to be a bit outspoken , its not that they can just recast him . 
  i do this with , 2 already . 
  3 widows a charm . 
  d , va is my answer to this comp , i just walk over torbs and their turrets . 
  yup , i have those swings going from ok to fucking depressed every now and then , when the depressed mood swings i just end up paralysed and start to isolate myself from friends/family . 
  although i learned to live with it and when it gets bad i juatreduce the damage by just shutting up . 
  this gives me so e hope that he can control his age , i like human an old man , but would love to see him as not-old logan again . 
  age him so jack an can retire from the role and get x-23 to replace him ? 
  hey look !, 
  a rock with snow on it !, 
  on top of that she knew draenei language , which may imply her being half draenei . 
  i have a polar opposite of a sentiment , i just love the idea of hunter + pet at most of the times and i am glad there is a ** choice ** for mm , although i agree that for the particular spec i would use it mostly outdoors . 
  why would you ? 
  you can buy cheaper potatoes at grocery stores . 
  you will get full game after you buy all the dlcs . 
  i mean , felicity has to go somewhere when arrow is done , they cant really abandon such a great character . 
  watch season 2 and season 3 up to `` the climb '' and you could watch like 2 or 3 more episodes if you just watch the side character story arc scenes . 
  nah , then they will fight eachother , like they do in the middle east since few decades . 
  it was never said she 's half human , it has been said that she is only half orc . 
  the name is kind of a small reference to an old favourite pvp video of mine , http://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=47020, 
  as for gerona i kind of paid attention to what they said about her , it is worth noting she knew draenei language at the start of the movie , which may imply . 
  her being half draenei . 
  with that said , can you imagine how fucked up must have been the videogames in middle ages ? 
  shit was crazy back then yo . 
  well , damn . 
  same here , what even makes it worse is the realisation that i will have to spend all that time alone , it just seems to be easier with company . 
  quite an interesting project . 
  reminds me of the times i pushed just a bit over the chokepoint on anubis so my team could go safely into the sideways , instead they just dance at the chokepoint ... and dont even get me started on zenyatta ults . 
  the key is to be one yourself . 
  iits easy , you walk up to the enemy team and go like this : * have you heard about our lord and savior ragnaros ?
