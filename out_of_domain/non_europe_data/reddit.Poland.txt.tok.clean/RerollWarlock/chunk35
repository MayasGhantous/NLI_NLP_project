  to me , not being f2p is a blessing , imagine having to grind for a week or two just to be able to play mercy or something along those lines ? 
  so , a ticket refund law to go with it ? 
  not sure if serious or ... then again , if you look at ** some ** female streamers on twitch , this seems like quite a possibility . 
  wait , what ? 
  wait , so if rf and flash became fridges due to barry 's time fuckery , does that mean laurel is inside one of them since she got fridged ? 
  do n't spend it on rp . 
  optional , you can acquire them by playing . 
  lootboxes drop each level , xp cap is 22k which is about 60/90 minutes worth of playtime , also known as a match of league of legends . 
  also , blizzard will switch it around if it does n't work for the next season , like they did for hots , no biggie , they can admit being wrong . 
  as for longevity of overwatch , there is a lengthy [ forum post by jeff kapplan ] ( http://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20745285677#post-12 ) talking about future of the game and planned updates . 
  from what he says , i would assume the game will do just fine . 
  all the leveling changes give me hope that they are cleaning it up for a revamp that will allow you to scale through respective brackets the same way we will do on broken isles . 
  true , at max level we should be able to do it . 
  and runes . 
  its as if world did n't end on korea/asia !, 
  west is affected badly by promoting playing with friends . 
  league tends to bring out the worst in people and ruins friendships , not for everyone but still for many people . 
  i am one of those people , and because of that i 'd rather play alone . 
  people get bored with league after 6 + years , simple as that . 
  dynamic queue is just a scapegoat they can point at . 
  warcraft 3 by the chinese , but that generalises it a bit more to asians . 
  yup , they seem to be creative with the abilities as they do in mobas , but when it comes to 3d awareness/aim , koreans do not look all that great . 
  much cooler !? 
  we get to build our own garrison !? 
  some people here just prefer a poorly written character to be written off of a show since it impacts it negatively . 
  yes , by writing off i mean killed off . 
  now , compare it to the shippers who straight up harass real people in real life to us who just want a fictional character killed off . 
  noone here condones harassment of ebr , while guggenheim mostly gets shit flung towards him due to him being a straight up hypocrite . 
  `` in russia , game plays you . '', 
  speaking of stats , what is a go to place to read some of that sweet , sweet theorycrafting these days ? 
  ej seems to be down , sadly . 
  i mean , could n't felicity just date laurel ? 
  we would still have a vigilante lawyer and felicity would have a love triangle . 
  felicity moves to the flash . 
  this . 
  last time a woman was attracted to me was when i was around 16 , now i am about to turn 24 ... feelsbadman . 
  what i mean is , that i ** kind of ** have a sample of how interest in my person should lok like , and i damn well know there is none right now . 
  ashamed of what exactly ? 
  i did n't vote for the ruling party , i voted for someone else . 
  i have no control over what the government is doing . 
  oh , trust me there are more in the works ( some are actually done and posted on a proper website for them ) , ill post more on reddit whenever i have the sizeable batch done . 
  as for your suggestions , i 'll have to look up fakes for moira 's actress . 
  as for psylocke , munn 's fakes are slightly hard to come by , but i think that i have some stored for the future use . 
  eh , i guess cave johnson is the role model of american corporate eccentric gray moral area villain i want to portrait the boss as . 
  could you rephrase that in english ? 
  you sadly butchered whatever you tried to say in polish . 
  it was n't that bad , you just need to take into account semantic/cultural difference of language . 
  as in , you translated the sentence directly from english , in which it makes perfect sense , i just wanted to make sure we do not misunderstand each other . 
  as for the topic at hand , contrary to the popular belief homosexuals and/or people of color are not treated badly in poland . 
  yes , incidents do happen , but i would mark them as incidents involving local equivalent of rednecks . 
  when it comes to the politics , many people ( myself included ) lost all trust for mainstream movements and names , while there are few fresh/young ones to rise in recent years and even if they do , the trust issues are still in play since the new names/parties are unproven . 
  with all that said , there are movements that openly oppose pis , organizing protests and all that ( kod/razem ) and they seem to have a decently sized following . 
   it 's the same in the usa as far as tolerance goes , but with the addition of legal protections, 
  i just believe that most people here do not really care about your skin color or sexuality , they did n't use to care up until lately and i still think its not a big deal , everybody 's human . 
  with that said , i believe that any hostile actions against lgbt can be dealt with using the current law , there is no need to make a special case out of it . 
  as for kod , they seem really shady , but then again its just an opinion , which would require lengthy explanation regarding previous and current government . 
  champion portraits increase toxicity by 15 % !, 
  lets just say that comparing poland to usa is kind of pointless , things just do not work the same and the general mindset and attitude of people is different . 
  i just opened character creation to try this , got instantly redirected to dh , lol . 
  yeah , it felt extra weird and frustrating while testing on 200ms , i could n't get the rhythm just right . 
  the spec surely could use something more , although it 's ( barely ) passable . 
  i may consider leveling and raiding in mm , but the vision of aimed shot with a cast time is kind of meh . 
  as for sure , fuck it because it 's meele . 
  my personal impression is that since , from what i 've read here and there , ebr is shy and has anxiety issues , he may feel obliged to help her out . 
  it 's a stretch but people did dumber things . 
  it 's most likely going to happen in season 5 anyway . 
  if that 's the case , why did n't make laurel play a bigger role to keep the same tone and profile of the show !, 
  where i live ( eastern eu ) , social interaction at workplace is , indirectly , forbidden by the employer on many occasions . 
  that ofcourse is limited to the workplace . 
  quoting piccolo : * why did n't you dooodge !? 
  the tension before battle was real , if had a knife at hand i would be able to cut air . 
  went full rick grimes . 
  i gdniuenly clenched a bit inside , i felt as if i was suffocating as well . 
  and i wanted to fix it with an edit . 
  now its staying the way it is . 
  edit : i was also the first , i gues my tablet autocrrect remembers a typo . 
  it just hit home for me really hard since i visit metal concerts and festivals to join the moshes , its hard enough to breath in a regular crowd sometimes and panic stampede is one of the biggest fears while being there . 
  and he is more accurate and deal more damage !, 
  holy shit , what if in the flashing laurel was on the ship with oliver , he died , she survived and due to the shit that happened with magic got her powers and after five years on a hellish island she came back to be the black canary ? 
  i mean a gets could download itself through extraneous to the arcane somehow , or something along these lines . 
  and then since they respect the choice they decide to forget about the undertaking as well . 
  the program started in secret after the ending of me1 and finished before the start/ending of me3 ? 
  fucking really !? 
  lmao . 
  why would you hurt yourself like that ? 
  to be honest , the amount of those posts and the fact they get to to the front page indicates that ** quite a few people are not enjoying the game . 
  ** on top of that , most of them are well constructed and are n't just `` game sucks , rito fix '' . 
   worlds viewing statistics have only shown to be increasing . 
  i heard conflicting reports on that matter , way before the influx of negativity towards league started some sources stated that it actually decreased , be it in the west or in general . 
  i 'd have to redo my research to be sure tho . 
   any game having as long a run as league has will have ups and downs in population though , so i think it 's too early to read anything into that . 
  so far most of the games ( prime example world of warcraft ) with such a long run just decline or `` normalize '' letting new top dog take it 's place . 
  the game wo n't die , it just wont be the biggest one around anymore , which imho is a good thing . 
  looking at wod , it seems like a slow sadistic kill . 
  most likely a placeholder number .
