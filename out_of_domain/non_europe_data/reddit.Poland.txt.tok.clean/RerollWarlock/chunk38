  also the same people that decided that after so many expansions non-melee hunters forgot to trap . 
  i would love my hat remain different if the walk animation was not wonky as hell when it gets changed into a different pet . 
  i 'd rather this polarizing comparison :, 
  s1 : the black driver, 
  s4 : the white knight, 
  another thing i wish there was in place is that the class sets should be unlocked account wide . 
  let 's say that my main has a whole set unlocked with relevant achievements and then i level my alt , i could buy the said set and or upgrade patches for it from the vendor right away and that would be quite useful on top of ak . 
  then again , shared reps would be nice , since some provide you with decent items to start the game with but not too good ones after the time you reach revered with the said reps. 
  i know right ? 
  mm is not the worst to play but just does not interest me as much as the idea of actually utilizing my pets that i spent tons of time taming . 
  i wish blizzard would address the focus issues that plague the spec on single target fights , although i believe it will even out with gear as we will gain more haste . 
  my solution ? 
  slightly reduce focus cost on cobra shot and we should get a nice boost in st dps . 
  anyway , i still hope that blizzard will stay true to their word and actually try to even out the dps chart . 
  what if . 
  ** what if ? 
  ** they put laurel in as a hint/reveal that she will be coming back permanently in some form !? 
  bang , birds of prey spinoff without guggenheim and mrs. 
  desperate housewives involved . 
  how about sending a scout/messenger saying `` hey , i am on your side and i am doing something important , please do n't fuck this up for me . '', 
  to the horde and alliance ? 
  at least your group knew where the portal to vh is ... 
  sure that would require more , like not showing hostility and all that but an envoy is a start . 
  but yeah , with the train of thought we could apply it to real politics and ask why no one invaded russia yet since they do all the military experiments and stuff and fuck shit up in syria and ukraine . 
  its just not as simple . 
  i 'll go back to my analogy with russia . 
  russia as a country did and still does questionable , to say the least , things and yet somehow diplomatic contacts with the country or their leader have not been severed . 
  why ? 
  because russia has some resources that the rest of the world needs . 
  what does illidan offer ** beside ** his super secret plan ? 
  he provides a way to fight legion effectively and a trained military force just for that purpose . 
  really , what stops people in fiction from at least trying to communicate , i do n't mean for it to be successful just for them to try . 
  yes , the russian analogy is more complex , but as i will stick to it , no one knows about secret projects that the russian military works on and yet they have a diplomatic relationship with other big players in the world , so to speak . 
  it is important to not read too deep into that comparison to make it understandable on a basic level . 
  ( although the fact that illidan 's foreign politics are not complex could be seen as a writing flaw . ), 
  with that said , the ** night elves ** imprisoned illidan , not the blood elves , not any of the other races . 
  he would be fine contacting the horde alone , or humans or well . . 
  anyone but them , there is no need to reveal his grand scheme to stop the legion , it is about not showing i 'll intentions towards the horde and alliance . 
  and the fox mount q item has a chance to drop in the chest ... 
  so i also keep doing that . 
  stick to icy veins priority , after you get some 840 + gear , get simcraft and let it calculate start weights for you . 
  it even makes a pawn string to go with proper weights . 
  according to wowhead, 
   the invitation can appear from multiple sources , including :, 
   nightborne caches, 
   withered army training scenario, 
   the invitation starts a quest chain that will net you a llothien prowler . 
  that 's exactly it , and simcraft can generate you a simple i port for the said addon , personalised for your character . 
  also appearently only meele hunters know how to trap !, 
  such fantasy much class . 
  no but seeing someone make a picture of a screen instead of an actual screenshot is like watching someone try to cut their fingernails with a knife . 
  gladly , we are in a fantasy setting !, 
  but , just placing a regular frost trap ? 
  explosive trap ? 
  even shooting them ? 
  so young , so naive ... 
  i did say the same thing around the same time and people actually were n't as reluctant to agree . 
  yeah , its so hard to find common topics with people these days , especially as a gamer it seems . 
  people are very reluctant to discuss gaming face to face . 
  it makes me wonder , did the inquisition manage to break alleria or did she escape ? 
  it seems like the first option is more likely . 
  i think you underestimate some people 's persistence . 
  did you see meredil camping groups ? 
  bunch of guys at a flight path , another bunch in the village and another at the graveyard its really hard to get away . 
  aww , a date went bad ? 
  i wish they wrote a book with her as a main character , i would read the crap out of it even if it was 500 pages of her just handing out bounty caches and narrating world quests . 
  there is a comic that covers that already , though . 
  it 's possible but takes some extra effort and patience as well as a hefty bit of luck . 
  i know a few successful couples that met in games . 
  but it 's worth noting that searching a partner exclusively online is not a good plan . 
  you should keep trying irl just for the sake of experience with people . 
  that 's not wrong , but being fit is half of the success , you still need a place to meet people at , not everyone is interested in sports . 
  at least you were not polish while watching x-men : apocalypse , the polish in he magneto subplot had a thick american accent , ugh ... 
  yep , and fefe 's involvement in the plot is still too big for my liking . 
  like , when she has to talk down oliver from `` stop being assholes to your new buddies '' . 
  surely mr. smoak is somewhere in there . 
  same thing , my fps increased in general as i play on an aging rig . 
  men for serious use , great for soloing old content and work!d stuff . 
  depends on the spec and level and affixes really . 
  position him in the corner to his left , it works!ed for me at least . 
  bm hunter here , people say that marksman is way better , let it be . 
  i still top the masters on many occasions . 
  it 's highly suggested that you open with crows . 
  in other words :, 
  crows \u2265 pop bw \u2265 = wild \u2265 kc, 
  it 's also worth to note that lining up bestial wrath and aspect of the wild ** can ** be better than just throwing them up randomly . 
  you just need to keep in mind that you should not delay either too much , special bw . 
  i am quite hyped to get to know about everything new from blizzard , my main focus being wow and overwatch obviously but doable also seems promising this year 's if any of the rumours are true . 
  i am at 72,81 % mastery myself ( which is funny since before getting raid gear i was at around 100 % . 
  but i guess the [ trinket ] ( http://www.wowhead.com/item=137367/stormsinger-fulmination-charge&amp;bonus=1502:3410 ) makes up for it somehow . 
  or we go to argus and make a foothold there for something to go wrong . 
  but considering that kj will probably bite the dust , the legion will be at quite the disarray ... 
  i 'd spend that much on a game if the currency conversion was not crap for my country . 
  lets just say i would pay a local equivalent of 100 + . 
  skyrim is a bad example because of the variety of ways it can be played , and of course mods . 
  that explains why i am almost the reverse wolverine ... 
  pets get stuck in the cage after getting on the ship in maw , quite annoying . 
  stand up for yourself . 
  works for me , gets people to shut up . 
  especially when you know exactly what you are doing and avoid doing any extra pulling .
