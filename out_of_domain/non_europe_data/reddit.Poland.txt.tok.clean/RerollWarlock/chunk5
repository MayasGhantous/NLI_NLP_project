  it was all shady , and unclear on who did that . 
  appearently some people from my class got blamed , based on anonymous calls and notes . 
  yet no charges or punishements were given since there were no real proofs . 
  was n't it even stated that 70 at that time wasnt that old at all ? 
  like some guy reached 130 years old in the bible . 
  talking snakes aside . 
  13 years old person is the most probable thing in bible imho , i dont really have much knowledge of it since i am not into christianity and such , but think about it that way . 
  during the events described in old testament there was no advanced healthcare hell ther was barely any health care at all , so thanks to the natural selection the strongest and the most resistat organisms survived , hence i fidn it probable that someone could live to that age back then . 
  what ? 
  oh man so much more exciting than it is nowdays for some reason !, 
  i had kinda the idea that would work mainly for supports :, 
  `` bounty '' mastery : each time a ward reveals an enemy player that wasnt visible due to fog of war or invisibility for more than 30 seconds , the player that planted the ward recieves ~ 30 gold . 
  in other words i believe it would be a nice replacer/alternative to scout . 
  * `` learn to english noob . 
  '' * - enemy 's response . 
  that i really hate my lfe . 
  when someone asks me how do i see my life in about 10 years i just say that probably i will kill myself by that time . 
  you are invited to go outside . 
  i kinda got to like her she did what had to be done and had some good character development to go along with it . 
  when he started to redem herself by admitting what did she do wrong ... she got killed off which i hate . 
  come to think about it that is the worst tendecy in lost - to kill characters with big potential waay too early . 
  ( i am looking at you mr. eko ), 
  oh man , think about the directin of the show if they havent left !, 
  oh god , walked straight into this one . 
  bring yout own damn pencil !, 
  say what ? 
  same here altough i have it a little different . 
  i managed to make some firends during the end of hishschool , pretty close ones to be honest . 
  but they all kind of moved on because they have met their current sos not a while back and kinda spend most of their times with them ( which is reasonable ) , and that kinda feels me even worse than before i met them . 
  new year 's eve is coming now and i kinda wanted to hang out with some firneds for a change , go to a party with them or something , but then i realized that it wont work since seeing them with their sos makes me really sad and i dont feel like going anywhere on my own . 
  the problem with those items is often that you just dont have the gold to buy them rather than them being bad , i would sometimes like to buy ohm wrecker during the laning phase , but i jst ca n't pull out so much gold to get it . 
  also , those items often consume your gp5 items making you fall behind . 
  it could go both ways . 
  i could be honest to girls ilike and maybe finally get hooked up with one . 
  or freak everhone away from me . 
  it would be fun to have a chaotic-good type of regular on the show and he fits perfectly . 
  killing him off sounds like a bad idea to me in general . 
  its more likely a bait to m\u0105k\u0119 tom reveal his intentions . 
  but there wont be as much cheering on the ward kills since there wont be as many .

  her father is involved . 
  he puts her through some of her trials that are mentioned in the show . 
  him being a excentric milionaire that wanted to have a son i stead is just an excuse . 
  or chain e on yourself into successsfull w on enem followed by mantra q 1 second before the snare lands , which is now stupidly easy to hit since you are now next to a slowed target . 
  i have to wait minutes !, 
  minutes !,

  lets wait for some sfm gifs inspired by this ... xd, 
  cataclysmix lighting storms are awesome to wqtch . 
  i hve something similiar . 
  bu in my case i assume that i may be in coma or reliving my life in last few secondw of brain activity while dieing . 
  man i am starting to hate ai kids , first mass effect 3 , now this really do they need to turn out the same every time ? 
  now get shep 's va to record that . 
  i just hope that utility supports wont be left in their current state , i seem to enjoy them a bit more than ap bruisers or tanks bottom . 
  that moment of silence after a moment of good conversation . 
  someone joining you in spontainous laughter . 
  honestly i believe that ted would finnally commit suicide at one point . 
  i mean really , he takes being single kinda too serious and is constantly bummed because of it ( besides like last two seasons ) , in a more real scenario he would probably depressed at least because of so many failures and fuck ups in his life . 
  well i wont repeat my comment to from above . 
  but imho a real person in ted 's situation would be kinda more misurabe . 
  specially while obssesed so much with his lovelife . 
  not , just reddit . 
  interned in genera\u0142 id say . 
  there would still be barney . 
  i mean the show focuses on him anywy since like 3 seasons anyway . 
  ues i am late for the party , so ill just leave that here ... 
  i have problems with my feelings , the ways i feel towards people . 
  i feel lonely most of the time . 
  i am aftaid that if i ever manage to hook with a girl ill end up like chris brown . 
  tl ; dr i am a clasic schmosby afraid of turning into chris brown . 
  while he was not a biggest actor , his death to me is like a death of a person i know from seeing from time to time that i got to respect/think good about . 
  it 's like hearing that a comon friend died quite shocking that you wont bump into this nice guy anymore while going to watch fnf .

  after playing videogame y. fortunately he gets stopped by active smoker and drinker who only watches tv . 
  8 days a week, 
  same here . 
  i am just afraid that if i ever get to start a family ill end up lik him . 
  if he gets boored of league he can always act in porn , the bjergsen vid is just the proof of his pure talent . 
  what if the point of that question was to determine everyone 's least favourite number above 8 !, 
  that may sound cold , but maybe you should .

  spec . 
  and n\u00f3w you post it on reddit , thats kind of risky . 
  dont you think ? 
  this . 
  when you ar\u0119 feeling bad those songs sound like they were teling yoou that you dont have anyone to cheer you up , while other people do . 
  highjacking this comment to ask . 
  can riot just make an application that checks stability of given players pc/internet connection that would be somehow foolproof ? 
  ( and create encrypted log to upload later ) it could be used as some kind of evidence in such cases . 
  you wouldnt steal a dragon . 
  you wouldnt steal a golem . 
  you wouldnt steal a red buff .
