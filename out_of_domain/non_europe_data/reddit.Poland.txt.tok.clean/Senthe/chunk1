i 've played about 300 games in teambuilder solo queue on levels 20-30 , mainly with adc and support . 
  i do n't care about :, 
  - waiting, 
  - mirrors, 
  - no draft , no bans, 
  what i do care about is ** retarded matchmaking ** . 
  from 10 games i 've played recently i 've lost 9 . 
  not because i 'm so bad ( altough i 've just got my lvl 30 so i think i 'm not really good either ) ; i 've got series 9/10 wins also . 
  i 've lost these games just because i 've got matched with ridiculously better teams , like :, 
  ** lvl 24 , lvl 28 , gold iii , silver ii , unranked **, 
  ** lvl 15 , platinum iii , platinum v , gold iv , silver ii in opponents team **, 
  in lot of these cases i 've played games like ** all solo q vs 4 premades ** . 
  and that was n't just a single game . 
  i 've got a lot of them . 
  of course in some cases it was my team which was significantly better , and that did n't really improve my gaming experience either . 
  ( that have n't happen for me for some time now tho . ), 
  do n't miss my point - ** i 'm not upset about losing . 
  i 'm upset about playing with no chance to win ** just because the other team is better and there 's nothing to do about that besides surr at 20 . 
  that 's even more frustrating when you 're a support and expect your team to carry you - but who is there to carry when they are just losing lanes to clearly better players . 
  before you start talking about better team comp etc. 
  please consider if it 's really this significant on lvl 20 vs gold ii lane . 
  and there 's no reason for teambuilder matchmaking to be like that . 
  you could just swap some players in these teams to make them even . 
  i suppose that is what happens in other game modes when you get 10 players together and split them evenly . 
  but since in teambuilder it 's the player who chooses his team , there 's no way to do that . 
  the only way to fix teambuilder matchmaking is to have more teams playing on the same time . 
  i have no doubts that i 've got all these terrible matchups just because there were n't any better at the moment and rito did n't want us to wait forever for an even match . 
  ( altough i personally would prefer to wait longer and have a better game ; in fact that 's the reason i use tb instead of other modes ) . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** teambuilder matchmaking is retarded and unfair . 
  it can be fixed only if a ) there is more teams playing in tb so they can be better matched b ) rito would let us wait for a match longer to get a better one ( assuming that tb is there for get a better game at cost of longer waiting time ) .

  if you get bad kda and low gold , try to improve your mechanics , avoid being killed , dodge skillshots , trade better . 
  if you get fine kda and gold , try to be sure you have relevant builds . 
  if your kda and builds are fine , ward more ( try to predict ganks , teamfights in jungle , dragon , baron , buffs picks ) . 
  if you have nice kda and builds and ward a lot and you are still losing , it means that basically you ca n't into winning the game under normal conditions . 
  here are possible reasons :, 
  * chasing kills instead of pushing objectives, 
  * surrender after losing lane, 
  * not communicating to your teammates, 
  * not exploiting enemys weakneses, 
  how to improve in that case :, 
  * ping while you can about anything, 
  * write about ults , flashes , jungler location etc. 
  * try to take advantage of team comps and builds through the game, 
  * try to push more objectives instead of kills ( and convince your team to do so ), 
  * do n't surrender too early if your team is really trying, 
  as a support main you can also :, 
  * protect suicidal teammates, 
  * ward even more, 
  * roam even more, 
  * carry your carry, 
  * get enemy focus ( focused support = happy support ), 
  try to observe how players are behaving through the game and identify who to kill , who to protect and who to be afraid of . 
  and always inform your team about your thoughts . 
  be a shot caller or try to follow one . 
  btw for carrying as a support i recommend janna and leona . 
  i 'm reading these comments and getting frightened . 
  are there any not bugged as fuck champions left ? 
  if you won , you did well . 
  even if you were carried , you did n't throw the game . 
  if you lost , you did badly . 
  always assume that you could do better regardless of your team . 
  exception : in case of trolls/afkers/dcs / intentional feeders - when all players are n't really trying to win - game does n't count . 
  i am unranked , hit my lvl 30 maybe two weeks ago , i 'm playing only teambuilder normals . 
  i would probably be ranked high bronze/silver thanks to my diamond boyfriend . 
  i 've mained tristana , tried mid and jungle but now i stick to the support role . 
  believe me i know something about carrying games in low elo . 
  i disagree with your point that ** `` if you performed well and lose , it 's fault of 4 other guys '' ** . 
  you 're getting that entirely wrong . 
  let me explain . 
  league is a team game . 
  that means that you 're not an individual whose entire purpose is to perform well . 
  you should n't try to get nice kda . 
  you should n't try to put proper wards right in time . 
  you should n't try to do some nice ganks and invades . 
  you should try to get your team to win . 
  there are multiple ways to do that and clicking around and doing things is only one of them . 
  league is not about doing things but rather about ** helping your team to make right decisions ** . 
  it 's super important on low elo to stay sure that everyone is aware what is going on . 
  so ping , ward , write about ults , flashes , buffs , enemy jungler - help your team to get all the information they could need to perform better and do right things . 
  if someone is doing badly , do n't rage , try to give them advices : buy mr , stay under turret , just shield and run , buy pink ward , go roam mid , ward buff . 
  i found that in low elo people generally are willing to follow someone who tells them ** how to fix mistakes ** , not only `` omg feeder stop dying noob reported '' . 
  exploit enemy team weakneses ** as a team ** . 
  i 've had a game where enemy lux `` support '' did n't even buy sighstone and went full ap . 
  so i let my team to know that opponents have no vision . 
  did n't matter that their jungler was diamond and lux could delete me ( janna ) in one second ; they were mindlessly pushing mid with all the damage , so we just def mid and took all the dragons , buffs and barons , splitpushing while knowing exactly when they were coming to top or bot . 
  about op question , i generally believe that on low elo support has much more influence on the game than adc . 
  but it does n't really matter who feeds , botlane is about cooperating well . 
  support does n't poke , trades are worse . 
  support pokes too much , adc is unprotected . 
  adc does n't follow , support dies/lose exhaust/mana for nothing . 
  adc follows too much , ends up dying . 
  and so on . 
  who exactly dies at the very end is not important . 
  as an adc/support ** you have to cooperate with your lane partner ** . 
  that said , if he 's aggresive , try to follow . 
  if he 's passive , try to follow . 
  if he 's doing mistakes , tell him how to fix them and try to carry him through them ( pushing too much ? 
  ward the hell out of it , try to locate enemy jungler on map . 
  not enough pushing ?
