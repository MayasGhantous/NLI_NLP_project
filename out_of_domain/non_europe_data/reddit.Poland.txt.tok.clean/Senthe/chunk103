  it 's not impossible to get as much in donations if what you do is seriously valuable , even if you do n't ask for them as often as wikimedia . 
  on average they spend 15 minutes in early and froggen also on average spends 15 minutes in early . 
  it does n't matter if they play 1 or 1000 games , this is what the word average means . 
  dpm does n't necessarily get higher in lategame . 
  you spend more time on positioning and not constant trading and fighting in comparison to midgame . 
  also this game length difference [ ca n't matter that much in terms of dpm ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/620joj/why_you_shouldnt_judge_league_of_legends_pros/dfjxquk/ ) . 
  what i think really matters here is champs picked , like `` dpm vs dpm expected from the champ '' . 
  ask for donations , sell subscriptions , merchandise , make well targeted and unobtrusive ads . 
  reddit is owned by a huge [ corporation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cond%c3%a9_nast ) and is # 22 most visited website in the world , # 8 alexa rank . 
  nice `` middle range '' example . 
  i want this to exist so much . 
  please , good meme fairy , make this happen . 
  yeah my point was more like `` if you want your site to be free of obtrusive ads , it 's not impossible to fund that . 
  if it truly is impossible , the internet would probably be better off without this site . '', 
  i do n't agree that ads as a source of revenue are necessarily wrong . 
  if someone is fine with ads making money for their favourite site , no problem . 
  personally i block ads everywhere because i do n't like being an object of psychological warfare and surveillance . 
  i also had an [ extension ] ( https://adnauseam.io/ ) that should `` click '' every ad i 'm `` shown '' so the profiling used to spy on people becomes useless , and some of the people who pay for clicks have to pay for that too . 
  sadly it was apparently banned by google in chrome for no reason . 
  maybe i should change the browser . 
  anyway , it 's pretty simple for me . 
  companies that make ads do n't give a fuck about my wellbeing , so why would i give a fuck about theirs ? 
  i thought this is precisely the `` not all ads are scum '' discussion ? 
  i 'm quite lost now . 
  me too thanks, 
  i mean , some dogs are more humane than most babies . 
  so literally camille ? 
  but it 's free . 
  it 's not about money but about credit to the artist . 
  edit : a lot of confused people below . 
  please do n't comment if you do n't understand words `` intellectual property is theft '' . 
  here it is roughly explained : https://www.reddit.com/r/latestagecapitalism/comments/54nlkz/serious_thoughts_on_intellectual_property_and/d83jrkg/, 
  yeah exactly wtf would i even do with one , yet alone two million of dollars ? 
  this is crazy money for one person to own . 
  i could buy a house and basically live happily ever after , which is honestly everything i want from my little life . 
  i 'm pretty sure that if i had millions of dollars i would give away most of that because hoarding money only to have it on my account sounds damn stupid . 
  ( and yeah , in case you wonder , right now i got a job and pay all of my , and not only mine , bills . ), 
  you do n't have to pay to get the intellectual property . 
  so it 's free . 
  as we can clearly see here , you can also rehost the image without any credit , on a site that has ads on its own , and not get into any lawsuit trouble ( which is the case for most if not all webcomics anyway , they seem to be rehosted a ton and artists seem to not give a fuck ) . 
  i do n't know what do you even want from smbc at this point to not be `` thiefs '' ? 
  to stop having a website and a name , in case anyone wants to give the original artist credit for their work ? 
  to stop earning money from their work , because of course we all are able do that in the capitalist world ? 
  dude , i would pm you hentai if i had any . 
  i do n't have to retire at 25 to still be happy and comfortable . 
  i would gladly do some work that brings some money and is actually useful , unlike what i 'm doing now . 
  it 's not about becoming a lazy fuck till the end of your days . 
  money security opens up a lot of new life possibilities that normally you would n't be able to explore . 
  i could follow my interests and passions in my work , instead of always doing what is the most profitable at the moment . 
  you are the confused one here . 
  this is the comment i was refering to . 
  `` intellectual property is theft '' = people who claim ownership of any intellectual property are thiefs , because this way they deny this property from society . 
  it 's the same reasoning as with private property . 
  smbc does n't deny anything from society , their intellectual work is free to access , and they do n't fight anyone over hosting it on another site . 
  therefore the intellectual property condemnation should n't be applied to them . 
  please educate yourself on intellectual property rights by the way , it 's quite fascinating topic . 
  as a web dev i can tell you : say thank you to iphone safari . 
  last time i had to disable zoom in a webapp it was because safari decided to zoom it in on input focus and not zoom out on blur ( which of course led to responsiveness issues because it went from ~ 400px width to ~ 200px ) . 
  i was unable to push that through the tester . 
  other than that shit i agree there 's no real reason to disable zoom . 
  when an input loses focus , it fires `` onblur '' event . 
  he seems to have way more ms than other champs somehow . 
  seriously fuck lee . 
  why is he allowed to be in every game and every meta for years ? 
  why does he have to be rito 's precious snowflake , what 's so special about him ? 
  out with this piece of blind trash . 
  you can remove teemo from the game by buying one 0 gold item ... 
  are you his mother ? 
  because this is the only explanation i could figure out, 
  which was honestly undeserved , there was way more anti-ootay spam than actual ootay . 
  yeah i mean ... it 's not that hard to dodge shit when you have a ms boost ? 
  what do you even know about hate ? 
  it 's not `` yearly '' . 
  it 's all the time , day by day . 
  you kids do n't understand . 
  i was just joking . _ . 
  i 'm so happy i do n't have to literally beg people to buy a trinket upgrade anymore . 
  yup , that 's correct . 
  ; ) welcome to magical world of web development !, 
  of course not only horny boys do that . 
  kids would n't do stupid shit if adults did n't show it to them first , they only repeat what they see . 
  but if you want that kind of `` humor '' to stay , it ( probably ) caters mostly to immature boys or immature people in general . 
  [ rammus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrn2k4efl5g ) ? 
  idk , maybe because making a champ that 's playable for a couple thousands of people while your playerbase is 100 + million is wasteful ? 
  all the pro events like lcs or worlds are only advertisements for actual game . 
  riot 's income comes from microtransactions , esports is a cost . 
  so of course they should aim to make every bit of content in their game accessible to any kind of players and not only good for pros . 
  does n't matter , all that should matter is how good are you in comparison to other people on your level . 
  if all people in your elo are shit but you are a bit less shit you should have positive winrate . 
  on every level of play champion winrates should oscillate in 45-55 % range . 
  ryze has 37-40 % winrate in all elos currently but is still contested in pro play . 
  it 's nonsense . 
  same goes for azir , lb and camille btw , but at least they maintain 44-45 % winrate . 
  at least a draven actually has a good reason to complain . 
  what 's up with that ? 
  once, 
  if you consider a term used since 80s in hundreds of cultural contexts generic then yeah , it is . 
  i mean , literally just read wikipedia . 
  of course they will . 
  awesome , then cdp should trademark `` cyberpunk 2077 '' and not `` cyberpunk '' .
