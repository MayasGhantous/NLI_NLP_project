  ( i still have hope that someone will make a chart service displaying gold , damage , cs etc. 
  at least in 2 , 5 , 10 etc. 
  minutes into the game ), 
  more like nsfl : /, 
  i feel safe and comfortable . 
  i think they can be so expensive only if they are original rubik ( c ) ( tm ) ( zip ) ( omg ) cubes , which i doubt is the case : p . in poland for sure you can get made in china one for like $ 1 or less , wholesale should be a lot cheaper . 
  it 's makers ' post tho, 
  how to win lane in low elo :, 
  * do n't be passive . 
  that 's it . 
  no matter if you play janna or lulu or annie or braum or thresh or whatever you want , stay aggressive , make presence in lane , if not dealing damage , then zoning or baiting skilshots . 
  * always harass when adc comes to lasthit a minion . 
  free damage . 
  * as janna , max shield , harass with shield aa . 
  free damage . 
  * never get poked for free . 
  if you do , you 're doing something wrong . 
  * always look for opportunity to make enemy adc 's life harder . 
  do n't let them farm , zone them with unseen hooks/stuns , make them afraid to coming in your way . 
  * stay in a bush , protect it , maintain vision , deny vision , bush is home , bush is life . 
  * always ward river . 
  unwarded river = you are dead . 
  you do n't want to be dead . 
  * first item sighstone , no exceptions . 
  no exceptions . 
  they wo n't buy it , you have a sweeper , you can be aggressive and keep pushing , you just won any gank , you just won your bush , they are so zoned and/or so dead . 
  how to win midgame in low elo :, 
  * help your team , not only adc . 
  identify the real carry of your game ( adc is shit ? 
  got ta go help midlane ) and help them getting fed, 
  * keep objectives warded, 
  * cry to your team to buy wards ( at least pinks ) and upgrade trinkets until they do, 
  * ward , ward , ward, 
  * ward more, 
  * deep wards win games, 
  * remember that you do n't want to make plays in 5v5 , you want to keep killing this one idiot who goes into warded jungle and gets caught by your team over and over , and prevent your idiot from getting caught, 
  * wards really help, 
  how to win lategame in low elo :, 
  * shotcall , ping , let them know what to do , sometimes people just have no idea where they should be, 
  * keep preventing your idiot from dying, 
  * your real carry at this point is carrying , your job is done here ; go help someone else, 
  * depending on support , just do your job in fights, 
  at any point of the game :, 
  * do n't die . 
  do n't facecheck . 
  be smart . 
  be sneaky . 
  * bait , be annoying and actively make them hate you . 
  * if you get killed , laugh in / all about them focusing support . 
  proceed to do anything you can to make them focus you more , hopefully your dmg carries will kill them first . 
  this is half-serious , but maybe will help you to understand that support is n't this fifth useless guy in team , but its absolutely vital part . 
  janna can be anything from passive to very aggressive in lane . 
  people just so so underestimate ad bonus from the shield and power of autoattacks . 
  you can harass so safely and still make some plays especially during ganks . 
  obviously she 's not raw power like sona or thresh , but being full passive as janna in lane is n't proper attitude imo . 
  also they tend to overextend , so if you can bait them to do so ( e.g. 
  during a gank ) , probably you can pick up a kill . 
  treat wards like something temporal and just use them when you need them - but do n't spam them in every bush . 
  some practice should let you use 4 wards before back in efficient way . 
  never think about `` where to put 3 wards '' , rather `` where and when do i need a next ward '' . 
  think about vision like a `` zone of influence '' , which borders are moved by each ward your team puts . 
  your team generally should n't go into areas where you do n't have vision and have no idea what 's going on there - they are out of your influence . 
  in lane you will always ward river , sometimes lane bushes , sometimes dragon , sometimes enemy jungle . 
  ( on your level people barely can play jungle tho , so i do n't know if it 's that helpful . ), 
  thoughtful wards are most important in midgame . 
  some tips :, 
  * ward when chasing enemy to maintain vision on them, 
  * ward when you are chased to help your team punish the chaser, 
  * ward area of incoming fight , in bushes where you will need vision on enemy, 
  * observe enemy movement on map and ward bushes on the enemy route to help your team catch them, 
  * ward enemy jungle to safely move through it later, 
  * ward enemy jungle to locate the enemy jungler and safely push objective on other side of the map, 
  generally you want to have vision ( or good predictions about their possible location ) on all enemies all the time . 
  best locations for long lasting pinkwards :, 
  * bush next to dragon pit on blue side, 
  * blue buff bush ( in mid/late game people often do n't check it ), 
  * bush opposite to red buff ( not the one near it , but closer to base ), 
  * small river bush on the dragon side, 
  * tribush in laning phase if you play on blue side, 
  also you should always :, 
  * have a pinkward to deny vision , replace destroyed one or just put it in another place - remember that lone pink ward standing in bush means that there 's no enemy ward around , use that information, 
  * have a sweeper to deny vision when : planning ambush , recalling in enemy jungle , in lane bush , doing dragon/baron, 
  * encourage your team to upgrade trinkets after lvl 9 ( they are so worth now ), 
  i mean aggressiveness not about damage , but about presence . 
  i 've been this sona and i 've been this cho . 
  i try to be positive about things ( really guys i 'm so sweet and positive most of the time you would n't believe ) , but sometimes it 's just crazy how hard i carry botlane ( as sona huehue ) or jungle and how still my team manages to destroy all my tryharding , usually not even by losing lanes , but by not having any brain ( fed adc in 55 minute decides to suicide while farming wolves , true story ) . 
  i can ping like crazy , i can communicate and shit , but i have no power to replace people 's reason . 
  and then i feel really helpless and like it 's really not fair to me to lose this game . 
  and you know what , i do n't want to be this cho . 
  i do n't want to feed , i do n't want to lose lane , i do n't want to be the reason why people flame . 
  i want to be smarter and better than anyone in my team . 
  feeder destroys game for good players . 
  rager destroys game for nice players . 
  you want to have nice game , go play normals , there 's no obligation to play ranked . 
  you play ranked , ok , you better play well or you will destroy the game for the people who actually want to win . 
  cho'gath ruined sona 's game . 
  there 's no explanation for dying in lane 7 times in ranked . 
  sona carried her lane and could be upset that someone else decided to lose her game . 
  rankeds are for wins , normals are for fun . 
  choose wisely .
