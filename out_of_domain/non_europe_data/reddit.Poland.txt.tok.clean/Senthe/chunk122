  you previously explained that you are affected by this problem . 
  maybe it 's a good occasion to ask - why do n't you personally try and change things around you ? 
  that 's sad to hear . 
  it seems we have one representative for roughly 100k citizens , so yeah , about 6 times more representatives proportionally . 
   if you 're representing 600,000 people , you better be able to represent all types of people equally and fairly . 
  i think you are actually supposed to represent mainly your electorate and not literally all people in the country . 
   feminists are powerful and privileged , with deep pockets , government influence , and numerous political parties who value them . 
   feminists are actively campaigning to stop men from ( ... ), 
  well that definitely does n't happen where i 'm from . 
  i 'm from poland . 
  and this is supposed to change my view because ... ? 
  what do you think is its primary purpose then ? 
  so you think according to mras there is no oppression ? 
  why do they need to fight for men 's rights then , if men are already not oppressed ? 
  o __ o, 
  wait , is `` egalitarianism '' an organisation ? 
  i thought only mra and redpillers are somewhat organized , and egalitarianism is more of a movement/ideology . 
  the name is about power relations , not about blaming anyone . 
  men have had more power than women for centuries . 
  the system that emerged from that fact is called patriarchy . 
  maybe men who took all the power instead of splitting it with women had good intentions . 
  but that does n't even matter now , they are long dead , and we need to deal with what we have now . 
   if you do a survey of americans asking if people believe in equal rights for everyone , i ca n't imagine less than 95 % saying they do . 
  reading this thread i come to a conclusion that you have to be some very lucky country in this regard . 
  in my country people like [ this guy ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/women-smaller-weaker-less-intelligent-paid-less-janusz-korwin-mikke-polish-mep-right-wing-silesia-a7609031.html ) are widely respected , and generally many people are plainly sexist without any sign of shame or even a thought . 
  guess that 's not the case in us anymore . 
  you have n't really addressed my point , so i want to reiterate . 
  `` asking if people believe in equal rights for everyone '' is actually very naive method of measurement . 
  of course most people asked * do you want world peace * will say : * yeah of course * , and asked * do you like war * will say : * no , war is terrible ! * . 
  \\ - * but do you want to have it better than other countries ? 
  * \\ - * yeah , this one too !, 
  \\ - * and if someone attacks you ? 
  * \\ - * we will show 'em !, 
  * \\ - * so maybe you will vote to disarm your country ? 
  * \\ - * nah it 's too dangerous !, 
  people will state about themselves anything they think paints them in a good light . 
  but if someone claims they support an idea , but is unwilling to do anything that would be inconvenient for them in order to achieve said idea , they are not actually a supporter . 
  this statement is blank . 
  do you think mras , anti-feminists and redpillers actually support both men and women in order to achieve equality for everyone ? 
  or do they only say so ? 
  you are n't addressing the op . 
  i was n't talking about frontpage , but the top posts of all time . 
  sorry for the misunderstanding that caused you to write so many words : |, 
  interestingly [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mensrights/comments/6hh66r/these_are_the_kind_of_women_we_are_up_against/ ) is very fresh , and the comments seem to be a perfect 50/50 mix of `` haha boom you told her ! '', 
  and `` this is embarassing , makes movement seem not serious , and should have no place here '' . 
  almost like no other kind of comment there . 
  i 'm not sure what to make of it , just an observation . 
  there may be not `` opressor '' ( like a person or specific group of people ) but still be some reason for oppresion ( like some system of beliefs for example ) . 
  i do n't think i want to follow your advice . 
  how does your explanation change any of the facts i described ? 
  some men widely raped , murdered , tortured and were general assholes in the past . 
  they are dead now . 
  i do n't care about past men . 
  i care about present . 
  i do n't know , did i mention bluepill anywhere in my post ? 
  then your statement :, 
   i wo n't deny that the behaviors mentioned in your op exist but they are not the primary purpose of the organization . 
  ca n't be about egalitarians - they are not organisation . 
  can i ask again which organisation were you talking about and what is its primary purpose ? 
  your comment does n't address my op , it 's just a rant . 
  sorry , but does n't `` used for certain cancers '' mean `` it 's great at destroying human tissue '' ? 
  ok , thanks for the info . 
  you are proving my point :, 
   it seems all they want to do is bashing/undermining/attacking feminism , and not making any positive change . 
  i am responding to your arguments . 
  can you explain what specific thing ( s ) do you want me to answer ? 
  your comments are fairly short and i 'm unsure what 's even your point overall . 
  yup i 'm sold, 
  your post does n't address the op . 
  sure . 
  your first comment reads as follows :, 
   i would say that the majority of feminists are n't necessarily hurting men but the majority of feminists who actually do something will be hostile in some way . 
  people who want equal rights for all just do n't feel welcome in feminism and sometimes are actually attacked ( thus the push back against feminism you see ) . 
  even your cmv itself will cause the pushback because you are delegitimizing the real issues by saying that they do n't care about them . 
  let me reiterate it :, 
  - majority of feminists who do something are also hostile to men, 
  - egalitarian people do n't feel welcome or feel attacked, 
  - i am delegitimizing issues by saying egalitarians do n't care about them, 
  with first , i do n't agree at all . 
  second i can understand and empathize with . 
  third i do n't understand - what kind of issues i 'm delegitimizing ? 
  my only idea is that you mean issues regarding hostile feminists ? 
  i do n't see how any of these points challenges my op that is about `` egalitarian people want only to oppose feminists , and not to help any regular people '' . 
  what you wrote seems to align with my point , no ? 
  is there anything about positive changes that i missed ? 
  or do you think that a lone act of opposing feminists is positive enough ? 
  atheism is not a lack of belief , but a belief that there is no god . 
  agnosticism is default lack of belief . 
  atheism is already taking a position . 
  correct . 
  patriarchy is the reason for all gender stereotypes , that hurt men and women alike . 
  i answered that in another comment : https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/6hmcdm/cmv_most_people_who_call_themselves_egalitarian/dj0920g/, 
  sorry but i do n't have the time to talk more about this as it is offtopic . 
  clearly neopets are not prepared to become an esport, 
  i would n't mind . 
  lmao great typo, 
  i hear you and can understand your point , although i do n't agree at all . 
  i do n't think i 'll get any further with your way of thinking and it does n't convince me to change my view . 
  thanks for your time . 
  the hell is this d :,
