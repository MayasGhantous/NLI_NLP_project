  everyone feels sad sometimes , you just have to know when you should keep moving . '', 
  sure dude , depression and rage control are so easy . 
  \\  useless, 
  eh poor guys, 
  i assume that people who genuinely ca n't stop raging even though they want to are indeed depressed in some way . 
  it 's hard to me to understand raging attitude of a healthy person since i 'm depressed myself and sometimes i do rage altough i really want to be positive . 
  you can be right that for healthy people it 's a decision rather than something uncontrollable . 
  just wanted to say it 's not always the case . 
  this is golden, 
  what the hell i ca n't move, 
  i love using my actives only to get an assist from half a map away when somebody gets chased down . 
  i guess i 'm an assist bitch . 
   the creator does n't claim any of the rights to his product . 
  the issue are not his rights , but his responsibility ... 
  it 's not that i * want * to roam , i just kinda feel i should . 
  with the early mana problems it 's really hard to clear waves faster than most midlaners without having to back every 3-4 waves ( which is actually countereffective ) . 
  i tend to clear at lvl 6 with maxed q + autoattacks . 
  so you say if i have only mana items using only ult would be actually more efficient ? 
  honestly i feel like early and early-mid game i can push wave without using all my mana only if my opponent is already not there ... 
  i feel like e does n't help early on and tend to max q instead for better range and more effective farming . 
  your e is n't for snare , but for silence . 
  disengage and silencing assasins in the middle of their combo are crazy . 
  you should look for opportunity to silence someone who wants to use their awsum finishing spell , escape or flash . 
  the e alone , with crazy heals and sustain , makes soraka awesome teamfighter and counterpick for assasins . 
  if people do n't actually focus her , with well-timed e she can easily win almost any fight for her team . 
  then go for 0/9/21 , great page for any ap support . 
  this 9 offense masteries are n't really this useful . 
  use hybrid pen marks to maximize early damage output . 
  yep , went 0/0/0 vs sneaky, 
  awwwww, 
  wtf, 
  yep , either gim me sweet assists or keep this aggro thingy away . 
  now it just does n't make any sense . 
  ** [ chronoshift ] ( http://i.minus.com/ikqpe12fwuge5.gif ) **, 
  leave anivia alone , she 's already poor and unloved :'(, 
  debuffs should give assists , as stated by lol wiki . 
  i believe that death mark and time bomb are both debuffs , dealing damage after certain time ( did n't check tho ) , thus they should both draw aggro and give assists . 
  i use standard ap support runes ( hybrid pen reds , hp yellows , ap blues , 2ap/1armor quints ) and masteries ( 0/9/21 ) . 
  these work just fine . 
  have n't tried any fancy stuff like hp regen runes yet , but i do n't really feel like i need to ( and i play soraka often ) . 
  it does ... 
  unless it 's some edge case ... 
  bomb is now a skillshot too . 
  but a casted bomb is landed skillshot , unlike ashe 's flying arrow . 
  `` minion draws aggro at cast , but does n't give assist before blowing up '', 
  seems legit to me, 
  o _______ o, 
  yeah , now you can spam bombs all day and they barely even notice them ... 
  but it 's on only damaging spell which also is a skillshot , so it 's not like it makes zilean meaningfully damage enemies anyway . 
  did you actually try to play anivia ? 
  because i did . 
  well ... 
  it definitely should be the case then ... : |, 
  his slow is now ridiculous , ult and passive are great , but the no assist on q thing really destroys many opportunities to get some gold on him : /, 
  i played anivia a lot and pulled off many assists with a wall . 
  but i do n't know , maybe i did one aa before or sth ( do n't think so tho ) . 
  i will check it again in custom today or tomorrow . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's some issue with rito way to code the sticking part .

  relevant flair, 
   3 days a game, 
  sounds like hell of a game , do you have any replay ? 
  now kiss, 
  still it 's unproffesional . 
  he is n't doing this stuff to see happy faces , but for goddamn money . 
  edit : did n't know that it 's not his job to communicate with community . 
  my bad . 
  edit2 : but seriously what 's up with these downvotes . 
  o __ o, 
  did n't know about that . 
  you really want to build this pyramid , do n't you, 
  man , just remake it before europe wakes up and notices you insulted 'em . 
  there will be hundreds of american votes anyway , so do n't worry about losing them : p, 
  it 's all about lane presence, 
  remember that it 's only data about users of this subreddit and not about all lol players . 
  lol , i would love that if anyone paid me anything for studying ever . 
  i struggle to pay $ 200 for a room and food while studying it . 
  what 's wrong with you, 
  i 'm polish . 
  my friend for example is unhappy because he can barely afford to pay for food , lives with shitty family in a shitty room , wears used clothes , has to ask his friends to buy him a beer when they meet , ca n't find a job and ca n't move out to live somewhere else . 
  and you maybe think that money do n't buy happiness ? 
  yeah sure , also fuck you . 
  poor society = unhappy society . 
  they are n't my concern , i do n't buy them . 
  just wanted to provide a comparison for those who might think that riot 's `` adjustments '' make any sense . 
  lol . 
  no problem . 
  but maybe you should try to learn to . 
  it would be healthier .

  i did n't ignore them , my source did : (, 
  i would love to know on what planet do you live . 
  things are n't so simple here on the earth . 
  basically it can go not only `` hey i want to sell this - hey i want to buy this - ok awesome let 's try to figure out a fair price '' but rather `` hey fucker do you want to buy it - omg , fuck you , yes i do - good , here 's your price , if you do n't agree with it fuck off - godammitihateu '' . 
  it 's all about making people to pay as much as you can get them to , not only trying to friendly get their consent . 
  you can say `` rp is not food you do n't need it '' , but honestly it 's not how the world of human needs works . 
  people can buy alcohol instead of food and can buy rp instead of clothes ; advertising , addiction etc.
