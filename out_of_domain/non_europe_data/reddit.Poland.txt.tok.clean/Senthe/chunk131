  female champions cater to young men , but on the contrary , male champions ... also cater to young men !, 
  what a hypocrisy !, 
  wait , what ? 
   you can use your abilities without taking a single point of damage if you ** and your adc ** play it correctly, 
  ftfy . 
   then e out ** if your adc stays in range **, 
  ftfy . 
   it writhed and spit blood out its mouth like it was auditioning to be a demon, 
  i love this description . 
  this has to be the correct answer . 
  my name is seemingly super common , so common that in my grade school there was a one year older girl with literally identical name , who was unrelated to any of my family . 
  it seems i 'm sharing it with a fair number of people who are actresses , hair stylists , doctors , photographers and so on . 
  the only reasonable gmail address that i could get had to include my year of birth , but this thread makes me pretty sure it was worth it . 
  it was one of my favorites as a child . 
  i choose to strongly believe this . 
  he was acting too alive , it provokes murder . 
  i 'll join and add [ magnificat ] ( https://vimeo.com/227556050 ) by arvo part . 
  it 's so stunning . 
  everything in carmina burana is fucking great , and it gets even better when you actually read translations . 
  seriously . 
  do that . 
  maybe [ ayub ogada - kothbiro ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0jwf-y1uww ) ? 
  it 's so peaceful and melancholic . 
  wake up !, 
  gfksydfgkuycbzsdyfgzlisduyflidush make up !, 
  i love this song !, 
  it gets so much more beautiful when you read lyrics !,

  i came here for this . 
  this would ruin my life . 
  oh come on . 
  this . 
  you know , this is not gon na magically work if you guys are gon na do literally nothing to improve the situation you 're in . 
  either get the guy to learn preprocessors or get a frontend dev . 
  this is ** basic ** knowledge in 2k17 . 
  no shit your current `` framework '' is terrible if it 's written by a wannabe pure css master . 
  this guy has zero competence to do that , or to be taken into account in any decision making , for that matter . 
  no framework on earth will fix his stubbornness and lack of knowledge . 
  ... find another job , if you are actually concerned with code quality ? 
  i 'm sorry but i feel we ca n't do anything to help you here . 
  `` person in charge also does the design and css '' sounds like a hostile environment for any sane person and is a huge ass red flag for an employer . 
  i 'm sorry it 's so hard for you : ( . 
  hope you 'll be able to talk some sense into them , good luck man . 
  another idiotic tip on frontpage with a bazillion points . 
  this sub really becomes filled with trash . 
  i tried . 
  is your character real ? 
  - yes, 
  is your character a porn actress ? 
  - yes, 
  was your character executed ? 
  two rocks . 
  here , it 's your new blender , grand ^ 100 ma . 
  wtf is even the message here ? 
  what am i supposed to feel ?? 
  i mean , if they enjoy it , whatever ... 
  good bot, 
  this is basically the same thing . 
  i would have trouble having sex after this conversation , it has to be weird while laughing so hard . 
  ok , he 's obese , so what ? 
  wtf ? 
  how is this possible that you did n't keep them separate or something ? 
  you look totally fine dude . 
  would date . 
  get medication . 
  it 's easy and will make the world of a difference . 
  it 's not like cartoon guy is gon na get offended . 
  also there is nothing wrong about being whatever , trans , gay , obese , blonde , shortsighted . 
  if that 's a fact , it should n't be an insult . 
  mind that my partner of 4 years is obese and i do n't give a damn . 
  well , you labeled me as a horrible person , even though i literally could n't be more accepting about other people 's weight ( and other issues ) . 
  this is jumping to conclusions too . 
  but still , i appreciate you stand up for others . 
  it is not possible . 
  there is no `` parent '' selector , and you would need this , because flair data is placed deeper in the comment tag and not in its metadata . 
  its me ur brother, 
  it 's not even relevant . 
  i 'm sorry , is this r/gtage ? 
  i love how you just called this character mycroft . 
  i do n't think it would be in character for olenna to sit on a throne like this . 
  nonono , it 's way better to inform her that you 've seen her getting raped . 
  this will show her you 're a knowledgeable man . 
  just fucking goddamn it bran . 
  she got in bed with the high sparrow ? 
  what ? 
  omg pls let this happen, 
  this is great . 
  i read the comic . 
  really boring , do n't recommend . 
  it 's such a shame we wo n't see her in the series : (, 
  i assumed you 're talking about me since you were responding to my comment , for some reason . 
  exactly . 
  it does n't mean that you ca n't be hurt when somebody points it out , it 's generally rude to talk about other people 's imperfections . 
  but it 's not inherently malicious to state facts . 
  i think you have misspelled awesome . 
  it 's so silly , classy and vintage , all at the same time . 
  shut up . 
  we have the best flairs . 
  why ? 
  my boyfriend probably has asperger 's ( ca n't afford official diagnosis ) .
