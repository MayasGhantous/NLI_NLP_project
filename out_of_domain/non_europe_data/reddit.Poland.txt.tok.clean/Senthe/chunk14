  can make them to want unnecessary things so badly that they will even agree for an unfair price even at the expense of their primary needs . 
  trying to make profit out of these people i feel is just ... not fair . 
  but i 'm aware that not everyone would say so . 
  that 's perfectly true and i know a lot of people who literally work for years for such a wage . 
  it 's fucking disgusting how idiotically expensive are virtual goods here ( since they cost the same as in the us or western eu even though we make like 4-10 times less than them ) . 
  in poland it 's 5 hours : ), 
  do you think it 's better to sell 0 skins for $ 10 or 100 skins for $ 1 ? 
  a skin single copy literally costs nothing and it 's always better to sell this copy than to not sell it . 
  you as company will always want to sell a skin to the interested person for the highest price acceptable to this person . 
  you should optimize income with balancing number of copies sold with their price ( so number * price would be high as possible ) . 
  income = number * price . 
  if skin is $ 0,01 , you get extremely high number , but price too low to get good income . 
  if skin is $ 1000 , you set extremely high price , but very very low number . 
  somewhere is the golden mean . 
  i think that in poland etc. 
  skins are too expensive and too little people buy them and if the prices were lower that would make better income for the riot ( price down , number up , number * price higher ) . 
  for now here 's literally not many people who can even afford spending rp ( and it 's like few skins/champs a month at max ) . 
  ferrari is not a product for children , students and young adults . 
  honestly gdp per capita does n't tell a shit about quality of living and wages . 
  try disposable income per capita or minimum wage . 
  you can tell more with your mouth shut . 
  ( to the non-polish people , we are talking about old websites listed in tabs on the top of the screen ), 
   people are willing to pay these `` outrageously high prices '' for rp, 
  yeah i totally see a hundreds of people saying `` hey these are fair prices , totally worth it '' , especially in eastern europe : ), 
  not more facile than the argument above it . 
  think beyond one lifetime . 
  nobody knows how to play against her because nobody plays her . 
  darknesssss, 
  it made me curios , do people seriously fap to lol contents like art and animations ? 
  made a [ poll ] ( http://strawpoll.me/3811026 ) , curious to see results ... 
  [ this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2y8fsz/jannas_taunt_makes_her_slap_her_butt/ ) and comments there inspired me to . 
  apparently people seriously do masturbate to animations and arts . 
  i do n't get it either . 
  only riot 's content . 
  rule34 etc. 
  arts do n't count . 
  i can assure you that in poland and lihtuania people definitely are not paying these prices . 
  let 's assume that in western europe 50 % of playerbase buys rp and in eastern it 's 10 % . 
  still you see no reason to lower price in eastern europe ? 
  from my perspective it looks like a butt ... 
  it 's really easy to stay in lane long enough to get to the 800 gold point ( if the lane is n't just a distater ) . 
  man , the only soraka pick is mata clearly trolling this game , please remove her from the list : (, 
  it makes me so sad : (, 
  it 's there , it 's just invisible . 
  no naked tits , no pretty face , geez is this even female ? 
  everybody already forgot turtle 's tristana ? 
  o __ o, 
  in poland usually you have to learn one foreign language age 7-12 , two 13-15 and two 16-18 . 
  so basically one language for 12 years and one for 6 years ( often it can be also one for 12 years , one for 3 years and another one for 3 years ) . 
  usually it 's english which you learn for 12 years in school . 
  even if as a young child you were taught something else , at some point you 'll probably have to learn at least basic english as well . 
  it 's really super common amongst young people . 
  for people who are like 30 + educational system was different and they were taught mostly german ( on the west ) and russian ( on the east ) and often do n't know english . 
  it 's not really hard to find many polish friends and play only with them tho . 
  especially if you 're 15 years old . 
  it 's true , english pronunciation is just crazy . 
  in polish i feel that the rules are way more strict and logical , but there 's really a lot of them . 
  english is fucking crazy dude . 
  it can seem easy because you use it a lot . 
  i 've had some english classes with group of poles and single spanish guy recently . 
  i can understand pretty well even really bad english with polish accent , but damn i ca n't understand a word from what this guy says : d. probably if i was native english speaker it would n't bother me this much . 
  this . 
  was n't he supposed to be a midlaner ? 
  in addition he has [ really poor base stats ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aitt9_mhdk ) . 
  ( it 's a comparison with all champs , not only suports tho . ), 
  soraka is really useful in lane . 
  of course there are better picks , but her sustain can be crazy . 
  she just has really poor kill potential and that 's the reason people do n't like to play her that much . 
  i had on my friend list this one guy who was so annoying and whiney `` omg u dont want to play with me ? 
  maybe later ?? '', 
  `` can we play ? '', 
  `` u think im bad ? '', 
  `` duo ranked ??? '' . 
  i had to remove him cause it was really pissing me off . 
  with invisibility mode it would be a lot easier . 
  well he seemed really nice and talked to me about a lot of stuff , but seriously , it was too much . 
  nidalee is way more `` fine '' now than katarina . 
  bard : the ascencion, 
  i think he makes this accent partly on purpose , i mean usually polish accent should n't be this bad ; p, 
  alexander litvinenko , `` fugitive officer of the russian fsb secret service who specialised in tackling organised crime '' , was murdered by drinking tea with some of this radionuclide . 
  for example in us you can [ buy it ] ( http://www.unitednuclear.com/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cpath=2_5 ) just like that . 
  it 's obviously an overkill in most of the situations where you would want to poison someone , i just wanted to say that this thing exists ; ), 
  i 'm polish too , i guess i just want to believe ... 
  however `` a speck of polonium the size of the dot at the end of this sentence contains about 3,400 times the lethal dose for humans . '', 
  i do n't think it 's a good choice of poison ; ) . 
  i just wanted to say that this thing exists , for science !, 
  so 25 % of streamers are just normal non-sexualized female streamers ? 
  um ... yeeaaah that 's terrible ... 
  as for current results , 139 out of 3590 people are 21 + women like me . 
  i guess i can start to feel alone and special . __ . 
  do n't tell them , it 's easier ; /, 
  how does this thread have 86 points and 13185 votes in poll ? 
  i feel u : (, 
  hahahaha . 
  kids these days . 
  i prefer to be harassed because of my gameplay than because of my gender ... 
  sexism is that men are treated like normal human beings and women like special human beings . 
  does n't matter if that means that women get harassed less , get compliments or have to deal with flirty suggestions . 
  um ok i do n't know what more can i say besides that your point is not true . 
  as janna i ulted people out of my nunu 's ult few times .
