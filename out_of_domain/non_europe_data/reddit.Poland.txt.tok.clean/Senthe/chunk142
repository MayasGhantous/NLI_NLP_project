  words can make people do unimaginable things and are one of the most effective weapons ever made . 
  if `` words ca n't hurt you '' then you are most probably a plant , because even animals will react to words if only they can understand their meaning a bit . 
  denying psychological aspects of overall health is like denying physiology and medical science altogether . 
  words can make you scared , angry , hurt . 
  those states are not `` only in your head '' but have a very measurable impact on all your bodily functions . 
  words can make your body produce hormones and adrenaline . 
  words can solely give you a heart attack or a seizure . 
  words can also literally heal you ( placebo anyone ? ) . 
  if `` words ca n't hurt you '' then you are most probably a plant , because even animals will physiologically react to words if only they can understand their meaning a bit . 
   `` words hurt too '' `` yeah but guess what , we 're not in kindergarten anymore '', 
  oh , so this is not denying that words can hurt you ? 
  you chose interesting wording to communicate that . 
  also i 'm not sure why are you the person who decides what can and can not hurt someone ? 
  it 's like you accidentally hit someone with a stick and when they say `` ow it hurts '' you start to insist that they simply ca n't feel pain , because you hit really lightly , or this is not a kind of a stick that causes pain , or that they are stupid because they feel pain . 
  why is n't it enough to say `` oh , sorry , did n't want to hurt you '' ? 
  ok , this totally makes sense now . 
  hey , i can actually agree with your comment . 
  it seems pretty balanced . 
  i just think it 's important to remember that people are actually very different and will react to very different things . 
  you never know what kind of person is this new stranger and what will cause distress to them . 
  it 's best to try to be as civilized and polite as possible , simply to avoid both hurting people and being misunderstood . 
  i assume we all want to be on good terms after all . 
  but you went from `` saying things about people '' to `` vocalizing opinions '' and this is actually a different topic that i 'm not going into . 
  i think opinions can be harmful too , but on much less personal and more indirect level ( a slur can make you feel bad immediately , a harmful political opinion can * eventually * make you lose your job or put you at health risk and so on ) . 
  of course you can ignore things that are not true , that 's very easy . 
  when they actually hurt you , they are probably true or somehow hit you on personal level . 
  but the fact that some words are true does n't change the fact that they are inconsiderate , rude and harmful . 
  like for example , a guy i know is fat , i know that , he knows that , there is no denying that fact . 
  he feels bad about that . 
  so i wo n't go and say `` hey you 're super fat ! '', 
  and expect him not to get hurt because that 's a fact . 
  if i said that , it would n't hurt him because `` he gave me the power '' , but because i decided to hurt him . 
  i am the bad person here , not the guy who just , like , exists and understands words that are said to him . 
  i do n't know where you live , is that us ? 
  i live in poland , and it 's really really different here when it comes to this `` political correctness '' thing . 
  there is virtually no black people here , but you will hear equivalents of n-words for gays and muslims every . 
  single . 
  day . 
  it 's crazy how people can hate and disregard each other here , mostly for religious reasons too . 
  it 's like , i do n't expect people to dispute if being terf is superior to swerf . 
  or knowing those terms . 
  or being even interested in trans people problems . 
  i just want not to hear about `` disgusting trannies '' . 
  this is really not much to ask for . 
  so you think that people can simply * prevent * being emotionally vulnerable by , i do n't know , not having weak points at all ? 
  excuse me , but how old are you ? 
  ( of course , i assume that this question will not offend you in any way , because you are fully prepared for it . ), 
  i heard many such horror stories about crazy sjws , and i also never fact-checked any of them : ) . 
  you ? 
  btw have you heard that european union lead by evil angela merkel wants to regulate curvature of bananas and that eu is considering snails fish ? 
  : ) because those two stories about eu are pretty damn popular in here . 
  of course both are pretty much made up and taken out of context . 
  but hey , silly evil eu idiots , amirite ? 
  this is probably my most favorite thing in the entire internet : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvlzxg6pb6u, 
  technically they can , but it would n't be true . 
   she 's also replaced dogs at no charge when they showed a genetic problem , even at 5 years of age . 
  wait , what ? 
  so some dogs lived with some families for 5 years and then they were returned because of genetic problems ? 
  wtf ? 
  somebody give this person their gold . 
  this is the worst thing ever made . 
  how the hell did you manage to play 78 games already ? 
  seriously , i love bard bard , and i would n't buy a more expensive skin . 
  you should get used to pasting the link to your op.gg every game then . 
  this would probably help to minimize amount of people who do n't trust you . 
  in teemoing i had way better winrate and it also was interesting . 
  if we have two difficulties then why not make the easier one actually beatable even for solo players ?

  i have also epic shards for at least 3 champs i 'd like to play . 
  eh it depends . 
  for a lot of supports in lane the threat of a spell is more important than possibility to spam this spell .
