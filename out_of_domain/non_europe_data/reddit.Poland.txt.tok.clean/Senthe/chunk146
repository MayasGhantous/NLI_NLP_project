  `` help '' button near home/mute ones , opening popup with some basic information about rules and interface of the game . 
  let us set/remember default room creating preferences . 
  favicon pls ; ), 
  yes , i do want to sit alone in my room and wait for the people to come . 
  no reason to kick me . 
  bugs :, 
  person who just entered room does n't see current wip picture ( to be specific , sees only parts drawn after they entered ) . 
  i will edit the list when something else comes to my mind : ), 
  it became an common advice to buy a ward each back . 
  however the upgraded yellow trinkets after 5.1 are so cheap and so awesome i think it should be now strongly advised to get one asap on lvl 9 if you do n't want red or blue trinket . 
  with that in mind , what do you think should be the mindset about buying wards pre-9 and post-9 ? 
  after today 's patch my client was doing weird stuff , screenshots below :, 
  [ sending 3 messages in a row ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ykzu7hn.png ) ( notice no scroll bar in chat window ), 
  [ some chat text input thingy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rrvl2m6.jpg ), 
  [ after minimizing and maximizing window ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1atnari.png ) ( window resized and a large black strip on the bottom ), 
  theoretically midlaner should be able to roam , yet i struggle to do anything outside of midlane with anivia pre , say , lvl 9 , because of her low mobility , mana problems and need for farm . 
  at best i 'm able to help in junglers duels near my lane . 
  i 'm used to play super mobile supports and find it really hard to slowly move around the map as the cryophoenix . 
  any tips how to time and plan my roams with ? 
  how does that even make sense . 
  casting bomb on enemy champ will draw turret aggro , casting on neutral minion will make it attack you ( and a crab will run away ) , but it does n't give assist when casted on champ who dies before detonation . 
  edit : i 'm okay with it drawing aggro and giving an assist or not drawing aggro and not giving assist . 
  but now there 's literally no logic behind the way it works . 
  i do n't think there 's any other spell or ability working with aggro and assists this way . 
  edit2 : there are some discussions about `` what is assist-worthy and what 's not '' . 
  but to put facts straight , quotes from lolwiki :, 
   * time bomb ** can cancel an enemy recall ** despite dealing no damage . 
   * a ticking bomb ** will draw turret aggro ** . 
   * a ticking bomb ** does not grant an assist if the target dies before it explodes ** . 
   * if a bomb carrier takes lethal damage and triggers a revive effect , such as chrono shift or guardian angel , ** the bomb is removed like all other debuffs ** . 
  [ assist ] ( http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/assist ) :, 
   you can either score an assist by hitting ( without killing ) the champion in the last 10 seconds before their death , or by contributing passively during this period of time . 
   champions also ** gain assists ** on kills if they :, 
   * contributed to the battle via active abilities , for example stuns or knockups , whether or not they dealt damage to that enemy, 
   * ** debuffed an enem ** y , even if that enemy was immune to the damage . 
   * supporting a champion that contributed to the kill , e.g. 
  healing or buffing an allied champion . 
   champions ** will not gain assists if they ** :, 
   * ** only use blind , reveal or attack speed slow ** , without also contributing in any of the above ways, 
  my intention was not arguing if bomb is `` worth '' an assist . 
  i wanted to tell that using simple logic :, 
  if ( ** zilean bomb is a debuff ** ) and ( ** all debuffs give assists ** ) then ( ** zilean bomb should give an assist ** ), 
  all this on ground of existing rules . 
  to make current state sensible you have to change one of the above two conditions . 
  i 've chosen na and eu countries which were the most popular in the lastest reddit [ poll ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2xymx7/quick_poll_where_are_you_from/ ) and tried to figure out how much you would feel you pay for a skin in usa if you 'd earn as much as the other country citizen . 
  [ results ( prices before `` adjustment '' ) ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iya2qgwnddwriq9gtvqd52scns-gwvvtpltpirwpo_4/edit?usp=sharing ), 
  ** disclaimer 1 ** : be sure you are aware of what is `` net-adjusted household disposable income '' is . 
  as defined by oecd :, 
   household net-adjusted disposable income is the amount of money that a household earns , or gains , each year after taxes and transfers . 
  it represents the money available to a household for spending on goods or services . 
  remember that `` household '' usually means mom , dad and children who all want to spend this di on their needs . 
  ** disclaimer 2 ** : i checked many sources of data and found this the most useful . 
  if you think that another one would be better , let me know . 
  ** disclaimer 3 ** : i 'm not sure about rp costs in uk and canada . 
  if you could provide me information i can adjust them appropriately . 
  these results do n't show real scale of inequality of riot 's economic concerns . 
  for example : in poland you would have to pay $ 19 for dj sona . 
  unqualified physical worker earns $ 2 - $ 3 per hour . 
  a loaf of bread costs $ 0.5 ( dj sona = 40 loafs ) . 
  compare with value of dj sona in your country ( for example in us dj sona = 8 loafs ) . 
  and then count in that in poland you literally earn hundreds of dollars less ( so you have less money to spend on entertainment because you still have to buy food and clothes etc ) . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** you would have to have your head up your ass to claim that rp prices have anything in common with europe citizens ' economic situation . 
  ** tl ; dr2 : ** us citizens , notice ^ senpai the rest of the world , it does exist and really is n't as happy and rich . 
  until now i 've built anivia with mandatory roa and early catalyst/tear because of her mana problems ( and low hp also ) . 
  have you tried to build her super aggressive , more midgame oriented with early new athenes and e.g. 
  liandrys/ludens/zhonya 2nd item ? 
  and since i 'm fairly sure that someone here did : p - how did it go ? 
  ** play teemo . 
  no , but seriously , before you go `` why would you make me play * satan * ?!?!, 
  '' , let me explain why teemo is a great choice of toplaner for any support main . 
  * his ult can work well if you go into jungle and drop a shroom in bushes which your enemies are likely to go through . 
  does it remind you something ? 
  yeah , exactly , * warding * . 
  if you have some practice with warding you will have no problem with dropping mushrooms on their ways and screwing up their life . 
  * did i mention that his ult gives a shitton of vision and map pressure ? 
  so there 's that . 
  * oh but teemo is squishy ... ** so what bitch ** . 
  you are super used to play these made of paper jannas , sorakas and sonas with no decent escape . 
  a squishy mage ? 
  * so you ca n't cs ? 
  while , sorry , that 's pretty pathetic , well ok , here you go with that magic damage on-hit so you do n't lose a single cs anymore . 
  * you do n't know how to position yourself in teamfight ? 
  do n't worry , with proper preparation of teamfight ( which you did as a support a thousand of times with wards ) sometimes you wo n't even need to be here : ^ ), 
  other reasons to pick up teemo :, 
  * easy to learn , hard to master . 
  you can always improve your builds , shrooming patterns , outplays and mindgames . 
  * in low elo people have no idea about upgraded red trinkets or pinks . 
  it 's hilarious how effective a teemo can be when nobody clears his mushrooms and get him out of stealth . 
  * he 's intimidating . 
  if you play it well people wo n't know if you are out of position or if you bait . 
  sometimes you can bluff and get off with it . 
  sometimes you do n't bluff , they check and die to your shrooms . 
  * he 's ranged and has a ranged targeted spell , while his autoattacks can deal shitton of damage , so he will harass melee toplaners pretty badly without any real effort . 
  * insanely fun to play . 
  if you do n't laugh your ass of when you suddenly kill this guy on the another side of the map then there 's something seriously wrong with you . 
  it 's been some time since introduction of the elixirs , but i still have no clue how to effectively use them . 
  i 'm looking for some general tips about buying and using elixirs . 
  * when to use them ? 
  ( early/mid/lategame ? 
  ahead or behind ?
