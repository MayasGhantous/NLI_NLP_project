  i liked stricter moderation , less shitposts , less karma-whoring , less one-sentence jokes . 
  i do n't care about rl drama or nazi something something , i just want to see quality content instead of some shitty pics and tweets . 
  i want mods to come back and not change any old rules , maybe besides small thinges like allowing gfycat links or something . 
  i think that moderation on / r/lol was in most of the cases ( not always ) balanced and on the spot . 
  i think that all this complaining about mods voluntarily doing their hard job is retarded and childish . 
  i do n't agree with people depreciating this job . 
  vocal minority is strong here , please hear also me , a regular user who just does n't want to drown in shitposts upvoted by a bunch of 15 year olds and is thankful for mods ' dedication . 
  i 've accidentaly picked up a double kill on lvl ~ 3 , bought sighstone and amp tome on lvl ~ 5 and from this point the lane went super ham , when i was doing sick dmg on them and my graves could safely get 3 times more farm than enemy lucian . 
  so - would n't it be better to give kills to the support early on , when adc will probably use additional dmg just to lasthit easier and it 's really up to support anyway to snowball the lane ? 
  i 'm talking about specific supports like sona , annie , zyra , vel ` koz who can go ham in lane and do a sick amount of dmg with even a little ap . 
  hey guys , i 'm support main from high silver and wanted to master splitpush udyr since i feel it can be both challenging and hilarious . 
  silver players lack ability to just group and take right turrets in the right time , so i want to solve this problem on my own :\\ ^ ), 
  my questions would be about :, 
  build for said udyr besides zz ` rot, 
  choice of smite, 
  good/bad matchups, 
  would rek ` sai be a better pick here ? 
  i can play her but she does n't feel very good in duels and generally lategame . 
  please help me get into cheesy godyr : ), 
  i am a support main , i started playing a year ago . 
  i am pretty sure i am able to do a good job as a support . 
  when i duo with gold/plat/diamond friends i am able to support them properly . 
  i read a lot about game strategy and have enough game knowledge to build correctly and play teamfights right . 
  i am now stuck in silver iii with no idea how to get out . 
  people play random things , die to retarded kill lanes like ekko graves botlane , group only to be aced and generally run around doing nothing good . 
  i do n't know how to behave in this situation , it 's impossible to support people with tunnelled vision not knowing shit about win conditions . 
  i try to be focused on objectives but my team often chases only kills . 
  they also give up really quickly and if we are down 5 kills it 's `` gg surr ff20 report xyz '' for most of my team . 
  this last thing upsets me the most , i ca n't help people who just give up and for example go for impossible duels . 
  i literally feel like those people play brainless . 
  when i was in bronze people at least tried to follow calls , in silver they think they are better than you and only chase kills . 
  how do i deal with both teammates and enemies being bots with some randomized scripts ? 
  how to not go insane and get out of silver ? 
  edit : guys . 
  i do n't mean that `` omg my team is bad and enemy is always challenger '' . 
  i mean that `` i think that most of the players in both teams behave randomly ( or more random than me ) and i do n't know how to win in this situation '' . 
  i tried to just do non-random reasonable things ( play normal decent supports and be good at it ) but this does n't look like a good strategy ( i lose games ) . 
  i look for advice , not rant . 
  buy runes and runepages only during [ a sale ] ( http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/sales/prepare-2015-season-kickoff-sale ) . 
  sale is 30 % off for runes and `` two for one '' for runepages . 
  buy runepages with rp . 
  ~ $ 20 will get you ~ 10-12 new runepages . 
  all runes you need for start cost on sale 12897 ip . 
  all advanced runes you will need later cost about 25000 ip . 
  total cost of all runes you might possibly want to use is about 60000 ip . 
  i bought all my runes during [ winter sale ] ( http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/sales/prepare-2015-season-kickoff-sale ) , making some calculations and trying to figure out optimal way to spend grinded ip . 
  my post is not about how to grind ip , but how to spend them in the most efficient way . 
  if you are patient enough to wait for sale and do n't have to buy a new champ every week it should be easy for you to get all the runes you need . 
  [ this is source of runepages i used ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2s5snf/cheat_sheet_for_rune_pages_for_the_2015_season_as/ ) . 
  this is only an example . 
  even if you would use slightly different runepages your total costs should be similar . 
  going to raw facts and numbers :, 
  * [ runepages from the source ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qlftw0k.png ) . 
  i divided runes between four general sets i observed : standard set , for tanks , for supports and all other shit . 
  * [ costs calculated for all the sets ] ( http://i.imgur.com/smmvdc2.png ) ( assuming 30 % off sale ) . 
  i assumed that you would buy standard set first and only fill it with next sets . 
  * [ costs of the runepages in rp ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3bgnfqh.png ) . 
  * costs of the runepages in $ : [ assuming you bought 20 $ rp pack ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ym0azdt.png ) , [ assuming you bought 100 $ rp pack ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hzy4vmb.png ) . 
  as you can see , there 's almost no difference . 
  it is also clear that it 's not worth to spend money on 7-page bundles and it 's way better to wait for sale . 
  * situation changes when there comes a [ rp sale ] ( http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/sales/extra-bonus-rp-kicks-early ) . 
  bonuses starts to count . 
  costs of the runepages in $ : [ assuming you bought 20 $ rp pack + bonus ] ( http://i.imgur.com/u3tft7i.png ) ( same as with $ 100 rp without a bouns ) , [ assuming you bought 100 $ rp pack + bonus ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hvm1bzq.png ) . 
  i leave to you thinking if runepages and runes are really that expensive ( assuming that you are patient ) . 
  for me 14 runepages is enough , $ 20 is acceptable amount of money to spend on a game i play so much and even 30000 ip is n't really this much to spend on runes , it 's easily possible to get this much in 2-3 months or so . 
  i do n't need to play all roles , all champions at once . 
  for curious , here are the files i used for calculations : [ runes ] ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/0b38zmte9k9n7n2vkyjrga2jsmm8/view?usp=sharing ) , [ runepages ] ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/0b38zmte9k9n7ztatele5cjzwrue/view?usp=sharing ), 
  very fast clear , easy to hit gapcloser , gamechanging ult , tanky anti-tank , ap jungler not very mana hungry , can build tank or ap and be good with both , significantly easier than gragas and not banned at all ... is there something that keeps amumu from being s-tier jungler in soloq right now ? 
  i 'm talking silver-plat , not master-challenger . 
  there are some people thinking that the game is about not dying and that dying is the worst thing to do in any case . 
  when you 're dead , you do n't cast spells , you do n't do damage , you do n't farm , you are useless ghost waiting to respawn . 
  if you do n't want to die , the best thing is to stay at fountain all game . 
  oh wait , in this case you also do n't cast spells , do n't do damage , do n't farm and are useless . 
  is there some mysterious pattern ? 
  you will sometimes die doing right thing due to your teammates ' mistakes , do n't listen to dicks that say `` ur teammates are brainless animals and you are a piece of shit coz ure dead hahaha '' . 
  you need to trust your teammates sometimes when you do a right call . 
  you wo n't win the game 1v9 . 
  you will sometimes die doing things that need to be done . 
  important thing is what your team can get from your death . 
  if you splitpush and enemy sends three people after you ( not smart ) and your team can take a free turret and dragon for your death , it 's obviously worth it . 
  could you not die ? 
  yeeah maybe . 
  did your sacrifice help your team to get something worth more than 300 + 150 gold ? 
  yes . 
  you will sometimes die because enemy just really badly wants to kill you no matter what . 
  4 people focus you and dive your frontline and turret only to get you . 
  you are squishy , peel if exists is not enough , you die , but meanwhile enemy is aced when your tanks and rest of the carries jump on them .
