  you did no mistake . 
  they did . 
  you will sometimes die due to your mistake . 
  and this is the only death that you should really actively avoid . 
  going alone without vision , getting caught , bad positioning , bad focus ( [ go for the tanks goddammit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqzb0hdstly ) ) , not paying attention to map , ignoring pings , ignoring your teammates possibilities with bad engage , those are things that can make you dead for no reason other than your lack of skill . 
  those are things you should actively avoid and try to erase them from your games . 
  tl ; dr : ** to win the game you need to destroy enemy nexus . 
  ** you wo n't destroy enemy nexus staying safe at fountain . 
  your kda does n't fucking matter . 
  anybody 's kda does n't matter . 
  what matters is to build an advantage over enemy team . 
  you wo n't win the game solo . 
  do n't listen to jerks saying that you need to carry solo and not die ever because if you die the universe will collapse and nobody in your team will be able to do anything . 
  get to understand what are mistakes and what are not . 
  not every death is your mistake . 
  if they were , the best pros would never die . 
  luckily they are more focused on actually winning games . 
  i feel like 4v4 and 5v5 botlane parties in early game have become more common recently . 
  it can be because of season 5 dragon changes but it seems to increase in last few patches . 
  any idea why are people now more eager to do 4 , 5 man botlane `` ganks '' ? 
  and how to deal with that ? 
  i 've played few games with support tahm , dunno how is he in other roles . 
  i built him fotm -  full tank with hp over armor and mr ( for the shield and ult scaling ) . 
  he has an incredible save on w , 32 % hp damage on the same skill , good slow , shield giving him bonus ~ 3000 hp in lategame if focused in fight , and ult with passive ~ 100 magic dmg on hit . 
  all those things on fairly low cds ( and it 's easy to build cdr from kindlegems ) . 
  his ult is hard to utilize in soloq right now when people do n't know what to do with it , is slow and has quite short range , but i 'm sure that we will figure out ways to use it soon . 
  i feel like his kit is fine , but numbers and damage output broken . 
  the guy as a full tank support does as much damage to champions as tanky jungler . 
  three stacks on someone can be almost a death sentence , so he zones people just being around . 
  he 's great right now and i genuinely think he deserves a nerf and will get one soon . 
  am i right or am i missing something ? 
  she got a great rework , went live op , then got nerfed , was viable for like 1-2 patches and after further nerfs completely disappeared from the meta again . 
  why so ? 
  do n't you think that it 's one nerf too much ? 
  or is it rather about the meta itself and ashe is well balanced ? 
  hello , i played some tahm kench support and jungle and have small advice for people playing with tahm . 
  his two spells , w and r , require some cooperation to be effective . 
  i hope that after some time it will become common knowledge in soloq . 
  * w : can be used to nom an ally , a minion or an enemy . 
  tahm gets a ms boost carrying an ally . 
  if you get eaten by kench , there are two reasons : a ) because you were in danger ( low hp , cc , caught ) or b ) because he wants to initiate with you . 
  either way do n't spam clicks out of him . 
  he can carry an ally up to 4-6s and it 's a lot of time to get out of danger ( even end a fight ) or to get into the middle of enemy team . 
  treat it like kalista ult , remember that together you are faster and get out only when you are sure the time is right . 
  * r : very slow and short range travel . 
  unusable as escape , but works when you want to attack from flank or cut enemy way in jungle . 
  look for tahm channeling it when you are close to each other and use it ( but try to be sure it 's for you , just like a lantern ) . 
  also works well for traveling back to lane . 
  you can even ask tahm for a ride and he will be the happiest catfish in the world . 
  tl ; dr : nomming you gives ms boost for 4-6s , so click out of tahm only when you are sure the time is right . 
  use his ult or ask him for an ult explicitely . 
  main reasoning here is that he got actually viable in botlane pre-6 because of his changed passive . 
  it lets him stealth in bushes fast , dodge skillshots while invisible , and zone enemies out of the bushes , punishing with painful aa q aa every person who gets too close , then running away with w for a won trade . 
  he 's super fast , so warding and getting control of enemy jungle is easy , and his blind is excellent for peeling off any enemy reliant on autoattacks . 
  he lacks typical supportive skills , but so does for example annie , who does not offer other teemo advantages . 
  i 'm not sure how to build him . 
  * talisman + mobi boots + sightstone + zeke + boc + ghosts . 
  exhaust . 
  max q and e ( or ... q and w ? ), 
  this teemo gets extremely fast ( about 530 passive ms without w active or talisman , more than janna ) and supportive , has tools to peel and support a carry , has some auras and resists so can teamfight with throwing shrooms , can kite anyone , get out of hard situations and safely bait into shrooms . 
  has some poke damage , but ca n't really burst down anyone . 
  talisman works well with passive income , since you wo n't attack enemies in lane all the time . 
  * fqc + sorcerer boots + sightstone + liandry + full ap . 
  ignite . 
  max q and e. 
  typical ap teemo . 
  not so safe , with nerfed shrooms can not work so well , but with smart traps in jungle can burst a squishy . 
  this is what i have after a few games ... 
  thoughts ? 
  is there any good website just doing the math ? 
  * calculating values on each champion spell at certain level with certain items ( how many damage does my spell with items x y z on level n ? ), 
  * auto-making builds which would max certain stat at certain cost ( i have 17k gold , how to spend it to get max hp , then max ad , then max mr possible ? 
  what if i had more or less ? ), 
  * calculating damage dealt and taken from neutral creeps ( can i solo dragon on level 2 if i get ahead and build x ? 
  what is and what is n't possible jungle route with this runes and masteries ? ), 
  * calculating dps including spells, 
  * comparing different builds vs the same opponent ( is lw better than stacking ad when lvl x maokai has y armor , considering my scaling on spells ? 
  flat mpen or % mpen ? ), 
  * and more ? 
  i know that the math behind stats is only a part of good theorycrafting , i 'm just curious if there is any tool helping with such calculations . 
  ^ ( ps please no dumb sandbox memes ), 
  i need a go-to pick for toplane in silver-gold . 
  ( so , at least okay-ish in most of the matchups , still useful if behind . ), 
  i main support and i 'd like to pick up some easy toplane supportive tank . 
  i considered :, 
  - sion, 
  what are pros and cons of them in terms of low elo toplane soloq ? 
  hello , i 'm looking for some good comprehensive angular tutorial , preferably with tasks to solve and such , but text-only , with no videos . 
  is there such thing somewhere ? 
  hey , i 'm looking to create a very simple ** blog-like single page app ** . 
  it has to have a ** cms ** , preferably with an option to add a ** wysiwyg ** form field . 
  i 've considered a few frameworks :, 
  - ror , django - they probably have it all and more , but seem really heavy and unconvenient for a simple task, 
  - mean - no native cms , but mongodb is nice, 
  - meteor - no native cms , has a lot of snippets but i 'm not sure if they will work reliably , possibly harder to deploy ? 
  i 'd prefer to choose some js framework , but i 'm not sure if it 's a good idea ? 
  do you guys have any experience with using such features in those frameworks ? 
  we know that one says `` ootay '' but i have this feeling like one of them says `` tutorial '' , am i crazy or what ? 
  do you know what others say ? 
  my favourite champs to play are squishy ap supports like sona , janna , soraka , nami , annie .
