  coffeescript worked fine for me so far but i know there are some people bashing it for reasons unknown to me . 
  typescript is probably big thing , but honestly i do n't even know what * is * it and what are its advantages and if it makes sense to jump onto that bandwagon now in 2016 ? 
  is there anyone who used cs or ts and could tell me if it 's not a trap ? 
  basically title . 
  official requirement is 4.4 , reddit faq states 4.3 , and i heard rumors it 's possible for even lower version . 
  is there anyone technically qualified to tell me if it 's possible to run it on android 4.2.2 ? 
  and maybe even how to ? 
  edit : i just installed a custom android 4.4.4 cyanogenmod rom and it works fine for me . 
  i recommend this solution as it 's really easy to reinstall system for android . 
  edit2 : stop messaging me , i wo n't help any of you upgrade your system . 
  i 've done it once before so it was quick for me . 
  but it 's complicated and dangerous process , if you do n't know what you 're doing . 
  do it only if you are sure you have a good tutorial for your phone model . 
  try xda-developers forums and cyanogenmod wiki to get knowledge from people far more experienced than me . 
  i can log in , i managed to catch my starter , i can do simple things with my items . 
  but every time i encounter a pokemon , and every 2-3 minutes of idle walking , the app crashes . 
  is this normal and related to server connectivity ? 
  or is this about my phone ( samsung trend plus , with cyanogenmod 11 ) ? 
  how do i turn off ar if app crashes on pokemon encounter before i manage to hit the switch ? 
  edit : okay um ... i my case literally turning the phone off and on magically fixed the app and made it stable . 
  i do n't know why . 
  but it works so i guess i should be happy . _ . ', 
  it 's a 600k city in poland with a big river going through the center . 
  one certain non-common pokemon can be found in entire city - wherever you go , you will find a ton of drowzees ( in addition to rattata , zubats , pidgeys etc ) . 
  ( there is also quite a lot of gastlys and jynxes , but not as many of them as drowzees . 
  every gym here has some hypno . ), 
  is it the case for all cities ? 
  is your city flooded with some other kind of pokemon you would n't expect at first ? 
  ( or am i wrong and drowzees are super common everywhere ? ),

  it bugs out in weird circumstances , affects other elements , and seems to have absolutely no sense . 
  when i use it to debug a layout , i literally scroll through options and choose random one from 2-3 that look good . 
  it feels awful . 
  how to get a good grasp on what the hell is this property and how it actually works in browsers ? 
  attempts like [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mrrobot/comments/5042ja/spoilers_s2e8_i_tried_my_hardest_to_remove_the/ ) are awesome and show fans ' dedication , but obviously are not as good as source material . 
  please publish this cover . 
  it 's awesome emotional song from a show that we all love , and even if she sings not very well music-wise , it 's still a pleasure to listen to it . 
  just like `` where 's my mind '' by maxence cyrin i consider it core part of soundtrack of this series now . 
  it 's a polish word * je\u017coskoczek * i made up . 
  here are details . 
  its construction is derived from * myszoskoczek * :, 
  * * mysz * = mouse, 
  * * skoczek * = jumper , hopper , one who jumps, 
  and :, 
  * * je\u017c * = hedgehog, 
  * * skoczek * = jumper , hopper , one who jumps, 
  so basically , * gerbil * in polish is `` a mouse that jumps '' , my word is `` a hedgehog that jumps / similar to gerbil '' . 
  here 's my [ image ] ( http://imgur.com/p1bug7x ) of it . 
  i tried multiple words , but the most important thing to me is ** as a native or non-native english speaker , would you understand where this word comes from ( seeing the image next to it ) ? 
  some of my thoughts :, 
  * * hedgehopper * - the most solid one , sensible construction from * grasshopper * , but it unfortunately it already has a meaning ( something something about planes flying above crops ) . 
  do any of you natives even know this word ? 
  * * hedgerbil * - seems ugly but kinda makes sense ? 
  * * leaphog * - from * leapfrog * construction , interesting but probably impossible to understand, 
  it 's especially hard to make it work because in english * hedgehog * is already made from two parts that have different meanings on their own . 
  any thoughts ? 
  hello , i got an offer from a workplace colleague to buy an old pc from him . 
  i wanted to build a pc for myself from new parts but maybe this will be a budget option for me to get a machine that 'll work fine for a year or two more ? 
  ( this expenses delay is important to me ) . 
  i want to be able to play new games on decent settings/fps , but i do n't need them to be especially fancy . 
  my budget would be about $ 300 for all parts listed below in this case . 
  ( i listed them as described by him . ), 
  type | item, 
  ** cpu ** | amd phenom ii x4 955 black edition, 
  ** gpu ** | nvidia gtx 460 se 1 gb, 
  ** motherboard ** | gigabyte, 
  ** memory ** | patriot , 8 gb ( 2x4 gb dual channel 1066 ddr3 ) , with radiators, 
  ** cpu cooling ** | silentiumpc ( some polish brand ), 
  ** power supply ** | ocz 450, 
  can you guys judge is it worth it ? 
  i made this mistake two times and both i needed to tinker around for a long time . 
  i love flexbox but sometimes it causes very weird and undesirable effects . 
  imagine a vertical list of things : products , people , something . 
  every item is a row that has a bunch of elements like name , image , buttons . 
  you expect this list to be responsive , and for every resolution elements within items should be vertically aligned . 
  you expect buttons to be in the same place for every row etc. 
  but some things , like names , can have various lengths . 
  and flexbox will try to fit everything in the container , and it 'll shrink or grow things vertically , negate margins or add margins , in a way that is very hard to control . 
  for every row it can go different and as a result your elements will become misaligned vertically . 
  so guys , please remember to stay very careful about ` min-width ` , ` width ` , ` max-width ` , ` margin ` , ` flex ` , ` justify-content ` properties in such cases and check your layout for every possible resolution and content of every element , also for real mobile browsers ( not console simulation ) which interpret flexbox differently than desktop browsers . 
  darlene is angela . 
  tyrell is elliot . 
  angela is her mother . 
  ollie is elliot . 
  joanna is angela . 
  leon is elliot . 
  i am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together . 
  i 'm really tired . 
  i wish you guys accepted that mr. 
  robot is a unique thing and other people are just people . 
  robot was built up entire season and in hindsight all the hints seem really obvious . 
  we were not deceived , we were just unable to put the pieces together . 
  same thing with the prison - all parts were there , a lot of them , and someone even did put it all together . 
  * there is no other person that we could tell with 100 % certainty that it 's a split personality , as we could with mr. 
  there are no hints . 
  all of these theories are founded on suspension of disbelief and not actual things that happened . 
  * angela never even went to therapy . 
  she knows elliot has split personality but does n't seem concerned about that herself . 
  she would definitely react if her dead mother walked around .
