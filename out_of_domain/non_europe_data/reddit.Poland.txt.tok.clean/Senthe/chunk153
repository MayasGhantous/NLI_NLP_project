  she never rapidly changes her behavior . 
  she is mentally healthy . 
  her moments of silence are most likely related to repeating motivational phrases in her head . 
  if to anything . 
  robot was created by elliot to deal with the worst nightmare and the most important event in his life . 
  robot wants to fuck society/destroy capitalism because elliot believes that greedy people killed his father . 
  the father himself never wanted any of this ( to our knowledge ) . 
  he is not even a representation of a real person , he 's just elliot 's thoughts and desires in a hallucinated dead man 's body . 
  robot is walking around for how long - several months probably ? 
  and elliot already discovered he 's a part of him , already tried to fight him , and to take control when mr. 
  robot does n't want him to . 
  how is tyrell 's personality supposed to be in control all the time when their body interacts with joanna , for several years ? 
  * why the hell would elliot 's brain create leon or tyrell ? 
  why ? 
  what is the reason ? 
  why would tyrell/leon look like they look ? 
  how would tyrell/elliot body look like to joanna and normal people ? 
  seriously . 
  please put an end to this . 
  robot is a part of elliot 's personality . 
  other people are not . 
  and other people do n't have split personality . 
  robot is unique . 
  deal with it . 
  anyone has an interesting seed like this ? 
  or at least near some village ? 
  [ wall of text , but i really tried to make it worth your time . ], 
  a few years ago i engaged in some flamewar about internet piracy . 
  in my country piracy is legal if you only download movies , music , books etc. 
  for your own use and do n't share . 
  it makes discussion about morality of piracy ( passive and active ) much more interesting because it 's not so easy to shut it down saying `` piracy is illegal and therefore certainly morally wrong ... because reasons '' . 
  i became really interested in intellectual property rights . 
  i spent next few years reading hundreds of articles and some books about it . 
  i read about licenses and fair use . 
  i learned endless examples of companies ruining individual lives by suing people for thousands of dollars over a few songs on torrents . 
  i read about the internet , its history , various laws regulating it , usa monopoly . 
  i read the awesomely interesting [ declaration of the independence of cyberspace ] ( https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence ) . 
  i made my first public domain thing . 
  i come from a poor country , where we earn 4-5 times less than people in us , but still need to pay the same price for cultural goods . 
  it 's impossible for me and for people i care about to ever afford all the books , movies , series , games we want to experience . 
  actually , i think in the last 4 years i could n't afford virtually any - i barely had enough money to eat properly . 
  and yet since my childhood culture is my entire life . 
  i spend all my time reading , writing , watching , playing , thinking , i do n't even feel like a physical entity . 
  and i think it 's so important that all people who want to are still able to experience what is not only entertainment , but also a ticket to social life , food for thoughts , and the only way to better ourselves . 
  so i still could n't figure out piracy . 
  because yeah , of course me copying a $ 5 music album does n't make another person lose $ 5 if i could n't even afford it in the first place . 
  this is illogical bullshit clearly illustrated [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubdn4xpptka ) ( in polish : `` piracy and theft '' ) . 
  but maybe if i ca n't afford it , then the most moral thing would be just not obtaining it at all ? 
  there were those advertisements `` you would n't download a car ! '' . 
  i was like `` wtf ??? 
  of course i 'd download a car '' . 
  if i could do that it would mean every person on earth can now have a completely free car . 
  how is that not a good thing ? 
  ( let 's put aside cars not being actually good . ), 
  piracy makes it possible to make `` infinite value '' from only one copy . 
  if we could do that with everything - food etc - everyone could have and enjoy whatever they want to . 
  but okay , infinite food is impossible , we still operate on limited resources . 
  infinite cultural value is nice but somebody still has to pay for production of the first copy . 
  should n't i make sure that one person is paid properly so they can actually buy food and other physical things for themselves ? 
  i figured that yes , if it 's possible i should support with my money people that are worth supporting . 
  but if i do n't have money ... then what good comes from me and other poor people not having access to infinitely copyable culture ? 
  how does that make the world a better place ? 
  finally this sub made me understand : it just does n't . 
  taking things away from people not because you need the things , but because you need people to not have things , is wrong . 
  we should all look to make humanity better . 
  fighting piracy is mostly fighting the poor to not have nice things and shaming them for not being rich enough . 
  i download a lot and i still do n't feel so good about that . 
  because you know . 
  maybe i should eat less . 
  maybe i should be more frugal * somehow * and have enough spare money to be able to pay for like one $ 10 thing every two weeks . 
  maybe i should n't care so much about being smart and wise and entertained in my stupid life . 
  i feel especially bad about artists who are n't very rich themselves . 
  i keep a list of things i want to pay for once i have spare money . 
  i buy games i played during promotions . 
  i do n't know how to make more sense out of this thing . 
  i 'd wish to know how you guys manage this thing . 
  tl ; dr : piracy feels bad but seems like an only way to make a lot of people very happy with only one person paying for it . 
  it 's not okay to leech on artists but for a lot of us there 's no other choice anyway . 
  please tell me i 'm not crazy .
