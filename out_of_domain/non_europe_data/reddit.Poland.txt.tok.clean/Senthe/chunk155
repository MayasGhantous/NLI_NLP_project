  let 's say there 's a population of players who do n't want to play ranked for some reason ( anxiety , new champ/role , premade with rank disparity ) . 
  they can choose between blind pick and draft pick . 
  blind pick has more players so it has shorter queue times , draft pick has longer queue times but produces higher quality games . 
  i assume that draft is better quality than blind because ** draft is the only possible mode for ranked queue ** . 
  therefore draft is probably ** closer to riot 's thoughts on `` how the game should be played/how the game is the most interesting and fun '' ** . 
  you know all the advantages anyway ( bans , role select , no mirror matchups etc. ), 
  if all normal players are in one queue instead of two , there'a a bigger playerbase in this queue , so you can assure there 's better matchmaking and shorter queues than when two queues are split . 
  so ** why force all people to blind when you know it 's a worse mode ** ??? 
  why do n't force them all to draft instead , so they can have short queues , good matchmaking and also all draft 's advantages ? 
  the only difference is literally ** 2-3 additional minutes you spend on drafting ** . 
  how is 2 minutes of setup more important than quality of 30-60 minutes games that go after ? 
  it 's kind of overlooked when everybody 's focused on assasins and plants , but there were a few changes to support itemization that feel really good and fun . 
  [ redemption ] ( http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/redemption ) is a very nice new thingy . 
  +10 % heal/shield power , a bit of tankiness and sustain , and a really fun active . 
  [ aegis ] ( http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/aegis_of_the_legion ) was heavily nerfed - lost its aura , but is now way cheaper , has armor and definitely has a place in a tanky build . 
  in effect it stopped being mandatory so we can now rush something actually more fitting on ap supports . 
  locket still has aoe shield that still combos with windspeaker 's and censer , so it 's not a tragical loss . 
  [ ardent censer ] ( http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/ardent_censer ) is a bit cheaper and grants additional sustain for your adc , nothing revolutionary but still a fine item . 
  [ athene 's ] ( http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/athene%27s_unholy_grail ) now gives free hp regen for mana regen . 
  still awesome on supports that have some damage and some heals/shields . 
  [ mikael 's ] ( http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/mikael%27s_crucible ) is crazy good with +20 % heal/shield power alone . 
  also it got way cheaper and active got buffed ( heal removed but works better as cc counter ) , it 's time to buy it more often and learn to use this damn active !, 
  with windspeaker 's + redemption , ardent censer , athene 's and mikael 's ( not taking into account a gold generation item , sightstone item and boots ) we get :, 
  * +50 % heal and shield power ( ! ), 
  * +5 -22 armor , +2 -11 mr , +20 % attack speed , +20 hp drain on-hit on a healed or shielded ally for 2-3s, 
  * 50 % ( 40 % ) cdr, 
  these are stats that combo well - on top of mix of hp , ap , resists , passives and actives from each of these items . 
  they are also really cheap so it 's not that unrealistic to buy 3-4 of them in one game since mandatory locket is gone . 
  even 2 of them combo really nicely with each other . 
  i also want to point out that ruby sighstone got indirectly buffed . 
  all stuff is cheaper so rs does n't appear that costly in comparison to gold item upgrade ( 800 vs 550 gold ) , we have awesome , stable sustain so the only reason to go base is to get wards ( = more reasons to rush rs ) , its passive gives cdr to our awesome actives ( = it 's better than upgrade ) , and instead of redundant cdr it has more useful hp . 
  overall ap supports focused on sustain and utility are now in a much better spot in terms of itemization . 
  we have actually choices to make , we can afford more stuff , when we buy things they feel more impactful and fun to use , we can differentiate between ap stuff and support stuff . 
  keep up the good work riot . 
  hello , newbie here , i want to use some optimal price/performance build for about $ 600 that 'll be upgradable but will still work fine at the beginning . 
  it will be used for work and gaming , i do n't care about ultra details , but do care about overall performance and quietness . 
  this is what i came up with , looking fine for my budget when i checked in some online stores ( i will be buying in poland so not gon na include prices in pln or inaccurate usd ) :, 
  type | item, 
  ** cpu ** | intel core i5-6500 4x 3.2 ghz 6mb, 
  ** cpu cooler ** | none, 
  ** motherboard ** | asrock h110m-dgs 1151 ddr4, 
  ** memory ** | hyperx fury black 8gb 2400mhz cl15 ddr4, 
  ** graphic ** | gigabyte geforce gtx 1050 ti 4gb, 
  ** case ** | silentiumpc brutus m10 pure black usb 3.0, 
  ** power supply ** | corsair vs450w, 
  no hdd is intended , 128gb will do for some time , i will buy that later . 
  ( it 's not going to be a problem ... 
  right ? ), 
  please tell me if i missed something important , is this stuff gon na work together , or if i should replace something . 
  edit : i figured out two things . 
  us amazon is way cheaper than polish online stores so even taking into account possibility of additional taxes i might go with it . 
  also i realized that i do n't really need a gpu for my really low gaming needs and can just use integrated one , so i might take it out my first build and buy later when i have some spare money . 
  still looking for your tips guys . 
  we were sona/cait and we did n't even have time to push to lvl 2 before rengo came for our asses . 
  is this the desired state for the jungle ? 
  should i change role already ?

  hey guys , do you know any interesting league podcasts ? 
  i need in my life some engaging content that is possible to understand/enjoy without looking at it . 
  i know about beyond the rift and thorin 's thoughts but that 's all , can you recommend anything else ? 
  i need to do this pattern : http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/liams-beaver, 
  there 's one problem though , i ca n't knit , i really tried to learn but it seems i totally hate it . 
  do you know if it 's possible to kind of translate this pattern to crochet stitches ? 
  will that work ? 
  have you tried that ? 
  i 'm scared to go completely freehand . 
  i mean ... eh ... just look at it . 
  thousand years old screenshots everywhere : old items , runes , masteries ... 
  cringy texts like `` cast powerful summoner spells '' with a spell book image ... 
  `` battlefields fall into two primary game modes : classic and dominion '' - : (, 
  is there a reason rito does n't update the beginner info page for the biggest online game in the world just once a year ? 
  for example , / r/got has a rule against them . 
  please read it for context : https://www.reddit.com//r/gameofthrones/wiki/posting_policy/sex_nudity, 
  i 've been a part of / r/lol for like 3 years , i wrote hundreds or thousands of comments there . 
  i love the sub , but this issue has always bothered me . 
  unlike got , lol is n't `` mature content '' and a huge part of players is below 18 years old . 
  so yeah , there 's a lot of immature teens that sometimes choose to sexually objectify and/or harass players/casters/rioters / champions/redditors/basically everyone . 
  but does n't that mean we should have even stricter rules when it comes to sexual jokes ? 
  if some subredditors are immature , rude , or harmful to others , should n't the rules be in place to force them to behave more civilized ? 
  we kind-of have similar rules : nsfw content is not allowed , hate-speech , sexism and personal attacks are not allowed . 
  yet hundreds of cringy posts and comments about fapping to something , champions boobs sizes or other sexual fantasies are fine and even worthy of best of 2015/2016 badge ? 
  does n't make sense to me personally . 
  what do you think about that ? 
  wording that i suggest : ** `` do n't sexually objectify the players , champions , casters , rioters , streamers or other redditors , no matter their age or gender . 
  examples ( posts and a ton of comments inside them as well ) ( i was looking only for posts not more than 2 years old , as you can see these are mostly front page posts ) :, 
  you know what to do . 
  i forget about birthdays , things promised to people , meetings and appointments , and what i said i would do 10 minutes ago . 
  a lot of people are getting pissed and i feel like i ca n't help that because * i just do n't remember * to do the stuff . 
  i acknowledge that i have to do something later but when the later comes , i never recall that . 
  i can try to write everything down but i worry i 'll forget to check what i wrote ... what habits would you recommend to improve both short and long term memory ( specifically in terms of dates and commitments ) ?

  as far as working in frondend goes , my little passion is styling shit in css . 
  if you are an owner of a sub that needs some fun piece of css , but do n't know how to implement it , pm me . 
  i 've never styled a subreddit but would like to give it a go . 
  note : i 'm not really creative and i 'll definitely require a design made by other person . 
  edit :, 
  now , let me rephrase . 
  before i do anything for you :,
