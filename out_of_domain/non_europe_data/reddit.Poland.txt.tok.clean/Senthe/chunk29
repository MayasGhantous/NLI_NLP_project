  make one ap page , one ad page and one tank page . 
  some people play for years with 4 runepages and are fine . 
  grind ip and wait for 2for1 / -30 % rune sale to come ( should be soon ^ tm ) . 
  here are some calculations : https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3bo5fk/runes_and_runepages_are_not_this_expensive_if_you/, 
   you dont wan na take ap runes as a supp, 
  do n't i ? 
   you want 2 different adc runepages, 
  do i ? 
  o ___ o, 
  dude it 's better to focus on your gameplay than on if you do 600 or 580 dps in some edge ideal case . 
  runes are not as important as you think . 
   does injustice to your nation, 
  i am polish . 
  what the hell .

  sorry , i took you for the 30lvl guy for a while . 
  still , i think we can agree that skill    runes . 
  you criticized me for saying that `` usa is one of first big countries to legalize gay marriage '' . 
  now you can see that it 's true : it 's the biggest country where gay marriage is legal and one of 5 countries where gay marriage is legal with population of over 50 mln citizens . 
  how are you so sure about this ? 
  do we know personalities of all the challengers ? 
  i 'm not gay . 
  i want other people to be happy . 
  i must be super weird i guess . 
  excuse me , but an excuse for what ? 
  uhhh ok ... how is this relevant to the cultural and social stuff we are talking about ? 
  honestly i do n't give a fuck about usa pr . 
  still if you are looking for changes in social laws , culture , tradition and attitude towards for example lgbt people , being a big , influential country which can set an example to many others does fucking matter . 
  it 's not my delusional thought , it 's a fact that culture imported from usa is influential for all the europe and generally developed countries which take roots from european culture . 
  `` usa is big '' means it can be taken for example . 
  iceland does n't mean anything here , i mean , i love bjork , but that 's it . 
  bjork < hollywood , disney , warner bros etc etc. 
  lol . 
  i 've changed my first comment just to say that i 'm not american , because i got some messages from people who thought i am . 
  i do n't know why do you hate me and disrespect me so much in this conversation , i did n't do any wrong to you . 
  # \\ \\ #stayremilia, 
  i remember that guy , it was really sad . 
  still i do n't think we can assume that there 's no girl in challenger on any server only because she did n't show up to reddit going around like `` hey imma grill look at me '' for easy money . 
  i pinkward this spot in every game whenever it 's possible , it 's really really good . 
   what to do when all your lanes lose hard , leading to fed enemies and no map-control ? 
  wait for them to make a mistake , outscale them , make picks , steal baron , splitpush . 
  in the worst case , lose and proceed to the next game . 
   how to communicate with the team , in order that nobody sees you are `` flaming '' them ? 
  just do n't be a jerk ? 
  do n't tell them `` why didnt you do xyz omg retard '' but instead `` hey maybe you could do xyz next time please '' . 
  remember that they are just people . 
   how to communicate better with your support during laning phase , and what to do if you notice that he/she is not particularly gifted ? 
  as a support main i can ask : please ping and react . 
  supports are really busy in the laning phase , constantly thinking about possible ganks , deepwards , roams , dragon , and having to deal with 2 enemies on top of this . 
  most often it 's support who will set pace of your lane . 
  try to react to their action if you can not losing cs . 
  if you are sure that you know better than the support how to play in given situation , ping a lot and write to them things like `` dont push '' or `` dont leave now '' or `` dont go in oom '' or `` allin at 6 '' or `` 100 gold to bf '' ( this one is important !, 
  it gives the support time to plan his back or roam ) . 
   how to help your team the most as an adc ? 
  do n't die . 
  you are team 's main tool to take objectives . 
  you do n't even need to do as much dmg in fights as long as your team is able to win it and you are still alive after to quickly take this turret and inhib . 
   and , how to be less team dependent as an adc ? 
  it 's a team game . 
  you wo n't solo carry . 
  better get used to it . 
  if you really want you can buy a lot of wards and ga in case noone peels for you , but honestly it 's rather pointless to hope that you could 1v5 without any help when entire enemy team focuses you . 
  i just tried to be optimistic : (, 
  did you forget switch ( kek ) or is it just some dark python magic ? 
  that 's not what it says . 
  ommiting switch is not a good pseudo code practice ; ), 
  lol no, 
  facechecked bot brush anyone ? 
  and all the challengers start w ? 
  [ gee i wonder why are n't aphro , krepo , smoothie , mata or dexter silver yet ] ( http://www.probuilds.net/champions/bard ), 
  but but , he is super sick with devourer : (, 
  yeah but enemy jungler does n't necessarily have to go devourer if you do it , right ? 
  double-edged sword ? 
  ** adaptive armor mastery ** - when is it worth using ? 
  he can build full tank and do as much dmg to champs as carries ... 
  he ca n't be official manager , coach or owner recognized by riot , but can work with a team in any other way , like any analyst for example . 
  it just means they wo n't let him get on scene . 
  she 's important because she 's the first female player to compete in lcs . 
  as a grill myself i am happy that it 's finally happening . 
  she is considered a female by me , for me it 's enough o __ o, 
  i mean , they were all fine in the last year , then suddenly playoffs happen and twitch chat and reddit goes `` omg pings too loud '' . 
  i guess riot had to change something . 
  and i agree they need to change it back , i noticed it as well .
