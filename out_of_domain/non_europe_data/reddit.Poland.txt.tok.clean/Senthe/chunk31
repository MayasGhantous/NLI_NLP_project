  i 've played about 150-200 games with soraka and this can surprise you but i actually tried to peel with e more than one time . 
  it 's super easy to play around it and it has really long cd if not maxed after w. basically it shines in 5v5 teamfight but not in skirmishes initiated by enemy . 
  talking about casting e more than one-two times in a skirmish is a fantasy . 
  this aoe damage is sick in lane tho ... 
  / thread, 
  i play at 60-70 and it is bad , but nothing to do besides getting used to it : (, 
  do n't make me cry, 
  not anymore . 
  i tried it and liked it , but he is more a hard to learn niche pick than a legit support choice ( lack of hard cc makes him good almost only versus aa heavy , melee , bad engage teams ) . 
  but still , it 's definitely worth checking out !, 
  changed passive helps him a lot in lane . 
  [ here you an find my thoughts about it . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegendsmeta/comments/3g08en/teemo_support_after_rework/ ), 
  guys . 
  it 's possible to get even more movement speed . 
  can somebody calculate the most movement speed possible to get ? 
  you know , for science ... 
  which he actually is n't . 
  with cinderhulk it 's easy to get 200-250 . 
  actually his ult has really short range , so it 's more like `` transporting from base up to inhib turret '' ... 
  well ... do n't get eaten : ^ ), 
  as a soraka main , playing her over a year now , i want you to know this before you take her to soloq : if your team does n't enage or fight and when ahead still just runs around like chickens without heads ( so typical silver-gold ranked experience ) , there 's literally nothing you can do . 
  nothing . 
  no waveclear , no poke , no taking jungle , no making picks . 
  nothing . 
  i had many times as a fairly fed soraka when i found myself running around and doing nothing specific , with decent vision and core items , just waiting for * something * to happen . 
  you must follow your team and that 's basically the only job you have . 
  most you can do with uncoordinated team is to buy banner , in edge cases zz ` rot , keep up with vision game and pray for any fight to happen . 
  when well positioned , soraka will often mean autowin in teamfights , especially when her team engages balls deep ; just remember that in soloq you have no way to make your team make * you * useful . 
  or do n't they : , 
  oh right , i forgot about this one !, 
  still , it 's only a loop , would be more interesting to actually calculate bonuses possible to get in one team ... 
  to be fair i personally think that tahm with the new items is super ultra broken , but i will keep it to myself . 
  * proceeds to do 500 mixed damage on every aa *, 
  i see random stupid fights as much as random stupid doing nothing . 
  i mean , you can always try to outplay enemies in a stupid unfavorable fight , but soraka has no response to passiveness of her team . 
  without a teammate fighting next to her she is pure uselessness . 
  i had a game as soraka playing with very low friends , like lvl20 , and got matched with extremely low ( for me ) enemies . 
  i never felt as useless as in this game , running around after people who had no plans whatsoever , looking for random skirmishes and ** not being able to carry my team ** even having my items etc , when on basically every other champ i could do this playing with one hand . 
  i tried shotcalling , they tried to follow , but often were too afraid to fight . 
  after 50 minutes of being ahead and doing nothing i threw the game ( bad call ) because i got so sick of it . 
  brrrrr , it still gives me nightmares : /, 
  so you mean , if i think i 'm better than my ranked mmr and want to climb ( so i 'm 100 % of the ranked community ) , the best i can do is to play snowballing carries ? 
  nice : |, 
  would n't reccomend soraka for low elo , if her teammates do n't fight or do stupid things she becomes useless , because literally only thing she can do is to follow her team . 
  better to pick up sona who does n't always have to follow every , even the dumbest call , can build decent damage , waveclear , has more reliable cc and is less skillshot dependent . 
  ( i say that as a silver support main who loves to play both soraka and sona . ), 
  she is a lot more team dependent ( and i think overall a lot more useful for her team ) , so it makes sense that she is played in high elo and even in lcs more than sona . 
  it does n't make her a good pick for climbing rank in low elo soloq tho . 
  ( i tried : ( ), 
  with hard something else : ^ ), 
  if we get behind and everyone but me tilts , i will still prefer to surrender , because it 's no point to try and carry people who already gave up . 
  at least they were in the kikis era , rip [ * ], 
  not worth the time tbh, 
  i need a go-to pick for toplane in silver-gold . 
  is ** maokai ** worth picking up if i did n't play him yet but i think i 'd like his playstyle ? 
  why or why not ? 
  you mean pings ? 
  same . 
  i do n't know this game anymore . 
  how is `` kill and assist for kill without assist '' an edge case ? 
  it can happen in every gank . 
  i guess tahm kench/lulu . 
  i plan to abuse bad positioning , but is n't maokai better for this sole reason ? 
  to root people in bad position on fairly low cd instead of ulting on long cd ? 
  i 've been thinging about him as well !, 
  he 's more like a tanky carry though , if he falls behind , with his cc i do n't see him being very useful mid-late ... 
  was n't it like this in lol season 1 as well ? 
  i can play tahm kench , rek ` sai and udyr and they are super fun , but i 'm looking for one strong pick useful in every situation . 
  i do n't play toplane almost at all and i 've been working at actually narrowing my champion pool . 
  so , for support which i main i have 4-5 champs , for jungle 2-3 and for mid/top 1 . 
  for `` one to rule them all '' pick i feel like more appriopriate would be cc oriented utility tank than a juggernaut or tanky bruiser . 
  ^ for ^ those ^ interested , ^ my ^ current ^ list :, 
  * ^ bard ^ ( flex ), 
  * ^ sona ^ ( lane ), 
  * ^ leona ^ ( tank ), 
  * ^ amumu ^ ( clear ), 
  * ^ jinx ^ ( teamfight ), 
  * ^ tristana ^ ( objective ), 
  * ^ sivir ^ anti ^ cc, 
  okay , thank you : ), 
  the point is , i assume that most of the time i will lose the lane , just because it 's my worst lane . 
  so i want to pick a champ which will be mainly useful to his team regardless if behind , and cc/tramfight oriented . 
  nasus is completely not my type of champion , i like to group and not be alone < 3, 
  csing is not really a problem for me , i spent first months in lol trying to learn anivia : ^ ) honestly i would worry more about itemisation completely different from ap items i 'm used to . 
  i think i can handle engage , but you are the first person mentioning mundo ... for some reason he seems to be forgotten , any idea why ? 
  it 's not a tutorial . 
  it 's a book . 
  ( edit they suggested the ng-book . ), 
  can confirm . 
  i played him a lot and lost a couple of fights because i ate a wrong person or even a minion instead of a champion . 
  it does n't matter this much i feel . 
  i just want to fast learn the basics . 
  in both they should be pretty much the same ( i guess ) . 
  also , the new items . 
  the guy is crazy right now , altough i think as support is actually a lot worse than top and jungle . 
  ( friendly reminder , when you eat ally it does n't save them from aoe you stand in . ), 
  thanks , i 'm doing their tutorial right now , looks really helpful . 
  uhh ... 
  i thought that actually he was supposed to be gated by high mana costs ? ...
