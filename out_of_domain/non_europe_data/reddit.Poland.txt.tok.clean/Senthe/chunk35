  ye ye of course , good supports never get caught , just like good players never lose games . 
  i was talking about soraka not kog ? 
  it 's far from what i would call `` tank build '' . 
  and it has plenty of ap for a zero damage support . 
  hmmm i think you 're right : ) have n't put enough thought into it . 
  thanks !, 
  thank you kind sir < 3, 
  you consider 40 mr a tank item ? 
  also locket is often replaced by banner . 
  ye ye because 3s of cc lock do n't mean dead soraka .

  actually tahm kench top/jungle is built like ap tank , definitely not like a burst mage .

  and i thought i 'm doing something wrong : |, 
  jesus this is so disgusting, 
  it 's also very much about them being manaless and shoving lane / poking for free early in lane . 
  i always preferred literature and art over science , wanted to be a writer , became a webdev . 
  wtf do n't complain about no gold , do n't get gold, 
  i never realized it 's possible to calculate it like this ingame . 
  wow . 
  aww thanks . 
  english is not my native language but i 'm trying . 
  you mean an ally , for enemies it works this way already . 
  sorry but the strongest ability in game is veigar 's event horizon . 
  i do n't care if troll is happy or if troll is sad . 
  i care if i am happy or sad , and what makes me sad is playing a game with a troll . 
  i always dodge . 
  oh gawd i 'm so hyped for this team . 
  it literally goes like, 
  2 . roll into enemy team, 
  3 . press w, 
  5 . most damage dealt xd, 
  this . 
  game is not all about winning but about enjoying your time as well . 
  does anyone know what `` zz '' means ? 
  so in translation `` lololol '' ? 
  do n't think so . 
  not worth the mastery . 
  there is a cost tho : having a super squishy immobile support without engage , without disengage , without damage , without interesting utility , basically having almost no skills but heals . 
  her silence is good but does n't make up for entire missing kit . 
  compare her kit to thresh , bard , naut , leona . 
  some champs have interesting kits and some have raw power ; tahm is so obnoxious coz he has both , thresh was there also for a some time , but soraka has literally nothing but her heal , her kit does n't do shit other than healing . 
  this is what makes her fair . 
  playing soraka is literally going like `` oh this guy is low , heal him , oh now she is low , heal her , oh someone dived us , silence , ok they backed , spam q , oh no we are all super low , ult '' . 
  the end . 
  this is what she can do in a game besides item actives . 
  it 's interestiong , one problem though : rageblade will probably get nerfed soon . 
  she was n't that good in soloq before those buffs . 
  she 's strong in lane but hella weak when she roams and wards or is outnumbered and can be immediately jumped on . 
  you can beat her by vision , making picks , burst . 
  she has almost no self peel . 
  people cry about her lane and teamfighting like ideally spherical 2v2 or 5v5 were the only thing that happens in soloq . 
  more like getting dead . 
  ps i hate you : p, 
  * spams lulu laugh *, 
  but it 's only numbers , not like her playstyle changed . 
  and people do n't say like `` oh no she heals too much '' but `` oh no it 's impossible to fight with her , now i have to focus support , wtf ?? '' . 
  she still has the same very clear weaknesses and strenghts , just got a bit overbuffed with the same old stuff . 
  nerf her numbers and she will be fine ( and yeah you will still need to focus her , guys ) . 
  same applies to any squishy . 
  if she has better positioning and is smarter than you then maybe she deserves to win the fight , idk . 
  this guy did n't read preseason notes . 
  i played both of them . 
  tahm was and is obnoxious in every role but soraka was balanced as a support . 
  clear strengths and weaknesses . 
  being annoying when played well does n't necessarily make a champ op . 
  look at riven or rengar . 
  worst patch ever, 
  it 's still `` she heals too much '' . 
  this is what grievous wounds were doing vs her . 
  made her heal less . 
  everything else than amount of hp she gives to her allies is exactly the same . 
  lol it 's amazing word play . 
  i love it . 
  yep . 
  no dude , there 's a lot of people there arguing exactly that there 's nothing you can do against her . 
  look at op post . 
  it 's awesome in teamfight/siege/dive but not in any other scenario when people actually have some place around them and can literally walk out of it without any trouble . 
  basically it 's good enough to zone but not to make plays . 
  so - a weak cc . 
  she has also slow on q but it 's laughably bad . 
  i think usually soraka does n't try to poke wit q but to heal . 
  some sorakas will even max q last because selfheal scales with points in w anyway . 
  i have one advice for you . 
  do n't play draven vs soraka . 
  i know it seems like he can kill hr with op dmg early but i assure you in this matchup you will never poke her down . 
  she will land every q ( either that or you can just not catch axes i guess ) . 
  i do n't know , for example adrian seems to keep cdr boots entire game on soraka and nami , and i ca n't quite understand why . 
  well if you prefer to play aram from 15th minute ... 
  lol but it does n't matter how unintuitive it feels , if it makes you win the fight it 's worth it right ? 
  i reccomend taking him jungle .
