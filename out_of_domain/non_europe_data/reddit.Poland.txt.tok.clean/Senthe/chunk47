  for justice !, 
  as a turret main i hate this season . 
  by ` thunderlord bard ' you got ta mean ` bard with half a brain ' . 
  no other keystone makes any sense on him anyway . 
  by ` flavor of the month ' you got ta mean ` the only thing that works on him this month ' ; ), 
  i keep forgetting people here are this young . 
  i cry evrtiem . 
  this is me in bronze almost every game . 
  uhhh there are other reasons to share things in the internet , for example when you want to get some feedback , new knowledge , new thoughts about what you did . 
  not everyone is mindless attention/likes/karma collector . 
  what a nice statistics , source ? 
  what a nice pulling things out of your ass and calling it knowledge . 
  even if they have vision it does n't mean that lane is ungankable . 
  it depends on elo . 
  low she 's godly , high she 's trash . 
  this kills soraka . 
  do n't worry , she 's completely dead now . 
  entire game is balanced around the fact that turrets do physical damage . 
  all physical/magical damage champions . 
  not true . 
  you are supposed to support whole team , not only one person . 
  i usually ignore adc midgame and go roam . 
  they go either farm mode or feed mode anyway , nothing to do here . 
  ( i 'm bronze i right now , last season silver ii , low elo is really like this , mid usually is more important than adc anyway in terms of damage since it 's an easier role to stay alive and put out dps ) . 
  trying to clear random three minions as soraka is painful enough . 
  map awareness is mostly about predicting enemy movement without any wards ... 
  if you do n't see them on the map you have to think about last time you saw them , where would you go if you were them , what would that mean in terms of a threat , how can you prevent that threat . 
  this is a `` i have to carry '' mentality . 
  no , you do n't provide shit to your losing team with ap blitz . 
  if you built properly maybe you 'd be at least somewhat useful , but nooo , you have to carry . 
  and that means doing damage obviously , not like , being helpful to your team . 
  meh man you deserve to lose with brilliant ideas like this . 
  lol , playing using a brain is how you get out of bronze , not doing stupid shit and hoping it 'll miraculously work . 
  and do n't listen to assholes who think you have to `` carry '' . 
  yeah you have to be better player than your team and enemy team to climb , this is how ranked system works , but being better player means just this , being better player and having all qualities of a better player , not only doing more damage and having better kda or something . 
  only some champs are able to counterjungle you lvl 1-3 . 
  you have to be able to recognize which ones can do this do your champ in a given game . 
  counterjungling generally is easy and dangerous strategy low elo coz your laners often wo n't help you at all when you 're invaded . 
  if you pick a champ that you know is vulnerable to invade , ask your laners to ward possible routes ( `` top plz ward my red 1:55 '' ) and ward them yourself , especially doing your second buff . 
  sometimes even without a ward good junglers can `` feel '' there 's enemy in this bush and prepare to attack . 
  if you do n't know what to do and there 's enemy jungler around and they can kill you , you can also give up your buff completely and go somewhere else or even countercounterjungle . 
  giving out first blood with a buff early is a big deal so being super careful here is a smart thing to do . 
  not that many of them exists out there . 
  remember that in esports players will always understand the game better than coaches , this ai n't football . 
  one of the coaches was talking about this in an ama . 
  there 's no way coach can play more than 5 players combined to get the meta for every role better than them . 
  and since meta changes very fast there 's little possibility and time to analyse it every single patch . 
  hence coaches in esports must listen to players when it comes to the game knowledge . 
  no , not really . 
  being dead makes dealing damage quite hard . 
  it 's not the same thing ... 
  when was it ? 
  yes, 
  yeah you can get more but on another champ . 
  lustboy senpai , do you miss us ? 
  this is so wise , seriously . 
  this is so incredible and useless at the same time . 
  i 'm astonished . 
  when i play leo vs blitz i just stand between him and my adc all laning phase and wait for him to lose his patience and pull me . 
  it never ends up well for them . 
  when i play bard i 'd probably could do this but usually i prefer hiding in enemy side botlane bush and stun on lvl 1 for half enemy adc hp . 
  i do n't know , maybe i 'll try it anyway some time , it seems fun . 
  i am interested and i got an idea which could make some money but needs quite a lot of money ( video game nerdy stuff ) . 
  drop me a pm if you are still looking . 
  dude ... no ... 
  we already have 5 adc comps ? ... 
  teemo support ? 
  hello ?? 
  rerolled three skin shards to 2000 karma , wurf, 
  d : i want, 
  it never happened in previous seasons , a fact it 's possible in proffesional game with two probably best teams in the world is super sad . 
  to be honest i played a lot of games with randoms which were super enjoyable and with a lot of teamwork going on . 
  it 's actually possible because ranked system is designed in a way where you need to play a lot and a lot of games only to `` prove '' you `` deserve '' some rank . 
  you need to win series , you need to grind lp and so on . 
  you will win some series , you will lose some , even if you are faker . 
  some games will be unwinnable , some you will get carried ... 
  in all this randomness it 's hard to determine if you should be higher or lower really . 
  what does that even mean if you have 51 % winrate ? 
  some people with this winrate will stay in their elo forever and some will climb for no apparent reason . 
  yeah you get more lp the more mmr you got , but for some reason you are not instaplaced where you `` should '' be according to mmr ( and reason is ofc riot wanting people to play a lot , be addicted and pay for content , and it 's ok ) . 
  generally if you do n't have the time to grind games you will end up a lot lower than you should be in a ladder . 
  and vice versa if you have a lot of time you will probably be a bit higher just from spamming alone because the system is twisted . 
  what i want to say : not only player pure skill ** in a given moment ** but also time they invested into spamming games ** before that moment ** are factors determining rank ** in that moment ** . 
  no problem man . 
  i think this game just demands learning some mentality that shitty teammates are just not important - if you want to have fun , and if you want to climb , you will , even if people around you are shitty and depressing . 
  if you do n't want to deal with this shit ( and i totally get it if you do n't ) it 's just not a game for you probably , unless you have a bunch of friends to play with . 
  i do n't say you are not better , just ranked system takes into account two things instead of one , and people forget about it . 
  i think they initially wanted rush , but then he declined and they fell back to sven . 
  i mean , come on , who would n't prefer rush . 
  yep i agree and this is why rush did n't want to play in tsm , and it was a very good decision for him . 
  they just destroyed yellowstar in similar way , get the veteran shotcaller , do n't let him shotcall lol . 
  this is super cute !, 
  what is your technique ? 
  well i live in poland and the best paper for origami we can get here is the kraft paper and i got it only recently . 
  sad to admit but i always folded with low gramature copy paper or small squares used for notes or decorative wrapping paper and stuff like this . 
  my first washi sheets , the biggest 15 cm , are on their way to me now ... 
  i hope i will be able to afford more interesting papers in near future . 
  well if they again decide to release a super big patch changing entirely a few champs and adding unbalanced items right before worlds then yeah it will ... 
  yep i 'm so fine with this,
