  this is fucking massive . 
  you can never die and get any turret you want if you play this smart . 
  only way to throw 3 air dragons is to be super behind and get super heavy engaged under nexus turrets . 
  umm your arguments are so convincing ? 
  yeah exactly , choosing between meta/mained ( strong/fun ) champs is hard enough already . 
  yeah dude let 's go with that toxicity meme which makes perfect sense in every case !, 
  because :, 
  * every change is awesome , only those stupid people wo n't do what we want them to and wo n't enjoy what we planned they should . 
  how dare they behave and feel like humans !, 
  * mute button solves every problem on earth and makes games 500 % more enjoyable . 
  people who have problems with flame just never heard of the mute button . 
  if they heard they would just use this button and stop complaining immediately . 
  * toxicity is not a problem whatsoever and never caused anyone to enjoy the game less . 
  * dodging ? 
  what is dodging ? 
  no sane person would ever dodge . 
  we should assume this is no factor . 
  * nobody wants to pick champs that they like to play , everybody loves picking champs who are the strongest at the moment , determined by teamcomp/dragons/meta / rioters ' mood . 
  * a game should n't be fun and enjoyable . 
  only noncompetitive pussies would want that . 
  * if you do n't like it just do n't play it !!!!, 
  curious as well . 
  it 's awesome . 
  : ) good job . 
  i 'm not that talented and/or devoted , unfortunately . 
  maybe that 's part of my problem . 
  i completely ca n't afford the paper and shipping ( decent origami paper is not available anywhere in my country , believe me i looked for it for a long time ) . 
  i just fold from whatever paper i have available at the moment . 
  but it 's not only about me folding , because i do n't like some models folded from excellent paper by experienced artists . 
  i just do n't get them . 
  on eune i get called `` polish '' . 
  i am polish and i am still offended . 
  i love the case study idea . 
  please keep it up . 
  i 'd totally like to link here something awesome . 
  but i 'm sorry , i lost/destroyed/gave away most of the models i was proud about when i moved a few months ago and i do n't have pretty photos . 
  recently i fold mostly minicranes from 1inch to make jewelry out of them and i do n't think they are particularly interesting . 
  generally i feel like nothing i do is impressive enough to show off ... well i had those quite well-received threads here some time ago , but those are not about origami mastery at all , more like trying to figure out a new technique . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/origami/comments/4bio7o/i_made_origami_enhanced_with_embroidery_have_you/ ) and [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/origami/comments/4f7kl6/embroided_origami_part_2_flower_crane/ ) . 
  ok , thanks a lot . 
  it 's hard to translate this kind of terminology . 
  i 'm super happy you like the technique , have fun and make sure to post what you can make with it . 
  yeah i tried to , like small patterns on wings . 
  opposite side usually looks terrible . 
  you can also try to hide ugly stitches between some layers . 
  it 's quite hard but achievable . 
  certainly would require some careful planning and good understanding how the thread works . 
  looks real cool but i would n't dare to seriously use it ... 
  it 's only js , you do n't have any * real * control over what happens . 
  yeah maybe you can achieve some cool effects on front but overall whatever happens you will still need validation on backend . 
  and from this there 's one step to just going back to using your backend/frontend frameworks to do their job and communicate about their booleans instead of using external service to listen for js events . 
  it was a nice country ... what happens here lately is unbelievable , unacceptable , and makes me hate this place ... 
  but yeah i guess kids from lol do n't have any idea . 
  more like :, 
  while ( dynamicq = = ` unbalanced ' ) {, 
  bring_back_soloq ( ) ;, 
  how, 
  while ( ! dynamicq_balanced ( ) ) {, 
  bring_back_soloq ( ) ;, 
  dynamicq_balanced = function ( ) {, 
  / / add any conditions, 
  return dynamicq.balanced ;, 
  from this patch ? 
  omg i have to buy like 10 of them . 
  mastery 6 bard and sona here i come, 
  i was quite sure it 's just a meme , but it 's not a meme , he actually did . 
  what a shame . 
  how old are you ? 
  meh it 's not dying . 
  no version control ? 
  wtf ? 
  how is that even possible ? 
  it 's `` her '' , actually : ) . 
  i bet he a ) could afford to do it b ) got enough experience to get another , awesome job . 
  in it you can get a job basically at any moment if you want to and if you have any experience multiple recruiters would fight over you . 
  i am completely sure that this guy is fine now . 
  uh ... what ... 
  this is ... unbelievable ... hnnnnng, 
  one of my friends ended a game despite me asking him not to , when i was 2cs short of final twisted fate icon . 
  i forgot to play one more game and i ended up without it . 
  i am still pissed . 
   what kind of strict regulations, 
  idk maybe forbidding random people to buy guns , like most civilized countries already did , would help, 
  srsly us people , get your shit together and do this already , it 's horrifying to read about all those poor people gunshot by some random assholes . 
  put a stop to this , it 's really not that hard : (, 
  which statistics regarding gunshots in countries that forbade them and countries which did n't cleary prove right ? 
  not really . 
  do n't defend lost cause mate , this law sucks balls . 
  unpleasant . 
  more like a millimeter . 
  can confirm , this is just stupid . 
  6 seconds on level 16 . 
  six . 
  seconds . 
  good luck with shutting this down . 
  every harass you hit him with you get 6 seconds window of opportunity to catch him again ... that 's not much , seriously , there 's no other carry who would be this safe late ... 
  how can be a guy be useless with this ult ? 
  it 's super hard cc , great for shutting down carries late , and passive makes him very hard to peel off . 
  a tank she will poke down before an all in is possible . 
  she has more damage any healer can sustain .
