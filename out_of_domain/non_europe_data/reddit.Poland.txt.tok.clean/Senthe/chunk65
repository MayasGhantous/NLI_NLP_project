  they will probably blow it anyway . 
  okay , makes sense . 
  thanks . 
  again , great job . 
  looking forward to testing it . 
  i created a [ nests map ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1foyxzshrar-zolmydqzonwq_9s4 ) for my city . 
  nothing big but it works . 
  it 's crowd-sourced . 
  i also made a [ big post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/thesilphroad/comments/4tqenx/nests_spawns_local_map_and_you_possible/ ) about it but nobody really noticed . 
  this was right before pokevision became a thing . 
  i think in my city there can be about 10-20 real nests , and maybe some mostly-reliable spawns of some rare pokemon . 
  but generally i do n't think there 's that much work to do . 
  i made this map for my city in close to no time , relying on reports from other players . 
  it 's just a matter of checking if the nest really works ( some on my map are n't thoroughly checked yet ) . 
  this should take up to two weeks in any big city . 
  we have this saying `` this is how free market works '' . 
  say thank you to capitalism bro . 
  it 's true that hardcore players want more . 
  maybe , maybe if their data shows that hardcore pay more than casuals , maybe then they will care about better battling . 
  i mean , maybe . 
  but i do n't really believe that . 
  it 's mobile game with big ip behind it . 
  mobile games tend to contain a lot of grind and minimal mechanics and this apparently sells . 
  sure , it 's all about priorities . 
   ! remindme 7 days, 
  maybe he practices beating every gym with his starter . 
  i mean , western and eastern europe are also kinda big ... 
  i feel like this data will be mostly worthless . 
  elephants live in asia tho , rite ? 
  just different piece of asia than you i guess . 
  yep , i recalculated it , it 's perfect . 
  congratulations m8 , now only be careful not to transfer it : p, 
  dragonite is everywhere in my city though , we have a dratini nest in one park . 
  i think it just depends on local meta which one is better . 
  jars of mayo will never be the same . 
  yeah and then it suddenly bugs out and you transfer it anyway cause you were sure it 's not a favorite . 
  oops . 
  but i was talking only about elephants ? ... 
  all great questions , really sad nobody bothered to respond . 
  i 'll try for those i think i know the answer . 
  ** how much difference in combat power is there between a 0 atk iv pokemon and a 15 atk iv pokemon on average ? 
  you can compare it in this example table : http://pokemongo.gamepress.gg/pokemon/6 - it seems at all levels it 's about 16 % between the best and the worst cp . 
  ( remember cp is calculated form all three stats , so it 's difference between 0/0/0 - 15/15/15 ), 
  ** is it worth spending all the extra dust and candy to level up a 180 cp 77-88 iv krabby over my 1006 cp 75-84 iv kingler ? 
  assuming both have ideal move sets and the upper tier of their iv range . 
  most definitely 2 % difference in ivs is completely not important , way more important in combats will be things like your internet connection and phone hardware . 
  do n't even bother about it . 
  ** what 's the bare minimum % of iv that you feel is worth keeping ? 
  depends on pokemon species . 
  for common species i wo n't invest below 95 % , for very rare s-tier species 80 % or 70 % will still be worth investing . 
  ** would you take a 30 % hit in iv values if the lower end one has frost breath ( ideal ) versus the higher end one having ice shard ( suboptimal ) ? 
  yes . 
  moveset is way more important than iv . 
  choose moveset over iv every day . 
  ** are the pokemon lured to the lure affected by the trainer level of the person who put down the lure ? 
  it seems that lower level lures spawned lower level pokemon while checking people out downtown ? 
  personally i think it 's confirmation bias and pokemon level depends only on your own level . 
  ** is there any clarification on how the pools of pokemon are picked ? 
  even though i was at a lake area with tonnes of water pokemon , all my 3 lures ( 3 x 30m , not all at once as there 's no overlapping area ) seemed to spawn were more rattata , pidgeys , weedles etc. 
  while when i was walking around just outside of the boundaries of the lure i 'd find poliwag , staryu , psyduck etc. 
  there was suggestion that lure spawns only pokemon from terrain type in the exact point the pokestop is placed , and not general area . 
  so pokestop in water = water pokemon , pokestop in some park near water = no water pokemon . 
  but i do n't know whether it was confirmed . 
  ** has anyone found a timer for when specific pokemon spawn ? 
  i know there 's a dratini spawn about 30 minutes away from me , but they do n't seem to spawn too often . 
  i think it 's more like : every spawn point spawns a pokemon each x minutes , and there 's some % chance for every possible species , which maybe changes in time so the rare species have growing chance . 
  but i do n't know if that 's correct . 
  ** as stated previously , the amount of pokemon in one location seems to be related to the amount of cellular activity . 
  however is it from current activity or overall registered activity over longer periods of time ? 
  i strongly believe it 's about some long period of time and does n't correlate with `` cellular activity '' , but rather ingress players activity . 
  i have no idea how niantic could possibly collect data about actual `` cellular activity '' in any given place at any given time . 
  ** is it safer to * find * a max evolution pokemon and pray for good iv + correct moveset or evolve a high iv base pokemon and hope they do n't go full retard with their moveset ? 
  both will work , it 's just a matter of candies/time efficiency in your area . 
  for some people it 's easier to catch 400 dratinis to try to evolve some good iv one , for some people it 's completely impossible and they look only for dragonites with decent moveset and iv . 
  ** does the size of the ring only matter if you actually hit nice , great or excellent ? 
  or does it always increase odds . 
  i think it only matters when you hit it . 
  otherwise it would n't really make sense . 
  ** i 've had an eevee break out of an ultraball 4 times , but caught it with my 5th ball , it being a regular pokeball . 
  i 've noticed this a few more times with other pokemon . 
  are some pokemon caught more easily with different kind of balls ? 
  i figured the better the ball the higher the chance of capture ? 
  i heard stories of people with similar experiences but i believe it 's still confirmation bias . 
  i am not level 20 yet though . 
  maybe it 's some weird bug . 
  god now i realized how much i miss dunkey 's league bideos : (, 
  this . 
  you should n't be the one who brings this story to public . 
  it 's not your story . 
  can confirm , this is me . 
  every time i see those `` clothes '' i cringe so hard . 
  third or half of them is actually completely fine in aram . 
  for me it 's not about playing champs i do n't own , i just want aram to be balanced ... 
  i do n't give a shit about champions i do n't have ... 
  yeah and they get up and ace your team . 
  and then by the time they go down the lane , half of you team gets up and aces their team . 
  it really can go like this for a long time . 
  at least this is my experience with long aram games . 
  i reposted in my local fb group : ), 
  okay .
