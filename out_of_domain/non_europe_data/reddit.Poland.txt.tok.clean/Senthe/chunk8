  maybe you do n't want to , but you have to . 
  be brave little yordle , be brave, 
  is this wood 14 ? 
   as a support , your entire existence is making sure that your lane wo n't lose, 
  um ... that 's just not true . 
  if your adc is shitty , go roam , help on other lanes , do n't waste time . 
  also supports can help in teamfights a lot . 
  support is not their adcs use-and-throw-away bitch or something . 
  o __ o, 
  meh you have jump you will be fine ; p, 
  if that vayne was plat 5 , i deserve challenjour . 
   imagine 20/0 katarina running around with one item because of 50 cs in 15min, 
  you convinced me . 
  omg sick bastard why would you even think of it , gross, 
  that is actually so true , i 'm sick of enemy supports going `` lol so u wanted to sweep my ward , there , have another one & fuck you '' . 
  if with cheaper trinkets they tried also to get rid of yolowards by increasing their hiding time , that would be another good step to make in this direction . 
  lol this can actually work , thanks op xd, 
  and then they still do n't take you to the west . 
  `` gg vayne carried '', 
  dat particles . 
  i do n't even . 
  you better main support . 
  i 've played for like 3 hours . 
  i want to send my best regards to the guest533691 aka ** cancer cell ** - was nice to meet you bro ; ), 
  wow , right , the pentagon ... so true and so sad : |, 
  i do n't think that azir can do as much dmg as anivia so reliably through all the game long . 
  she also has nice cc . 
  her problems are outdated mana costs , ms and q projectile speed . 
  i know right , it 's just stupid . 
  wrong . 
  i 'd really apprieciate if you 'd send the results to everyone !, 
  who cares about 30 older champs if you can have one to rule them all , right . 
  new `` ca n't walk but 0.5 s cd dash '' champ confirmed, 
  hey you 're right , we already have this one, 
  now i guess we need only `` knockup on every aa '', 
  do we ? 
  it 's not about winrate , it 's all about fun to play and to play against . 
  that ... that is beautiful . 
  ap too good -  kill, 
  lee sin too good -  good, 
  i do n't get it as well . 
   and no he is not low range , he has a very high range poke . 
  it 's over 9000 . 
  ftfy, 
  * every * champ ? 
  not after dmg nerf . 
  how is that wrong ? 
  no , not this op , if you are traveling burried you do n't see shit and often have no idea who is this blip walking through the river and what to do with it . 
  ( unless you have , well , vision on most enemies on map . ), 
  unburrying to see wtf is goin on and burrying agan takes a lot of time and leaves you without any escape for couple of seconds . 
  so i think the vision thing just balances itself . 
  if they do n't move , rek ` sai wo n't sense them ( which is actually good counterplay to her ) . 
  tell us some more about it, 
  my biggest mistake is hating boring lone island toplane and having no clue what toplane champs do and how their matchups work . 
  man , i 'm so sorry to write this , but get a fuckin ' life ... 
   something needs to go . 
  either his tank stats , his damage , or his utility . 
  he can not keep all three . 
  this !, 
  but i do n't want to go there in the first place , also how evil can u be to recommend me playing riven wtf ; __ ;, 
  ok , remembered , thanks . 
  this really helps , many thanks !, 
  hey her knockup has like 10s cooldown , totally not op . 
  hey that 's interesting idea , will surely try this one . 
  and ~ 5s on different targets ( bury cd + casting time of burrying and unburrying ) . 
  still not op ? 
  hey , the mods deleted the entire `` rammus ok '' awesome thread . 
  never forget , never forgive, 
  strawpoll will do . 
  i 'd appreciate if you could pm me source of this information , thanks !, 
  `` we need more wards , raka go ward ure support '', 
  `` i have 3 wards on map '', 
  `` ward more '', 
  `` but ... '', 
  `` more '', 
  the dream d :, 
  in the bushes *, 
  actually could n't adblock load the content and then hide it from user through css anyway ? 
  never really though of it , but would n't it be obvious win-win ( assuming that traffic does n't really matter ) ? 
  thought that entire idea of adblock * is * against ad providers . 
  css tweak can be performed entirely on client 's side , so it has nothing to do with page owner . 
  lol when you think of it this is so true . 
  omg dude . 
  what was so wrong with your computer ? 
  hey but i want to enjoy the rank more . 
  also the gold + rewards are real . 
  and what is it supposed to do, 
  are you kidding me \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  jesus what a rape . 
  i experience it with every tristana . 
  thought it was the rework bug . 
  i would enjoy the video only if he was worse . 
  the other way it 's no fun . 
  probably *, 
  well i do n't know , do i really need to buy a pink when i have one in a good spot and does n't need another for any specific reason ? 
  it takes time to adapt to changes to get a 50 % winrate again after a nerf . 
  previous fizz was freelo , current is not . 
  let all the fizz lame `` mains '' stop playing him and go for something else , his winrate will go up . 
  if they are better , of course champ alone will not win you game . 
  bad fizz will be shat on by the good anivia etc.
