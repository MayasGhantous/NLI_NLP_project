  because they do that for lulz on stream ? 
  yup exactly . 
  they can be any rank but similar mmr . 
  so it 's possible to play with people a league higher and be ranked a league lower than them . 
  do n't ask questions it makes sense and is totally fair . 
  he did n't lose game for him ? 
  of course either everyone loves or everyone hates tsm . 
  `` the community '' is basically a one person in thousands of heads . 
  i mean , it 's not like they should get banned or something , i just think they should apologize . 
  pros should hold up to the highest standards and this was just not cool . 
  they actually addressed this in the lastest act riot , stating they look to do some feedback system to understand better `` why did you dodge '' . 
  ( i guess that response like `` i dodged because this player behaved like a dick '' could technically count like reports . ), 
  so whether trolling your teammates is okay or not depends upon if there is money involved ? 
  oh god hallelujah thank you rito i always loved you, 
  well bjerg could have saved the situation if he did n't decide to dive fountain . 
  also enemy team had aphromoo on support , vs some random d1 guy . 
  6 % games can be 1 % playerbase or 50 % playerbase . 
  yeah exactly this . 
  i do n't have problem with soraka not being viable as support , but do have a problem with soraka not being viable anywhere while viable support mages can be played in 2 other roles as well . 
  it 's not fair some champs are pushed to support so hard . 
  if you force them to stay botlane you should also `` protect them '' from being completely pushed out of meta there by a completely different class . 
  it feels like suddenly everyone started playing bruisers or something on botlane , after 3 years of efforts to not make adcs go anywhere but botlane . 
  for me braum was the most boring shit ever . 
  and i mained soraka lol . 
  i followed this pattern : http://www.tarturumies.com/2017/01/09/amigurumi-pattern-pokemon-mimikyu/, 
  at the time it was only available in spanish but thankfully i was able to decode it : ), 
  in case any of you wondered , i am not selling them on regular basis , i can make one as a commision though . 
  i guess it would be around $ 30 . 
  if you are interested hit me a pm . 
  haha same story , i got this skin as well . 
  it was about 8 hours , partially because it was the first time , i misunderstood some of the spanish instructions , and spent a lot of time trying to get the embroidery right . 
  yeah i actually made it two months ago but did n't think about uploading to imgur and posting here until now : ) . 
  here 's my kind giftee 's [ post ] ( https://www.redditgifts.com/gallery/gift/crocheting-secret-santa/ ) on redditgifts < 3, 
  yes , you can find the pattern [ here ] ( http://www.tarturumies.com/2017/01/09/amigurumi-pattern-pokemon-mimikyu/ ) . 
  sure , have fun !, 
  thanks for the link !, 
  we are never safe : (, 
  what should you take instead of ignite ? 
  this is two lines of code that are so wrong on at least two levels . 
  * you should n't use kebab-case and camelcase in the same variable, 
  * never use variables like `` header-color '' ; use a name specific for the color , like `` indigo '' or `` seal '', 
  * i 'm almost sure github color is n't # 000 . 
  you can use it like :, 
  / / colors.sass, 
  / / header.sass, 
  . header, 
  background-color : $ main-header-bg, 
  or you can also ignore the second variable and use the $ indigo on its own ( i use this approach ) . 
  what is the right question here is what is the point of creating a variable that you are not going to use more than one time ? 
  it 's not like you are going to use your `` $ header-bar-bgcolor '' for some other thing than header background . 
  if you do , it will become really weird code , where your `` semantic '' variable name no longer works correctly ; it would be better off being named what it really , actually is : indigo . 
  if you do n't - then why do n't just hardcode it in the first place ? 
  here 's a post that discusses naming colors in sass . 
  i would strongly suggest to read it ( and comments ) if you work with color variables daily . 
  sure buddy , all the code in the world is built of true/false switches . 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ mean ... ^ ^ in ^ ^ a ^ ^ way ^ ^ it ^ ^ is, 
  well taking crabs takes time too . 
  so it shifts focus from gank top/bot lvl3 to `` gank crab '' lvl3 . 
  the difference is people are n't used to their jungler being `` ganked '' at 4-5 minute and are unlikely to help . 
  `` even '' ? 
  automated testing is absolutely necessary in a project like this lol . 
  here 's a blog post about it : https://engineering.riotgames.com/news/automated-testing-league-legends, 
  we tried reddit . 
  what, 
  for me it 's every draven i met . 
  yes i understand that lol , but to not reach level 18 in an hour is crazy . 
  you think at 1/5 he would stop feeding ? 
  itt : people with no experience at programming making assumptions about what is easy or hard to do for programmers . 
  yup , this is literally all that needs to be done . 
  do n't worry , nothing 's wrong with her . 
  i guess it 's just a bad joke . 
  i can tell you : it 's difficult as fuck . 
  do n't thank me , you 're welcome . 
  it 's impossible to solve some programming problems faster by throwing more money and programmers at them . 
  this is basics of software development . 
  it 's like expecting 9 women to collectively give birth to a child in 1 month . 
  edit : yeah downvote me , experts . 
  this is not only my idea . 
  they did a complete rewrite of dota 1 . 
  lol never got a rewrite . 
  it 's obvious that they should do it , somehow , at some point . 
  people going literally `` janna shield me '' / `` soraka heal me '', 
  yeah thanks for advice , i would never think of that, 
  do you realize how many lol games are played every day ? 
  it does n't require some kind of tester that will provide steps to reproduce the bug ? 
  i guess i was doing it wrong . 
  this bug is not affecting the champion in a crippling way ( see : azir bugs ) but affecting other players in a way that makes it impossible to win vs him . 
  it 's completely different situation . 
  for anyone out of the loop , do yourself a favor and just watch this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tri9i3wtxlc, 
  blitzcrank and lee sin for me . 
  well , most people lower its armor and mr to 10 before killing it anyway . 
  i 've parsed the title as `` love power levels '' . 
  three times . 
  this is great , creative and well done . 
  well , unless you are a child or a fucking idiot . 
  am i 14 years old again, 
  yes, 
  * uncomfortable silence *, 
  yeah bro , totally people who edit promotional videos for adult swim youtube are exactly the same people who animate the show ... 
  tfw truth is bullying you,
