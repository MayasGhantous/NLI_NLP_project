  hey , no problem man . 
  thanks for the help though !, 
  yep , i improved it by one , and it still crashed, 
  642 - thank you !, 
  i have a lenovo y480 with intel core i5 , and nvidia geforce gt 650m, 
  i have the steam version-i re installed it , verified the files and backed them up , but it still doesnt work . 
  ill try plugging in headphones . 
  thanks !, 
  didnt work - i tried to run it in both safe mode and not safe mode , crashed both times with headphones in . 
  alright thanks man i will try that, 
  it plays every other game just fine, 
  even when i just improve it by one , it still crashes . 
  thanks !, 
  so i enabled it , still crashed . 
  the campaign starts on good graphics and run them no problem , i can change the graphics without it crashing but the multiplayer still has that problem . 
  i tried joining a game and it crashed a couple times for no reason , i didnt even touch the settings . 
  i uninstalled and reinstalled and the problem still persisted, 
  the ship please !,

  joke : 3 , 1 chinese and 2 white guys are on a motorboat , driving around in the ocean . 
  they go through a fog , and suddenly the chinese guy is gone , as well as the motor to the boat . 
  they get out and push the boat to the shore of an island . 
  they see the chinese guy , and ask him what happened . 
  he goes * `` me chinese , me go fast , me shove motor up my ass !, 
  not really sorry .

  i have some ps3 games though , if you are interested - resistance fall of man , wolfenstein , uncharted 1/2 , and ghost recon aw 2 .

  off topic question-can anyone tell me how i know if a game is on a flash sale during the summer sale ? 
  this is my first one so i have no clue . 
  does it have its own window like the daily deals ? 
  thanks . 
  yea i can . 
  pm me, 
  oh how many times i have seen this, 
  thanks !, 
  yea , sales usually dont go below 75 %, 
  what do the summer getaway cards do ? 
  i got 3 . 
  confirmed !, 
  entered !, 
  entered !, 
  yesterday.all.over.again . 
  i checked the gta page , what does 3rd party drm mean ? 
  i checked the gta page , what does 3rd party drm mean ? 
  so if i just want to play single player offline , 3rd party drm doesnt really affect me ? 
  alright , thanks a lot man !, 
  what do you mean ? 
  because of a bad update or the large spike in players ? 
  its not a flash sale ... 
  should i buy far cry blood dragon ? 
  its 55 % off right now at $ 6.74, 
  far cry 3 is one of my favorite games , gorgeous setting and awesome plot . 
  sometimes i just drive around , not doing any missions just because its so beautiful !, 
  if you mean popular games being on sale all throughout the sale-yes , they most likely will , although the discounts vary ( i.e. 
  gta iv went from 75 % off to 50 % off because it was a community choice ), 
  i saw it under top sellers as well as my wishlist . 
  the only thing i dont like about it is that it makes my eyes hurt for some reason . 
  356 deadpool please !, 
  but ... why is he holding a smartphone, 
  zombie pirates please !, 
  anyone have any recommendations for games on sale ? 
  not seeing anything but would like to get some games while they are on sale . 
  i actually want to buy it to quench my thirst for the dayz standalone, 
  can i have it ? 
  please ? 
  half life 2 please !, 
  have never played half life 1 or 2 , and would love to get the chance !, 
  oh shit didnt realize , thanks bro . 
  i have 1 tf2 key . 
  can you do anything for that ? 
  does anyone actually know how they got the elite into that stance ? 
  so if its like under $ 5 , definite buy ? 
  i would say brotherhood between the 2 , my favorite ac by far . 
  dishonored please !, 
  walking dead please !, 
  i recently started watching the series and would love to play the game !, 
  ... thats what she said, 
  i dont think it will go on sale again since it is still in development , but wait until the last day .
