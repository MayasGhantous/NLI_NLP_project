  can you do the kerbal recruit for a charger ? 
  yea its been at 33 % off hoping it goes to 50 % or something, 
  did he attempt to scam you ? 
  he was about to scam me, 
  he tried to scam me , but then went offline and de-friended me, 
  make me waste money on like 5 cards ( i know its not much money but still ) , luckily i didnt buy it , i waited until he invited me to a trade .

  not really a song , but it is music .

  thanks man , exactly what i was looking for !, 
  yes, 
  the problem is , i cant run games on my computer for some reason , my computer just crashes and restarts for every game no matter what . 
  i explained my problem in the post ... 
  what does sol mean ? 
  but overall , its still the same basic concept right ? 
  delivering supplies to cities right ? 
  thanks man !,

  mcpixel please !, 
  yea , its an indie game where you spawn in a different setting every time and have to come up with a solution to the problem in that setting quickly ( couple seconds ) . 
  it doesnt even have to be logical , just has to work . 
  its $ 1 , but i am completely out of money :(, 
  traded / u/frumpycontusion my bioshock 1 for his hotline miami [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/steamgameswap/comments/1iob00/h_bioshock_1_w_hotline_miami_monaco/ ) . 
  doctor # 7 ? 
  are you talking about ssg cards or game cards ? 
  can you do my chivalry ssg card for your kerbal ssg card ? 
  i sent you a friend request . 
  i am my mom . 
  can you do a ssg skyrim card for gmod spammer card ? 
  mind passing one my way ? 
  kerbal background for my tomb raider background ? 
  yep still in alpha, 
  state of decay ? 
  i heard it was pretty good . 
  7 days to die isnt a finished game-its in alpha . 
  i thought sonic riders was pretty good ... 
  i would have to include either guardian or foundry/sandbox because those 2 were the best forge maps , while guardian was plain and simple one of the best maps . 
  added you i am my mom, 
  yea , but i just realized a problem-armor abilities and sprint . 
  those combined would ruin maps like guardian and lockout/blackout . 
  unless they would disable that , many maps would most likely be broken entirely . 
  yea , imo reach got aa very good , even for their first try . 
  except armor lock . 
  if they kept aa but left out infinite sprint it would have been good . 
  i dont really understand 343 's way of thinking-especially with that whole specialization code fiasco , and making halo more like cod . 
  its pretty sad , imo how they basically inherit one of the best series of video games and rely on one of the worst game series for '' inspiration '' . 
  sorry if this got off topic , i feel it needed to be said .

  hey can you do spartanovka or 62nd army for a tomb raider ss card ? 
  hey i have a ro2 elevator card , interested in your gumrak card, 
  would it just be way cheaper to buy cards on the market then ? 
  same here . 
  i was trying to play reach but it either froze on the main menu of it or i was stuck with it checking for dlc . 
  omerta please !, 
  same thing for me in reach . 
  sorry for the late response , just discovered this subreddit . 
  i have this map in my fileshare . 
  gt - cool shooter658, 
  yea , its the building on the left with some unfinished work on the left side . 
  it does have a connected toilet and bench . 
  got it , thanks !, 
  on pc with punkbuster , no . 
  on console , hackers , hackers everywhere . 
  i remember like a year ago or so i was in a world at war lobby and there were like 2-3 hackers . 
  they made everyone fly with infinite ammo and put a disco ball in the middle of the map . 
  on the other hand , i was in a lobby where it was 1 ( me ) v ~ 3-4 of them . 
  then guess who joins my team to save the day ? 
  an invincible hacker with infinite ammo . 
  thanks !, 
  so there 's nothing wrong with the monitor ? 
  confirmed, 
  just changed it, 
  was shown on raw, 
  concerning my question about christian opening the doors , i dont get it . 
  moving on to the afterlife ? 
  were they already dead in the 2nd universe they created ? 
  ( they did , right ? ), 
  if it had nothing to do with the bomb , what did it have to do with ? 
  and the `` alternate universe '' was kind of like purgatory before moving on to heaven/hell/whatever ? 
  yep, 
  wait but i still do n't get it . 
  ( i do n't know what to call it so i will just call it the alternate universe ) . 
  so the alternate universe , was it there all the time ? 
  does that mean that jack , sawyer , kate , jin , etc were all dead on the island for the whole time ? 
  got it now . 
  thanks !, 
  confirmed !,
