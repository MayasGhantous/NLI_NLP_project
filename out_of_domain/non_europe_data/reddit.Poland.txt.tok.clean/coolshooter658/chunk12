  shit sorry, 
  confirmed, 
  say i build a map in gc , are there bots i can play with ? 
  is there multiplayer as well ? 
  if so , are there community made maps or only dev made maps ? 
  when i was watching this i couldve sworn he was high, 
  is it on steam ? 
  thank god its true , i checked his blog but couldnt find anything about it . 
  yea it went from a comedy to a drama but there are some episodes that make me laugh my ass off . 
  i dont really mind the change too much though , since the story is still pretty good . 
  what do you mean that is 1 full key, 
  how is it bad ? 
  well its not a comedy , its a drama . 
  its not supposed to be funny , its supposed to focus on the story . 
  season 1 was a comedy , then jon changed it . 
  so why did you continue to watch it if it was bad from the beginning ? 
  why is guncraft bad ? 
  yea but i dont want to take the risk of short circuiting it and wasting like $ 200, 
  thanks !, 
  props to you , man .

  ediy : just found [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/a/f6yfd ) mater chief toy, 
  after those last lines and after they [ ] ( #s `` blew themselves up '' ) , i was just speechless , staring at the black screen , and when i heard the fire truck sirens i broke into tears . ^ manlytears . 
  though when chief [ ] ( #s `` got broken into pieces by arby '' ) , i was on the verge of tears when chief started trying to talk , especially when arby was sitting by the door . 
  im in my happy place as blood drips onto him , that was a masterpiece scene ... 
  but guys , jons still making bytes for arby n the chief ... 
  one of them dropped it , other one picked it up , sword respawned , then they both have it . 
  not sure , but i couldve sworn that happened to me before . 
  if not , that was the only thing i could think of . 
  yea , seems to be right . 
  do you know if they are worth anything ?

  were you looking for anything in specific for the consoles i had ? 
  i have some games unlisted . 
  as for ds , unlisted are pokemon games , which i would be hesitant to trade . 
  for wii , i only have guitar hero which is half mine , so i cant really trade it . 
  i thought kane was doing a pretty good job , but bray had a much slower pace than kane , and didnt really show much for his debut . 
  behind that door ... the safe,

  honestly , i hate what creative is doing with christian . 
  they push him for one ppv , then he is back to mid-card , and its like that all the time with him that its just ridiculous at this point . 
  he is great in the ring , and has been with the company for about 15 years , and all he has to show for it are 2 weak whc runs and 4 ic runs . 
  the guy deserves a solid push/run with a championship before he ( probably soon ) retires . 
  honestly , how many times is this going to be posted ? 
  honest question-does reddit hate or like jtg ? 
  i have no clue whether you guys are being sarcastic or serious ... 
  im sorry , but this stance looks ridiculous,

  no thanks , im trying to save my money for a wii u, 
  buy tlou !, 
  i literally bought a ps3 * just * based on the hype tlou was getting , and i dont regret it . 
  [ extremely ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/coolshooter658/comments/1dafo3/h_games_for_gba_pc_wii_psp_360_gc_ds/ ) interested in gta iv, 
  what would you guys recommend ? 
  getting a pre owned wii u for $ 270 or getting a vita for $ 200 ? 
  by the end of the summer i will have around $ 300 to spend . 
  i checked out pre owned vitas , but i dont really trust buying pre owned consoles online , so gamestop is my only choice , and they havent updated their prices ( its $ 210 for a used one ) . 
  plus the thing that sucks is even though you get free games , the memory cards are expensive as hell . 
  sony makes their own custom ones , right ? 
  thats why people complain about the price ? 
  yep . 
  but i am not sure whether i should get it now or wait for the ps4 + vita bundle on christmas . 
  [ interested ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/coolshooter658/comments/1dafo3/h_games_for_gba_pc_wii_psp_360_gc_ds/ ) in platinum, 
  mainly i am into fps ' , action , and the occasion indie/simulator . 
  i * want * to get a vita , but i just feel like i am not going to use it for whatever reason . 
  is ac3 for the vita any different from the console version ? 
  3 games ? 
  3 good fps ' wouldnt really be enough to justify a $ 200 purchase . 
  what about any good indie or simulators ? 
  maybe a good puzzle game ? 
  yea , has the receiver . 
  i will put up pictures in a little . 
  say i do buy from kijiji , how do i know the person isnt just lying ?
