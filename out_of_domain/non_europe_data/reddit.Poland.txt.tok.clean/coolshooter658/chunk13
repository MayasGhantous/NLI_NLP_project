  like he/she says it works fine but when i get it it doesnt work . 
  no , its about the same size as a nintendo ( 1st party ) controller . 
  in the first pic , the silver controller is underneath . 
  oh , that sounds pretty cool, 
  can you send me some pics of platinum ? 
  its weird , when i played i had a gun , but when my brother got on he had a crossbow . 
  no idea how it works . 
  yea , i found it pretty game breaking . 
  it ruins the whole immersion of being a spy . 
  its basically now team death match . 
  in one match i got a triple kill and i was baffled . 
  it was damn near impossible to get a triple kill in double agent/chaos theory because you would have to hide in the darkest corner and the other mercs would have to be stupid enough to not see the bodies on the floor . 
  what games did you get ? 
  is super luigi bros out ? 
  and do you know what this disney infinity game is ? 
  [ see anything ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/coolshooter658/comments/1dafo3/h_games_for_gba_pc_wii_psp_360_gc_ds/ ) for diamond ? 
  i didnt even know there were hosts in blacklist . 
  i thought it was like cod or halo where you go into a lobby and thats it . 
  just figured that out-playing it right now . 
  thanks !,

  far cry 3 is awesome . 
  even after you beat the story its environment is beautiful . 
  for $ 20 i would say its a steal . 
  ( multiplayer is good , but not many people play it for some reason , you can even play community made maps ), 
  what is the point of the y cable ? 
  ah , thanks, 
  cool , thanks .

  yea , but it isnt used much . 
  just sits there on the charging station thing . 
  edit : thanks for the link , but it has nothing to do with the tv , i was playing solely off the gamepad . 
  mine lags up every minute or so . 
  yea , i get the latter as well . 
  really weird . 
  yea , i guess, 
  actually , i do n't really know . 
  zombiu i kind of want . 
  do you have any other wii u games or something small to throw in ? 
  i would lai throw something in as well to sweeten the deal . 
  this . 
  i was at the sprint store a few weeks ago and saw a phone with a controller accessory hooked up to it , so i decided to go check it out . 
  this game is the only one . 
  and i wasted my entire time there just trying to figure out where the damn play button was . 
  not kidding .

  i know this was discussed a few months ago , but can we have a rule where op 's who make threads , list there wants , and never respond to their comments , get banned temporarily ? 
  and eventually , if they continue to do it , perma ban them ? 
  its really annoying and lazy on op 's part . 
  this happens like once a week ( to me ) . 
  why post saying you want _____ or offers or something , just to never respond ? 
  [ interested in gta iv ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/coolshooter658/comments/1dafo3/h_games_for_gba_pc_wii_psp_360_gc_ds/ ), 
  can we have a rule where op 's who make a thread , and list their wants ( i.e. 
  offers ) and dont respond to any comments/offers get temporarily banned from posting ? 
  like first time they do it , they get a warning , next time , one time posting ban , etc ? 
  this happens to me like once or twice a week , and is really annoying , waste of time , and lazy and stupid on op 's part . 
  i am a pro member , so does that mean i will get 40 % more or does the 30 % override the 10 % ? 
  also , how much do you guys tack off if i trade in an xbox 360 wireless controller without the battery pack ? 
  alright thanks . 
  how much do you guys give for a 360 controller in fully working condition ? 
  on the website its sold for like $ 40 , so i am guessing 10-15 ? 
  cool thanks man !, 
  sorry , lol !,

  how do i tag someone ? 
  like you mean report them ? 
  and it doesnt matter if i make a better offer , when i look at the thread , the op responds to nobody , wasting everyones time . 
  [ very interested in gta 4 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/coolshooter658/comments/1dafo3/h_games_for_gba_pc_wii_psp_360_gc_ds/ ), 
  still though , even if it is 2 minutes or 2 seconds , its pretty annoying . 
  as i said in my other comment , what is the point of posting if you are never going to respond ? 
  littering really pisses me off .
