  im interested in pilot wings 3d . 
  would you take offers for wii or ds ? 
  im still torn between where that is sheamus or not . . 
  hey got those pics ? 
  how much fuel is a good amount to get to the mun ? 
  and how long does it take to get there ? 
  i remember once i was actually on my way to the mun and i just quit because it was taking forever , and my rocket kept turning even with sas on . 
  i have a shit ton of problems , one is not knowing the stuff i need for a rocket . 
  i see people talking about all this stuff they use while all i use is fuel tanks , engine and cockpit . 
  and what is an apoapsis ? 
  also , how come when i turn it doesnt always turn , or there is a delay ? 
  thanks , by the way . 
  thanks for the awesome reply . 
  i did what you said . 
  i am not orbiting around around kerbin . 
  now how do i get to mun ? 
  i am using the rocket you told me to use . 
  edit : i did what you said , turned off my engines at 80,000 m , but i crashed back to kerbin . 
  i didnt even orbit around it once . 
  edit 2 : nevermind , i got into orbit , just accidentally skipped one of your paragraphs . 
  anyway , i am now orbiting , now what do i do to get on the mun ? 
  edit 3 : tried to land on mun by making my orbit circle thing bigger , and then landing on the mun , but i crashed on kerbin . 
  ( i only had a little over 1/2 my fuel tank left when i let go of the bigger fuel tanks ), 
  how do you even build stations ? 
  like , how do you carry the materials and then how do you build it ? 
  whats that ? 
  how do you do that ? 
  you send one ship with materials into orbit im guessing , then what ? 
  the kerbals automatically make the station or something ? 
  oh , ok thanks !, 
  n00b here-what is the point of probes and satellites ? 
  how do i select the mun as a target ? 
  does anyone know where i can get the mega bracelet ? 
  i swear this is posted at least once every week . 
  there is a gameswap australia , you would probably get more offers there . 
  youd probably have better luck in / r/gameswapuk or / r/gameswapeurope,
