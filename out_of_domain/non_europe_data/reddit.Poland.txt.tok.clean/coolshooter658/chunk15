  sorry , i could have sworn i edited the/some post to include ps3 games . 
  i have no clue . 
  putting some in now . 
  pc gamers constantly bash consoles for being `` shit '' and `` pc master race '' . 
  yet , a game comes out for consoles only and suddenly they feel we should do something for them . 
  not saying op is claiming master race or anything , just saying based on experience .

  sly collection, 
  sly for vita,

  [ my list ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1mcbq4/usa_h_games_for_pc_wii_3ds_ds_ps3_xbox360_w/ ), 
  try telling that to pc gamers . 
  apparently , their games are * so much better * because mod support , right ? 
  thats basically the only thing pc has better than consoles ( imo ) . 
  plus , many , * many * people on this sub and everywhere take games way too seriously . 
  you post one thing that doesnt fit their idea , downvoted . 
  i know i will get downvoted for bashing pc , but i dont really care . 
  i just want to voice my opinion . 
  sorry , but i have to say no . 
  nintendoland is $ 15 at gamestop . 
  dark moon and ocarina both go for like 2.5 x that . 
  i completely get where you are coming from , and agree to an extent , but still . 
  for years , pc gamers have bashed consoles , you cant even disagree . 
  then suddenly , they want me to not spoil anything , because why ? 
  i imagine this as a brother problem - older brother constantly kicks little brothers as , then older brother wants something from little brother . 
  wtf ? 
  and please dont say that this post struck a nerve or some shit , because i want even a younger brother . 
  this kind of crap just pisses me off . 
  im not necessarily hating on pc gamers , at least from what i am thinking . 
  what i am typing may mean different stuff to different people . 
  i dont know . 
  i play pc as well , though not too much . 
  i dont hate pc gamers , i frankly couldnt give less of a shit what you play on . 
  ill admit , i used to be an xbox fanboy a few years ago , but i realized every console has some game or feature that makes people buy it . 
  like i said before , i dont hate pc gamers , i just hate how they act and behave . 
  obvously , i am not talking about every single pc gamer out there . 
  ive played with awesome people . 
  but on this sub , its kind of ridiculous , to me . 
  whatever you throw at pc gamers , in the end its just `` pc master race lol '' . 
  sorry again , all i saw was nintendoland . 
  i never said i was going to spoil it . 
  i was just saying that i find it really aggravating that many pc gamers constantly bash consoles , and suddenly they want something in return . 
  hmm . 
  yea , i guess your right .

  thanks though .

  hey , you would probably have better luck in / r/gameswapeurope . 
  yea , i checked it out , out of curiosity . 
  every post under 1 month has no comments , and everybody here is basically us/can , so europeans are pretty much screwed . 
  i agree , i dont care who posts here , its just that nobody offers on them , really . 
  whenever i see one for like uk or something , it gets maybe one offer , only for the guy who offered to learn that is was for uk . 
  i didnt mean like 1 gs store selling them , i meant like gs hq or something just tells them to start selling gta v . what would happen , like would rockstar sue them or something ? 
  sorry for the confusion . 
  so why do small shops get away with selling them early ? 
  and thanks for the response !, 
  what state do you work in ? 
  i currently live in ny . 
  also , do you get the full routine ? 
  like do you do anything a 25 year old employee would do ? 
  thanks for the response !, 
  i already am planning to work in dd with mt friend when we turn 16 . 
  thanks !, 
  just trying to earn my own money so i dont have to ask my parents to get me stuff .
