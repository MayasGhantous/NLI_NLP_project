  [ interested in deadpool ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1mcbq4/usa_h_games_for_pc_wii_3ds_ds_ps3_xbox360_w/ ), 
  what else were you looking at besides tomb raider ? 
  and yea , i know , i really want to play it , deadpool reminds me of chief from arby n the chief ( if you ever watched that ), 
  man , i havent played tomb raider in forever . 
  i even remember , for some reason , when my grandparents gave it to me at the airport . 
  anyway , tell me if you find something and hopefully this will work out !, 
  well if you mean like buy something , i have literally no spending money , it all is going to the le pokemon 3ds . 
  i will see if i have any unlisted games when i get home, 
  i just [ took pics ] ( http://imgur.com/1gvxokt ) of all my psp games . 
  all my 360 and ps3 games are listed . 
  that blue case thing on the right is a cleaner - you put the umd in it and it cleans the disc inside the plastic case . 
  and jak and daxter is in polish . 
  [ interested in platinum ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1mcbq4/usa_h_games_for_pc_wii_3ds_ds_ps3_xbox360_w/ ), 
  i just checked ebay-based on lowest prices ( and ones that were cib ) , the average price of all 3 of those games combined is about $ 30 . 
  deadpool at the cheapest is going for [ $ 25 ] ( http://www.ebay.com/itm/deadpool-xbox-360-/271281522729?hash=item3f29a38829 ) . 
  so i would probably be able to do 2 of those games . 
  and jak and daxter is in polish , in case you missed that in my previous message . 
  dont want to give you a game you cant understand . 
  what do you mean ? 
  for my wants section ? 
  thanks for the offer , but no thanks . 
  i had a potential trade going on when i posted this , and me and the other guy are going to trade for his deadpool . 
  thanks anyway though . 
  ok cool , thanks !, 
  lets go to pm and swap pics . 
  no , thanks though, 
  i wouldnt say their tag division is that bad-they have the usos , ptp , real americans , shield , and tons of funk . 
  the storylines are boring and have no real point , but most of the guys there are pretty talented ( except tons of funk-hate those guys ), 
  what do you mean ? 
  it is labeled . 
  hold on , the other trade may not go through because the guy is acting really weird . 
  ill keep you updated . 
  if the trade doesnt go through , i will get back to you . 
  yea , i used the [ ] ( console ) thing , so it doesnt show up on mobile . 
  my first language is polish . 
  my cousin had to tutor me english before pre-k . 
  it depends , like most people said . 
  if i am talking to someone in english , i think in english . 
  if i talk to someone in polish , i think in polish , mostly . 
  at times , i will think in english . 
  but yea , i dont get the 2 languages confused - if anything , i just make hybrid sentences ( ? ), 
  when i talk to my mom/dad /, 
  he ditches me for his douchebag girlfriend all the time . 
  girls who say `` oh thats mad disrespectful '' or `` your mad rude '' . 
  yet they are one of the most disrespectful/rude people you know . 
  i can not stand that for anything . 
  its so hypocritical . 
  i for one , really like the soundtrack and balance between classes . 
  there really isnt a single uber class , which is really something to be proud of . 
  on the other hand - i hate the new updates . 
  they just give so much shit to lvl < 20 's , and its so pointless . 
  they made sos 's stupid as well . 
  i remember a few years back , having an sos was an achievement , and cost you a fortune . 
  now , everybody has one , because they are basically free . 
  jobs are also pointless now . 
  theres no incentive to do anything when your a hunter/thief . 
  back when it was hunter/trader/thief , it was really cool . 
  but then they took traders out for no apparent reason . 
  i only see lvl 100 's + do trades . 
  i am only in the 60 's i think , and i try to do job tasks , but it is nearly impossible to get goods boxes-they drop so rarely . 
  i maybe get 1 per day . 
  agree/disagree ? 
  i would really love to talk about this game i love , 
  i think selling should be allowed , but not like an entire text post dedicated to it . 
  just like , `` also , if you dont want to trade you can buy for _____ '' . 
  i dont think list prices should be mandatory , though . 
  its pretty annoying too , to have 2 flairs on separate subs . 
  or , we can get flair from trading on / r/gamesell . 
  that would be pretty cool . 
  i meant like , if you get a completed trade on gamesell , that trade could count as flair for this sub as well . 
  my bad , worded wrong . 
  never knew that . 
  time to confirm some trades , thanks !,

  the console ? 
  no , sorry . 
  no , sorry . 
  the guy said he has to ask if he can send it since hes going back to campus or something , not sure what that means . 
  he hasnt responded yet , so i have no clue whats going on . 
  ill tell you if it goes through or not . 
  no thanks i bought the bundle when it was out . 
  yea , player tehallmighty is right , during the [ summer ] event , i would sit at my base all day , and would barely go out . 
  but now that [ school ] has restarted , my sleep loading speeds are much faster because i use my stats much more . 
  i have had 2 . 
  both in 9th grade , ms kearon for geometry and mr r for us history ( dont want to give his last name away because hes really cautious about everything ) . 
  i sucked cock at math pretty much all the time , especially algebra . 
  but ms kearon just really made evrything click , and i got a pretty good grade ( imo ) on the geometry regents . 
  mr r got me a 98 on the ush regents . 
  he didnt even really teach us in class . 
  he would make us teach ourselves .
