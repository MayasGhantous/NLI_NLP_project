  not really said , but a while ago this older guy ( at least 50 ) walked up to me when i was waiting for the bus at the stop . 
  i was listening to music , and i just saw his lips moving . 
  i assumed he was talking really low so i couldnt hear him , so i took out my headphones . 
  he wasnt even talking , just lip talking ( ? ) . 
  then he touched my nose and pointed up . 
  i wasnt even the only person at the stop either . 
  i have no clue what the hell that was about . 
  i honestly love this question , i ask so many people this . 
  humans determine the value of life . 
  we think we are so strong and powerful , above everything else . 
  yet , we can be killed by so many animals 10x smaller than us . 
  we call ourselves powerful and strong , yet we need guns to defend ourselves . 
  life is life , and its value is huge . 
  seriously , just because you see an ant walking next to you , do you * really * need to kill it , just because ? 
  i remember when i was like 7 playing in the park , i stepped on an ant and asked my mom if i was going to hell . 
  needless to say , i dont do it anymore . 
  16-my generation . 
  no.sorry .

  it was near that plaza , with key food , popeyes , and a shoe store . 
  i dont really know the street , i think it was in the 90 's or 80 's . 
  i dont live there , i was just passing by it with my friends .

  i cant remember it too much now , but i remember the jist of it . 
  i was on the island from lost , and all the people were there-jack , hurley , etc. . 
  i was basically the jack of the group , and thats all i remember . 
  cool to kind of live in my favorite series . 
  that i watch wrestling . 
  seriously , when i tell someone i watch wrestling , the first thing they say , every time , `` you know its fake , right '' . 
  just because something is fake and scripted means i cant enjoy it ? 
  well , my friend bet me $ 1 that i wouldnt jump off the building at this abadoned baseball field onto the porta potty roof . 
  if i managed to tip over the porta potty , he 'd give me $ 5 . 
  i jumped onto the porta potty , but those roofs are way slipperier than you would think . 
  i jumped , slipped , and fell on my ass . 
  really wish more people saw that , so i couldve gotten more money . 
  never crossing paths with them . 
  your mom, 
  if a slug were to crawl around me, 
  no thank you . 
  anyone willing to sell/know a place where i can get a vita for $ 100 ?

  half life 3, 
  the best computer in the world ( since there is no electricity ) , a gun with 1 bullet in it , and a dildo to go fuck himself . 
  in polish , when you say `` cuda na kiju '' , it means basically that something is very ridiculous , or so ridiculous it has to be made up . 
  in english , it literally translates to miracles on a stick . 
  ok , pm me and we 'll exchange pics .

  i am really good at math just because i dont talk too much ... 
  in reality i suck dick at it . 
  that half life 3 was confirmed because of the copyright put on it a week or so back ... it turned out to be fake . 
  arby n the chief !, 
  not me , but i was there . 
  me , brother , mom , cousins and aunt were eating at this awesome chinese buffet . 
  there was a birthday party going on next to us , whatever . 
  when we go ask for the check , they charge us for the music . 
  what the fuck . 
  so apparently because the party was next to us , and the music was within earshot , we had to pay . 
  we didnt even choose where we sat , let alone informed we had to pay for the music we didnt even want . 
  then , when we went to the front to pay , my aunt gave them the money and basically told them it was bullshit . 
  they ask where the tip is . 
  she says that she left it on the table ( which she did ) . 
  the lady , tells a worker in chinese to go check if the tip really is there . 
  she comes back and says it is . 
  i found this so dooshy that 1 ) we had to pay to listen to fucking music 2 ) they basically demanded a tip , and didnt even take my aunts word for it . 
  chris benoit retired really early, 
  no thank you, 
  hey , me again . 
  if the guy i was talking hasnt been responding to me at all for some reason . 
  if he doesnt reply by thursday/friday , we 'll negotiate , alright ? 
  picking their nose,
