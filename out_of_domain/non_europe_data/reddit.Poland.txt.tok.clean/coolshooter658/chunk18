  i * have * to buy games or consoles to just look at them . 
  not even play them , just to have them . 
  i am really wanting a vita , but i know i wont really play anything . 
  i just need to waste that $ 200 have it . 
  whenever i wake up , i just try and find something to look forward to to motivate me in the morning . 
  the small things matter the most . 
  all polluting objects , besides heaters . 
  can you imagine how much better earth would be , and how cleaner everything would be ? 
  obviously it would be a rocky start , but i think we 'd get through it in a < 5 years . 
  shit , didnt think of that . 
  cant distribute food , either . 
  see anything for platinum and/or sapphire ? 
  when people say `` they had to pull the ____ card '', 
  i tried that a little bit ago , and it said it solved it but it didnt . 
  and what does uac stand for ? 
  this problem doesnt seem like its only me , many people seem to have/had it , too, 
  hey , i have ~ $ 100 and a [ list ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1nr44c/usa_h_games_for_3ds_wii_360_ps3_steam_psp_gba_ds/ ) . 
  what would it take for your vita ? 
  thats the thing though , the store doesnt open either . 
  i tried the troubleshooter . 
  it said it fixed it , but it didnt . 
  what do you mean , my screen resolution ? 
  no , i am not selling consoles . 
  i was hoping that around $ 125 plus a couple games would suffice for it . 
  uac was disabled , so i turned it back on to the recommended setting . 
  restarted my computer and it didnt work . 
  what do you mean ? 
  i can open the windows folder thing and it says , under computer , windows8_os ( c  and under that is lenovo ( d  . 
  i can click on my c : folder and browse around , if thats what you mean . 
  what do you mean ? 
  so would you do like ~ $ 100 plus a game or 2 for the vita ? 
  alright , comment back if the trade goes through or not . 
  so when i do that , will it delete all my files or no ? 
  no , i cant access the store at all . 
  it just shows the green screen with the store icon in the middle , as if it was to start up , but crashed withing 2-3 seconds . 
  thanks for the help !, 
  i deactivated my antivirus , didnt work . 
  ill try to make a new account .

  [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1o94ay/usa_h_games_for_wii_ds_psp_pc_ps3_360_gba_steam_w/ ) is my list of games . 
  weird . 
  i submitted my votes definitely more than 24 hours ago and havent had any luck . 
  you mean the one that asks to verify my email ? 
  world at war is definitely one of the most underrated games of this console gen. 
  it introduced the infamous zombies mode , and the campaign was incredible . 
  online was awesome too , except for the hackers nowadays . 
  where do we find mega stones for pokemon and mega bracelet ? 
  what do you mean gift pokemon ? 
  alright , but how do i get the mega stones for like mewtwo or something ? 
  i found it in that maze where you have to find the guys dog ( forget the name ), 
  that when ww2 started , its often believed that polish troops charged nazi thanks with horses . 
  come on , were behind , but not that far behind . 
  that people borrow money , to the extent that they cant pay it back in 50 life times * cough * us government * cough *, 
  just sitting somewhere , and admiring the stuff around me . 
  not really an inconvenience , but a nuisance . 
  almost everyday , as i walk home from the bus stop , there is a poor guy and his son begging for money near a busy street . 
  the dad seems like a good guy , and i genuinely feel really bad for him . 
  but the kid can go fuck himself . 
  i feel bad saying it but seriously : he sits on the fire hydrant , while his dad walks car to car to ask for money , and hes not even that young - he has to be at least 14 . 
  and , he literraly has `` swaggot '' clothes . 
  he wears a snapback , nice pants and shirt . 
  seriously . 
  you beg for money when you wear better clothes than me , and the father . 
  the first time i saw them , he asked for money , so i gave him some change from my pocket . 
  the next time , i walked past him , there were his exact words `` hey , hey , stop '' literally told me to stop , not even ask . 
  then what really pissed me off - `` give me money '' . 
  he told me to give him money . 
  what . 
  the . 
  then when i walk away , he moans , `` for food '' , trying to get me to feel bad for not giving him money . 
  now when i see him , i always tell him i have no change , cause hes a dick . 
  i would gladly give the father some , though . 
  soccer/footbal noob here : does this mean polands not going to the world cup ?

  what is the story behind michael ? 
  like , why did sony make a commercial about him ? 
  thats the thing-my friends say my laptop is pretty good , and it has a fair graphics card . 
  when my gmod freezes , i ctrl-alt-dlt , and it always says that hl2 stopped responding . 
  know why ? 
  edit : was just playing gmod , and it just crashed . 
  no freeze , just crashed .
