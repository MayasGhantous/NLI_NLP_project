  i dont have add-ons ( as far as i know ) . 
  all i play is ttt and zombie survival, 
  i dont spawn props , i just play ttt or zombie survival . 
  and how do i dedicate more ram to gmod ? 
  do you know ? , i tried youtube/google but couldnt find it . 
  did that . 
  i verified the cache , and my driver was up to date when i checked today . 
  i think i dedicated a lot of ram to minecraft though , when i used to host a server . 
  how do i un-dedicate it ? 
  oh , i thought it was , like , reserved for that . 
  but yea , my friend found some forum and the guy recommended that i should type some code into the startup option , and its been working now . 
  thanks , though !, 
  tried it , still crashed . 
  what has helped me a little was typing in '' - dxlevel 81/71 '' in the startup options . 
  it extended how long i can play , though just crashed right now . 
  i did that , and it re downloaded 2 files , didnt work though, 
  i have l4d2 campaigns/maps i downloaded , thats it, 
  what do you mean dirty ? 
  like viruses ? 
  if so , i have none . 
  and when i typed in some code my friend found on a forum , it lowers the graphics on gmod , and it extended how long i can play , but not where i can play for however long i want . 
  thanks ! , i think i am going to go with space engineers , ill hold off until the winter sale with stanley parable . 
  something that has helped me out a little : nobody ( or close to no one ) is judging you when you do something . 
  if you raise your hand and get a question wrong , nobody gives a shit . 
  no one says `` wow , he got that wrong , hes a dumbass '' .

  cant find it-anyone know where to catch gengar ? 
  i see marvel vs capcom for the vita . 
  sure . 
  i will post them here probably tomorrow afternoon . 
  no thank you . 
  there are 2 things that happen : 1 ) sometimes it jusr crashes . 
  no signal or sign , it just closes 2 ) it freezes , and i hear the same sound over again ( the last one i hear before it freezes ) and when i ctrl + alt + dlt , it says hl2 isnt responding . 
  its weird , because i played zombie survival fine for ~ 3 days , then this just started happening . 
  i would say i can play about 10 minutes before it crashes . 
  1 ) no , i never downloaded anything through the workshop, 
  2 ) not sure , i will check in a few minutes and post back, 
  3 ) takes about 10 minutes, 
  ok thanks . 
  i validated my files , and every time it says i have 1 missing , but never recovers it . 
  i re installed steam completely , and it still crashed . 
  ok i downloaded it from the game mode workshop . 
  i put that code in before , but all it did was extend how long i can play by ~ 10 , 15 minutes . 
  i googled my problem and found that i should put this code ( r_drawmodeldecals 0 + r_drawmodeldecals 0 ) into the set launch options , but still doesnt help .

  hey , since op declined , do you see anything for resistance ? 
  could you throw in wipeout ? 
  based on gamestop prices , sonic is ~ $ 40 new , and resistance is $ 20 new . 
  i think it would be an even trade your 2 vita games for my sonic . 
  how many times are people going to post this ? 
  i swear i see this every other day . 
  yea , i post there but just in case anyone didnt go there but subscribes to this sub , i was looking to trade , you know ? 
  what game were you looking at ? 
  see anything ? 
  hotline is $ 10 , and both of those hats are about $ 2 . 
  can you throw in some stuff to even it out ? 
  shit , i completely forgot about this . 
  its really outdated . 
  if you want to see my full list its [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1ppt4m/usa_h_games_for_gba_pc_360_ps3_wiiu_psp_ds_steam/ ), 
  can you throw in like 1 more hat or something ? 
  ill get back to you . 
  how the hell will bf4 work on the vita ? 
  isnt that too much for the vita to handle ? 
  anything here ? 
  gas, 
  i would say about 8 keys , because its $ 20 . 
  i am willing to negotiate though . 
  thought about it , sorry , but i dont really want those hats you have . 
  no thanks, 
  did not see anything , sorry . 
  undertaker ? 
  where do you see that ? ... 
  what platform is most wanted for ? 
  i think one of the reasons cod failed on the vita was the price point . 
  what was it , like $ 50 ? , while every other game is < $ 40 . 
  i know its only $ 10 more but still . . 
  assassins creed liberation is alright , nothing to brag about though . 
  i think its around 10 mb, 
  oh , sly was in my wants list, 
  thanks a ton !, 
  what game where you looking at ? 
  ps + please !, 
  thanks a ton !, 
  global warming .
