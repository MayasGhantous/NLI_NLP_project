  im probably bias , but that sounds pretty unfair .

  looking at resistance for vita http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1q7nmt/usa_h_games_for_vita_ds_psp_wiiu_pc_gba_steam_ps3/, 
  i wrote resistance for vita ... 
  oh , ps3 . 
  i accidentally wrote vita in the title . 
  whats the plot behind this game ? 
  alright, 
  sorry bro but that sounds really unfair on my part . 
  i would be giving ~ $ 100 for a $ 60 game . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1q7nmt/usa_h_games_for_vita_ds_psp_wiiu_pc_gba_steam_ps3/ interested in walking dead/uncharted for vita . 
  wow didnt realize prices were that low . 
  anyway though , i dont really want to trade off tlou . 
  i would consider include tloz , did you see anything else , like sonic racing transformed ? 
  youve heard right , its an amazing game . 
  thats why i dont want to trade it away . 
  sorry then , but im going to have to decline your offer . 
  one of the most underrated series ever of this generation . 
  the ending in gow 3 was perfect , imo . 
  its a shame judgement wasnt that good .

  who took this picture ? 
  i know this one doesnt have paper planes in it , but is it maybe this?https : / / blogs.halowaypoint.com/post/2012/08/21/nexus-a-halo-3-funtage.aspx#, 
  sorry , no, 
  nope , sorry . 
  how much were you thinking for each ? 
  no sorry . 
  well , if you have the 3g vita , and are trying to remote play using the 3g directly from the vita , then no . 
  but if you are using a hotspot , i think you can . 
  connection will probably be spotty though , because your 3g/4g will constantly be changing ( weak to strong , etc ), 
  why cant i be as cool as master chief ? 
  are you willing to trade the 8gb card for the vita ? 
  if so , here is my list http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1qpzf8/usa_h_games_for_wiiu_360_ps3_3ds_pc_steam_gba_psp/, 
  alright , cool , thanks !, 
  sly/fifa are on my wants side .

  do they email it to you or something ? 
  i registered my vita and nothing happened . 
  wow , come on op . 
  hopefully if they open this up to the us registered hardware will still count . 
  interested in metal gear solid hd for vita, 
  interested in mgs hd for vita, 
  what happened to the list of systems at the top ? 
  like where you just click on , vita for instance , and it would only show you lists that included vita games . 
  really miss that feature . 
  for what system ? 
  cool . 
  thanks for the update !, 
  for vita i have nothing , 3ds i have fire emblem , and wiiu i have luigiu , but i dont really want to trade that off . 
  from what i hear , the 2000 will be $ 200 , but if you want to import it its a bit more expensive . 
  i think part of it is that when people post a pic of a console , it is usually something special , like a bill gates signed xbox ( there were 2 or so posted in the last few days ) . 
  if it is just a plain 360 , people would just downvote it , since there is no meaning to it . 
  pc 's , its kind of like , there are so so many different kinds of pc 's , you will almost never see the same kind twice . 
  but thats the thing , people will just post `` look what i got '' or something like that , every other day , and this will become / pc instead of / gaming . 
  the only time i have seen people post `` look what i got in the mail '' for consoles is when they are released ( like ps4 ) . 
  i think what i am trying to say is , because of the much much bigger variety in pc 's , there needs to be some kind of restriction ( s ) , because then people would just post their computers/graphics cards/etc every day , and just claim that it wasnt posted before , because as i said , there are a ton of pc 's , and the likelihood of finding an exact same one is very hard . 
  some advice : dont get the 3g model , it is not worth it . 
  in poland , you probably will get little/no coverage , and you cant even do anything with it ( play games , stream from ps4 ) . 
  you may want to check amazon , ebay , or empik/media markt,
