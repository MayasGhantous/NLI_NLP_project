  pm me when you think about it . 
  also , the headset is [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/a/fttxq ) , since most people think it is like a turtlebeach or something . 
  if you are still interested , i would throw it in for something small from your list . 
  wow . 
  thanks for all the info !, 
  mainly , i saw marvel v capcom , or nier . 
  lucky , ive had the game for months and i can barely make an orbit, 
  what do you mean setup ? 
  and forgot to reply to your tlou thing , but yea , i wouldnt want to trade it . 
  oh alright . 
  i would still be interested in nier though . 
  ok . pm me or comment back when youre ready . 
  entered . 
  thanks !, 
  against the rules . 
  use / r/gamesell, 
  well , i once jumped off the roof of one of those parks department buildings onto a porta potty for $ 2 , and like $ 5 if i managed to tip it . 
  in the end , i jumped , slipped off the porta potty ( its waaaaay slipperier than you would think ) and fell on my ass . 
  before you call me stupid :, 
  1 ) it was hot as hell , so i basically got some free water, 
  2 ) looking back , it was funny as hell . 
  no sorry . 
  no , sorry . 
  i dont see whats so wtf about this ... props to that guy, 
  theres no list ... 
  what i saw was ghosts , and kind of dungeon hunter alliance . 
  i also read in your comments on your post that you are getting a 3ds next week and need games , and i have fire emblem i would be willing to trade , so we can make this like a 2 for 2 or something , if youre interested . 
  no , sorry , i wouldnt . 
  its just a game i would kick myself for trading later on . 
  id like it because my 360 is on the verge of dying out, 
  is there any way to check if an email is registered with an account ? 
  hmm . 
  alright , cool , thanks to both of you !, 
  it may seem iffy , but its really good , imo . 
  we have similar tastes , i dont like jrpg 's either , and platformers are ok . 
  so are you still interested or ... 
  ok . you too . 
  uncharted is free for ps + members ( which i am ) anyway . 
  oh shit , didnt realize it was there . 
  but what about it makes it crappy ? 
  i watched a review , and the guy said that the story made it kind of bad . 
  is that true ? 
  what else ? 
  if you are going to use ebay , always always make sure it doesnt say for parts or not working , and make sure they accept returns , just in case . 
  and read all the descriptions to make sure you get what you paid for . 
  hey !, 
  mind if i pm you as well ? 
  to kind of build on that injury note : has something like this ever happened to you ? 
  where you just start running and your shin ( feels like the bone ) just starts hurting ? 
  i asked my friend ( we both play soccer ) and he said it sometimes happens to him as well , but neither of us know why . 
  what do you mean comparable to running on the road ? 
  yea , i like to push myself as well , since there are many different variables outside ( weather , wind , etc ) while inside theres nothing . 
  ah , alright thanks !, 
  ok thanks !, 
  the last of us . 
  such a well made story , made you really are for the characters . 
  i nearly cried at the end , even though the last word was just '' ok '', 
  it will be , on the 29th i think . 
  it was on / r/gamedeals, 
  oh , didnt know , thanks !, 
  you know how gs sells pc discs instead of digital ? 
  i heard the physical discs come with a code to redeem so you get a digital one as well . 
  do you know if that is true ? 
  the pirates life is the life for me lololol and a bottle of win, 
  exactly what i am feeling . 
  i especially hate it when people say `` convince me to buy a vita '' . 
  seriously , do people who post that think we really give a fuck whether they buy one or not ? 
  hes not even trying to make some dramatic exit . 
  hes addressing valid points , this sub really is deteriorating because of the same damn posts every day . 
  theres only like 1 good post every other day . 
  dont understand the google thing either . 
  why wouldnt people want it removed ? 
  it sparks no discussion at all , and its so much easier/quicker to just google . 
  anything for bf4 ? 
  but why not a banana * peel * for scale ? 
  is it in-store only , or online as well ? 
  i cant find it on their website . 
  the 8gb vita memory card will be $ 10 . 
  do you know if that is new , or used ? 
  and if new , will the used be cheaper ? 
  its expired , thanks though !, 
  will the 16gb be on sale or the 8gb will be the only one on sale ? 
  ok thank you !, 
  if i go to a store , and they only have 2/3 games i want , can they order it from a different store and i will get it for free ( since its the 3rd one ) ? 
  whats in the ps4 launch party kit ? 
  what i saw was battlefield 4 and mgs hd, 
  sorry , im broke right now , cant throw in any monetary stuff . 
  did you see anything else that would make it even ? 
  ah , then ill have to pass . 
  no , sorry . 
  anything for battle royale or lbp for vita?http : / / www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1rpr3w/usa_h_payday_2_360_sonic_all_stars_racing_wiiu/, 
  yea , thats why i was confused . 
  i havent gotten it yet , maybe the site is backed up, 
  since op declined , do you see anything for it?http : / / www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1rpr3w/usa_h_payday_2_360_sonic_all_stars_racing_wiiu/, 
  does best buy price match even after today , since the gamestop sale is only today ? 
  or once this sale ends , they will no longer price match ? 
  also , can bb price match online , or do i have to actually go to the store ? 
  missed the gs deal , so now i am stuck with my 4gb till who knows when : / . 
  thanks for the reply though !, 
  pulp fiction !,
