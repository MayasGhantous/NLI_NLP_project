  can i please ? 
  see anything for ac4 ? 
  yea , pretty much, 
  man , i wish there were more vita trades going on here . 
  theres only very few people who have vita games up for trade . 
  anything for link between worlds?http : / / www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1rpr3w/usa_h_payday_2_360_sonic_all_stars_racing_wiiu/, 
  anything for ragnarok vita ? 
  would you listen to offers for ragnarok ? 
  its pre owned , and the thing is i bought the game at the mall near my cousins house , which i have no way of getting there anymore . 
  can i still go to another gs and just trade it in , for the difference between the 2 games ? 
  or will i have to pay a little bit more ? 
  it was about a week ago , and yes i did, 
  i bought it pre owned from gamestop , guessing it was used thats why, 
  i highly recommend getting sly cooper . 
  the graphics could have been tightened up a bit , but the game is very good nonetheless . 
  killzone is a must have if you are into fps 's . 
  i have heard good things about tearaway , but have yet to play it . 
  i have resistance , but havent played it yet . 
  to me , it looked good from gameplay videos , though many people say its not too good . 
  but yea , killzone is arguably the best fps on the console right now . 
  dragon ball z battle of z , minecraft ( most likely ), 
  lost . 
  it was the only show to make me cry when a character died . 
  i dont remember much , though i remember him pointing , as if where he was going was far , and that half circle thing . 
  what do those signs mean though , not context wise , but just plain definition ? 
  thanks !, 
  ah , i think he was saying that he lived really far and wouldnt want us to go through the trouble of walking all the way with him ... 
  thanks !, 
  edit : nevermind, 
  oh , that makes sense . 
  thanks !, 
  use a reusable water bottle and just use tap water . 
  its free . 
  why would you pay just to have it in a bottle when you can have all that for free ? 
  no , it was just in front of him , like regular . 
  what i saw : rayman legends , fifa 14 , injustice, 
  no , sorry !, 
  i already have pokemon y , though it is unlisted . 
  i was looking at dbz hd and injustice, 
  no , sorry, 
  what else did you see ? 
  oh , i wouldnt want to trade any of those . 
  probably not , thank you though !, 
  i dont know , i am kind of on the fence on that . 
  what were you looking at ? 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1s9oz2/usa_h_payday_2_360_sonic_all_stars_racing_wiiu/ interesed in link between worlds, 
  sonic all stars for wii u for link between worlds ? 
  did you see anything else ? 
  i would rather have the physical copy , because i dont know if i would like it , and i wouldnt really want to trade fe for it . 
  i am looking at battle royal for vita http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1s9oz2/usa_h_payday_2_360_sonic_all_stars_racing_wiiu/, 
  would you consider doing pokemon x for fire emblem ? 
  i have payday 2 for 360 , interested in ys for vita , as well as link between worlds for 3ds, 
  anyone know of a cheap screen protector that will make scratches on the screen disappear ? 
  i have like 3 scratches and it really makes me cringe when i see them . 
  my screen protector doesnt make it invisible , does anyone know of a cheap one that does ? 
  characters , like super gogeta or something like that, 
  i just started the game , and there is one thing that really bugs me . 
  it is pretty much all dialogue and i find myself pretty much just spamming x the whole time . 
  does it pick up ? 
  anything for albw or 3d world ? 
  why not both ? 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1s9oz2/usa_h_payday_2_360_sonic_all_stars_racing_wiiu/ anything for mgs hd for vita, 
  interested in mgs hd for vita http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1s9oz2/usa_h_payday_2_360_sonic_all_stars_racing_wiiu/, 
  how often do the igc games rotate ? 
  anyone know ? 
  good deals , but holy shit they overcharge for shipping . 
  1 ) not sure , never used it, 
  2 ) no itunes app, 
  3 ) from what i heard , the browser sucks/is really laggy or something, 
  4 ) there are a few pretty good big name games ( little big planet , killzone , resistance , sly , maybe a few more ) . 
  from what you said , it seems like you are into rpg 's . 
  i think there is like 1 or 2 western rpg 's , but most are jrpg 's . 
  personally , i hated japanese games in general ( just the style and gameplay , and stuff ) but games like persona 4 really got me hooked . 
  if you find a good deal ( < $ 170 ) i would say get it , especially if you are getting a ps4 . 
  refresh or something , its still there for me, 
  would you consider trading albw or are you solely selling it ? 
  i wanted to get rayman , $ 5 seemed like a steal , but holy shit $ 8 for that ? 
  i had to pass . 
  [ here is my list , really wanting albw ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1s9oz2/usa_h_payday_2_360_sonic_all_stars_racing_wiiu/ ), 
  3d land is cart only ( forgot to list that ) . 
  would you be interested in fire emblem or just those 2 games ? 
  the controls take a little bit of getting used to , but once you get them down , there is no problem . 
  and it is really populated , i find a game within seconds usually . 
  depends . 
  if you havent played a game on a vita before and are used to xbox then sure . 
  as long as you dont mind spending the extra money . 
  to me , it felt perfectly fine after a game or two . 
  unless you can get it < $ 10 , no,

  hey !, 
  i saw ac4 as well as mgs hd, 
  no thanks . 
  i would rather have the physical copy . 
  sorry but i will have to pass . 
  i have a case , found it the other day but just updated it . 
  would you do it for ac4 ? 
  i was more interested in that . 
  alright , i could do payday 2 for mgs hd . 
  pm me,
