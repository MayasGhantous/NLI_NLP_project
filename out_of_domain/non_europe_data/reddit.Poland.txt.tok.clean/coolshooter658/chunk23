  interested in black ops and/or rayman for vita http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1stqu5/usa_h_payday_2_360_sonic_all_stars_racing_wiiu/, 
  dice said that it was impossible to miss it when triggered or something like that ... this cant be it ... 
  alright , thanks for looking, 
  how much for the vita game case ? 
  also are you open to offers on it or solely paypal ? 
  how much for mgs hd , rayman origins , and nfs ( all for vita ) ? 
  as far as paypal , i was thinking like $ 2 . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gamesale/comments/1sxzkw/usa_h_payday_2_360_sonic_all_stars_racing_wiiu/ ) is my list of games if you are interested . 
  i saw killzone 3 , judgment , l4d2 . 
  yes, 
  i was thinking about $ 30, 
  why ? 
  i heard the campaign story isnt great , but the battles look ok . 
  based on ebay prices , killzone is worth [ ~ $ 10 ] ( http://www.ebay.com/itm/ps3-game-killzone-3-/321270263774?pt=video_games_games&amp;hash=item4acd332fde ) . 
  sonic is worth [ ~ $ 30 ] ( http://www.ebay.com/itm/sonic-all-stars-racing-transformed-game-complete-nintendo-wii-u-/271344103364?pt=video_games_games&amp;hash=item3f2d5e6fc4 ), 
  i once saw the hash slinging slasher ... 
  no , i was thinking 2 out of the 3, 
  i was thinking judgement , and l4d2, 
  alright . 
  thought about it ( sorry for late response ) , i would be willing to do 3d land for albw . 
  wait ... since when are aj and punk going out ? 
  he was being sarcastic ... 
  sorry , but i would really much rather have physical . 
  amazing deal . 
  a vita alone for $ 120 is good, 
  anything for cod vita ? 
  i definitely am , since my laptop isnt too powerful . 
  and my birthday is right at the start of the year , so thats a big plus towards it . 
  caring about the environment, 
  lancang dam , as well as zavod, 
  its cool , but i wish i didnt have to log in to the other computer , i wish i could just activate it from mine . 
  looking at rayman for vita, 
  i have sonic all stars racing transformed . 
  interested ? 
  are you solely looking for pkmn games or are you open to offers ? 
  how much for dk jungle beat, 
  [ here is my list ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gamesale/comments/1sxzkw/usa_h_payday_2_360_sonic_all_stars_racing_wiiu/ ), 
  was that the only thing you saw ? 
  i definetely cant do both . 
  based on ebay prices , four swords is ~ $ 20 , and oot 3d is right at ~ $ 40 . 
  would you be willing to pay the ~ $ 10 difference , or no ? 
  alright , ill pm you tomorrow . 
  im going to sleep in a little bit as well, 
  what would be the price for with and without ? 
  awesome , i could do $ 15 shipped . 
  ill pm you and well work out the details . 
  thought about it ? 
  thank you , for being one of the minuscule amount of people willing to actually sacrifice something for a greater good , the environment . 
  sorry , but there was nothing else i really saw . 
  happy swapping and holidays !, 
  almost all the star wars games, 
  digital or retail ? 
  yea , i could do that . 
  pm me and we will work out the details, 
  since my dad just got surgery , he is n't working right now . 
  as a result , money is tight this year around . 
  it would be really cool to get a present for my brother who is converting to pc . 
  thanks and happy holidays !, 
  no sorry, 
  no sorry, 
  offer, 
  sorry but i only have 1 cent in my account , and those are the only things i have .

  what about 3 keys and a couple tf2 items ?

  i would love the stanley parable !, 
  i played the demo , and holy shit , even though there was no action or anything like that , it was one of the most enjoyable things i ever played, 
  i dont think so , since it just came out . 
  maybe it could get like $ 5 off though . 
  i sent you a trade offer, 
  sent you a trade offer, 
  sorry , but i already traded for it, 
  how many keys for ac ? 
  how many tf2 keys for ac iv,

  add me ( coolshooter658 ), 
  yea i am experiencing the same thing . 
  it got better though , i have to wait a little for it to load , but its better than a few days ago, 
  what file did you use for it ? 
  the older cod 's never go on sale . 
  all they ever get is $ 5 off, 
  no it hasnt , and most likely not .

  add me ( coolshooter658 ), 
  do you have it saved somewhere ? 
  half life 3, 
  its not the game but 2 dlc for it, 
  no , they are worth nothing ( like 2 cents each ),
