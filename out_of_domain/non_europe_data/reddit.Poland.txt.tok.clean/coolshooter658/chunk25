  how much were you thinking ? 
  how much are you thinking ? 
  would you do just the 3ds with pokemon ? 
  thats really steep for a used 3ds , i have seen them go for ~ $ 100 , even in great condition . 
  oh , sorry but i cant do that then, 
  oh , i was thinking at about $ 100, 
  would you be willing to sell x alone ? 
  i lost it at that indian war-cry raid, 
  i have it , though i cant get it to work . 
  when i open it , there are the 3 fan percent things on the bottom half right ? 
  i turn them down , but how do i save that change ? 
  whenever i set it to say , 50 % , i close it , open it again , and it goes back to what it was .

  [ anything for mh3u ?

  how many keys for source ? 
  alright sorry , i just copied the list from my gameswap post . 
  ill fix it right now . 
  no sorry , i just realized that it is from my gameswap list , so they shouldnt be there, 
  sorry , but i wouldnt sell it , since it is pretty much the only thing i play on my ps3 . 
  as stated above , i just realized that it is from my gameswap list , so it shouldnt be there, 
  for both , say , ~ $ 30 ? 
  im completely open to negotiation . 
  no sorry, 
  psasbr is cib , though resistance doesnt have the online code thing ( didnt have it when i bought it ) . 
  and i think $ 30 is a fair price , based on ebay prices ( cheaper than amazon ) the cheapest ones are ~ $ 35 together . 
  would you do like $ 9 to cover some shipping ? 
  alright , no problem !, 
  ive been thinking about that actually . 
  how do you get on a private server ? 
  i googled and asked around but no one knew . 
  thanks !, 
  im downloading this one called good times right now . 
  awesome , pm me, 
  hey again . 
  i did what you said , and for some reason after i click start on that first window when you open silkroad , this never ending window pops up . 
  it says server_dep \\ silkroad \\ textdata \\ then a bunch of random stuff . 
  all i could do is spam ok , and when i do it shows a different thing where i put `` then a bunch of random stuff '' . 
  do you know anything about this ? 
  weird . 
  im trying out another one , if that doesnt work ill try out in-panic . 
  how many people play on that server ? 
  and would you say for the most part , are people friendly/talk-able to ? 
  i did what you told me for in-panic . 
  i put the media file and put in the silkroad folder , that window still pops up . 
  did you drag anything else in there or are there instructions on the site ? 
  maybe i did something wrong,
