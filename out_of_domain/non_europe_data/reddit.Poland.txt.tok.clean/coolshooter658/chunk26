  sorry for all this by the way and thanks for the help !, 
  nevermind , i got it to work !, 
  thank you for the help !, 
  how long ago was this ? 
  wow . 
  funny how one guy can pretty much ruin an entire game . 
  thanks for actually trying to help the community unlike that chernobyl guy, 
  i noticed that whenever i am a jet/heli pilot , whenever someone locks onto me with an aa launcher or something , i almost never hear those beeps to give you time to pop flares . 
  also , when i am a pilot and i am getting shot at with a jet/aa vehicle hmg or something ( not sure what it is called ) i never hear the bullets hitting me , i just see my vehicle health dropping . 
  he won the rumble when bryan deserved it , not being in shape for wwe ( he looked like he ran 20 miles after his short rumble time ) , had a really poor performance against reigns at the rumble , flipped off fans , botches almost everything nowadays , and is just a dick . 
  sorry but i have ruby already, 
  i live in nyc . 
  and ill pay for shipping , if you want . 
  i have some psp stuff [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1xyk3g/usa_h_payday_2_360_uncharted_12_ps3_psasbr_vita/ ), 
  i mean , $ 18 plus shipping is pretty much $ 20 so, 
  alright no worries, 
  im not sure if this is true or not , but i think i read somewhere that he has/had problems with his visa or something like that, 
  i am interested in kirby and crash . 
  is it $ 8 shipped or plus shipping ? 
  awesome . 
  ill pm you, 
  sorry but i have that already, 
  i may be interested in mairo and luigi , i will let you know, 
  i already have pokemon and zelda , and am not a yu gi oh fan . 
  sorry , but none of those games really interest me . 
  sorry , though i am not interested in any of those games . 
  thanks !, 
  hey , i am interested in sapphire . 
  if the trade doesnt go through with the guy that was first , let me know !, 
  hey , did you find it yet ? 
  awesome sale with / u/magikarp _ ranch [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gamesale/comments/1z3z4w/usa_h_pokemon_colosseum_bonus_disc_unopened_n64/cfriyb8 ) . 
  my $ 8 for his crash and kirby for gba . 
  hey !, 
  so i saw that the guy before me passed on the offer . 
  would you still be interested in selling it for $ 20 ? 
  anyone got pics of nikki ? 
  did christian just lose some teeth from that fall ? 
  thats all right . 
  pm me and well sort out the details !, 
  where do you see the gaming industry in 5-10 years ? 
  we know that you think xbox live and psn are trainwrecks and need a lot of improvments . 
  but what do you think of nintendo ? 
  also , what do you think nintendo should do in order to reverse the flopping wiiu sales ? 
  thank you !, 
  how much for wwhd ? 
  without, 
  sorry but i will have to pass, 
  - do you act differently whilst playing online video games ? 
  if so how ? 
  no , i dont think so . 
  when i play , i usually say `` thanks '' and `` youre welcome '' and all that , just like i would in real life . 
  very rarely though , i kind of mini rage . 
  - have you gained anything from the experiences ? 
  yea , actually . 
  you dont need to physically be with someone to be friends with them . 
  tons of people can be friends , yet be thousands of miles apart . 
  you can find a friend anywhere . 
  - have you ever gained anything from random players you have met ? 
  if so what and how has it affected you in real life ? 
  a little . 
  even a little bit of kindness ( even kind of in a joke way ) can really make someones day . 
  - and finally , can i personally interview you over inbox , skype or psn ? 
  you can inbox me on reddit if you want . 
  [ interested in mgs hd for vita as well as the lost dvd 's ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1xyk3g/usa_h_payday_2_360_uncharted_12_ps3_psasbr_vita/ ), 
  yea this is happening to me . 
  especially on china rising maps , my game stutters so bad i can barely play . 
  my fps also drops randomly on random maps . 
  one time my fps went < 10 on oman , now its fine . 
  recently dragon pass and guilin peaks ( not sure how to spell it ) have been bad for me too . 
  what do you have to offer ? 
  thats already in my have list ... 
  awesome trade with / u/nooodlez . 
  i paid $ 20 for his pokemon sapphire . 
  public talks [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gamesale/comments/1zdqn5/usa_h_pokemon_sapphire_zelda_a_link_to_the_past/cfsx1lc ), 
  thanks for the raffle !, 
  hey , this may be a long shot but would you do it for 1 key ? 
  thats all i have and cant get more atm, 
  how much are you looking for individually ? 
  would you be willing to go down for toukiden ? 
  im not interested , sorry, 
  i might be . 
  what price are you thinking ? 
  mind if i get back to you tomorrow ? 
  i want to make sure i want the game before making an offer , then changing my mind . 
  sorry but i have that from ps +, 
  i would like it :d, 
  yea i bought my vita used and put on a protector right away . 
  sadly it doesnt make it look any better . 
  also , i will look into the stuff you said , thank you for the reply !, 
  it seems that you are mainly into japanese games . 
  if you are , then you should have no problem going with the vita . 
  it has tons of japanese/jrpg games . 
  i would say if you can get a 1:1 trade ( 3ds and games for vita with games and memory card ) then go for it !, 
  just make sure you get a memory card , and if i were you , i would check craigslist/ebay for memory cards since they are super expensive . 
  is there a promo code or something that says if a game is discounted ? 
  for example , i was looking at dbz boz .
