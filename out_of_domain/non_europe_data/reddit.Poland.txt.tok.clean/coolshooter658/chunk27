  its $ 55 , but i dont know if that is discounted or not since it doesnt show a slashed price or anything . 
  also , can i just buy any game and it will play on my na vita or is there something i need to look out for . 
  ( never imported a game ), 
  thanks !,

  mainly fps 's i think , as well as some strategy . 
  [ here ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/id/coolshooter658/games/ ) are my games , so you know what i have . 
  all i saw was luigis mansion, 
  sorry but i have an account already, 
  oh sorry , i completely missed your first comment . 
  is there any way you would do it for just the memory card ? 
  how much for rollercoaster tycoon 3 ? 
  alright i could do that . 
  add me on steam , and well trade . 
  such high definition my allergies are acting up, 
  to those who still havent gotten it yet - i would strongly suggest getting it for this price . 
  the campaign ( which is just mini missions basically ) is not that good , and graphics are outdated , but the multiplayer makes it worth the $ 10 . 
  also , its one of the few games with multiplayer , so theres that too . 
  i have both killzone and cod . 
  i never said cod was better than killzone , i was offering my opinion on cod to those that might have been considering it with this deal . 
  jeez, 
  might buy this , but can anyone tell me 1 ) what comes with it when i buy it ? 
  2 ) how hard is it to install ? 
  3 ) how do i know if my cpu is compatible ? 
  or is every cpu compatible ? 
  thank you brethren !, 
  same here . 
  its not showing econo shipping at checkout for some reason , i think thats why . 
  im contacting support about it . 
  ill update when i finish . 
  edit : so on paypal you have to make sure the address line 2 is empty . 
  once you change your address so that line 2 is clear , it will still show that your paying for shipping . 
  thats ok , you still have to go to confirm your order on tigerdirect . 
  click to confirm your order , and then the shipping will be free . 
  isnt that engine stalling ? 
  i always thought that was on purpose, 
  same here . 
  i loved waw to shit . 
  i sometimes still play it to this day . 
  the very most underrated cod , imo . 
  from my experiences , the plane does fall . 
  sometimes the plane wouldnt even turn on and i would just crash . 
  but yea , i see what youre getting at with your other points . 
  if you dont sell this as a bundle , could you please tell me the prices of these games ? 
  katamari, 
  dragons crown, 
  mlb 14, 
  same for me on my pc . 
  it keeps freezing up, 
  i dont think the online works anymore , since gfwl shut down . 
  but i am fine with just having the campaign, 
  after undertaker hit that last ride i knew there was something wrong . 
  it looked like he was barely carrying brock . 
  he didnt lift him up high like he usually does , then drop him . 
  you dont have it there , but that and the tombstone being a bit sloppy really told me something was up . 
  wait , so was there really a walkout after lesnar-taker ? 
  hell no . 
  yesterday at wm there were like 75,000 people . 
  tonight its like 15,000 . 
  such high definition my allergies are acting up, 
  yea, 
  i got kicked by pb as well today , but for some other reason . 
  must be a bad update or something . 
  no , it is cross save but not cross play, 
  sorry , i was being stupid and realized i was putting the radiator in the wrong way when i was in going to sleep . 
  thank you for your time though , 
  i already have an offer for $ 140 . 
  is there any way you can come up ? 
  $ 80 is what a broken vita goes for . 
  as i said before , the scratches on the barcode arent really visible when you game , though i can understand that may take away some value . 
  also , with everything bundled with it , i think $ 80 is an extreme lowball price . 
  alright , im sorry but i cant go that low . 
  thank you for your time though .

  [ you guys are telling me ] ( http://imgur.com/pbhbyf8 ), 
  stores arent stocking the 1000 anymore . 
  it would be stupid to stock the older version when the new one is right around the corner . 
  if you want a new vita , you would have to wait for the slim , unless you want to overpay on amazon or something . 
  they did ? 
  never knew that, 
  i actually didnt even touch the photo besides the black marks to block out the names . 
  weird, 
  theres no actual sale from what i am seeing . 
  just the regular couple games on discount , but nothing big . 
  how much would you be willing to take for dragons crown ? 
  $ 5 each i think, 
  yea , that is what i am doing for now , though i am using one of those big ziplock bags since i have an xl . 
  it feels kind of ridiculous , in a funny way when i pull it out of my bag and have to take it out of a big bag . 
  it covers that back hing part i was talking about ? 
  if so , i can get it from amazon ? 
  do you know if it comes off or is it permanent ? 
  pc capital of the world represent !, 
  how are these people getting 100 + mb/s and near 0 ping . 
  i can get 2 mb/s , on a good day . 
  i hate time warner, 
  wasnt this posted like 2-3 days ago ?
