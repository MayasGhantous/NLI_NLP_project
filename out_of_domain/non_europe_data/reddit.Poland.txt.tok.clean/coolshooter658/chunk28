  i would pm it , but yea i would email , not much of a difference . 
  i just asked amazon support , and they said that they are shipped on a first come first serve basis , though if you selected 1 day shipping you will get it tuesday , 2 day then wednesday , etc. 
  hey !, 
  i am going to have the borderlands 2 code on tuesday . 
  what price were you thinking ? 
  [ this guy was looking for one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gamesale/comments/24jy66/usaw_vita_download_codes_3ds_download_codes_3ds/ ), 
  no problem !, 
  no thanks . 
  i ordered 1 64 gb card recently, 
  personally , i think that that is a little low but i will think about it . 
  yep, 
  confirmed !, 
  when undertaker lost at wm 30 , i was bawling . 
  i was so sad i didnt even go to school the next day . 
  sorry but i got a better for it . 
  no , just that it will be out of stock since this is one of the most anticipated games though yea , it will probably have a limited run , just like the cod bundle , ac bundle etc. 
  i havent seen any , not even at the gamestop near me besides the display boxes, 
  i use that screen protector , as well as [ this ] ( http://www.ebay.com/itm/291096378073?sspagename=strk:mewnx:it&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1439.l2649 ) one for the back . 
  i charged mine from my monitor 's usb port , and a portable battery , so you dont need to use an outlet , and i dont think the cable would matter . 
  most people will tell you that the game is absolute garbage , but i think it is not bad . 
  i got it for $ 10 , so its not like i was losing too much anyway . 
  the graphics are not good , but it * is * one of the three fps 's on the vita , and i think that the multiplayer is actually quite well done ( unlike the campaign ) . 
  i find it easy to just pick up , play a game or two and hop off . 
  i would say it is worth it if you could get it for ~ $ 10 . 
  sorry , but i only played multiplayer , never played with bots . 
  i actually didnt even know there were bots in black ops declassified , so thanks !, 
  pc capital of the world represent !, 
  can you make a dbz wallpaper ? 
  like for example , super sayan goku , or the whole group or something like that ? 
  thanks !, 
  awesome !, 
  thank you !, 
  can someone explain to me how csgo lounge works ? 
  also , what is it ? 
  i think its like a betting site , isnt it for go ? 
  i have also been wondering this : what happens if i bet a skin that is worth say $ 1 , and another guy bets a skin worth $ 100 , and my team wins . 
  are the bets split into groups , so that i can only win a skin that is around my skins value ? 
  thanks !,

  that help ? 
  ok , i did that . 
  for some reason my ssd is split into 2 parts : 349 mb ntfs ( i did what you said to this section ) and 117.04 gb . 
  both have different letters . 
  how do i mix them together ? 
  also , after i did what you said what do i do after ? 
  wait so i should completely uninstall my os from my hdd and reinstall it into my ssd ? 
  or just install it onto my ssd ? 
  ok , then what do i do ? 
  also , what exactly does a partition do ? 
  how do you format at installation ? 
  i googled it but the guy just regularly formatted it . 
  also , i already have the os on both my ssd and hdd . 
  so how do i install the os in order to format the storage devices ? 
  so i have to format my ssd and hdd first , then install windows 8 and select my ssd right ? 
  sorry if i am repeating what you already said , i am not the greatest with this stuff . 
  but do i have to delete windows 8 off of both my ssd and hdd ? 
  because when i was installing it into my ssd ( with w8 already on my hdd ) it didnt ask me where to install . 
  edit : i installed windows 8 , and it didnt ask me what to format or anything like that . 
  it went straight onto my hdd and my files went to the windows.old folder . 
  watch dogs please !, 
  iirc there was an article i once read , and i am pretty sure it was regarding this picture . 
  it was basically that these guys were across from the valve hq , gaben bought them pizza and soda , but then he said they had to go and called the cops . 
  a cop came on one of the scooter things , was told what was going on , but he wanted half life 3 too . 
  ill link the article if i can find it . 
  edit : http://kotaku.com/5831805/what-did-gabe-newell-say-to-the-half-life-3-protesters, 
  sorry , just based it off memory . 
  i read the article after i edited and forgot about it, 
  my most annoying cs go match happened today actually . 
  i was playing solo and ended up on cobblestone . 
  my team , holy crap . 
  the only guy with a mic had to be like 10 . 
  none of them knew the map at all , they would run around by themselves , even with bomb . 
  as you know , its damn near impossible to take b because of the awp spots for ct. 
  so i tell them to stop going b since were just going to get destroyed . 
  nope . 
  i go with them , since its better than going alone . 
  the awp gets 3 of my teammates . 
  its just me and bomb . 
  bomb just runs in and gets shot right away . 
  i have nothing to do but go after it since i was surrounded . 
  so anyway , halftime rolls along and its like 9-6 them . 
  on ct side , it was even worse . 
  people would just switch site without saying a word , not calling anything etc. 
  i had to beg them just to maybe get a response if we should rotate over . 
  i remember 1 round specifically , bomb was down and 3 of us were sitting on it vs their 1 awp . 
  my team just hides in the most open areas possible , get sniped right away , and we lose to the clutch . 
  now by this time i realize that i am carrying my team really hard ( 20 + points ) and their team is getting carried to back breaking levels . 
  so basically its just a competition between me and the other carrier . 
  needless to say we lost the game , and when the ranks came up , oh let me tell you . 
  i was left with only `` wtf '' coming out of my mouth . 
  their carrier was a double ak , while i am only a nova 2 . 
  my entire team is nova 1-2 's except 1 silver . 
  their team has the double ak , a higher silver than ours , and nova 2-3 's . 
  i was pretty pissed off after that match , mainly because of my team , but also at being matched against a double ak ( even though i did better than him by 1 point ) . 
  so yea , thats my story . 
  will halo 3 be remastered or will it pretty much just be a port ?
