  cool thanks !, 
  how much for luigis mansion , zelda oot , and rogue leader ? 
  ( individually ), 
  i know lego city undercover needs a tv . 
  the gamepad is a map iirc and cant be changed, 
  mario strikers . 
  they could have sold so much , especially with the world cup this year there is no better time to release it . 
  i can understand zombiu since the gamepad plays a big role in the game , but i dont get why lego city doesnt work on the gamepad . 
  its a shame , i would have played it so much more . 
  it may get a small pre order discount , like 10 % off or something , but i wouldnt really bet on it . 
  new games tend not to go on sale right away ( except if the pre order is on sale , like sniper elite v3 ), 
  basically , if it is not on sale now i doubt it will be since it is new . 
  yep, 
  yea there is i am pretty sure . 
  i think i got one when i joined though i cant remember . 
  maybe its just that the servers are under heavy load ? 
  the same kind of thing happened last year with the $ 10 spent = card thing . 
  well , red has flood ( i think thats what his name was ) and hes like level 300 . 
  prepare for the carry red team . 
  * too soon *, 
  they cant really fix it , its just because there are so many people on at once because of the sale . 
  nothing they can due besides getting more servers . 
  and no problem !, 
  same here . 
  i am level 20 something , voted 3 times and nothing, 
  nothing really standing out for me so far . 
  i already got it last summer sale when it was only like 33 % off :(, 
  exactly what i said yesterday . 
  its all just black like any other day . 
  i love the wallpapers you got from the last winter/summer sale since they were so nice and fun to look at . 
  it was like you got to keep a piece of the fun . 
  but this time around it just seems so boring . 
  id say within the next few days . 
  towards the end they will drop in price a lot . 
  i played only 1 game so far but in all honesty it looks really fun . 
  graphics arent bad , and it really does feel like a team horde game . 
  at $ 1.50 you cant really go wrong with it imo, 
  ill do a 5 for my 4 , and a 9 for my 7, 
  got it , thanks !, 
  the orange box was on sale yesterday which includes hl2 plus episodes 1/2 and portal . 
  so i would wait for that to go on sale again , if it will, 
  halo spartan assault is a great deal , i think . 
  the whole team-points thing . 
  everyone wants to craft to win to get a chance of getting the 3 games prize . 
  more people want to price goes up, 
  you need to get to lvl 8, 
  really ? 
  i have never seen anyone there !, 
  me and my friend actually went there , and when we got to the island , a police heli started circling us ( for like 3 circles ) and then flew off . 
  we got our asses out of there pretty quick . 
  would be awesome to go back there though . 
  yea , it was 5 but now it is 8, 
  your welcome !, 
  probably not . 
  this will most likely be the cheapest it will be . 
  get it now, 
  try the demo . 
  if you dont like the demo , then do not buy it . 
  i found the game to be fun though . 
  it basically holds your hand and walks you through the game . 
  narration is awesome and funny . 
  the bad thing imo is that there is nothing to really draw you back in . 
  i played through some of it and just never came back to the game . 
  ill do 9 for 4, 
  sent you a friend request, 
  ive gotten like 5 probably . 
  i think i get one like every 1.5 months or so . 
  june 30 `` pay the phone bill * 3 , 1 '', 
  yea , but it just went on sale today . 
  thats the thing , it hasnt been on sale before , and this one has not been announced/daily/flash etc or talked about . 
  thats why i am a little curious . 
  by the last day or so i would guess they would be less than a dime each , since they expire and everyone wants to make some money from them . 
  finally cs go is a daily, 
  i would assume this is the cheapest . 
  wasnt there an infographic like this a while ago where it said poland was the country with most pc gamers ? 
  this is from december 2013 , so maybe its outdated ? 
  im trying to do this , but where do you see how much you paid for each game ? 
  or did you just remember ?
