  exactly . 
  its like her tits separated like the red sea, 
  exactly . 
  hes in a dilemma . 
  if he wins , he has to come back full time , which is doubtful imo . 
  if he loses , then that makes beating the streak basically nothing . 
  about to post it, 
  can you list them all if possible ? 
  ( sorry for late response , i just got home from a trip ), 
  but wouldnt that now work for most of the maps ? 
  like most need a special gametype like fat kid or something , right ? 
  i watched the rest of the vid and it seemed like his arms were pretty flabby when he was shaking them . 
  still looks pretty good though . 
  sort of , depends on what game ( s ), 
  1 ) make sure you are using a ps vita charger , not an android one ( not all work ), 
  2 ) try to open your vita and unplug - plug back in your battery cable . 
  thats what i heard people saying fixed their problems, 
  if its the 1000 model , are you sure that you are putting in the charger correctly ? 
  i have seen people putting it in backwards ( since it fits in too ) and thinking its broken . 
  and no problem !, 
  what would you say for fire red , gba , abd ds ? 
  ( separately ), 
  ive been thinking about it , and i think ill have to pass . 
  fair prices , i just cant do that right now , sorry, 
  all i saw was ac4 , but that isnt enough , sorry, 
  no , didnt see anything , sorry !, 
  i have most of the gc games i want , though there are a few that i dont have , like luigis mansion for example . 
  what do you have to offer ? 
  hmm . 
  im sort of on the fence on the stuff from your list . 
  ill let you know if i dont get anything else . 
  of the ones you listed i have the ones i want . 
  thanks for the offer though !, 
  to be frank , the most i can really spend right now is ~ $ 10 , which i know is a completely absurd price for a pokemon game or something . 
  i had to pay for something i forgot about and have less than i thought . 
  i already have return to dreamland , and to me it doesnt matter much if it is sealed or not . 
  not really anything specific . 
  i am unfamiliar with ps3 , so i am just looking at stuff people have . 
  no , didnt see anything . 
  so far what i see : luigis mansion , pokemon red + pokemon gba games , pokemon x , ds lite , and maybe fire emblem awakening, 
  what i saw : pikmin 2 , soul sacrifice , luigis mansion and mh3 . 
  what i see : gba sp , pokemon sapphire/fr/lg , the pokemon guide , and maybe black 2, 
  hmm . 
  how about the ds lite , luigis mansion , and red ? 
  are you willing to seperate the games ? 
  i was specifically looking at monster hunter . 
  which 2 games are they ? 
  edit : saw your other post , would you do conception 2 for vita for pokemon x ? 
  didnt know that , thanks !, 
  learned something new !, 
  the guide is only worth about $ 4 on [ ebay ] ( http://www.ebay.com/itm/the-official-pokemon-handbook-3-by-joshua-izzo-stephanie-howze-and-tina-/111424614715?pt=us_childrens_books&amp;hash=item19f16cb13b ) . 
  conception is worth [ $ 29 ] ( http://www.ebay.com/itm/conception-2-vita-japan-used-complete-/271565331184?pt=video_games_games&amp;hash=item3f3a8e1af0 ) . 
  would you add maybe a game to that ? 
  ah ok , my bad !, 
  ill think about it and let you know tomorrow , sound good ? 
  alright , thanks !,

  done !, 
  yea same here, 
  yea , i was in the middle of a crazy comeback and everything just went haywire . 
  one of the worst lags ive experienced in a while . 
  brown laminate,
