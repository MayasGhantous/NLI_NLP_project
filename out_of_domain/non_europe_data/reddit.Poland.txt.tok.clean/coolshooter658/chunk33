  i seriously have no clue what they are . 
  who should i bet on ? 
  titan v ibp , c9 v denial and fnatic v vp ? 
  thanks for the response :d i bet on titan , skipped c9 because of the odds , and am contemplating fnatic-vp, 
  vp v fnatic final ? 
  and train is the third , and if vp takes mirage they will more than likely take train as well , since they are so strong on those 2 maps . 
  i am actually really liking rgn . 
  it really seems like you guys care about the teams in your tournaments ( partnering with csgl to get them noticed ) and i really hope you guys and more people put on these kind of tournaments to get teams noticed . 
  the only thing i find a little weird is that csgl says that it starts at , say 8 but in reality it starts at 8:15 or something . 
  is that just the players getting in late or csgl puts the wrong time ? 
  other than that , i seriously am enjoying rgn . 
  thanks for doing it !, 
  something that happens to me : whenever i buy a skin ( just for betting ) or i just win it , i usually wait a day or 2 for the `` curse '' of it to wear off . 
  for some reason , if the skin is relatively new in my inventory/returns , i lose it right away ( e.g yesterday i lost a nova st bloomstick , that i won the other day , on 3dmax ) . 
  maybe its just the mentality of `` i got ta get this in ! '', 
  and put it on a team without really thinking it through . 
  maybe try waiting a few days ? 
  it works for me . 
  ( sorry for long comment ), 
  cancelled ? 
  how is it lounges fault ? 
  i agree esc deserved the win , but navi won , unless esl were to say something about it why would csgl do something about it ? 
  its not rigged dude . 
  rigged means pre determined . 
  how would anyone know that esc would get ddos 'd and lose ? 
  thanks !, 
  its weird , i do not think this is happening to me . 
  it feels the same . 
  awp , deag , whatever . 
  in fact , i have been doing a little bitter with both weapons . 
  aimface won mirage 16-14, 
  no problem, 
  [ article about it ] ( http://kotaku.com/5831805/what-did-gabe-newell-say-to-the-half-life-3-protesters ), 
  [ funny interview with gaben about it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqatpdibxly ), 
  i have no clue , i checked comments from similar videos and nobody knew/said . 
  and i dont know . 
  i assume that mod broke my game , since it worked before the mod but not after . 
  i * thought * i deleted it ( followed the instructions on the site , not through nmm ) . 
  when i use tes5edit , it all works fine . 
  so a new save loads , but doesnt `` work '' . 
  the first time i tested the new save , it loaded , first cutscene came up , but was really glitchy . 
  screen was flashing black , rainbow triangles showing up , etc. 
  there was also an error at the top left corner that i didnt manage to catch . 
  the second time i tried a new save it loaded , first cutscene happened and my whole pc froze . 
  cpu usage spiked up and had to restart my computer . 
  with regular ` continue game ' , same thing happens as before ( doesnt even load ), 
  and sadly , i do not remember the specific mod , just that it was from enbdev.com, 
  one of them fixed themselves , but my ak safari mesh mw is just not fixing . 
  cleared the cache from the past week too , nothing, 
  [ here is the screenshot of my folder ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nvrqrh9.png ), 
  all drivers are up to date , no setting changed . 
  other games ( like cs go , wow ) work fine . 
  i checked the uninstall process on enbdev.com and it said to delete those 3 . 
  i deleted them , though i guess from the wrong location somehow . 
  it works now , thanks a lot !, 
  alright , thanks dude, 
  skdc, 
  you got ta post proof man , or else its just assumed your odd swaying . 
  nah , i was talking to forever_sorry , but still cool to see your bet :d, 
  the ibp game is a bo5 . 
  no way itll finish in time for ms v torqued . 
  2 weeks ago i think, 
  [ yep ] ( http://www.hltv.org/match/2293612-torqued-mousespaz-hitbox-csgo-championship-by-e-fragnet ), 
  though what / u/220racer forgot to mention was that they faced off like a day later i think and it was fairly closer [ link ] ( http://www.hltv.org/match/2293618-torqued-mousespaz-hitbox-csgo-championship-by-e-fragnet ), 
  i think it would be cool , but where would you post your predictions/analysis ? 
  facebook/twitter ? 
  thanks , just joined !, 
  same exact thing is happening to me . 
  let me know if you come across a solution please ? 
  thanks, 
  damn , lucky . 
  for me , absolutely nothing is working, 
  your inventory is set to private , cant send you an offer, 
  i think hes talking about the origin arby n the chief , when it was made by jon, 
  i never heard anything about that . 
  what is going on ? 
  really ? 
  where ? 
  i guess i missed it, 
  edit : nevermind , i just found it, 
  yesterday in a51 v adaptation , area 51 lost [ in overtime on overpass ] ( http://www.hltv.org/match/2293828-area-51-adaptation-cevo-professional-season-6 ) . 
  despite summit being voted man of the match , he wasnt playing `` great '' , though decent from what i saw . 
  ( i say this because i feel like people will bet directly off of summit playing/fanboyism ), 
  so im in the resource monitor , where do i go to see ? 
  im on windows 8.1 , by the way, 
  how would i update my bios ? 
  sorry , i dont understand what that means , can you explain ? 
  so it * does * actually have 4 cores ? 
  yea , but that was just 1 round . 
  this was like 4 , every round . 
  plus , torqued called for a pause * after * , when they could have asked for a ` not live ' ( i think , i have seen other teams do it ) . 
  also , im not even sure if they asked for a redo on that d2 round . 
  i wouldnt really say vp , its pretty rare to see them ddos 'd . 
  that nuke game was the first time in a while they got ddos 'd , iirc, 
  yea , it does show a cpu0-cpu3 , all good then ? 
  yea , according to [ cpu z ] ( http://imgur.com/37weoff ) i have 4 cores and 4 threads . 
  how can i update my bios ? 
  thanks !, 
  i would assume different parts , based on their steam profiles ( where it says where they are from ) . 
  also , i think i saw a pic before that said pasha and someone else were picking up byali to go to a lan , so i would assume some distance apart,
