  i went to start it again , and it wont work . 
  it either says runtime error or it says to delete killingfloor.ini . 
  i looked through my killing floor file and i do n't have killingfloor.ini and i validated all the files . 
  i uninstalled it and re-installed it , too .

  his micro looked really bad , and a user sent me a pm saying how he will give me the worst micro he has , and after i saw his pics , i knew it . 
  he turned off the lights just so he could switch his micro for a better one , since the other one had a very scratched screen .
