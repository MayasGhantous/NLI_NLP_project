  i am getting a new phone in the beginning of june , and i cant decide between the iphone 5 or galaxy s4 . 
  both look great , and i like the iphone 's simplicity , but i want to customize my phone as well . 
  can anyone help me out ? 
  also , as a side note , does anyone know if there is a gameboy advance emulator for iphone 's ? 
  i googled it but couldnt find anything . 
  i am not going to jailbreak my iphone by the way . 
  i did that to my ipod and it was complete bullshit , in my opinion . 
  im am going to go pre-order either x or y , but i cant really decide . 
  which did you guys pre-order ?
