  i am willing to pay 3-4 keys for it . 
  hey guys so i just logged back into my account for the first time in a couple months ( christmas-ish time i think ) . 
  i now only have 2m gold , whereas i am pretty sure i had at least 1b , or 500m . 
  i also lost all of my premium silk , i got a $ 20 card for christmas , redeemed it and i am 99 % sure i did not buy anything with it , but i have none of it left , but i still have my 4 regular silk . 
  does anybody know why ? 
  did i get hacked or something , or does karma koin silk expire or something ? 
  please help ? 
  thanks !,
