  anything [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1c9mxa/usa_h_games_for_ds_gc_xboxpsp_wii_list_inside_w/ ) for crystal ? 
  because it brought something completely new to games , like forge and custom games . 
  i grew up with halo 3 , and i loved the hell out of it . 
  the eater eggs were awesome , too . 
  whenever i play the ending of the campaign , i feel like shitting myself out of how epic the entire campaign was . 
  anything [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1c9mxa/usa_h_games_for_ds_gc_xboxpsp_wii_list_inside_w/ ) for pokemon blue or gold ? 
  anything [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1c9mxa/usa_h_games_for_ds_gc_xboxpsp_wii_list_inside_w/ ) for pokemon blue ?

  oh , then no thank you . 
  i would rather have a game that i can play . 
  anything [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1c9mxa/usa_h_games_for_ds_gc_xboxpsp_wii_list_inside_w/ ) for pokemon red or one of the gamenoy colors ? 
  anything [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1c9mxa/usa_h_games_for_ds_gc_xboxpsp_wii_list_inside_w/ ) for crystal or a gameboy color ?

  anything [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1c9mxa/usa_h_games_for_ds_gc_xboxpsp_wii_list_inside_w/ ) for the gameboy advance/color ? 
  it looks like its in great condition , but $ 40 ?
