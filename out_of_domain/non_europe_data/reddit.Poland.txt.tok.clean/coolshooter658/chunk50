  hey guys so i just started playing tekkit again and am hosting a server . 
  i have dedicated 6 gb out of my 8 gb of ram to tekkit and increased the permgen size , but still for some reason , when i play on it , with no one else on , i lag fairly bad . 
  my internet bars usually range from 3/5 to 4/5 , sometimes 5/5 . 
  can anyone help ? 
  thanks a ton !, 
  whenever i start up call of duty 4 , it starts on the worst graphics , so i go and change them to the best , and then it just closes . 
  when i open it again , it asks to run it in safe mode since it did not close properly last time , and it is still on the worst graphics , and when i try again to change it , it closes yet again . 
  help ?

  playstation store prepaid code ( $ 20 ), 
  ** i also have star wars battlefront 1 for ps2 in very good condition with case and manual , looking to trade it for an xbox version **, 
  i would be willing to trade one , unless someone can throw in another game since bioshock individually is $ 20 and starforge is $ 13 right now . 
  ever since i bought arma 3 ( back in alpha stage ) the mouse has been so uncalibrated . 
  i have to go a good 3 inches below the thing i want to click just to click it . 
  help ? 
  i looked around here and / r/steam , and googled it but couldnt find anything . 
  i have 3 , what do i do with them besides sell them ? 
  thanks !, 
  it has a black screen where it should show where the game picked should be . 
  i was really hyped for 75 % off gta iv, 
  edit : found it on the game page , but it has 3rd party drm for windows live , securom , and rockstar social club . 
  what does this mean ? 
  its 55 % off at $ 6.74 . 
  do you think it will go lower or should i buy it now ? 
  i know saints row isnt even released yet but i was wondering if you guys think those 2 games will be on sale ( if steam even puts pre release games on sale ), 
  mcpixel is only $ 1 but i dont really know if its too good . 
  and hotline miami i heard its alright , should i get it for $ 5 ? 
  none of the daily deals/flash sales/community choices really seem good to me , or i have them already . 
  any games you would recommend to get ( preferably under $ 5 ) . 
  thanks all !,
