  during the summer sale , i was generously gifted mcpixel from someone on this sub , and so i decided to give it back to the community !, 
  rules are simple , pick my favorite wrestler . 
  also , pick a number between 1-200 for tie breakers ^ winkwink, 
  winner will be chosen at around 1 pm est on 8/17, 
  edit 1 : so far nobody has got him so i will give you guys a hint : he was at both wrestlemania 28 and 29, 
  edit 2 : nobody has gotten him-chris jericho !, 
  so i will choose my second favorite wrestler - cm punk !,
