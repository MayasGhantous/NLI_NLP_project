  the ps vita just got a price drop to $ 200 , which seems like a pretty fair deal to me . 
  but are there any good games to play on it ? 
  i know there is ac 3 and walking dead , any other good ones ? 
  i have been wanting a wii u for a while , though and have been saving up my money . 
  i am really wanting to play luigi bros , the new super smash bros , mario kart , and the other nintendo games . 
  the wii u i want is $ 270 pre-owned at gamestop . 
  by the end of the summer i will have about $ 300 - $ 350 to spend . 
  so which should i buy ? 
  thanks all !, 
  i have been saving up for a wii u up to now and have exactly $ 200 . 
  should i get the vita ? 
  what good games are there on it ? 
  ( as of right now ) i know there is ac 3 and black ops , are those any good ? 
  and why is it like cod black ops declassified ? 
  does that mean its smaller or something?basically , my question is should i get a vita now or wait about 2 weeks to get a wii u , and if i should get a vita , what games/features would justify my purchase ? 
  personally , i think they could improve it a lot . 
  the fact that spies have guns baffles me entirely , and there are not as many places only spies can go to like in double agent . 
  spies also have infinite lives , which imo is really stupid , and ruins the feel of playing the cat and mouse game . 
  the 10 minute rounds seem to drag on . 
  and why do mercs have a primary gun and a pistol ? 
  why not just give them a primary with limited ammo and they have to go back to their base to restock ? 
  i also dont like the fact that mercs dont have flashlights and have to rely solely off the maps lights . 
  dont get me wrong , i have been a long time splinter cell fan , but ubisoft really missed their opportunity with the returning svm mode . 
  thoughts ? 
  no * means you can get it for a fair trade , *** means its very difficult to get . 
  id still love to hear your offers !,
