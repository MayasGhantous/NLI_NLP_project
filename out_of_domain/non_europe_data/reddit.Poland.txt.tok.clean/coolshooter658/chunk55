  external hard drive for the wii u ( would prefer around 25gb ), 
  i bought a used wii u on ebay and the users mii 's are still on the system . 
  since his mii 's were still on there , how do i check if he has left any downloaded games on the system ? 
  i checked google , couldnt find anything . 
  also , is there like a cloud storage where i can store games i bought from the e shop ? 
  the reason i ask is that i bought the 8 gb version and need some extra space . 
  thanks !, 
  i recently bought the 8 gb wii u on ebay , but found myself needing more space . 
  does anyone know where i can get an external hard drive 25 gb-50 gb at the cheapest price ? 
  thanks all !, 
  i recently got a wii u and was wanting to get some games ( game and wario , lego city undercover , zombiu , super mario bros u , nintendoland ) but was wondering if i should wait a little if there will be a sale for labor day . 
  will there ? 
  i played sonic all stars racing transformed the day i got my wii u ( used ) and it worked fine playing on the gamepad . 
  today and yesterday i played super luigi u on the gamepad and got terrible lag . 
  i sat literally right in front of my wii u and still got lag . 
  i had to sit perfectly still to get minimal lag , but if i move 1 cm from where i was , terrible lag . 
  i played the first mission of luigi u like 6 times just because i kept dying because of lag . 
  anyone else have this problem with super luigi u ? 
  any suggestions to improve the connection ? 
  ( i have a home phone , wii , ps3 , 360 , and pc in the same room , but wii and ps3 are never on , and pc is connected via ethernet ), 
  i am considering selling some games to gamestop , how much should i expect from their gamestop.com prices ? 
  thanks all !, 
  i was at gamestop yesterday , and there was a mother and a little kid at the register next to me . 
  the mom was telling the cashier how she didnt want her son ( probably 6-7 , maybe 8 years old ) playing violent games , like her 15 yr old daughter ( personally , i think 15/16 is a reasonable age for kids to play cod , halo , battlefield , etc ) . 
  the mom continued saying how she wanted a game that was more mature ( im guessing more mature than e or e 10 + ) but not too mature ( so like t i guess ) . 
  i just think , everyone is saying how bad parenting leads to 5 year olds playing gta , cod , etc , but how about a thank you/props to those parents who actually control what their kids play ? 
  ( putting up with a little kid crying because he cant play the new call of duty must be annoying as shit ),
