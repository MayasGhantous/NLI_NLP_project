  mine was when i was in like 1st/2nd grade , and i was pushing my friend for some reason , and this kid in like 6th or 7th grade came up to him and was like , you want me to beat him up or something along those lines , and he did . 
  all i really remember was me and him surrounded by kids at the park and me holding on to his leg . 
  of course , i got my ass handed . 
  i guess i was the douche in this situation , but that older kid was messed up . 
  another time , he put a stick in a 4 year old girls ear , and everyone at the park started yelling at him and they followed him home ( i didnt ) . 
  your first fight ? 
  what the hell was that about ? 
  i can barely get out of atmosphere .
