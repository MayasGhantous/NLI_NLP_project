  seems that many people already have gta v , most from small stores or they work in target/best buy/gamestop etc. 
  so what is stopping gamestop from selling gta v early ? 
  if small stores can do it , why cant gamestop ? 
  i am 15 , turning 16 in 4 months . 
  does anyone know of any stores that would hire me in howard beach or rockaway park ? 
  thanks, 
  so i applied to a job at the rockaway water alliance , didnt get it for some reason . 
  so i am looking for another job , preferably in like waldbaums or something in howard beach or rockaway park ( where i got to school ) . 
  i am 15 turning 16 in january . 
  as a side note , does anyone know what age gamestop hires ? 
  i hear different stuff all the time . 
  thanks !, 
  so i applied for a job , but i got turned down for some reason . 
  i am now looking for another job , and working at gamestop would be great for me , i think . 
  i am 15 though , turning 16 in january .
