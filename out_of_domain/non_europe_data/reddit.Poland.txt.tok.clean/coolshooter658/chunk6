  oh , missed it lol . 
  i dont really want it then , sorry !, 
  nothing ? 
  what about codes ( i.e xbox live , ms points , etc ) plus a game for xbox 360 or something ? 
  i can go to gamestop on tuesday probably and i will probably be able to get what you want , if i dont have it already . 
  thanks !, 
  shenmue for what console ? 
  and any kind of code ? 
  like some redeemable farmville stuff or anything on those scratch off cards ? 
  i would really want crystal or the gameboy micro . 
  i have [ these ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1c9mxa/usa_h_games_for_ds_gc_xboxpsp_wii_list_inside_w/ ) and i can go to gamestop and get you some points or something from there . 
  i will even throw in fire emblem path of radiance for the bundle . 
  ( can the 2 be a bundle ) ? 
  also , what games for ps2 would you want ? 
  i can probably get them . 
  well , i didnt mean farmville specifically , just an example . 
  i will try to get shenmue . 
  would shenmue do for crystal ? 
  well , i would need pics first to see the condition and everything . 
  but the micro is worth more than the crystal , obviously . 
  i would say fire emblem + something from gamestop ( if you want ) and for crystal 1 or 2 ps2 games , depending on their price and an accessory or something for ps2 . 
  i would say path of radiance makes up the bulk of the micro , since it is worth a lot . 
  if you just go on ebay , they go for about $ 75 + , and i have gotten many offers for path of radiance but i wanted to save it for a micro because i really want it . 
  but as i said , it depends on condition . 
  the screen is seems very scratched up . 
  can i see the screen when it is playing something please ? 
  alright , ill try to get it . 
  and i understand if you want to keep it , no problem . 
  would clock tower 3 and silent hill 3 make a deal ? 
  and can you put up some pics of crystal please ? 
  sorry man , doesnt look like a good enough deal for me . 
  your micro is in pretty bad condition and radiance is very expensive . 
  alright . 
  alright , crystal itself then ? 
  sorry , looks like i cant get it .

  construction workers working near the former auschwitz concentration camp found a bottle encased in a cement wall they were tearing down which now houses a vocational school . 
  `` in 1944 there were camp prisoners constructing a bomb shelter for the soldiers and they must have placed the bottle in the wall as they were pouring concrete , '' said memorial spokesperson , jarek mensfelt , to the local . 
  the letter which appears to have been scribbled on a piece of cement bag was signed by 7 auschwitz prisoners , among them 6 poles and 1 frenchman aged 18 to 20-years-old , the letter also included their camp identification numbers . 
  based on the names and identification numbers , auschwitz-birkenau historians were able to determine that 2 of the polish men had survived the holocaust , but their whereabouts were unknown . 
  according to mensfelt , finding concentration camp survivors can prove difficult so the auschwitz-birkenau memorial and museum sent out a personal appeal for anyone who may know these prisoners to contact them . 
  later in 2009 mensfelt spoke with the granddaughter of the french prisoner , albert veissid , who just celebrated his 85th birthday in marseilles , france . 
  veissid told french news agency that he does n't remember the bottle , `` yet it 's absolutely my name on the message and my registration number : 12063 . 
  i ca n't forget that number because it 's on my arm . '', 
  the letter was scheduled for delivery to the auschwitz-birkenau museum on may 6 , 2009 .
