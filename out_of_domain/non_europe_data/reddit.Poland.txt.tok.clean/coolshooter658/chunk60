  ** want **, 
  i would prefer a white vita , but black is ok too . 
  it has to come with the charger , and must work perfectly . 
  please , if you are going to offer , please dont make me dish out a ridiculous amount . 
  i have seen people wanting $ 190 for a vita , when i can go to gamestop and get a brand new one and not pay shipping for only $ 10 more . 
  this has always confused me about american culture . 
  many people set up decorations so early . 
  where i live , people already put up halloween decorations like 2 weeks ago . 
  stores are probably putting out christmas decorations about now . 
  why ? 
  in my culture ( polish ) , we always put up decorations a few days before the holiday . 
  i live in nyc , if that helps . 
  hey !, 
  i would really like a vita , with a game or two . 
  preferably i would like a white vita , but black is ok too . 
  it has to come with a 4gb or 8gb card , please no 32gb cards , because i dont need them . 
  must be fully functional , and not have any major scratches or noticeable wear and tear marks . 
  thanks !, 
  heres my list :,
