  i just got my laptop back from repair , because my screen broke . 
  my laptop was covered in like this protective film , but there is also this film on the border of the screen . 
  i literally cant take it off for my life . 
  anyone know how to ? , its driving me crazy !, 
  i just got my laptop back from repair after the screen broke completely . 
  i am 99 % sure all the apps on the metro screen worked , but now many of them dont work . 
  for example , if i click on the store , it shows the me the booting up page for it , but then it just goes back to the metro screen . 
  and when i click on music or photos , nothing happens . 
  but if i click on internet explorer , it works for whatever reason . 
  any help ? 
  thank you !, 
  edit : just figured out that none of the apps work besides internet explorer and the desktop icon thing . 
  i just got my laptop back today from repair , because the screen was completely busted . 
  when i sent it , the apps worked fine . 
  now , they do not start up at all . 
  for example , when i click on the store app , it just shows the green screen with the store icon , then it goes back to the metro screen . 
  other apps , like the music or photos app , dont do anything . 
  i just click on it and nothing , the only thing that works on the metro screen is the desktop icon and internet explorer . 
  i have a lenovo y480 that came with windows 8 , and it is completely updated . 
  i checked many forums but none helped .

  ** ps vita **, 
  console - ** i realize that games might not suffice to get a vita , so i can throw in ~ $ 100 , plus a few games for a vita console . 
  it must work 100 % , come with charger , memory card , and preferably a game , but not really a necessity . 
  i transferred my save files over from my old computer to this one yesterday . 
  yesterday , i tested to see if it had went went over , and it did . 
  for some reason , when i got to playing today , there was no account .
