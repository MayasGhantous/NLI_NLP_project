  i transferred my save files over from my old computer to this one yesterday .

  i made two different account , and for some reason , every time i go to get my free game ( mafia ii ) , it always says something went wrong . 
  am i doing something wrong ? 
  i know some people got it , so i am confused as to why its not working for me . 
  ( i chose the steam key , not 360/ps3 . 
  dont really know where else to post this ), 
  i got my le pokemon xy 3ds xl when it came out , and only started using it when pokemon came out . 
  for some reason , when i charge it 100 % , i can only get about 2/2 .5 hours out of it . 
  i dont use the 3d effect , either . 
  i read online that the 3ds xl should get at least 3.5 hours on a full charge . 
  anyone else having a similar problem or have a solution ? 
  hey !, 
  i would really like a vita , with a game or two . 
  preferably i would like a white vita , but black is ok too . 
  it has to come with a 4gb or 8gb card , please no 32gb cards , because i dont need them . 
  must be fully functional , and not have any major scratches or noticeable wear and tear marks . 
  thanks !,
