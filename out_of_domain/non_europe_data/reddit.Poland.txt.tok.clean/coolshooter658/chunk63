  i have seen a ton of people do this , but how ? 
  i tried to , and i cant figure it out . 
  thanks !, 
  i got my laptop back in january , and for some reason , since a few days ago , gmod just randomly keeps crashing . 
  sometimes i can last the entire time without crashing , sometimes it crashes within 10 minutes . 
  anyone else have a similar problem/solution ? 
  thanks !, 
  i used to be able to play gmod , no problem . 
  now , since a few days ago , my gmod randomly crashes within 5 minutes of playing . 
  sometimes , it freezes , and i ctrl-alt-dlt , and it says hl2 stopped responding , so gmod wont work at all . 
  other times ( and most frequent recently ) it just crashes . 
  no signs , no freeze . 
  i verified the intergrity of the game , and it said that 2 files were missing , and it downloaded them . 
  still crashes . 
  my friends say my laptop should be able to run it ( i have an intel core i5 processor and nvidia geforce gt 650m graphics card ) . 
  anyone know anything about this ? 
  thanks !, 
  when i play gmod , it becomes laggy and i cant do anytihng . 
  i ctrl-alt-dlt it , and it says hl2 has stopped responding . 
  no solution in a google search has helped , anyone know what to do ? 
  thanks !, 
  i am really considering buying this game , but am torn between this and stanley parable . 
  what is this game about ? 
  i know you build space stations and stuff , but what is the point ? 
  is it like minecraft , where you just build stuff ? 
  and would you say it is worth the $ 15 ?
