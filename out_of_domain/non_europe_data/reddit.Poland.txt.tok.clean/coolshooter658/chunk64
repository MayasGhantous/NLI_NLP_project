  1 ) can you be sued for a threat ? 
  ( not a death threat ), 
  2 ) can you be sued if you were already suspended for that threat ? 
  3 ) how long after a threat can you be sued ? 
  4 ) can you be sued if you are under 18 ? 
  ** a little background info : ** i am currently a sophomore , and in 7th grade i was suspended for making a ( joke ) threat to a girl a year older than me . 
  we were both in the same elective and sat at the same table . 
  i dont remember saying this at all , but apparently i told her a threat , but was a joke ( not a death threat ) .
