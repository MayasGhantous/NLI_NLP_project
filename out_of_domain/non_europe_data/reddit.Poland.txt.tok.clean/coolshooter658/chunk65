  she took it really seriously , i got suspended for a week , got banned from the curbside bus , and got a police report for 6 months because her mom called the cops . 
  also , i asked her where she got her bookbag , because i liked it , and she thought i was going to stalk her because of that . 
  so now she is going around suing people for ridiculous thing ( like eating a pbj sandwich in front of her because shes allergic to peanut butter ) , but some serious things like bullying . 
  so , now i am really scared of being sued . 
  thank you for the help !,
