  so i bought a ps3 back when tlou came out , and made my account . 
  my gamertag was ( 99 % sure ) coolshooter658 . 
  a few weeks ago when i got my vita and signed in , its something else . 
  i have the same email , so what gives ? 
  also , does anyone know if you will be able to change your gamertag ? 
  i want to get ps + on black friday , but not if i have to keepthis weird ( for lack of a better word ) gamertag . 
  thanks !, 
  edit : nevermind , found out you cant change it . 
  but does anyone know why my account name changed ? 
  i watched a review of the game , and to be honest , it looks pretty fun . 
  reminds me of this game called silkroad ( if any of you know what that is ) . 
  is it any good ? 
  what are the major/minor flaws/cons of it ? 
  seems like a game similar to silkroad , but i dont know . 
  is it ? 
  the fitness club in my school is starting up again in 2 weeks , and i really want to increase my endurance and speed . 
  so what speed do you guys run on and for how long ? 
  right now , i think i can run about 35 minutes on 5.5 . 
  looking to get bf4 , but dont know where it will be cheaper . 
  does anyone know , from past origin sales ? 
  if it is new , will the used be cheaper ? 
  or stay the same price ? 
  also , if the used one is cheaper , will that apply for the b2g1 free event ? 
  and the for the event , the free item has to be cheaper than the lowest price of the 2 games , right ?
