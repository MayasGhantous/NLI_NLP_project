  16gb + memory card, 
  ** steam **, 
  $ 20 steam card, 
  i bought tearaway yesterday , filled out the info , and checked out as a guest . 
  i didnt get an email about it , do they send you one or do you just get the package ? 
  i ordered an 8gb vita memory card on friday for $ 10 , but still hasnt shipped . 
  anyone know when they will restock ? 
  i accidentally threw out my receipt and was wanting to exchange a game i bought for another one ( $ 5 more ) . 
  so can i just go and add $ 5 and get the other game , or will i have to pay more ? 
  thanks !, 
  the code was on the receipt , which i accidentally threw out . 
  so if anyone would be kind enough , it would be greatly appreciated  thank you !, 
  i bought resistance for the vita and the online code was on the receipt , but i accidentally threw it out . 
  if anyone has a spare one they would be willing to give away , it would be greatly appreciated , 
  i was walking from school to the bus stop when i saw this guy with 2 full carts of stuff walking from waldbaums . 
  he was having some trouble , so me and my friend went and asked him if he needed any help . 
  apparently he was deaf . 
  he started signing , and i got the basic jist ( that he was deaf ) . 
  he made 2 signs and i would like to know what they mean , if you guys dont mind : one was where he had his 2 fingers next to each other with a little space in between them , like this-l l. another was where he had his index finger and made kind of a half circle with it . 
  thanks !, 
  do i get it now , or wait since i dont have premium ? 
  and if i have to wait , where do i download it from ?

  looking to get one for my birthday , which is in about a month . 
  so far , the surface rt looks good at a fair price , but can it handle bf4 ? 
  i would love to play games on a tablet . 
  so yea , whats the cheapest tablet that can handle games like bf ? 
  graphics dont matter too much , as long as i can play it without lag or anything like that .
