  i wanted commando at first , but then i saw you had empire at war , so i would prefer to have that .

  can you do the 3 keys and genuine for battlefront and empire at war or no ? 
  alright .

  its for making significant contributions to fields such as acting , entertainment , etc. . and i am pretty sure witcher is the best and most successful game to come out of poland .

  game : [ star wars battlefront ii $ 9.99 ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/6060/?snr=1_7_15__13 ), 
  i know , i missed the sale . _ . 
  would you do gates to infinity for street fighter iv ? 
  alright . 
  would you do white 2 + l4d2 +75 % off total war shogun 2 +5 tf2 keys for sapphire and luigis mansion dark moon and heart gold ? 
  would you be willing to do sapphire or heart gold ? 
  i 'm really interested in either of those 2, 
  does heart gold include the pokewalker ? 
  if so , i think white 2 is a fair offer since both are like $ 40 . 
  for sapphire i think l4d2 and the shogun 75 % off is a good deal, 
  damn , for both games ? 
  im very interseted in minish cap and possibly leaf green .

  [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/coolshooter658/comments/1dafo3/h_games_for_gba_pc_wii_psp_360_gc_ds/ ) is my list . 
  i can throw in some money to even it out if you find something . 
  what would you take for sappire ? 
  do you know any other good android phones for sprint , besides htc ? 
  i had 2 htc 's before and they both dissapointed me . 
  what about the s3 ? 
  it is free for an upgrade while the s4 i need to pay $ 150 . 
  are there any major differences between them ?
