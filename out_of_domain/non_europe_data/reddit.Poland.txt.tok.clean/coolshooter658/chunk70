  i am completely open to negotiations . 
  any price i give is not firm , and am willing to take combinations of paypal+games . 
  should i wait for injustice to go on sale , or go with psabr since its on sale right now ? 
  which is better ? 
  i havent played either , but would really like a fighting game on vita . 
  i know the basic stuff , surviving , looting , etc. . 
  but what do you do that pulls you into the game every time ? 
  do you build forts or something ? 
  or do you just keep wandering the map ? 
  also , how does the server system work ? 
  is it like minecraft , where you play on 1 server for a long time , or you just join a random lobby every time ? 
  lastly , are there vehicles ? 
  since the standalone came out , i have been really wanting it , but dont want to waste $ 30 . 
  thank you !,
