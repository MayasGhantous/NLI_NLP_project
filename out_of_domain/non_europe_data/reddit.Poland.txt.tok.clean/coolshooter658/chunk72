  hey , i was looking at different psu 's , and seeing where they were cheaper . 
  i was originally going to go with [ this ] ( http://www.bestbuy.com/site/500-bronze-500w-power-supply/1017256.p;jsessionid=83cb47f8f9a9901c139017e8c0da9934.bbolsp-app01-191?id=1219045510716&skuid=1017256&st=evga%20500&cp=1&lp=1 ) one , but then i saw [ this ] ( http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?edpno=8748218&catid=1079 ) one . 
  what is the difference between them ? 
  which should i get ? 
  thanks !, 
  i recently had some friends over to play some halo customs , though i noticed i had a ton of maps missing . 
  for example , i had the trash compactor map , but not the game type and vice versa with some others . 
  i checked both the cloud saved games and my hard drive , and they werent there , like they just disappeared . 
  anyone know anything about this ?

  i am brand new to overclocking , and just built my first pc . 
  here are the specs :, 
  evga 500w bronze psu, 
  1 tb seagate barracuda hard drive, 
  amd a10-5800k trinity 3.8 ghz cpu, 
  powercolor 7870 gpu, 
  should i overclock ? 
  if so , can anyone tell me the cons of it ?

  thanks !, 
  so i just built my pc and got it up and running today . 
  but i am having 2 problems with it , related to gaming . 
  1 ) when i play this game garrys mod , the left side of my keyboard stops working ( caps lock , shift , control ) . 
  also , sometimes theres a massive lag between the pc and my keyboard . 
  like i will press w , i will stand still then after like 20 seconds i will move . 
  2 ) for some reason , my pc shuts down randomly when i game . 
  the cpu should be cool , i have 3 fans in the case , 1 gpu , and 1 cpu so 5 fans . 
  i dont see how it could overheat . 
  i downloaded speedfan , though i dont think it says my cpu temp . 
  any help ?
