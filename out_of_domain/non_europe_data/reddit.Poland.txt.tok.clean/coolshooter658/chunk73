  would really like for the 2 to be bundles together , but its ok if you ave just one of those . 
  so a few days ago , a hacker joined a server i am a mod on , and fucked around with everyones stuff . 
  for example , on the bottom right hand corner there is this thing he enabled , which says my fps , and other stuff as well as some chart ( i am guessing how loud the other players are talking ) . 
  also , he must have done something with the volume or something because i can not understand a word anyone is saying . 
  anyone know how to fix this ? 
  i already 100 % uninstalled and re-installed , and it didnt fix it . 
  so i recently noticed that the 2 fans that face me on my pc are pretty fast , and pretty much blow into my face when i am on my computer . 
  how do i turn them down ? 
  i read somewhere that you have to access the bios menu , but i did that and couldnt find the menu to turn them down . 
  is there a software or something to turn it down ?
