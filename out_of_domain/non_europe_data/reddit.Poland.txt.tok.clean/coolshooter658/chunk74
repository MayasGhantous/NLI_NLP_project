  [ inventory is here ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/id/coolshooter658/inventory/ ) . 
  looking to get a copy of source for cheap . 
  i got ta say , thinking about the old days of silkroad , it was so much better . 
  i would say about 3 years ago the game the last time it was `` good '' ( imo ) . 
  nowadays , when i log on , there are some things i immediately notice that make me want to turn away right away :, 
  1 ) the devs have not been able to get rid of the bot problem . 
  pretty much everyone in hotan now is a bot, 
  2 ) they need more secure servers . 
  silkroad gets hacked a lot , and i even lost a bunch of silk i paid for because of some hackers . 
  3 ) the devs focus too much on the item mall i think . 
  i feel like the game is slowly becoming pay-to-win . 
  4 ) why did they get rid of gold for lower levels ? 
  the monk token system thing is so stupid imo . 
  what was wrong with just having gold ? 
  5 ) they messed up the job system completely . 
  back in the days of trader/hunter/thief , jobs and trades actually mattered . 
  no one cares about jobs anymore since a ) they dont `` advertise '' the jobs as much b ) it takes forever just to get a few specialty goods boxes, 
  6 ) there is such a low actual player population , there is nobody to talk to or pvp or anything . 
  7 ) the elixir thing i think they messed up too . 
  what is the point of incomplete elixirs ? 
  8 ) why did they decide to give everyone sos 's ? 
  they made it so that sos 's are worth almost nothing until you get to a higher level . 
  what was wrong with having to save up gold for something you wanted ? 
  dont get me wrong , silkroad is my favorite mmorpg , i just think the devs really need to set themselves straight if they want to save this game . 
  it used to be one of the best mmorpg 's , now the fan base is dwindling . 
  i am curious to know what you guys think of this . 
  thanks for reading !, 
  so i have been dieting ( trying to eat less than 1500 calories a day ) and it has been pretty good !, 
  i lost about 15 pounds in a few months , though i am starting to work out this week . 
  so my question is , how come one day ( i weigh myself in the morning ) i weigh 134 , the next 132 and the next 134.4 ? 
  theres no way i lost 2 pounds in a day . 
  and some days when i dont eat that much i still gain weight somehow , but days when i eat regularly i lose . 
  what ? 
  also , i have a few more questions :, 
  1 ) i am a 16 year old male , 5 ' 8 . 
  imo 134 is pretty good for my age and height . 
  i have a pretty flat stomach , but my upper ab area has a good amount of fat on it . 
  same thing with my fingers . 
  up until ~ october my fingers were skinny while i weighed more . 
  then when i begin to lose weight , my fingers just got fat . 
  how do i lose the fat on my fingers and ab area ? 
  2 ) my cousin told me that he is 5 ' 7 and 133 pounds and same age . 
  how is it possible that me and him essentially weigh the same weight , if i am a little bit taller than him , i have more muscle and fat too . 
  he is just skin and bones , yet he weighs the same as me ? 
  what ? 
  3 ) how can i * lose * some muscle in my thighs ? 
  my thighs are like , huge and there isnt that much fat on them . 
  it is mainly just muscle , and i would really want to thin out my thighs .
