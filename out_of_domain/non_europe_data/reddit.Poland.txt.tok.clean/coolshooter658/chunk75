  cod, 
  resistance, 
  playstation all stars battle royale, 
  sly cooper, 
  assassins creed, 
  killzone, 
  and all the ps + games, 
  so i am looking for a new vita game to play , but i have searched through a ton of lists of games and i have no clue as to what i want . 
  im not really into jrpg 's too much , though i really am enjoying persona 4 . 
  i wouldnt mind an indie game really . 
  i know this kind of sounds stupid , i just dont really know how to put it into words . 
  the games i already have are, 
  little big planet, 
  persona 4 golden, 
  cod, 
  resistance, 
  playstation all stars battle royale, 
  sly cooper, 
  assassins creed, 
  killzone, 
  runner 2, 
  and all the ps + games, 
  what game do you guys recommend for under $ 30 ? 
  there are 2 scratches on my screen that really irk me when i play . 
  i would really like to get a new screen , a new set seems to go for ~ $ 30 on ebay , which is better than the $ 130 i would have to pay sony .
