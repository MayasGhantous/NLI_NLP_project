  so i was wondering if anyone here actually replaced it by themselves , and how it went . 
  also , if you could post the guide you used , that would be awesome . 
  thanks !, 
  just wanted to let everyone know !, 
  so recently i got back into my vita and started playing again . 
  but i realized that my vita just eats the battery life very quickly . 
  for example , my friend was playing cod on my vita and the battery was ~ half gone in about 1.5 hours . 
  for some reason it uses a lot of battery when asleep as well . 
  when i put my vita back in my bag after my friend used it and took it out about 1-2 hours later the battery was nearly done . 
  anyone know how to fix this or what to do ? 
  i play on the lowest brightness as well . 
  thank you !,
