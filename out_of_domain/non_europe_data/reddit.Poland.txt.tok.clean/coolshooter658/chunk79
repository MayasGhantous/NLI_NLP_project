  hey all !, 
  i am trying to make a big spreadsheet of the map and game variants people have in halo 3 . 
  this would make is easier for everyone , so that we dont have to scour through pages of google to find someone with it in their fileshare . 
  i have a survey set up [ here ] ( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1thu4j69gakpnbzwo5ukq2ao2kjfilo3zwnodevldwb8/viewform?usp=send_form ) . 
  please fill it out , and i will put the results in the spreadsheet and share it when i get a few submissions !, 
  i see many people with empty file shares , so make sure to fill yours up with your custom games !, 
  also , people may have to add you in order to see your file share , so please dont delete them , let them delete you so they have time to download your games . 
  you dont have to accept the request , just let it stay pending . 
  another way to get to someones fs is to invite them to a private chat ( which i recommend doing , to not clutter up peoples friends lists ), 
  i tried to get the mods help in this , but they never responded to my message for whatever reason . 
  i hope that this can go into the wiki , and this post can stay stickied for a little to get peoples attention . 
  thanks a lot !, 
  results will be shared soon !, 
  please upvote to get peoples attention !,

  there was this video of cs source i think involving paszabiceps i believe it was . 
  it was on dust 2 on b site pasza was behind a wall peeking out and gets killed . 
  then the camera stays focused on the person that killed him 's screen and he screams kurwa . 
  it was n't an in game video , it was a video of the monitor while the guy was playing . 
  i watched it earlier this year but i ca n't find it at all right now . 
  i think somewhere in the video ( title or description ) it said like pasza goes hulk or something like that ( not 100 % on that ) . 
  if anyone knows what i am talking about and can help me out it 'd be greatly appreciated !,
