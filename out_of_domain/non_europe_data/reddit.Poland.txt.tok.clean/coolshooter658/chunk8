  there are games such as ruby/sapphire ( but i would rather have the actual game ) , digimon , super mario aadvance 4 , gold , silver , yellow , blue , green ( but these are not the actual games , they are some weird bootlegs ) , super mario bros 1/2/3 , mario kart fighter , doctor mario , super contra , adventure island , jaws , space invader , double strike , tetris 2 , etc. 
  there is still a lot more but i cant name them all . 
  just note , some games may be bootleg , the cartridge is no doubt bootleg , but there are games in it that are legit , but i cant go trough them all and check .

  [ very ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/coolshooter658/comments/1dafo3/h_games_for_gba_pc_wii_psp_360_gc_ds/ ) interested in pokemon leaf green . 
  god dammit, 
  hey i just looked at your wants list . 
  i have metroid prime for gc . 
  would you do that for leaf green ? 
  hmmm . 
  i have mario power tennis im pretty sure it is , but it is a generic case . 
  forgot to mention it has the manual . 
  alright thanks bro, 
  i have seen videos of this exact dog and others before being skinned and left to die . 
  it really makes me sick to my stomach and makes me want to cry . 
  * animals are boiled alive too , to make the skin come off easier . 
  * when i first saw the video i really tried to imagine what the dog was going through . 
  being put in a sack , boiled , and skinned , then being alive after all that torture just to basically bleed to death for hours with nothing protecting your body . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slcgxigtfrs ) is the video for those brave enough to watch it , but dont watch it if you have a weak stomach . 
  seriously . 
  [ interested ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/coolshooter658/comments/1dafo3/h_games_for_gba_pc_wii_psp_360_gc_ds/ ) in luigis mansion dark moon, 
  that first one creeped me out a little, 
  not really , sorry . 
  im interested in sapphire . 
  how is the battery ? 
  dont have a ps3 and dont play my wii . 
  sorry man . 
  [ interested ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/coolshooter658/comments/1dafo3/h_games_for_gba_pc_wii_psp_360_gc_ds/ ) in diamond . 
  i would say at the very bare minimum $ 50 . 
  i bought a yellow for $ 30 i think , and that is how much it averages on ebay , but yours is fully cib , so its worth much more . 
  i think crysis is a fair deal for diamond, 
  i 'm liking adventure time for 3ds, 
  does it save and/or is the internal clock dead ? 
  how do i know if it is a reprint or not ? 
  any time, 
  no , it doesnt . 
  ok cool pm me . 
  well what are you looking at ? 
  i could throw in 75 % off shogun , what else ? 
  definitely not . 
  i think the origin account alone is worth more than sapphire . 
  it has fifa 13 and bf 3 w / premium . 
  both i got for $ 60 each , so the account is worth at the very least $ 50 . 
  are you serious ?? 
  i never ever knew that . 
  but still , i would rather hold on to my origin , see anything else ? 
  would you do street fighter iv+f ire emblem shadow dragon for adventure time + pokemon explorers of sky ? 
  alright,
