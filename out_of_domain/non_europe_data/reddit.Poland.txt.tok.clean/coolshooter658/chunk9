  / r/outside, 
  you mean the gba bootleg game ? 
  there is a fake pokemon green , yellow , blue , red , real ruby and sapphire , mario games , some games that are not well known , etc. . im seeing la noire and black ops 2 . 
  how do i know ? 
  why the hell does microsoft get 3.5 hours while sony only gets 1 hour ? 
  i dont know why but this picture pisses me off so much ... 
  i remember back in the days of halo 3 ( my favorite video game of all time ) , all i used to do was play custom games . 
  me , my cousins , and my friends would play customs from the time we got home from school to late at night . 
  i remember one time one of my friends on xbl that i didnt talk to that much showed me some sick maps that he made , i was amazed . 
  he made a map on sandbox that was a unsc base , he made a map with a covenant cruiser , and some more but i cant remember . 
  i still remember bashing him before he showed me the maps and i felt really bad afterwards . 
  man oh man , good times . 
  another time i was forging on a saturday morning with my friend when he had to eat breakfast . 
  imo , i made a pretty cool map without him , until he came back and just ruined it with his `` awesome '' ideas . 
  and the last thing , i was once playing some halo 3 one morning and i wouldnt let my brother play , so he told my dad . 
  my dad got really pissed at me , opened the disc tray , opened the window and threw my halo out the window ( 3 stories ) . 
  luckily , it landed in the snow , and i had to run out in my pajamas in the freezing cold to get it . 
  thanks for the contest !, 
  saints row iii, 
  because i have never played a saints row game before and i heard its crazy-a couple years ago my friends said it was going to be a sin to play it, 
  yea , i know ... 
  oh the irony, 
  i cant get you pics because i just moved and dont know where it is , but basically looks exactly like [ this ] ( http://img.auctiva.com/imgdata/1/4/5/2/7/2/2/webimg/588669782_tp.jpg ), 
  yea-that blue thing you plug into the gc and it works, 
  i know it works for sure - i dont know how well though , havent used it in a while, 
  sorry dont see anything, 
  no thanks,

  thanks !, 
  i love how this is reposted a mere 20 minutes after the original op posted, 
  entered !, 
  gta iv please !, 
  would you do just cause 2 for a key ? 
  its all i have . 
  i could throw in 5 crates ( i know they are worth almost nothing , but whatever ), 
  garrys mod is pretty sweet, 
  entered !, 
  sorry dont see anything, 
  really ? 
  i thought it was better since it had more cells to work with . 
  i was playing on 1 gb before and it was a hell hole of lag , so i increased it to 3 , then 5 then 6 . 
  sorry dont see anything, 
  ok thanks man i will try that . 
  extremely underrated game , imo, 
  cod black ops ? 
  yep . 
  i still play it sometimes , still as fun as before . 
  the one thing i hate about the game-assholes who rush , especially with the covenant leaders . 
  i still get destroyed within the first 5 minutes by a warthog army or prohpet/arby/brute . 
  cool . 
  i will send you pictures by the end of today . 
  nope . 
  i always stuck with cutter-odst army all day boy !, 
  interested in fallout 3 or gta iv , for ps3 .

  i remember once me and my cousin built up 100 % of our armies as odst 's . 
  we attacked the enemies and they were completely overwhelmed by like 100 odst 's , plus the ones dropping in 24/7 . 
  honestly , i get scared pretty easily , and i can say there were parts here and there that i got really scared , i even started sweating ( which i had never done before ), 
  you probably wouldnt get found out , people do it all the time even if they somehow did find out i doubt anything would happen . 
  of course . 
  i would get it but i am trying to save up money for my new ps3, 
  first world problem, 
  brock huntsman, 
  brock hunstmans destruction asylum, 
  borderlands bundleganza ( $ 21 on amazon right now ! ), 
  when was this ? 
  and what does backdoored mean ? 
  my brother just got his account hacked , too . 
  thanks . 
  im on reticulum i am pretty sure . 
  when did this happen ? 
  i havent logged on in a while . 
  when the database was hacked .
