  what a surprise . 
  my hands are wet . 
  hal initialization failed . 
  it has finally happened . 
  i like to play [ this music ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niucovbiiy8 ) while watching things like those tutorials . 
  actually let me rephrase that , reddit is my only friend . 
  could you elaborate ? 
  i am curious , do people who are not into bondage find this good too ? 
  / r/short ( people are lazy ), 
  actually the sun and earth are orbiting the single point together . 
  that means that the sun indeed is orbiting something , 
  edit oh and the solar system is orbiting galaxy center . 
  yes but i decided to write about this because the laws of physics would crash without sun moving a bit + it is nice to let people learn something new, 
  i live to safeguard the continuity of this great society .

  seriously ?

  that how the things are in poland . 
  i thought that this is normal . 
  purge the heretic !, 
  [ better quality - youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajkgazo4bei ), 
  i always wonder ... do people simply walk in and start taking pictures ? 
  there is always a relevant xkcd . 
   your cakeday is 22 december !, 
  well , apparently i had nice christmas last year . 
  i have you tagged as `` stripper in a chicago suburb '' . 
  it is finished for the moment , but i always like to change things . 
  the docking arm is a good idea so i will most likely prepare more docking ports for docking the planes . 
  i am also going to save some space for future updates ( e.g. 
  the concept of drilling might mean that we will need storage for rocks or liquids ) . 
  that is correct  i 've seen the deorbiting video and found the picture in the comments . 
  yes , only the solar arrays were launched together and put in place using the service ship . 
  i 've learned how to dock after watching [ this tutorial ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahky3fusjiq ) . 
  you also have to remember that there is no such thing like male and female docking port as many people seem to believe ( i thought that this is true too ) . 
  if you are placing two docking ports above each other you need to rotate the higher one . 
  wow , it really is very similar !, 
  i agree that the people are pulling the trigger and weapons alone do not kill anyone . 
  following this kind of thinking it is time to ban all knives . 
  the problem always is with the society , not video games , brutal movies or free access to weapons . 
  i simply always take the complicated process of getting a gun as something normal because literally less than 1 % of people own a gun where i live . 
  this is hilarious . 
  what they have produced is not a movie . 
  it is a nightmare . 
  the base consists of 5 modules and was assembled in the mun orbit . 
  yes , i did brought it down as a single structure and it was stable . 
  lz was n't mapped i just chose the relatively flat area . 
  you just have to make the structure symmetrical and apply the same thrust to each element . 
  the engines mounted on the outer modules were used during final breaking . 
  before that i was using the rocket mounted below the central pod . 
  edit : btw rcs thrusters turned out to be unnecessary . 
  they look cool however :d, 
  well , there was docking but it in the laythe orbit  . 
  in terms of the design this base is my redesigned [ mun base ] ( http://www.reddit.com/tb/16m6gz ) adapted for long interplanetary flight , atmospheric landing on an object with stronger gravity and , what is also very important , a huge ocean on the surface . 
  it could move around if it had engines mounted at the proper angles . 
  you have to test it first before sending it to the laythe just to find out that it sinks . 
  i have made a lot of test landings on kerbin - to check how fast can i go before splashdown , see if the base actually floats , test the interplanetary stage separation system ( isss , i like it ) and so on . 
  by attempting to float them  . 
  also you probably should not expect the parts like girders to float . 
   light is just traveling so fast that gravity does n't really have a chance to affect it . 
  light is affected by the gravity : [ that is how the relativity theory was proved for the first time . 
  since the space itself is bend and the light does not actually change its direction , the same thing would happen to the ship . 
  the trajectory change while travelling at the short distances , eg solar system only , around the planets similar to the ones in the kerbol system ( or any other planets ) would be negligible , however i ca n't support my answer with any numbers . 
  * [ core ] ( http://www.filedropper.com/basecore ), 
  * [ module ] ( http://www.filedropper.com/basemodule ), 
  what to do with those :, 
  launch the core and put it in the lunar orbit . 
  dock the 4 modules to the station core . 
  put the whole thing in the sub orbital trajectory using the engine mounted below the central module . 
  after separation of the central engine break using the engines installed on the outer modules , you should have plenty of fuel to spare . 
  rcs thrusters are actually redundant . 
  sorry for making you wait so long : /,

  just curious , what the hell are bb 's ? 
  now it makes sense , thanks . 
  we need more cool submissions like this . 
  i would panic so hard . 
  i always solve all programming/physics related problems i have . 
  15 minutes later i leave the bathroom with a solution .

   i 've worked with 3,875,000 engineers ( ... ) 95 % have done what i told them to do ( ... ) precisely 1,000,000 engineers have done what i told them to do [ an estimate : pms do n't have time for math ] . 
  please do n't make math jokes like this one . 
  [ sixty symbols ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/sixtysymbols ), 
  how about http://webdesignerwall.com/, 
   no that 's due to the doppler effect . 
  please edit this heresy . 
  the doppler effect has nothing to do with that . 
  it is just similar to the doppler effect . 
  the red shift of the galaxies occurs due to the expansion of space which stretches the wave itself , while the doppler effect happens due to the relative velocity of two objects . 
  it is consistent the same way the inertial force in non inertial reference frame is consistent with gravity . 
  the effects are the same - i am falling on the floor of the accelerating rocket . 
  but explaining this force through the gravity is totally wrong .
