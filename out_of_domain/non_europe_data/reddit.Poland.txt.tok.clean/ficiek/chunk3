  it is like saying that the wood is made of basic elements because :, 
  * it floats in the water, 
  * it burns giving fire, 
  * the trees grow in the earth, 
  * ok i am out of ideas , lets say the burning wood releases smoke - air, 
  @edit : accelerating * rocket, 
  my heart stopped for a few seconds . 
  sadly a three dimensional creature like human can not visualize this . 
  this is just a set of equations . 
  if someone is waving his hands and talking about curvature of space at the same time , he is probably wrong .

  yep , i play with 4 high school friends and it is really great that way . 
  i am probably unlucky , but each time i play solo queue there are afk players in my team or someone is raging the entire game . 
  [ fuck you , pay me !, 
  well in theory you can mouse over using a smartphone - just click and hold . 
  but users have to be able to tell the difference between normal items and those which have hidden content . 
  as far as i know : hover : active are handled differently by different mobile browsers . 
  so it is really hard to tell . 
  click and hold hovers for example in the native nokia browser used by smartphones with symbian . 
  try scrolling faster . 
  it is a joke . 
  your friend puts a hand to the face and you hit him . 
  yeah , i recently started to think that i have one . 
  i ca n't even sleep at night because i constantly remember all my fuck ups . 
  they actually do that on the iss . 
  so is the fear of nuclear power plants . 
  coal mining and pollution caused by coal burning most likely causes more deaths every year ( it is 12pm in my time zone so i am too tired to look for statistics ) . 
  but i know that such events make a huge impression on people . 
  also the chernobyl was in a large part a very dumb and basic human error . 
  edit : [ chernobyl accident , read first two paragraphs . 
  ] ( http://www.hpa.org.uk/topics/radiation/understandingradiation/understandingradiationtopics/radiationincidents/chernobyl/ ) furthermore reactor like the one in the chernobyl uses graphite instead of water as a moderator . 
  that is a bad idea because when the cooling system fails there is nothing which stops the reactor from overheating . 
  if the water is used the failure of a cooling system simply stops the reaction because neutrons are not slowed down anymore . 
  radiation doses :, 
  * maximum permitted dose for emergency workers by who ~ 500 msv/year = 60 \u00b5sv / h ^ [ wiki ] . 
  * average yearly dose : ~ 4msv = 0.5 \u00b5sv / h ^ [ 2 ] . 
  * lowest yearly dose liked to increased cancer risk : 100msv = 10\u00b5sv / h ^ [ 2 ] . 
  according to wikipedia the radiation levels which pose any danger occured only in one direction ( max was 170 \u03bcsv / h and the other peak in a different location was 95 \u03bcsv / h ) and the radiation did not pose the threat farther than 30km which is ~ 19mi . 
  farther away `` dose of 3 -- 170 \u03bcsv / h was measured to the north-west on 17 march , while it was 1 -- 5 \u03bcsv / h in other directions . '', 
  so i totally agree that accidents like this are dangerous . 
  but they are not very common and also :, 
  * living within 50 miles of a nuclear reactor 1 day : 0.09 \u00b5s, 
  * living within 50 miles of a coal plant 1 day : 0.3 \u00b5s, 
  * deaths per 1twh produced using coal : 144 ^ [ 1 ], 
  * deaths per 1twh produced using nuclear power : 0.04 ^ [ 1 ], 
  furthermore it is important to remember about the other factors like ordinary pollution causing global warming and illnesses etc. 
  taking this into account all those nuclear emergencies are the local issues , not the coal plants . 
  radiation is not everything . 
  also our technology is getting better and better so there will be less accidents . 
  accually i think there were only two worth noting - fukushima and chernobyl , and the second one could have been avoided . 
  surely the best idea would be to use nuclear fusion but we ca n't get those reactions to be efficient yet .

  you can escape earth 's gravity moving infinitely slow , provided you have constant propulsion .

  i prefer fake choices altering the means of achieving something but leading to the same ending . 
  `` steal the key or break the lock '' is fine , but `` sacrifice yourself or kill everyone else '' during the final sequence is not desired .

  soyuz is very reliable , but it has a few issues . 
  for example before the reentry , reentry module must separate from service and orbital modules . 
  it turns out that it does not always happen , especially after it remains in orbit for a prolonged time ( for example attached to the space station ) . 
  the explosive bolts tend to fail after the long exposure to cosmic radiation . 
  after an incident like that the procedure has been developed witch puts the soyuz sideways before the separation , so that the air could break away the modules in case of a separation problem . 
  i always try to separate as late as possible in ksp . 
  that way there are bigger reentry effects and of course bigger challenge . 
  but i ca n't wait for the reentry heat and some kind of the heat shields .
