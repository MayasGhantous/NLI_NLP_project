  that was easy . 
  [ carl sagan - you are here ( pale blue dot ) - you tube ] ( http://youtu.be/4pn5jjdh78i ), 
  please , post a lot earlier next time . 
  my friend had the same problem . 
  wrong filepath error without any reason . 
  we could n't find the problem so he had to create project from scratch , moving all files . 
  that solved the issue but we still have no idea what was wrong . 
  i would be very glad do hear a solution . 
  yeah , i have the same problem . 
  i get moved nearly each time i move the camera around . 
  yeah , why not post something like `` when this post is n hours old i will start drawing on twitch '' . 
  [ this is octocat !, 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/40/octocat,_a_mascot_of_github.jpg ), 
  i do that too . 
  in certain situations you can help your teammates by getting the tank 's full attention . 
  as far as i know twitch records everything automatically . 
  i like this version with a different soundtrack : http://youtu.be/4pn5jjdh78i, 
  unfortunately it still lacks the best feature of sublime text : the go to anything panel . 
  ( i am going to make this easier for the next person ),

  i have two good trailers from / r/gaming,

  i am afraid to install any drivers on ubuntu because nvidia drivers ruined my installation the same day i installed ubuntu as a second system . 
  i had to reinstall it immediately after that , all i could get was a black screen with a blinking cursor . 
  first impression like that is really bad :( . 
  why did n't he just make his own distro based on this windows 7 ? 
  8 gigs and constantly swapping . 
  i was genuinely interested by all those posts containing board games , chess etc. 
  you ca n't even change your fucking email on origin . 
  what were they thinking ? 
  parse error : syntax error , unexpected ' } ' in / var/www/vhosts / austinspizza.com/httpdocs/order.php on line 357, 
  that is why i run gentoo . 
  i had the same thing happen to me and i was forced to change the boot loader to syslinyux . 
  hopefully your answers will help guys . 
  no problems with syslinux , i precisely followed the [ beginners ' guide ] ( https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/beginners%27_guide ) during installation . 
   screenfetch . 
  i have a question : why is urxvt so popular ? 
  i use it on my arch install because people recommend it but i actually have no idea why it is superior to other emulators . 
  good enough . 
  i do n't have any problems with it so i am going to stick with it . 
  i have made that during my programming class . 
  1.5 h of graded work removed . 
  link to famous original boot post ? 
  i 'd just like to interject for a moment . 
  what you 're referring to as linux , is in fact , gnu/linux , or as i 've recently taken to calling it , gnu plus linux . 
  linux is not an operating system unto itself , but rather another free component of a fully functioning gnu system made useful by the gnu corelibs , shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full os as defined by posix . 
  many computer users run a modified version of the gnu system every day , without realizing it . 
  through a peculiar turn of events , the version of gnu which is widely used today is often called `` linux '' , and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the gnu system , developed by the gnu project . 
  there really is a linux , and these people are using it , but it is just a part of the system they use . 
  linux is the kernel : the program in the system that allocates the machine 's resources to the other programs that you run . 
  the kernel is an essential part of an operating system , but useless by itself ; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system . 
  linux is normally used in combination with the gnu operating system : the whole system is basically gnu with linux added , or gnu/linux . 
  all the so-called `` linux '' distributions are really distributions of gnu/linux . 
  i watched it 5 times . 
  this is awesome . 
  does it display the orbital map ? 
  there is no such thing visible in the provided screenshots on forums . 
  seriously ? 
  there are night battles ? 
  that is awesome , i am going to play right now in hope to encounter one . 
  are they available on all game modes ? 
  thanks for the mirror , site is dead right now . 
  yeah , the year of the linux desktop is always one year away . 
  [ yeah , this image is quite popular too . 
  but wait , there is more !, 
  they say that it is possible to communicate with any device with bluetooth . 
  i do n't have an android device but i could make a nice use of it with my laptop . 
  i would certainly consider buying this . 
  i do n't understand . 
  they took the raspberry pi and added keyboard , wifi dongle and several other things to it . 
  is that innovative or something ? 
  why is everyone so excited ? 
   time to wait until outside of kerbin 's pull for fuel efficiency . 
  i died a little while reading that sentence . 
  actually i do n't remember ever seeing anyone insulting other people on that board . 
  i was in the same situation but my engine failed when i was literally few meters away . 
  sudden silence was very annoying . 
  i ca n't wait for the official implementation of the resources . 
  i got really hyped up on that when they announced the whole mechanic . 
  imo resources would be a lot more interesting then science but i understand that the game is still being developed and science with the tech tree got the priority . 
  i thought about installing kethane mod but i am somehow reluctant to use too many mods . 
  the only one i use is kwrocetry with all parts except fairings removed . 
  they look awesome . 
   i 'll grant that many of the gui environments have done a poor job of presenting dotfiles , but that 's a problem with them , not with dotfiles . 
  i have nothing against hidden files . 
  all programs however should but their config files into the . config directory . 
  damn , i was waiting for your tutorial for months . 
  for a minute i thought that the entire article is a satire . 
  what am i using ? 
  european here . 
  feets for altitude , knots for speed , kilometers for range . 
  just like civilian aircraft  . 
  as to the measurments : i does n't matter how many meters is 15 000 feet .
