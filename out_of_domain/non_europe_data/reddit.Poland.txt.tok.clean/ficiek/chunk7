  the title sounds like an ie joke . 
  to be honest : [ it is a terrible feature ] ( http://i.imgur.com/txld7vg.png ) . 
  i tried it and it was really annoying to use . 
  i prefer the cats api, 
  at least post the source . 
  yeah , i noticed . 
  i saw this one first . 
  i never thought about that . 
  should i worry about that and serve all files from my own server on the reset page ? 
  amazing , that site is great since i basically need 5 icons . 
   while there 's ( usually small ) point in using it just for yourself, 
  okay , i can not continue reading . 
  small point ? 
  what the hell . 
  from datetime import *, 
  you can always check on http://linlap.com/, 
  but a mac is a pc . 
  this question does not make any sense . 
  it is like asking someone if he uses a compiler or gcc . 
  submodules are just links to external repositories . 
  they are not local independent versions of the repository added as a submodule . 
  changes to them must be introduced by changing the repository added as a submodule . 
  to update them with your own changes , you would have to either :, 
  * clone the repository which is your submodule , modify it and add your modified fork as a submodule of your parent repo, 
  * modify the official repository, 
  submodules are separate on purpose - it is a way of including other , separate projects like libraries in your repository . 
  they are stored only as a single line in the config - their url . 
  fresh copy of the commit your submodule is pointing to is downloaded each time you clone your parent repo . 
  think of this process as creating a symlink to the directory you do not have write access to . 
  on a side note the submodules are frozen at a specific commit unless you update them . 
  i like projects like that because i am one of the people generating them out of boredom but honestly i do n't think this will be widely used . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ additionally ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ believe ^ ^ ^ ^ we ^ ^ ^ ^ should ^ ^ ^ ^ keep ^ ^ ^ ^ js ^ ^ ^ ^ where ^ ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ ^ belongs . 
  honestly , the page ca n't even render without js enabled ? 
  is css deprecated now ? 
  ps it is very cool . 
  protip : http://trello.com/, 
  i usually redirect www to non-www . 
  it looks nicer and it is easier to read . 
  there are no downsides to stripping www , right ? 
  yeah obviously you will get an extra call , i was asking about issues with things like search engines . 
  thanks for clearing that up . 
  in doubt http://linlap.com you can check linux support there . 
  i am responding to everyone : i believe that you can avoid sttings cookies by using ` example.com ` instead of ` . example.com `, 
  they somehow avoid sending cookies to ` assets-cdn . github.com `, 
  edit : spelling, 
  i am currently using raspberry pi . 
  it is to weak for me , i need to run a large db and several django websites . 
  i lookd for intel atoms but it is hard to find anything suitable ( or i do n't know how to search ) . 
  i found this motherboard too , i think this could actually be a valid option . 
  i think it was that one : http://i.imgur.com/qsbdmdx.jpg, 
  and more :, 
  that is awesome advertising . 
  i immediately went to linux journal and i am reading it now . 
  is it possible to copy from terminal to lets say firefox ? 
  i am unable to do that . 
  am i doing it wrong ? 
  i can paste from firefox to urxvt just fine . 
  i am going to post this here , as always . 
  shit , it is working now but i know that sometimes i could n't copy things from the terminal like that . 
  and i know that you are thinking `` yeah , sure '' but honestly sometimes it fails , especially if you use ctrl-c ctrl-v a lot in gui programs . 
  well the problem is that they sometimes override each other . 
  i will have to find a fix in the wiki . 
  sublime text is not open source and it is really expensive . 
  yes , i also ` pacman - syu -- force ` daily . 
  do n't . 
  donate to free software foundation or as i like to call it rms/free software foundation + freedom instead . 
  unity is a great project which delivers a consistent user experience for desktop and netbook users alike . 
  putting great design at the heart of the project , unity and its technologies such as application indicators , system indicators , and notify osd , have strived to solve common problems in the free software desktop while optimizing the experience for touch , consistency and collaboration . 
  the idea of the class based views ? 
  yes . 
  the build in views ? 
  all features like that are good for basic things and useless for anything more complex . 
  anyone who did a bigger project in django would understand that . 
  generally those build in views are just bloat because you have to basically rewrite them anyway . 
   the orm is garbage . 
   the template language was a toy project . 
   reusable apps are not reusable . 
   class-based generic views are dogshit . 
  all those things are beautiful ideas with quite poor execution . 
  honestly , django is fine but it looks like there are better alternatives to many things it implements , like jinja2 and sqlalchemy . 
  also i have to write my custom class every time i want app specific settings , as you said which is really weird . 
  me too . 
  the mix of an agile de by canonical and bleeding edge os like arch linux creates a great server environment . 
  i also hope to see this setup on supercomputers . 
  how do you start your x server ? 
  display manager ? 
  real linux users type ` startx ` in the tty , i tell you ` hwat . 
  i have a retarded question . 
  enlighten me , please , why this is not up to date . 
  what do you mean exactly ? 
  basically all you need is ` hjkl ` with a bit of ` man ranger ` or ` : help ` and reading the configuration files copied with ` -- copy-config = all ` as indicated in the man pages . 
  i am going to steal/rebuild that so hard . 
   revision control, 
  [ starts talking about some websites , not vc systems ], 
   javascript only server-side . 
  yeah , right . 
   chromium instead of chrome as it 's 100 % open source . 
  that 's always a bonus . 
  uses sublime text . 
  edit : almost forgot : web designer/developer with a stock website .
