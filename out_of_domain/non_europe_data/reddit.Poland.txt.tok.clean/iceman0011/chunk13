  are superpowers real ? 
  right now i only get good days and awesome days . 
  my energy levels are off the charts !, 
  that 's the most exhilirating feeling . 
  in terms of physical excercises i have improved especially my capacity for short intensive efforts like push ups , pull ups , deadlifts . 
  i think my aerobic endurance stayed roughly unchanged but that 's a whole different story since i 've been an avid mtb racer for many years . 
  this year i eased off with training however to have more time for other hobbies and work . 
  even if it 's just getting back to who you 're supposed to be , it sounds a lot more fun and reassuring to claim superpowers so i will continue to do so . 
  this might also help staying on the right track with nofap . 
  work on your weaknesses **, 
  i am still far from where i 'd like to be in terms of social skills , body language and all round confidence . 
  since i view pmo as a thing of past , i now try to concentrate all my efforts on building the right social persona for myself . 
  meeting new people has always been a huge problem for me . 
  i guess i can display a lot of confidence in certain types of in interactions but i get really nervous talking to women or strangers . 
  it 's like someone 's turning part of my brain off and often i ca n't steer the conversation where i like . 
  so right now i try and learn how to initiate conversations myself , i go out more . 
  i 've started a dance class to sort of throw myself more out there . 
  i can not recommend this enough . 
  this may help a lot if you feel nervous around women . 
  this may sound silly , but you 'll see how they actually like being close to you while dancing and how they respond to what you do on a dance floor . 
  plus dancing can be really relaxing and fun - i never thought i would say that . 
  i know this is long but i thought i owe this to the community . 
  this challenge is really worth it . 
  i wish you all success !, 
  thanks . 
  also please ask me anything you want . 
  i ca n't believe i am almost at 90 days , it went incredibly fast . 
  first let me say that improving my life is something i 've always paid a lot of attention to . 
  by that i mean learning new stuff , acquiring new skills etc. 
  nofap for me was an extension of that thinking : what else can i do to live my life to the fullest . 
  and ** nothing so far gave me such a rapid push forward as doing this challenge ** so i encourage you to not quit . 
  i can guarantee it 'll not make things worst , very likely you will get some benefits . 
  maybe my addiction was n't as severe as some people 's but , boy , am i glad to have overcome it . 
  of course the hardest thing in the beginning was to learn to control your sex drive , not give in to temptation and quit old habits but right now this is hardly a challenge . 
  my point is that overcoming a harmful habit and seeing progress in your life gives you a huge confidence boost and you go around like you 're on high all the time . 
  ( if you ever listen to tony robbins , he talks a lot about progress - tune in to some of his speeches . ), 
  question is how to maintain that high . 
  many people report about flatlines and mood swings and i suspect that part of it might have something to do with hormonal stuff and dopamine balancing itself out , but from psychological standpoint you 're just getting used to a `` new set of habits '' and after a while you notice there 's no progress in your life anymore . 
  things might have changed for better but at this point it 's not enough !, 
  well , if you can get that high from doing new exciting stuff and breaking your comfort zone to see what you 're capable of , than maybe you should do exciting stuff all the time . 
  i found an answer in this video which i posted here before but it 's long so i guess nobody watched it . 
  here it is : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uirin3tmig8, 
  the guy talks a lot about doing new stuff and improving your `` game '' . 
  getting to a new level of `` game '' when your previous level starts to feel like a flatline . 
  but you do n't do it to sleep with women nor to seek validation . 
  what counts is just the excitement of doing what you were n't capable of before and the bliss you get form that . 
  that 's the ** ultimate reward from nofap and life ** , i guess , 
  even though during the last 82 days i did more new stuff than in the last couple of years before nofap , i realized that i still have to do more . 
  because doing new stuff feels good for a while but at some point you 'll feel like you were only dipping your toes in unknown waters . 
  because what you want is to break your comfort zone , jump into the ice cold water and make a huge splash . 
  so for the next 90 days my challenge is to do more cold approaches , just talk to women , make new friends , call people i was afraid to call for a long time , start networking more , take more risks in terms of crazy ideas for my business . 
  the challenge is to do all that and not give a fuck . 
  i wish there was a sub for that . 
  ** tl dr : do new stuff . 
  break your comfort zone . 
  do not limit yourself to nofap challenge as an ultimate benefit reaping tool for your life . 
  * ( for those who are just starting out , i wrote a longish post 2 weeks ago on short term benefits of nofap . 
  you might want to check it out : http://www.reddit.com/r/nofap/comments/2b7a0r/nofap_powerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr_celebration_a_word_of/ ) *, 
  as someone wise once said : `` believe only in that which gives you strength . 
  forget about what weigh you down '' . 
  it 's that simple . 
  ... but chickened out just when i should have asked her out . 
  can someone just slap me hard ? 
  the other side of things is that i know where she works and can find her but to work up the courage and ask her out would be the hardest thing i did in my life i think . 
  granted it 's very important first step to take . 
  but if you do n't take action and go about improving yourself further , you might just as well stayed in your mom 's basement fapping to porn like you used to . 
  someone mentioned this book in in one of the threads , so here 's a question to those who have read it : in what way did the book influence you ? 
  or maybe it did n't . 
  is it cliched or intelligently written ? 
  does it push you to take action or is it just describing some ideas ? 
  would you recommend it to your friend ? 
  share your thoughts . 
  `` every addiction arises from an unconscious refusal to face and move through your own pain . 
  every addiction starts with pain and ends with pain . 
  whatever the substance you are addicted to - alcohol , food , legal or illegal drugs , or a person - you are using something or somebody to cover up your pain . 
  that is why , after the initial euphoria has passed , there is so much unhappiness , so much pain in intimate relationships . 
  they do not cause pain and unhappiness . 
  they bring out the pain and unhappiness that is already in you . 
  every addiction does that . 
  every addiction reaches a point where it does not work for you anymore , and then you feel the pain more intensely than ever '' . 
  from * the power of now * . 
  i 'd gladly swap each instance of myself fapping and watching porn for one of those . 
  it 's just a thought since i had one of those conversations today and , well , it was awkward , but at least i 'll remember that for a long time unlike the sessions with my old pixelated girlfriends from before nofap . 
  even though i acted as a social-retard , i 'll tell you that i 'm glad i talked to her . 
  even if it does n't go well , it 's not nearly as bad as we often picture it . 
  actually if i did just stand there and ignore her not saying anything it would be even worse and much more awkward , since we take a few classes together . 
  we just never had a chance to talk an get to know each other . 
  plus , when i see her again , i 'm sure gon na be more relaxed , since i ca n't really make more of an idiot of myself . 
  ** tldr **, 
  if you 're afraid of initiating conversations out of fear that they might go bad , do n't be !, 
  well , i do n't really feel bad for myself . 
  i was able to beat the addiction , that was a part of my life for 20 years . 
  that 's huge . 
  now i know , at least in this one compartment , where i want to be in my life and just to be clear it 's a place with no porn . 
  i am feeling good about myself . 
  i 've made a huge progress . 
  from no friends , a scary shell of a man , i moved to regularly going out with a cool bunch and actively approaching and meeting new people . 
  in these last couple of months i 've done things that i 've never done before . 
  things that for the most part of my life i was avoiding to do because i was scared or thought i was n't good or smart enough to do . 
  that 's what nofap is for me .
