  those were different cents , though ... 
  you do n't wan na know ... , 
  since the government moved to the left ... , 
  did n't know dubya was running ... 
   the murdered agent actually was likely killed by guns bought in the usa, 
  ... from the batfe ... look up `` project gunwalker '' you might learn something . 
  military grade viagra ... ? 
  i thought the bill of rights was added to the constitution precisely for the reason we would n't have to kiss the congresscritters ' asses and beg them to reconsider anytime they decide we have `` too much freedom '' ... 
  but then , what do i know ... 
   the suspect most clearly aims for the policeman . 
  actually , the suspect most clearly tries to avoid the spike strip . 
  so , we should be happy we have the opportunity to stuff our tongues into the congresscritter 's ass ? 
  rather , they consider it the manual ... 
  methinks it 's you who does n't . 
  it 's a bill of ** prohibitions ** for the federal government . 
  that means , they are prohibited fro doing stuff like this . 
  period . 
  no ass liking required . 
  the only shortcoming of bor is lack of enforcement clause . 
  something like : `` any government official , either elected or appointed , caught in an attempt to circumvent , disregard , contradict or overturn any provision of the first ten amendments , should be hanged by the neck till death . '', 
  the driver has seen the cop throwing down the spike strip . 
  he swerved left to avoid it , cop happened to be there . 
  now go back and watch the video again until you agree . 
  still , it 's possible op was one of the bystanders taking the photos ... 
  obviously , does n't diminish your awesomeness ... , 
  because the rest of the world was even more screwed up . 
  now they are leaving in droves , even with lower tax rates . 
  raise them and you will see ... 
  soviets collapsed for one reason : too many unproductive assholes deciding who should produce what , when and how . 
  us is heading the same direction from the slightly different angle . 
  the way i see it , the whole western civilization is slowly going to hell in a handbasket thanks to clueless `` progressives '' and equally clueless neocons . 
  sometimes i thing it would be better if you guys got all you wish for . 
  then it would be very fast and total collapse and we could start again from the ground up . 
  unfortunately it will probably just slowly rot out ... 
   most people pay their taxes without being forced to, 
  really ? 
  sure . 
  i 'm just saying we should n't need to kiss ass to prevent them from infringing ... 
  i do n't know how narrowly you define it . 
  do you really believe ( most ) people would pay their taxes if they would n't face irs action in case of non-payment ? 
  * we * do n't have a debt problem . 
  government has a debt problem . 
  we do have a government problem , though ... 
  why ? 
  murdoch is no longer a murdoch ... ? 
   ss has worked great for many decades . 
  as does any other ponzi scheme . 
  it always works great as long as the new suckers outnumber the old suckers . 
  then it goes kaboom ... 
  you are wasting your time . 
  chico is a dude who once seen the che t-shirt and thinks it makes him an expert on pretty much everything ... , 
  you do n't . 
  know your place , peasant ... , 
   fascist, 
  you keep using this word . 
  i do n't think it means what you think it means . 
  hate to break this to you but large parts of gulf of mexico are already under water ... 
  dunno ... if i detach my head to put it in my freezer i might have some problems taking the photo and uploading it ... , 
  economy of scale ftw . 
  politician lied !, 
  who could have thought ... 
  yes . 
   they were minding their own business and these armies came and kicked them for an unknown interest, 
  is n't that what 's actually happened ... ? 
   he 's upset because he realizes that his mistakes put both their lives in danger, 
  huh ? 
  how was his life ever in danger ? 
  because he did n't know the dude was ccw ? 
  how many cop shootings by ccws happen in us ? 
  what really scares me , there were some 600 people there , most of them young adults/adolescents . 
  yet ** one ** guy with a pistol could unleash such a mayhem with absolutely no resistance . 
  think about it : if just 10 % of them started throwing rocks at him the outcome could turn out much different . 
  you do understand that sheepdogs are there not to `` protect '' the sheep from big bad wolves , they are there to make sure sheep are n't running off and go to slaughterhouse without much fuss ... ? 
  stop it !, 
  you are confusing the dude ... , 
   commonly used in hunting , the so-called dum-dum bullets are lighter in weight and can be fired with greater accuracy over varying distances . 
  is it the onion ? 
  why do n't you get a hitler sticker and distribute it in brooklyn ... ? 
   the bullets are lighter in weight than fmj , because they have hollow points . 
  and they can often be used to shoot further accurately , because they 're loaded for hunting , while a lot of fmj is just cheap range fodder . 
  which , obviously , has nothing to do with them being lighter . 
  actually , everything else being equal , lighter bullets ( and hollow points ) tend to lead to less accuracy esp . 
  `` over varying distances '' . 
  well , hitler believed there was a `` jewish problem '' and he solved it by indiscriminately killing jews , sherman believed there was a `` southern problem '' and solved it by indiscriminately killing southerners ... other than that , you are right , there 's no similarity . 
  i know the politicians are a bunch of psychopaths and it does n't surprise me anymore they kill lotsa people . 
  this dude was not a politician , though . 
  b. . . b. . . but it 's for the children . 
  why do you hate children ... ? 
  i know . 
  we talk like faggots and our stuff is all retarded ... 
  ... assuming conventional chemical drive . 
  should be much easier with a fusion drive ... 
  you are right . 
  there 's nothing impossible about the fusion drive ... 
  i 'm pretty sure if we really wanted we could build one in the next 10 years . 
  actually , ramp_tram is right . 
  seems words have no meaning anymore . 
  the words ` courage ' and ` cowardice ' are nowadays used mainly to convey sympathy/antipathy . 
  this is not meant to diss the victims , i do n't know how i would react in their place , but to be called courageous you are ( or were in the olden days ) supposed to do something ... courageous . 
  hiding is not .
