  btw , i do n't know where did you get `` spraying auto fire in all directions '' from . 
  from what i can find on the net he had just an semi-auto pistol ... and , yes , there are examples of [ teenagers rushing a shooter ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thurston_high_school_shooting#the_shooting_at_thurston_high_school ) , they can be called courageous ... 
  if that 's the case , they were courageous , but not very bright ... did they ask him to sit down and sing kumbaya with them too ... ? 
  18/20 misspelled vietnamese and never heard of gujarati ( sp ? ), 
  so , why do n't you do humanity a favor and give a blow-job to shotgun ... ? 
   bunch of people who hated the government because it was the government, 
  seems like a good reason to me . 
  it still would be a good start ... 
  how is that relevant ? 
  also , if the person you are supposed to help dies because you did n't risk your life , how were you `` of help ? '', 
  difference being , if gm makes lousy cars we can buy nissans instead . 
  how would it work out if we had to buy the brand that won elections ? 
  the fox guarding the hen house ... ? 
   it 's made by the people, 
  yes . 
  some people . 
  for the same people . 
  with their own interests . 
  why do statists always assume that , somehow , people that work for the government and `` create '' laws and regulations will have the same interests as the rest of the peons ? 
  ever seen a bureaucrat deciding his job is not needed anymore and dismantling his agency ? 
   statism have been tried . 
  it does n't work very well since it only enables smaller much less well functioning systems of control/distribution/division of labour . 
  ftfy, 
   '' `` antisemite '' = someone zionists do n't like . '', 
  can mean that the word antisemite does n't mean jewhater , it only means that that person is disliked by a zionist . 
  this is false . 
  there are actual jewhaters out there , those are real antisemitists . 
  logic 101 needs your attention !, 
  as you aptly observed zionists do n't like jew haters . 
  that means that if the definition of antisemite is `` someone zionists do n't like '' it would include actual jew haters as well ... 
   i was suspicious the moment i saw the term `` zionists '', 
  why ? 
  do you believe zionists do n't exist ? 
  you are missing the point . 
  the cars are mostly good because if someone makes a lousy one people are going to buy from the competitors . 
  there 's no such pressure on the government . 
  short of armed revolution , there 's really no effective `` pressure '' mechanism . 
  yes , you can write an angry letter to your congresscritter , how much pressure is that comparing to corporate donations and the promise of a place on the board of directors on retirement ... ? 
  hmm ... would `` continuous support elections '' work for the cars ? 
  everybody buys gm unless we vote for toyota ... 
  dunno ... if he did n't use derogatory word but , instead , named some people \\ institution \\ philosophy known for race baiting , and i was not aware of his membership in a racist organization ... 
  i do n't know why either ... 
  obviously , she is a cat ... 
  yup . 
  and citizens of soviet union ate bread baked by government bakeries . 
  that , obviously , proves you can not have bread if government is not baking it . 
  apparently , the psychopaths have the uncanny ability to sense each other . 
  would n't surprise me bush was right ... 
  nothing can convince statists . 
  it 's like religion to them ... 
  good for you . 
  ( i mean seeing the light , not being statist  but you are a rare exception ... 
  in my case it 's because i like punching holes in paper targets . 
  also because i fucking can ... , 
  that so ? 
  how come [ katakana ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/katakana#table_of_katakana ) has symbols for ra , ri , ru , re , ro but no symbols for la , li , lu , le , lo ... ? 
  you have symbols for stuff yo can not pronounce but not for stuff you can ? 
  you have absolutely no idea what are you talking about , do you . 
  when you quote somebody ( einstein in this case ) it 's polite to indicate who is the author of the citation ... 
  ic - icy ... 
   isps only have to remember your ip for 18 months , something some isps do already, 
  ... and since nsa already keeps track of all internet traffic , that 's all they need ... 
  there are different `` understandings . '', 
  you might understand ** what ** the system does but not understand ** how ** it does it ... 
   but good cops want to protect people, 
  all three of them ? 
   think don fanucci was the building inspector, 
  if it quacks like a duck ... 
  how ? 
  ... and fining him for littering , and tazering him just for kicks ... 
  and you know unicorns do not exist how ? 
  citation ? 
   the two massive towers falling down in the centre on ny because planes were flown into them was kind of a big clue that there were terrorists out there . 
  ... or they could be a big clue that [ pnac ] ( http://www.newamericancentury.org/ ) managed to orchestrate their `` catalyzing event '' ... 
   dont presume that you somehow have the inside knowledge that the rest of us are too blind to see . 
  you do n't have to have any `` inside knowledge '' , all you need is some common sense to figure out the official story is simply too ridiculous to even consider ... you really have to be willfully blind to believe it . 
  it 's a thingie which when combined with proton creates lotsa energy ( as gamma radiation ) and disappears ... 
  nope . 
  government is a racket . 
  well , we are also the evolutionary outcome ... 
  we might not understand the word you are sayin ' but we sure can shoot ... 
  so , violence against men is ok ? 
  all fiction is `` speculative , '' that 's what makes it fiction ...

   and because we 're america , we have the obligation to go protect it for them .
