   there are other reasons to having military bases around the world, 
  perhaps it would help if you realized that there 's some 196 countries in the world but only us has `` military bases around the world '' ... do you insist the remaining 195 countries are all isolationist ? 
  yes , it quite difficult to see if you take into account that the towers were designed to withstand such an impact ... 
  you are feeding the troll ... 
   not to mention ever single highrise structural engineer in the past 10 years has been asked about this and they do n't agree with truther theories either .

  but as a president he could n't do anything about it other than appointing scotus justices ... which would n't really be amongst his most important criteria ... otoh he can withdraw the troops from all over the world right away . 
  he can also instruct the federal prosecutors to refrain from prosecution of ( non violent ) drug offenders and pardon those that are already incarcerated . 
  you are talking to yourself , are n't you . 
  about as much as you do ... 
  ... not to mention there 's no protection against your checks bouncing because of some fraudulent transaction ... 
  uhmm ... looks like you are not entirely unbiased here ... 
   even if you leave , you still have to pay taxes,

  what i mean is ( according to the bible ) the daughters got him drunk and fucked him without his consent ... so , you sounded kinda like the mainstream media ... ,

  incidentally , ** income ** tax has a perverse tendency to help the disparity ** grow ** ... confused ? 
  see , income tax is affecting people who have a high income not the `` super rich . '', 
  so dude like warren buffet can call for higher income tax because he is already loaded . 
  high income tax will prevent people with high income to accumulate the dough but it is not touching ** his ** dough ... iow the next zuckerberg will have to fork most of his newly acquired dough to the irs and warren is gon na stay at the top . 
   possesive should have an apostrophe, 
  because if we do n't aipac will elect bachmann ... , 
  hell , grab the pitchfork anyway ... , 
  you 've almost got it ... but he could pardon all non-violent drug offenders and instruct federal prosecutors not to prosecute new ones . 
  as for education : [ us dept. 
  of education ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_department_of_education ) did n't even exist before 1980 ... do you really believe our education is better now ... ? 
  b. . . b. . . but the are ** all ** guilty , they elected hamas !, 
  his brother is in prison and he is a mafia hitman ... ?

  it depends on what you believe on a free will . 
  if we have free will and free will is necessary for cognition/consciousness then it 's pretty obvious ( digital ) computers can not achieve it , being deterministic ... 
  randomness does not non-determinism make ... 
  observe that for your random-driven program , i can write one completely deterministic simply by running your program for all possible permutations of your ( random ) input bits ... 
  hmm ... since our experience with catalytic methane combustion shows no irregularities which could be attributed to the presence of free will in methane molecules , using ockham 's razor we can safely disregard the possibility . 
  not so with humans ... 
  guess it shows he is more power-hungry than bush ... 
   they label us as the `` zionist occupiers '', 
  so , why israelis surround their children with zionist occupiers ... ? 
  you seem to reverse the argument ... free will is something that can be ( and has been ) argued without considering the problem of computability of consciousness , what i said is : `` if free will exists and consciousness depends on it then it can not be computable . '', 
  now you somehow argue as if i said the free will is proven by our inability ( so far ) to compute consciousness ... 
  you are missing the point : if i go ( deterministically ) through all permutations , i will go through your randomly selected one ... 
  are you suggesting we are better at predicting the action of the human ? 
  spazzm 's device might or might not be non-deterministic but his insistence that feeding his device 's output to my program input makes my program non-deterministic is false . 
  i show it by creating a derived program that computes the outputs for all possible inputs , including whatever his device might throw at me ... 
  well , since we can not possibly ask the methane molecule if it has a free will we are probably better off assuming it does n't . 
  we can ask the human the same question and the answer very often is `` yes '' ... perhaps that 's a good enough reason to at least consider the possibility . 
  randomness is still `` statistically deterministic . '', 
  ferinstance , if you get the certain amount of u235 and hold it for 700 million years , you know half of it will decay ... even though the decay of the particular atom might not be predictable , the behavior of the bulk of them is . 
  real non-determinism would preclude such predictions ... 
  as soon as you statists move to sudan ... 
  nope , he is actually suggesting the people who can become his competitors pay their `` fair '' share ... he already has his billions , he is not suggesting the tax on net worth but the tax on income . 
  iow he does n't want the next zuckerberg to catch up with him ... 
  we have to keep killing brown people and incarcerating potheads just to avoid a terrible possibility he might appoint a justice that might be against roe v wade !, 
  i guess killing brown people if funny to you too ... between his stance on the wars and the war on drugs i do n't see any issue that could matter at this point . 
  so as long as you are allowed to abort your fetus , it 's ok to kill some brown dudes in faraway lands ... 
  so , the things he can not do anything about , even if he wanted , matter more to you than some brown dudes overseas ... how many dead brown people is ok ? 
  funny how he is giving the money away to the ** charitable foundation ** not to the government ... guess he does n't want ** his ** money to be misused ... 
  whatever he intends to do with his money , the fact remains income tax is not taxing the rich , it 's taxing the contenders ... iow raising the bar fort entrance to the club .

   are you implying that indian people keep cows as pets ? 
  were you implying the only reason people keep domesticated animals is for meat ? 
  there are different reasons . 
  different for different people and different animals . 
  one of the most common religions in india considers cows to be sacred . 
  as good a reason to keep them around as any ...
