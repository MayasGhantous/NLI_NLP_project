  i did n't say anything for i was n't a conspiracy wacko ... '', 
  interesting ... there was no income tax before 1913 , still people seemed to , by some unexplained miracle , have all the things you have listed ... how was that possible ?!!, 
  seems to me he was mainly complaining about income tax , but i could be wrong . 
  anyway , you seemed to be saying ** all ** we paying for the government is necessary to get all those things you have listed . 
  how do you explain , then , the necessity of the income tax ... ? 
  how come our grandparents could have all the things you have listed without paying through the nose ? 
  you are not suggesting the duties and excise taxes were as much burden to them as the income tax is to us , are you . 
  should be pretty obvious the demand curve in any particular business is `` stepped '' . 
  but in the economy as a whole it evens out to the smooth curve . 
   and the comments here are not only stupid but anti-intellectual . 
  including this one ? 
  why would you even consider posting anything in / r/politics ... ? 
  there 's nothing brave about posting in / r/politics either ... but it 's an exercise in futility . 
  so , whom did they forget to pay off ... ? 
  it would n't be the first time dead dude won an election ... 
   jonathan pollard was not an israel spy . 
  israel certainly put a lot of [ effort ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jonathan_pollard ) into advocacy for `` not an israel spy '' ... 
   israel granted pollard citizenship in 1995 , while publicly denying , until 1998 , that he was an israeli spy . 
  [ 1 ] israeli activist groups , as well as high-profile israeli politicians , have lobbied for his release . 
  [ 2 ] israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has voiced particularly strong support for pollard , visiting the convicted spy in prison in 2002 . 
   it will collapse under its own weight , no action needed . 
  the most likely possibility ... otherwise known as shtf scenario . 
  do you believe that if nazis abolished gestapo they would n't have been evil anymore ... ? 
  you are incredibly naive for an old dude ... when the politicians are worth buying there will always be buyers . 
  you can not stop trade by prohibiting it - did n't work for alcohol , does n't work for marijuana , will not work for political favors . 
  dude seems to believe the main ( only ? ), 
  reason for having a gun is self defense or crime deterrence . 
  using some ass-backwards assumptions about the reason of owning a muscle car , i could easily `` prove '' that having a vintage muscle car `` the evidence indicates the costs will widely outweigh the benefits . '', 
  catch-22 : if you can figure out the paperwork you can not be crazy ... , 
  why ? 
  at least they are honest ... 
  affects, 
  hmmm ... starving person will `` say , do , or pay anything to make the hunger go away . '', 
  do we need universal soup kitchens as well ? 
  we have the `` universal health care '' already as well . 
  it 's called medicaid and hospital emergency ... 
  we call it medicaid . 
  he was already a governor , did n't help him much ... :(, 
  who is that `` we '' you 're talking about ? 
   the authors of the constitution never dreamed the document could be interpreted to say the federal government had any business issuing money, 
  article 1 section 8 :, 
   the congress shall have power [ ... ] to coin money , regulate the value thereof , and of foreign coin , and fix the standard of weights and measures ;, 
  `` it 's not important who votes , it 's important who counts the votes ... '', 
  _ josip vissarionovitsch dugashvili _, 
  so , because he thinks abortion is murder ( and has really no chance of doing anything about it , even if he wanted to ) we must vote for someone who will keep killing brown people in faraway lands and jailing potheads . 
  glad to know you have your priorities straight - they are only some brown furriners and potheads , who cares about them ... 
  if i am not mistaken all of your presidents so far were christian and all the other candidates are as well ... what does it say about your sanity ? 
  by attacking the only one candidate who is ** against ** wars on brown people and some drugs , you do endorse all the others . 
  out of all the candidates you chose to attack one . 
  presumably , you hope it will convince some people not to vote for that candidate . 
  that means they either vote for some other candidate or abstain altogether . 
  that means the chances of some other candidate being elected improve . 
  now , since all the other candidates are known to support killing brown people and jailing potheads , you are acting towards precisely that outcome . 
  ... or , perhaps , it was something insignificant and he really does n't remember ... 
  so , what were they doing the hour before ? 
  waiting for a change from a penny ? 
  for the children \u2122 . 
   killing him saves us money . 
  that would be the case in all prosecutions . 
  why do n't we just dispose of the `` jury of your peers '' bullshit ? 
  hey guys , herbertsnow is a serial killer and a child molester . 
  let 's string him up !, 
  that 's the gist of it ... 
   the politician is a terrible person, 
  no ifs about it ... , 
   it left out that charles mayo was president of the ama . 
  so , he was a hypocrite , i guess ... happens in the best of families . 
   risking a military conflict over an apology is not ill-considered in your book ? 
  risking a military conflict only if israel attacks the aid ships ... so it would be really israel that starts the conflict , would n't it . 
  what does the apology have to do with it ? 
   they had no plans on docking and fully expected to be boarded by the idf . 
  you mean the israelis knew the aid could never reach gaza and attacked the ship anyways , just for shits and giggles ... ? 
  is n't a blockade itself an act of war ... ? 
  perhaps if you cared to read tfa you could guess ... 
  you bought a single cartridge ... ? 
  they were mostly saudi ( or so the official story goes ) - they were paying [ much less ] ( http://money.cnn.com/pf/features/lists/global_gasprices/ ) ... 
  that it does . 
  still it does not surplus make ... 
   there were budget surpluses that were decreasing the total debt the us had for three years in a row, 
  so , you will have no trouble pointing out which [ years was that ] ( http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt.htm ) ... 
  if there was a budget surplus for three years the total debt would ** decrease ** for the same three years ... 
  you can not be correct . 
  there were no jokes before the internet . 
  and why should n't it be more expensive ? 
  why it 's ok for sewage and water to be more expensive in rural areas but not mail ? 
  how do you decide which services require to be `` equalized '' and which do not ? 
  chomsky being jewish i think you meant `` self hating jew . '', 
  at least that 's the usual label ... 
   you look retarded, 
  i 'm not sure it 's just looks ... , 
  is that an offer ... ? 
  yeah !, 
  the fucker boarded the israeli vessel and started attacking israeli sailors !, 
  you mean you 've been oppressed for so long you figured out now is your turn to oppress ... ? 
   i do n't agree with ron paul on most of his views , especially those that rely on the benevolence of market forces . 
  hmmm ... 
   it is not from the benevolence of the butcher , the brewer , or the baker that we expect our dinner, 
  _ adam smith _, 
  well , quite obviously , the shrub regime did n't exactly advertise the fact . 
  the reason for bush invading iraq is known only to dubya himself .
