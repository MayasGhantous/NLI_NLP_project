  to demands `` fly into the building , '' no . 
  is there any one instance of pilots willingly relinquishing the controls of the plane to the hijackers ? 
  did n't think so . 
  the real question is why you need google to find your dick ... 
  ... and 51 % of americans are not paying attention ... 
  you do n't seem to understand the fundamental difference between flying to a destination chosen by a hijacker and giving a hijacker control of the plane . 
  first scenario does n't really endanger the plane that much , the second is pretty much a straight path to disaster - the pilot does n't know what the hijackers ' plans are or if they can fly the plane at all . 
  at that point the pilot has no other option but to assume they are all dead already anyway ... 
  what 's `` a first country ? '', 
  and only us ever nuked anybody ... 
  hey , the south african apartheid was just `` protecting whites from black criminals '' too ... 
  it 's still rude ... 
  so , basically , she is saying : '' massah , built the hut you live in , he provides the meals and clothes for you , he even sends the doctor ( or a vet , as it might be ) when you or your child gets sick , he makes sure no bandit is gon na rob you of the things he lets you keep . 
  so , stop whining , nigga , there 's cotton that needs picking ... '', 
  so , all you need is to stamp random ( or rather carefully placed ) noise onto the number before applying the file ... 
  plausible deniability ... 
  you sure about that ? 
  try refusing to pay taxes and it 's not unlikely some forced sex will be part of your future ... 
  first they would have to prove it ended up in the microwave ... , 
  `` hey , i have no idea what happened to the chip ... you mean the chip is not working ? 
  weird ! '', 
  he wants us to stop bombing brown people !, 
  is n't that crazy ? 
  oh , so some tea party dudes do n't believe obama 's birth cert is legit . 
  that , according to you and some actor , makes the whole tea party movement racist . 
  now , some democratic party congresscritter believes [ guam is in danger of capsizing ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oxuqwpd1wa ) ... guess that makes the whole democratic party bunch of blabbering morons ... ? 
   he wants to get rid of public education, 
  he wants to get rid of [ department of education ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_department_of_education ) ... which did not exist before 1980 . 
  til there was no public education in us before 1980 . 
   this is the one time we were so ahead of the curve than the rest of the world had to jump on the bandwagon , but it was too late . 
  not only your knowledge of the history is lacking , your google-fu [ seems to be pretty weak ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/compulsory_education#history ) as well ... 
   why should parents pay for it out of pocket ? 
  perhaps because `` education expenses are an investment in our future ? '', 
  so , who ate whom ? 
  you are willing to help , are n't you . 
  so are other people . 
   it means everyone acts like an adult and shares the thing they 've built together, 
  iow , they do n't own it , they just have permission to use it ... 
  if my mechanic tries to screw me over , i will go to the different one . 
  my government ** is ** screwing me over and i 'm stuck with it . 
  and no , voting is not an improvement , i 'm stuck with the government other people voted for ... 
   people are n't bad , they 're simply self serving, 
  ... and that goes for the people in government too ... 
   entity needs to set the standard so we do n't have 90 different electrical outlets, 
  i knew it !, 
  we need the government to standardize us on the single computer architecture and operating system !, 
   with no government at all , the biggest , strongest warlord rules, 
  iow , government ? 
  so , explain this to me : we need government because without it we would end up having government ? 
  btw , even with `` the biggest , strongest warlord '' you still have a vote ... from the rooftops . 
  `` if people are good we do n't need a government , if people are evil we do n't dare to have one . '', 
  so , they pay taxes to get what they are `` too lazy to do '' and they are entitled to it because they pay taxes ... ? 
   most americans want government, 
  you mean `` most americans were indoctrinated into thinking they need government '' ... 
  so , what is the government can do that we can not do without it ? 
  ( bombing brown people excluded ), 
  but that 's the reality . 
   how is `` government '' different from `` we '', 
  government is a subset of `` we '' that earn their living by [ political means ] ( http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3ftitle=1662&amp;chapter=36963&amp;layout=html&amp;itemid=27 ) while the rest of `` we '' earn our living by economical means . 
  they also claim special powers and privileges the rest of `` we '' do n't have . 
  ok , to make it clear , the reason they pay taxes is because they are entitled and the reason they are entitled is because they pay taxes ? 
  does n't it smell like circular logic to you ? 
   i gave dsl modems as a prime example , internet has to be supported with public funds and if left to their own devices industry will develop competing standards if only to lock in a market for themselves . 
  this has a tangible , difficult to change effect in the infrastructure that is built throughout the country . 
  an electrical outlet is n't difficult to change , internet backbones are . 
  ftfy ... or rather it makes as much sense as your argument . 
  that means none whatsoever . 
  yup . 
  but mechanics can not sent the swat team if i do n't want their services . 
  oh , so you do n't see the difference between `` can have '' and `` is entitled to ? '', 
  unbiased news source : source with the bias i share . 
  poor brokensys ... did you find out already that girls poop ... ? 
   a strictly limited government that protects individual liberty, 
  and who is gon na be `` strictly limiting '' the government ? 
  seems like the us constitution was designed for that , with no apparent success ... 
   `` and how we burned in the camps later , thinking : what would things have been like if every security operative , when he went out at night to make an arrest , had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say good-bye to his family ? 
  or if , during periods of mass arrests , as for example in leningrad , when they arrested a quarter of the entire city , people had not simply sat there in their lairs , paling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase , but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes , hammers , pokers , or whatever else was at hand ? ... 
  the organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and , notwithstanding all of stalin 's thirst , the cursed machine would have ground to a halt !, 
  if ... if ... we did n't love freedom enough . 
  and even more -- we had no awareness of the real situation ... we purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterward . '', 
   when we have a totalitarian-authoritarian regime led by a stalin-like dictator that starts imprisoning 1/4s of cities and sending them to gulags , believe me , i will be ready to fight . 
  believe me , it 's gon na be way too late then . 
   actually , the us constitution has had some success , especially in times past , so it is n't fair to say `` with no apparent success . '', 
  ok . make it `` with no apparent long-term success . '', 
  but , in reality , it started failing at the time of whiskey rebellion ... 
   and it might even come to pass that we start obeying the constitution again . 
  it sure would be nice ... 
  i wo n't hold my breath , though . 
  the point is that `` countering excessive police brutality with more violence only justifies their actions '' attitude just enables the regime to squeeze even tighter , at some point you end up in the situation when it 's too late to fight back ... 
  observe that solzhenitsyn only expressed wishes that never really materialized - it was too late ... 
  you might ( or might not ) be familiar with claire wolfe 's quote :, 
   america is at that awkward stage ; it 's too late to work within the system , but too early to shoot the bastards . 
  i am afraid it might be already too late . 
   insisting his birth cert is fake because he 's brown is racist . 
  never heard anybody insisting his birth cert was fake because he was brown . 
  people who insist it was fake do that because his grandmother said in an interview she was present at his birth in mumbai ... 
   also even if he were born outside the us he would still be a ` natural born citizen ' ( read the fucking constitution , i 'm not even american and i know that shit ), 
  [ no , ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/birthright_citizenship_in_the_united_states#statute.2c_by_parentage ) [ you do n't ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/citizenship_in_the_united_states#birthright_citizenship ), 
   now , lets say that if 75 % of democrats were not bumbling morons , they would easily laugh and scorn the morons , which they far outnumber , clear out of the party . 
  this has n't happened , therefore at least 25 % of the democratic party is retarded .
