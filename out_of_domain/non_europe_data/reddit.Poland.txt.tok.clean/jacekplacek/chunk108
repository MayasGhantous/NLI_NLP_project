  ftfy, 
   but then you would have to drop the local taxes as well . 
  that would be the plan ... , 
  he is simply listing our dear leader 's accomplishments ... you should be already familiar with them . 
  unless you are willfully blind ... 
  you should really work on your reading comprehension skills . 
  since his father was neither us citizen nor us national that would require you to show that, 
   the u.s. citizen parent has been `` physically present '' [ 6 ] in the u.s. before the child 's birth for a total period of at least five years , and, 
   at least two of those five years were after the u.s. citizen parent 's fourteenth birthday . 
  and even if that was shown , it would still make him just a `` citizen , '' not necessary `` natural born '' ... definition of which is pretty vague . 
  sure . 
  how many moonshine cartels do you know ? 
  when was the last time you heard about moonshine gang wars ? 
   they know when it 's legalized a company running on a larger scale will just squeeze them out . 
  not necessary . 
  but their profit margins will diminish considerably . 
  he is `` the mole '' . 
  let 's see ... not every child is destined for college/white collar job . 
  with child labor laws/mandatory education ( s ) he has to waste time attending high school and not getting any benefit from it , possibly even getting into bad company and turning into a criminal . 
  without those laws s ( he ) could go to work as an apprentice somewhere and learn useful skills . 
  he is killing the guys he says are bad . 
  besides , [ this dude ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/23/whitey-bulger-arrested-in_n_882728.html#s296735 ) is , arguably , pretty bad guy too . 
  would you feel the same way if he was assassinated by obama ? 
   a man who had a possibility of being innocent, 
  he also was afforded the trial by the jury of his peers . 
  and several years of appeals ... 
   world-wide known , self-avowed terrorist and leader of jihad against the great satan america, 
  ... if there 's evidence for that it would be very easy to convict him , if there is no evidence , he as well might be just a braggart ... 
   attending high school is beneficial to pretty much everyone and is more likely to keep kids out of trouble than in it . 
  this does not [ seem to be the case ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/literacy_in_the_united_states#the_national_institute_for_literacy ) everywhere ... 
  they would say that , would n't they . 
  i think it 's more of a case of students just not being really interested in the school ... even if they were forced to attend , they most likely would n't really get much out of it anyways . 
  dunno , it seems to me it 's more of not really getting what the goal of the protest is . 
  it 's something i 've been wondering about . 
  even though i am sympathetic ... 
  we are idiocracy . 
  hey , i 'm a gun nut and i resent that . 
  nope , he says potato you say tomato ... 
  dunno ... you think it would be an overkill when invaded by your friendly swat team ... ? 
  common usage where ? 
  you are assuming all swat teams are really professional ... that 's does n't seem to [ always be the case ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xp0f00_jmak ) ... 
  i can easily imagine guerena , if he wanted to , could really decimate this bunch of wannabes . 
  < shrug /  ... so what do you say when you want to say `` clip ? '', 
   it 's all c # , silverlight , and xaml . 
  is n't microsoft dropping silverlight already ? 
   good leadership can exist , you see proof of this everyday . 
  in government ? 
  you do n't know that . 
  he might be a ( schizophrenic ) zombie ... , 
   otherwise you would be considered an unlawful combatant and therefore the geneva convention does not protect you . 
  ... and you are supposed to be treated according to the criminal laws instead . 
  bush did invent the new category of non-persons and decreed he can do with them as he wishes . 
  obama is no better . 
  he joined a foreign army ? 
  your beloved ann coulter once called to nuke the aye-rabs ... should she be next ? 
  ... unless the army in question spells `` idf '' ... 
  you mean yasser arafat , shimon peres and yitzhak rabin ... 
   spain ca n't assassinate cheney for his crimes, 
   a known terrorist . 
  known to whom ? 
  for what we know , he was just an al-q 's limbaugh ... 
  really ? 
  is n't glen beck obama 's `` known enemy ? '', 
  should he expect the drone soon ... ? 
  unfortunately , that 's how the republics end ... we did n't even last as long as rome , the rubicon has been crossed :(, 
  and , as they did back then , the masses are mostly cheering . 
  but you want to achieve some goal , do n't you . 
  * the wall street can not legalize dope , you should protest the congress . 
  * the wall street can not forgive student loans either , you should protest your banker . 
  * ok , you are sticking it up to the man . 
  but does he feel the pain ? 
  * anarchy is a system , what you have is bunch of protesters . 
  * i want a pony . 
  will it help me to get one ? 
   `` sex is very difficult in zero gravity , apparently , because you have no traction and you keep bumping against the walls , '' andreadis said . 
  `` think about it : you have no friction , you have no resistance . '', 
  athena , darling - you have no imagination ... , 
  i knew a phd dude who worked as a janitor ... 
  it 's kinda sad you guys have absolutely no fucking idea how this country works . 
  president can not possibly do any of those things . 
  period . 
  it takes a congress to change legislation . 
  as a commander-in-chief he can end the wars , though , and bring the troops back home . 
  he could also instruct the federal attorneys not to prosecute federal drug cases and pardon federal drug offenders . 
  the only way he could affect roe vs wade would be to appoint enough scotus justices to overturn it . 
  not fucking likely to ever happen . 
  but it 's much more easy just to herp-derp ohmygod !, 
  he will ban abortions !, 
  he will bring back slavery !, 
  he will start the inquisition !, 
  yup . 
  he was a russian immigrant with phd in physics , could n't find other job . 
  hurrah !, 
  we are not as bad as north korea !, 
  how hard would it be to test the fucking tree and left her alone if it 's not infected ? 
  there 's 404 stars ? 
   profiles of people you follow and your shared interests appear next to emails from them, 
  hmmm ... do i really want my boss to know how much porn i watch ... ? 
   literally said he wants to stab cops in their spines, 
  nope .
