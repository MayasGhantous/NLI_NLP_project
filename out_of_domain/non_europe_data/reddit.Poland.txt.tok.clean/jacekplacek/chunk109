  he literally said `` a knife to the spine always beats saliva in the face '' . . 
  let 's do an experiment - next time you go to work get the mace with you and mace random customer , see if you will be `` investigated if you should get fired '' or escorted out of premises on the spot . 
  please report back . 
  iow , he has no control over the police ... 
  hmmm ... `` after two years of attacking tea party protests and dismissing their cause as `` redneck racism , '' r/politics promotes the wall street protest and defends it as citizens rights to protest . '', 
  this stick seems to have two ends ... , 
  is delaware a new poland ? 
  next time you hear about taxing the rich remember , you are one ... , 
  depends on the russian in question ... part of russia is still in europe , check it out . 
   `` oriental '' is used to describe an object, 
  [ _ citation needed _ ], 
  apparently the asians themselves did n't usually mind too much , it was the pc white crowd that made the most noise ... 
  yup . 
  also heard of the `` russian doll , '' you mean i can not use `` russian '' to describe a person now ? 
  [ _ citation needed _ ], 
  `` nobody could ever need more than 32gb ... '', 
  ... that 's according to people who want to appear super-pc ... 
   i do n't know why you guys stand up for them, 
  you should , it 's always `` herp-derp need moar regulation ... '', 
   if the government is helping to pay for these companies to run , they should also own part of these companies, 
  oh , they do . 
  and when they retire from political offices they are rewarded with sits on those companies ' boards ... 
   he 's wrong on his more government advocacy, 
  the government is bought by the banksters , obviously we need more government !, 
  it involves us ** and ** israel ... 
  hmm ... and soros and buffet try hard to promote the left , they just do n't have good arguments on their side ... , 
  it 's been that way for a looooong time ... where have you been ? 
  ... you cheer for cheerleaders ... 
   if he had a shred of integrity he would n't be working for fox, 
  if he had a shred of integrity he would n't be working for any mainstream media ... but then nobody would hear of him . 
  ... and would push food prices higher and push more people into poverty ... 
  somehow i doubt it ... there were times the new language popped up every second day . 
  hey , i did one in college too , not very likely you 'd ever run into it 's spec , 
  he did n't get demoted , he retired and is moonlighting as a cop ... 
  funny that , tea party was taken over by republicans now ows is being taken over by democrats ... 
  i 'd rather see them getting tax breaks for every sexual ( male ) partner ... , 
   i dont see you giving any posts about the fogel family murder , a palastinians man who killed 3 babys and their parents in their sleep ( 2009 ), 
  did he get acquitted ... ? 
  what keeps you from moving ? 
  in every poll , winning dude 's supporters `` inflate the results '' ... 
  what are `` the real polls ? '', 
  the ones that count only the elderly and technically illiterate folks ? 
  ( those who still have land lines ), 
   i do n't think i 've ever heard an economist blame government policy, 
  why would the bite the hand that feeds them ... ? 
   sympathetic to white supremacists and antisemites, 
  translation : he likes ron paul and does n't suck up to the israel apologists ... 
   every economist in the country, 
  no , i mean the economists you mean , those that you never heard blame government policy ... 
  there 's plenty of economists who do blame the government policies , you just never hear them out . 
  no , he knows the plot is fake because '' _ for the entire operation , the government 's confidential sources were monitored and guided by federal law enforcement agents _ '' ... iow it really was a `` federal law enforcement 's '' plot . 
  i am pretty sure if you could point to the dude who killed the israeli child and got acquitted , you would get some respect here too ... 
   jews already lived in the area of israel before it became a state . 
  land was also bought by jews continuously, 
  cool . 
  so , let 's say , mexicans lived in texas before it become the state . 
  now it will only take some more mexicans to buy more land in texas and they can claim it ( texas ) as their own ? 
  yup . 
  you could be too . 
  does it mean i can shoot you when i see you ? 
  nope , better send it to his campaign . 
  nope . 
  it means you can only ** give ** someone a vote , not ** take ** it from them . 
  iow no taxes . 
  canadian bacon ftw . 
  ( s ) he aimed for 152 but got bored ... 
  you really think congress would declare war over dubya 's arrest ? 
  or obama would go to war unilaterally ? 
  says who ? 
  does n't mean you can not be embarrassing ... 
   because we do n't want the world to think they can abduct our current and former president, 
  it 's called an arrest for a reason . 
  do you believe if ex-president strangled a hooker in canada they could n't arrest him ? 
   if north korea invited the south korean leader and arrested him , what would that be called ? 
  or is that a trick question ? 
  ok , can you point to any law on the books in us that would suggest such response ? 
  this is a sign of more things to come no matter who 's elected . 
  and no , i do n't think ron paul or gary johnson have a snowball in hell chance ... 
  as opposed to sudan ? 
  no , because elections are rigged for the establishment . 
  oh , so all ex us presidents can go abroad and strangle hookers without repercussions ? 
   it is about the precedent of the us allowing a foreign country to take , without consent , a former us president for any reason . 
  that will never be allowed to happen . 
   i know you are mad, 
  you do ? 
  policemen should n't be . 
  you like donkey meat gyros ? 
  you seem to be the only one getting what this is all about ... 
  i know . 
  that 's my brother 's birthday ... , 
   but i think what they want is for government to acknowledge that it is broken and begin to look for a solution . 
  hmmm ... problems created by ( too big ) governments , and the same governments are to be looking for a solution . 
  wan na bet the solution will be `` bigger governments '' ? 
  oh , so with general welfare clause and the commerce clause government can do anything they pretty damn well want ... why bother with the rest of the constitution , then ... ? 
   but are you willing to give up other federal laws that rely on an extended interpretation of the commerce clause, 
  let me rephrase that : are you willing to give the federal government unlimited power , hoping they will only use it for the things you like ? 
  got it . 
  there 's no `` the right to eat bacon shall not be infringed '' either . 
  does it mean government can prohibit bacon ? 
  what about apple pie ?
