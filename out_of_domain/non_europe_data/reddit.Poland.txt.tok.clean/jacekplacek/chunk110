  fast flying chunk of neutronium ... ? 
  depends what it was made of . 
   the poorest people in the u.s. today are living far better than the richest people did a couple centuries ago . 
  [ is that so ? 
  ] ( http://dailyphalanx.blogspot.com/2011/06/homeless-man-found-deceased-across.html ), 
  they are n't ? 
  can you take part in my experiment ? 
  i 'm looking for volunteers to stop paying taxes and refuse to submit to resulting arrests . 
  that will prove to those pesky libertarians it 's not `` forced at the gunpoint . '', 
   making us ` feel good ' should n't be the intended goal of social welfare programs, 
  how are `` social welfare programs '' anything but feel good measures , giving people the nice fuzzy feelings without them taking any responsibility for the problem ? 
  so , how is that ? 
  either people are generous and ( through their representatives ) want to contribute to the good causes or they are selfish and would not contribute if not forced at gunpoint . 
  make up your mind . 
   a proper farmer takes care of his cattle , that is how civilized farms work . 
  ftfy, 
   when do the guns come into play ? 
  ask wesley snipes . 
   armed revolution is the only way for the majority to decimate the tyranny of the minority . 
  just make sure you remember danton ... 
  but if the people are selfish and do n't willingly contribute that means the government is not following people 's will , does n't it . 
  i guess you are ok with being treated as cattle ... 
   they gave me a fine . 
  the fine did not have a gun in it . 
  only because you 've paid it ... next time refuse to pay and refuse to give up whatever they will try to confiscate . 
  report the result . 
   i 'm looking for volunteers to stop using any public resources . 
  sure . 
  if you can arrange with irs to stop collecting my taxes ... 
   welsey snipes attempted to willfully defraud the irs, 
  he did ? 
  how did he do that ? 
  promised them something for money they paid him and did n't deliver ? 
  nope . 
  everything past the first sentence was just an explanation why you have nice fuzzy feelings ... 
  iow : `` bend over , bitch , we all do ... '', 
  yup . 
  and the owner of the pizzeria in bronx could always open it somewhere in the appalachians where the mafia does n't collect protection fees ... 
  funny how the statists never comprehend the difference between choosing to support the business and being forced at gunpoint to support the government ... 
  run that by me again : the government is `` actually following the people 's will '' by ** forcing ** people to contribute when they do n't do it voluntarily ? 
  '' _ democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard . _ '', 
   oh , so it sounds like a whole chain of events has to come into play before a gun even hypothetically appears ? 
  sure . 
  same with the mafia . 
  if you do n't pay for your `` protection , '' there 's a `` chain of events '' before they give you concrete shoes ... 
   the mafia operates outside the law, 
  absolutely not . 
  they have their own laws . 
   the govt operates within the law, 
  ... they write themselves ... 
  if something is good you do n't have to be forced into it ... `` some people '' just see that forcing others to do as you want is `` bad '' and that `` every government '' does it . 
  yes ? 
  and who do you think writes the laws in `` the us legal system ? '', 
  santa ? 
  is n't that exactly what i said : mafia operates within its legal system and us government operates within its legal system ... am i missing something in your `` actual logical '' argument ? 
   and it certainly does n't say that obama authorized his assassination . 
  i 'm pretty sure pinochet did n't authorize every execution either ... 
   the mafia operating within its own `` legal system '' is irrelevant though , because not everyone is bound by their legal system . 
  they say everybody in their territory is . 
  so does us government . 
  what 's the difference again ? 
   yes , clearly, 
  you are quite welcome to post an actual argument . 
  so far you have not . 
  hint : your feelings do n't constitute an `` actual logical '' argument . 
   i posted one already , several replies back . 
  feel free to read them at your leisure . 
  nothing there but your feelings . 
   i outlined the distinct differences between the mafia and the gov ` t. 
  not sure where `` my feelings '' came into play . 
  feel free to quote me where im strictly appealing to emotion . 
  `` feelings '' is not synonymous with `` emotion '' ... you only outlined your `` feelings '' on why mafia differs from government . 
  which i rebuked every time . 
  but let 's summarize :, 
  mafia claims some territory . 
  us government claims some territory . 
  check . 
  mafia provides what they call `` services '' people might or might not be interested in . 
  among others so called `` protection '' , drugs , gambling and prostitution . 
  government provides what they call `` services '' people might or might not be interested in . 
  among others ( most ) roads , police , welfare , bombing brown people etc. 
  check . 
  mafia charges for their services , some ( most ? ), 
  charges are voluntary , some are forced . 
  government charges for their services , most charges are forced . 
  check ( although with a brownie point for mafia . ), 
  mafia has their rules/code of conduct/laws they themselves determine and enforce on inhabitants of their territory . 
  government has their rules/code of conduct/laws they determine themselves and enforce on inhabitants of their territory . 
  check . 
  seems pretty similar to me . 
  you , otoh , just insist they are different based only on your feelings . 
  i have n't seen any actual argument from you . 
  if you think i 'm mistaken , point out the one argument you can actually defend with logic , not some vague assertion . 
   sorry , but your little tautology there is pretty pathetic . 
  you seem to be mistaken what the word `` tautology '' mean ... anyway , would n't you call this `` feelings ? '', 
  there 's absolutely no argument in it , just that you `` feel '' it 's pathetic . 
  no actual argument . 
  i have outlined several similarities between mafia and government and you have yet to offer any rebuttal . 
  if what i wrote is incorrect it should be child 's play to point it out . 
  your problem is you do n't bother thinking - all you do is `` feel '' : mafia bad , government good .
