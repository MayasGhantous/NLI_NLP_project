  once again ron paul shows he does not want to win . 
  last year in iowa he run and anti-immigration ad , now this . 
   i mean , after all , those guys have guns and are pulling the trigger and aiming them at people !, 
  trigger discipline means `` do n't put your finger on the trigger ** until you are ready to shoot ** . '', 
  also , you are not supposed to point the gun at someone/something you do n't want to shoot . 
  obviously , when you want to shoot the guy it 's a good idea to point the gun at him and squeeze the trigger ... , 
   i 'm sure we could find 6 million people with $ 10 available to support palestine ... 
  sweet , 6 million newly-minted terrorists to prosecute . 
  wackenhut 's stock is going up !, 
   perhaps it differs much between states ? 
  yes . 
  i think that was the point ... , 
  hey , do n't ask me , ask dubya/obama ... 
  handy . 
  but mossberg is even more handy ... 
  well , since `` liberal '' was stolen from them by the left wing ... 
  wounds you can survive , starvation - not . 
   and he runs out of oil . 
  at the time he was buddy-buddy with uncle joe , he could get all the oil he wanted ... 
  _ beefourthree to psygnisfive _ : `` see , i told you nobody cares about jews , gypsies , gays , transsexuals , communists and mentally ill . '', 
  that would be a good explanation , except ... all the other candidates are also christian . 
  and they never feel as much heat from the usual suspects . 
  hate to break your bubble , all the candidates are christian . 
  ... but the friction is also related to mass ... 
  wrong movie . 
   if the right detonator is used, 
  apparently , dynamite is one ... , 
  \u266b is n't it ironic ... \u266b , 
   because there are a hell of a lot of costs involved , and i am hard pressed to find any benefits . 
  bad premises . 
  there are tremendous benefits for the ruling elites : more militants attacking americans , the more americans are likely to `` give up essential liberty for a temporary ( imaginary ) security . '', 
  that means more power for the rulers ... 
  tl , dr : `` c++ is a horrible language because i do n't know how to do shit in it . '', 
  all the whinings are from people who do n't know how to program in c++ , including st. linus ... 
   technological progress is heavily reliant upon available resources , which are not infinite . 
  ... but there 's awful lot of them . 
  the mass of the universe is estimated to be somewhere between 10 ^ 52 and 10 ^ 54kg . 
  that should be enough for a loooong time . 
  it might not be `` good for you '' but it certainly is delicious ... , 
  how many un resolutions is n't israel complying with ? 
  does it mean iran would be justified to invade israel ? 
   29 global banks that have presidents/prime ministers as their bitches . 
  ftfy, 
  yeah !, 
  look haw many wars they started in the last century . 
  none ? 
  sneaky bastards ... 
  stop it !, 
  you are confusing them with the facts . 
  you mean , you know what you know and facts be damned ... 
   because israel are not fucking batshit insane . 
  dunno ... recent history shows israel starting wars , bombing people and grabbing their land . 
  iran , otoh , seems to be pretty peaceful ... 
  nope . 
  have nothing against banging the interns , no desire to `` run a country , '' though ... 
   it is often claimed that people have better access to preventive screenings in universal health care systems . 
  but despite the large number of uninsured , cancer patients in the united states are most likely to be screened regularly , and once diagnosed , have the fastest access to treatment . 
  there 's no contradiction . 
  if the majority wants sharia ... 
  beats me ... but the majority ** is ** muslim . 
   and do n't ask me to grind ribeye, 
  steak tartare , baby !, 
   unknown electronic devices hanging around public spaces are inherently more suspicious than a sticker . 
  not if they are ricin laced stickers ... 
  bent double , like old beggars under sacks ,, 
  knock-kneed , coughing like hags , we cursed through sludge ,, 
  till on the haunting flares we turned our backs, 
  and towards our distant rest began to trudge . 
  men marched asleep . 
  many had lost their boots, 
  but limped on , blood-shod . 
  all went lame ; all blind ;, 
  drunk with fatigue ; deaf even to the hoots, 
  of tired , outstripped five-nines that dropped behind . 
  gas !, 
  gas !, 
  quick , boys !, 
  -- an ecstasy of fumbling ,, 
  fitting the clumsy helmets just in time ;, 
  but someone still was yelling out and stumbling ,, 
  and flound ` ring like a man in fire or lime . 
  dim , through the misty panes and thick green light ,, 
  as under a green sea , i saw him drowning . 
  in all my dreams , before my helpless sight ,, 
  he plunges at me , guttering , choking , drowning . 
  if in some smothering dreams you too could pace, 
  behind the wagon that we flung him in ,, 
  and watch the white eyes writhing in his face ,, 
  his hanging face , like a devil 's sick of sin ;, 
  if you could hear , at every jolt , the blood, 
  come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs ,, 
  obscene as cancer , bitter as the cud, 
  of vile , incurable sores on innocent tongues ,, 
  my friend , you would not tell with such high zest, 
  to children ardent for some desperate glory ,,
