   which is immaterial . 
  boortz identifies himself as a libertarian talk show host, 
  i seem to recall w.j. 
  clinton once identified himself as a libertarian too ... 
  i never eat at denny 's but i am often boycotting businesses with policies i find repulsive . 
   vegetarian [ ... ] vegan, 
  do i sense a correlation here ... ? 
   boortz has called himself a libertarian for the 10 + years i 've been aware of him . 
  i can call myself the chinese emperor all my life , still does n't mean i 'm going to be one . 
  i do n't . 
  still , i just do n't drink soda . 
  do n't know of any company policies i would find repulsive , though ... 
   the cops are n't acting like officers of the law . 
  they 're acting like bouncers at a club you are n't welcome in . 
  `` officer of the law '' is just an euphemism for `` bouncer at the club you are not welcome in '' ... 
   the bolsheviks were strongly right-wing -- they purged their own left ( anarchists ) and waged an ideological war against mensheviks . 
  none of that points to bolsheviks being left-wing . 
  ftfy, 
   the nazis did not nationalize corporations , they simply relied on private allies , providing those allies with state support, 
  the left-wingers seem to be awfully confused nowadays . 
  you guys seem to be quite ready to call the scandinavian countries `` the model of the successful socialism '' when it suits you , disregarding the fact they `` did not nationalize corporations , they simply relied on private allies , providing those allies with state support '' too ... make up your mind , either there can be socialism and private property or socialism has to nationalize everything . 
  well , that ** was ** their program ... you might want to ignore it but that does not change history . 
  if you read it , you can see that it 's exactly what they called themselves - national socialists . 
  the program is a mix of socialist agendas and nationalist/racist rhetoric . 
  iow they were left wingers with the race superiority complex ... 
   if you ca n't trust hitler about whether or not the nazis were socialists in the sense of , you know , socialism , then who can you trust ? 
  yeah , he was not a `` socialist '' in a narrow sense of `` socialism '' you seem to apply . 
  nevertheless , he was still firmly on the left . 
  he was no more `` right-wing '' than social democrats are . 
  nope . 
  america should n't involve itself in any conflict , unless actually attacked ... 
   the name means `` purity '' or something, 
  no it does not . 
  kasia is a diminutive form of katarzyna which is a polish for [ catherine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/katherine_%28given_name%29 ) ... 
  you sayin ' everything should be either mandatory or prohibited ? 
  you can `` continue living '' without using seat belts if you do n't do accidents ... 
  actually , yes . 
  that 's how accidents work . 
  there are really very few _ bona fide _ accidents , most of them are just driver negligence/stupidity ... 
  `` came to be '' , yes . 
  but that 's neither the original meaning nor close to anything in polish ... , 
  good move !, 
  may achieve much more than violence - which seems to play into israeli agenda ... 
  if it 's not a disorder why do you need treatment ? 
   automatic weapons are designed to kill people, 
  so are bats and clubs . 
  we should regulate really tight baseball and golf ... , 
  so , what does it say about america when they did not dare to rock a boat about uss liberty ... ? 
   no , bats and clubs are designed to play baseball and golf , not to kill people . 
  bats and clubs were around for much longer than baseball and golf . 
  yes , they were designed to kill people . 
   it is a shitty and wrong argument . 
  not more shitty than `` herp-derp guns were designed to kill people '' ... 
  nice try , dhs ... 
  you mean , if we only gave algor more money it would be averted ... ? 
  gone already ? 
  sure , and whit people in alabama did n't want negros in their restaurants because they preferred not being mugged , ai n't that right ? 
  do n't start with c++ , you only end up confused . 
  start with something simpler : c # , java , pascal ... once you get the hang on programing and feel comfortable then you can move to c++ . 
  it 's a very powerful language but it will be too much for a beginner . 
   not all cops are assholes , 99 % of them are good , honest , hardworking people , working to support there families, 
  so were guards at auschwitz ... 
  it 's already taken . 
  ansible ? 
  coming soon ... 
  try going to work tomorrow and pepper-spray your customers , see if you get the paid leave ... 
  because they can . 
  do n't quit the day job ... , 
  your iguana is also smarter than you . 
  ok , which candidate is not ? 
  i think he is being sarcastic ... or a druglord . 
  what 's wrong with getting naked ? 
   she was treated much better in her second line of work than her first, 
  maybe because her second line ow work was an honest profession ... ? 
  because they are coming on faster than you can censor ? 
  but that 's not democracy - it 's an unanimous consent agreement . 
  if you get overruled you do n't have to go . 
  in a democracy if you get overruled you still have to go . 
   `` taxes are theaft '', 
  well , i 'm not a `` willing participant '' so your argument does n't work for me . 
  i guess taxes are not theft for those who pay voluntarily , they are theft for the rest of us . 
   what you are calling collectivism and how you are defining it is really just individual liberty . 
  you have unorthodox definitions of the terms you are using . 
  so , in your opinion there 's really no difference between ( voluntary ) agrarian commune and a joe smith 's farm ? 
  to the same degree as a dude opening a store in a mafia hood is `` voluntarily '' agreeing to the `` protection fee '' ... , 
  i have yet to see a democracy with the opt-out provision ... 
   the mafia does not own the neighborhood, 
  they say they do . 
   the united states own the sovereign territory of the united states, 
  again , they say they do . 
  well , getting back to your `` 5 friends '' example ... you would n't mind if , after you disagreed with their vote , they asked you to move out of the area , would you . 
  oh , i 'm sure that if you insisted gambinos could come up with a paperwork ... , 
   the united states ' paperwork is sound . 
  sure . 
  they can show how they stole parts from uk ( who stole them from indians ) then bought some from the french ( who stole from the indians ) and bought/stole from the spaniards/mexicans ( who stole from the indians again ) and finally stole the rest from the indians . 
  sound indeed . 
   collectivism , if you bothered to look it up , puts `` social '' goals , `` group '' goals , as more important than individual goals . 
  ... and that would be the case in an agrarian commune . 
  for some strange reason you seem to imply they would not be collectivist unless they were forcing others to live the way they do ...
