   there are good reasons for not allowing hamburgers to be sold and no real evidence that it 's better for you than tofu . 
  ftfy, 
  you are reading into the definition of collectivism something that does not necessary have to be there , namely coercion ... voluntary collectivism is still collectivism . 
  curious , you would want to compare ** cooked ** hamburgers to ** raw ** milk ... 
   once millions of people from massachusetts show up and start creating their own communities , it seems pretty obvious that they will start creating their own little states based on their shared culture . 
  ftfy, 
  no distillery ? 
  can not be scotland ... , 
  [ bullshit ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greenhouse#history ), 
  [ left 's been good ] ( http://www.wendymcelroy.com/print.php?news.4343 ) ... 
  nothing wrong with that . 
  there 's plenty of open source projects at sourceforge , you should have no problem finding something interesting ... 
   i was a whiny little maggot easily pressured into things so i want the law to forbid sex for people who are not whiny little maggots ... 
  ftfy, 
  wait !, 
  does it mean women who talk a lot on the cell phone are becoming more feminine ... ? 
  kinda doubt it . 
  considering the chimps weight about 100lbs max ... 
  it 's not kids getting along , it 's boys hugging ... that really was not happening often back when i was a boy . 
  i can give you well thought out argument for downvoting you : you contribute absolutely nothing to the discussion . 
   after the september 1939 campaign the poles had the chance to re-integrate back into their `` homeland '' . 
  they choose to become refugees rather than accept germany 's sovereignty , become german citizens , and reclaim the right to their homes . 
  ftfy, 
  so , i guess , should iran and syria invade israel and ship all jews to madagascar , you would have no problem with that ? 
   in the vacuum that took place afterwards , the jewish people in israel were replaced by various arabs . 
  not quite correct . 
  seems that palestinians are mostly [ descendants of the ancient hebrews , with some arab blood mixed in ] ( http://epiphenom.fieldofscience.com/2009/01/shared-genetic-heritage-of-jews-and.html ) ... 
  so , there was never an ukraine either . 
  are ukrainians ` invented ' people ? 
  yup . 
  and they did displace ( and slaughter ) the philistines who were there before ... 
  ... and before you judge nazis you should read der st\u00fcrmer ... 
  you really should work on your reading comprehension skills . 
  i have n't say a thing about jews ( polish or otherwise ) or holocaust . 
  i was talking about sept '39 campaign - well before the nazis started the `` final solution . '', 
   their homes were n't destroyed , their families were n't murdered in mass .

  does it mean that , if faced with armed assailant and having a choice to defend yourself with ar15 or marlin .22 , you would pick randomly ... ? 
   if i shoot you in the hand , it does n't matter if i use a .22 or a .50 bmg, 
  you sure ? 
   b ) the term `` milicja '' is the term in polish for the police ,, 
  not really . 
  it was the orwellian renaming by the communists . 
  it 's back to `` policja '' right now . 
   and yes , super awesome to downvote this comment, 
  you are ( incorrectly ) assuming i downvoted you . 
  you know what they say about assuming ... 
  drew carey ( like clint eastwood ) is really libertarian ... 
  that 's why i always start the phone conversations ( with people who know me  with `` as-sal\u0101mu ` alaykum '' ... amd no , i 'm not muslim or arab . 
  you do n't thing uniformed people with guns taking you away from your home constitute violence ? 
  mamma gorilla : `` how many times must i tell you not to play with those hoodlums ... '', 
  breaking some law your esteemed , nonviolent economists asked for ? 
  do the names martha stewart or mike milken ring a bell ... 
  ... and delusional krugman apparently still believes you can spend yourself into prosperity ... 
  so , you just agree with the violence in those cases . 
  does n't mean the violence in question is defined differently than violence as epic defines it . 
   is the definition of violence different from `` behavior involving physical force intended to hurt , damage , or kill someone or something . '' ? 
  nope . 
  and yes , taxes and laws are backed by the ( credible ) threat of the violence . 
  every one of them . 
  `` political power grows out of the barrel of a gun '', 
   there 's no inherent violence in taxes , or laws . 
  you can quite easily demonstrate this to us . 
  simply refuse to pay taxes or obey some law . 
  then refuse to comply with any fines , summons or arrest warrants which come as result . 
  if , at the end , no men with guns appear at your door you will win the argument ... , 
  so you believe the mafia demanding protection payment from you does not involve `` inherent violence '' either ? 
  we are talking about violence , not society . 
  the violence is involved in both cases , you might find it justified in one case and not justified in the other but it 's still violence . 
  linky no worky, 
  think of it this way : lightbulb vs laser . 
  moderately educated kid should have known it 's bogus without looking at the date ... 
  of course they do n't have different goals . 
  their goal is absolute power . 
   everyone in science knows that we do n't know nearly enough about the complex interactions in large scale networks . 
  this includes everything from metabolic pathways , the brain to large ** interconnected economies ** . 
  and yet , somehow , we believe the bunch of politicians whose only skills seem to be looking good on tv , backstabbing and ass-kissing ( and the uncanny ability to sense when to do which ) , are qualified to run those same large interconnected economies ... go figure !, 
  i wonder if ( god forbid ) you were to get gravely ill , you would like someone completely clueless about medicine to administer your treatment . 
  after all , `` it 's not a good reason to give up on making it better . '', 
  dunno ... if the doctors were elected , i 'd probably rather do without . 
  and most definitely i would n't want them to mess with my body even when there was nothing wrong with me . 
  nah , it would be `` romney beats gingrich to the second place . '', 
   about 5 billion people need to die, 
  you volunteering ? 
   the illegal smuggling and selling of drugs breeds violence because of the huge profit margins involved, 
  ... and the huge profit margins are the consequence of the war on drugs . 
  as were the huge profit margins ( and the violence ) on alcohol during prohibition ... 
   they would still fight over the profits because it will still be hugely profitable . 
  just because they do n't have to smuggle it anymore does n't mean they wo n't continue fighting over control . 
  yup . 
  as the end of alcohol prohibition clearly demonstrates . 
  everybody knows about the recent drive by shootings between baccardi and captain morgan dealers ... 
  ** gthcrvn 's pops back in 1932 : **, 
   you know how to stop all these pedophiles from raping kids and going to jail ? 
  legalize child rape !, 
   your argument is fucking stupid . 
  no one is forcing people to deal booze . 
  you make a choice to break the law . 
  you should be aware of the consequences .
