   of course , you are probably 15 and have no fucking clue about what the term `` personal responsibility '' even means . 
  hmm ... perhaps your assumptions are wrong ... 
  says the known pedophile jcm267 ... 
  it will , it will ... 
  nothing wrong with that ... 
  newt 's base , otoh , is `` people who want to bomb brown people and fill up the prisons with pot smokers . '', 
  you have no fucking idea what `` personal responsibility '' means . 
  hint : it does not mean `` government knows better what is good for you '' ... 
  you may have some leg to stand on if the perps were punished . 
  as it is , they were absolved from any responsibility . 
  that means their bosses believe this is just as it 's supposed to be , not some `` isolated incident . '', 
  judging from the nick , you are a pig yourself , are n't you . 
  not if his executive order states it nullifies all ** previous ** executive orders ... 
  poor matts2 , i really feel for you . 
  all that effort and hard work seems to be for naught ... , 
  attack ? 
  by saying i feel for you ? 
  rubbing it in ... ? 
  have you ? 
  stop feeding the troll , please ... 
  that 's what turns them on ... , 
  ok , i 'm gon na serenade you every morning and then send you the bill . 
  seems to me you would n't want to refuse to pay for my services ... , 
  different ? 
  sure . 
  you might like tsa dudes probing your ass , i 'd rather have someone serenading me ... to each its own . 
   i really do n't understand why more statist liberals do n't move to syria . 
  it is the last best hope for statism on this earth . 
  what are the reasons that statists do n't think they can make it work there ? 
  ftfy, 
   he 's introduced legislation specifically designed to prevent federal courts from interfering with state pro-homosexuality laws . 
  ftfy, 
   why are you so angry ? 
  ( s ) he is scared not angry . 
  freedom is a scary shit ... 
  hmm ... if i dodge the mugger by going around his `` place of business '' , do i `` exploit the matters for my personal advantage at the expense of responsible pedestrians ? '', 
   darryl adams is a public servant, 
  no surprise here ... 
  [ ai n't nobody 's business if you do ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ain%27t_nobody%27s_business_if_you_do ), 
   cost us, 
  who is this `` us ? '', 
  uhmm ... the dude has no apparent clue what he is talking about . 
  so2 + h2o =  h2so3 not h2so4 ... quite a weak acid , albeit stronger than h2co3 . 
   of course , the bow and arrow could be used for aggressive purposes , but it could also be pinpointed to use only against aggressors . 
  nuclear weapons , even ` conventional ' aerial bombs , can not be . 
  these weapons are ipso facto engines of indiscriminate mass destruction . 
  well , that 's not entirely correct . 
  if deployed strictly against military targets of an aggressor , they can still be defensive only . 
  tactical nuke on the aircraft carrier ? 
  military bases ? 
  all the people there are either military or working for the military , not quite `` the innocent . '', 
  do they `` deserve '' to be shot ? 
  you are assuming they would prefer paul over obama ... 
  so , do you ? 
  murder is an ** unjustified ** killing ... just sayin ', 
   you 're talking about assassinating elected officials , which is not okay . 
  [ _ citation needed _ ], 
  who gives a rat 's ass about bolton ? 
  hedging their bets , more likely ... 
  * principles, 
  btw : whose definitions are those ? 
  some of the points seem like bs to me . 
  # 2 says that american ( or any other ) revolution was not `` just . '', 
  neither was spartacus rebellion ... # 4 says warsaw ghetto uprising was not `` just . '', 
  ! everything that is good for you should be mandatory !, 
  under the penalty of death !, 
   reddit is rather in a hurry to enforce, 
  seems to me it 's kaiserwill and doubleherpes , not reddit ... , 
  ... yet you diss the only candidate who is not trigger happy !? 
  does n't say much about ** your ** sanity ... 
  nope . 
  a vote for obama is a vote for obama . 
  a third party vote is a vote for a third party candidate . 
  very crypto . 
   there are no inherent human rights there are only laws that are man made . 
  interesting . 
  so , if government did not prohibit it you would kill , steal and rape ? 
   when polled the vast majority of people imagine revenge murders . 
  the operative word being `` imagine '' . 
  i have to take on faith your admission only the government keeps you from killing stealing and raping but if it is indeed so , i hope never to run into you . 
  `` invisible hand '' is a metaphor ... the free market is simply individual people making decisions for themselves . 
  decisions based on their subjective preferences and valuations , which can and do change with time . 
  any government intervention assumes that the politicians/bureaucrats know better what to decide for you than you do yourself . 
  how does that can make any sense whatsoever to anybody ( but the same politicians/bureaucrats ) is beyond my understanding . 
  there 's quite logical reason - the elites find it easier to manipulate elections that way ... 
  he did n't tell them to take from the rich and give to the poor either - that was some dude called robin ' from the hood . 
  perhaps because it burns faster than it is produced ? 
  hey , why are you dissing whores ? 
  they are mostly honest entrepreneurs ... 
  what bugs me the most is that killing the dude seems to be ` meh ' , urinating on the corpse - ohmygod !, 
  if i advised you to eat your vegetables or forced them down your throat , you would n't see the difference ? 
  if you start it , why do you feel entitled to complain ? 
  if you fuck and kill someone 's wife in texas you will most likely get the needle as well ... 
  even in those `` lawless countries '' if you leave others alone , they are more than likely to return the favor - criminals notwithstanding , but there 's plenty of criminals in your country too . 
   how come he 's not rich ? 
  because he is working the wrong jobs , perhaps ? 
   this has to be fake , or at least misleading, 
  nope . 
  it 's not . 
  google it .
