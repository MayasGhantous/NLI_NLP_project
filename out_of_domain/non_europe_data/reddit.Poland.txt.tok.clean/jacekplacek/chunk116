  do n't forget `` liberal '' has a very different meaning in usa ... , 
  this thread does understand . 
  point being he approved . 
   guess what making drunk driving illegal did ? 
  it made the instances of drunk driving fatality go down . 
  ... but since the overall fatalities went down much less , that means ** sober ** driving fatalities went ** up * ... 
  if they were voluntary , they would not be regulations . 
  it is voluntary but it is not regulations ... 
  ... and now that he is homeless and has no lawn of his own , he will be shitting on your lawn . 
  you deserve it . 
  ok , try to purchase ul certification without meeting ul standards . 
  let 's just evict all the people from substandard buildings !, 
  there 's so many homeless already , extra hundreds of thousands will make no difference !, 
  hurrah for statism !, 
  on the second thought , we can just jail all the homeless !, 
  that way the elitist fascist snobs ( jjhare especially ) will not be offended . 
  good to know you do n't see any difference between consensual sex an rape ... 
  nope . 
  he is homeless thanks to fascists like you who worship the state and its `` regulations '' ... 
  btw i am not a conservative ... 
  taking about yourself ? 
   they should n't accept it and then take the opportunity to slate it . 
  why ? 
  they accept it on a slight chance there 's a market for it . 
  if you like ads you get it , if you do n't you skip it . 
  at least they are not pretending it 's something that it is not . 
  they should pick each other for the vp . 
  the resulting elections would at least be honest . 
  obama - romney vs romney - obama !, 
  i bet you envision ** yourself ** as the one who does the `` allowing '' ... 
  but ok , let 's see : i want to be a hay farmer - my daughter wants a porsche so i have to provide . 
  wifey could really use a lamborghini and my father-in-law always wanted a bentley ... do you know how much hay you need to buy a bentley ? 
  definitely talking about yourself ... 
  people who are drawn into violent jobs are more violent ? 
  who would have thought ... 
  yup . 
  it 's crazy and un-american to have no desire to bomb brown people and fill the prisons with potheads ... 
  `` b-but '' should be a giveaway ... 
  ... says phuq ... 
   if he believes that is the ideal why not try to argue for his point of view ? 
  harry browne once quipped `` government breaks your legs then gives you crutches and says you would n't be able to walk without its help . '', 
  obviously , libertarians are against breaking your legs - does n't mean they want to take away the crutches ... 
  how can you be arrested for involuntary body reaction ? 
  there must be something you are not showing us . 
  your code as posted should not generate an error . 
   war is the health of the state . 
  he must be an anti-semite , or something ... , 
   at least they can get shit done . 
  `` shit '' being the operative word ... 
   and do n't say `` well the voters get what they want '' because that 's just tyranny of the majority . 
  oh , so it 's `` tyranny of the majority '' on the state level but it 's not on the federal level ? 
  unfortunately , most people believe everything should be either mandatory or prohibited ... :(, 
  they might be not . 
  their handlers certainly are . 
  that , kinda , depends on your definition of `` fine '' ... 
  yeah , with singapore ( a dictatorship , for all practical purposes ) being the second ... 
   singapore has a constitution, 
  so did soviet union ... 
  baaaaa ... 
   news is not allowed to be biased, 
  there 's nobody as blind as the one who does n't want to see ... 
  you were simply indoctrinated into sharing the biases with your `` news '' . 
  decide for [ yourself ] ( http://original.antiwar.com/justin/2012/01/19/the-return-of-the-smear-bund/ ) ... 
   commonly used by soldiers fighting in the middle east, 
  i just found out coca cola is `` commonly drunk by soldiers fighting in the middle east , '' is that supposed to tell me something ? 
  i can tell the difference just fine . 
  i can also tell the difference between an intelligent argument and the dumb one . 
  what i can not tell is how the `` commonly used by soldiers '' phrase is relevant to the discussion ... 
   president `` i want to end all those foreign wars and bring an end to the terrible state violence '' paul is being saluted by a man waving a tool of foreign warriors and state violence . 
  ron paul is supporting the right of every american to keep and bear such a tool . 
  i know many people who own such rifles without being `` foreign warriors '' or having anything to do with `` state violence . '', 
  besides , it appears the picture was taken at a gun show . 
  what would you rather display in such a venue - a dildo ? 
  baaaaa ... 
   there is n't really anyone who thought fannie and freddy were bad until the entire housing industry blew up . 
  [ cough , cough ... ] ( http://www.intellectualtakeout.org/library/primary-sources/ron-paul-house-financial-services-committee?library_node=70423 ), 
  that 's right !, 
  and the dude whose neighbor called stasi on , really could indeed be an `` enemy of the people '' or even an `` american spy ! '', 
  there 's nothing wrong with being vigilant !, 
   ca n't be attributed to oral sex because a ) it 's not concentrated in young people, 
  why do you think youngsters get more oral sex than us geezers ... ? 
   the polish government is a corrupt and failed joke . 
  the very institution of a government is a corrupt and failed joke . 
  why are people believing bunch of dudes with no apparent skills other than ass-kissing and back-stabbing , when elected to the office will become some kind of saints/philosopher kings and will figure out and do what 's best for the country . 
  while smith 's `` it is not from the benevolence of the butcher , the brewer , or the baker , that we expect our dinner , but from their regard to their own interest '' is usually understood by most people , the same folks expect the bureaucrat and the politician to put his own interest aside and work for the `` good of all . '', 
  and have the divine insight what that `` good '' might be ... 
   i agree that the institution is flawed , but it is still necessary ( see : somalia ), 
  dunno ... somalia now ( or better yet in the 90s ) vs somalia back then with the government ? 
  or vs sudan ? 
   if the dead teen had lived , i think this situation would be a happier one and , for lack of a better word , a better one . 
  perhaps . 
  or maybe the next time he would rape , torture and kill you and your family ... 
  o'rly ? 
  he occupied tripoli for 10 years ? 
  and brought `` democracy '' to morocco ? 
  yup . 
  nobody is complaining about going after terrorists and kicking their asses . 
  what we are complaining about is occupying some faraway countries and bringing `` democracy '' to them . 
  oh , and the making sure we have no more freedom so they will not hate us anymore . 
  he is , specifically , praising the ones who voted against , not all ...
