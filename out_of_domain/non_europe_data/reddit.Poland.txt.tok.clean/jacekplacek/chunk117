   you would n't want the government to not inspect, 
  yes , i would . 
  are you `` a 76 year old man who worked as a physician all my life and was a congressman for the rest of it '' ? 
   while it is not illegal to use different notes, 
  tell that to [ von nothaus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bernard_von_nothaus ) ... 
  we knew already it was easy to indict a ham sandwich , now we know it 's apparently almost as easy to convict one ... 
  why ? 
  to make it even easier ? 
  sure , it would be nice to just drop all the illusions and simply announce we really are a fascist country ... 
  romney hired g. gordon ... ? 
   corrections corporation of america . 
  here the company ( which spends millions lobbying legislators ) is obliged to caution its investors about the risk that somehow , somewhere , someone might turn off the spigot of convicted men, 
  they really do fear ron paul , do n't they ... 
   the irony is that had the accident occurred in canada ... her care would have been covered because , unlike the u.s. , canada has a system of universal coverage, 
  the irony is that if a foreigner in canada had an accident , ( s ) he would not be covered by the canadian `` system of universal coverage '' either . 
  statism : where the freedom means `` i 'm free to do as massah says ! '', 
  since you want to vote for someone who is very likely to attack iran how does it show you do n't want to attack iran ? 
  hmmm ... the ballot is secret , how do i know the people i bring in are n't going to tell me they voted for ron paul but vote for romtorich ... ? 
  they are really scared !, 
  not as bad as reddit and media would like us to believe , better than most neocons but still not a friend of libertarians ... 
  dunno ... voting itself is a fraudulent institution . 
  i personally do n't vote but do n't have any qualms with people who want to defraud the frauds ... 
  neocons they . 
  is n't that what tlgf is ? 
  it 's a freedom thing , you would n't understand . 
   i do n't think they are neocons, 
  so , what are they ? 
   hell at least they believe that people have rights, 
  unless the people are palestinians or muslim in general ... 
  i do n't give a rat 's ass about the elections . 
  i like ron and would be ecstatic if he won , but that is never gon na happen , no matter how many people vote for him . 
  ( _ it 's not who votes , it 's who counts the votes . _ ), 
  btw , you are actually incorrect the op 's scheme constitutes a voting fraud . 
  it 's done every time by every campaign . 
  ... with other people 's lives ... 
   obviously a. 
  600k * 1/3 + 0 * 2/3 = 200k . 
  so all in all , better to go with they hypothetically `` certain '' 200k that `` will '' be saved , rather than chance it and lose all 600k people, 
  dunno ... if you look at it from the other side - a condemns 400k , while b can condemn another 200k ( 2/3 chance ) or save the 400k ( 1/3 chance ) . 
  customers can require labels ( certified by the body like ul ) and refuse to buy non-labeled items . 
  no government regulations required ... 
  nope . 
  you said it 's no longer free market . 
  it is . 
  you really do n't see the difference between government passing the law `` all food has to be labeled '' and customers saying '' i 'm not buying this because it 's not labeled ? '', 
  ... some animals are more equal ... 
  yup , unprovoked assault on a female is always funny ... assholes . 
  what else are you beating girls up for ? 
   he will take a tenth of your grain, 
  i would be ecstatic if our king took only tenth of my paycheck ... :(, 
  go join fucking taliban , you will fit right there . 
  picking your nose is not `` acceptable behavior '' either , does n't mean you deserve to be physically assaulted if you do . 
  [ bunch of them ] ( http://bigheadpress.com/ ) ... 
  that 's , kinda , defies the `` universal '' aspect of it ... 
  you forgot to mention he shits gold nuggets , at night goes around dc and prevents crime and , in the spare time , works on faster than light space travel ... 
   the breathalyzer is a tool that analyzes the content of alcohol in your system . 
  not exactly . 
  it does analyze the content of alcohol ( or any substance that it 's not able to distinguish from alcohol ) in your breath sample . 
  which might or might not translate to the blood alcohol level . 
  you lost me at che ... 
  crime ? 
  how quaint !, 
  do n't you know you live at the sole discretion of the state ? 
  they are very lenient here - could just have droned him ... / s, 
  he was a murderous sadistic psychopathic scum . 
   the gun rights one is a huge , huge stretch but at least it 's based on something ... 
  not according to [ goa ] ( http://gunowners.org/2012presidential.htm ) ... 
   unregulated capitalism is bad for people . 
  yup . 
  it 's very bad for people when businesses have to compete on merit . 
  it 's much better for people when they only need to buy politicians ... / s, 
  oh , you 've never made a typo ? 
  you need better cats !, 
  otoh , if this becomes the norm , nobody will be stealing ... not worth the risk . 
  that means if someone is in a class of morons ( s ) he will get all as with very little work . 
  but someone who masters the topic much better would fail in the class of geniuses . 
  oh , that 's pretty simple - officer has to feel threatened to shoot someone , therefore officer peters felt threatened , therefore loxas was threatening him . 
  well , obviously , those ** are ** security concerns ... their jobs ' security concerns . 
   do you agree that birth control is an anathema and a crime against nature ? 
  why would you ask this question in r/libertarian ? 
  dunno . . there 's also r/liberty , does it mean in your opinion that topics related to liberty should not be posted here either ? 
   the fact that 300 million people is just too complex to be able to consider all variables, 
  yet , any and every other political ideology assumes the few elected `` philosopher-kings '' can do just that . 
  what libertarians are saying is : `` hey , this stuff is beyond ** anybody 's ** grasp . 
  the only way for the society to work is to let the market do its job . '', 
  markets do self-adjust , nobody makes perfect decisions all the time . 
  when you make the wrong decision , you will face consequences yourself , hopefully you will learn by your mistakes and make better decisions next time around . 
  when the politicians make wrong decisions , we ** all ** are paying for their mistakes . 
  and the worst possible consequences to them is losing re-election ... and getting to sit on the board of directors of the company they helped at our expense . 
  edit : btw i mean `` market '' in a praxeological sense - as the sum of ** all ** human interactions , not just the economics ... 
  i do n't believe i was `` bashing '' anyone , and i thought i did answer your question . 
  yes , there are no utopias . 
  yes , free people can enjoy fruits of their labor , they also have to face the consequences of their mistakes . 
   none of that has nothing to do with a pure libertarian socirty , and the ills that follow . 
  it 's as if no one in / r/libertarian is able to have any amount of self reflection on their political thoughts . 
  i do n't understand what are you talking about . 
  everything i said above was about the libertarian society . 
  and the `` ills that follow ? '', 
  how would you describe the `` ills that follow '' abolishing slavery ? 
  again , there are no utopias , the life itself is n't always `` fair . '',
