  no possible structure of society is going to guarantee everybody is gon na be happy all the time . 
  all you can do is to try to minimize the unnecessary suffering - and that can only be achieved if people are free . 
  you have n't noticed that ( despite `` gun '' being in the title ) the dude in the video is using guns as props to accentuate his point ... which is not about guns . 
  and the freedom to own and use the tools for self-defense is as much part of topic of liberty as , let 's say , the freedom to own and use the tools of expression . 
  would you admonish a poster of video/article dealing with internet freedom to post it to r/computers instead ? 
   all american rightwing loonies rarely get paraded on the us media unless they actually kill people like mcvey . 
  you seem to have a case of selective memory . 
  interesting ... would you feel the same if they approached some loony , promised to pay him for murdering someone and then boasted about apprehending a dangerous hit-man ? 
  all the `` problems '' you have listed are either caused by government granting privileges , facilitated by governments , or an effect of `` big business - big government '' collusion . 
  or not really problems at all . 
  predatory monopolies can not be sustained without government help . 
  the `` increased amount of legislation '' are one of the problems all statist systems are facing . 
  how am i to comment about that from the libertarian perspective ? 
  public `` accountability '' of private companies ? 
  that 's the very thing that markets provide - a company that does n't provide the best goods/services for the best price will not thrive . 
  what other accountability do you have in mind ? 
  advertising causing people to `` act outside their economic interest ? '', 
  who are you to judge ? 
  you know people 's `` economic interest '' better than people do themselves ? 
  are you in favor of mao designing and mandating the same uniforms for everybody ? 
  i have a feeling you might throw enron / bernie maddoff example at us . 
  sure , there 's always a possibility of a fraud , but observe that with all the `` regulatin ' and law 'n' order '' it still happens in statist societies . 
  as a matter of fact it 's much more likely to happen in a society that believes the government is there to protect them - people lose their natural skepticism ( hey , bernie maddoff was cleared by sec , he must be legit ! ), 
  just the anecdotal evidence : recent immigrants from the statist , highly regulated societies are much more often the victims of the `` get rich quick '' scams . 
  they believe that if something is out there in the open it has to be legit . 
  you are assuming he was not . 
  nope , he is talking about attitudes ... guns and shootings are incidental . 
  not true ... it 's `` whom '' you know . 
   no one gets abortions at that stage, 
  hmmm ... day-after pill ? 
  you 've got ta be fucking kidding ... 
  why ? 
  pissing is one of the dicks ' natural function ... 
   it seems to me that they 're making a few assumptions that i did n't know anyone could make, 
  well , on the topic of abortion ** everybody ** makes `` a few assumptions '' ... how is a baby just out of the womb any different than fetus just before birth ? 
  how about premature births ? 
   just barely controlling ; just one dissenting vote means that the republicans could do what they want, 
  does it mean that when the republicans have a slim majority , democrats `` can do what they want ? '', 
   noah 's ark is n't just a christian symbol it 's in the jewish faith as well, 
  ... not to mention islam ... 
  same, 
   my country has literally zero anecdotes of police brutality , despite being one of the least ` free ' countries in the first world , an open police state . 
  in a police state any police brutality would not be reported , would it . 
  `` if voting could change anything it would be illegal . '', 
   being a libertarian does n't mean you should just let people say things without questioning them simply because they believe what they 're saying . 
  yes it does . 
   i have i right to ask why anyone would understand what this guy is saying much less agree with him . 
  sure , you have the right to ask . 
  i do n't have the duty to respond . 
  on the related note : after long and through investigation of almost 15 centuries of data it has been established that the pope is a catholic . 
  it does matter . 
  a lot . 
  pilot would go with `` fly that plane to havana , '' but not with `` i 'm gon na fly your plane . '', 
  nobody says you are an inconsistent troll , as trolls go you seem to be pretty consistent ... , 
  'cause i like trolling the trolls ... ? 
   tolkiens works were removed from the public domain in 1994 . 
  how can you remove something from public domain ? 
  would it be ok for me to remove _ the odyssey _ and _ the iliad _ from public domain ? 
  hydrocarbons you do n't even have to mine ... ? 
  can you explain why you feel comfortable commenting on subjects you have absolutely no clue about ? 
  the topic you have absolutely no clue about is `` money . '', 
  tip : `` money '' is not the same as `` coins . '', 
   most of the economy was moneyless because there were n't enough coins to go around, 
  as i said , you have no clue what money is . 
  most of the economy might have been `` coinless , '' does n't mean it was `` moneyless . '', 
  dunno about that ... fusion drive is kinda feasible for space travel , not quite for your car . 
  op is american ? 
  you would be surprised ... 
  * their, 
  how is an us carrier in the persian gulf protecting americans and their land ? 
  well , fuehrerprinzip is kinda part of fascism , does n't necessary make all who idolize their fuehrer fascists ... , 
  guess , marines are not big panetta 's fans ... , 
   what would a libertarian government be doing for the people ? 
  getting out of the way ? 
  `` disorderly conduct '' means `` we want to charge you with something , just nothing else comes to mind '' ... 
  i hope you have a thick skin - tasers are pretty painful ... 
  so they can waste it again ... 
  that 's not what she said ... 
   how was it a waste of money ? 
  you tell me . 
  more than 40 years after apollo 11 , they can not even send astronauts into orbit anymore . 
  their achievements ended long time ago - now they just waste money ... 
  yeah , i 've read this book too . 
  cnn got one thing wrong - it 's not hezbollah , it 's bosnian muslims ( blond , blue eyed ) trained to unleash destruction . 
  they also forgot the bulgarian hacker ... / s, 
   there are us astronauts in the international space station right now . 
  and how did they get there ? 
  how are they coming back ? 
   gun show where a 7 year old could probably walk out with a machine gun if he was so inclined, 
  once in your life you should go to a gun show , just to cure yourself from the confusion media seeded in your mind ... 
  they all dissociate in your stomach , there 's really no difference between taking ammonium chloride and ammonia ( other than ammonia rising slightly ph. ), 
  never attribute to stupidity that which is adequately explained by self-interest and power hunger . 
  they do it all wrong : they should call it `` net neutrality and lolkats ' protection act . '', 
  and it would pass right away with reddit cheering ... , 
  libertarians have absolutely no problems with any ** voluntary ** associations . 
  unfortunately , most socialists call for government coercion to achieve their goals . 
  as to the specific questions about worker cooperatives and collective ownership : absolutely no problem ; as long as nobody is forced into it . 
  l. neil smith . 
   1.5 m pages is probably 4 - 5 tomes, 
  300 000 pages per book ... ?
