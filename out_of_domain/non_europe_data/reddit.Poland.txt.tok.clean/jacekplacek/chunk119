   the ludicrous idea that a governor would murder journalists in the united states . 
  why ? 
  do you believe getting elected in us makes people into saints ? 
  ok , how is contraception `` saving children 's lives ? '', 
  if the child is never born his/her life can not be `` saved . '', 
  `` inalienable '' means they can not be justly deemed non-existent . 
  you can strip someone of their rights but it would not be just . 
  even if you are a king . 
  you do n't need to be smart to get elected ... 
  to a degree . 
  yes . 
  how can you not ? 
  there are certain things that are obviously beneficial to humans as a specie and as individuals . 
  they can be objectively tagged as `` right . '', 
  there are also certain things which are obviously detrimental . 
  therefore `` wrong . '', 
  you might want to acquaint yourself with the notion of [ natural law ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/natural_law ) ... 
  hope that was by design ... , 
  no , obviously he can not change the law . 
  what he can do is stop enforcing it ( at the federal level , automatically leaving it for the states to decide . ), 
  he can also pardon all federal non-violent drug war prisoners . 
   nothing can be objectively tagged as right or wrong as every person can deem something right or wrong . 
  killing an individual is quite objectively detrimental to his/her well being . 
  the extinction level event would be quite objectively detrimental to the specie . 
  there 's no way to twist the logic to make it not so . 
   i am a utilitarian . 
  iow , you do believe there are things that are `` right '' and `` wrong . '', 
  otherwise you would have no way to calculate/estimate `` utility . '', 
   you might feel that things that are beneficial to humans are `` right '' and should therefore be considered `` rights '' , but unless you believe in an omnipotent god there 's no reason to believe in objective morality . 
  dunno ... how much are the children contributing ? 
  sure , change the definitions of words willy-nilly and you can prove anything ... 
   i think that questioning the science about humans changing the climate is basically the same as saying the earth is flat . 
  actually , it 's more like questioning the ptolemy 's system back then ... 
  what about them ? 
  _ panta rhei _ , motherfucker ... anyways , the next ice age is just around the corner ( seems like . ), 
  when you freeze your balls off you will weep for global warming ... 
  sure . 
  yet it will most likely be offset by oodles of reclaimed arable land in northern hemisphere . 
  so , essentially climate will change . 
  and we have absolutely no idea if the change will be for good , bad or neutral . 
  therefore we need to give the politicians much more power to mess with our lives . 
  there 's no reason for the shortage of credit . 
  the banks can still lend your money out , they just have to be transparent about it . 
  let 's say you would have the checking account , 100 % liquid ; then you 'd have investment account , 100 % loaned out ; and perhaps some kind of `` saving '' account , only fractionally liquid . 
  obviously , checking account would carry a fee , all the others would pay interest . 
  because he knew they would n't fight back ... ? 
   atheism and libertarianism have common roots, 
  [ _ citation needed _ ], 
  you mean instead of 4 more years of obama you can get 8 more years of obama-lite ... ? 
  of course it 's working . 
  how else would you turn us into a police state ... ? 
   we are guaranteeing 8 years with one vote, 
  yup . 
  8 years of `` romney or someone worse . '', 
  with re-election of obama , perhaps gop will learn not to pick pinkos , if they want the presidency . 
   how bout another 5 trillion ? 
  how about it ? 
  nothing in romney 's past indicate unwillingness to spend ... 
  how about you grow some balls and vote ron paul in primaries . 
   you sir ... are a fucking idiot, 
  how do you know who am i fucking and why do you believe she is an idiot ? 
  why do you think she would be worse than the norm ... ? 
  leaving one galaxy , gravity would slow it down - approaching another , it would speed it up . 
   a proton could not cross inter-galactic distances and still maintain that speed by the time it arrived on earth, 
  but if it started even faster ... 
  because they will most likely catch you and have an extra excuse for killing you ? 
   i agree . 
  running is definitely criminal enough to be executed for . 
  bandophahita did not say that . 
  look at it that way : if a predatory animal goes after you , running might be much worse than trying to confront it ( that , of course , depends on the animal and the situation . ), 
  it should n't be illegal for you to get into lysine business , undercut their prices and retire in bahamas . 
   i mean if one company held a monopoly on all oil or electricity production, 
  you mean had a government granted monopoly ? 
  otherwise , any bright 8th grader would be able to construct a generator ... 
  if it started even faster it would have a shitton more energy/mass . 
  it would take gigashitton of photons to slow it down ... 
  oh , so because the government restricts new entries to the market it has to put even more restrictions to make it `` fair ? '', 
  what then , even more restrictions because of the damage to the market the new restrictions cause ? 
  is there an end to that ( baring total government control of everything ? ), 
  raging ? 
  nope , i 'm not raging . 
  believe me , when i start raging you will know it , 
  and no , you did n't say that . 
  but that 's what your logic implies . 
  getting there . 
  you are supposed to negotiate before not after ... 
  ... other than terrible , unreadable font ... 
  ... perhaps they did n't `` fix '' them high enough ... or perhaps there are government permits required to enter the business ? 
  beats me - do you know ? 
   no government prevented african companies from starting up and selling to african countries that bought lysine from adm. 
  so , why did n't they ? 
  but if someone tells me sargonofakkad has jumped from the tower and walked out unhurt , i will suspect some unmentioned factor being present ( like tower being only 3 feet tall or sargon having a glider at the time ) before jumping to the conclusion newton was full of shit ... 
  you wish for big brother to watch you more closely ... ? 
  nope . 
  i did ** speculate ** on the ** possible ** other factors . 
  newton is still pretty solid . 
  he 's still pretty solid in non-relativistic speeds ... 
  but when you flush , it is . 
  nope . 
  but the government regulates how much water per flush ...
