  even if there is a stupid treaty like this , all you need to do is to incorporate in a non-signatory country ... 
   kill or seriously injure people , with very little effort, 
  know what , people like you scare the living shit out of me . 
  the way i see it , decision to kill a human being is one of the most serious decisions one can ever make . 
  if i were ever to make such decision , availability of a specific means to do it would not be a consideration . 
  at the same time , mere availability of the tool would never ever even remotely influence my decision . 
  you seem to imply you yourself can not be trusted with anything dangerous , because you basically admit possession of a tool could ` make ' you kill someone ... 
   if violent people are always going to be violent ; then do n't give them the means to cause more suffering through their violence, 
  ... and do n't give their intended victims the means of self-defense ... 
  basically , you are one of the despicable creatures who would rather see a girl raped and strangled in a back alley than let her have a tool to defend herself . 
  are you a rapist by any chance ? 
  it already has . 
  we just have n't realized it yet . 
  [ parc ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parc_%28company%29 ), 
   nuclear decay was discovered using federal funded research . 
  [ was it ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radioactive_decay#discovery ), 
  he who ? 
  becquerel , at the time of his discovery , was a chief engineer in the department of bridges and highways . 
  his research was pretty much a hobby . 
  other early contributors worked mostly for universities , some presumably funded by state ( s ) , some private . 
  what does it prove ? 
   because you are the only person who you 100 % agree with . 
  i do n't always agree with myself ... , 
  hmm ... if you look at what they say the count is for minnesota and what actually is happening there , you might reconsider your blind trust in nyt 's pronouncements ... 
  well , that 's what you get if you disregard what the actual process is and `` project '' based on the straw poll ... 
  guess ( s ) he means he3 ... 
  oh , for fuck 's sake , lighten up !, 
  little bit more than 11 oz ... 
  hey , elections are way too important to leave them to the voters ' whim ... 
  do i sense `` yo mama '' joke somewhere there ... ? 
   how austrian theory explains a human which uses their time to harass and attempt to cause misery to others, 
  hey , that 's what he gets off on . 
  great line ? 
  harper really missed great opportunity - `` sure , i will own up to any reform policies if you own up to hitler ... '', 
   you think climate change is good for the economy ? 
  climate change ? 
  what direction and how much of a change ? 
  so far it was pretty good . 
  if as prophet algor prophesies , it will get even warmer , there are good reasons to believe it will be good for the economy . 
  agriculture - with the longer growing seasons , vast areas of the new arable land , and ... yes , abundance of co2 which , actually , ** is ** a food for plants . 
  but also , new shipping routes across the arctic and drilling/mining the arctic ocean . 
  overall seems more than likely it ** will ** be exceptionally good for the economy . 
  ... although not all of it exactly libertarian ... 
  you talking about elder romney ... ? 
  that 's not exactly libertarian . 
   all those scientists, 
  hmm ... til the climate scientists double as experts on economics . 
  oops ... 
  i should have known better than arguing with religion ... 
  rather , it is the sad outcome of having fbi ... does n't anybody wonder why ** all ** `` terrorist plots '' this century involved fbi ... 
   hierarchical, 
  i could never get the collectivist-anarchists ' hang up about `` hierarchy . '', 
  even voluntary kind . 
  do you mean there will be no team sports in your anarchy ? 
  no planes ? 
  no ships ? 
   what is an example of a safeguard to those who initate aggression ? 
  [ one example ... ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/shotgun_mossberg_590.jpg ), 
   anyways i mostly want to ask whether most statists believe that a statist paradise is possible . 
  i ask this because first off a paradise is a paradise and thus seems to be fantastic in nature , also if such a paradise is not possible what would a statist settle for ( or would one always be discontent with less than absolute perfection ) ? 
   what protects a statist society from a charismatic leader who gathers a following ? 
  ftfy, 
  the different spelling could have been a hint ... 
  why ? 
  are you a small rodent ? 
   all you have to do is trade with us using markets . 
  actually , no , you do n't have to . 
  you could if you wanted , though ... 
   you should buy this good i acquired through employing wage laborers . 
  again , you do n't have to . 
  it 's entirely up to you to buy or not to buy . 
   romney has 865 according the delegate tally at realclearpolitics.com . 
  well , if you paid any attention , you 'd realize their `` tally '' is not quite accurate ... 
  true that . 
  but so would plenty of noam 's darlings ... 
   you will probably want the communists to abide by your economy rather than the communist one . 
  i do n't get it . 
  if you were to trade with syndicalists , you would probably offer them some of what you produce in exchange for something they make . 
  why would it be any different with the capitalist pigs ? 
  but you do n't live in a `` capitalist system , '' you live in a mutualist one ... do n't you . 
  your point being ? 
  by all means , do trade with whoever you want to trade . 
  how again are you compelled to trade with capitalists ? 
  < shrug  afraid you did n't pass a turing test ... 
   and the one uses a currency and uses a market system to judge the value of a good , where as the other does n't use a currency and only uses labor/time to value a good . 
  why is that a problem ? 
  all you have to do is to come to the agreement on `` how many pigs for a tractor ? '', 
  how does it matter to you that your 100 hrs of labor might be equivalent to ancaps ' 1oz of gold ? 
  either the trade is acceptable to you ( and then you trade ) or is not ( and you do n't . ), 
   if , on the other hand , the capitalists make up a significant portion of the society , you are simply avoiding the fact that your question has already been answered . 
  wait !, 
  are you saying people , if given a free choice , would prefer ancapistan over any other anarchistic society ?!!!, 
  but if that 's the case , how are poor collectivist-anarchists gon na ever achieve their goals ? 
  uhmmm ... you do realize that the ancap society could only emerge if enough people decided they wanted it , do n't you . 
  the initial premise was that collectivist anarchist can not coexist with anarcho-capitalists , no mention of the relative size ... 
  how is that any different with syndicalists ? 
  or even other group of communists ? 
  yeah , and tea party is racist ... < / sarcasm , 
   if the `` occupy '' movement , or any other mob , actually represents a majority , then they already have the votes to accomplish legally whatever they are trying to accomplish by illegal means .
