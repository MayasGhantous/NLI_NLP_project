  really ? 
  just like that ? 
  so how do you explain the congress with single digit approval rate gets 90 % reelected ? 
  elections are a scam . 
  you have practically no chance of getting elected dog-catcher without elites ' approval . 
  he is proposing budget cuts ** and ** tax cuts - presumably enough to offset the budget cuts . 
  iow whatever the government is n't going to spend the taxpayers will . 
   in other words , supply of capital is not the problem . 
  the lack of consumer demand is what is holding us back . 
  hmmm ... tax cut would certainly put more money into taxpayers ' pockets , would n't it . 
  nope . 
  do n't lie , it 's not nice ... 
  ... but reposting your comment right under the first one , is not a good idea ... , 
   `` oh my god , how dare you criticize the president that way '' . 
  well , you 've totally missed the point . 
  it 's the wapo being making fun of , not obama ... 
  nah ... just flash the disco and everyone 's gon na give a way ... , 
  just nitpicking ... 
  well , that means he was around 50 when he got there . 
  not everybody has an aptitude for languages and older people without it might have a very hard time learning . 
  i know from experience - my father moved to canada when he was in his 50ties and never really learned to speak decent english . 
  not quite . 
  there 's plenty of blonde serbs ... 
  anarchism - without rulers, 
  socialism - gensecs , central committees , etc ; these are rulers . 
  even if you decentralize , you will still need committees and ` secretaries ' , wo n't you ... 
  [ woosh ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poe%27s_law ), 
  oh , cool ... so it 's now ok to teach 6 year olds that 2 +2 = 5 and earth is flat . 
  they will later on develop `` some critical thinking skills '' after all ... 
   it was just such a random act of violence . 
  how do they know ? 
  and how wowcars knows race has anything to do with it ? 
  i invest in old whiskey . 
  look at this that way : eve if you were a sc justice , would you want to piss irs off ... ? 
   the `` natural born citizen '' rule for the president has always struck me as kind of weird . 
  it might be weird but it 's the law . 
  there 's plenty of weird laws on the books and plenty of people sitting in jail for breaking them ... 
  riddle me this : why your great-gramps did n't have to `` willingly '' agree to any contract with the government to get the `` carriage riding license ? '', 
  so what ? 
  my scooter is not capable of doing 120 either , i still need to have a license ... 
  it depends . 
  the amendments pretty much state it themselves :, 
  `` congress shall pas no law '' - not incorporated ; `` shall not be infringed '' - incorporated , etc. 
  so , yes in this case judge was wrong as to the `` us constitution . '', 
  but it is still protected under florida constitution article i section 4 ... 
  oh , would you volunteer for it to be released into your backyard ... ? 
  so , how do you determine who is an invader ? 
  i 'm pretty sure humans were there before it was born , i 'm pretty sure he was n't born in the building either ... 
  ... assuming mountain lions prefer coyotes over moongazers ... 
   mountain lions came to the americas millions of years ago, 
  oh , so they were invaders back then , were n't they . 
  actually , everything after prokaryotes , is an `` invader '' , should we nuke the earth all over ? 
  do n't believe the word he is saying . 
  dude was a commie bastard when it was profitable , become `` social democrat '' after the fall of the communism , and generally was always leaning with the wind ( kinda polish romney ) ... 
  it is fashionable now to be against drug war , so he found a new worldview ... 
  ben bernanke : mugabe 's brightest student ... , 
  it was still called rhodesia back then ... 
   other species equilibrate with the environment in a manner of coexistence, 
  they do ? 
  tell that to all the species obliterated by the oxygen generated by invader cyanobacteria , algae and other early plants ... 
  hmmm ... ottawa , mexico city , nassau and havana look pretty bad ... , 
   sadly there is n't much of a libertarian movement in poland, 
  there 's still korwin-mikke ... 
  they said the same of warren harding ... 
  sorry , i do n't do facebook ... 
  same as on `` have sex with me or i quit '' ... 
   ron paul adviser eric dondero, 
  ... former ... 
  out of these four which one was build according to strict building codes ? 
  hyatt regency hotel in kansas city, 
  what has obama ever done for civil liberties ? 
  who knows . 
  romney seems to be for or against _ [ name your issue ] _ depending on how the wind blows ... 
   in one priceless scene , as the officer interrogates bronson , the latter snarls , `` do you always violate people 's constitutional rights ? '', 
  it 's not clear whether this movie is supposed to be a comedy , but it succeeds surprisingly well on that level . 
  author seems to lack comprehension what constitutional rights are all about . 
  there 's nothing ironic in the above - cops are supposed to be constrained by the constitution , private vigilantes are not ... , 
  that 's what it 's called . 
  it the same kind of argument as socialists are making - `` ussr , china , cuba , etc. 
  are/were not real socialism ! '', 
   i find it interesting that countries that have more restrictions on guns tend to have lower gun violence rates . 
  sure , there was absolutely no gun violence in , say , xth century italy . 
  any particular reason you feel worse about the `` gun violence '' than the `` knife/club/hatchet violence '' ... ? 
  was jack the ripper the model of gentleman for not using guns ? 
  interesting ... so , neocons being descendents of trotskyites are therefore extreme far-left ?!, 
  i knew it !!, 
  ... pass the popcorn ... 
  they were both cops ... ? 
   cooper 's daughter told wpde-tv she did n't know what had happened to her mom until her friends filled her in . 
  `` they 're locking your momma up for cheering -- and i was like that is n't right because ** other people were cheering and they did n't lock them up ** , '' she said . 
  _ [ emphasis mine ] _, 
  does it mean , young lady , it would be ok to lock your momma up as long as others were locked up too ... ? 
  you gain some , you lose some ... , 
  why downvotes ? 
  that 's what the title says , after all ... 
  why ? 
   just bullies with badges, 
  hmmm ... is n't that a very definition of cops ? 
   war is not terror . 
  war is a tragedy .
