  war is ... 
  ... [ a racket . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_is_a_racket ), 
  the guy from france told me once you dudes do n't really speak proper french anyway , just some bastardized version of it ... , 
   if you had to decide between handcuffing a bunch of civilians and inconveniencing them for a couple hours , or an armed robber getting away/using this opportunity to attack civilians , what the fuck would you do ? 
  shoot them all and let god sort them out ... / s, 
  it 's really sad the police state mentality is taking hold in formerly free country ... :(, 
  i hope next time there will be some serious crime close to your place , you will not mind to be inconvenienced by a swat breaking down doors in your neighborhood ... 
  you were born too late , you 'd feel at home in nazi germany . 
   also , i will not yield to traffic going more than 10-15 mph over the speed limit ( with the exception of emergency vehicles ) because that is reckless behavior as well as a crime . 
  iow , you are an asshole who creates traffic hazards , just to show you are an asshole ... 
  i find laws like that absolutely repulsive : `` fine and suspended license '' for driving with levels that [ do n't cause any impairment ] ( http://www.brad21.org/effects_at_specific_bac.html ) ... 
  `` if you see yourself being passed on the right , you are in the wrong lane ... '', 
  should n't they pull over the asshole driving slowly in the left lane ... ? 
   even if someone does something wrong ( like driving to slow in the wrong lane ) it does n't justify breaking the rules, 
  so , dude can drive 30km/h in the leftmost lane and everybody has to follow at the same speed ? 
   zero tolerance on illegal immigration, 
  how are you going to enforce it without `` papieren , bitte ? '', 
  how many `` illegal '' immigrants get through the border at the checkpoints ... ? 
  what you are asking for is `` papieren , bitte '' for random people in the street . 
  nobody has a `` illegal alien '' sign on their foreheads , after all . 
  ok , so if some asshole is driving 30km/h in the leftmost lane , everybody should be doing 30 until the cops intervene ... ? 
  ... although she is not excessively shy about her tits ... , 
  [ sure .

  why vote ? 
  uhmm ... that was in 2004-2005 , was n't it before the big tax increase ? 
  cool ... you mean you are for punishing people for what others might do ... 
  yes . 
  much lesser , though ... 
  they forgot to ask khalid sheikh mohammed , no doubt he would confess ... , 
  [ it takes a lot of money to pay for a police state . 
   i 'd rather you be stolen from/taxed if it means his wife can be treated , than chip-in myself to help her ... 
  ftfy, 
  hmm ... kinda like unions demanding wisconsin governor change his policies or they will launch a recall ... 
  sure , and murdoch would have to get lotsa people to agree with him to have any effect on major 's election ... 
  nah , it was just snatched by mothra ... 
  sure , he is a republican but leaning libertarian . 
  basically , libertarians should view him as an ally , not an enemy . 
  they are not supposed to be total morons , though ( not to mention dishonest assholes . ), 
  if the dude has n't tried to stiff the girl , nobody would know ... 
   infringement on power of fbi ???!!!, 
  oh , so that 's just inter-gang squabble ... 
  so , you 'd rather have rapists and robbers fear no violence ? 
  are you one of those by any chance ? 
  horrible syntax ... ? 
  i did n't say it 's difficult , i 've said it 's horrible ... 
  well , i guess _ de gustibus non disputandum est _ ... some people even like cobol and/or basic ... 
  yes . 
  99.9 % of food is worse than tripe . 
  tripe rules !, 
   but with hardcore drugs , like alcohol , addicts become monsters who will do anything to get their fix . 
  ftfy, 
   so the ideal society is one where violent drug addicts and undertrained overarmed government thugs live in a constant war with one another . 
  no thanks . 
  i will advocate for laws that allow the government to do one of their most useless jobs - maintaining the war on drugs . 
  ftfy, 
   yes , the constitution is old and antiquated and we need an entirely new document . 
  one that establishes science , logic , and evidence based speech as the only free speech , one that does n't allow for guns , and one that guarantees health and education . 
  yup . 
  one like the late soviet union used to have . 
  ok . name them . 
  i was hoping the cop is in intensive care ... :(, 
  you are not making much sense . 
  how is their ( ss agents ' ) private behavior negatively impacting their job performance ? 
  yes , they were . 
  they were free lo leave ( at least till some point , ) unfortunately no one would have them . 
  is n't it the most favorite statists ' argument : `` if you do n't like it you can leave ... '', 
   r \\ libertarian has turned into r \\ republicanestablishment, 
  it has ? 
  and you base it on the post ( with only slightly over 50 % approval rating ) criticizing jon for criticizing romney based on his wealth ... 
  there 's plenty of things to criticize romney about , wealth is not one of them . 
  there 's a huge difference between `` defending '' and not falling for bullshit argument ... 
  if i were to tell you it 's bullshit to say obama is a muslim , would you accuse me of defending him ? 
   while paul came in a distant third in iowa 's january caucus behind rick santorum and romney, 
  uhmm ... santorum 24.6 % , romney 24.6 % , paul 21.9 % that 's ** distant ** third ? 
  nope . 
   i think that 's a bullshit argument . 
  sure it is . 
  i 'm not defending neocons either ... , 
  dunno ... what all the other poor do ? 
  you might try working , ferinstance ... 
  sure beats everybody else working for the poor ... 
  but no , nobody is `` required . '', 
  they have a choice - either work for someone else , work for yourself or rely on charity . 
  pretty much all they can choose now , except having a state steal from others to give to them . 
  but , otoh , the state would not prohibit them from working or starting a business like it often does now . 
   the government never learned that government does n't work , while some people did learn . 
  ftfy, 
   get rid of the very idea that skin color has any more importance than hair color, 
  yeah , right . 
  next you will be sayin ' gingers are not evil ... , 
  dude , it 's reddit !, 
  you are not allowed to even hint something positive about kochs ... , 
   i want to be a space cop, 
  _ two by two , hands of blue ... _, 
  you mean we need one party government ? 
   obama is the lesser of the two main-party evils . 
   how so ? 
  he 's only have 4 more years .
