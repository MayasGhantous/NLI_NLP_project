  romney , should he win , would be a danger for possible 8 ... 
  they could well be saying their guys have less fat ... 
  guess , they wrote tickets to the wrong people ... 
  he 's son 's ? 
  ... lighter skin ? 
  so , what the hell were you doing ? 
  sure it did . 
  where would atf be without it ? 
  mafia would still be just a bunch of local thugs and kennedy family would n't even dream of being a political powerhouse ... , 
   i would immediately lose all respect for roberts . 
  you had any ? 
  i have yet to encounter a government agency that did n't complain of being underfunded ... 
  may i have some of what you are smoking ... ? 
  well , except that is not how the most of the downvotes are awarded . 
  if you stick to the reddiquette you are karma-punished , if you care about such things ... 
   please show me examples of countries that have been allowed to secede . 
  belarus , estonia , georgia , kazakhstan , lithuania , latvia , norway , ukraine ... for starters . 
   civil rights are simply rights granted to people by the state . 
  now i believe all rights are civil rights, 
  interesting ... so , if the state does n't grant jews the right to not to go into the ovens , they have no grounds to complain ... 
  [ `` by virtue of '' ] ( http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/by+virtue+of ) is an idiomatic expression , meaning `` because of '', 
  i 'm pretty sure if they put it on the food channel it would be highest rating show there too ... 
  just because you are undereducated does n't make the joke unfunny ... 
   because right wing authoritarians do n't know how to have fun and think no one else should either, 
  but left-wing authoritarians do ? 
  you stutter ? 
   what you are calling for is a violent uprising . 
  that is not the way of liberty . 
  it may sound like a good idea on the outside , but it 's really not - and it 's not the way to fix our countries problems . 
  it ( kinda ) worked once here ( for a while , at least ) ... anyways , have some other ideas ? 
  voting does n't seem to work , as you probably noticed ... 
  the problem with voting is : the system is rigged . 
  the ideas of third parties never make it into the mainstream and the third party candidates have huge barriers to overcome before they even appear on the ballot . 
  not to mention nobody will hear about them and they have snowflake in hell chance of making it to the debates ... 
  really ? 
  guess selective memory/perception is a blessing ... 
  it 's kinda reverse of the poe 's law : they try to mock and end up endorsing ... , 
  he still has a chance if romney gets caught in bed with a dead girl or a live boy ... 
  you would be surprised how certain `` incentives '' can convince the infirm and the old to work ... 
  why do you want somebody to rule ? 
  can not imagine life without massah ? 
   how do you plan on things being organized ? 
  what `` things ? '', 
  most of the `` things '' manage to get `` organized '' without the involvement of any rulers . 
  ever heard of the voluntary cooperation ? 
  if you go back in time , even more `` things '' used to be `` organized '' without the involvement of the government . 
  the overbearing , nanny ( or rather nasty step dad ) - state is a pretty recent invention ... 
   and if would help if you could avoid the insults . 
  insults ? 
  you think your ruler is going to be insulted by the `` massah '' label ? 
   if you want to engage in an exchange of nasty comments i can do that as well . 
  as you demonstrate over and over again ... 
  it may even make some good points , but it 's written in the `` stream of consciousness '' style that is very painful to read ... 
   so you can imagine 7 million people in the nyc area with no government . 
  sure , why not ? 
   all relationships are independent of any set of rules ( except the nap ) . 
  no rulers does n't imply no rules . 
  people adhere to lots of rules all the time and only seldom are those rules backed by the threat of the rulers ' wrath . 
  and even when they are , most people would follow them anyway , if they are rules that make sense . 
  obviously , rules that make no sense ( not unusual with the governments ) would not be followed ... at least not by the most of the people . 
   the historical golden age when there was less government involvement, 
  i do n't know who are you talking to , i have never said anything about any `` golden ages . '', 
  but it 's an obvious fact the governments in the past did n't meddle so much in everyday life they do now . 
  the way governments justified themselves used to be ( roughly in that order ) `` we have the might to kill you '' -  `` we have the divine mandate ( and the might to kill you ) '' -  `` we have the majority vote ( and the might to kill you ) '' -  `` we provide the crucial services ( and have the might to kill you ) '' ... 
   never mind , go and play with yourself, 
  you are funny guy ( s ? ), 
  matts , you start with condescending and inflammatory comment and then get butt-hurt i call your ruler `` massah '' ... 
  but he did have a plurality ... not unusual even today in most countries to have minority governments . 
   i mean , it 'd be like finding out that bush really did execute 9/11 . 
  cheney , more likely ... , 
  let me get it straight : the oppressive , totalitarian soviet union let some of their republics peacefully secede , yet you believe freedom loving america would be justified to slaughter people willing to do the same ? 
  are you also an advocate of beating the wife into submission if she were to demand divorce ? 
   windows phone users, 
  all 5 of them ? 
  that 's how it seemed to me ... 
   new hampshire 's 5 % flat income tax applies only to dividend and interest income . 
  they are already pretty much banned , you dimwit ... 
  wow !, 
  another asshole heard from !, 
  so , you 'd rather see a girl raped and strangled in an alley than see her having a gun . 
  are you a rapist/murderer by any chance ? 
  if not , why are you hell bend on making rape/murder safe for them ? 
  the `` demigod '' seems to be quite popular literary device since humanity started writing . 
  guess you must really hate homer ... , 
  btw i can not really think of any real life example of bunch of mediocrities achieving something extraordinary ... 
  dunno ... so did clinton . 
  talked a good talk but did n't walk the walk ... 
   comcast is a natural monopoly, 
  if by `` natural '' you mean `` government granted in some areas '' then yes ... 
  now they saying he was a [ swede and a former gitmo guest ] ( http://worldnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/07/19/12834861-report-ex-gitmo-detainee-suspected-as-bulgaria-suicide-bomber?lite&amp;__utma=14933801.2144257457.1342393305.1342706203.1342718752.17&amp;__utmb=14933801.8.10.1342718752&amp;__utmc=14933801&amp;__utmx=-&amp;__utmz=14933801.1342393305.1.1.utmcsr=%28direct%29 | utmccn = % 28direct % 29 | utmcmd = % 28none % 29 & __ utmv = 14933801 . | 8 = earned % 20by = msnbc | cover = 1 ^ 12 = landing % 20content = mixed = 1 ^ 13 = landing % 20hostname =www.nbcnews.com = 1 ^ 30 = visit % 20type % 20to % 20content = earned % 20to % 20mixed = 1 & __ utmk = 153326008 ) ... 
  you have to excuse the dude , he swims after eating ... , 
  that 's what it says now . 
  it said the opposite when i posted it ... 
  if you hover over the link you can still see the original title ... 
   i find most americans have the opinion that usa is the greatest country in the world, 
  well , most canadians have the opinion canada is the greatest country in the world ... as this thread testifies . 
  yeah !, 
  we need equal opportunity police state !, 
  think how many more cool wars could the governments wage with all that money !, 
  why not ?
