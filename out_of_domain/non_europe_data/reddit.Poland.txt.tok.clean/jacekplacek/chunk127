   [ a clich\u00e9 or cliche ( uk / \u02c8kli\u02d0\u0283e\u026a / or us / kl\u026a\u02c8\u0283e\u026a / ) is an expression , idea , or element of an artistic work which has been overused to the point of losing its original meaning or effect , especially when at some earlier time it was considered meaningful or novel .

  well , well ... 
  it would certainly be very nice if such sentiments became clich\u00e9s ... 
   seastead advocates ** are not crazed anarchists against government ** . 
  they are promoting new forms of governance . 
  [ ... ] the law of the sea treaty might hinder seasteading . 
  in their paper , `` charting the course : toward a seasteading legal strategy , '' dario mutabdzija and max borders warn that lost 's declaration that ocean resources are the `` common heritage of mankind , '' backed by the provision which ** bars subjecting `` any part of the high seas '' to state sovereignty ** , `` could be one of the most formidable obstacles seasteaders face while creating permanent societies at sea ( at least societies that are outside the auspices of established governments ) . '' [ _ emphasis mine _ ], 
  perhaps not being `` crazed anarchists against government '' hinders such efforts ... , 
  i would be rather reluctant joining - `` the new forms of governance , '' how the hell do i know it wo n't become some variation on the same `` old form of governance ? '', 
  [ power plants | steel mills | car factories | chip foundries | refineries | you name it ] are incredibly big investments that take a long time to pay off . 
  should the government step in here ? 
  how do you know fluidkarma is a libertarian ? 
  he does n't sound like one to me . 
  do you blame liberals/conservatives for every stupid thing one of them ever said ? 
   that does n't change the fact that they still existed . 
  that does n't change the fact nobody gave a fuck if some schmuck wanted to cross from one side to the other . 
  they only cared about the armies ... 
   what the fuck ? 
  you do n't know what the fuck i was talking about . 
  i wonder if you do ... 
   yes , dumbass , for as long as the country has existed there have been poor citizens who will do low-skilled labor . 
  this is true for every country . 
  no dumbass . 
  if there were enough `` poor citizens '' willing to pick strawberries the mexicans would n't come here . 
  they do n't go to belize ... 
   many of those groups are actually hate groups any way you put it, 
  sure . 
  if you go around naming every group a hate group , you are bound to nail actual haters as well ... 
   it simply is not ethical or cost effective to have millions of people all deciding what is most important based on their own patchy and incomplete knowledge . 
  is it more ethical to leave the decision to the politicians , who may or may not have better knowledge and whose interests lie with the lobbyists/donors much more than with general public ? 
   will you not dial 911 if you need help, 
  absolutely not . 
  i 'm 56 and in my entire life there was not one instance i felt the presence of cops would improve the situation . 
  well , mostly i am with you . 
  nevertheless , in the last shooting the cop shot the perp dead , thus `` solving '' the problem ... 
  sikh temple . 
  would n't accepting the subpoena and than refusing to indict , be a more effective approach ? 
   he 's very likely a psychopath, 
  are n't most of politicians ? 
  i think we use the word in very similar sense . 
  i do n't distinguish between socio/psychopathy - imo they are the same , perhaps the difference in degree ... 
  there 's considerable evidence the psychopaths are especially drawn to the politics , be it state or corporate one , and they are uniquely predisposed to succeed there . 
  thus my belief they form the majority of the political class . 
  no strong evidence for any particular one , though . 
  still have my ( subjective ) feelings about some of them ... , 
  somehow you statists have no problem buying ipads and groceries from private businesses ... 
  well , before they started torturing her , they would be simple burglars . 
  you can not defend your property with deadly force . 
  when they bound and torture her , it was quite too late for trying to do anything ... 
  it 's a vicious circle . 
  businesses plead for favors , gvt gets more powerful , businesses need to buy more favors ... 
  society is already `` plastered with cameras . '', 
  it 's not going to change . 
  the only thing we can do is to ensure the state does n't have an advantage ... 
  all governments are corrupt . 
   the theater house lights were illuminated as officers entered . 
  patrons were told to raise their hands and file from the theater . 
  as they exited they were patted down and escorted outside . 
  land of the free ... / s, 
  not that long ago such a scene was only conceivable in a movie about nazis or soviets ... 
   can i no longer go to a funeral and say , `` this guy was an asshole '' without fear of arrest ? 
  only if the dead dude was in military ... , 
  the jury seemed to be retarded ... 
  rush, 
   if he had just run on a third party ticket he 'd still be in the race now . 
  ... and nobody would know about him ... 
  how is it a voter fraud ? 
  well , for every ponzi scheme there is a point the new participants have to lose ... 
  you mean he tried to pass 1oz silver piece as a quarter ? 
  what a cheat !, 
  he would never make it into the debates and you know it perfectly well . 
  dunno ... he called it `` liberty dollar '' , kinda reasonable . 
  also reasonable to put lady liberty on it . 
  i do n't believe anyone would really mistake it for a quarter . 
  his notes , btw , were not even remotely similar to the frns . 
  perhaps because it never happened before ... msm refusing to put 3rd party names in their polls could have something to do with it too . 
  live and let live . 
  nap is just saying : `` hey , do n't kill me and i will not kill you . '', 
  you may agree or not - it 's up to you . 
  if you do you may call yourself a libertarian , if you do n't you are not a libertarian . 
  that 's why it 's called a `` principle '' not a `` contract . '', 
  uhmm ... lady liberty is kinda universally recognized symbol of liberty . 
  if you look at all us government issued coins , you would really have a hard time putting ** anything ** on your coin . 
  oh , comon , they obviously are trying to counterfeit the [ alaska ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:2008_ak_proof.png ) quarter ... / s, 
  yeah , i know . 
  the panda is right-handed while the grizzly let-handed . 
  that 's the ** major ** difference ... / s, 
  so , are ozzies or canucks `` counterfeiting '' our precious currency ? 
   gun buy-back, 
  oh , how cute !, 
  you still believe in the power of petitions ... ? 
  silly rabbit ... 
  i only buy canadian gas !, 
   patrons were told to raise their hands and file from the theater . 
  they were all trespassers ? 
   those who think all gun carries are innocent people being abused by the menacing police officers, 
  kinda funny from the dude who does n't mind full theater of the people ** not carrying ** , being abused by the menacing police officers ... 
   i ca n't see how you can logically argue that searching a theater in which an unknown suspect was spotted with a firearm is unreasonable . 
  how can you argue it 's reasonable ?
