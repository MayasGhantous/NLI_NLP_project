   he allegedly did not comply with the officers ' commands,

  uk - sure , but they had lotsa help from the greedy capitalist us , when that ended so did their `` prosperity '' ... and yugoslavia was the most free market of the eastern block .

  hmmm ... let 's see : obama did bailout banksters ( the rich ) while the poor are losing their homes ... so , his rhetoric notwithstanding , he is a pretty good friend for the rich . 
   they are also accompanied by an enormous amount of visible light . 
  i was just hoping we have a superman on reddit ... , 
  whining is not gon na get you anywhere ... 
   it can only possibly build software for windows,

  if you do n't link in standard libraries that use os services you can build an os-independent executable .

   you think there 's thousands of potential mass murderers who would slaughter an entire race of people if they could and destroy the entire continent ?
