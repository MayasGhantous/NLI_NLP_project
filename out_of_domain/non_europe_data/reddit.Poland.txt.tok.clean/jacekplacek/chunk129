   but it is also incorrect to assume that every government statement is a lie, 
  it might not be ** always ** correct , but it 's a very safe bet ... 
  maine being much smaller state , your vote there will have more impact . 
  also there might be lots of maine voters going libertarian because of rnc shenanigans ... iow , gary has a better chance in maine than in ny and your vote can accomplish more there . 
  well , since obama is likely to win , we may have chance to see for ourselves in 2016 ...  imo , it will be about the same as romney 's america . 
  i would be really worried if il duce said something nice about ron paul ... , 
  they do n't want to be droned themselves ? 
   do n't carry mace ( i ` ts illegal ), 
  `` better be judged by 12 than carried by 6 . '', 
  let me guess : greece does n't allow guns for self defense ? 
  then he is dead and can not kill me ... 
  why ? 
  you are concerned about safety of nazis killing minorities ? 
   guns always help the attacker , not the defendant . 
  it 's a good thing [ this ] ( http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/28/13526604-armed-customer-shoots-dollar-store-robber-killing-him?lite ) dude did n't know that . 
  otherwise he ( and the store clerk ) could be dead by now ... 
  unfortunately in canada if it `` can be used as a weapon '' effectively , it 's illegal . 
   usually robbers do n't kill people , just , you know , rob them, 
  [ that so ? 
  ] ( http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/05cius/offenses/expanded_information/data/shrtable_09.html ), 
   he was the aggressor, 
  you have quite peculiar definition of an aggressor ... anyways , if the victims of the nazi murderers were n't denied means of self defense , they could become `` aggressors '' and kill the assholes whenever they came to kill them, 
  just curious , how did you react when she pointed out to you all the lies obama said ... ? 
  so , how many cells make a baby ? 
  do n't worry , krugman will explain that republican congress did n't let obama stimulate enough ... 
   yes but what happens if one company gets a monopoly on all the groceries ? 
  they can charge way more than is necessary since people wo n't stop eating and will just suck extra money out of people 's pockets . 
  ftfy, 
  somewhat obscure for the younguns out there :, 
  _ jos\u00e9 jim\u00e9nez _ : `` people of the united states of america ... please , do n't let them do this to me ... '', 
  perhaps , perhaps not . 
  we could be kinda like the inhabitants of a remote island looking for smoke signals and listening for the drums ... 
   the real technical challenge with this though is carrying around enough fuel to be able to maintain 1g acceleration for any extended period of time . 
  hmm ... there 's a lot of mass defect in d + t -  he ... 
  anybody up to calculating for how long can the mass of d + t maintain its acceleration of 1g ? 
  assuming the mass of the rocket being insignificant and , let 's say , 50 % efficient fusion engine . 
  the point you are missing : vote for romney sends gop the signal they can do whatever they want to libertarian wing of the party and still win the elections . 
  vote for gary sends them a strong signal - `` you fuck with us we will fuck with you . '', 
   romney is a better choice than obama . 
  says who ? 
   but it does n't help turn the 4 or 5 or 6 % of the vote you have into anything more . 
  actually , it does . 
  if romney loses by a small margin . 
   `` you fuck with us we will fuck with you . '', 
  sounds like a fascist slogan at best . 
  it certainly is at odds with the nap that libertarians claim to support . 
  how is that ? 
  nap is not nrp ( non retaliation principle ) . 
   and those people who voted romney turn and see the 4 or 5 or 6 % and think `` we would have won if they voted with the gop , so next time i 'm voting libertarian ! '' ? 
  no , i 'm not talking about voters . 
  i 'm talking about party echelons . 
  when they see the votes going to gary they might decide to change their policies to placate the libertarians . 
   they `` fucked with you '' because the overwhelming majority wanted romney instead of paul as the candidate ? 
  that is n't `` fucking '' with you . 
  that is `` disagreeing '' with you . 
  you know perfectly well what i mean . 
  them breaking their own rules and outright cheating to screw the paul delegates , that 's what i mean by `` fucking with us . '', 
  despite paul not being a real threat to romney at this time . 
  iow they say to paul voters `` you will not be heard in the primaries . '', 
  is it any wonder we want to say to them `` guess what . 
  we will be heard in general elections instead . 
  and you are not going to like it . '', 
  really ? 
  bush enters the classroom at 9:01 the second plane hits at 9:03 , at 9:05 card approaches bush in the classroom telling him the second plane hit . 
  when is bush supposed to see the impact ? 
  of course obama 's good for ** his ** business . 
  with people making less money discount stores are booming ... , 
  [ more ] people making less money they did before bush/obama ... ( and yes , there 's precious little difference , they both serve the same masters ), 
   when we allowed those checkpoints, 
  speak for yourself . 
  i never allowed such a thing and nobody ever asked me . 
  i did ? 
  must have been drunk ... , 
  `` ladies and gentlemen of the jury . 
  my client did n't really mean to burglarize the brown 's residence . 
  what he meant was to burglarize the smith 's residence down the street but got confused about the address . '', 
   if you 're driving on i95 through a major city , going 100 miles an hour is a bit more haphazard than if you were doing it in rural arizona . 
  depends on time of the day , the weather , the traffic , the car and the driver ... btw the states with 65 speed limit do n't care if it 's in the boonies - the revenue is too good ... 
   real freedom comes from being disconnected from the random risks of life . 
  til the prison inmates are the freest of all the people ... 
  nope . 
  it 's massah making sure all the slaves are productive ... 
  common sense : old grandma in her old clunker doing 65 in heavy traffic during a snowstorm is driving safe , dale earnhardt jr. in a brand new bimmer doing 75 on a sunny sunday morning is not ... / s, 
   then you have to deal with the fact that when accidents do happen ( and they will , inevitably ) , they 're going to be far more devestating resulting in more injuries , loss of life , damage to other nearby vehicles ( such as those in oncoming lanes across medians from flying debris ) and property damage if the vehicles involved were traveling 90 instead of 70 . 
  great , just set the speed limit on the interstates to 20 . 
  there will be almost no accidents !, 
  guess you would n't mind if your government told you what you can and can not eat . 
  it 's common sense to eat healthy after all ... 
  baaaaa ... 
   had to find a job and start a new life . 
  is n't that ** why ** he came to the us ... ? 
  logic is logic . 
  either you got it or you did n't . 
  dunno ... guess it depends on what your goals in life are . 
  actually , i believe the time i spent in school/college was a waste - i was bored out of my mind most of the time ( with a few exceptions . ), 
  hmm ... romney gets caught boinking an underage boy and obama is exposed as a kgb sleeper agent ? 
  hell , [ one can dream ] ( http://www.amazon.com/hope-aaron-zelman/dp/0964230453 ) ... , 
  edit : apostrophe, 
   do you think it is moral or acceptable for a person to seek out and kill someone who murdered that person 's family member or friend ? 
  or , in other words , do you believe that you lose the `` right to live '' if you murder someone ?
