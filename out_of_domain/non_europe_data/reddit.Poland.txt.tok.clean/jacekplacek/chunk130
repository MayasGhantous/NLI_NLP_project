  absolutely !, 
   how police officers somehow disconnect from humanity and treat those they come in contact with such cruelty is beyond me . 
  you might want to read [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stanford_prison_experiment ) or see the movie [ das experiment ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/das_experiment ) , loosely based on same . 
  she knows jizz when she sees it ... , 
   how do you walk and breath simultaneously ? 
  who said he/she/it does ? 
  really what ? 
  i have no idea if the entity in question is a human or a bot . 
  and if human what gender . 
   but by calling someone `` it '' you 're reducing them to an object, 
  but what if the troll in question ** is ** a bot ? 
  is `` it '' offensive to a bot too ? 
  and btw who says you should not offend a troll ? 
   i have no idea why you think that the troll is a bot . 
  i did n't say that . 
  just acknowledging the possibility ( however slim . ), 
   use oppressive language, 
  listen , if you really believe the language can be oppressive , you live a very sheltered life . 
  language can be many things - rude , insulting , vulgar , insensitive , etc but you can not oppress anybody by language alone ... 
  the act of oppression does n't depend on the language used , plenty of oppressors have been using very polite and gentle language . 
   you are trying to rationalize your for hatred of police through 4 examples that occurred over a span of 30 years in different departments from around the country, 
  go to [ r/bad _ cop_no_donut ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/bad_cop_no_donut/ ) and you will have as many fucking examples as you wish - just scroll down till you have enough . 
  why do you keep insisting i thought the troll might be non-gender conforming ? 
  i 've already told you the `` it '' was ( tongue-in-cheek ) for a possible bot . 
  you just seem to want to assume the meaning you find offensive ... 
   have you considered the assholes and dregs of society they have to deal with ? 
  have you considered that maybe you are the asshole for calling people `` dregs of society ? '', 
   its really not surprising they snap sometimes . 
  really ? 
  that tells a lot about you ... do you also excuse husbands who `` snap sometimes '' and beat the shit out of the nagging wife ? 
   like do you mean homeless as in staying temporarily with friends or like homeless a bum on the street sleeping under an overhang ? 
  [ even a bum can have ] ( http://www.istockphoto.com/stock-photo-10756863-homeless-man-on-a-laptop.php ) [ a laptop ] ( http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://cisconinjanc.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/homeless-man-goes-online14.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://cisconinjanc.wordpress.com/category/ccie/&amp;h=356&amp;w=500&amp;sz=41&amp;tbnid=exo8khtfzxgxpm:&amp;tbnh=90&amp;tbnw=126&amp;zoom=1&amp;usg=__nzgfmeme_km99ciqrufvmf-cvdw=&amp;docid=tyvvw_-fw07him&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=xbpnum7imabp0ggeuicqag&amp;ved=0ccsq9qewaw&amp;dur=627 ), 
  uhmm ... by the same definition , so are you . 
  sure , why not ... next : licensing pedestrians . 
  hmmm ... did the other 99.9 % sign the petition endorsing the official story ? 
  how many did ? 
  definitely !, 
  they should check themselves into the `` free speech zone \u2122 '' ... / s, 
  hmmm ... 
  i guess [ those ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=deserted+highways&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=vyf&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-us:official&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=nmrtuogdkons9qt5j4gqda&amp;ved=0ccaqsaq&amp;biw=1197&amp;bih=858 ) will see rapid business expansions anytime now . 
  it 's inevitable !, 
  nope . 
  federal government ( not `` we '' ) built the interstate system to move tanks and other military vehicles more efficiently . 
   oh so businesses did n't pay any taxes that were used for that ? 
  yup . 
  if you get mugged and a mugger builds an orphanage , will you say `` we built it ? '', 
  freedom of speech means you have a right to voice your opinions , no matter how idiotic . 
  it does not mean we have to accept them . 
  they could . 
  not gon na happen . 
  hmm ... what if mafia really provided protection ? 
  the perfect is the enemy of the good ... gary might not be perfect , still he is much better than any other candidate . 
  yup . 
  all those ditches dug and filled added to the gdp ... 
   a proxy-based direct democracy is the closest this we have to maximizing utility since each vote serves as a proxy for voters ' utility and the outcome maximizes this utility . 
  let 's see ... so , if the overwhelming majority says they want all the jews to go into ovens , you would n't have any problem with that ? 
   early muslims were told to directly to chop the heads off of whole villages by their founder, 
  _ now go and strike amalek and devote to destruction all that they have . 
  do not spare them , but kill both man and woman , and infant , ox and sheep , camel and donkey . _ ( ** 1 sam . 
  forgot to take your meds ? 
  hmm ... if that 's the case you , surely , agree that libertarianism ( as the obvious deviation from the ` norm ' ) is a disease ... , 
  since when is ` negro ' offensive ? 
   the islamic republic and grand ayatollah were a reactionary response to american and british intervention , this is true , but saying we were the ones who put them in power is fucking stupid . 
  it 's called `` blowback '' ... 
   however , not every one of them is inhabited . 
  therefore , there must be a finite number of inhabited worlds . 
  does not follow ... not every number is a prime number , does n't mean there is only a finite number of prime numbers . 
  and scratched furniture does n't ? 
  he ( mistakenly ) believes you could be educated ... 
   as with most of america 's darker elements , such as its gun culture, 
  actually , yes , we did ( or rather the people in the government did . ), 
  but it had nothing to do with our involvement in the war ... 
   either there is an obvious bias against women in the market and in our culture , or it 's somehow women 's fault that they 're not becoming ceo 's . 
  take your pick . 
  or , perhaps , women just do n't find being ceos that important ... 
  why are they issues ? 
  if ( for example ) gay man find it much more to their liking to go into fashion business than straight men , is that an issue ? 
  do you believe there should be affirmative action for straight men in the fashion industry ? 
  i know , he is dead . 
  that 's why . 
  ( you can substitute any name you like , the only condition it has to be a dead person . ), 
   the statement he made was that objects capable of producing extinction level events are likely to provide only seconds of warning . 
  nope . 
  he said `` the odds are . '', 
  which is undeniably true ... , 
  uhmm ... there are always [ odds ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/odds ) , they might be very slim but , technically , he was right . 
  just buy some cocaine ... 
  karma is a bitch ... ? 
  what ? 
  there 's no room in american prisons ? 
  just let the potheads out - problem solved . 
  ok , let them loose in congress - let the congresscritters deal with it ... , 
   you 're saying the republicans give entitlement spending ? 
  have i woke up in an alternate universe where reagan put up medicare , unemployment , welfare , and the like ? 
  well , dubya did expand medicare ... 
   no state had the capabilities, 
  really ? 
  no state has the `` capabilities '' to detain 166 people ? 
  they already have over 2 million prisoners , but can not spare room for 166 more ... do you even read what you are writing or are you a bot ? 
  hey , i would buy one .
