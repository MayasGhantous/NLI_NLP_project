  there 's 82 states in north america . 
  only 50 of them are usa members ... 
   what am i missing ? 
  but you are right about hawaii , i should n't have counted it ... , 
  did n't want you to whine canadian provinces are not states so i counted canada as one state ... 
  are you retarded ? 
   if you snort marijuana , you instantly die, 
  well , if you ** snort ** marijuana , you may simply choke to death ... , 
  maybe not willingly ... 
  because libertarians believe in liberty for everybody , including their political opponents ... liberty to read whatever one chooses and refuse to talk to whomever one does n't want to talk to included . 
  real question is what are ** you ** doing here ... 
  apparently , she is not only not being accused of the above , she has been granted immunity from it ... she is being persecuted solely for refusing to talk . 
  your position is more in tune with neoconservatism than nap ... 
  [ duck type ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duck_typing ), 
  you mean you are just another pol-pot ... ? 
  no , you advocate killing off the class of people you deem `` oppressors '' and that 's exactly what pol-pot did ... 
  what does it have to do with / r/libertarian ? 
  that 's true . 
  yet , with productivity gains in the last century or so , earning a living should n't be a lifetime occupation ... ponder [ this ] ( http://www.ncc-1776.org/tle2000/libe76-20000612-06.html ) . 
  sure . 
  he has nothing against people funding whatever they like ... 
  why would we care ? 
  romney 's track record shows he is about as conservative as obama ... if you republicans really wanted to win , you should n't have picked white obama - race is not gon na be such a big factor . 
  you mean it 's ok to murder hundreds of thousands of civilians if it 's expedient ... 
   the amish are the state . 
  okay , so they do n't use guns . 
  great . 
  but they are forcing people out of the community, 
  nope . 
  they are not the state , they are a voluntary society . 
  they are not `` forcing '' anybody out . 
  they just stop associating with the ones who do n't follow the rules . 
  so , how are they ** not ** libertarian ? 
  do they collect taxes ? 
  do they imprison people ? 
  do they conscript armies and wage wars on others ? 
  ( beard-cutting incident notwithstanding ... , 
  everyone in the amish society is there ** voluntarily ** and they all ** chose ** to join when they become adults . 
   voluntary communalism is still communalism . 
  ... and not contrary to the libertarian principles ... 
   i can post in any far fetched thread i want . 
  you sure can . 
  but you are only embarrassing yourself ... 
   and they also refuse to use electronics on religious grounds . 
  that 's their choice . 
  his father was not a combatant either . 
  he was just a loudmouth with the message our rulers did n't like . 
   romney has killed exactly zero people . 
  but he 's already promised to kill a lot ... 
  well , to follow your logic , hitler never killed a single jew ... 
  it is kinda sad in a funny way how americans , who used to be pretty brave , freedom loving folks , become a bunch of sniveling cowards , so afraid of medieval peasants on the other side of the globe that they gladly beg their rulers to take away their liberties ... 
  ironically , repugnicans lead the way ... 
  stalin ? 
  we have a choice !, 
   its unfortunate your not bright enough, 
  my what not bright enough ? 
  not speaking english too well ? 
  putting words in your mouth ? 
  how so ? 
  [ i 'm a bit older ... ] ( http://www.imdb.com/media/rm1963502080/nm0518178 ), 
  how do you know she is missing her period ? 
  looks like us is turning into east germany ... 
  so , you pretty much saying exactly what judge did ... ? 
  hmm ... you might be onto something ... we sure do resemble german democratic republic more every year ... 
  there 's plenty of non-nato countries on the mediterranean ... not to mention it 's a short route to the atlantic . 
   black squirrels are abundant in battle creek , michigan and according to legend were first introduced there by will keith kellogg , founder of the kellogg company , in an effort to destroy the local population of red squirrels . 
  why would anybody want to destroy red ones ? 
   no election has been decided by one vote, 
  2000 election . 
  but you had to be a supreme court justice for your vote to matter ... , 
  gates ? 
  buffet ? 
  soros ? 
   please people lets talk about politics not why pot will save america . 
  it 's not that `` pot will save america . '', 
  it 's war on pot ( and poverty , and terrorism , and etc. ), 
  that will destroy her . 
  actually , no matter who wins we are still getting metric fucktonnes of shit for the foreseeable future , till the whole circus collapses ... and most likely even more after that . 
   the storekeeper gets the message and agrees to sell the wheat for that he paid for it and everyone gets through the winter . 
  yup . 
  and a few years later , when another disaster strikes , the some storekeeper will not put up the money for the extra food ( remembering it will only result in the townsfolks threatening to lynch him ) and the half of the town will starve ... 
  neither honest nor convincing . 
  not to mention it does n't even answer the question - not voting for a democrat does n't mean voting for a republican . 
  you , arguably , provided a reason to not to vote republican , not a reason to vote democrat ... 
  should n't that be `` elementary , my dear watson ? '', 
  you have town a hit by a disaster . 
  people need stuff and there 's not enough . 
  there 's town b close by that has more stuff . 
  first scenario : prices are fixed . 
  whoever gets first to the source gets stuff . 
  the rest die . 
  the people of town b will help a little if they are very charitable and can spare time/money . 
  second scenario : prices are market driven . 
  people of town b see the prices of stuff in town a skyrocket . 
  many of them see the opportunity and load their pickups with stuff town a needs . 
  the rich bastards of town a are the first to buy the newly arrived stuff until they have enough . 
  then the prices start falling ( read up on supply and demand . ), 
  more people from town a can afford to buy stuff . 
  the really poor can still get some stuff from the charitable dudes , hey , even the rich bastards might realize they have more than they need and share - everybody is happier in the end . 
  are you ?
