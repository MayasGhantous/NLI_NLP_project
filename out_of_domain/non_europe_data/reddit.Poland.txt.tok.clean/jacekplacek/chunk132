  well , you did see op there so it 's not such a far-fetched idea ... 
   they 'll still make billions from cocaine and other drugs, 
  ... unless they are legalized too ... 
  do n't rely on the fda , just sue the bastards who sold it to you and the bastards who imported it . 
  better yet , get all the owners of affected pets together and launch class action . 
   the problem is , people who do not vote really believe that voting does not matter . 
  sure . 
  me ferinstance . 
  for the last half century or so it was the choice between tweedledee and tweedledum ... it still is . 
   most of them want nothing to do with society in general . 
  not quite . 
  i just do n't want nothing to do with generals in society . 
  any reason you and your neighbors do n't just grab chainsaws and clear it yourselves ? 
  hmm ... but bunch of goat herders was competent enough ? 
  dunno about that ... the perpetrators themselves would , obviously , keep silent , the others who figure it out/have suspicions would simply be branded nuts/truthers/conspiracy theorists ... 
  what about a choice between rotten ham sandwich on the molded rye and turkey sandwich with maggots on the rotten wheat ? 
  well , ca n't do . 
  i will not sign into youtube ... 
   everyone else goes out of business because of the unsustainable low prices, 
  somehow , the big bad monopolist walmart failed to achieve this ... how come ? 
  methinks you mean `` a part '' ... , 
   also , go mix gasoline with regular plastic used in home depot buckets and report back here with your findings . 
  actually , those buckets are designed to hold paint/paint thinners and are quite ok to hold gasoline as well ... 
  [ sure .

  [ in the late 1980s , the constituent republics of the soviet union started legal moves towards potentially declaring sovereignty over their territories , citing article 72 of the ussr constitution , which stated that any constituent republic was free to secede . 
  on 7 april 1990 , a law was passed allowing a republic to secede if more than two-thirds of its residents voted for it in a referendum . 
  many held their first free elections in the soviet era for their own national legislatures in 1990 .

  sorry , forgot to quote ... 
  it was in response to :, 
   even in 2014 it 's highly unlikely that you 'll see desktop environments utilizing that many threads, 
  kookyguy 's dictionary :, 
  _ immature _ : being able to refute my argument with citations . 
  tomorrow ? 
  not today ? 
  hmm ... interesting - the quote is a variation on some biblical quotes and was used over the ages by many people , some of them considered quite wise . 
  i guess it must have struck the nerve ... , 
  you have to click on `` show all candidates '' right now gary has just 0.2 % :(,

  then why colin fucking powell endorsed obama ? 
  funny , he said '' [ obama ] got us out of one war '' , the war his ass was responsible for getting us into ... 
  that 's not what [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/universal_disk_format ) says ... 
  so , simple enough correction of the standard would resolve the issue ? 
   there is nothing approaching an actual `` anarcho '' - capitalist movement nor will there ever be among common working people, 
  stop the press !, 
  anarchistic , anti-collectivist individualists do n't have a movement !,

  oh , for fuck sake , lighten up ... you do n't have to take offense to everything . 
  it 's a fucking joke , even if a bad one . 
  i never said it did happen ... and it 's a stupid joke - the most ( only ? ), 
  funny thing about it is the reactions of people like you ... , 
  there 's still lot of people who are fed-up but decided to vote for the lesser evil anyways ... 
  when one shoots the missile up your ass , you will know ...

  perhaps the same way it did [ before 1930 's ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_emergency_management_agency#history ) ... ? 
  notice how the government `` help '' back then consisted of `` extending the time they had for remitting tariffs on imported goods . '', 
  what 's really sad about it , romney had no snowball-in-hell chance of winning ca . 
  if they voted for gary maybe obama/democrats would think again before raiding mj places next time ...

  well , it 's a lie japan does n't have a [ welfare system ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_welfare_in_japan#public_assistance ) ... 
   also , if we actually enforced the laws , and made it ( gasp ! ), 
  difficult for illegal aliens to find legitimate work , they would n't come . 
  again , we simply have n't done that . 
  oh , you mean `` expand the police state '' ... you are using this word `` libertarian . '', 
  i do n't think it means what you think it means . 
   somalia is the perfect example of where a market for justice has failed to form . 
  there is a cultural ( in this case religious ) predisposition for a society which does not respect non-aggression . 
  the legal system supported by many in somalia does not favor absolute protection of private property . 
  actually , you could n't be [ more wrong ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/xeer ) ...

  tl ; dw dude is butthurt his brand of statists did n't win the election and is firmly in the process of realizing the state itself is a problem . 
  comes up with some good ideas/observations , basically voluntaryist . 
  you can safely skip to about 23min mark - that 's when it gets interesting . 
   there 's not really an anti-establishment comedians with representation out there right now . 
  the difference being , the system back in poland was obviously broken and most people could see it . 
  there was only one party to blame . 
  all the anti-system jokes had to be veiled to be allowed past censors - that , paradoxically , added to their appeal .
