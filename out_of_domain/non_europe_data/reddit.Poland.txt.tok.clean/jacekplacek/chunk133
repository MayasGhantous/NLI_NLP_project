  right now , we are n't yet screwed so badly most people can not escape realizing the system itself is broken . 
  on the top of that , there 's this illusion of the opposing parties ( while , in fact both have mostly the same policies and serve mostly the same interests ) and when people feel `` something 's rotten in denmark '' they will blame it on the one party . 
   my view on that is that , if you feel that your country should n't be part of the un , then by that same logic you do n't want to be part of the un ... 
  if you do n't want to be here on earth than perhaps the un facilitate . 
  ... although , instead of `` exiled '' i would have said `` flown up into the space and tossed out '' . 
  ftfy, 
   human cost of over a million dead and wounded , and a financial cost of $ 130,000,000,000.00 ( in today 's dollars ), 
  ... and you still worship the asshole who did that ... 
  the same question applies to the us ... 
  so naive ... , 
   enacted the emancipation proclamation ? 
  history is not your strongest point , is it . 
   we understand co2 and how it affects the radiative balance of the atmosphere . 
  for the planet not to be warming as a result would come as a shock, 
  really , you do understand it ? 
  do you understand that water vapor is much more potent greenhouse gas and there 's much more of it in the atmosphere ? 
  are n't you like the inspector clouseau , seeing the dead dude close to the tracks and deciding the five fat dudes on the train caused his death ? 
  have you looked at henry 's law ? 
  do some fast calculation on how much the co2 we produce should increase it 's partial pressure vs how much it actually increased . 
  now consider the solubility of co2 in water vs temperature . 
  if you take into account temp . 
  rise it starts to make sense , does n't it . 
  another issue altogether is what are exactly your qualifications to pronounce how the warming ( oops , pardon me , climate change ) is going to be bad for us ? 
  the way i see it , the earth goes through the fricking cycles - freezing cold to balmy warm and we have no fricking idea why . 
  we are in the balmy warm cycle but it ( judging by the past cycles ) might soon end . 
  and yes , it has been much warmer before ( and guess what , co2 levels increased back then well beyond the current `` catastrophic '' levels ... ** after ** it got warm ! ), 
  - somehow the polar bears survived , imagine that !, 
   desertification of an area, 
  interesting tidbit : when the world 's climate was warmer in the past , sahara was wetter ... 
   al gore spent millions of dollars on a mansion in california, 
  and , somehow , he completely missed the opportunity to buy a huge swaths of land in alaska , yukon and siberia ... 
  certainly they are going to be the prime lands anytime soon !, 
  with all the refuges from the flooded/scorched areas of what is considered the mainland now . 
   un was integral in keeping peace ( more or less ) for almost 3/4th of century . 
  you really believe that ? 
  do n't know who was your teacher but you should demand a refund . 
  that 's the sad part , there 's no place to escape to ... :(, 
  yup , the same asshole ... 
  he invaded south in 1861 , his `` emancipation proclamation '' was in 1863 - the cost in lives and dollars was not because of what he said but of what he did . 
  pretty sure , should hitler win the wwii , you would prize him for something too ... 
  dunno ... if `` papieren bitte '' does n't faze you and swat raids on the businesses to check the purity of workforce does n't disgust you , perhaps you should be in a different `` sovereign nation . '', 
   if he were the man that was instrumental in abolishing slavery then yes . 
  he found it expedient , nothing more nothing less ... 
   my paramount object in this struggle is to save the union , and is not either to save or to destroy slavery . 
  if i could save the union without freeing any slave i would do it , and if i could save it by freeing all the slaves i would do it ; and if i could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone i would also do that . 
  what i do about slavery , and the colored race , i do because i believe it helps to save the union ; and what i forbear , i forbear because i do not believe it would help to save the union, 
  _ lincoln _, 
   backwards upbringing, 
  funny how statists believe anybody who does n't suck the mass murderer 's cock must be `` backwards . '', 
  do you still weep after the death of stalin ? 
  hey , he won the wwii !, 
   that 's not a factor here because water vapor is n't the gas that 's changing in concentration, 
  iow : you decided up-front the greenhouse effect is the main ( only ? ), 
  factor , and since the more potent and abundant greenhouse gas can not support your preconceived notion , you decided to hand-wave it away and focus on the less potent and much less abundant one . 
   the last time it was this warm , it took 100,000 years to get there . 
  this time , it has taken 50 years . 
  oh , picking your data points to fit your thesis , are n't we . 
  how did you reach the 100,000 years ? 
  why not 3.6 million ? 
  it would be as honest ... 
  so , let 's look at the actual data for the [ last significant warming ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:holocene_temperature_variations.png ) , the one at the 8 thousand mark . 
  the average of all markers suggest around 1 thousand years , some markers actually suggest very steep change . 
  since we have no way of knowing decade-by-decade changes your guess about `` the rate of climb '' is as good as mine , you just make it up as you go . 
  if you plot the change over last millennium and smooth the curve out , you will get very similar one ... 
  not really . 
  it 's based on the idea that 100 % income tax rate would make people stop working/earning income ... 
   water vapor is n't the one that 's gone up by 40 % over the last half-century . 
  it has n't changed ( nor are we introducing more water vapor into the system ) , so how could it somehow be the driving force behind the change ? 
  yes , it 's very potent , but if it does n't change , then its warming force does n't change . 
  lol , exactly as i said - you decided the change is due to greenhouse effect and you tailor your `` science '' to that assumption , disregarding factors that do n't support your assumption and overblowing the ones that do . 
  you are like the dude who was feeding his dog a diet containing very low levels of arsenic for a long while , and trace elements of mercury for the last month . 
  the dog died and the dude is certain it was poisoning . 
  could n't be arsenic - heck he was feeding it arsenic for a long time and the levels did n't change , ** had ** to be mercury !, 
  as a matter of fact the dog was hit by a truck . 
   regarding the holocene record , that 's quite a modest jump in temperature compared to what we see now . 
  only around a half-degree . 
  what we 're seeing now , and will continue to see , is several times greater . 
  and even that was over several hundred years , not 50 . 
  modest jump comparing to what ? 
  to the jump over the last millennium ? 
  that was even more modest . 
  you keep ignoring what i said - we have no way of knowing what the jump was back then at any given decade , all we know it was `` around a half-degree '' over a millennium . 
  most likely it was fluctuating , as it is now - so there were probably decades when it dropped ( as between 1940 and 1980 ) and then went up again . 
  you have absolutely no reason to claim that the last 50 years is warming faster than any given 50 years period in mid-holocene . 
  none whatsoever . 
  just mod the milk crate ... cheaper and more fun . 
  sure , keep ignoring what i wrote and just appeal to authority ... funny you mention `` basic chemistry '' because that 's exactly what you and your cohorts are hand-waving away , together with basic physics ... but if that 's the only way to get your grants who am i to judge / s, 
   remember when the airbus a380 was delayed and it was an example of the total bankruptcy of socialist europe 's way of life ? 
  well , socialist way of life does n't seem to work to well in the us either ... 
  because if you `` eat the rich '' you will run out of them pretty soon . 
  it is silly and assumes the contract has the force of the law of nature . 
  it does n't . 
  you take the pill , you sign the stupid contract and then , after getting home you give the dude a pill back , say `` i changed my mind , sue me . '', 
  same with another stupid statist hypothetical : `` can you sell yourself into slavery ? '', 
  yes , you can . 
  and if you tire of being a slave you can break the contract and tell the `` master '' to sue you if he 's not happy . 
  how is he going to enforce it ? 
  even now , with the statist society , all the dude can do is try to seize your property ... and , btw , how would he find the arbitrator ( s ) willing to rule in his favor ? 
  one ( s ) i would agree to ... 
  for a scientist , you have amazing propensity to avoid addressing the issues ... why do you assume current warming is ** caused ** by the greenhouse effect and the past warmings were n't ?
