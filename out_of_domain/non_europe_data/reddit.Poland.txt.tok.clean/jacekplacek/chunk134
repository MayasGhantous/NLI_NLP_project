  how do you know the last 50 years of warming was more rapid than other ones ? 
  exposed warmongers for what they really are ? 
  back in 1930 's germany : `` we need anti-nazis in the ss ranks as badly as we need them in reichstag ... '', 
  you are ** forced ** ? 
  is there a dude with a gun looking over your shoulder ? 
  i 'm pretty sure people being killed by ss would find it comforting some of their killers were anti-nazis ... 
  because it was in their job description ... 
  the author missed `` i did n't have a relationship with that woman '' and `` i 'm not going to be using justice department resources to try to circumvent state laws on this issue [ medical marijuana ] '' ... 
  yup , that too ... 
  op seems to urge you to vote democrats , as if they were any better ... 
   respect the right to hold differing opinions, 
  sure , and i have a differing opinion on purpose of downvoting ... , 
  wait , what ?!, 
  but reddit ( r/libertarian included ) tells me he is a neocon ... 
   can something have value without labor or ideas ? 
  sure it can . 
  you walk on the beach and find a beautiful shell . 
  you pick it up . 
  it certainly has value for you , yet no labor or idea was involved in producing it . 
   but the aggression is against americans , not the japanese . 
  actually , it 's against both . 
  sorry ... it 's like debating the flat earth society ... , 
  stop feeding the troll ... 
  the `` you did n't build it '' elizabeth warren ? 
  and you are proud ? 
  oh ... did n't really come out as sarcasm ... , 
   it would only take about 5 minutes to shut down a bunch of flat earthers, 
  nah , they do n't listen ... 
   i 'm sure you could do the same to the commies, 
  neither do commies . 
  in the related news : world bank devastates the world 's economy ... 
   second , that land was not `` palestinian '' land . 
  it was ottoman , and then british land . 
  hmm ... 
  there was no `` ukrainian '' land ( till the 90s ) . 
  it was austrian/russian/polish land ... 
  those photos were taken at the cornerstone laying ceremony for the new arms factory in poland . 
  the clueless morons are high government officials ... that figures . 
   if you could discredit communism as easily as flat earthers can be discredited, 
  has already been done , many times over . 
   you could at the very least get published . 
  maybe you could get a book deal or even a tenured research position at a university, 
  you are assuming that just because it 's something that has tremendous appeal to you it has to have as much appeal to me . 
  how perfectly marxist of you . 
  but you are dead wrong . 
   come on , do n't hide your dizzying intellect from the world, 
  i am perfectly content with having my `` dizzying intellect '' hidden from the world . 
   put it on display for everyone to see . 
  only if by `` everyone '' you mean some disgruntled pseudo-intellectuals and a few curious teenagers ... 
  besides , if you really are interested in the critique , you have already heard it all . 
  starting from the fallacy of the labor theory of value , and ending with the impossibility of any economic calculation without the free market . 
  you just keep redefining concepts like `` value '' and `` labor '' till they have no discernible meaning . 
  do n't know what the current orthodoxy is on the second point , ( lost track and interest long time ago ) the last i heard was lange 's market simulation approach - which obviously can not and will not work , the motivations ( both positive and negative ) are not there ... 
   they have since declared and created a sovereign state, 
  yeah , since the latest occupiers lost the will to suppress it ... palestinians were never given that chance . 
   existed as a state with a flag, 
  are you taking ** everything ** literally ... ? 
   they get the whole honor killing and stoning thing, 
  methinks geography is not your strongest suit ... , 
  good . 
  making progress ... now read on what parts of the `` surface of the earth '' indulge in the `` honor killing and stoning thing '' ... 
   police presence itself is usually a deterrent to all kinds of crime, 
  [ _ citation needed _ ], 
   people on r/libertarian always seem to know a remarkable amount about my inner feelings , preferences , and philosophies . 
  well , you do write remarkable amount about your inner feelings , preferences and philosophies . 
  should we assume you are a liar ? 
  tell us some more about the ways you love barack obama ... 
   if there was no police would there be more or less crime than now ? 
  is that a trick question ? 
  i 'm pretty sure less ... 
  do you have masochistic tendencies ? 
  why do you even go there ... , 
   the articles of confederation did n't work well . 
  the individual states had too much power and nothing could be agreed upon . 
  how was that a bad thing ? 
   co2 is a pollutant , that part just about everyone agrees on, 
  nope . 
  there 's plenty of people in jails who are innocent but did n't run from the police ... cops are not interested in finding the actual perp , they are interested in finding anybody they can pin it on . 
  < shrug /  if you do n't know , no explanation is gon na enlighten you ... 
   i 'd expect that within the last 5 years we 'll have seen two major us cities under water, 
  how much are you willing to bet ? 
  ok , how much are you willing to bet ? 
   there 's nothing unsafe about putting your finger on the trigger for a picture to be taken provided the weapon is aimed in a safe direction, 
  like in picture # 5 ? 
  there 's no reason to put your finger on the trigger for a photo-op ... at best , you end up looking like a moron . 
   there exist circumstances where each rule can be momentarily disregarded provided adequate safety measures have been taken, 
  photo-op is not one of them . 
  besides there 's plenty of people who ended up shot because they ( or someone else ) `` momentarily disregarded '' the rules , no doubt believing `` adequate safety measures have been taken '' . 
  if that were the case , the [ innocence project ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/innocence_project ) would n't exist ... 
  yeah , 292 demonstrably innocent people . 
  demonstrated by a handful of lawyers , who can not possibly even think of taking on even the very small percentage of the cases ... not to mention they take only the cases where the dna exists ( 5 to 10 percent of criminal cases . ), 
  sure , that 's gon na give you nice and easy feeling . 
  cops have absolutely no incentive to find the truth . 
  their ** only ** incentive is to convict somebody . 
  anybody . 
  you are simply believing in cops ' high moral standards - without any evidence . 
  you are believing the average cop is going to chose no career advance over `` solving '' the case when the real perp is nowhere to be found and some poor schmuck just fits the case enough to frame . 
  but if that 's what lets you sleep at night , who am i to judge ... 
  iow : you are gon na waste your vote on `` more of the same '' ... 
   i 'm glad we have oil paintings of george washington,
