  oh , they were paid by taxpayers ? 
  so , in the ( hypothetical ) 2016 line-up rand paul ( r ) , hillary clinton ( d ) , gary johnson ( l ) you would vote johnson ... ? 
  someone forced you to click ? 
  that should be `` post-soviet russia '' ... 
  even if you knew for a fact that would result in hillary winning ? 
  and _ vice-versa _ : your blanket assumption this is the exception rather than the norm is without any evidence beyond your own personal prejudice ... 
  sure , never said if they actually find the guilty one they not gon na arrest him . 
  does n't make innocent person being `` suspected '' feel any better - if they can not ( easily ) find the real perp , they gon na frame you if they can , so they can `` solve '' the case ... 
  scaring the sheep ? 
  this dirtbag dealer cut it with corn flour again !, 
   did you support obama or romney ? 
  sucker . 
  ftfy, 
  hard-core libertarian ? 
  he is just a nut who think he is libertarian - i consider his hiring the most serious lapse of judgement by ron paul ... 
   they 're against the concept of crazy people owning guns, 
  unfortunately , they tend to view anybody to the right of elizabeth warren as crazy ... 
   it 's okay for anyone to be able to get a gun, 
  well , anyone ** can ** get a gun if they really want . 
  such as anyone can get heroin if they really want . 
  by definition , the law is only going to restrict those who abide by it , and those who have a desire to wreck havoc , do n't fall into `` law-abiding '' category . 
  well , i did n't downvote you ... till the edit . 
   is it ever a good idea to give all the power to one corporation ? 
  well , you could still stay with comcast ... , 
   i do n't see them as a good thing, 
  apparently , you are in a very slim minority . 
  they would n't be successful otherwise . 
  kinda depends ... average in the 1950s or average in 2010s america ? 
  contrary to popular belief , there are people who leave their jobs voluntarily ... and even amicably !, 
  that has nothing to do with minimum wage . 
   many of the same libertarians , however , have to be directly asked or pressed to apply the same critique and denigration to the employers receiving the same , if not more , government intervention on their behalf or at the behest of these employers . 
  most libertarians are strongly against both . 
  so , their action has nothing statist in it ( unless they start calling for state intervention . ), 
  but you asserted that `` nothing about a minimum wage is necessarily statist . '', 
  that has nothing to do with minimum wage ... 
  you are assuming that most posters to r/libertarian are actually libertarian ... which might or might not be true . 
  you forgot to mention working class could n't afford iphones ... 
  i still do n't like them . 
  they treat you as a potential thief and they demand you pay them for the `` privilege '' to shop there ... 
  uhmm ... even not taking into account all the exemptions/deductions , [ median income families ] ( http://www.stanford.edu/class/polisci120a/immigration/median%20household%20income.pdf ) did n't have to pay any [ taxes ] ( http://www.ntu.org/tax-basics/history-of-federal-individual-1.html ) in the 50s when the tax rates were the highest ... 
   i 'm having a really hard time understanding the resentment of massah . 
   a lot of it sounds so ridiculous to me . 
  oh my god i have to pick cotton , or i have to follow the massah 's rules . 
  i do n't see what the big deal is , yes you have rights -- but no right is absolute . 
   and furthermore , i really struggle with the distaste for the massah because well , massah has done a lot for me . 
  i was born mildly disabled to relatively poor parents and massah paid for my therapy . 
  as an adult i see children get up every day and come to school and the only food they eat is the food the massah provides . 
   all told i 've never really had a bad experience with massah that went beyond trivially annoying . 
   there are areas where i basically agree that massah should stay out of people 's lives . 
  i tend to agree with abolitionists on some issues but i just do n't understand the core animosity towards having to follow the massah 's rules and pick your cotton on a plantation . 
  when i lived in alabama , i could totally get the resentment of people towards the slavery that they supressed but you could see at times . 
  ftfy, 
   the koala can not legally be kept as a pet in australia ** or anywhere else **, 
  and how is australia going to enforce that ? 
  let 's see , between federal , state and local governments i am paying about 40 % of my income to taxes ... so , yes , you could argue i 'm only 40 % enslaved . 
  lol , so you can only ( try to ) enforce the laws against smuggling , not against keeping pets ... 
  i might even sell one to you ... , 
  an agreement ? 
  do n't pass laws you can not enforce ? 
  yeah , and a chair with a lamp is an electric chair ... 
  i did n't `` define '' anything ... 
  sure . 
  but palestinians are ethnically jewish . 
  they are the descendants of sephardim jews who converted to islam ... 
  yeah !, 
  and bloomberg is personally responsible for ** everything ** published under bloomberg name . 
  so is forbes for anything that was ever written in the forbes magazine ... 
  that 's not what allstarnick12 said ... 
  # 1 : stop telling other libertarians what they should/should not do ... 
  unless all your ancestors landed on the plymouth rock , all of those stupid , bigoted things was said about them at some point ... 
  you ca n't fight a city hall ... , 
  what happens ? 
  how would that be any different than what is now ? 
  all the land is either privately owned or `` owned '' by a state . 
  you can not settle on the state `` owned '' land so , it 's kinda like it did n't even exist . 
  iow , for all the practical purposes , there 's `` no more land . '', 
   do n't link to wnd ... ever, 
  who made you a king ? 
  i think reddit broke it ... 
  but it is totally acceptable for president obama to `` hold middle-class tax cuts hostage '' because he wants tax rates to rise on wealthy ... ? 
  hmm ... reddit also loves lolcats ... coincidence ? 
  download seagate 's dos based tools , boot from it and run the test . 
  if it fails you will get the instructions how to rma . 
  you work , you save some money , you buy tools - capital . 
  are you saying the hasidim are not really jews or are they crypto-zionists ? 
  what about finkelstein and chomsky ? 
  not quite , just the old town and some other historic landmarks ... 
  yeah , i know , we should just meekly agree to become a soviet republic and gladly volunteer for gulags . 
  better red than dead ... / s just because you are a coward and happy slave does n't mean everybody is . 
   poland never was a soviet republic . 
  yup . 
  stalin reconsidered , mainly because of the warsaw uprising ... 
  oh , so you do know that `` jewish does n't ** equal ** zionist '' after all ... 
   people are lying , cheating , hypocritical , greedy , arseh * les . 
  that 's why you need government to make society run, 
  so , you believe having `` lying , cheating , hypocritical , greedy , arseh * les '' in charge of your money/liberty is a good idea ? 
   puting your trust in private investors is too optimistic for me, 
  and putting your trust in government bureaucrats and politicians is not ? 
   the word treason by its very definition means those who would do harm to their state . 
  `` if that be treason , make the most of it . '',
