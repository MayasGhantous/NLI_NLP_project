   bulgaria was enslaved you fuckwit . 
  yup . 
  at times . 
  at other times your psychopathic rulers enslaved ( or tried to enslave ) others . 
  and at all times bulgarian people were and still are enslaved ... the difference being your master now is the douchebag ( or rather a cabal of douchebags ) that happened to speak the same language you do . 
   surely you realize that the vast majority of the population of the world ( as well as history ) disagrees with you on that, 
  yes i do . 
  and do n't call me shirley ... , 
   by those standards most presidents have been psychopathic murderers , especially the earlier ones like jackson who enjoyed killing natives a little too much ... 
  sure thing . 
  it 's not a secret psychopaths are drawn to power like moths to the candle . 
  and they tend to be successful gaining it . 
  lack of scruples/guilt/shame certainly helps immensely in politics . 
   they volunteered to risk their lives for a psychopath, 
  yup . 
  psychopaths have the uncanny ability to manipulate people ... 
  she also knows how to deal with [ unruly subordinates ] ( http://polidics.com/911/hillary-clintons-jew-bastard.html ) and how to get away with it ... 
  iow , the `` exchange value '' is a pretty meaningless concept , main ( the only ? ), 
  reason for it being the attempt to reanimate the dead ideology ? 
  you could just copy-paste it into google translate ... 
   both posters were trying to say `` shut up and take my money ! '', 
  and both did so incorrectly . 
  so , what would be a correct way ? 
  is n't mafia 's `` protection fee '' voluntary ? 
  all you need to do to avoid it is to move , after all ... 
   right , the mafia does n't hunt people down or anything - it just lets people who owe them debts peacefully skip town , right ? 
  if you already `` owe '' them money they sure will hunt you down . 
  so will france . 
  if , though , you pay your current `` fees '' and just sell your business and move away they will let you be . 
  so will france . 
  ... unless it 's anatomically correct doll ... , 
  my prediction : it will be tweedledee vs tweedledum and one of them will win . 
  i 'm always puzzled by some ( most ? ), 
  americans becoming such cowards recently they are scared shitless of bunch of medieval goat herders . 
  do you really believe the muslim hordes are going to mount their nautical camels , swim the ocean and invade your backyards ? 
  do you fear it so badly you are happy for the state agents to paw your daughters and squeeze your balls ? 
  are there ** any ** proud , brave , rational americans left ? 
  nope , what we are talking about is whether ability to move away makes your decision to stay and pay voluntary . 
  that is independent of the entity forcing you to pay and what your opinion of it 's legitimacy happen to be . 
  price is always a function of demand and supply , even marks new that ... 
  perhaps not exactly what majorpaynei86 meant [ but ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golden_liberty ), 
  sigh ... you said ability to move means the payment is voluntary . 
  now you are trying to weasel out of it by talking about bunch of irrelevant stuff . 
  does n't work . 
  baaaa !!, 
  i always fight traffic tickets . 
  but you should go to court prepared - do some research on the case laws and try to find some superior court decision you can base your defense on . 
  methinks you 've confused alex jones with david icke ... 
   do you like being defended ? 
  from whom ? 
   there was a time when people moved too california . 
  does n't seem to be a coherent english sentence ... 
  so , should `` illegals '' be only banned from government owned property ? 
  unless it was spelled out in the lease agreement , they could n't tell me who am i allowed to invite over ... 
  you admit you do n't listen to the dude but you do n't have a problem with smearing him with someone else 's delusions ? 
  otoh , you did offer something resembling an attempt at apology ... downvote removed , 
  did n't say anything about dress code ... , 
  good for them . 
  did you think they owe you jobs ? 
  if you marry and later divorce , guess who gets to keep the dog ... , 
   i think it 's because they do n't pay attention very much . 
  or they actually do pay attention ... 
  hmm ... let 's see : the us congress ( board of directors ) and president ( ceo ) spend all of the social security money ( pension plan ) and r/politics is not in uproar ... funny that . 
  victim disarmament vultures already circling ... 
   i 'm pretty critical of hitler . 
  that does n't mean i ca n't approve of his efforts to build the autobahn . 
  hmm . . `` government big enough to build autobahn is big enough to build konzentrationslager '' ... 
  the fine specimen of the dreaded keyboard assfucker goes on the hunt ... , 
  you have been pretty consistent in exonerating obama , do you also have some words of wisdom in defense of mr lanza ? 
  3 days ? 
  just leave it enough water and hay/pellets . 
  it 's gon na be ok . 
  `` and would you feel any better , young lady , if they were thrown out of the window ? '', 
  are you gon na volunteer for the duty of going door-to-door and confiscating firearms ... ? 
  a little bit more classy than perpetrating them ... oh , wait , those are muslim children , they do n't count ... 
   but he 's using a bushmaster .223 caliber semi-automatic assault rifle designed for use by the military and police officers, 
  why do you think it 's more `` dangerous '' than [ this ] ( http://www.ruger.com/products/mini14ranchrifle/models.html ) or [ this ] ( http://www.remington.com/en/products/firearms/centerfire/model-750/model-750-woodsmaster.aspx ) or [ this ] ( http://www.cabelas.com/product/shooting/centerfire-rifles/semiautomatic | / pc/104792580/c / 105522480/sc/105524280 / browning174-bar-safari-rifle / 705616 . uts?destination = % 2fcatalog % 2fbrowse % 2fshooting-centerfire-rifles-semiautomatic % 2f _ % 2fn-1102333 % 2fns-category_seq_105524280 % 3fwtz_l % 3dsbc % 253bmmcat104792580 % 253bcat105522480 & wtz_l = sbc % 3bmmcat104792580 % 3bcat105522480 % 3bcat105524280 ) ? 
   the only effective solution is a complete elimination of the gun market, 
   or we could just get rid of guns, 
   i did n't say i wanted to ban guns, 
  i was always curious how do you guys think it would work , psychologically : the dude decides he want 's to go out in a ` glory ' and take as many innocent people/children with him as possible . 
  now assume you got your way and he can not possibly get his hands on a gun . 
  do you honestly believe he would just say `` too bad , i 'll go with plan b - gon na volunteer to the kitchen-soup ... '' ? 
   that dwarfs the more than 145 shootings in the us since 1997, 
  uhmmm ... you mean 145 `` gun free zones '' shootings ... ? 
   armed civilians do not stop mass shootings, 
  if it was stopped it never had a chance to become a mass shooting ... 
   statistically , everyone is safer without firearms anywhere near a school . 
  that so ? 
  have any actual statistics to show that ? 
  hmm ... someone who never had sex could wonder what the appeal was too ... , 
   imho there is no need for average citizens to own military assault rifles, 
  there 's no need for average citizen to own a sports car or a 60 '' tv set or a [ loooong list of items ] ... 
  they are ( almost ) perfectly safe allright , you claimed they are `` safer '' , though - for that you need more than just your say-so ... 
  since the overwhelming majority of those shootings occur in the `` gun free zones , '' it 's kinda hard for ** law abiding ** people to carry there and be able to prevent one . 
  hmm ... how many people at the shooting ranges shoot at the live targets ( trying to `` take a life '' ) ? 
   i 'm sorry but you have n't responded to the question i asked you, 
  yes i did , you just have n't got it . 
  since there are very few examples of mass shootings in what are not gun free zones , the few examples of `` would be mass shooting '' stopped by armed people are relatively `` significant number . '', 
  nope .
