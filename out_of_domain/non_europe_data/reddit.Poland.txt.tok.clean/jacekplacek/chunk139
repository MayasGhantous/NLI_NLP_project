   medieval iceland had a anarcho capitalist society or anarchy for 300 years . 
  guess what it produced ? 
  a government . 
  out of anarchy there always comes a government . 
  no way around it . 
  i take 300 years with no government . 
  do you plan to off yourself because `` out of life there always comes a death ? '', 
   when the mongols , catholics , or bolsheviks come rolling into town to take over , how will the anarchists defend their non-state ? 
  vigorously ... 
  thousands of years of history said wealth is not attainable but for the very few . 
  sure . 
  so is mafia . 
   where do you see any compulsion ? 
  i do n't . 
  is n't threat of being found guilty if you do n't answer compulsion enough for you ? 
   that is a compulsion to answer, 
  jeez ... that 's the point . 
  it 's prohibited by the 5th ... 
  the 5th does n't say `` while in custody '' nor `` when asked for a lawyer . '', 
   the threat you say is that by keeping silent he was implicating himself . 
  that 's not what i 'm saying . 
  the threat is not that he would be implicating himself , the threat is that the cops/prosecution/judge would say he 's implicating himself . 
   source on what ? 
  `` their lack of scruples is notorious . '', 
  so , any sport involving balls ( except polo and water polo ) is a football ... ? 
   why would you ever completely hate all sports in the first place ? 
  because they are all equally boring ... ? 
  basketball is played on horseback ... ? 
  you are right but it 's hard to imagine someone cocking the hammer on semi-auto instead of working the slide ... 
  they do . 
  that 's why they pick those places : target rich environment . 
  uhhh ... that 's the point . 
  uhmm ... it was not a `` logic '' it was a joke . 
  how come the gun grabbers are so dense ? 
  ... around interracial couple ... 
   but look at how people around the country are reacting to this . 
  the way they used to react to interracial couples or openly gay people ? 
   if you would n't at least consider the possibility that this man is a killer , you 're just being foolish . 
  it 's pretty obvious the dude is not a killer . 
  if he were , he would either conceal the weapon or kept it at `` ready . '', 
  why are your thoughts mimicking those of white californians in the 60s in response to black panthers ' protest ? 
  if he is a male between 18 and 45 then , yes , he is . 
   why you stay around here , jimmygroove, 
  either a paid troll or obsessive nut ... , 
  plenty of gun owning gun grabbers around ... even your hero , feintstein has one ( or at least used to have . ), 
  really ? 
  bet you plenty of people at the same mall were carrying concealed . 
  does it gives you the willies as well ? 
  as to `` gun grabbing '' - you keep advocating measures with no discernible purpose other than restricting gun rights . 
  that happens to be ( informal ) definition of a gun grabber . 
  as to the `` hero ( ine ) '' - just an educated guess , she seems to be an object of worship for gun grabbers ... no magical powers whatsoever , just powers of deduction . 
  there 's an equivalence in the `` public reaction '' - something that used to be viewed with disgust/horror become a norm . 
  not because the interracial couples/gays stayed out of sight . 
   reducing rate of fire is the point . 
  there is no way to stop people from occasionally going off the deep end , but some people see value in taking steps to reduce the potential damage that can be done when such an event occurs . 
  that 's the logic behind large magazine restriction . 
   the only reason gun control became necessary to keep us from getting guns then is because there was no need to keep citizens from getting guns when slaves were n't citizens . 
  but , on a second thought , for some reason or the other i seem to have you pegged as worse on gun grabbing than you appear to be . 
  i apologize . 
  you may observe the real disgust is not with the weapon itself but with the visibility of one . 
  that 's pretty irrational . 
   so you believe in unrestricted access to all guns ( including anti-aircraft guns and anti-tank guns ) without permits or background checks ? 
  and why not ? 
  are you planning on sending a tank or a bomber my way and are afraid i could be able to defend myself ? 
  [ the atlanta declaration ] ( http://www.lneilsmith.org/atlanta.html ), 
   but the police could easily overpower a gunowner through siege tactics and other non-gun weapons such as tasers . 
  really ? 
  what about 2 gun owners ? 
  80 million ? 
   we willingly give away some of our liberties to the state, 
  speak for yourself . 
  i obey the laws that make sense . 
  not because they are the laws but because they make sense . 
  nope . 
  because they make sense i would `` obey '' them even if they were n't the laws ... 
  being a canadian has nothing to do with it ... being a wuss does . 
   i guess that guy is willing to destroy every person he happens to walk past . 
  nope . 
  only every person on the floor he happens to walk over ... 
  uhh , and how would you go about `` disallowing '' ... ? 
  problem is you would be more than likely to end up like [ this dude ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bart_police_shooting_of_oscar_grant ) , who did n't even try to fight the goons ... 
  hey , i would n't mind some sex with my doctor - she is quite cute . 
   then the prosecutor grants him immunity for his testimony . 
  where in the fifth is the clause `` unless granted immunity ? '', 
  i know . 
  but you said it would be `` abuse . '', 
  i can unequivocally tell you it would not , quite the contrary ... , 
  well , you are still a witness against yourself , just can not be prosecuted for what they learn ... besides , if i were in such a situation i would insist on the blanket immunity - which no prosecutor is going to grant . 
  no heinlein ?!, 
  and no verne ? 
  st. ayn wanted taxes too ... , 
  who cares what james taylor says . 
  yes , she did . 
  she believed they could be voluntary . 
  but if she ever tried to implement that she would have to either abandon the government ( not likely , she still wanted to bomb commies and other undesirables ) or redefine `` voluntary . '', 
  nyc area ( and dc , and chicago , and la. . . ) has a culture we have to overcome ... , 
  but he should have ... , 
  dunno , always thought that were italians ( hint : cuomo . ),
