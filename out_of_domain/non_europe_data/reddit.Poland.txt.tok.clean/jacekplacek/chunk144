  _ law . _ the felonious taking of the property of another from his or her person or in his or her immediate presence , against his or her will , by violence or intimidation .

   ( but so does the c with the little dot over it ), 
  nope . 
  no such letter in polish . 
   ( but so does the little s with the dot over it ),

  that 's better  still they are not the same sound . 
  sz/cz are hard sh/ch while \u015b / \u0107 are soft . 
  english sh/ch fall somewhere in between soft and hard . 
  believe me , i have enough real life experience ( in 4 different countries ) to be extremely wary of any contact with cops ... 
  well , they do n't become soldiers till kinda later in life . 
  malnutrition tends to take effect earlier ... 
  remember east berlin ? 
  i guess any merchant who lives in a mafia territory also pays his `` protection fees '' voluntarily ... 
   the government has killed thousands of americans without trial, 
  so , which senator is starting a filibuster about that ? 
  how did the `` safety restraint system '' help ? 
   if the mafia is upfront with the rules and they are applied equally, 
  ... which seems to be the case ... 
   which are voted on by members elected from the community ,, 
  ... they are certainly being `` elected '' ... 
   and are subject to due process ,, 
  ... sure , there 's a visit from nice dudes trying to convince you to pay , then they might smash your windows and/or merchandise before they break your legs ... 
   and the punishments are reasonable compared to the violation, 
  ... that 's kinda subjective , is n't it . 
  being put into a cage and possibly raped for many years might not necessary qualify as `` reasonable punishment '' any more than have your legs broken ... 
   but if you are referring to a protection racket , i am very disappointed in resorting to such a shallow and poor analogy . 
  ... granted , the state is much better organized and much more ruthless ... 
   again i ask , do you believe in the constitution ?

  let me guess : they are not talking about lapd , are they . 
  easy : spent it on hitting caplock twice ... , 
   they wish to secede from america , and in their case by using violence . 
  you mean just like the colonists back in xviiith century ? 
  oops ... fixed . 
   but when a long train of abuses and usurpations , pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism , it is their right , it is their duty , to throw off such government , and to provide new guards for their future security . 
  _ the original 3 % ers _, 
  kinda depends on the period of time . 
  it sure is true in xxist century so far ... 
  someone really likes being fondled by strangers ... 
  i like to chose my fondling strangers myself ... , 
  `` you take care of the means , and the ends will take care of themselves . '', 
  iow , libertarianism is a moral philosophy ( nap ) - fortunately , the ends of it are beneficial from utilitarian sense . 
  it 's pretty simple : someone whacks you over the head , you know without a doubt it 's not good . 
  just extrapolate from there ... 
  my bet would be it 's still being reviewed by the fda ... 
   does he perform a more important activity than the teachers who guided him along the way ... the professors as well ? 
  _ those who can , do . 
  those who can not , teach . _,

  ... or so we are led to believe ... 
  americans : the only people who do n't believe they have no right to defend themselves ... 
  remember dorner ?

  now imagine 80 million dorners who do n't advertise , just do their best ... 
   hispanics voted overwhelmingly for obama this election . 
  yup . 
  because most repugnicans sound like you , asshole . 
  people who leave their homes to find a better future for themselves and their kids should be natural allies for conservatives . 
  sadly there 's hardly anything traditionally conservative left in the repugnican party anymore . 
  you persecute people , do n't be surprised they do n't vote for you ... 
  with rights come responsibilities . 
  you have your rights and if you infringe on the rights of others , you are going to be prosecuted . 
  would you prosecute a cat for torturing the mouse ? 
  beyond_hate 's gramps after [ loving vs virginia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/loving_v._virginia ) :, 
   great news , but my fellow va interracial couples : do n't abuse this ( as has been done in the past ) . 
  do n't go flaunting your marriage in public `` because you can '' . 
  rights end when people no longer choose to respect them . 
   do you really have a burger and coffee for breakfast ? 
  why ? 
  is there some sort of a taboo ... ? 
  plenty of room on a sidewalk ...

  i guess darksingularity is unable to make any decision for itself and believes only an idiot would want to ... 
   does n't the 2nd just establish the rights of a `` well regulated militia '' to keep and bear arms ? 
  only if you have trouble understanding english . 
  you can rephrase it with the same meaning as : `` the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed , because the well regulated militia is necessary to the security of a free state . '', 
  iow , the `` militia clause '' is just an explanation/justification for the prohibition of infringement of the `` right of the people . '', 
  even as clowns go , he is not the brightest one . 
  does n't `` humor '' imply something at least moderately funny anymore ?
