  he mentions it only to piss people off . 
   as for niggers , of course there are smart well educated black people , it 's just a joke to make fun of them , nothing personal . 
  ftfy, 
  a step too far ? 
  hmm ... is there some kind of algorithm to figure out for any particular category of people if it 's ok to `` jokingly make fun of , nothing personal '' or if it 's `` a step too far ? '', 
  you can chose to be born into poor white rural family ? 
  i hope it 's af `` joke . '', 
  unfortunately not quite funny ... 
  btw , perhaps you should switch to / r/libertariannomemes, 
  go to / r/libertariannomemes and fuck off ... 
  what 's really funny about it , it shows how many unabashed authoritarians frequent this subreddit ... 
  you do n't ? 
   higher rates of ** firearm ** suicide and homicide _ [ emphasis mine ] _, 
  and what does it indicate ? 
  i 'm pretty sure there 's more drowning near water than in the desert . 
  should people living near water be required to buy drowning insurance ? 
  it 's despicable how the gun-grabbers dig out the `` statistics '' like that to `` prove '' their biases . 
  yes , if someone wants to off himself/someone else he might chose the firearm as a tool . 
  if he does n't have access to one he will use something else . 
  higher rate of ** firearm ** suicide/homicide is irrelevant - the honest researcher would look at the ** overall ** rate . 
  but then , expecting honesty from gun-grabber assholes would be too much , i guess . 
   insuring auto drivers is ok, 
  actually , no - ** requiring ** auto insurance is definitely not ok . 
  just because the state successfully deprived you of your liberty in one case does n't give it any moral grounds for depriving you in some other case ... 
  ... unless usa comes to you ... 
  say , you move to elbonia and then the next ( or current ) us president decides to bring democracy there ... 
  uhmm ... you implied the us gvt . 
  can not really enforce taxes on you if you do n't come back to us ... 
   research on gun ownership demonstrates exactly what you 're getting at -- gun ownership is n't simply correlated with violence because guns are the most accessible ways to commit homicide or suicide . 
  rather , the availability of guns actually increases the risk of suicide and homicide . 
  yup . 
  you can pick up a `` research '' to `` prove '' whatever you want . 
  there 's lot of research that show something completely different . 
  just the look at [ raw data ] ( http://www.objectobot.com/?p=476 ) shows no correlation either way . 
  actually , us is known for demanding extradition for suspected tax avoiders ... but good luck to you . 
  why ? 
  you do n't believe market can exist without government ? 
  well , if you are a libertarian , to be consistent , you should really call yourself a `` liberal . '', 
  had a good sense of renouncing the citizenship ** before ** being liable for shitload of taxes ... 
   the link you 've provided is not a rigorous scientific analysis, 
  no , it 's not . 
  it 's just a blogger correlating data . 
  if you like you can do the same for any given year you can get the data from . 
   does n't it seem silly to you to cite a random blogger after i 've just cited research from harvard university, 
  nope . 
  this is the data i can check . 
  your `` research from harvard university '' does n't let me check their data and the criteria of `` controlling for poverty and urbanization '' - at least not without forking over some dough ... 
   i do n't believe somalia does, 
  iow you do n't believe there exist international market ? 
  there 's no global monopolist on retaliatory force , after all . 
  hmm ... 
  i look around me and see plenty of stuff . 
  just a tiny percentage made in usofa . 
  looks like a market to me . 
   i have no way to guarantee that my state , county , or local government will enact change that i agree with, 
  oh , so you have a `` way to guarantee '' federal government will `` enact changes you agree with ? '', 
  or is it the matter of `` if i have to suffer so do rest of you suckers ? '', 
   it 's also a criticism of the other levels of government, 
  sure it is . 
  but it 's easier to deal with a smaller gang than with the gang that terrorizes the whole country ... 
  well , if they know they will be bailed out , why would n't they make risky loans ? 
   the men had adequate reason to believe that the politicians were scamming them and rigging the elections/votes, 
  is n't that the norm everywhere ? 
   would you have therefore supported a rogue group of gore supporters unleashing a firestorm upon the parties that were involved in the 2000 election ? 
  wholeheartedly !, 
  ... they really work !, 
  could n't find the `` numbers available to the public '' from your link ... 
  i have no idea what the `` evidence '' is so can not have a reason to reject/not reject it . 
  you keep providing links i would have take your word on the conclusions they make . 
  and as i have said before : you can find research to confirm your biases if you really want - i 'm just not quite willing to play your game . 
  and i do n't doubt you are aware of research of people like lott or kleck that you decided to ignore . 
  you could just [ google it ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_lott#concealed_weapons_and_crime_rate ) feel free to reject without reading . 
  and keep believing in the magical power of firearms to `` make the good boys ( and girls ) bad . '', 
  and how is that relevant ? 
  he did correlate available data . 
  what makes a research `` his own ? '', 
  but the important question really is : how is any of the so called `` research '' relevant ? 
  to establish if firearms have magical properties or not ? 
  what is it about hoplophobes that make them believe in magical powers of firearms ? 
   you believe that gun ownership results in less violence . 
  i do ? 
   you 've rejected a considerable amount of evidence to the contrary , on the basis that it is behind a paywall, 
  i have an obligation to pay for your `` evidence ? '', 
   the evidence you 've offered, 
  never said it was any kind of `` evidence . '', 
   your contention that guns are n't used to kill people, 
  [ _ citation needed _ ] never said such a thing . 
   i ca n't honestly tell if you are being willfully ignorant , or perhaps you have a learning disability . 
  if it 's the later , i apologize for implying you 're irrational . 
  how typical for a hoplophobe . 
  and how do you explain your thesis firearms make people kill , other than their magical power ? 
  yup . 
  the presidents at the time trying to emulate europe ... 
   because actually you said : someone is always going to be poor . 
  that depends on what you mean by poor . 
  obviously , someone is always going to be the least wealthy ... 
  pretty simple , actually . 
  most people accept the society they were born into as something `` natural . '', 
  back in the middle ages most serfs could n't even imagine being free . 
  dear all american countries except usa ,,
