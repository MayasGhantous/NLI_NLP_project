  if you are not paranoid you are not paying attention . 
   if you want change , go vote, 
  `` if voting could change anything they would make it illegal . '', 
  so , who should i vote for - tweedledum or tweedledee ? 
   i do n't care who you are , chances are castro is probably smarter than you if you are making that kind of statement . 
  and he was _ el presidente _ . 
  i do n't care who he is , or if you agree with his opinions , but show some respect and stop making personal attacks on the man . 
  ftfy, 
   you realize that people all over the world , who live under real , actual tyrants would trade places with you in a heartbeat , right ? 
  i 'm pretty sure there were lot of people who would trade places with north koreans too . 
   he definitely asks them to all be war profiteers, 
  question is : why the `` war profiteers '' are vilified while the dudes who actually start wars are lionized ? 
  nixon ? 
  which war had he started ? 
  i do n't see much hate for madison , mckinley , jfk , or obama for that matter ... 
  funny that , when people working for a corporation make fraudulent statements they get charged and go to jail , when people working for government do that - the government gets charged and told not to do it again ... 
   us weapons go to the uniformed israeli military . 
  hmm ... so , having an uniform makes you more equal ? 
  that 's fine , the only way i 'm going to respond to that is by saying i 'm not going to respond to that either ... , 
  why do you prefer the girl to be raped and strangled in a back alley to her having a means to defend herself ? 
  are you perhaps planning on raping and strangling ? 
   so does a guy really deserve to die for wacking a horse with a stick ? 
  `` stupidity is the only universal capital crime ; the sentence is death .

   but , despite his new appearance , police still recognized him saturday during a routine stop-and-search . 
  someone snitched on him . 
  how is christmas limiting your freedom ? 
  obviously , the insurgents would be kind enough to let the government know who they are !, 
   it 's one of those 35-mph exits , and in this case , they mean it, 
  that 's part of the problem . 
  everywhere else when the sign says 35 it 's ok to do 55 , the places like this can catch you unaware if you do n't know the route ... 
   this will never be on alex jones, 
  oh , [ really ?

   that ** gun deaths ** are not a major problem in society is just laughable _ [ emphasis mine ] _, 
  `` would you feel any better if they was thrown out the window , young lady ? '', 
  so , you are actually being very myopic . 
  the problem with murders is murders themselves , not the tools/means being used . 
  there would n't be much of a fight - nice dinner for the badger , though . 
   they have the law to protect them, 
  they do ? 
  who would pass the law to protect pestilence ? 
  what 's that from ? 
  it was just a very long time ago ... 
  you mean kidnapped ? 
  perhaps f_bastiat would n't submit without a fight ... 
  what have you got and how much you want for it ? 
  suppose , in the city with a really bad ` hood , politicians decided to send the young women to work there around the clock . 
  suppose , lots of them ended up being raped . 
  would you insist taking them out of those jobs would `` punish them and take away their rights ? '', 
   i think that situation would be entirely different, 
  why ? 
  i think the tricky part would be `` make a deal with the federal government . '', 
  sure , but not so funny ... 
   deniers, 
  is that like `` heretics '' back in xvi century ? 
  there was a `` scientific consensus '' back then too ... 
   it 's not a quote . 
  ... which should be pretty obvious to anybody with density lesser then osmium ... 
   because most people just read a headline and believe it, 
  nope . 
  because most people can recognize hyperbole when they see it . 
  yes you can . 
  really ? 
  is there really ** anybody ** who would believe any politician/bureaucrat could possibly say `` i 'm not involved what goes on in the [ department i 'm a head of ] ? '', 
  he knows what not to know about ... 
  they have a department of patent trolling . 
  like walmart has a department of on-line sales , even though they `` do not exist for the sole purpose of '' selling on-line they are still on-line retailer ... 
  there 's no profit in that ... 
  how tall are you ? 
  taller or shorter than the average ? 
  would you like to get `` equalized ? '',

  his cock sucking is not sexual , it 's submissive ... 
  cool . 
  my native language is polish - are you always grammatically correct when forming a polish sentence ? 
  he might be technically correct .

   our constitution rights were violated . 
  they were not, 
  `` the right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .

  do n't see no `` unless the neighbor calls the cops '' clause ... 
  '' [ if men are good , you do n't need government ; if men are evil or ambivalent , you do n't dare have one .

  well , he did n't say stalin committed no crimes ... 
   you could just promote more a constructive gradualist political activism, 
  we 've been trying that approach for over half a century now . 
  did n't seem to work that well , quite the contrary , looks like we are slowly losing ... 
  yup . 
  if the bunch of dudes back in colonial america followed your advice , we 'd still be singing `` god save the queen . '', 
  in what sense ? 
  more libertarian posts on reddit ? 
  yes . 
  any influence of the government policies ? 
  nope .
