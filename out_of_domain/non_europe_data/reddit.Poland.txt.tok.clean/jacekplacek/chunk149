  so much fail here i do n't know where to begin ... 
   because i do see a `` right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses ... '', 
   `` papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures '', 
  you mean the cop thought there were an `` unreasonable search and seizure '' going on ? 
  the bill of rights is there to protect against abuse by the government , not to protect people from each other . 
  but be a good little serf if that 's what makes you happy ... 
   french mathematician alphonse de polignac extended this conjecture to the idea that there should be infinitely many prime pairs for any possible finite gap , not just 2 . 
  ouhhh ... that 's obviously not true . 
  for any odd prime number _ p _ that 's not one of the twin pair , if the gap is _ p _ then one of the primes must be 2 ( the only even prime ) and the other can not be a prime ( if it were a prime it would be a twin with the gap . ), 
  edit : funny , someone did n't like my proof but did not bother to say what 's wrong with it ... 
  you can also multiply any prime number by 1 getting a prime number ... 
   and we already have so many avenues for peaceful reform . 
  like ? 
   come next election , theres a huge opportunity to remove the problem without violence, 
  did n't seem to work so far . 
  plenty of repugnican administrations , not even one step back ... ( i do n't count scary weapon ban expiring , bush himself stated he would sign it if extended . ), 
  this ratchet seems to only tighten . 
  oh , so this time the ratchet did not tighten ... it will the next time . 
  if you look at the gun control history , it only ever goes one way at the federal level . 
  and if you look at the broader liberty history , it seems to go mostly one way too . 
   not my job, 
  that 's what everyone says . 
  and that 's why `` nothing will be done by anyone . '', 
   this is what the people of france voted for , and it 's exactly what they 're getting . 
  `` democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want , and deserve to get it good and hard . '', 
  _ h.l. 
  iow , do n't be an uppity nigger if you do n't want to be flogged !, 
  you have any evidence they do n't ? 
  do n't you make the same assumption about mafia bosses ? 
  or do you want to judge them on the case-by-case basis ? 
  you think there is a substantial difference ? 
   getting 3x the max penalty does n't make a whole lot of sense . 
  it 's a maximum penalty , so by definition one should n't be able to get 3x . 
  could it be some weird thing in the law i do n't know about ? 
  sure . 
  were there other charges along with it probably ... 
  but sounds strange to me . 
  easy , get 3 counts and consecutive sentences ... 
  how do you know ? 
  ever tried ? 
  ok , explain what 's the difference . 
  uhmm , it 's not very nice to lie : your link only shows that the dudes at paulfest 2012 `` did n't want anything to do '' with adam . 
  ** not ** the ron paul campaign ... 
  who do you work for ? 
  they should demand their money back . 
  why would government put his own agent provocateur in jail ? 
  `` we ask not your counsels or arms . 
  crouch down and lick the hands which feed you . 
  may your chains set lightly upon you , and may posterity forget that ye were our countrymen . '', 
   one is a ( necessarily ) college educated, 
  so is _ consigliere _ ... 
   whose decisions are available for public scrutiny, 
  really ? 
  when was the last time you were able to `` scrutinize '' a judge ? 
   the other runs an underground and illegal commercial endeavour . 
  yup . 
  the government defines what 's `` illegal . '', 
  bet you if the mafia were to provide the definition the would n't be illegal at all . 
  but let 's look at the meat of the question : both government and mafia are organizations providing `` services '' to you whether you want them or not and both charge you for those services under the threat of violence . 
  ( to be fair to mafia , they also supply some genuine services to people who pay for them voluntarily , not so with the government . ), 
  iow , both are rackets , with the government being much more successful one . 
  and before you argue `` we got to vote for the government , '' how come your vote seems to bring you mostly the people from the same few families ? 
   but really the main thing that should prevent everyone from wanting to get high is the altered mind that comes along with it and the stupid things you will end up doing . 
  well , there 's a lot of artists who did their best works when high . 
  there were also some folks whom you would n't accuse [ of having a low iq ] ( http://io9.com/5876304/10-scientific-and-technological-visionaries-who-experimented-with-drugs ) ... 
  i 'm not urging you to try , just please do n't be so dogmatic about the topic . 
  who says anything about `` tyranny ? '', 
  the government itself , no matter how gentle , is a racket . 
  most people being brainwashed from the cradle into believing in government does n't make it any less of a racket . 
  hell , i 'm sure there were some who really believed mafia provides them with valuable protection ... 
  now you are changing the topic . 
  yes , you might believe it 's a necessary racket . 
  it 's still a racket . 
  you mean some dude in rp campaign did n't like kokesh , therefore we all have to hate him ? 
  when is the proper time for [ two minute hate ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/two_minutes_hate ) ? 
  nice projection . 
  you have an argument to make ? 
  did n't think so ... 
  as if [ canada 's record ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robert_dzieka%c5%84ski_taser_incident ) was spotless ... 
  she was a source of endless hilarity ... 
  the adjective `` social '' seems to have a negating property - it negates the meaning of the noun it precedes . 
  see : `` social '' justice , `` social '' security , `` social '' sciences , etc. . . , 
  ... and still , 99 % of them exist in the direct breach of the constitution ... 
  they see the `` evil '' guns ... 
  sorry , dude , but you certainly do n't understand them or recreate them . 
  you can only prompt one to recreate itself . 
  and your `` understanding '' is on a level of the early xixth century dude who , given bunch of electronic circuits , can figure out what the logic gates do but he would have absolutely no idea ** how ** they do it . 
  it 's even worse than that : the dude in question could probably figure out how to make working mechanical models of them . 
  you do n't . 
  or look at it from the other perspective : say , mechanical engineer can say he understands the internal combustion engine . 
  he can easily ( with some help from decent programmer , perhaps ) create a computer model of it . 
  what morethanmeetsthei is saying , we would n't have a faintest idea how to even start thinking of creating such a model for cells . 
  by no means i 'm dissing you - the work you are doing is indeed very important if we ever want to gain real understanding . 
  just keep in mind how far from it we really are . 
  someone probably did ... 
  i still do n't get the hate - plenty of designer brands do exactly the same thing , they just are n't honest enough to publicly admit it ... 
   if you 're a farmer in a particularly undeveloped nation and you run out of water, 
  if you 're a farmer in a particularly undeveloped nation and you run out of water , it will have absolutely nothing to do with the usage of water in the developed nations ... 
   look at graphs of human population, 
  [ ok ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:un_desa_continent_population_1950_to_2100.svg ),
