   it 's increasing exponentially, 
  no , it 's not . 
  has n't been for a long time ... 
   stephen harper is unequivocally evil because of his desire to jail his own citizens in the name of money and power, 
  yup . 
  and that goes for pretty much every political leader in the world . 
   virtually every world leader current and past is unequivocally evil, 
  nailed it . 
   hyperbole much ? 
  oh ... for a while i hoped you actually got it ... 
   there 's no such thing as evil, 
  til hitler , stalin and pol-pot were just misguided , well meaning dudes ... 
  no , i do n't . 
  what does `` bad for society '' mean ? 
  that 'd be hard to do ... 
  i 've tried second best : asked a few pretty dense dudes if they were stupid - all answered `` no . '', 
  asked several convicts if they were guilty - again the answers were `` no . '', 
  guess there are really no stupid people an the prisons are filled with innocents ... 
  dunno ... seems quite credible to me . 
  sure is . 
  there 's no profit in stopping rapes . 
   the term bitch is what a female dog is literally known as, 
  really ? 
  who would have thought ... !, 
  oh , so you are the kind of `` libertarian '' who only cares for liberty for himself ... 
  `` when they came for the potheads i did n't say anything because i was not a pothead ... '', 
   citizens risk becoming, 
  risk becoming ? 
  we already are . 
  was [ march on washington ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/march_on_washington_for_jobs_and_freedom ) mlk 's ( or [ randolph 's , perhaps ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a._philip_randolph ) ) `` personal army ? '', 
   do you ever stop to think critically about what you 're saying ? 
  do you ? 
  what 's the point ? 
  [ ask google ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civil_disobedience#choice_of_specific_act ) ... 
  is n't it funny how the cowards despise someone with balls to stand for what he believes in ? 
   the ones that were legitimately voted into office ? 
  so , you believe those `` legitimately voted into office '' are free to piss on constitution ? 
   you do n't seem to understand what treason is . 
  and you do ? 
  so what 's your opinion of jefferson , adams , franklin and the rest of [ those treasonous bastards ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_declaration_of_independence#signing ) ? 
   says the guy defending somebody who is calling for rebellion from his jail cell . 
  if you ever read some history books , you might learn it 's not unprecedented . 
  besides , kokesh is out of jail already . 
   you should work on your reading comprehension, 
  methinks you giving him too much credit ... 
   you realize that the united states did not exist at the start of the american revolution ... 
  but the british empire did . 
  that 's what they committed treason against . 
   whats a non libertarian , anyways ? 
  simple , someone who despises liberty ... 
  well , you seem to be quite butthurt over adam supporting liberty for mj crowd ... 
   but neither was it organized by just one person, 
  what makes you think adam can organize 50 marches on the same day all by himself . 
  you think he is some kind of super-hero ? 
   think he really believed in civil rights, 
  do n't be naive . 
  uhmm ... that 's ... the point ? 
  why would anybody want support from folks who are hell bent on stomping on liberties of others ? 
  you ** are ** opposing adam 's participation in pro-mj protest ... and what liberties potheads oppose ? 
  the fact remains , before the war there were lot of mutual admiration between mussolini , hitler and some of american politicians , fdr included ... why would it be so strange if jfk fell into that mindset ? 
   nope , i did n't oppose his participation in any protest . 
  < shrug /  could have fooled me ... most of your post from the last day voice your disapproval of adam 's involvement in that particular protest . 
  [ stop glorifying `` weed culture '' immediately ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/libertarian/comments/1f00z9/adam_kokesh_released/ca5lh4k ), 
  [ chill the fuck out with the weed ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/libertarian/comments/1f00z9/adam_kokesh_released/ca5hqrw ), 
  [ there 's a difference between demanding civil liberties and promoting weed culture . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/libertarian/comments/1f00z9/adam_kokesh_released/ca5lqwm ),

  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/libertarian/comments/1f00z9/adam_kokesh_released/ca5nebt ), 
  etc. . . etc. . . _ ad nauseam _, 
  shouting him down ? 
  he asked for quotes , i gave him quotes . 
   so which one of these comments is me disapproving of the protest or his involvement in it ? 
  all of them . 
  or is it a trick question ? 
   long story short , you ca n't attack an officer without serious consequences, 
  yes we know that . 
  and we know the officer can and will attack you without serious consequences . 
  all animals are equal but some animals are more equal ... 
  why you so mad ? 
  because you realize you would n't have the balls to even dream about doing what adam is doing , perhaps ? 
  you have to decide yourself . 
  someone is asking for money to set up an intervention : you need to decide if you want to donate/participate . 
  enough people feel the need to intervene it will be done . 
  how is he `` calling for war ? '', 
  by saying `` should one whole year from this july 4th pass while the crimes of this government are allowed to continue , we may have passed the point at which non-violent revolution becomes impossible ? '', 
  was jfk [ calling for war ? 
  ] ( http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/j/johnfkenn101159.html ), 
  iow there 's no remedy for tyranny ... resistance is futile , we will be assimilated !, 
  personally ? 
  at any point , if i believed there 's enough support for the intervention to succeed , i would chip-in . 
  one would think [ james bond ] ( http://th02.deviantart.net/fs71/300w/i/2012/359/d/1/daniel_craig_as_james_bond_by_devonneamos-d5irvva.jpg ) had much better trigger discipline ... 
  i see ... _ red knows better than kokesh what kokesh means ... 
  by walking through gang 's ` hood you are giving consent to be mugged . 
  ftfy, 
   if by gangs hood you mean his house, 
  no , i mean mcdonald 's that 's located in a part of the town they claim as their territory . 
  and by `` mugged '' i mean mugged . 
  in my experience , assholes who accuse others of being informants/provocateurs without evidence , are most of the time snitches themselves ... 
  oh , yes . 
  almost exact parallel : tsa is a government agency ( you know , government as in bunch of dudes claiming some territory ) and the airports are businesses that happened to operate in the territory .
