  it 's not airports themselves that want to mug you , it 's the government agents . 
  yes it is trolling . 
  the post has nothing to do with ron paul and the big boner he gives you . 
  yes , they are . 
  they are also sexually assaulting me . 
  they stole my nail clipper . 
   just that they are n't breaking the fourth amendment . 
  of course they are . 
  never seen one showing a warrant . 
  and seizing nail clipper can not under any circumstances be deemed `` reasonable . '', 
   it 's the law of the land . 
  so were the fugitive slave laws ... 
  duplicitous would n't give a fuck and , naturally , ( s ) he does n't believe anyone else would . 
  how come the fascists never can come up with some at least marginally valid argument ? 
  if it quacks like a duck ... 
   except that nothing i 've ever posted would indicate to any sane individual that i support fascism . 
  actually , yes . 
  lot 's of what you post is in awe of fascist ideas . 
  you might not know they are fascist , though . 
  the benefit of public education ... 
   i hope all y' all recognize that in ancapistan there will be ` police ', 
  nope . 
   and they may well push you around and hurt your feelings . 
  not any more than i could push `` them '' around and hurt `` their '' feelings . 
   this neutron star would effectively consume it, 
  `` it '' meaning what ? 
  earth ? 
  - definitely !, 
  sun ? 
  - most likely they would form a binary star system ... 
   no , the sun 's mass would be drawn into the neutron star if they were to collide . 
  ** if ** they were to collide ... not a very likely event . 
  heck , the sun would `` effectively consume '' earth , if they were to collide ... 
  in the op 's scenario , the neutron star is pretty damn close to earth - it would swallow her , and then form a binary with the sun . 
  you 've been rudely defending the star and bashing the fords at any opportunity for the past few weeks . 
  i 'm curious to see what your response will be when the video does n't come out . 
  nah , serbs and russians get along just fine ... 
  it would most likely be a very long time till the orbits stabilized . 
  ... but they still can not work for the same reason ... 
   communism can work if you let computers control logistics, 
  really ? 
  you can program computer to predict and accommodate for the next iphone ? 
   but he also uplifted the lower classes by a lot . 
  or , rather he 's `` downlifted '' middle class . 
  as someone once quipped : communism = equal distribution of poverty . 
  that , of course , does n't apply to the _ nomenklatura _ ; they are aok . 
   determine number of units sold at last launch . 
  i did not mean `` the next iphone '' to be taken literally ... 
  i mean the next hot thing that has n't been there before . 
  are you for real ? 
  or is it a plot for a dystopian novel you are writing ? 
  quite frankly , when they were sitting in a strip club they were n't beating the shit out of some poor bastard . 
  i put that in the `` good cop '' folder ... , 
   i think that hubbard was just straight up playing a huge joke at humanity 's expense . 
  rumor has it , he bet heinlein he can start a religion ... 
  kids ' soccer is pretty boring for the spectators - bunch of dudes decided to provide some extra entertainment ... , 
  but it 's for the children !, 
  is kim jong-un a co-sponsor by any chance ... ? 
   are un resolutions the law in manchester ,, 
  uhmm ... if you missed it : they are planning on making it the law . 
  the biggest problem in america ( and for that matter everywhere else ) is that most of the people are quite ok with government taking their liberty , providing their favorite party is in charge . 
  well , say you have your syndicalist community , obviously you will set it up on some land . 
  would it be ok for me to go there and build a factory and hire workers ? 
   collective ownership of the natural resources, 
  how is it supposed to work ? 
  can i mine for gold ? 
  if i can not , who can ? 
  who decides ? 
  just , please , do n't say `` the collective . '', 
  collective/society can not do deciding ; there has to be a person to decide . 
  even if you do the `` democratic '' deciding you can not possibly vote on every little thing ... 
   the problem is that property , and the definition/law surrounding it , is inherently `` forced '' . 
  how is property `` inherently forced ? '', 
  if you start from homesteading some land you are not forcing anybody . 
  from there , the land can be sold - still no force . 
  the only time force is involved is when someone wants to take it from you . 
   and considering we do n't even have enough jobs now , do you really think we 're magically going to find enough jobs for everyone once everything that can be automated has been ? 
  the very same concern was eloquently voiced back in the industrial revolution times . 
  it was as stupid then as it is now . 
  and you think england in the late xviiith century did n't have unemployment ? 
  luddites were dead wrong back then and they are dead wrong now . 
   most american-libertarians would hate him if he were alive today . 
  why ? 
  did i say you were a luddite ? 
  but you still buy luddites ' premises ... , 
   but he was definitely a leftist . 
  hey !, 
  some of my bets friends are leftists ... , 
  but no , i do n't mind leftists who are not statists : i might disagree with their prescriptions but if they do n't try to force them down my throat i 'm chill ... 
  but that 's ** exactly ** what luddites were saying ... , 
  `` neither did jews in weimar republic . '', 
  i 'm tired of those who are `` tired of ... '' anytime someone gets some spotlight , there 's bunch of whiners who are `` tired of . '', 
  used to be ron paul , than gary johnson , now adam kokesh . 
  do n't like him ? 
  do n't listen to him . 
  is `` weed culture '' a meme promoted by reince priebus ? 
  seems to be a battle cry of crypto-republicans nowadays ... 
  back then : `` okay . 
  let 's start with a hypothetical then . 
  let 's say there are 26 million employed people in the uk .
