  and further let 's assume that 20 % of them are employed in low-skill , easily mechanized jobs . 
  once those machines are online , you 've suddenly created a population of 5.2 million unemployed . 
  given that we 're already running an unemployment rate of around 8 % at this current time , where are the ` new ' jobs for these five million people going to come from ? '', 
   there 's also the fact that the employment ecosystem now is nothing like it was back then . 
  so what ? 
   you would be easier to take seriously if you would answer instead of sticking your fingers in your ears and screaming luddite fallacy . 
  uhmm ... it 's you who seem to be `` sticking your fingers in your ears and screaming luddite fallacy . '', 
  as to the answer : how the hell am i supposed to know what opportunities the future economy will bring ? 
  you take me for some kind of prophet ? 
  obviously , manufacturing will not be a huge growth industry - but it has n't been in us for quite a some time , if you have n't noticed . 
  but if you want me to speculate , there will be lots of the old geezers who wisely invested their 401k in the right industries and got filthy rich in the process . 
  they will be happy to hire you to wipe their asses . 
   my head would have been decapitated, 
  your head would have its head cut off ? 
  maybe he does n't want respect from that kind of people ... 
   thus , the only way to prevent tyranny is to completely replace and reset the government every 50 years or so . 
  ... or just get rid of it altogether ... 
   cooper 's gun , which she has owned for about 20 years , was legally purchased and properly registered , he said . 
  ughhh ... california !, 
  despots of all countries , unite !, 
  that part explains why `` the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed . '', 
   it implies the right to keep and bear arms is hinged upon the necessity of for a free state, 
  it does no such thing . 
  would you read ( hypothetical ) amendment : `` the well educated electorate being necessary to the working of a republic , the right of the people to keep and read books shall not be infringed . '', 
  as `` only the legal voting age college graduates can keep and read books ? '', 
   snowden has been called a `` traitor '' by house majority leader john boehner . 
  sen. dianne feinstein called the leaks `` an act of treason . '',

  ... and 43 % are clueless ... 
  hard to blame him - he does n't want to get audited , after all ... 
  he ca n't , they are all joos !, 
   protest , where ever you live , organize a protest, 
  afraid the times when protests were effective are well past now . 
  the next time you run into a mugger you may change your tune ... 
  nah , way earlier . 
  google `` whiskey rebellion . '', 
   as long as there is mass media , protests will be very , very effective . 
  that 's my point . 
   get redbull at no cost to her but at cost to taxpayers ? 
  it 's not `` at the cost of taxpayers . '', 
  the taxes you pay will not by affected by whether she gets the ebt or what she spends it on . 
  the government takes from you as much as they can get away with . 
  if they do n't spend it on ebt they will not give you the money back - they will spend it on bombing brown people or a new carpet for some flunky 's office ... 
  can you create a petition ? 
  sure . 
  will it accomplish anything ? 
  are you kidding ? 
  ... although not entirely without a reason ... 
   toss a human in a lion cage . 
  no contest . 
  he evolved claws and fangs , i evolved [ s&w 500 ] ( http://www.smith-wesson.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product4_750001_750051_764947_-1_757771_757767_757751_productdisplayerrorview_y ) ... 
   3rd avenue and jefferson is right in the center of phoenix 's `` government district . '', 
  it 's next to the county attorney 's office , city hall , and the public safety building . 
  that 's pretty bad ` hood ... 
  yup . 
  boooo !, 
  unfortunately , doug seems to be cursed with [ cassandra ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cassandra ) curse ... 
  he invented dynamite , not tnt . 
   but i do n't think that mr. colt deserves to have a peace prize named after him either, 
  he certainly would . 
  as the old saying goes : `` god created man , col. colt made him equal . '', 
  not having a real alternative might have something to do with it ...

  it 's up to you to decide how much privacy ( if any ) you are willing to surrender to your private security provider . 
  the government does n't give you any choice . 
  story ? 
  well , stasi were pretty effective too ... 
  if there are people willing to buy them then , yes , that 's the thing `` we '' need ... 
   you meet people .

   burning orphan babies is worse than slowly crushing puppies under foot, 
  not for puppies ... 
   you dont go into a grocery store , buy a loaf of bread , and sit on the floor eating it next to the cashier do you ? 
  i sure do when hungry ... 
  ... just make sure they do n't get any re-entry options ... , 
  wow !, 
  that has to be some kind of record : two hours and not even one post explaining how the good osiffers did nothing wrong , or at least how those are just a few bad apples ... 
  my neighborhood mugger relies on voluntary compliance of muggees too . 
  has n't shot anyone in ages ... 
   a law abiding citizen would be dead, 
  you are assuming they would be better shots than the girl . 
  do n't think it 's true on average ... 
   we still have a moonshine problem in the south and south-west portion of the state, 
  what problem ? 
  the cops certainly rule !, 
  remember the 8 cops shooting [ hundreds of rounds into toyota truck ] ( http://articles.latimes.com/2013/apr/23/local/la-me-ln-women-shot-by-lapd-during-dorner-manhunt-get-big-payout-20130423 ) ? 
  they are pretty lucky it was n't dorner in there ... 
  nope . 
  it 's a major inherent flaw in government . 
  look at it this way : if it were a flaw in businesses you would have to expand the government to fix it . 
  fixing the flaw in government ( shrinking it considerably or abandoning it altogether ) does n't require expanding businesses ... 
  not to mention expanding and adding more power to the government will only make it more attractive for the businesses . 
  so , is he getting grumpy ? 
   which i have been told translated to `` asshole . '', 
  not really . 
  `` dupa jasiu '' is an expression for saying you make no sense . 
  if government were too small to offer anything worth buying , nobody would . 
  hard to say , you sure it 's polish ? 
  the best i can think of would be `` posz\u0142a ty [ something ] '' which translates roughly to `` go away '' or `` get lost . '',
