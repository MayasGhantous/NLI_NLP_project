   if government were that small it would serve no purpose, 
  many people believe the only legit purpose of the government is law enforcement and defense . 
  sure , it still makes is `` worth buying '' for some businesses but the scope is pretty narrow - mostly restricted to the defense/law enforcement contractors and that can be easily restrained by transparency in bidding process . 
   big business would do whatever they wanted, 
  businesses ( big , small , and medium sized ) can not possibly do `` whatever they want '' ( unless granted government monopoly ) - they have to please their customers/workforce or they go bankrupt ( unless the government bails them out . ), 
   but it will impact us, 
  of course it will . 
  scores of politicians/bureaucrats are already salivating over new taxes and new power it will give them ... 
  well , you will really convince me when you show al gore and the climate hysteria crowd buying all the real estate in alaska , yukon , siberia and such places ... 
  when you buy for investment and rent it out . 
  exploit ? 
  no way !, 
  they are all do-gooders , it would be to provide living space for the global warming refugees ... 
  that would be a fastest celeron on the market ( g1620 ? ), 
  + motherboard ( asrock b75 pro3 ) + fastest memory it can handle ( ddr3 1600 , ca n't find any 64ks , i 'll throw in 2gig ) + fastest agp vid ( since the motherboard can not handle agp i 'll give you geforce 210 pcie ) + fastest ide 15gig hard drive ( can not find 15gig either , give you a larger one maxtor 80gig ) . 
  that will be $ 594.00 + shipping and handling . 
  ( the box is from around yr 2000 , $ 99 every 2 yrs ) nice doing business with you , 
  did n't dubya just say obama is continuing his legacy ? 
  seems like a good clue they indeed are quite the same ... 
   but the school has the right not to be associated with porn, 
  say , if he was playing bridge , were the school to `` to have a right not to be associated with card games ? '', 
  hmm ... so , why are bees [ dying in uk ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8680000/8680500.stm ) too ? 
   i 'm very happy to pay for all that stuff and more . 
  i 'd happily pay more taxes so that other torontonians get better services . 
  so , why do n't you ?

  may your chains set lightly upon you , and may posterity forget that ye were our countrymen . 
   when i introduced her to the cop , he outright refused to hear what she had to say because `` how do i know she is n't your girlfriend ? '' . 
  you should have asked him how did he know the cabbie was not a father of your psycho ex ... 
  the system itself should be fixed . 
  i 'm not quite sure it 's much better to send the innocent dude to prison for life . 
  smart people do n't need to read safety labels . 
  they have common sense . 
   basically he makes the rhetorical argument that slavery in the southern us was n't as bad as slavery elsewhere . 
  and , obviously , you must have some evidence it was as bad as slavery elsewhere ... ? 
  iow , sowell is `` intelectually bankrupt '' because he does n't share your biases ... ? 
  the one with `` shoulder thing that goes up '' aka scary looking rifle ? 
   he also wants to curtail the use of guns with features that seem to have no other purpose than to commit mass murder . 
  you mean `` shoulder thing that goes up ? '', 
  or bayonet lug ? 
  or perhaps pistol grip ? 
   had the police been , say , on a patrol and stopped one additional homicide ,, 
  nah , that could be dangerous ... besides , where 's a profit in that ? 
  you mean `` standard capacity magazines ? '', 
  weapon manufacturers do n't care what magazines they manufacture . 
  gun owners do . 
  that 's pretty obvious : the customer is always the king ... 
   do you think the us made a profit from the war ? 
  haliburton ? 
  yes !, 
  when most of the car buyers start demanding 5 wheels , it ** will ** become a standard . 
  right now you are just a weirdo ... , 
   your logic was flawless !, 
  yup . 
  always is . 
  you need to work on yours , though . 
   `` do n't propose something purposefully stupid hoping to make a point . 
  some idiot might actually think it 's a good idea and do it '' . 
  obviously you have no clue . 
  there 's a lot you still have to learn , grasshopper . 
  start from the [ customer is king ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=the%20customer%20is%20king ) phrase - it deos n't mean what you think it means . 
  if the manufacturer decides the standard , you are without a doubt running a `` standard '' itanium pc !, 
  what ? 
  you do n't ? 
  but back in 2001 intel decided it will be the standard 64bit architecture and intel was definitely the big kahoona of the pc cpu market . 
  so , what happened ? 
  the customer did . 
   as for fair tax prebates , i think they 're silly . 
  if you 're going to do a fair-tax prebate , why not just use progressive taxation directly . 
  the philosophy behind it being you are only taxed on exccessive consumption - basic needs being covered by prebate . 
  as i said , you have no clue ... 
   if microsoft suddenly decided windows would only run on ia64 chips , guess what dell would start shipping ... 
  or is that a trick question ? 
  is that what they teach you at the academy , osiffer ? 
  no wonder cops shoot so many people ... 
  well , still better than shooting live grandfather ... , 
  yes we do . 
   the memory is allocated in the executable and passed as a reference to the dll function , values are added via the reference , and then those are processed and finally deallocated back in the executable . 
  that 's actually not true . 
  when you push_back inside the dll , the vector gets resized . 
  the . exe allocated memory is deleted in the . dll and new memory allocated in there . 
  and memory for strings is also allocated in the . dll ... 
  forget vector , return char * of comma delimited names , allocate memory with : : globalalloc and , after parsing returned string , free it with : : globalfree . 
  iow , stick to c and windoiws api . 
  edit : alternatively , you could make another call to query for needed size and pass a pointer to memory allocated in . exe . 
   it 's illegal to come across the border of maryland with more than 2 packs of cigarettes . 
  yup . 
   i do n't know why they assigned 4 people from the siu and 2 forensic investigators, 
  because they need to work very hard to figure out how to make it look like ** not ** an exccessive force ... 
   kid calls cops pussies, 
  yup . 
  clear case of `` contempt of cop . '', 
  the only possible penalty is death . 
  you will . 
   there is a need for certain things to remain classified, 
  you might have had something here , if only there was some independent body deciding which things need to be classified . 
  as the matters stand now , the government decides that and there 's no appeal . 
  what prevents government from `` classifying '' anything criminal they do ? 
  nixon was an idiot , if he simply classified watergate and jailed bernsein and woodward , he would happily finish his term ...
