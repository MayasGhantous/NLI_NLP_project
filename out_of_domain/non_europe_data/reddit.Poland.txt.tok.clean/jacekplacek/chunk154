   what prevents the classification of criminal acts is the fact that 99.999 % of the people involved would report the criminal activity . 
  ... unless their bosses told them otherwise ... 
  somehow the 99.999 % missed the obviously illegal spying by the nsa . 
   both the executive and legislative branches of government knew exactly what the nsa was doing ,, 
  that 's my point . 
   and it was all within the constraints of law . 
  til the 4th amendment is no longer a law of the land ... 
  libertarianism is agnostic on the abortion question and rand never claimed to be a libertarian . 
   i guess the most watched news network , and the one that broadcasts some of the most blatant propaganda , does n't count as `` mass media '' ? 
  if you are talking about fox , they are mostly neo-conservative . 
  and neo-conservatism is in fact blatantly anti-conservative . 
  foreign aid : taxing the poor people in rich countries to give to the rich people in poor countries . 
  apparently , limey cops were not armed for a very long time ( still are n't ? ), 
  and i 'm pretty sure drunks wielding knifes are not that uncommon in uk . 
  does it mean the lowest of their cops are still less of pussies than the toronto finest ? 
   if it is mathematically guaranteed to provide some output given some inputs , then you can reverse engineer it . 
  can you ? 
  say , i can write , in less than an hour , a program which for every possible string of numbers is guaranteed to return another string of numbers . 
  always the same output for the same input . 
  without having access to the code , how would you go about `` reverse engineering '' it ? 
  sure , you need to supply only about \u2135 \u2080 inputs , no biggie ... , 
  not quite sure what you are trying to say ... what does the `` if '' have to do with it ? 
  all encryption algorithms , ferinstance , are `` mathematically guaranteed to provide some output given some inputs . '', 
  are you saying you could `` black box reverse engineer '' them ? 
   2256 is enough, 
  enough for what ? 
  edit : besides , for all ** practical ** purposes it 's almost \u2135 \u2080 anyways ... , 
  do n't know why you are getting downvotes . 
  we are monogamous mostly by social pressures . 
  whenever those pressures loosen up we mostly revert to `` fuck when there 's an opportunity '' mode ... 
  and ? 
  they will just appoint another one ... 
  `` individual wisemen are not responsible for everything done by mafia . '', 
  ftfy, 
   in an ancap society you still need law enforcers, 
  no , you do n't . 
  there is no justification in an ancap society for some animals being more equal ... 
  interesting ... 
  so , if the neighborhood gang kills less people than they have members , killing them in self-defense is immoral ? 
  it might be your grandson who gets chosen for cleaning at tacobell vs going to college ... 
   i guess you could say that the algerians did this sort of cop-killing thing and eventually achieved their strategic goals . 
  yes . 
  ** and independence from france has been a disaster for them . 
  but that 's quite a different topic . 
  independence has been a disaster for them because of the government they chose to establish ... 
  as you yoursef have noticed , when it comes to the point of direct self-defense , you are already outnumbered , outgunned and out manuvered ... 
  basically , what you are saing is `` we are all screwed and there 's nothing we can or should do about it . '', 
  ... said a jew being lead to the gas chamber in auschwitz in early 1943 about [ mordechai anielewicz ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mordechai_anielewicz ) ... 
   even in a society without a state , there is still going to be legal systems based around private laws ( most of which are unlike to be based on the non-aggression principle ) , there 's still going to be some form of authority and there are still going to be police officers, 
  iow , there will still be some animals who are more equal ... 
  it 's kinda funny how some who call themselves anarchist just crave another boot on their necks . 
  at the very least not to badmouth the few who are trying to do something or suggesting some kind of action . 
  do n't agree with the action - say so . 
  just do n't call them names or sugesst they should be shunned/banned/whatever ... 
  yup . 
   i did n't mean `` not welcome '' as in a bannable offense ; i just meant that it does n't fit with ancap theory and the nap . 
  ... as ** you ** interpret it ... 
   sorry , killing cops is fucking stupid, 
  again , that 's ** your ** particular opinion . 
  it might be `` stoopid '' but at least that 's some action the dude is proposing . 
  you , otoh , are glad to just bitch on reddit and take no action at all . 
  and no , signing petitions is not a valid action ... 
  for all those who say some cops might be innocent of any agression : they are not . 
  there 's not a single cop who did n't write a ticket or arrested someone for victimless `` crime . '', 
  and if he is a rookie who just started - he will soon . 
  so , killing them might not be exactly self-defense but it still is a defense of the next victim . 
  better yet $ 50 : that would lift everybody into upper-middle class ... / s, 
   because i do n't eat up easily digestable ` us vs them ' bullshit without thinking about how things went from both sides ? 
  no , because you have no problem with killing 95yr olds ... 
  but vorbiss 's assesment seemst to be correct : you ** are ** in fact a pussy ... 
   do you really not give a shit about any police officer 's life, 
  no i do n't give a shit about any power hungry bully coward 's life . 
  they , definitly , do n't give a shit about anybody else 's lives ... 
   and what if he kills himself ? 
  yup , we can allow that . 
  better to kill him first ... 
  you have absolutely no clue about the law ... to sue someone for not doing something they have to have a duty to do it . 
  the police do n't have a duty to protect anybody . 
  any such lawsuit would be summarily dismissed and the lawyer bringing it in scolded by the judge . 
   less than lethal, 
  obviously not . 
  so tell me why the police in the uk for the long time were not armed with anything other than the baton ? 
  yet they seemed to be able to deal with all kind of unruly dudes wielding knives , often young and fit not just 95 year olds ... 
  apparently , the bobbies back then were not cowardly bullies the us cops are now . 
  they are still going to ** charge ** him for the extra bandwith . 
  that means his modem ** can ** handle it . 
  yup . 
  had the same conversation . 
  switched to bell . 
   maddow would probably have us all tracked by the nsa . 
  and you really believe you are not tracked now ... ? 
   what we have now is unjust at best , and criminal at worst . 
  hey , it 's right there in the name : ** criminal ** `` justice '' system ... 
  not without a good reason , though ... 
  i 'm pretty sure he knows exactly he is full of shit - and laughs all the way to the bank ... 
  yeah , i know - he is not for dimwits ... 
  we ca n't . 
  but the machine is on a sure way to collapse : we need to be there for the aftermath to make sure it does not resurects itself ... 
  google `` cognitive dissonance '', 
  hmm , interesting ... how come if ` less equal ' ( meaning not a cop ) is charged with murder he is not getting paid ?
