  you would be much more convincing if you were equally outraged about the innocent chldren killed in iraq and afghanistan ... or waco for that matter . 
  hmm , does that put ** you ** in a company of cuba , afghanistan , zimbabwe , sierra leone , ethiopia , north korea , etc ? 
  dunno , mcveigh did not `` specifically '' kill those innocent people , he bombed the site of the government agencies , including atf . 
  our `` hero soldiers/airmen '' are/were bombing shit out of iraq/afghanistan killing lots of innocents in the process . 
  what 's the difference ? 
  burn the infidels !, 
  maybe they should n't prosecute unless they have a really good case ... ? 
  if you have a habit of attacking people , who walk in the same direction you do , and bashing their heads on the pavement , you shoud n't really be surprised when one of them shoots you in the face ... 
  i have mixed feelings on that . 
  assad really is a first class asshole and it would n't bother me at all if someone droned him and his flunkies ... perhaps that should be a way to deal with him . 
  well , he ** is ** evil ... 
  why ? 
  it was a clear case of self-defense . 
   thus the question arises : can regular expressions match only regular grammars , or can they also match more ? 
  the answer to this is both yes and no :, 
  huh ? 
  that question is completely irrelevant . 
  did it matter who owned ig farben or krupp back in the 30s/40s ... ? 
  if that 's what you request ... 
  you may want to read 1samuel 8 to them ... , 
   without trademark protection you could be buying a can with pepsi inside of it and nobody would do anything to stop it . 
  of course not true . 
  the dude selling you fake coke would be commiting a fraud . 
  you ( and other customers ) could sue his ass ... 
  the same way you can sue if someone sold you salt and called it `` sugar . '', 
  there 's no ip protection for `` sugar . '', 
  funny thing : bayer still sells aspirin , even though there 's plenty of cheaper generics on the market ... according to you it should be inconceivable , 
   how would you protect inventors from losing all of the money they put into developing patented inventions when somebody comes along , makes a minor change and undercuts the price ? 
  < shrug /  without patents , the inventor does n't have to disclose the process/ingredients/structure / what have you . 
  nobody is gon na reverse engineer it before it becomes a hit . 
  by that time the inventor , being `` first on the market , '' already has a recognized name/reputation . 
  sure , there will be competition at some point , still , as with the aspirin example , plenty of people will want to buy from him , even at a slightly higher price . 
  granted , the inventor might not become an instant gazillionere , but if he is smart about it he will not hurt ... 
  i do n't see how it 's misleading - it does n't say the pm labeled him that way . 
  btw , being called `` extreme '' by a watermelon has a touch of irony to it ... , 
  why ? 
  so they can use the money to bomb more brown people ? 
  obviously , not ** the only ** factor , but still a factor ... 
   nearly any scientist/sociologist that matters agrees race is a completely social construct, 
  til if the white couple adopts and rises a black kid , an east asian kid and a south pacific islander kid , they will be indistiguishable from kids of their ( also white ) neighbors !, 
  they should really secede from nyc ( or sell it to new jersey , where it really belongs ) - it 's two different worlds , unfortunately they have to share politicians ... 
  that 's a \u0439 , not a \u0442 . 
  so it 's nahooi ... 
   i wonder what his reasons were for turning it in . 
  maybe he was so far detached from a standard lifestyle that he just saw no reason to keep it . 
  or , perhaps , he was simply ** honest ** . 
  i know , i know - such a quaint notion ... 
   the general agreed interpretation, 
  except for the scotus and any competent english speaker ... 
   the state militia interpretation is widely accepted, 
  except for the scotus and any competent english speaker ... 
  [ that 's why . 
  _ it takes a lot of money to run a police state . _, 
  that 's what they want you to believe ... , 
  even more important : science should stay away from politics ... 
   cops that do shit like this are cowards , plain and simple . 
  most bullies are cowards . 
  he believes the customs of his tribe are the laws of nature ... 
  _ [ paraphrased from gb shaw ] _, 
  baaaaaa !, 
  til in socialist countries people work only 3 - 4 hours a day ... 
  well , actually you are quite right ... 
  ... but he never had purchased ar15 ... 
  your unwavering desire to defend the establishment , even if it makes you look like an idiot , is adorable . 
  even when they thought he used ar15 , they suspected he got it at the site , not `` purchased '' it . 
  since cnn is saying he `` purchased ar15 shotgun , '' the missing comma is not a good explanation/excuse . 
  besides , chiguy is well known pro-establishment troll , my comment was more about his lifetime achievements than the last post . 
   your initial outrage , evidenced by your comments, 
  link , please . 
   if he did n't purchase it , how did he come into possession of it ? 
  funny how you keep commenting on stuff you have n't even bothered to read about . 
  if you did you would know the initial assumption was he , indeed , stole it at the site of shootings ... 
  his purchase of the shotgun came to light quite recently , ** after ** the story of his using ar15 was already known to be incorrect . 
  btw , i have n't noticed ** any ** outrage over the cnn idiocy , more like amusement ... 
  so , next time you decide to jump to the defense of your beloved establishment , do at least ** some ** research - you might end up looking like an average troll , not like a retarded one . 
   i think they meant for there to be a comma in there . 
   `` purchased ar15 , shotgun '', 
  not really , there was a news quite recently about his purchase of a shotgun at the virginia gun shop . 
  no news about purchase of an ar15 . 
  also , the initial reports of him using ar15 turned out to be incorrect . 
   your headline looks more outrage than amusement . 
  your followup comments seem mad , not amused . 
  as i said , you need to pay more attention to earn any credibility as a troll . 
  it was not `` my headline '' nor my comments . 
  the only comments i 've made in this thread were the troll-biting ones ... 
   i do n't even own a tv nor go to their website . 
  your screenshot is the most interaction i 've had with cnn in at least a month . 
  that 's what most trolls say . 
   same goes for those thinking cnn had an agenda because they reported what leos were saying at the time . 
  leos were saying he ** purchased ** ar15 [ and a ] shotgun ? 
  link please . 
   i do n't really think that it [ ... ] changes the story much that they initially reported he purchased it . 
  well , it really does . 
  the story was about him ** purchasing ** the shotgun in virginia not too long ago . 
  not about the shootings . 
  since there 's no evidence of him purchasing a rifle - either cnn added the rifle to the story by themselves to spice it up ( the missing comma hypothesis ) or they thought the shotgun in question was an `` ar15 shotgun . '', 
   cnn reported what leos initially reported ,, 
  nope . 
  the leos never reported him ** buying ** the rifle and the shotgun . 
  unless you believe the leos reported him buying the `` ar15 shotgun . '',
