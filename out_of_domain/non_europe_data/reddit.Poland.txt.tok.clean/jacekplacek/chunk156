  i think you are giving them too much credit . 
  just make sure there 's no tracking device . 
  oh , and do n't bring water to anyone . 
   perhaps it 's drug money and could be used for rehab programs ? 
  you are incredibly naive . 
  if it 's drug money ( or the cops claim it is ) it will be taken by cops and spent on new gear for a swat team ... and donuts . 
   you did n't work for it , it does n't belong to you . 
  do n't keep it . 
  so , give it to the state and let them spend it on bombing brown people ? 
  you could give it to the feds ... if you prefer local cops , they will spend it on new tasers and tase the homeless . 
  old enough to realize it 's ** never ** a good thing to give money to armed thughs ... 
  dunno , i went to pa some years ago and i 'm still there ...

  `` i do n't need to outrun the spider , i only need to outrun you . '', 
   those are the killer feedbacks . 
  earth has lurched suddenly into a climate 5-6 degrees c higher than now a number of times in the past . 
  the original warming usually came from massive , long-lasting volcanic eruptions that put a large amount of co2 into the atmosphere -- but in every case it was feedbacks like these that carried the planet up into a temperature regime where there was a massive dieback of animals and plants .

   gwynne dyer is the furthest thing from a bullshitter you can find in the media business . 
  but the quote above is still beyound bullshit . 
  there 's absolutely no fucking evidence of any `` massive dieback of animals and plants '' due to warm climate . 
  quite the contrary - in all the warmest periods on earth both the flora and fauna thrived ... 
   and american will die earlier, 
  which one ? 
  are we allowed to pick ? 
  to be fair , the weapon being an ar-15 has absolutely nothing to do with the outcome in any of these incidents .

  yup , seems our ancestors killed off some large mammals , it would be hard to call it a `` massive dieback , '' though .

  somalia without government was much better off than with one . 
   people are not only not working this week , but they are losing their paycheck . 
  do i agree that government should n't be large and bloated ? 
  of course , but the fact is that right now it is . 
  we hired these people to do a job and to treat them so casually and to subject them to uncertainty to make a political point is cruel . 
  uhmm ... welcome to the real world . 
  everybody employed by the private sector can get laid off ( and `` lose their paycheck ) any time .

   there is significant evidence that the coins were stolen , yes , stolen , from the us mint , by either the grandfather , or someone whom he knew and then given/sold to him . 
  looks like a conjecture to me ... 
  since you are so well informed , you undoubtedly know one of the most plausible theories : george mccann swapping the older eagles for the 1933 ones . 
  ergo no stealing . 
  the mint melted them so the value of the gold was the same . 
  yes , it was illegal at the time . 
  so was harboring a fugitive slave at some time . 
  would n't surprise me if you were the kind of asshole who demands the descendants of the runners of the underground railroad to be forced to reimburse the descendants of the slave owners for their `` stolen property . '', 
   a better and more effective way to spend that same amount of money, 
  nobody prevents you from doing it . 
  you mean usually people refer to you as `` an asshole ? '',
