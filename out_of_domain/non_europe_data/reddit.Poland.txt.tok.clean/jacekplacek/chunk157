  the whole fucking system is the problem, 
  last time i 've checked obama was the head ( at least nominally ) of the system ... 
  uhmm ... bluehost , quite popular web hosting company . 
  it hosts my webpages as well - guess i must work for nsa ... / s < checking the bank account /  assholes never send me any money !, 
   stable over a long period of time, 
  you sure about that ? 
  tried to play some 90 's ( audio ) cassettes , they were degraded beyond belief ... 
   ok to paint all cops as evil thugs, 
  they do belong to the same gang . 
  kinda like taliban - nobody is saying we should n't lump all taliban as bad guys ... 
  tell you what . 
  imho the dude in a suv has shown remarkable restrain . 
  consider this : should you and your gang at any time run into me and my family , you 'd have an option if you wanted to discuss something . 
  you could approach , either single or in a very small group , in nonthreatening manner and politely ask me to consider talking to you . 
  and very important - at all times you would leave for me the option to easily extricate myself from the situation . 
  at any time , if i felt my exit route is being blocked and i 'd perceived any attempt at aggression from your bunch i would ** not ** wait and see if you were just trying to scare me , i would make absolutely no effort to diffuse the situation if i felt such an effort would hinder my chances of exit . 
  i would no longer consider you a group of human beings - at that point , you would become just a pack of wild dangerous animals . 
  and if my best option for exit involved killing , maiming or mutilating any of you , i would do that without a second thought , hesitation or remorse . 
  and i would keep doing it as long as it took for me to leave . 
  even more , if your gang kept chasing me afterwards , i would no longer try to escape . 
  i would start hunting you , running you over or broadsiding you or forcing you into ditches/bridges/other obstacles for as long as it took to convince you to run . 
  i know your ilk is kinda used to meek , whimpering , scared victims . 
  that was your experience so far . 
  but one day you are bound to run into someone who is not gon na bend over and pray for your mercy . 
  do n't start to cry `` no fair '' then . 
   first , i 'm not sure why you 're acting as if i was a part of that group , or part of a group that would do what they did , or someone who would attack people, 
  when it quacks like a duck ... 
   when i 'm arguing for pacifism, 
  no , you are arguing for the potential victims to stop fighting back , not for the aggressors to stop aggressing . 
  like a duck ... 
   seems like you have a little rage in search of a target . 
  nope . 
  i 'm , actually , quite easy going fellow . 
  always have been . 
  but even rabbit is going to strike out when cornered . 
   will they be any different when obama is gone ? 
  nope . 
  but you have to start somewhere . 
   it could n't possibly be that i think both are at fault , right ? 
  have n't seen you say that , so yes , probably `` right . '', 
   i 'm arguing for the potential victims to not become aggressors themselves . 
  self defense is not aggression . 
  you are arguing for the victims to not defend themselves . 
   doubt it . 
  no one likes to think they 're the bully . 
  the medium deteriorates . 
  sooner or later digital will go as well . 
   i am arguing for victims defending themselves with appropriate force . 
  do n't take a gun to a fist fight . 
  tell this to [ this dude ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/23/us/world-war-vet-beating-death/index.html ) ... 
  there 's plenty of religious libertarians around . 
  he is the second nukes general to be dumped recently . 
  is the system getting rid of `` unreliable '' ( that means those who would likely refuse some orders ) ones ? 
  obama is the beloved son of gop and the powers that be will kill them both if gop will not manage to shoot down the obamacare apple , meanwhile the bastards are shooting at gop ? 
  it does n't really make any other sense . 
   but go ahead folk , down vote ugly trolls , it is the libertarian way . 
  ftfy, 
   nobody is stealing from anyone - you agreed to follow the rules as decided by the population & representatives . 
  not anymore than the dude who 's got a business in a mafia area agreed to `` follow the mafia rules '' and pay for `` protection . '', 
   not a drop of appreciation for anything that anyone has ever done for you . 
  i can imagine joeblowme has a lot of appreciation and gratitude for everyone who did something ** for ** him . 
  he just does n't have a lot of appreciation for those that do things ** to ** him . 
   you did n't invent the method for oil refinery which single-handedly props up every breath you take and every cent you make . 
  sure he did n't . 
  neither did the bunch of thugs calling themselves `` the government . '', 
  the dude who did , managed to ** sell ** the oil to the willing customers and got handsomely paid for it . 
   you did n't figure out how to get rid of all the shit you make . 
  nope , he did not . 
  that 's why he is contracting with a company that does it for him , the company he ** voluntarily ** hired and pays the agreed fee to the mutual benefit . 
  unless , of course , he is unfortunate enough to live in a place where the bunch of bandits calling themselves `` a government '' force him to use their `` services '' at the price ** they ** unilaterally dictate . 
   you do n't deliver the water to your tap reliably in a way that you can use perfectly clean drinking water to flush your shit and have someone else deal with it, 
  see above . 
  that 's a beauty of a free market where everyone is free to contract ** voluntarily ** with everybody else for their mutual benefit . 
   and most importantly you did n't create an atom of natural resources, 
  oh , and the bunch of parasites who call themselves `` a government '' did ? 
   so who the fuck is stealing from who ? 
  well , it 's pretty obvious , is n't it . 
  the bunch of criminals calling themselves `` a government '' is stealing from everybody else . 
   who is greedy ? 
  see above . 
  and you !, 
   who lives in a fake world where any person can live free from the actions of any other single person . 
  it 'll never happen . 
  there 's too many fucking people to go and live in a cabin in the woods by yourself , shitting in an outhouse and lighting fires with sticks and stones . 
  google `` division of labor . '', 
  and no , the bunch of thieves who call themselves `` a government '' is not contributing to it . 
  what is there to argue ? 
  til calling matts2 the troll = = saying democrats are racist and republicans are not . 
  what argument again ? 
  hey , try to have some empathy for the dude . 
  he ** knows ** no woman in her right mind would fall in love with him and he is projecting ... , 
   at the time he had done absolutely nothing to deserve it, 
  you suggesting he did something since ? 
  i would give the conservationists much more credence if they were to re-introduce wolves into the central park . 
  it 's too easy to put dangerous predators into someone else 's backyard . 
   who else should be paying for transit in toronto ? 
  dunno ... how about transit ** users ** ? 
   if you answered `` no '' , then by your logic you should n't have to pay for schools or hospitals . 
   see a problem with that ? 
  nope .
