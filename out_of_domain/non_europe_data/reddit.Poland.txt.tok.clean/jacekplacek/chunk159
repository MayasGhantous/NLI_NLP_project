  that 's not the only choice . 
  why not `` nobody owns anybody , including themselves ? '', 
  you are not making any sense . 
  why ? 
  uhmm ... there 's already a tax on gas that `` fairly represents who actually really ` uses up ' our roads '' ... 
   taxed at the same rate, 
  have you checked trucks fuel consumption vs cars lately ? 
  they do n't want us `` bringing democracy '' to them ? 
  you do n't know what `` compare '' means , do you . 
  op cited goebbels , undoubtedly the expert on state propaganda , and heavenlytoaster simply commented on the quote . 
  where did you see any kind of comparison other than in your imagination ? 
  he ** quoted ** goebbels ... you see if i quoted [ carlin ] ( http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/445589-never-argue-with-an-idiot-they-will-only-bring-you ) in response to your comment , it would ** not ** be to compare you to carlin ... 
  ok , carlin was right . 
  i give up . 
  meh , we already know how stupid commies are ... 
  yeah , i know . 
  like all the non-communists in soviet russia were hypocrites for eating government-baked bread ... 
  god , are you guys stupid or what . 
  edit : supposed to be a reply to beeftech67 's below ( and sarcastic ), 
   is n't it a bit ironic to bitch about `` the stupid government '' on the internet , which was created thanks mostly to darpa funding . 
  the way i posted it it does n't make much sense ... oops ... 
  technically , he is telling you what not to do ... 
  can we stop with '' < some politician /  lied about < something /  ? '', 
  they are politicians , they lie . 
  all the time . 
  about everything . 
  what should make a news instead should be '' < some politician /  did n't lie about < something /  . '', 
  if that miracle were to ever happen . 
  [ libertarianism ( latin : liber , `` free '' ) is a set of related political philosophies that uphold freedom as the highest political end . 
  this includes emphasis on the primacy of individual liberty , political freedom , and voluntary association . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/libertarianism ), 
  [ socialism is an economic system characterised by social ownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the economy . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialism ), 
  there 's absolutely nothing preventing someone from believing in `` individual liberty , political freedom and voluntary association ; '' at the same time believing in `` social ownership of the means of production . '', 
  and even ancaps would n't have anything against bunch of people forming socialist communities , as long as everything were on the voluntary basis ... 
   if you believe that the federal government has final ownership, 
  even the federal government itself does n't claim that ... 
  yet , as long as all participants agree , it 's still voluntary . 
  look at it this way : using a whip on your sexual partner is , definitely , against libertarian philosophy ... unless it 's a voluntary s&m relationship . 
  sure :, 
   the deed to the united states should conform to local statutory requirements and generally adhere to the following requirements :, 
   f. convey the land to the `` united states of america and its assigns '' , except in the case of indian trust lands , where the proposed insured will be `` the united states of america in trust for [ a named indian or tribe ] '' , and acquisitions of land in a different name when authorized by congress . 
  the land that was acquired by the us or deeded to her she , arguably , owns ( and even that might be really questioned since there 's no provision for it in the constitution . ), 
  does n't mean `` all land within us borders . '', 
  say , as a capitalist , do you believe in possibility of forming a corporation with shareholders ( not the state defined corporation , free market one ? ), 
  is that not voluntary ? 
  is n't ownership `` social ? '', 
  any dissenters can easily leave by selling their shares . 
  why would n't it work the same way for socialist community ? 
   so your proposal is that if citizens in your all-voluntary socialist society voice disagreement with policy , they will be expelled . 
  you do n't really have any reading comprehension skills , do you .

  you do n't have to know the real story to figure out `` giant leprechaun riding an unicorn did it '' is not very plausible . 
   the `` official story '' includes leprechauns and unicorns ? 
  might as well - would be as credible . 
   i thought it was always a bunch of pissed off muslims who wanted us out of their business . 
  ... who managed to make a whole us air defense system to abandon sop just for their comfort . 
  oh , and also convinced allah to suspend the laws of physics for the day . 
  leprechauns and unicorns would at least make a more appealing story , especially for children . 
   it kept the balance of power in an area that we desire stability . 
  could you , please , point me to the part of the constitution that task the military with `` keeping balance of power '' in some faraway lands ? 
  bet you believe in santa claus too ... , 
   should be held to a higher standard, 
  like winston churchill ? 
   `` when the term hooters is thrown out there , what comes to mind is scantily clad young ladies who wear tight shorts and tight shirts , '' said corbett athletics director jean-paul soulagnet . 
  uhmm ... kinda like cheerleaders ? 
  right after his death some people suspected he was poisoned . 
  should n't that be `` learnt ? '', 
  oh , believe me , i am pissed at the right people - the assholes who rob me of my money . 
  how they spend it is kinda irrelevant . 
   the society has rules . 
  but those are not `` society rules , '' those are massah 's rules ... 
   i am a libertarian . 
  i do not accept libertarian philosophy, 
  is n't it kinda like a marxist not accepting marx 's philosophy or a catholic not accepting the new testament ? 
   a dad with a knife is a lot more likely to kill the wrong guy than a police force and their detectives . 
  i would n't be so sure about it . 
  dad 's objective is to get the guilty one . 
  cops ' objective is to close the case . 
  look up `` project innocence '' for plenty of examples when they just get the first one they can pin the crime on , even if they have to lie , mess with witnesses and fabricate the evidence ... 
  sure . 
  and then they have to contract the old geezers charging top dollars to fix the mess the young hot-shot hackers created ... 
  would n't be surprised if it was the school pimping your asses out ... 
   why are older coders still in coding positions ? 
  in my case , because that 's what i love doing . 
  i 'm happy doing what i love , if i were to go into management i would be miserable . 
  no amount of extra money can compensate for that . 
  ... until you have to hire the old , even more expensive , contractors to fix the mess your cheap `` hot-shots '' created ... 
   i just ca n't take another second of this subreddit 's bullshit . 
   then the 4th is in effect . 
  `` the right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized . '', 
  i have kinda missed the part that say `` but it 's ok if it 's only certain people who do the violating '', 
   and `` american police state '' is a perfect example of hyperbole , a perfect example of someone who has not learned the history . 
  hmmm ... 
  so what does the us lack to be called a [ police state ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/police_state#features_of_police_states ) ? 
  according to the constitution . 
  last time i 've checked it was supposed to be the highest law of the land . 
  apparently op is right about `` constitution-free zones . '',
