  afraid they extend to the whole us , not just the 100 mile area . 
   i see an active opposition party that has done an excellent job in thwarting the majority party . 
  remarkably few republican leaders have been arrested for opposing obama . 
  they are just the two wings of the same ruling party ... 
  did you mean i talk like a fag and my shit is all retarded ? 
  yeah , i know . 
  i should n't really expect you to get it [ dear dr. lexus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/police_state#features_of_police_states ) . 
  not that i have any hope of you getting it even now ... 
  denial is not a river in egypt ... 
   i suggest you read up on real police states . 
  do n't need to . 
  was born in one . 
   that you disagree with both does not make them the same . 
  ok , enlighten us then . 
  what were ** significant ** policy changes between bush and obama administrations ? 
  obamacare ( apart from romneycare ) is not really that big of a change - gop only makes a big stink about it because they need something to show how they are different . 
  and , frankly , it does n't really bear on the question `` is us govt becoming totalitarian . '', 
  neither do non-issues like abortion or gay marriage . 
  police state can easily find itself of either side of either issue . 
   from where i sit you guys are gop light . 
  from where i sit you guys are pol-pots light . 
  so , bite me . 
   but even so i did not see gary johnson getting arrested . 
  you do n't need to arrest ( or otherwise persecute ) if you can successfully marginalize . 
  smart despot will only take more direct action when the subject is getting really dangerous . 
  and even then only action sufficient to neutralize the threat , nothing more severe . 
  your concerted efforts to ignore/smear/cheat when ron paul started to gain some support are the perfect example . 
  poland . 
  maybe he is being paid to shill ? 
   private control means you exhibit discrimination against others over the thing ( s ) you control using whatever means necessary up to , and including , force . 
  does it mean it 's ok for me to fuck you up the ass ? 
  otherwise you would, 
  `` exhibit discrimination against others over your ass using whatever means necessary up to , and including , force . '', 
  would n't you . 
  what ? 
  hurt your feelings ? 
  looks more like you can not come with an argument for the points i was making , so you 've just took the easy way out . 
  do n't want to be compared to the unsavory characters do n't start comparing others . 
   if he has ever paid for any kind of sexual services . 
  you know it 's not illegal in canada ? 
  right ? 
  i do n't recall you pinko-commies to be outraged when blessed jack layton was caught in a `` happy ending '' parlor ... 
  stop whining and submit some quality posts ... , 
  stuff changes , who would have thought !, 
  you mean there are only two non-commies in canada ? 
  i knew it !, 
  oh , the `` commie '' moniker is customary being used to describe all kind of delusional left-wingers ... 
  ... but it has a potential of harming some people 's job security ... 
  it annoys them , which is quite fine with me . 
  flipmode thinks he has a chance to become a stasi ? 
  can i rat myself out ? 
  could use $ 500 ... 
  `` an ye harm none , do what thou wilt . '', 
   if by point you meant a garbage attack, 
  do n't play dumber than you really are , you know exactly what points . 
  and i consider calling me a republican as insulting as calling some leftwinger pol-pot . 
  til taking away someone 's driver license magically makes him forget how to drive . 
  funny thing , after all these `` scandals '' i 'm finding myself actually starting to like the dude ... 
   as a native arabic speaker , i was able to see through this bs real quick, 
  why would iranian president speak arabic instead of farsi ... ? 
  why , it 's a cat of course ... , 
   do you mean how i want to bomb cities in faraway countries ? 
  how i want to destroy all privacy ? 
  or maybe that you do n't have a clue about republicans ? 
  i did not say a thing about you , is aid that people who discuss which left-wingers they like ( che , chavez , trotski , etc. ), 
  are left-wingers . 
  if you have aproem being associted with them do n't associate with them . 
  this stick has two ends , you know . 
  `` contempt of cop . '', 
  the ultimate capital crime . 
  i guess you are talking about his father ( uncle ? ), 
  you forgot to mention that in a op ... 
  perhaps because you are tribal . 
  firefly is an epitome of individualism . 
  dunno , the fascist ( with the humane face ) universe where everybody is a good fascist vs the fascist universe where there are people fighting for their individuality ? 
  depends , if you are of a collectivist persuasion you probably will not enjoy it that much . 
  if you are more of an individualist , you definitely will . 
  nothing obvious about it . 
  he could have his brain directly wired to the net . 
  or , he could be a bot . 
  nope . 
  he would be ** in ** a computer ... , 
  hey , you ( i hope ) believe that raping you is not correct behavior . 
  are n't you ** forcing ** me if i do n't share your belief and want to rape you ? 
  unfortunately , most people tend to accept suffering lots of abuse instead of being killed . 
  so , this stuff will never stop . 
   it 's in wtf because some people are stupid and think it 's a bad thing . 
   or it 's wtf to people outside the us . 
  til shadefox thinks people outside the us are stupid ... , 
  never could understand how people can even think this might be a good argument . 
  say , you are home with your family and some people with guns are trying to force their way in . 
  even if you really believe having a gun is not a good solution , at the very least you are going to call the cops and hope they will show up soon enough ... and ** bring their guns !, 
  funny how that works :, 
  clinton lies - `` it 's not your fucking business , that 's his private life we are talking about ! '', 
  ford lies - `` burn him !!! '', 
  because the fucking internet is not a local toronto 's network and if i brought up layton most of the readers would n't know wtf i was talking about ... so , substitute layton for clinton above and it describes your bigoted ass to a t. . . 
  but you do have plenty of night ... , 
  you do n't get it : their ears exploded long time ago ... , 
  not the whole computers but i have 2 motherboards/cpu/ram , one itx amd athlon ( dual core ) with 4g of ram another one miniatx intel dual core with 2g . 
  you would need to supply cases/pss and hard drives yourself .
