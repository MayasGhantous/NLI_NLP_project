  c. s. lewis had [ something to say about that ] ( http://quotes.liberty-tree.ca/quote_blog/c..s..lewis.quote.e1e7 ) ... 
   what he may not understand, 
  he should n't have commented on the things he does n't understand . 
  do n't know about you but i try not to comment on stuff i do n't understand . 
  besides there 's a difference of impact between some anonymous dudes on the internet voicing their opinions and the leader of the catholic church doing the same . 
  only idiots do n't . 
  < shrug /  no point in explaining that to you ... 
   maybe the pope really assumes he understands economics . 
  how would he know otherwise ? 
  intelligent people are quite aware of what is and what is not in the area of their expertise . 
  for instance , even though i took a course in quantum mechanics back at the uni , i 'm aware i 'm far from being expert on it . 
  that keeps me from commenting on the topic . 
   paul krugman assumes he knows economics too, 
  i have a suspicion he knows what he is publicly saying is a load of bs - he just sees a profit in saying it . 
  iow i believe he is just an intellectual whore ( no offense to the hard working whores , 
  you guys learn your geography in a social studies class ? 
  do you learn your biology in drama class by any chance ? 
   unless you were 100 % behind him , you hated freedom ... 
  well , if you voted in republican primaries and did n't vote for him , you do in fact hate freedom ... , 
  nope . 
  i was born that way . 
  i had my schooling in a country where the name of the class that teaches geography is ... 
  `` geography . '', 
  imagine that !, 
  i guess your social studies teacher forgot to mention there are countries in the world which are not named usa or canada ... 
  i guess you are n't really any good at estimating probabilities . 
  hint : google `` birthday problem . '', 
   the chances that this guy knows the subject in the letter that 's now making it 's way through the conservative blogosphere is pretty damn low . 
  again , you do n't get probabilities . 
  the chances that ** some ** redditor knows someone that is related to someone who was covered by ** some ** blog/news site are pretty damn high ... 
  < sigh /  do n't have time nor patience to explain the error in your thinking ... keep on believing what you wish . 
   it was a trivial example , but in another 30 seconds , wolfram built a code snippet that defined the countries in south america and displayed their flags . 
  okaaay ... type `` south america flags '' in google and that 's what you will get . 
  where 's the miracle , again ? 
   you may end up committing a felony, 
  `` who pays the piper , calls the tune . '', 
  do n't feed the troll . 
  funny , some people still believe you can spend yourself into prosperity ... 
  not true . 
  we were ** always ** at war with eurasia . 
  silly rabbit !, 
  tsa is not for catching terrists , it 's for teaching the people how to be good little peons . 
  well , he married a rodham and she is one . 
  remember , the best way to achieve success in us politics is to chose the right family to be born into . 
  or marry into one . 
  did you notice the successful criminal gangs only get to be successful when they satisfy a demand for goods/services the ** government ** either prohibits or taxes excessively ? 
  the purely criminal ( as in _ mala in se _ crimes ) ones never get to be successful for a long time , unless helped by the government policies ( ny mafias helped by sullivan laws , outlawing self-defense ferinstance ? ), 
   it 's a private party 's rules on private land, 
  from tfa :, 
   stop selling because ** city ordinance ** bans commerce like that without proper approval . 
  since the dude is not running for a grammar teaching position , it would n't be a proper question . 
  til freedom means the government decree ... 
  no doubt about it : catholic church is a firm believer of `` trickle up '' economics ... 
  well , go for it then !, 
  spend your own money on it . 
  you might try to find others with similar interests and pool your money to your common benefit . 
  but why would you want to force me to spend my money on it when i 'm more inclined to fund a research on why heterosexual gals are either too skinny or too fat , never quite right ? 
  ( i know you are kidding , btw , 
  link ? 
  sue the bastards !, 
  should prove to be worth bunch of $ $ $ ... 
  thx . 
  obviously , if he just shot the dude he could have claimed he feared for his life ... 
   someone disagreeing with you, 
  no , no , no ... !, 
  someone disagreeing with reddit 's hivemind . 
  how does it refute what edgarallennope said ? 
   turned his influence in poor directions, 
  you mean he does n't share ** your ** biases ? 
  obviously he must be evil ... / s, 
  you put limits on your women too . 
  just different limits . 
  funny how most people believe `` customs of their tribe are the laws of nature . '', 
   you miss the point : do n't cover you head and a man will hit you with a cane . 
  you miss the point : do n't cover your tits and a man with a baton/gun/taser will haul your ass into jail ... 
  everything has a potential to offend someone , the best approach is `` sticks and stones ... '', 
  depends on the lottery ... 
   encouraging the widespread and institutionalized discrimination against a class of millions of people trying to live their lives is evil by any meaningful definition , yes . 
  quite frankly it 's bs . 
  the whole issue is over what is the definition of marriage and weather it should be changed . 
  if it 's going to be changed for the gay people why not for the polygamists , ferinstance ? 
  have n't heard much protests about the laws disallowing group marriages , have you . 
  so , if defining marriage as `` between one man and one woman '' is discriminating against gays why do n't you consider it discriminating against polyamorists ? 
  and why his opinion on obamacare makes him evil ? 
  he seems to share it with the majority of americans - are they all evil ? 
  depends on the point of view : obviously , the owners do n't think so . 
  as to the taxpayers , most people enjoy sports . 
  the money they pay in taxes will be spend on something , so if they have a choice of the highway to nowhere , new office furniture for the bureaucrats , the shiny new tank for the swat team or the new stadium - is it really that dumb to pick the stadium ? 
  unless you really think ahmadafly personally `` puts limits on women , '' you seem to be aware of the curious property of the pronoun `` you : '' it can refer to the much broader category than the person addressed . 
  in this case to `` your society . '', 
  and yes , your society does put limits on women . 
  yes , you are . 
  it means `` moral responsibility . '', 
  most cops lost any morals they might have initially had . 
   folks like to advocate carrying where it 's illegal, 
  if you carry to protect you/your loved ones , how does some politicians ' say-so make you decide to not protect yourself/them anymore ? 
  either you are in the right to carry or not , legal has nothing to do with it . 
  tell me where you live and i tell you how your society limits women . 
  if it 's in ny or some such that 's a [ good example ... ] ( http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/bklyn-woman-arrested-sunbathing-topless-article-1.1479588 ) ( might be nsfw ), 
  so , which senator in your opinion deserves more coverage here ?
