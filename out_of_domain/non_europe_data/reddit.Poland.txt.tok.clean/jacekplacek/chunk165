  should n't we just import whatever keeps them in check in asia ?

   considering that there was a mass shooting almost everyday last year, 
  only if you count mass shooting of paper targets ... 
   there are legitimate and overwhelmingly prevalent uses for hammers that do n't involve inflicting bodily harm, 
  most uses of firearms do n't `` involve inflicting bodily harm '' either ... 
   please show proof that more guns means more safety .

   i am no `` gun grabber . '',

  `` commie '' is a customary moniker for any type of delusional left wingnut ... 
   it 's also its only legitimate function . 
  hmm ... 
  i shoot a lot of paper targets , never inflicted any bodily harm on anybody . 
  guess my guns are used illegitimately ... 
   false . 
  the gun murder rate of aussies has dropped drastically , and their overall murder rates have dropped more than americas . 
  someone is either misinformed or just outright lying ... quick google finds ozzie homicide rate [ dropped from 1.9 to 1.3 ] ( http://www.aic.gov.au/statistics/homicide.html ) in 18 years , while us rate [ dropped from 9.8 to 4.8 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crime_in_the_united_states#homicide ) ... 
   if you 're going to argue that most uses of a firearm are at a range , that 's just practice for its intended purpose . 
  i do n't intend to shoot anyone and i do n't hunt . 
  still spending lots of time at the range ... you know nothing about the guns use and just repeat what you hear from idiots on tv . 
  service . 
  say , if i do your taxes in exchange for you mowing my lawn , technically it 's a barter transaction . 
  i guess the state want to tax you ( and me ) as if we got an income equivalent to the value of respective services . 
  same if you have sex with me in exchange for your taxes . 
  / u/ashrep is simply wondering if the state might realize consensual sex is an exchange of services ... , 
  there 's plenty of libertarians who are not big abortion fans ... 
  you kinda forgetting there are other bodies involved ... 
  there 's a popular misconception that those people are `` anti-gun . '', 
  they are not . 
  they are against us , peons , having guns but they are quite happy having guns for themselves/their bodyguards . 
  oh , do n't get me wrong . 
  i 'm all pro-abortion with one caveat : it should apply past pregnancy - till the brat moves out . 
  if every law has to expire in 19 years should n't the law to make it so expire as well ? 
   what harm does a woman getting an abortion do to you the individual ? 
  well , with that kind of mindset , it should n't bother you if the majority decided it 's ok to kill buddhists ( assuming you are not a buddhist . ), 
   but it is easy to make an argument that the baby is trespassing within the woman . 
  i believe trespass has to be conscious/voluntary to be an offence ... 
  besides , even if it were a trespass , is it ok to kill trespassers who can not control their trespassing ? 
  say a dude falls from the cliff and lands on my property unconscious , is it ok for me to kill him ? 
  i avoided saying `` murder '' on purpose . 
  abortion is definitely killing . 
   the only currency `` mandate '' is the one that involves courts allowing individuals to settle their debts with usd . 
  you might want to convey this good news to mr. 
  von nothaus of the [ liberty dollar ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberty_dollar ) fame . 
  he will be thrilled to get out of jail promptly thanks to your unassailable logic ... 
  lol , counterfeiting ... one former da used to say he could indict a ham sandwich , guess there are das who can convict one . 
  von nothaus was pretty explicit in saying the liberty dollar was ** not ** a federal currency . 
  as a matter of fact that was the very point of the liberty dollar : to be a ** competing currency ** . 
  i bet you believe all the dudes [ vyshinsky ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andrey_vyshinsky ) prosecuted were really the enemies of the people ... 
   are you claiming that nothaus was tortured into a confession ? 
  are you claiming the only way to convict someone who did nothing illegal is to torture him ? 
  unfortunately for nothaus , `` oops i did n't mean to '' is n't a valid defense ,, 
  it 's not `` he did n't mean to '' , it 's the charges are complete and total bullshit . 
  he never distributed liberty dollars under false pretenses . 
  anyone who got them from him was not only aware they are getting a competing currency but that was precisely the point of the transaction . 
   particularly when he 'd already received notice warning him of impending indictment if he continued to produce the coins . 
  it takes the statist to imagine the massah 's `` warning '' has the same weight as the actual law ... 
  have you actually seen it ? 
  it 's no more similar to the us currency than honda accord to toyota camry ... 
  as i said , no more similar than accord and camry ... 
   if any animal darts into the road , he just became fair game, 
  try that with a moose ... , 
   speed limit signs are meant to keep us safer, 
  nope . 
  they are simply revenue generators . 
  it 's really hilarious how statists believe in some magical properties of the state posted signs . 
  according to your logic , on a stretch of highway with the posted limit of 65 , sam hornish jr. doing 75 on the sunny sunday morning in the summertime in his brand new bimmer is unsafe , while the old lady in an old clunker doing 65 in a snowstorm during rush hours is perfectly safe . 
  there 's noone as delusional as a statist !,

   but pretending that all levels of government are one monolithic mass of cynicism is n't going to help anyone either . 
  all levels of government are comprised of people , not saints . 
  you do n't expect the business ' employees to put your interest above theirs , why do you believe the government workers do ? 
   it 's subjective higher value , not some absolute universal value . 
  all values are subjective , there 's no such thing as `` absolute universal value . '', 
  you simply never allowed it to be `` set naturally '' ... 
   both parties are right-wing by any international standard and fiscally even compared to the us ' past .
