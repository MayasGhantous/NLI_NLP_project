  is ` bel ' or ` dc2 ' a valid unix file name ? 
   cops did n't stop mexicans from coming here, 
  there are plenty of mexicans practicing shooting for the sole reason of being able to waste an asshole like you ... 
  but ... but ... but we were told we were paranoid ... 
   greece 's market-driven system has broken down , a victim of endemic corruption , budgetary mismanagement by the state and the overbearing demands of global financial markets . 
  market driven ? 
  that 's hilarious in its own right ... 
  you have just voiced a desire to shoot people who came here from mexico . 
  yes , that makes you an asshole . 
  most likely makes you a psychopath too ... 
  back in 1920s , in reaction to a report of several fatalities resulting from bathtub gin , defective811 says : `` warning , alcohol is dangerous ! '', 
   bet that plumber made more than all of them in the lab . 
  ftfy, 
  dunno , they could have one plumber and 10 bullshit artists on payroll . 
  ( the one plumber for an unlikely event someone will agree to the estimate . ), 
  their business plan might simply be charging $ 50 for the 10 minutes of the ` estimating . '', 
  the urban voters tend to screw the rural ones over pretty consistently . 
  you need some way to balance that ... 
   obama got into his school not because of his grades , but you can bet his kids do very well in school . 
  ... yet still they will have a better chance to get admitted to the ivy league law school than the children of a redneck with better grades/lsat scores ... 
   but i taught her not to be a prick, 
  did she end up being a pussy or a cunt ? 
   so much for the massive spy network being used to ` protect ' us from terrorism . 
  it 's to protect ** them ** from ** us ** ... 
  whether it is happening or not , still obama promised in the sotu address to make it happen ... hey , perhaps it 's his plan to improve economy by more gun/ammo sales . 
  i 'm the other way around - pretty decent shot with a handgun , not so much with a rifle ... 
  probably because i 've been shooting handguns for quite a while but only recently bought my first rifle ( marlin 30-30 . ), 
  i guess i need someone to show me what am i doing wrong with it . 
  let me get this right : rocco tried to bite some dude and the dude fought back ? 
  because you live near hollywood , you know all has-beens and you know everything they said to everybody ? 
  should we rename / r/toronto to / r/robford ? 
  ... or a pig ... 
  i would phrase it a little bit differently : if you need advice on writing a programming language , do n't . 
  unless you 're doing it strictly for fun/education ... 
  why were n't they allowed to leave the ship by the greek government ? 
  as bad as the owner is , surely , the government had a prominent role in their problems . 
  they were kinda jailed but without getting the food ... 
  that 's a joke . 
  kinda like politics : _ poly _ means ` many ' and ticks are blood-sucking parasites ... 
  why are collectivists so devoid of sense of humor ? 
   explain why they would do it then . 
  he already did . 
   but let 's not pretend like selling tylenol is the same as selling cigarrettes . 
  that 's a silly equivalency . 
  dunno ... acetaminophen can kill you pretty fast ( and painfully too , ) it takes years for cigarettes to kill you, 
  you are deluding yourself thinking it 's something uniquely american . 
  no matter what the system , people go into government for their private gains . 
  and those who need a favor from the government ( and have means to re-compensate for it ) will always find a way to provide those gains , be it direct bribes , campaign `` contribution , '' hiring the nephew or promising the board of directors ' seat ... 
  there are no saints in politics - the most likely dudes to win are the sociopaths and they are in the majority in any government . 
  you would be surprised ... 
  if you count the years of life lost , acetaminophen is much more potent poison . 
  think of it that way : children hardly ever die from smoking , not so from liver failure thanks to acetaminophen . 
  you have to admire the determination : would you really want to shear a rat ? 
  `` gain '' does not necessarily mean `` financial gain . '', 
  lightning speed , compared to cigarettes ... 
  hmm ... 
  enabling act was granted in 1933 , guess uncle adolph `` really did suck at being a dictator . '', 
  i believe the last u is ( almost ) silent . 
  [ the atlanta declaration ] ( http://lneilsmith.org/atlanta.html ) :, 
  `` every man , woman , and responsible child has an unalienable individual , civil , constitutional , and human right to obtain , own , and carry , openly or concealed , any weapon - rifle , shotgun , handgun , machinegun , anything - any time , any place , without asking anyone 's permission . '', 
  neil smith _, 
   hmmm , and where did he choose to deliver his outrage ? 
  and where would you want him to deliver it ? 
  there 's no unbiased media outlet out there . 
  so , his only choice was to either go with the one that would have him or not to say anything ... 
  have n't really heard nobody calling retires `` freeloaders '' ... and the politicians/gov bureaucrats are parasites rather than freeloaders - they do show up for work , after all . 
   nazi 's eugenics not only has very little scientific credibility , but also arbitrarily categorizes people into desirable and undesirable groups , therefore is , in fact , a ** corruption of the original intention of eugenics ** . 
  not so . 
  the whole philosophy of the [ eugenics ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eugenics#history ) was about `` categorizing people into desirable and undesirable groups . '', 
   if you have a pet dog in your household , for example , think twice -- you are actively and indirectly supporting eugenics , too . 
  different breeds of dogs arose because breeders selected sexually-mature dogs of desirable traits and mated them , and did the same for their subsequent offsprings in order to arrive at a stable , desirable trait . 
  no quite so either . 
  i have had many dogs in my lifetime , always mutts - never a deliberately crippled one ( so called `` pure breed '' . ), 
  but back to the topic : why did they even breed the giraffes if they have to kill them after they reach maturity ? 
  they knew that before they allowed his parents to mate , did n't they . 
   the confederates seceded their citizenship , there was no issue ov due process , they were soldiers ov another country, 
  you mean the civil war was really war of foreign aggression ... !, 
   if there was a united nations at the time , they would have voted justly for invasion, 
  on what grounds ? 
  did they `` vote for invasion '' when several republics seceded from soviet union ? 
  [ on march 4 , 1861 , seven slave states with cotton-based economies formed the confederacy . 
  outgoing democratic president james buchanan and the incoming republicans rejected secession as illegal . 
  lincoln 's inaugural address declared his administration would not initiate civil war . 
  ** eight remaining slave states continued to reject calls for secession ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_civil_war ), 
  you mean the union containing 8 slave states decided holding slaves was '' a threat to , breach ov the peace , and an act ov aggression ? '', 
  can you get more delusional than that ? 
  `` if voting could change anything it would be illegal . '', 
  tell me , was a horse potentially a man 's livelihood back then ? 
  you did n't get the joke : it was a friendly remainder to avoid posting stuff twice ... 
   the only way to currently change the system is to try to bankrupt it, 
  you can not bankrupt the system that has an ability to extract money from you ... 
  what do you mean `` no source ? '', 
  i have ( politely ) asked a question . 
  the behavior of dynamic systems with positive feedback is not something that needs to be explained to the scientist , esp . 
  one who is supposed to be an expert on one particular , highly complex dynamic system who is , pretty much , basing his entire career on the assumption of a positive feedback in that system . 
  besides , the common courtesy would require mods who delete my comments to let me know they do and state the reason . 
   a single u.s.-based institutional investor with no conceivable ties to al qaeda purchased 95 percent of the ual puts on september 6, 
  did this `` us-based investor '' have any `` conceivable ties '' to the us government ? 
  the whole debacle is based on an assumption the co2 is a ** driving ** factor . 
  iow it is overriding any possible negative feedbacks ( at least within a certain margin . ),
