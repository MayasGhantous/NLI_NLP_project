  for example , it could be a driving factor between mean earth temperature of 10 ~ 20 c. beyond that , the other factors would override its influence . 
  in that example , the only stable states ( barring other factors ) would be mean temp of 10 c and 20 c. 
  for the globular warmmongering to make any sense , we would have to be already at the low extreme for the infusion of co2 to be able to push us into the high one . 
  and for your bleeding metaphor , it misses the point completely . 
  it is an example of the negative feedbacks : the clotting restricting the flow and the drop of the blood pressure slowing the flow down . 
  and , yes , negative feedback systems can end up in any state in between ... 
  funny , plenty of `` no source '' comments in the circlejerk though ... somehow the mods missed them . 
   let me guess , it is cold today so you know warming is a hoax . 
  to be fair , any warm weather generates endless `` see , it 's proven `` s from warmmongers ... 
   no pause but thanks . 
   not assumption and a factor . 
  if it 's not a ** driving ** factor you can not make any prediction of the behavior of the system based on this factor alone . 
  you would have to have a perfect understanding of ** all ** the other factors to even speculate on the influence of the co2 levels . 
  obviously , the argument of wormmongers can only hold if it is a driving factor . 
  and , obviously , the runaway warming can only happen if the system becomes unstable . 
  so , we are back to my original question : why was it stable before ? 
  let 's see ... the acolytes of a highly politicized movement , pushing the expansion of government powers worldwide , based on a controversial theory and even more controversial predictions of the future climate and its effects on the `` planet , '' are stifling the debate on the merits of the theory ; but that should n't concern this subreddit - the libertarianism is only about `` how many trespassers can dance on the head of the pin '' after all ... 
   how come you have failed to get anything published since you have such great insight ? 
  how come you have not written up your findings ? 
  for the same reason , perhaps , galileo decided to ( officially ) abandon heliocentrism ... 
  when the religion with the support of governments disagrees with your findings , it might be foolhardy at the best and dangerous at the worst to publish ... you might be accused of heresy/denialism !, 
   or have valid science . 
  except you do n't . 
  you have simplistic misunderstanding . 
  ... said vincenzo maculani to galileo ... 
   perhaps you can show how one person has been imprisoned for warming skepticism , how one person has been threatened for publishing science on the topic . 
  [ funny you should ask ... ] ( http://www.climatedepot.com/2009/06/03/execute-skeptics-shock-call-to-action-at-what-point-do-we-jail-or-execute-global-warming-deniers-shouldnt-we-start-punishing-them-now/ ), 
  you wanted an example for `` how one person has been threatened '' - forgot to mention you want non-random post . 
  you have to work on your requirement-formulating skills ... 
  let 's do an experiment : post a threat ( could be even veiled an/or vague ) to obama on tpm and see if ss will consider it `` not serious . '', 
  how many presidential assassins posted threats on tpm ? 
   you claim that for 30 + years climate scientists have been intimidated by threats to their safety, 
  i do ? 
  i never gave you any explanation for not submitting , just a plausible explanation for why other poster did not submit . 
  i have perceived total lack of imagination on your part and just tried to be helpful ... 
  btw : funny how you believe the only things approved by an `` official '' committee can be valid ... 
  they do `` other things '' too ... otherwise there would be no cubs . 
  the whole `` sheepdog '' meme if full of shit . 
  sheepdogs are not there to protect sheep from wolves , they are there to make sure sheep do n't run away ... 
  ... and he can follow you stealthily home ... 
  you may be sure certain overseas agencies well know what really happened ... 
  the problem with you `` true believers '' is a circular reasoning : `` the conspiracy theorists are full of shit because the conspiracy that big can not stay secret - somebody would spill the beans . 
  some people are spilling the beans . 
  they must be nutty conspiracy theorists because [ back to the beginning . ] '', 
   but it 's not usually participants, 
  well , they certainly have a very strong disincentive to come forward , do n't they . 
  following your logic there were no serial killers since they did n't come forward . 
  for the jfk - actually , e. howard hunt did confess at the deathbed , still did n't convince the skeptics ... 
  darn , out of stock !, 
  anytime someone points me to a great deal , othre redditors just buy it out ... 
  should n't that be pretty obvious ? 
  the whole statist ( of any stripe ) ideology kinda makes untold assumption the people working for government cease being human and become incorruptible saints . 
  iow it relies on a total suspension of disbelief ... 
  you think you can train a scum to behave decently ? 
   unfortunately they mostly hire authoritarian assholes for the job .

  in poland ( us congress does n't make laws for poland yet  there 's no such thing as `` machine gun '' it 's either `` karabin maszynowy ( machine carbine ) '' or `` pistolet maszynowy ( machine pistol ) '' , for instance ... 
  ok , i will speak slowly : if , as you assume , the distinction is simply the lack of technical knowledge on the part of us congress , the other countries would n't make such a distinction . 
  as far as i know the definition is pretty similar all over the world , poland was just an example , based on my direct knowledge . 
  tl ; dr most of the world defines the thing in op 's image as a `` pistol . '', 
  us congresscritters ' knowledge or lack thereof has nothing to do with it .

  that 's true . 
  it pays to plan ahead , 
  the thing i do n't get : why did they shut the parks down instead of opening them up ? 
  if they did n't want to spend any money on the parks ' staff , why did they spend money on the people to keep you from getting in ?
