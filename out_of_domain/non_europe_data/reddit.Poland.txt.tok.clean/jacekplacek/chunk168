  if he is a nuisance to the neighbors they still can sue . 
  why would n't it ? 
   paying it back is an order of magnitude easier though . 
  assuming you graduate with a degree there 's high demand for . 
  flipping burgers will not make it easy for you to pay off your student loan . 
  we 're already subsidizing plenty of millionaires ... 
   it just shifts who pays for parts of higher education from taxpayers to students . 
  until the loans start bouncing . 
  then it 's back to taxpayers . 
  wait some more years and even burger flippers will become millionaires ... , 
  does n't sound like a conspiracy to me ... 
  i do n't get it . 
  if you had problems with your son would you call for mara salvatrucha or yakuza to help ? 
  why call the other gang ? 
   `` there 's very little reason why 15 calls to 9-1-1 were n't received , '' he said . 
  `` i do n't think there 's anyone who can watch that and say , ` ah , that 's a shame , ' and just walk away . '', 
  perhaps people are a little wary to call the cops , knowing how often , with the cops presence , the situation escalates to the point of someone dying ... 
  you might want to visit / r/bad _ cop_no_donut from time to time ... 
   conspiracy - a ** secret ** plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful [ _ emphasis mine _ ], 
   i do n't feel that the government is `` the enemy '' . 
  depends how you define `` enemy . '', 
  why the poor schmuck somewhere overseas , who only want 's foreign troops out of his backyard , an enemy while the dudes that rob you blind at home are not ? 
  how do you know ? 
  maybe he is laughing at you right now ... , 
  could n't they put even less text at one page ? 
  < / s  i just hate when they do that - i get it , the ads revenue and shit but they are really going overboard with it . 
  so , you know the dude ? 
  or do you think every job in china is filled by slave labor ? 
  no shit !, 
  looks like you have no idea there 's this thingie overseas called european union . 
  and brussels still does n't hinder business as much as dc does . 
  perhaps because they are still young - when they `` mature '' things might start to unravel ... 
   which government , specifically , is supposed to do whatever it is you want them to do ? 
  how about `` all of them ? '', 
  and how about `` get out of the fucking way ? '', 
  oh , so enlighten us clueless ones how does it work ? 
  and why there 's so much bullshit in starting an incorporated business in us . 
  so far all you did is hand waving on the topic ... 
  btw : i live in the us now and i do have a business ( sole proprietorship ) which i set up about 20 years ago . 
  i never went corporate partly because it 's a huge pain in the neck . 
  and , as i understand it , now it would be huge pain in the neck to even set up a sole proprietorship . 
   and how would you achieve that ? 
  start from the top ( federal gov ) and let the competition force the states/municipalities to follow the path ... 
   but it ca n't be done without a monolithic government . 
  sure it can . 
  see above . 
  how was the poor ossifer to know it was n't a light saber ... ? 
  hard to comprehend hand waving ... 
   you ca n't `` start from '' . 
  yes you can . 
  as i said just get the fuck out of the way ... 
   especially when those lines are going into areas that do n't have enough ridership to make it financially sustainable . 
  why build them then ? 
   choose to live on our plantation and partake in the advantages thereof , expect to also have responsibilities/regulations you must live by . 
   your call . 
  ftfy, 
   because the public decided, 
  the public did n't decide anything . 
  it 's the ruling class that did . 
   a person without a license ran you over ? 
  sure , it 's much better when the person ** with ** a license runs you over ... 
  they were n't back then . 
  somehow america not only did n't perish , it even prospered . 
  imagine that !, 
   while you do , in fact , enjoy the benefits of your gov ' t taxing you, 
  what benefits would that be ? 
  hi did n't say `` perfect , '' he said `` comes up tops . '', 
   the government is you . 
  that 's the biggest problem with statists - they would n't . 
   what exactly is wrong with wearing a device, 
  there 's nothing wrong with wearing it . 
  what is wrong is requiring it by law . 
  there 's nothing wrong with refraining from eating unhealthy food - would you be fine with the law fining you for eating at mickey dees ? 
   i never wear my seat belt because it 's a law ,, 
  _ `` first they came after unstrapped and i did n't say nothing because i always strap ... '' _, 
  yeah , yeah , i know ... 
  in the soviet russia government baked bread - clear evidence everybody would starve without soviet government !, 
   you were n't whipped/killed for failing to work, 
  ... but you may get beaten/killed for not respecting someone 's autoritah ... 
  how long is humanity around for ? 
  how long is fda around for ? 
  how come the humanity survived not having fda for all the time !, 
  what about all those poor schmucks who live in a parts of the world without fda ? 
  either you accept , on principle , the government right to force you to do/don ' t do something what might be beneficial/detrimental to you or you do n't . 
  the rest is just bickering over how far can they go ... 
   so you 're completely black and white . 
  that 's the way with principles ... either it 's ok to sexually assault someone or it 's not . 
  there 's no grey area - feeling her up in a crowded subway is not ok either ... 
   if people can decide not to wear seatbelts , they can also decide to not follow any other traffic laws , endangering themselves, 
  _ ai n't nobody 's business if they do _ . 
   more importantly other people . 
  then we are talking a different talk . 
   not wearing a seatbelt endangers other people in the case of an accident . 
  do n't be fucking ridiculous !, 
  the probability of someone being propelled out of vehicle and hurting another are about the same as farting creating a typhoon in malaysia ... 
  how so ? 
   you think the entire government can be fairly represented as `` dudes that rob you blind '' ? 
  they literally serve no function but to take your hard-earned money ? 
  yup . 
  pretty much .
