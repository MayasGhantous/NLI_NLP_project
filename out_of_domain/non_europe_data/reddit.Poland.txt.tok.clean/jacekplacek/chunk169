  sure , they will throw you scraps from time to time , if they feel like it . 
   and every single person in the middle east is just a `` poor schmuck '' who wants to be left alone ? 
  well , not every `` single person . '', 
  still the poor schmucks are being labeled `` enemies '' anyway and sometimes blown to bits with their families/wedding guests ... 
  let 's see : denial ... you have a long way to go , grasshopper . 
  your believing otherwise does n't make it so . 
  prove me wrong . 
  you might benefit from resolving your cognitive dissonance in a rational way ... , 
   what 's most frustrating is trying to figure out what i can do about it . 
  unfortunately , there 's not much we can do . 
  history teaches us the change can not come if the time for it is not ripe ... 
   what contradictory beliefs do you think are causing it ? 
  hard to tell since you seem to keep avoiding making any positive arguments ... that 's why i asked you to do so , then i could point out the contradictions . 
   you 're the one who said i had cognitive dissonance to resolve . 
  sure . 
  believing in a state must either come from cognitive dissonance or from worldview with heavy load of irrational mysticism . 
  i 'm giving you a benefit of the doubt and assuming it 's the former ... , 
   you 're obviously aware of all the government services i 've mentioned . 
  yup . 
  i have already acknowledged they throw us some scraps from time to time . 
  not to mention most of them ( at least the ones there 's a demand for ) could and would be provided by a free market . 
   financial aid for education ,, 
  this is not exactly a `` service , '' as the current problems with the student loans indicate . 
  interesting tidbit : ancient greece 's governments did n't mess with education , still the greeks were mostly well educated and able to sustain very enlightened ( for the times ) culture . 
   basic infrastructure ,, 
  you do n't really believe businesses would not start if the government did n't provide `` basic infrastructure , '' do you . 
   quality assurance ,, 
  funny you mention that : you can be assured the new toaster will not electrocute you not thanks to the government but the private underwriters laboratory . 
   some measure of standardized penalties for actions that harm the community . 
  there 's no such thing as `` action that harm the community . '', 
  actions either harm individuals or they do n't . 
  and why do you think `` standardized penalties '' are a good thing ? 
  the proper thing , anyway , would be for a victim of crime to receive compensation - not the punishment of the perp . 
  i gain nothing from the mugger being thrown into jail , i 'd rather have my money back . 
  but all that does n't really address the actual issue - some side benefits ( if they exist ) can not justify forcible extraction of money from unwilling people . 
  ( if they did you would n't have a cause against mafia - they do indeed make sure ( to a degree ) other criminals leave you alone . 
  people ( again , i 'm leaving behind irrational mystics ) who believe in government 's legitimacy do it on one of two justifications :, 
  1 ) the `` night watchman '' principle . 
  2 ) market `` imperfection . '', 
  but both are fallacies . 
  1 ) is assuming that since there are some people who will do harm to others , we need the government ( which is inevitably composed of people ) to have the power to punish the `` evildoers . '', 
  problem being the smart ones quickly realize the government is the place to be in !, 
  the 2 ) has even bigger problem : there 's really no such thing as the `` objective value . '', 
  all values are subjective , what might seem good/beneficial to you could be seen as evil/detrimental by me . 
  there 's no way this can be reconciled by the country-wide `` unification . '', 
  in a free market this is being reconciled ( hopefully ) in a peaceful way : i do my thing you do yours . 
  when the politicians get involved either you or me will get screwed . 
  ( most likely both of us . 
  you might think you have gained because you got your way but you tend to forget the cost , which you would n't need to bear if you just let me go my way . ), 
  the market works because there 's a built-in feedback - you do something detrimental to you , you feel pain . 
  next time you avoid it . 
  when the politician does something detrimental to you , it 's you who feels the pain not him . 
  he 's got no incentive to change his way . 
  hth, 
  yup . 
  pretty much for the same reason there are so few third party car manufacturers ... 
  uhmm ... u/quick _ check has just asked ** if ** there are any sources ... pay attention . 
  i can see how you could be offended - politics is just an organized crime , after all . 
  i 'm thick skinned and not very easy to take offense . . 
  she is twice stupid - if she just called her mother and told her to pretend she had pain but it 's gone now , she would be free as a bird ... and we would n't have anything to write about , 
  he just have n't read the bill before signing ... , 
  oh , that explains it ... 
  better to be safe than sorry ... , 
  dirty bomb is just a scare - the effects of a `` dirty '' bomb by $ spent are not really worthy your trouble . 
  you 'd be much better off buying more explosives ... 
  just post the fricking requirements ... if it 's interesting i might help . 
  ... and that never happens in the good ole usa ... 
   it 's rampant criminality in both politics and the average day to day, 
  what 's your point ? 
   say what you will but people seem generally to like schools as they are . 
  the people in soviet union did like their government baked bread too ... 
  yup . 
  geez ... judging by the comments , there 's precious few libertarians around here anymore . 
  are you guys at least being paid for shilling ? 
  if not , it 's pretty stupid way of wasting your time - go read a book or something ... 
   if you think most politicians have the average person 's concerns in mind , you 're sadly mistaken . 
  never implied such a thing ... seems to me you have missed a wink . 
  that it does . 
  the ethnicity of the author has nothing to do with it , though . 
   why do n't you defend it, 
  those who get it do n't need explanation , those who do n't will not get it anyway ... 
   there was no threat - so what you said is completely irrelevant . 
  that 's not the point . 
  if there 's no threat you should n't shoot at all , if there 's a threat you shoot to remove it . 
  in no circumstances you shoot `` in the arm , leg . . or even hand . '', 
  period . 
  so , they should ** not ** shoot ... your `` advise '' to shoot `` in the arm , leg . . or even hand '' is simply idiotic . 
  < sigh /  the advise to shoot `` in the arm , leg . . or even hand '' is idiotic - that 's the point . 
  what 's the point ? 
   you might turn me to your `` side '', 
  what makes you think i want you on `` my side ? '', 
  the quote is in plain english , do n't see what 's to explain ... 
  yeah !, 
  we all know how expensive beer is in [ quebec ] ( http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/ontarians-pay-substantially-more-for-beer-than-quebeckers-study-finds/article13756022/ ) ... < s / , 
  more like `` you 're never safe on the wing of the flying plane '' ... 
  it makes perfect sense - his real business is gun-running , he went into politics to ban guns to boost his business ... , 
  free proctological exams ftw !, 
  you forgot to mention wmd 's , madam reno . 
   for a community to have a large collection of weapons and believe that an army was coming to destroy them, 
  obviously , to prove them wrong , we had to send the army and destroy them ...
