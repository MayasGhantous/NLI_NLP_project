  because it 's scaremongering , perhaps ? 
  anything you plug in could potentially `` kill you ! '', 
   the only consequences they will suffer are the ones we the people bring . 
  iow : none ? 
  hope you are right ... we have seen none after waco and ruby ridge , why do you believe it 'll be different this time ? 
  i will upvote whatever i damn please ... , 
  hope you are right . 
   no bill of attainder or _ ex post facto _ law shall be passed . 
  _ [ us constitution , artcle i , section 9 ] _, 
  oh , wait ... forgot it does n't apply anymore ... 
  ... but it was covered by the statute of limitation . 
  hence _ ex post facto _ . 
   the aggressive effort to collect old debts started three years ago -- the result of a single sentence tucked into the farm bill lifting the 10-year statute of limitations on old debts to uncle sam . 
  rtfa !, 
  change that to `` buying a shitload of cheap stuff from china i might eventually find use for '' and it will be me  and , yes , i 'm finding use for stuff i bought before ( and stuff i salvaged from old gizmos . ), 
  my best buy so far is 100 shift registers for pennies apiece ... 
  you can try something like :, 
  bool test = true ;, 
  while ( true ), 
  if ( test ), 
  { / / do one thing, 
  else, 
  { / / do the other one, 
  test = ! test ;, 
  assuming the `` things '' take about the same time . 
  you could also try to dive into ( timer ) interrupts . 
  i have bought some things from them - no problems so far ( other than `` slow boat from china '' issue  also if you spend more than $ 35 ( ? ), 
  they ship it a little faster , still not a second day , though ... , 
  would n't a simple transistor driving the gate be enough ? 
  ( also a newbie ... ), 
   in this case it 's not his property, 
  since his family was grazing this land since before nevada was even a state , it might be his by the virtue of [ adverse possession ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adverse_possession ) anyway ... 
  you misunderstood the dude . 
  he was just announcing his post . 
  it seems the delay ( ) is what 's killing you . 
  when you call delay ( ) nothing else it happening ... 
   because it belongs to all of us , not just him, 
  he did n't take the land - just grazing his cows like cattlemen always did . 
  he did n't `` steal '' it anymore as you would steal it if you went camping there ... 
  so , you want a referendum ? 
  would you also want a referendum if you were to go camping there ? 
  i think op means [ half h-bridge ] ( https://www.sparkfun.com/products/315 ) . 
   corporate management, 
  to a much lesser degree . 
  the `` subjects '' can always say `` screw you '' and quit ... 
  too many donuts ... 
  assuming you are using a micro-controller of some kind , anything when you run out of pins ... 
  take a look at [ arduino blog ] ( http://blog.arduino.cc/ ) , you may find some ideas . 
   theres always going to be that one person who isnt peaceful, 
  ... and he ** will ** find his way into government ... 
   an uncontained but still controlled ( directed ) type of fusion seems even more speculative . 
  why ? 
  you just need to inject the ( ionized ) fuel into the fusion chamber , squeeze it with electromagnets to the desired pressure and light it up with a laser . 
  we have that part pretty much licked - the containment is the real remaining issue ... which we do n't need in the fusion drive . 
   but once you understand the rocket equation it 's all downhill and depressing because you realise how limited that technology actually is . 
  tsiolkovsky equation does n't take relativity into account , do n't know if anyone tried to correct it for the relativistic `` realm . '', 
  btw you might remember [ project orion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/project_orion_\\ ( nuclear_propulsion \\ ) ) - it would be kinda similar in principle , with fusion instead of fission and with the `` nano-nukes '' instead of the big ones . 
  i believe we do n't have the fusion drive yet only because nobody is working on it . 
  edit : fixed link . 
  well , you kinda need context , do n't you . 
  is somalia without the government a better place than it was with the government ? 
  are the neighboring countries with government ( sudan , anyone ) better places than somalia ? 
  when somalia got rid of their government the things in there improved considerably . 
  similar outcome could be expected from other countries ... including us . 
   imagine having to negotiate with individual property owners to _ [ blah , blah , blah ... ] _, 
  ... or you could simply lease existing ducts from pepco and be done with it ... ( you know , kinda like what verizon and comcast are doing . ), 
  you have just discovered why we can not buy cereal other than ( company x ) from our local grocery store !, 
  why would it work for isps and not for kellogs ? 
  why does n't it work for verizon or att ? 
  they are leasing ducts from the same pepco , after all ... 
  do n't forget [ newegg ] ( http://www.newegg.com/electronic-components/category/id-342 ) ... 
   just write in your own strncmp ( ), 
  why ? 
  why not ? 
  if you follow spainguy 's advise , you might consider looking at [ this book ] ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b00i2yhm2k/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title ) - it 's covering atmel mcu 's without arduino ide ( which , quite frankly , sucks ... ), 
  because it 's easier than hanging `` downside up ? '', 
   property rights are not a voluntary arrangement, 
  of course they are . 
  say , i believe in property rights and claim some gizmo as my property . 
  you do n't believe in property rights but you can not claim the same gizmo as your property ( iow take it from me ) without acknowledging ** the concept ** of property rights . 
  or to rephrase it : either i have a right to my property ( and you can not `` voluntarily '' take it from me ) or you can not have the right to it ( and no right to take it from me . ), 
  in what sense ? 
  do n't get it . 
  what justice has to do with it ? 
  the way i see it it 's simple voluntary arrangement between consenting parties . 
  i 've been boycotting all things verizon since they screwed me over several years ago . 
  i used to have a verizon mobile plan , including free canada roaming . 
  one day some broad called me from verizon and said i can upgrade my plan for more minutes at no cost . 
  i did n't really need more minutes so i declined , but she insisted i have nothing to lose , so why not . 
  i have specifically asked her if my canada plan is going to stay the same - she said yes . 
  so , i said ok . 
  the next bill was about twice the normal one , you guessed - lot 's of roaming charges from canada . 
  i tried to set that straight with them and they said the `` new '' plan does n't have canada roaming and they no longer offer the old plan . 
  the dude i was talking to said there 's nothing i can do about it . 
  i was already out of the contract ( or so i thought ) i decided to switch to att . 
  verizon charged me $ 300 for breaking the contract !, 
  wtf , i thought !, 
  apparently , the `` new , great , no cost for me deal '' had a fine print ( not disclosed by the broad who tricked me into it ) - extension of the contract for one more year . 
  guess i probably should have got myself a lawyer and sue the bastards , but in the end i decided to just swallow the cost . 
  obviously , verizon will never be able to sell me anything ...
