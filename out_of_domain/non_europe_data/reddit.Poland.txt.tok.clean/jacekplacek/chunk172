  so , i assume you believe you should kill the single dude . 
  what if you learned afterwards the dude was a scientist on the verge of finding a cure for cancer and the five dudes were gang of serial killers ? 
  btw from the utilitarian point of view slavery was quite ok - small minority of slaves were supporting the majority of slaveholding societies ... 
  maybe not a `` small '' minority but still [ a minority ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavery_in_the_united_states#distribution ) ... 
  obviously , you are missing the point : you have no moral authority to decide . 
  put your hypothetical in a slightly different terms : there is a killer holding five hostages and threatening to kill them . 
  but he offers you a deal - you kill one of them and he lets the rest live . 
  will you pull the trigger ? 
  now you are willing to kill on the basis of statistics ? 
  of what happening ? 
  one of them being a scientist or one of them being a serial killer ? 
  ca n't do - he has a bomb strapped to the hostages and holds a `` dead man switch '' ... 
  by killing the one dude ? 
  so what do you say to the slightly different but essentially identical on principle [ scenario ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/politicalhumor/comments/24178p/welcome_aboard/ch2tqia ) ? 
   provided there is no other solution ( as there is n't with the train example ), 
  there 's always some `` other '' solution . 
  in the op 's hypothetical , you can always try to warn the people by yelling , ferinstance ... 
  which slightly alters the probabilities of the outcome - better chance one of the five hears you and alerts the others than the sole dude hearing you . 
  heck , even if they do n't hear you , one of them could still hear the train ... 
  sure , just your `` method of reasoning '' is not quite the `` proper '' one ... 
   this is five times more likely for the other track . 
  you have absolutely no basis for that conclusion - you do n't know , for example , how much likely/unlikely scientists are to walk alone vs in the group . 
  are you sure they are not 5 times more likely to be alone ? 
  another factor you are missing is the likelihood the victim ( s ) will hear/spot the train ( or hear you yelling ) and react fast enough to avoid being killed . 
  quite obviously , the group of 5 has a better chance of one of them spotting the danger than the sole dude . 
  so , add those factors to your equation and try to get a meaningful result ... 
   basic probability lesson, 
  maybe you should have gone a little bit further than `` the basics '' before applying your arithmetic to human lives ... 
  thinking the simple equation ( 1 < 5 ) gives you the moral right to decide who dies is not ? 
   the degree of competition , role of intervention and regulation , and scope of public ownership varies across different models of capitalism . 
  iow , what we have here is still capitalism , so were fascist systems . 
  that 's what the marxists ( and other left-nuts ) point out . 
   i 'm open to actual discussion about this topic, 
  no , you are not . 
  you believe you have everything in the world figured out already . 
  funny how getting a glimpse of probability calculus in high school makes you think you are an expert on ethics . 
  btw being called an `` idiot '' by a simpleton is a badge of honor . 
   um , this is n't an evaluation, 
  yes it is , it evaluates the whole expression ( including [ comma operator ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comma_operator ) ) and returns 0 ... 
  do n't feed the trolls . 
  ... and still they have less government regulations than `` capitalist '' usa ... 
  so was a car a 100 years ago ... 
  funny how you refuse to commit yourself to shooting the innocent dude in my alternative scenario . 
  by not shooting him the blood of others is on your hands !, 
  have n't committed yourself before ... ok , let 's do another scenario : not a train but a runaway wagon , there 're 5 people on the track , no switch but there is a fat dude standing close to you . 
  if you push the dude he will be killed but will block the wagon before it reaches the 5 dudes . 
  do you push ? 
  thought that meant execs get a lot of $ s. . . , 
  anytime you set/clear the pin you create an emp , although pretty tiny one . 
  for the big one you need a big device ... 
   i urgently want to speak to the man pictured , as i believe he will be able to greatly assist the investigation, 
  yeah . 
  right . 
   they were belligerent and disrespectful, 
  contempt of cop !, 
  obviously the only possible punishment for this heinous crime is death . 
   i would have shot her ass too, 
  we know , ossifer , you would . 
  she clearly dissed him , all gangstas are very sensitive to dissing ... 
   violent people will still be violent , now every confrontation has the potential to turn into a gun fight, 
  guess that 's why we see all the shootouts every time in vermont !, 
  oh , you mean if reality does n't conform to your superstitions , too bad for reality ... ? 
   girl sees that , does n't stop , probably because she is drunk, 
  or perhaps she 's seen to many videos of cops killing/brutalizing innocent people and was simply afraid ... ? 
   investigation, 
  < snort /  yeah , his buddies gon na `` investigate '' allright . 
  wan na bet what the outcome of the `` investigatin ' '' will be ? 
   i 'm confused, 
  yes , i can see that . 
  my example of vermont where there were never any gun control laws and yes , anyone ( not federally prohibited ) can carry their gun concealed or openly , was to point out the sheer absurdity of your assertion that `` every confrontation will turn into a gunfight . '', 
  vermont is one of the states with very low crime overall and homicides in particular ... 
  what ? 
  did n't you know some animals are more equal ? 
  why not ? 
  it is funny how the young left-wingers have no idea about either jesus or the conservative ideology , yet feel compelled to post `` humorous '' ( in their minds ) pictures commenting on both ... 
  sorry , but it really does sound to me like : `` all through the spring and summer [ of 1938 ] , indeed almost to the end , [ british ] prime minister chamberlain and [ french ] premier daladier apparently sincerely believed , along with most of the rest of the world , that all hitler wanted was justice for his kinsfolk in czechoslovakia . '', 
  _ [ william l. shirer ] _, 
  for those who `` do n't want to die for crimea '' - remember that your predecesors , who did n't want to die for danzig , had to die later on when nazis become much more powerfull ... 
   the forceful hand of government creates markets by enforcing property law and contract law, 
  it 's hilarious how statists delude themselves into believing an obvious bullshit ... 
  say , i 've been buying lots of electronic components straight from chinese sellers for quite a while now ( clearly a market in action . ), 
  which government does the `` enforcin ' '' for me ? 
  why not ? 
   an unwanted fetus violating them can be stopped if it is desired, 
  do you also feel the guest on your yacht can be dumped in the middle of the ocean if you no longer desire his company ? 
  perhaps because they are not human ? 
  any form of statism has to involve a lot of irrational misticism . 
  it used to be `` divine rights of the kings '' or '' _ vox populi , vox dei _ , '' now it 's ( closely related to the second ) belief that somehow the very act of voting bestows on the elected some kind of wisdom/good will/honesty ... 
  dunno ... why do you call it `` human rights ? '', 
  ... but not to ants ... 
  you tell me ... if we were to extend them to ants they would n't be `` human rights '' anymore , would they . 
  sure , but `` liberal christians '' would n't be making such posts ... 
   the question in dispute is if a mass of cells has self-ownership like a fully grown , healthy adult human being does . 
  ownership , self or otherwise , has nothing to do with the question . 
  the question of human rights , though , has to be answered at some point . 
  you assert the `` fully grown , healthy adult human being '' has rights but the fetus does not . 
  so at what point the `` mass of cells '' acquire rights ? 
  does the 1 day old baby have them ? 
   is that just because someone wanted it to look like that ? 
  it 's the system that evolved in somalia long before the first white dude set a foot there ...
