  the ability does n't change . 
  the information they have does ... 
  when you buy something you have pretty good idea what the thing is and what to expect from it . 
  when you vote you only know the dude you vote for ( no matter who your vote for ) is most likely a power-hungry psychopath . 
  you are just trying to decide which one will cause you less harm ... 
   i 've been boycotting walmart and mcdonalds for all my life , you think it has made a damn bit of difference ? 
  it has for you . 
  who you voted for `` your whole life '' has not . 
   there was no implicit contract, 
  yes there was . 
  when you have ( unprotected ) sex , you know the outcome could be pregnancy . 
  but let 's assume you are right . 
  do you have a right to dump a stowaway in the middle of the ocean ? 
   as of yet anarchist society has not produced the same results as the state, 
  you are absolutely right !, 
  the anarchist societies would have never achieved around [ 170 million murdered ] ( http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/note1.htm ) in xxth century alone !, 
  it takes the state to accomplish that . 
   the shadow of protection sits behind every transaction, 
  that so ? 
  i 've been buying electronic components stright from chinese or other asian sellers for quite a while now . 
  whose `` shadow of protection '' sits behind my transactions ? 
   those with power came to dominate those without power . 
  as such - another solution came to arise : a powerful state that could defend its individuals against those with power . 
  actually , `` those with power '' realized the easiest way to fleece those without power is through the state and indoctrinating the masses . 
  the indoctrination started with the `` divine rights of the kings '' and , when the masses started to question that , it changed to `` you have the vote so you are the government . '', 
  so far masses are buying that . 
  what will happen when they stop ? 
  who knows ... 
  there was a book i read a long time ago in which the ( unnamed ) country went through several military _ coup d'\u00e9tat_s : starting with the putsch of generals , then colonels , etc. 
  and ending with the putsch of corporals . 
  every new `` leader '' had a speech at the success of the coup , with the decreasing degree of sophistication . 
  the corporals ' leader only said : `` ughh ... 
  motherfuckers ! '', 
   the reality is that you are controlling yourself in order to gain a greater personal benefit, 
  i guess if i stop paying taxes to myself i will throw myself into jail !, 
  lol , you just showing me our massah generously allowing us to get cheap stuff from china , not offering any protection . 
  do you really believe if i buy 100 mosfet 's from wang lee in shanghai and he sends me 100 resistors the almighty state is gon na intervene ? 
  what rules , little girl ? 
  and what recourse would i have if he sent me 100 resistors ? 
  do you really believe he gives a fuck about some stupid us rules ? 
   would you dump the stowaway ? 
  no i would n't but i would n't kill the fetus either ... 
  so , how is a stowaway different from a fetus ? 
  rummel specifically ** excludes ** warfare deaths from his statistics and all you have to show is some flunky speculating on warfare deaths in primitive societies . 
  so , even by your dude 's estimates - 25 % of warfare deaths versus 10 % of warfare deaths + twice that much of democide deaths ... the state still `` wins ! '', 
   your criticisms do nothing for me, 
  i know , religious beliefs are hard to argue with ... 
   maybe because they help more people than they hurt . 
  i think the real problem is over-prescribing . 
  when the drug which can cause psychotic episodes is routinely given to kids for the sake of making it easier to deal with by teachers/parents , it 's inevitable some of those episodes will happen and some of them will lead to the mass killings ... 
  i 'm really sorry to hurt your feelings so badly . 
  me bad , should have know not to argue with a religious zealot ... 
  i think [ this one ] ( http://montego.roughwheelers.com/gun_cam.html ) might be defective ... 
  nah , it 's gon na be evil us sanctions ... 
  reminds me of the old definition of socialism : `` equal distribution of poverty . '', 
   also the limiting of trade . 
  that would be very hard to argue since the ( afaik ) only county that 's limiting the trade with cuba is us ... 
   new is not part of standard c++, 
  of course it is , as your link demonstrates . 
   an accelerometer will draw power at all times, 
  [ this ] ( https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10953 ) seems to draw only about 6 ua when not moving ... 
   i highly doubt the truck driver could see the motorcycle . 
  the tuck driver was signalling . 
  looks to me the truck driver had really no reason to pull to the shoulder and did it on purpose `` to teach a lesson '' to the scooter driver . 
  does n't mean the scooter driver was n't an idiot ... 
   because they care what happens to him . 
  they `` care what happens to him '' and they decided to ruin his life over a little mj ... ?!!, 
  c++ standard defines both c++ language and the standard libraries ... 
  no , i do n't believe it 's ok to kill anybody who is not willful and immediate danger to your or someone else 's life ... 
  google `` lithium ion battery charging '' and you will know why what you are doing will not work and can potentially damage both your phone and your arduino ... 
   i do not pay sales tax on my rent, 
  sure . 
  but your landlord is paying his income tax , property tax and sales tax on all the stuff he needs to buy to maintain the property . 
  do you think he might , just might be tempted to factor those taxes into your rent ? 
  you are right . 
  somehow misread the op ... need more coffee . 
  stalin would be proud . 
  last time i checked it was a liberal party not an abortion party . 
  i thought the term `` liberal '' was kinda suggesting acceptance of some level of difference of opinions ... silly me . 
  guess i 'm too old and cling to outdated notions of what `` liberal '' means . 
  you mean `` liberal '' was always synonymous with `` authoritarian ? '', 
  it has nothing to do with a conspiracy - it 's the bandwagon a lot of below-mediocre `` scientists '' jumped on because they still understand which side their bread is buttered on ... 
  politicians jump on it for the obvious reason - pretext to give them more power and more income from taxes . 
   direct admonishments against alcohol, 
  citation ? 
   then why is it that lung cancer is overwhelmingly caused by smoking ? 
  it 's `` attributed to '' smoking ... which basically means the author has no clue and just presents his/her wild-ass guess ... 
  after someone gets the cancer there 's no way to figure out what was the cause . 
  the `` attribution '' is usually based on `` were you a smoker?that caused it : something else caused it ; '', 
  bet you i 'm not the only one ... , 
  bullies are not really suicidal types ... 
  a3 is seeing a voltage in relation to the ground . 
  with all buttons open it 's working as a divider between internal resistance of the mc ( negligible ) and r5 . 
  i do n't know where the `` good cop '' myth came from . 
  notice that whenever the `` few bad apples '' do something wrong , all the `` good cops '' do everything in their power to cover for them . 
  and if by any chance there 's a really good cop that reports the misbehavior , he/she ends up fired or shunned ... 
  so , where are the `` good cops '' hiding ? 
  not sure what you mean . 
  if you are not encoding your text somehow ( as it looks like from your example ) then your `` binary '' is already an ascii character . 
  just print it out if the variable type is ** char ** , if not cast it to ** char ** ...
