   most communist states say they have excellent healthcare, 
  ftfy, 
  splc , lol !, 
  bunch of examples of different crimes ( bank robberies are terrorism now ? ), 
  or even bullshit `` crimes '' ( possession of the fertilizer ) without much in common other than the perps were either christian or neo-nazis or simply did n't like morris dees ... 
  fyi : fascists/nazis are left wingers ... look up nsdap program and you might find out you agree with most of it ( presumably excluding any racist/nationalist bullshit ), 
  average [ monthly income in vietnam ] ( http://thanhniennews.com/business/vietnam-average-monthly-wage-rises-to-185-8544.html ) is us$ 185 , [ in us ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/personal_income_in_the_united_states ) close to us$ 3000 . 
  that might have something to do with the price difference ... 
  [dictionary.com ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/fascism ) : nothing about `` right-wing '' , [ merriam-webster ? 
  ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fascism ) nope , neither there . 
  ] ( http://www.britannica.com/ebchecked/topic/202210/fascism ) closest they get to it is a mention of dolfuss being supported by a right-wing organisation ... 
  so , it appears , you have neglected to follow your own recommendation and check the dictionary . 
  oh , i 'm pretty sure if you google long enough , you will find a definition calling it whatever you want ... go to the source , do n't be afraid to read their own words . 
  also do n't be afraid to find about their actual policies . 
  and your point being ? 
   { support police state usa }, 
  while i know what they mean , it 's kinda unfortunate phrasing ... 
   i 'm not pleased with the liberals not agreeing to raising speed limits, 
  c'mon , they raise too much money with current speed limits to consider that ... 
  no , we just do n't mix verbs and nouns ... `` g\u00f3wno '' is a noun , `` sram '' is a ( first person , present tense ) verb . 
  `` osram '' - the same verb in a future tense , with ( i lack the grammar term for this ) indication i will do it all over something ... 
   why they need to switch at 4khz, 
  if you want to bit-bang them for 16 levels of brightness and want a 120hz refresh rate that 's already around 2khz ... 
  it 's funny how he is not afraid of certified bullies ( pigs ) openly carrying but trembles at the thought of us peasants doing so . 
  elitism in its full glory !, 
  because they are all conditioned to obey their massahs , they feel anybody who does n't anticipate massahs ' wishes and does everything to follow them is an uppity slave ... , 
  somehow most people accept that some animals are more equal . 
  basically , treat them as you would an armed mugger , hopped up on meth ... 
  good puppy !, 
  you respond well to your training . 
  now roll-over !, 
  btw why all hoplophobes have such an unhealthy obsession with penises ? 
  did it have any impact on you ? 
  seems y' all are just jealous he got laid ... 
   a man with a knife can kill , but not as easily as a man with an assault weapon firing an insane amount of bullets per minute . 
  a man with a few gallons of gasoline can kill many more people faster than a man with an `` assault weapon '' ( whatever that means . ), 
   assault rifles, 
  afraid it does n't mean what you think it means ... 
  r/toronto : all rob ford all the time !, 
  you do ? 
  so , what is an `` assault weapon '' other than `` scary looking rifle ? '', 
   it 's pretty obvious that he means a weapon created for the sole purpose of wounding and/or killing people as effectively as possible . 
  you mean a nuke ? 
  you guys are funny with your `` assault weapons . '', 
  if you read your own link the term pretty much encompasses some cosmetic features that make a rifle `` scary looking . '', 
  i would rather face the dude with a `` tacti-cool , assault mall ninja weapon '' than another one with a deer rifle . 
   i 'd rather flee a burning building, 
  your choice , but the people burned to death in [ happy land fire ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/happy_land_fire ) or [ waco ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/waco_siege ) might have a different view ... 
  does n't look like any deranged shooter could kill as many . 
  mine have to be defective , then . 
  never managed to kill anybody/anything , other than countless paper targets . 
  every state is, 
  the enclosures alone are priceless ( for anyone with a little imagination . ), 
  ... and gay people should stay in the closets ... amiright ? 
  it 's interesting how obsessed bloombergites are with penises ... 
   too many holes in the wrong places ... 
  that 's why i 've mentioned imagination ... , 
  should have known you are too dumb to get it ... 
  he looks more steam-punk than metal ... 
  how is that derogatory to either homeless or muslims ? 
  you ever heard of humor ? 
  yeah , we all know all cops are outstanding public servants and would never , ever abuse their powers . 
  and if one happens to fuck you up your ass you must have deserved it !, 
   the assholes in washington do n't have a blank check , since their jobs require listening to what the people desire, 
  nobody wants to ban a government - you want to have one , go for it . 
  just do n't impose it on the rest of us ... 
  they might not be `` anti-state '' all the way through , they still are pro ( relatively ) free markets ... 
  ... point that was already addressed in tfa ... 
  i 've heard it 's a favorite retirement place for spooks and other unsavory characters ... 
   i 'm sure most of you are aware that in canada , we have to take a gun safety course , followed by submitting a thorough application to the rcmp before we can buy or possess firearms or ammo . 
  sucking the dick of the mountie in charge helps too ... 
  btw , you do understand your legally registered gun may one day end up on the `` prohibited '' list , just by a whim of some assholes in ottawa , and you will have to give it up ? 
   sucking dick of the top mountie ? 
  what ? 
  not the top mountie . 
  the one in charge of your permit - if you make him happy he will be less likely to refuse ... 
  judging by photo , they might not have seen action for some time . 
  no wonder they demand it , 
  if you do n't mind waiting you might look at some stuff from china . 
  [ neweeg ] ( http://www.newegg.com/electronic-components/category/id-342 ) has some components ( shipped from china , very often free shipping , ) you can look into aliexpress.com or banggood.com ( yup , that 's the real name , 
  that 's the point of tfa ... 
   this would be one of the ways of starting a more independent , voluntaryist , free society , by subverting this statist one . 
  ... which is the main reason the state will never agree to it ... 
   as long as you 're not harming anyone else, 
  hate to break it to you but an abortion is harming someone else ... 
  to be fair , we have at least ** some ** common grounds with the ( genuine ) conservatives . 
  not so much with liberals - they tend to be anti-war ... unless their guy does the warring . 
  they tend to be pro free speech ... unless the speech is something they disapprove of . 
  etc , etc. 
   if you think libertarians are pro-war, 
  methinks you should work on your reading comprehension skills ... 
  [ same comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/libertarian/comments/28d4zd/just_a_reminder_this_is_rlibertarian_not/ci9zbv5 ), 
  did i say anything about the state ? 
  i said `` conservatives '' and qualified it with `` genuine . '', 
  and yes , ** genuine ** conservatives have the economic freedom in common with libertarians . 
  i never said they ** were ** libertarians . 
   equal treatment for everyone , elimination of drug prohibition , removal of corporate cronyism to name 3 really quickly . 
  hmm ... let me see ... how is affirmative action an `` equal treatment for everyone ? '', 
  why when they are in charge the drug war continues or even expands ? 
  how come their favorite corporations get the red carpet treatment and bailout money ?
