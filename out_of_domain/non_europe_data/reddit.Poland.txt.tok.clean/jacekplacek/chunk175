  why the goldman saks have the near monopoly of filling up slots in their administration ? 
  obviously , the war and free speech are not the things they have in common with us ... they tend to be fiscally conservative and do n't like too much economic regulation , though . 
  did i say anything about stopping anyone ? 
  dunno ... when democrats are in power you can hardly see any `` genuine liberals '' protesting against the war or the ( legislative ) 4th ( or any other ) amendment violations . 
  when republicans were in power there were still plenty of conservatives protesting their policies . 
  you really need to work on your reading comprehension skills . 
  certainly the conservatives were n't protesting dubya on war , there was plenty of conservative dissent on `` drugs for gizzers '' or bailouts ferinstance , though . 
   there sure as hell was n't any pushback on deficit spending though . 
  [ does n't really ] ( https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/110-2007/s354 ) look like it was as unanimous as you suggest ... 
  there was a lot of conservative opposition to dubya 's bailouts ... 
  edit : [ link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emergency_economic_stabilization_act_of_2008#first_house_vote.2c_september_29 ) . 
  actually it would n't pass if not for democratic support . 
   we 're talking about regular left, 
  left on metamucil ? 
  first of all , the original quote goes `` reality has a liberal bias , '' second - try to go unprepared into wilderness and wait for reality 's safety net ... , 
  you really need to work on your reading comprehension skills . 
  < sigh /  you seem to be totally oblivious to what is being argued and by whom ... 
  robbing peter to pay paul is not charity . 
  you seem to confuse jesus with robin hood ... 
  two wrongs do n't make right . 
  you want me to cite the verse when jesus did n't advocate for government welfare ? 
  how about all of them . 
  or pick anyone at random ... 
  while there 's certain degree of ambiguity in the statement , the most credible parsing would be : christ said ( to do private charity , ) not ( to depend on the government for your welfare . ), 
  iow you are wrong . 
  why age limit ? 
  i 'm 58 and i do n't ... 
  for some strange reason all gangstas are very sensitive to any perceived disrespect ... 
   the us right to keep and bear arms, 
  ... is a straightforward corollary of the right to life ... 
   it has absolutely nothing to do with the topic at hand, 
  why did you mention it then ... ? 
   they 'll revise history and claim anyone is right as long as they dont have to concede that they were wrong, 
  did n't beck specifically admit he was wrong ? 
  bad example , then . 
  it is a natural right . 
  nope . 
  look at it this way - if he ( a russian citizen ) was stuck in canada without canadian passport , he could still leave for russia without any problems ( assuming he did have a russian passport . ), 
  hmm ... so , despite of what / u/kettal [ thinks ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/29e2ay/whats_up_with_some_perpetually_dormant/cik1tb4 ) , they are quite the opposite of ` greedy ' ... , 
  he 's got friends in the right places . 
  you scratch his back ( by paying him , ) he will tell his friends to scratch yours ( by giving you tax exemption or screwing over your competitor , ferinstance . ), 
   then somebody will take your place . 
  why would they ? 
  that 's not a reason to rat on someone . 
  destroying somebody 's life because `` you do n't like drugs ? '', 
   rat on someone ? 
  this is the real world , not middle school . 
  if someone hides runaway slave in my barn , i 'm going to report it . 
  i 'm not going to be liable for that shit . 
  throwing him out of the barn leaves some possible liability . 
  the only smart thing to do is to report it . 
  i 'm not taking a chance on having my own life ruined because some idiot was stupid enough to hide a runaway slave in my barn . 
  ftfy, 
  when he gets criminal record he will not be able to find even that kind of job . 
  and forget about ever making any kind of career ( other than drug dealing . ), 
  nope . 
  i have equated putting someone in chains because of mj to putting someone in chains because of his status as a slave ... 
   shoot through the door . 
  no mr. vice president . 
  that 's definitely ** not ** the way to proceed ... 
  for the same reason you can plug crucial or kingston or any other manufacturer 's ram into your motherboard . 
  to all the elmer fudds out there : nobody ever got their rights preserved by staying in the closet ... 
  elmer fudds are usually cop-suckers too ... , 
   the only reason interracial couples hold hands in public is to scare people and fuck with police . 
  ftfy, 
   culture and custom being the primary reasons, 
  ... and to change `` the culture and custom '' you have to get proactive . 
  hiding in the closet never advanced anybody 's rights . 
  yes . 
  and we have to get proactive to change them . 
  otherwise those `` cultures and customs '' are going to infringe ... 
   sincerely ,, 
  ftfy, 
  yes , i am . 
  the rest of us figured out already the whole shebang is rigged ... 
  `` if voting could change anything it would be illegal . '', 
   the tea party organized and got their members elected and it absolutely changed the dynamic in the house . 
  changed how ? 
  how is the new congress any different than the old one ? 
  it 's a very curious metric `` how productive is congress . '', 
  in theory , each legislative action should take us closer to the `` perfect '' set of laws . 
  that means each consecutive congress should have less and less to do !, 
  you do n't judge your doctor on how many procedures ( s ) he submits you to , you judge them on how healthy you are . 
  what 's the point ? 
  dunno ... there are schematics [ out there ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operational_amplifier#internal_circuitry_of_741-type_op-amp ) that will show you `` what 's inside . '', 
  very poor learning tool . 
  the appeal of opamps is that they are cheap , small , ubiquitous and versatile . 
  this thing is not any of those . 
  for someone who is a beginner , this is too complex - they would be better off starting with much smaller/simpler projects . 
  for someone who is advanced enough to understand opamp , the real one used in a bigger project would be much better idea . 
  almost all opamp applications only use a fraction of opamp circuit - that 's ok since opamps are cheap . 
  stuffing all those discrete components into a project is just wasteful and counterproductive . 
  ok . that 's a valid point . 
   `` i testify that there is no goddess except gaia ; one is she , no partner has she , and i testify that algor is her servant and messenger . '', 
  i have always thought the ` plateau ' is ... you know ... flat ? 
  the flip side : 20 year old works 60 hours week to finish the projects and learns from his own mistakes as ( s ) he goes . 
  ; 50 year old takes the day off for a prostate check , still finishes the project in three days and on friday is fixing the mess 20 year old made of the previous one . 
  he already did learn from his mistakes long time ago . 
   i know in pennsylvania we have laws, 
  there are also laws against mj - will you snitch on a kid smoking a joint ?
