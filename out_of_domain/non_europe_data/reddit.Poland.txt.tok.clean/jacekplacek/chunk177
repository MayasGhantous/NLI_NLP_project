  if you write someone who is on the other side , it will have no impact either ... , 
  why ? 
  because you saving four kids by killing only one . 
  iow you are maximizing the benefits ( 1 life exchanged for 4 . ), 
  how else would you measure it ? 
  assuming there 's nothing distinguishing one kid from the other . 
  you mean non-religious kids never get kidnapped ? 
  but those are the problems with utilitarianism itself . 
  how do you measure the `` utility ? '', 
  i could go on , alleviating your concerns by giving you an orphan and saying the doctors/hospital would n't do the killing themselves ( perhaps they could even be spared the very knowledge of the killing , ) and it would n't be doctors picking the `` donor , '' so the people would n't need to be afraid to seek treatments ... but that would n't really contribute much do the issue , would it . 
   i deem the threat of this cost being imposed onto me higher than the benefit of saving these four random people, 
  but if the majority thinks otherways , the kid is as good as dead . 
   i personally think this is quite different from the organ donor hypothetically . 
  how so ? 
  in either scenario you have a choice to act and save the lives of four but sacrifice one ; or not act and let the four die . 
  it 's like zen , dude . 
  you need to ponder it , and then ponder it again , and again ... , 
   correct . 
  but they do n't . 
  how do you know ? 
  `` we are not doing that at this time '' is not an answer - we might not be doing it because we just deem such an action horrible , not because of some utilitarian calculation . 
   why else would we be against it ? 
  perhaps because we are wired that way ... 
  most people find killing someone who does n't `` need killin ' '' repulsive . 
  this kinda extends to most of the animal species - they tend to not to kill their own , without even having the ability to do any utilitarian calculation . 
   you guys really agree with the republicans so vote for them . 
  you confuse me . 
  we agree with repubs on some things , we agree with dems on others ... ferinstance , there are still some of dems who are against thew war ( although they seem to be pretty quiet nowadays . ), 
  so , who the hell we are supposed to vote for ? 
  so what . 
  paper ( or web , in that case ) is patient . 
  they can write whatever they want , does n't mean you have to portrait it as what the libertarians think/should do . 
  * principal !, 
   for the record nobody in the class murdered anyone or turned out to be a horrible person, 
  you can not really say that . 
  all those kids could have turned out to be serial killers ... who never got caught !, 
  context ? 
   if i 'm wrong and require an additional qualifier ( i 've seen something like prg_memory used before ) please let me know ) . 
  afraid , you do . 
  the macro is actually progmem and you access the memory by calling pgm_read_byte ( for the character strings . ), 
  you have to read one byte at the time and make sure you check for the terminating null . 
  the simplest way to solve your initialization problem is to just store the text ( s ) in a progmem instead of arrays of objects . 
  your menuenties would just read the menu text as needed . 
   companies like browning and remington who have been around for a 100 years and employ leagues of brilliant engineers and safety experts are more qualified than these hicks working in a garage . 
  hmm ... 
  the most successful gun ever ( ak47 ) was designed by a hick who did n't even have a garage ... 
  john macdonald and winston churchill were drunks too ... 
  started as a hick . 
  and never went to college . 
  better re-read that wikipedia entry ... 
  there was no crack nor crack dealers in their times ... , 
  get something that is rare/obsolete . 
  like midi connectors/cables ( if you do n't do any midi yourself , ) or even plain old telephone plugs ... 
  it really is too easy for someone ( or even you before you get your morning coffee ) to plug usb into your device and do a damage . 
  if you do n't mind getting your hands dirty soldering ( surface mounted , but i guess you could get similar one in dip , ) you could try [ spi flash chip ] ( http://www.newark.com/microchip/sst25vf010a-33-4c-sae/ic-flash-memory-1mbit-12ns-soic/dp/92r4532?mckv=sa7dsvzwb | pcrid | 41566056141 | plid | & cmp = knc-gpla ), 
   i use an attiny85 they are like 4 $ us . 
  you can get them from [ mouser ] ( http://www.mouser.com/productdetail/atmel/attiny85-20pu/?qs=8jwqyweyg6nciiaob5gi9q%3d%3d&amp;gclid=cjwkeajwyycgbrcmmbwl5bev_rqsjabesqhaqhj9abqj54oxommgjxpefapvja2l0m4jwwraamqixroczgdw_wcb ) or [ newark ] ( http://www.newark.com/atmel/attiny85-20pu/mcu-8bit-attiny-20mhz-dip-8/dp/68t3808?mckv=smxohxtdd | pcrid | 41566056141 | plid | & cmp = knc-gpla ) for $ 1.32 ... 
  i have seen them from chinese sellers for under a buck as well . 
  wonder if they ( the government ) are planning something or is it just `` the show of concern , moreover , seemed intended to bolster the government 's case for contentious new legislation to control terrorism suspects '' as the article says ... 
  iow , some people ( americans ) allowed their government to screw them good , therefore ** everybody ** should get screwed ... ? 
   what happens if climate change is real, 
  of course is real . 
  the only stable thing about the climate is it 's change . 
  it has been changing since the beginning of earth . 
  and it will continue to do so till the end of the solar system . 
  how is any society supposed to `` address '' that ? 
  and why ? 
   the subtext is anthropomorphic . 
  methinks you got your words wrong . 
  did you mean `` anthropogenic '' by any chance ? 
  how does it make it any different ? 
  if it were `` castorogenic '' would it make any difference ? 
   so our alteration of the planet 's climate is of no concern ? 
  assuming it 's our `` fault , '' why would placing blame on us make it any more of a concern than placing blame on beavers or sun or just `` that 's the way it is ? '', 
  nah , it 's just a flesh wound ... , 
   its you who is going to get smooshed and die from being hit from behind . 
  i 've had this happen to me, 
  you got smooshed and have died ? 
  left wing anarchists . 
  yup . 
  and why not ? 
  libertarianism is about social issues as much as about economics ... 
  yup . 
  oh , so the rest of the street users be damned as long as you sacred cows do n't have to face an inconvenience of getting your asses off your bikes ? 
  fascism with a human face ... you proud to be a fascist ? 
  with relay you can switch ac . 
  might be the only advantage of a relay , 
   your first if will always be triggered, 
  not if val1 is low and all the others high ... 
   it 's so slick and simple and sensible, 
  well , i can see why someone would think it slick or even simple . 
  but sensible ? 
  no way !, 
  no language with white space as a syntax token deserves `` sensible '' description ... , 
  how would you feel if adding white space to the english sentence changed its meaning ? 
  sure you could . 
  you could also argue the filet mignon should be served well-done ... , 
  really ? 
  so , you can see a dude contemplating writing the `` legalize mj '' bill , and then , upon hearing some reporter dropping an f-bomb , deciding not to do it ? 
  hell , if that 's how it works , maybe we should drop the f-bombs anytime someone talks about new taxes/bans/regulations ... ,
