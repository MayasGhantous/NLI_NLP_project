   if you choose to use the internal clock , how is having the 16mhz soldered to the pins relevant ? 
  noise ? 
  depends on what will you use it for . 
  if you plan to do any adc it will probably mess it up . 
   some days ago i shorted some circuit in arduino and it made some smoke . 
  could it be related ? 
  probably ... 
  there is tolower in std c. do n't know if it 's implemented for arduino , though . 
  try it . 
   the fact that federal prisons exist is solid evidence for the authority of the federal government . 
  nope . 
  it 's just solid evidence of the level of violence that particular gang can extend . 
   yeah but they were n't going to read it to find out . 
  it 's way too boring . 
  boring it is indeed . 
  not to mention wrong . 
  difference being , we just need to get rid of the politicians to attain a `` real '' free market , we need to get rid of all thinking people to attain a `` real '' communism ... 
  because to disrupt the market you need the intervention of the state , to disrupt the communism you need no intervention whatsoever . 
   communism is inherently anarchist . 
  that was the nebulous goal . 
  for the time being , though , `` dictatorship of the proletariat . '', 
  meaning , of course , dictatorship of the nomenklatura - proletariat being too dumb for the task ... 
  it would require a huge volume to tell all it was wrong about . 
  but the most important `` root of all evil '' was labor theory of value . 
   comcast will be a winner no matter what happens, 
  technically , not really . 
  just free the market for cable/internet service and they will have to fight on the level field . 
  maybe they will win , but only if they supply better access for a better price than the competitors ... 
   what i am against is the knee-jerk ` new regulation always makes things worse ' that bounces around echo chambers like this sub . 
  well , in the long run it proves to be true ... 
  hell , if they are serious i 'm quite happy with kansas !, 
  unfortunately , they have no say in that ... 
   would you guys move to kansas if they let us have it, 
  hell yes !!, 
   start your own business with minimal permission slips, 
  permission slips ?!!!, 
  what permission slips ?? 
   `` tea party extremists '' = run of the mill republicans, 
  well , not exactly ... why would the gop establishment fight them so hard if they were ? 
  sure . 
  i get an yearly check for $ 0.01 , you can have it ... , 
  * yearly, 
  unfortunately , the federales will not leave nh alone ... 
   these people are insane, 
  nope . 
  they are crooks . 
  the people who vote ( other than from the rooftops ) are insane . 
  i 'm not gon na go there ... just consider this : there 's no objective value , all values are subjective . 
  why , thank you . 
   food . 
  chicago is one of the top food cities in the world, 
  [ la fontaine ] ( http://www.readbookonline.net/readonline/19813/ ) had something to say about that ... 
  you seem to have an issue with my assertion that `` there are no objective values . '', 
  instead of giving me a reading list you could just give an example of an objective value instead ... 
   `` the labour time socially necessary is that required to produce an article under the normal conditions of production , and with the average degree of skill and intensity prevalent at the time . '', 
  iow , artificial construct having nothing in common with normal meaning of `` value , '' built specifically to let marxists weasel out of the corner they painted themselves in . 
   rather than reading a fucking book, 
  not gon na waste my time on rubbish . 
  you will not convince me to read a book on theory of phlogiston either ... 
  just for reference you might consider wesley snipes 's fate ... 
  start with the blinking led , move to the pwm fading the led ... and at this point you are already there . 
  edit : that 's assuming you just need the `` beating heart '' image , not the sim like in / u/happyhorse _ g post ... 
   i 've used that exact same screen and driver chip with an uno and the graphics drawing is no where near that fast . 
  did you use arduino libraries or programmed the `` low level ? '', 
  you might want to look at [ amforth ] ( http://amforth.sourceforge.net/ ) for some insight how easy/hard the task could be ... 
  fascism , socialism - same shit ... 
   socialism only implies worker control of the mop . 
  lol ... that only applies when the socialists want to show something is not socialism . 
  they are quite happy calling sweden or norway `` socialist '' even though there 's no `` worker control '' of anything . 
  change the definition slightly to `` collective control '' and voila , sweden and norway are ( to a degree ) socialist , but so were fascist countries ... 
  it depends how do you define `` educated . '', 
  years spent in a classroom do n't automatically translate into education . 
   i 'm about as ideologically far from y' all as possible . 
  you are a fascist or communist ? 
  what ? 
  do n't you know they built the autobahns ... , 
  just stick to the green card . 
  actually , no . 
  it does init the whole array to 0s ... 
   using-directives are fine when used in small test cases by people who know what they 're doing . 
  ... and then , junior team members are going to say : look stl wrote that , it must be the way to go ... 
   a huckster company taking the money and making the minimum effort possible, 
  do you mean a government ? 
  _ if people are inherently good we do n't need the government , if people are inherently evil we do n't dare to have one . _, 
  ( do n't remember the source . ), 
  the squirrel was probably being fed by the kids previously and lost all fear of humans . 
  that will teach him ... 
  there 's too much money in this particular racket ... 
   nobody sits at the keyboard saying , `` oh , i 'll just throw a few lines of code and see what happens . '', 
  ... although sometimes you run into code that looks like the author was doing exactly that ... 
  you can just hook them up together using i2c , spi or just plain serial ( google will get you plenty of examples . ), 
  you must keep in mind the voltage , though . 
  if your arduino is 5v use logic level converter . 
  alternatively , you can get 3.3 v mini ... 
   programming tools must be programmable, 
  must the tools to program programming tools be programmable too ? 
  the moral to this story ? 
  _ xi : thou shall read the datasheet and shall pay attention to what it sayeth ! _,
