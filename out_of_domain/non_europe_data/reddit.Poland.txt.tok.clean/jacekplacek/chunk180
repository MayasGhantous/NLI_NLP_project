  although datasheet says it 's not rated for 16 mhz at 3 v , it might work , you never know till you try ... other option : get the 3.3 v one . 
  presumably both ? 
   you seem to have given up on producing intellectually engaging comments, 
  well , before the attempt to psychoanalyze you , / u/mashimoto did raise a valid point . 
  you could try to respond to it and just ignore the second paragraph ... 
   to establish ownership of something should require occupancy or use regardless of whether its previous owner agrees to sell it to you, 
  that 's kinda impractical . 
  say you go on sabbatical , according to your definition i 'm perfectly fine to appropriate your house and all your belongings . 
  and what about some nature conservancy group setting aside some land for the wildlife ? 
  they do n't occupy/use it should i be justified to start mining there ? 
  same as working for the mafia ... 
  what 's not ordinary about it ? 
  do n't know what exactly you expect to see but you could try to generate the assembly ( with source code comments , ) that might give you some ideas what 's going on . 
  ` clever ' would be a better word for it . 
  would n't like to see those examples in a production code . 
  hint : they really need to be explained ( with the possible exception of the quicksort . ), 
   ** or came to the conclusion that the price now is worth the expense **, 
  a co z zerem ? 
  not sure about that - seems to me it 's mostly self-defense ... 
   i wish someone would create a scifi show that did n't suck . 
  firefly ? 
  that 's why they 've cancelled it - too anti-statist for the media 's taste ... 
  you can use a [ multiplexer ] ( http://www.mouser.com/productdetail/analog-devices/adg408bn/?qs=sgaepimzzmtxras98ir%252bs4ypfxgcyaotfzmrc2sxuee%3d ) and poll the sensors . 
   if this refers to an element of an array , it will return a pointer to the following element in the array, 
  not necessary . 
  consider an array of ` derived ` and the ` this ` pointer in the ` base ` ... 
   just want to mention that this may be skewed down because it counts all the kids under 16 who obviously have little to no income . 
  because it also counts them on the spending side ... 
  did you ask him if the only thing keeping him from raping and murdering was the fear of god ? 
  they have them at [ newark ] ( http://www.newark.com/nxp/74hct165n-652/ic-8bit-piso-shift-register-dip/dp/71r1345 ), 
  i have never understood why this is even controversial . 
  consider the same scenario ( from ethical point of view  you have four kids dying in the need of transplant ; one needs a heart , one needs a liver and two need a kidney . 
  there are no donors at the time and the time is running out on those kids . 
  yet there is a ( otherwise perfectly healthy ) kid with the severe appendicitis who happens to be a match for the four . 
  do you let the kid die and use his organs for the four or do you operate and doom the four ? 
  ethically , there 's no difference between those two scenarios , yet plenty of people have no problem making `` utilitarian '' decision in the first one but would n't make the same decision in the second . 
   restrictive gun laws, 
  are they more restrictive than in nyc or dc or chicago ? 
   the voting system would correct it, 
  floats are costly in arduino ... 
  it is kinda funny , unlike any other political system anarchism can not really `` prescribe '' how the society `` have to '' be organized . 
  all the anarchists can do is to speculate . 
  i firmly believe the very idea of a government is going to ( using communists ' phrasing ) wither . 
  maybe not soon but it will , eventually . 
  and , most likely , the societies are going to evolve their own models of functioning . 
   all of the land and capital are being used by various communes on the globe . 
  you have to work for a commune of starve . 
  no , no , no !, 
  do n't you know that after the real anarchists take the power there will be no need to work !, 
  you would never starve - the food and shelter and clothing would be provided by the anarchist committees !, 
  the only little thing they need is a simple replicator , you know they really exist , do n't you . 
  they are just kept hidden in the koch brothers ' basement ... , 
   people specialized in politics would rise to become as powerful as cult leaders or mob bosses, 
  ... or , dare i say , government officials ... , 
  well , there 's no contest there ...  i stopped going to / r/anarchism long time ago - they really do n't like dissenting opinions ... 
  you never know with china - otoh , this seller seems to have a good track record , i 'd say go for it . 
   100 % native american, 
  not sure what that refers to ... 
  i have several clones and they all work fine . 
  the genuine raspi , though , died ... ( to be fair , i might have been tad too rough on her , 
  he still somehow believes the police brutality is a racial issue ... 
   drop them on an island with limited food , leave by a boat, 
  not anymore than dropping adults ... iow : nope . 
  i 've managed to compile it with 2013 after removing ` noexcept ` s and the json literal . 
  `` i do n't care to belong to any club that will have me as a member . '', 
   can you enter in the states of all the outputs and then push that over all in one go, 
  yes . 
   despite the fact that these individuals do n't believe they 'll receive their social security benefits , few have demanded it be shored up ** by fairly taxing the wealthy ** . 
  uhmm ... 
  what about it ? 
   i 'm pretty sure people were rational before there was propositional logic . 
  people were functioning before there was a biology . 
  what 's your point ? 
  methinks you are misreading the op 's comment . 
  propositional logic as a discipline is just an attempt at formalizing ( or discovering ) the rules of reasoning . 
  the rules themselves are there , whether we know them or not . 
  can not speak for op but the way i read it he means that the rationality is a direct byproduct of those rules , not of our understanding of them . 
  same with the science of biology - it 's just our way of discovering the workings of the living organisms . 
  they 're still gon na work the same way irrespective of our understanding . 
  as the price of everything else ( baring government involvement , ) the price of atmega2560 is a point where the supply and the demand curves intersect . 
  or , to make the long story short , the demand is not high enough to make the economy of scale kick in . 
  there 's always a way , the question is do you want to spend the time/money to figure it out . 
  edit : you might try to google the markings on the display - perhaps someone did figure it out ... 
   id like to have the arduino boot when a button is held , to display status - but i 'd like it to be instant . 
  you may consider putting it into sleep mode and wake it up with the button . 
  also , as / u/doomhammer458 says , you could get a pro mini - it will draw much less power . 
  judging by the [ datasheet ] ( http://www.micropik.com/pdf/hcsr04.pdf ) ( . pdf ) it should be good enough . 
  perhaps you are doing something wrong code-wise ? 
   acceleration would only change from 9.8 when the robot begins the rise and ends the rise, 
  not really . 
  it 's tilted when on the ramp ... 
  hmm ... tfa cites bunch of people ( sometimes , not surprisingly , out of context ) but fails to say ** how ** the peasantry was `` whipped into industrial wage slaves , '' with the possible exception of mentioning game laws ( which btw were in effect long before the industrial revolution , remember robin hood ? ), 
   the probability broach -- l. neil smith, 
  pretty much anything by el neil ... 
  you have it wrong . 
  the net vector ( vertical from the external pov ) stays the same , the y-axis ( from the accelerometer pov ) is now the fraction of 1g . 
  sorry , the actual programming is a big part of the fun for me . 
  not to mention i really like knowing the every last bit of what 's going on ... , 
   allcaps tends to be reserved for naming constants, 
  actually , allcaps are ( by tradition ) used for preprocessor macros .
