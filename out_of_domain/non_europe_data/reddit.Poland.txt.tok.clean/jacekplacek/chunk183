  actually , if you power it through the barrel plug , you need something like 7-12v , as / u/doomhammer458 has said , you can feed 12v straight to it but that could lead to overheating the regulator . 
  correct on both points . 
  it 's important when bypassing the arduino 's regulator you have to supply regulated 5v . 
  7-12v is for powering through regulator . 
  you will damage the arduino supplying too high voltage to vcc . 
  i have used very similar one before - it was pretty stable . 
  no problem . 
  thanks for the gold , 
  well , with the wall wart he 's planning to use rated at 6 amps , he is most likely below that ... 
  missing a header file ? 
   i actually would want the value to persist . 
   if you do n't want it to persist, 
  hmmm ... dunno about logic and math but your reading comprehension sucks ... , 
   obviously using analogread ( ) gives a resistance value but not in the form i need it in for my calculations, 
  what do you mean ? 
   but the country has also been developing its own homegrown processors , and the u.s. ban could accelerate those efforts . 
   while ( frequency = = 519.88 ), 
  this [ will not work ] ( http://floating-point-gui.de/errors/comparison/ ) . 
  you have also an extra semicolon ... 
   i also tried while ( 500 < = frequency < = 600 ) ; digitalwrite ( left , high ) ;, 
  and this will not even compile . 
  even if you fix the predicate you will get an infinite loop if frequency fails within the range . 
  semicolon again . 
   or whatever the windows equivalent is . 
  that would be atmel studio ... , 
  the second approach should work :, 
  while ( 500 < = frequency & & frequency < = 600 ) digitalwrite ( left , high ) ;, 
  edit : assuming the digitalwrite will affect frequency . 
  otherwise infinite loop again , 
  because the sensor , when active , draws more current than attiny can handle . 
  when you say `` in series '' do you mean the drain of the first one connected to the gate of the second ? 
  kinda like darlington ? 
  thanks . 
  your while loop spins forever , once fsrreading becomes  800 . 
  put your analogread inside the while loop . 
  thanks . 
  it took me a while to grok it but i think i get it now , 
  dunno ... that 's how britts spell it . 
  and perhaps ozzies and kiwis . 
  cannucks are kinda 50-50 so you seem to be outnumbered ... , 
  ... or if 9 black robed dudes can `` interpret '' what it means ... 
  because it 's not theft - it 's extortion . 
  theft is stealthy ... 
  by your approach the holocaust was n't illegal either . 
  poor nazis were really railroaded at nurnberg ... / s, 
  `` maintaining a society '' is in itself very statist idea . 
  that 's what i do n't like about ancaps - they want statist ideas/paradigm without the state . 
  the society does n't need to be `` maintained , '' it can `` maintain '' itself quite nicely . 
  baring some asshole `` maintainers '' messing things up . 
  so , what 's the question ? 
  plenty of places - ebay , radioshack ( good option if you run into the closing sale , ) [ sparkfun ] ( https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/178 ) , etc. 
  some possible issues :, 
  voltage divider - the resistors are never 100 % accurate , possible way to improve is to get better tolerance resistors . 
  noise . 
  you might want a [ lc filter on avcc ] ( http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/36167/understanding-the-avcc-pin-wiring-on-arduinoleonardo-low-pass-filter ) but that would ( perhaps ? 
  not sure with the nano , too lazy to check  require messing with the nano itself ... 
  check the dht22 datasheet - looks like you connected ground to the nc pin ( from memory , so not sure . ), 
   oh no this was without the voltage regulator . 
  i was trying to power it off of the arduino 5v . 
  that ** was ** with voltage regulator . 
  arduino has one . 
   according to them i 'm the crazy one because i do not believe in the divine right of kings . 
  you are behind times - now it 's `` social contract '' and `` will of the people . '', 
  guess you should ask your grandma instead of barging into chefs ' den ... , 
   there 's virtually no debate within the gaia worshiping community about whether or not climate change is happening , what 's causing it , or how to stop it . 
  denying human caused climate change is the equivalent of heresy . 
  ftfy, 
  the `` scientific community '' you are talking about is almost exclusively comprised of climate and environmental `` scientists '' ( with the smudge of political `` scientists '' thrown in for a good measure . ), 
  you know , the bunch of dudes who used to occupy the darkest corners of the universities ' basements , nobody paying much attention to them . 
  now , all of the sudden , they find themselves basking in the limelight and awash in grants !, 
  but only those , of course , who preach doomsday . 
  you might notice the suspicious absence of the self-respecting physicists , chemists and geologists in this bunch ( you know , like the actual real scientists . ), 
  heck , the `` scientists '' you are talking about are even giving credence to the `` gaia hypothesis '' as an actual scientific theory !, 
  which kinda makes sense : since the real science can not support their doomsday scenarios , it has to be gaia that got pissed and is going to unleash all the havoc on the evil humans ... 
  that 's pretty simple : some obscure niche academia workers came out with the idiotic `` theory '' of a doomsday . 
  doomsday always generates media attention . 
  then some nobodies in the un ( which has been losing the appearance of relevance for quite a long time already ) figured out the global doomsday is ** the ** thing that can make them seem important again . 
  and when politicians and bureaucrats figured out that _ mucho dinero _ can be generated with the carbon tax the circle started its spin ... 
  guess hawkins did n't really bother to check the physics behind it ... 
   the deniers will be an extreme minority , if you can find any, 
  you mean the heretics ... no , nobody wants to get blacklisted . 
  if you had any physics knowledge at all and were willing to do some checking you would know what i mean . 
  that 's here is your problem : you do n't consult anybody about scientific facts , you just check them yourself . 
  obviously , you could n't bother ( or lack intellectual capacity to do it . ), 
   i just reject the idea that socialism has no good response or alternative for the allocation of resources . 
  i assume you have some idea about what the `` good response or alternative for the allocation of resources '' would be ? 
   actually , i do consult people for scientific facts . 
  i often consult journals like scientific america . 
  i look at studies by major universities , i consult the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and the national academies of sciences . 
  these are the types of sources that i use to consult my scientific facts with along with my professors . 
  iow you do n't know your facts , you just use hearsay to jump to the conclusion . 
  i like to check my facts myself . 
  if you did that you could easily notice the agw hypothesis does n't really conform to the physical laws ( without a lot of hand-waving . ), 
   well it 's your word against , you know , actual climate scientists, 
  science does n't work that way . 
  if the idiot can prove something and the proof is solid , all the established `` scientific authorities '' be damned . 
  that 's the beauty of it . 
   and you failed to tell me exactly why agw hypothesis does n't conform to the physical laws . 
  i will not do your homework for you , unless you are willing to contract it out to me , for a price of course , 
  the first hint : look up henry 's law .
