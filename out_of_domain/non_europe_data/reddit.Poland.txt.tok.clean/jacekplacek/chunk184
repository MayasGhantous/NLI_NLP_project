   have you ** fried ** a darlington pair to boost voltage ? 
  i do n't believe frying one will help ... , 
   rothbard forbid an ancap do any work without demanding paytment . 
  let 's see - i have a roof that needs fixing . 
  are you willing to come over and do it for me , please ? 
  pretty please with cherry on top ? 
  did n't think so ... you must be one of those dastardly ancaps !, 
   i know henry 's law and there is nothing in it that contradicts global warming . 
  there 's plenty in it to make you start thinking ... assuming you are willing and capable of doing so . 
  try plugging the actual data and see what percentage of the puny amount of co2 , we managed to inject into atmosphere since the start of the industrial revolution , should stay in the atmosphere . 
  you might get surprised at your findings . 
  notice , i do n't deal in hearsay and do n't invoke anybody 's authority - just simple math and physics . 
   climate change denial is just as laughable as, 
  but it 's your shamans who are the `` climate change deniers . '', 
  most semi-intelligent people are quite aware the climate is changing - always has been and always will be . 
  only the bunch of gaia worshipers , led by the prophet algor deny it . 
  according to them the climate would be forever the same if it were n't for the evil humans . 
   climate scientists do realize that not all co2 stays in the air . 
  the number is about 43 % and in fact , there have been studies chronicling these things . 
  < sigh /  i 'm asking you to think for yourself and perhaps do some grade school arithmetic and you just cite your shamans ... first , your link does n't address henry 's law at all , in fact it does n't address any science whatsoever . 
  all it does is assembles some arbitrary data and draws arbitrary conclusions . 
  and you swallow it as gospel . 
  there 's a good reason i 've started with henry 's law because it can establish some baselines . 
  so , if you are not afraid of `` losing your religion '' just plug some actual numbers into it and see for yourself . 
  notice i never ask you to take my word for anything ( unlike algorists ) all i ask you to do is to check for yourself . 
  i 'm even willing to make it easier for you : in [ this article ] ( http://worldoceanreview.com/en/wor-1/ocean-chemistry/co2-reservoir/ ) ( notice its authors are firmly in the warm-mongering camp so you can not accuse me of posting `` links to some blog posts , fox new articles , and some junk science explanation '' ) there 's enough data for you to make informed decision , if you are willing to do that . 
  if you do n't trust the data in there feel free to google for it . 
  as you can see the amount of co2 in the oceans is ** 60 times ** the amount in the atmosphere . 
  according to henry 's law , only less than 2 % of the co2 we contributed should stay in the atmosphere , not 43 % . 
  check it out , and if you want we can try to see the implications . 
  but that should n't be a problem with due ... 
  hmm ... that still leaves ~ ~ chrysler/fiat ~ ~ , subaru , honda , nissan and koreans . 
  plenty of choice . 
  edit : oops , guess no chrysler ... 
   i see that you 're are unaccustomed to systemic thinking . 
  what you call `` systemic thinking '' is actually just a collectivist mind-jerk . 
  works for cows and other dumb herd animals . 
  basically , you are just another pissant commie asshole . 
   islamic primitives . 
  any different than your kind of a primitive ? 
   there is no difference . 
  of course there is a difference . 
  two gold krugerrands are quite equal while definitely not being the same ... 
  you want to be more precise ? 
  sure , consider two h2 molecules ... 
  are ** you ** this uncomprehending ? 
  / u/haqshenas suggested not buying their cars ( boycotting , as in showing the offending companies our displeasure with their lobbying , presumably ) and / u/tomow329 voiced his opinion on futility of such action . 
  i have merely suggested there are alternatives ... 
  < sigh /  let me spell it out for you : if you want to boycott the companies from the list , there are alternatives . 
  so , over the ages the temperature and co2 was going through the cycles , exceeding at the peaks what we have now . 
  before it was all `` natural '' but this time around it 's `` our fault . '', 
  over the ages the warm temperatures and high co2 concentration at the peaks was a boon to the life on earth ( and the last time around to the humans as well ) but this time gaia got really pissed and is going to cook us all !, 
   engages in violence ,, 
  ... by establishing an eye contact with the massah ... 
   violently resists arrest ,, 
  ... by running away from the massah ... 
   gets hurt : `` dindu nuffin ! '', 
  gets his spine broken : `` serves him right ! '', 
  is that what you are saying ossifer ? 
   the problem with polygamy is that it causes trouble when done right , especially to society at large . 
  it 's not conducive to stable , growing civilization . 
  have you ever heard about ottoman empire ? 
  what about ancient egypt ? 
  or pretty much every civilization before christianity ... 
  there 's no such thing as `` market failure '' anymore than there 's a `` weather failure . '', 
  you might be convinced some outcome of market forces is a `` failure '' but that 's just your subjective , biased pov . 
  even the outcomes caused by state intervention are not `` failures '' other than , perhaps , not meeting the ( insane ) expectations of politicians . 
  look at it this way : when the river flows his way it 's just the way it is , if it washes down your house it 's your failure , not the river 's . 
  when people dam the river and it overflows and wash your house down , it 's still not a `` river failure . '', 
  they were unlocked . 
  ( perhaps because years ago someone did break in . ), 
   if you mean the former then that is true for land . 
  how do you figure ? 
  ( except for land appropriated by the governments ) most of the land was homesteaded in this country . 
  and , yes , since the natives did n't have a concept of land ownership and did n't themselves think they `` owned '' the land , i do n't see how it 's not legit . 
  kinda curious - from time to time we also see some classist neo-marksist propaganda in here , do n't recall seeing your outrage somehow ... 
  never said the ( mainstream ) economists make any sense ... 
   there exists another conceivable outcome where an individual may be made better-off without making someone else worse-off, 
  `` better/worse off '' according to what criteria ? 
  yeah , but who 's gon na take the first bullet ? 
   are speed limits really statist propaganda ? 
  do you really believe dale ernhard jr driving 75 on the sunny sunday morning in his brand new porsche , on the highway with posted 65 limit , is less safe than the old lady , driving 65 in an old hyundai excell , in the rush hour during the snowstorm ? 
   there will be ample supply . 
  ... but not much of a demand , except from politicians , nigerians and other frauds ... 
   clearly native american 's felt that their `` home '' was being `` stolen '' . 
  nomadic people do n't have homes ... other than temporary ones . 
  sure , later on they did figure out something is amiss , but at first they were quite happy to `` sell '' the land for some goods ( probably chuckling how stupid pale faces were . ), 
  they figured since they would move on anyways , getting anything in exchange was just a bonus . 
  kinda like you would probably not mind getting some new tablet for 5 acres of the ocean ... 
   nobody says that anymore . 
  i do . 
  and i 'm not a repugnican . 
  marxist is a specific term - `` commie pinko bastard '' groups them all ... 
   no , we got freedom of speech , albeit hatespeech is illegal . 
  but i 'll take it . 
  big whoopee . 
  plenty of feudal lords did n't give a shit if the peasants were flapping their yaps either . 
   we got freedom of assembly, 
  only if massah allows ... 
   strong property rights,
