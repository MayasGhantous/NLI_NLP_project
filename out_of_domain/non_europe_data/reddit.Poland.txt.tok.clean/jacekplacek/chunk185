   an extremely common word used centuries before the holocaust, 
  ... and swastika was a common symbol used before the holocaust ... nowadays the term `` denier '' is being used only in two contexts - `` holocaust denier '' and `` algorism denier . '', 
  have you ever heard about `` string theory deniers ? '', 
  i do n't see how that is a valid argument . 
  the child can do the late-self-abortion when and if the existential anguish is too much to bear ... 
   i think your solution sounds much more horrible . 
  just kill yourself if you do n't like it . 
  that 's like a statist saying just leave the country if you do n't like it here . 
  but yours is worse - it 's like statist saying you will be deported if you do n't like it here . 
  compared to 328 , 644 has twice the flash and twice the ram , more io pins , extra uart and spi .

  do n't you realize they are running out of the toilet paper only because the evil americans sneak up into venezuela and buy all the toilet paper out ?

  much faster , more ram , more flash . 
   why would n't i just buy silver coins ? 
  too bulky ? 
   this does n't answer why they 're better at doing those things than other people . 
  `` darwinism '' in action . 
  they got rich doing things better than their competitors . 
   finished my design of a part [ ... ] it was an eye opening experience . 
  you have designed a part with your eyes closed ? 
  i 'm impressed ... , 
   it does n't explain why granting those people ownership of the resources, 
  nobody `` granted '' them use of the resources - they got the resources because they made money before . 
  they made money before because they were better than their competitors . 
  are they going to do similar campaign to reduce injuries during rape ? 
  - `` do n't fight it , lay back and try to enjoy it '', 
   what is this supposed to tell me ? 
  that , presumably , they are better at this than the others ? 
  < sigh /  yes , it does . 
  they have been making better decisions before . 
  kinda like , if your team has a player with a track record of scoring more than the others , it would be stupid for a coach to replace him with a rookie without any track record . 
   that you score more than your teammates does n't explain why you need to be the one who owns all of their equipment . 
  ... unless you are the one who 's paid for it ... 
  why ? 
  people 've been soldering for over 100 years now - i have yet to hear about a single lead poisoning case from soldering ... 
  and the lead-free stuff is harder to work with . 
   how did government start ? 
  the answer lies in the concept of `` return on violence . '', 
  hunters-gatherers did n't have governments \u2020 - the return on violence was insignificant , fighting the group that just killed a deer needs more effort ( not to mention danger ) than hunting the deer . 
  with the development of the agriculture this has changed . 
  peasants were n't as skilled in violence as hunters , some of the later decided it might be profitable to rob the peasants . 
  after a while an uneasy understanding developed between the robbers and the robbed - in exchange for the robbers not killing the peasants they delivered part of their harvest . 
  at the same time the robbers realized the other bands of bandits could kill their goose , so it was in their interest to defend their peasants . 
  \u2020 by the government i mean the involuntary kind , the tribal chiefs/councils are not government in that sense . 
   the right to a just and free trial needs others to provide me with courts of law , judges , and possibly lawyers . 
  is that not a right in your book ? 
  you 've got it wrong - the right to a free trial means the state can not jail you on the whim . 
  ** if ** they want to jail you ** then ** they have to provide the stuff . 
  if they do n't want to , they might just as well let you be . 
  in a sense , you still have the right to free healthcare - if someone makes you sick or injures you they will have to pay your hospital bill . 
   the right to healthcare could be a right . 
  why not the `` right '' to porsche ? 
  tell that to my daughter , you might get a black eye from that experiment ... 
   and to what degree would bernie 's legislation compel doctors to provide a service in a way that differs from other public services ? 
  you do n't have a `` right '' to the `` services '' of policemen , firefighters or librarians . 
  [ put it to sleep ] ( http://playground.arduino.cc/learning/arduinosleepcode ) and attach an interrupt to the button pin ( it does n't need to do anything , just to wake it up . ), 
  so , your loop would look something like :, 
  void loop ( ), 
  sleep_mode ( ) ;, 
  cli ( ) ;, 
  / / your code here, 
   `` you ca n't solve a hard math problem with any amount of violence . '', 
  of course you can : figure out the who is in the top 20 ( or whatever number you think will work better ) math geniuses , kidnap their families and tell them you will execute random member of their families every week ( month ? ), 
  until the problem is solved ... 
  inability to do any meaningful economic calculations .

  how about one word ? 
  [ the addition of a single word in the preamble to the united states declaration of independence , where in it states that governments `` derive their just power from the _ unanimous _ consent of the governed . 
  '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_american_confederacy#history ), 
   i believe that giving citizens shares would make them very interested in what 's going on .
