  yeah , they would vote themselves dividends ... 
   you can use 3 mosfets to create an h-bridge, 
  better yet , just get the h-bridge chip - it 's way too easy to mess something up with the hand-made h-bridge . 
  op linked to the nimh battery ... just sayin ' . 
  besides , most lipo batteries have built-in protection anyway . 
   that is also true of all normal manual cars, 
  not quite , the clutch will prevent you from doing something stupid ... 
  they are good if you want to do something requiring more io pins or more flash/ram than uno . 
  other than that they are pretty much the same . 
   what are they going to do , give you a third life sentence ? 
  they can give you a needle ... 
  although i 'm not sure i would rather spend the rest of my life in the slammer than die . 
  `` it 's not unlawful when ** we ** do it ! '', 
   did n't give a shit about mainstream political news . 
  `` you may not give a shit about politics , does n't mean politics will not give a shit about you . '', 
  _ paraphrased , forgot the source _, 
  contrary to popular believes , tsa 's _ raison d'\u00eatre _ is not to prevent smuggling of the weapons or terrorism . 
  it 's to train the public to accept a police state as the new normal . 
   we 're the abnormal people in the world , not the statists . 
  the statist has the world exactly as they expect it to be . 
  you are absolutely right !, 
  we are really the freaks . 
  the human as an animal is a herd creature , and as such wants to be ordered around and ( despite what old ben said ) values `` security '' ( even if it 's just a illusion of one ) above all . 
  liberty is just a lip service . 
  it appears we are only about 5 ~ 10 % of the population , and the american experiment ( while it lasted ) was the result of the natural self-selection of the immigrants . 
  the `` damaged '' ones were much more likely to say `` screw it '' and try their luck in the new land , as yet not encumbered with the multitude of masters . 
  that 's where the difference between america and other colonies comes from : most of the others were either sent there as banishment ( australia ) or as the government agents . 
  unfortunately , the `` freedom '' gene is not a dominant one - so it 's getting diluted . 
  as we can easily see in the prevalent attitudes now . 
  so , basically we are screwed . 
  there will not be a free us . 
  the best we can hope for is either aggregating in one place ( nh ? ), 
  and wait for inevitable fall of the american empire or opening of the `` final frontier '' where we can try to do what our forefathers did . 
  ( disclaimer : i 'm a pollack , so the `` our '' is more figurative than literal . ), 
  `` caution / u/frligatankar is an atheist , thus nothing ( s ) he says can be taken seriously . '', 
  do n't mix your religion ( and , yes , atheism is a religion ) into politics ... 
   `` they can fix it by rising taxes '' - `` no , they ca n't . '', 
  of course not . 
  but they 've already just been printing more !, 
  sooner or later the inflation ( hyperinflation ? ), 
  is gon na catch up , but no need to rise taxes !, 
  yup . 
  it 's a non-theist religion ... , 
  india and china are not third world . 
  and definitely not `` two bit . '', 
  so , how do you convince people to work sewers or septic tanks ? 
  so you think 13 year olds are your slaves ? 
  who is disgusting now ? 
   he was looking for the exact kind of comment you gave . 
  and he got it . 
  so what ? 
  are you going to self-censor on the account of trolls ? 
  i thought money was evil !, 
  ... but that 's different argument than / u/atoledo 's one ... 
  dunno ... depends who 's doing the fondling . 
  although i never got lucky yet . 
  nope . 
  the only bernie that shows up is in jon stewart 's may 29th episode ... perhaps you are secretly socialist and do n't even know it ? 
  why not ? 
  since i have android phone and tablet , i 'm already in google 's sights anyway . 
   which is a big no-no for them, 
  do n't be na\u00efve ... 
  you want the power over them to decide if they can have sex . 
   would n't structuring a society on subjective theories that can not have controlled experiments be a bad idea, 
  `` structuring society '' is a bad idea . 
  if you take on the task you will fail , unless you are successful in becoming an absolute ruler . 
  in that case you might think you are successful but the society will be beyond miserable . 
  every society has some kind of structure - does n't mean there is someone doing the structuring . 
  you seem to think you can decide what principles ** you ** can impose on the society to enforce ** your ** way of structuring . 
  that 's pretty much explicit in your question . 
  but , in that case , the question does n't make any sense . 
  kinda like asking `` are zebra 's stripes a good idea ? '', 
  how is it better than due ? 
   it would violate the nap if a contract existed to say how he was to use the photos . 
  it would violate the contract , not the nap . 
   p -  is literally search and replaced by the preprocessor ( something that comes before the compiler ) to ( * p ), 
  no , it 's not . 
  ' -  ' is a true c and c++ operator , it can be overloaded and even has a special semantics allowing to chain it , which is instrumental in patterns like smart pointer . 
  arduino does n't have any os but it is real-time ... 
  < paranoid mode  that 's what they want you to think < / paranoid mode  , 
   detect which kind of serial is being used and use that one until power cycle . 
  done . 
  would it be enough to assume ethernet when no serial detected ? 
  without state enforcement racial ( or any other ) egalitarianism is simply the attitude of the beholder . 
  they will themselves face any consequences ( good or bad ) of their choices . 
  so , it would n't be a problem even for an outright racist - he is still free to accept or reject it . 
  so , apart from `` wow '' and `` lol '' : did you read the nsdap platform ? 
  if you exclude all the nationalistic and racist crap , the program is pretty much socialist ( in the soft , today 's meaning _ \u00e0 la _ bernie or socialist/social democratic parties of western europe ) or `` progressive '' if that 's your preferred term . 
  having said that , which of those planks did n't nazis implement ? 
  hmm ... is n't `` asian '' and `` a nice big firm ass '' pretty much mutually exclusive ... , 
   so ... not socialist, 
   yall are bad at this game god damn, 
  still not right wing either ... unless you think bernie is a closet republican . 
  btw , we are only accepting your ( as you left wing nutters ) definition - for years now you were telling us sweden or norway are an excellent example of socialism working !, 
  so , whom are we to believe if not commie pinko bastards ? 
   i 'm not a liberal , i 'm not even a leftist . 
  yes you are ( on top of being semi-illiterate . ), 
   there is n't `` absolutely zero doubt '' that solipsism is false , after all . 
  there can not be . 
  y' all are just figments of my imagination ... ,
