   uh , no . 
  must not be familiar with the attiny , but the atmega that 's in the uno and such is a 5v chip . 
  uh , no . 
  [ operating voltage ( vcc ) : 1.8 to 5.5 ] ( http://www.atmel.com/devices/atmega328p.aspx?tab=parameters ), 
   chip running at 3v wo n't see a 3v input as low, 
  but was n't that your original claim ? 
  even then you would still be wrong : according to the [ datasheet ] ( http://www.atmel.com/images/atmel-8271-8-bit-avr-microcontroller-atmega48a-48pa-88a-88pa-168a-168pa-328-328p_datasheet_complete.pdf ) ( page 313 ) for vcc = 5v the max low value is .3 vcc ( 1.5 v ) and the min high is .6 vcc ( 3v ) ... 
   in any case , we have bigger problems , like keeping today 's nations alive, 
  why would that be desired ? 
  the concept of a nation came out of state , and quite recently at that ... 
  i 'd say let 's nations die out , the quicker the better . 
  the `` market '' is not a thing , it 's a mental shortcut to a phenomenon of people exchanging things/services/ideas / what-have-you . 
  in this sense there 's always a `` market , '' even in a prison . 
  a `` state , '' otoh , is just a commonly shared delusion , with bunch of thugs extorting the rest of a society and claiming it 's `` for the benefit of society '' and the majority believing ( or just resigned to ) it . 
  granted , the `` state '' will always , to a greater or lesser degree , interfere with the `` market , '' still the question as phrased does n't make much sense . 
  you are welcome . 
  you seemed to need it , 
  btw , can you explain to me why the same race you credit ( perhaps not without some merit ) with creating laissez faire economies , is also creating the most oppressive , totalitarian ones ? 
   the real problem for people is where to put money if not in stocks . 
  since i do n't have money to put anywhere , i 'll just buy some popcorn ... , 
  not sure about the long term . 
  tends to go faster than popcorn , 
   it 's always vulnerable to a neighboring protection racket, 
  it might be interesting to notice successful protection rackets only appeared in the cities with victim disarmament laws ... 
   my personal , and unpopular , solution is to only travel by car . 
  not really easy if you plan to go to europe ... 
  oh , stop bitching . 
  noone forces you to click ... 
  what i would really like to see is a trump vs sanders presidential debate ... , 
   after all , with 8 years of obama nobody has come to take your guns . 
  perhaps the gun owners ' `` myopia '' has something to do with it ... 
  you mean would i rather live in lesotho or bahrain ? 
  lol , keep telling yourself that ... 
  the only `` domination '' nra has is bunch of angry gun owners not willing to take more shit . 
  obama would love to disarm us but even he realizes it would be a total disaster for the democratic party . 
   who cares what he `` really wants '' to do if he has no means to do it ? 
  he can not do it exactly because there 's plenty of single issue voters . 
  should they stop being vigilant , gun grabbers would have their wishes . 
  tried something like that once . 
  decoupling capacitors on the atxmega - needed 4 , thought they would neatly fit in between the chip 's leads . 
  did 2 and then gave up ... , 
   the trotskyists of the workers party of the united states also successfully used their entry into the socialist party of america to recruit their youth group and other members . 
  not to mention they managed to take over the republican party ... 
  actually , i do - had a misfortune once of buying this shit thinking it was just a mayo ... 
  what power ? 
   a sufficiently powerful person , in the absence of government , simply is the government, 
  what does it even mean ? 
  if the good gubmint did n't prohibit that , would waltons or kochs seize part of my paycheck ? 
  would they jail me for smoking a joint ? 
   the constitution lays out rights, 
  the constitution ** enumerates ** certain rights ... 
   government means individuals who are willing to use force get what they want, 
  ftfy, 
  what about nobody imposing on nobody else ... ? 
   how is that meaningfully different than what i wrote ? 
  `` lay out '' is nearly synonymous with `` make '' or `` give , '' `` enumerate '' means just spell out existing rights . 
   the point was that the rights are to persons , not citizens . 
  no argument here . 
  yup . 
  governments just bring it to the new level . 
  do you really believe koch brothers would be able to demand a significant portion of my paycheck ? 
  or would be willing/able to lock me in a dungeon for smoking a joint ? 
  it takes government thugs and dimwitted enablers like yourself . 
   it is so sad to see libertarians admit they are unable to defend their ideas . 
  says the dude whose only argument ** for ** the government is `` i think would be mayhem ... '', 
   i think the state needs to have some control over operations that put the ecological well being of entire regions at risk, 
  kinda like japanese state over fukushima ? 
  dunno ... seems to me customs made by wandering band of puritans make even less sense for us now ... 
   if someone is so poor that they are considering prostitution, 
  you have no idea what you are talking about . 
  obviously the girl [ charging $ 1000.00 an hour ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eliot_spitzer#prostitution_scandal ) did it because she was soooo poor !, 
   i 'm a communist . 
  fuck your property rights !, 
  ... and human rights too , eh ... 
  i have always been extremely sceptical about all the market `` prophets . '', 
  if the dude ** really ** believed his own predictions , he would already be richer than buffet ... 
  oh , for goodness sake - i came from the communist country and the last thing you can accuse me of is `` bring [ ing ] a sense of entitlement '' with me . 
  as a matter of fact you guys sound to me like statist commie bastards ... , 
   their welfare system and their schools become overcrowded and violent crime rises rapidly, 
  all statist institution as you probably already noticed ... the welfare seeking immigrants would n't come because there would be no welfare for them to seek . 
  the criminals would n't come since the armed populace is not an easy target for criminals . 
  safe to say the only people who would immigrate would be exactly the people we want/need ... 
   i was an ancap before this account . 
  lol , for an `` ancap '' you certainly bring `` interesting '' ideas to the table ... 
  how would you `` enforce '' border control without the state ? 
   i forget who did the article on that , i would love to find it again . 
  [ l. neil smith ] ( http://www.ncc-1776.org/tle2000/libe76-20000612-06.html ), 
  _ warning : old article , most links no worky _, 
   no one can forecast without committing to the bet ? 
  let 's put it this way : if they really believed their predictions they would use the `` knowledge '' to enrich themselves . 
  they do n't , ergo they do n't believe ... 
  so tell me , how come i could come to this continent without a penny , work bunch of menial jobs , including newspaper delivery , gas station , concrete laying , assembly work , and plenty of others and still make it to the somehow higher middle class , including my daughter getting the law degree ? 
  and i did n't even speak that good english ... ( some would say i still do n't , 
  listen , if the dude tfa is talking about put his money into options at the dip and the bounce of the market , he would be a billionaire already ... 
  you are welcome . 
  btw el neil is really worth reading - he 's been pretty much an ancap for a long long time . 
  some of his novels are pretty good and always have been full of libertarian/ancap themes . 
  one could be particularly prophetic [ ( i hope  ] ( http://www.amazon.com/hope-l-neil-smith/dp/1604502932 ) with the settings earily similar to the current election cycle with a very pleasing outcome , 
   and through this `` fantasy '' libertarian era a lot of bad things happened . 
  like what ?
