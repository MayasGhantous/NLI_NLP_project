  well , he is obviously highly experienced in the matter ... , 
  even if he is ? 
  so what should we call a jewish national-socialist ? 
  nobody called him `` a nazi . '', 
  `` national socialist '' is descriptive and pretty much exactly fits sanders : by his own label he is a socialist and by his rhetoric he is a nationalist ... 
  there 's a greek word for it : hubris . 
  hey , he was born that way ... , 
   net increase in economic growth, 
  what does it even mean ? 
  if government puts up 100000 statues of obama around the country it will be an `` economic growth '' in macroeconomic sense . 
  will it benefit you ? 
  the question does n't make sense - it 's asking if the government can spend your money better than you would spend it yourself . 
  obviously , from your point of view it would n't - sure , from some other people point of view it would . 
  i would be quite happy ( well , not really  if the government took money from you and some other people and built me a mansion ... 
  the advantage of the markets is the owner of the money deciding how to spend it . 
  any other outcome is going to be spending someone 's money on the things they would n't spend themselves . 
   i started to understand that a high trust nation is important, 
  `` high trust '' my ass . 
  how come your `` high trust '' society needs contracts , fine prints , judges , courts , arbitrations and ** enforcement ** to conduct any business while the `` low trust '' arabs can conduct business on a simple handshake ? 
  i 've been buying stuff on the web for a long time now , and the only time i was taken to the cleaners was by the `` high trust '' american business while the worst that ever happened when buying from `` low trust '' china was a shipment damaged in transit - which , btw , the chinese `` low trust '' dude rectified right away by sending the replacement . 
  he did n't have to - i had absolutely no way to ** enforce ** it ... 
   best argument against the ltv, 
  there 's no such a thing as objective value . 
  no matter if you call it `` use value '' ( the hammer has an use value for a carpenter , no value for someone who does n't use it ) or `` exchange value '' ( i might spend $ 5 for a big mac when i 'm hungry - i do value the big mac higher than the $ 5 at this time , once i eat it i 'm not going to buy a second one - i value it lower than the $ 5 , obviously . ), 
  when marxists say the `` value '' of something is the ( qualified ) value of labor put into its production they pretty much assign the `` price '' of labor as the value - which has absolutely no valid meaning . 
  if i decided to build contraptions that take , let 's say , $ 100 in labor/material cost and noone is willing to pay even $ 50 for it what the hell is its value ? 
  ok , so explain to me why doing business with the threat of `` contract enforcement '' is `` high trust '' why doing the business on a a handshake is `` low trust ? '', 
  ok , can you give me a link to a video with the ( straight ) answer to my question ? 
  well , all i see there is a bad history leading to even worse philosophy . 
  still no answer to my question . 
  it still seems to me the level of trust in the muslim world is much higher than in the west european one ... 
  you mean hispanics have their own delusional nrxes ? 
  who would have thought ... , 
  the commander-in-chief deciding where to house dod agency and how to use dod property !, 
  terrible , terrible tyranny !, 
  he charged with his buttocks !, 
  if you want pp funded , noone prevents you from donating . 
  i do n't see how you could mistake taxpayers paying for ** your ** `` religious views '' for a libertarian principle . 
   also , how long do we have to pretend that he is a serious candidate ? 
  dunno ... judging by the current frontrunners , he does n't look that ridiculous . 
   how come you are ok with the federal government funding other organizations and not pp ? 
  i 'm not . 
   how come you are ok with the federal government, 
  i 'm not . 
   how come you are ok with the government, 
  i 'm not . 
  [ atmega1284 ] ( http://www.atmel.com/devices/atmega1284p.aspx ) or you could go for atxmega , if you do n't mind smd soldering, 
  if you mean can you process an image from it then ask yourself the questions : how many bytes is the 640x480 image ? 
  how much ram does arduino have ? 
  you can treat int as a set of flags :, 
  const int pin1 = 1 ;, 
  const int pin6 = 1 < < 6 ;, 
  int flags = 0 ;, 
  flags | = pin6 | pin3 | pin2 ;, 
  if ( flags & pin6 ), 
  / / do your thing for pin 6, 
  judging by your post , you have absolutely no clue . 
  even if someone divined from the post what the real requirements are and gave you the code , you would n't still be able to explain to the prof what the code does . 
  you really need to learn the basics first or , perhaps , switch to different major ... 
  i 'm not so sure ... do n't know if it 's just an urban myth but i was told by the tour guide when in denmark that they used to have a law allowing lethal force in defense of property in the past . 
  apparently the famous denmark 's lack of property crime was an effect of that law . 
  ( btw , any dane familiar with this - feel free to jump in . ), 
  so , even if death is a very disproportionate penalty for a theft , it can result in having no thieves and hence no thieves killed either ... 
  `` every normal man must be tempted , at times , to spit on his hands , hoist the black flag , and begin slitting throats . '', 
  `` on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart 's desire at last , and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron . '', 
  `` it is inaccurate to say that i hate everything . 
  i am strongly in favor of common sense , common honesty , and common decency . 
  this makes me forever ineligible for public office . '', 
  `` democracy is the art and science of running the circus from the monkey cage . '', 
  `` in this world of sin and sorrow there is always something to be thankful for ; as for me , i rejoice that i am not a republican . '', 
  `` the most dangerous man to any government is the man who is able to think things out ... without regard to the prevailing superstitions and taboos . 
  almost inevitably he comes to the conclusion that the government he lives under is dishonest , insane , intolerable . '', 
   taxation is n't theft . 
  you are right . 
  it 's not theft , it 's extortion . 
   newly arrived citizens would not then immediately vote to end liberty, 
  the native born citizens are already doing pretty good job voting to end even the resemblance of the remaining scraps of liberty ... 
   the predictions of hyperinflation after qe have all been discredited by the low inflation ( actually below target ! ), 
  we have had since . 
  as the dude falling from a skyscraper said passing the 32nd floor : `` so far , so good . '', 
   access to a gun significantly increases the risk of suicide, 
  hmmm ... so , japanese , with practically no access to firearms , have insignificant rate of suicides ? 
  well , i guess it 's better for everybody to have no thieves killed without a `` police state punishing some people unnecessarily '' than with one . 
  but it might be just me ... 
   usually those require at least evidence that the ends really work to get off the ground . 
  well , unless some dane contradicts me , from what i heard it seemed to actually work in denmark ... 
   self-defense is to be dealt with proportionally according to danish law , and to a much lesser degree when in defense of property . 
  it is now . 
  and it looks like denmark 's property crime rates seem to be leveling up to the european standard . 
  i admit i may be wrong , my sources are just hearsay - but there 's significant increase in property crimes starting around 1960 , after being flat since the end of wwii . 
  any thoughts about the cause ? 
  size-wise , you would n't have much problems fitting pro-mini into the case . 
  as for re-using battery - depends on your skill level . 
  the charging circuitry is ( most likely ) on the main board and it would n't be easy to separate it . 
  so , you would need to add your own . 
  overall , seems feasible . 
   there 's no way this is gravitational . 
  there is a way : the video would have to be sped up considerably , though .
