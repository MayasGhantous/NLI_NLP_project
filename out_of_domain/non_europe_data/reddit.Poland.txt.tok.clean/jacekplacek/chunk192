   saddam was a sadistic bastard and he would have done just about anything to fuck over the u.s. 
  why would he do that ? 
  before the kuwait fiasco , he was buddy-buddy with us in general and bush-the-geezer in particular ... 
   you fucking neo-cons need to wise up and stop getting us involved in wars that ca n't be won that cost 100 trillion dollars * . 
  where 's the profit in that ? 
   why having the loser, 
  one man 's loser is another man 's runner up ... 
  would you rather go on date with miss universe runner up or with her make-up artist ? 
   i 'm curious to see what you find to make something that cold . 
  [ peltier module ] ( http://www.adafruit.com/products/1335?gclid=cieknnf57mccfq-paqodngek0q ) ? 
  since op specified temp in degrees c , i assume he means sub-zero \u00b0 c. . . 
   this scenario is extremely common in real life ,, 
  iow , you perceive a `` problem '' `` extremely common '' in `` real life , '' and can not see a `` solution '' in an ancap society - aha !, 
  ancaps are wrong !, 
  they can not solve the stuff the state does n't solve !, 
  i give you a better one : there are people dying of cancer - if in ancapistan there were people dying of cancer , would anarcho-capitalism still be justifiable ? 
  i have a concept of a `` sexual property : '' anytime i see a hot girl , my perception of her `` hotness '' makes her my sexual property . 
  it 's right there in the name !, 
  there 's a conspiracy theory about that : after holocaust the jewish doctors started to advocate circumcision to make sure the possible future huns could n't tell a jew from a gentile just by looking at their dicks ... 
   since the pattern follows one of the mathematical constants found in the construction of the universe . 
  sorry , this is really bs . 
  you can pick any number you want and i will find a factor to `` prove '' your number `` follows one of the mathematical constants found in the construction of the universe . '', 
   we also know exactly how gravity works, 
  nope . 
  not true at all . 
  we know `` what '' gravity does , we have no bloody idea `` how . '', 
   cycle : any complete round or series of occurrences that repeats or is repeated . 
  sure , you can try to tie it to pi with some mysticism , you can not possibly tie it to pi * 1000 - the later number having absolutely no significance , other than looking `` round '' in one particular positional number system ... 
   you 're the one who has completely dismissed a complex and nuanced theory that moments ago you had never even heard of . 
  people tend to do that if your `` complex and nuanced theory '' tries to assign some significance to a x * y where y is some arbitrary number ... 
   the consumer sets prices by how much they value a particular product . 
  increasing taxes does not increase the value of the product . 
  that 's true - otoh , when the taxes make production unprofitable , the supply will dwindle , causing the rise in the price ... 
  ** some ** people will stop buying , the others will keep buying at the higher price ... 
  would n't it make more sense to build one based on atmega1284 ? 
  for the same effort and not much higher price you would get much powerfull one . 
   now , you could potentially use interupts for the button events , but that 's a very poor solution , and i would n't recommend it . 
  why ? 
  but ... that 's the rationale for writing non-blocking code , not for avoiding interrupts ... , 
  easier to handle ? 
  if it 's async event the interrupt is a logical way to handle it ... , 
   the teensy pins are 5v tolerant so no need to drop the voltage for 5v modules and shields . 
  question is : is teensy 's high high enough for ttl logic ? 
   i tried soldering it , but the solder is just not strong enough to hold this large of wire and it is very messy and frustrating trying to do it that way . 
  you are doing something wrong with soldering - make sure you heat up the target and let the solder melt on it . 
  my guess is you are melting the solder on the iron tip and then trying to apply it to the wire . 
  that 's the wrong way to do it . 
  something like [ this ] ( http://www.staples.com/pny-power-pack-t2200-2200mah-1-amp-black/product_239826?cid=ps:googleplas:239826&amp;ci_src=17588969&amp;ci_sku=239826&amp;kpid=239826&amp;gclid=cnwmgzzkgmgcfygaaqodryiifw&amp;kpid=239826 ) ? 
  i assume you are using a bootloader section to write your programs into flash . 
  you have to remember atmega flash is only good for about 10000 rewrites . 
  perhaps you 've already reached the limit ? 
   there is no bootloader on the chip, 
  that 's not what i meant . 
  how do you write your programs , not the firmware but the programs you write for your `` handheld computer ? '', 
  the common mistake writing to flash is doing it one byte at the time . 
  flash is always written one page at the time . 
  if you write one character the whole page gets written anyway . 
  quite easy to type in 10000 characters ... 
  any specific questions ? 
  if you want to be able to program it through usb you can get [ atmega328 with a bootloader ] ( http://www.newark.com/arduino/a000048/pre-programmed-ic-atmega-arduino/dp/13t9287?cmp=knc-gusa-gen-kwl-rem-purchase-arduino&amp;mckv= | pcrid | 64768285341 | & gclid = ciwhwlskimgcfquqaqodfz0o6g ) . 
  source ? 
   have you done something like that before ? 
  not exactly - i tend to avoid bootloaders and use atmel studio + avr dragon ... 
  not having to add usb circuitry is the main reason . 
   you have 1mb ram total, 
  lilypad is based on atmega328 - that 's only 2k ram total , minus the bootloader . 
  i guess you meant 1k ... 
   she was wearing a sweatshirt with a device made of plastic circuit board with green blinking light-emitting diodes ( leds ) in the shape of a star -- the same sweatshirt that she had worn the day before at the mit career fair . 
  she was carrying clay shaped into a rose . 
  ... and gnorty pissed his/her pants ... 
  look at [ this instructable ] ( http://www.instructables.com/id/arduino-mega-audio-file-logging/ ) . 
  could be a good starting point . 
   government does it for me . 
  you mean you do n't have balls to do it yourself ? 
  is that the famous dialectics ? 
  how does it work - responding to / u/kaseykasem implies the / u/jacekplacek is stupid ... 
  arduino ( uno ) pins are ttl compatible . 
   i really want to use a couple of toggle switches , but i noticed that a lot of them have pretty high current ratings, 
  that means they ** can ** handle these currents , does n't mean you have to supply them ... 
  you just need them for signaling , arduino pins are high impedance as inputs . 
  so , to answer your question : as many as you have free pins . 
  or add some shift registers and make it as many as you feel like , 
   i do n't get violenced for speeding , i get fined . 
  really ? 
  try not to stop when the cop flags you . 
  or try to refuse to pay the fine and then refuse to stop driving when they suspend your license ... 
  if you want to get more sophisticated you could set the interrupt on a button pin . 
  on button interrupt shine the leds , set the timer to expire in 5 min , set the timer interrupt . 
  on the timer interrupt switch the leds off - in the meantime go to sleep . 
  they look like regular toggle switches to me , the plastic caps are probably custom made - if you have access to a 3d printer you could make them yourself . 
  definitely doable . 
  just make sure you test your program before you install all the hardware - something as simple as leds going on/off in lieu of the valves/pumps . 
  that 's how you pick your worldview ? 
  by making sure it conforms to the masses ? 
   if you 're led to doubt the prospects of your system just by interacting with ordinary people , i think you should consider rethinking your system . 
  you mean if you were to find yourself in nazi germany , you should become a nazi ? 
  they are still the tax . 
  just the tax paid by the ones who did n't win . 
  what about the springs ? 
  since the retraction speed does n't seem to be an issue , you could set up a motor to squeeze/wind the spring and kind of latch to release when needed .
