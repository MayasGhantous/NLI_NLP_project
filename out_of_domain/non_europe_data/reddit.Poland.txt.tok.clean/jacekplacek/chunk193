  then the motor could wind it up again ... 
  it will work with pretty much any atmega/attiny . 
  well , it says it has a bootloader , so ftdi should work ... 
   as a self employed person you will have to pay about 7.7 % percent more than a employee because you have to pay the employer 's share of the payroll tax as well as the employee 's share . 
  otoh there 's ton of deductions you can take which you could n't as an employee ... 
   the children of these first generation immigrants regress back to the mean . 
  if that were true , should n't children of anglos regress to the species mean ? 
   ancap society will have speed limits as well . 
  why ? 
  the very concept of the arbitrary number being `` correct '' speed for the competent driver in a porshe on the sunny sunday morning , and for the old lady in a junker in a rush hour snowstorm , is simply beyond idiotic . 
  would n't be surprised if op 's name was [ gallegher ] ( http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/k/henry-kuttner/proud-robot.htm ) ... , 
  & & is a logical ` and ' operator . 
  in c and other c-like languages integral values are automatically converted to bool , when needed . 
  so , in your code you were telling the compiler to convert the value in a ` buttonid2 ' array to boolean , convert the address of '' : '' character array to bool , perform logical ` and ' operation on them and convert it to int for printing ... 
   marijuana , despite what people think , is detrimental to your health,

  in the rgb led section you should probably mention they are either common cathode or common anode . 
  that can be confusing , esp with using darlington array to drive them - common anode works with cheap uln2308 , for common cathode you need something like [ mic5891 ] ( http://www.mouser.com/productdetail/micrel/mic5891yn/?qs=sgaepimzzmu2qtormdj1%2fvllxdedrurd%2fyv0%252b3uckjq%3d ) or [ mic2981 ] ( http://www.mouser.com/productdetail/micrel/mic2981-82yn/?qs=kh6ioki%2fele8friwbxds5g%3d%3d ) which are more expensive . 
   without writing any code for the actual arduino, 
  what do you mean by that ? 
  without any code arduino does nothing - the only thing you can control at this point is reset . 
  figure out what you need or what would be `` nice to have '' and do it ...  if you are good with mechanics , perhaps something like automated trash can . 
   we wo n't have a choice but to drink hormone laden milk ? 
  i 'm in us and do n't drink `` hormone laden milk '' but you `` wo n't have a choice !!! '', 
   dairies that make milk without hormones are put out of business, 
  that can only happen when you ** chose ** to drink `` hormone laden milk '' ... 
  you could , conceivably , store a short voice message in arduino , but the playback is going to be crappy . 
  i think you 'd be better off hooking up an mp3 player to the transmitter directly . 
   should n't one resistor one each of the common cathodes be enough ? 
  that would change the brightness depending on the digit displayed . 
  let 's say the resistor limits the current to 40 ma - for ' 1 ' two leds are going to split the current , each getting ( approximately ) 20 ma . 
  for ' 8 ' it 's gon na be seven leds ... 
   using pwm would require 4-wire fans, 
  why ? 
  you could still just pwm the fan 's power ... 
   either participate in the market or remove yourself from society , right ? 
  nope . 
  you can set up a commune if you wish . 
  or a syndicalist factory . 
  or whatever the hell you like , as long as you are n't forcing anyone to participate ... 
  i guess you have n't read it ... 
   the lipo will obviously not work with nano nor pro mini 5v . 
  nothing obvious about that . 
  you can still connect lipo to the vcc and it should work fine . 
   what you mean by `` high trust . '', 
  it 's a neo-reactionary buzzword they throw around when they realize their arguments are not rational ... , 
  did you set the current limit on the a4988 ? 
  if not you are probably drawing too much current they can handle . 
  pololu has a [ video ] ( https://youtu.be/89bhs9hfsuk ) explaining how to do it . 
  did n't watch the video ( at work ) but he is not entirely wrong . 
  decreasing supply causes a rise in price , which causes decrease in demand ... 
   i dont see why the labor theory of value cant coexist with subjective value ? 
  how ? 
  ltv assumes there is an objective value and it 's somehow related to labor . 
  since all values are subjective there 's really no way to tie it to labor - it takes so much labor to make a trinket , how can its value be subjective then ? 
   as long as the amount of money coming in the front end of the pipe maintains a rough balance with the money paid out , the system can continue forever . 
  there is no unsustainable progression driving the mechanism of a pay-as-you-go pension system and so it is not a pyramid or ponzi scheme . 
  well , they are almost right . 
  almost . 
  unfortunately , the people are not keen on dying as young as their grandfathers did . 
  and they are not as `` fruitful '' and do n't `` multiply '' as much . 
  at least those who pay taxes do n't ... 
  so , still a ponzi even though not quite exponential . 
  funny you mention that - majority of the classical liberal thinkers happened to be jews ... 
   if we need to fight the terrorists then we should get forces together and completely destroy them,

  if you use the adc , it 's beneficial to put an lc filter on avcc, 
  what do you think does n't make sense in the midi example ? 
   lack of incentives has never been a real problem . 
  how can someone be so removed from reality ? 
  if it were n't for the paycheck , why would anyone show up at work ? 
  there was always a `` paycheck '' - even if it was just a sack of grain or the loaf of bread ... 
  you mean i can quit my job and start relying on you for paying my bills ? 
  somehow i doubt your sincerity ... 
  technically , everything is possible . 
  as / u/bal00 says , what might be quite easy for detecting sharp sound spikes , would be much more complicated for detecting low level sound . 
  if you have lots of microphones what you could do is make kinda `` fans '' of directional ones . 
  for each `` fan '' you could establish direction by picking the loudest one , and then triangulate between fans .

  why terminal strip ? 
  if you are using a breadboard , each row has several connections . 
  not really . 
  you could read the machine code from the chip and then disassemble it . 
  but i doubt it would really help you . 
   there 's not much point in messing with shift registers or input multiplexers to get more i/o . 
  there 's still an educational value in that ... , 
   maybe the 3.3 v linear regulator on chinese clone pro mini ??? 
  the mini will always draw some current - your best bet would be to go bare chip , possibly without the external crystal . 
  hmm . . guess they should let him mingle with the rest - perhaps someone will solve the issue permanently .

  take a look at [ stubby ] ( http://stubby.digitalcave.ca/stubby/ ) ... 
  when you initialize an array the ** values ** of tb1 and tb2 ** at the time of initialization ** are being put in it , not the variables themselves . 
  i 'm not sure what is it exactly that you want to achieve . 
  making an array of pointers would be wasteful , but you could make the tb1 and tb2 pointers ( or references ) and point them inside the array , yes . 
  there 's no way anybody can figure out what the problem is without you posting the code and the schematic ... 
  does pissing on / u/wilfra 's head violate the tax code ?
