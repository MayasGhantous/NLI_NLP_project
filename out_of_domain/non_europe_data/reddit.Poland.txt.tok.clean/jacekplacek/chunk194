   i do n't think i can join, 
  what makes you think anybody wants you to join ? 
  what is your goal ? 
  something like this :, 
  char text [ ] = `` hello world '' ;, 
  bool isset ( size_t pos ) / / pos is a position of the bit in the text, 
  / / the last 3 bits of pos index the bit in a byte, 
  return text [ pos   3 ] & masks [ pos & 7 ] ; / / divide pos by 8 to get the correct byte and test corresponding bit, 
  / / in your loop use isset to determine if the led should be pulsed, 
   now , it 's not common to have whole statements in a #define but there 's nothing really wrong with it . 
  the compiler does n't care . 
  compiler does n't , someone reading the code most definitely will ... 
  if the author can not absolutely refrain from using macros , at the very least ( s ) he should make it more readable . 
   iateabyte gets 1 byte allocated on the stack , the memory usage is 1 byte, 
  little bit worse than that . 
  function call needs to put the return address on the stack as well . 
  and any registers it happens to use . 
   interest rates are already set by the market . 
  you are technically right ... like a dude who answers a lost driver 's question `` where am i ? '', 
  with `` in a car . '', 
  that 's because , even though technically correct , you do n't contribute anything to the discussion ... 
  definitely bernie . 
  he would , most likely , bankrupt the government - leading to the collapse of the us . 
  you might try to remember fdr ... 
  wilfra , baby - you do n't know shit about somalia , do you . 
  as a matter of fact , since somalis got rid of their government their situation vastly improved . 
  the current problems they are having are the effect of other countries ( including the ole usofa ) trying to meddle in their affairs . 
  i 'm pretty sure it would vastly improve over the current state pretty fast . 
  and utopias exist only in delusional statists ' minds ... 
  since i already have said it would vastly improve , your question would only make sense if you believe `` 3rd world '' status would be an improvement ... 
  / u/wilfra calling someone a troll !, 
  that 's rich . 
  you could use dacs - either external ones or the internal in , ferinstance , atxmega ... 
  but i doubt that 's what you want to hear , 
  you already know how to isp . 
  what do you need a bootloader for ? 
  yes . 
  see / u/danroad 's comment ... 
   otherwise , by default , the compiler will treat it as an array of floating point numbers, 
  nope . 
   '' \u00bac '' the degrees sign would show up as two black diamonds with question marks inside . 
  why is that ? 
  is there a way to circumvent it ? 
  mismatch between transmitter and receiver encoding . 
  degree sign is not in standard ascii , it gets interpreted differently with different encodings . 
   will running my arduino uno or mega on a 9v power source ruin the board ? 
  can it handle that voltage ? 
  yes , when connected to the barrel connector - it goes through the voltage regulator then . 
  your point being ? 
   could n't the off brand just use the exact name and design of the name brand ? 
  that would be fraud . 
  not against the original brand but against the customer . 
   if that is how polish diaspora looks like, 
  nope . 
  op is just another sjw - they come from every ethnic group . 
  dude , how 's your attempt at creating your low self-esteem boosting myths , relating to this sub-reddit ? 
  is n't there some place on the internet you guys could mutually masturbate yourself without boring us to death ? 
  so what ? 
  you have no reasoning ability and have to rely on the opinions of others ? 
  are n't they supposed to be armed already ? 
  ok , so you ( somehow , by your psychic abilities ? ), 
  know the dude has some information . 
  if it 's ok to torture him to save `` many '' innocent people why not to save `` not too many ? '', 
  two ? 
  one ? 
  what about the 50 % chance to save many ? 
  1 % to save one ? 
  what if you are not 100 % sure he 's got the information ? 
  is 50 % enough ? 
   the ultimate , 6,000-year origin of western individualism is irrelevant ? 
  the ** myth ** of the origin of western individualism is irrelevant . 
  edit : btw , do n't you find certain irony in making a collectivist argument for the origin of the individualism ? 
   just saying , `` well , you do n't really know that , '' is kid 's table stuff . 
  it 's not that `` you do n't really know that , '' it 's that you should have known better . 
  your `` warrior individualists '' were not the motor of the industrial revolution , quite the contrary - they had nothing but scorn for the lowly _ bourgeoisie _ , the real makers . 
  it 's not a coincidence the industrial revolution started in uk , the first country the `` aristos '' got their arses kicked hard by the brewers and bakers ... 
   collectivism and individualism is a false dichotomy, 
  make up your mind - is the individualism the reason for the western civilization or is it `` a false dichotomy ? '', 
  * whom, 
  of course he was . 
  all ( successful ) politicians are . 
   what you are describing lends itself to having a real operating system . 
  like killing a fly needs a howitzer ... , 
   the prices look good for canada, 
  ... for a very unorthodox definition of `` good '' ... 
  dtmf tones peak at 1633 hz , should be ok . 
  that 's why you want to buy from [ china ] ( http://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catid=0&amp;initiative_id=sb_20160107094741&amp;searchtext=arduino ) ... 
  < shrug /  whatever tickles your fancy ... 
  as other suggested , get the nanos and ** give ** them out to the kids . 
  they will be much less likely to fry them it they are theirs to keep ... 
  you need pull up/down resistor . 
  without it the pin is `` floating '' and anything can change its state . 
  l298n ** is ** a h-bridge ... 
   the language the arduino is programmed in is called `` processing '' and it 's a java derivative . 
  nope . 
  it 's just a bunch of libraries on top of c++ . 
  has nothing to do with java . 
  op would have a pretty hard time stuffing them into 2 '' tube ... , 
  will [ this one ] ( http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/gp2y0a51sk0f/425-2854-nd/4103863 ) do ? 
  perhaps in your ( or library ? ),
