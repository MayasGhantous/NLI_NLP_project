  code there are wrong assumptions about the pins . . 
   they should use drug pigs instead, 
  they already do ... oh , wait , you mean the actual _ sus scrofa domesticus _ pigs ... , 
  ... at least in theory ... 
  this one is optical , not ultrasonic - you should be good . 
   so you have a remote for the fan ? 
  did n't he just say so ? 
  you could solder the mosfets to the buttons ' contacts and connect their gates to the arduino pins ... 
  the remote 's circuit already has all the pull down/up resistors needed , and you can not just connect the arduino pin to the button 's contacts ( without knowing in detail the remote circuit . ), 
  basically , what the button is doing is shorting the contacts . 
  that 's why i suggested mosfets - when they are in the off state they act ( pretty much ) like insulators . 
  in the on state they act like conductors . 
  soldering the source and drain to the button contacts and supplying the signal from arduino to the gate would allow you to switch them on and off . 
  and yes , you need a common ground between arduino and the remote . 
  also make sure you supply correct voltage to the mosfet 's gate . 
  led drivers are usually a little bit easier to use for driving leds/7 segs . 
  shift registers are more universal - it 's a good idea to learn how to use them even if you eventually end up using the dedicated drivers ... 
   if that is the case , there is nothing i can do . 
  there 's ** always ** [ something you can do ] ( http://tronixstuff.com/2011/08/26/tutorial-maximising-your-arduinos-io-ports/ ) ... , 
   you 're missing the point . 
  methinks he is making exactly the same point ... 
   so the issue with voluntary slavery is what if someone who sold themselves into slavery changes their mind a few years down the road ? 
  then he is no longer a slave . 
  the `` master '' can try to sue for damages , though ... 
  mosi/miso/sck tied together , separate ss for each slave with only one active at the time . 
   the slave does not have the right, 
  what does it even mean ? 
  if the `` slave '' decides to walk away , you think you have a `` right '' to use force to keep him ? 
  i 've looked at the board - there 's no mosi , and cs is ss . 
  arduino is the master , so you connect miso on arduino to do 's on slaves and separate pin on arduino for each slave cs . 
  you also need to tie all the clock lines together . 
   without him , we would not have had generic programming as we know it and c++ would have been a very different and poorer language . 
  not to take away the accomplishments from alex , but i really dislike statements like that . 
  alex was n't the only person in the world working on generic programming concepts and it 's a fallacy to assume noone else would do it ... 
  that seems to be correct . 
  make sure you do n't activate more than one slave at the time . 
  ( cs is `` active low '' ), 
   commies are always saying that the laborers ( of the physical kind ) are the ones that are having their surplus labor expropriated ( by people doing mental labor ), 
  that 's not entirely correct . 
  they believe the owners of the capital are the exploiters and the laborers , either physical or mental , are the exploitees . 
  which yields the humorous conclusion that the poor shmuck who put his savings into a mutual fund is the evil exploiter while the ceo is one of the exploitees ... , 
   time to try stmicroelectronics . 
  they have really nice 32 bit arm chips for cheap . 
  and you can get minimum development boards for $ 3 . 
  but setting up a programming environment is a real pain in the neck ... 
  no , no , no ... 
  he is taking from ( his ) right and giving to ( his ) left . 
  he 's a damn commie , 
  just the quick look at the code - did n't spot anything obviously wrong . 
  one note , though - you could set the duration array with the actual duration values and avoid division inside the loop . 
  also , the way you wrote it , if you press both buttons only the first melody will play , not sure if that was your intent . 
  the problem , most likely , lies in the circuit - not seeing it i 'm guessing you did n't pull the button pin up or down , leaving it in the `` floating '' state . 
  this makes it change the state on almost any input , no matter how small . 
  even the tiny amount of static when you hold your hand close by ... 
   a lot easier if you run both as i2 c devices, 
  only if they have configurable addresses ... which might not be the case . 
   you need the processing power of a raspberry pi to do anything with the data .

   i see people talking about taking their at chip and then wiring it up manually with whatever components they need after they 've proto 'd it on their arduino . 
  what ? 
  how do you even know what pieces of the puzzle you need ? 
  that 's the easiest part  atmega328 does n't really need any external components to work ( with a possible exception of the decoupling capacitor between vcc and ground ) having an internal 8mhz clock .

  i could n't spot a single floating point in op 's post ... 
  are you nuts ? 
  depending on the motor and the adapter ... make sure your adapter can supply enough current to drive the motor . 
  if you need to ask , the most likely answer is `` no '' , 
  an [ opamp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operational_amplifier ) is a ** voltage amplifier ** , there 's no way it can supply enough current to drive a motor . 
  besides , if you already have a 12v supply what did you think the opamp would do ?

  why do you think you need a bootloader ? 
  you already know how to do isp , just use it to burn in your sketches ... 
   there is also a 5v regulator to take the 9v down to 5v, 
  does n't pro mini already have a regulator ?

  just measure your stuff , find out how much room you need in all three dimensions and pick the box accordingly ... 
   do n't know what voltage, 
  lipo batteries are all 3.7 v ( nominal , actual voltage somewhere between 3.0 and 4.2 , ) unless you get into battery banks , like the ones for laptops ...
