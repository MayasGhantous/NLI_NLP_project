  twoambien back in the alexander fleming 's days _, 
  you have a point ? 
  salvation army seems to do the best job ... 
   i 'm damn proud to be an australian, 
  did you choose it or were you born into it ? 
  those are very good reasons to like it , where does the pride get into it ? 
  i can understand being proud of your accomplishments , but being proud of something you had nothing to do with ? 
  they are all fascists ... 
  according to barnardos ? 
   aside from the fact that you have to attend their religious services to qualify for their `` help '' . 
  not in the us ... 
   most of the money goes into their own pockets, 
  [ charity report ] ( http://www.give.org/charity-reviews/national/religious/salvation-army-national-corporation-in-alexandria-va-1221 ), 
  never said ancap does n't have flaws , it 's basically statist doctrine trying to keep the statist paradigms but without the state . 
  so , it has some of the same flaws the unabashedly statist doctrines have . 
  just to much lesser degree ... 
   you guys, 
  i 'm not an ancap . 
  and i do n't delude myself the perfection is possible . 
   salvation army is not a charity , they are a business, 
  [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_salvation_army] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_salvation_army ), 
  you really believe sense can beat hurrah-patriotism ... ? 
   i do n't care about unemployed tomato farmers . 
  they should switch to the better strains of _ cannabis sativa _ or _ cannabis indica _ anyway ... , 
   it 's best not to overwhelm a beginner . 
  that 's why i said `` still good enough for most hobbyists . '', 
  do you have an [ lc filter ] ( http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=51557.0 ) on your avcc ? 
  that 's the reading he is getting from the voltage divider , 2v is about right ... 
  why do you think it 's `` ridiculous ? '', 
  electrons are not the only current carriers - in an electrolyte or vacuum tube it 's the ions , both positive and negative ... 
   ( and would hope reasonable deterrents are in place to punish those who have not exemplified that they have the knowledge and ability to pilot a vehicle ) . 
  kinda funny , somehow the people were able to ride a horse/carriage in the olden days without the gubmint license and the world did not collapse . 
  imagine that !, 
  hell , they could even pilot the huge steamships without the license !, 
   the dros and colas racs describe hardly differ from states, 
  yup . 
  they still have n't outgrown the statist mindset . 
  i do n't really dwell on it since , if there ever stateless society develops , they will soon realize it 's foolishness to insist on keeping statist paradigms . 
  the dro 's will go bankrupt due to the very low demand ... 
  what is n't what ? 
  and , no , i do n't know it . 
   retarded . 
  yup . 
  the idea of dros is retarded indeed . 
  and i 'm pretty sure rothbard was well aware of that - he introduced the idea to make sure the mundanes would n't scare too much ... , 
   and if they went bankrupt by lack of demand , it would be a good thing, 
  sure . 
  that 's my point . 
   your 5.3 v is i think too high to run correctly, 
  nope . 
  atmega328p is rated up to 5.5 v and really can easily handle a little bit more . 
  you might get some luck with parallel adc [ something like this ] ( http://www.mouser.com/productdetail/analog-devices/ad9215bcpz-65/?qs=sgaepimzzmvtvdtv69d2qgydpjm2vkabwrhbhgfhtse%3d ), 
  you still need to handle the data and at 2 mhz you have only about 8 instructions max to do it with ... 
  in something like e4 - e5 - nf3 ... , 
  the current from the motor when switched off goes the ** opposite ** direction , the diode is grounding it , protecting the transistor . 
  the circuit is correct . 
  you could power it directly from the lipo ( through the 5v pin , not the jack . ), 
  even though 328 is not rated for 3.7 v at 16 mhz , it still tends to work fine . 
  aliexpress.com , 
   the avr dragon is an avr programmer , so you can not use it to program a sam arm . 
  not true . 
  it works well with most of atmel mcs , including sams . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flyback_diode#working_principle ) to the rescue ... , 
  from the article :, 
   an extremely large negative potential is created where there once was positive potential , and a positive potential is created where there was once negative potential . 
  why would transistor being part of the h-bridge be different than a single switching transistor ? 
   you can use digitalwrite ( ) ; and this has a way less steep learning curve than portb | = ( 1 < < a ) ; agree ? 
  except that you are ** not ** learning anything with digitalwrite ... 
  [ like this ? 
  ] ( https://www.arduino.cc/en/tutorial/stringtointexample ), 
  the catch - you have to send numbers in your text ... 
  why ? 
  it seems like much more effective and economical alternative to a subscription to a dro , ancaps are so enamored with ... 
  speakers/microphones are probably the only realistically feasible parts to scavenge ... cameras/screens - arduino does n't have enough oomph to drive them , not to mention you would have a very hard time figuring them out . 
  putain ? 
  _ i 'll see myself out ... _, 
   that 's exactly what restaurants do in europe, 
  yup . 
  and the servers there do n't even try to be nice ... 
   other option is to just use a mosfet for each output . 
  this makes thing a little more crowded for the wiring , but is safer . 
  it does capture the essence of the state well though ... 
  dunno about that ... they are mildly amusing . 
   wow so many haters on here !!!, 
  haters ? 
  where ? 
  let 's concentrate on the income tax . 
  canada did n't have one before the wwi and instituted it to `` pay off the war debts . '', 
  and you suckers are still paying ... 
  so , riddle me this - what great `` services , '' worth giving up half of your paycheck , are you getting from your government ( s ) your ( great ) grandfather did not ? 
  are you saying there were no roads , hospitals or fire departments before the wwi ? 
   you ca n't coerce people, 
  ... and yet you want to do just that - coerce someone to perform a service ( s ) he does n't like to perform ... 
  does bridge count ? 
  you mean berlin wall 's purpose was to keep people in and trump wall 's purpose it to keep people out ? 
  actually any wall will keep people both in and out ... ** stated ** purpose notwithstanding . 
  fyi the ** stated ** purpose of the berlin wall was to keep the western spies/saboteurs out . 
   you think trump would officially state he is preventing people from leaving ? 
  ftfy, 
  perhaps not too many people now , wait till the us goes full monty with the police state ... the wall will conveniently be there .
