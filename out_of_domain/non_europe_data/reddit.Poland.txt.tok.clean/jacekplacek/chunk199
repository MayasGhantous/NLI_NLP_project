   * `` believe that large drop in atmel revenue in march quarter is likely result of an inventory correction in distribution channel '',

  hmm ... 
  i was drinking my morning coffee when i read that and spilled it on my laptop . 
  does it mean you can take it or does it mean you caused the damage and i have a claim on yours ?

   only corporations have the ability to pay taxes on profits instead of revenues, 
  if you start buying lot of stuff on , let 's say , aliexpress and sell it on e-bay you are n't going to get taxed on your revenue , only on your profit ... revenue is not the same as income .

   does this make a voluntary donation on your part ? 
  yes . 
  in the same way google asking me where to donate money they want to donate , makes the donation voluntary ...

  yes .

  yup .

  why are the left-wing morons ( or am i being redundant ? ), 
  so hell bent on spamming this subreddit ? 
  are they being paid for it or something ? 
  only black lives ? 
  that 's a bromide ( with no actual meaning ) offered by a president responsible for more americans ' deaths than any foreign tyrant . 
  he neglected to mention that the three groups of `` people '' are not the same . 
  the closest to the actual american ideals is perhaps :, 
  `` we hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights , that among these are life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . 
  that to secure these rights , governments are instituted among men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed , that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new government , laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness . '', 
  perhaps you should read it then . 
  that was from the declaration of independence , not the constitution ... 
  well , if there is an implicit `` too '' perhaps you should make it explicit . 
  `` blm '' implies `` only '' black people are victims of police brutality/extralegal killing , which is not the case . 
  the message you are sending is `` it would be ok to brutalize/kill someone if they were not black . '', 
  well , since it appears that in canada the majority of police shooting victims are not black , the blm are explicitly creating a different standard for black victims ... 
  it does n't imply `` too '' either , you are inferring something to match your own personal belief . 
   call it whatever the fuck you want but we need it . 
  when the ** government ** charges you with a crime , it 's ** government ** 's responsibility to provide you with a legal counsel . 
  it 's not a ** service ** - if they do n't feel like paying for your defense they can always drop the charges . 
   bubble sorting is the very commonly and widely used sorting technique in c++ programming . 
  you are kidding , right ? 
  hmm ... 
  the arguments appear to be pretty much the same , the difference being back then :,

  just google [ `` linux avr programming '' ] ( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=utf-8#q=linux%20avr%20programming ) , plenty of hits ... 
   i have my favourite general purpose transistor, 
  do tell ... 
  so , why did you even bring the kiddie porn up ? 
   i am not sure why a rigorous math get so many hostility, 
  it 's not a `` rigorous math '' to say 5x3 ! = 3x5 , quite the opposite, 
   5 x 3 is the same as writing 5 ( 3 ) , which is 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 . 
  i do n't know where you learned your math but you should ask for a refund if you had to pay for it ... 
  by the [ definition of natural numbers multiplication ] ( https://proofwiki.org/wiki/definition:multiplication/natural_numbers#multiplication_in_terms_of_addition ) 5x3 = ( 5x2 ) + 5 = ( 5 + 5 ) + 5 = 5 + 5 + 5 . 
  the student was right , the teacher is a dumbass ... 
   when a teacher presents one and asks for applications , they usually have a reason for doing so , even if the students ( or their parents , or people on the internet ) do n't understand why, 
  iow , `` do n't think for yourself , do as i said . '', 
  since ** both ** answers are correct , the teacher is an idiot . 
   i did n't pay anything for my math degree , thanks , it was a full ride scholarship . 
  well , it was still wasted time . 
  any math degree that lets you believe 5x3 ! = 3x5 is not worth the paper it 's printed on . 
  the task was phrased as `` use the repeated addition strategy to solve : 5x3 . '',
