  so , you prefer bolt-action rifle for hunting ( or shotgun ) therefore everybody else has to conform to your taste ... swell !, 
  you might want to take a look at [ this ] ( http://www.gunsandammomag.com/long_guns/phar_022707/ ), 
  well , before your edit you said you wanted one particular laptop ... and it 's not true that - every - laptop maker uses windoze ... 
  afaik dell will refund you windoze price if you want to install linux, 
  besides it 's laptop makers ' decision to pre-install windoze , so i do n't see why you 're blaming gates . 
  hell , they have eternity to train them ... , 
  you remaind me of that soviet dude who was sure everybody would starve if state did n't run bakeries ... 
  the question is : can it deflect .357 mag ? 
   `` a message has been communicated to anyone who wants to speak out against the kremlin : ` if you do , no matter who you are , where you are , we will find you , and we will silence you -- in the most horrible way possible , ' '' joyal said . 
  obviously , monumental slander like this could n't be left without response ... < / sarcasm , 
  unless they want to make a point ... 
  dunno , if it takes me more than 2 hours ... 
  and then we 'll get another bunch ... what happened to the old american custom of tarring and feathering ? 
  huh ? 
  so the guy makes an argument against one dogma , you observe that the same argument could be used against another dogma therefore it must be a hack ... you should become a politician , 
  be afraid , be very afraid ... 
  who 's talking about libby ... 
  no , it only confirms nobody switched _ her _ sample ... 
   why exactly do you think that you will know how to behave in an extreme situation ? 
  i do n't , i still want to have the option ... 
   why do you think that you will do that better than the criminal ? 
  i do n't . 
  i still want the chance to try ... 
   pulling a gun on a criminal is a sure way to get killed . 
  so , all policemen who try to apprehend one get killed ... ?!, 
  you do n't want to defend your life - fine it 's your choice , nothing wrong with that . 
  just do n't force your ways on the rest of us . 
  can you back this up , or are you making up your `` statistics '' as you go ? 
  because nobody should be convicted on the eyewitness testimony alone . 
  period . 
  why ? 
  liberals make plenty fine nazis ... 
  and repugnicans are not that far from communists either . 
  [ this one ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/newfound_lake ) is n't chlorinated either ... , 
  our laws put dudes who smoke weed in jails , where they are often raped and assaulted by other inmates and/or guards . 
  is it any less barbaric ? 
  heck , 100 lashes - you can get over it in a month or two , so it 's much less barbaric than twenty years in jail . 
  btw i certainly do n't condone islamic so called `` justice '' just want to point out that our so called `` justice '' is n't any better ... 
  so , it 's ok to shoot and bomb people , it 's gassing that makes it wrong ... < / sarcasm , 
  sure . 
  nevertheless you said : `` our standards are superior '', 
  that 's what i have an objection to , 
  criminals who , faced with armed resistance , try to disarm their victims have very short life expectancy ... 
  i do n't have to , i 'm pretty much sure i know where it came from - google `` kellerman study '' - you might learn something . 
  i doubt you will like it , though ... , 
  even if kellerman was n't a hack and his study was beyond reproach , framing the argument as `` shot , vs shooting the perp '' is still bogus . 
  simply displaying the gun is a powerful deterrent to any would be criminal . 
  in most cases of defensive use of a gun all it takes to prevent a crime is to show it . 
  it 's a joke ... 
  iow you do n't have any evidence , just your hoplophobia ... lol, 
  and why this obsession with dicks ? 
  believe me , firearms and penises have absolutely nothing in common . 
  btw there 's about 2.5 million defensive firearm uses a year in us [ link ] ( http://www.gunsandcrime.org/dgufreq.html ) and about 30 thousand firearm deaths [ link ] ( http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/glance/tables/frmdth.htm ), 
  so your `` statistics '' are quite obviously bogus whenever they came from . 
  but i know you 're not going to change your mind - you 're to damn scared of those things and they look like dicks to you ... lol, 
  no , officer , you are supposed to go and find some physical evidence ... you know do some actual working for a change . 
  any particular beef with the reaserch ? 
  you think you can critique their scholarship ? 
  or just you do n't respect people who have diffrent oppinions than you , even if they can back it up with evidence and you can not ... lol, 
  you mean real football or rugby for sissies ... < g.d & r , 
  you mean sheep vote for wolves and then wolves decide what to have for dinner ... 
  huh ? 
  sure , `` order '' being an operative word ... ( as in `` being ordered around ), 
  so , you mean when the reconquista happens , you 'll be happy to know `` there is a north american state , it 's name is canada ... '', 
  at least you admit you worship satan and molest todlers ... lol neocons are so funny ... 
  like dershowitz ... 
  is it ok for politicians with _ their _ agendas to fund agenda-driven `` science '' ? 
  heck , if they can scare you with `` global < insert calamity of the day  '' you gon na beg them to get more power and save you ... 
  consensus has nothing to do with science , geocentric theory had a consensus among middle ages scientist ... ( and backing by the church did n't hurt either . ), 
  oh , so politicians are noble civil servants , care only for the good of the mankind and do n't have their own agendas ... 
  and there is a santa claus . 
  he was clueless before , he is clueless now ... 
  you pay scientists to find problem , they gon na find problem ... and yes algor is as corrupt as cheney and rummy, 
  no , meds are ok - ( pharma ) scientists are paid to find cures , that 's what they 're finding . 
  but ... but ... but ... it 's a heresy !, 
  everybody knows gospell of st. algor is the ultimate and the only truth !, 
  you do n't need no stinking proof , just show the heretic for the satan worshipper he is . 
  burn him ... !, 
  you have no bloody idea what you 're whispering about ... , 
  hillary the conspiracy theorist ... , 
  do you think ibm ( or ig farben ) were blameless when they aided nazi government in persecuting jews ? 
  i 'm not sure the perp qualifies as a human being ... some specimen of homo sapiens just `` need killing . '', 
  do you think it 's such a stretch ? 
  every state `` takes the law in their own hands ... '', 
  you sure this is supposed to go in this thread ... ?? 
  you 're missing the point , richard . 
  let 's see , communist china murdered many more people than nazi germany . 
  just because the ideology was `` completely different '' does it make it ok ? 
  btw , nazis murdered not only jews ... 
  the point is that _ every _ state , be it germany , china , or zimbabwe _ by definition _ `` takes the law in their own hand . '', 
  now , depending on your view of the usa you might argue that so should the southern ( and northern ) states ( that was the original intent ) or you might argue it should be the federal government ( this is closer to the situation now . ), 
  you seem to imply that the southern states should n't be allowed what other states have by definition . 
  presumably because you find some of the laws that were in effect there some time ago highly offensive . 
  ca n't disagree with you on that but the laws of other countries can be unjust , barbaric , you name it ... 
  including the us of a. . . 
  have you ? 
  so , direct experience is the only valid cognitive method ... ? 
  nope . 
  it was ( thank you ) * 4, 
  hmm . . that does not necessary mean atheist are moral - they might be completely immoral bunch but too smart to get caught ... ,
