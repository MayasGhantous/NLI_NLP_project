  that 's what the student did . 
  nothing in the question says anything about `` identical '' or `` equal . '', 
  and , since neither answer is `` identical '' to the `` 5x3 '' i assume you bring it up only to confuse readers ... 
  anytime you defend the notion that 5x3 ! = 5 + 5 + 5 ... 
  anytime you defend the teacher 's marking the answer to `` 5x3 '' being `` 5 +5 +5 '' as incorrect ... 
   giving segmentation fault teaches me the same !, 
  nope . 
  segfault teaches you you have fucked up , has nothing to do with bjarne or even the c++ standard, 
   c++ may be the worst choice for first language in the short history of computing, 
  you 've been trolled ... 
  1234 is not a valid identifier ... 
  you mean trudeau paid off their debts , got them decent paying jobs and the downpayment on a house ? 
   `` math people '' use a symbol which looks similar to \\ ^ . 
  you mean the cia bought out all the toilet paper ? 
  and all the beer ? 
  bastards !, 
   since the arduino language is not the full c++ anyway, 
  yes , it is . 
  does n't mean it 's not `` full c++ '' ... actually there 's no such thing as `` arduino language '' - it is c++ and bunch of libraries . 
  it seems op wants it the other way around - he wants to replace pots with arduino ... 
  yeah , that 's what libertarian party needs - more neocons ... / s, 
  does n't seem like neocons are all that favorite with the voters - perhaps lp should embrace trumpism-sandersism , that 's where the votes are !, 
  there 's a difference between `` looking for purity '' and not embracing outright fascists/communists, 
  `` for what is a man profited , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ? '', 
  not sure about that . 
  you have to remember - bunch of trotskyites and straussians managed to pretty much take over the republican party and change it from basically conservative to more or less p, 
  `` progressive '' ... now they are switching to lp , you sure they will not pull the same schtick ? 
  sure , there 's plenty of libertarian leaning republicans and i have no beef with them switching to lp . 
  but mary-fucking-matalin ??? 
  sure . 
  you can use it to talk between aduino and raspi . 
  either directly in case of 3.3 v arduino or with level converter like [ this ] ( https://www.adafruit.com/product/395 ) ... 
  you probably wanted to say `` brewtime ** = ** 16000 '' not '' = = '', 
  other than that see comment of / u/galorin, 
  yes . 
  '' = = '' is an equality operator it returns true when both sides are equal and false otherwise , '' = '' is an assignment operator . 
  c # strings are stored as 16 bit wide characters , try :, 
  and send the bytes instead . 
  you are n't gon na get any decent battery life from arduino - i would suggest going bare chip or something like [ bareduino ] ( https://www.virtuabotix.com/product-bareduino328-barebones-microcontroller-guide/ ) and for wifi esp8266 which you want to keep off until you need to send an alarm . 
  also you would just check the sensor every so often and sleep between checks . 
  or you could follow / u/012673 's advice and just go with esp8266 alone , although i have no idea how good it is at conserving the battery ... 
   right now i am using a hd webcam, 
  you made me curious how did you manage to do any image processing with arduino ... 
  if you want to stick to the webcam you need something with much more processing power , perhaps raspi ? 
  you might want to take a look at [ opencv ] ( http://opencv.org/ ) and with consistent distance from camera , lighting and object orientation you should be able to get a decent measurement ... 
   there are definitely things that statist societies do better : capture economies of scale , deter negative externalities and a couple other things . 
  _ [ citation needed ] _, 
   worse economies of scale, 
  what does it mean ? 
  are you saying the monopoly can not be less efficient than competing companies ? 
  looks to me that in the real world it is just the opposite ... 
  `` people are herd animals , they do n't desire freedom they desire competent alpha who will tell them what to do . '', 
  counterargument : small part of us are born `` lone wolves , '' you force us at your own peril ... 
   infrastructural redundancy, 
  there 's a severe `` infrastructural redundancy '' with gas stations , grocery stores , car dealerships , you name it . 
  what is your argument again ? 
  should n't government run everything to avoid `` infrastructural redundancy ? '', 
  alliterative aplenty ... 
  ftfy, 
  what is the type of ` message ' ? 
  if it 's a string you can not just cast it to uint8_t * ... 
   i would love to see how he explains what is going on now . 
  i bet you it 's cia ... , 
   `` developing hardware is just like developing software , except that every time you hit ` compile ' it takes weeks and costs thousands of dollars . '', 
   note : wireless charger pad only , you need another receiver which have to installed into your phone to make wireless charger work . 
  any idea how to make arduino to actually get the power ? 
   op was talking specifically about the dip package of the atmega328 microcontroller and so did i, 
  still , you are assuming his uno ( if he even has one ) is also dip . 
  not to mention the dip socket is not really meant for lots of insertions/removals - if you keep doing that , sooner or later , you will damage your uno ... 
   raw pointers are used when it is clear that its lifetime will surpass the context its being used at, 
  ... and sooner or later ( most likely sooner ) you will lose track of who owns what and who is responsible for deleting ... 
  string input = serial.readln ( ) ;, 
  crgb variable = input.toint ( ) ; / / assuming crgb is just typedef for long, 
  analogwrite ( variable ) ;, 
  no shit !, 
  surely , donald clinton is much better ... or is it hillary trump ? 
  i do n't know the library you are using but from the syntax ( crgb : : colorname ) it looks like it is an enum . 
  that was my assumption . 
  after googling the library this morning and the cursory glance , the type of variable should be long , not crgb . 
  also i assume you are sending the color 's numeric value over the serial , not the name as / u/danroad assumes . 
  with those assumptions , the second and third lines should be, 
  long variable = input.toint ( ) ;, 
  analogwritergb ( variable ) ;, 
  you want to extract the color numeric value from the string and pass it to the analogwritergb function . 
   will boolean operators be a good replacement for strcmp ? 
  only if you store both in string . 
  but what 's wrong with strcmp ? 
  powering ? 
  driving ? 
  yes . 
   the republicans need every vote . 
  then maybe they should n't pick a certified asshole and buffoon ... 
   i think if the house voted on abolishing income tax [ ... ] republicans would try really hard to pass it, 
  the last time i 've checked , repugnicans had both houses and if they really wanted to they already would . 
   now the `` libertarians '' ( at least , many in this sub ) believe that gays need to go back in the closet because of the poor cake bakers . 
  til , not forcing unwilling bakers to bake a cake = going back in the closet ... 
  i guess nobody ever snorts coke - it ** is ** barred by law in all 50 states plus dc ... 
   who cares about `` earning an electoral vote ? '', 
  are libertarians so accustomed to failure that they think that 's a big accomplishment ? 
  [ in this event , the house of representatives is limited to choosing from among the three candidates who received the most electoral votes .
