   the supreme court has held the opposite, 
  supreme court has been known to held some other ~ ~ disturbing ~ ~ fascist opinions too ... 
   i 'm talking about the train master . 
   what is the size of $ c000, 
  it 's 1 byte . 
  but i guess that 's not what you want to know ... 
  when you are asking about the size of memory , you need to specify a range ( like `` from $ a000 and ends in $ ffff '' ), 
  pro tip : open the windows calculator , set it to `` programmer '' mode , select ` hex ' , type in the end of the range , ' - ' sign and the beginning of the range , followed by the ` enter ' key . 
   you are forgetting that things like sewer and water systems are heavily subsidized . 
  so , perhaps the thugs in power should stop subsidizing shit ... 
   then armed gangsters will come to our house , kidnap me to put me in a cage for a long time , if i resist the gangsters , then i will be cold bloodedly murdered . 
  and you will be kidnapped as well and sent to a government child care institution that is full of pedophiles and they will molest you a lot . 
  unfortunately , if little jimmy ever mentions that in the very school he is forced to attend , all those things will still happen ... 
  yeah , dude . 
  we got you - comparing to anders breivik , omar mateen was `` one of the most thoughtful , peaceful , and violent-avoiding terrorists we could possibly have in this nation right now . '', 
  dunno , since everything else he paid for has already been taxed on multiple levels , he 's still overpaid ... 
  afraid she might go for it ? 
   it is the involuntary and coercive exclusion of others from the usage of things . 
  good , man . 
  if someone wanted to fuck you up your ass , you would n't `` coercively exclude him from it , '' would you . 
   2 +2 is fucking four, 
  ... which only proves you know so little about math as about economics ... or anything else , for that matter . 
  pro tip : what 's 2 +2 in modulo 4 additive group ? 
  somehow i 'm not surprised your understanding of the math boils down to marbles . 
   you 're blocked . 
  thanks goodness ... , 
  volatile long time [ 1 ] ;, 
  that 's just the one cell in the array , ` time [ 0 ] ` is the only index you can use - in your code ` time [ 1 ] ` is pointing to invalid location . 
  also , it 's a very bad habit to use bool as an index ... 
  you update ` pulse ` only on the interrupt and print it many times in between in the loop , i 'm sure that 's not what you want, 
  have [ some of this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olanzapine ) , it will help you ... 
   in fact this exact same argument was used by the supreme court to allow the ban on short barreled ( sawed off ) shotguns based on the fact they were not used by militaries anywhere in the world , and the 2nd amendment was for military weapons to be used by the people to form their own militia citizen armies . 
  scotus : miller ( 1933 ) . 
  ... which , in fact , was incorrect . 
  short shotguns were quite frequently used in military . 
  problem with miller was the only side present was the government and nobody was there to argue the gun side ... 
   northern ireland will absolutely not be influenced to vote to become slave of the republic . 
  that 's not the only option - they could vote to become independent ... 
  why ? 
  is n't democracy supposed to give them any option they want ? 
   how rome in this period failed even after the aristocrats gained literal dictatorial powers and changed everything to their liking . 
  you do n't get it !, 
  those were n't ** real ** aristos ... , 
   feeling so fucking jealous of the tales of men making deals with handshakes and knowing their counterparty would follow through . 
  that 's still happening in the `` low trust '' middle east ... 
  how did you figure out you need to get offended ? 
  you sure there 's no paranoia on top of the schizophrenia ? 
  it 's a good book if you want to learn c. absolutely not good if your goal is c++ . 
  c and c++ are ** very different ** languages and learning c first if you want to learn c++ will just give you bad habits . 
  there 's a good thread about that on [ stackoverflow ] ( http://stackoverflow.com/questions/388242/the-definitive-c-book-guide-and-list ) . 
   c and c++ are not very different languages . 
  yes , they are , subset of common syntax notwithstanding . 
  if you code in c++ like you would in c you are doing something very wrong . 
  a lot of perfectly valid c coding patterns are just bad c++ code ... 
  funny you say that - arduino itself is c++ and most of arduino libraries are as well ... 
  also known as [ dead bug prototyping ] ( http://www.instructables.com/id/dead-bug-prototyping-and-freeform-electronics/ ), 
  you are not very bright , are you . 
   i 'd go with an uno - super easy to set up and you can breadboard anything, 
  same goes for nano or ( to the lesser degree ) mini . 
   there is a better language than c++, 
  what 's your definition of `` better '' ? 
  hey !, 
  i am 60 years old and i did n't know aol was still a thing ... 
  donald the clown is the reason many people stopped taking gop seriously ... 
   you guys know by doing this you are ensuring a clinton presidency , right ? 
  assuming ( as a hypothetical ) it is true , why would we think it 's worse than donald the clown presidency ? 
   from assignments in class , we were only exposed to using eclipse to output words when we were dealing with object oriented programming like linked list ; it was pretty boring doing that . 
  well , there 's a good reason for that : it is easy for the beginners . 
  if you want to do any gui , you need to master some gui library , and most of them are quite complex . 
  you may take a look at [ nana ] ( http://nanapro.org/en-us/blog/2016/05/an-introduction-to-nana-c-library/ ) which seem to be relatively easy to start with . 
  who 's better to tell us than yourself ? 
   is this something that interests you ? 
  not really . 
   the origins of the alt right , which is almost entirely rooted in libertarians/ancaps becoming more right wing for a variety of reasons, 
  which always baffled me : ancaps are mostly individualistic , your bunch is very much collectivist . 
  how did you make this jump ? 
  ( question is rhetorical ), 
  i just do n't care enough , but perhaps others will , 
  still does n't explain how can you make a jump from the ( admittedly ) extreme individualism to outright collectivism . 
  lol ... do n't care much , still somehow curious what kind of excuse you can come up with , 
   keynesian economics ruins the world, 
  ftfy, 
   our software industry is flooded with cheap indian labor from abroad who are willing to work 60 hours a day for lower wages , is it fair to expect our people to compete at that price and those hours ? 
  is n't it a race to the bottom ? 
  interesting ... if you look at the [ mean annual salaries ] ( http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm ) it seems software industry is doing quite well , despite `` cheap indian labor . '', 
  do you ? 
  iow : `` be nice to the massah , obey his orders and you will not get flogged ? '', 
   no one is going to take your surly attitude with a smile, 
  most people will , maybe not with a smile but at least they will not shoot you . 
  the two , obvious , categories of those who are likely to shoot you for `` disrespect '' are gangstas and pigs . 
  or , perhaps , it 's really just one category ... 
  listen ossifer , we know you think of yourself as a `` more equal '' animal ( that means pig fyi ) but you are just a jackbooted thug . 
  i bet you were a dumb bully in the school and you have n't changed a bit since . 
  but you do need a [ programmer ] ( http://www.atmel.com/products/microcontrollers/avr/megaavr.aspx?tab=tools ) . 
   he 's calling for communal change . 
  i knew he was a communist !, 
  i do n't think explaining the joke would really help you ... 
   i 'll be taking a computer organization course in computer science where they use assembly , but does n't teach the language . 
  my motivation is that , i 'll be able to apply it in an arduino uno in a more , practical way ( like leds blinking ) .
