  you have to remember the assembly languages are different between different architectures . 
  still the concepts behind are mostly the same so it might work for you . 
  you could get the ( free ) atmelstudio for c++ programming of avr chips - it outputs the generated ( dis ) assembly , should be a good start to learn it . 
   johnson is not really a full libertarian, 
  guess i have to vote for hillary then !, 
   you need a start byte , a stop byte and whatever you need transmitted slipped in between the two . 
  that 's handled by the library/hardware . 
  putin seems to be pretty popular ... 
  \u266b `` send lawyers , guns and money '' \u266b, 
  better bet would be atmega1284, 
   c++ does not belong in the embedded world anyway . 
  you mean ** you ** do n't know how to use c++ effectively , so you believe `` it does n't belong . '', 
  only if you do n't know how to use c++ effectively . 
  on both counts . 
  btw , if you are willing to learn , there 's a pretty decent article on [ `` bare metal c++ '' ] ( https://arobenko.gitbooks.io/bare_metal_cpp/content/ ) ... 
  it 's free . 
  you mean obama is your massah ? 
  heil donald !, 
  how does the ( national ) border relate to property if government does n't own your ass ? 
   you are changing the subject . 
  no , i 'm not . 
  and yes , without governments there would be no borders . 
  private property line is no border . 
  even if you stretch the definition of the border , still you can disallow the mexican coming on your property but have no saying in me inviting him . 
   meaning of words . 
  if you bothered to follow the discussion , you would notice it 's specifically about the `` national '' borders . 
  or did you think it 's about '' a narrow bed of planted ground along the edge of a lawn or walk '' _ [ merriam-webster ] _, 
  i 'll take this as a concession that you are completely wrong . 
   you have no right to impose such costs on me and the commons . 
  sue me . 
  watch out . 
  your massah might whip you for such a language , instead of just fucking you . 
   we should censor those who would censor others . 
  ... then we should also censor ourselves ... 
  nope . 
  but he does eerily resemble il duce . 
  both in rhetoric and mannerism ... well , ok , perhaps more accurate description would be the lousy caricature of mussolini ... 
   as a libertarian and a trump supporter, 
  as a catholic and an atheist , i think you are nuts ... , 
  but is it ok to address men that way ? 
   you work for your employer that is n't registered as a company with the state ? 
  yes , my employer is `` registered . '', 
  they did that to avoid armed thugs to show up one day . 
   are you not registered on the company 's payroll ? 
  yes , i am . 
  for the same reason . 
   is your ` agreement ' with this employer not protected in any way by the state ? 
  beats me . 
  i do n't need the `` protection '' anyway . 
  if i 'm unhappy with my employer i quit . 
   did you not go to public school or use any public services before you attained this employment ? 
  did n't the same thugs extort money from my parents to `` provide free education ? '', 
   what about your employer ? 
  same thing . 
   do you and your employer not have to follow any laws pertaining to your work ? 
  you mean because of the thugs ? 
  it sure is . 
  still beats the current state of affairs ... 
   the only real explanation is that you 're an idiot . 
  ... or the other explanations are beyond your capabilities to comprehend ... 
   you should ask your parents . 
  i 'm not your mommy . 
  that was a rhetorical question . 
  look it up . 
   i mean try to answer the question, 
  that question was also rhetorical . 
   apparently beyond your capabilities to articulate . 
  just do n't feel the need to educate every dimwit on reddit . 
  i 've entered this conversation for the sake of others , who might be able to follow an argument . 
  did n't say i do n't want to educate anyone , just dimwits like yourself . 
  you are projecting . 
  you do n't pass a turing test . 
  `` there does n't seem to be anything here '', 
  of course it 's `` government by the people . '', 
  just a very small subset of `` the people '' ... 
   non-slave is n't someone 's bitch, 
  ... unless ( s ) he wants to be ... 
   i 'm going to assume you 're a troll . 
  you got it !, 
  nrxer is a dude who knows his inadequacy and , instead of trying to improve himself , develops an ideology `` proving '' he is `` superior '' because of his race .

   \\ #define 5vpin 4 / / define pin 4 - this will be the 5v out,

  5vpin is not a valid identifier . 
   the only rights we can really be said to possess are social constructs , agreed upon by society . 
  so , if society decides `` jews go into ovens '' then they do n't have rights to complain ? 
   we as a society have decided, 
  which society ? 
  so , back to the society the jews `` belonged '' to ... 
   what about that proves, 
  it does n't prove anything - just shows your definition of `` rights '' is kinda lacking ... 
  the natural law perspective tries to build on some universal axioms - `` we hold these truths to be self-evident '' - and derive all the legal arguments from that . 
  instead of one threshold , use two : low and high . 
  switch the leds on when below low and off if above high . 
   it 's rational for the less martially capable to seek a universal de-martialization of society, 
  that does n't make much sense - the `` less martially capable '' are much better off with handguns than without . 
  they would be at the mercy of the strong/well trained without handguns while are more or less equal with .
