   el manifesto del futurismo is clearly right wing . 
  musolini is clearly right wing . 
  what 's your definition of `` right wing ? '', 
  you are talking about the outliers . 
  it still holds for those within 2\u03c3, 
  the `` thought space '' called actual reality ... 
  in societies that have no restrictions on firearms , the most people have no such psychological problems . 
  in the restrictive ones they are against guns simply because that 's what they were indoctrinated into . 
  very often , immigrants into gun-friendly states , become gun owners after simply observing the real life does n't conform to their former prejudices . 
  he is not necessary wrong ( about tribalism vs individualism . ), 
  that 's the main reason libertarians have almost no chance of winning elections . 
  what do you mean ? 
  it reports the light level , does n't it . 
  you just need to make your code react to two different levels . 
   output to the arduino is one of two states , high or low . 
  got it . 
  i guess you need to do multiple readings , with some delay , before changing the led state . 
  if it fluctuates do n't toggle the led , only when you have consistent readings, 
   you would be talking about certain societies in certain times , where i was discussing the issue as the total psychological spectrum . 
  i was under impression you thought it was genetic ... 
   you also have n't yet explained why you 're using the two standard deviation figure above ; that was quite left-field . 
  just a rule of thumb - covers about 95 % . 
  the real screw-ups ( as in nature not nurture ) are not likely to be more than 2.5 % . 
  the long experience humans have with drafts seem to confirm that . 
  some of them shut off if the power draw is too low . 
  it happens within a couple of seconds , so if your second one does n't you should be good . 
   if you like your tool chain use it . 
  hmm ... 
  i can use a gnu toolchain with avr , pic or arm mcs . 
  will there be a gnu toolchain for esp32 ? 
  at 16 mhz most avr instructions execute in .0625 \u00b5s ... 
   where are the ancaps willing to kill and die for political change ? 
  have n't seen many `` aristos '' doing that either ... 
  nope . 
  i can see them bitching but not doing anything ( with a possible exception of venting on reddit . ), 
  but face it , your `` master race '' is not procreating and will die out sooner rather than later . 
  so , when are you gon na grab a kalash and start your race war ? 
  did you use a decoupling capacitor with max7219 ? 
  many such issues get fixed with decoupling caps ... 
  so , y' all cake bakers ' defenders - is it clinton or trump who will free the oppressed bakers ? 
   is the arduino simply an avr atmega328p with a standardized board size and bootloader ? 
  yes . 
   is the arduino uno pinout mandated by the avr atmega328p pinout or there are other possible pinout configurations available on different atmega328p development boards ? 
  here 's [ the pin mapping ] ( https://virtuabotix-virtuabotixllc.netdna-ssl.com/core/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/atmega328p-pu-chip-pinouts.png ) between uno and 328 . 
  different boards will have different mappings . 
  the limit depends on the file system . 
  for fat32 ( most common ) the limit is 4g -1 . 
   because of poverty, 
  so , how come they are poor ? 
  look at argentina - at the beginning of the xxth century it was n't much behind us , wealth-wise . 
  then they got peron ... 
   the poorest fifth in the united states pay ~ 10-15 % of their income in taxes ( state and federal ) , while often qualifying for negative income tax credit . 
  you keep forgetting the `` hidden '' taxes - they buy stuff , which price has already compensated for the taxes the producers pay ... 
   ** journalist : ** m. ben m'hidi , do n't you think it 's a bit cowardly to use women 's baskets and handbags to carry explosive devices that kill so many innocent people ? 
   ** ben m'hidi : ** and does n't it seem to you even more cowardly to drop napalm bombs on defenseless villages , so that there are a thousand times more innocent victims ? 
  of course , if we had your airplanes it would be a lot easier for us . 
  give us your bombers , and you can have our baskets . 
  [ _ battle of algiers _ ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058946/quotes?item=qt0131379 ), 
   i 'm libertarian and i 'm extremely racist . 
  lol !, 
  `` i 'm a catholic and i 'm extremely atheistic ! '', 
  libertarianism is an individualistic ideology , racism is a collectivist bullshit . 
  can not mix the two . 
  but it 's `` tuple '' not `` touple '' ... 
  you can associate ( or not ) with whoever you want . 
  but your ** believes ** disqualify you from being a libertarian . 
  the same way an atheist can not qualify as catholic ... 
   so you think private security would n't stop and frisk anyone, 
  not unless they were prepared to pay up a huge sum of moolah ... 
  guess the idea is the nrxers are too dumb to learn spanish and too dumb to use google translate as well ... , 
   getting to these planets to colonize them is very far off from our current abilities . 
  being almost forty lightyears away , it is virtually impossible with our current tech , since it would take well over one hundred thousand years, 
  i do n't think making a fusion drive would be that far off our current abilities - right now the hardest problem we face with fusion is containment . 
  that would not be a problem in fusion drive , not containing being the goal ... , 
  shock wave ? 
  what shock wave ? 
  so ortho . 
   i 'm a lawyer and have studied torts . 
  but this was a criminal case , not a tort ... just sayin ', 
  interesting ... 
  so , [ solar is some 6 % of the 10 % of renewable energy source meaning 0.6 % ; vs coal being 16 % ] ( http://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/?page=us_energy_home ) and it takes twice as many jobs to deliver it ?!!!, 
  no wonder it is a non-starter . 
  is simply does not make any sense . 
  what do you mean ? 
  he is just re-telling the ** official story ** in a simple language even a dimwit like yourself should understand . 
  and understand how ridiculous the official story is . 
   because i 'm sorry i do n't eat up shit like a sheep, 
  actually you do . 
  this is , basically , the ** official ** version of events , just put into a few simple sentences . 
  it sounds absurd only because the official story is absurd . 
  so , which parts of what he says are incorrect ? 
  this is pretty much the official narrative ... 
   i have a barn full of magical unicorns . 
  ... otherwise known as the official 911 narrative ... 
   someone writes several paragraphs arguing their point, 
  but he does n't `` argue '' anything . 
  all he does is re-telling the official 911 narrative , showing in the process how ridiculous it is . 
  there 's nothing to argue , nothing to post `` references '' to . 
  this is all exactly what your government and media been telling you all the time . 
   shoot a big missile at the incoming rock,
