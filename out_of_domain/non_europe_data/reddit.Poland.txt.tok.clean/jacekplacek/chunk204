   they must believe most jury pools are largely dumbs fucks . 
  unfortunately , they are usually right . 
  this particular jury was an exception rather than a rule ... 
  because you will hear a whine otherways , perhaps ?

   i understand the point completely . 
  you do n't like protection fees . 
   that does not mean any characterization you make of protection fees is accurate . 
  calling it guns being pointed at you is bullshit propaganda . 
  it 's a blatant lie . 
  no guns are being pointed at me , just two ` wise men ' hinting something about my knees . 
  that 's not an accurate characterization of mafia enforcement . 
  that 's what happens if you break the ` resisting wise men ' rule .

   taxes are collected on a schedule . 
  the amount is decided by a formula , which everyone is able to see . 
  taxes are collected from everyone who is liable , and there is no arbitrary decision making by humans . 
  oh , you mean like mafia 's `` protection fees ? '', 
  so , enlighten me : what 's the difference ? 
  1 ) not true . 
  they do provide drugs hookers and gambling and during prohibition they did provide booze . 
  quite recently they also started providing cheap ( er ) cigarettes ... also , many mafia dons donate lavishly to charities and arts . 
  2 ) big whoopee !, 
  i have yet to see a single instance of one vote deciding anything . 
  not to mention usually you just get to pick scumbag a over scumbag b. 
  3 ) you might ask randy weaver , branch davidians or move members about that ... 
  besides , the mafias get really violent mostly in the turf wars with other mafias . 
  guess how the governments handle turf disputes . 
  4 ) ... that you could get much cheaper without the government . 
  mafia still gives you cheaper cigarettes ... 
  no firefly !!!?

   mathematics is a universal language . 
  if the signal , for example , were prime numbers , that would be an unmistakable sign of intelligent life . 
  you are anthropomorphizing already ... what if they are an intelligent slime - they would never have a need for counting , they would think in categories of distance and area . 
  they might develop math around \u03c0 and the `` natural '' numbers would be just a curiosity , not worth paying much attention to ...

  they would still have math , just based on the real numbers not integers ... with a peculiar multiplication identity , being the irrational number .

   numbers , especially prime and fibonacci sequences are things that are the same no matter what base number you are using . 
  are they ? 
  even if your base is not an integer ?

   perhaps a community of people might agree to it together . 
  perhaps it 's not a `` regulation , '' in that case , but `` custom . '',

  how do you ask jsonconvert to ignore cycles ? 
  is there some attribute i can put on the property for jsonconvert to ignore it ?
