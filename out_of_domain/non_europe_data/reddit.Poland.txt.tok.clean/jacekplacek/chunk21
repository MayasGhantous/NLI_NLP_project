  was it also a favourite book of secret service agent in charge ? 
  his job was to tackle bush and quickly remove him from the potentially dangerous place . 
  they did it with dick , was bush deemed expandable at this point ? 
  or did they know he was n't in danger ? 
   it 's a very tough decision to order u.s. air force pilots to shoot down a u.s. airline full of innocent u.s. citizens , even if you believe it could ultimately save lives . 
  no one would make that decision with the limited information available . 
  at this point you convinced me you are just a tool . 
  you simply can not be unaware that scrambling the fighters to intercept any unresponsive/out of course plane is a ** standard operating procedure ** . 
  shooting the plane down , although tough decision , can not be done if there 's no fighter jet in range ... 
   and since the force of gravity is down the structure fell down not sideways . 
  < sigh /  no , it 's gon na follow the path of least resistance . 
  the way it would be epected is the _ start _ of the south tower [ collapse ] ( http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/evidence/videos/index.html ), 
  , you can clearly see the top of the tower starting to topple over . 
  exactly as you would expect ( non-uniformly ) damaged structure to fail . 
  what would be expected next is the top continuing to topple over and falling to the side of the tower , possibly damaging some more floors , and the rest of the building should stay mainly intact . 
  but something miraculous happens instead : the top of the tower disintegrates in mid air and , even more curiously , the mast seems to straighten up . 
  ( steel column it 's attached to falls down faster and pulls at it from below ? ), 
  now , i have yet to see the ( credible ) explanation for this !, 
  ok , so what happened to the central columns ? 
  so , how come if you get hit over the head hard enough , you do n't fall stright down ? 
  switch to plastic . 
  ok , i 've read and re-read and re-read again ... nothing about ** central ** columns . 
  and the exterior columns convieniently `` snapped ? '', 
  this is steel we are talking about , it can bend , twist or even tear ; does n't usually `` snap '' into easily manageable chunks ... 
  oh ... so gravity is not the _ only _ force involved ? 
  well , it should be pretty easy to build a model of the tower out of two materials aproximating relative properties of steel and concrete , let 's say wet sand and modeling wax . 
  make the model sturdy enough to withstand some lateral force and a little bit of swaying . 
  now apply damage to the part of your model roughly at the same point as the south tower . 
  you can heat it and do mechanical damage . 
  observe how it colapses . 
  if you can replicate twin towers collapse pattern you will have me convinced . 
  from the part you cited i can see that it 's long-winded and short on facts and long on speculation . 
  why did n't you cite something that was relevant to the question ? 
   the article is like 6 pages long, 
  no , it 's 6 chapters and 13 pages of boring narrative completly devoid of facts . 
  interactive graphic does n't explain anything - it tells you `` this and this happened '' and does n't explain why . 
  unless you consider marvels like : `` other elements of the design led to their collapse . '', 
  ( what other elements ? 
  how did they contribute to collapse ? ), 
  `` the lack of interior support columns probably accelerated the buildings ' collapse . '', 
  ( o rly ? ), 
  but most important part - the answer to the question `` what happened to the central columns '' is ** nowhere ** to be found . 
  not in the 13 pages of the article . 
  not in the `` interactive '' ( play/stop buttons make it interactive ... lol , only in nyt ) thingie . 
  nowhere !, 
  so , you are not only rude , you are also a liar . 
   i love how any comment in a gun-related thread on reddit other than `` guns guns rah rah rah ! '', 
  results in a torrent of downvotes, 
  not any comment . 
  only stupid ones ... 
  well , i think that if we could make them wear body armor all the time , whenever they go , we would be half-way there ... 
  just owning guns wo n't , having them when everything else fails and people decide to take their freedom back might . 
   and those actions of mine protect your civil liberties, 
  i 'm sorry to burst your bubble ... all those actions achieve is some chuckles from your massa . 
  edit : typo, 
   there 's not much there to create any undesired odor, 
  this would be more credible if it came from your co-workers ...  one of my co-workers is not very hygiene-conscious and does n't seem to be aware of his aroma ... 
  yeah , right ... , 
  yeah , lbj was courting the black vote , so he went . 
  dubya does n't have any illusions in that matter , so he passed ... 
   the point i was trying to make was that the police did n't just take his money because he had a large amount . 
  there were other circumstances . 
  they needed a new car ? 
   why the fuck has n't the supreme court ruled civil forfeiture unconstitutional ? 
  why should they kill the goose that lays golden eggs ? 
  so what would that mean ? 
  anytime pig gives you a traffic ticket monsanto gets royalties ? 
   this argument reminds me of the democrats claiming that they voted in favor of the iraq war because the white house tricked them into doing so ... not that getting outwitted by bush is any less embarrassing than getting outwitted by flour, 
  ay-ay captain !, 
  i 'll keep re-aranging chairs on the deck ... 
  give them damn cows some beano !, 
   it was the first vodka ever to be created by combining salt , sugar , vanillin and glycerin, 
   at national airport , my plane had minor maintenance problems and the repair crews had the engines opened . 
  the announcer or whatever you call him repeatedly told us `` not to panic . '' oh . 
  i 'm going to panic because they 're putting a new valve in the de-icing generator ? 
  meanwhile , everywhere the government can insert its fingers , the recorded warnings : watch everybody else and call this number if ... report suspicious behavior ... look for abandoned packages ... lift your feet when using the escalators ... threat level orange . 
  lol sure ... ok [ here 's ] ( http://msn.match.com/msn/article.aspx?articleid=8409&amp;menuid=7&amp;lid=429 ) the article that 's presenting detailed rebuttal of your thesis . 
  what ? 
  can not find anything even remotely relevant ? 
  perhaps you can not read ... 
   there is no such standard operating procedure as the one you claimed , you 've been duped, 
  quick google yealds [ this ] ( http://fas.org/spp/military/docops/norad/reg10001.htm ) pay special attention to 1.3.6.8, 
  this is talking about ** exterior ** columns , i was asking about ** central ** , load bearing columns . 
  stop playing stupid ... liar . 
   you said that a judge can succeed at this task, 
  no , i did n't . 
  it was dead ex-president . 
  if you actually looked at the < snicker  `` interactive graphic '' < / snicker  at your link you will notice there are internal ( central , i concede , was not an entirely exact description ) columns . 
  narrator tries to avoid this topic , at some point even suggesting that `` lack of the central columns '' contributed to the collapse , but it can work only with unattentive and gullible dummies . 
  so , are you saing there were no internal columns ? 
   i do n't know what went wrong in argentina, 
  one word : peron, 
   how did he do so much harm, 
  one word again : hubris . 
  he thought he was immune from the laws of economics . 
  other dudes in power at least tried to listen to their economic advisers ( with mixed results , some advisers were better than others ) , his adviser was evita . 
   without getting the bad press one would expect ? 
  because he and evita _ really _ were well-meaning ... 
   it seems that the well intentioned leadership of patriots was much more damaging than deliberate destruction by enemies in war time . 
  is human stupidity a greater engine of destruction than deliberate evil ?
