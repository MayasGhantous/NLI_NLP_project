  unfortunately , yes . 
  even more unfortunately , well meaning fools are more dangerous than evil ones . 
  sooner or later antics of the evil ones are seen for what they are . 
  genuine do-gooders are getting much more goodwill and disasters caused by them are being explained by extrenal circumstances . 
  so , they have more chances to do more and more damage . 
   what are you talking about ? 
  breasts arent `` vulgar , '' nor are necks , nor are any other parts of the human body . 
  you are right but you are missing the point . 
  those who cry for liberation of muslim women ( from burkas ) do n't understand that american women are as much `` opressed '' as saudi ones . 
  if culture 's `` dress code '' means opression . 
  bitch about it on reddit ... 
  to think of it , mr. welsh , when he was born , certainly looked like a normal infant ... 
  i understand adrianna is compassionate and wants to employ the mentally challanged but she should give them duties they are able to perform ... 
  hey , but he 's got a nice hairdo ... 
  pig get some of the medicine he used to administer to others ... lol, 
  dumbass !, 
  what prevented him from asking some american to `` buy '' the car and , then , `` re-sell '' it to him ? 
  hmm ... the dealership will ( temporarily ) register the car to the first buyer , second buyer pays back the registration fee and gets the car signed over to him . 
  if he was to save $ 20k on the car 's price registration fee is no biggie . 
  for those who might be interested [ songs of bad men and good ] ( http://www.lulu.com/content/808128 ), 
  what 's creepy about it ? 
  tacky , yes but creepy ... ? 
  you seem to imply reagan was a `` mass murderer '' too . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  other than grenada ( with negligible casualties ) and khadaffi bombing , he was rather the opposite of teddy roosevelt - `` talk harshly and seldom use the big stick . '', 
  they did their killing for themselves , thank you very much . 
  you might have a point with `` war ondrugs '' other than `` lives ruined '' does n't make somebody `` mass murderer , '' `` mass life ruiner '' perhaps . 
  you might notice that ** every ** president after reagan escalated `` war on drugs . '', 
  also ** every single ** president since wwii ( carter being an exception ) has much more blood on their hands than reagan . 
  do n't be ridiculous . 
  you gon na scare chechens by saing `` surrender or the world gets it ? '', 
   somehow this speak very good of blair 's standard of evidence . . 
  methinks , it only speaks about mr. meyer 's oppinion ... 
  as a country - yes !, 
  individually - no . 
  you can do much good if you wish , starting with donating to rebel 's cause up to getting ak47 and going there to help . 
  incidentally , that was the preffered action of many americans ( hemingway included ) in spanish civil war ... 
  nowadays do-gooders seem to be more happy with demanding us sends other people children to fight and die for their ( do-gooders ' ) conscious ... 
  so , what about it ? 
  reagan supported one side in nicaraguan civil war ( using questionable means ) and this side did more killing ( as a consequence of said support , perhaps . ), 
  if he did n't , then ortega 's side would do more killing and , quite conceivably , would be doing it even now ... how does this translate into being `` mass murderer ? '', 
  hey , what strikes the author 's fancy ... as long as it 's comprehensible , i 'd rather have different authors use different styles/phrasing . 
  if everybody 's writing was the same it would be quite boring . 
  yeah , right ... 
  i think that there 's something creepy about americans ' fear of women tits . 
  it ca n't be healthy to be that repressed . 
   as we talked more , she admitted that she originally planned to only take a year off , now it was 3 years later ... and that she saw it very difficult to go back to school because she now had a house note , a bmw payment , etc. 
  perhaps , she realised that going to shool is not going to buy her bmw ... ? 
   she wearing a hijab is the product of her being brainwashed into believing all sorts of outlandish stuff, 
  american girl wearing a bra is the product of her being brainwashed into believing all sorts of outlandish stuff, 
  agree . 
  man-made tits are abomination ... , 
  btw how do you get drunk on mango ? 
  you 'd be onto something if only girls with sagging ones were wearing bras . 
   also i believe united states ca n't just attack a country without the congress having declared war , and we all know that wo n't happen anytime soon, 
  hmm ... the last time congress has declared war was wwii . 
  guess we did n't have any wars since ... 
   alireza jafarzadeh , a spokesman for the national council of resistance of iran , which uncovered the existence of iran 's uranium enrichment plant at natanz , said the iaea was being strung along . 
  `` a number of nuclear sites have not even been visited by the iaea , '' he said . 
  `` they 're giving a clean bill of health to a regime that is known to have practised deception . '', 
  dunno ... never wore a bra and my man-boobs do n't sag ... , 
  what would make a difference : turn right back to the cashier and return everything you bought , calling the manager and explaining the reason ... 
  obviously , it 'd only make a difference if you were n't alone in doing that . 
  do n't they know of this < sarcasm  marvelous new technology < / sarcasm  called rfid ... ? 
   well he did n't say `` morons '' , but h-town said `` deranged '', 
  `` moron '' and `` deranged '' are not the same . 
  quite the contrary , there can be deranged geniuses . 
   i would n't be surprised . 
  people in academia tend to think more rational . 
  and we all know that ` reality has a liberal bias ' ( stephen colbert ) . 
  you can be impeccably rational and still arrive at incorrect conclusion . 
  hint : it depends on premises ( axioms ) you choose ... funny you chose comedian as your authority , 
   republicans tend not to believe in man made global warming, 
  `` believe '' being the operative word here ... for whatever reason , liberals tend to `` belive '' it . 
  it should n't be matter of faith . 
  evidence is not quite as [ conclusive ] ( http://reddit.com/info/2kpsf/comments ) as algorists want it to be ... 
  edit : typos, 
   the only way this would happen is if someone visited the store with the intention of returning their purchases for the sole purpose of making some sort of statement, 
  not really . 
  i have a habit of walking out of the store and leaving full shopping basket behind , when the store in question allows the long queue to form at the cashier ... esp . 
  when there 's lot of closed cashiers and plenty of employees standing around and talking . 
  the inconvenience of going to another store is less important for me than making a point . 
  ( i tend to leave with loud remark , something like `` did i get beamed into soviet union ? '' ), 
  praying to tooth fairy would be much more effective ... 
  calvin and hobbes ? 
  ah , beavis and butthead ... 
  i should have known ... , 
   go ahead and mod me down, 
  glad to oblige ... 
   in most languages , ' 3 ' `` 3 '' and 3 are totally different things, 
  how is that a bad thing ? 
   if you have no experience , i would suggest basic, 
  absolutely no !, 
  it will damage you forever . 
  you 've got ta be kidiing . 
  the very ** first ** thing you need to learn is that you ** will ** make mistakes . 
  how is language covering up your mistakes a good thing ? 
   programmers will become obsolete in the near future, 
  now , i 've been hearing this for over three decades ... , 
  one advice : pick something simple first as a language ( no basic , though , visual or otherwise ) and see if it gives you pleasure to solve small problems .
