  if it does , you are on your way , if it does n't - run , do n't look back . 
  pay special attention to how making a mistake makes you feel . 
  you ** will ** make mistakes , plenty of them . 
  if it challanges you intellectually and make you want to fix them - good . 
  if it frustrates you - again , run . 
  every proffesion is easier to perform if you enjoy doing it . 
  so is programming . 
  but if you do n't enjoy it programming is going to make you much more miserable than any other . 
  you can still make yourself marginally profficient in it but you will ** hate your life ** and never become _ really _ good . 
  as to what language ? 
  does n't matter that much . 
  you will want ( need ) to learn more than one anyway . 
  i 'm partial to c++ myself but it 's much more complex and much harder to learn than most ( unless you start with [ `` accelerated c++ '' ] ( http://www.acceleratedcpp.com/ ) . 
  so , you are advocating training for running through fields of rusty knives , by running through fields of grass ? 
   orson scott card [ ... ] is a theist and a supporter of israel . 
  and how is it relevant ? 
  so he can learn way to run he will have to `` unlearn '' later ? 
  i 'd rather theach him walking carefully through the knives first , and increase his speed gradually ... 
  btw i would hate to have you on the team tasked with writing software communicating in ascii with some external device . 
  believe me , there 's ** huge ** difference between 3 and ' 3 ' ... 
   languages with loose typing do n't `` cover up '' mistakes , they change what is and is n't a mistake in a way that makes programming less tedious, 
  they encourage `` sloppy '' thinking . 
  they make _ writting _ code less tedious and _ debugging _ more tedious ... 
   when you were learning to ride a bike for the first time , did you have training wheels ? 
  nope . 
  so , you believe everything your school textbook is telling you ... ? 
  google the name `` edsger dijkstra '' and you will run into his famous quote :, 
   it is practically impossible to teach good programming to students that have had a prior exposure to basic : as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration . 
  i guess he must have been an idiot , your school textbook tells you so ... 
   and if you did have a gun in hand , you 'd be riddled with bullets from their assault rifles . 
  unless the gun in hand was something like [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/image:m2_machine_gun.jpg ) ... , 
  well , c is not very good example  it 's strongly typed language without strong type enforcement ... 
  oh , give me a fucking break ... `` great vision '' my ass . 
  he did n't have a slightest clue what the internet was or was to become . 
  his `` accomplishment '' was voting for the money to be spent on what his lobbyists wanted . 
  not even the ** real ** creators of the internet anticipated what it turned out to become . 
  in 2000 electioons people were facing two candidates : a bufoon and a dimwit - they chose a dimwit . 
   that 's because writers do not fact check as closely as they used to . 
  no , that 's because algor is an ridiculous buffoonish megalomaniac ... 
   his positions on the gold standard , abortion , and trade are simply untenable, 
  let 's see - gold standard : the same position as alan greenspan ; abortion : only `` il duce '' gulliani has a pro choice view , rest of the republican candidates are pro life , paul is probably the only one who wants to leave it to the states ; trade : being for free trade is now `` untenable ? '', 
  edit : grammar ... 
  could i cut my reading in half ? 
  sure , it would be tough though ... , 
   the child is too small to hold onto your back reliable while you run, 
  run ? 
  are you under an impression you can possibly outrun a mountain lion ? 
   40-something woman who preys on younger gentlemen, 
  preys ? 
  he does n't know . 
  he 's so large , he passes out anytime he gets an erection ... , 
   there are many documented cases of this , including teenage girls fighting off cougars . 
  teenage girls should date older men instead of teenage boys . 
  that way they do n't have to fight cougars off ... , 
  a ) nope . 
  b ) the car is a deadly weapon . 
  there 's many more nutcases killing people with cars than with guns ... 
  so , do n't [ w ] onder , do some research and find out , foxtrot . 
  that was `` bolek i lolek '' ... , 
  if it was n't on discovery channel it did n't happen ... , 
  you do n't get it : kiddiefiddler likes - good post ; kiddiefiddler no likes - bad post . 
  what 's your language ? 
  he is running in ** republican ** fucking primaries !, 
  no matter how much you try you 're not gon na squeeze kucinich in there . 
  so who would you rather have as ** republican ** candidate ? 
  edit : typo, 
  it 's ** now ** att wireless , ** previously ** cingular . 
   he also is a man who refuses to help people in need , because he thinks he somehow `` knows '' that they do n't deserve it . 
  this [ study ] ( http://usinfo.state.gov/xarchives/display.html?p=washfile-english&amp;y=2005&amp;m=february&amp;x=200502181639511cjsamoht5.593508e-02 ) on charitable contributions seems to directly contradict your beliefs . 
  * `` nongivers , according to brooks , tend to be young , unreligious , unmarried males who believe government should redistribute income . 
  '' * hardly the stereotype of libertarian , liberal ( in contemporary us meaning ) though ... 
   this should make it clear why you ca n't be both logical and metaphysical at the same time . 
  for the philosopher and logician you seem to be awfully confused ... logic is a `` tool '' , metaphisics a `` matrial '' - you can not use your tool without some material to use it on ... 
  in case of albright , bush is actually right ... even a broken clock ... 
  edit : fixed a _ broken _ metaphor ... , 
  well , this discussion is not about logic , logic is a tool we use ( with varying degree of success ) to argue about metaphisics ( or , more precisely , about ontology . ), 
  yes , i said metaphisics , that 's basically the root of our disagreement - differences of metaphisics . 
  if our understanding of reality was identical , logic alone would solve all disagreements , would n't it . 
  it seems all political discussions are deep down really ontological ... 
   doing metaphysics and doing logic are entirely different activities, 
  i beg to differ - you can not argue metaphisics without using logic . 
  well , you can but then it 's no longer a discussion , it becomes a pissing contest .

  not enough christians among hackers ? 
  or rapture already happend and we did n't notice ? 
  it 's deamon , not satan - get your mythical beings right ... 
   please read up on the oj simpson case , where the bloody glove found on his property by a racist cop searching without a warrant was admitted into evidence . 
  but , otoh , if it was n't admitted cochran would n't have a punch-line for the jury ... 
  hmm ... 
  i admit you have me baffled !, 
  it 's not `` romanian '' in romanian , neither does it sound like `` romany . '', 
  `` romansh '' is probably out of the question ( not being `` eastern european '' ) too . 
  it does sound like `` romanian girl '' in polish , though . 
  but not `` romanian language . '', 
  hmm ... perhaps scotus ** was ** far-leftist in the 80s ... 
   it saddens me when i see them walking around carrying machine guns . 
  why ? 
  am i entitled now to correct your english ? ... 
  why , it 's easy : pilots dropping the bomb from safe distance are heroes , guys strapping the bomb and blowing themselves up are cowards . 
  see how that works ?
