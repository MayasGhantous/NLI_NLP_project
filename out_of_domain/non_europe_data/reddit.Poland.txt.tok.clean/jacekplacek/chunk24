  sarcasm impaired ? 
  he 's lucky they were bounty hunters not cops . 
  he is still alive and he can sue them . 
  ok , i do n't get what you saying ... you mean gay men enjoy women with machine guns ? 
  quite the contrary . 
  the disincentives of shooting an innocent person are quite different - cops get paid leave , bounty hunters go to jail ... 
  the c$ 1.00 coin has a picture of a loon on it . 
  you would make a great soviet citizen , comrade . 
  bravo !, 
  you may think you do but you 'd learn to love it , given a chance . 
  last time i heard from him he was hanging on golgotha ... , 
   ` everyone knows that there is at least one person with whatever-color eyes ' is a different piece of information . 
  but if there 's more than one person with blue eyes it 's still not a ** new ** piece of information - ** everybody ** knows there 's somebody with blue eyes . 
   after the guru speaks , each person has a new piece of critical information : maybe the guru was talking about me, 
  it 's not a new information anymore than `` maybe i have blue eyes '' is . 
  your reasoning is incorrect . 
  what it boils down to is the situation of the person who needs to decide if he 's got blue eyes . 
  when his logic brings him down to the point he does n't see anybody with blue eyes it 's neccessery for the guru to say `` there is a blue eyed one '' which can only happen if he indeed has blue eyes . 
  so , at this point he does n't know what the guru would say , therefore he can not follow your reasoning . 
  but the `` solution '' assumes that in a diiferent scenario the guru ** would ** say the same thing . 
  look at it this way : if you are the only person with blue eyes you will know your eyes are blue if and only if the guru said `` there is somebody with blue eyes . '', 
  this does n't follow from the guru saying the same thing when there 's 100 blue-eyed people . 
  if everybody kept the tabulation and were showing it to each other there would be no puzzle - all you would need to know your eye color would be to compare your score with somebody else 's ... 
  serves the moron right for allowing the pig to search his car ... 
   poland seized after ww1 german territories, 
  only in the same sense as `` romania seized austro-hungarian and ottoman territories '', 
  danzig was n't part of poland till after wwii . 
  most people do n't grow their lettuce ... 
  yeah , and he would oppose federal department of apple pie too !, 
   the federal government exists for compassion . 
  compassion with other people 's money rocks !, 
  hey i 've seen a poor guy today , i 'm very compassionate so i 'll go to your place and shake some dough out of you to help the guy ... 
   obey orders from one 's elders, 
  they both have integrity , rare breed nowadays ... 
   the sign says : `` fire danger , smoking and other use of fire is forbidden '', 
  apparently the tree had a different oppinion ... , 
  yup . 
  they got it from us ... 
   israel is regularly attacked by suicide bombers , that 's what i meant . 
  and today there is regularly shot rockets into israel . 
  germans were regularly attacked by what they called `` bandits '' from polish , french , russian , czech , etc. 
  resistance ... poor germans , do n't you have any sympathy for them ? 
  i guess saddam was n't a dictator then . 
  he was `` usually '' elected ... , 
  some did n't , some did ... but the late unpleasantries in lebanon were over hezbollah targeting israeli ** soldiers ** ... 
   russia is not running rampage around the world invading other countries just for the fun of it, 
  now ... 
   the patriots are the ones who start wars, 
  nah , the scum politicians ( is that redundant ? ), 
  start wars . 
  patriots are the ones who get suckered into fighting ... 
  do you believe palestinian population is more comfortable than israelis ? 
  did n't kill 6 million jews ! = fascist alert, 
  that we can , certainly , agree on . 
  hey , that 's how `` statistics '' is done - you pick the outcome you want , then you tailor your sample to arrive at the outcome ... , 
  can you name one thing you are not afraid of ? 
  just curious . 
  nah , the guy who hired demolition crew and then refused to pay ... 
  and osama bin laden supported kerry last election ... ohmygod !, 
  kerry is a terrist !, 
  so , nothing to worry about - it 's `` kindler , gentler '' fascism ... for now . 
  my point ( which you obviously missed ) is that you do n't have to kill 6 million jews to be fascist ... musollini did n't , franco did n't salazar did n't ... guess they were n't fascist enough . 
  you pollyannas are forgeting simple thing - fascist state does n't have to be oppressive , it only resorts to oppresion when it feels threatened in it 's power . 
  kinda like slavery does n't need to be oppresive , there were many plantations where slaves were docile and obedient enough that massa did n't have to reach for the whip . 
  that 's the situation right now in us : the whip is there but it 's hardly ever used . 
  when ( if ? ), 
  the niggas become uppity than will be time to reach for the whip . 
  so , how many sand nigger bitches did you rape over there ? 
  downmodded for no pics . 
  that 's pretty simple : drug users are at the constant risk of being attacked by the deranged dea thugs , anybody close by could become a `` colateral damage . '', 
   my bad lowerr back ache, 
  iow pain in the ass ... , 
  third reich in which year ? 
  what about franco 's spain or salazar 's portugal ? 
  i am pretty sure that if they pass the law requiring to suck the cock of the police officer on demand , you 'd be happy to obey . 
  edit : typo, 
   the qualification of the morality of death is the current cognitive ability of the being, 
  you sure you 'd like the doctor in the er apply this yardstick to you when you are brought , ** unconscious ** , from the accident ? 
   he denies that the separation of church and state is in the constitution . 
  it should be pretty easy to point out to the place in the constitution refuting him , should n't it . 
  oh , stop this mutual masturbation in public , will you . 
  that 's the problem - sometimes the lethal force is neccessary ... 
  23rd floor is owned by the triad and has separate elevator . 
   whatever the opposite of fascism is, 
  that would be `` freedom , '' perhaps ... incidentally it 's the ron paul 's objective . 
  that 's why i said `` sometimes '' ... what if the attacker is not taken down by pepper spry ? 
  what if he shrugs of the taser ? 
  what if there are more than one ? 
  yup . 
  your wife who is about to cash your life insurance ... 
  i 'm not talking about being in the coma . 
  ibsulon 's criteria cover being simply unconsciuos ... 
   pulling a knife will almost certainly get you killed, 
  the gent in question 's shown otherwise ... 
  yeah , i have read it . 
  the way i see it it 's more like preventing the federal government fom telling the alabama judge he can not have ten commandments at his court . 
  but having your car `` plowed into '' by a sober guy is ok ? 
  heh , heh ... we 've got plenty of those on reddit . 
  perhaps that explains ron paul 's popularity here ... , 
  i wanted to donate , but no matter how much i click here it never gets me there ... ,
