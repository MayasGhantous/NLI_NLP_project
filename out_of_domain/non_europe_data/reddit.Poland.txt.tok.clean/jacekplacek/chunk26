  9 ) does it include murder charges for abortions ? 
  10 ) who decides it and on what grounds ? 
  you lost me there ... how is killing people going to achieve `` saving lives '' ? 
  2 ) so you are inconsistent : if you do n't approve cutting to 0 % you can not say you are for cutting taxes _ on principle _ , can you . 
  3 ) would that include madrassas or scientologist schools ? 
  4 ) how does it ` declare ' anything ? 
  any couple is going to bring different `` things '' to raising ( or not raising ) the child ... no two persons are the same and every couple is different from any other ... 
  5 ) do you mean arabs are morally inferior to jews ? 
  10 ) i do n't think there 's anything `` obvious '' about it - i bet you ancient aztec or modern saudi would disagree ... 
  1 ) i believe one of us lost track what point is being addressed here ...  i 'm talking iraq war , not death penalty ... 
  2 ) uhmm ... you 've initially said `` i believe in tax cuts for everyone period . '', 
  that sounds quite like statement of principles , not of disagreement with current levels ... 
  but on principle , how can you be for x % but against ( x +1 ) % ... ? 
  4 ) but marriage does n't necessary imply raising children . 
  would you accept gay marriages if it was n't easy for such couple to adopt a child ? 
  besides , they can have children now without getting married . 
  why is it preferable to you ? 
  5 ) no you did n't . 
  palestine is not a country . 
  but let 's talk countries : do you believe that if one country is `` morally superior '' ( whatever that means ) to the other , thy have a right to invade and occupy the `` inferior '' one ? 
  do they have a right to send settlers into the `` inferior '' one ? 
  do they have a right to displace the population of the `` inferior '' country ? 
  10 ) ok , so how do you propose to determine which culture is `` inferior '' ? 
  obviously , there 's no consensus . 
  and i do n't think there would be a `` majority opinion '' adhering to your believes either . 
  that would leave brute force , i guess ... is that your position ? 
   this `` do n't have to pay taxes '' myth has been debunked over , and over , and over , and over again . 
  as was the `` do n't have to pay protection money to mafia '' myth ... 
   do you think we should save tibet or darfur ? 
  do you think we should invade china and sudan ? 
  actually , he has a point . 
  you might recall reading about a spanish civil war . 
  back then , people who sided with one party did n't ask us government to send other people children to fight for their cause , they went there themselves , or supported their favorite side with their own ( not taxpayers ' ) money ... 
  i guess moral convictions are much cheaper nowadays ... 
  not to mention vatican ... 
  yeah !, 
  and between those who believe bill of rights is overruled by the commerce clause and those who do n't ( paul and his friends ) ... 
   why on earth would you try to pro-actively seed the information out, 
  to make sure the first reporters are of the `` right kind '' ... ? 
  ... or vice versa ... 
   is that mot [ t ] o all bullshit ? 
  yes . 
   people who believe that under certain circumstances , law-abiding citizens should have no access to their rights under the bor, 
   those of us who believe that the bill of rights applies to all citizens , all the time, 
  if that were indeed the case , you 'd be protesting half ( at least ) of the laws passed by your masters , and almost all recent constitutional decisions by scotus ... all i can see is you protesting ( arguably ) the best friend the constitution has in the congress ... 
  < sigh  yes , it 's his proposed bill but he knew very well it has no chance at passing . 
  it was meant as a protest against courts overreaching rulings , like the ruling preventing the judge in alabama from displaying x commandments at his court . 
  and before you start screaming `` separation of church and state '' you 'd be well advised to actually read the 1st amendment ... it says `` congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof '' - how the hell judge displaying religious symbol can possibly be construed as state `` establishment of religion '' ? 
  and does n't prohibiting said judge break the rule of not `` prohibiting the free exercise thereof '' ? 
  he was also addressing concern with efforts to outlaw gay marriages at the federal level ... but that does n't fit your agenda , does it . 
  as to constitution being `` replete with god '' he misspoke , so what ... what he probably meant was the declaration of independence ... 
  does n't mean he wants to put god into constitution ... 
  so you looked at one of his sponsored bills and you do n't like it ( mostly because you do n't understand why he introduced it ) and you completely ignore his long fucking record of votes and bills trying to restore the fucking constitution or protesting it 's abuse , well fucking done !, 
  meanwhile , your fucking supreme court and your fucking congress and your fucking miserable excuse for president , are removing the few remaining crumbs of liberty you still have - and all you do is oink ... 
  i tell you what , you fucking deserve your government so enjoy your fucking chains !, 
  or it appears moronic to those with no discernable comprehension skills ... 
  you get what you pay for ... 
  just because you do n't like it does n't make it wrong ... , 
  why ? 
   he endorsed david duke in one of those newsletters . 
  and that 's a ** lie ** ... 
  he never endorsed duke - all he ( or lew rockwell , or whoever actually wrote it ) said was that duke 's economic policies made him appealing to much broader slice of electorate than just racists . 
  if that 's an endorsement then democrats , who applaud anti-smoking policies , must be endorsing hitler ( who , after all , passed first anti-smoking laws in the world . ), 
  hmm ... 
  in many ( most ? ), 
  nazi-occupied countries in europe women who associated with german soldiers were n't treated too nicely either ... perhaps not often killed , but universally shunned ... was it right ? 
  i dunno , you tell me ... 
  ... who will fucking invade iran too ... 
   miley cyrus is not happy that the pictures have been published, 
  methinks , she realized her fanclub consist mostly of children of prudes who did disapprove ... so she 's just trying to placate them . 
  she did like the picture and did n't mind having it published at first ... 
  if you are implying he is faking it to be popular , you are wrong . 
  it is his long-standing position drug war is insane and should stop ... 
   if a black person is killed because they were black , then other black people in that community are inherently threatened . 
  except that if a ** random ** person is killed in a community , other people in that community are inherently threatened . 
   it is fitting and proper, 
  it 's sweet and glorious, 
  and how many votes did mac get ... ? 
  do n't forget jerry from `` conspiracy theories '' ... , 
  yes . 
  yes , but the first clue what viagra could be good for was from the trial they did for it as a heart drug ... when the trial fizzled ( it was not effective against heart conditions ) some of the male subjects refused to relinquish the remaining doses ... 
  hmm ... 
  i dunno , there was a famous zoologist who , when seeing a giraffe for the first time , said such an animal could n't exist ... 
  yes . 
  the difference being : if somebody gets hold of your credit card and goes on shopping spree with it , you have a chance to dispute it ; if the same happens with your debit card - your checks start bouncing before you even notice . 
   he most studied building collapse of all time, 
  i 'm going to use hanlon 's razor and assume you are being simply misinformed , not willfully deceitful ... 
  nothing could be further from the truth . 
  this administration fought any attempt at investigation `` tooth and nail '' , most of the evidence was shipped to scrapyard/china before any investigation could take place . 
  independent investigators were practically barred from the site . 
  nist was , finally , allowed to look at the matter only years after 911 . etc. . . etc. . . 
  ca n't do that . 
  it would be anti-semitic ... , 
   you ca n't count on people to do the right thing, 
  ... but when they get into government they are becoming saints ... 
   a psychopathological condition characterized by delusional fantasies of wealth , power , or omnipotence . 
  hmm ... 
  i dunno , he ** does ** have wealth and power ... 
   furthermore , she condemns the junta for refusing outside aid from the us , the un and the eu . 
  kinda like fema refused outside aid from private individuals and organizations ...
