  and how do you know that ? 
  you some kind of mind reader ... ? 
   if you destroy a cctv camera , you will be caught on another camera and arrested within a few minutes, 
  ... unless you are a good shot ... 
  you are quite welcome to set the example and kill yourself ... 
  so , in raid 1 you are getting 1 file back ... ? 
  what about thinking of it as a probability you can recover your data : 0 in raid 0 , 1 in raid 1 ... ( i know it 's not really 1 ... ), 
  the brand of insecticide ... ? 
  ... post consumer recycled toilet paper ... 
  fresh sweat is not as ` potent ' as stale one and smoke ( stale ) is not something that would alarm an animal ... just my conjectures ... , 
  yup . 
  he 's got religion to run ... , 
  as most of his constituency are armed ( and know how to use it ) feds might be for a bit of surprise ... 
  i could never understand what people see in ja ... plain looking anorexic ... 
   i 'll continue bringing up inconvenient realities, 
  you would n't know reality if it bit you in the ass ... actually reality ** is ** fucking you up your ass right now but you seem to enjoy it ... 
  i think you do n't really know what all those labels mean ... ponder this : if neo-conservatists are the real conservatists why did they attach `` neo '' to their label ... ? 
   maybe `` they '' did n't, 
  actually , yes , `` they '' did , look it up ... 
   heir policies were still all underpinned by conservative morality, 
  well ... wrong again - most of neo-con `` thinkers '' are ex-trotskyites or ex `` liberals '' only a tiny handful started as conservatists . 
  and they still adhere to trotsky 's `` morality '' and his idea of `` global revolution '' ... they only change their minds on viability of marksist economic policies . 
   which basically boils down to a series of excuses for mean-spiritedness and non-questioning of authority, 
  lol ... anybody who does n't share your dogoodness has to be `` mean spirited '' ... 
  so , how do you explain `` mean spirited '' conservatists being much more generous with charitable contributions than `` compassionate '' liberals ? 
   the main difference with these guys is there utter disconnect with reality . 
  ... the trait they share with all left-wingers ... well , they ** are ** , essentially , left-wingers who learned some economics ... 
   reality has a liberal bias, 
  only if you look through pink-colored glasses ... , 
   out of curiosity , how do you think you got like this ? 
  you would be surprised ...  i grew up in communist poland and if i were a subject to `` experiment in social engineering '' it were n't the some kind you are thinking of ... 
  according to your understanding of `` reality '' i should be a flaming marksist ... 
  ... and , in all likelihood , it will end up where, 
  avro arrow did ... :(, 
  round enough for me ... , 
   which one wants to keep the war going ? 
  obama 's stance on war is not quite as clear-cut as obamaniacs want us to believe ... 
   he has no problem with social programs , or indeed , with damn near anything , at the state level . 
  he might have a problem with it , he just does n't think it 's something fedgov needs to have a say in ... 
   it seems the new requirement for government work is a complete lack of brain activity, 
  nah , it 's not new ... 
  are you also in favor of mexicans migrating to california ( legally and otherwise ) and then pulling the reconquista ... ? 
  because they do n't want to waste it on barack mcclinton ... ? 
  as opposed to `` i hate gooks ; arabs are all terrists '' mccain ... or `` you fucking jew bastard '' hillary ... ? 
   calling mccain a racist, 
  well , in mccain case his own words are the best indictment ... 
   ron paul is a racist scumbag because of what ron paul says and does, 
  ok , i 'll bite ... what did ron paul ** say ** or ** do ** to earn this honor ... ? 
  btw : stuff that was ** written ** in a newsletter does n't count unless you can prove he actually wrote it ... 
  btw i do n't see you ranting about `` racist scum mccain '' or `` racist scum hillary '' so there must be some agenda involved . . ne ces ' t pas ? 
  hmm ... 
  i can see lot of posts on reddit with mccain or hillary in it , no comments from benw24 , dannykeithjames or any other of his numerous identities denouncing ** their ** racism ... why would ** that ** be ? 
  perhaps danny-boy has some hidden agenda , after all ... 
  sure the other candidates in question are not `` guilty by association '' - you can hear their racist sentiments out of the horse mouths , so to speak ... 
  well , if it quacks like danny-boy it is danny-boy to me ... unless you can prove you are being paid and fed the same talking points ( and even the same ** exact ** phrases ) by the same entity that pays danny-boy ... , 
   you 'll snipe at me , attack me , berate me and argue with me for pointing these things out, 
  perhaps , you being disingenuous at the very least and outright lying at times , might have some bearing on that , danny-boy ... 
  whatever you say ` ben ' ... it kinda hard to believe two different trolls are spamming reddit with the same stuff , targeting the same set of people with the same rhetoric and even the exact same insults addressed to precisely the same individuals ( like calling lew rockwell `` racist toad '' but ron paul `` racist scum '' ) . 
  seems like helluva coincidence to me ... 
  and it addresses your credibility , which at this point is rapidly approaching zero . 
   speak to the substantive issue about ron paul, 
  you could start doing this too , you know ... so far what we hear from you is bunch of invectives ` backed ' by the newsletter ( which name you can not even get right ) controversy and completely disregarding ron paul 's long track record as a congressman , advocate of liberty , and presidential candidate ... 
  nowhere , absolutely nowhere is there ever a hint of him being a racist - quite the opposite , his words and ** actions ** suggest he is not . 
  so do testimonials from his friends , acquaintances , fellow congresscritters , people who worked for him or people who simply met and talked to him . 
  and you latch at a few quotes from the newsletter he did n't even write . 
  on top of it you simply lie about the newsletter itself ( it was being published for over 20 years , there are four or five articles that could be considered as having racist remarks and you call it a `` racist newsletter '' ) or about the stuff that was published there ( like `` endorsement '' of david duke , which you know is bullshit - saying that his popularity in some circles might be due to his sensible economic policies is n't `` endorsement '' any more than pointing out hitler started research connecting smoking to lung cancer can be considered `` endorsement '' of hitler ) . 
  so , ` ben ' , i do n't know - you keep lying about this stuff how can i believe you are n't lying about you being ` ben ' and not ` danny ' ... ? 
  and i thought it was about segway ... 
   do you really swallow the shit milkshake that we are the shining light of democracy still ? 
  just because we are not does n't mean chavez is ... 
  nah , he 's a pig - that 's why other pigs do n't bother him ... 
  if only the government forced us all into labor camps , all our problems would be solved ... 
   fortunately , any human being of free-will can give up and deny his/her membership of the `` de-facto '' incorporated government ( the corporation ) by denial of corporate existence, 
  does n't it give them the excuse to deport you ? 
  he thinks obama is trying to appease him ... ? 
   the election is pointless, 
  ai n't that the truth ... 
   do n't let this happen to the us constitution . 
  it already has ... :(, 
  i 'd like to hope ... do n't see any cpr trained candidates though ... 
   nonscientists cherry-pick the work of ` scientists ', 
  hmm ... did n't we see it somewhere already ... ? 
   what does al gore have to do with anything, 
  well , he also `` cherry-picked the work of ` scientists ' '' ... 
  i do n't see you complaining about ** that ** . 
  and you can not deny his `` work '' had _ some _ influence on the public perception ... 
   when the two tallest buildings in a city collapse , that there is a strong likelihood that it will cause some of the smaller buildings next door to collapse too, 
  the law of conservation of collapse ... ? 
   elections do n't change anything, 
  `` if voting could change anything they would make it illegal ... '', 
   i ca n't imagine driving without a licence, 
  it 's not that different from driving ** with ** license , you know ... , 
   if you ca n't get something as simple as the name of the publication correct , why should i think that the site 's any more correct on the conclusions they draw ? 
  you could try to evaluate the evidence and come to your own conclusion ... 
   the simplest explanation is most often the correct one, 
  well , in this case the `` official '' explanation is neither `` simple '' nor credible ... 
   according to nist, 
  now , is `` popular mechanic '' on some secret list of entities nist reports to ? 
  afaik nist has n't released any official explanation for wtc7 ... 
   `` there was no firefighting in wtc 7 , '' sunder says .
