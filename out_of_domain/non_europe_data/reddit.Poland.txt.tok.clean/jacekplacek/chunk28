  interesting ... because when somebody points out to silverstein 's comment they `` decided to pull it '' all the `` debunkers '' screem it meant to `` pull the firefighters out '' . 
  ca n't the `` debunkers '' get their stories straight ... ? 
  the meaning would be clearer if you used '' - '' ... as it is we do n't know if you meant `` obama-bitch slaps mccain '' or `` obama bitch-slaps mccain '' ... it could go either way ... , 
   what possible benefit could that have ? 
  i mean besides ego-stroking . 
  you mean like submit karma ... ? 
   he 's to [ sic ] extreme and radical in views for any sane american to vote for, 
  he is a pussycat compared to jefferson - guess americans are n't what they used to be anymore ... imo , no sane person would vote for barack mcclinton ... 
   i think i 'll think for myself instead, 
  it might be surprise to you , but process of thinking requires a functional brain ... , 
  `` i would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice !, 
  and let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue ! '', 
   we need farmers , and farming is a high-risk business that needs subsidies to survive in the global market, 
  hell , we need software developers too . 
  how about some nice subsidy for c++ programmers ? 
  i 'll take it ... , 
   i 'm sure nobody at all had any effect on your earnings ,, 
  sure they had ( and still have ) - i 've been taxed all the time ... what , that 's not what you were talking about ... ? 
   and that you never benefitted from living in a society that has ( ostensibly ) been organized for the common good in the first place . 
  you are mistaking government for society ... 
  i think you 've missed my point ...  submit karma has no benefit besides ego-stroking either ... 
   what do you think a reasonable figure for that should be ? 
  '' \u266b ... be thankful i do n't take it all , for i 'm a taxman , yeah i am a taxman ... \u266b '', 
  what do you mean by `` high risk ? '', 
  if you mean you might work hard for half a year and then not get to cash out , yes i 'd say it is high risk ... , 
  hate ? 
  yes !, 
   gore 's lowest grade of d came in a natural sciences course, 
  hmm ... it might explain `` inconvenient truth '' ... 
   while you should be keeping a tab on what you spend , the article is about debit cards, 
  but most important , you should ** never ** use debit cards ... 
   or are you just saying the majority is always blind and unable to think for themselves ? 
  that seems to be the case ... :(, 
  you do n't need citation , just common sense :, 
  if somebody gets hold of your credit card and goes on a shopping spree , you can dispute the charges , with debit card your checks start bouncing before you ever notice ... 
  you may change your mind next time somebody buys bunch of expensive thingies using your debit card ... good luck explaining to your landlord/mortgage holder and others why your checks bounced ... 
  you could n't find a better place to hide ... 
  i dunno , russkies always loved their tzars ... 
   why the hell would a political party change their entire core beliefs for a small minority, 
  i do n't know , why did they ? 
  ( i 'm talking about going with small minority of neocons , for the unaware ), 
  i dunno about that ... 
  i 've seen some crime statistics from mogadishu in the late nineties and the murder rate was much lower than baltimore ... actually the murder ** numbers ** were lower despite mogadishu population being some 5 times that of baltimore ... 
  and people still fear anarchy , go figure . 
  do you ** really ** have to feel proud of belonging to some group ? 
  if so , pick your local volunteer firefighters ... 
  and even more curious - despite pride being one of seven deadly sins , most christian americans say they are proud ... go figure ... , 
  did i say anything about anybody being a `` hero '' ... ? 
  ... unless we figure out how to terraform other planets , or how to get to other stars , or how to build space stations big enough , or ... 
  okey-dokey , when i get my `` life elixir '' working , i 'll make sure you not getting any ... , 
  if you do n't enjoy it why do n't you move there ? 
  it does ? 
  i do n't think so ... if you ** really ** thought they are better off than you , you would move somewhere you could live the same way they do ... 
  why ca n't you ??? 
  it 's pretty simple , really ... 
  oh , you packing already ... ? 
  lol, 
   the gold ( and silver ) standard was not a good idea and is not a good idea . 
  why oh why did n't our ancestors have daniel_sj to correct their ways ? 
  they used gold and silver for millennia and were oblivious to the fact it was n't a good idea ... , 
  if , as you seem to imply , countries are better off with large areas of uninhabited/undeveloped land , why do n't you try to `` restore '' some `` rainforest '' in your country ? 
  just herd all the people in small part of it and let the nature do it 's work ... 
  oh , you enjoy the `` curse '' of civilization too much ... never mind . 
   i assume newegg would n't have to collect the tax ? 
  nope , i 've just got an email from newegg , they say they have to charge ny tax from now on ... :(, 
  fortunately , i 've moved to pa last year , so it does n't affect me ... , 
  yeah , there was one guy like that before you , name was pol-pot or something ... 
  it 's not tiered internet , it 's tiered comcast . 
  switch the isp , if you only have comcast at your place bitch to your politicians who gave comcast a monopoly ... 
  ehmm ... no , actually he wanted to start an agrarian ( primitive ) society ; he was `` into '' slaughter of those he knew would n't fit his ideas ... 
  so , if you want to `` end civilization and return to a primitive lifestyle '' you will have problem with troglodytes like me , who like civilization quite nicely , and would n't be thrilled with being forced into `` primitive lifestyle . '', 
  since i do n't seem to be in minority , your options are n't that clear ... what are your plans for me and `` my ilk '' if not extermination ... ? 
  either way we are fucked ... 
  i told you so ... 
  sad , really ... 
  cynical enough not to believe the `` talk '' when the `` walk '' suggested otherwise ... 
  when you vote for the `` lesser evil '' you end up with evil nevertheless ... 
  this episode is an enlightening example of working of the free market - as you yourself observed , she is probably gon na end up ok , but the owner is gon na hurt . 
  everybody has a right to make stupid decisions and suffer the consequences . 
  and libertarianism does n't have anything to do with `` me , me , me , mine '' - it has everything to do with `` do n't steal my money and pretend you are doing it for my own good '' ... 
   it is the job of the police to enforce the law , whether they agree with it or not . 
  there were guys , a few decades ago in faraway land , who tried to justify their actions by this very argument ... did n't work for them , though ... 
  yeah , but has it been sitting there for over 60 years ... ? 
   where they are banned , it is much safer, 
  ... for the criminals ... 
  if you are a moron who `` accidentally '' shoots his own kids you should n't own a gun ... 
  not a convenient concealed carry item , though ... , 
  would some guy cutting their heads off with samurai sword make it more to your liking ? 
  what 's wrong with prostitution ? 
  did n't it have something to do with willy horton ... ? 
  new species will evolve and old species will adapt ... ? 
   but they are just slightly less in the pockets of corporate interests, 
  nope . 
  they 're in pockets of slightly different corporate interests ... 
  you are right !, 
  the guy comes into our plantation and tells us he will free us . 
  and some mindless niggas fall for it without giving any examples of how it would work in the ` real world ' ... 
  but who is gon na give us food if not massa ? 
  who is gon na give us shelter ? 
  hell , even the shirt i have on my back was given to me by massa !,
