  massa good !, 
  we do n't even get whipped to often !, 
  because filthy pigs stick together ... ? 
  it 's not who votes that counts , it 's who counts the votes ... 
  i know . 
  but it 's not mine . 
  actually you could n't be more wrong ... libertarians have no problem with charity , they have problem with those who like to be `` charitable '' with other people money ... 
  do n't you wankers have digg for your whining ? 
  i guess a concept of `` probable cause '' and `` search warrant '' is beyond your grasp ... 
   never use the eraser . 
  ever . 
  ... unless you are a pedophile posting your pictures on the net ... , 
  she should sue the bastards ... 
  it 's kerosene - not recommended for suvs ... , 
  why ? 
  do you think ammo has a nasty habit of firing randomly ... ? 
   could n't we just control our reproduction and resource use ?

  oh , so if it 's the law it must be right ...

   the fed has successfully averted a collapse of the economy by using its power over monetary policy . 
  hmmm ... how come the economy managed not to collapse before the fed ... ? 
   attaching money 's value to any resource is deflationary , reactionary and utterly destructive . 
  ... and for some strange reason the world managed to run on gold/silver for millennia ... 
  ok , you 've lost me there ... are you saying that `` attaching money to any resource is deflationary , reactionary and utterly destructive '' unless there is a war ? 
  then it becomes stable ? 
  and did you forget about wwii ... ? 
  looks like fiat money ( and it 's consequences ) being one of the major factors in hitler 's rise into power ... 
   in 1941 , despite financial hardship and isolation from * computer scientists * from other western countries , german computer pioneer konrad zuse created the world 's first programmable computer, 
  if it was a first computer , where did he find the `` computer scientists '' to isolate him ... ? 
   one other piece of advice that should be tacked on to the bottom of page 15 : smile . 
  hmm ... would n't offering to lick agent 's ass work too ... ? 
   there are too many good police officers, 
  i must be very unlucky - 90 % of the cops i run into are obnoxious , rude , arrogant assholes ... 
   at some point people also need to be responsible for their own `` medical '' choices . 
  apparently , not very popular sentiment on reddit ... , 
  you should follow your own advice ... are you saying weimar republic hyperinflation had no influence on what followed ... ? 
  oh , so now recession is equivalent to collapse of the economy !, 
  if that 's your metric , the fed failed to `` avert '' it as well ... 
   computer science predates the computer by quite a number of decades, 
  only , it was called `` mathematics '' back then ... , 
  technically , we could impeach both bush and cheney , then she would become a president , and then we could impeach her ... ,

  what good are resources if you do n't use them ? 
  i travel almost every other weekend to toronto and i would consider checking it out ... 
  but ... the stupid thing run at such hours that i could n't get on the last one to toronto friday night and the first one on monday was way too late ...

  so i just drove instead ... 
  how do people board the chunnel trains ? 
  what could possibly go wrong with a big metal cylinder , full of people , flying at over 35000ft and doing close to 500mph ... ? 
  aesthetics ... ? 
  earthquakes ? 
  did n't you mean `` waterquakes '' ? 
  oh yeah , and terrists ... we can not forget terrists, 
  you are , quite likely , the most ignorant entity i ever encountered ... 
  you are welcome . 
  perhaps you should educate yourself on the meaning of the words `` neocon '' and `` libertarian '' ... to confuse you even more there are also `` classical liberals , '' `` paleo-conservatives , '' and `` anarcho-capitalists '' among others ... and no , they are not all neocons ... 
  ecosystem ? 
  what has coal or oil deep underground to do with ecosystem ?

   the governor 's talking about 7-8 billion cubic metres of timber, 
  oh , timber ... you mean the thingie that grows back if you use it ... ? 
   is n't israel a foreign nation ? 
  apparently not ... 
  yes . 
  do you believe the verdict would be the same if they were russians or chinese ... 
   israel 's fights are not us security concerns , never were . 
  yeah , but politicians like to get re-elected , or get nice lobbying jobs after they are not ... 
   how long would you say it takes to grow back, 
  why would that make a difference ? 
  how long does it take to grow back after some natural event like forest fire ? 
   there 's a huge difference between a natural forest and a commercial forest, 
  if you do n't like `` commercial forests '' just let it grow back without interference ... 
   bigot re-enforcing their bigotry, 
  i see , the trump-card of antisemitism ... you run out of arguments ? 
  if this `` legal ruling '' is kosher it should apply to russians and chinese as well , should n't it ... 
  ecosystem is `` permanently altered '' anytime there 's too much rain , or not enough , or a fire or earthquake , or climate change ... so what ? 
  ever heard about heraclitus ? 
  _ panta rei _ , dude , _ panta rei _ ... 
  ask him ... neocon he is definitely not ... 
   if it is anti-semitism motivating you then that is what it is, 
  you do n't know me and even if you did , you would have no bloody idea what motivates me . 
  you are just throwing mud in hope it will stick and take the spotlight off the issue . 
   now do you have anything about law that challenges the ruling or only your views of the ethnicity of the defendants ? 
   it 's not clear how much money bergersen received for the classified information , _ or if he was even aware it was intended for the chinese government _ . 
  or pretty much any other spying case ... or can ** you ** show another case the defendants were awarded such a sweet treatment ... ? 
   why should the money received matter ? 
  it does not . 
  that 's why i did n't emphasize this part of the sentence , unlike the other part which ** does ** matter and goes directly to the heart of the issue ... are you trying to muddy the water again ? 
   or that the judge did not end up applying the same standard . 
  because if he did bergersen 's case would be dismissed by that standard ... 
   one big difference is that the u.s. government does see israel as an ally, 
  today 's ally can become a foe overnight ; besides i do n't think there 's anything in the federal law exculpating spying by allies , is there . 
  the problem is , other accused spies, 
  do n't routinely get such a sweetheart treatment ... 
   make israel the 51st state,
