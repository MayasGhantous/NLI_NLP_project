   data from the ncvs imply that each year there are only about 68,000 defensive uses of guns in connection with assaults and robberies , [ 16 ] or about 80,000 to 82,000 if one adds in uses linked with household burglaries . 
  i do n't really have time , right now , to study it in details but my guess would be there are two factors involved : first - since it 's a `` official '' government survey , people who are not sure about legality of defensive firearms use would be reluctant to talk ( or , in their minds , confess ) about it . 
  even people who know their actions were legal tend to not report such incidents if they did n't have to actually fire . 
  second - i 'm not sure what they mean by `` in connection with assaults and robberies . '', 
  if the assault or robbery was prevented by brandishing a gun is it still `` in connection ? '', 
  same question for burglaries : if you see a guy messing with your back door and show up with a shotgun , making him run away , was it `` linked with household burglary ? '', 
   yeah , that 's it . 
  i 'm a cop . 
  when it quacks like a duck ... , 
  ... which is patently unconstitutional ... 
  nope , that was his stance before he got anywhere close to the nomination . 
  right now his stance is `` all options are on the table . '', 
   diplomacy . 
  ... by other means ? 
  `` just the other day '' decision is kinda ambiguous on this ... what was the first time ? 
  so , where 's the evidence bushevicks promised to disclose long time ago ... ? 
  and what does lockerbie have to do with iran ? 
  hmm ... it makes a twisted sense . 
  if they wanted to oppress blacks , who would be better than black president ? 
  kinda like clinton doing welfare reform or bush introducing another entitlement ... 
   how should i mod ? 
  sideways ... , 
  ... so did israelis ... 
  theory of [ convergence ] ( http://www.economyprofessor.com/economictheories/convergence-theory.php ) ? 
  well , i 've never seen mcgyver episode either but from all the references to it floating around i have pretty good idea what it was all about ... ( or so i think ... , 
   for the palestinians it has been an explicit part of the strategy for over 40 years . 
  hmm ... they learned from the [ best ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irgun ) [ and ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lehi_%28group%29 ) [ and ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haganah ) ... 
  they look like dinos ? 
  now , how come i do n't see any resemblance ... ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  it was a success - just look at the haliburton 's , exxon 's and some others bottom lines ... < / sarcasm , 
  well , muslim brotherhood never ended up being a government ... and what does sharia and dhimmi have to do with the topic ? 
  the problem is most people , when faced with surgery vs snake oil , will ( like you ) pick snake oil ... 
   he ran for president , if that 's not the top fucking office , what is ? 
  uhmm ... he 's ** already ** been in congress for some time now ... 
   and he was honest . 
  ... as far as ** you ** know ... 
  i never said anything about knowing ... 
  i 'm simply pointing out that he has no way of knowing for sure ... obviously , i do n't know either , but his assertion ** he ** knows is baseless . 
  if somebody told you there are unicorns on fourth planet of procyon , you 'd be quite correct pointing out he does n't know that , even though you do n't know either ... 
   it 's based on years of knowing his father , along with whatever he knew about his father 's work life . 
  you do n't believe crooked cops brag about it to their sons , do you . 
   what grounds do you have for believing that his father was crooked ? 
  i 've never said that . 
  as i said before , i do n't know . 
  my issue is with him saying he does know ** for sure ** , which he does n't ... 
  i 'm not so sure ... history does n't question how romans and their senators let the republic go ... 
   it is questionable whether anyone would have standing to raise that claim . 
  would n't other candidates have standing ? 
  am i ? 
  most of the historians consider the age of caesars `` the golden age '' of rome , do n't they ... 
  what ? 
  you believe poor countries should stay poor ? 
  but `` we have always negotiated with eastasia '' does n't have the same ring to it ... 
  funny is in the eye of beholder ... or something like that , 
   bare midriff craze did n't exist in 1980, 
  that 's different 1980 than i remember ... 
  you mean you have a better advice ? 
  so , how do you propose poor country to achieve that ? 
  but sweden was not a poor country ... just because there were poor people there and the economy was in depression for some time did n't make it a poor country . 
  they already had infrastructure , plenty of capital for investments , and well educated , skilled workforce . 
  what would you propose for , let 's say , zimbabwe ... 
  having many poor people does n't make country poor . 
  having no infrastructure does . 
  neither sweden nor norway were poor countries . 
  zimbabwe or haiti are . 
   he acts like a nanny when it comes to our civil liberties and our personal lives . 
  you must have some terrible childhood memories ... , 
  and he shot himself in the head ... ** twice ** !, 
  just like gary webb ... 
  fart if you hate `` vote up if '' posts ... 
  `` it 's better to stay silent and look a fool , rather than speak and remove all doubt . '', 
  _ mark twain _, 
   last time i did interviews it 's hard for a company to round up 5 people to interview . 
  otoh it 's hard for competent programmer to get the interview ... go figure ... 
   ect is used commonly in severe cases of depression . 
  it works ... for some reason . 
  so does lobotomy ... 
  ma bell , anyone ... 
  yeah , but that 's part of `` bread and circuses '' package ... 
  care to elaborate ? 
   anit marijuana, 
  some new strain ... ? 
  so.fucking.what ... 
  i think hukeshy was being sarcastic ... 
   should we have more prostitutes ? 
  no , for obvious fucking reasons . 
  nothing to sneeze at but also nothing to be excited about ... let 's put it that way : if i do n't play lottery i will end up old geezer with extra 70 grand , so i can buy a vip room in the nursing home and better looking coffin . 
  if , otoh , i play the lottery i have a ( microscopic ) chance of being able to quit my job and enjoy early retirement ... 
  i 'm not talking about spending ** all ** my money on lottery ... so , as i said , it 's a difference between regular nursing home and the `` upgraded '' version ... , 
  but you are talking spending $ 1k a year ... that 's not playing lotto , that 's addiction ...  i spend some $ 10 - $ 20 a month ... besides , how do you find mutual fund with 10 % average growth ? 
  it 's not abnormal to love your brother ... , 
  the last time i checked , uefa and ioc are not the same organization ... 
  i hate posters that think it 's acceptable to post stupid comments without permission ... 
  but , in the mean time , nothing is stopping police/council members/concerned public from harassing you ... 
   the pressure must be incredibly high to make the boiling point `` double '', 
  pressure tends to be `` incredibly high '' at the bottom of the ocean ... 
  `` past results are not a guarantee of the future performance ... '', 
   anything less than 4 % loses money to inflation , especially keeping your money in cash . 
  that 's why i spend my money ... ,
