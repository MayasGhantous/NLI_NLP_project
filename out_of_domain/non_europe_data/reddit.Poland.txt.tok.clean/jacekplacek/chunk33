  what 's wrong with booze and guns ? 
  what kind of argument did you expect ? 
  there are people saying obama is a muslim - what would you say to them ? 
   see , i clearly defined and defended my points . 
  nope . 
  not even close . 
  citing clueless journalist is not an argument . 
   you made an unsupported assertion . 
  if you made an effort to actually learn about ron paul 's policies , you would n't fall for `` ron paul wants to [ ... ] truncate trade '' . 
  my assertions are based on actually ** knowing ** ron paul 's stance . 
   i never cited any journalist . 
  so whom did you cite ? 
  yourself ? 
  you should make it clear , then . 
  still it was very short on facts and long on hype . 
  and it did show you have no idea what you 're talking about ... 
  so.fucking.what ... 
  you do n't mess with teletubbies ... , 
  did n't know they were running for the supreme court ... 
  yeah . 
  right . 
  nah , they 've been drinking this stuff since well before the first tsar ; and their population was doing just fine till now ... 
  oh yeah ... they just discovered vodka last year ... 
   russians have never been consuming this much alcohol before , this is a new record, 
  [ _ citation needed _ ], 
  so , did you read it ? 
  it says it 's a ** world record ** , does n't say it 's all time high for russia ... ( it is higher than last year for `` legally '' produced vodka ), 
   not really practical for anything but sightseeing . 
  ... or commuting ... 
   fanny mae and freddy mac are n't governmental entities . 
  no , they are entities ** created ** by the government , with the specific purpose of granting loans to unqualified buyers , and having those loans ** guaranteed ** by the government . 
  iow they did the job they were supposed to do ... iow the are the scapegoats . 
   voting independent will only result in mccain 's victory . 
  is it so ? 
  you do n't want me to vote third party ? 
  are you sure ? 
  _ hint : i will not vote democrat _ ... 
   why does n't he do it ? 
  because he said he would n't ? 
  some people have integrity , you know ... 
  your word might not mean much to you , but to some people their word does ... 
  are you being sarcastic ? 
   do n't get mad when the right uses that power to serve their goals, 
  ... or the left , for that matter ... 
  reading comprehension problems ? 
  why ? 
  obama is mccain 's satellite ... ? 
  beats me ... 
  `` if voting could change anything they would make it illegal ... '', 
  big fan of stalin , eh ? 
  what 's the difference between `` licit '' and `` illicit '' sex ? 
  hmm ... let him run for gensek of un ... 
  no , we really , really , ** really ** want a vp who gave us drug czar and the patriot act ... 
  nope . 
  joe biden is ... , 
  ... and the more you whine , the more popular she becomes ... 
  i have no problem with russia . 
  putin , otoh ... 
  my guess : people start to notice what whiny bitches democrats are ... 
  do you want some cheese with that whine ... ? 
  i thought it was clueless democrats who are doing that ... 
  so , she ** is ** for a smaller government ... ? 
  universal slavery ... lol, 
  lol ... biden is one of the diners himself ... 
  well , one out of two ai n't bad ... 
  ... and biden/obama 's response is straight out of fdr playbook ... we are for the loooong road to recovery ... wwiii anybody ? 
  if they told you they would have to kill you ... , 
  well , they were excluded from some state 's ballots because of the government red tape ... what sauce for a goose ... 
  done . 
  got bubba and billy-bob ... , 
  show them what ? 
  wishful thinking ... 
  they both suck ... 
  typical ... 
  it 's not a bug , it 's a feature ... 
  because the alternative is even worse ... ? 
  anyone who intends to vote for either left or right wing of `` boot on your neck '' party should n't be allowed to vote ... 
  that 's `` lisa 's something '' , not a chili ... 
  over , less , neither . 
  how do they do that ? 
  i thought peron was the one to fuck you up bad and you kept electing fuckers since ... 
  if you think your money is better off in the hands of the bankers , just give it to them yourself ... 
  are you really ** that ** naive ... ? 
   this has turned into a fucking tv show !, 
  that 's where it belongs ... 
  quite the contrary ... 
  how ? 
  obamaniacs do n't have guns ... , 
  mccaniacs , obamaniacs - they are all delusional anyway ... , 
  lamer than lame, 
   unfortunately , in places like iran , they have to by law or suffer severe punishment , which destroys your argument, 
  how is it different from woman in florida having to wear a bra or suffer punishment ? 
  you do realize , the same exact argument could be made by iranian mullah ... ? 
  to blame ? 
  to credit , i 'd say ... 
  because it 's still the cheapest energy source ... ? 
  who the fuck cares ? 
  hmmm ... what if i think ** progressives ** are full of shit too ... ? 
  obamajugend ? 
   a game warden tranquilized the mountain lion and the animal was relocated .
