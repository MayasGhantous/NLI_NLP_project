  tweedledum or tweedledee ... 
  on a bright side , she will be out of the indoctrination center ( otherwise known as `` public school '' ) for a year . 
  most likely she will only benefit from that . 
  homeschool her for this year , perhaps you will discover she can learn much more that way ; and wo n't send her back ... 
  under carter ... ( not to mention fdr . ), 
  perhaps they simply are too stupid to figure out where to post ? 
   small business needs good government, 
  small business needs government to stay out of the way , they 're not getting that with either party , rhetoric notwithstanding . 
   and they are not getting it, 
  oh , yes . 
  they 're getting it good and hard ... 
   taxes are investments, 
  the kind of investments people are ** forced ** to make at the barrel of the gun ... ? 
  if i write 18 pages tex on comprehensive disability policy and hire two teams of disability advisers , will you vote for me ? 
  so , if the idiot driving his yaris and texting at the same time , hits me head on in my suv , he 's got a better chances of dying than me . 
  what you are saying is : i should switch to yaris to even the chances , do n't you . 
  would obama allow rush limbaugh on his plane ... ? 
  yeah , i know . 
  limbaugh is much more successful ... 
  hmm ... and three days after grand opening , los angeles gets cooked , because the software module responsible for beam correction was written using degrees of angle , while the rest of the software was using radians ... 
  resistance ? 
  you really think bitching on reddit is resistance ... ? 
  so pick your yardstick ... ok , i guess if obscurity is a metric , klein wins ... 
  that 's nothing , try to steal a [ bridge ] ( http://blogs.usatoday.com/ondeadline/2008/02/railroad-bridge.html ) ... , 
  yup . 
  they both are . 
  maybe just hungry ... 
  i never thought someone could be so completely lacking any trace of sense of humor ... 
  he never had much chances . 
  all the people i know who will vote mccain will do it holding their noses . 
  otoh most of the obama supporters are convinced he is a mix between superman and jesus christ ( or muhammad , or moses , or krishna ... ), 
  that 's why i really fear for this country . 
  iow cia wants obama ... 
  obamaniacs : whom will you blame after your messiah wins ? 
   did you write that yourself ? 
  nope . 
  my evil twin did . 
   i have not heard anyone jokingly call obama the messiah before !, 
  not quite jokingly , the obamaniacs revere him as one , without actually calling him that ... 
   you are so clever !, 
  why , thank you . 
  good riddance !, 
  he looks more like scared shitless ... 
  do n't you know there 're no conspiracies !, 
  if there were a conspiracy then somebody would spill the beans . 
  therefore anybody who spills the beans must be tin-foil hat nut , because there 're no conspiracies . 
  if they do n't like it , they can still perform self-late-term-abortion ... 
  you are wrong . 
  they are in hands of whoever is counting the votes ... that means diebold ... 
  yeah !, 
  let 's try the soviet system , it worked so well ... 
  she needs to marry into kennedy clan to be qualified ... , 
  iow , you want to mix shit with the honey and think that if there 's only `` reasonable '' amount of shit , honey will improve ... 
  but 30 * .59 ! = 10.00 ... 
  socialist policies benefit only those in charge . 
  you are bitching about switzerland following _ ius sanguini _ , but it 's far from being the only country doing so ... why do n't you bitch about most of the rest of europe ? 
  rich do n't care , you should ... 
  hmm ... if you look at unemployment figures for each of those administrations , it does n't seem to match `` job creation '' figures ... 
  perhaps more people start their own businesses under market friendly presidents , and more small businesses go belly up ( owners going to work for somebody else ) under socialist ones ... 
  good question . 
  fascist perhaps ? 
  ( that means closer to socialist than market friendly . ), 
  now they only have to realize neither do democrats ... 
  why would they be ? 
  so you 're not using any of the services provided by the mafia , which are paid for by `` protection '' fees ? 
  as long as there is a mafia , there will be protection fees . 
  are you advocating the abolition of mafia ? 
  i see a greater evil in the absence of mafia , with no protection . 
  one of the greatest political philosophies coming out of the prohibition - corleonism - recognizes that the protection is a public power , not a private one . 
  and thus , you benefit from the protection by the mafia , and i think it is evil that anyone would not want to pay their fair share for this vital service . 
  left wingers seem to be awfully insecure in their believes ... 
  there 's much more pro obama , anti mccain/palin `` spam '' on reddit than anti obama , yet the right wingers do n't whine about it . 
  but it looks to me like there 's more whining about reddit-man than the actual reddit-man posts ... 
  hey , left wingnuts , grow some balls ... 
  what 's wrong with uzi ? 
   guns are uni-taskers . 
  they do one thing . 
  they kill things . 
  that 's all they 're for . 
  they must have sold me bunch of lemons !, 
  not even one of my guns ever killed anything !, 
  ( other than paper targets ), 
  contrary to popular believes , uzi is not the `` machine gun '' - it 's a pistol , full auto pistol . 
  iow , do n't ban what hhh333 likes , ban what other people like ... 
  he probably counts 17 year old gangstas , shooting each other over drug turf , children ... 
  automatic weapons ? 
  thousands every year ? 
  what sci-fi novel did you creep out ... 
   you said automatic weapons . 
  i did ? 
  here 's a citation from your post i was responding to :, 
   can you name any other ` sporting ' device that causes so many deaths as ** automatic weapons ** do ? 
  [ _ emphasis mine _ ], 
  so , not only you can not remember what you write , you are even apparently unable to read what you wrote ... 
  really ? 
  i do n't intend to shoot at anything other than paper targets and never did , and the `` practice '' part is to be able to hit the paper target closer to the center ... 
  is it possible you 're projecting your own fears/desires on others ... ? 
   it might be technically different , but the result is the same . 
  hmm . . this is a [ machine gun ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m2_browning_machine_gun ) and this is [ uzi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uzi_submachine_gun ) , the difference is quite more than just `` technically '' and the results ( of shooting one at some target ) are definitely not the same ... 
   the key to why this analogy is idiotic is to understand what `` services '' are being provided and who benefits .
