  exactly !, 
  in both cases the `` services '' are bogus and the only beneficiary is the provider . 
   the mafia are n't protecting the rights of the business owners from harm from others, 
  sure they do . 
  like any other government they hate competition . 
   but rather demanding tribute , preventing harm that they themselves would cause . 
  lol . 
  kinda like your government threatening you with jackbooted thugs throwing you into jail or shooting you dead , if you do n't pay their taxes ( protection money ) , _ ne c'est pas _ ? 
   these people are n't elected to the positions they hold , and hold power through the principle of might makes right . 
  so , if the local mafia started holding elections ( letting you choose between don leone and don vito ) you would n't have any problem with them ? 
   and yes , i would pay my fair share to keep it that way !, 
  that 's your right and i would n't dream of doing anything to prevent you from doing just that . 
  tell me one thing though . 
  why do you feel the need to send armed thugs to my home if i do n't subscribe to your particular `` newsletter '' ? 
  sure , i ignore links to forthechildrun.org and other such ... 
  the issue here is your misleading and ignorant statements . 
  there 're hardly any children deaths from the automatic weapons , let alone thousands a year . 
   technically i think it would have been safer for this kid to shoot with that machine gun than with the uzi, 
  you 're most likely right . 
  the others around him , though ... 
  yeah , i was just kidding ... , 
   does this include convicted felons too ? 
  why not ? 
  should mcdonald 's refuse serving big macs to convicted felons ? 
  well , you have nothing to fear from me ... what i meant is perhaps you do n't trust yourself to be responsible enough to be around guns ... or have homicidal thoughts ... 
  oh , jim cavanaugh the brave slayer of the dreaded waco children ... 
  let 's see , according to [ dept of justice ] ( http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/glance/tables/frmdth.htm ) in the year 2001 246 children died due to firearm homicide and 76 due to firearm accident ... nah , doj has to be lying , obviously savethechildrun.org is much more credible ... 
  they do n't have to , and very often are not ... although they might resent having their money taken from them at gunpoint and then spent on such worthy cases as sen. porkbringer memorial bridge to nowhere , bombing the brown children in fallujah , or the benevolent ruler of sierra obscura dr. obongo 's retirement fund ... 
  republican neocons ? 
  last time i checked , it was firmly in hands of democrats ... 
  somebody stupid enough to fall for this should n't be allowed to vote anyway ... 
  hmm ... 
  i 'm not sure what you 're saying ... either the dc democrats are gullible enough to swallow it , or they are gutless yes-men ... 
  brought you by jim cavanaugh , the life-long attention whore , the same guy who lied to the judge to obtain search warrant for the branch davidians ... no he would n't be making anything up , would he . 
  why ? 
  hmm ... the bible says `` spread ** your ** wealth '' not somebody else 's, 
  oh , i would never try to excuse neocons , they are despicable scum . 
  but we can not blame them for what democrats do ... 
  perhaps nobody checked , because everybody assumed somebody else has ... ? 
  is [ elvisliveson ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/elvisliveson/ ) actually the obama campaign or the dnc ... ? 
  jesus was talking of spreading ** your own ** wealth , not other people 's ... 
  i 'm sick and tired of assholes ( like you ) willing to steal my money to feel good about themselves . 
  as if four years of obama/biden were any more appealing ... 
  oh and `` hope '' too , do n't you know ... 
  what ? 
  your attention span is n't long enough to read more than one slogan at the time ? 
  yeah , soviet union and eastern europe had all of those ... 
  he did n't say `` render unto caesar whatever he demands '' did he ? 
  i guess founding fathers were godless heretics then , they stuck it to the caesar instead of `` rendering '' ... , 
  earth to waxman : it was n't taxpayers who `` injected '' the capital , it was assholes like you ... 
  you 're missing one crucial point : it was all ** voluntary ** , jesus did n't send jackbooted thugs to the `` possessors of lands or houses '' to extract their contributions ... 
  he did n't say `` go and strip the shirt from the backs of those who have two , and steal the food from those who have it '' ... but for dimwits like yourself it 's probably too complicated to comprehend . 
  nobody has any problems with ** voluntary ** socialism ( other than it 's not going to ever work too well , but that 's up to the practitioners to realize ) , what we have a ** big ** problem with is hordes of jackbooted thugs shoving it down our throats ... ( obama 's and mccain 's promise . ), 
  perhaps , because you are one of the volunteers ... 
  i have no problem with that , my problem is you sending the jackboots to volunteer me ... 
   we vote . 
  everything is voluntary , in the big picture . 
  lol , voluntary like in the mugger telling me `` your money or your life '' ... 
  will you refund if my taxes go up ? 
  i find the whining obamaniacs much more depressing ... 
  but i want a pony !, 
  that would scare my daughter to death ... she would think i got an alzheimer . 
   the gold block will be returned to the government of iraq in the coming weeks . 
  `` returned '' ? 
  how do they know it ever belonged to the iraqi government ? 
  well , you might get both ... look up the thingies moses brought down from the mountain ... 
  why should they ? 
  neither candidate is going to change that ... 
  we are fucked . 
  ** every ** election system is a sick joke ... 
  so was [ hitler ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nazi_germany#economy ) ... 
  obviously , he was just an impersonator ... tim robbins said he would leave us if dubya won , last time around ... 
  well , obamaniacs take pa for granted ... maybe they should n't . 
  unfortunately , there 's no good coffee around here , so i have to settle for sb ... 
  ok , how come every time you hear democrats scream about the `` vote fraud '' it turns out to be something that only a complete moron would fall for ... ? 
  do democrats consider morons a significant constituency ? 
  pluck the fuckers ... !, 
  forgive me father for i have sinned ... 
  ... because your vote ** does not ** matter ... 
  if he goes the fdr route - yes ... in 10 years ... 
  specifics ? 
  you want specifics ?!, 
  you ca n't handle specifics !!, 
  another bunch of parasites the suckers ( taxpayers ) will have to support ... 
  shooting to be a next leni riefenstahl ... ? 
  ... only if you have any ... 
  yeah , right ... 
  can i have fries ** with ** bacon ? 
  lol ... there are the laws for us peasants , and there are the laws for our lords ... 
  do n't you dare to smear our beloved f\u00fchrer ... 
  i mean leader ... 
  see the red parts ? 
  that 's where the people live who know food does n't come from grocery store . 
  they know that if you fleece your sheep in december they not gon na survive the winter . 
  they know that to get the harvest you have to sow first . 
  they know the gubmint is n't going bring them rain during the drought . 
  they know they have to work hard to make a living . 
  see the blue parts ? 
  that 's where the clueless live . 
  they think government is going to feed them and pamper them and wipe their asses ... no wonder they vote liberal .
