  that 's why he is not going to do anything ... 
  yup . 
  people know he will be in the office soon , so they rather take their toys and go home than have their toys redistributed ... 
   those blue parts are also where we design technology to take us to the moon and let you stare into a monitor and type on a keyboard and punch out your stupid little scrawl . 
  sure , some 5 % have a clue ... 
   not everyone in the city is clueless to the ways of the farmer, 
  or so you think ... you seem to be clueless to the ways of the ** reality ** ... you see , you believe it has a liberal bias ... 
   those of us who are caucasian in the city are also significantly less fearful of non-white people . 
  less fearful than who ... ? 
   go live in the city for several years . 
  learn more about people than sheep , or vote for policies that only affect sheep . 
  i do n't know dick about the sheep , but i do n't want the politicians to be in charge of rising them either - we 'd run out of wool pretty soon ... 
  you see , you are clueless thinking the politicians have the will and the ability to wipe your ass . 
  they do n't have either . 
  all they know how to do is to fleece you , and you keep thinking they are doing you a favor ... ( with the global warming , and all , 
  baaaa !, 
  o ** baaaa ** ma ! , o ** baaaa ** ma ! ... 
  `` qualified officials '' ? 
  iow , old political whores ... 
  `` ask not what your kennedy can do for you , ask what you can do for your kennedy ... '', 
  the biggest problem of politics : everybody knows the other party candidate is a psychopathic , power hungry asshole . 
  but they fail to realize their candidate is too ... 
   trained and educated foreign service officers, 
  same thing, 
  gives credence to the claims that iq ! = wisdom ... 
  so , hutus had the right to decide it 's their right to slaughter tutsis ... ? 
  oh , they do ? 
  does it mean they will end ** unconstitutional ** drugs prohibition ? 
  what about the 2nd ? 
  will they end all the ** unconstitutional ** victim disarmament laws ? ... 
  did n't think so . 
   in roosevelt 's famous first hundred days , fdr launched dozens of initiatives . 
  within just over three months , fifteen pieces of landmark legislation had passed congress and remade the relationship between economy and government . 
  ... and made sure the depression kept going strong for another 10 years ... 
  ok , `` wipe your ass '' was just a figure of speech ... but you know what i mean . 
  sure , i do n't know you and did n't even look at your comment history , i 'm just judging your comment on its face value . 
  so , let me rephrase what i 've said : `` you are clueless thinking the politicians have the will and the ability to give you whatever the hell you want . 
  they do n't have either . 
  all they know how to do is to fleece you , and you keep thinking they are doing you a favor ... '', 
  6 month is still a puppy ... 
  seems like the case of the psychopathic asshole snapping ... 
  lol ... in left wingnuts ' minds , bigotry is ok if directed at the right wingnuts ... 
  but is n't that a prevailing sentiment in this country ( or the world ) ? 
  at least some people realized it 's a giant scam ... 
  sure they will ... messiah can do no wrong ... 
  who the fuck came up with the `` african american ? '', 
  are there `` european americans ? '', 
  are indians `` american americans ? '', 
  somehow reminds me the `` moving stories '' from soviet union , celebrating stalin ... :(, 
  ole mitt prepares the ground for 2012 already ? 
  no wonder , young people are more gullible , plus they did n't have chance to recover from brainwashing received at indoctrination centers ( aka public schools ) yet ... 
  uhmm ... the whole bailout thingie was supported by many more democraps than repugnicans ... 
  same way ? 
  first of all , < ethnicity  american is hardly ever used and only by `` politically correct '' crowd - most often people call themselves `` italian '' or `` irish '' ( `` jewish '' being another case altogether , it can mean ethnicity or religion ) . 
  second , there 's no such thing as `` african '' ethnicity - if you insist , start talking about kenyan american , or somalian american , or better yet about zulu american or masai american ... 
  kinda , that 's my point ... , 
  uhmm ... he 's gon na make trains run on time ... ? 
  yes . 
  maybe it wake her up ... 
  they gon na get the bill instead ... 
   but this is what anarchism has been about since it developed as a political theory in the 19th century, 
  only if you disregard those anarchists who were n't ... 
   i had to do everything myself !, 
  perhaps people figured out ** your ** goals are n't necessary their goals ... so they actually achieved a lot : they thwarted the next stalin in his very beginning ... , 
   everyone who moderates pics is a camera, 
  some of them are photoshops , and there is even occasional gimp or two ... , 
  oh , you mean they made this stuff all up ... ? 
  hey , this is reddit - anybody who is not living in their mothers ' basements is an evil capitalist pig ... , 
   you ca n't run as a change-maker and then look to give the country more of the same . 
  well , he just did ... 
  well , he just did ... , 
  sam i am ... , 
   well you know that whole theory about monkeys typing shakespeare ? 
  internet has proven this theory false ... , 
   if they are n't performing then why a bonus ? 
  what do you mean `` they are n't performing ? '', 
  they just secured billions of $ s in free money !, 
  what ??!!, 
  ... said pol pot ... 
  interesting theory ... so , how come most of the assholes who voted for the bailout got reelected ... ? 
  oh , we can not trust the isps ( which we can change if they do n't deliver the service we want ) but we can trust the government ... 
   but as the last election proved , if we do n't like who 's in power we can veto them out . 
  ... like we did with the assholes who voted for the bailout ... ? 
   the isps are private companies , we do n't get a say of who 's in charge of them or what the tell their lobbyists to say or do, 
  sure , but we ** can ** easily `` vote them out '' by refusing to do business with them . 
  what do you mean `` ca n't change their isp ? '', 
  in the worst case scenario you can always go with the good ole phone/modem setup ... 
  and `` can change their government ? '', 
  let 's see , before the bailout bill some 80 % of americans were opposed to it , yet the assholes who pushed it through got reelected ... so much for the change < / snicker , 
  and when did i say it was ... ? 
  so , iow : government does n't allow the competition , we have no ( meaningful ) choice in isps , therefore we need more government intervention ? 
  roads are supposed to be paid by the gas taxes / registration fees . 
  schools are supposed to be paid by the ( local ) property taxes ... 
  you ca n't have people making derogatory remarks towards the messiah ... 
   oh , yes , because the appropriate response to a broken system is to become violent toward the peons who enforce it , not the people at the top ? 
  `` i was only following orders '' is not a valid defense ... 
  you are again ignoring the point . 
  to put it bluntly : `` you are a stalinist because you are leftist and stalin was leftist '' ... does it sound about right to you ? 
  you should really sometimes try to figure out a thing or two about your enemies before you start talking nonsense . 
  tac was from its very beginning anti-bush and ** never ** supported `` all of the bullshit that he did '' ...
