  you still do n't get it ... tac is `` right '' but it 's very different `` right '' than bush 's neocons ... they did n't vote for bush , they were ** always ** opposed to him . 
  i hope they 're gon na bury it for good ... 
   it was the same under clinton , when the world `` loved '' the us . 
  everything the us did , only the negatives could be seen, 
  ferinstance ... ? 
  hey , be grateful the shoe-bomber idiot did n't stuff the explosives up his ass ... 
  yeah , but the fetish hs dudes developed after that might not be as amusing ... 
   the nose is cartilage . 
  not the whole nose ... about half of it is honest-to-god bone . 
   anyone know how he got it ? 
  tried to hit on someone else 's broad ... ? 
  ( he was n't born a monk . ), 
  perhaps the newscritters do n't , generally , have a grasp of basic facts of life ... ? 
  because we are ** omnivores ** , perhaps ... ? 
   ever wonder why we get sick if we eat raw meat ? 
  we do ? 
  i love steak tartare and i haven got sick yet ... 
   once you convince significantly more than five percent of the populace to go along with you , i 'll think about it . 
  the only way this could happen is if more people started to think and started voting for third parties . 
  at some point even the joe-sixpacks would notice there 's a chance a third party candidate might make a difference ... 
  but that 's only the theory , in practice as soon as this started happening they would change the laws to make it impossible ... :(, 
  at last somebody uses the money sensibly ... 
  you really did have any doubts ? 
  [ there is ] ( http://www.newegg.com/product/productlist.aspx?submit=ene&amp;n=2010380048%201305520548%20106791921%201067924922&amp;name=geforce%208800%20gts ) ... 
  are they nutriatious ... ? 
  i 'm not quite sure who is a ( bigger ) dick here . 
  his religion requires him to wear a turban , their religion requires no headgear in their church ... 
  he _ threatened _ to pack the supreme court ... 
  what 's awesome about it ? 
  so much decent beer wasted :(, 
  the guy had some 30 + years before him as a lawyer , how much would he make in those 30 + years ? 
  linky no worky ... 
   murdering machine, 
  well , pandas are herbivores ... 
  notice i only took exception to beckermt 's characterization of panda as a `` murdering machine '' ... 
  it should be pretty obvious all wild animals ( esp . 
  the big ones ) can be dangerous . 
   was not going into a church service, 
  would you excuse somebody going into mosque with his shoes on , if it was n't for praying ... ? 
  tony blair is an iraqi president ? 
  specialization is for insects ... 
   why would they want everyone circumcised ? 
  would n't that make it harder to differentiate jews and non-jews ? 
  insurance policy ? 
  in nazi germany the baddies often checked men 's dicks to find jews that were hiding ... 
   everybody is looking for a leader, 
  projecting much ... ? 
   an ideal medium of exchange =  infinite money velocity . 
  so , mugabe achieved something pretty close to ideal ... ? 
  yes . 
  it 's getting hard to find one nowadays ... perhaps holland , finland , costa rica ... 
  good indicator : if the policeman can tell you `` papieren , bitte '' without a reason , it 's a police state ... 
  yes . 
   america is not a police state . 
  ok , so what 's ** your ** definition of the police state ? 
   in follow-up visits to homes and villages , unicef discovered that the `` children went looking for new sources of income , and found them in work such as stone-crushing , street hustling and prostitution, 
  for the same reason , certain other wack-jobs on reddit continuously post left-wing smears and lies ... ? 
  hmmm ... and after the ok city bombing , media could n't say the `` c-word '' either ... 
  perhaps the religion of the culprits does n't have as much importance as some would like to believe ... 
  he tried president , then he tried prime minister - he should try tsar next ... 
  regan & the bushes ???!!!, 
  clinton did n't do `` war on drugs '' ... ? 
  kinda missed that ... 
   whoever gets to control the printing of this currency has unlimited power, 
  only if it 's the fiat currency ... gold is not too easy to print ... , 
  hey , what 's the pba card ? 
  i want one like it myself ... , 
   most cases like this you wo n't see because either the person really did grow marijuana ( which does n't make the raid legal but does n't directly contradict the lies they used to get the warrant ) or did n't but the police still somehow managed to find drugs to provide a justification for the raid . 
  or , simply , they said `` oops '' and left ... the homeowner would n't have any proof they did anything illegal and you would n't read about it on reddit ... 
  should there be a country for gypsies ? 
  if not , why ; if yes , will you volunteer your land ? 
  oh , and you 're gon na live forever ... ? 
  they ** did ** have their own land ... before brits `` volunteered '' it to the bunch of eastern europeans ... 
  i hail from eastern europe , so i guess that makes me a `` burly native '' ... ? 
  i said they had their own ** land ** , did n't say they had their own state ... 
  they are nomadic people , they do n't want their own country , i guess ... 
   i glanced about the room while reading that , just in case any rare african wasps were nearby . 
  are you a cockroach , by any chance ... ? 
  hmm ... it 's still pretty hard to stuff your hard drive into the dvd player ... 
  is n't carbon dating only good for thingies that have their carbon from atmospheric co \u2082 ? 
  if the oil is abiotic carbon dating is useless ... 
   oil comes from organics being broken down over time to their root makeup, 
  well , that 's the prevailing theory ... but the competing theory assumes abiotic origins . 
  when op asked if `` planet is still making it '' i assumed he wanted to figure out which theory is correct . 
  edit : on a second thought , if that 's what op wanted , it might be not a bad idea : if there 's any \u00b9\u2074 c in the oil , it would prove its biotic origin . 
  although if there 's none it 's still possible it just fizzled away over time ... , 
  right on !, 
  prophet algor did n't invent the internet , he ** created ** it !, 
   during my service in the united states congress , i took the initiative in creating the internet, 
  hmm ... that 's what i quoted from ... 
  you a bot ? 
  or just an idiot ? 
   you wo n't hear it brought up in respectable gun control circles , but the aim of restricting weapons sales has never been safety , reducing gun crime or some other lefty bullshit like that . 
  no , it has always been about preventing armed rebellion against an unpopular government . 
  now , the russian jew understands that , why the hell americans ca n't ... 
  why would they want to do that ? 
  nobody pays any attention to constitution anymore anyways ... 
  they got it all wrong . 
  the universe is , actually , god 's nightmare ... when he wakes up it will end . 
  could be done if we eliminated 99.9999 % of the laws ... if the golden rule was the only law we would n't need lawyers .
