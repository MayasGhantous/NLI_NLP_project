  if you are not a dfa your decision process might not be computable ... 
   you quoted him expressing his support for it, 
  reading comprehension problems ? 
  doma would be a constitutional amendment and therefore binding for all states ... `` ensures that the authority to regulate marriage remains with individual states and communities '' says the opposite ... 
   the courts have never ruled such a thing , nor is there any indication they ever would . 
  if the doma did pass , they most definitely would ... 
  he never had them in the first place ... 
  perhaps . 
  i bet you there were gestapo dudes that were pretty nice and decent too ... 
  ok , i did mix up doma with marriage amendment ... 
  the amendment was what i was thinking about , and if you go back , re-read the thread you will pretty much know my position . 
  and i do know ron paul 's stance on most of the things we are talking about , sure he is pro life , sure he is anti gay marriage ... so fucking what ?!, 
  he wants federal government out of these and , since he is ** in ** federal legislature , his views on these topics are completely irrelevant ... you might not like him , just do n't elect him to any state office ... 
  that was back then when they were still flexing their muscles , so to speak , they had to pretend being `` good guys '' ... 
  i sure would like it much better if dubya had to go to every state to get the patriot act up and running ... 
   that 's highly controversial and counts as magic . 
  me picking what to have for diner counts as magic ?!, 
  wow !, 
  i like that ... , 
   you 're pretending we have free will when you ca n't even define it . 
  there 's lot of things in the universe we can not define ... 
   every process on turing machine that halts i.e. 
  actually makes a decision can be emulated on a dfas and is anyway by definition computable . 
  is n't that what i 've said ? 
  if we are dfas ( turing machines are equivalent ) then we are obviously computable and can not have free will ... 
  if we are something more , though ... 
   even if we are oracles it does n't matter . 
  the instructions for prediction run as follows :, 
   1 ) make person . 
   2 ) initialize them correctly . 
   3 ) query person . 
  works only if the `` person '' is deterministic , _ ne c'est pas _ ? 
   there 's no need to use the idea of computable . 
  oh , but there is . 
  if the `` person '' is not computable , you will have a hard time creating it ... 
  you are kinda arguing in circles - trying to prove we are dfas by assuming as much ... 
  ok , still you would n't object to somebody saying `` fuck gestapo '' , would you . 
  [ really ?

   of course it 's a bad thing for those who live in the us, 
  not necessary , it could be just the collapse of us government ... bad thing only for those ** in ** the government . 
   america has been tacitly telling these companies to build gas guzzlers for decades by , yes , buying them . 
  so , how come the nissan , honda and toyota are not going belly up ... ? 
  only , schiff has been right more times than not ... even when the other `` pundits '' laughed at him . 
  you are quite welcome to help the environment and jump off the bridge ... 
   my parents did n't have to much trouble . 
  but they would have a real problem creating two copies of you that would act ** exactly ** the same in every circumstance ... 
   your decisions can be arbitrary or determined , and that is it . 
  i see you have abandoned `` random '' and use `` arbitrary '' instead ... yeah , in a sense it is arbitrary but can be for a reason ... or not . 
  that 's what _ free will _ means . 
  i cook without ever measuring anything or following any recipes . 
  i might look at one to get a feeling what it is but then will do my stuff the way i always do ... 
  i 'm not a chef but people still do like my cooking . 
  the real problem begins when somebody asks me for a recipe ... they think i 'm an asshole and do n't want to share ... , 
  _ fitna _ does suck but it 's not a reason to ban it . 
  what make you think there is [ none ] ( http://christiansagainstiraqwar.blogspot.com/ ) ? 
  but you get what you pay for ... 
   then again i always laugh when i see some celebrity wearing a hugo boss item too , because those bastards got rich making the uniforms for the ss and the nazi youth . 
  but you have to admit their uniforms were much better looking than anybody else 's ... 
  was it a revenge for all the squirrels you have bbqed ... ? 
  they do ? 
  dunno , my friend in canada had to wait about six months for an mri , coworker here in us got the same mri scheduled two days in advance ... 
  hell , in the same canada you can get mri for your dog or horse scheduled in no time !, 
  mary of nazarene was eleven when the holly ghost had his way with her . 
  is holly ghost a pedophile ? 
  was n't she twelve when she gave birth ? 
  i thought that was the dude 's name ... , 
  hmm ... 
  i have seen this number floating around but quick google does n't bring any solid citations ... so , yeah , i could be wrong ... , 
  there 's a theory that when the mother is more horny during conception there 's better chance of conceiving a boy and _ vice versa _ . 
  if it 's true , it makes sense that during the war women are n't getting as much ( consensual ) sex as usual and are more horny - hence more boys ... 
  politicians almost always get away with much more than any average joe would ... people are gullible enough to think they are benevolent public servants and would n't ever do anything wrong . 
  usually , the opposite is true - sociopaths have a great advantage over everybody else when political career is concerned ... 
  just because he ( the truck owner ) is anti obama does n't mean he was pro bush ... 
  i do n't doubt you are a decent guy for a mayan ... ,

  [ these ] ( http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/01/01/mnb9152i2q.dtl&amp;tsp=1 ) police officers ? 
   however , there has never been a confirmed case of retrograde amnesia which includes loss of identity aka `` soap opera amnesia '' . 
  hmm ... so , i guess , you are dismissing bk 's case on the grounds of `` there has never been a confirmed case '' - iow , his case is not `` confirmed '' therefore if there 's another such case it will also be dismissed . 
  so , how do you get `` confirmed '' cases ? 
   large hydrocarbon chains however are a different story,

   i think the way to cause the downfall the speed camera system is with lawsuits, 
  nah , .22 is much more fun and as effective ... , 
   it 's purgery, 
  i am curios how much improvement in accuracy can it buy you ? 
  is a smoothbore any good at distance over , let 's say 50yds ?

  sounds like presumed guilty to me . 
  on/off switch ? 
   lack of reguatory oversight was the cause of the current crisis, 
  it was ? 
   perhaps she should try and convince palestinians to try and adopt leaders like nelson mandela instead of stupid rocket-launching mullahas, 
  you want palestinians to start '' [ necklacing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/necklacing ) '' ?
