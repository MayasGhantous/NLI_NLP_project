  like `` you know it 's global warming when al gore starts buying real estate in northern alaska . 
  you had any doubts ... ? 
  yeah , i know . 
  what i mean is up to something like 50yds ( ymmv ) you do n't really need optics . 
  my question is how accurate the shotgun can be at over 50yds ? 
   who is the relevant ` poor ' and ` rich ', 
  poor is the guy who makes less than you , rich - the one who makes more ... , 
   reminds me of that carlin bit, 
  that was my inspiration ... , 
  perhaps life expectancy has nothing to do with health care spending ? 
   if you actually want to learn something for a neutral source , i would avoid it . 
  perhaps it would be helpful to post some links ?

  you do have balls ... , 
   right , that 's the huge , glaring flaw of austrianism that makes it a religion , rather than a body of theory within a scientific field . 
  i guess you do n't give any credence to the euclides or pretty much all mathematicians either ... 
  hmm ... apparently he tried to act within the law first ... so , if the `` law is a ass , a idiot '' ( mr bumble ) what is a proper course of action ? 
  submit meekly ?

   it 's easier to be libertarian when you 're well paid, 
  dunno , i was libertarian even before i got my first job ... and it was n't good paying job either .

  ok , i 'm assuming you are somebody who knows what he 's talking about ...  can you explain why `` thruthers ' '' assertion the pentagon hit could n't be achieved by 757 because of the ground effect is incorrect ?

  i have never actually seen anything debunking that claim . 
  i am an example to the contrary . 
  i 'm making quite long trips about twice a month . 
  before they banned smoking in restaurants ( in pa ) i used to stop for a meal/beer/smoke on my way ( average spending about $ 20 ) .

  so the restaurant owners lost my business and not going to get it back , thanks to randell . 
  and we all know obama is not going to do any more bailouts ... 
   why did the so called shadow banking system collapse , causing the current credit crunch ? 
  you were getting your credit from the `` shadow banking system ? '', 
  it makes sense now . 
  looks like a sound advice , on the surface . 
  otoh history tends to look fondly at the dudes who did n't follow it . 
  spartacus , bunch of colonists in america , jews in warsaw ghetto , etc. 
   i hate them for thinking we are so fucking stupid, 
  _ no one ever go broke underestimating the intelligence of the public _ .

  bush also allowed american individuals and companies to sell said cartels weapons without any accountability,

  ] ( http://www.ariga.com/peacewatch/dy/dycg.htm ), 
   etzel and lehi soldiers began going from house to house and shooting the inhabitants , usually women and children . 
  groups of prisoners were also taken out of deir yassin and paraded on trucks in the streets of jerusalem before jeering inhabitants before being passed over to the arab sector . 
  one group of about 15 to 25 men was returned to the village , taken to the village quarry and shot . 
   `` there 's a very developed system of brokering marijuana that exists all throughout california ; it 's just like a commodities broker on wall street , '' he said . 
  `` they 're getting it for the lowest price they can get it , and they 're bringing in the buyer and trying to get the buyer to pay the highest price they can .
