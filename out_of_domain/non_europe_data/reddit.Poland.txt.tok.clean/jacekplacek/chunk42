  and if you compare 1940 civilians killed per capita with 2008/9 ... it might not be such a strech after all . 
  not really ... he stated he would sign the extension bill if the congress voted for it . 
  so , it was the congress that let it expire . 
  well , it sure beats vbscript ... , 
   it 's called being a fucking asshole and not following the rules, 
  fucking assholes are the ones `` foloving ze rules '' ... 
  hmm ... long long time ago icelanders were doing pretty damn well without the government . 
  perhaps it 's time for them to go `` back to the future '' ... 
  gop ? 
  democrats had nothing to do with it ? 
   the restoration of the rule of law, 
  rule of law ? 
  ... like dispensing with attorney-client privilege ... ? 
  like ignoring the 2nd amendment ... ? 
  that rule of law ? 
  well , about [ that long ago ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/icelandic_commonwealth ) ... 
  i meant `` taking care of friends in corporations '' part ... 
  actually , they were the mainstream of the stampede ... , 
   the go\u00f0or\u00f0 were not strictly geographical districts . 
  instead , membership in a go\u00f0or\u00f0 was an individual 's decision , and one could , at least theoretically , change go\u00f0or\u00f0 at will . 
  there 's no problem of being `` governed '' if you can choose ** for yourself ** your ` governor ' ( if any ) ... 
  they gon na rename the white house to obama 's barrack ... 
  hmmm ... this might be in reddiquette but those who do have a shitload of karma , those who do n't - do n't ... , 
  is n't it funny ... when bush was killing brown people , lefties were screaming bloody murder , when obama does it they applaud ... 
  ok , i suppose you are right . 
  but there 's many that do . 
  to be fair , there 's a lot of repubs who did n't mind bush 's killing but will scream at obama 's ... 
   neocons never stop making shit up, 
  [ neocons ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neoconservative ) ** are ** lefties ... 
   michael lind , a self-described former neoconservative , explained :, 
   _ neoconservatism ... originated in the 1970s as a movement of anti-soviet liberals and social democrats in the tradition of truman , kennedy , johnson , humphrey and henry ( ` scoop ' ) jackson , many of whom preferred to call themselves ` paleoliberals . ', 
  [ after the end of the cold war ] ... many ` paleoliberals ' drifted back to the democratic center ... today 's neocons are a shrunken remnant of the original broad neocon coalition . 
  nevertheless , the origins of their ideology on the left are still apparent . 
  the fact that most of the younger neocons were never on the left is irrelevant ; they are the intellectual ( and , in the case of william kristol and john podhoretz , the literal ) heirs of older ex-leftists . _, 
  lol , billy kristol as an unbiased source ... 
  so , tell me , the wise one , what exactly is `` conservatist '' about neocons ( occasional rethoric notwithstanding ) ? 
  and my point , grasshopper , is that you use labels without comprehending their meanings ... judging by your comments , you ** are ** a neocon , even if you do n't know it . 
   i ca n't be a neocon because i was never a lib . 
  it 's not a requirement ... 
   a ) neo = new ; b ) conservative = liberal ? 
  if they were ** conservative ** there would be no need for the `` neo '' ... they planed ( and succeeded ) taking over the republican party , do you ** really ** believe they could do that if they called themselves `` neo-liberals '' ? 
  add to that straussian doctrine `` it 's ok ( for the _ elite _ ) to deceive the stupid masses to achieve ` noble ' goals '' and you might grok it ... 
  you might notice you avoided the question how are they `` conservative '' ... 
   apparently , your whole argument is that neocon is a misnomer . 
  it is . 
  still no answer to `` what is conservative about neocons '' ... why would that be ? 
  iow you ca n't think of one ... 
   _ the mayor is the problem the flagpole is the answer _, 
  what ? 
  you do n't like your balls being scratched ... ? 
   i find it interesting that it was such a sin to call bush `` bush '', 
  it was ? 
  in what quarters ... ? 
   if we do have a gold based dollar , it means that the amount of money that can be in circulation becomes subject to vagaries of things such as : mining skills , luck , depletion of gold . 
  and with fiat money , the amount of money that can be circulated is subject to one thing only : the whim of the issuer ... 
  hey man . 
  you are making sense - but this is reddit . 
  stop it now !, 
  it 's , actually , `` omon '' ... 
   the top cruise velocity that can theoretically be achieved by a thermonuclear orion starship is about 8 % to 10 % of the speed of light ( 0.08-0 .1 c ) . 
  ok , i do n't get it . 
  why only 8 - 10 % ? 
  if you are at 10 % and detonate another one , wo n't it speed the ship up even more ? 
  or maybe even worse - he would give us the false sense of security . 
  obama has already energized large segment of pro 2nd population ... 
  it 's not a tax cheating when senator does it ... < / nixon 's voice , 
  but the ship and the nuke are , in a sense , an isolated system . 
  there 's no difference if they are at standstill ( whatever that means ) or if they travel at whatever speed ( relative to what ? 
  no , it does not . 
  everything that is not mandatory should be prohibited . 
  everything that is not prohibited should be mandatory . 
   if i want to purchase a 20mm m61 vulcan cannon for home defense , it is my constitutional right to do so . 
  why not ? 
  what do you have against 20mm ? 
  what the scotus said in heller boils down to : `` the right of the people '' means what it says but `` shall not be infringed '' does not . 
  keeps your brains exercised ... 
   if you support the prosecuting of people who run meth labs you are irrational and dishonest ? 
  yes . 
   you are an idiot . 
  clearly you 've never seen a town affected by meth . 
  why do n't you go take a trip to west virginia or kentucky sometime , check out what meth has done there . 
  i 'm all for legalization of marijuana but i think it 's clear that meth , heroine , and the like should remain illega . 
  back in the 1930ies , chillgrampsdan says :, 
  `` you are an idiot . 
  clearly you 've never seen a town affected by moonshine . 
  why do n't you go take a trip to west virginia or kentucky sometime , check out what moonshine has done there . 
  i 'm all for legalization of beer but i think it 's clear that hard liquors should remain illegal . '', 
   what is one lying about when they say these people should be put in jail ? 
  `` dishonest '' does n't necessary mean `` lying '' ; it can also mean `` fraudulent '' , `` corrupt '' or `` lacking in integrity '' . 
  but , anyway , my main point was `` irrational '' ... the same way people who said they did n't support prohibition but did support jailing moonshiners were irrational ( and also lacking in integrity . ), 
  you do n't think the bathtub gin was as bad as crystal meth ? 
  seriously ? 
  ... and your left too ... 
   you 're saying we should discard the work of trained scientists who have spent their entire adult lives analyzing a hugely complex system and creating vast amounts of data by painting all of them as unreliable pseudoscientists . 
  hmm ... we should look back at astrologists and alchemists with different attitudes , now ... < / sarcasm , 
  he does n't give the money to the right people . 
  hey , ben , if you give me some of the loot i promise to spend every last penny ... , 
   liberal wanting to help people, 
  the problem with liberals is they want to `` help people '' at everybody else 's expense ...
