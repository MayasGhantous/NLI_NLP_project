  hmm , let 's [ see ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burlington,_vermont ), 
   as of 2000 , the metropolitan area contained the three northwestern vermont counties of chittenden , franklin , and grand isle , with an estimated 2006 population of 206,007, 
  maybe not exactly manhattan , but still not a podunk either ... 
  [ they do ? 
  ] ( http://richiericher.wordpress.com/2008/02/01/arthur-brooks-who-really-cares-the-surprising-truth-about-compassionate-conservatism/ ), 
  you are missing the point . 
  i have no problem with helping people , i have a problem with taking money from ** other people ** to `` help '' the needy ... 
   what , then , is the role of government ? 
  to keep those ** in ** the government fat and happy ... ? 
  well , nazis did say the jews were a threat to the faterland ... it was n't the ig farben 's job to make that call ... 
  kinda like [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:vforvendettanorsefire.jpg ) ... 
  yes . 
  modern [ zatoichi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zatoichi ) ? 
   up until reagan the tax code had a top bracket of 70 %, 
  ... and everybody knows how great the us economy was doing during carter presidency ... 
  well , to be fair , just because some asshole used to smoke it does n't mean it should be illegal ... , 
  that too ... , 
  ray or abe ? 
  well , the first amendment says '' ** congress ** shall pass no law '' , the second says `` shall not be infringed '' ... so the logic could , actually , work for the first but not for the second . 
  you mean he smoked non-thc hemp ? 
  what was the point ? 
  i did n't expect it to be appreciated here ... kinda like you would n't expect the muhammad joke being appreciated in the mosque ... , 
  add teddy roosevelt and we will have all presidents that got shot at ... 
  hmm , dubya got reelected too ... guess , he was a great president ... < / snicker , 
  ... just like democrats ... 
  how is this sugar any different than from not genetically modified beets ... ? 
  wtf , is it not c12h22o11 ? 
  if they squeezed the water out of it , would you also require `` long term studies '' to see if it was safe to drink ? 
  or are the environuts completely unhinged from reality ? 
   it 's about the fact that the company is about as ethically repugnant , on a basic level , as a company can get . 
  that 's , certainly , a valid point - it just has nothing to do with beets being genetically modified ... 
  you are still free to praise big brother ... 
  ... unless you are ** ready ** to pull the trigger ... 
  do you also rally against disease resistant [ apples ] ( http://extension.missouri.edu/explore/agguides/hort/g06026.htm ) ? 
  they are also `` genetically modified '' , just the means of modification are different ... 
  if the apple grower uses `` low tech '' approach to `` genetically modify '' the apples to be disease resistant , should he be forced to `` do long term studies '' ? 
  or are you simply the ignorant luddite , as almost all of the environuts ? 
  if you think the roundup is dangerous , rally against the roundup - show me the evidence it is and i might even join you . 
  but when you start spewing the bullshit about the danger of beets , you are showing yourself to be a kin to kansas anti-evolution legislators ... 
  you just showing your ignorance ... they ** are ** genetically modified , just the means of modifications are low tech ... 
  so , you have joe the apple grower who has some apples that taste great but are very susceptible to diseases , and he 's got some that are resistant but do n't taste that good . 
  he tries to cross-breed them and eventually he develops the one that is both tasty and resistant . 
  what happened , actually , the gene responsible for resistance got inserted into the tasty apple 's genome . 
  then you have the evil crazy professor working for evil corporation who figured out the resistance gene and inserted it into the tasty apple himself . 
  you and up with two apples that are pretty much identical , but you consider one of them evil because it is `` genetically modified organism '' ... lol , and you say you are not a luddite !, 
  so , please enlighten me , how the apples from my example are different ? 
  the point of such laws is not that they are supposed to be `` enforceable '' , it 's just something they can charge you with if they want to get you ... there 's lots of laws like that on the books , that way ** everybody ** has something to be prosecuted for . 
  as long as you are a `` good citizen '' you have no problem - piss off somebody in power and off to jail you go . 
  well , is n't that what dare teaches ? 
   seems odd that there are enough things specific to a darkroom, 
  what 's odd about it ? 
  almost everything in the darkroom is `` darkroom specific '' ... 
  you could have tried google : one of the first [ hits ] ( http://photo.net/gc/view-one?classified_ad_id=875414 ) shows the darkroom items for sale , all of the items are not very likely to be found outside of the darkroom ... 
  hey , even your example of red light bulb belongs in two places only - darkroom being one of them . . , 
  well , they were ( are ) propped up by the aid money ... hence the old saying `` foreign aid : taxing poor people in rich countries to give to rich people in poor countries . '', 
  i think there 's a typo : ` l' should n't be there ... 
  ... but you can see that only about 3 times a year , when it 's not raining ... < g , d & r , 
  who would have thought ... !, 
  that 's a low hanging fruit ... 
  b. . . b. . . but she called them `` fat pigs '' !, 
   actual case of a guy starting a fire , waving the koran , shouting slogans, 
  yeah !, 
  he should stick to waving the bible , then it would be ok ... 
   the man in the adjacent booth had set his target at 15 feet and was firing with a coolness and precision that chilled me . 
  would she be more comfortable with a guy firing wildly all over ? 
  hmmm ... would ** that ** be a real reason fedgov keeps the `` war on drugs '' going ... ? 
  he means treat ... 
  well , it defintelly is a `` sin '' against the reason ... 
  did n't help me ... :(, 
  war is peace , freedom is slavery ... who are we to say it 's not true ? 
   but it has never been the plague on society that it is becoming today ( the last 50 years ) . 
  why ? 
  because there were no drug bans before ... ? 
   what , did you think the drug war was because of morals or health ? 
  i 'm way too cynical ... 
  when are you going to realize there 's no difference ( other than rethoric ) between right-wing of the bootonyourneck party and it 's left-wing ... ? 
  why even bother to wrestle with the pig ? 
  you get dirty and the pig enjoys it ... 
  but i read/listened to obama 's words . 
  belive me , it 's a treat not a threat ... ( of course , only to `` special interests '' he likes ), 
  perhaps he came to see the light ... people ** can ** change their minds ... 
   posting the stories implies they are upset about the issue at hand . 
  or simply saying : `` i told you so '' ... 
  she fucked madoff for it ... ? 
  hmm ... do you also think madoff 's housemaid ( if he had one ) should return all her savings ? 
  it [ does ] ( http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx?item=n82e16820134864 ) ? 
   why even have border guards then ? 
  indeed . 
  how about $ 10 \u00b9\u00b2 ... 
   gloucester is n't sure it wants to provide easier access to birth control, 
  hmm ... the girls made a pact to get pregnant , how would `` easier access to birth control '' change that ... ? 
  you do realize the difference in price is mostly from difference in taxes , which `` exxon et.al . '', 
  have no control over ... ? 
  what about the dr. mengele 's research ... ? 
  hmm ... did they arrest the shoe-thrower ... ? 
  israel already did ... long time ago . 
  what so special about it ? 
  it 's just collective bungee-jumping ... 
  cornelius , you prude ... 
   the best choice is easy .
