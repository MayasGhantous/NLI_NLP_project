  openoffice.org . 
  i do n't necessary dislike openoffice , it 's just somehow annoying sometimes ... tried to print an envelope - got back to ms word after wasting a bunch ... maybe it can be done , i 'm too lazy to dig any deeper to figure it out ... 
  republican way ? 
  if only it were so , we would n't be in this mess right now ... 
  the author voted for kodos and kodos lost ... ? 
  how can i get a sapling of an infrared tree ... ? 
  and the shellfish go : `` ohmygodweallgonnadie !!! '', 
  back in soviet union , \u0426\u0438\u0442\u044b\u0421\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c says : `` every time you eat a bread , remember the bakeries were a good investment by our glorious government . 
  screw the dissidents who think any government control is bad ... '', 
  it would be much worse for a male gymnast ... 
  fake !, 
  everybody ( on reddit , at least ) knows only the government can take care of the needy ... 
  dear blue states . 
  that would be awesome ... 
   that bunny will survive , but it 's likely that it 'll be a little malnourished if all it eats is cat milk . 
  wait till the mother-cat decides it 's time for weaning ... 
   really tough state , like detroit . 
  _ no comment _, 
  do you care about the world ? 
  do you use computer ? 
  you hypocrite !, 
   we should all be so lucky !, 
  you want in ? 
  just go to australia and break into some houses ... 
  ... if you wish to be bobbitized , that is ... 
  no , it 's not very clear ... people seem to ask for even more ... 
   i can point you to a privately owned , operated , and indeed : privately created bakery . 
  in soviet union ? 
   either way , the 2nd is the worst written part of the constitution and is remarkably unclear . 
  unclear ? 
  how is that ? 
  what is ` unclear ' about `` shall not be infringed ? '', 
   if the goal was to say that people had the right to bear arms , why not just say that ? 
  but they just did . 
  it 's very simple and precise wording : `` the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed . '', 
  period . 
  why ? 
  because `` well regulated militia is necessary to the security of a free state . '', 
   we the people of the united states , ** in order to form a more perfect union , establish justice , insure domestic tranquility , provide for the common defense , promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity ** , do ordain and establish this constitution for the united states of america . 
  you could [ google ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/private_highway ) ... 
   so , again , why is the 2nd different, 
  i do n't know , ask the authors ... how does it make any difference ? 
  the language is still clear and the meaning unambiguous . 
  how about ** not throwing money ** at anything ... ? 
  too radical ... ? 
  because it would n't make any sense ... why would they choose such and awkward way to phrase it ? 
  why would it say `` right of the people '' if they meant `` right of the states ? '', 
   obama is spending it how we want him to spend it . 
  i do n't know who is this _ we _ you are talking about ... but i assume you count _ yourself _ . 
  so , you saying , you wanted obama to give billions to bankers to get huge bonuses ... ? 
   democracy means that the course of action is decided by the majority, 
  nope . 
  democracy means that the clueless masses have an illusion their vote counts ... the course of action is still decided by the elites ... 
  you missed the point of as ... 
  they are `` pissing in our faces '' , allright ... but they are not those who `` fancy themselves as atlas '' , they are those who atlas shrugged against ... 
  there 's only one purpose of work : to pay your bills ... , 
   i think a lot of the pro-putin comments out there are out of personal respect, 
  strangely enough , it 's true that very often psychopaths can elicit respect from ( seemingly ) normal people ... 
   i was n't aware that only abnormal people could maintain a degree of respect for their adversaries . 
  i have a problem with respect for psychopaths , not for adversaries ... let 's put it this way - could you find yourself having respect for himmler ? 
  but that 's north of the border ... 
   also funnily enough our citizens were n't rounded up and executed, 
  ... yet . 
  question is would you agree to fuck that dude for 7 years , if you got the 53 grand a week after that ... , 
  you have to do it at least once after ... marriage can be annulled for non-consumption ... 
  i would be surprised if it was n't the case in most countries ... even catholic church allows for that . 
  no severance ... ? 
  that sucks ... 
   everyone in the us have a dvd player that cares about the region code, 
   we even lived under king george for a while, 
  but now it 's king barack ( or is it a messiah ? 
  ) , so everything is a-ok ... , 
  looks , roughly , like an exponential curve ... you guys sure it 's just reagan 's fault ... ? 
  everyone ! = majority, 
  do you speak english ? 
  it was their job to make sure they do n't insure loans to people who can not pay their bills ... 
  were you ashamed of the post you deleted ? 
  rightly so ... 
  so , you do n't see the difference between ` everyone ' and ` most americans ' ? 
  well , to be fair it 's bush/obama/congress that will ... 
  why is raccoon fur ok but raccoon dog fur evil ? 
  astonishing ? 
  those are the people he owes his career to , like most politicians ... 
  how do you know her level of happiness from people seeing her face is different from people seeing her pubic hair ? 
  just because you were raised to be squeamish/ashamed of some of your body parts , does n't mean everybody has to be ... 
   but you 're missing the point - - which is that this woman unknowingly posted a photo of her vag for all her friends and family to see . 
  how do you know that ? 
  ( i mean the `` unknowingly '' part ... ), 
  you pretty new at this `` internet '' thingie , are n't you ... 
  so what prevents them from claiming malfunction anytime someone wins the jackpot ? 
  written by some seriously pussy-whipped dude ... 
  ok , can someone explain what in glass-steagall would prevent this from happening ? 
  did it prohibit the banks from lending money to unqualified buyers ? 
  how would that make any difference ? 
  the problem is overvalued homes and underqualified buyers ... when the housing bubble burst the mortgage lenders had to take a hit . 
  what difference does it make if the `` hit '' is spread around many investors ? 
   if that and similar situations was a grant to disobey traffic laws , then we would be fucked, 
  would we ? 
  the traffic laws are mostly for revenue generation anyway ... 
  so , how do you figure out if 07/08/2009 is aug 7th or jul 8th ?
