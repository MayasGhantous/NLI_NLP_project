   you 're pretending there are legitimate business that could fill this void which there is not . 
  you are kidding , right ? 
  what if nobody is attacking ? 
  if they give you an ultimatum to surrender on 07/08 when will you actually do it ? 
  are n't you afraid they might be pissed off if you guess wrong ? ... 
  would ** you ** drive on the left side if there were no law against it ? 
  so , the law requiring you to drive on the right side might not generate much revenue but most of the other traffic laws have the one purpose - to get mo ' money ... 
   maybe you should ask the american founding fathers, 
  i do n't recall jefferson executing teenage kids for saying the wrong thing ... 
   che never approved torture ... 
  ... unless he was doing the torturing ... 
  says who ? 
  there were times when `` real scientists '' called heliocentrists crackpots ... 
  so , do you have some valid arguments that would paint them as `` crackpots '' ? 
  and , no , arguments from authority do n't count ... 
  so , you do n't believe what evilbunny wrote ? 
  which part is wrong ? 
  is it : `` corruption and monopolies always arrive riding on government power '' ? 
  or perhaps : `` unsurprisingly this supposed `` common good '' is always aligned with the financier 's interests , the monopoly and rent seekers '', 
  uhmm ... not really . 
  in the real free market presidents do n't decide who goes under and who gets the bailout ... 
  well , the president decided to bail out other companies and not to bail out gm ... 
  you are missing the point . 
  it 's not a free market when president can bail out failed company . 
  i 'm not saying he should bail out gm , i 'm saying he should n't even have a choice to bail out ** anybody ** ... 
  future ? 
  have you lived in a cave for the last ten years ... ? 
  massa says it was crazy aye-rabs , massa do n't lie ... 
  hey , you paint all `` truthers '' with a broad brush , i paint all `` believers '' with one . 
  seems only fair to me . 
  ok , so there was a meningitis epidemic amongst nigerian children , pfized tested the drug on 200 children of which 11 died . 
  the overall mortality was around 90 % . 
  seems to me pfizer ** saved ** some 169 children ... how is that bad again ? 
  ... never mind ... 
  live and let live . 
  so , now you hold pfizer responsible for all third world deaths from untreated diseases ? 
  well , i 'm pretty sure ** you ** could afford to buy these drugs for some of the sick children . 
  are you a monster for not doing so ? 
   these children could have been treated with a drug that worked, 
  and who would treat them ? 
  iow , you have no answer . 
  ** you ** , obviously , would not spend a dime to treat them ... 
  finally !, 
  the clown belongs in the circus !, 
  because we are fat and lazy ... 
  and the liberals ** never , ever ** called republicans nazis ... < / sarcasm , 
  nympho pretending to be vegetarian ... ? 
  `` chains you can believe in '', 
  who would have thought ... 
   the left wing extremists may be laughable but you 'd never fear for your life if some started having meetings next door, 
  weather underground , unabomber , black panthers , ... 
   what part of `` being able to express your viewpoint to elected officials to hopefully influence their decision '' do you not understand ? 
  were n't slaves able to `` express their viewpoints to the massa and hopefully influence his decisions ? '', 
   no , because the majority of represented citizens kept them disenfranchised . 
  what does it have to do with a slave being able to speak to his owner ? 
   do you share the opinion of most responders to my comments that it 's a good idea to have politicians blindly follow whatever the ( perceived ) majority wants, 
  nope . 
  in my opinion politicians should blindly follow the hangman ... 
  you 've said :, 
   being able to express your viewpoint to elected officials to hopefully influence their decision, 
  is a proof of us having a _ representation _ , by this standard slaves also did have a _ representation _ ... 
  i have no problem with you paying your taxes if that 's what you desire . 
  i do have a problem with you sending armed thugs to my house to extract the taxes i do n't wish to pay ... 
  do it !, 
  he needs some laugh ... 
  they had access to their massa , you have access to your massa ... 
  only if you do n't mind an ` f ' ... 
  no , i 'm not saying anything about being _ disenfranchised _ ( whatever that means ) , i simply do n't like being a slave ... 
  yeah ? 
  and you could avoid income tax by quitting your job . 
  what 's your point ? 
  hyperbole ? 
  ok , let me look at my last paycheck ... yup , almost 50 % gone . 
  i guess that makes me almost 50 % slave , does n't it . 
  that 's why ... ( and no , i did not support iraq war ) . 
  it makes me worse off than feudal serf , they only had to work for their lord one day a week ... 
  so , how is somebody , who steals 50 % of my labor and threatens me with bodily harm if i refuse to pay up , any different from the slave owner ? 
  nope . 
  taxes are legal . 
  so was holocaust . 
  now can you , actually , make an argument ? 
  and no , `` you are just a. . . '' does not argument make ... 
  ... yet ... 
  but this time they know what they are doing ... 
  honest ... < / sarcasm , 
  anything in particular ... ? 
  he is hoping you have some change to spare ... 
  back in soviet russia \u0437\u043b\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430 says : `` it 's funny because the bread you eat and the chair you sit on was made in government bakeries/factories . 
  how would this country run without the government in place ? '', 
  nothing simpler , one day you just send pink slips to all employees ... 
  but `` the union '' is a police state too ... :(, 
  who `` takes care '' of bread and furniture in russia now ? 
  so , if there 's a gang raping only young blond females and you are an old redhead male , you are an idiot objecting to the rapes ? 
  i bet this `` liberal blogger '' would gladly join the rapes , if permitted ... guys like that make me want to puke . 
   they engage is in paying less than market wages, 
  how can you pay less than market wage ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  is some `` social service '' directed to the walmart employees only ? 
  they were out there , you just did n't pay attention to the `` libertarian nutjobs '' back then ... 
  so , it 's ok then ... bush did it too ...
