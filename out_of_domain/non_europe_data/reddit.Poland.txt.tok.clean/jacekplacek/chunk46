  meaning of which , quite obviously , you did not comprehend ... 
  what will the left wing do if we are invaded by carnivore unicorns ? 
  ... as written by a kook , demagogue left-winger ... 
  i have no beef with your assertion walmart is rent seeking , i just have a problem with `` paying less than market wage . '', 
  that 's something you can not possibly do , unless you can force people to work for you ... 
  clown belongs in the circus . 
  like a typical retard who think he 's leftist just because it sounds cool , you failed to even notice i said absolutely nothing about accuracy , or the lack of it ... 
  `` rooooxanne , you do n't have to put on the red light ... '', 
  s/bush 's / shrub 's / and you have even nicer alliteration ... , 
  this is . 
  you can . 
  you just have no sense of humor ... 
  we will have to move our asses a few hundred yards from the shore ... 
  `` climate change '' is the ** only ** constant of the climate ... yes , it 's changing , it has always been changing and it will be changing ... 
  if you read tfa there was a warming period at the end of the last interglacial - was it the flinstons driving their suvs ? . 
  there was also much warmer period in the middle of holocene ( current interglacial , which btw is approaching it 's end as we speak ) and some milder warming periods , intermixed with much colder periods , between then and now . 
  all the times when the climate was warmer ( and humans were already around ) were pretty much the fricking golden ages , when it was colder we were dying out ... so sorry but i 'm not fricking convinced . 
  btw did you ever wonder why st. al and the gang are n't buying real estate in alaska , yukon and siberia ... ? 
  perhaps they know well it 's all bs ... 
  so , you find any errors in anything i said ? 
  or simply do n't want to think because you hear that `` vast majority of scientists '' have certain beliefs ? 
  btw : i do n't believe anybody . 
  if you want to convince me of something you need to talk facts and logic , not how many scientist say something ... 
   that 's a sad indictment of the very things your country is supposed to stand for . 
  hey , this country cheered when the fbi roasted branch davidians and their children , because they were `` religious nutjobs '' ... what did you expect ? 
  texas to cornyn : so , what you gon na do if we will ... asshole . 
  only problem with your scenario mr. f-trooper is the fact that it is bullshit ... if this was the case , atf would gladly accept david koresh 's invitation to come and check their `` stockpile . '', 
  besides , the last time i checked , children are not supposed to be burned for the sins of their parents ... 
  perhaps you should really check your `` facts '' mr f-trooper ... there 's plenty of that on the web . 
  anybody who is saying what you are saying is either on the atf 's pr department payroll , or completely clueless ... 
  btw : i never said they did n't have guns , but you are ( on purpose i think ) confusing having guns with `` stockpiling illegal weapons including grenades '' ... 
  you think people are finally waking up to the fact that the small caste of the parasitic psychopaths are pulling the long living scam on them ? 
  yup , something like that ... your employer needed some pr stint because they were in deep shit ( pr-wise ) after some leaked footage of your colleagues racist attitudes , and were afraid of losing funding . 
  they picked on some quaint little religious sect because they knew your average american will not give a fuck , and then managed to botch the initial raid ... after that the fate of davidians was pretty much sealed ... no one shoots at pigs and survives it ... 
   ** educated ** people who think obama is doing the right thing _ [ emphasis mine ] _, 
  surely , you mean english majors ... < g , d & r / , 
  assuming it 's disclosed at the time of sale ... 
   and when it 's a freak show , no one pays attention to the message . 
  well , to be fair , no one pays any attention to brown noses either - perhaps that 's why innocentbystander gets no respect ... , 
  and we have a laser printed birth certificate as a proof !, 
  nevermind laser printers were n't there when obama was born ... 
  depends what you fight back with ... 
  the author also displays amazing ignorance of the theory of computation :, 
   and it 's piss-easy , for that matter , to add robust randomness to a straight digital computer, 
  _ in a context of observation that digital computers are deterministic _ . 
  somehow , the author is unaware of the equivalence of dfas and nfas ... 
  did they make movies with the famous [ bridge player ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/giorgio_belladonna ) in them ... ? 
  are ** you ** serious ? 
  do you really believe campaign rhetoric has anything to do with what the party _ gives shit _ about ? 
  hint : all ** both ** parties _ give shit _ about is power and they 're gon na say whatever they think can give them this power ... 
  back then , the _ old generation _ said the same thing ... 
  was n't this the argument against cassette ... ? 
  chant `` gaia is great and al gore is her prophet '' ... ? 
  considering it 's a gun site ( glocktalk.com ) it 's not that off mark ... fox is the only channel that is n't rabidly anti-gun ... 
  so , you only hire dumbasses ... ? 
   why is that ? 
  aipac would not like it ? 
  i knew it !, 
  cops create disturbance wherever they go ... 
   but on reddit you really do get modded down for arguing in favor of israel, 
  hmm ... 
  i got downvoted anytime i say something not adhering to the leftwingnuts ' pov ... can i `` play the victim ? '', 
  you do realize the page you linked to is empty ... ? 
   i was n't actually there , and i 'm not sure how much i 'm allowed to tell you , so sorry in advance if the story makes no sense . 
  this reminds me of the story . 
  i 'm not allowed to say it , so i wo n't . 
   what a vindictive little bitch . 
  vindictive ? 
  just telling it as it is ... 
   we will take your guns, 
  ** you ** gon na come over and demand my gun ? 
  did n't think so ... 
  oh , so you believe in `` might makes right '' principle ... ? 
   as soon as the tanks roll down main street , everyone starts double-checking their 1040 reallll quick . 
  that might be the case for some ( or even most ) but not for ** everybody ** ... there are people who would chose the `` vote from the rooftops '' option ... 
   and they 'd all be killed in a week, 
  ... kinda like taliban or iraqi insurgents ... ? 
  yes , pollyanna , we all know there is absolutely no way somebody could misuse such database . 
  and absolutely no way some unauthorized person would access it . 
  it could never possibly happen that your unscrupulous potential employer would access the database to check if you have some condition making you potential extra expense ... 
  and , definitely , no government agency would ever look into whistle blower 's records to find some embarrassing health issues they could use to discredit him ... 
  no , none of those things could ever possibly happen ... 
   we 're doing a pretty good job killing people in iraq , actually . 
  people ? 
  yes , insurgents ? 
  not so sure ... and that 's in culturally , racially and religiously alien environment where american soldiers can be brainwashed into hating the natives ... try to make them kill their uncles and cousins . 
  and how are you supposed to recognize the fellow who does some after work sniping ? 
  you gon na send `` tanks and heavy equipment '' to do what ? 
  wan na venture a guess what would happen to `` stupid-but-enthusiastic '' fellas who gave the very some information to china ? 
  yeah !, 
  we need to base laws on what some commie asshole wrote in a piece of fiction commie propaganda ... 
   of the people by the people and for the people, 
  it 's the people , allright . 
  just different set of people in each case ... 
  well , there were ( many ) instances of people dying from food poisoning after eating ** regulated ** food ... is the fact the food was regulated a great comfort to the deceased ... ? 
   are the health code regulations themselves harmful ? 
  yes . 
  my neighbor who makes great burgers will not sell them , because he does n't need the pain in the ass from dealing with government assholes . 
  therefore , people who would buy his burgers go to the jack-in-the-box instead ... 
   considering that the entire us government under bush was basically full of shills and hacks,
