  you do n't delude yourself that it 's any different under obama , do you . 
   wealth can be created . 
  that 's what socialists want to fix ... 
   if the inconvenience of obtaining a license provides too great a barrier to entry , there would be very little competition in the food industry . 
  this does not seem to me to be the case . 
  i dunno , it seems there 's not to many ** independent ** food retailers anymore - mostly big chains and franchises ... 
   i doubt that there are very many cases where a superior product is prevented from going to market because of the harm of the regulation to the provider . 
  but maybe there are . 
  i do n't have such information available . 
  if you do , perhaps you can change my mind . 
  hmm ... what about you rtfa ... ? 
  apparently , the customers of the coop believed it 's products superior , there 's absolutely no evidence their food was not safe ... 
  or better yet , you have the weapon and thief 's life is in danger ... , 
  hey , rad_thundercat fiancee : you can dump him now ... , 
  so , if there is one ( shred of legitimacy ) why did n't you point it out ? 
   if what you are saying is true , then everyone in prison is innocent . 
  not everyone ... there are crimes even the broken system can not screw up ... 
   there is a small percentage of innocent people in jail, 
  how do you know it 's a `` small percentage ? '', 
  judging by a number of death row inmates freed by the dna evidence , the percentage is probably quite high ... 
  the way i see it , if there 's no obvious suspect the system will just find somebody , anybody ... 
   history would have looked differently if they 'd settle in , say , bohemia . 
  you seem to have pretty low opinion of czechs ... 
  and why can not you mind your own fucking business ... ? 
  asshole !, 
  you bet i do . 
  the world is full of meddling assholes like you , who think it 's their right to decide what should be prohibited and what should be mandatory ... and i 'm sick and tired of your lot ... 
  gruppensex ? 
  ... and they are both right ... 
  is says the lenses are 28-300mm ... 
  red-rumped . 
   simple math , more guns on campus will result in more people being shot , if you think otherwise , you 're living outside of reality . 
  simple math , more dicks on campus will result in more people being raped , if you think otherwise , you 're living outside of reality . 
  this is an `` argument '' used by the hoplophobes all the time . 
  ** every time ** there is a ccw law passed the creeps crawl out from under their rocks with this same `` argument '' . 
  then the law passes , the shootouts do n't materialize and the creeps crawl back in ... till the next time . 
  i 've read first 2 paragraphs and the arrow turned orange , after next 2 it turned blue , when i finished it turned back gray ... go figure . 
   why could n't immigrants rise to the top back home ? 
  because there is too many smart , hardworking people `` back home '' . 
  it 's easier for mediocre immigrant to come to canada and be the best ... 
  iow you are dumb , deal with it , go flip burgers . 
  indians might not appreciate your smugness ... 
   do n't downvote without commenting . 
  downvoted . 
  no comment . 
  can we indefinitely hold bums as prisoners of war on poverty ... ? 
   officer gives you a lawful order, 
   who 's gon na have a beer with hu and wen ? 
  i 'm gon na have a beer with my buddy and tonight ... , 
  he could use some diversity , though . 
  it seems there are mostly the same people all the time ... 
   he called the judge that ruled that `` intelligent design '' cant be taught in science class `` a facist '', 
  any judge who rules that ** anything ** can not be taught is a fascist ... and there 's plenty of libertarians who do n't like abortions . 
  i 'm afraid , either nothing develops and you will have nothing to update , or something does develop and there will be noone to update ... 
  because it would be back ... 
  you could be right ... otoh , people who know who hawking is probably know most of them . 
  you mean `` grow old and senile '' , do n't you ... 
  you sure your nick is not `` conclusionjumper '' ? 
  we know , mikey , palestinians can do no good and israelis can do no evil ... 
   wether or not i agree with it as a foreign policy choice , the fact remains that we did set up a democratic government, 
  kinda like vichy ... ? 
  do the world a favor and eat your gun . 
  so , you think we should lock them up ... ? 
   christs teaching is pretty dramatically different from utilitarianism , which is what you seem to be describing, 
  uhmm ... , nope . 
  this has nothing to do with utilitarianism . 
  christ teachings do n't prohibit killing the ( mass ) murderer ... and that 's what the good doctor was , according to pro-lifers ... 
  why is killing the baby 5 min after birth a murder ? 
  is it not a murder 5 min before ? 
  20 days ? 
  how do you figure at what point it becomes a murder ? 
  yet , other than your say so , you provide no arguments for your assertion ... 
   intelligence does n't imply consciousness or sentience, 
  it 's even worse than that ... we do n't have solid definitions of `` intelligence , '' `` consciousness , '' or `` sentience '' ... 
  < / puzzled look  you do n't think pro-lifers consider abortionists murderers ? 
  or you do n't believe christ teachings do n't prohibit executions of murderers ? 
  and where my thinking is distorted ? 
  do you speak english ? 
  i think you 're [ right ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:manul_close.jpg ), 
   strange how my comment goes down exactly the same number of points yours goes up . 
  hmm ... people who think you are an asshole think smpx makes sense , perhaps ? 
  maybe if us were consistent ... 
   our news is not directed by the state, 
  ... officially ... 
   between 14 and 18 is absolutely legal . 
  does it become illegal again above 18 ... ? 
   how the hell does ` fort wayne pistons ' abbreviate to ftw ? 
  fort wayne pistons ... ? 
   this also affects toyota , honda , mercedes , and nissan plants that operate in the u.s. 
  you mean they get to sell more cars ... ? 
   is it time for a new subreddit , the other atheists ? 
  how about `` non-evangelical atheism ? '', 
  there 's no such thing as `` too hot '' coffee ... 
  projecting much ? 
   i know for a fact, 
  no , you do n't . 
  you just revealed yourself as overconfident idiot ... 
   i 'm half tempted to run up to times square with a bunch of friends and start blocking local news crews with umbrellas . 
  if you consider having your ass tazed a blast ... 
   i think the arguement is whether waterboarding is torture or not , not if it happened or not .
