  yes !, 
  iow cia can do something good once in a while ... 
  btw i 'm polish and i was still in poland during solidarity years , these pictures make me nostalgic ...  ... anyway , some said the solidarity movement was a cia operation . 
  to me it does n't really matter , back then i 'd take the devil 's help ... 
  how dare they disrespect the authoritah ... !, 
  there is . 
   show me an < ethnic/racial  factor that can be correlated to more than say , 30 % of all traffic fatalities, 
  well , not ethnic/racial but ... 
  i bet you women are responsible for more than 30 % of all accidents ... you sure you wan na go there ... ? 
   violence is not the answer . 
  `` so , what ` ya gon na do about it , punk ? '' ... 
  that was not amongst sisyphuses criteria ... 
  what 's the definition of `` drunk driving '' ? 
  does `` bac at .08 '' qualify ? 
  that 's the definition according to the laws of many ( most ? ), 
  states . 
  can you tell me with a straight face it would be `` reckless endangerment ? '', 
  for ** everybody ** , independent on tolerance for alcohol and driving skills ? 
  the answer is to hold people responsible for their ** actions ** , not for probabilities ... again , if most crimes are perpetrated by black young males , should we jail all of them ? 
  blacksmith ? 
  great for baby tooth . 
  not so much for a wisdom tooth ... 
  not anymore ... ( at least not if you are a paying patient ) . 
   we know the effects of alcohol and that it 's negative effects on the kind of things that make one a good driver . 
  oh , really ? 
  any amount of alcohol ? 
  on everybody ? 
  quite a [ few ] ( http://www.totaldui.com/breathalyzers/bac/laws-by-state.aspx ) , actually , if you are underage ... 
   what happens now is that 3rd world countries ( with epidemics like aids ) pay through their nose to train new doctors - only to lose them after they have trained to canada or the uk . 
  maybe they should consider paying their doctors more ... 
  so , which is it : do you get a benefit from them or not ? 
  are you starting a fund to help those who tried to cheat the insurer ... ? 
  interesting ... people always tell me the 1st world countries can not compete with 3rd ... ( labor cost ), 
   because private industry has perfected the task of corrupting the government . 
  iow : when government can interfere in buying and selling , government is the first to be bought ... 
   because the government has whatever powers it assigns itself . 
  the best argument for anarchy i 've ever seen ... , 
  well , if government can `` assign '' itself any power they wish to have , how can you get any accountability from it ? 
  ... `` reported '' might be an operative word here ... 
   give the guy a break ... 
  i would ... if he did n't hit me with extra smoke taxes just a few months ago ... right now , he is an asshole . 
  ... and we all know the us never lies ... 
  funny you mention that ... the some liberals who were most vocal clinton 's defenders are most vocal accusers now ... 
  so , how do i go about regulating ... ? 
  hmm ... let 's see : last time around there were many people who got seriously involved - some for ron paul but he did n't get the elites ' approval and went nowhere , some for obama and they got their change shoved up their ass ... perhaps the system ** is ** rigged , after all . 
   every day for me is a thursday or a friday . 
  ... on the flip side , it 's also monday or tuesday ... , 
  i have my very own bugmenot : the `` back '' button ... 
  now , above seems to be a classic `` fence sitting '' , so i do n't blame jorge `` not having a clue '' ... 
   microsoft controls over 90 % of the technology on planet earth,

   you want to see a real dictator ? 
  ... but not fidel castro ... ? 
   nabbing presidents at gunpoint and putting them on planes to costa rica is n't good for anyone in the long run, 
  that should be a standard operating procedure ... someone wants to rule - send the bum away ( at gunpoint ) , 
  b. . . b. . . but he said bush was the devil ... 
   generally it was the rightists and the military who have held dictatorial powers in the americas . 
  _ cough _ fidel _ cough _, 
   the fed is n't merely an all powerful organization . 
  it 's actually run by power brokers behind the scenes and the chairman is a puppet, 
  you do understand that federal reserve banks are owned/controlled by the handful of old banking families ? 
  ( if you do n't , can you point out the time they lost this control ? ), 
  now bernanke , greenspan or volcker are not from these families . 
  do you really believe some of the most powerful and wealthiest people would not care who is in charge of their interests ? 
  or do you think they are not powerful enough to do anything about it ? 
   mark sanford ( that self righteous hypocrite ! ), 
  why is he a hypocrite ? 
  did he condemn somebody for `` banging out of wedlock ? '', 
   in country with gun control . 
  how many people would die ? 
  i do n't know , [ do you ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1569990/mother-beaten-to-death-by-drunk-burglar.html ) ... ? 
  did n't you know anything not praising the government is misleading ... 
   ` we 're taught to be individualistic monsters , ' he says . 
  ` we 're driven by society to separate ourselves from each other . 
  that 's not right . 
  `` individualistic monsters ? '', 
  fuck , the real monsters are always collective ... 
  iow , you can not answer any of the questions , you just do n't like where they lead , so you 'd rather play pollyanna ... 
  fuck the nukers, 
  make vodka not war !, 
   months without consulting anyone 's opinion ? 
  what . 
  idiot . 
  hmm ... so , how many people do you `` consult '' before sex ... ? 
  get off my lawn !, 
  hmm ... 
  i dunno : i know how to handle dogs , not so with sharks . 
  and when i 'm driving my life is in ** my ** hands , not some pilot dude i 've never met ... 
   yet if somebody tells you that carbon emissions will eventually destroy earth as we know it , only the small part of the brain that focuses on the future, 
  also if somebody tells you the nibiru is gon na crash into earth and pollute it with shape-shifting lizards only tiny part of your brain takes notice ... 
  he could simply be a sociopath , which is more of the `` nature '' than the `` nurture '' thingie ... 
  uhmm ... some quick lessons in logic are needed ... a =  b does ** not ** mean b =  a. . . 
   for the inflatable tower to hold that mass , the gas pressure inside must be able to lift it . 
  this is , in effect , the same problem of using a balloon to haul the rocket to the desired launch elevation , except that in the case of the tower , we 're supporting it from below instead of suspending it from above . 
  nope . 
  it 's not . 
  for instance , the tires that `` lift '' your car from below would n't be able to lift it from above , would they . 
  so , how can something be `` rape '' in say kansas and ok in indiana ? 
  yeah !, 
  bodybuilders are all lard asses ... !,
