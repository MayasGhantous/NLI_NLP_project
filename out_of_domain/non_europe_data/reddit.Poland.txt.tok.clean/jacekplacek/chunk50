   how is federal power to be restrained ? 
  handcuffs and leg shackles ... then put them behind bars . 
  repeat for state and municipal ... 
  and for the moment i thought it was about politicians ... , 
   republicans generally want to see originals , not verified copies or images of the real certificate, 
  ... for the guys who want to be presidents ... 
   accuse the guy of being born in kenya, 
  well , if that 's what his grandmother says ... who are they to doubt presidential grandma ... 
  to be fair , he did n't hide it ... and democrats did n't make a deal out of it . 
  barbie had breast cancer . 
  she had a deep distrust of alternative medicine , so she sought out mds and other traditional practitioners . 
  the cancer raged out of control and she died . 
  why not ? 
  if they win , the taxpayers are gon na regret ... the cop might get `` punished '' by being suspended with pay ... 
   who actually takes their kid to the police station to scare them ? 
  well , it did work , did n't it . 
  i mean it ** did ** scare her ... 
  that 's why we need a strict gun control laws ... crazy gramps like that are making life very dangerous for honest burglars ... , 
   seriously ? 
  yup . 
   are you actually concerned that the taxpayers are gon na pay ? 
  yup . 
   more concerned that they 're paying this and many other screwup 's salaries ? 
  neither more nor less concerned ... 
   i get that there 's no accountability or consequence when it comes to cops, 
   but at least if they win , the family wo n't be stuck with medical bills and it 'll make me feel good . 
  it 's pretty easy to `` feel good '' at others ' expense ... alternatively , you could start the fund and seed it with your ** own ** money ... 
   also a good firing for this douchebag is in order , that will also make me feel good . 
  that 's the problem : not gon na happen ... 
  you go first ... 
  there was a conversation ? 
  they just wanted to help the economy ! ... 
  not everybody is familiar with bastiat ... , 
  so , it looks like a death sentence for small organic farms ... 
  there was no free market in us . 
  the non-existent free market lead to the financial crisis . 
  ergo : free market leads to crises . 
   if the people in this town all agree, 
  so , if the people all agree on `` no niggers in town '' policy it would be ok too ? 
  why not ? 
  how do you decide where to draw a line ? 
  e/immigration . 
  in ee lots of men emigrate . 
  in me lots of men immigrate . 
  no , you call them `` self hating jews '' ... 
   if a canadian gets cancer the last thing on their mind is how you will be able to pay for treatment . 
  perhaps . 
  otoh if it boils down to `` will i get the treatment soon enough '' or `` will i have to pay for it '' ... 
  my father died of cancer in canada - and no , we did n't have to pay for the treatment but the diagnosis was delayed by several months , thanks to `` rules '' of the wonderful canadian system . 
  would earlier diagnosis save him ? 
  i do n't know . 
  but the delay did not help ... 
  glad ? 
  you should be pissed - they are obviously incompetent ... 
  if you are one of the dudes israel pays to boost their image , they are wasting money ... 
  no , he did n't miss the joke . 
  he 's saying the joke is on you . 
  it 's not what bush did that 's suspicious , it 's what secret service did n't do ... 
  iow : `` pay no attention to what hitler does to the jews , you will be next if you object ... '' ? 
   the simple explanation is that they 're all idiots, 
  ... or cowards ... or simply conformists ... 
  no , the simple explanation is that the ul ceo knows which side his bread is buttered on ... same for byu dean ... 
  iow : since you do n't know how they could do it , the only explanation is the one contradicting the laws of physics ... 
   many very skilled and intelligent engineers have look at , and studied the tower collapses and came to the conclusion that it was due to the aircrafts hitting them , not any controlled explosions . 
  [ _ citation needed _ ], 
   in the case of 9/11 though , there is a lot of evidence freely available ( due to the public nature of the attack ) . 
  so the engineers studying the tower collapses were n't ignorant . 
  actually , no . 
  nobody other than the select few were allowed to look at the physical evidence and then it was hastily shipped overseas under very tight security ... 
  so the engineers studying the collapse were relaying mostly on hearsay ... 
   would really keep quiet after murdering 3000 people ? 
  if you murdered 3000 people , would you brag about it ? 
   theres just so many unanswered questions but no one in the government ever seemed to care enough to get them answered, 
  hey , there 's enough sycophants like haiduz , so they do n't need to ... 
  there 's a long history of `` court intellectuals '' ... every government has ( d ) them ... 
  does vitiligo also change your facial features from negroid to caucasian ? 
  i never liked becks anyway ... 
  that seems to be implied by `` back '' , does n't it . 
   puppy-shooting is a universal law enforcement enthusiasm, 
  true that . 
  atf has patented their own version though - [ kitty stomping ] ( http://www.boogieonline.com/revolution/firearms/enforce/lamplugh.html ) ... 
   the civil war was bad, 
  but it was n't tennessee that started it ... 
   furthermore , the feds were acting illegally according to current interpretation of the law, 
  `` if they ** wo n't honor state law ** , then have the state police and/or national guard kindly escort the atf the fuck out of tennessee '' [ _ emphasis mine _ ], 
   all those americans look palestinian, 
  george galloway , the british member of parliament, 
  new york city councilmember charles barron, 
  cynthia mckinney , former u.s. representative and 2008 green party presidential candidate, 
  wow !, 
  they do look `` palestinian '' ... you moron . 
  cool !, 
  but somehow i doubt it ... 
  do n't know about others but i sank you just for lulz ... , 
  hmm ... pretty unusual design : 5 cpus . 
  does it take quad cores ? 
  yup . 
  she pisses off the right people . 
  well , you are both right ... kinda . 
  heroic is talking about _ laissez-faire _ capitalism , you are talking about mercantilism ...
