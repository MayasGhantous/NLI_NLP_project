  no wonder . 
  we air their dirt , they air ours . . 
   counterfeit their currencies as much as the us without ** immediate ** consequence . 
  ftfy, 
  hmm ... are n't idiots unable to consent to sex ? 
  but you still have n't received your ration of punctuation ... , 
   i do n't call all statists armed robbers running a protection racket, 
  that 's part of the problem . 
  we need to call a spade a spade ... , 
   my point was the concept of penn jillette , john stossel and glenn beck getting together to discuss health care gave me the agita . 
  yeah !, 
  those bastards !, 
  they even have the audacity to make sense ... now , that 's low ... 
  get the guy a necklace for his birthday ... , 
  financial shenanigans ... ? 
  they simply outsmarted the short sellers who tried to manipulate their shares prices . 
  i do n't know why , the ( usually ) universally despised speculators , are becoming `` victims '' when their schemes do n't play out as intended ... 
  and if you want to make it less unpleasant , get some vaseline ... 
  my , my ... damron said they have the `` power of nazi stormtroopers '' which is hard to argue with - they can raid your home without a warrant , just on the tip of the `` good german '' ... 
  i mean american . 
  how is it different from fascism ? 
  certainly even you have to admit it 's kinda not quite consistent with the 4th amendment ... 
  damron also said `` i would like to see more child welfare workers face the end of a gun 's barrel when they have overstepped their bounds '' which is not the same as `` shooting government employees '' ... unless they try to proceed despite having a gun pointed at them . 
  seems to me like quite reasonable approach - you would n't object if somebody not affiliated with government tried to kidnap a kid and met with the father holding a gun , would you . 
  so do you believe the government employees are `` more equal '' and should have a power to do to us peasants as they wish ? 
  do you think they are some kind of feudal lords ? 
   fortunately , that is changing . 
  [ _ citation needed _ ] ... :(, 
  oh , the `` might makes right '' argument ... 
  yeah !, 
  call the guy ( gal ) the banks own and ask him ( her ) to bite the hand that feeds them ... 
   doing what we can, 
  you ** can ** do many things , you can masturbate for instance - it will not change anything either ... , 
  sweet naivete . 
  bankers own politicians ... for us peons it 's : `` ask not what your masters can do for you , ask what you can do for your masters , bitch ! '', 
   our benevolent government was just doing what was in ** its ** best interest, 
  ftfy, 
  i hope you can spare some change ... , 
  because it 's time this nation stopped worshiping lincoln . 
  ... 4th of april , of course ... , 
   start a news station that just focused on that stuff, 
  kinda like alex jones ... , 
   that stop sign is at that intersection for a reason . 
  yup . 
  the reason being : `` massa need mo money ... '', 
   i was addicted to marijuana, 
  ... and i was addicted to licorice ... 
   a body that is basically the physical manifestation of an agreement of the people, 
  what 's amazing there are still people who believe that ... 
  in reality , this `` body '' happens to be the most successful racket ever . 
  chocolate is more dangerous than marijuana ... 
   there are people who claim the right to put your friends in jail because of their preferences , and you do n't care ? 
  with friends like shockwheat who needs enemies ... , 
  it 's not that far-fetched ... with bans and regulations come fines . 
  well , germans always had this thing for authority ... 
  because if you punched the guy in the nose for yelling at his own porch , you would be an aggressor . 
  cops should n't be allowed to arrest anybody you would n't be justified to punch in the nose . 
   it 's best to just avoid conflict with police whenever possible, 
  yup . 
  just bend over and pray he 'll be gentle ... 
  watch your liver ... 
  `` the law is a ass , a idiot . '', 
  bumble _, 
   if tipping was n't the norm , workers would have no incentive to mess with food or give out bad service . 
  actually , they would n't have incentive to give a fuck what you think of their service ... 
  yup , so they have to give enough service to avoid pissing the manager off ... 
  it so funny when the left-nuts assume being to the right from mao means ignorant ... esp . 
  since it 's the left that 's ** really ** ignorant : about human nature , economics , negative selection in politics etc. . . 
  i take the southern redneck over kalifornia `` progressive '' all the time : the redneck might be ignorant but he will not try to force the whole country into his ignorance ... 
  i do n't think his reddit nick is his real name ... , 
  so you think ... when they embrace newspeak c will have to go ... 
   that 's a lot of red herrings, 
  is that a warning ... , 
   you can understand all that and still conclude that liberal policies will probably lead to better outcomes in reality . 
  seems like it was a warning , indeed . 
  so , you are basically saying that the bunch of ( mostly ) power hungry assholes ( plenty of them obvious sociopaths ) , caring ** only ** about staying in power or getting nice seats on the boards of huge corporations after that , and neither understanding nor caring about economics ; will , by messing with the market according to the wishes of their target voter population ( who mostly do n't know dick about economics either and even if they did still ** their ** interests might not coincide with the interests of the economy as a whole ) and/or above mentioned corporations , lead to the `` better '' outcomes in reality . 
  do n't you understand how fucking nuts it sounds ? 
   even if the libertarian utopia is great in theory . 
  i would n't know what the `` libertarian utopia '' might be , nor do i believe any `` utopia '' can be great in theory or otherwise . 
  libertarians are saying : `` hey , that 's how it is , mess with it and you can only make it worse . '', 
  now , what even worse : if you had a way to select the smartest , most honest , most incorruptible , and most selfless and compassionate human beings to lead the government , they still would n't be able do improve jack . 
  because the market is basically the non-linear system with over 6 billion variables . 
  and all those variables have the fucking minds of their own - not always rational . 
  and you need to solve this fucking system - not gon na happen . 
  no matter how smart you are . 
  edit : lol , by the downvotes i can tell left-wingnuts have the acute cognitive dissonance attack ... 
  hey leftards , can you explain why your worldview is not completely insane ? 
  did n't think so ... :d, 
  palin 2012 !, 
  she pisses off all the right people !, 
   i 'm not sure that i want to trust 8 year olds with the safety for my food preparation . 
  i did n't notice anything about anybody being ** forced ** to buy the lemonade ... did we read the same article ? 
  that would be paracetamol aka acetaminophen aka tylenol \u2122 ... 
  aspirin \u2122 is acetylsalicylic acid , something completely different and not harmful to the liver ( might upset stomach , though ) ... 
  edit : spelling, 
  he might be , but his judgment seems to be correct ... 
   somebodys got ta do it, 
  yup . 
  somebody had to throw the jews into gas chambers too ... 
  well , i have yet to see a law introduced by the southern baptists that interferes with anything ... but you , kaliforniholes , are telling me what i can or can not drive , what i can or can not shoot and what i can or can not eat ...
