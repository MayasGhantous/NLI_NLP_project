  edit : on a second thought , yeah , perhaps the anti-dildo legislation ( alabama ? ), 
  qualifies ... but i still stand by `` no federal law '' ... 
  iow , you can not form an argument , yet your worldview is inconsistent with facts . 
  so , you resolve your cognitive dissonance by denial ... 
  oh , i 'm quite ready to consider other views ... if they are backed by at lest some kind of semi rational argument . 
  i have not seen one yet . 
  all i hear from leftists is : `` it 's impossible to convince you '' , `` you would n't understand '' , `` you have your mind made up '' , `` you are wrong '' , `` you are a moron '' , you are just a right wing nutjob '' ... etc. 
  so , do n't be surprised the conclusion i draw is `` facts do n't conform to your dearly held worldview so screw the facts '' ... 
   well , obviously you 've grouped your ` teams ' and picked one . 
  well , obviously , you are wrong . 
  i do n't have a team - it 's me alone against all the statist nuts be it right or left ... , 
   since i implied that hatred toward gays and over-the-top religion is ignorant ( which can be inferred by the post to which i was responding ) you put me in the team that 's against yours . 
  nope , i put you in the team against myself , because you implied watching the fox news and going to church is ignorant ... and then you said the pretty ignorant ( not to mention arrogant ) : `` i think most people around here really are aggressively ignorant . '', 
   so , basically although you are completely ignorant to any beliefs i hold - other than i am against hatred of gays & `` crazy '' religion - you make an assumption on my political stance and aggressively argue against it expecting me to get into a debate with you . 
  i know you are against fox news , people who watch fox news , people who go to church , and people who do n't always agree with your politics ... , 
  and you make sweeping insulting generalizations about people in the south ... iow , you are kinda asshole , would n't you agree ? 
  hate is n't becoming a virtue just because you happen to hate the people liberals think is ok to hate ... 
  and i want a pony !, 
  yup . 
  and the night is dark . 
  your point being ... ? 
   i find it hard to believe that those who hate and fear the state are willing to submit themselves to the authority of the state when it comes to their right to defend themselves . 
  ccws exist as revenue producing programs for the state and those it sanctions as trainers . 
  it also provides the state with a database of what they consider to be `` domestic terrorists '' and/or their greatest threat . 
  to beg and pay the state for permission to do that which one already has the right to do is beyond the pale . 
   i think the rich should be taxed more because they have more money, 
  aside from taxation being just large scale robbery , the `` rich '' are ** not ** taxed more , the productive are ... 
  the rich are those who already have money , so they do n't give a fuck about income tax , they actually see it as an entry barrier to their club ... 
  look at all those rich bastards senators who vote in all the new taxes . 
  if they really wanted to tax `` the rich '' they would base the tax on the net worth not on the income ... 
  so , we must be doing something right ... , 
   reddit wants everyone to have the ability to walk up to a cop and say `` you fucking piece of shit . 
  fuck you . 
  you are an asshole . '', 
  and the cop just sits there like a statue . 
  this is absurdly argued as `` free speech '' in many circles . 
  ok , so tell me would it be breaking any laws if you walked up to a non-cop and said : `` you fucking piece of shit . 
  fuck you . 
  you are an asshole . '' ? 
  could you be arrested for that ? 
  so why is a pig `` more equal '' in your view ? 
  sorry , pal . 
  you are unabashedly anti-semitic and reddit 's use of that label is a factual observation , not a trick to silence you ... 
  so is a pony !, 
   you 're an idiot, 
  brilliant argument occifer !, 
  well , as brilliant as can be expected from a pig ... , 
  nope , obama 's numbers are falling because people ( other than really delusional ones ) are slowly realizing he is just another bullshitting politician and an asshole to boot ... 
  sure it would be at least stupid to object to that ... did you see french objecting to paris , texas ... ? 
   how do you resolve , overpopulation , living longer , better health , etc. 
  with the whole sustainable development thing . 
  i think it 's pretty obvious : `` it 's time to realise that forests , river systems , mountain ranges and ** people who know how to live in ecologically sustainable ways ** , are worth more than all the bauxite in the world . 
  '' [ _ emphasis mine _ ], 
  the people who `` do n't know how to live in ecologically sustainable ways '' will probably have to go ... kinda like : `` you have to break some eggs to make a omelette '' ... 
  interesting you got downvoted for this ... 
  perhaps :, 
   why in the world do people consent to their, 
  own enslavement ? 
  is too naked a truth for your average `` happy slave '' redditor ... :d, 
  this someone must not be american ... 
  i would n't be surprised they did it just to spite americans ... , 
   colonizing other worlds is impossible . 
  `` heavier-than-air flying machines are impossible . '', 
  _ lord kelvin , 1895 _, 
  `` nobody will ever need more than 640 kb ram . '', 
  _ bill gates , 1983 _, 
  you are in a good company ... , 
  there is a pipeline to be build ... 
   if cheney had served and learned how to handle a weapon , that never would have happened, 
  not so sure about it ... rumors are , dickey was so totally wasted at the time no amount of training would really make a difference ... 
   obama 's plan for a slightly regulated form of capitalism, 
  `` slightly '' ?!, 
  my dear gangsta , we had slightly regulated form of capitalism back in the late xixth and very early xxth centuries ... since then it become very heavily regulated form of kinda capitalism ... 
  the light worker only makes it hardly distinguishable from ( economic ) fascism ... 
  you mean nobody ever dissed shrub ... ? 
   i 've tried logic , facts , and casual conversation/debate and every time it just descends into name calling and rage . 
  i feel your pain . 
  i have exactly the same experience with left-wingers on reddit ... , 
  \u00c5w\u00cbs\u00d8m\u00c6, 
  what ? 
  he ca n't afford one ? 
  in the nation of blind one-eyed is a king ... 
   imo , if i wanted a revolver for defence , i 'd go for the 8-shot . 
  i have a taurus .357 8-shooter and it seems to sometimes get out of sync in the fast shooting scenario . 
  what i mean the wheel does n't snap into position , or overshoots one . 
  never said it was `` unregulated capitalism '' ... and `` very early xxth '' kinda suggests `` before 1930s '' ... 
  as to the `` golden age '' ... hmm ... let 's see : the fricking backward bunch of colonies become the most prosperous country in the world in a little over century ... got ta count for something . 
  just to show i also can throw in random , _ non sequitur _ , quote ... 
  ... and now republicans who diss obama are being called un-american by democrats ... 
  i do n't know , [ you tell me ] ( http://www.bushwatch.com/name.htm ) ... 
   eternal support of retirees everywhere who would undoubtedly benefit from the reduced costs and better service, 
  hey , my local mafia don buys free hamburgers for the poor kids in the hood ... if you throw him in the slammer , the poor kids will suffer ... 
   it 's just like paying taxes is just like being robbed at gunpoint . 
  well , it is . 
  do n't believe me ? 
  try to stop paying ... 
  ... but the ** real ** progress is gon na be made by likes of [ branson ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/richard_branson ) and his [ virgin galactic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/virgin_galactic ) ... 
  i believe the_fbi was being sarcastic ... 
   what do you get in return when you hand over your wallet to a gun toting thief ? 
  my life ?
