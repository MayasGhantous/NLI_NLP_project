  but it is beside the point anyway - kinda like the mafia don in my initial comment : he `` taxes '' me and then feeds the poor kids , makes sure the `` competing '' criminals leave me alone ... etc. 
  i just do n't understand why people think the cops are needed ... 
  i do n't see anything cops do that can not be handled ** much ** better with a little help from my friends : mr. brinks , mr. aflack , or/and mr. mossberg ... 
  then branson is wrong ... 
  i 've mentioned just as an example of something that exist already . 
  sooner or later the space will gain the commercial viability - tourism being just one tiny part of it . 
  the us government can not run out of money - they can just ask fed to lend them more ... and fed makes the money out of thin air ... 
  there are temptations i just ** do n't want ** to avoid ... so mr. nordgren , bite me ... , 
   that 's funny , you voted for obama , but it seems like you had already turned against him and the democratic party back in december . 
  well , to be fair , obama started showing his true colors right after the elections ... 
   seems to work pretty well in other countries . 
  ... because , when it 's the government that denies the treatment , the press is not making a big whoopee about it , neither do docile subjects ... 
  but yes , in the socialized healthcare paradises there are also people who are denied treatment ... and possibly die . 
   well , ineffective treatments are obviously not covered , why should they ? 
  so , you do agree with the bluecross decision ... ? 
  i have never , ever claimed i was obama 's fan ... 
   but it seems that you saw his `` true colors '' some time before then, 
  i 'm more perceptive than most ... :d, 
  can you , globular warmers , at least get your stories straight ? 
  on one hand you saying the rising temp is depleting the oceans of co2 , on the other it 's oceans getting more of it ... 
  it 's kinda funny ... anytime the state screws up the statists blame it on the wrong assholes being in charge . 
  if only ** they ** were in charge it would be a paradise ...

   are you saying fema was n't a huge success story from the clinton years ? 
  i guess it depends on what the definition of `` success '' is . 
  and the definition of `` is '' , of course ... , 
   and only the naive do n't realize that libertarianism is the upper classes wet dream . 
  i guess the `` upper classes '' are pretty naive then ... they are the ones who keep pushing for more and more government ... 
   people who know electricity, 
  i met her once or twice - does it count ? 
  i have you downvoted , not because i necessary disagree but because i want you to find the sura/verse ... , 
  i 'd go with ross perot ... 
   democratically elected afghani government actually wants nato help, 
  and , back then , democratically elected afghan government actually wanted soviet help ... 
   the soviet war in afghanistan ( also known as the soviet -- afghan war or the soviet invasion of afghanistan ) was a nine-year conflict involving soviet union forces supporting the marxist people 's democratic party of afghanistan ( pdpa ) government by their own request , against the islamist mujahideen resistance . 
  that 's from [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_war_in_afghanistan ) , but perhaps you know better ... 
  sheesh ... straining your eyes only to end up being goatsed ... that sucks . 
   whats the name of the mental disease , where you support the very people that will persecute you in the end, 
  obamania ? 
  they stole it from me ... btw : i did n't know you listened to them , i took you for the keith-lover ... 
  of course they deserve it ... they secured hundreds of billions of dollars from the government ... 
  let 's be clear : when somebody says ` government regulation ' what they mean is `` let the government do whatever the hell they want and it will work out for the rest of us '' . 
  they may not know it , but that 's what they 're saying . 
  i do n't know , i was not there ... but there are nuts on both sides of the isle ... 
   pbs news , for the most part unbiased, 
  you must live in a different universe than i do ... 
   point being it is a stripper pole . 
  stripper pole . 
  teaching 9 year-olds to dance like a stripper is fucked up , fully clothed or not . 
  that was a strip-club ? 
  if not , it was ** not ** a `` stripper '' pole , it was just a pole . 
  reddit : prudish and proud of it !, 
  interesting ... since the 5th can not be interpreted as applying only to the guilty , anybody could use the ruling as a defense ... 
  i might be harboring a jew ... 
  it 's funny how some `` americans '' seem to think their president is their king ... 
  so , the president 's got bunch of secret service guys guarding him all the time , and i do n't . 
  and somehow i 'm not afraid of people having guns around me but you think mere presence of president should strip me of my rights ... 
  comic sans monospaced ... , 
  they must have been smoking something really good ... 
  i have yet to hear of one instance of the firearm going out by itself and killing somebody ... 
  otoh , if i 'm writing a review of a stripper , i 'm gon na say : `` 7 '' ( out of 10 ) . 
  you still can bitch i should measure the separate factors and my single number is absurd . 
  and you are probably right but i still stick to my `` 7 '' ... , 
  well , they moved in to strip the carcass ... 
  what do you mean ? 
  i think it 's the best time to be a programmer ... 
  `` unlicensed gun ? '', 
  wtf is that ? 
  since when does new hampshire require gun licenses ? 
  so , you are saying that , as long as they switch the camera off ( or do n't have a camera present , ) cops are free to do whatever they fucking feel like to the people in their custody ... ? 
  yes , if they `` shovel and shut up '' afterward ... 
  you are acting like a dumbass right now . 
  can i beat the shit out of you ? 
  yes , that 's of course ** exactly ** what you are saying , officer ... 
  one word : brie ... 
   did n't turn the us into a soviet republic, 
  that 's debatable ... 
   the israelis wouldnt be there at all if a bunch of racist europeans had n't been massacring jewish civilians for thousands of years in inquisitions , pogroms , final solutions etc, 
  so , because racist europeans oppressed the jews , they feel entitled to oppress arabs and steal their land ? 
  address , please ? 
  so , why do n't you set up a corporation with pay related to performance ? 
   the history of the us shows we regulated markets many times with success, 
  yes , but almost always we regulated much less than the rest of the world ... that 's why we did better than the rest of the world . 
  right now we really did catch up ( with regulation ) and our glorious leader and his worshipers want to regulate even more . 
  just wait and see : the pauperization of american middle class will follow ... enjoy the ride . 
  what 's `` gender equality '' ? 
  something like women getting a woody ? 
  or men menstruating ? 
  only if they were wearing blue gloves ... 
  not all , some will be converted ... 
  and santa claus will gang up with tooth fairy and easter bunny and together they will bring peace to world ... 
   personality trait called right-wing authoritarianism, 
  surprisingly enough it 's more prevalent amongst left wingers ... 
  ... to the batshit crazy left wingers ... 
  calling somebody a `` skank '' is a slander now ? 
  you really believe someone who wants to hire a model will base their decision on whether she was being called a skank by some anonymous blogger ? 
  and if someone refused to hire me based on someone else 's web page i 'd be happy ... definitely , would n't want to work for such an asshole ... 
  i do n't think ** anything ** can help ... , 
   i bet she sucked google 's ceo big fat hairy balls, 
  how do you know google 's ceo has big fat hairy balls ... ?
