  what bringing the gun to town hall meeting has to do with this particular personality trait ? 
  lol , there is a `` hit-and-run '' epidemic on reddit : posting the response and deleting it seems to be a new fad ... , 
  uhmm , look up _ malum in se _ vs _ malum prohibitum _ ... 
  i do n't recall jesus ever robbing anybody to pay for it ... or advocating the robbery ... 
   rare neurological condition, 
  psychopathy is not really that rare , ever thought of a political career ... ? 
   i just do n't believe it is a tool . 
  i think it is a weapon . 
  weapon is a [ tool ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tool ) ... notice how most of the examples either are weapons or can be used as ones ... 
  and the moral of this story ? 
  remember kids , if you want to blog anonymously , use off-shore servers ... 
   what disturbed the mother of two more than bolognese 's language was the revelation ( after the consultation ) that bolognese was not licensed to practice medicine in the state of florida . 
  he did n't have a florida license ( but he did have a new york one ) ... 
  i guess floridians are different from all other folks and the `` normal '' people doctor can not possibly be competent to deal with floridians ... < / snicker , 
  why do we have nanny state ? 
  because most of us are sissies who simply can not imagine living without nanny ... 
  oh , for the fuck 's sake ... do n't you have anything better to be outraged about ? 
  because the war is all fun if it 's lefties that run it ... ? 
  people are getting killed crossing the streets too . 
  this seems like more fun . 
  if you are so risk averse , do n't get out of bed , ever . 
  obviously , you are wrong . 
  if it was the case you would incriminate yourself just by invoking the 5th ... 
  but , still , you have n't watched the video - the prof is telling you ** how ** you can incriminate yourself talking to the police , even if you are completely innocent ... 
  does n't mean you are not hypocrites ... < g , d & r / , 
  i know , i 'm showing my age ... , 
  what ? 
  you do n't know ? 
  you ca n't go around dissing your masters ' bodyguards ... 
  they were a few ** very hard ** fuckers ... , 
  you seem to be a firm believer in the collective punishment ... the most despicable ( although very common ) kind of human being , imo ... 
  are you trying to be sarcastic or do you simply have a reading comprehension problem ? 
  by withdrawing from the show , they ** are ** taking side ... just sayin ' . 
  yeah , yeah ... 
  i know all lefties think they 're `` neutral '' ... it 's not so . 
  they `` distanced '' themselves after left wingnuts barraged them with the boycott threats ... 
  ... so now they face boycott by the right-wingers ... , 
  it remains to be seen ... now that the right wingers are threatening the boycott , maybe they ( advertisers ) have lost ... 
  brazil 's official language is ** not ** espa\u00f1ol ... 
   if i ca n't trust the tech group at best buy , who do i trust ? 
  those are the ** last ** people you want to trust ... , 
  who would that be ... ? 
  and what do i do if ( or when , rather ) other voters pick the one who promises the most pork ... ? 
  obviously . 
  since the liberals are the ones who promise more freebies ... 
   use the tarp loans to make money for the taxpayer, 
  you mean i will get a check from the government ? 
  did n't think so ... 
  no , they took it from my paycheck ... but it was you who said the money is being made for the ** taxpayers ** - did you lie ? 
   free market fails to prevent powerful individuals from creating a mixed economy, 
  ... in the same sense that the mugging victim fails to prevent the mugging ... 
  ... there is a whiny and cowardly streak in mainstream european attitudes , which can not accept individual responsibility for anything , including charity , while incorporating a large and sanctimonious quotient of blame ... 
  i did n't say anything about fairness , did i. 
  and the market will address that as soon as people figure out tar and feathers have their use ... 
  neither of them runs anywhere near where i am ... and even if they win they 'll be only two voices in the choir of statists ... 
   its fuckin dumb to wear your hat if the massa is near by . 
  ftfy, 
  because more logical people are overrepresented online ... ? 
  one crook praising another ? 
  there is honor amongst thieves after all ... 
  it 's a deal ... when can i get my taxes back ? 
   you propose duplicating our entire transportation infrastructure, 
  ... but you have no problem with `` duplicating '' the entire shopping structure ... ? 
   yes , logic is whatever complies with your own philosophies . 
  it 's the other way around : my worldview is based on rational thought ... 
   you know everything . 
  i 'm just willing to learn . 
   no it 's based on simple circular reasoning . 
  nope . 
  i 've been a libertarian before there even was `` online '' ... and i got to my worldview by thinking and logically evaluating arguments of all the others ... 
   that would be like putting the blame on iraq solely on bush . 
  it just does n't work like that . 
  does n't mean bombing random americans or raping random american girls to `` punish america '' is the right thing to do ... 
   there may be a vast consensus on one side, 
  science has nothing to do with consensus - there was a strong consensus in pre-copernican world too ... 
   they are heavily funded by exxon, 
  and all the `` scientist '' behind the globular warming are heavily funded by politicians and their funding is ** depending ** on their findings of gloom-and-doom that the same politicians will use to lubricate their careers . . 
  for the same reason you do n't post about copernicus in the flatearthsociety subreddit ... 
   first off , there are vast space limitations in most suburban and urban areas . 
  no more room for streets , so duplication is already impossible . 
  but the dupli - and tripli - and even quadrupli-cation is already there . 
  when i go to work every day i can take at least three completely different routes that get me there in approximately the same time ... 
   `` or the cable in the ground . '', 
  it 's already duplicated - there are cables from power company and from verizon and from comcast and perhaps even ma-bell ... 
   apparently the logic of one of us is flawed, 
  looks that way , does n't it . 
   your original assumption about the over representation of logical people , is based on circular reasoning, 
  nope . 
  it 's based on the simple observation that the first adopters were mostly technical people and in their population logical thinking is more likely to be better than average . 
  it would also explain why lately , as the more and more non-techies find their way into the web , the quality of the aggregate rational reasoning on the intertubes suffers ... , 
  there 's no question whether exxon is objective . 
  the question is whether the scientist who gets paid by the institution that gets ( small ) part of their funding from exxon is necessary less objective than one who gets his/her money straight from politicians ... 
  unfortunately it seams to be the case : the global warming catastrophists seem to be almost exclusively in the political-hack-funded camp ... and the independent ones are somehow always tied to the wrong industry and globular warmers are ** always ** discarding their research , even if their only tie to the oil industry is oil guy 's great-great-granddaughter-in-law donateing two dimes to the university they came from ... 
  if that was the case you would n't feel compelled to point out exxon donated the door knob to the foundation that is giving money to the university that employs the `` denier '' ... 
   there is a positive correlation between high intelligence and socialist tendencies as exemplified by many brilliant minds such as einstein and ( afaik ) hawkin, 
  [ _ citation needed _ ], 
   one would think tim geithner is the illegitimate son of bernie madoff . 
  well , he runs almost the same kind of scam ... 
  you seem to be under impression `` anecdote '' is a singular of `` data '' ... one einstein does not correlation make . 
  i meant `` you '' as a collective `` you '' ...
