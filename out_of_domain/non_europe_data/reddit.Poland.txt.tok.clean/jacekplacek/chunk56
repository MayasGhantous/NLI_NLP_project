  you would not ponder `` what system do you support instead '' , would you . 
  you would probably point a shotgun at me and told me to get off your property . 
  if you do n't have one or are not confident enough to use it , you might pay me but you would not feel you `` benefit '' from it . 
  so let 's switch this around : how do you justify sending the jackbooted thugs to me to demand my money for your favorite charities ... ? 
  expect fully cooked birds to fall from above from time to time ... 
   it would be unfair if everyone did n't chip in , so we 've agreed as a society to force people to do so . 
  well , not quite . 
  there 's no such thing as `` we [ ... ] as a socety , '' peole are individuals - societies are abstract concepts ... 
  you might think you `` agreed '' to it , but in reality you had no say in the matter - it was forced upon you - you are just indoctrinated that it is `` for the common good '' . 
  even if you were right and there were some things that could be done only by the government , it would still be immoral to extract money by force . 
  think about it this way : if the `` services '' the government performs are valuable , people will pay for them without need for compulsion . 
  iow if the cause is good people have no problem contributing . 
  government seems to be unable to function without ** forcing ** people to `` contribute '' . 
  seems to me you just nailed it : government 's causes are not that great ... , 
  hey , the beam itself can be as perfectly on target as you wish . 
  question is how do you keep birds from flying into it ? 
   why is the only counter argument that the people who oppose taxes have is that it is by force !, 
  grr ! arr !, 
  perhaps because it ** is ** the only argument ... kinda like it is also the only argument against rape ... 
  as [ shamus young ] ( http://www.elasah.com/brains/?p=118 ) said : _ but right and wrong must come before any other discussions about `` what works '' . 
  being physically in shape works far better than being fat , but it 's still immoral to make someone jog at gunpoint . _, 
   [ . . ] use public roads , benefit from police protection , benefit from fire-fighting resources , benefit from any company that has tax subsidies , be able to send your children to a public school or even a private school receiving subsidies [ ... ], 
  if you were in the soviet union you could easily add to your list : '' , benefit from the grocery stores and bakeries and < insert pretty much everything  ... '', 
  iow just because government provides something does n't mean it 's the only ( or even reasonable ) way to get it . 
  not to mention it 's still ** immoral ** ... 
   [ you are ] free to move to dubai or somalia or wherever you can be happy in your greed . 
  oh , the old `` love it or leave it '' argument ... funny it should work for the < your favorite oppressed minority  in < your favorite oppressive regime  too , should n't it . 
  and quite frankly , i 'm almost positive i 'm much less greedy than you . 
  i 'm more than willing to help someone in need ** out of my own pocket ** or with my own effort/time . 
  and i never advocated taking other people money to feel charitable ... unlike you . 
   biodiversity , despite being inherently valuable to many people , gives us medicines and allows us to make leaps in medical science and biology . 
  we have only scratched the surface of available knowledge in these areas . 
  as we begin to better understand genetics , biodiversity will be invaluable . 
  and that 's a bullshit argument ... we `` might '' discover new medicines , but that 's not very likely - most of the new stuff is synthetic ( you can not patent a herb ) . 
  it could also be argued the biodiversity might be dangerous : see , if we have paved africa over we would have no ebola or aids ... 
   my point is this : do n't repeat immature slogans . 
  issues are a lot more nuanced than you think . 
  is n't that something you should take to heart too ... ? 
  you first . 
  plus , they have good tasting meat ... 
  devilburger , anyone ? 
  feeling insecure ? 
  just accept it : republicans and democrats are two sides of the same coin ... 
  better metaphor yet : the left and right jackboot of the `` boot on your neck '' party ... 
   a `` capitalist '' is someone who loans out capital to start-up ventures . 
  not necessary , capitalist can start a venture up himself , instead of loanig out the dough ... 
  these are not mutually exclusive ... capitalist is a dude with capital who want 's to use it to make profit . 
  enterpreneur is a dude who applies said capital to the profitable endevour ... 
  to be fair , obama 's speech was not a news , it was just propaganda ... as any other political speech ... 
  no , no , no ... the fox news is a designated hatee of reddit ... 
  of course he does , he is a politician after all . 
  still , i do n't want government to has any say in it . 
  otoh the father should have some say in the matter - in case of diffrences of opinion it could perhaps be resolved in a civil court . 
  obviously . 
  those that stayed there do n't dare to be unhappy ... 
  that 's cruel ... 
   if they do it is usually restricted to adolescents, 
  so , what they do with them after they grow up ? 
  six months in jail ? 
  i ` ts great to be a king ... 
  minarchist is an anarchist who has n't yet thought his position through ... , 
  i do n't think the average tax rate is a good datum to consider . 
  most of the revenue comes from the highest marginal rate taxpayers and i think that 's what should be considered instead . 
  i do n't have any problems with town people chipping in ** voluntarily ** to fund a security service ... you still have n't grasped that concept , yet . 
  because you are young and ** everything ** can trigger one ... ? 
  or you just fancy frogs ... 
   what makes you think i 'm advocating anything else ? 
  the fact you introduced yourself as a minarchist , perhaps ... ? 
   i 'd consider myself a minarchist, 
  i 'm afraid it 's you who does n't ... 
  what about it ? 
  are you suggesting this is any different with a government ? 
  is government going to post bodyguards around me 24/7 ? 
  again , you have n't shown any role for a government yet ... 
  it 's not . 
  if you work , your company has certain rules you agreed when you started your job . 
  that does not make your company a government . 
  you see , obama can do no wrong , so the only explanation has to be racism ... 
  so you think ... 
  how can i obey god if he refuses to show himself ? 
  even if i wanted to i could n't ... 
  lol . 
  judging by downvotes r/politics thinks everything dear leader says is gospel ... 
  when i say `` he refuses to show himself '' i mean it in a generic sense ... 
  i have received absolutely no signal from any god whatsoever . 
  the laws you talking about ? 
  whish laws ? 
  they all came from some book or from priests . 
  which set of books/priests should i listen to ? 
  you , obviously , go with yehova as interpreted by jehova 's witness ' priests . 
  someone else goes with the same yehova but as interpreted by their rabbi , or mullah , or pope ... do you begin to see the problem ? 
  and i even did n't go into religions that worship other deities ... 
  so you want me to have faith . 
  in who 's word ? 
  how do i know it . 
  how do i know your god is the correct one ? 
  will i be punished if i guess wrong ? 
  sure , boosting self esteem , whether justified or not , seems to be a main goal of the public schools ... , 
  go for it . 
  ok , i did it .
