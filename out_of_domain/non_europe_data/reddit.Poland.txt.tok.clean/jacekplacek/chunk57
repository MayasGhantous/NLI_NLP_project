  where 's my $ 100.00 ? 
   if microsoft ran ads saying apples cost $ 10,000 at least, 
  you mean they do n't ... ? 
  just to be a contrarian , i 'm switching from sprint to att ... :d, 
  ... different strokes for different folks ... , 
  hey , did n't you know that in the lefties ' protests there are only highly intelligent and articulate individuals ... 
  would n't you get a little bit angry if some asshole painted your car over ... ? 
   we 're all allowed to have our own opinion . 
  are you nuts ? 
  do n't you know where you are ? 
  it 's reddit/politics for goodness sake - absolutely no dissenting opinions allowed ... , 
  so , what happens when someone gets to the vertex ? 
  you 've got ta be fucking kidding ... you left wingnuts assholes are ** all ** about taking rights away : right to property , right to self-defense , right to be left the fuck alone ... 
  i can not figure out if you are serious or sarcastic ... , 
  sure , sanctimonious assholes being close to the top ... 
  why ? 
  are you suggesting the `` civil '' rights are somehow superior to the natural rights ? 
  somehow i do n't get your train of thought ... op posts a video of ( i presume ) some protester saying something offensive ( again i presume ) suggesting taking some civil rights from some group . 
  then nixonrichard commented sarcastically and i added my own sarcastic comment . 
  the gist of both was that the left wingers on reddit are prone to attacking some random stupid comments by right winger protester , and attributing them to the whole right spectrum . 
  it should be pretty obvious to anyone with the shred of objectivity that all mass protests are attracting various people , not all of whom are necessary intelligent , articulate and educated . 
  at this point seeker135 barged in with demand that i show the example of the left winger `` wanting to take away or deny a group 's civil rights . '', 
  and asserting that `` otherwise , your comment is a balloon . 
  full of hot air . '', 
  how this series of events obligates me to be constrained to the particular pet peeve of seeker135 i can not fathom . 
  facts ? 
  what facts did you bring to this conversation ? 
   you seem to be seeking , but not knowing where to look , or how . 
  you are assuming again ... and again you are wrong ...  i have to confess i was kinda being sarcastic . 
  i call myself an agnostic not an atheist , but that solely on an account of abundance of atheists who just wo n't shut up . 
  my take on it is mostly `` i 'll leave you alone to believe what you want , and please return the favor '' ... 
  but neither my original comment nor the comment of nixonrichard was even remotely addressing the question of civil rights or their taking . 
  iow seeker135 was vigorously kicking his own strawman . 
  do n't see why i 'm supposed to be obligated to defend it ... 
  ok , why is reddit masturbating over some dimwit tv personality ? 
  for the same reason goldman sachs banksters wanted obama to be president ... ? 
  i would vote for herve ... 
  hmm ... in my universe , `` giveaway '' means give away with no compensation ... seems the environuts think `` sell '' = = `` giveaway '' . 
  they are , for lefties ... 
  did n't like any ... yours ? 
  hey , it depends on what/who you may need to defend against ... the dudes from `` tremors '' sure could have had use for some .50 bmg ... but then there would n't be much of the story ... , 
  nope . 
  life member of goa instead ... 
  why would you think neocon rhetoric is something this reddit will appreciate ? 
  seemed to be clever enough to outrage half of reddit ... granted , the slower half ... < g , d & r / , 
  nope . 
  obama and the left wing collectively and socialistworker in particular do . 
  oh , i 'm flattered , sir ... 
  canadians are not very attached to liberties - they prefer bread and circuses . 
  so do americans . 
  the `` most of the left '' part ... ? 
  i 'd vote for the landmine removal ... by rolling politicians over them . 
  `` if voting could change anything , it would be illegal . '', 
   the most common strands of anarchism are not individualist,

  that comes down to about 2.5 tonnes per wheel , anybody knows what 's typical weight/wheel of the truck ? 
  regan deregulated meat industry ? 
  from the article it seems the industry ** is ** heavily regulated but this particular producer was just doing things that are prohibited ... 
  i hope he does n't work in my brewery ... , 
  oh , so when the guy has multiple partners he is a stud , but when the girl do she is a slut ? 
  would it be a correct assessment that you are a bigot ? 
  many racist groups used stars and stripes as well ... should we ban it too ? 
  cool , let 's make mikey the single payer ... 
  i 'm afraid she 's already crossed the line ... :(, 
  `` all the animals are equal but some are more equal ... '', 
  depends if it was a male or female friend ... , 
  as much as i hate his neocon ass , he is right on that ... 
   so you 're a neocon ass too ? 
  it has to be sooo comforting to live in a binary world ... 
   but it also seems obvious that the world without a un would even worse, 
  i do n't see anything obvious about it ... why people think adding extra level of bureaucracy to the world is an improvement , beats me . 
  imo we should remove at least couple of levels instead ... 
  un is exceptionally good at giving `` aid '' to third world dictators , who use it to secure their rule ... 
  if you did n't notice there 's plenty of authentic humanitarian organizations - the best of them privately funded . 
  and there 's plenty of good people donating to them , very few of them your `` baron/whatever lord & nobles '' . 
  in most major crises the aid from these organizations get to the target well before the un even notices it ... 
  un is a huge , expensive , bureaucratic institution where the world 's discarded politicians go to keep feeling self-important . 
  an institution which is often used by aggressive assholes to give a veil of legitimacy to their wars ... 
  as [ mike vanderboegh ] ( http://sipseystreetirregulars.blogspot.com/ ) likes to say - do n't poke the wolverine with a sharp stick if you do n't want your balls ripped off ... 
  or in [ mama 's liberty ] ( http://www.thepriceofliberty.org/ ) words - if you do n't want social disturbance , stop disturbing us . 
  if it works for you and keep you off my lawn , i do n't care ... 
  hmm ... so , i recon , you must have some good explanation for fed 's secrecy ? 
  either you are willingly disingenuous or you do n't know jack about economics ... or even the real world . 
  no , the free market is not ** perfect ** , it does n't allocate resources `` perfectly '' , the information is not total and is not carried flawlessly ... 
  but it is still better than anything you ( or anyone ) could come up with . 
  for various reasons . 
  the most prominent being the inherent complexity of the system where the billions of agents interact and each of them has a mind of his own ... and is prone to change it on a whim .

  tl ; dr : bunch of brit retards go to alabama and offend the locals on purpose . 
  locals decide to have some fun at their expense . 
  the brit retards get scared and then moan and whine how badly were they treated by these bad bad rednecks ... 
   she opposed president bush on the war . 
  so did democrats . 
  not quite . 
  democrats opposed bush . 
  period . 
  ( see how they stopped opposing the war since it became obama 's war . ), 
  cindy did oppose war . 
  well , i think the point is that democrats were in love with cindy when she protested bush 's war . 
  they want a divorce now , that the war is obama 's ...
