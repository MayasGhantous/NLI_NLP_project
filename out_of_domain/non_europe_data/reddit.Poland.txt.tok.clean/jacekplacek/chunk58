  stop feeding the troll ... 
   this makes absolutely no sense . 
  you mean the bs that is required to buy a gun at the gun store , of course ... , 
   i think background checks are a good idea . 
  i do n't think a list of who owns a gun is a good idea, 
  irrespective to the main issue : you have to be pretty naive to think the fbi database ever goes away ... 
   he did not , however , try to purposefully exterminate a whole race and commit genocide . 
  let 's just keep that in mind . 
  but he did purposefully try to exterminate whole class - that of the productive farmer ... read up on holodomor . 
  well , not being a jew i might have fared much better in auschwitz than in kolyma ... 
  not being in a group singled out for extermination would put me in the slave labor category . 
  nazis were much better slave masters than commies ... 
  and no , it 's not just a feeling - members of my family were in both . 
  the ones that were in nazi camps ( four ) all survived . 
  the ones that ended up in gulags were less fortunate - out of three only one survived , my grandfather ... 
   are you further left than i am, 
  we tend to be orthogonal to the left/right axis here ... 
  remember : it 's not slavery if you love your massa ... 
  did you forget that `` war is peace '' ... ? 
  it always cracks me up how the statists say the world is much more complex than what `` simplistic free market view '' assumes , and than proceed to explain how bunch of assholes who 's only talent seems to lie in back-stabbing and ass-kissing ( and knowing when do which ) , will be able to resolve this immense complexity . 
  and all for our benefit , of course ... how come you guys do n't laugh at yourselves ? 
  seems to be a favorite of reddit ... < g , d & r / , 
  is n't that what alex jones was saying all these years . 
  and he got branded a `` nutjob '' for his efforts ... go figure . 
  nice way to get out of dodge ... 
   there is nothing that oxygen can combust with up there, 
  there is . 
  nitrogen . 
  [ all scientists ] ( http://www.oism.org/pproject/ ) ? 
  you have somehow non-standard definition of `` all '' ... 
  i 'm pretty sure you are right in n2 + o2 scenario . 
  i 'm also pretty sure when it 's n + o you are wrong ... and there 's plenty of those in the aftermath of nuke going kaboom ... 
  beauty is in the eye of beholder ... 
  i bet you , female turkeys have different opinion ... 
  i did not say it was the source of the heat and light . 
  just corrected the op . 
  but they did have good articles ... , 
  ... resistance is futile ... 
   does n't act in israel 's interests, 
  and why would it be supposed to ? 
  my theory ? 
  people are sensing the upcoming fall of the american empire . 
  when empires fall , those who are armed have better chances of surviving . 
  so , more and more people start thinking of bettering their odds ... 
   left wingers , who are generally more open-minded and intelligent,

  cash . 
  you ever thought of becoming sf writer ? 
  on a second thought , fantasy would be a better genre ... 
  ventriloquists ftw !, 
  hmmm ... 
  i think sombody tried that alredy ... 
  well , despite all the reddit posts to the contrary , not all police officers are low life scumbags ... 
  similar to pol-pots vision of an utopian community . 
  pol-pot simply realized some people can not be `` conditioned '' and they have to be eliminated . 
  looks more like a bite than a shot ... 
   would n't it have been better to offer help rather than to take pictures ? 
  in that case , all the help that could be given , was given . 
  i do n't think the photographer could be of any help . 
  sure , but what to do about the ones that are immune to conditioning ? 
  . . i will use as many ... or as few . . as i well damn please ... ... oh , and get off my lawn !, 
  beats me , but somehow all the `` utopians '' who ended up holding power , found the need to exterminate them ... 
  so , what happens to those who do n't fulfill the quota ? 
   more people in dc watch baltimore orioles games on tv than that of the washington nationals, 
  they should name their team after birds too . 
  what about `` washington vultures '' ... ? 
  hey , i would love to have a subsidized whorehouse instead . 
  why are my needs not taken under consideration ? 
  btw : i bet i 'm not in a minority ... , 
  perhaps the developers of said software should start reading rfcs ... 
  you are not really ** that ** naive ... ? 
  law enforcement 's goal is revenue generation , not some nebulous `` intersection safety '' ... 
  so you already killed the kid ... and ** we ** are worthless fucks ? 
  seems like reddit is not aware of existence of the video editing software ... perhaps she lied , perhaps jackbooted thugs lie ( and cut the portion ( s ) of the video off . ), 
  i do n't know but neither do all the sanctimonious tsa defenders ... 
  you forgot to mention , it was demanded by protestants to end the proliferation of the schools run by `` papists '' ... 
  btw : do you believe everything that is not new is good ... ? 
  well , it seems to be better than in the neighborhood ... back then , when they had the blessings of the government , they were starving pretty much all the time ... now the famine is a thingie from the past . 
  btw : are you aware that back in the days the neighbors/un/us did n't try to save somalis from anarchy , mogadishu had much less murders than baltimore . 
  despite being over twice as big ? 
  what 's wrong with that ? 
  useful things , all of them ... 
  hmmm ... that would mean kinda `` quantum pseudo-solipsism ... '' - i will never die while the other people do ( in my `` universe thread '' ) but in their `` universe-thread '' they never die , although i will ... iow we all carry around our own `` universe-thread '' where we are the only thing that matters ; very close to being the only `` real '' person ... 
  it 's everywhere but bound to other particles , nature might `` abhor '' it 's unbound existence . 
  kinda like ( on the less micro scale ) fluorine ... 
   that would backfire so badly it could bring the whole organization down . 
  in what universe ? 
   much easier for the tsa to simply ignore and say `` no comment '' if the story was true . 
  or , maybe the tsa jackboot who posted the video did it just for lols ... 
  oh , i see ... afghanistan = pakistan = iraq , and taliban = al quaida and above all , all the brown people are evil ...

  well , after what the cat did to his hamster ... 
  they forgot `` happy ending '' ... , 
  there is a `` 2012 '' hysteria ? 
  i have n't noticed ... although there 's lot of dudes who have nothing better to do than to `` debunk '' 2012 ... 
  i 'm not sure who is full of it ... 
  i did n't say it was not her , i said it 's not inconceivable jackboots cut portions of the video off , and that 's what she is apparently saying too ... , 
   in the video , it looks as though my son is playing happily in his stroller while i am being searched with a wand . 
  obviously this is the big discrepancy with my story , since he was not in my sight at that time , and one that i too am thoroughly looking into . 
  neither of the two phone calls i placed while seated in security are in the video either .
