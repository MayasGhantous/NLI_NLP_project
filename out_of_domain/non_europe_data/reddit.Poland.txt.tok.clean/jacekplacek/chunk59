  what is shown in the video is incomplete as it leaves out when the security agent took my son to a separate area and out of my sight . 
  this matter is one that is being handled between my family and the tsa . 
  ok , i 'll bite ... what can you do better on apple than on a pc ? 
  everything ? 
  does it mean typing your reddit comments as well ? 
  is apple keyboard faster ? 
  easier to type ? 
  reads your mind ? 
   an irrational hatred of macintoshes, 
  how come the apple lovers are so fricking overreacting ? 
  i just asked what can you do better on apple , for woz 's sake ... 
  like this . 
  computer ? 
  off, 
  hmm ... cute ... but does it shut the computer off `` better '' than the pc 's `` start/shutdown '' ? 
  ( or the power button ), 
   im not sure what your point is . 
  you said you can do stuff `` better '' on mac . 
  i 'm just trying to squeeze out of you the `` better '' thingies . 
  so far you just taking about your preferences ... 
  i have no problem with that . 
  just say you prefer mac , do n't pretend you can do stuff `` better '' ... 
   but you could not do both . 
  is that a challenge ? 
  if the price is right , i 'm up to do the networking/programing part on windows ... 
  could you make it even less readable ... ? 
   the same argument was used in vietnam and ended up being completely false, 
  you mean nothing bad happened to the south vietnamese after commies took over ? 
   no regard to the ethnicity of people in the area has exacerbated the conflicts between shia ad sunni, 
  _ no comment _, 
  haha ... cute ... what i mean , dear watson , is the dark gray text on the black background is not the ultimate in readability ... but it 's your site , you can do whatever you want ... 
  `` controlling capitalism '' ? 
   if americans had hijacked a plane and crashed it into another country they would have been caught if they remained in america , even if the most remote areas . 
  no they would n't . 
  they would be dead . 
  if the mastermind was bill clinton , are you sure us would extradite him ? 
  not a former president but someone like [ lafayette ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gilbert_du_motier,_marquis_de_lafayette ) or [ ko\u015bciuszko ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tadeusz_ko%c5%9bciuszko ) . 
  would americans , back then , extradite ko\u015bciuszko to russia if ekaterina said he was a terrorist ... ? 
  yes they did . 
  if bush provided some evidence of his involvement . 
  [ read a book ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glkl_epnsp8&amp;feature=player_embedded# ), 
   i must have been absolutely horrible . 
  yes , you must have ... , 
  hmm ... since only one guy died from russian roulette in the same timeframe , russian roulette must be pretty safe ... 
  i see , she would have had been much better off if she was attacked by wolves ... 
  she was not supposed to get attacked by coyotes either ... 
  my comment was in respose to :, 
   in california , from 1986 through 1998 , exactly two people died from mountain lion attacks , whereas in one year alone , over 4,000 people died in traffic accidents , including 800 pedestrians, 
   neither lafayette or ko\u015bciuszko actually were terrorists, 
  i bet you tsarina ekaterina velikaya would disagree ( at least in case of ko\u015bciuszko ) ... 
  no matter what you think about taliban , they did not attacked us . 
  and in their eyes bin laden is a guy who fought for their freedom ... 
  well , slavery is alive and kicking in the ole usofa ... 
   there are no indians . 
  some guys murdered them all about 300 years or some such ago . 
  hmm ... wikipedia says it 's about 1.6 % indians and 8 % mestizo ... perhaps they did n't murder them all ... 
  `` i find it especially ironic that most of those who criticize serial killers more often than not have never murdered anybody . '', 
   that sounds like a potentially worrisome move away from evidence-based medicine . 
  the whole `` can only get the drug if you have prescription '' mindset is a racket . 
  i can make up my mind on what i need myself . 
  if i 'm not sure i will ask the doctor but most of the time it 's just waste of the time/money ... 
  yeah , i know , you just ** have to ** save me from myself ... 
  old communist ... , 
  are you also outraged about everybody being forced to buy their own food or starve ... ? 
  ... some animals are more equal ... 
  yes . 
  and here you are , wasting bytes for frivolous posts on reddit ... shame on you !, 
   every child is taught music appreciation, 
  ... not to mention `` human body fragrance appreciation '' ... 
   of all the things my taxes pay for , the library is the one i would gladly pay more for . 
  is there any law preventing you from donating ? 
   i 'm curious ... is there any combination of facts where they are , in fact , qualified to govern ? 
  nope . 
  good for you . 
  but apparently , by your own admission , you do n't donate enough and would like people with guns to force you to donate more ... 
  now , why do you , guys , even bother to give the scum the attention they crave ? 
  still , does n't make sense . 
  for them it 's publicity - by making them newsworthy you actually increase their recruitment ... 
  so , your attention span is too short to remember what you wrote 4 hours ago ? 
  let me help you :, 
   of all the things my taxes pay for , the library is the one i would gladly pay more for . 
  < sigh /  ... you are saying you want to be taxed more to pay for the library . 
  iow , you think you are not paying enough . 
  taxes are compulsory , meaning if you do n't pay the men with guns will show up and make you pay or shoot you . 
   do you have actual evidence to support that claim ? 
  is n't it just common sense ? 
  if potential followers do n't hear about them they will not join them ... 
   the media already pays an inordinate amount of attention to the fringe-right , at least where i am from ( southern california ) , so i do n't see it makes a difference . 
  hey !, 
  i am fringe-right , they are nazi scum ... , 
  and media pays attention to the confrontations . 
  if their pathetic demonstration was ignored by the public , it would be ignored by the media as well ... 
  have trouble following logic ? 
   nazi scum are by definition fringe right, 
  by your definition , perhaps ... look at it this way : you would n't like to be bundled with the likes of pol-pot , would you ? 
  and i 'm pretty sure if public ignored them , media would too ... making it a confrontation you pretty much assure media presence ... 
  sometimes there 's a long line at cashier check-out and no line at self check out ... 
   it would be like finding out nabisco had a division making small arms . 
  they do n't ? 
  i 'm not trolling , i 'm trying to educate ... but you can only lead the horse to the water ...
