  yeah , i know ... 
  i talk like a fag and my shit is all retarded ... 
  but that 's , precisely , the difference between donation ( voluntary ) and tax ( compulsory ) ... the `` compulsory '' bit meaning that , ultimately , it is backed by the guys with guns , whether you like it or not ... 
  did you even read your own link ? 
   a philosophy calling for lower taxes , limited government regulation of business and investing , a strong national defense , and individual financial responsibility for personal needs ( as retirement income or health-care coverage ), 
  kinda does sound like `` small government '' to me ... 
  the times certainly have changed . 
  but they will change again ... pretty soon , i 'm afraid . 
  wait till they destroy the economy ( both parties seem to be hell bent on this course of action ) , you might see teotwawki ... 
   this guy is a drop-out , drug addict that has ego issues . 
  he uses circular logic and a strange combination of hate and charisma to control the thoughts of people that call themselves `` dittoheads '' . 
   wake up people - it 's time to realize that we 're all americans and reject this culture of hate . 
  do i sense some dissonance here ... ? 
  do n't you have / r/stalinist to attend to ... ? 
  well , i think you are on the brink of getting it ... 
   but at least we can more easily call bullshit when right wing shills say `` pot has no accepted medical use . '', 
  `` right wing shills '' ? 
  like obama ? 
  why did n't you kill it ? 
   something tells me pulling out a pistol on a college campus and shooting a deer in front of 30 people is a bad idea . 
  that would depend on which college ... 
   did n't the thing call for improved rail transport too ? 
  no , that would be `` american millennium '' ... 
  moral of the story ? 
  if someone is following you and you chose to confront them , kill them and then `` shovel and shut-up '' ... 
  it says : `` during the time for which he was elected '' ... but she can be excused on technicality , she is not a `` he '' ... 
  i think ... 
   i think its something i could actually see doing for a living . 
  if you do n't love doing it , forget it . 
  there are no more miserable guys than programmers who do n't love programming ... 
  actually , this is perpetuated by insecure assholes who are afraid of girls who have any experience and can tell how lousy lovers they are ... 
  insecure much ? 
   i just would n't be in love with what i do . 
  that 's the problem . 
  any ( almost ) other job you can get away with `` enjoying yourself to an extent '' , programming , imo , you will be miserable after a short while ... 
   we did this to save our own asses . 
  iow , it 's ok to kill hundreds of thousands civilians to save your ass ... nice morals you have . 
  would you slit the throat of the five year old girl if it could save your ass ... ? 
  oh , so if your neighbor does something nasty to somebody i can come in and kick ** your ** ass ... ? 
  or are you saying the inhabitants of hiroshima and nagasaki were the same guys/gals who did the nasty ... ? 
  hmm ... 
  i guess , you will agree that the 911 was a legit response to the america 's assholness in the middle east , then ... ? 
  if you are asking me out , no . 
  the government is n't any more imaginary than any other gang ... 
  so , how is that any different ? 
  america bombed civilian targets to force japan to surrender . 
  jihadists flew the planes into civilian targets to `` persuade '' us to get out of middle east ... 
  but not too many would excuse it ... 
  iow she does piss off all the right people !, 
  palin in 2012 !, 
  hmm , it 's kinda like bin laden dissing dubya ... will have the opposite effect . 
  frankly , all the assholes i hate are foaming at the mouth at the very mention of palin . 
  that , in my eyes , makes her the best possible candidate ... , 
  liberals decry the wars as fiscally irresponsible ( or , at least , they did back when dubya was in office ) . 
  where 's the outrage over the healthcare bill ... ? 
   the other was a paramilitary act , which did not occur during a declared war . 
  [ it did not ? 
   osama 's [ ... ] declaration of war against the americans in 1996 as well as the 1998 fatwa . 
  ok , as you wish : `` i , jacekplacek , hereby nominate sarah palin for the candidacy of us president office . '', 
  all the better . 
  i would hate your kind to love me . 
  so , the immoral acts become moral if the perpetrators wear uniforms ? 
  well , when i asked how it was any different , obviously i meant `` morally different '' ... the acts themselves have precious little in common , other than being mass murders . 
   a morally bankrupt military, 
  is there any other kind ? 
  wow , judging by the amount of downvotes , reddit must be chockfull of insecure , small-dicked , misogynist assholes ... who can not get laid and rationalize it by calling the girls sluts ... 
  what difference does it make ? 
  let 's see ... would the act be any less morally repugnant if it were saddam hussein who masterminded it ? 
  do n't need the money , honey . 
  post your pic , and we will see ... 
  why ? 
  you think that in the anarchist society there will be some dude enforcing what you can or can not do an how much to charge/not charge for it ? 
  when you grow up , you will figure it out ... 
  so , why do you think people would stop being kind to each other ? 
  hmm , i 'm not sure i follow ... all these factors are present now , yet people still do stuff for others out of kindness . 
  why would it change _ sans _ government ? 
  sorry , pal . 
  wrong plumbing ... 
  the institution name being different from what you wrote in the title might have something to do with it ... we libertarians do n't like sloppiness . 
  prophet algor ( gaia bless him ) is not going to like it ... 
   impose wage slavery ( wage labor ), 
  how can you `` impose '' wage labor ? 
  either you have willing laborers or you do n't ... 
  strange ... do n't collectors ( usually ) buy stuff they collect ... ? 
  funny , i have n't inherited a fortune and i do work for a `` capitalist '' ... out of my own volition . 
  i used to run my own consulting business but i found it more convienient to become a `` wage slave '' ... 
  well , i actually do n't believe my employer ** owes ** me my job ... so , no , it would n't left any kind of `` taste '' in my mouth . 
   if you want to work hard , you should be able to , and you should be able to earn a comfortable living . 
  what is preventing you to set up your own business ? 
  oh , your beloved massa in the government , sorry ... never mind ... 
  ok , what would you consider `` more fair ? '', 
  so , enlighten me ... how would i make a living in your `` better '' system scenario ... 
  perhaps some people might have trouble reading russian ... ? 
   if you start your own company you do n't have to answer to anyone but yourself, 
  ... and your customers . 
  it 's ironic that pravda seems to be ** more ** trustworthy than major us media nowadays ... 
  funny , you learn your reasoning skills from the neocons who accused opponents of the patriot act of being pro-terrorist ... 
  the problem is i actually do n't fancy that kind of setup ... so , it would not be better for me . 
  nothing prevents you from doing it right now ... 
  well , at least they are not wearing tons of protective gear and stop every couple of minutes to catch a breath .
