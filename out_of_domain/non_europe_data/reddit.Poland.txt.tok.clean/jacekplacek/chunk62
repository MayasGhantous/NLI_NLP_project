  he can find all the `` sections responsible for '' all apparent functions of said plane . 
  he would have pretty much the some view of the drone you have of the brain ... 
   the drone has no piloting mechanism, 
  of course it has . 
  would n't be able to fly otherwise ... 
   find me something that the brain does that ca n't be explained by brain tissue , and we can talk, 
  where to start ... self awareness , free will , love , appreciation of art , music etc. . . 
  sure , it has some parts you still do n't quite understand so you can just handwave them off ... 
   an emergent phenomena in extremely complex , highly self referential systems, 
  certainly , you would have no trouble reproducing it , would you . 
  why , the transmitter/receiver part . 
  remember , you do n't know about electromagnetism ... 
  the same way the determinist brain researchers handwave off the stuff they do n't understand in the brain ... perhaps because there 's something coordinating the function of the brain/mind they just do n't know about ... 
   sure , give me a willing lady and nine months, 
  well , you can not reproduce it then , you just can let the nature do the work ... 
   simply because our understanding is incomplete , though , gives absolutely no excuse for invoking bullshit supernatural explanations, 
  who says anything about `` supernatural '' ? 
  just because there seems to be something in the working of mind/brain that we do n't know , does n't mean it has to be magic . 
  you are , actually , resorting to the circular reasoning - given the laws of physics/forces that we know about , you are assuming that the brain has to be explained in the terms/framework you are familiar with and ending up with the conclusion there 's no free will . 
  the one that can not even handle their [ web page ] ( http://www.case.edu/visit/map/dir.html ) ? 
  it 's less than 5 % of speed of light . 
  why is it absurd ? 
   for objects ** orbiting the sun **, 
  that 's assuming they did get it right ... since it 's `` new '' it could be an outsider ... 
  i do n't see anybody upvoting you ... 
  what do they teach in american schools nowadays ? 
  nasa needs to be scrapped , they hinder space exploration . 
  you are being naive ... 
  `` another '' space program ? 
  nasa has a space program ? 
  they sure fooled me ... 
  but , yes , between branson and rutan there is hope for a space exploration . 
  i see lots of work for dr kevorkian next year ... 
  mr bumble explained that long time ago : `` law is a ass , a idiot . '', 
  red spider . 
  common derogatory name of communists apparatchiks back then in poland ... , 
  well , i 'd be more impressed if he invited the homeless teenagers to sleep in his palace ... 
   here in belgium at least there 's no `` elsewhere '' . 
  there 's always `` elsewhere '' . 
  i might prefer to go to the witch doctor , yet your government is going to tax me anyways . 
   my point was only to show that , if you choose socialized medicine , that does n't mean you ca n't choose anymore . 
  you do n't get this `` freedom '' thingie , do you . 
   in one system , people are free to live in anything from homestead sized to state sized communes in voluntary cooperation , while others are allowed to opt out and create any business , or live any lifestyle of their choosing ... and in the other , they are not allowed to opt out and attempts to do so are met with literal physical violence . 
  unfortunately , this simple truth seems to be lost on most americans as well ... :(, 
  sarah pailin 2012 !, 
  she pisses off all the right people . 
   i 'd think that if afghanistan was a little bit more-conquerable , most of that scenery might still stand - with some soviet influences , but hey : is that moon landscape better than some little political disagreements ? 
  ` ay , ay ; ` tis not enough to pain me ;, 
  perhaps the collar 's mark by which they chain me . ', 
  ` chain !, 
  chain you !, 
  what !, 
  run you not , then ,, 
  just where you please , and when ? ', 
  ` not always , sir ; but what of that ? ', 
  ` enough for me , to spoil your fat !, 
  it ought to be a precious price, 
  which could to servile chains entice ;, 
  or , if the above quote is too obscure for you :, 
  '' is life so dear , or peace so sweet , as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery ? 
  forbid it , almighty god !, 
  i know not what course others may take ; but as for me , give me liberty or give me death ! '', 
  nope . 
  they are different species , they can not mate ... 
  time to get one of [ these ] ( http://consumermaven.files.wordpress.com/2006/12/mossbergm590a1.jpg ) ... 
  well , then it 's time to get one of [ these ] ( http://guns4u.info/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/162810_large.jpg ) ... , 
  do n't worry , pretty soon you will have to register with federal government to go for a walk ... 
  it 's simple really , he was a quintessential geek - geeks love bacon and narwhals ... 
  i dunno ... if the alternative is sleeping ? 
  ... and now , do the same for cnn ... and msnbc , and ... 
  is n't that , kinda , like submitting to a would-be rapist as a way of avoiding being raped ... ? 
   simply , companies should be employee owned , profits should go back towards the employees , and executive positions should be elected not by shareholders , but by the employees - by definition people who actually know what 's going on and are in the best position to judge the ceo 's performance . 
  there 's nothing that stops you from starting an employee-owned company ... 
  he did n't follow the advice : `` never , ever talk to cops ... '', 
   marines are cool . 
  yelling `` sir , yes sir ! '', 
  is cool ... ? 
   and in times of crisis any trickle down is reverted into the upstream splurge of bailouts, 
  the attribute of the free markets ? 
  is the guy an idiot or does he just play one on the internet ? 
  actually , it 's ** more ** sensational ... how the sub is powered is much less important than what kind of ordnance can it deliver ... 
  so , where are the pic , the vid and the lulz ? 
  funny , when clinton rakes the dough for speeches , it seams to be ok with you ... 
  i 'm not begrudging clinton , just pointing out op 's hypocrisy ... 
  well , the author tries to make a case for free markets being `` baaaad '' and throws bailouts in as an example ... and yes , the rich ( some of them at least ) have way too much political power . 
  the main reason being the politicians have way too much power and are willing and happy to sell it to the highest bidder ... 
  get rid of the power of the politicians and most of the ( political ) power of the rich disappears ... 
  op had ample opportunity to respond to my comment ... 
  unfortunately for enviro-nazis , the `` high mpg '' vehicles do n't sell too well ... 
  so , killing brown ( or blue ) people for payment from government is noble , but killing them for payment from corporation is evil ? 
   but if the sole purpose of something is to sell product i refuse to call it art, 
  all the religious stuff ( by dudes like davinci , buonarotti , boccaccio etc ) must not be art either . 
  it 's sole purpose was to sell christianity , after all ... 
   i think they even had an article about sarah palin that was entirely positive and uplifting . 
  so , they do n't share ** all ** of your biases ... definitely not reliable ... , 
   but who programs the robots ? 
  why , diebold , of course ... , 
  costa rica ? 
  i thought this honor goes to belize ... 
  is there anybody who finds conan funny ?
