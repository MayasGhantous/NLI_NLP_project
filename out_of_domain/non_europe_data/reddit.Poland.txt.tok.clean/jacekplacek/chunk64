   but storm in english also carries the meaning of a military charge, 
  i was not aware of that , english is not my native language ... 
  on the rose bush ? 
  it was n't the off duty cop that should bother you , it 's his on duty colleagues ... 
  maybe you missed it , but the video clearly shows uniformed cops jumping the guy ... 
  well , you made it clear you do n't mind robbing other people to get to feel charitable . 
  but do you really have to be so smug about it ? 
   yes , it 's terrible that a very small fraction of your total earnings goes to the aid of people who desperately need it . 
  my heart bleeds . 
  know what . 
  i can do my giving ( and deciding who to give to ) myself , thankyouverymuch ... do n't need the government goons to do it for me . 
  you may not understand that but there 's a big difference between sex and rape . 
   minister bert koenders doubled that amount , as he had promised earlier on thursday, 
  oh , how generous of massa koenders ... < snicker /  almost as generous as the neighborhood 's gangstas collecting `` donations '' at the point of a gun ... 
  `` the billion people in the world living in slums and going without sufficient food '' live in such lassez-faire capitalist countries like haiti , cuba , sudan , north korea ... and , yes , venezuela ... 
  `` those who do n't learn from history are doomed to repeat it . '', 
  you see , kid , yours are exactly the same arguments fascists and other statist scum were making ... 
  read `` mein kampf '' - you will be surprised how much do you agree with uncle adolph ... 
  what ? 
  do n't you know they did n't have the indoor plumbing or tv back then . 
  it had to be income tax that caused progress ... ( i 'm not mentioning the internet - everybody knows al gore created it ) , 
   he got his account suspended for using too much bandwidth, 
  good to know what company not to use ... 
  well , in that case there 's a tremendous opportunity for you - just start an isp that does give it 's customers bunch of ip addresses for free . 
  you will become a rich bastard in no time ... , 
  libertarians , of course ... , 
   is there anyone in the us who does not agree with this position ? 
  yes : all republicans , democrats , socialists , conservatives , liberals , greens , communists and neo-nazis . 
  amongst others ... 
  good point . 
  how so ? 
  you think democrats call them `` racist , redneck , gun-toting yahoos who cling to their religion '' because they do n't vote the way democrats would like ? 
  `` party that serves interests of the richest ? '', 
  interesting , it seems to me that the democrats are on average much richer than republicans . 
  you mean they act against their interests when in power ? 
  are you really that naive ? 
   convinced to switch sides by crude religious and cultural `` appeals '' that had little to do with reality, 
  ... and you still do n't understand how condescending this statement is ... 
  it depends on how you view the marriage : if you think of it as a commitment of the interested parties , it does n't depend on the state ... 
  of course it 's condescending . 
  after all you do n't make the same assumption about the `` people that work hard all day , raise families , and have little time to devote to politics '' who vote democrats ... 
  if i wanted to be condescending , i 'd say the democrat voters are easily lured by fraudulent promises of getting stuff for free and driven by envy towards those better off than themselves ... 
  while the republican voters , not being dissociated from reality , know that `` there ai n't no such thing as a free lunch '' . 
  hmm ... for some strange reason , you seem to believe that the real party of the rich ( democratic party , that is - do n't believe me ? 
  check it out . ), 
  is acting against it 's own interests . 
  how naive . 
  well , that kinda explains why democrats won the last time ... those who know tanstaafl did n't have anybody to vote for ... 
  libertarians are not against cooperation , they are against ** forced ** cooperation ... 
  you did n't reduce , you just have n't expand . 
  hypocrite !, 
  nah , too close to bureaucratic parasites ... as soon as the colony starts prospering they will send a taxman ... 
  and i 'm saying they would be voting even more against their own interests if they voted democrats ... liberal progressives represent interests of liberal progressives , nothing more , nothing less ... 
  maybe . 
  does n't explain why you vote ** for ** them ... , 
  works for me . 
  even better if that was all they did all the time . 
  they ( both presidents and congressthingies ) would n't have time to do real damage that way ... 
  or you could go straight to the [ original ] ( http://cafehayek.com/2008/07/bastiatian-wisd.html ) ... 
  does it mean [ lysenko ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trofim_lysenko ) was right ... ? 
   friedman gave us the withholding tax, 
  ehmm ... that would be the `` tax withholding '' ... 
  why ? 
  do you believe it is a sacrilege not to show obama all the time ? 
  no , it should be `` arse '' ... unless princess meant `` her donkey '' ... , 
  i do n't know . 
  why do you ask me ? 
  i do n't presume to dictate to the private cable tv channel how to run their business ... 
  do you also believe you know what i am `` supposed '' to post on reddit ? 
  spot on !, 
  and what the fuck one has to do with the other ? 
  so some guy who supports some republican candidate admits being a racist - does it mean all republicans are racist ? 
  hell , there is at least one democrat senator who was a kkk member , what does it say about democrats ? 
  yup , you guessed it : zip . 
  apparently , most responders missed the reference ... , 
  well , as you know perfectly well ( or should know , anyway ) there 's a certain percentage of the vaccinated that will react adversely to the vaccine , perhaps even die . 
  did you consider ( with universal vaccination ) how many you are prepared to sacrifice to keep one guy alive ? 
   today is saturday, 
  you 're not getting out much , are you . 
  that means either you are a goatse-sized asshole or just pretend to be one ... 
  well , it 's saturday here in us , allright , but it 's not in china ... , 
  i do n't know , but i am sure they are not `` the most fun to be had in the world '' ... 
  and op should disallow that lest the dog grows to feel she is the dominant one ... 
  that 's `` global warming heretics '' to you ... 
  really . 
  ... and west bank has fewer olive trees than it did 50 years ago ... 
  jeeeez ... you could really use some practice taking pictures ... 
   human life has no intrinsic value either way, 
  i assume then , you would n't mind someone offing you tomorrow ... if you are insured your family will benefit , if you are not there 's really no loss to anybody . 
  i said `` democrats on average '' ... evidence for the ones in congress is pretty easy to find ... 
  very reluctantly ... ( unless one has a martyr complex . ), 
  ... not anymore ... 
  the way i see it , you are the troll there and the respondents have a lot of patience explaining simple stuff to you . 
  teflon ? 
  what 's a big deal ? 
  at least they have n't tazered , shot or beaten up anybody ... , 
   we 've poisoned the world enough with out presence, 
  as a , unequivocally , noble being you should do the world a favor ( and set en example , perhaps ) and slit your own throat . 
  omg !, 
  his awesomessimo dear leader barack the magnificent farted and not every channel immediately reported on it !,
