  off with their heads !, 
  yup . 
  that 's bunch of mighty good reasons , allright . 
  and uncle stalin had bunch of mighty good reasons to disallow `` kulaks '' to keep part of their harvests too ... 
  yup . 
  dubya , obomba - they all look the same to me : blood sucking parasites ... 
  not unwarranted ... as soon as you start insisting that the rights of `` society '' beat the rights of individual humans , who knows where you gon na end up . 
  there 's nothing different ( on principle ) between zoning and holocaust ... 
  well , q was a known prankster , after all ... , 
  well , still in the reversed scenario the husband would be fucked royally , no matter what the wife said at the trial ... 
  now , if only the libertarian party stopped identify itself as republicans ... 
  `` we are all neocons now ... '', 
  so , you are arguing necessity ... do you have any `` line in a sand '' necessity is not going to make you cross ? 
  the problem is you can not market it ( for that particular purpose ) unless fda approves . 
  to get the fda approval you need to spend hundreds of millions ... but once you do , everybody and their uncle can start marketing it ... 
   it would give itself away by sucking up useful energy and dumping entropy, 
  unless they are in process of building the damn thing ... , 
  how do we know they do n't ? 
  they do n't actually have to eat all the energy , just some of it ... 
  the process known as _ voir dire _ , which is anglo-norman for `` jury tampering '' ... , 
  picatore hosting ? 
  but dui laws did ... 
   there is a reasonable amount of evidence to suggest that at least on a macro scale there is nothing that is random, 
  there 's a reasonable amount of conjecture , evidence - not so much ... 
   news flash ? 
  where the hell have you been buddy ? 
  ... that must have been some rock . 
  most of the time it 's a good idea to rtfa before commenting ... just sayi 'n, 
  hey , if all you pinko commie bastards really leave , i 'd love sarah to win ... < g , d & r / , 
  nobody ( other than adolescent left-wingers ) does ... 
  funny how they cite mark twain , pretend to be `` educated '' by using his birth name and then misspell it ... 
  ... kinda like the girl wearing mini skirt to the bar had a hand in her being raped . 
  the rapist 's reaction was `` entirely predictable and completely avoidable . '', 
  ch \u2084 + 2 o \u2082 \u2192 co \u2082 + 2 h \u2082 o - 890 kj/mol could have something to do with it ... 
   the palestinian arab leader mohammad amin al-husayni was hanging out in nazi germany, 
  omg !, 
  some arab was `` hanging out in nazi germany . '', 
  arabs are evil ! ... 
  btw some americans were financing nazi germany - all americans must be evil too ... 
   the defining protocol of the internet is ip ( thus the name ) and it is not hierarchical . 
  ip is a transport protocol . 
  it could be argued the real defining protocol of the internet is http ... 
  i hope you planted some kiddie porn at their place and called the cops on them ... 
  if you were a cop , would you rather go after armed and dangerous gangstas , risk your butt and gain nothing in return if you managed to catch them or would you rather go after mellow pothead or some dude looking for a piece of tail , no risk involved and the car and other stuff you can confiscate and keep most of it for yourself ... ? 
  [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dred_scott_v._sandford] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dred_scott_v._sandford ), 
   obama is a liar and a hypocrite . 
  well , he is a politician - what did you expect , messiah ? 
  [ exothermic reaction ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exothermic_reaction ), 
   even extreme libertarians understand [ t ] he requirement for police forces , state-controlled or private . 
  not really , i do n't . 
   presumably these jerks would still be jerks , so what 's to prevent them from doing this whenever they wanted, 
  they can not add insult to injury and charge you with aggravated assault ... 
   i believe there are plenty of bad cops , but i have also known plenty of honorable , hard working officers . 
  sure , i have no doubt there were plenty of `` honorable , hard working '' stasi officers too ... 
   if you have private companies enforcing the law, 
  i do n't . 
  who is stopping bubba the carpenter and his buddies from locking you up ? 
   yes , let 's compare the stasi to a community police force . 
  what 's wrong with that ? 
  stasi were the police force ... oh , i see - `` it could n't happen here '' syndrome ... 
  i 'm well aware who stasi were , meine liebe dude , but what does it have to do with the point i was making ? 
  anybody with an iq higher than the room temperature should figure out stasi was used strictly for illustrative purpose . 
  i could say kgb , or zomo or even tamil tigers . 
  the point being that any organization , no matter how vile , can have `` honorable , hard working '' members ( although the `` honorable '' part would imply `` clueless '' very often ) . 
   ok , if one has private companies enforcing the law . 
  better ? 
  i know what you meant and i was responding to exactly that . 
   or were you implying you 'd go for complete anarchy, 
  yes . 
   and whoever shoots best wins ? 
  does not follow . 
   we had that too for a while , in many places and times . 
  yes . 
   did n't work out too well . 
  sometimes did not , sometimes did ... at least did work much better than the current system . 
  do you really wonder about that ... ? 
  i 'm not quite sure if it was a right venue ... do you want to make an impression you endorse dresden bombing ? 
  what 's a sauce for a goose ... it 's never irrelevant when the right-winger kills somebody ... 
  so you have no bloody idea what the post is all about and yet , you feel perfectly capable of commenting ? 
   i read the article, 
  no , you have not . 
   he 's a violent political extremist, 
  the shooter was a `` she '' not a `` he '' ... 
   best explanation ever !, 
  lamest explanation ever . 
  and incorrect to boot . 
  forgot to take your meds , eh ? 
  the problem is really not in harnessing chaotic process , it 's in the effects of failure . 
  the cars fail all the time - worst case scenario : out of control car slamming into something/somebody/many somebodies . 
  now imagine worst case scenario for a failing space elevator ... 
  what percentage of your income do you feel is fair to give to the mafia in `` protection money '' ... ? 
  let 's put it this way : if your protection fees were to bring you profit , guido would n't have to threaten capping your knees ... 
  why we support a ban on french philosophers - burqas . 
  no , smart ass whitey , he was an angry progressive ... 
  nothing wrong with retaliation ... 
   people respond to the market . 
  yup . 
  that 's what guards at auschwitz did too ... 
  why not ? 
  well , the gestapo or ss did n't make laws either ...
