  i guess all the resistance members were really terrorists ... 
  well , one could argue , occasional killings could serve the humanity as a whole - first as a culling of particularly bad traits , and second as a warning to others to , maybe , reconsider applying for these kind of jobs ... , 
  not gon na get any sympathy from me ... your wife might be the person who extorted over $ 30,000 in `` penalties '' from me about a decade ago ... 
  `` those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it . '', 
  what ? 
  you some kind of holocaust denier , or something ? 
  perhaps you do , perhaps you do n't . 
  sure , our fascism is a `` kinder , gentler '' variety ... 
  slovenians are natives of slovenia ( formerly part of yugoslavia ) and slovaks are natives of slovakia ( formerly part of czechoslovakia ) . 
  glad to help ... , 
  holocaust - no , but we have our wacos ; plenty of wars though , and them arabs do n't seem to agree with you on `` not racist '' ... so , yes , a little bit kinder and a little bit gentler ... 
  there were some fascists regimes before who did n't do holocausts or racist shit either . 
  still , they could n't get no respect back then . 
  i guess times are a changin ' ... 
  like what ? 
  if you are not interested you do n't have to read it ... 
  english , motherfucker , use it !, 
  you seem to be unable to focus . 
  i 'll try again : what 's wrong with the concept of retaliation ? 
  and the dude in question , if i read him correctly , was retaliating . 
  hey , the dude wanted to off himself - this way he made the tv . 
  ... or because he is an asshole ... 
  now , i wonder why did you phrase it the way you did . 
  `` community keeps stealing from blind musician . 
  people help him out . '', 
  would describe it as well ... 
  is it also your understanding that states can compel you to testify against yourself , do n't need a warrant to arrest you , can use cruel and unusual punishment ... etc , etc. 
  actually , i know the origin and the original meaning ( which is not necessary the only meaning in polish ) ... either way you are still the barking chihuahua ... 
  btw : your attempt at babelfishing failed in a very spectacular way , puppy . 
  because `` vi vere just following ze orders '' does n't cut it anymore ... 
  maybe . 
  well , after 65 al-quida `` second in command `` s , 37 `` top taliban leaders '' and 13 `` taliban headquarters '' it becomes slightly `` meh '' ... , 
  which brings another issue : if greeks really were all ( or almost all ) homosexuals that would mean homosexuality is a `` nurture '' not a `` nature '' ... which kinda justifies guys like him worrying that homosexuals are going to `` corrupt the youth '' ... 
  only idiots ( or really desperate ) use debit . 
  if some asshole gets hold of your cc # and maxes the card out , you still have time to straighten that up with the bank . 
  if it happens to debit card , your checks start bouncing before you can even say `` oh , shit ! '', 
  so , you saying you would be better off if you did n't have money for your `` necessities '' ? 
  perhaps they were n't ** real ** necessities ... 
  [ _ citation needed _ ], 
  so , the card was useful to you . 
  why , then , you wish you did n't have one ? 
  slaves bonking their women ... ? 
  only idiots do n't realize `` checks bouncing '' applies to electronic payments as well ... iow if you use your account to pay your bills and use debit cards on the same account , do n't whine if you get thrown out of your place or get electricity/internet cut off ... 
   homosexuals are people that feel attracted to people of the same sex ... not people who have sexual relations with people of the same sex, 
  hmm ... maybe it 's just me , but i 've never had sex with someone i was n't attracted to ... 
   so why are n't these liberal cities , small college towns , and practically all of europe collapsing under the weight of their massive gay orgies if it 's so easy to pressure the youth into being gay ? 
  lol , reading a little bit too much into what i 've said ? 
  but i 'll bite anyway : how do you explain , then , apparent preference of the ( ancient ) greek males for sex with other males over the sex with females ? 
  perhaps the contemporary american/european culture is not tolerant enough to lead to the `` massive gay orgies '' ? 
  perhaps it will get there in time ? 
   my bank has debit protection but not as good as cc protection, 
  will your bank pay your bounced checks fees ? 
   you can also use paypay in conjuction with debt card . . and you can use paypal to generate temp cc numbers . 
  i can also withdraw cash , buy a money order and mail it . 
  what 's your point ? 
  [ _ the rest of your post _ ] ??? 
  will they pay your bounced checks fees ? 
  will they explain to your landlord that it 's not your fault the check bounced ? 
  it 's hilariously funny how much you assume about me and how wrong you are in your assumptions ... , 
  nevertheless, 
   i can assure you that having no rules or a high level of social tolorance does not make you change your innate sexual preference any more than oppressive rules do . 
  leaves me quite puzzled why you do n't question either your understanding of human sexuality or our view of ancient greece ... 
  they still could be bonking their women under duress ... , 
   because of course fifty different programs with different organizations , different it systems , different funding and staffing levels , and fifty more major communications channels will of course be more efficient . 
  hmmm ... 
  i guess all the different grocery or department store chains must be very inefficient ... we should combine them into one !, 
  let 's call them [ gum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gum_%28department_store%29 ) ... 
  [ _ citation needed _ ], 
  or , perhaps , all the statist nitwits should just move to cuba ... 
  after you . 
  so , you believe the governments are imbued with some special magic properties that allow them to disregard reality ? 
  this link does not support your thesis . 
  how is it strawman ? 
   are you dense ? 
   this comment sets up some magical argument that i never made, 
  it 's an argument you implied . 
  all human endeavors tend to be more efficient in presence of competition . 
  you assert government is more efficient absent competition . 
  since this seems to contradict reality magic is the only explanation i can think of . 
  if you have another explanation , please share . 
  if not then what ? 
  do you have an argument ? 
  or just do n't care about arguments because you have faith ? 
  your `` sarcastic '' comment implied something that is not true , that 's it . 
  if you do n't want people to respond to your `` sarcastic '' comments do n't make them . 
  mild ? 
  i 'm trying ( unsuccessfully ) to get out of you what exactly did you mean . 
  i do n't give a rat ass if you `` attack my views '' ... you say clueless things be prepared to be called on it . 
   there was nothing `` clueless '' about what i said, 
  uhmm ... how to break it to you ... 
  it 's not a clueless post , it 's a post trying to show how clueless the op is ... and still remains so . 
  well , if you had other explanation you would say it already . 
  since you ca n't you paint yourself as clueless ... 
  neither do you . 
  hmm ... how much does a visit to a doctor costs ? 
  was she really so destitute she could n't afford it ? 
  looks like an owl to me - not an abyss ... , 
  should n't that be punishment enough ... ? 
   the roads are designed from the ground up to support travel at a higher rate of speed, 
  so are american interstate highways ...
