  hope !, 
  change !, 
  that was a good one !, 
  now i have to wipe the coffee off my monitor ... 
  not in _ tubendeutsch _ ... , 
  not really ... 
  i knew there was a reason i liked starbucks ... , 
  what 's the difference between `` previous '' and `` next in the opposite direction '' ? 
   gif and lzw and rs encryption were all new , interesting [ ... ] and difficult, 
  so was pythagoras ' theorem ... 
  i think mean meant the `` concept of sw patents is retarded '' . 
   also note this patent does n't describe a doubly linked list , it describes a singly linked list with an additional pointer that has some arbitrary ordering, 
  ... which doubly linked list is special case of ... 
  well , too bad for patents ... should i be able to patent the shoe lacing in a different pattern ? 
  believe me , i got the concept ... my question was aimed at bnr 's statement ... 
  apparently he knew how to fly ... so how was he fake ? 
  there was something called science ( of eugenics ) not too far ago that would advocate either castrating or simply `` euthanasing '' a moron like yourself . 
  as repulsive as you are , we `` libertards '' still want to let you live but , boy , is the castration option tempting ... , 
   that 's why pure libertarianism is a failed ideology, 
  we can see you think fascism is the best system ... 
  or democrat, 
  or atheist, 
  that 's why i made the comment ... , 
  i am being defensive ? 
  what about ? 
  please prove me wrong , i am an agnostic . 
  do you have a proof god does n't exist ? 
   see what i mean ? 
  nope , i do n't . 
  do you actually mean something ? 
  or did i step on your faith ? 
   afraid . 
  of what ? 
   you have to be confident enough to live in your own confidence . 
  was that supposed to be profound ? 
   your implication that you can prove an atheist wrong proves that you are not an agnostic . 
  the implication is only in your mind ... 
  do you really have so little imagination that you can not think of a god not covered by any religion ? 
  i do n't make any claims for nor against . 
  if you were n't so lazy you would make an effort and find some arguments for existence of a god ( for lack of a better name ) . 
  i did , i do n't necessary find them convincing , but you can not say there are no arguments ... 
   that 's just a excuse of cognitive laziness . 
  quite the contrary - it 's the ** only ** intellectually honest position . 
  so , do n't talk about it . 
   and again you weaseled out . 
  lol ... 
  i do n't know so i do n't make any claims . 
  you do n't know either but it does n't prevent you from talking ... 
   also for the trillion of other mythological an generally made up thinks . 
  it could pique your curiosity why of all the `` trillion mythological and generally made up things '' the concept of god is taken seriously by the very serious people , could n't it . 
   something does n't add up . 
  130 lap dances is $ 2600 at the most . 
  where are they getting $ 16,835 from ? 
  he was a great tipper ? 
  that too ... , 
   i have caught them myself, 
  you wrestled them ? 
  according to the documentaries on the discovery channel , ** everything ** is destroying the ecosystem of north america ... , 
   i would be out with the .40 in a flash and ribs for a month . 
  afraid it would be your ribs eaten ... 
   feeding them is a really bad idea, 
  ... unless you have plans for them already ... , 
  actually , my response was to `` or christian '' ... you can not prove non-existence of god any more than it 's existence ... 
  by definition , as a government employee , you live at the expense of people who have their money extorted from them . 
  i call you a scumbag and a parasite . 
  corrupt people make corrupt institution ... 
   i 'm a person, 
  [ _ citation needed _ ], 
   i 'm not a government employee . 
  i said i work for the government, 
  still a parasite . 
   and i 'm damn good at what i do, 
  so was dr. mengele ... 
   you 're part of the reason this country is going into the shitter - understanding only a half inch deep for topics that are a mile wide ( like the proper role of government ) . 
  so , there 's a proper role for assholes extorting at gunpoint money from productive people ? 
  is there a `` proper role '' for mafia too ? 
  ok , so corrupt institution makes corrupt people ... , 
  ohhh , ohhh parasite throws a hissy fit ... lol, 
  hmm ... kropotkin was a prince , bakunin 's family were russian nobles ... 
  besides it does really sound like an argument _ ad hominem _, 
  `` government big enough to give you what you want is big enough to take what you 've got . '', 
  i was looking at your link and thought : `` what the hell has haskell , it 's open source libraries and opera browser to do with the topic !? '', 
  and then i clicked it ... , 
  omg !, 
  he ignored the autoritah of the masters ' bodyguards ... 
  these parts of the planet used to be ( relatively ) free not to long ago . 
  well , it 's pretty well established that ( most ) people do n't really want freedom ... they go for bread and circuses instead all the time ... :(, 
  he forgot the pony ... 
   at least socialism teaches to care for your neighbour and help out the community as a whole . 
  or else . 
  bacon !, 
   i do n't think anyone ever claimed `` lol these stars look like tiny-ass specks , i feel like the biggest motherfucker in the universe '' . 
  [ _ raises hand _ ] i did , i did !, 
  admit it , you 'd like to hit it but you do n't want to think you might be gay ... 
  why is it considered more heinous when someone steals from dying person ? 
  it should be , really , an alleviating circumstance - she will not be needing her stuff anymore , after all ... 
   but should n't mr. stern should consider the government as a whole, 
  ok , i 'll bite ... what about it ? 
  or did you mean `` government as a hole '' we pour our money into ? 
  is it any worse than being quite well and having your jewelry ripped off ?
