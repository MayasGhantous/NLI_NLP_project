  when you are dying , you may not even notice ... 
   there is more to government that just the fcc, 
  sure . 
  and the fcc is one of the least oppressive government bodies ... 
   dem v. rep argument, 
  ... is a false dichotomy ... 
  well , the shooting did n't start yet ... are you afraid you might be a target ? 
   evidence has been presented . 
  i have an evidence matts2 is a nark . 
  i have presented the evidence to my buddy bubba one day at the bar . 
  therefore it 's proven matts2 is a nark . 
   think you will be able to take on the army with your revolution ? 
  dunno , ask afghanis ... 
  those pesky jews in warsaw ghetto ... 
   other than `` we are not in charge '' what is the grievance ? 
  i do n't give a fuck who is in charge , all i want is for them to get their noses out of my affairs and their paws out of my wallet ... 
  i do n't give a fuck either way ... just your `` evidence has been presented '' is a lie ... but that 's about everything that you write , is n't it . 
   you are not those `` three percenters '', 
  never said i were ... 
   so you are willing to destroy the economy and culture to get what you want . 
  you 've been doing that for the last century , or so ... as mike vanderbough likes to say : `` you 've got us surrounded , you poor bastards ... '', 
  the 3 % in the revolution were what you would call `` the fake soldiers '' before the shtf too ... 
  you should really try to learn some logic 101 ... 
   his birth certificate is available . 
  to whom ? 
  bubba ? 
  i did n't lose the election - never run ... 
   liberals are generous, 
  ... with other people 's money ... 
  so , there 's this kooky business somewhere in toronto but their business model seems to be out of whack with the public ( iow nobody buys there ) . 
  and you want us to donate the money to keep the business alive ... ? 
  hey , does it mean you wo n't mind if i build a settlement in your backyard ... ? 
  what , it hurts feelings of fragile democrats ? 
  do i sense you perceive them as your betters ? 
  you would n't denounce on reddit someone who called you `` baby killer '' or said you lied ... ? 
  to me it 's only fitting - they are on the level of mafia guys ... 
   is life so dear , or peace so sweet , as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery ? 
  unfortunately , today most americans seem to respond `` hell , yes ! '' ... 
  when private corporation fucks up they go under ( unless they have friends in high places ) , when government fucks up they throw more money on the fuck-up ... 
  dunno , perhaps democrats whoring the kid out in support of obamacare had something to do with it ... ? 
  _ king george iii _, 
  assume you have been named `` capo di tutti capi . '', 
  your goal is to get more power . 
  discuss the best way to achieve this objective ... 
  ... thanks to our glorious leader and his predecessor ... 
  darwin in action ... 
  `` but when a long train of abuses and usurpations , pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism , it is their right , it is their duty , to throw off such government '' ... 
  no , no , no ... you do n't understand !, 
  it 's ok when liberals do it because they are on the right side ... < snicker / , 
  ... and yet [ another ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minor_sabotage ) time ... 
  pay attention to : `` breaking windows in shops that displayed german symbols ( for example , those of photographers who displayed photographs of german soldiers , and of shops that displayed signs in german ) '', 
  one man 's terrorist is another 's freedom fighter ... you try to shove your fascist crap down our throats , do n't be surprised we are striking back . 
  it 's not people who `` do n't like health care , '' it 's the people who do n't like being forced to pay for il duce 's gift to insurance companies ... 
  sure , he 's getting back what was stolen from him ... 
  there 's nothing wrong with showing the fascists people can fight back ... 
   if you have insurance then the mandate means nothing for you, 
  if you were n't a jew the nuremberg laws meant nothing for you ... 
  that 's what you do ? 
  even when the `` difference '' means the bully taking your kids ' lunch ? 
  you talking about your submission , are n't you ... 
   it 's no different than owning a car, 
  it is . 
  i can chose to not to buy a car ... or move to new hampshire . 
   you are n't being told what insurance you have to buy or who to buy it from . 
  no , i 'm just told i have to pay up to one of the il duce 's buddies ... any one will do . 
  btw it really cracks me up `` progressives '' are so in favor of gifts to the big bad corporations when their il duce does it ... 
  if the same `` reform '' was passed by bush they would scream bloody murder . 
  you poor sucker , you should know the benefits of socialism go only to the party apparatchiks . . 
   nitroglycerin is used in the manufacture of explosives , specifically dynamite . 
  nitroglycerin ** is ** an explosive , you make a dynamite out of it to make it ** less ** explosive ... 
  sharing ** your ** own biases is not informing ... 
   if it were all driven by kickbacks as you assume it is then we would have had reform in the 8 years that republicans controlled everything . 
  so , maybe repugnicans are not as corrupt as democraps ... 
   who are the fascists in this example ? 
  the republicans or democrats ? 
  both . 
  do n't believe me ? 
  [ read this ] ( http://www.hitler.org/writings/programme/ ) and ( disregarding the anti-semitic crap and versailles treaty grievances ) tell me which points would be opposed by both parties today ? 
  ( obviously substituting america ( n ) for german ( y ) ), 
  i was n't whining for the share of the `` capitalist loot '' ... 
  because the damn thing is always full ... 
  gold , guns and ammo ... 
  oh , they were there . 
  the media did n't report it , though . 
  right wing media for obvious reason , left wing media did n't want to show not all right wingers are neocons - it 's harder to demonize them that way ... 
   why do some feel entitled, 
  perhaps because they had money extorted from them , ostensibly for exactly that purpose ... ? 
  when they enlisted it was a part of the contract , was n't it . 
  nope , they are calling for their own version of [ small sabotage ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minor_sabotage ) ... kristallnacht was perpetrated by the government/ruling party thugs on the unpopular minority ... 
   nazism was progressive in the same way that pedobear is a good father . 
  apparently , you ( as most `` progressives '' ) have no clue ... 
  here , [ nsdap platform ] ( http://www.hitler.org/writings/programme/ ) you can read for yourself ... 
  we demand that the state shall make it its primary duty to provide a livelihood for its citizens . 
  it must be the first duty of every citizen to perform physical or mental work . 
  the activities of the individual must not clash with the general interest , but must proceed within the framework of the community and be for the general good . 
  [ _ we demand _ ] the abolition of incomes unearned by work .
