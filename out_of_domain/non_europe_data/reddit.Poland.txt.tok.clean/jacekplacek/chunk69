  we demand a land reform suitable to our national requirements , the passing of a law for the expropriation of land for communal purposes without compensation ; the abolition of ground rent , and the prohibition of all speculation in land . 
  the state must consider a thorough reconstruction of our national system of education ( with the aim of opening up to every able and hard-working german the possibility of higher education and of thus obtaining advancement ) . 
  the curricula of all educational establishments must be brought into line with the requirements of practical life . 
  the aim of the school must be to give the pupil , beginning with the first sign of intelligence , a grasp of the nation of the state ( through the study of civic affairs ) . 
  we demand the education of gifted children of poor parents , whatever their class or occupation , at the expense of the state . 
  the state must ensure that the nation 's health standards are raised by protecting mothers and infants , by prohibiting child labor , by promoting physical strength through legislation providing for compulsory gymnastics and sports , and by the extensive support of clubs engaged in the physical training of youth . 
  to put the whole of this programme into effect , we demand the creation of a strong central state power for the reich ; the unconditional authority of the political central parliament over the entire reich and its organizations ; and the formation of corporations based on estate and occupation for the purpose of carrying out the general legislation passed by the reich in the various german states .

  10 point guide for committed progressives to fight imperialistic capitalists oppressing the working classes all over the world . 
  ( 1 ) if you live in a house , condominium or apartment , move . 
  into the street , if necessary . 
  but not to a shelter . 
  all shelters receive some charity ( which is a capitalist tool of oppression ) one way or another-either getting money directly from capitalists or ( even more perfidious ) using proletariat donations . 
  ( 2 ) do n't ever buy anything in any retail store . 
  they are all owned by greedy capitalist swine and are a tool of oppression of the proletariat which is exploited there , either working for a slave-wage or buying the stuff at exorbitant prices that go directly to capitalist swine wallets . 
  ( 3 ) if you 're need medication just say no !, 
  all the exorbitant profits go directly to big pharma fat cats greedy capitalist swine . 
  self-medicate , but only with self-grown weed , or one grown in kalifornia . 
  ( 4 ) if you ever get sick do n't go to the doctor . 
  those bastards do everything for dirty profit and in the process enrich all kind of capitalist swine . 
  ( 5 ) you can keep your kids in school though . 
  they will get better indoctrination than you can ever give them yourself . 
  but if you are really purist , beware they still get stuff made by capitalist swine . 
  ( 6 ) stay off the streets . 
  all streets , roads and highways in america are capitalist . 
  some greedy , proletariat oppressing capitalist swine got the government contract to build/maintain them . 
  besides , you ca n't buy gas without stuffing the wallets of greedy oil barons . 
  ( 7 ) stay off the sidewalks . 
  they 're just as capitalist as the streets , if not moreso . 
  ( 8 ) stop using municipal water . 
  municipal water is capitalist ( they send you a bill every month , do n't they ? ), 
  use only water nobody makes profit from . 
  ( 9 ) tell the fire department to screw off . 
  notify your local fire department that if your house catches on fire , you do not want them to come . 
  all their equipment and uniforms were made by blood sucking , greedy capitalists . 
  some of them are even privately funded by greedy capitalist swine !, 
  ( 10 ) tell the police to screw off , too !, 
  notify your local police department that you do n't need their help if anyone steals your stuff , or tries to kill you or anything like that . 
  as above . 
  i could tell you but then i would have to kill you ... , 
  well , you can not assume in a d'hondt elections the people would vote the same way .
