  there 's a lot of people not wanting to `` waste '' a vote now , perhaps some ( a lot ? ), 
  of them would vote differently ... 
  let 's make this fair . 
  all parties should propose a budget and people should be taxed according to the budget of the party they voted for . 
  non voters should be taxed according to weighted average of all parties budgets . 
  agree . 
  they sure are moronic bigots ... despite being smart asses . 
  you love paying taxes ? 
  ok , you can pay mine ... 
  afghans would tend to disagree ... 
  pics or it did n't happen ... 
  [ accellerated c++ ] ( http://www.programmingforums.org/thread10848.html ), 
  no , no ... 
  i was talking about your drug addled brain ... , 
  why ? 
  you think do gooders do n't mean it if ** they ** would have to pay the piper ? 
  hmm ... have any examples of economy crashing because of lowering taxes ? 
  we must have came from different universes ... 
  right ? 
  or perhaps , libertarian candidate or some other third party candidates would get more votes throwing the election to al gore ... who really knows ? 
  you should know already : all animals are equal but some are more equal ... 
  is n't that juries ' decision ? 
   the ** government ** should be never allowed to make a decision whether or not an individual lives or dies [ _ emphasis mine _ ], 
  you would be wrong ... , 
  well , for someone who wants to avoid . net ( and is not masochistic enough to go with mfc ) this is not really an option ... 
  does it integrate with vs 2010 ? 
  if you eat a double bacon cheeseburger and have a coronary taxpayers bear the burden . 
  is it a reason to pass a law fining you if you have one ? 
  and still have rad ? 
  is it so ? 
  let 's see if i get bunch of buddies and decided to kidnap you for ransom , you would be initiating violence by resisting ? 
  what ? 
  no downmods ? 
  i should clarify then : by `` they '' i mean the `` opponents of the tea party movement '' ... seems the retards can not parse english sentence in context ... 
  it still does . 
  just costs much more ... 
  indeed ... 
  i bet when i bring up geronimo in a story about us you will accuse me of changing the subject ... 
  oh , so you finally can see how wrong you were ... ? 
  did n't think so ... 
  hmm ... seems like most people got it , only poor matts2 can not ... 
  no , you are simply not very intelligent ... nothing wrong with that , as long as you are aware of it . 
  who is sulu ? 
  well , does n't surprise me at all ... `` the government which can give you anything you want can also take everything you 've got . '', 
  that 's something all the progressives tend to forget ... they push to give the government all the power and then act surprised when it 's being abused . 
  go for it !, 
  well , we will see ... the options are not really that great , people threw the republican bums out to end up with democrat bums . 
  no matter the outcome the bums are in power ... 
  what ? 
  obama 's government would kill liberal protesters if they were packing ? 
  what exactly are you saying ? 
  nope . 
  as usual , the leftist retards can not imagine anything not fitting the `` liberal < -  conservative '' spectrum ... 
  if your attention span exceeded the time that takes you to read 7 words , you 'd have noticed i never said `` liberal government '' ... 
  because i 'm trying to explain the government is not your friend ? 
  would it be more compassionate to try to convince you it 's made up of angels and is always having people 's best interest in mind ? 
  it 's more like ** you ** do n't . 
  politics always work the same , american exceptionalism is a myth ... 
  i bet it 's porn ... , 
  i know , i know ... the only thing that could make me popular would be singing kum-ba-ya and explaining benevolence of tooth-fairies and santa claus ... but you know what , i 'll stick to being rational ... 
   that is a bold face lie . 
  the correct phrase is `` a bald faced lie '' ... 
   politics work very differently based on the established system in place . 
  you are saying your shaman is very different from the shaman of the tribe across the lake , because his incantations are different and he has different feathers in his headgear . 
   the `` government '' is more than a single faced beast . 
  you can not generalize an entire system by one city ( or even state 's ) incident . 
  the details of the government structure are of no significance - the only thing that matters is that all governments are just a bunch of parasites with napoleonic complex ... but keep believing in santa claus , dear virginia ... 
   that kind of superiority complex is pretty typical of libertarians, 
  did it ever occur to you that it might not be a `` superiority complex '' but that we simply got it ... ? 
   you do n't have to compromise your principles or ideas to get them across to people , but it helps if you use this thing called `` tact '' . 
  perhaps i 'm boorish by nature , but i do n't really see how my ( original ) post was n't tactful ... ( well , i can see how it could be offensive to the parasites themselves . ), 
   i said `` you can not generalize '' and your response was to say `` details are of no significance - the only thing that matters ... '' aka , exactly what generalizing means . 
  you offered no rebuttal , and instead you only proved my point . 
  it is a shame you do such injustice to libertarianism , as it could use more support . 
  you only alienate everyone who disagrees . 
  lol ... really , to the rape victim it is soo important to distinguish between the rapist that first rape her anally and then vaginally and only then beats her up , from the rapist who first beats her up , then rapes her vaginally and finishes with anal ... what kind of rebuttal do you want ? 
  to what ? 
  cultural diversity of psychopaths ? 
  ok , on the remote chance that you are actually interested in an argument , yes i do `` generalize '' all governments on the same principle you might `` generalize '' all muggers . 
  it is of the very minor importance what kind of weapon is the mugger using to mug you , it 's insignificant of what racial , cultural or ethnic background he might be . 
  his sexual orientation does not play any role either . 
  the ** only ** important thing is that he is using a threat of force to get hold on some of your possessions . 
  same with the government . 
  it is of a secondary importance if it is a democratically elected one ( the nazis were ) or the exact way it is structured . 
  the very essence of the government is force . 
  and the people who invariably end up heading a government are the very people who are drawn to power , and are skilled enough in the art of practical politics to get to the top . 
  to get there , they will have to trample over their opponents , back-stab their former allies , lie to the electorate ( if it is a `` democratic '' government ) or the supporters , etc. 
  iow the most likely winners are the ruthless , psychopathic assholes . 
  then , once in power , they will have to pay back favors , bribe the electorate and secure more support from the special interests ... 
  notice , this does not depend on the particular form of the government ... 
  how in the world can anyone believe the institution like that can be beneficial to the rest of the society ? 
  i have to give the grudging credit to the neocons - at least they ** want ** the government to be oppressive , they only tend to whine if it costs too much and not always then . 
  if enough brown people get bombed they will overlook the cost ... 
  ok , i guess einstein had a `` superiority complex '' when he wrote e = mc \u00b2 too ... , 
  how come , anything left wingnuts do n't like , has to be the effect of a small dick ? 
  ( guns , trucks , private planes except for algor , etc ), 
  because right wingnuts do n't like commies , socialists or fascists ... ? 
   i will disagree when you label all those attempting to become leaders as `` psychopathic '' because i fear you are not using psychopathy as what it actually is . 
  actually , i do . 
  psychopaths are really the most likely winners of the political contests .
