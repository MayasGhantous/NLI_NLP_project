  it would be very strange if they were not the majority of successful politicians . 
   many leaders do try and operate to the best of their abilities to further society 's progress, 
  ... or so they pretend . 
  again , it would be against the odds if that was the case . 
   it is worth sacrificing individual liberties to guarantee overall security, 
  that 's , actually , much more scary than the neocons ... 
  you can not `` guarantee overall security . '', 
  notice that even in prisons , with constant surveillance and no individual liberty , there 's no security . 
  but even if it were possible why do you suppose the government would do it ? 
  you seem to believe that what the stated goals of government are , actually translates to what the sum of the individual interests of the members of the government happens to be . 
  that 's absurd . 
  why would it be so ? 
  i do n't know , ask them ... but , on the face of it , perhaps when they do n't like something it 's because to them it appears to be fascist , socialist or communist . 
  do guns , trucks and private jets really look like penises to left wingnuts ? 
  depends what you plan to do with it ... not really the speed demon and the screen real estate sucks . 
  otoh it 's much more portable than the regular laptop ... 
   ideological remnants of the kkk , and the extreme right wing, 
  dude , you keep telling yourself that and you are starting to believe it ... face it , most americans are not urban liberals , you shove your ideology down their throats and they get pissed ... 
  and that surprises you ? 
  oh , so by mocking jon stewart he is racist ? 
   barack obama is the elected president of the us, 
   which means he won the majority . 
  do you believe it gives him the right to do what he wants ? 
  would it be ok for him to ... let 's say , incinerate 80 % of pentacostals ? 
  but it does n't really matter what you ( or i for that matter ) think . 
  if they are pissed enough to start shooting are you willing to kill or die for your president ? 
   suffer from ... violent social behavior, 
  that 's just one phrase from one definition . 
  what about [ a personality disorder characterized by an abnormal lack of empathy combined with strongly amoral conduct , masked by an ability to appear outwardly normal . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/psychopathy ), 
   and once again , that they pretend is your personal opinion [ ... ] many go into politics with the attitude that they will help change the world, 
  that , of course , being your personal opinion ... , 
   lastly , the individual interests in no way equal the goal of the government, 
  uhmm ... is n't that what i just said ? 
  oh , i see , you misunderstood ... 
  i mean there 's no such thing as `` what government does . '', 
  it 's only what `` the people that form the government do . '', 
  and they have their own goals/interests , very often competing with the goals/interests of the other members . 
  what they arrive at is a hodge-podge of compromises of their ** individual ** interests or ( secondarily ) interests of the lobbyists/special interest groups they are beholden to . 
  yes , it can sometimes result in a token `` pork '' for their district ... but it has absolutely no relation whatsoever to the interest of the society . 
   individual 's rarely know what is good for them, 
  another scary notion ... 
   the government 's job is to work against the natural ego of the individual to better society as a whole . 
  that brings the whole ugly head of collectivism . 
  is `` society as a whole '' more important than the individuals ? 
  if so , 1 ) who decides what 's `` good for society as a whole ? '', 
  2 ) are there any restrictions how far the `` decider '' can go to `` better society as a whole ? '', 
  is exterminating `` enemies of the people '' ok ? 
  look at history - it 's chock-full of the `` deciders '' who exterminated millions of the people `` for the betterment of the society/nation/race / class '' ... 
  there are precious few extragovernmental mass murderers , the best of them can only brag of perhaps hundreds killed ... 
  i 'm not a gamer so i do n't know about games , all the other stuff should be ok , although higher def movies could be a little bit jumpy at times . 
  durability should n't be more of a concern than a regular laptop . 
  well , i think you do n't really try to understand what 's bugging these people and why . 
  you still have n't answered the question : `` are ** you ** ready to kill and/or die if they refuse to back down ? '', 
  oh , so only trucks look like dicks to you ? 
  ok , take that argument to them ... 
  lol another dimwit with `` liberal < -  conservative '' fixation . 
  [ read a book ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glkl_epnsp8 ), 
  oh , so if push comes to shove , you are willing for other people to do the dirty for you ... somehow that 's exactly what i thought ... 
  lol , that 's an excellent source you cited there , grasshopper . 
  the brave marine who deleted his screed just couple of hours after posting - he could n't handle the heat ... well , you could educate yourself about the other side by , ferinstance , looking at comments [ here ] ( http://sipseystreetirregulars.blogspot.com/2010/03/sergeant-c-usmc-oath-breaker.html ) , although i doubt you will get it ... 
  < shaking head in disbelief /  your post is so full of cluelessness it resembles `` let them eat cake '' remark ... but whatever ... 
  btw , in light of the patriot act your post can be easily seen as inciting terrorism ... see you in gitmo , genius . 
  you sayin ' you smart ... methinks you'all just obsessin ' ` bout other people dicks ... 
  ... or that not all politicians are honest politicians ( the ones that ** stay ** bought ) ... 
   so why did all the goa people vote for mccain ? 
  [ _ citation needed _ ], 
  btw : i 'm goa life member and i ** did not ** vote for mccain ... so , your `` all '' is an obvious lie ... 
   but why do n't people who disagree with hate crime legislation argue as passionately against teiring of murder charges, 
  hmm ... perhaps `` hate crime '' laws being contrary to equal protection clause have something to do with it ... 
  the `` hate crime '' laws create some `` more equal '' categories - if someone kills a black or gay victim because he hates blacks or gays it 's a `` hate crime '' . 
  if someone kills redhead or midget because he hates redheads or midgets , it 's not . 
  [ _ citation needed _ ], 
  absolutely ! ... 
  wait , you mean fat , not patents ... ? 
  well , would n't it be more honest to go to the [ source ] ( http://www.hitler.org/writings/programme/ ) instead of taking the word of the leftist prof. . . ? 
  seems like the modern american left-wing fits the pattern as well as the right , if not slightly better . 
  it does bother me . 
  why ? 
  `` constitutional rights apply to german people , not people who are breaking the law by being jews . '', 
   the soviets were not nazis, 
  so , you prefer to call arizonians commies ... ? 
   when i purchase beer , i 'm asked to show papers . 
  when i drive my car , i 'm required to carry my papers . 
  before i board an airplane in america, 
  iow , you already live under a fascist regime and you embrace it ... 
  so , if you happen to live in a village where everybody screwed their daughters , you would be happy to screw yours ... ? 
   we require this of non-citizens, 
  and how do `` we '' know who is a non-entity ... , ehmm , i mean non-citizen ? 
  ok , so enlighten us , what does `` conspiracy theory '' refer to ? 
  why , pray tell , did you decide to bring jews into it ... ? 
  hmmm ... majority of the okc bombers were americans ... 
  there 's a reason why the us military is pretty much hated all over the world ... what would that reason be ? 
  oh , i know - they hate us for our freedom ... 
   i guess they get paid real well for certain mushrooms ? 
  ... with the extra stress on `` certain '' ... ( like [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/psilocybin_mushrooms ) ferinstance , 
  did he also make trains run on time ... ? 
  that was some incompetent poisoner ... 
  yes , it has . 
  only a dimwit like yourself can not understand they hate you because you go into their land and play imperial storm trooper , asshole .
