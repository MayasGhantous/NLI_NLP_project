  it was a response to your :, 
   if you 're intent on viewing every us foreign policy move in a bad light, 
  you moron . 
  does n't surprise me you can not follow your own train of thought - brainwashing by the military tend to wear the brains out pretty fast ... 
   us foreign policy does not equal military policy, 
  really ? 
  btw it 's my fault , i should have known better than to try to talk to brainwashed squid ... 
  i do n't know . 
  does the navy code of conduct tell you to be offended by it ? 
   the truth is by fixing animals we are greatly reducing the overall suffering of the dog population . 
  hmmm ... should we `` fix '' you too , and greatly reduce the overall suffering of the people population ? 
   at some point in my life i will get a vasectomy, 
  well , it might be news to you but the `` fixing '' of a dog involves a little bit more than vasectomy ... 
  the question i asked was, 
   should we `` fix '' you too, 
  you need to work on your reading comprehension skills . 
  because r/politics dudes have a secret crash on sarah ... 
  < shrug /  guess you are just too dense ... 
  are you really so dumb ? 
  the whole point is not about not breeding , it 's about cutting your balls off ... that not only prevents you from breeding , it also makes you no longer male - read up on testosterone and where it originates from ... 
  lol ... dude , i hope you are getting paid very well for that ... 
  actually , he got caught doing what he was sending other people to jail for ... 
  how uninformed am i ? 
  are you saying he used to dismiss all prostitution cases ? 
   gaza was given to the palestinians by the un, 
  how generous of them ... 
   it was then invaded by egypt, 
  obviously , if it was invaded by egypt , israel has a god given right to do with it as they please ... 
  say , ukrainians and belorussians never had a country before , i guess it would be ok if the un gave half of each to dukhobors , ferinstance ... or maybe to jews too - they deserve more land , do n't they . 
  b. . . b. . . but they have the right to defend themselves ... < / sarcasm , 
  well , a monk ( esp . 
  a mellow one ) could look ridiculous with a pistol strapped to his robe ... , 
  hmm ... `` leave me the fuck alone '' anarchist ? 
  guess so . 
  please . 
  he should be able to communicate with any old catholic priest too ... 
   police were in contact with people on the bus , but it was unclear why they remained on board for more than two hours before they started to leave . 
  they left the bus one by one -- separated by a couple of minutes each -- and carried no purses or bags . 
  most held their hands aloft as they passed officers with their weapons drawn . 
   the passengers were screened individually when they got off the bus -- much like an airport security check -- and were to be taken to the portsmouth police station . 
   those who think states are more respectful of personal liberties than the federal government, 
  and who `` those '' might be ? 
  most `` states rights '' libertarians do n't delude themselves like that . 
  the point being if the state passes oppressive legislation it affects only this one state . 
  people who find it intolerable , might fairly easily move to the more free state . 
  in case of federal government , the patriot act , ferinstance , can not be easily escaped ... 
  tl ; dr : it 's better to have small gang in the hood than the huge , city-wide one ... 
  why ? 
  well , most of the regulars know each other leanings anyway ... 
  hmm ... so why is it that the democrats are so enamored with `` federal money . '', 
  maybe you guys should stop shoving the money down their throats ... ? 
  i hope he gets some juicy media deals - his career as an escort is over ... ( snitching on the john is a major no-no for an escort ), 
  go for it !, 
  and btw : take philly with you ... pennsylvania would be tolerable without it . 
  hehehe ... reddit slashdotted itself ... , 
  it is kinda funny how the improved testing leads to various scares of the `` poisons '' found in more and more things ... 
  we forgot what [ paracelsus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paracelsus#contributions_to_toxicology ) used to teach back in 16th century ... 
   the calculations are extremely complex and carefully thought out, 
  ... to yield the results desired by the authors ... 
  i 'm willing to put up $ 1000.00 if you can let go of your balloon in the northern hemisphere and for it to end up in the southern one . 
  ( it has to be reasonably far from the equator - let 's say 1 \u00b0 ), 
  winds do n't cross the equator . 
  the reason left as the mental exercise for those few environmentalist scaremongers who have some brain cells left ... 
  to notice the resemblance , you have to really , really , really wish to see it ... 
   bullshit anti-authoritarian legislation, 
  somehow , i suspect you did n't mean what you said ... , 
  are you being intentionally disingenuous ... ? 
  there 's still no explanation how did the cfcs cross the equator . 
   if you are referring to the large hole over the antarctic, 
  are you trying to evade the point ? 
  i 'm asking how the cfcs , released mostly in the northern hemisphere , ended up damaging the ozone layer in the southern one ? 
   you are not more intelligent than the scientists who have studied this, 
  never said i was . 
  it 's irrelevant - though i assume they are intelligent enough to know which `` results '' will put the butter on their bread ... 
   your magic equator, 
  oh , so now equator is a conspiracy theory too ... 
  proof of what ? 
  your iq being less than room temperature - that 's pretty self evident ... 
  `` you keep using this word . 
  i do n't think it means what you think it means . '', 
   you give me an article about some guy who got hit by a car, 
  sorry , copypasta fail ... it was supposed to be quote from you ... 
   you `` refute '' claims with no evidence , no studies and thus no proof, 
  < sigh /  i refute claims with knowledge that should be common for average educated mid school jock . 
  or even uneducated one with some brains . 
  you want links ? 
  [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atmospheric_circulation ) as you can see , it 's not fucking likely much of the cfcs from the northern hemisphere could ever make it to the southern one . 
  if you look at the [ `` stratospheric circulation '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stratosphere#circulation_and_mixing ) on wikipedia it 's flagged right there with the `` no fucking citations '' warning - iow most likely made up by desperate environuts . 
  even if you believe it ( stratospheric circulation ) happens to the relevant degree , it still would not explain the observations . 
  for your little `` theory '' to work , the cfcs would have to go up to the stratosphere in the north ** without causing ozone depletion ** , then move south due to `` stratospheric circulation '' magic , then get back down to the troposphere to let your little `` theory '' to move it over antarctica , and only then move up to the stratosphere again to cause the ozone to vanish . 
  would you be interested in some beachfront property in sierra nevada ? 
  quite the contrary , it would be very refreshing to hear one . 
  `` baaa ... sicientists say so , baaaa ... '' is not a logical argument . 
  and , contrary to the popular reddit belief neither is `` you are an idiot '' ... 
  what beautiful straw-men they have built and how nicely they 've kicked them down ... 
  the main gist of the case is in my response [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/c11tf/whatever_happened_to_the_hole_in_the_ozone_layer/c0pkh1q ) which , for obvious reasons , did n't get any responses ( other than downvoting ) ... want to take a shot at solving this riddle ? 
  or are you content with kicking your artsy straw-men ? 
  quite frankly , i do n't know what to make of your response ... 
   wondered how it related to the ozone hole, 
  do you really need everything to be spelled out ?
