  point 1 ) most of the cfcs are/were being released in the northern hemisphere . 
  point 2 ) in the troposphere ( that where my first link is relevant ) there 's practically no exchange of the air over the equator . 
  point 3 ) there 's a `` proposal '' by the environuts that the migration of the cfcs to the southern hemisphere can occur due to `` stratospheric circulation '' , but there 's no citations for it to even occur . 
  point 3a ) even if such thing was happening , it should be pretty obvious ( except for the `` true believers '' ) that the amounts of cfcs making it over to the southern hemisphere have to be much smaller than the original amount in the northern hemisphere . 
  point 4 ) if the cfc 's made it to the southern hemisphere through stratospheric circulation , they would be kinda evenly dispersed over the stratosphere there . 
  so for them to use the mechanism posited to concentrate over the antarctica , they would have to get back to the troposphere , follow your `` magic '' and then get back again into the stratosphere . 
  diluting more and more in the process . 
  in the same time , the much more concentrated cfcs in the northern hemisphere , miraculously , did n't deplete the ozone there . 
  seems to me ozoneholers have some explaining to do ... 
  that 's what i could find in your link about how it crosses from north to south :, 
   vertical transport into and within the stratosphere is slow . 
  takes more than 5 years for a cfc molecule released at sea level to, 
  rise high enough in the stratosphere to be photolyzed . 
  transport , in both troposphere and stratosphere , is faster - there is, 
  a bottleneck in the tropics ( it can take a year or two to get across, 
  the equator ) but there is still plenty of time . 
  cfc 's are distributed, 
  almost uniformly as a function of latitude , with a gradient of ~ 10 %, 
  from northern to southern hemispheres . 
  you call this `` explanation '' ? 
  sorry , pal , if that 's what you consider `` explanation '' i would really like to explain to you how beachfront property in llanos estacados is an excellent investment ... 
   do n't `` dilute '' easily because of the weird vortex that goes on down in south, 
  uhmm ... and what prevents them from diluting before they reach the vortex ? 
   due to our tilt , rotation and temprature, 
  you should really add a few more buzzwords ... coriolis force ? 
  planck 's constant ? 
  shroedinger 's cat ? 
  tooth fairy ? ... 
   you are not qualified to answer the question . 
  you have absolutely no bloody idea what questions i am qualified to answer . 
   you have n't responded to any of the explanations put forward, 
  what explanations ? 
  all i see are epicycles upon the epicycles . 
  pedo apologizer : anyone who does not call for immediate execution of anybody accused of pedophilia . 
  they do n't `` dilute '' because `` when such ozone-depleting chemicals reach the stratosphere , they are dissociated by ultraviolet light to release chlorine atoms . 
  so , they only dissociate in the south ? 
  or chlorine atoms ( ions really , hint hint ) do n't follow the laws of thermodynamics ? 
   the chlorine atoms act as a catalyst , and each can break down tens of thousands of ozone molecules before being removed from the stratosphere . 
  given the longevity of cfc molecules , recovery times are measured in decades . 
  it is calculated that a cfc molecule takes an average of 15 years to go from the ground level up to the upper atmosphere , and it can stay there for about a century , destroying up to one hundred thousand ozone molecules during that time '' so they dont get high enough until they get waaayyy down south . 
  they do n't cause `` ozone holes '' in the north because they can not get up high enough in the north . 
  they can get high enough in the south because of the `` vortices and shit '' ... 
  something tells me you do n't really have a fucking idea what you are talking about ... 
  i think you are confusing two different issues . 
  in theory you could have a freedom of expression under a police state and _ vice versa _ you could have no freedom of expression without being a police state . 
  so , is uk a police state ?

  can a policeman demand your id without the cause ? 
  check . 
  can he enter your home without the warrant ? 
  check , as the story illustrates . 
  can the police shoot you if they feel like it ? 
  ask one jean charles de menezes ... 
  can the police spy on you , wiretap you , read your mail/email ? 
  i do n't know the answer to this question ... 
  overall i 'd lean towards `` yes '' . 
  ok , so they shoot you only if they really , really , ** really ** feel like it ...

  gorgewall 's grandpa on prohibition and al capone :, 
   their economies would also collapse ( at least partially ) if there were n't so many upper-middle class college yuppies with too much disposable income buying obscene amounts of booze for recreational use . 
  i think it 's rather disingenuous to place the majority of the onus of the moonshine trade 's evils on prohibition and insist that it all be legalized when everyone sitting at home right now could just choose to not partake . 
  it seems like people 's nobility extends only until they are inconvenienced .

  you need to get to item # 87 to get bacon ... the author is definitely not a redditor . 
  well , obviously there can not be a moral equivalency between busybodies who want to force people into all kind of , government jackbooted thugs backed , `` for the childrun , '' schemes vs the folks who just want to be left alone ... 
  sure , there are those too - and they are assholes ... but the tea party was started , mostly , by the folks who are sick and tired of the busybodies on both sides ... unfortunately there seem to be lot of hanger-ons attaching themselves to the movement , though .

  funny how it works : if matts2 does n't like the law it 's '' < derogatory adjective /  society that created it , '' when matts2 does like the law it 's the wise , benevolent , government that passed it to restrain < derogatory adjective /  individuals in the society ... 
  so , why do you believe the states are the only entities that can pass the < derogatory adjective /  laws ? 
  were n't the `` fugitive slave '' laws federal ? 
   nothing i wrote suggested that , why do you bring up a strawman ? 
  everything you write suggests exactly that . 
  your position , generally , is that the states can not be trusted with the laws they pass yet , somehow , you do n't think the same of the federal government . 
  when libertarians argue for states ' rights it 's not because they trust states , it 's because they believe the alternative of federal encroachment is much more dangerous because of the scope . 
  iow , when the state passes abusive legislation it affects only this state residents and it leaves them the option of moving , your beloved federal government does not . 
  and i thought he gets paid according to his audience numbers ...
