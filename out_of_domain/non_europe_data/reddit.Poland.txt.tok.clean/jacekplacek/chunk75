  iow market forces ... 
   libertarians are smarter than scientists, 
  those agw scientists who believe in what they preach ? 
  i would n't be surprised ... most of the smart ones are just getting `` results '' which will butter their bread ... 
  nope . 
  she did sue for damages from polluting the environment , though . 
  does n't surprise me you can not see the relevance ... 
   even if climate change was not real , climate physics would still get funding, 
  you seem to have a very naive view of how the grants work ... yes , one or two would get grants vs thousands who do now . 
   factcheck.org articles going into detail on the background behind the emails backed up with specific goal to whitewash it ... 
  ftfy, 
   one way or another we will have a low carbon economy at some point in the not too distant future - whether it is because we voluntarily lower our carbon usage or because we have simply run out of fossil fuels . 
  which still does n't justify politicians fleecing us using it as a scare tactic ... 
  i dunno , you seem to believe all these bad things about scientists who are funded by private grants ... 
  again , just because ** you ** can not figure it out does n't make it impossible ... 
  let 's start with ** causation ** and ** injury ** :, 
  if you could prove ( or convince the jury ) that the co \u2082 is causing all the bad things agw fundamentalists believe , you would n't have a problem showing injury . 
  having that you could sue the car manufacturers , power plants and any other co \u2082 emitters who do have ** duty ** not to emit harmful thingies , showing they are in ** breach ** by emitting it . 
  pretty simple , eh ... 
  well , can not be sure about you , personally . 
  the other agw jihadists , generally , certainly do ... 
   unless the grant is from a suspicious organization who obviously has an interest in global warming hysteria ( like government ), 
  ftfy, 
   saying something so ridiculous as `` agw deniers '' utterly destroys your credibility on any issue like this ever . 
  ftfy, 
   so how are you going to show causation against any one company ? 
  sue them [ all . 
  ] ( http://www.products-liability-insurance.com/blog/index.php/2009/04/21/why-naming-multiple-defendants-in-a-lawsuit-is-common-practice/ ), 
  i hope you are not a litigation lawyer because you are woefully ignorant in that field ... 
   it lets your enemy know what weapon you have , as well as where you are . 
  you are assuming the burglar is a fricking navy seal or some other pro ... most of the times he is a dumb fuck and yes , the sound of the pumping the shotgun might as well convince him to piss his pants and run . 
   it seems irresponsible firearms use . 
  having a firearm you do n't intend to use . 
  and, 
   it elevates the conflict to firearm level, 
  it 's a chance you will scare him and not have to shoot him ... and when invaded in my home i will not hesitate to `` elevate '' ... 
   it 's going to be pretty fucking easy for duke energy to prove that its emissions did not cause agw . 
  same for gm . 
  same for pg&e . 
  < sigh /  you do n't have to be ** cause ** to be a source ... and they would have a pretty hard time proving they did not contribute ... 
  look at the tobacco suits - plaintiffs did not need to show that any particular brand caused their cancer . 
  if you were right the phillip morris could argue the cancer would develop even if plaintiff never smoked marllboroughs ... 
   if i smoked marlboros for 40 years and occasionally smoked camels , i may not be able to prove that smoking marlboros caused my cancer but i can show that there is a substantial likelihood that they did . 
  are you saying that if you smoked whatever was at hand for 40 years you would n't have a chance ... ? 
  you could easily argue that you smoked 20 % of marlboros , 15 % of camels , 10 % of lucky strikes , etc and whatever damages you were awarded would be proportionally split between them . 
   conversely , there is zero chance that duke energy 's emissions caused agw . 
  the likelihood that any one company caused agw is zero . 
  in each and every case there 's a certain percentage of liability , if you can prove the damages . 
  there 's nothing preventing the jury to award such percentage of damages from each contributor . 
  you do n't have to be a ** sole ** contributor to be liable . 
   that 's why i said earlier that you can maybe recover something like 0.0001 % from duke energy . 
  that 's why you sue them all . 
  all those fractions of percentages will add up to pretty substantial amount . 
   why not just tax them $ 100,000 and be done with it ? 
  because the tax does n't go to the victims . 
  like the tax on cigarettes - it does nothing for the cancer victims . 
  the only group that benefits from taxes is politicians . 
  besides , taxing does n't require proving the agw ... 
  it 's not underestimating . 
  either he is armed and willing to use it ( in that case he most likely will anyways ) or he is not and will split . 
  even in the first case , you 're giving him a chance to reconsider . 
  you seem to have pretty short attention span : one lawsuit , multiple defendants ... 
   why not have a tax that does go the victims ? 
  we can have a streamlined process for evaluating claims , much like a court uses to determine the amount of damages . 
  courts just use an adjuster , so the government can do the same . 
  overall it would be much more streamlined . 
  ok , do you have ** one ** example when tax passed for a specific purpose was n't misused ? 
  just one ... 
  get back in time about a century , replace `` oil '' with `` coal '' , tweak the numbers , replace china/india with russia , replace plastics with ebonite/rubber and computer chips with vacuum tubes . 
  voila , you get what could be a rant of questionedwisdom 's grandpa . 
  you 're missing the point : the economy back then was running on coal and it would be a disaster if it hit the `` peak coal '' ... fortunately , ( what all the alarmists seem to be unable to comprehend ) market does n't work that way . 
   but we have no `` oil '' to replace grandpa 's `` coal '', 
  but we have some other thingies , like nuke reactors or some other thingies we may come up with ... gasoline can be synthesized , it just require too much energy to be economically viable at this point ... 
  if `` peak oilers '' are right the oil price will grow up and we will find a way to switch to alternatives as starts to make economical sense ... stuff like that does n't happen overnight ... 
   enormous problems from oil supply disparities have already happened . 
  i must have slept through the armageddon ... 
   even with a strong economy , revolutionizing an infrastructure that has had such enormous momentum over the past century is a far cry . 
  let 's see , you and your fellow `` peak oilers '' can not imagine it happening so it will not happen ... so , how did the coal infrastructure managed to switch ? 
  i would love to have a case that looks like ass ... , 
  i thought `` looking for trouble '' meant creating it ... 
  actually that 's not wtf ... the speed limits are often just set up to generate revenue and have nothing to do with what the safe speed would be ... ( not to mention `` safe '' speed depends on who is driving , what car and what the conditions are . ), 
   but what i took exception to was the statement that `` if the cops are n't around , then more than likely you 're safe '' . 
  which is simply inverting the principle , and it creates a false statement . 
  good point . 
  < shrug /  you seem to have an extraordinary faith in politicians ' fairness and competence ... 
   how many of these milestones were n't funded either by government agencies or state sponsored universities ? 
  yup . 
  and in soviet union government used to bake bread . 
  which , obviously , proves without government all russians would starve . 
   he is still a perfectly valid role model for american youth . 
  sure , and [ iosif vissarionovich dzhugashvili ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joseph_stalin ) was a perfectly valid role model for soviet youth . 
  very few people kill themselves with ** two ** shots to the head ... most of them seem to be journalists who stepped on the ptb 's toes ... like hunter , or gary webb . 
  did he say he would shoot himself in the face many , many times ... ? 
   also , if you were a spook and looking to setup a suicide , would you shoot twice ? 
  even if the first was a bad shot , you 'd subdue him until he bled out . 
  you 'd never frame him with a multiple shot suicide . 
  yes . 
  if i wanted to send a message to others like him . 
  and where is the evidence the towers collapsed due to [ whatever you seem to believe ] ? 
  oh , shipped out to china , never mind ...
