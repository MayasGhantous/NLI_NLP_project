  what evidence ? 
  how the hell do you shoot yourself ** twice ** in the head ? 
   are you really saying that the president of the us ca n't be a role model ? 
  kids should pick their own role models . 
  when the teacher does the selection for them it stinks pretty much like the cult of personality indoctrination . 
   what did the dog do that necessitated the police to be involved . 
  my guess is the dog did n't do anything , it was just some dumbfuck like lobsterloo who called the cops because he pisses his pants anytime he sees a dog larger than chihuahua ... 
  does it ( the logo ) suggest canada is a police state ? 
  nope . 
  middle ages were n't even half as insane as the world is today ... 
  screw the freedom of speech . 
  bytock knows what we need to hear and , by golly , he 's gon na make sure it 's the only thing we hear ... 
  to ** both ** sides ? 
  so , if one side is a libertarian-anarchist who do you have to give an equal time to ? 
  fascist or collectivist-anarchist ? 
  or are you saying only democrats and republicans should be allowed in the broadcast media ? 
   but the polite thing is to wait until you are invited to address them in a more casual manner, 
  that 's a common custom outside us ... not so in us anymore . 
   but since the study was focused on `` climate scientists that publish research on the subject '', 
  iow , `` climate scientists that get grants '' - since most of the grants ( in agw research ) is from the government , the `` results '' of the `` research '' conform to what politicians want to hear ... those scientists who do not find `` acceptable '' ( to politicians ) results do n't get grants anymore ... 
  why do n't you fucking emigrate to north korea , you would fit there ... 
  there 's no evidence the court that sentenced [ sophie scholl ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sophie_scholl ) to death was bribed either ... 
   what the fuck was that cop thinking ? 
  `` he is defying my authoritah !!! '', 
  it 's funny , fedgov sycophants are a lot less gung-ho about this `` rule of law '' thing when the government breaks it . 
   plus not all of the 23.18 % are software engineers much less talented software engineers . 
  but i 'd venture a guess very high percentage of software engineers are fluent in english ... 
  i suspect you misunderstood the term `` monopolistic competition '' . 
  perhaps you should read the link ? 
  well , there seem to be a correlation , it would be up to you to show causation ... 
   since immigration is ( effectively ) unregulated, 
  may i have some of what you are smoking ? 
  you need a `` shooting license '' in ozzieland to have an air rifle ??? 
   why do you think they never tire of saying barack hussein obama ? 
  perhaps for the same reason people used to say william jefferson clinton , or richard milhous nixon or lyndon baines johnson , or franklin delano roosevelt , or ... 
  and the reason being : it 's his fucking name . 
  why is calling a woman `` cunt '' sexist but calling a man `` dickhead '' not ? 
  perhaps he is accustomed to the internet as it was before `` eternal september '' ... 
   yes , because truth is fascism !, 
  truth as defined by buttes ... ? 
  not to mention , small woman could n't possibly match well trained 200lbs knight , no matter how much she tried . 
  with a pistol she has much better chances ... 
  iraqi citizens ? 
  afghan citizens ? 
  they are all sooo subservient , are n't they ... 
  because , when the government is through with him , he 's got no money left , perhaps ... ? 
  seems like you would n't make a good master , you fail to appreciate the perks that come with being one ... , 
  velkome to soviet republic of kanada , comrades ... 
   the voltage on a car battery is so low that human flesh prevents the electricity from flowing, 
  time for an experiment : wire your balls to the car battery and report the outcome ... better yet , put two of them in series ... 
   that 's cheating, 
  you saying israelis would torture the dude but they would n't stoop so low as to put two batteries in series ... ? 
   _ he said he also wants to save taxpayers from the financial cost of lawsuits if police shoot someone in the house because the officer felt threatened _, 
  i guess , they have n't shot anybody ( in the house ) before - they did n't need to feel threatened ... < snicker / , 
   scalia 's dissent, 
  scalia did n't dissent , he concurred ... 
   should be mandatory nationwide for 7th or 8th grade education, 
  geez , why do people think everything should be either prohibited or mandatory ... can i have a choice in at least ** some ** matters ... ? 
  iow , the handgun ban is not only unconstitutional , it 's also counterproductive ... 
  [ _ citation needed _ ], 
   a gun exists for the sole purpose of killing, 
  holly fuck !, 
  i have four of them and all these years they did n't kill anything/anybody . 
  they must be fucking defective !, 
   you can shoot targets without actual bullets, 
  yup . 
  you can even just point your finger at the target and go `` bang !, 
   and invented by ... by ... 
  i know it !, 
  i know it !, 
   even large amounts of citizens with rifles ca n't stand up to a platoon of soldiers with air support and a tank . 
  sure . 
  that 's why it was a `` cake walk '' in iraq and afghanistan . 
  we had it under control in mere couple of weeks ... oh wait ... 
  how is a hunting rifle worse than the assault rifle ? 
  decent hunting rifle has usually a more powerful round and is more accurate . 
  assault rifle has the only advantage of being able to shoot full auto - not something you really need in a guerrilla warfare ... 
  that 's , kinda , depends on your definition of `` dystopia '' ... according to my definition - none . 
   but i do agree on longer waiting times . 
  i 'd actually like to see a requirement for training and safety training before a handgun can be purchased, 
  should we require wait times before an article can get published ? 
  should potential word processor software buyer be required to get typing/grammar/spelling / creative writing training ? 
  ok , i stipulate armed populace could n't prevent tyrannical government from occupying the country . 
  but it would make ruling that country prohibitively expensive ... was it bismark who said `` you can take the country with bayonets but you can not sit on them '' ... ? 
  btw contrary to popular beliefs , making explosives is not a rocket science , and anybody mechanically inclined can , with simple tools , make a rocket launcher . 
  `` law ? 
  what law ? 
  we do n't need no stinkin ' law ! '', 
   it 's quite simple ... the police ask you to bend over , you bend over . 
  and hope for vaseline . 
  ftfy, 
  you are well trained ... good sheeple . 
   at that point i will have to either add more dates to the database or fix every function that uses the dates . 
  or you can call me and ( for a moderate remuneration ) i will fix this for you without changing code or adding more dates to the table ... , 
  i do n't know , never were into bondage myself ... but whatever your fancy . 
  just do n't project your sexual preferences on the rest of us ... 
  you are right , purehatred is wrong . 
  factcheck.org is not liberal propaganda site , it 's a statist propaganda site ... 
   this is the controlled part of any modern firearm , and is controlled . 
  controlled part is controlled ... ,
