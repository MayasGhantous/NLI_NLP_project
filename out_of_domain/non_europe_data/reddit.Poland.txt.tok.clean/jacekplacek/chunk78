  but i will not be there by then : either will move somewhere else or go on the hunt ( with my unregistered guns ) for those responsible ... 
   they did not ban handguns . 
  they are legal . 
  is that so ? 
  [ all handguns are either prohibited or restricted in canada . 
   the government limited the ability of citizens to carry handguns when they walk around the street because of what happens when you let normal citizens carry handguns every where they go , ie : usa . 
  ok , tell me what happens ? 
  did you ever go to us ? 
  do you realize the most crime in us is in places that prohibit guns ? 
  did n't think so ... 
  but anyways , if government has to `` limit the ability '' ( nice euphemism , btw ) that means there are people who would like to carry - if there were n't there would be no need for a ban . 
   well that is just an immature comment . 
  why ? 
  because it makes you uncomfortable with your worldview ? 
  it does illustrate your position perfectly ... 
  but maybe i 'm wrong . 
  so , tell us would you rather see a girl armed and able to defend herself , or would you prefer her being easy picking for a wannabe bernardo . 
  simple question , it should n't be hard to answer ... 
  doubt it . 
  most firearms homicides are done with handguns , .22 is not the most popular handgun round ... 
  his track record seems to be rather ambiguous ... sometimes pro , sometimes anti . 
   result of the private industry failing to provide what we need, 
  you mean the private industry having government granter monopoly ... ? 
   people just like their cars, 
  are you saying you want to force people into something ** you ** like instead ... ? 
  it 's not how you are supposed to cook bacon ... ?!!, 
   it seems to forgets that we work better as a group than as individuals, 
  lol ... actually it 's statist who forget we work better as a group , but not at the barrel of a gun ... 
  libertarians have nothing against working as a group , they have everything against being ** forced ** to do so ... 
  say , you probably quite enjoy going out with your friends/family for a hike , would n't like it so much if there was an armed guard dictating a pace , would you . 
  were only the elites able to see doctors before ? 
  think carefully before you respond ... 
  since we 've been keeping records , there has to be a `` hottest year on record \u2122 '' it might as well be this one ( but it 's not over yet , so we do n't really know ) ... 
  ** i ** sound hyperbolic ? 
  ** i ** `` turn this into black & white ? '', 
  perhaps you should re-read your own comment ... 
  and , yes , i 'm pretty much aware of the motives of collectivists and do n't really see your point with the reading recommendations ... or do you have a point ? 
   what you stated isnt really true is it ? 
  you mean about the barrel of a gun ? 
  yes it is . 
  definitely . 
  there is no coincidence in the root of `` enforcement '' being `` force '' ... how do you think laws are being enforced ? 
  do you think the nice policeman that comes to your door to enforce the law you are breaking has a gun just for show ? 
  but it 's kinda funny how statists like to characterize libertarians as hermits and loners ... sure , there might be some out there ( i , personally , do n't know any ) but most libertarians are quite social and , in my experience , are much more likely to be helpful than statists ( who mostly tend to direct people in need to some governmental agency ) ... 
  btw , if you can get some nazis/stalinists/any other scum to donate to me i 'll be really grateful ... 
  i happen to need money badly right now and i do n't give a fuck where it comes from ... 
  canada now offers girls ? 
  fuck , i have to go back !, 
  where do i apply for one ? 
  if it was a synagogue , would you object ? 
  catholic church ? 
  baptist church ? 
  what if the date was an anniversary of okc ? 
  would n't go very far on water alone ... 
   `` ok i live in saudi arabia and we do n't allow women to drive there . 
  i never see the public asking for the right of the women to drive there and much less people die from being run over by the woman , '', 
  ftfy, 
  when you sober up , you will realize it 's a satire ( look it up ) ... 
  iow we get to throw the bums out ... again . 
  ( and replace them with brand new/old set of bums . ), 
  yeah , i know , the life is sometimes the best satire ... , 
  well , if that 's what gives them kicks , who am i to object ... kinda darwin in action ... 
  perhaps because it 's a big stretch ... clams look like balls ? 
  ginger looks like stomach ? 
  the only real look-alike is walnut - brain but only if you take half of it ... 
  fell out of a plane ... ? 
  yeah ? 
  so what about [ this ] ( http://image.made-in-china.com/2f0j00avyaskkbkygw/fresh-ginger-root-150g-400g-.jpg ) one ? 
  it does not look like a stomach , does it mean only the first one is good for the stomach and this one is good for ... 
  i do n't know ... moose antlers ? 
  the fuck is your problem ? 
   outer coverings protect critical organs, 
  sounds more like a skull than balls to me ... but i guess for someone with lots of balls and no brain it could be different ... 
  do n't forget [ ted bundy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ted_bundy ) was a republican . 
  omg !, 
  republicans are serial killers !, 
  and sen. byrd was a klansman . 
  omg !, 
  democrats are klansmen !, 
   driving is a useful skill that can improve your life . 
  guns are designed just to kill people . 
  and can sometimes save your ( or your loved ones ) life ... 
   i was also not suggesting the oppression of a group, 
  yes you were . 
  gunowners . 
  no , but you did endorse such oppression in your country ... 
  if by `` fucked up '' you mean `` do n't look anything like clams '' then yes . 
   you are just fucking stupid, 
  actually , i 'm quite smart , thank you very much , you otoh ... 
   world should not be a place where every fucking person should need to carry a weapon, 
  so , in your opinion , if something is not prohibited then `` every fucking person needs to carry it ? '', 
   living in constant fear of being raped , murdered ? 
  if you have a fire extinguisher does it mean you `` live in constant fear of being burned ? '', 
  i noticed you still refuse to answer if you think it 's better for a girl to be raped and murdered than being allowed to carry a gun . 
  why is that ? 
   the have no agenda and want only power for themselves, 
  iow no different than politicians in any other country ... a little bit more transparent , perhaps . 
  perhaps they are doing better jobs ? 
  ok , so you ** would ** object if a catholic church were to open in ok city close to the bombing site on anniversary of bombing ... did n't think so . 
  same context , do n't you agree ...
