  ok , so what is `` planet 's natural '' level of co2 ... ? 
  what 's the `` planet 's natural '' temperature ? 
  if beaver builds a dam and changes the environment is it still `` natural ? '', 
  when human builds the dam it 's not , i guess ... 
  you guys are just freaking religious fanatics , no better than westboro baptists or ayatollahs . 
   that value comes from a combination of supply and demand, 
  that 's the price . 
  there 's no objective `` value '' ... 
   so you can see that the optimal amount of c02 in the atmosphere - in order to have a livable climate for humans - is somewhere around 300 to 350 parts per million , as advocated by the popular environmental site 350 . org . 
  this is what you might say is the `` planet 's natural level of co2 , '' although it has fluctuated greatly in the planet 's history . 
  i would n't rely too heavily on the ** opinion ** of the very partisan 350 . org ... other than late holocene , co2 levels were quite often [ much higher ] ( http://www.geocraft.com/wvfossils/carboniferous_climate.html ) ( as in the order of magnitude higher ) than now . 
  and the temperatures were much higher in mid holocene as well ... 
  btw : we seem to be approaching the end of holocene about right now , that means very likely the next glacial is due ... and that is more likely something that can cause ** real ** concerns . 
  do n't forget , most of the earth history was pretty fucking cold - i 'd rather have oranges growing in upstate ny than have manhattan under half a mile of ice ... 
  contrary to popular beliefs ( or what your government wants you to believe ) the `` terrists '' are after our asses for political reasons , not religious ... and mcveigh was raised catholic - i have no idea what his beliefs were at the time of bombing and it 's mostly irrelevant ... atta was n't exactly a model of devout muslim either, 
  you want to know what is the consensus or what is the [ reality ] ( http://townhall.com/columnists/humbertofontova/2010/01/21/che_guevara_exposed_the_killer_on_the_lefties%e2%80%99_t-shirts/page/full ) ? 
  exactly , we do n't know . 
  the only thing we really know is that it ** will ** change ... 
  once you become a murderous asshole you can not un-become one ... 
  does license imbue doctors with magical powers ? 
   however , this argument completely omits that co2 is not the only driver of climate . 
  that seems to be what agw alarmists tend to overlook ... actually , more than likely , it 's not a very significant one ... and the proposed `` solutions '' do n't do much more than impoverish large chunks of humanity , without any significant effect on the climate . 
  actually , i 'm pretty sure i 'm better at english grammar ( which i started learning at about 20 ) than you at polish grammar ( my native language ) . 
  like what ? 
  anything in particular you find inaccurate ? 
  and sure , fontoya is not unbiased - kinda like the holocaust survivors are not quite unbiased about nazis ... 
  i guess we have to discard all their testimonials ... 
  yes , i am . 
  have a problem with that ? 
  iow , you can not pinpoint ** actual ** `` untruths and historical errors , '' you just do n't like to admit your idol was an asshole ... 
   we 've got the last three paragraphs on his death . 
  false . 
  says who ? 
  those are accounts of those who actually were there ... you have better sources ? 
  or do you take exception to the fidel 's attitude ? 
  again , you do n't provide any facts , just your word that it is `` false '' ( what is false ? 
  every single word ? 
  some ? 
  one ? 
   wait until we start seeing hundreds of millions of climate refugees fleeing rising sea levels over the next century, 
  refugees are people who flee some particular event , sea levels are not going to change in a week - so they will be migrants not refugees ... you keep forgetting that if earth keeps warming , along with rising sea levels , millions of square kilometers of currently uninhabitable land are going to become arable ... this is going more than offset land lost to the sea many times over . 
  countries like canada are going to beg for immigrants ... 
  historically , the warm periods were always a boom for the humanity , do n't see why this would change now . 
  go for it . 
  kinda funny , anytime left ( or establishment in general ) feels threatened , the racism is inevitably attributed to the threatening movement/organization/person ... 
  maybe you should think it over - do you ** really ** think all non-leftists are racist ? 
  name one prominent right wing person/organization that was n't accused of racism . 
  well , [ barry goldwater ] ( http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&amp;address=132x4113768 ), 
  but you are missing the point they were never a threat to the establishment ( with the possible exception of barry ) they were in ** the ** establishment ... 
   the fact that too much alcohol consumption could be labelled alcohol poisoning , makes is hard for me to believe that any alcohol is actually good for you . 
  you should read up on [ paracelsus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paracelsus ) . 
   all things are poison and nothing is without poison , only the dose permits something not to be poisonous . 
  and why is that crazy ? 
  you think we need infinite amount of regulations ? 
  do you know you break some regulations every day ? 
  you do understand we are waaaaay far from zero regulation , do you ? 
  so , do you think there 's a point there could be ** enough ** or too much regulation ? 
  if you just look at federal [ crimes ] ( http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2008/06/revisiting-the-explosive-growth-of-federal-crimes ) there 's over 4000 of them right now , and the congress is creating over 50 new crimes every year ... that means there 's over 50 ** more ** crimes this year than there were the last year . 
  do you know all of them ? 
  are you sure you are not a criminal ? 
  and that 's just crimes ... hey take a look at the [ code of federal regulations ] ( http://extent-of-regulation.dhwritings.com/ ) - good luck in following all of them . 
   same testimonies and everything , but none of this hyperbolic bullshit, 
  ok , so you do n't actually disagree with fontoya 's description of che 's death , you just have problem with his style and ( admittedly ) colorful language ... that 's a far cry from `` false '' do n't you think ... 
   i actually really enjoy programming in it . 
  far , far more so than other languages . 
  same here . 
  actually , when i have to do something in any other language i almost always find it lacking in some aspect . 
   needlessly duplicated facilities ( cstrings vs string , printf vs iostream , pointers vs references ), 
  cstring is not a part of the language , printf is a leftover from c and pointers are not the same as references . 
   massive bias toward copying chunks of data around rather than passing references , due to the lack of garbage collection, 
  only if you do n't know what you 're doing ... 
   poor metaprogramming facilities that you 're nevertheless forced to rely upon due to the language 's lack of generics, 
  ok , now you do n't know what you are talking about ... template metaprogramming is a most powerful part of the language . 
   it 's entirely possible to extend c into a sane , relatively pleasant object-oriented programming language, 
  c++ is not an oo language , it 's multi-paradigm language , what you are proposing is crippling it . 
  dude , you sound like heroin addict who , after trying to go clean and experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms , decides that heroin addiction is much better than being sober ... 
  gtfo !!!, 
  the `` pussy '' part is an universal stereotype ... 
  he must have a helluva time trying to squeeze into cockpit with all this gear ... , 
  actually , the democrats have more [ wealthy senators ] ( http://www.opensecrets.org/pfds/overview.php?type=w&amp;filter=s&amp;sort=d&amp;ptysort=a&amp;year=2008 ) than republicans ... 
  the deer are fighting back !, 
   ... fixed, 
  well , if you 're a burglar by trade and you do n't run when you hear the pump racking , your life expectancy is not very high ... 
  why is that a `` loophole ? '', 
  so , decide , are you a burglar or a killer ? 
  either way , your life expectancy is pretty low ... how do you know your `` victim '' has n't located you yet ? 
  perhaps even visually , not just audibly ... 
  so , do you know all the new laws passed last year ? 
  you know all of the 4000 federal crimes ? 
  what about the regulations ? 
  do you know all of them ? 
  at least she is not worrying about it to [ capsize ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5dkquy7muk ), 
  or , perhaps , they are giving you the last chance ... ? 
  if i had a burglar in my sights , i certainly would try to convince him to reconsider before killing him ... 
  iow , obama works much harder to screw us ... 
   `` lol u axed a stoopid question downgoated ! '', 
  that 's how the reddit rolls , motherfucker ... , 
  hmm ... can anybody tell me what 's all that about destroying `` way of life ? '', 
  is n't the welfare system `` destroying the way of life of homeless people ? '', 
  although there 's no 100 % secure solution , you could still make it more secure than the current system ...
