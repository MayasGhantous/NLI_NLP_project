  nope , obviously it was gimped . 
  yeah , it 's the lenght contraction , relativity dude !, 
  but they grow back when we stop . 
  whatever the author is taking it has an interesting effect , 
  what about we tax all the proponents of taxing ? 
  yeah , like i beat the shit out of my wife from time to time but other dudes do it more often ... 
  yeah , right ... and foxnews is fair and balanced ... 
  sure . 
  after being tasered , cuffed , manhandled , held in jail for 2 days judge sets you free and perhaps even admonishes the cop . 
  no problem . 
  oh , you are right , i appologise . 
  better analogy : i keep my kid locked in a basement for 5 hours a day . 
  but i 'm not too bad - the other dude locks his kid in a closet for 10 hours . 
  i thought fiber was good for you ... , 
   i worry about my economic survival every day . 
  for me , life is about economic justice, 
  so , get off your ass and find yourself a job . 
  that 's the best you can do ? 
   ca n't you sue the police department for damages after a judge rules that the police acted improperly ? 
  what 's preventing you from making it your mission to get the cop fired ? 
  jeez , scientologists can make a person 's life hell through the courts and picketing . 
  sorry , pal . 
  i have a life and do n't feel like wasting my time to `` save the world . '', 
  or punish a pig . 
  especially since it hardly ever works . 
  never been a big fan of scientology either . 
   it 's not like we live in a police state yet, 
  that 's the matter of perception . 
  or your level of tolerance of it . 
  ok try this : `` mr. nader , after years of advocating more and all-encompassing government , how do you feel when powerfull machine you helped to create has fallen into hands of this administration ? 
  do n't you think you might bear a little responsibility for current abuses ? '', 
   if you 've got better things to do than to fight for social justice , then why bitch on reddit ? 
  i do n't mind fighting , i just like to pick my own terms . 
  it 's not much fighting when you sue the cop - he 's paid for his time in court and all his legal expenses are covered ( from your tax money . ), 
  you have to cover your expenses . 
  yor chance of winning are ( statistcally ) non-existant . 
  in the worst case he 's gon na get the slap on the hand . 
  how it contributes to `` social justice '' ( whatever that might be ) beats me . 
  now , bitching on reddit does n't accomplish much either but you do n't waste too much time and any money . 
   in a true police state , dissent is not allowed . 
  in a true police state , if you get too uppity , you have a tendency to `` disappear . '', 
  yeah , in us you have a `` free speach zones . '', 
  < snicker /  the `` too uppity '' part ? 
  well , i do n't know , i guess you would `` dissapear '' if your rulers perceived you as a real threat . 
  let 's say if you are a well-known , trusted journalist , for instance . 
  would `` suicide '' with 2 bullets to the head be considered as good as `` dissapearance ? '', 
   fortunately , so far in the us , we have the right to call the police out on their misdeeds and we have recourse through the courts and the media to make things happen . 
  so , seeing all the reports of police abuse , you should have no problem pointing at many instances of offending pigs being harshly punished , should n't you . 
  and i do n't mean `` three days of paid suspension . '', 
   how is making sure cars do n't explode advocating an `` all-encompassing '' govt ? 
  oh , that 's all he did ? 
  let 's see : `` ralph nader ( born february 27 , 1934 ) is an american attorney and political activist , who has promoted a wide range of issues , including consumer rights , feminism , humanitarianism , environmentalism and democratic government . 
  [ ... ] his activism has played a large part in the creation of many governmental and non-governmental organizations , such as the environmental protection agency ( epa ) , occupational safety and health administration ( osha ) , public citizen , and several public interest research groups ( pirgs ) . '', 
  from wikipedia . 
  edit : the gvt agencies speek for themselves . 
  the non-gvt entities main role is to lobby the gvt ( to assert more power over their pet peevies ), 
  btw : it 's a problem of all `` do gooders '' who insist gvt should `` do something '' about the problems they see . 
  to `` do something '' gvt needs more power and then the same pover can be redirected to `` do something else . '', 
  very often this `` something else '' turns out to be quite the opposite of what well meaning dim-wits intended :(, 
  oh , you are sooo cute when you get angry ... 
  bush in trouble ? 
  bin laden to the rescue !, 
  you know anon_troll ? 
  i did n't know he was `` lower class . '', 
  he seem to be literate - i would expect he could find a good job if he only wanted to . 
  but i might be wrong . 
   that if every day is about economic survival , as it is for a disturbingly large number of americans, 
  we must live in different americas then ... 
   me , i 'd rather help out the good folks at the aclu, 
  if that 's what you like , sure , do it . 
  just tell me how come they are around for quite some time , fighting for our civil liberties , yet somehow it 's getting only worse and worse ? 
  mayhaps it 's not working ? 
   i mean , michael moore and noam chomsky committed suicide or disappeared under mysterious circumstances , right ? 
  and man , michael moore committed the worst crime of all . 
  i mean sicko has actually got people talking, 
  there are different ways of neutralising `` uppity ones . '', 
  chomsky is not very relevant , is he . 
  if he manages to say something our rulers deem threathening they just sick the horde of media whores to discredit him . 
  seems to be working quite well . 
  moore - you 've got ta be kidding , he is not a threat . 
  if you were a dictator would you care about some trailer trash foaming about helth care , or lack of gun control ? 
  if people start demanding any of those things they can just do it - it does n't threaten their rule , it might be even to their advantage . 
  the people who can pose a real threat are likes of [ gary webb ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gary_webb ) who exposed shennigans of the cia , or [ hunter thompson ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hunter_s._thompson ) who , according to [ this article ] ( http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/articlenews/tpstory/lac/20050226/hunter26/tpfocus/ ) got too close to the truth about 911 . 
  now , obviously , i do n't know if they were asassinated in either case it could be a legit suicide and in gary 's case it would be just a revange - they `` characted asassinated '' him before already . 
  still i find a `` two bullet suicide '' pattern a little bit suspicious . 
  hey , in the _ real _ police states there 's no proof the `` disapeared '' met their fates at the hands of the gvt . 
  who knows , maybe they got sick of it all and emigrated . 
  or commited suicide in some remote place ? 
  we only learn the truth when the regime is gone . 
  we need to get rid of them all . 
  so , she interviews for a prostitute position and is _ shocked _ what job requirments are ? 
  they know high taxes hurt business . 
  that 's why when they invest the pick tax heavens ... 
  hey man , sorry about my comment , i do n't know your situation so it was uncalled for . 
  but quite frankly the phrase `` economic ( or social ) justice '' tends to do this to me . 
  i was in the bad situation myself and know it can be tough . 
  one thing i never did was to call for gvt to tax other folks to help me . 
  hell , the taxes i had to pay did n't help in getting out of the hole ... 
  i still carry considerable debt and despite relatively high income have a hard time helping my daughter to pay for the law school . 
  i do n't get mad at the banks - they lended me money fair and square and they have every right to expect repayment .
