  nobody forces you to watch them ... 
   its a static demand , once its met its met ,, 
  that 's kinda explains your confusion . 
  there 's no such thing as static demand . 
  let 's say a grandfather clock - you might not want one at this time but if you run into someone selling it for sufficiently low price you would buy it . 
  the supply-demand curve is not just price being function of supply and demand , it 's at the same time demand ( and supply ) being function of price . 
  it 's all dynamic . 
  the biggest mistake statists make is assuming somebody can figure out the working of the economy better than the market . 
  it 's simply silly to believe that . 
  the global economy is kinda like the system of 7billion non-linear equations with 7billion variables . 
  to make the matter even worse those equations change unpredictably . 
  good luck trying to solve that ... 
  i feel your pain ... , 
   do n't forget tulips, 
  he did n't :, 
   fancy tubers, 
  well , not quite super strength but definitely huge balls ... 
  there are some jobs that need to be done and not exactly fun to do ... who would be motivated to shovel the ( literal ) bullshit , ferinstance . 
  technically , you are right but i 've seen the term used in reference to tulips before . 
  and my guess is that 's what op meant . 
  dutch are not really known for cultivating taters , are they . 
  i wonder how we survived before income tax ... 
  minor corrections : florida is gramps ' land and upstate ny should be red ... , 
  small gun store - always haggle ( used or not ) , big chain - no point ... 
  i was hoping you took the picture on your vacation trip to \u03bc columbae ... , 
  so , we know who is an alpha in your pack ... 
   this is good to know and i will definitely keep it in mind next purchase i make . 
  i said you should haggle , not necessary that you will succeed ... that depends entirely on the owner/sales person . 
  sure , go for it ... and do n't forget to add obama . 
   demand has to be static , just like supply, 
  you are hopelessly wrong . 
  ok , you do n't like grandfather clocks , so let 's say iphone ,, 
  before 2007 there was neither demand for them nor supply of them . 
  accodring to your theory , since both demand and supply are static , there 's still no demand nor supply , therefore iphone does n't exist . 
  i do n't see how they possibly can have standing ... 
  omg !, 
  highly [ partisan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/citizens_for_responsibility_and_ethics_in_washington ) `` watchdog '' group 's list names republicans as crooked . 
  who would have thought ... 
   maybe we could have some pictures of norway along side these ? 
  norway is socialist ? 
  do they have a `` collective ownership of the means of production ? '', 
  < shaking head in disbelief /  tell you what , i was born and raised in communist poland , i did n't like it there and fled to the west . 
  so did many other poles . 
  why i do n't see all these pseudo-intellectuals from the west who are so enamored with cuba emigrating there ? 
  put your fucking feet where your mouth is ... not gon na do that ? 
  did n't think so . 
  it 's so fucking easy to talk how all those ungrateful bastards from cuba do n't appreciate the blessings of the system . 
  but you 'd rather theorize about it from your comfortable chair behind your overpriced mac . 
  hypocrite . 
   i need to do what the cowboys did with their .30 lever actions : have my pistol & rifle in the same caliber . 
  you can get [ 30-30 revolver ] ( http://www.magnumresearch.com/expand.asp?productcode=bfr30-30 ) but it ai n't cheap ... 
  it 's not hard to imagine castro 's daughter being shielded from reality all her life , is it . 
  sure , they certainly do much better job with revenue from oil than chavez . 
  iow socialism can work ( does n't have to , though ) if there 's an external revenue source covering for it , and the bulk of economy is still capitalist ... 
  not every dictator is as lousy a father as stalin was ... 
  that 's seems to be the eternal whining of socialists - no matter where socialism is tried ( and fails ) they always say `` but that 's no ** real ** socialism , if ** i ** was in charge i would do a marvelous job of implementing it ! '', 
  because it 's not . 
  the difference being we do n't say `` if i was in charge ... '' we say `` if the assholes stopped meddling ... '', 
  you see , `` free market '' is just that , a market asshole politicians and other anointed `` world fixers '' are not meddling with . 
  it 's not up to those who do n't want to meddle to prove meddling fucks things up . 
  it 's up to the assholes who want to meddle to ** prove beyond any doubt ** meddling is going to improve things . 
  at this they fail spectacularly over and over again . 
  does n't keep them from doing it ... and gullible public to believe `` this time it 's gon na work - look how handsome the dude is ! '', 
   intercity schools will see increases of classroom sizes to 45 + students and have all their sports programs cut . 
  hmm ... that 's not in ** federal ** budget ... 
  ca n't talk for republicans , but it 's quite easy : stop the wars , get the troops out of the pretty much wherever overseas they are now and you could probably cat some 80 % of `` defense '' budget right there . 
  get rid of all those stupid departments that do nothing but suck the funds ( education , homeland security , small business , energy ... etc ) , dismantle atf , dea , irs . 
  stop the `` war on drugs '' ... then call me back and i tell you what to do next ... 
   health reform bill cuts the deficit . 
  dir sir ,, 
  i have untold millions stashed in the swiss bank and i have a proposition for you ... 
  dunno , you guys been laughing at three stooges all the time ... 
   label 1987 east germany as `` socialism '', 
  well , they did label themselves `` socialist '' and they did have the defining `` collective ownership of the means of production , '' did n't they . 
  and us does n't say it 's `` free market capitalism . '', 
  that 's only what clueless `` progressives '' say ... 
   he 's not saying that cuba is great in absolute terms but relative to similar caribbean countries, 
  really ? 
  that 's what he 's saying ? 
   cuba , on the other hand , is a _ model for equality _ , they have life expectancy and infant mortality equivalent to the us in spite of the embargo and in spite of the asymmetry of resources . 
  _ their production models are sustainable and they are currently the only country in the world to have achieved this _ . 
  they also have one of the highest levels of literacy in latin america . 
  in fact _ cuba scores better than most oecd countries on basic measures of quality of life _ . 
  [ _ emphasis mine _ ], 
  you seem to not be quite versed in logic yourself . 
  `` no previous background in logic required '' does n't mean `` logic is overrated . '', 
  my guess would be in this case it means `` we will cover that . '', 
  why ? 
  it just states there 's no ( logic ) prerequisite for this course ... 
  it is wobbly . 
   i do n't know , neither do you , and neither did the police at the time . 
  hmm ... let 's see ... 
  i do n't know if you have n't kidnapped a child and neither do the police . 
  i guess that make them justified to break into your house without a warrant and shoot you ... 
   you can just create more jobs indefinitely/sustainably by spending borrowed or printed money, 
  sure , look how great it worked for zimbabwe ... 
   so there is no chance of a run on the central bank , and there will never be hyper-inflation . 
  hmm ... you convinced me !, 
  i 'm running for the president on the platform of giving every american $ 1 , 000 , 000.99 every month of freshly printed money . 
  that 's right : ** every one ** becomes instantly filthy rich !,
