  < shrug /  you insinuated my position was based on the victim being `` white christian , '' it 's not . 
  it would n't change if the victim was black rasta - and i never said pigs share my pov . 
  quite the contrary , i 'm well aware they do n't . 
  so are you . 
  yet you still keep stuffing your tongue up their asses and trolling anyone who does n't ... 
  that makes you a troll ... 
   well , that you call them the victim and not the criminal is interesting in itself, 
  he got kidnapped , so he was a victim . 
  and he did n't commit a crime , so he is not a criminal . 
  ( btw : an act that does not victimize anybody is not a crime , no matter what the local or federal commisars might say . ), 
   but i did not say a thing about your view of the preacher, 
  hmm ... not only a troll but a liar too ... 
   so you like for police to use their personal views in enforcing the law . 
  some people are `` clearly '' not a threat . 
  like christian white men , right ? 
  ahm ... could you find some other meaning in what i said ... ? 
  you mean , it would be ok to sneak a webcam to my hot neighbor 's bedroom ... ? 
  so , at what age do you let your daughter chose whom to fuck ... ? 
   but will having 20 or 30 years of experience be so much better than 5 or 10 ? 
  sort of , depends on the kind of experience ... if someone worked for 30 years developing payrolls in cobol , he will not be much `` better '' than the other guy who did it for last 5 years . 
  now , someone who for the last 30 years did diverse projects for different domains using different tools ... 
  assuming he is good at it , he will be able to handle whatever you throw at him . 
  so , you really think linq is something that has no predecesors ... ? 
  no , it 's just stupid ... , 
  actually , in my experience , i keep my skills up to date much better than all the youngin 's i 've run into ... 
   they 're legitimately trying to explain the observation that there is unaccounted for gravitational force around galaxies and elsewhere . 
  so did ptolemeyan astronomers with their epicycles ... 
   the theory said there had to be planets beyond uranus, 
  the observations suggested we were missing something . 
  quite natural thing to assume were some other planets/cellestial bodies . 
  notice that astronomers back then did n't assume `` black matter '' or `` pixie dust '' to explain the discrepancies ... 
   dark matter is a plausible explanation for why our observations of galactic movement do not match the theory of gravity, 
  so is pixie dust ... 
   it would also be bad science to say ` well there must be a defect in the theory causing the discrepancy between the theory and the observation . ', 
  no , that would be a honest science ... what 's the difference between `` dark matter '' and `` black magic ? '', 
  hit to close to bull 's eye for your comfort , eh ... do n't worry , that apparent hole near the bull 's eye can be explained as an epicycle - your theory is safe ... , 
  and yet , most people believe that bunch of assholes whose only competence is in ass licking and back stabbing can , somehow , manage it ... go figure . 
  there 's something to be said for monarchy , in a minimizing the risk sense . 
  assuming the distribution of decency vs assholeness in the population favors decency , the monarch will be more likely a decent person . 
  all other models have a strong bias for selection of assholes ... 
  otoh if there 's statistically more assholes , we are fucked either way . 
  ... or , rather , that the observations ** could be intrepreted ** favorably from darkmatterists pov ... 
  yet there 's a big elephant in the room : if there 's so much dark matter in the universe ( as it has to be to keep big bang theory alive , ) how come it only appears in very distant parts of the universe ? 
  should n't we have run into at the very least small chunk of it already ? 
  i have a better idea : let 's make a dictionary of allowed arguments/counterarguments . 
  we could then just disallow anything other than the approved ones . 
  instead of typing the text in , one would simply choose from the list and the text would appear automatically ... 
  or we could even just type the number ... 
  hey , let 's face it : if you are a successful dealer , the last thing you want is legalization ... 
   and that was good science too . 
  no , it was not . 
  good science is to create the theory to explain the observations , and when the observations contradict your theory to go back to square one . 
  _ multiplying entities _ to save your theory is not a good science . 
  you can take any theory about anything and manage to pile on the `` epicycles '' until it conforms to observations ... 
  but only if you can force them to accept - otherwise the assholes will be more likely to be willing ... 
  and i 'm not quite sure i 'm comfortable with `` house of slaves '' being the rulers ... 
   also , you are absolutely right that hayek was not much of a champion for laissez-faire . 
  he supported welfare programs , antitrust legislation , and some labor regulations like a `` maximum working hour '' law . 
  hey , nobody 's perfect ... , 
   and if it conforms to all observations in the future as well , you get an extremely useful theory , as you can now base your engineering off of it . 
  ... unless you have to create a new entity with every new observation ... 
  there was never such a thing as reddit before ... reddit ? 
  what does that have anything to do with anything ? 
  my point is not to go back to feudalism , it 's that , in our current society , we might possibly be better off if the ruler was simply born into his `` office '' than with negative selection of the political process ... 
  still , i look at is as a perhaps slightly `` lesser evil '' - i 'm pretty much an individualist anarchist at heart . 
  it does n't really matter if i would have a problem or not ... at some point it 's her choice , is n't it . 
  well , she might be tad too young to fuck ... 
   have you heard of neutrinos, 
  funny you mention that : as you might already be aware , neutrino was first postulated by pauli in 1930 . 
  but , until it was experimentally shown in 1956 , it was treated as a hypothesis - even though both theory and indirect observations hinted very strongly for its existence . 
  my biggest problem with dark matter/energy ** hypothesis ** is its status as almost orthodoxy in certain circles . 
  yes , neutrino was a bitch to detect , it being nearly massless one of the main reasons . 
  the postulated dark matter , otoh , is supposed to be quite massive and quite abundant . 
  should n't be really as evasive as it seems to be ... 
  `` world map according to ronald reagan '' according to left wingnuts who still do n't understand what hit them , and are still brooding about the fall of cccp ... 
   to identify as market anarchist places undue emphasis on the economic aspects of life at the expense of broader social concerns, 
  dude makes an artificial distinction between `` market '' and `` non-market '' interactions ( granted , he is not in the minority . ), 
  but there 's really no such distinction . 
  the way i see it `` market '' is just the aggregate of all human interactions . 
  when you go to the theater , is it a `` market '' transaction ? 
  what if it is an amateur theater ? 
  street performance ? 
  there 's really no reason to artificially single out some interactions and label them `` market . '', 
  you take your sweetheart to the restaurant : market ? 
  you cook the dinner for her : not market ? 
  why is it supposed to make sense ? 
  you think risking the life of the boy was worth giving the guy a chance ... ? 
   you care because it 's hard to relate to an anonymous boy . 
  how would you feel if it was your son taken hostage ? 
  ftfy, 
   i do n't know . 
  i was n't there . 
  hmm ... yet you feel you know enough to decide the dude did n't get a `` fair chance ? '', 
  you have serious reading comprehension problems ... try to work on it ... , 
  just because i like steak , does n't mean i can not voice my opinion on the comparative advantage of caesar salad over french fries ... 
   yeah , but it 's not . 
  oh , crdoconnor says so ... 
  i must be wrong !, 
  is n't your policeman being paid ? 
  does n't soup kitchen buy the food they cook ( or get it from donnors who bought it ? ),
