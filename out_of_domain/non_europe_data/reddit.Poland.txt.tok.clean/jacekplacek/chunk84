  i 'm not really sure what your definition of `` market interaction '' is but tax is money changing hands , so why is it not a `` market interaction ? '', 
  and how much of the food you need to grow yourself for it to become `` non-market interaction ? '', 
  if you grow everything but spices , is it still `` not market ? '', 
  ok , now you are being silly ... they did n't think up some unknown , different kind of matter , they simply assumed there are objects composed of the very same matter they already knew ... 
  if that was the case , i would have no problem with it ... unfortunately it seems to have achieved a status of dogma . 
  mark my words , soon enough we will see a `` dark matter denier '' label being thrown at the `` heretics . '', 
   free , voluntary exchange by individuals . 
  it 's pretty much everybody 's definition ( apart from yours , seemingly ... ), 
  ok , this is a start . 
  ( i hope you reconsider giving up on me  and it 's really not that different from my definition , although i 've neglected to say `` voluntary . '', 
  good point . 
  so , right now our disagreement seems to be merely `` interaction '' vs `` exchange . '', 
  am i right ? 
  hope you are right ... 
   it 's just the simplest explanation that anyone has been able to think of so far, 
  well , that 's not entirely correct ... there are some other possible ( and simple ) explanations , gravitational constant not being really constant being one , ferinstance . 
  anyway , as i said , i do n't really have a problem with the theory , i have a problem with willingness of some people to elevate it to the level of fact without empirical confirmation . 
  ok , i 've already agreed to constraining the definition to `` all voluntary interactions . '', 
  ( although this may possibly introduce some `` fuzziness '' ) crdoconnor defined it in this thread as `` voluntary exchange '' but i think it 's ambiguous and really quite artificial . 
  how do you define `` exchange '' to differentiate it from `` interaction ? '', 
  is it just exchange of tangible items ? 
  that would exclude going to the opera !, 
  does one ( at least ) part of the exchange have to be tangible ? 
  what about singer inviting a painter to her recital in exchange for him letting her into his gallery ? 
  my point being all interactions are in some sense exchanges . 
  when you talk to your friend , you both ( presumably ) gain some pleasure from the exchange . 
  why is it any different than if you go to the museum to gain the pleasure of seeing the artifacts in exchange for the museum fee ? 
  in both cases you exchange something ( your time in the former and your money in the later ) for the emotional or intellectual stimulation . 
  do n't see the reason to make some kind of arbitrary distinction ... 
  well , perhaps you have some other definition of the market and some good arguments in support , let 's hear it ... , 
  well , in this case they did make the choice ... 
  seems like you got suckered into feeding the troll ... 
   i insist on going to at least one of the shoes, 
  must be for really tiny people ... , 
  ... and the progressives ' [ puppetmaster ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/george_soros ) ... 
  hmm ... from the progressives ' comments about how racist `` teabaggers '' and glenn beck are , i expected the dude to be lynched ... and he was n't even called _ nigger _ once ... 
  hey , ca n't really contribute much - i 'm too far from toronto to go , not to mention already exhausted all my vacation time ... :( maybe next time ... 
  nutella is virtually unknown in america ... 
  be gentle , you are creating some serious cognitive dissonance ... , 
  you think he would neglect to mention that ? 
  insulting ? 
  i was just observing the fact you do n't seem to understand what you are reading ... as you again demonstrate ... 
  but you have to admit la is not exactly a model american city ... , 
  hazelnuts and chocolate ... 
  i think . 
  i would n't say `` definitely '' - there are [ other ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dark_matter#alternative_theories ) possible explanations ... 
  perhaps now it is ... it was n't the case several years ago . 
  even now it 's in the ethnic or novelty sections ... 
  my point : most americans are still unaware of its existence ... 
  no , i did n't ... 
  [ just go back to the beggining ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/libertarian/comments/d6lt9/oh_for_chrissake_liberals_have_no_one_to_blame/c0xxtb8 ), 
  stop whining and go to the bar ... , 
  if you thinking `` instead of 3 employees at 40 hrs/week why not 4 at 30 hrs/week ? '', 
  the answer is pretty simple - the cost of an employee is not just the wage/salary ... 
  it might be a long term benefit ( for the company ) if the taxpayers are paying for it , if the company had to pay the cost it 's probably long ( and short ) term loss ... 
  you were asking why the companies do n't do it themselves ... 
  nope . 
  i would n't consider voting for any candidate ... 
   yeah , they 're basically in favor of the mafia for the most part . 
  this is actually still better than some of the worse dictatorships, 
  it 's , actually , still better than the `` best '' dmocracies ... the mafia dudes at least leave you alone after you pay ... 
  only because you have different definitions of `` anarcho '' and `` capitalism '' ... 
  fancy moving to north korea ? 
  i did n't say it was my definition of capitalism , just that the ancaps and most of the collectivist-anarchist have different definitions ... 
  slightly different take in [ `` the black arrow '' ] ( http://www.amazon.com/black-arrow-tale-resistance/dp/0976251604 ) - the main dude uses the bow ... there 's a dude with the katana too ... 
  methinks you are too dumb to understand the argument ... , 
   well , a most interesting reply indeed, 
  well , your handle kinda invited it ... , 
  you are still missing the point of the article : no matter what you believe about agw , the argument being debunked is still crap ... 
  let me put it this way - there 's a chance the cell phones might cause you a brain tumor . 
  i have a nifty headgear for sale that could shield your brain from the cell phone waves . 
  so , your choice seems to be pretty clear : you just have to buy it from me , if you follow this logic ... , 
  stick to the school that does n't pay much attention to grammar ... , 
  ok , so they have the dude in custody , ask for help in iding him and they show the picture of him in the dark glasses and a hat ... ?!, 
  guess they are not really that desperate to know who he is ... 
  depends on who was doing the expectin ' ... 
  number one reason : she pisses off all the right people ... , 
   should n't this be an argument in favor of strict divisions between businesses and those who regulate them, 
  you want to keep all politicians locked up ? 
  hmm ... perhaps not such a bad idea ... , 
   presence of these monolithic corporate superpowers, 
  like ibm ? 
  surely , misrosoft had n't had a chance ... 
  like microsoft ? 
  surely google had n't had a chance ... 
  what about such giants as digital or data general ... ? 
  ok , ok , ... there 's a ** big ** fucking difference - each party , when in power , picks their own buddies ... < / s , 
  oh , btw , there 's also a huge difference between cosa nostra and camorra ... moron . 
  are you also admonishing tigers for having the `` fangs and claws '' advantage ... ? 
  natural selection ... the one that made it is gon na grow to be one smart duck ... , 
   you take the claws and fangs , i 'll take the gun . 
  ready ? 
  claws and fangs are n't my natural weapons ... you want to take on a tiger - be my guest . 
  and if you go to the taiga alone ( with your gun ) i will not bet on the outcome of your meeting the tiger ... 
  humans are woefully inadequate predators without tools - you would n't be here if your ancestors have n't figured it out how to make spears and how to use them . 
  guns are just an improvement on spears ... , 
   i 'd guess you are american or canadian, 
  you would guess wrong  i 'm a pole , although i live now in us ( and in canada before that ) and i never hunted ... maybe one day ... 
   i 'd rather watch a deer through binoculars with my son , than ` bond ' with him by showing him how to kill it . 
  that 's your choice .
