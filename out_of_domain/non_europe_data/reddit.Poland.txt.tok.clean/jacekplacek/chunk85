  otoh , every civilisation eventually collapses - are you sure yours is not gon na collapse in your son 's lifetime ? 
  perhaps he could find himself in a situation when knowing how to hunt could save his life ... 
  for a learning experience you might want to google `` democratic party billionaire donors '' ... 
  obama did paint himself as such ... 
   once they are out of business , you are free to jack up prices to whatever you would like, 
  which would just create huge opportunity for the next competitor , so you would have to sell at loss to eliminate him , after he goes out of business you would have to jack up prices and create an entry for another one ... where are you getting all this money to cover your losses from ? 
   of course they were n't all part of the planning , but many of them could have figured it out afterwards and none of them , not a single one talked ? 
  how corrupt do you have to be to not talk about thousands of deaths ? 
  corrupt ? 
  if you were one of those , would you come out ? 
  and be branded `` conspiracy nut ? '', 
  how do you know some of those `` truthers '' and other `` loony tunes '' ( according to you ) are n't just such people ... ? 
  ok , smartass , if you had to chose between living in somalia back then when it did have a government and now , what 'd be your choice ? 
  are you aware that in the timeframe when un/us/neighboring countries gave up attempt to install their puppet governments in somalia , it was the fastest growing economy in africa ? 
  and that the murder numbers ( not rate ) in baltimore were much higher than in mogadishu , despite the later being much bigger than the former ? 
  the point being , yes , the `` libertarianism '' seems to have worked in somalia better than statism ... 
   people are power hungry sob 's , and will use violence to keep/get it . 
  it always amazes me that statists know that and at the same time have no problems with granting the same power hungry sobs extraordinary power ... 
  darwin in action ... , 
   is the government really failed , or are too many people in it [ ... ] corrupted, 
  yes . 
   besides this whole thing is 14 years old . 
  ... and we all know the laws of economics fundamentally change every decade ... < / s , 
   i allow most anything and let the downvotes take care of the trash, 
  looks like they did in this case as well ... perhaps , by threatening to ban the troll , you actually keep feeding it ? 
   but that is n't japan, 
  who else uses hiragana ? 
  ... and the former stasi 's are sobbing ... 
  hey dude , your capslock is on ... 
   there 's no death penalty for not paying taxes . 
  there 's no death penalty for not paying the mafia 's `` protection fee '' either ... 
  but what would happen in the real world ? 
  if you do n't pay your taxes and ignore all requests-to-file/subpoenas/judgments , eventually guys with guns will show up at your place to arrest you . 
  if you resist you will be killed ... 
  hey , i do n't like paying for my life insurance but i would n't mind to pay if i find out i have a cancer ... 
  you sain ' they will eventually give up and forget the dough ? 
  they got to you already and glued the capslock in ... ( their keylogger sucks and logs only capital letters ) . 
   i 've got mine , so fuck you , jack is more the american style of life . 
  funny you 'd say that - americans seem to be [ the most generous people on earth ] ( http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=236671 ) ... not that i expect you to change your bovine mind ... 
  ... except for the troll ... 
  you 've got ta be kidding ... `` official development assistance ! '', 
  - in other words , index of how much the politicians of the rich countries take from their poor to donate to the rich in poor countries ... so , yes , in that metric the politicians of bunch of european countries are very generous with their taxpayers money ... 
  you still do n't get it , do you . 
   if luxembourg , norway or sweden had budget the size of usa they would be the most generous people on earth, 
  nope , they would just have the `` most generous parasites '' ... 
  let me explain that to you : if i were to smack you over the head and take your wallet , and then , drop some of the bills from your wallet into the panhandler 's hat - would you call me generous ? 
  btw i 'm not mad at you , just slightly amused ... , 
   first link you provided showed that usa gives the most amount of money per person . 
  in charitable donations , yes . 
  this is very different than politicians spending taxpayers ' money . 
  ponder on it . 
   i 'm saying `` if this happens , and this happens , and this happens , and this happens , and this happens , and finally , you shoot back at the cops you might get killed '' ai n't exactly the same as someone pulling a gun on you and taking your money . 
  so , let 's look at different ( slightly ) scenario : you are paying your mafia `` protection '' money . 
  if you one day refuse , the dude responsible for collecting just shrugs and goes away . 
  next day another dude shows up and just breaks some of your furniture as a `` warning '' . 
  next day some other dude shows up with the intent to drill your knee caps ... they will kill you only if you still resist ... 
  i guess , you are right : `` there 's no death penalty for not paying mafia '' ... 
   but who do you think will run things absent a government, 
  how about everybody `` runs their own things ? '', 
  why do you believe some bunch of duchebags can run your life better than you could ? 
  but you are really just straying off the topic , so it 's no longer `` there 's no death penalty '' it changed to `` the death penalty is a necessity '' ... 
  `` necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom . 
  it is the argument of tyrants ; it is the creed of slaves . '', 
   if you could wave a magic wand and somehow change human behavior, 
  funny you 'd say that : so , the people are too evil to be left alone but , somehow , they become saints when they start working for the government ... 
  you fellows have to decide what `` far right '' means ... you keep calling libertarians `` far right '' , yet most of them are for open borders ... can you at least try to be consistent or does `` far right '' mean `` we do n't like them ? '', 
  and that 's when the bully [ grows up ] ( http://www.legaljuice.com/policeman%20police%20officer%20cop.jpg ), 
   who is `` you fellows '' ? 
  you know who you are ... , 
   if you want to read about why libertarians and nationalists are both classified as far right , wikipedia unsurprisingly has an article on left-right politics . 
  oh , i was right then ... `` far right '' = `` we do n't like them '' ... 
  `` the argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies , one , perhaps , of the right and the other of the left , is a foolish idea acceptable only to doctrinaire and academic thinkers . '', 
  _ carroll quigley _, 
   at what point has the two party system been discussed, 
  : `` that 's why we hold public officials accountable through the election process '', 
  iow your `` election process '' is a sham designed to keep simpletons happy ... 
   you love responding with quotes , well here is a famous one :, 
  considering that the dude who said it was a beneficiary of the system , despite being a big time fuck-up ( look up gallipoli ) , drunkard and a weasel , it appears to be pretty self-serving , _ ce n'est pas _ ? 
   you seem to be saying if no system is perfect than we should ignore the problem all together . 
  no , actually , i 'm saying `` let everybody figure the solution out for themselves '' ... either individually , or even collectivelly ** in a voluntary manner ** . 
   that makes no rational sense . 
  what makes no rational sense is to expect the institution , that attracts the worst of humanity and gives them the extraordinary powers , to protect interests of the people ... despite long track record ( and common sense ) proving otherwise . 
  `` insanity : doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results . '', 
  _ albert einstein _, 
   this is like seeing the beatles get super popular , then going `` hey , i play guitar too ... i should just go out and get as popular as them ! '', 
  seemed to work for some ... , 
   have you ever compared government pay to private sector pay ? 
  have you ? 
  how much do you think the sneering bitch at dmv is paid , comparing to cheerful , smiling barista at starbucks ? 
  not to mention the power hungry assholes are more interested about having the slave-owner powers than money . 
  besides , look at how much ex-politicians are making for sitting on the boards of corporations they served during their terms ... 
   we have figured it out for ourselves , it 's called `` democracy . '', 
  and it 's totally voluntary . 
  you are free to leave if you do n't like it . 
  what more could you ask for ? 
  that 's as voluntary as it gets . 
  i guess mafia 's `` protection '' is `` as voluntary as it gets '' too ... you are free to leave , after all ... 
   i do n't have an unshakable trust in government . 
  you , certainly , have us fooled ... 
  why ?
