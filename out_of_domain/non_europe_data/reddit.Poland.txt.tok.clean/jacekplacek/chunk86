  if she wants it ... 
   `` to lob '' means to hit or toss high into the air, 
  still makes weird kind of sense ... , 
  is n't humor supposed to be , actually , you know ... funny ? 
  you have a problem with that ? 
  perhaps your eyes are much better than mine ... 
  i myself can not see if i hit the target without the scope . 
  less successful ? 
  it kinda depends on what your definition of `` success '' is ... if the goal was to create a police state , the success is quite obvious ... 
  i have just written a program too ... have you seen anything like this ? 
  ` echo hello reddit ! `, 
  i ca n't find anything like it ... , 
   yes you can buy guns from individuals with 0 background checks , i purchased a shotgun a few years ago just to confirm this . 
  they did not even ask for my name . 
   so yes , this is true . 
  individuals need to be eliminated , or at least require heavy background checks . 
  ftfy, 
  voter turnout in soviet russia was pretty close to 100 % . 
  does it mean anything ? 
  says much more about huffpo than anything else ... 
  i thought the cop killed his bridge partner after botched grand slam ... , 
  it 's all republicans ' fault !, 
  wait till democrats get in power - they will make everything a-ok ... 
  no , no no !!!, 
  he is wrong !, 
  they hate us for our freedom ... 
  hey dude , there are two arrows next to each and every post . 
  use them . 
  let 's see ... if i decide to `` render a service '' for you by playing guitar for two hours every day under your balcony , am i entitled to demand a payment . 
  can i threaten you with kidnapping/bodily harm/death if you refuse to pay ? 
  hey , you always have an option to move out if you do n't agree to my `` services '' ... 
  you mean this :, 
   but you can go to someone 's house , tell them in 18 years that you 're going to paint their house , if they do n't opt out in any of those 18 years with a form you 're giving them , here it is , then 16 years later remind them every six months , and then they do n't opt out , and you paint their house . 
  then they owe you money . 
  not a court in the fucking world that would interpret the quiet complicity as anything but consent . 
  try that . 
  i want to see the court ruling in your favor ... if you do n't have an actual contract that i signed , or some other evidence i did ask you to do it and agreed to pay you , good luck !, 
  ( btw : this post is not an evidence i 'm agreeing to pay you ), 
  the time for armed revolution has passed long time ago ... coming soon : the collapse of the western civilisation . 
   there has never been a society in which anything was ever regulated for the `` common good '', 
  ftfy, 
  ruling class never acts `` for the common good . '', 
  they ** always ** act for their own benefit ... 
  why should they ? 
  do you have a rational argument against mandatory cavity searches ... ? 
   and if they outlaw it , what religion is being established ? 
  '' ... or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ... '', 
  i do n't vote . 
  singapore ? 
   the planet destroyed, 
  omg !, 
  the planet destroyed !, 
  such as in the mid holocene , we all know it was destroyed back then and it took prophet algor ( gaia bless him ) to come to earth and say `` let it be cold . '', 
  and it was cold ... 
   thousands of climate scientists got together in secret and pledged to all falsify their life 's work, 
  nope . 
  the `` scientists '' who are `` showing '' the sky is falling are getting more grants . 
  politicians really love emergencies , esp . 
  the emergencies that they can `` solve '' by getting more power ... 
   there 's a lot more grant money to be had in strongly disputed fields, 
  [ _ citation needed _ ], 
  so , if you were a scumbag politician ( is that redundant ? ), 
  and had the option to grant money to the scientist whose research suggests the sky is falling and you could accumulate more power by promising to `` do something about it '' vs the scientist whose research shows your intervention is not needed/irrelevan/harmfull - which one would you chose ? 
   if a well known climatologist were to pop up saying `` it 's all a hoax and i can prove it ! '', 
  they 'd be absolutely swamped with money . 
  actually , there are those who say exactly that . 
  and instead of being `` swamped with money '' they are called `` deniers '' and their research is pretty much swept under the rug ... 
   just came off 8 years of a completely anti agw president, 
  so , you really believe president is the dude who signs all grants ... ? 
   the co2 levels are [ unprecedented ], 
  is that [ so ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carbon_dioxide#in_the_earth.27s_atmosphere ) ? 
  pay special attention to :, 
   five hundred million years ago carbon dioxide was 20 times more prevalent than today , decreasing to 4-5 times during the jurassic period and then slowly declining with a particularly swift reduction occurring 49 million years ago, 
   by that i assume you mean assessed and dismissed through peer review . 
  [ yup . 
  ] ( http://www.the-funneled-web.com/images_2008/peerreview-acs.gif ), 
  mostly , i 'm just a nit-picker ... otoh , the co2 levels seem to be a function of the temperature , not the other way around . 
  i think it 's pretty silly to attribute `` global warming '' to the puny amounts of co2 we managed to put into atmosphere ... kinda like a village pissing into the ocean and believing it caused the tide ... 
  so , in your opinion , to make people fear the guns less we need to hide them ? 
  only if there 's a prohibition on politicians ... or even better an open season on them , 
  why ? 
  he is such a good clown ... , 
  `` if voting could change anything they would make it illegal ... '', 
  but since it was corraborated by hunt himself ( on his deathbed to boot ) it should warrant consideration , should n't it . 
  will ridley scott ever apologize to van vogt ? 
   m16 in the us costs about $ 12k - $ 20k, 
  not to mention you have to jump through the numerous hoops with fingerprinting and detailed background check to be able to purchase one ... 
   you have the option of having no government , or a different government , yet you choose this government . 
  the same argument gentelman from mafia used before drilling my kneecap ... 
   libertarianism still believes that government ought to serve a purpose of national defense , and to do that taxation is a requirement . 
  it 's just like saying `` socialism still believes that kulaks should be starved and dissenters should be sent to gulags ... '', 
   ok , but under this state system what happens if the state says `` we do n't care , we 're not going to pay reparations/prosecute the prpetrator . '', 
  then what ? 
  basically what i 'm pointing out is that you can have state authority , but how are you going to manage disputes between states without a central authority/world government/mediator if one of them is n't voluntarily compliant ( without having a big shootout ) ? 
  ftfy, 
  you would be well advised to actually try to learn something on the topic you are commenting about ... 
  you might want to check what the meaning of `` liberal '' was in 1840 's ... so , who 's an idiot now ? 
  well , you have no bloody idea what you are talking about . 
  somalia does n't have feudalism ( look it up ) it is a clan society as it was before the white people forced the state on it ... 
  it 's pretty much better off in every aspect if you compare it to the times it had a government ...
