  i venture an opinion it 's still much better off in every aspect than neighboring states . 
  well , the mafia did n't attack me before giving me `` protection '' either ... 
   it is just a hell-hole of corrupt private security forces . 
  shows you have absolutely no idea ... read the wikipedia article on somalia to understand why . 
   and you could actually choose not to deal with them ? 
  sure i could . 
  by moving out - your favorite means of chosing not to deal with the state . 
   why am i an idiot, 
  for exactly the same reason you called bartab an idiot ... 
  ... and , judging by somalia 's example , it will be healthier than it is now or than its neighbors are ... 
   no conscionable meeting of the minds or exchange of goods, 
  you mean exactly like in the case of government ? 
   given lots of instructions on how to opt out, 
  funny , the government never gave me any instructions how to opt out ... can you send them to me ? 
  funny you mention that ... according to wikipedia somalia seems to be doing better in that metric than some of its [ neighbours ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/child_mortality#highest_rates_in_the_world ) ... are you suggesting that is us stays statist instead , its child mortality rate is going to reach the level of sierra leone ? 
   and just because you 're healthy does n't mean you have to help someone who ca n't help themselves . 
  but i will . 
  so far , you have only shown a desire to force other people to do that ... 
   it did n't work . 
  [ _ citation needed _ ], 
   you would need something to fund the court system and so forth . 
  what 's wrong with paying when actually using it ? 
   also , persons who wish to renounce u.s. citizenship should also be aware that the fact that a person has renounced u.s. citizenship may have no effect whatsoever on his or her u.s. tax or military service obligations, 
  iow i can opt out but still have to pay up ... 
  well , mafia offers much better deal - to stop paying their protection fee all i need to do is move out . 
  no need for paperwork or severance fee ... 
  if i were in ethiopia or sudan , i would certainly consider that ... 
  well hillary , ** your ** ( and your co-rulers ' ) unwillingness to end the insane war on drugs is the ** main ** reason ... 
  yeah , i know ... kinda like a slave of the nice master , what am i bitching about ? 
  it could be much worse ... 
  yet many did manage to leave ... 
  i 'm not quite sure if it was much more difficult for a slave to escape than for you to move to another country ... which in itself would just be a change of a master , not really a freedom ... 
  it 's not illegal to move to mars . 
  does it make it a viable option ? 
  i compared it on the same attribute you invoked : legality ... 
  i could easily paraphrase your argument, 
   moving to another country is not in any way comparable with swimming across the river to the free state . 
  probably the compartment screws/ties/brackets came in ... 
   ask them about methods to make peace across the world , and you 'll likely get no answer, 
  ask them about breeding unicorns and you will get no answer either ... 
   articles of confederation were scrapped . 
  and how does it indicate they did n't work ? 
  methinks , they were scrapped because they did work ... 
  funny thing , billy , now that he 's got not that much income but lots of dough , wants to tax those who are productive ... guess he ** really ** want 's to keep his status as the richest maddafucka . 
  make no mistake , income tax is not the tax on the rich - you can be mega-rich with no or not much income . 
  it 's a tax on the productive , those that could , potentially , get richer than billy-boy . 
  can not have that , can we . 
   it would have been had al gore taken the white house in 2000, 
  [ _ citation needed _ ], 
   if you mean citation for the fact that al gore should have taken the white house in 2000, 
  if i meant that i would cite the second part of your statement . 
  go back , re-read and substantiate your apparent belief st. al would shrink the government ... 
  and try to work on your reading comprehension skills ... 
   you quote the wrong part of his comment like a dumbass and then have the nerve to tell him to work on his reading comprehension skills ? 
  i quoted the wrong part ? 
  does anybody understand english anymore ? 
  ok , for the comprehensially challanged out there here 's the flow :, 
   the era of big government is over, 
   it would have been had al gore taken the white house in 2000, 
   if you mean citation for the fact that al gore should have taken the white house in 2000, 
   if i meant that i would cite the second part of your statement . 
  go back , re-read and substantiate your apparent belief st. al would shrink the government ... 
  so , einstein , when did i cite the wrong part of the statement ? 
  you ever heard of `` tongue-in-cheek '' ... guess not . 
   you are stupid . 
  and your mother smells of elderberries ... 
   at the time everyone agreed that the articles of confederation did n't work . 
  you should watch the moon less often and try to read something from time to time ... it can broaden your horizons if you are open to it . 
  [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/patrick_henry ) could be a good place to start ... 
  ok . you convinced me . 
  i was 'n going to bother - but thanks to you i 'm going to vote . 
  straight tea party ticket ... , 
  ok , so the mere civilian can not carry a gun at the polling place but the `` more equals '' can ... ? 
  you do n't think there 's something not quite right for some people to be `` more equal ? '', 
  and , no , i think everyone should have a right to carry anywhere ( s ) he wants ... 
   and because that 's worth a lot, 
  [ _ citation needed _ ], 
   it would make more sense [ statistically ] to purchase a lottery ticket and pledge the winnings to the candidate of your choice, 
  it would make even more sense to purchase a lottery ticket and pledge to retire on arruba ... 
  you ** really ** think they are `` more equal ! '', 
  hmm . . should n't the people with those `` judgements '' simply pay off their debts with ... fake money ? 
   charges were thrown out against roughly 100 people, 
  since those arrests were simply meant to intimidate , still it 's `` mission accomplished '' ... :(, 
  when in doubt shoot , shovel and shut-up ... ( if you can ) , 
   grew up to be more secure and confident, 
  perhaps that 's the point . 
  secure and confident do n't make good subjects ... 
  we all know they are just dedicated public servants , whose only concern is the safety of the american peepul ... < / s , 
  $ 0.6 t goes to `` stimulus '' , the rest to banksters ... , 
  you mean better balls ... 
  must be one of those christian ( or muslim ? ), 
  fundamentalists we keep hearing about ... , 
  i guess you are compiling for 64bit : the array [ ] is decaying at the point of call to int \\* . 
  sizeof ( int \\* ) in 64bit is 8 . 
  edit reddit eats asterisks ...  how do you escape it for display ? 
  ok , that works . 
  thx . 
  not really . 
  :( you could use std : : vector < int  instead . 
  or you need to pass the size as another argument ...
