   all it takes is one smooth talker to start gathering the influence necessary to infringe on the rights of others . 
  now , i 'm confused . 
  you understand that , yet you begrudge libertarians for wanting the government to be small and powerless ... does it mean you want `` one smooth talker to start gathering the influence necessary to infringe on the rights of others ? '', 
  so , you are basically straussian ( whether you know it or not ) - we did have a bunch of them in power quite recently , did n't seem to work too well . 
  the only way this could work ( to a degree ) is a hereditary aristocracy/monarchy but only in a society with deeply rooted culture of _ noblesse oblige _ . 
  you throw in any other system of selecting the rulers and the scum always goes to the top ... 
  matts , why do you have to always bring the `` oy vey , gevalt , anti-semitism '' argument ? 
  it 's been stale for years now and nobody buys it anymore ... 
  hmm ... would love to , but i charge $ 100.00 an hour plus expenses ... 
  depends on the caliber ... pretty sure .32 would n't really have much of an impact ... 
   whatever is defined to be the initial government might indeed be small and powerless , but as factions of citizens begin to form and gain power , they eventually will either increase the power of the government at their behest , or replace it outright . 
  there 's still another option : government ( and political power ) becoming obsolete ... 
  what makes you think we are n't now ... ? 
  oh , so because the jews were discriminated against/persecuted in the past , israel has the right to do whatever they want to whoever they want ... ? 
  having the monopoly on killing/imprisoning people . 
   the baby boomers only hated the man until they were old enough to become him . 
  ... some of them ... 
   what happened to the palestinians in 1948, 
  it 's still happening , if you have n't noticed ... 
  so , now fbi entrapment is politics ... ? 
  dude di n't get the `` do n't talk to the police '' memo ... 
  1993 wtc bombing . 
  instigated by the fbi , explosives provided by the fbi despite fbi informant edam salem asking them to provide fake explosives instead . 
  btw salem had enough horse sense to actually secretly record his conversations with fbi handlers , that 's why we know that . 
  different times ... 
  you look better now ... , 
  if people really understood government they would become anarchists ... 
  that means the public should be disbanded too ... 
  no , they would just say it 's `` voters ' apathy '' ... 
  you have a different take on it ? 
  do n't you know , founding dudes could n't possibly imagine the intertubes , so the 1st amendment could n't cover it ... / s, 
   it is illegal for sources to release confidential information, 
  hmm ... does it mean they also block any transactions by the cia ? 
  seems like they should if they want to be consistent ... 
  _ 1980 , communist poland . 
  solidarity starts the general strike . _, 
  adminatorski says :, 
   there are ways to `` support workers rights '' that do n't involve hurting other people 's livelihood . 
  these strikes are narrowminded and put on by hooligans who have no idea how their actions can ripple back to your average everyday person . 
   illegal for whomever was leaking that information to wikileaks to do so . 
  which it is . 
  illegal where ? 
  it was illegal ( in soviet union ) for solzhenitsyn to publish `` gulag archipelago '' - do you believe ymca press should have refused to publish it ? 
  soviets were using `` enemies of the people '' as the slave labor and did n't give a fuck about their living or dying and solzhenitsyn `` leaked '' that fact.it was illegal for him to `` expose state secrets '' and yet , ymca press published this `` leak . '', 
  wikileaks is simply publishing what others are exposing even if the leaks are `` state secrets '' and even if , according to the state in question , it is `` illegal '' for the leaker to leak ... 
  it might be a surprise to you but wikileaks published much more than the `` diplomatic cables '' and assange is not under nda from us or any other country . 
  he might be legally bound not to disclose australian `` state secrets '' , though ... 
   it 's illegal to leak classified documents . 
  it was illegal in soviet union to write about gulag ... did you also absolve google for agreeing to chinese censorship ? 
  what does al-gore mean ? 
   wo n't listen to your simple instructions because they are too stupid , too high , too drunk , or want to kill you, 
  do n't hold back , ossifer , tell us how it feels to have the power to demand people follow your `` simple instruction '' and to kill them if they do n't ... ? 
  i see you like to bring your own vaseline ... 
  southern white poor : the only remaining category it 's politically correct to viciously stereotype ... 
  it seems the dude knew what he was talking about - he was kinda considered an expert . 
  the ** only ** problem : he did n't have `` papieren '' ... 
  funny how they say the doctors who attended his seminars are `` victims '' - there 's no evidence what they learned there was incorrect or substandard , there 's lot of evidence it was valuable . 
  yet they are victims because dude lacked government 's approval ... 
  yet , if he were a know-nothing quack but had the `` papieren '' everything would be hanky-dory . 
  how is he standing up for me ? 
   it 's a loose collective mainly of teenagers with some time on their hands , and older people ( almost all men ) with more nous and considerably more technical skills . 
  and he knows that from spending `` big chunk of thursday '' on the irc ... ? 
  hey , arthur , for what you know it could be bunch of old ladies bored of playing bridge and simply fucking with your mind ... 
  oh , and you deduced all of that just from the clothes they wear ... funny , i recall hearing similar rants back when i was a kid about my generation ... mostly voiced by the old obnoxious farts ... 
  hmmm ... so , first you say `` bush did it too '' and then `` they not the same '' ... 
  you would n't list westboro baptists picketing the marine funeral as a watershed moment of christianity , would you . 
   those events that occurred ( circled ) in the name of islam were huge , ( look at the wars and money spent because of these events ), 
  i guess you would also include [ vom rath ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ernst_vom_rath ) 's assassination in a timeline of judaism ... 
   attempted to invade america, 
  yup . 
  they even managed to breed camels able to swim across the ocean to bring invading hordes to america ... 
   god wipes out new orleans b/c of gays, 
  wonder why did he chose new orleans and not san francisco ... 
  hmm ... dubya shrub said the god told him to invade iraq . 
  does it mean invasion of iraq is a significant point in the history of christianity ... ? 
   ( yes , christians , the terrorists who committed the okc bombings were christians -- that fact is inarguable regardless of its inconvenience ), 
  ftfy, 
   [ gleiwitz incident ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gleiwitz_incident ) : resulted in invasion by the nazi germany of poland ( and later on almost all europe . ), 
  sounds significant to me . 
  ftfy, 
  you really believe 911 `` caused '' the invasions ? 
  do you also believe [ gleiwitz incident ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gleiwitz_incident ) `` caused '' wwii ? 
  hmm ... banning is not the only problem ... just for the lulz , go and order `` turner diaries '' from amazon and a few days later check your car for the trackers ... you can even post the pictures ... , 
   anarchy is the absence of social , political and economic hierarchies . 
  anarchists are dedicated to the eradication of those hierarchies . 
  from white supremacy to capitalism to patriarchy , we resist all forms of domination . 
  hmm ... looks to me like he established himself as the very top of hierarchy and exercised the supreme form of domination . 
  you just did n't read it correctly : he is a geico agent and he will actually sell you an insurance policy ... 
  so , the israeli army is a paragon of virtue ... ? 
  if the dude actually killed some jew , you would be right ; shooting someone for saying something stupid otoh ... 
  but the main point being , makhno himself was the very essence of hierarchy - having the power of deciding who lives and who dies . 
  you know what , back in communist poland we were hearing the same arguments : `` omygod do n't anger the commies , they gon na just increase the oppression ... '', 
   fear is the passion of slaves _ patrick henry _, 
  yes i do . 
  that 's why it cracks me up when some self-professed anarchists say they are against ** all ** hierarchies ... see also :, 
   anarchists are dedicated to the eradication of those hierarchies . 
  hmm ... so , i guess you would n't have a problem with some auschwitz products ... like soap or lampshades ferinstance ... 
  hint : freedom of speech means you have a right to say what you want ; it does ** not ** mean everybody has to love it . 
  that 's not something they worry about - they have job security , even if there were 90 % reduction in air travel they would still have their jobs ... perhaps molesting amtrak/greyhound/subway passengers . 
  look at it this way : if you keep giving teenagers whiskey and car keys , in many cases nothing bad will happen ... but do you want to bet on the outcome ?
