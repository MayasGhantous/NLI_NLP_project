  yup . 
  and i knew some drunk-driving teenagers who are still alive and well ... the dangers of drunk-driving must be greatly exaggerated ... 
  and to think of it , there are ( were ) some well known us senators and us presidents who were known for dui - i guess we should really encourage it . 
  it 's a sure path to political success ... / s, 
  still your chances are not zero ... you could get one as a xmas gift ... 
  _ de gustibus non disputandum est _ ... hey , i know the dude who likes listening to abba ... , 
  `` marginal cost of new gas station exceeds the marginal benefit to society from competition in this particular case . 
  the most realistic socially optimal outcome is , therefore , regulate ... '', 
  copy and paste replacing `` gas station '' with `` grocery store '' , `` cinema '' , `` car factory '' , etc , etc. . . 
  yup . 
  no matter what happens , you can claim `` i told you so ... '', 
  i do n't get what you are bitching about . 
  you sayin ' he was running a racket ; who 's better to run the government racket ? 
  that 's the same danes who are the only western people to have official state church ... ? 
  edit : ok , the only other than vatican ... , 
   fuck that bitch . 
  it is absolutely outrageous if ciran036 is n't charged with incitement to rape . 
   when the left wing hate machines spews vitriol day after day demonizing anyone who is n't left of center , it 's obviously only a matter of time before some nut follows through on the threats . 
  it works both ways ... 
   political assassinations are particularly heinous . 
  why ? 
  do you really believe killing a politician is worse than , say , killing a child ? 
   certain murders in history have extraordinary long-term consequences for millions . 
  yup . 
  and some that did n't happen as well ... ( would n't it be nice if someone wasted certain austrian painter or georgian linguist ferinstance . ), 
  but what does it have to do with the crime being heinous ? 
  politicians deal in violence so they have to be prepared to take it as well . 
  innocent children do n't . 
   no one was being brutally beaten or murdered for a viewpoint, 
  us journalists are already well trained . 
  no need to . 
  so , you decided to do exactly what they are doing ... ? 
  can we have cops monitor when you take a dump ? 
   a chemical reaction which irreparably converts it into a useless compound, 
  they do n't teach chemistry where you came from , do they . 
   the value is retained, 
  ... are you trying to say the value of today 's dollar is the same as it was 100 years ago ? 
  otoh i 've read somewhere the roman senator 's toga was worth about 1oz of gold ... kinda like armani suit today ... 
  so , citing thomas jefferson is a crime now ? 
  dunno ... does obama saying `` they bring a knife , we bring a gun '' qualify ? 
  that would be `` kurwa ma\u0107 '' ... 
  and `` kill clinton '' just 3 million ... which would n't be at all surprising for someone with iq higher than the room temperature ... 
  evidence ? 
  what evidence ? 
  the goalie really sucks ... , 
  i do n't see how racist rag is relevant to r/libertarian ... 
  somebody bombed new york times building ? 
  apparently the six ** dead ** victims do n't deserve as much grieving as wounded politician ... 
  the only problem : there is an actual footage of bomb squad removing those explosives from the building ... 
  you missing the point : clinton got his okc right when he needed it , pnac dudes got their `` catalyzing event '' right after getting into power , now obama has his `` event '' too ... pretty lucky bunch , eh ... 
  the first group lenin acted against was socialists . 
  what does it prove ? 
  original meaning of `` liberal '' was laissez-faire liberal - today 's left is anything but ... 
   with no explanation as to how mcveigh would have gotten them inside , right ? 
  you are right that mcveigh could n't have gotten them inside ... you probably never heard of gen. [ partin ] ( http://100777.com/node/106 ) either , have you ... 
   obscure law, 
  yup , the old irrelevant thingie called the constitution ... 
  `` if voting could change anything , they would make it illegal . '', 
  _ emma goldmann _ ( i think ), 
  i have read it , thank you very much . 
  and what 's your point ? 
  that 's what it says : '' ** if ** voting could change anything ... '', 
  it can not , so there 's no need to make it illegal . 
  it was a sarcasm . 
  look it up . 
   we should find out why some people feel the need to carry the auto insurance in the first place . 
  what is making them so scared that they ca n't leave their home without carrying an insurance card ? 
  ftfy, 
   not how i 'd define cherry-picking results , but , hey , i 'm too ill to care . 
  but it is . 
  singling out ** gun ** crime is cherry picking . 
  consider this : if there 's no guns in ruritania and its murder rate is highest in the world , it still would lead as the ** lowest ** `` gun murder '' country ... iow , you are picking your statistics to suit your thesis . 
  in your mind what is the socially optimal number of bureaucrats to fuck you up your ass ? 
  do n't buy a beaver pond if all you want is some beaver play ... , 
   based on a philosophy that shamelessly rejects scientific analysis, 
  ... like all those pesky mathematicians ... 
  it is n't economically true . 
  see [ broken windows fallacy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parable_of_the_broken_window ), 
  keith olbermann is krugman 's wife ??? 
   now i 'm reading a more keynesian type book , and it makes a ton of sense, 
  [ a little knowledge is a dangerous thing ] ( http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/a-little-knowledge-is-a-dangerous-thing.html ), 
  galileo ? 
  there 's a lot more misconceptions flying around about austrians than real understanding of the school . 
  one is `` teh market will cure all '' . 
  what the austrians are saying ( and proving ) instead is in a nut shell : `` you can not outperform the market in the long run . '', 
  nothing more , nothing less . 
  iow all the keynesians are promising is pretty much bs . 
  the only reason they have any influence is because they ** are ** promising and people ( politicians including ) love being promised stuff . 
  and since there 's no way of making economic experiments in a scientific sense , they always can claim their `` solutions '' worked by saying `` it would be much worse without our intervention . '', 
  kinda like old time medics ' `` treatment '' of blood-letting . 
  patient got better ? 
  that 's a proof it worked !, 
  patient died ? 
  well , he would die much sooner if it were n't for us !, 
  also the gold issue - all the austrians are saying is the money is just another good . 
  granted , it is special kind of a good but it 's still subject to all economic laws , including the law of supply and demand . 
  so , it should be also left to the market to handle for the optimal results . 
  what market would chose as money is a secondary issue . 
  it just happens that for ages markets chose gold or silver and it did work quite ok . 
  oh , yeah , certainly 911 did a lot of good for ** some ** people ... like larry silverstein , who made a lots of money on it ... lucky dude .
