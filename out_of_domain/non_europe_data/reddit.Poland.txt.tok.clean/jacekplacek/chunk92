  hmm ... black powder does n't have an oxidizer ? 
  so what is saltpeter doing in it ? 
  and why would n't air guns ( powered by co2 cartridges ) work ? 
  why would you need air in space for an air gun to work ? 
  i used to have an co2 powered air pistol . 
  all i needed to fire it was co2 cartridge ... if anything , it would give the pellet more speed , absent the air resistance ... 
  well , a cop for once does something useful and they send him to jail ... , 
   my understanding is that brandishing ( what you did ) is always illegal, 
  so , when you draw you ** have to ** shoot ... 
  that would be very strange law ... 
  actually , do n't take legal advice from strangers on reddit ... if you are considering calling the cops , call the ( good ) lawyer first . 
  hmmm ... 
  i wonder if they include the guns from the [ project gunwalker ] ( http://www.examiner.com/gun-rights-in-st-louis/project-gunwalker-another-angle-from-which-to-bring-pressure-to-bear?cid=parsely#parsely ) in their statistics ... 
  ... and matts2 wants to send all palestinians to the gas chambers ... 
   so i still get down votes for presenting relevant facts . 
  how is fda , abortion and constitution relevant to money sent to israel ? 
  how is it relevant to israel , again ? 
  tell me , grasshopper , if there really are `` natural '' monopolies , why do governments feel compelled to outlaw the competition for them ? 
   laws reflect enduring , sustained beliefs and values, 
  you sayin ' airport groping is an `` enduring , sustained belief and value '' ... ? 
   unless the majority of americans actually want the ability for the government to shut down the internet , it wo n't happen . 
  i guess the majority of americans really wanted to be groped at the airports ... they must have loved the patriot act ... they were just itching to give trillions of $ s to banksters ... / s, 
  and matts2 is getting paid to spread fud on reddit ... and if he does n't he is stupid , because he should . 
  still has absolutely no bearing on the topic at hand . 
  get it ? 
  iow , there 's no `` natural monopoly ? '', 
  ok , i 'm confused now ... how is `` gettin ' some of the towelhead killin ' shit '' related to airport groping ? 
  so , make up your mind , citizen ... either there 's a `` natural monopoly '' and government outlawing the competition is not needed , or it is needed because there 's no `` natural monopoly '' . 
  ca n't have it both ways , citizen . 
  still can not see how it 's related to the `` killin ' shit '' ... besides , it looks to me americans are quite unhappy with the groping ... 
   i was stunned at the void of understanding between us , the idea that i would take a gun and kill a human to save my daughter/wife/sister from rape and being strangled with her own pantyhose is unthinkable to me , but a basic human right to him . 
  ftfy, 
  yes , it did . 
  hardly anybody shoots tv thieves , shooting is most of the time reserved for would be rapist , murderers and similar scum ... 
   i have done my research , and this day and age is the best for most people in the history of mankind . 
  how does it relate to police brutality or government oppression ? 
  are you saying the more they oppress/brutalize us the better off we are ? 
  it 's irrelevant . 
  you are suggesting the police/government has something to do with our well being . 
  but yes , it 's much more widespread than it was in 1850s and affects everybody not just certain races/ethnicities ... can you imagine stagecoach `` security '' groping their passengers ? 
  people being jailed for smoking unapproved weed ? 
  children being taken from their parents if they refuse to drug them ? 
  what do you think would happen to the sheriff trying to apply `` civil forfeiture '' and steal the horse of the dude who just visited a certain lady ? 
  the list goes on and on , you just got so used to being screwed you do n't even need the vaseline any longer ... 
  sad . 
  the geeks no longer have any fucking clue about chemistry ... very sad . 
  as i said , you are so used to being screwed you think it 's normal ... 
  i bet you sheep think they have the best life evar too !, 
  the fleecing and occasional culling notwithstanding . 
  hey , btw , all the oppressed groups back then were simply treated as the `` laws of the land '' required ... so why do n't you tell them they were `` spoiled brats '' ... ? 
  `` you are a slave and you are required by law to pick cotton for your massah !, 
  stop bitching ! '', 
   is written by the principle, 
  what kind of the principle ? 
  or did you mean principal ... ? 
  no , grasshopper , it 's not an attack - just an observation . 
  i 'm simply trying to point it out to you that you are used to it . 
  how is that a `` personal attack ? '', 
  and there 's really not much of an argument you so far provided - other than `` look some countries with lots of gummint have it good , must be gummint 's doing ! '', 
  and `` it 's not an oppression if it 's the law ! '', 
  to really address this i would have to write a long dissertation and i have neither time nor patience for that . 
  that 's the ` concealment ' ... , 
  asked the moderator for it ... , 
   i fear that my child may be the one in the future who is having a hard time and chooses to indulge in escape instead of being the architect to a resolution, 
  iow , you suck as a parent and hope the police will do your parenting job for you ... 
   but a five year old knows that some cops are good . 
  ... and then he grows up ... 
  at least he 's got his priorities right ... , 
   i consider myself a pretty rational and calm person , but you sound like ** you 're begging for a baton by antagonizing ** an entire profession based on the bad apples . 
  wow ! ... 
  just wow !!, 
  how did our grandfathers ever survive without their papieren ... ?!, 
  esp with all the pesky 12 year olds riding their carriages and no way for the government officials to check how old they were and what were their names ... 
   a measured fucking logical response, 
  i know , ossifer , it 's a measured and logical response to whack someone over the head if they do n't respect your authoritah ... 
  but one of the lowest [ overall murder rates ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate ) ... 
  `` would you feel any better if they were thrown out of the window ? '', 
  dunno ... spartans did it . 
  ... unless you are sniping godzillas ... , 
   tablice in polish means `` tables '', 
  you are parsing it wrong . 
  ` tablice [ rejestracyjne ] ' also can mean ' [ license ] plates ' . 
  there 's an assumption here the database name is ` tablice ' ... 
  actually , it has very little to do with brains and almost everything to do with evolution . 
  in a successful invasion , women were more likely to be fucked ( or even incorporated into winning tribe ) than killed . 
  and get the stronger ( winner , remember ? ), 
  genes for their offsprings . 
  so for our genes it makes sense ... 
   how could you ever convince the majority to go along with you if you 're already advocating for violence ? 
  so , if the majority decides i qualify for the oven , i should just meekly go ?

   .50 cals that can shoot down planes, 
  actually , the guns could . 
  the shooters , though ... 
  if you could actually hit what you were aiming for it would n't be that hard . 
  there 's plenty of critical parts on the plane .50 ( or even 30-06 ) can destroy . 
  but there are no snipers who could accomplish that ... 
   dilorenzo , the congressman told the committee , had called lincoln `` the first dictator '', 
  well , he was : '' [ he vigorously exercised unprecedented war powers , including the arrest and detention , without trial , of thousands of suspected secessionists .
