  '' [ the war produced about 1,030,000 casualties , including about 620,000 soldier deaths -- two-thirds by disease .

  not `` mass '' enough for you ?

  surgical separation of an ass from the chair is painful ... 
   what a stubborn , useless politician !, 
  are there any other ones ... ? 
  ok , what am i missing ... ? 
  oh ... the inventory !, 
  yet, 
  there 's lots of geeks around , just not too many left-wing geeks ... and ( from my experience ) most are firearms owners ( even the pinkos ) and some are even hunters ... get used to it , this is not an area where `` reality has a liberal bias '' ... 
   anyways , i would vote for apes ( because of their bilogical similarity ) or dogs and cats ( because of their proximity to us ) as teh best candidates .

  is it also retarded when mafia 's kids lose their college funds ? 
   but these officers were doing their job, 
  `` vee vere just folloving ze orders '' does n't cut it anymore ... 
   they do n't know who 's in the car and what they may try to do,

  wait , you know the chinese are buying land in us ... you would have no problem if they start a new china here , would you . 
   it is so much easier to cry `` neocon '' without actually having to analyze what a commentator is saying , and their reasoning behind their analysis . 
  that would require some actual `` reasoning '' in horowitz 's rant ... 
  it should really say `` over 999 or under -99 '' ... 
  is n't that a give-away ... ? 
   for years , brawny paper towels and dixie cups have been staples in my household . 
  starting with my next shopping trip , those products will no longer be purchased . 
  the products i mentioned are part of the koch industries family of products . 
  thanks for letting me know . 
  these are the brands i will start buying now ... , 
  why not ? 
  but i tell you why - i 'm just fed-up with commie bastards morons ... 
   why are we boycotting them ? 
  because they have political views that do n't adhere to the r/politics hivemind ... 
  so , you find it preferable to be shot by a swat team ?

  sure there is a difference : in libya , the thug in charge is hanging on to the dear life , killing the people who want him gone , in waco the thugs in charge were killing the folks who just wanted to be left alone ... just because they could . 
   if a restaraunt next to the irs decided not to serve irs employees would we feel the same way ?

  being an auschwitz guard is a job .

  ftfy, 
   every tsa agent is a jack booted thug ? 
  let 's see :, 
  do they wear jackboots ? 
  check . 
  do they act like thugs ? 
  '' [ a common criminal , who treats others violently and roughly , often for hire ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thug ) '' check . 
  looks like a `` yes . '', 
  are you saying most tsa agents never `` treat others violently and roughly ? '', 
  and , yes . 
  if most of them are acting like thugs , it 's justified to call all of them thugs . 
  i 'm pretty sure there were some stasi dudes who were nice and non violent ... 
  for the same reason ptolemy is being thought to students ...

   do your children attend public school ? 
  that 's supposed to be paid by property taxes . 
   do you use the library ? 
  nope . 
  if i did , i 'd rather pay for it myself . 
   do police respond to your neighborhood when you call them ? 
  i never call the police and i would be ecstatic if they never showed up in my hood ... 
   do you drive on roads ? 
  that 's supposed to be covered by the gas taxes/dmv fees ... 
  back in the early 20th century us was the most prosperous nation on earth , small government and no income tax being the main reason ... 
  why do you call it a `` forfeiture abuse ? '', 
  when burglars discuss how much they can carry out of your house , would you call it a `` burglary abuse ? '', 
   if there were no possibility of police showing up in your neighborhood , i can guarantee that there 'd be reason for you to want them to . 
  you are wrong . 
   and you seriously believe that gas taxes and dmv fees are high enough to pay for our road system ? 
  if they are not , make them . 
  i do n't think anybody would object to raise in gas taxes if they got rid of income tax . 
   and what about things like u.s. mail that do n't turn a profit so that they can be available to everyone ? 
  how come ups and fedex can turn a profit but usps can not ? 
  and they somehow are available to everyone ... 
   also , if you want it to be taken seriously , you should give a source or some kind of background for your last sentence . 
  because as it stands , i see at least three assertions in it that are completely unsupported . 
  not sure what you have problem with . 
  us being most prosperous nation or lack of income tax and hordes of parasites having anything to do with it ? 
   you are going to have to be a bit more specific on what you mean by early 20th century as the 16th amendment was ratified in 1913 , leaving you a paltry 2-3 years where there was no income tax in the 20th century . 
  hmm ... from 1901 to 1913 makes 2-3 years ? 
  do n't forget before wwi the tax affected only very small number of the really wealthy ... 
   not to mention that we were n't exactly the most prosperous nation in the world for a good chunk of the `` early '' 20th century and the only reason we did see a boom was because the rest of the industrialized world was still recovering from the trauma of wwi and wwii .
