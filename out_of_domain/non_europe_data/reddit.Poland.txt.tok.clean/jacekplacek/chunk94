  [ not really ... ] ( http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/eco_gdp_per_cap_in_190-economy-gdp-per-capita-1900 ), 
  i 've never personally met a nazi that killed someone ... 
  i 'm just pointing out your double standards ... 
   how can you attack leninists for doing things that anarchists usually helped them do ? 
  yeah , people die in war . 
  it 's a pity , but that 's war . 
  i do n't think anybody blames them for what they did in the war ... 
   well , i ca n't argue with that . 
  you must really enjoy constructive debates . 
  pardon me , but i 'm pretty sure on the topic of `` what would i do in certain situation '' i consider myself more competent than anyone else ... 
   let me know when the cops disappear and i 'll show up for your tv . 
  be my guest . 
  i promise i will not call the cops . 
   you 've changed from `` that 's supposed to be covered by gas taxes and dmv fees '' to `` here are some policy recommendations . '', 
  two very different things . 
  not quite . 
  it is ** supposed to ** be covered by gas taxes . 
  if you think it 's not ( which you failed to substantiate ) i simply suggested possible means of rectification ... 
   have you ever tried sending a fedex package to somewhere in bumfuck , wyoming or something ? 
  yup . 
  i do n't really recall if i paid much more than usual , i 'm pretty sure it did n't bankrupt me . 
   i 'm going to ignore the `` hordes of parasites '' comment because any amateur historian knows that u.s. immigration levels have stayed relatively constant as a percentage of the u.s. population for the last 120 years . 
  i never said anything about immigration . 
   you originally said back in the 20th century the u.s. was the most prosperous nation on earth . 
  we still are . 
  [ not anymore ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gni_%28nominal,_atlas_method%29_per_capita ) . 
  add to it a simple fact that we are technically bankrupt ... 
  but the point being , even the most rabid statists never claim high taxes and huge government _ per se _ are making nations prosperous . 
  the best they can say is `` that 's the price of being prosperous . '', 
  here you have the country that in a little bit over 100 years changed from bunch of backwards colonies to the most prosperous nation on earth ** without ** the `` benefits '' of huge government ( that 's the parasites i was talking about ) and high taxes . 
  and the onus of proving that robbing productive people of some of fruits of their labor can increase prosperity is on you . 
  that was n't an example ... that was fantasy . 
  because if she went to court , thanks to erisa laws , the most she could hope for was attorney 's fees ... 
  i will try to make it , but it 's 25 % ... 
  do n't you know owls are cute and bats are ugly ... ? 
  the duck seemed to survive ... 
  i bet you it makes quite a difference from its point of view . 
   do n't be a wuss , just die !, 
  after you ... 
  if you see this happening you need to take it easier on what you smoke ... 
   if there 's one idea of dijkstra i feel is just full of shit , it 's that learning something new can permanently poison the human mind . 
  brains are pretty plastic . 
  nevertheless , people very often have a tendency to `` think '' in the language they learned first . 
  i have run into many programmers who started with vb and developed habits that make their code shitty no matter what language they are using . 
  is n't it possible he really did change his mind ... ? 
   also , you might be more specific than `` not really ... '', 
  click on `` not really ... '' . 
   capitalism rests on several key ideas regarding human motivation and development that fly in the face of much of western psychology . 
  here i will focus on two of these : that people are primarily self-interested and that the acquisition of material wealth is the key to happiness . 
  says who ? 
  he said `` talks passionately '' not `` passionately defends '' ... 
   meanwhile most political offices are up for grabs every two years . 
  but the laws/taxes/regulations they pass are not ... 
   real libertarians should n't tolerate this anti-kgb kind of bullshit . 
  let alone endorse it, 
  ftfy, 
  soviet union ? 
  i guess his point was : `` if you firmly believe in your rights , you grab them , if you have doubts you talk about them ... '', 
   government : roads open to the public, 
  step 1 : roads open to the public . 
  step 2 : hey , we pay for the roads , you need our permit to drive !, 
  step 3 : you need our permit to drive even on the roads we do n't pay for . 
  driving is a privilege !, 
  step 4 : we can prohibit you from driving whenever we feel like it !, 
   government : open net, 
  that 's step 1 . 
  guess the rest ... 
   you just completely made up step 3 and 4 . 
  [ is that so ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/private_highways_in_the_united_states ), 
  will you prove your point by driving on one of those private roads without drivers license/registration ? 
  ( step 3 ) or what about refusing bac test or not paying child support ? 
  ( step 4 ), 
   you ignore how much roads would completely suck if they were controlling by private corporations, 
  tell us how the ** private ** roads from the link above suck ... 
  the people that say `` money is the root of all evil '' are , unavoidably , the very ones who want to take some of yours ... 
  why do you care ? 
  baaaa ... 
   the mortality rate among those struck by falling bullets is about 32 % , compared with about 2 % to 6 % normally associated with gunshot wounds . 
  [ 5 ] the higher mortality is related to the higher incidence of head wounds from falling bullets . 
  and, 
   in the u.s. commonwealth of puerto rico , about two people die and about 25 more are injured each year from celebratory gunfire on new year 's eve , the cdc says, 
  hmmm ... someone has their math all screwed up . 
  that was stalin ... 
  so , what would you have him to do ? 
  since the system we live in is what it is , he pretty much has three options : keep the money to himself , give to charities or give to the government . 
  from what you ( and other , self professed , `` anarchists '' ) wrote , you 'd rather have him give the money to the government and let the government `` make those decisions of vast importance '' . 
  strange sentiment for `` anarchists '' ... 
   again , i 'd rather trust a publicly elected official whose job is to protect and serve , than a company whose job is to make money . 
  you would ? 
  let 's see : the `` publicly elected official 's '' interest lies in getting reelected . 
  baring that , ( s ) he wants ( as most everybody else ) make a good living , perhaps be in the spotlight , perhaps have ( more ) power ... unless ( s ) he is a saint . 
  even if you could manage to elect only saints , they would have to be omniscient to make `` right '' decisions . 
  not to mention , the electorate would have to be omniscient to recognize those decisions as the `` right '' ones ... 
  otoh , the `` company whose job is to make money '' can only do it one way : make sure their customers are happy . 
  if they fail at that , they will lose to the other companies ... 
  i know . 
  should ( in your opinion ) leno give `` cold '' interviews to people you do n't like ? 
  should he know all possible quotes from all possible historical figures ? 
  this brings interesting point : mere possibility of homeowner having a gun protected him from a criminal .
