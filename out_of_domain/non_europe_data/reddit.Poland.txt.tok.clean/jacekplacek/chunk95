  if this was uk , and homeowner was old/infirm/small , the possible outcome would be at best burglar running out and not being apprehended and at worst burglar clobbering the homeowner to death ... 
  he offered them an honest job ? 
  you are doing it wrong ... 
  king is an asshole and an idiot ... does n't mean the assholes from splc , and esp . 
  potok , have any credibility on anything whatsoever . 
  wtf the mainstream media are talking to those douchebags ? 
  depends where do you live ... 
  8 grown men rape an 14 year old girl and then murder her and her family ... [ guess the race ? 
  ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/10/18/iraq/main2102943.shtml ), 
   i would rather he first of all undo the evil he does in order to make these money, 
  he should undo windoze and office ? 
   put what is left into supporting anarchistic solutions , such as buying out factories and gifting them to their workers , or support union struggle, 
  iow , he should give to charities ** you ** like ... 
   buying out factories and gifting them to their workers, 
  you are assuming workers would want that ... or would you force it on them ? 
   open sourcing them would be a good first step . 
  you are aware he can not do that , are n't you . 
   this is not charity, 
  [ legal dictionary ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/charity ), 
   main entry : char \u00b7 i \u00b7 ty, 
   inflected form : plural - ties, 
   : a gift for humanitarian , philanthropic , or other purposes beneficial  to the public ( as maintaining a public building ) ;, 
   there 's a lot of workers who want that . 
  there 's lot of workers who have enough savings to be able to chip in and buy a factory ... somehow they do n't do that . 
  why would that be ? 
   and lets not mention stuff that have lead in them . 
  the stuff i buy most often at wm is ammo . 
  i certainly ** want ** it to have lead ... , 
  hmm ... let 's see : i was broke , so heavily in debt i could n't possibly cover payments with my income . 
  but i did have a 401k !, 
  so i borrowed from my 401k to pay off part of the credit cards debt . 
  are you seriously suggesting my 401k is in the same shape it was before ? 
  am i not broke anymore ? 
  the question is : does it provide any benefits over the currently available ones ? 
  if not , there 's no reason for people to pay the price if they still can get the old one . 
  if yes , patients ( with the doctors ' guidance ) should be the ones to decide if it 's worth the price ... 
  so , how did this dude know the runner was n't running for his life from some crazy ... ? 
  there must be some lebanese smugglers bringing them in ... , 
  oh , i missed that ... shows how `` beneficial '' fda really is , if anybody still have doubts . 
  but if the drug is approved , should n't generic pharma companies be able to produce it ? 
  if it 's an existing drug there should be no patent issues ... 
  ... but they should get all the credit for [ screwing ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/wtf/comments/g0rtt/price_of_drug_to_prevent_preemies_jumps_from_20/ ) the patients ... 
   a primary example of such a cartel is opec which has a profound influence on the international price of oil, 
  ... and they very quickly realized back in the 70s they can not possibly keep gouging the market , it ( the market ) just refuses to work that way ... 
   i challenge you to name even one example, 
   then this will lower , not raise , prices . 
  correct . 
  they were practically a monopolist because they were able to produce aluminum cheaper than anybody else . 
   who are you defending here, 
  leno 's right to pick whom he has on his show and how he treats them ... 
  methinks you are confusing her with naomi wolf ... 
  what does mises.org have to do with it ? 
  he seems to be missing points all over the place ... , 
  i think you are being a troll ... 
   personal freedom , market freedom , and democratic control over one 's society, 
  that seems to be a contradiction . 
  you can not control a society without controlling society 's members . 
  ergo , no personal freedom . 
  the public mind might have some other funny ideas . 
  like `` negros should not be allowed to marry whites '' ferinstance ... 
  like what ? 
  unbiased ? 
  may i have some of what you are smoking ? 
  can you prove it ? 
   can you prove that i am not god, 
  define god and i 'll give it a try . 
   so i must be god then right, 
  nope . 
  it simply means i can not unequivocally say you are not . 
  materially , perhaps not . 
  ideologically ? 
  you tell me ... 
   an american liberal is just a communist who lacks the courage of their convictions to admit in public that they think stalin , mao and pol-pot were great heroes . 
  ftfy, 
  so , let me get it right : if something is not `` vetted and tested and approved '' it 's fake shit . 
  once it gets `` vetted and tested and approved '' it becomes medicine ? 
  seems like according to you , progesterone was shit when it was priced at $ 10.00 ( it was not `` vetted and tested and approved '' ) but now , when it 's `` vetted and tested and approved '' it 's become medicine ... no wonder it costs now $ 1500.00 that 's the difference between `` shit '' and `` medicine '' ... / s, 
   there are hundreds of times a year at least in which the fda stops a drug from going to market because producer did n't bribe the right people . 
  ftfy, 
  that 's what it sounded like to me . 
  if you meant something else , you should phrase it differently ... 
  since there already were pharmacies preparing and selling the drug , how is giving it an orphan status even possible ? 
   obviously no other company was interested in providing, 
  there were many pharmacies that ** were ** providing it ... 
   and subsequently withdrawn, 
  at least in the case of vioxx , withdrawn by the producer , not fda ... but wait !, 
  do n't the pharma companies plan to poison everybody and only the valiant fda agents stand between them and the hapless public ? 
  and you are so dumb as to buy stuff you know shit about from the company you know shit about when you get sick ? 
  someone should give you something that would make sure you can never procreate ... 
  fda is capitalism ? 
  you know it 's a hormone produced by woman 's body ? 
  i guess fda should require extensive trials before allowing women to produce it !, 
  i hope you did n't have to pay for your school or you should demand your money back . 
  you asserted that everything falls into two categories : medicine and shit . 
  you 've also established the simple function from the set of everything into those two categories . 
  the function being : f ( x ) = if ( is_vetted_tested_and_approved ( x ) ) then medicine else shit . 
  now if you apply your function to the progesterone , you get ` shit ' before `` vetting , testing and approving '' and ` medicine ' after . 
  it 's as simple as that . 
  generalizations are useful because they allow you to make a statement about a set of objects without having to enumerate every one of them . 
   i 'd pay to see that,
