  when your country is dead broke , you should decorate the lampposts with those who are responsible : politicians, 
   is n't this the point of having a bill of rights and a judicial system to protect those rights ?

  judges are paid by the government . 
  they are supposed to protect people from the same government that pays their salaries ... 
  american tourists ? 
  that was a joke , if you wonder ... 
  ... for some small values of `` all the time '' ... 
   this would erode their support, 
  they do n't have any support anyway . 
  they do those stints just to get the chance to sue somebody ... 
  i think you confused history with propaganda ... 
   when the herbivores strip all the natural foilage there is a rapid drop off in the number of live herbivores . 
  you mean is better for giraffes to starve than being culled by human hunters ? 
  so , you should have no problem pointing out the specific case of 4 accountants ( or software dudes , or housewives ) ganging up on some dude and shooting him [ 41 times ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/26/nyregion/diallo-verdict-overview-4-officers-diallo-shooting-are-acquitted-all-charges.html ) ... you will get extra points if they got acquitted .

   if a person with abundant wealth allows a poor person to die when they could have prevented it , then it is immoral -- especially when so much of a person 's economic opportunity is defined by birth and not by choice . 
  does it mean you spend all your money to help starving children in third world countries ? 
  if not , according to your sentiments , you are immoral ... 
  know what , leftards were much more courageous back in 1930ies - when there was a civil war in spain they actually went there themselves ... now they just urge government to send other people to fight ...

   whitespace-based scoping, 
  that 's the most horrible and idiotic `` feature '' of python ... white space has no fucking business being significant . 
  how would you feel if the placing of line breaks changed the meaning of the english text ? 
  amen . 
  and that 's from unabashed pig-hater ... 
   line breaks are significant in any number of english contexts like poetry , signage , and menus . 
  in poetry , it does change the aesthetics/looks/style of the poem , does n't change the meaning ... and if you mean ui menus , how is meaning of,

   you will discover that constantly having to enter curly braces and semicolons is what 's idiotic . 
  if you believe typing curly brace or semicolon is more difficult than typing spaces , line breaks or tabs , you need to work on your typing skills ... 
   compilers can/should be able to reliably determine scope and ends of statements without the human having to use explicit tokens to do this except in the rarest of cases . 
  while whitespace is effectively such a token , it is much more natural insofar as it causes the programmer to reflect the logical structure of the code in its physical expression . 
  you will soon learn that code is not for the benefit of the compiler ... wait till you have to troubleshoot some code in emergency situation , when you have no access to ide/syntax aware editor and the code in question is e-mailed to you :, 
  `` is the line break here an artifact of the e-mail client or is it supposed to be significant ? 
  did e-mail client ( or the only editor you have access at the time ) strip the leading white space or is that how it was formatted in the first place ? '', 
  significant white space might force lazy/inexperienced programmers to make the code formatted for readability , but if it 's formatting style is different from what your preferred style is , it just gets in the way . 
   suggests that you never done much serious programming, 
  no comment . 
  other than you should n't make unwarranted assumptions about people you know nothing of . 
   i do not in fact have abundant wealth, 
  oh yes , you do !, 
  comparing to the majority of human beings you are filthy rich ...

  you missed the point ... of course they would not budge on that , but they could panic and forget what they wanted to push through ...  the bigest problem of nra always is : they are coming to the table with a proposal to keep the status quo , the other side pushes for the far-reaching gun control and they compromise somewhere in the middle . 
  meaning gun grabbers win .

  commenting on reddit does n't fix anything either , still you do it anyway ...

   wishes to res [ t ] rict the freedoms of a group of people, 
  the whole `` gay rights '' thingie is pretty confusing to me . 
  what exactly are `` gay rights '' and how do they differ from ordinal rights ? 
  do you have to be gay to have gay rights ? 
  does it mean gays have more rights than straights ? 
   the study of economics rests on the basic assumption that all of human behavior is dictated entirely by the self-interested pursuit of externally-measurable `` utility maximization '', 
  the economics schools that assume that should , indeed , be dismissed entirely ... 
  there are , though , economists who do n't make any such silly assumptions . 
  would your empathy extended to the gangsta beating up someone to assert his territory ?

  so , why do you call it `` gay rights '' instead of `` human rights ? '', 
  iow those are human rights . 
  why call them `` gay rights ? '',

  that 's something cops need to learn , the hard way ...

   if you still think the spaceshiptwo might be extended into orbital operation, 
  sure can not . 
  and wright flier ii could n't be `` extended '' into transatlantic operation either . 
   you could apply that kind of scaling to the spaceshiptwo and make it go a bit higher , but you simply ca n't make a derivative design that will orbit the earth .
