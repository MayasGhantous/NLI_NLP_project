   i know the yakuza has tens of thousands of decisions and things to do everyday but let 's focus on 4 things that are similar to the mara salvatrucha . 
  ftfy, 
  what 's the freedom festival ? 
   `` and how we burned in the camps later , thinking : what would things have been like if every security operative , when he went out at night to make an arrest , had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say good-bye to his family ? 
  or if , during periods of mass arrests , as for example in leningrad , when they arrested a quarter of the entire city , people had not simply sat there in their lairs , paling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase , but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes , hammers , pokers , or whatever else was at hand ? ... 
  the organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and , notwithstanding all of stalin 's thirst , the cursed machine would have ground to a halt !, 
  if ... if ... we did n't love freedom enough . 
  and even more -- we had no awareness of the real situation ... we purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterward . '', 
  thanks . 
   the holographic principle says that all space and time contained within an n dimensional body is emergent and can be described by a completely separate set of physics on the n-1 dimensional surface of the body . 
  so , by induction , all space and time contained within an n dimensional body can be described by a completely separate set of non-dimensional physics ? 
  all the information in the n-dimensional space can be contained in a single point ? 
  let 's see ... 
  suppose the congress voted every year to castrate all the male babies born on valentine day and all the congresscritters added an exemption for their districts . 
  suppose there was one single dissenting vote every year . 
  do you thing the dissenter should n't add the exemption for his district ? 
  some peculiar logic you 've got there ... 
   ~ 60 % of the country that 's `` progressive , '',

   i 'll be paying my taxes this year by check ... 
  i always do . 
  and i staple all the forms and the check together ... at least they have do ** some ** work for the money they 're stealing from me ... 
   are you allowed to have physical interactions with them ? 
  who would be allowed to disallow it ? 
  meh , he 's lucky to get extinct before we got here , would get his ass handed to him in no time ... 
  so , if i 'm a citizen of non-signatory country , they can pretty much blow me ... ? 
   the two languages you described exist on two separate continents separated by about five thousand miles of ocean .

   ( consider the fact that most steels lose half it 's strength when heated above 100c ), 
  you are either an idiot or a very [ bad shill ] ( http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/metal-temperature-strength-d_1353.html ) ... 
  oh , for the fuck 's sake , nist itself in their report ( and i mean the actual report the people signed with their names , not the fucking anonymous comments afterwords ) could only show that , with overstretched parameters , only the worst case scenario of those considered ( that means everything that could go wrong , did in the worst possible way ) could ** initiate ** the collapse . 
  that 's actually far from showing that the collapse itself would happen the way it did . 
  now , you want us to believe the very improbable collapse happened not once but twice , and the manner of the collapse itself was pretty much defying physics . 
  when you damage the structure to the point of collapse , it will fall towards the path of the least resistance . 
  that means , unless the damage is exactly symmetrical in all directions , it will fall asymmetrically . 
  that 's why the controlled demolition requires much skill and precision - it 's purpose is to make sure the structure 's support is removed ** symmetrically ** at once , to avoid asymmetrical collapse . 
  that 's why all the other recorded buildings ' collapses ( even some controlled demolitions ) were always dramatically different from wtc collapses .

   now do n't you think its hyperbolic to proclaim that the ' global scientific community is as corrupt as government . ', 
  no more hyperbolic than `` overwhelming consensus from the global scientific community and accessible facts are freely available . '', 
  `` all things are poison , and nothing is without poison ; only the dose permits something not to be poisonous . '', 
  i can not figure out if you are willfully deceitful or simply ignorant . 
  let 's suppose the murphy and allah conspired to bring about the initiation of collapse as per nist worst case . 
  at this point we have three sections of the building : the structurally sound top floors , the damaged vicinity of the crash and still structurally sound bottom floors . 
  since , as you seem to grasp , the damage was not symmetrical , the most damaged corner of the building is supposed to give first . 
  as the elementary physics shows , the forces of gravity would find not enough resistance at that corner and the top of the building would start leaning towards this corner . 
  as the center of gravity of the top section shifts , the damaged corner would be subjected to even more force , while the opposite one to less . 
  the top of the building would start gaining even more momentum and would simply topple over , certainly damaging floors below ** at the affected corner ** . 
  the entire building might or might not collapse but it would not collapse the way wtc towers did ( baring other , intervening forces . ), 
  and , incidentally , one of the towers ** started ** collapsing exactly that way . 
  if you watch the video you can see it happening ... and then something does intervene . 
  if you look closely at the antenna , you will see it ** straightening up ** as if something started to pull on it from below . 
  the only explanation for that phenomenon i can think of is cutting in timely fashion the load bearing central column ( s ) at the base ( or close to it ) of the tower . 
  no longer being supported at the bottom the steel columns would certainly be able to shift the center of gravity back . 
  but perhaps you have alternative explanation . 
  btw `` big buildings are different than small ones '' is ** not ** an explanation ... 
  sure , even galileo had to submit to the `` peer review '' ... when it suits peers they will review only what they consider non-threatening to their carriers . 
   jet fuel normally burns much lower in controlled environments but with enough oxygen it can burn at temperatures up to 1000 c. 
  only in an oxygen enriched atmosphere or with forcing the oxygen as in burners ... 
  it 's pretty obvious , apart of the initial short blast , the fires were oxygen-starved ... 
   i 'm sure your not employed,

   here we go with the usual libertarian theatrics . 
  everything is `` at gunpoint . '', 
  do you also believe mafia collecting `` protection fees '' is not really doing it at gunpoint ? 
  after all the guns are very rarely drawn ... 
  can you decide what your argument is . 
  first you are bitching about libertarians pointing out the taxation is `` at gunpoint '' and now you are changing your tune to `` but it 's for the childrun '' ... 
   well no wonder you 're confused . 
  i never said anything about children . 
  look it up . 
  i could say `` divine rights of the kings '' or some such equally meaningless bullshit instead . 
  ( like your `` accountable '' or `` checks and balances '' ... ), 
  all those are supposed to impress the gullible and make them forget the essence of the matter : it ** is ** at gunpoint ... 
  it is no different than the mafia or the street corner mugger . 
   i do n't think it 's ethical to allow people with impaired perception and/or decision making affect the lives of the sober ones , in any way , shape , or form . 
  and who decides what `` impaired '' means ? 
  i can say you just demonstrated your `` impaired perception and/or decision making , '' should i be justified in asking for your separation from society ? 
   there are legitimate and well-founded reasons for opposing witchcraft, 
  ftfy, 
   in the case of drug and alcohol effects , this is rather easy . 
  actually , it 's far from being easy . 
  there are ( illegal ) drugs that actually improve perception or decision making , even alcohol in low doses can do that . 
  on top of that , people have different level of tolerance to different substances . 
   i did n't say mention remotely related to posterity . 
  well , the above sentence appears to be just random string of words . 
  i can only guess you mean you did n't actually use the word ` children '' ... 
  [ `` for the children '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/children%27s_interests ) ( sometimes deliberately misspelled ) is a phrase often mockingly used to expose argument meant to evade addressing the real issue . 
  i used it exactly for that reason . 
   the system of checks and balances within our government is concrete and verifiable . 
  do you people develop special techniques to keep yourselves happily clueless , or does it come naturally ... ? 
   expecting people not to abuse legalized drugs is beyond retarded, 
  and expecting state agents not to abuse their power is not ? 
  btw : if your metric is impairment , what would you do about people being impaired because of tiredness , depression or sickness ? 
  lock them up too ? 
  just because that syllogism is incorrect , does n't mean tsa assholes are not evil bastards ... 
  is that a porn flick ?
