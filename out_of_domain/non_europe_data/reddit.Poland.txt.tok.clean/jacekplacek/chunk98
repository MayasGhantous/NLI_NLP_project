  trockyism and neo-conservatism are surprisingly very similar ideologies ( _ sans _ the economics part . ), 
   indeed . 
  the only real abolitionist heroes are fictional , because abolitionism is just an anarchic utopian philosophy that has no application in the real world and no chance of every producing a functional society .

   i 'm unaware of any instances of a police department executing a warzone veteran like this before , so i ca n't point to any examples .

  their internationalist-evangelism is very similar to trotsky 's . 
  obviously , they substituted `` democracy '' for `` communism '' as an ideal to spread . 
  they had similar mindsets - belief that the `` right way '' is a `` permanent revolution '' and were hell bent on delivering it to the world . 
  iow foreign relations were for them just the means to achieve the end , namely the one world government ( or at the least the same system - under their guidance , of course , 
  another thing - while propagandizing about the superiority of proletariat in trotskyists case and generic `` people '' for neocons , both movements practiced `` intelectual elitism '' with the avant garde elites driving the masses .

   a nuclear weapon serves no purpose other than to destroy and coerce -- what other possible uses can you think of ? 
  how would you go about this `` coercing '' of yours ? 
  who would you want to coerce to do what ? 
  it can be a great `` coercer '' against government ( hey , you pay ransom/get out of middle east/stop meddling with my country or i blow up your capitol ! ),
