  but who else can you coerce with it ? 
  suppose you are a religious fanatic and want the people of ohio valley to convert to your faith . 
  you broadcast your demands and threaten them with blowing up one of the big cities . 
  now what ? 
  there 's no one in authority to force people to convert . 
  there 's no way for you to check who did/did not convert . 
  and if some percentage did convert but some did not what do you do ? 
  and what will people of ohio valley do ? 
  some will perhaps convert . 
  others will move out . 
  others yet , will try to find you out and inflict lead poisoning on you . 
  what can you really achieve ? 
  so , the only way you can use it is to just blow some place up . 
  perhaps you have a grudge ... but against whom ? 
  ohio valleyans ? 
   the warsaw ghetto was four square kilometers . 
  by april 1942 half a million people lived there , which means its population density was approximately 30 times greater than that of the gaza strip . 
  so , if only the warsaw ghetto was bigger , you would n't have any problems with it ? 
   increasing speed also means inceasing braking distance , disproportionately . 
  because of this the distance between cars has to increase so much -- as the speed is increased -- that the number of cars passing per time unit actually decreases . 
  oh , so there 's an obvious solution : lower the speed limit to 5 mph ... distance can be thus reduced to 0 so the number of cars passing per time unit would be maximized ... ? 
  iow , you have your rights until your neighbor calls the cops on you ? 
   only person in that room that would n't have been armed was the government contractor . 
  [ ... ] the problem is that because they were on a base which is supposed to be secure , the weapons were n't loaded . 
  if your weapon is not loaded , you are ** not ** armed ... just saying . 
   if you can safely go 5 mph at 1.5 car lengths each ( including the car itself ), 
  since the bumpers are designed to withstand the 5mph impact , you can go bumper-to-bumper safely at 5mph ... 
  he did . 
  only mr. bear . 
  kinda funny that one of the main criticism of the `` atlas shrugged '' movie was future based on trains ... buffet the randroid ? 
   move the fuck out of that bad neighborhood, 
  is there a neighborhood without police ? 
   this is what they need to learn : if they raid the wrong house illegally , then they might get fucking shot . 
  they know that . 
  that 's why they use swat teams all the time ... 
   police are not going to barge into your house for no reason . 
  yes , virginia , there is a santa claus ... 
  unlike sen. kerry ... / s, 
   when it comes to downsizing the state , most conservatives and libertarians have a raging hard-on for privatization , by which they mean the government auctioning off taxpayer property to the highest private bidder . 
  [ _ citation needed _ ], 
  oh , i see ... naomi klein sayz so it must be true ... / s, 
  lol , that 's not how citations are supposed to work ... 
  i could find you plenty of citations claiming obama is a muslim and was born in kenya ... somehow , i would n't be surprised if you did n't put much credence in them . 
  well , i have yet to meet a libertarian who has `` hard on '' for tax funded `` privatization '' ... when libertarians say privatization they mean it . 
  oh , and btw : the `` taxpayer property '' is not what the dude thinks it is . 
  the stuff that government stole from taxpayers is no longer `` taxpayer property '' ... 
  well , most libertarians do n't really care ** how ** the state is being divested of its holding . 
  as long as it is . 
  i suspect not many would object to the dude 's proposal to `` give it back to the people . '', 
  the goal is to strip the state of its power and assets and that 's what libertarians like about it . 
  obviously , if the company that bought the infrastructure keeps having a monopoly , there 's not much net freedom gain . 
  but that 's quite a different story ... 
  edit : damned apostrophes ... , 
  yup , i got that . 
  not gon na do it - hate the statist bitch ... 
   there is plenty to learn from many diverse sources . 
  sure . 
  and i do n't mind hearing out people who have something interesting to say . 
  even if it 's contrary to my opinions . 
  what i heard from klein , she is pretty shallow and not very bright ... 
  you should ask him to give you all his belongings - he 's not gon na need them anymore ... , 
  non-smokers die healthier . 
  you might be better off buying a slingshot ... 
  you forgot humans were `` invasive specie '' once ... 
   differences between a government and a normal citizen, 
  i know , government people are more equal ... 
  the world will , reddit will survive the apocalypse for another year ... 
  ... which balances out all the stupid/evil things monks ever did !, 
   private property is necessarily hierarchical, 
  there 's nothing hierarchical about what i have ... collectives , on the other hand , are necessarily hierarchical , if not always formally . 
   always present the police in a good light, 
  if ** that ** is a good light , i shudder to think how would bad light look like ... 
  i am a capitalist ? 
  awesome , now where the hell is my capital ? 
  btw : how do you think would non-hierarchical collective work ? 
  can you give an example ( even hypothetical ? ), 
   is your group of friends hierarchical ? 
  you have a too dogmatic view of hierarchy ... there 's nothing wrong with hierarchy when it is voluntary . 
  and to answer your question , depends . 
  sometimes no , sometimes yes . 
  when i go with my friends on the boat , the one that is the most competent is in charge and we all honor that . 
  when we play soccer , there 's a captain ... 
  it 's a blog post for chrissake ... dude sure is pissed and he 's got every reason to be . 
  all are assholes . 
   to be fair , you 're not the author of the comment, 
  to be fair you do n't know that ... 
   blanket generalization based in no way on reality, 
  [ yes way ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stanford_prison_experiment ), 
  dude was paid by the line of code ... 
   driving is a privilege, 
  when did it become a `` privilege ? '', 
  is riding a horse a privilege ? 
  how about the horse drawn carriage ? 
  why does it become a `` privilege '' when you replace a horse with an engine ? 
  same logic could be used to disallow any self-defense ... `` do n't resist the rapist , sue him afterwards ! '', 
  you seem to be confusing different experiments ... read the fucking link before yo say something stupid . 
  `` they '' changed the law ? 
  who did ? 
  can you name the law that says driving is a `` privilege ? '', 
  did you , by any chance , notice you have n't answered any of my questions ?
