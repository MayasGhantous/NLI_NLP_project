the south of poland is actually quite mountainious ( tatra 's , beskids ), 
  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/poland_topo.jpg . 
  these infantry man are stationed at zakopane , just south of krakow, 
  yeah , just discovered this sub . 
  i 've been trying to collect as many pictures of the polish army for a while and i thought i would share some of the best with you guys :p . until now they seem to be verry appreciated . 
  sorry for the bad english, 
  usually at the `` belly '' of the plane , but they are seperate modules that can be placed almost anywhere really . 
  here 's a link to the wiki page of the cichociemni , one of the world 's first special forces units, 
  specialised soldiers have , indeed , always existed , but i 'm am talking about modern age special forces as we know today . 
  the first of this kind where began forming in ww2, 
  it was created with the help of the uk and in coorperation with british sf but they where under command of the polish government in exile and where specifically set up to be used only in poland . 
  yeah , you i see how this statement can have quite a big effect i will be more cautious with statements like that in the feature , thanks , 
  if i 'm not mistaking this photograph was taking at a military parade in august of 2007 , they wear standard polish uniforms but the rogatiwka ( hat ) is replaced by a traditional polish higlanders hat and the ` cape ' also derives from traditional higlanders clothing . 
  it 's the badge of the polish 303 squadron that served with the raf during ww2 . 
  it was the squadron with the most kills during the battle of britain . 
  this plane was part of a airshow in the badges and potraits of ww2 fighter pilots where painted on the planes .

  '' ** one ** of the world 's first special forces units '' , 
  i 'm not sure , but i think it is, 
  this is a special military church in the center of warsaw , i 've vissited it last summer and the church is full with dozens of banners , memorial stones and even has it 's own military museum underneath . 
  the church has always been important in polish society , so seeing ` specialized ' churches like these is quite common , especially the military ones . 
  the name of the church is : katedra polowa wojska polskiego ( field cathedral of the polish army ) and it 's situated right in front of a verry big memorial for the warsaw uprising . 
  here 's the wiki page : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/field_cathedral_of_the_polish_army , 
  poland actually has quite a capable force , it 's just many foreigners have bad prejudices about poland being a grey , poor province of russia . 
  i live in the netherlands and although most people see the dutch as smart , most do n't even know where poland is on the map : / history is something that heavily influences the manner of thinking in poland , and because of the many wars in poland 's history the army is verry important . 
  poland has been one of the only countries in the west to spent * more * on their military in recent years . 
  esspecially with russia , the eternal enemy of poland , having a large army stationed in kalingrad and now invading ukraine . 
  in about four years the modernization of the army should be completed and by that time the polish army should be one of the most modern and capable forces in europe with weapons like the new msbs rifle , pl-01 tank and the new anti-rocket shield ` shield of poland ' . 
  these girls go to a special class in which they get military training besides regular lessons . 
  they are called ` klasa mundurowa ' , ` uniform classes ' . 
  some high schools offer such classes for students who are thinking of a carreer in the military or who are just interested in the military and are willing to attend the extra lessons that come with these classes . 
  no , since 2004 poland has a professional army . 
  you can read my comment above about the backstory of this photo . 
  there are many options in poland to get involved in the military without actually having a military carreer . 
  examples are these ` klasa mundurowa ' , the ` strzelcow ' , which is a military organisation for youths , and of course the military reserve . 
  the name is just a polish translation , but polish godzdzik 's have had some serious upgrades . 
  you could consider them like a different model when compared to those still in use by the russian or ukrainian army 's because of the extensive upgrades . 
  they will eventually be phased out and be replaced with the new polish ` krab ' self-propelled howitzer , but this will not happen for at least the next 5 years . 
  what do you mean by ` look like that ' ? 
  to me they do n't seem verry different like the berets of other army 's :p, 
  they indeed did , there are many stories what the function of these wings was , they probably had many . 
  examples are : intimidate the enemy , making the husar harder to catch with laso 's that where in heavy use by the tartars , lifting up spirits of other troops and just looking cool :p it is also believed that during a charge the feathers produced an eery sound that would scare the horses of the enemy . 
  this has never been proven though and is till this date a subject of discussion among historians . 
  what do you exactly mean by ` polish sniper ' i 'm verry interested in the polish role in this conflict but i ca n't read ukrainian or russian :p is there much evidence that polish troops , military or private organisations , are active in the ukraine ? 
  how can i put flags on my space ship ? 
  i need a polish one :p, 
  thank you guys . 
  it worked, 
  it 's situated quite unfortinately , as it began as a very small , unimportant museum . 
  now that they have hugely upgraded it is the best aviation museum in poland . 
  krakow has many places like this . 
  i 've been there more than 30 times ( i live in the netherlands but my mother is polish ) but just last summer discovered that a real ww2 tank stands just a few hundred meters from the home of my family  just visit again in some years , christmas is also a thing you have experience in krakow . 
  yeah , from the us it 's expenisive . 
  personally i can buy a ticket for the bus from where i live ( the hague ) to krakow for just a 100 eur . 
  from the us it will be quite some more : / , just hope plane ticket prises will go down , 
  be sure to check out one of the zapiecek restaurants . 
  they serve the best pierogy 's in warsaw . 
  there are multiple restaurants scattered around the old town so get some pierogies for lunch when walking through old town . 
  krakow and warsaw are real must-see places . 
  if you had to chose , i think krakow would be better for the winter . 
  it 's the cultural centre of poland and almost all historical buildings escaped ww2 unscathed . 
  it has interesting places to visit like :, 
  - the old town ( there 's a nice museum underneath the cloth hall in the center of the main square ), 
  - jewisch district ( schindler museum ), 
  - auschwitz ( 1 hour drive , with busses going every 30 minutes from the central station ), 
  - zakopane ( without snow it 's a 2,5-3 hour drive , get up early and you can spend a whole day there . 
  with snow it could take longer , check for information beforehand ) . 
  - and a * lot * more , i 've vissited more than 30 times and keep discovering new things every time i go . 
  i do n't know what your budget and time allows etc. 
  but consider visiting warsaw , maybe stay there 2-3 nights or so , it 's a really nice city and is n't any less than krakow . 
  it has some of the best museums of poland ( warsaw rising mseum & polish army museum ) and has amazing rebuild buildings . 
  it 's hard to believe that the city was completely destroyed during ww2 . 
  warsaw really as a lot to offer . 
  the imperial war museum in london . 
  it just changed to open play when i warped to another star system . 
  it remained on open play for the rest of my session . 
  i think it 's solved :p, 
  aaahh i see , last time i played was a verrrry long time ago so that would be it , thanks !, 
  first time i played in months . 
  the game has gotten so many extra features that i really need to read up on what everything does . 
  it 's like playing it for the first time over again :p, 
  what does this so called `` gamma release '' mean ? 
  aah , i see thank you guys . 
  a dick-scanner ? 
  where can i find such a hangar ? 
  so , some stations have different hangars ? 
  i always thought there was only one type of hangar , the rusty kind of older one . 
  how many different ones are there , how can i spot them ? 
  thanks , how i can i find this ` design document ' ? 
  it sounds usefull . 
  thanks , i will read through them, 
  this, 
  what tank is a ` jumbo ' ? 
  aaahh i see thank you man , i 've been wondering this for a while now :p, 
  i think it might be related to the fact that the holocaust was a attempt to * eradicate * a entire culture/religion . 
  the japanese killed a lot of people but had no real intention to really * destroy * a certain group of people . 
  besides that , the method of killing by the nazi 's was on a industrial scale . 
  special ` factory 's ' where build with the only purpose to kill people . 
  the fact that the the nazi killings where so thoroughly thought out makes it such a horrible thing . 
  the japanese did ** horrible ** things but they just did not have this ideolegy driven obsession to really eredicate a whole culture/ethnic group .
