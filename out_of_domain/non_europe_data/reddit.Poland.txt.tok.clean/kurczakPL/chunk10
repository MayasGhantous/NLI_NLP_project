  - ** daytrip 3 . 
  this stunning salt mine is world famous and easily accessible by one of the many busses from krakow or by train . 
  try to be early so you wo n't have to wait in line . 
  you have some tips for losing weight ? 
  what things helped you the most ? 
  will tell my family to send me a weekly batch , 
  good to hear , i wish you the very best of luck with your interview !, 
  i do seriously think i 'm really ` in love ' with the country . 
  no joking . 
  cotten eye joe makes me unstopable . 
  yeah , but polish salaries are quite a lot lower than in belgium :p, 
  ** - warsaw rising museum - ** a absolute must to understand the city and it 's people . 
  85 % of warsaw was destroyed during ww2 , including almost 100 % of all historical monuments , buildings etc. 
  so keep in mind that places like the old town and the royal palace may look old , but are in fact no older than ~ 65 years . 
  ** - visit the old town and it 's surroundings - ** it may not be older than aprox . 
  65 years but it is still the social , cultural and historical centre of the city . 
  there are many things to see and do . 
  two tips from me would be : lapidarium , verry interesting store with lots of antiques and collectibles and try out one of the zapiecek restaurants . 
  they serve some of the most delicious polish dumplings !, 
  ( there are like 4 restaurants in the old town , you will surely find it . ), 
  http://www.zapiecek.eu/main.html http://www.lapidarium.pl/index.php, 
  ** - go to the top of the palace of science & culture - ** for a ticket that costs aprox . 
  20 pln and be bought at the main entrance , you can go with a elevator to the top to see a beautiful panorama of the city . 
  do n't forget to bring a camera !, 
  ** - visit royal \u0141azienki park - ** it 's a very nice park to get away from the big city and it 's the most popular one in warsaw . 
  those are some , but certainly not all the places , that i would absolutely recommend . 
  enjoy your stay !, 
  thanks a lot !, 
  helps me immensely , 
  damn , you just hit the jackpot . 
  dutch is my native language ;p, 
  miasto 44 is indeed the best damn movie ever !!!, 
  i 'm very sorry . 
  it 's always horrible to hear those people died just because they ` did n't fit ' in the ideal communist picture ... 
  still astonishes me that the russians still fly those soviet flags in public places, 
  damn , that 's intense . 
  thanks for posting !, 
  i study polish language and culture at the uni . 
  of amsterdam , i 'm too really scared not to get a job . 
  i chose the study because poland is my passion and i want to emigrate to poland after i finish my study , but i really would need to get a decent job there . 
  i hope that there will be some more job opportunities in other sectors besides things like translator and teacher . 
  yes !, 
  you should definitely reconsider . 
  the mountains are a real delight . 
  you should at least come once during summer and once during winter  . 
  it is a very popular tourist spot for good reason . 
  maybe you two could go to ` morskie oko ' . 
  it was named one of the 5 most beautiful lakes in the world by forbes . 
  congrats on your polish fianc\u00e9e . 
  polish woman are the best in the world , 
  i live in the netherlands an can assure you that this number is waaaay off . 
  for english it would be ok but german has really become a unpopular language now that we have internet and globalization . 
  there are a fair amount of words that are just slightly different than german and could maybe help a dutch person out if they just pronounce it in a german way , but besides that the average dutch person would not be able to do more than ask where the toilet is and saying ` hello ' and ` goodbye ' . 
  sshhhhh keep it a secret or those foreigners will steal our woman ;p, 
  hey man , i do n't know which city you live in but try the polish store in your city ( if you live near a big city ) the hague is especially known for it 's big amount of polish stores . 
  you also have quite a sizable one in amsterdam . 
  does n't really matter because both have plenty . 
  dont forget to visit the bar ` pijalnia piwo i wodki ' the have establishments in several big cities , and are always located near the town center . 
  beer wodka and shots for 1 eur :d, 
  and if your english , please try to hold yourself in a bit  young english tourists who come hear for alcohol and woman have quite a bad reputation . 
  not accusing you of something but i see more and more shit just hitting the fan with foreign tourists . 
  have a great time !, 
  i 'm in almost the same boat . 
  i ` am a student in holland and want to move to poland once i finish my study . 
  earnings will indeed be less than in the us but it 's not like you will have to live in a shack with only dry bread and water , especially not if you become a doctor . 
  do n't let yourself get down by negative comments from others who tell you that living in poland is only for the mad  poles and especially doctors in poland live a fairly good live and remember : ** happiness is not equal to the amount of money you make !, 
  when it comes to education i 'm not too sure what to advise you but i 've heard you american pay crazy amounts of money on education ( i pay 2000 eur a year for university ) . 
  attending university in the us could maybe get you a ` higher rated ' piece of paper but i 'm not sure whether hats worth the amount of money you pay for it , uni in poland will probably cost far less for you ( if i 'm right its almost free for polish nationals compared to the us ) i would suggest to maybe go to poland for the summer and really inform about the possibilities and options . 
  good luck !, 
  could you explain ? 
  i 'm not all too familiar with his program and the stance of most polonia, 
  must see :, 
  - the main square, 
  - walk from main square along grodzka street to wawel hill, 
  - maria church on the main square, 
  - cloth hall on the main square, 
  - the church , museum and royal tombs on wawel hill, 
  - jewish ` kazimierz ' district, 
  - explore all the small streets in the old town , they are wonderful, 
  - rent a bike, 
  - wodka tasting in the old town, 
  - go for a walk along the vistula banks on a morning after partying hard and/or in the evening when its dark, 
  - if you have time you * must * take a day trip to the wielicka salt mine . 
  there is a special train going there every few minutes tickets can be bought ** on the train ** so do n't spend a hour waiting in line like me . 
  from wielicka station its a few minutes walk . 
  train and entrance will set you back a bit less than around 20 euro . 
  - if you have time you * must * also go to zakopane !, 
  take the bus * early !, 
  * ( otherwise you 'll get stuck in traffic , you should take the bus no later than 7:30 in the morning . 
  timetable is available at the bus stop on krakow main station ) it costs 15 zl ( 4 euro ) one way . 
  remember that the last bus back will be around 8 o clock in the evening . 
  you can buy tickets at the bus driver but i would recommend buying them a day earlier at the main station so you will know when your bus leaves and that you ll be sure to have a seat reserved . 
  there is just * so * much more to visit but its easy to find on sites like trip adviser emily 's guide to krakow : http://emilysguidetokrakow.com/ ( i 'm not associated with the person owning this site ), 
  or travel wiki : http://wikitravel.org/en/krak%c3%b3w, 
  be sure to go to the ` pijalnia wodki i piwo bar where you can by drinks like beer , wodka and shots for just 1 euro . 
  it 's super cheap and super fun . 
  be aware though that it can be crowded in the evening , especially on weekends . 
  if you want more please send me a pm or comment i am verry familiar with the city and also detailed information like timetables for buses or prices for different things . 
  is he really so bad ? 
  does kaczinski still have any kind of real power ?
