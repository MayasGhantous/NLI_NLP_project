  meat is in everything so i hope you are no vegetarian , 
  lastly i would just like to remind you that the oscypek is something almost every pole has ` learnt ' to eat . 
  most people , including me , did n't like it the first time they ate it but now i ca n't get enough of it . 
  so do n't be discouraged when the first one does n't immediately taste that heavenly ;d, 
  erdogan and the russian ministery of defense confirm that it 's a russian plane . 
  seems like shit could hit the fan now ... 
  well as a fellow meat-lover i welcome you in paradise , 
  what do you mean with ` free ' ? 
  behold , our savior in these desperate times : http://www.military-today.com/tanks/pl_01.jpg, 
  me too , thanks, 
  weedhooker - amsterdam, 
  seriously , i tried quitting so many times but i always fail , not good because it gives me acne and it 's just super unhealthy with all the sugar and shit, 
  username checks out !, 
  is this related to kapitan bomba ? 
  be aware that besides helping , the languages can also cause problems . 
  i study polish language at the university in amsterdam and i have some people in my class who had studied russian before . 
  they very much tent to use russian pronunciation and grammar rules . 
  russian pronouncing is , in contrast to common belief , * very * different than polish . 
  so be verry careful when combing the languages ;p, 
  poles and russian do n't get along very well to say the least . 
  try to keep that in mind if you would go to visit poland and have a russian accent :p, 
  it may look good on paper but there are some points which , combined with human nature , make it an ideology that just ca n't be put in proper practice . 
  communist nations can just not function in the real world . 
  just look at all the failed commi-states and all the human suffering which was involved . 
  capitalism is in no way a perfect system . 
  it has big flaws , like the extremely rich 1 % in countries like the usa and big companies wielding far too much power , but still it is by far the best system out there . 
  not agreeing , but still laughed ;p, 
  i just began a study ` polish language and culture ' because i really wanted to study something that passionates me . 
  i knew job opportunities would n't be plenty full , but this thread made me really stress out : /, 
  poland is the 17th most visited country in a world with more than 200 countries . 
  i would certainly not call it 2nd rank :p, 
  here 's the explanation :, 
  on 19 august 2003 , a polish air force su-22m4k was accidentally shot down by friendly fire during an exercise by a polish 2k12 kub battery . 
  the aircraft was flying 21 km from the coast over the baltic sea near ustka . 
  the pilot ejected and was rescued after two hours in the water . 
  he later died in a c-295m crash on 23 january 2008 . 
  [ 29 ] as of 2012 , poland is planning to replace its su-22s with three squadrons of uavs . 
  as of 2014 the polish air force is planning to retain the su-22s in service . 
  the air force will either keep all of its planes for the next three years , or withdraw half of them use the remainder for the following decade . 
  it is hoped that this decision will have a positive impact on polish industry , as the wzl nr 2 repair facility in bydgoszcz will maintain the remaining aircraft under contract to the air force . 
  the decision will also allow the air force to retain the well-trained ground crews and pilots , currently operating the machines . 
  the poles consider the su-22 easier to maintain and repair than the other main combat aircraft types currently in polish service ( mainly the mig-29 and the f-16 ) . 
  they also suffer from fewer malfunctions and other problems ( high , 70 -- 75 % non-error index ) . 
  it is also the only plane in polish inventory equipped for electronic intelligence , warfare , and support of ground systems . 
  the polish air force has retained a large stockpile of air-to-ground weapons for use with the su-22 . 
  by some estimates , the cost of destroying these resources would be higher than the projected cost of continuing su-22 operations, 
  what 's up with all the damn commies in this sub ? 
  he is the star of one of our polish music clips https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwspao2sn8e, 
  it 's actually the polish word for ` gamers ' . 
  its something all poles great eachother with in videogames or say it to see if there other poles in the match :p, 
  i am seriously baffled why you get downvoted and how all these people can believe in a communist system . 
  i have been myself downvoted here just for asking what the deal with all the commie posts is . 
  believe me im polish and we have lost many lives when fighting against communism and under communist rule . 
  never has a communist state succeeded , its just not possible to put it in working practice . 
  capitalism has some serious flaws but i think its by far the best system out there . 
   though it ca n't be much worse than the current system . 
  please tell me more about you having to fear for your life and spending it in an impoverished and opressed way . 
  czech is just polish in a funny accent ;p, 
  poland lost aprox . 
  20 % of its population , making it the biggest proportional loss in the war . 
  also a very important thing to remember is that poland , unlike russia , was occupied . 
  the germans and soviets ( earlier in the war ) could do what ever they wanted with the country , resulting in the systematic annihilation of the polish elite ; military , politicians , scholars , lawyers , doctors , artists , priests , and other figures from every layer of sociaty that the poles could possibly rally behind . 
  while for example russian losses where mainly civilian and low military ( not that these lives matter less but they didnt lose the high ranking figures like poland did ) . 
  entire cities , like warsaw , where completely destroyed and the nazis and soviets tried to destroy nor only the polish military and politicans , but just the whole of the polish culture , history and ` soul ' . 
  i live in holland and people there do n't take their shoes off * at all * . 
  i really do not understand it , but when you enter a polish home you usually take them off in the hallway . 
  i made a trip this summer with my friend through gda\u0144sk , warsaw and krak\u00f3w . 
  i can highly recommend it , here is a comment i made a while back when someone asked the same question . 
  please pm me if you have further questions  :, 
  hey !, 
  i 'll be making exactly the same trip in 2 days , only difference is that i 'll spend just 10 days in poland . 
  i 've never visited gdansk before but can still give you tips , i 've been to warsaw once for 3 days and i visit krakow around 2-3 times a year so i 'm like an expert on that city ;p, 
  i 'll give name the city 's in the order in which i 'll be visiting them so i do n't know wheather this will match your plans because i 'll be flying from eindoven , holland but you just switch them in the order you 'll we visiting them . 
  i would recommend to travel between these cities by train . 
  the new ** express intercity premium ** line ( ** eip or pendolino ** ) drives between the 3 cities and takes no more than 3 hours to bring you from gdansk to warsaw and from warsaw to krakow . 
  i myself chose to take the last trains from gdansk and later on from warsaw . 
  they leave at aprox . 
  20:00 from gdansk glowny and warszawa centralna and give you the opportunity to spent the day in the city . 
  be sure though to book your tickets early as the trains are quite popular . 
  i booked them 2 weeks in advance and was able to buy each ticket for only ** 50 pln ( ~ 15 usd ) for 2nd class seats ** . 
  here you can buy your tickets : http://www.intercity.pl/en/ ( pendolino train is clearly marked as eip ), 
  you could also travel by bus ( polskibus ) but it will take longer and is less comfortable . 
  tickets can be bought here : http://www.polskibus.com/en, 
  the city is mostly referred to as the tricity region . 
  this means the city gdansk , the party and festival city of sopot and the port city of gdynia . 
  - be sure to check out ** the old town , st. mary 's church , the long lane , the long market ** which are all located in or around the old centre . 
  - the ** european solidarity museum ** where you 'll learn about the solidarity movement that ultimately brought down communism in europe . 
  you can also check out the ** entrance of the gdansk shipyar ** d where famous speeches where held . 
  - the city is world famous for it 's amber . 
  the region has the most amber in the world so be sure to buy yourself some ** amber souvenirs ** . 
  even the stadium is designed to resemble amber !, 
  there 's also a ** amber museum ( museum bursztynu ) ** . 
  - you can visit ** westerplatte ** . 
  this is where the very first shots of ww2 were fired . 
  the fortifications were occupied by some 200 polish infantrymen who held their positions for 7 days against a force of apox . 
  3.500 germans plus ships and stuka dive bombers . 
  - take a train to the city of ** malbork ** . 
  here you can find the ** biggest castle in the world ** !, 
  it was build by the knights of the teutonic order who were later destroyed by the polish commonwealth .
