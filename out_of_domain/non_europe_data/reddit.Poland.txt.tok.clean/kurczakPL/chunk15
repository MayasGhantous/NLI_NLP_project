  just super !, 
  can i ask where you got your polish pieces from ? 
  i live in eu and visit poland regularly , i have a wz 34 and wz 21 that i bought at replikabroni.pl for around 400 z\u0142 ( with scabbard ) and a rusty sikorski sword which i once paid far to much for in the cloth hall in krakow before i knew you could just get them online . 
  now i would really like to get a hussar sword or maybe just something more fancy . 
  i saw that you placed a order at a polish weapons smith for 3000z\u0142 , which one of the swords was that ? 
  the pictures of his work where just beautifull, 
  miasto 44 , about the warsaw uprising in 1944 . 
  it has hollywood quality special effects and a grim storyline, 
  bleeding out because of paper cuts . 
  borat , i feel like this would be some strange shit . 
  here is his store page : http://sklep.lacedemon.info/, 
  ( this is no advertising ), 
  thanks mate , i respect your decission not to disclose the seller and i ; m looking forward to your album  do you btw have experience with the swords from sites like replikabroni.pl and globaarts.pl who have sabres produced by ` hiszpa\u0143ski zak\u0141ad p\u0141atnerski ' . 
  are they worth the 100 eur price tag ? 
  and do you know how much the real wz 24 , wz 34 and maybe other polish sabres should weigh in kilograms ? 
  doing your homework on a regular basis is * the * key to getting good grades . 
  do n't just do your homework for every lesson , but study it like it would be for a test . 
  if you have blocks of 7 weeks and you 're going to discuss 7 chapters do it this way : week 1-learn chapter 1 like if it is for a test/week 2-learn chapter 2 like if it was for a test and casually read through chapter 1 again / week 3-learn chapter 3 like if it was for a test and casually read through chapters 1 and 2 etc. 
  consistency is the key to good grades, 
  please keep us updated !, 
  i will also emigrate to poland ( born and raised in holland ) and i 'm very interested how other people who have lived in western europe experience moving to poland . 
  best of luck to you !, 
  the painting depicts the decisive battle in the polish-soviet war ( 1919-1921 ) . 
  the conflict is rather unknown in the western world but the polish victory essentially denied the soviets to spread the revolution to other countries in europe . 
  many historians agree that this is one of the most important battles in history , as a soviet victory could easily have led to a socialist revolution in germany and other european countries . 
  4,500 dollars will get you some sweet hussar armor : http://exclusivereplicas.pl//product_info.php?cpath=2&amp;products_id=58, 
  be sure to visit the g\u00f3rale style restaurants in the are of zakopane . 
  they have the best meat and local dishes , plus the atmosphere is amazing !, 
  the poles had actually quite a fetish for armored trains, 
  introduction of the potato is one of the biggest changes in our history . 
  the amount of kcal/m2 that could be produced was unprecedented till than, 
  the government may be more autocratic but the party is very anti-russian and so are most poles . 
  the anti-russian sentiment is still very strong among people and the government . 
  it 's for good reason if you consider that many people including the russian government view the communist actions as something positive . 
  hey ,, 
  : o mate , telling that the rest of krakow is a dump hurts my soul . 
  i have family inj nowa huta and you can just bike 5 minutes and it will look like you are in rural eastern-poland . 
  krakow has so many beutifull places besides its old town . 
  hey mate , i visit krakow very regularely and always spend at least one day in the mountains . 
  there are several bus companies like polskibus , szawgropol and majerbus . 
  my advice would be to buy the tickets the day before you leave . 
  you can buy the tickets at the bus platform right next to the central station , tickets cost ~ 15 pln one way , making it around 30 pln for a two way ticket . 
  tickets can also be bought directly from the bus driver with many companies but buying them beforehand can give you more certainty . 
  i would very much advice you to take the bus no later than 7:30 because after that there can be quite some busy roads . 
  the last busses usually leave zakopane at around 19:30 to 20:00 . 
  for trails i would recommend the czarne oko lake ( voted one of the 5 most beautiful in the world by forbes , or maybe you want to climb mount giewont ( can take a while though ) . 
  both trails star in kuznice . 
  to get in kuznice there are going mini vans from zakopane central every 5 min that take you to kuznice in 5 to ten minutes and cost 2 or 5 pln . 
  o wow , totally wrong name , it 's indeed morskie oko . 
  i do n't know about the site you used , but 8 hours will get you almost to the other side of the country , morskie oko is just some minutes away . 
  i 've been looking for the article in forbes but i really cant find it anymore , but i 'm 100 % sure i read it . 
  here is the tripadvisor page :, 
  and here is the google maps view of the distance : https://www.google.nl/maps/dir//zajazd+g%c3%b3rski+ku%c5%banice,+ku%c5%banice+11,+34-500+zakopane/@49.2458175,20.0149445,18705m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m12!1m3!3m2!1s0x4715f328380522f5:0xc443754507b05052!2szajazd+g%c3%b3rski+ku%c5%banice!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x4715f328380522f5:0xc443754507b05052!2m2!1d19.9803329!2d49.2696877, 
  getting to morskie oko is very wel organized , you can walk or take a horse wagon , more info can be found on the tripadvisor page . 
  good luck and tell me if you need something more !, 
  i study full-time polish at my university and we use the books of miodunka ` czesc ja sie masz ' i and ii . 
  the have many grammatical lessons , like the grammatical cases and the polish ` aspect ' and have quite a good assortment of vocabulary . 
  these books give a good base to become a a2 level speaker at least . 
  re-production *, 
  doe this mean the guides will stop ? 
  what made you decide to leave poland if i may ask ? 
  big penis farts, 
  the new rifles look sexy as hell , much better to have a domestic weapon for the honor guard than some soviet rifles . 
  could be , but they are still a left over from the warsaw pact-era : /, 
  these rifles are specifically modified for the representative battalion of the polish army , they even get their own special bayonets /, 
  hey ,, 
  thank you mate , really helpfull, 
  ** - zakopane ** : mountain capital of poland . 
  you take the bus from the bus platform next to the central station . 
  one way tickets can be bought for ** 15 pln ** ** directly from the bus driver ** before your departure or you can buy them in advance from the ** ticket counter at the bus platform ** . 
  i would recommend the second option and would advice to take the bus before 8:00 in the morning , to avoid traffic jams ( although you prob . 
  wont be affected by them because it is n't holiday season yet ) . 
  the trip will take no more than ** 2 hours ** and the last buses depart from zakopane around ** 19:30 -20:00 ** . 
  ticket for the way back can also be bought in krakow . 
  ** do n't take the train ** though , it will take much longer because it stops at every damn village on the way , 
  the city itself is beautiful and characterized by the [ ** g\u00f3rale style type of buildings ** ] ( http://www.polenreizen.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/karol-szymanowski-museum.png ), 
  but has also many other attractions . 
  examples are the lake ** ' [ morskie oko ] ( http://ocdn.eu/images/pulscms/mje7mdqsmcw3msxkndgsnzc4oza2ldmymcwxyzi_/1d3df8c70767b91de19ac32d366d81dd.jpg ) ' ** ,, 
  the famous [ ** guba\u0142\u00f3wka mountain ** ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/panorama_tatr_z_guba%c5%82%c3%b3wki.jpg/1920px-panorama_tatr_z_guba%c5%82%c3%b3wki.jpg ) with its astonishing view of the polish tatra and excellent walking routes . 
  and many other hiking routes , mountain paths ( [ ** giewont ** ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/0/5751/z5751610q,tatry.jpg ) ) , [ ** local culture ** ] ( https://rarebirdsfly.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/local-market-zakopane.jpg ) and even a [ ** first class shopping street ** ] ( http://previews.123rf.com/images/marekusz/marekusz1311/marekusz131100070/24104259-zakopane-november-17-gateway-to-fashion-street-krupowki-29-shopping-avenue-length-of-over-120-meters-stock-photo.jpg ) . 
  because you will probably stay just one day i would recommend visiting the city itself , take the [ mountain train ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/41318470.jpg ) up to guba\u0142\u00f3wka ( be sure to buy your ticket from the ticket machine located [ ** here ** ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/@49.294437,19.9526693,3a,75y,260.66h,78.76t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s43_bcia2sbw4sa-uym4lia!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) , next to the postal office ( maybe they changed it though ) . 
  this way you wont have to wait in line at the train itself ( although there could be none because of it being begin of june  . 
  when you 're up the mountain get yourself some polish kie\u0142basa and beer while enjoying the superb view . 
  after that i would recommend [ following the path in the direction of the big radio tower seen from the arrival point of the mountain train ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/dir/49.306668,19.9324698/49.3219338,19.950827/@49.3055706,19.9367368,1101m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!4m1!3e2 ) . 
  following the path will give you some great views . 
  after you have had enough , you just go back the same way from which you came and you take the train down again . 
  be sure to visit the [ market at the foot of the mountain ] ( http://www.polandculinaryvacations.com/blog/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/august-14-09-krakow-058.jpg ) . 
  than i would recommend to visit one of the traditional restaurants for some very good food . 
  this is just a recommendation and there is plenty of time to fill in with other things . 
  ** visiting morskie oko and climbing giewont or kasprowy wierch is * very * beautiful ** and would also be perfect choices but keep in mind that they can take up most of your day ( especially the mountain climbing ) . 
  please ask away if you have more questions , 
  tell me about it . 
  i 'm a dutch student with polish roots and i 'm determent to emigrate to krakow , poland after i finish my studies . 
  80 % of poles tell me i 'm crazy for wanting to live in such a poor country when i can also just live like a ` king ' in holland . 
  some people really think they are no better off than in ethiopia and/or think that the streets in countries like holland and germany are made out of gold and everyone is a millionaire here , 
  i have never played hoi myself but will certainly buy this one on release date and as a polish patriot i 'm pumped to see my nation in it , even with a day one dlc dedicated to it , but is it really that hard to survive , even if you begin in the earliest time-period ? 
  enjoy your ride guys !, 
  be sure to post your vids and pics when finished , 
  first we have to get to conquer iran , than we can bring wojtek back to crush the commies :d, 
  i do n't know about other slavic countries but in poland it 's in general very important to look the best you can , especially for woman .
