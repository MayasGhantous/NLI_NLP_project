  sounds like this is something gaijin should have a look at : / i 'm just now beginning to research my first high-tier tanks and i can allready confirm what you said . 
  did you really do this in a month !, 
  www.wp.pl is like the polish frontpage of the internet, 
  never too old to fulfil your dreams, 
  that 's true , * real * paczki are verry hard to come by in nl : / is it hard to make them yourself ? 
  i 've never tried it , but it sounds like a fun challange :p i 'll be looking for some guides on the internet . 
  we are planning on buying a 4k monitor , will i need a strong gpu to run run the resolution for everyday use ; internet , mail , photo 's and video 's . 
  do you have a example of a card that would be good ? 
  we where thinking about 700/800 euro 's for the pc , with a cheaper i5 , ssd 128gb , 8 ( ? 
  ) gb ram , 1tb hdd and the gpu . 
  i 'm not sure what motherboard would bea good choice though . . 
  thank you verry much man !, 
  just want to ask if the 290 is n't overkill ? 
  this pc will in * no * way be used for gaming , just general usage and vieuwing pics and video 's in 4k . 
  the one in the background is boleslaw gladych ( 1918-2011 ), 
  the one in the foreground is miroslaw feric ( 1915-1942 ), 
  i live in holland but because of family i visit the city 3 times a year . 
  my best advice is to just buy a bus ticket , hop on a random bus and exit on a busstop . 
  i 've been more than 30 times in krakow for periods from 2 to 5 weeks and i * always * see new things this way . 
  if you do n't have the time it may be wiser to plan where you going , but give it at least a try one day :p other than that i would recommend the following ` off-the-beaten-road ' places :, 
  * nowa huta - the communist-era neighborhood and famous steel factory in east krakow . 
  * kalwaria zebzidowska - it 's often called the jeruzalem of europe . 
  beautifull churches and landscape . 
  * kopiec ko\u015bciuszki - the biggest of the many viewing points around krakow . 
  ( tip - walk from the old town centre to the mount along the wisla , it 's really relaxing and makes you appreciate the city more ), 
  * the polish aviation museum - it has been extensively renovated and has some verry nice aircraft . 
  * tyniec monastary - a beautiful monastery just outside of krakow . 
  * podziemia rynku - there is a verry nice museum * under * the main market square . 
  the entrance is in the cloth hall . 
  * when visiting the mountains you can tavel the dunajec river on a tradition raft . 
  the nature is absolutely stunning . 
  * zamek niepolomice - it 's a royal castle in a small town just outside krakow , really worth a visit . 
  furthermore i would ** strongly !, 
  ** advice you to plan a , maybe 3-night trip to warsaw , if you have n't got a plan to visit allready . 
  90 % destroyed during ww2 , but it 's beautifully rebuild and has such a moving history . 
  your number one priority would be visiting the warsaw rising museum , it 's a must see to understand the city , it 's people and the whole country in general . 
  i will not go further in detail now but i 've you plan on visiting you can always ask about it on the subreddit or pm me if you want for more/other questions . 
  hope you enjoy your stay !, 
  * exactly * what i needed . 
  i live in europe so i ca n't buy from the site , but i visit poland 3 times a year so i will certainly use this site as a guide to buy the books in poland , thanks !, 
  i 've put those two on my to-buy-list , verry intersting stories !, 
  my first !, 
  thank you :p poland is my passion so talking about it is like practicing a hobby especially when helping others to explore the country . 
  remeber you can always message me for more questions . 
  warsaw is beautiful , but ** make sure ** that you visit the warsaw rising museum . 
  it 's not only verry interesting but it 's also a must-see to understand the city and the whole country of poland . 
  furthermore i would recommend you to buy a ticket to go to the top of the palace of culture and science , the view is beautiful, 
  i 'm half polish and i 've been born and have lived all the 19 years of my life in the netherlands . 
  the joke you made is seriously the biggest struggle in my life when it comes to talking about my polish herritage with dutch people . 
  they just shove poland off as `` one of those eastern block , grey , poor ass , sub-russia countries . 
  the struggle of proving them wrong is so hard that i feel like slapping all the people in this country one by one with the traditional dutch pickled herring if it was n't for the fact that they would just like it and thank me for it :p, 
  i would say to just try it . 
  i 'm in the same boat ( half polish , born and live in the netherlands ) i will be emigrating to poland as soon as i finish my study at the university . 
  you live only once and you should make the best of it . 
  even if , for some reason you ca n't feel at home and return to the country you currently live in , you have at least ** tried ** it . 
  not trying can leave you wondering for the rest of your live about what ` could have been ' if you at least tried . 
  i know what you mean , i heared it a 1000 times : wages in poland generally suck , so just stay putt and come here in the holiday 's etc. 
  for me , poland , it 's history , culture , etc. 
  is my * passion * , the thing i live for , the thing that helps me through hard times , the thing i would be willing to give my life for ... just going to a store or walking through a ordinary neighborhood in poland just gives me * so * much joy , let alone walking through historical places like the old town districts of city 's or musea . 
  99 % of people think i 'm crazy for going nuts about these things , but for me these things give me the best feeling in the world , by far . 
  i 'm only 19 but i 'm already fed up with having to look at that damn pc monitor every time i want to ` experience ' poland . 
  being able to just walk through the krakow old town after work , visiting city 's like warsaw and zakopane in the weekend and just being part of the country , contribute to making it a better place and being part of its history would my dream come true . 
  i would gladly give up the purchasing power i would have in the netherlands . 
  in the end life is about being happy , and although money is a verry important factor , it can never buy you happines , especially in my case . 
  besides , i can always return to the netherlands if the circumstances demand it . 
  i hope so either , although i am not sure weather such a strong feeling can leave me  thanks for your advice nontheless, 
  you study polish history ? 
  where and when can i sign up !? 
  but seriously , polish history is my passion , where are you studying ? 
  i 'll be studying polish language and culture at the university of amsterdam , beginning this summer , ca n't wait !, 
  polish 20th century history ... wow man , i would would kill to get such an oppertunity , you are really one lucky bastard :p polish is one of the hardest languages to learn , so do n't give up !, 
  get yourself some polish music , radio , movies , books , etc. 
  and of course use the holy grail that we call the internet . 
  here 's a youtube channel that really helped me : https://www.youtube.com/channel/uccrxm_enfxkml7_iwerqlrq, 
  the guy speaks really clear , not too fast and the subjects are verry interesting . 
  hope you enjoy !, 
  sadly not : / currently the main university building of the university of amsterdam ( uva ) is being occupied by students and teachers who are angry because it 's not sure whether studies like slavic or scandinavian languages will stay available in the next few years . 
  dutch universities are , sadly , more focused on money than on quality, 
  thanks , i will surely take a look there !, 
  - first and foremost , the warsaw uprising museum . 
  it 's arguably the most important event in the modern history of the city and makes you understand why there are monuments , statues and such on every streetcorner in the city , and plz donate a bit to the museum or buy something at their shop , 
  make sure to know the difference between the jewish uprising 1943 and the warsaw uprising 1944 , this museum is about the latter . 
  - visit the top of the palace of science and culture aka ` stalin 's penis ' . 
  for around 12 zloty 's you can buy a ticket to the top where you have a 360 degree view of the city . 
  - visit the old town of course . 
  - lazienki park is a nice place to relax after you 've had a rough night  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%81azienki_park, 
  - the royal route : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_route,_warsaw, 
  - if you guys like army stuff etc. 
  i would recommend the polish army museum . 
  it 's not far from the city center and has some real jewels . 
  - try the traditinal polish dumplings in one of the zapiecek restaurants . 
  the have around three restaurants in the old town . 
  - have fun !, 
  that 's the most important thing to do . 
  but plz do n't overdo it with the alcohol . 
  unlike what most people think , poland is no land of drunks and you will get yourself verry unpopular when you are cousing trouble while being drunk . 
  these are just some must-do / - see activities , it 's a big city so there is * a lot * more to do , hope you enjoy !, 
  spot on :p, 
  may they never come back again ... 
  first of : history .
