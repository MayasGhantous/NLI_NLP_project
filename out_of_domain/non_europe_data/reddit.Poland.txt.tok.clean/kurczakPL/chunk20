  i decided to just ignore it ( yes very stupid ) and go to sleep hoping it would be over in the morning which it was . 
  still i could n't walk for the next two days because of my legs and feet being destroyed . 
  now , although i fucked up earlier , i feel a real sense of accomplishment and would really like to walk another mountain and was thinking of kasprowy wierch . 
  i now know what to expect and will soon buy military grade boots , special clothing and be sure to bring enough food/water . 
  still i would like to ask if someone has any tips or advice when climbing . 
  is it for example comparable to giewont ? 
  ** tl ; dr climbed giewont without any preparations and payed the price but felt big sense of accomplishment . 
  now wanting to try kasprowy wierch . 
  anyone one has any tips or know how comparable it is to giewont ? 
  i know junk can be stored at the workbench but where can i safely store things like weapons and appearal ? 
  can i just make a container and store it there or will raiders/npc 's be able to take the stuff ? 
  where do you guys store it ? 
  just discovered this after 52 hours in-game ... 
  it 's the song that begins at 20:23, 
  thank you guys in advance , 
  will the minuteman view me differently or will my position not change ? 
  and will the brotherhood be hostile to me if i would refuse their offer ? 
  i like the minuteman and my position as their general which i would like to keep this way but i would also like to have the brotherhood as an allied/non-hostile group,

  in the sentence ' w ksi\u0105\u017ckce telefonicznej ' ` ksi\u0105\u017cce ' is in the locative case , but is ` telefonicznej ' also in the locative or is this a genitive case ? 
  thanks in advance, 
  so what do you guys think will be the best strategy ? 
  as a democratic country it will be impossible to declare war on the baltic states and/or czechoslovakia , so expanding will be hard before a german attack . 
  would you guys wait till 1939 and just hang on for dear life ?

  just something i noticed and i 'm really astonished by the amount of detail i have seen thus far . 
  keep it up !,

  so i would like to attend the parade tomorrow but it will be my first time . 
  anyone have some tips or advice ? 
  the parade begins at 12:00 and i would like to stand as close to the main stage ( with the president etc ) as possible . 
  thanks in advance, 
  so i 've always been quite chubby and i 've done several attempts to change this but i never had the strength to follow on with it , mainly because i just did n't want to give up on food . 
  this changed this summer when i went on vacation and because of the heat ate very little . 
  i lost at least 5 kg in july ( after which i was , and still am , 95kg , 190cm ) . 
  now i am going to the gym 5 times a week , using this routine ( 1st one by j-dawg ) : http://www.bodybuilding.com/content/what-is-the-best-5-day-workout-split.html, 
  and i 've been drinking at least 3 liters water a day and keeping my calories under 1700 , but on many days it stays below 1000 . 
  am i overdoing it with the calls , because i feel like it should really let me lose fat but i have n't seen any changes on the scale . 
  outside of the gym i do n't do any kind of exercise but still i think i should have already lost some weight . 
  on the other hand i 'm afraid that i 'm taking to few calories and i 'm just destroying my muscles . 
  has any got any advice on what to do ? 
  so i 'm trying to lose some weight ( i 'm 190cm/90kg ) by dieting ( 1700 kcals/day ) but i 'm also doing lifting 5 times a week to maintain/build muscle . 
  problem is now that i just ca n't seem to get to my recommended proteine ( ~ 200gr/day ) , although i eat 200 grams of chicken breast , 450ml quark and a proteine shake with milk every day . 
  i usually end up at around 120gr proteine a day . 
  i really ca n't afford to eat more chicken ( i 'm a poor student ) so should i drink an extra shake per day , which would give me around 30gr of proteine extra ? 
  and does not enough proteine realy mean i wo n't be able to put on muscle ? 
  thanks in advance !, 
  how do you experience the difference between the two sentences ' w pruszkowie buduje si\u0119 nowa szko\u0142a ' and ' w pruszkowie buduje si\u0119 now\u0105 szko\u0142\u0119 ' if i 'm right it should be about the fact that the first sentence ca n't specify an executor , but i ca n't really ` feel ' the difference myself . 
  how about you natives ? 
  hej , so i will be visiting family in a few days and during my 4 week stay i would like to keep my progress in the gym so i would like to get a subscription for 1 month in nowa huta , krakow . 
  i saw that a good looking club called mcfit just opened in the wanda shopping mall but i ca n't find a polish site with prices or something like that . 
  does anybody know where i can find some more info about them or does anybody have another recommendation for gym , what are by the way standard prices per month ? 
  thanks in advance .

  so i 've been going to the gym 6 times a week for the past 5 months doing typical bros-split . 
  now that i have finally read this sub and the wiki i want to change to a ppl . 
  my problem though is that the op from the ` beginner ppl ' from the reddit is really stressing the fact you have to add weight every session . 
  while doing my bro split dough i have only gone up weights just a few times in the 5 months and i 'm certain i wo n't be able to add weight * every * session . 
  should i look for something else or is it not as big as a problem a i make it out to be ? 
  thanks in advance, 
  so i have been doing a bro split for the first 5 months that i have been lifting and now i would like to get serious . 
  i would like to do a ppl program just for hyperthrofie , i 'm not as interested in powerlifting . 
  i 'm 21 years old and weigh 85 kg 's ( still have moobs , i ` am still cutting ) and i 'm 190 cm tall . 
  these are the 2 programs i am looking at and i would like to ask you guys what the main differences are and whether you would advice one above the other . 
  thanks in advance !,
