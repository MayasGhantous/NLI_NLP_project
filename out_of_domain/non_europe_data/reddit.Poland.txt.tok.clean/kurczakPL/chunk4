  seriously man , i 'm soooooooo jealous of you . 
  making all those trips , seeing the whole country . 
  you are really enjoying life , keep it up !, 
  wot ? 
  yes , i bought it myself in poland . 
  it has eng subtitles with every dvd copy . 
  if you pirated it , there are many different subtitles for it on the internet . 
  please ask if you have any further questions :p, 
  poland is my passion and i would really like to move to krakow when i finish university . 
  everyone declares me crazy for going ` in the wrong direction ' but you got one life to spend and i 'm certain i want to spend it in poland . 
  if i do n't just try it , i will regret it all my life . 
  when it comes to work i do n't have a carreer planned out yet . 
  i thought of doing something with my dutch language skill or maybe some office job , but now that i work in a office myself i really began thinking whether this would be something that i would like to do almost every day for the coming ~ 50 years or so . 
  i want to do something that gives me pride and satisfaction , not just something i hate but pays good , after all , you 'll be working 8 hours a day , 5 days per week for almost the rest of your life . 
  that 's why i 'm very seriously thinking of joining the polish army . 
  the polish army is a huge passion of mine and it would be a * huge * hounour if i could join it ranks . 
  i hope that i could start out as officer and progress from there on . 
  i 'll probably be earning less than other jobs for my level of education , but i could n't care less if i 'm proud of my job . 
  it 's all just a plan and things could totally turn out different , but this is the life i hope to live , 
  i visit the country 2-3 times a year to stay at my family in krakow . 
  since i was 12 i had permission to go poland by myself with eurolines bus ( i live in holland ) . 
  last year i decided to go by train , so i could stay in warsaw for 3 days before going to my family . 
  this was one of the best decisions ever and now i 'm stoked to go on my next trip to another city , probably gdansk . 
  i have a * huge * list of places that i want to visit and i 'm sure i 'll visit them all  when i was younger my father and i stayed at a tiny village on the border of the bialowieza forest for 2 weeks . 
  this was a real rural experience that i will never forget , zero tourists , but you could really experience the ` soul ' of poland . 
  i even saw real * wild * bizons :p i hope to one day do a tour on bicycle from the beginning to the end of the wisla river . 
  the river is the liveblood of poland and it brings you along big cities like warsaw , krakow and gdansk but also along rural villages and medieval towns like torun . 
  i really wish you the best of luck and hope that you 'll be able to visit every place you want to , 
  thanks man , went from ~ 100-200 kb/s to ~ 1-2 mb/s :d, 
  thanks man , did n't know those letters where mission indicators , i was just waiting for my phone to ring :p can i ask what the numbers in the upper right corner of the screen mean , sometimes they appear . . 
  the best , niemen was one of the greatest polish singers . 
  gave me goosebumbs when this song came up at `` miasto44 '', 
  please , let 's keep it civil . 
  tell me about it ... . as a pole living in holland i have to deal with prejudices like these every day : / people often ask me whether the average pole has access to internet and whether we speak russian ... 
  hey , in september i 'll start a masters study in polish language and culture at the university of amsterdam . 
  i 'm verry interested in the language course you describe , it would really be helpfull for my study . 
  do you have a webpage or something like that where i could get some info ? 
  yeah it 's at the uva , but it 's a full to 4 years study . 
  it 's called slavische talen en culturen , you can then pick polish , russian , servo-croatic and czech as your main language . 
  thanks man , i 'll definately be attending next year !, 
  thanks !, 
  verry helpfull . 
  is it true dat mikke thinks that woman are not inteligent as man ? 
  i know that he is a verry controversial person , i saw him regular on websires like wp and on polish tv, 
  sounds like he has n't really made up his mind ;p yes , overall woman are less interested in politics but in no way way does this make them less intelligent ( i 'm no woman btw ) . 
  do you know how he thinks about russian-polish relations ? 
  this interests me most , given the situation in europe . 
  sounds like he looks the other way , i hope he will eventually realize that he is in the middle of the conflict and not just a bystander . 
  verry helpfull , i 'll be emigrating to poland after my study ( not to work at cdprojekt ) and it 's nice to see advice like this . 
  verry indepth and helpfull !, 
  beautifull video as always , cq n't wait to visit the city myself !, 
  i would advise you to keep the text more ` neutral ' . 
  calling the skyrim npc 's a bunch of one dimensional nobodies , although true , sounds like your just hating skyrim and not trying to convince people with hard facts so that they can make up their own minds . 
  this will make people take your post less serious and will thus make it less effective  other than that it 's great that you found all these facts and try to get more people into the witcher !, 
  some places may be more infuenced by , for example celtic/nordic influence , but the story and atmosphere of the game as a whole are a lot more polish/slavic than celtic or nordic, 
  sorry , misread it , but it still sounds a little too subjective . 
  maybe try to use othe words that make it look like it 's factual , although that can be hard when it comes to describing companions . 
  all other category 's look verry factual though and make the witcher look good without being ` fanboy'isch ' about it ;p, 
  yeah nothing is sure yet but from watching dev video 's it looked that way to me . 
  we will have to wait till may 19th to know for sure , 
  great video . 
  i 'm planning to go to morsie oko myself this summer , do you have any tips worth pointing out ? 
  and do you know whether it 's possible to climb rysy without any experience or equipment ? 
  thanks for replying !, 
  i will look around the web for some more info and i will for sure climb it in the summer . 
  now just hope for some great wheather to make some nice pictures , 
  i 'll be sure to do so , 
  thanks , got it , 
  yeah , walking between those rows of mig 's and soviet-era helicopters made it feel really cold-war-like . 
  i have never experienced the cold war myself but yiu get a ` special ' feeling when walking past htese planes and knowing that they could be used if shit had hit the fan . 
  yes , they take care of the ones outside , but they will eventually break down . 
  planes that are more rare like ww1 and ww2 era planes are displayed inside , so they do n't get affected by the weather . 
  the mig 's are not so rare and there is a less strong bond between poles and planes from the communist era than for example planes from ww2 . 
  yeah ofcourse it 's not like every person has a mig in their backyards ;p , but the museum has only limited space , so they have to choose what planes the display inside and outside . 
  mig 's are bigger , sturdier and historicly less worth than their ww1/2 counterparts . 
  that 's why those planes are displayed outside . 
  i think it 's currently away for repairs but it should come back quickly , 
  shame it was not there :p visit another time , krakow is a * really * nice city !, 
  besides , he can upgrade his swords with runes , oils etc. 
  and he can use different kinds of throwing knives . 
  there is a lot of customization , do n't worry . 
  xd , i hope to live there too one day . 
  i know live in holland but i want to live in krakow as soon as i finish university , 
  no more pics sadly , although i know that the jaguar was piloted by a polish pilot . 
  if ww3 would ever happen , he would be part of a polish army within nato , that would be used to persue soldiers of communist poland join nato . 
  i also went to warsaw solo for 3 days these things i would certainly do :, 
  - ** warsaw rising museum ** - a absolute must to understand the city and it 's people . 
  85 % of warsaw was destroyed during ww2 , including almost 100 % of all historical monuments , buildings etc. 
  so keep in mind that places like the old town and the royal palace may look old , but are in fact no older than ~ 65 years . 
  ** - visit the old town and it 's surroundings ** - it may not be older than aprox . 
  65 years but it is still the social , cultural and historical centre of the city . 
  there are many things to see and do . 
  two tips from me would be : ** lapidarium ** , verry interesting store with lots of antiques and collectibles and try out one of the ** zapiecek ** restaurants . 
  they serve some of the most delicious polish dumplings !, 
  ( there are like 4 restaurants in the old town , you will surely find it . ), 
  - ** go to the top of the palace of science & culture ** - for a ticket that costs aprox . 
  12 pln and be bought at the main entrance , you can go with a elevator to the top to see a beautiful panorama of the city . 
  do n't forget to bring a camera !, 
  - ** visit royal \u0141azienki park ** - it 's a verry nice park to get away from the big city and it 's the most popular one in warsaw . 
  those are some , but * certainly * not all the places , that i would absolutely recommend .
