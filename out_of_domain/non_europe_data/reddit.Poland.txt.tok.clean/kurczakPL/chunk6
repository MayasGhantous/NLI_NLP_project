  glad someone points this out . 
  i live in holland and i would really like to live in poland after my study . 
  when asking for advice i always get comments calling me metally insane because i would like to live there . 
  c'mon people it 's not like it 's not like everybody is struggling to live another day . 
  people have cars , homes , clothing and are able to buy luxury items . 
  yes it 's less than in western europe , but not as bad as some try to make it out to be . 
  slavic languages and cultures with polish as main language . 
  you should cover those white walls with the stone that can be seen in the first picture . 
  would look real cool, 
  hmm strange ca n't find it . 
  i do n't want the rgb , red is just fine , 
  i live in holland and there is no store at all that sells them anymore . 
  i searched for hours but ca n't find anything . 
  i 'm now thinking of buying brown ones as i think the blue ones are not comming back any time soon and browns are probably the most resembling to blue 's . 
  i considered another keyboard with blue 's but the k70 is just too perfect , 
  forgot to say that the k70 gaming is available with mx blue but i have a real problem with the tramp stamp logo , may sound childish but it 's still quite a lot of money ;p, 
  downgrade or not , this is just one of the best-looking games ever made . 
  not only the pure graphics but also the fact that npc 's and monster do n't just wait for you to interact with them , but have a ` life ' of their own . 
  it 's polish , 
  militaria.pl , it has stores in nearly every medium/big city and has a considerable amount of airsoft equipment . 
  you will probably not find a real polish uniform there but there are plenty of smaller stores with uniforms . 
  it depends whether you 'll be visiting a big or small city but the price will be around ~ 60 eur for the uniform . 
  i 'll be studying slavic language and culture with polish as main language at the university of amsterdam ( i live in holland but polish ancestors :p ) do n't listen too much to people who think that you wo n't be able too find a job . 
  just do what you think is right and it will eventually work out , 
  we love you too < 3, 
  what ? 
  poland is part of the west . 
  no , western culture and society is n't perfect but it is by far the best compared to cummunism and fascism, 
  yeag when i google zaba bagnet , i got a few pictures of the leather holster that comes with a bayonet . 
  it would check out . 
  this picture was taken during the warsaw uprising in 1944 ; the biggest military operation of any resistance in ww2 . 
  this picture was colored as part of a movie that exclusively used authentic ww2 material . 
  here 's a trailer [ eng ] : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crmdnnyd41u, 
  at 0:41 you can see the shot of the 2 insurgents . 
  this was quite common during the warsaw uprising . 
  children as young as 5 years old where part of the underground army , mostly serving with the ` grey ranks ' , the ` youth organization ' within the polish underground army : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gray_ranks the delivered post mail and used the sewers for communication and transportation . 
  children where treated the same as adults by the nazi 's and thus many of them died during the uprising . 
  there were so many of them and they where so vital that they are verry well known and have their own statue in the centre of warsaw : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/pomnik_ma%c5%82ego_powsta%c5%84ca_w_warszawie.jpg, 
  pleassee tell me whether the army is worth it . 
  i ` am really considering a military carreer in poland ( i live in holland now , but want to move to poland after i finish my study ) . 
  i will be beginning a study at the university , will i be able to begin a officers study in poland after that or can i become an officer through a shorter course ? 
  i speak fluently dutch , very good english and am studying polish right now ( na razie moje popolsku jest kiepsko :p ), 
  lastly , is live in poland really as bad as most people make it out be be ? 
  will a military carreer be able to pay the bills ? 
  i do n't expect a top salary , just modest enough to pay for a decent living . 
  thanks for your time , i do n't expect you to give me the exact answers , just some indication would be nice , 
  i suffer from pollen allergies , will this be a big problem ? 
  i do n't feel a \u00e7onnection between me and the netherlands/the dutch . 
  i got no interest in the dutch army and would not be so willing to put my life on the line for it . 
  poland on the other hand is my passion and polish military and history are the most interesting things for me personally . 
  i 'm not hating on the netherlands , but for me the polish forces are a real passion , 
  thanks for the answers !, 
  i ` am starting a 4 year study of polish language and culture at the university in amsterdam , so my polish should be on a good level after that , i will also be taking extra language courses besides my study . 
  i have zero intent to join the dutch army , for me it is the polish one or no one , the polish army and it 's history is just a huge passion for me . 
  it 's also nice to hear that you can make a decent living of a military carreer in poland . 
  poles always give me horror stories about the bad economical situation in the country , but i just ca n't spot it myself when i am in poland . 
  yes there are some better roads and maybe some other things in western europe , but the difference is not near as huge as people make it out to be . 
  i may not live in poland myself but i visit the country 3 times a year for several weeks and to me personally it does n't look that bad at all . 
  i allready watch the naszaarmia youtube channel , it verry interesting and gives a good look into the military . 
  i really like it a lot !, 
  thanks again for all the answers !, 
  edit : a word, 
  yes , you make less money , but money is n't equal to happiess . 
  for me poland and everything polish is my passion , whether it is as big as the country 's history or just something simple like a small rural village . 
  i would verry much like to persue this passion . 
  even if it means that i will earn a third of what i could earn in holland . 
  for me personally most things are better in poland than in holland , expect for the pay  but money is by * far * not the only thing that can bring joy to one 's live . 
  i am also planning on immigrating to poland after my study . 
  pay will be shit compared to holland , but money is n't the only thing that can make a person happy and satisfied , 
  it 's verry nice to see this type of transparency . 
  ahh , the good old days , 
  1 ) ** iran : ** it 's a country we mostly hear about in a negative sense . 
  whether it is its atom program or the strict muslim law . 
  on the other hand it 's quite well known that iran and particular it 's population are really developed and have a verry interesting culture and history . 
  there will be almost no poles who are fond of your government but all poles will be verry happy to meet a ` average ' iranian , 
  ** usa : ** it is seen as a important military ally . 
  the americans have stronger opinion when it comes to putin , rather than the more ` soft ' aproach of most eu countries . 
  america will probably give poland a lot more military aid and a lot faster than the eu countries when shit hits the fan . 
  besides that poles have played a important role in us history ( tadeusz ko\u015bciuszko ) and there is still a really big polish community in the states , especially in chicago . 
  there are however mixed feelings about the involvement in the arab world ... 
  ** russia : ** yeah where to start ... ** tl ; tr not all to positive  ** poland has been a country for more than 1000 years and during that time the have been * numerous * conflicts between it and the russians . 
  it 's easier to learn nuclear physics than it is to learn the complex relation between poland and russia . 
  the polish mindset is hugely influenced by history and the two countries never got along all to good to say the least . 
  the russian empire , soviet union and now putin 's russia have always been our biggest enemy 's and it does n't seem like it will change any time soon . 
  both countries even have a national holiday in which they remember a victory against the other country . 
  poland : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armed_forces_day_ ( poland ), 
  russia : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unity_day_ ( russia ), 
  some of he most significant events in that influenced polish-russian relations are these :, 
  ** the polish muscovite war of 1605-1618 ** , verry important is the polish occupation of moscow in 1612 although some russian history books still deny or nuance it . 
  ** the polish-soviet war in 1920 ** that was won by poland and stopped the soviet ambition to conquer europe . 
  ** the combined german and russian invasion in 1939 ** . 
  russia always profiles itself as the ` savior ' of europe from fascism , but fails to remember the soviet-nazi pact . 
  ** the katyn massacre ** in which 20.000 of the most high ranking polish military personnel , scholars , priests , lawyers and other important members of polish society where executed to essentially ` decapitate ' the polish nation to reduse the chance of a uprising because there where no leaders for the people to rally behind . 
  ** 45 year of communist rule in poland ** . 
  shortly after the war former resistance fighters like witold pileczki http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/38g8h9 where killed and the communist authorities silenced any resistance against communism by killing or locking up people who openly criticised the government . 
  45 years of communism left a bad taste in the mouth of the polish people and they will not forget it anytime soon , especially with putin in power . 
  2 ) winter if you really want that christmas feeling , otherwise i would strongly recommend may-august . 
  the weather is verry nice and it gives you the perfect conditions to explore the city 's . 
  many festivals and cultural events also take place in the summer . 
  3 ) krakow is the most popular city for good reasons .
