  it survived ww2 , has a huge old town and a verry interesting jewish neighbourhood and lies in the vincinity of auschwitz , wieliczka salt mine and zakopane . 
  besides being the cultural and medieval-renaissance historical centre of poland it also has the most bars and clubs per square km in the whole world . 
  other excellent cities are warsaw with it 's incredibly rebuild old town and verry interesting history concerning ww2 and the city of gdansk with it 's also spectecular old town and with a lot of history when it comes to the anti-communist movement during the cold-war plus it was a verry important trade city during the renaissance . 
  it 's also connected to the festival-and-beach city of sopot and the smaller port city of gdynia . 
  edit : spelling, 
  ewa farna was born in the czech republic , but as part of a polish minority close to the polish border . 
  she knows both languages but consideres herself polish . 
  i see that kalingrad became independent . 
  good to say that , 
  uhm poland will take that land , for this will be the first step in reuniting and expanding the commonwealth !, 
   he also told me he was lucky not being deployed on the eastern front and that those soldiers suffered from more nightmares due to having fought partisans who were more like an invisible enemy , making them more paranoid, 
  i 'm verry interested in polish partisans and resistance fighters and i always wondered about the german reaction to them . 
  when you hear about the easter front it is mostly about the soviets , while huge resistance movements like the polish underground army ( 1 million people stron at their peak ) fought the germans while being disguised as civilians . 
  at the front you could at least tell friend from foo , while every resident in occupied city 's could carry a gun and kill you without you ever knowing what happend . 
  this must really have been a psychological torture for soldiers patroling occupied city 's or forests , knowing that death could be luring around every corner ... 
  yeah , tanks where quite slow at the time and lacked in firepower . 
  the trains where fast and extremely heavy armed and armored compared to the ft-17 's that where used by the polish army . 
  i 've seen posters and memorabilia in several polish railway stations in poland where they are praised for their effectiveness in the polish-soviet war . 
  yes , it seemed like he was n't sure whether it would be such a good idea to kill off the people because of their believe 's and sexual orientation . 
  it 's verry hard for me to feel compassion for him when he says things like ` the soviet union never attacked anyone ' and ` ukraine is just an outskirt of russia ' while the soviets murdered and raped in my own country ( poland ) . 
  but i think that deep inside he knows that taking care of his family should be more important than fighting for putin 's ideas . . 
  the animals that participate in events like this or bullfighting are carefully chosen and are almost worshiped as ` holy ' . 
  they get the best food and the best living circumstances . 
  yes , they die a painfull death , but their live have been many times better than that of ordinary bulls who are held in small cages and die as soon as they are big enough for the meat , if they are n't allready killed when they where born , because males are not wanted in the industry ... 
  edit : some words, 
  what is the bolt-action weapon at 27:13 ? 
  thanks , 
  thanks man !, 
  you do n't get to see bolt-actions as much now . 
  are they still more accurate than their semi-auto counterparts or has this allready been overcome ? 
  are there maybe any other pro 's to bolt action ? 
  did they rebuild the city ? 
  i visit warsaw frequently and the city has really managed to get back its former glory , especially after communism . 
  the thing that strikes me most is that buildings are being build in the pre-war style ; the whole old city centre was reconstructed and now more and more areas of warsaw are getting their pre 1939 style buildings back . 
  unlike for example berlin where destroyed medieval buildings where never rebuild . 
  edit : a word, 
  nice to hear about manila being rebuild . 
  the japanese occupation was indeed very brutal , although it does n't get as much attention as it deserves . 
  be very happy with the stories you heard . 
  they may be brutal , but they are the stories of someone who experienced it first hand . 
  not many people get the chance to hear these stories from a real survivor . 
  nice !, 
  i have been to many battleground myself , in poland . 
  it 's so fascinating to be in a street that you know from photos from ww2 . 
  it almost feels like you are part of it . 
  i can imagine that there could be some real untouched treasures in filipino woods , bunkers and fortifications that have not been touched in 75 years . 
  hey , i 'll be visiting gdansk soon for 3 days . 
  could you give some good places to visit while i 'm there ? 
  and is it easy to get from gdansk to sopot and gdynia ? 
  thanks , 
  hi sir !, 
  you impacted the lives of millions of people all around the world . 
  some in a small but others in a very big way . 
  do you feel like it has affected you , if yes , in what way ? 
  greetings from poland !, 
  your acting is great !, 
  do n't worry !, 
  we are a western , civilized country , you 'll be fine . 
  you will only get problems if you are looking for them , like visiting the very worst neighborhood in the city . 
  some curious looks will be the worst you 'll get . 
  please enjoy your stay , and remember we are not russia !, 
  warsaw would be a better choice , poznan is also great but if you can choose i would go warsaw . 
  do n't forget to visit :, 
  - ** warsaw rising museum ** - a absolute must to understand the city and it 's people . 
  85 % of warsaw was destroyed during ww2 , including almost 100 % of all historical monuments , buildings etc. 
  so keep in mind that places like the old town and the royal palace may look old , but are in fact no older than ~ 65 years . 
  - ** visit the old town and it 's surroundings ** - it may not be older than aprox . 
  65 years but it is still the social , cultural and historical centre of the city . 
  there are many things to see and do . 
  two tips from me would be : lapidarium , verry interesting store with lots of antiques and collectibles and try out one of the zapiecek restaurants . 
  they serve some of the most delicious polish dumplings !, 
  ( there are like 4 restaurants in the old town , you will surely find it . ), 
  http://www.zapiecek.eu/main.html http://www.lapidarium.pl/index.php, 
  ** - go to the top of the palace of science & culture ** - for a ticket that costs aprox . 
  12 pln and be bought at the main entrance , you can go with a elevator to the top to see a beautiful panorama of the city . 
  do n't forget to bring a camera !, 
  - ** visit royal \u0141azienki park ** - it 's a verry nice park to get away from the big city and it 's the most popular one in warsaw . 
  those are some , but certainly not all the places , that i would absolutely recommend . 
  nice to hear , i will be going to krakow next saturday for 2 weeks . 
  it will be my ~ 35 time . 
  i have exactly the same question as you . 
  i always try to visiting as much as possible , but i need to find more of the beaten path places to visit . 
  personally i would recommend nowa huta and the surrounding area . 
  my family lives nearby and i am there on a daily bases when i visit my family . 
  go see the nowa huta steel plant , the ronald reagan square and experience some history . 
  it is n't well known but it 's full of history . 
  my best advice is : * just go hop on a random bus/bike and hop out at some random place or drive through the rural land . 
  * you will certainly always see something new and interesting . 
  especially the rural area is * beautiful !, 
  * got to the tyniec monastery on bike . 
  it 's amazing how rural it can be so close to the city . 
  you grew up in poland ? 
  i love the market and the local stores . 
  i still hope the paint the last remaining grey streets though . 
  the ronald reagan square could be left in it 's original state but the other streets really need some paint and renovations , but i always see them working on it so that 's a good thing . 
  you mean zalew park ? 
  i come there often . 
  i will surely try those balls out with my niece , should be fun !, 
  the lake really needed some extra 's, 
  yes i know that sentence sounds wrong ,
