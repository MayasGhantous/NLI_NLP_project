  yeah my father who is dutch but has been travelling to poland says that poland has changed more in 25 years than the netherlands did in a 100 years , it 's unbelievable . 
  i also saw that many soviet-era building in warsaw where being replaced by building in pre-war style , even outside the city center . 
  it 's nice that not only the communist blocks are being removed/renovated but that there is also a real effort to bring back pre-war typical polish architecture . 
  i 'm not a big fan of all glass and concrete ` modern ' style buildings , 
  yeah we are talking about the same lake  . 
  many people do n't obey that rule , i see people swimming in the lake on a daily bases in the summer , although the water does n't look all to clean . 
  edit : your site is really nice , keep up the good work !, 
  i thought i have seen almost everything in krak\u00f3w but this site showed my that i barely scratched the surface . 
  i 'm so hyped for my next trip this saturday , thank you !, 
  is n't it like ` depressing ' to work in such a closed cube without colleagues in sight ? 
  i 'm just a european college student so i have no clue about us working conditions , but is this common ? 
  i 've seen it in american movies and tv shows but did n't knew they really ` existed ' in such a way . 
  it sure is different than the more open european offices ( although this ofc . 
  really differs per country ), 
  edit : sweet setup though , 
  yeah , that light looks like the worst kind possible , just so ... unnatural . 
  maybe you could block it and buy one of those natural light lamps or something like that . 
  cool though that you can just switch between working at the office and working at home . 
  i hear that it is famous for their more laid back kind of approach and giving you the freedom to for example customize your pc like that . 
  i would not be able to do that at my financial office job . 
  incredibly sad , but very common during the uprising . 
  hitler ordered his troops to kill al inhabitants of warsaw , even woman and children . 
  because of that many children joined the underground army in the ` grey ranks ' . 
  they where mostly responsible for carying massages acros different liberated parts of the city using the sewers , but also took part in fighting when it was absolutely neccesary . 
  there are many monuments made especially for those children who died during the uprising . 
  some of russia 's most influential people want to just outright destroy the other slavic cultures and countries so they can be ` united ' under a russian-led pan-slavic nation . 
  it 's really bothering that such ideas are highly supported in a country with nuclear capabilities . 
  the book ` foundation of geopolitics ' is verry influencial within the russian military and talks about anexing half of europe and trying to force western-europe to abandon it 's relations with the usa . 
  russians make shit teammates . 
  remembering that money and happiness/succes are two seperate things . 
  the universe . 
  everything we know has something ` bigger ' : country-continent-earth-space . 
  but what is ` outside ' the universe . 
  is there something ` outside ' of our space ? 
  is our universe like a box with a border or is it infinite , but how can something be infinite ? 
  it 's just such a strang thing . . 
  i live in holland and would * really * like to move to poland after i finish my study . 
  things like this give me the chills though ... 
  have you ever seen japenese people kiss in porn ? 
  i 've never seen a stranger way of kissing , they just stick their tongues out and violently lick and suck the other one 's tongue . 
  they go alot ` further ' than western porn kissing . 
  man , i just turned 20 and have yet too see any kind of action , no kissing or sex . 
  can be a real pain in the ass when all your friends etc. 
  have girlfriends and are getting all the action the want : /, 
  i live in holland and walking down the streets of amsterdam just makes me puke !, 
  besides , i do n't see why someone would use it . 
  it 's * super * bad for your health , costs alot of money , and can get you quickly addicted . 
  why go through all that trouble just to get high ? 
  do n't you have a better way to spent your money time and health on ? 
  seems to me you have quite a shitty life if you need weed to enjoy yourself . 
  i 've never been there but i imagine it being really shalow . 
  no culture , no history , everything revolvs about money and people are just so materalistic . 
  to me it just seems like everyting is ` fake ' and it 's just a playground for the rich . 
  2 . no experience, 
  3 . no experience, 
  i 'm going on a trip with my friend next week . 
  we will be visiting 3 city 's : gdansk-warsaw-krakow ( zakopane , auschwitz and wieliczka as daytrips from krakow ) . 
  it brings us from the sea in the most northern part of poland to the southern border in zakopane and gives us the oppertunity to visit the big city 's and their surrounding nature . 
  if you are going to visit these city 's i would suggest traveling by train . 
  when booked on time tickets for the new high-speed train can cost you just 50 pln ( ~ 12 euros ) for 2nd class seats . 
  this train does however only ride between those 3 city 's but other trains and even busses ( polskibus ) are a good option . 
  thanks !, 
  it 's really uplifting to hear your story . 
  i 'm not depressed or shit like that because i am currently missing out on action , but it can indeed be frustrating at times , especially at family meetings :p still i do n't plan on rushing things just to get some action . 
  i would really like to have my first experience with someone i 'm truly comfortable with . 
  rushing it with the person will just make me regret my choices , plus , it 's not like i 'm dying because of a lack of action , 
  by not dying, 
  my poo is . 
  schindlers list , the girl in red scene . 
  ` miasto 44 ' incredible polish movie . 
  masturbate violently to assert my dominance in the working space . 
  hey man !, 
  ai n't got the subtitles but could you maybe share them with me if you get them ? 
  dutch or english does n't matter , i speak both , 
  i do seriously check wheather my eyes are vicible behind thwm before i go on the streets in poland , 
  how was the transition ? 
  i would really like to move to poland after i finish my study but people keep telling me i 'm crazy because of the low wages . 
  yes , wages will be worse but for me personally everything besides the financial stuff is better in poland . 
  i speak mothertongue dutch , good english and am working on my polish . 
  i will study slavic languages and cultures with polish as main language beggining this year . 
  it will not make me rich but will it really be that hard to maintain a moderate lifestyle ? 
  is the average pole really as poor as they make themselfs out to be ? 
  i am * really * motivated to move to poland but things like this can really get me down at times . 
  hours of footage from the uprising has been colored and the sound and voices have been replicated . 
  this was done for the movie ` powstanie warszawskie ' that came out last year . 
  the entire movie is made out of original footage with the new coloring and sound . 
  the movie follows the uprising from the perspective of two ficticional brothers who are trying to document the uprising . 
  truly one of the best films ever made if you are in to history . 
  the story , colour , and sound brings you * so * much more closer to the people in the movie . 
  i have the dvd and it has english subs so if you 're in poland or could order one from a polish shop that ships to your country , you 'll be good . 
  otherwise you could maybe get it from a torrent site . 
  i do n't want to promote illegal downloading but if you do n't have acces to a store you should really get it from there . 
  you realy have to see it , especially if you have family who participated in the uprising . 
  hey !, 
  i 'll be making exactly the same trip in 2 days , only difference is that i 'll spend just 10 days in poland . 
  i 've never visited gdansk before but can still give you tips , i 've been to warsaw once for 3 days and i visit krakow around 2-3 times a year so i 'm like an expert on that city ;p, 
  i 'll give name the city 's in the order in which i 'll be visiting them so i do n't know wheather this will match your plans because i 'll be flying from eindoven , holland but you just switch them in the order you 'll we visiting them . 
  i would recommend to travel between these cities by train . 
  the new ** express intercity premium ** line ( ** eip or pendolino ** ) drives between the 3 cities and takes no more than 3 hours to bring you from gdansk to warsaw and from warsaw to krakow . 
  i myself chose to take the last trains from gdansk and later on from warsaw .
