  they leave at aprox . 
  20:00 from gdansk glowny and warszawa centralna and give you the opportunity to spent the day in the city . 
  be sure though to book your tickets early as the trains are quite popular . 
  i booked them 2 weeks in advance and was able to buy each ticket for only ** 50 pln ( ~ 15 usd ) for 2nd class seats ** . 
  here you can buy your tickets : http://www.intercity.pl/en/ ( pendolino train is clearly marked as eip ), 
  you could also travel by bus ( polskibus ) but it will take longer and is less comfortable . 
  tickets can be bought here : http://www.polskibus.com/en, 
  the city is mostly referred to as the tricity region . 
  this means the city gdansk , the party and festival city of sopot and the port city of gdynia . 
  - be sure to check out ** the old town , st. mary 's church , the long lane , the long market ** which are all located in or around the old centre .

  - visit ** sopot ** and ** gdynia ** . 
  sopot is famous because it hosts a lot of national music festivals and has a great night life . 
  gdynia is home to a part of the polish fleet and very important for trade . 
  ** warsaw : ** the polish capital and political as well as financial heart of poland . 
  the most destroyed city in the entire world during ww2 ( ~ 90 % of all buildings and ~ 99 % of all monuments and historical buildings ) but largely rebuild afterwards , especially in the past 25 years . 
  - the most important part of your visit to this city is the ** warsaw uprising museum ** . 
  you need to visit this to understand the city , it 's people and the whole country in general . 
  the uprising is still an open wound in the hearts of poles and symbolises the loyalty of poles towards their country and fellow poles . 
  be sure to also buy the ticket for the short movie ' ** miasto ruin ** ' when buying your ticket for the museum entrance . 
  it 's really worth the few extra pln and try to maybe ** make a donation at the entrance or buy something from the souvenir shop ** , it 's what keeps the museum open  . 
  also try to make this one of your first things to visit . 
  you 'll be more impressed by how the city has transformed and how close it came to the point of utter destruction . 
  - visit the ** stare miasto ( old town ) , royal palace ** and the ** krakowskie przedmie\u015bcie ** although completely destroyed after the uprising it was later rebuilt using paintings , old photo 's and other pictures and documents to replicate it a 100 % . 
  they did a extremely good job and the buildings really look original and not just 70 years old . 
  - visit the ** palace of culture and science ** . 
  a ` gift ' of stalin from the soviet people the the polish people . 
  it was made entirely by soviet workers ( of which 16 died during the process ) after the war and was the tallest building in poland for the next decades , and is still the highest clocktower in europe . 
  after the fall of communism there was fierce discussion about the fate of the building . 
  it was seen as a symbol of soviet oppression but also had a significant historical value . 
  it was eventually not demolished and other skyscrapers were built near it so it would n't be as prominent anymore . 
  people still refer to it as ` stalin 's penis ' and is still subject to discussion . 
  when you enter the main entrance you can buy a ticket with which you can ** take the lift to the panorama view point ** which will give you an excellent view of the city and its surroundings . 
  - visit the ** army museum ** if you 're interested in military history . 
  it has some really nice pieces , even a capsule that was used in a spoetnik space mission .

  - visit the ** \u0141azienki park ** with the famous chopin monument . 
  - eat at a ** ` zapiecek ' restaurant ** to get some of the best pierogy you will ever get . 
  the have restaurants in the old town and are recognisable by the leaflets they give out and the traditional dresses worn by the girls that work there . 
  - go to a ** ` bar mleczny ' ** . 
  this can apply to every city you 'll visit . 
  these ` milk bars ' where subsidised restaurants that were meant for the poor during the socialist times . 
  now they offer good traditional food for just a fraction of the price you pay at a restaurant . 
  you have to buy your food at the cashier after which you 'll likely be given a number after which you just wait for your number to show up or be announced and you can get your food . 
  it 's a really good way to get a ** good warm lunch for no money !, 
  ** krakow : ** the former capital of poland is the heart of polish culture and education . 
  unlike most polish cities it survived ww2 quite unscafed and is therefore the most important medieval/renaissance city in poland . 
  you 'll notice the lack of skyscraper ; they are banned in order to preserve the medieval skyline of krakow . 
  this city is considered the most beautiful of poland and is the biggest tourist hub . 
  i would recommend to make this your longest stay out of the 3 cities . 
  - explore the ** old city ** through the ** royal route ** . 
  begin at the ** barbakan ** , go through the ** florian gate ** along and walk along ** florianska street ** to the ** rynek ** . 
  here you can visit the ** cloth hall , the museum underneath it , restaurants , bars ** and much more !, 
  than you make your way to the ** wawel castle ** by following ** grodzka street ** from the rynek . 
  go up the wawel hill and enter the ** royal castle ** . 
  you can here buy various tickets to things like the ** royal armory , the royal tombs and to see vermeer 's painting ` girl with a pearl earring ' ** . 
  the wawel symbolizes polish independence and sovereignty . 
  at the foot of the hill , on the wisla side you can find a fire breathing statue of a dragon . 
  the legends say he lived in a cave underneath the wawel castle , you can visit the cave for a small fee . 
  - visit the ** kazimierz district ** . 
  this is the old jewish town , made famous by the movie ` schindler 's list ' . 
  - go for a ** walk along the wisla ** . 
  it 's a verry popular place for the local youth . 
  here you can experience socialism like nowhere else in poland . 
  it 's easily accessible by tram . 
  i would * stronly * advice you to take a daytrip to the following 3 places . 
  they are easily accessible by bus from the the krakow main station , make sure to check departure times at least a day before you go because you 'll have to get up early . 
  ** - daytrip 1 , zakopane : ** this is the mountain capital of poland . 
  ** get up early !, 
  ** try to take the bus around ** 7:00 in the morning ** . 
  the drive takes 2 hours but can be twice as long if you do n't go early enough and get stuck in traffic around zakopane . 
  the tockets to zakopane can be bought from the driver and normally cost 15 pln . 
  in zakopane you should certainly go up gubalowka mount with the special little mountain train . 
  here you will get the best view of zakopane and the mountain peaks . 
  you can grab some lunch and take a walk before heading back down again . 
  when you return in zakopane you should check out the local market and head further into the city . 
  in the evening you should visit one of the many traditional restaurants that feature a live folklore band . 
  if you visit early you could also start by taking one of the many minibuses to ** kuznice ** ( 5 min drive/3pln ) from where you can take a cablelift to the top of kasprowy wierch ( 1987m / 50pln ) . 
  this should not take very long if you make visit early in the morning ( before 10:00 / 11:00 ) . 
  you could stay here for one night if you have the time . 
  you 'll have time to take things slower and wo n't have to worry about being in time for the last bus to krakow ( which leaves around 20:00 ) i strongly recommend to stay for one night if you have the opportunity !, 
  - ** daytrip 2 , auschwitz/oswiecim ** : you can take on of the many busses from krakow central station that say auschwitz or oswiecim ( polish ) . 
  it costs around 15 pln and the drive takes about an hour . 
  tickets can be bought from the driver . 
  you should visit the museums webpage for opening hours and english guides . 
  auschwitz is heavily advertised in krakow but you 'll pay far too much for those organised tours .
