did anyone read other examples of companies ` wasting ' money ? 
  according to the article 's author , asda ` wastes ' # 35m or so by letting their employees use the toilet for number 2 . 
  this is the stupidest thing i 've heard and i hope it 's a joke . 
  giving people the rights to perform their natural functions while at work is not wasting money , it 's simply being civilised . 
  i heard , however , that the efficiency comes at the cost of shortened engine lifetime . 
  it 'll be interesting to see whether this evaluates to true . 
  while it 's an attempt to retain a good memory for sharing with others , i agree completely that it completely diminishes the experience and people just do n't live in the moment because of that . 
  if i want to capture some cool moments , i 'll make a few seconds long video and then put the phone down and enjoy the moment . 
  is this why you 're commenting in threads mostly to do with russia and spreading russian propaganda ? 
  poland was never content on the issue . 
  the wreckage should 've been turned over ages ago . 
  `` but the mep said ` associate citizenship ' should be offered to britons regardless of any reciprocal offer or concession made by the uk . '', 
  what a completely ridiculous stipulation . 
  just why should britons get a special status over eu citizens ? 
  are you implying that eu citizens are somehow not net contributors to the uk 's economy ? 
  i second the notion that this is n't going to happen and as an eu citizen , i 'll oppose this in every way i can . 
  i 'm going to assume op meant lecturers in general . 
  anyway , in the ideal world , yes , lecturers only teach subjects which they had studied for years . 
  in reality , they are sometimes asked to take over completely unrelated subjects because such is the need , so the notion of being qualified to teach certain modules disappears . 
  well , you asked why it should be fair , so the implication was that eu citizens would not get a reciprocal privilege , i.e. 
  they would n't be able to come and work in the uk . 
  giving the british some sort of special status on migration to eu countries but not allowing eu citizens to the uk is not fair and having this model in place would probably give wind to eu skeptic movements in eu countries , which is bad enough . 
  also , the way brexit is shaping up , the working class in the uk may find it even more difficult to live than they do now , so perhaps a portion of that population would desire to relocate to an eu country at some point in the future . 
  this goes against the working assumption that only educated and skilled uk citizens would be migrating to the eu . 
  i agree that on the face of it it may seem unreasonable . 
  however , democracy entails the flaw that it is not always based on what is objectively optimal but rather on emotion and current sentiment among the voting population . 
  as it is now , there 's a surge in euroskepticism . 
  such agreements that may create this perception of special treatment for the british or countries outside the eu in general , whereby they would have an option to migrate to the eu but not the other way around , could fuel euroskepticism further . 
  here 's a crazy theory : in the light of this , what is the chance that the russian administration would covertly ` facilitate ' ( i.e. 
  fund or otherwise motivate ) a successful terrorist attack in france before the elections just so le pen would win ? 
  i currently have mixed to negative feelings about the porn industry . 
  i ca n't speak for all countries obviously , but the one in which i underwent sex-ed , it simply did not address porn in any capacity at all . 
  it 's actually quite important because overuse of porn has been attributed to a number of negative psychological effects . 
  i would n't go as far as to ban all porn all of a sudden and frankly , i think it 's the wrong approach as it would only help to marginalize people that would continue watching it by bypassing the system . 
  i do think , however , that sex-ed desperately needs to catch up and teach young people about the risks of porn and how to ` use it ' responsibly . 
  frequent usage which may result in developing an addiction to it would be one example . 
  using it to educate oneself about sex would be another . 
  sorry dude , but you changed lanes in the middle of a junction - you 're totally in the wrong . 
  what did i miss ? 
  it 's deleted now :(, 
  you 're in the right place to learn the ropes . 
  elaborate please ? 
  graphs are just an abstract data structure for representing data and relationships between that data . 
  if in your graph the edges do not represent any sort of relationships between the nodes and all you want to show is just that one node can be reached at all , then i guess you can . 
  i ca n't think of a real world example in which you would use a graph in this way though . 
  not long ago i was commenting on a related issue - an article pointed out that `` asda ** waste ** on average # 33,500,160 letting employees do a no . 
  interestingly , no one in the thread about the article picked up on this completely absurd stipulation : https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/5gmlkg/the_uk_government_wastes_49_billion_in_tax/, 
  i 'm finding degiro to be pretty good . 
  very cheap , execution only . 
  i wo n't go to subway again until they stop doing this . 
  i think an interesting area that already proved somewhat controversial and is even the central theme of one game - transhumanism . 
  it 's the idea that we can develop and transplant artificial organs , but it gets very interesting once you realise that you can do this not only to provide working organs , but also to basically ** augment ** a human body . 
  i guess this area is at the intersection of comp sci , robotics and ai so you could write about this . 
  i 've always found the topic interesting because of the potential psychological and social implications . 
  hello . 
  as can be heard in the video , there is a very loud clicking noise coming from the engine and i 'm at a loss as to what may be the source . 
  i adjusted the valves but the problem did n't go away . 
  any ideas what may be the cause ? 
  thanks in advance . 
  ** update ** : i 've investigated the cam chain and it seems loose in one place . 
  i 'm not sure if this level of slack is likely to be causing this knocking noise , so i recorded and uploaded a video [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/05ai5pql_hs ) . 
  i checked to make sure , all cylinders are firing . 
  thanks , i will check this soon . 
  did you have a similar issue or is it just a sound that you 're familiar with ? 
  had tightened all the spark plugs , so that 's out of the question . 
  thanks for input though , 
  hey , i checked the cam belt and it seems loose in one place , but i 'm not sure if this is it . 
  is this way too loose ? 
  if so , do i need to replace the cam chain tensioner in addition to the cam chain ? 
  i 'm really not sure - there 's no slack in any other position . 
  it 's so bad . 
  one time i saw two fuckers in my backyard looking for my motorbike at 6am on a sunday , i chased them away . 
  on another occasion , my gf had her scooter stolen from right in front of my bedroom window . 
  had my bicycle stolen , confronted a burglar on yet another occasion ... 
  theft is unbelievably rampant in the uk and the police is absolutely useless in tackling this . 
  does n't matter that cctv is everywhere , it 's owned by city councils so the police does n't even bother to request footage in case of theft because they always have ` bigger fish to fry ' . 
  i have n't used anything like that on my bike apart from two disc locks , but i imagine if you can conceal it well then i guess so . 
  better invest money into not getting your things stolen in the first place though . 
  i bought american stocks when gbp to usd was at 1.21 . 
  of course usd has been depreciating since , effectively cancelling out my stocks gains . 
  it seems to have slowed down now a bit though . 
  admit it . 
  you wo n't look at it again . 
  i listened to the audio through to the end . 
  it was fascinating and terrifying . 
  i was very impressed by the level of coordination and calm among the other captains coming to help , even when it became clear that the ship actually sank . 
  very interesting , thanks . 
  now that you said it yeah , i remember that line . 
  good point . 
  thanks , you write very well by the way , 
  it 's not the throughput that 's the problem , it 's the delay between your computer sending input from peripherals to the server receiving it and sending the ingame response back . 
  anything above a few milliseconds will affect the gameplay unfortunately . 
  you 'd need a very well distributed server infrastructure to cater to a wide gaming community and it 's just not economically viable . 
  there was a cloud gaming company called onlive , which i used to play several games . 
  it was neat but the lag was too noticeable , you could really only play games that did n't require fast reaction times . 
  it went under a few years from going live , afaik . 
  ha that 's an interesting one . 
  perhaps one approach could be to parse the sentence to extract the subject , predicate and object and use those to formulate a sparql query which you could plug into a sparql endpoint at dbpedia or another semantic web db and parse the response to verify the truth value of that sentence ? 
  i 'm not sure how well the above would work in practice though . 
  guess it 's all down to the implementation .
