  what they consider to be journalism does not meet any type of journalistic standards, 
  i think you should reread the entire paper carefully , it addresses all of what you mention, 
  yes , there are books written on the topic . 
  read one, 
  okay, 
  i think this is exactly what this subreddit could use . 
  i think sometimes this subreddit gets bogged down in complaints about reddit rather than the actual `` theory '' of reddit . 
  i 'd like to see what your findings are . 
  why ? 
  seems like he does n't really know what this community is and was just seeing if it was appropriate to post it here , but idk, 
  that 's how the left makes there living , unfortunately, 
  b b b but ... she * said * he attacked her !, 
  this evidence is sexist !, 
  you probably believe in white privilege too, 
  you probably believe in white privilege too, 
  you can use your imagination . 
  i 'll stick to using statistics at not blaming society for every problem i encounter, 
  #you probably believe in white privilege too . 
  woman ? 
  check, 
  stupid gay friend ? 
  check, 
  blacks ? 
  check, 
  spewing liberal bullshit ? 
  check, 
  white male doing something wrong ? 
  check, 
  modern liberalism folks . 
  what 's not to like !, 
  how dare anyone make a joke about * my * hillary, 
  edgy . 
  nice . 
  you actually believe in white privilege ? 
  or were you being sarcastic, 
  you 're improving, 
  cruz does n't support pledge - well he 's just being confident, 
  trump does n't support pledge - literally hitler mysoginist, 
  this subreddit and the media are just getting obnoxious now, 
  you brought up the race issue , not i, 
  the dems are the ones with a racist and sexist nature , you understand that right ? 
  there is n't perfect 50/50 ratios in all careers ? 
  sexism . 
  dems also spread the utter bullshit that is the gender pay gap . 
  similarly , dems continue to tell `` oppressed '' minorities that it is society 's fault they are in lower income tiers . 
  dems fuel racial division in this country . 
  see : original comment, 
   this subreddit * and the media *, 
  `` i have no evidence to support my claims so i 'm going to pretend to take the moral high ground '', 
  still liked your second one better,

  i 'm actually so beta i 'm alpha ! '', 
  #all lives matter *, 
  * ^ ^ except ^ ^ for ^ ^ straight ^ ^ cis-gendered ^ ^ white ^ ^ males . 
  honestly at this point it 's too close to call . 
  i 'd give a slight edge to cruz just because kascuck is taking more trump vote than he is cruz vote . 
  if trump loses it does not mean an automatic brokered convention , but it essentially makes california a must win to realistically expect hitting 1237, 
  # * triggered !!!!!, 
  it 's a known problem . 
  do you know what cpu you have ? 
  because it most likely ca n't process the amount of, 
  #high energy, 
  on this sub, 
  `` trump iz asshole i deserves free edumacations !, 
  `` the term * trigger warning * ` cuck ' is derogatory and we should refrain from using it . 
  the preferred term is ` supporter of women constantly on the hunt for fresh dick ' . '',

  there is no way a rat, 
  should be able to fly . 
  its claws are too small to get, 
  its fat little body off the ground . 
  the rat , of course , flies anyway, 
  because rats do n't care, 
  what humans think is impossible .
