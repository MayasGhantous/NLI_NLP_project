well , we learned from the best ... 
  is china lying in its own vomit ? 
  together with sweden , i 'd say . 
  omg , i 'm an idiot who did n't read the title and it took me twenty minutes to figure out the biggest flag ... 
  i 'm gon na get that morning coffee ... 
  and what 's the punishment for being a jerk ? 
  oh , that sucks , so much consideration and still busted, 
  that 's the best definition i 've ever heard . 
  edit : have to add i do n't especially like the `` making love '' phrase , sounds somewhat cheesy to me , and `` fucking '' is just ungrateful . 
  i 'd rather people just stick with `` having sex '' [ all kinds of ] , but the distinction ** `` me '' / `` us '' ** was absolutely perfect . 
  it actually helped me realize where does the `` ungrateful '' i attach to `` fucking '' come from . 
  holy shit !, 
   when you drink not to get drunk . 
  that 's pretty universal , regardless of gender . 
  i certainly had that moment . 
  it was scary , in a way . . 
  oh , * crap * , you 're right , that 's a broken window :(, 
  i thought it 's a map , at first - it even has poland 's shape . 
  * kinda . 
  ger * money * . 
  brilliant . 
  i love like every single panel looks like it was drawn by a different person . 
  everything changes . 
  * lol *, 
  it 's france 's problem , is n't it ? 
  besides , america is just being pragmatic . 
  hardly a revelation ; , 
  * trick ( ? 
  ) * question . 
  in that case , what does poland look like ? 
  is it a cube , or are the colors * reversed * ? 
  or both ? 
  how does he see himself ? 
  i clearly recall one morning in july 2010 ; over 30 \u00b0 c before 7 a.m. and i thought i 'd trade it for -10 \u00b0 c without a second thought . 
  i 'm fed up with winter now , but still not desperate enough for +30 ... 
  israel 's shape makes him look like a melting ice cube :d which was probably your intention . . : , 
  i 'd love +40 \u00b0 c when in australia , +40 \u00b0 c in poland is just wrong . 
  `` good '' is relative , 
  i got once into one of those , just to find out that air conditioning was broken . 
  and then , there was a traffic jam . 
  longest 15 minutes of my life ... still ended up going home on foot . 
  keep on hand some basic meds - something for pain , sore throat , fever . 
  and band-aids . 
  you do n't need it , until you need it , and then it 's usually not an option to go and get some . 
  edit : also a candle and matches . 
  edit : also , i like art in this one . 
  that 's the nicest top-hat i 've seen in awhile . 
  that * is * dirty , no matter how it 's called , imho . 
  it looks like things got out of hand . 
  there 's finland with a knife , greenland with a gun , and poland 's rollin ' . . 
  i dread to think who 's next . 
  close relations with russia can do that to you . 
  especially when mixed with vodka . 
  there was raped denmark somewhere ... 
  [ there . 
  shit happens , 
  * `` those who do n't know history are doomed to repeat it '' *, 
   never again . 
  it goes like this : sad < sadder < saddest < sadist . 
  same here . 
  but i guess it 's a little like the poles and lech wa\u0142\u0119sa . 
  he lost respect people had for him here long time ago but the rest of the world still sees him as a hero . 
  well , until recently at least - when he decided to speak his mind to the wide world and it * backfired * . 
  his true colors , right there . 
  i died of laughter at the last panel :d, 
  obama received nobel peace prize prophylactically but he failed to take the hint ... 
  but ~ ~ my favorite recipient is still ~ ~ kissinger . 
  * ahh * . 
  i 'll go educate myself now , i think . 
  [ there 's a picture at the bottom . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/westerplatte ), 
  [ you have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  ] ( http://po-land.pl/img/upload/20120630203025.jpg ) it 's longish but there 's good punch line . 
  or in union with poland and it hides behind . ^ again . 
  oh , come on , it was n't * that * bad . 
  just * a little * . 
  lithuania does not like us . 
  :( poland is of sad . 
  * the * whale :(, 
  edit : * the * . 
  friggin ' articles ... 
  potatoes are fun !, 
  i 'd say exactly the opposite , especially since we have the evidence . . 
  i mean * it exists * . 
  again . 
  funny thing is , that majority of poles sings the anthem wrong . 
  there are two words in polish that some people use interchangeably even if they are n't . 
  the first one , which is in the official lyrics : '' * kiedy * '' ( '' * when * '' ) , and the second , that is wrongly used , and frankly i do n't know how they came up with this : '' * p\u00f3ki * '' ( '' * while * '' ) . 
  the thing is , the first one carries positive meaning - there may be no poland on the map , but it still exists because we are , and that 's it - no implied end of that existence . 
  on the contrary , further text suggests that if there will be no poland , we will create it again , take back what 's ours . 
  the second word implies , that we will cease to exist at some point and in consequence there will be no poland anymore . 
  it is now , because we are , but when we cease to exist it will be no more , and that we ** know that 's going to happen ** ... 
  and then imagine : some important sport event , a huge stadium , thousands of people , and when they sing the anthem you can hear '' * p\u00f3ki * '' . 
  seriously . 
  edit : it 's a reference to the first verse :, 
  * `` poland has not yet perished , / so long as we still live . / what the alien force has taken from us , / we shall retrieve with a sabre . 
  britain is of sad because he could n't find a better plumber , of course ? 
  japan 's cap !, 
  [ that 's how we do it .
