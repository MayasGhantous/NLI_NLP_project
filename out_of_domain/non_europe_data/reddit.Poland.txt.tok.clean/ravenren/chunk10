  information on slovakia and slovenia unavailable because someone could n't tell them apart so both got left out ? 
  anyway , how 's that possible they do n't have information on eu countries ? 
  bulgaria , anyone ? 
  i 'll be damned ... yesterday i was making breakfast when out of the blue a random thought popped into my head , that she 's really old and the end might be near ... 
  i was re-watching her movies in december and got so sucked into it i ended up buying a stack of dvds for christmas presents . 
  i saw snow on 26th of november , it lasted about an hour , and then for maybe a week at the end of january , accompanied by -10 \u00b0 c , but that was it . 
  12 \u00b0 c before that , near 10 \u00b0 c after . 
  11 \u00b0 c today . 
  i 'm good , thanks . 
  winter apparently went mainstream and invested in eastern poland .

   let 's just hope poland does n't shrug, 
  someone please make that comic !, 
  no no no .

   context : [ the polish minister , warns ukrain protest leader ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/02/21/ukraine-crisis-polish-minister_n_4830953.html ), 
  seriously now , the comments under this article make me hope that those people commented but had n't read anything past the title , because if that 's not the case they have serious issues with reading comprehension . 
  not to mention some basic knowledge ... it seems they think sikorski threatened the opposition . 
  one genius even thinks we 'd shelter yanukovich . 
  * wow . 
  sure , we 're an amateur of freedom !, 
  bruce springsteen or tom hanks . 
  so if we 're doing a [ repeat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/w%c5%82adys%c5%82aw_sikorski ) , someone , go tell [ sikorski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rados%c5%82aw_sikorski ) he should ditch air travel ... 
   the universe, 
  oh , russia , do n't flatter yourself ... 
  exactly what i 'm saying !, 
  [ sorry , i got excited ... ], 
  relevant poland beat relevant canada in speed skating too !, 
  and , what 's relevant , canada [ got whiny ] ( http://www.torontosun.com/2014/02/22/canadian-coach-calls-out-polish-speed-skaters-strategy ) . 
  they have that in common with the oranje . 
  [ but the latter got over it quickly and turned out to be [ fun ] ( https://twitter.com/martilepa/status/435718264849960960/photo/1 ) ! ], 
  what i 'm saying is we should really import their strategy , so refreshing and good for internal relations !, 
  you see , when polish athletes fail , if you ask the rest of poles , it 's always their fault , and then the pm 's , and the rest of the government , and then they all go apeshit ... when the canadians failed , they said it 's our fault because we were meanies * boohoo * and they still feel good about themselves . 
  when the dutch failed , that was also our fault ... and then the speaker 's - it was too far away !, 
  they [ did their math ] ( http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?act=url&amp;depth=1&amp;hl=pl&amp;ie=utf8&amp;prev=_t&amp;rurl=translate.google.pl&amp;sl=pl&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.plotek.pl/plotek/1,78649,15476226,holendrzy_podwazaja_wygrana_brodki__nic_wspolnego.html&amp;usg=alkjrhjtebqzxrqsqipn5qq-lnwsrcqjvq ) and it turned out had the speaker been closer , the pole would n't have won !, 
  also , wrong moon phase , bad hair day , and really shitty horoscope . 
  and guess what , they are still content !, 
  so , hereby i declare : norway !, 
  it 's your fault kowalczyk failed !, 
  * ahh , it feels good ... *,

   this start off promising but end up weak . 
  you have something in common . 
  i 'll just leave this [ here ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/for-your-freedom-ours-kosciuszko/dp/0099428121/ ) . 
  you jealous ? 
  for the irony , this guy probably is n't fond of ukraine , to put it mildly , and would likely side with the russians , if his experience is anything to judge by ... 
   * he is a survivor of [ the volhynian massacres ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_poles_in_volhynia ) during world war ii , during which ukrainian nationalists murdered 19 members of his family , including his father . 
  ** breaking news ** : from the outer space, 
  the greatest polish joke ever was told by polan himself on monday , march 3rd , 2014 , at 4:39:12 utc , as reported by / u/ixtab1923 . 
  curiously enough , it involved the cavalry , the tanks , and implied * charging * . 
  upon the inevitable failure caused by ignoring the basic law of nature - polan can not into space - polan was seen rushing to the ground in the rough direction of its friend - ukraine - who 's been suffering lately from the hand of the well-known local bully - russia . 
  the eye-witnesses up here say they heard a frantic scream : * `` he of laughings last laughings of bestest !, 
  '' * , closely followed by one last : * `` kurwaaaa '' * , while brave polan waved his little wings and took the aim for the ukrainian underbelly - namely the crimean peninsula , before vanishing from their sight . 
  the witness on the ground , presenting himself as romania , says he stood just on the other bank and saw * everything * . 
  it appears , polan manged to launch the rocket he was carring under his horse and while aiming at the middle of the fancy-shaped penninsula , pressed the red button . 
  [ the romanian witness is turning red on his center body while reporting the following part , he says it 's from the overwhelming emotion he has n't felt since 1991 , when he had the occasion to observe just as interesting events from his little spot on the shore . ], 
  what happend next is : polan disappeared in the depths of the black sea , taking with him the crimea , and by proxy , removing all the russians from the premises , along with the premises ... saving ukraine , the world , and securing his eternal glory by overreaching his goals , yet again . 
  may he rest in peace . 
  * for now . 
  ^ i 'm ^ going ^ to ^ take ^ my ^ meds ^ now . 
   these / u/mo4gv9eywmpmw3xr - esque insights, 
  bestest compliment of ever !, 
  nah , not that fat !, 
  your grandpa is a very wise man . 
  hi , germany !, 
  poland here . 
  i 've heard iceland is nice ... 
  yeah , we 're lame . 
  israel can into superiority !, 
   i 'm going to be so sad when she dies . 
  i 'm already sad . 
  your fault !, 
  have you thought about finding a new hobby ? 
  israel , and here i thought you into many smart !, 
  you see a loophole in that logic , right ? 
  i mean , it 's a * erm ... * rather limited career path ... who into it when you ^ kaput ? 
  point taken . 
  the person that bore the most physical resemblance to me . 
  it 'd be fun to know that somewhere in the middle ages lived a person who looked exactly like you . 
  looking at nothing is one thing but barking at nothing ... 
  thank you for restoring my faith in humanity . 
  or at least a tiny part of it ... 
  all over europe after a suicide attempt they have a right to hold you against your will up to 72 hours . 
  that 's plenty of time to say if you 're a danger to yourself , and then you can earn yourself a prolonged stay . 
  i would n't say she was n't attractive . 
  she might not be a classic beauty but that 's definitely an interesting face and an intelligent gaze . 
  in polish .
