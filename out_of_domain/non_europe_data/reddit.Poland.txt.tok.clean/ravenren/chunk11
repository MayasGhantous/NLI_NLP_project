  as someone [ put it nicely ] ( http://betterthanenglish.com/kombinowac-polish/ ) it means : * `` working out an unusual solution to a complicated problem , somehow acquiring things that are not available in the process . 
  involves a breach of the law or social etiquette . 
  although i would n't agree with the last sentence , as the whole point is not to break the law but to use it to your advantage , to find a loophole . 
  but curiously enough , originally it actually involved some dubious activities . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://jeziorki.blogspot.com/2010/12/whats-english-for-kombinowac.html ) a little bit of history . 
  also , the part * `` acquiring things that are not available * '' has a little more to it , you do n't have to actually get exactly * those things * , all you need is to find something that 'll do . 
  if it works , it works . 
  here 's a fragment from a very informative book * `` xenophobe 's guide to the poles '' * [ btw , there 's a whole series , every book about a different nation , it 's awesome ] that perfectly illustrates what *** kombinowanie *** , * n * . 
  * the flexible pole *, 
  * `` it is not surprising that key national characteristics are adaptability , a knack for improvisation , and the ability to make the best of what 's available . 
  a good polish cook is one who can make gourmet soup from a rusty nail . 
  older polish cook books give recepies of the familiar ` take a dozen eggs ' variety , alongside those for ` what to use if you have no ... ' . 
  for example , ` almond cake if you have no almonds ( use ground beans and almond flavouring ) ' . 
  * although the economic imperative for these characteristics , known collectively as * kombinowanie , * has gone , relegated to the history books along with the queues and shortages that gave the birth to it , it is still an integral part of the polish personality . 
  a heady mix of cerebral gymnastics , technical skill , gung-ho can-do-ery and a pinch of deviousness , it enabled the poles to rig up clever devices when there was nothing suitable on the market . 
  it also showed them how to circumnavigate the unworkable regulations and laws that communist governments created to confound their citizens . 
  you might think these tactics would fade without the necessity to keep them honed . 
  not a bit of it . 
  poles now employ all their stratagems on the eu . 
  hope someone finds this interesting . 
  on a funny note , if you need to * za\u0142atwi\u0107 * yourself , you need to go to the toilet . 
  if you want to * za\u0142atwi\u0107 * someone , you kill them . 
  next thing you know , they 're handing out signs with gtfo written on them which you 're supposed to show when someone is invading you ... 
  let 's see : bears are pretty awesome creatures , actually . 
  potatoes , well , you like your fries , yeah ? 
  terrorists ... ok , those sucks . 
  bland liquor , * bland * liquor , the thing about vodka : even neat is hardly bland . 
  freezing cold weather - yeah , genius , in the north . 
  remember skiers in sochi ? 
  short sleeves and palm trees ? 
  shitty politicians - those are everywhere , though i would n't mind exporting mine to siberia ... slavic music - well , being slavic myself that puts me on the defensive automatically even though i 'm not a fan . 
  another thing is it 's obvious you do n't know slavic music nor what * slavic * actually means . 
  take balkan music and it has nothing in common with what * sounds russian * . 
  you do n't like folk , it all sucks , ask any american how they like their * country * ? 
  track suits & gold chains - [ * yeah * ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=rappers+chains&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=jncou7yie-vp0axqyidycg&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=720 ) ... shit-hole siberia , you mean that * shit-hole * you call alaska ? 
  and poor canadians ... / s. 
  ever seen planet earth ? 
  siberia without human/political context is a magnificent land . 
  disclaimer : no , i 'm not russian , not a fan of russia either , in fact quite the opposite since i 'm polish , but when you try to offend or degrade you need to get your facts straight and pick ones that actually prove your point , you know ... otherwise you 'll look like a biased ignorant . 
  oh , and there 's a difference between * people * and * governments * . 
  let 's say you 're a democrat , you surely would n't like people to judge you by shit republicans say , and vice versa . 
  and , by the way , what you wrote here is a bunch of stereotypes that do n't even apply to the majority of russians , since most of them live in the european part of russia and probably have n't seen a bear outside of a zoo , and a terrorist outside of tv . 
  probably choose beer over vodka on a daily basis , do n't like politics , and see snow in the winter . 
  because , guess what , they 're just like us . 
  what a shocker ... 
  and now imagine : australia freaks out and runs , bumps into denmark who when asked if he wanted to join space program says * thanks * in danish , australia is terrified by then and goes to see his psychiatrist , doctor \u00d6sterreich , who upon meeting him says * hello * in german . 
  australia flees to his safe home and hears clock ticking ... * boo * . 
  best month !, 
  packingham palace . 
  oh , dear roman empire , it 'll be like the old days !, 
  you could impale them , or throw them to the lions and the crowd will clap and cheer and chant for your glory !, 
  there will be gladiators and thumbs down , and everyone will love it , and karma will rocket up . 
  * ahh ... * depression month is best thing ever !, 
  germany , do n't you have some w\u00f6rk to do ? 
  love starry-eyed murica . 
   i agree . 
  polish has a massive amount of loanwords from german ~ ~ and russian ~ ~, 
  from wiki :, 
   * direct borrowings from russian are extremely rare , in spite of long periods of dependence on tsarist russia and the soviet union , and are limited to a few internationalisms , such as sputnik and pierestrojka . 
  russian personal names are transcribed into polish likewise ; thus tchaikovsky 's name is spelled piotr iljicz czajkowski . 
  we however use some russian expressions like * wsio rawno * , or * na wsiaki s\u0142uczaj * , but that is still russian not polish , kinda unofficial . 
  sure but * real * loanwords are few [ * kniga * is a good example ] . 
  syntactic , idiomatic , or lexical calques are more common but it 's rather due to both languages being slavic . 
  it just * fits * . 
  i do n't think people even realize that * dzie\u0144 dzisiejszy * or * na dworze * have anything to do with russian . 
  to be honest , i did n't a minute ago . 
  reddit , meet [ * perun * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perun ) - the slavic equivalent of greek * zeus * , or roman * jupiter * , or norse * thor * . 
  and he had a [ bunch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavic_mythology#deities ) of friends too !, 
  ok , subordinates rather ... you know how them gods are ... like to boss everyone around . 
  including each other . 
  ** bonus edit : **, 
  cool fact about * \u015awiatowid * :, 
   * a statue portraying the god shows him with four heads , each one looking in a separate direction , a symbolical representation of the four directions of the compass , and also perhaps the four seasons of the year . 
  each face had a specific colour . 
  the northern face of this totem was white ( hence white russia / belarus and the white sea ) , the western , red ( hence red ruthenia ) , the southern , black ( hence the black sea ) and the eastern , green ( hence zelenyj klyn ) . 
  * [ [ wiki ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%9awiatowid#appearance ), 
  oh , * for god 's sake * !, 
  they knew all along !, 
  [ *** noooooooooooooo !, 
   does na wsiaki sluczaj mean just in case ? 
  yes . 
   the expression itself also exists in serbian . 
  and probably in other slavic languages too  but we got that one from the russians so it 's considered russian in poland . 
  is the serbian version exactly the same as the russian one ? 
  we also have a polonized version - * na wszelki wypadek * , a lot of people say incorrectly * na wszelki zwyczaj * because it sounds similiar to * na wsiaki s\u0142uczaj * , though that does not make much sense . 
  * wsio rawno * - literally * everything equally * . 
  polish version * wszystko jedno * - literally * everything one * . 
  meaning , * same difference * , so either truly identical or the difference is immaterial , especially when a person is added - * wszystko mi jedno * - * everything 's one to me * - even if there 's a difference , i do n't care . 
  you wrote * straight * , i do n't know about russian but in polish * r\u00f3wno * [ adverb ] means * equally/evenly , straight , flat/level . 
  the jews are behind * everything !, 
  * you ca n't see them but they * are * there ... hiding * behind !, 
  i ca n't help it but those fleurs-de-lis look like bananas ... 
  you could be the appendix ... 
  such is life . 
  let 's make it * almost three * . 
  here , let me [ repeat ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1wbikt/countries_of_discovery_of_the_elements_xpost/cf0tem1?context=3 ) myself :, 
  * '' [ micha\u0142 s\u0119dziw\u00f3j ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/micha%c5%82_s%c4%99dziw%c3%b3j ) ( michael sendivogius , s\u0119dzimir ) ( 1566 -- 1636 ) of ostoja coat of arms was a polish alchemist , philosopher , and medical doctor . 
  a pioneer of chemistry , he developed ways of purification and creation of various acids , metals and other chemical compounds . 
  * *** he discovered that air is not a single substance and contains a life-giving substance-later called oxygen 170 years before similar discoveries by scheele and priestley . 
  so , sweden , france and uk - make room , here i come !,
