  no can do . 
  busy raising awareness of the world on reddit . 
  important stuff !, 
   and became french by choice, 
  that 's because staying in poland was n't an option . 
  [ thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1wbikt/countries_of_discovery_of_the_elements_xpost/cf0hogo ) for you . 
  also , she named it * polonium * . 
  does it ring a bell ? 
  [ * heeey * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=v5bws62m_sk#t=48 ) * !, 
  * i think [ that 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=v5bws62m_sk#t=190 ) the moment from the comic ... , 
  i can imagine polish priests saying that kids were naughty and that 's why paedophiles got them . 
  their fault , they deserved it !, 
  but , wait , that actually already happened ... 
  i think i stay a lego worshiper . 
  sorry for the wall of text !, 
   i did n't plan this . 
  i just started writing my reply and later realized that it got a little lengthy ... but i thought i 'll post it anyway . 
   denying any paternity from france, 
  you see that happening anywhere ? 
  everyone can see her connections with france . 
  no one is denying those . 
  you listed plenty in your post . 
  but what * is * happening is exactly the opposite - a lot of people deny her any connection with poland . 
  besides being born here . 
  and * leaving * , of course , which sounds rather miserable as * connections * go . 
   ca n't it be both ? 
  yeah , exactly . 
  both , not just france . 
  or more france , less poland . 
  * both . 
  a lot of people say she left because she * prefered * france to poland . 
  while she * did * , it 's not that she prefered the * country * itself . 
  france just had all the opportunities for a * female * scientist at that time , and one from not an independent country at that . 
  so she left to pursue her career , and obviously had a life , a family there . 
  but still she taught her children polish , and named the element * polonium * , what is well known to be purposeful to highlight a * polish question * . 
  she never * stopped * being polish . 
  acquiring of the french citizenship did n't erase that . 
   she first left for paris to pursue her studies when she was young , there were no question of keeping credit for her discoveries at that time . 
  that 's totally made up . 
  that 's not made up , as no one really said that 's the sole reason she left or a direct one . 
  but it 's unquestionable that had she stayed , had russian occupied poland had funds for her research , had women been allowed to higher education in the first place , moreover had * the poles * had a right to * proper * study in poland , and many other * ifs * , russia would eventually have taken credit for itself . 
  that 's indubitable . 
  poles under the russian rule were supposed to be uneducated and obey . 
  the russian partition was the most oppressive one , especially in her times i.e. 
  after the fall of the january uprising of 1863 -- 65 . 
  you see there room for anyone who 'd like to do something for a country other than russia ? 
  let alone a * female * scholar with * wrong * nationality ? 
  from wikipedia : * `` maria 's paternal grandfather , j\u00f3zef sk\u0142odowski , had been a respected teacher in lublin , where he taught the young boles\u0142aw prus , who would become a leading figure in polish literature . 
  her father , w\u0142adys\u0142aw sk\u0142odowski , taught mathematics and physics , subjects that maria was to pursue , and was also director of two warsaw gymnasia for boys . 
  after russian authorities eliminated laboratory instruction from the polish schools , he brought much of the laboratory equipment home , and instructed his children in its use . 
  * the father was eventually fired by his russian supervisors for pro-polish sentiments , and forced to take lower-paying posts ; ( ... ) maria 's mother bronis\u0142awa operated a prestigious warsaw boarding school for girls ; * ( ... ), 
  * when she was ten years old , maria began attending the boarding school of j. sikorska ; next she attended a gymnasium for girls , from which she graduated on 12 june 1883 with a gold medal . 
  * unable to enroll in a regular institution of higher education because she was a woman , she and her sister bronis\u0142awa became involved with the clandestine flying university , a polish patriotic institution of higher learning that admitted women students . 
  maria made an agreement with her sister , bronis\u0142awa , that she would give her financial assistance during bronis\u0142awa 's medical studies in paris , in exchange for similar assistance two years later . 
  * at the beginning of 1890 , bronis\u0142awa * ( ... ) * invited maria to join them in paris . 
  maria declined because she could not afford the university tuition ; it would take her a year and a half longer to gather the necessary funds . 
  * ( ... ) * all that time she continued to educate herself , reading books , exchanging letters , and being tutored herself . 
  * ( ... ) * she tutored , studied at the flying university , and began her practical scientific training ( 1890 -- 91 ) in a chemical laboratory at the museum of industry and agriculture at krakowskie przedmie\u015bcie 66 , near warsaw 's old town . 
  the laboratory was run by her cousin j\u00f3zef boguski , who had been an assistant in saint petersburg to the russian chemist dmitri mendeleev . 
  when she left poland she was 24 years old , france does n't get all the credit for educating her . 
  and her * french family * with the nobel prizes are n't the only educated ones among her relatives . 
   she 's buried in the french pantheon . 
  and john paul ii is buried in rome . 
  so what ? 
  chopin in paris , later his heart was brought to warsaw . 
  ko\u015bciuszko was buried in switzerland before his remains were brought to warsaw . 
  pu\u0142aski 's still on the other side of atlantic . 
  mickiewicz - a national poet died in istanbul and was buried there . 
  then he was moved to france , and then fifty years later to poland . 
  you 're gon na need a lot of luck to find a notable pole from the 18th , 19th , and early 20th centruy who was n't buried outside of poland , at least originally . 
  and dying abroad means living abroad . 
  probably more than a half of the * important * poles of the 19th century were buried in france . 
  the [ reason ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/h%c3%b4tel_lambert#the_political_salon ) . 
  others elsewhere . 
  those who rest in poland today were brought here only after poland regained independence in 1918 . scholars , writers , artists , politicians , aristocrats . 
  most of them . 
  and especially those who did something important . 
  the last king of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth , who died in 1798 , was buried in russia , and then belarus . 
  his funeral in warsaw was in 1995 ... 
   i guess we should credit all the accomplishments of american citizens to their original countries from where they or their parents immigrated . 
  that 's exactly where you 're denying poland any credit . 
  by bringing pointless comparison that has nothing to do with the situation at hand . 
  and is only meant to ridicule . 
  and one that is wrong on all the levels . 
  curie was n't a child of emigrants , nor was she a child when she emigrated herself . 
  and to put it bluntly : a british actor who receives the oscar [ the * american * academy of motion picture arts and sciences award ] for his performance in an * american * movie is still british . 
  even though he probably holds the american citizenship at that point . 
  ** edit : ** also , i think i need to clarify something . 
  there was plenty opportunities to be highly educated in poland at that time . 
  as long as one was n't * a ) * a woman and * b ) * too pro-polish , too obviously engaged in fight for independence . 
  and curie 's family was . 
  * `` on both the paternal and maternal sides , the family had lost their property and fortunes through patriotic involvements in polish national uprisings aimed at restoring poland 's independence ( the most recent had been the january uprising of 1863 -- 65 ) . 
  this condemned the subsequent generation , including maria , her elder sisters and her brother , to a difficult struggle to get ahead in life . 
  he 'll call you gay and say it 's all fault of * the gender satan * [ besides you being gay , because that makes you more evil than the satan himself , obviously ] . 
  and that you have all kinds of hidden motives which is * obviously * to destroy * the one and only true polish poland * . 
  and for sure you had to play with legos as a kid , and that 's when they made you gay ... 
  if you 're any lucky , he 'll be drunk and you 'll have a nice fight after which he 'll say that you attacked * the holy church * . 
  so , * obviously * again , all the gays are trying to destroy their dear church and that 's why they need our money so they can stop the evil gender from destroying the world as we know it . 
  not sure what that would be , though . 
  * wow * , you posted this multiple times ?
