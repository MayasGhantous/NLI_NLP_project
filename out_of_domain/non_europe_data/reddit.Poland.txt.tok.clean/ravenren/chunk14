  if only for simple respect for someone who took their time to answer you . 
  your highlighting that you 're not going to read my answer tells a lot about you , not me . 
  and accusing me of things i did not say , while you admitted multiple times that you did n't even read it is ridiculous . 
  especially since you quoted me in your other comment , and i say exactly the opposite .

  the town of breda was liberated by the polish 1st armoured division on october 29th , 1944 , under the command of general stanis\u0142aw maczek . 
  after the war , at the request of the grateful residents of breda , the general was awarded the honorary citizenship of the netherlands . 
  there 's a polish military cemetery there , where he was later , * much later * , laid to rest among his soldiers who died during wwii , as that was his last wish . 
  general maczek lived 102 years . 
  died in 1994 in scotland . 
  after the war the communist regime in poland stripped him of polish citizenship and , as many others of his kind , he remained in the united kingdom . 
  to add insult to injury , the british did not consider him to be an allied soldier . 
  he was denied any combatant rights and military pension . 
  he worked as a bartender to support himself . 
  he was rehabilitated only after poland * regain independence * anew , in 1989 . 
   each year during liberation day festivities , breda is visited by a large polish contingent and the city of breda reserves a special portion of the festivities for the fallen polish soldiers .

  also , keep in mind that those men were around 20 years old in 1944 , and surely lower rank . 
  the general of their division died 20 years ago at the age of 102 . 
  i wanted to answer your question * why would that be * , and the backstory got a little lengthy ... 
  tusk was elected in the fall of 2007 . 
  in 2008 him and his government were all fresh ( in power , not in politics ) and without much significant achievements . 
  in august 2008 , during georgian war , our then president kaczy\u0144ski flew over to georgia to show his support and said that *** `` now it 's georgia , next will be ukraine , then the baltics , and eventually poland . 
  now , kaczy\u0144ski was from the main opposition ( president since 2005 ) , his party was the ruling party ( 2005-2007 ; ended prematurely ) before tusk and his party took over , and kaczy\u0144ski 's identical twin brother was the prime minister just before tusk . 
  you do n't get more * opposite * than that . 
  also , the kaczy\u0144skis ' party was , and is , staunchly anti-russian , anti-german , anti-eu , pro-church , * rather far * - right , and paranoid at that ( after 2010 even more ) . 
  they 've been making many ridiculous accusations toward germany and russia for years then . 
  no one was taking them seriously , they were considered a threat to our relations with our neighbours , and our position in eu . 
  that still stands even though the guy was practically a prophet about ukraine . 
  now you ask why is that . 
  kaczy\u0144ski the president died in the famous presidential plane crash in april 2010 in russia . 
  the event was ruled as an accident , our investigation blamed our pilots . 
  a little backstory : when kaczy\u0144ski flew to georgia in 2008 he ordered the pilot to land in tbilisi , the pilot refused as tbilisi was practically a war zone then . 
  moreover , he had on board not only the polish president , but also the presidents of lithuania , estonia , ukraine ( yushchenko , the good guy before yanukovych ) , and the prime minister of latvia . 
  just imagine that . 
  here we go into technicalities . 
  the president of the republic of poland is also the supreme commander of the armed forces . 
  until the crash that took kaczy\u0144ski 's life polish officials flew in military planes with military crews . 
  so technically he could order the pilot to do just about anything he wanted , * but * once in the air the pilot is * almighty * and has the last word , and it does n't matter who his passengers are . 
  so when kaczy\u0144ski foolishly wanted to land in tibilisi , pilot refused , they landed elsewhere . 
  the whole story ends up with the pilot getting fired , then getting a medal for his conduct , then kaczy\u0144ski 's butthurt turned international incident , followed by the famous quote in bold getting even more spotlight . 
  so , we have a history of kaczy\u0144ski 's idiotic decisions while on board . 
  and then 2010 presidental plane crash happens . 
  we have the best relations with russia ever , and our president is , well , biased and not the sharpest tool in the shed . 
  the right wing screams : * assassination !, 
  * * russian attack !, 
  * and the moderate majority of the society looks at them with pity , and no one takes them seriously because that 's what they always do .
