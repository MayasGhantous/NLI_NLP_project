  blame everything on russia . 
  there are people even today who think tusk together with putin assasinated kaczy\u0144ski ... and that 's when they currently are n't blaming tusk of being merkel 's pawn and working against poland . 
  you get the idea . 
  when someone shouts * wolf !, 
  * over and over , you eventually stop listening . 
  after 2010 and the plane crash , kaczy\u0144ski the former prime minister tried to took over his brother and become the president . 
  did n't happen . 
  his party stays the main oppositional force . 
  and they went full retard . 
  the last elections were n't * pro-tusk * but rather * anti-kaczy\u0144ski * ... the copious amount of idiotic statements and accusations they 've made since 2010 and before did that . 
  so that 's why even though kaczy\u0144ski the president was right about putin and his geopolitical ambitions , they still are ridiculed and not taken seriously . 
  they got the right result ( ukraine ) but not because they did good math , but because they were always puting * 4 * after * = * , and they finaly stumbled on * 2 +2 * and it checked . 
  so , to answer your question , tusk/sikorski could n't say what putin offered back in 2008 , because that would be like giving power to the kaczy\u0144skis . 
  like obama saying : * now , vote for the republicans , i do n't know what i 'm doing . 
  * and while it 's possible that tusk was taken by suprise and even thought to himself : * holy fuck !, 
  * he 's still more capable of taking good stance toward russia than kaczy\u0144ski would ever be . 
  even at that point ( 2008 ) they already had three years to show what they 're like . 
  and if tusk did n't report that in 2008 later was even more * not an option * . 
  until now . 
  thanks to putin . 
  by the way , i 'm not saying that this revelation is true . 
  i just wanted to show you that if it is , it 's easy to understand why they did n't speak up earlier . 
  edit : commas and stuff . 
  well , then welcome to reddit !, 
  you may want to see a the * rapist * about that ... 
   childhood dreams about being an adult, 
  people had those ? 
  have n't they heard of peter pan ... ? 
  in this thread & in my opinion, 
  promises kept . 
  ^ ^ let 's ^ ^ say ^ ^ a ^ ^ noun ^ ^ is ^ ^ an ^ ^ object ... 
  lower silesia here , * piernik * is a must . 
  also * sernik * and * makowiec * . 
  not that i ate any , though there was plenty on the table . 
  i was too busy with all the fish and * uszka * . 
  technically , tsar nicholas ii romanov was the last one to be the titular king of poland . 
  but 1918 is still wrong , in that case it should be 1917 . 
   does not mean they were true kings, 
  that 's why it 's * technically * and * titular * . 
   nowhere is he listed as a one of polish monarchs, 
  actually , he is . 
  even on wikipedia . 
  you just need to look for more than the basics . 
  but again , it 's just a technicality . 
   annexation only appears once in poland 's page , annexed thrice, 
  try * occupation * . 
  that 's the very page i was talking about so someone changed it . 
  and by looks of it at least three weeks ago , should 've checked prior to posting , my bad . 
  anyway :, 
   you just need to look for more than the basics, 
  mayby you should look up the definition of * technicality * . 
  everything i said is correct and the fact that you do n't like it does n't change the facts . 
  tsars held the titles , and the so called * kingdom * was a russian province back then . 
  [ nicholas ii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nicholas_ii_of_russia ) 's wiki page and all of his predecessors ' present the * titular king issue * just fine . 
  ** edit : ** you can downvote all you want , you ca n't change the history . 
  this is laughable . 
   nope, 
  click that link of yours and change language to polish . 
  everything is just as i said . 
  i did n't realize yesterday that i might have seen that page in another language . 
  so , back at you . 
  it 's gon na be black , i bet ... but since i ca n't sleep anyway , may i have a turn , please ? 
  they are .

  i have no doubts about scottish hospitality but the british government fucked that one up big time . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/militaryporn/comments/2jixk9/polish_ww2_veterans_who_participated_in_the/clcbatz ) a quick post i wrote about it some time ago . 
  i can `` understand '' that the moronic communists fucked him over , but the brits ... 
  and i had no idea about that map !, 
  it 's awesome , thanks for the post !, 
  should 've quoted both paragraphs for the contrast . 
  my post was a tl ; dr in the first place , lol , 
   but to label all brits as fuckers over is very wrong, 
  and nobody did that . 
   i have no doubts about scottish hospitality but ** the british government ** fucked that one up big time . 
  austria 's gon na have to stand in line . 
  last time i checked , poland described itself as * the heart of europe * , albeit for different reasons . 
  not to mention all those who 'd like to have * the very center * of * uh * yurop ... who 's next ? 
  should be fun !, 
  read the whole thing , would you ? 
  that 's the next sentence and it clearly refers to the british government i carefully specified in the previous sentence . 
  pulling it out of the context proves nothing . 
  ** edit : ** with that logic you should be also arguing that * the moronic communists * are n't the whole nation of poland , just the rulers , but somehow you 're not ... 
   so you would happily refer to the moronic communists as `` the poles ... '', 
  that would be incorrect . 
  * the poles * coulnd ' t wipe their own ass without moscow telling them what 's allowed . 
  check the definition of a puppet state . 
  in that case * poland * \u2260 * the poles * . 
  i referred to the poles just fine in the post that was linked in my first comment here . 
  the post that , by the way , contains all the, 
  substantive content . 
  the comment here is just a pointer , but you keep bringing that one up . 
  he was betrayed by both countries . 
  the british gave him nothing that he did n't work for , and basically offended him , but you would n't know since you did not bother to read what i wrote or linked to . 
  poland could n't do anything as it was practically under soviet occupation . 
  and rehabilitated him in 1989 , as soon as the russians were out of the picture . 
  britain remained free for all that time ( battle of britain of them all ... ) , and they had the guts to say to a decorated war hero that he 's not really an allied soldier , so they do n't owe him anything . 
  the man had to work as a bartender to earn his living . 
  how many british generals were denied military pensions and had to work in pubs ? 
  get your facts straight .
