  and not to mention the `` honors '' he recived on the victory parade in london in 1946 ... * oh , wait * ... they did n't even invite him , and any of his compatriots for they were n't really allies , right ? 
  as much as i like the brits and the uk , that one was a major fuck up . 
  no way around that . 
  edit : typos, 
  you missed the point completely . 
  i 'm sure your grandfather was a worthy man , but this anecdotal story is irrelevant here . 
  you lack arguments . 
  and , by the way , gen. maczek received * special treatment * . 
  that 's the problem . 
  he received the exact opposite of what he should have received , and what others like him got . 
  i do n't see any point in continuing this conversation . 
  you refused to acknowledge my arguments , you do n't present any counterarguments ( and anecdotal evidence is none ) . 
  you just do n't like the facts , and saying that i 'm wrong for the sake of it , wo n't make it true . 
  cheers . 
  relevant username . 
  pizza with oscypek ... * good god * ... why have n't i thought of that before ?!, 
  i 'd go full retard and make pizza with oscypek * and * pineapple ... 
  i 'm salivating just thinking about it . 
   now telepizza has the same thing under the name of `` zb\u00f3jnicka '' ,, 
  i 'm going to have an unhealthy dinner tomorrow , thanks !, 
  that was deep . 
  * wow ... * that was my first thought ; took me a split second and i immediately felt bad about it ... and here you are . 
  the more you think about it , the creepier it gets . 
   the king of poland-lithuania ** some how ** inherited the throne of sweden, 
  well , he was swedish . 
  the son of the king of sweden and a polish princess that became the queen of sweden . 
  very straightforward . 
   the swedes were n't too happy about that, 
  that 's because he was crazy religious . 
  too crazy for them ; and catholic , they were protestant . 
  too crazy for the commonwealth too . 
  he got poland into unnecessary war with sweden and was trying too hard to establish a hereditary monarchy . 
  he moved the capital from krak\u00f3w to warsaw and * stands * to this day on a giant [ column ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sigismund%27s_column ) in castle square in warsaw with a giant cross in his hand . 
  auschwitz in polish refers solely to the camp , the town is called o\u015bwi\u0119cim and it 's not on this map . 
  i was staring at that one for a longer moment with no clue and then i said it out loud and * wow * ... they all look ridiculous but are surprisingly close . 
  we even have the official * day of friendship * , [ duh ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungary%e2%80%93poland_relations ) ... 
  but a kettle in polish is *** czaj **** nik * ... 
  unless , of course , you actually pay attention to the lyrics ... 
  not to mention it helps with the pronunciation , the cadence , and , moreover , it can get , * and keep * , you interested . 
  the author of that quote failed to mention those who * do that * . 
  and for them it 's a great tool for polishing multiple skills at once . 
  yet he just stated altogether that * music is n't great either * because you wo n't listen . 
  that 's not saying that * most people do n't do that * , that 's assuming music is useless for everyone equally , and that 's just not true . 
  you should check polish if you like that . 
  friday - * pi\u0105tek * - the fifth one, 
  thursday - * czwartek * - the fourth one, 
  wednesday - * \u015broda * - the middle one ( this one is feminine , if it were masculine as the others it 'd be * \u015brodek * and that 's literally * the middle * ), 
  tuesday - * wtorek * - the second one ; from * wt\u00f3ry * - another/next/second, 
  monday - * poniedzia\u0142ek * - the one after sunday ; from * po niedzieli * - after sunday, 
  sunday - * niedziela * - the one when you do n't work ; from * nie dzia\u0142a\u0107 / nie pracowa\u0107 * - not to work,

  because we , europeans , insist that we 're all different ... 
  and then there 's latvia . 
  yep , technically . 
  i think most of it comes from clothes and hairdos . 
  but maybe also mentality ? 
  i mean , today 's teenagers think of themselves as children , even some 20-somethings still do n't have the full grasp of being an adult . 
  especially if they 're still in school , or living with their parents . 
  and i think it shows . 
  somehow . 
  and these people in the picture had to grow up even faster . 
  he was leaving to fight in a freaking global war . 
  that 'd probably make anyone age a decade overnight , let alone an 18-year-old . 
  along with everyone who cared about him . 
  * one i oni * probably means * they ( women ) and they ( men ) * , if anyone 's interested . 
  i say * probably * 'cause , though still slavic , i 'm not sure about serbian . 
  and that 's a badass picture !, 
  i usually do that to check how old they are and end up reading much more than this ; then regret that because all those facts about the real person get in the way between me and a character and i have trouble liking/not liking them , or even see their portraying as believable . 
  polan can into smartest . 
  i 'm pretty sure we have two colors in poland : red ( regular ) and green ( only locally ) , although i have n't sent a traditional letter in years so maybe something 's changed ? 
  of coursings !, 
  * polan goings spaces !, 
  * many smart !, 
  and yuo , people of the world , wan na know why polan havings trouble with into space ? 
  that 's coz heaven 's in the way !, 
  so very polish . 
  ^ ok , ^ that ^ might ^ not ^ be ^ my ^ original ^ idea . 
  ^ i ^ came ^ up ^ with ^ this ^ yesterday ^ thanks ^ to ^ one ^ poet/singer ^ who ^ wrote ^ that ^ `` the ^ shortest ^ way ^ to ^ heaven ^ leads ^ from ^ poland '' ^ and ^ polandball ^ was ^ my ^ first ^ thought ... ^ i ^ think ^ i 'm ^ spending ^ too ^ much ^ time ^ on ^ reddit ... 
  oh , * ouch * , my bad , did n't foresee that outcome ... that quote is actually my paraphrase of a verse of this [ guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jacek_kaczmarski ) 's song about this [ novel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fire_in_the_steppe ) 's main [ character ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/micha%c5%82_wo%c5%82odyjowski ) . 
  the observation that the krtek and pingu could be twins hurts my childhood ... 
  also , dae remember colargol ? 
  we call them * wilk i zaj\u0105c * in poland , it 's a classic !, 
  well , that 's the * problem * , just look at the picture . 
   i figured poland would 've had some other cartoon . 
  well , we * do * , but here 's reddit ... , 
   maybe there was an inspiration . 
  i do n't think so . 
  i just noticed the * weird * resemblance for the first time and i find it funny , and strange that i have n't noticed before even though i loved these two characters as a kid . 
  [ mackenzie johnson ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/mackenziemusic26/videos ) . 
  i have no idea why she 's not world famous yet . 
  she has a really powerful voice and is incredibly versatile . 
  i 'm not easily wowed but she can give me goosebumps at times . 
  i do n't even care that her songs of choice are n't my cup of tea , she makes up for this a thousand times .
