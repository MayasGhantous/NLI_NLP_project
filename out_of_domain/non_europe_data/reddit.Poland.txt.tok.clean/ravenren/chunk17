  we 're special . 
  why ? 
  was n't it barely over 40 \u00b0 c ? 
  i 've seen 38 \u00b0 c this summer . 
  and 36 \u00b0 c is pretty common ( at least a few days every year ) . 
  it 's just 2 \u00b0 c more , does n't seem exaggerated . 
  that screams desperate . 
  and here i thought it was supposed to be haes and #effyourbeautystandards . 
  and the funniest thing is that collarbones are actually dependent on your bone structure . 
  there are skinny people with barely visible bones ( look kristen stewart for example ) , and not at all skinny with collarbones showing no matter what . 
   my professors at the university had to explain to the class full of foreigners that they believed the protestors were not reflective of actual polish people . 
  they were just embarrassed . 
  yeah , i cringe at the memory . 
  every time . 
  and it 's been five years . 
  the * defenders of the cross * , as we call them , are the epitome of what 's wrong with catholicism in poland in a nutshell . 
  there 's a famous quote turned proverb in poland : * `` ludzie ludziom zgotowali ten los '' * ( `` people dealt this fate to people '' ) . 
  it 's always the first thing that comes to mind when i look at such things . 
  it causes a grind in my brain , a cognitive dissonance , and that funny tingling feeling near the heart that you ca n't get away with a scratch . 
  like i know all the facts , all the history , all the * who , where , what , why * , but i somehow still do n't get it . 
  and there are similar things happening today , in the fucking 2015 . what the hell is wrong with people ? 
  ** edit : ** ~ ~ why is france the only one marked * occupied * ? 
  i assume it 's to differentiate it from the unoccupied part but what about the rest of occupied countries ? 
  the neutral ones are also marked . ~ ~, 
  there are brackets and i 'm blind ... 
  this is insane . 
  i 'm in poland , the smallest drink at mcdonald 's here is 0,25 l ( 8.5 oz ) and the biggest is half a liter ( 16.9 oz ) . 
  you should find the [ first paragraph ] ( http://medaliony.klp.pl/a-8223.html ) interesting . 
  * * oh , my ... * czechia western but dear polan eastern ? 
  bulgaria southern but romania eastern ? 
  i hope you brought popcorn ... just wait for it ... 
  and the party 's hosted by the baltic triplets !, 
  * yay nordics !, 
  ** edit : ** * oh dear * , going into my history and downvoting everything that 's there was * a really * mature thing to do ... and i know that for a fact because that 's the only way that posts in the thread that no longer exists got downvoted ... 
  overreaction to the joke post that starts with * hahaha * much ? 
  looks like we 're gon na need an ointment for all the butthurt besides popcorn . 
  seriously , people , better invest in eastern poland or somethin' . 
  nah , most maps put them in the east along with the rest of us , unless there 's * central * , then they usually end up in the north . 
  this is beautiful . 
  i 'm talking about the maps that we talk about in this subreddit and most maps made by regular people around the net , not about the actual definition , which btw varies in case of all of those countries . 
  and your persistence is the ideal example of why i thought we 're gon na need popcorn here ... cheers . 
   learn to read, 
  you must be pleasant to be around . 
  * wow * . 
  yet another one . 
  do you have a problem with reading comprehension ? 
  read my post again . 
  your point is exactly why i found it funny . 
  we are , and like to be called , central/northern/whatever and not eastern . 
  but calling us ( the originally mentioned countries ) eastern is n't wrong either , it just depends on which definition you 're using and whom you ask . 
  the joke was that inevitably someone with a butthurt will show up and start to argue for whichever country that they 're not what the map says ( and that map is rather arbitrary ) . 
  usually it 's one of my own countrymen , which i think makes it even funnier . 
  i did n't notice the * central * on the map and that gives you a right to act like a jerk , right ? 
  but grouping central and eastern together kinda proves my point . 
  * whatever . 
  the point with slavic countries in the center is exactly that they 're not really western or eastern , they share things from both sides . 
  all it takes is to compare the czech republic with , say , ukraine , and suddenly it 's not really so eastern either ( religion , alphabet ) . 
  i do n't know why you felt it 's necessary to bring the economic factor into this . 
  and i 'm stuck with polan and i love it dearly !, 
  the whole point of my post was to point out that the separation of the czech republic from poland , or romania from bulgaria is uncommon , arbitrary and will create a butthurt from whichever side . 
   and fourth of all , f ** k you . 
  * yeah * , like i said . 
  * munches popcorn . 
  i 'm not talking about actual definitions or reasons . 
  i said * most maps * . 
  here , in the news , random newspapers or studies where this division is not a focal point , like here . 
  then we all ( east of germany ) end up * eastern * . 
  unleass there 's central , then poland ends up in the center , the baltics in the north , bulgaria & romania in the south , and so on . 
  i wrote here like ten times what i meant by what and i keep getting messages and comments that : * oh , no , you/re wrong . 
  we 're not eastern * from whatever side . 
  like no one just tries to actually read what i said and , seeing downvotes , just assumes i must be wrong , but no actual responses to what i originally said or meant . 
  while the comment that explains step by step what i meant in the first one got upvotes . 
  and both are saying the same thing . 
  sorry i 'm just venting . 
  it 's just riddiculous . 
  i made a joke , that 's made here all the time , because that map is arbitrary and people did exactly what i predicted ( butthurt ) while i was just jokingly pointing out inconsistencies in the freaking picture . 
  * this is weird . 
  and i honestly do n't get what they do n't get . 
  sorry for the drama , but maybe you could read my comments and tell me is it really not clear what i meant ? 
  i 'm seriously dumbfounded here . 
  most maps you see on the net are n't the official * whichever * version . 
  you see maps on the news , put together by some intern . 
  cnn always manages to put czechoslovakia or yugoslavia there in 2015 ... 
  most maps you see are made by amateurs who check , if at all , the first source that came up in google search . 
  for an average american everything east of germany is * eastern europe . 
  * the baltics , poland , the czechs , slovenia not to mention everything east of them . 
  tell me i 'm wrong . 
  that 's the most maps you see , that 's what i 'm talking about . 
  and frankly i think most people here downvoting me with a passion just did n't understand what i meant here or in the first comment . 
  how come the long comment when i explained step by step what i ment by the first * joking * one is upvoted ? 
  and i was right there 's gon na be butthurt about who belongs where . 
  i just did n't see it coming that i 'll end up as a scapegoat , especially since i did n't said what i think , i just pointed out what 's on the map . 
  i thought my original comment was clear . 
  especially since this kind of jokes are made here all the time . 
  * ooh , polan can into west * or sth . 
  maybe it was n't clear enough what i meant . 
  i was pointing out that this map here is arbitrary at best and people keep talking to me about the actual definitions , while i wanted to point out that this map does n't follow even one real devinition because the countries i mentioned originally got separated , which usually does not happen . 
  holy crap , sorry for the wall of text .
