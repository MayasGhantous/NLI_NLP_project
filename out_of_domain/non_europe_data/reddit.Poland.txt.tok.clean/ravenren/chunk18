  the reaction to that original comment and everything that follows just really suprised me . 
  i think i 'm gon na take a break from reddit for tonight . 
  cheers . 
  my father would just throw my sneakers at me and say : * move your ass , we 're going for a run * , this dad here was super diplomatic . 
  on the other hand , i do n't buy into * diplomatic * inside the closest family and friends . 
  if you ca n't be totally honest and to the point with the closest of people then with whom ? 
  and you know this case has to be * bad * when the father 's afraid he 'll outlive his daughter . 
  to be honest , the italian sizing may cause trouble for someone not in the know . 
  but that would be about things sized as 38 , 40 , 42 and so on , because while in most of europe 34 is xs , 36 is s , 38 is m , 40 is l and 42 is xl , the italians called their 36/s - 42 , so italian 44 is just 38/m for the rest of europe , someone wants 44 ( xxl ) and they end up baffled why the italian 44 ( m ) was like three sizes too small ... , 
  if she were used to that i 'd understand the confusion , damn , i was once baffled when i ordered a coat online , i wanted an s/36 , they sent me something with 42 on the label and i freaked out because it barely fit . 
  only later i noticed on the website that i can switch eu size to the manufacturer size ... they just show me the sizing i 'm used to by default . 
  i know it 's not really related to this case , but i just wanted to point that out . 
  yea , sure , take pictures ... with , say , an iphone that would just save the location of where the pictures were taken ... 
  and the funny thing is that as a person who never had this problem , or did n't even think that it can be a problem , i probably would n't even notice . 
  or if i did , i 'd just give them a bigger towel ( if i was that friend they 're at ) or just say , well , where 's the problem , just dry yourself and get dressed ... because , see , the only people who notice the weight all the freaking time , are the ones that carry it ... and then everything becomes * about the weight * , even if it does n't have to . 
  i never wrap a towel around myself . 
  i just get out of a bathtube , get dried , get dressed , well , partialy , and gtf out of the bathroom ... and on a beach or by the pool i just wear it as a cape ... come to think of it , it may actually be weird ... ! found the thin privilege !, 
  you can act as a weirdo and not even realize it ... and i 'm not even that thin . 
  and , by the way , who goes anywhere without their own towel ? 
  maybe i 'm a freak , have n't really thought about it , but i always bring my own towel , at friend 's or even hotel ... and not bringing your own anywhere where you need a swimsuit is just plain weird , hm ? 
  i 'd probably choose to be wary , maybe someone smarter than me would be still capable of getting to that info ... 
   i remember my first time through . 
  i was eleven , now i 'm twenty-six and the magic is still there , just as it was the first time around . 
  i was so scared when i estimated that the last book will probably come out after i turn eighteen . 
  i thought when i become * an adult * i wo n't have any pleasure from * kids books * anymore ... this was so scary thought i almost cried ... 
  i lol 'd in a bus the other day when i remembered that out of the blue ; people stared . 
  not sure if cute or stupid . 
  i 'm reading * inkheart * now and still do n't know who i want to be when i grow up ... 
  ^ ^ ^ sorry , ^ ^ ^ story ^ ^ ^ time ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ strong ^ ^ ^ with ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ one ^ ^ ^ today . 
   has anyone else entered the fandom late ? 
  my mom was 47 when she read the first three books , she loved it . 
  does that count ? 
  one centimeter to the left and you 're a dead man , one meter to the right and you 're in another country , one second later and the chance is gone , one point down and you failed , a split second * and * a few centimeters and that drunk driver did n't kill you on the spot ... 
  seriously , what is going on with these people ? 
  i do n't believe that being fat makes you , well , stupid , but i 'm starting to think that you have to be already not the brightest to get to a certain size , let alone to justify to everyone who 's gon na listen ( or not ) why you intend to stay there ... and that it 's * the * right thing to do . 
  i do n't care if someone is morbidly obese , ok with that , and want to stay that way . 
  their choice . 
  but all that * logic * , and justification , and haes-esque bullshit is an entirely another level ... 
  also , to be honest , i do n't believe they 're fine with it . 
  not in the slightest . 
  accepted it ? 
  sure . 
  as in : they would n't change it in a heartbeat if a good fairy presented them with a wish ? 
  `` mommy look '' translates to * mommy , tell me you 're proud of me , cause i am ... *, 
  i hope this woman has a perfect poker face , poor kid ... 
  and now i ca n't unsee that . 
  i 've never really thought about it before . 
  not in these specific categories , but it was surprisingly easy and kinda obvious . 
  i also figured i have a thing for ron , apparently ... 
  can we post our choices here ? 
  i 'm curious what specific combinations people got . 
   and this is why i 'm a proponent of first watching the movies , and then reading the books . 
  i agree , but for entirely different reasons . 
  this way i have fun twice . 
  i love the movie , knowing all along that there 's yet better thing waiting for me !, 
  and then i love the book even more . 
  my mum always kept telling me otherwise and i believed she was right , and i did it her way ... until i got so irritated in a cinema once that i was seriously considering getting up and leaving . 
  i finished * eragon * in the morning and went to see the movie in the evening . 
  that was infuriating ... 
  i hated the whole thing . 
  and then a few years later i 've seen * inkheart * and i did n't know that there was a book . 
  i 've seen the movie multiple times before actually reading the book , and i still loved the book . 
  two pleasures beat one pleasure and one disappointment . 
  i do n't like the idea * of using the books to add details to movie-based images * . 
  i like works of my own imagination and even after seeing a movie i still stuck to my versions with another re-reading . 
  though , sometimes things on screen are so agreeable with my creation that i just adopt them ... e.g. 
  ron for me was absolutely perfect , hermione was rather close , but harry ... black hair and green eyes , anyone ? 
  and the movie version of sirius just makes me wan na cry ... 
  i keep ignoring them while reading but i still enjoy the movies on their own merit . 
  where do people get the idea that sirius * tried to kill * snape ? 
  he did n't . 
  snape himself said to harry something along the lines that it was a cruel prank that would have ended up tragically had james not intervened . ^ *, 
  what i gathered from the books was that it was a not-thought-through prank and sirius just did n't fully comprehend the consequences . 
  malicious ? 
  sure . 
  they hated snape , and vice versa . 
  it was said that snape always wanted to know where remus dissapeared on a regular basis , and potentially use that knowledge to get him in trouble . 
  sirius fed him the info about the willow so he 'd get scared off after meeting a werewolf . 
  you need to take into consideration sirius ' point of view . 
  he and the other marauders had hung out with a werewolf regularly and have never gotten hurt ( while in an animal form ) , so sirius could 've thought that the only difference was that they knew what they were in for and snape would n't , and therefore would get frightened . 
  and even more pronounced argument against * tried to kill * is that it would 've also , probably directly , killed remus . 
  do people really think sirius would have killed one of his best friends ? 
  intentionally . 
  really ? 
  as i see it , it was just sirius being massively stupid , short-sighted and inconsiderate kid . 
  even blinded by hatred . 
  but not murderous . 
  ^ * i 've ^ read ^ the ^ fifth ^ book ^ multiple ^ times ^ in ^ polish ^ and ^ only ^ once ^ in ^ english ^ and ^ i ^ do n't ^ remember ^ the ^ exact ^ quote, 
  i wrote that he * was being * , at that time , in that particular situation , as a teenager , not that he * was * all those things . 
  there 's a difference . 
  thank you for that quote !, 
  i 've been thinking about that very one since i first saw this thread but i was n't sure because i do n't have books around at the moment and i was n't able to check . 
  and people itt who confirmed op 's thesis that sirius-prankster was n't canonical did n't really help my confidence ... should 've trusted my instincts , huh . 
   no doubt snape was a bully too , we only got to see the scenes from his memory so that 's also very skewed . 
  i think remus says this in ootp or hbp to harry ... 
  i do n't remember when . 
  so now , a little more confident , i 'm going to take a risk and tell you that remus said it to harry when harry 's head appeared via floo in the fireplace of the kitchen at grimmauld place , when harry was disturbed by what he 'd seen in snape 's pensieve-stored memories ( james and sirius tormenting snape ) . 
  remus or sirius said that james was only fifteen when that happend and harry was indignant that he 's too fifteen and that it 's not an excuse , then remus said that james 's behaviour was regrettable but that snape never missed a chance to hex james , so it 's not like he was only a victim . 
  that 's ootp . 
  that whole action does n't look planned or thought-through .
