  i like your logic . 
  was n't it in 2010 ? 
  it 's not stupid , it makes you educated . 
  me on the other hand ... when i do it , it makes me narcissistic . 
  thankfully there 's always someone who needs a plumber with a plunger and they bring poland down to earth .

  * lol . 
   that is of cute poland but i have to be goings ... dont worry ... 
  poland looks * oh * so clueless and sweet on that panel . 
  and korea on the first one looks so proud i almost feel sorry for him . 
  nice touch with germany 's eyes . 
  yes , but that was n't something unusual for him to speak of politics , since he was a politician . 
  and as the prime minister - the most important one . 
  til , '' * kumpel * '' means the same in polish and german . 
  polandball can into education . 
  someone should send it to the bbc before they decide to make another * documentary * on polish fans .

  i especially like the * `` at the time , russia was occupied '' * part , because it sounds somewhat oxy * moronic * . 
  since when `` sneaky rear attacks '' do n't count ? 
  september 17th , 1939 , begs to differ . 
  the only thing i 've ever known about zanzibar is it being freddie mercury 's birthplace . 
  time to broaden horizons , i guess . 
  that seems reasonable , any idea what 's that yellow thing ? 
  you mean , the wars that ended with a truce each time ? 
  the ones that contain our most badass battles ever : the winged hussars , when the enemy had large numerical superiority - just to mention the battle of kircholm or the battle of klushino , * come on * . 
  the fact that our king at that time was from a swedish dynasty and he was kinda greedy , and his business was somewhat divergent from the country 's interests only adds . 
  the guy got into the war over the swedish throne with his own uncle . 
  not to mention that sweden went to war with poland only because they thought we were too preoccupied by fighting the russians back at moscow and then the turks , * seriously * . 
  have you actually read those wiki pages you likned to ? 
  if you 'd mentioned the deluge , then we could talk , but these wars , not really . 
  you guys ripped us a new one during the deluge actually , even though we eventually won that was rather pointless . 
  til - that 's a pretty cool story , i wonder who was more naive : he or they . 
  refund , you say ? 
  i think that being the only foreign force that has ever captured moscow and held the kremlin is good enough ;p, 
  edit : come to think of it , i 'm only sure about the kremlin . 
  that 's one lonely flower :(, 
  there 's probably a joke about the emigration to the uk in there somewhere , 
  i think [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/partitions_of_poland ) fits better in the case of poland , hm ? 
  * a friend in need is a friend indeed . 
  * bolivia can into friendship !, 
  sure there was some territory swapping , as in any war , i guess . 
  it started as a clash over estonia , if i recall accurately . 
  ( i have n't read those wiki articles either , * lol * , just scanned briefly to check if i 'm correct . ), 
  and the whole thing was running around the * dominium maris baltici * . 
  i always found it a pretty ballsy idea , and i think it was a swedish * ( ? 
  ) * one , to make the baltic their internal lake . 
  not that i 'd like to lose my beautiful polish coast , * thank you very much * . 
  yes , i know that we were the only ones to hold the kremlin , but we 're not the only ones to conquer moscow . 
  there were the mongols as someone already mentioned here . 
  napoleon 's army reached the city but that 's about it . 
  and the nazis but they did n't do well either . 
  did they even enter the city ? 
  i like the font change . 
  it suits .

  1867 - i will remember this one forever - cost me the best grade in junior high [ trauma big ] . 
  the only fucking thing throughout the entire exam that i did n't get right , i thought i might cry ... ; ,

  i like germany shedding skin on the seventh panel .
