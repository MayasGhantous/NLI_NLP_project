  also , the fact that there was no reaction from other characters about the fact that someone had been locked up for over a decade * while innocent * . 
  this . 
  * this * is what i ca n't wrap my mind around . 
  instead there were comments that he 's immature , saw harry as james , and was unable to let the past go . 
  well , how on earth would 've he been able to do that since he 's had no life since he was 22 ?!, 
  and then she f.cking killed him and there was n't even a funeral , memorial , whatever . 
  something , * anything * . 
  i * hate * what jkr has done to sirius . 
   your choice in pizza is rustic-looking but with substance . 
  lupin would be perfect for you . 
  i should be working right now , i have no excuse , really ... 
   i always felt like fred was the ringleader , so maybe it 's more potent that george has to live without him . 
  i 've always thought about it that way , from only one point of view , and then i 've read [ this ] ( https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9816242/1/the-exceptional-mr-weasley-and-his-approximation-of-obedience ) and felt really stupid that i 've never considered it from another angle . 
  especially since it 's really obvious if you try and think about it . 
  hope you like fanfiction . 
  sirius lives . 
  or at least has something good happening to him before he goes . 
  there are eight comments right now , arguing really various , not to say * ridiculous * , points ( people who do n't like refugees as the death eaters , morally gray , * really * ? ) . 
  but not one points out what i think is the most obvious parallel , the one that came to me instantly , and so it happens it 's also one that makes op 's quote make sense , so i 'm inclined to think that it 's what op had in mind . 
  that the death eaters = terrorists . 
  many people do n't like refugees because they are scared of terrorists . 
  since both groups happen to be muslim and come from the same places people are afraid that some refugees will turn out to be terrorists ; either a terrorist posing as a refugee , or a muslim refugee radicalised somewhere along the line that will turn out a terrorist . 
  ( after it became known that one of the paris terrorists came through greece as a refugee you can kinda see their point ) . 
  but that 's only one part , the bigger meaning i see is that * the refugees do n't divide into good people and terrorists * , that there are shitty people among the refugees that are not evil as the death eaters - thievs , cons , economical migrants that are not really refugees and just came for the benefits and free stuff and do n't want to work , or even the refugees who get kinda greedy ( do n't stop when safe but go on for the most money - although i think we 'd all do if we were them ) . 
  some refugees are rude , unpleasant human beings but that does n't equal them to the terrorists and they still deserve our help . 
  we should n't , must n't , paint all the people evil just because 1 in 10 is unpleasant , 1 in 100 rude , 1 in 1000 turns out to be a bastard ( not even close to evil ) , and 1 in 10 000 turns out to really be a terrorist ( actually evil ) . 
  we can not stop helping people who need it just because there are bad people amongst them . 
  so , does n't anybody see it that way ? 
  someone call the mods , i 'd bet some house points are in order !, 
  * uh ohh ... * well , i just wanted to make sure they 'll see it in case they 'd think it 's worthy ... 
  * blushes . 
  that 's fixable . 
  call me * pretty * one more time and i 'll hex you . 
  oh , but you 'd do it again , would n't you ?

  has it occurred to you that maybe that 's what putin wants ? 
  if nato were to kick out turkey that would establish a precedent for kicking inconvenient countries out . 
  why defend someone when we can just drop them ... that 's dangerous . 
  nato should be able to handle a crisis like that one . 
  without casualties . 
   poland wanted western belarus and ukraine . 
  check your facts . 
  what is now western belarus and western ukraine * was * poland back then . 
  and there was n't an independent belarus at that time , by the way . 
  also , you make it sound as if poland * wanted * that war . 
  * seriously ? 
   what was a western part of ukraine and belarus at the time , was the land poland was aiming for . 
  no , those issues were fought over in the polish-soviet war in 1920s , not twenty year later . 
  at that point poland already got what they wanted . 
   poland was negotiating with germany to be allies in a war against ussr, 
  except ussr attack on poland was a surprise . 
  everyone expected war with germany , though . 
  even if there was a non-agression pact in place . 
  and it was n't poland negotiating . 
  it was germany making proposals . 
  those `` conditions '' you mentioned is what they wanted in the first place . 
  when they did n't get their way , they took it anyway . 
  you make it sound as if poland wanted to be allied with germany and that was not the case . 
  germany tried to play that card just to get the corridor . 
  the question in this thread is * did anyone want ww2 ? 
  * you listed reasons countries had for wanting that war . 
  point 5 . says * poland wanted western belarus and ukraine . 
  * you suggested that was a reason poland allegedly had in favor of ww2 . 
  that 's not true in any way . 
  and to say that poland * wanted ww2 * , for * any * reason , is just stupid , or ignorant , at best . 
  why would anyone want that on themselves is beyond me . 
  it 's nicely executed , though . 
  you do n't have to be french to know who charlemagne was , or russian to know who peter the great was . 
  i went to schools in poland and i also find it weird that anyone in the western world ( at least ) could not know who william the conqueror was . 
  i find it especially surprising that many americans on reddit keep saying that their school did n't teach them some things that i thought were essential common knowledge . 
  i had people telling me they did n't know the greek mythology * existed * till they were twenty , or where/when ww2 started , or who amerigo vespucci was . 
  i still tend to think those were * special * individuals , or they just really did n't pay any attention in class . 
  i may be biased and eurocentric , though . 
  in that limited time in class we 're all probably taught mainly things that have to do with * us * , wherever we 're from , but you 'd still think some things are universal ; the ancient times and both * world * wars for example . 
  i 'd think in the relation north america/europe it 's especially weird . 
  you ca n't really tell their history without ours , and in europe we 're taught at least the most important events of american history ; much of which still have to do with us , * haha * . 
  now , as i mentioned the biased part , south american history in europe is mostly taught concerning the colonization period and the indians , asian through trade , wars and the ancient times , and about africa ( sans ancient egypt ) and australia/oceania i definitely learned more in geogrpaphy class than in history ( i bet it 's better in britain , though ) . 
  for example , i know nearly nothing about uruguayan history and i 'd bet they know as much about the polish one , but i 'd think it weird if they did n't know about mussolini or mao . 
  sure that everybody everywhere ca n't be taught everything , but some basics ? 
  i do n't really know why i typed all of this . 
  reading through this thread got me thinking and i just piggybacked your comment . 
  just thinking aloud , i guess . 
  feel free to ignore me . 
  hungary , my friends , if you say * serwus * in poland , you 'll be understood . 
  it 's obsolete , though . 
  also , * ahoj * is how sailors greet each other in polish . 
  i wonder how that came to be .
