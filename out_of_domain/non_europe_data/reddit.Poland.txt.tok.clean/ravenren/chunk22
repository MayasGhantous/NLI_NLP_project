  and a useless piece of trivia : * cze\u015b\u0107 * basically means hail/honour in polish . 
  but nowadays this particular word in that context is only used in expressions like * cze\u015b\u0107 i chwa\u0142a bohaterom * - hail and glory to the heroes ; found mainly on monuments . 
  you 'd think it 's a * serious * word , but as a greeting it 's something you say to your friends , rather than your teacher . 
  also , * batat * or * patat * for a sweet potato . 
  it was supposed to be ` vertical ' instead of ` horizontal ' , but somewhere between the brain and the keyboard ` diagonal ' got in the way , and the joke is that diagonal comic is even less convenient to read than a horizontal one . 
  * ca n't hear you ! * lalalalalalalalala !, 
  * of stronkest ! * lalalala !, 
   there is no black friday in poland but ok ... 
   president andrzej duda recently organized hanukkah celebrations in his palace . 
  well , his [ wife ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agata_kornhauser-duda ) has jewish roots . 
  tusk was ginger . 
  it fades in its way to gray .

  i love to shop in kids ' sections of zara and h&m . superheroes t-shirts !, 
  star wars sweaters !, 
  flanel shirts for half the price and in fun colors !, 
  i 'm 27 , 5 ' 6 and around 130lbs . 
  i 'm also in europe , and that numbers place mi in s/m size ( though i have sizes from xs to xl in my closet ) and kids ' options are just this , a fun option . 
  i ca n't imagine buying all my clothes there ... plenty of my friends are tiny compared to me , both shorter and thinner , and they all seem to have no problem finding clothes in regular shops . 
  i guess , i wanted to make two points . 
  for one , i think vanity sizing thankfully did n't catch up on this side of the atlantic yet . 
  and the other thing is if you like fun casual clothes you should really check some kids ' sections . 
  the t-shirts i bought from zara the other day were meant to for boys 146cm in height , but they 're big enough that my 168cm fit and there 's room for more . 
  it also was n't the biggest size they had . 
  and it cost peanuts . 
  even if you need some plain color tees you should really check kids ' stuff . 
  no one knows my white t-shirt that i wear to my * respectable adult attire * has zara kids on the label ... ( and i 'm not flat by any means . 
  90cm in both bust and hips . ), 
  are children 's clothes also subject to this sizing craze over there ? 
  first check , then talk . 
  and that , ladies and gentlemen , is the current western border of poland . 
  lithuania , ditch one stripe , we 're forming the commonwealth anew !, 
   little sea pig, 
  it 's the same in polish - * \u015bwinka morska * . 
  i was just wondering about it as there is a thread about guinea pigs on r/europe . 
  thanks for the explanation . 
  it 's kinda cool actually !, 
  the legendary king popiel who was eaten by mice comes to mind ... , 
  where is your * here * ? 
  i 'm in poland and the cheapest food are local fruits and veggies . 
  you could stock up on rice/grains and chicken and it still would be cheaper than any fast food . 
  add good quality water in the tap and it 'd seem it should be easier to eat healthy while poor than when rich ( when you 're unable to afford the temptations ... lol ) . 
   it must have a political undertone . 
  why ? 
  it was a mere observation . 
  people like to point it out the other way around any time a map showing poland comes up in this subreddit . 
  and i simply find such things interesting . 
  especially with * this * border . 
  not much of a philosophy , really . 
  a river is n't that much of a border as mountains for example . 
  although , probably , the history of that region would have been much nicer if it had been . 
  that 's so simple but so very interesting at the same time . 
  thanks !, 
  but hungary * is * a part of this group . 
  * oh * , and i was reading the comments from the bottom to the top instead of the normal way , and the theoretical part did n't even reach my mind ... sorry , 
  poland . 
  i do n't know why but just participation in such giveaways makes me happy as if i already won something , even though i never did , * haha . 
  * so exciting !, 
  you 're a very kind person , op . 
  what i do n't understand is why does wroc\u0142aw look smaller than pozna\u0144 . 
  hell , even lublin looks bigger , what gives ? 
  wroc\u0142aw is n't smaller than pozna\u0144 ; not in population , nor in area . 
  just the opposite ( them pesky city borders ! ) . 
  but wroc\u0142aw 's metropolitan area being smaller than that of pozna\u0144 surely explains what i was wondering . 
  probably also density messes up the visuals . 
  wiki says wroc\u0142aw is denser . 
  somehow i thought it would increase the prominence on the map and that is n't the case , but then again you have only so many shades of white , haha . 
  yeah , you 're probably right . 
  i do n't know why i thought it would be : the denser the city , the brighter ( more prominent ) the colour when it 's all white ... * hm * . 
  the only way to get into that thread is via clicking the entry comment but all there is is : [ removed ] , besides the comments . 
  whatever you added , it 's not there , not even the original text . 
  i think you should make a new thread so everyone could see . 
  also known as a free source of publicity for wannabe artists . 
  all you have to do is shit on a crucifix or sth , call it * art * , and show off on your exhibition . 
  the next day the whole country knows your name , you 're in the primetime tv , people talk shit about you , but they * talk * , and large amounts of morons will come to your exhibition just to * see * , or tell you what a twat you are , or shove their rosary in your face and pray for you , whatever . 
  then * profits * . 
  now , i 'm pretty sure in 1654 the polish-lithuanian commonwealth has been a thing for nearly a century ... 
  so what happened to the ferries between sweden and poland ? 
  well , granted , we had a guy who tried to steal a train for scrap , but it 'd be kinda problematic with a ferry ... 
  we 're a stressed-out species , it seems . 
  i 'd bet stress would prevail in most of the pink places . 
  yeah , well , we did n't lose any game either ... :(, 
  * szczelona * sounds like * strzelona * which means scored ... 
  this little fact was brought to you by * polish for everyone - get your z 's ready !, 
  * rus * and * russia * are not interchangeable . 
  one emerged from the other but they are not the same thing . 
  there was not such a thing as * kievan russia * , it was * kievan rus * . 
  nonetheless , the artificial term reflects something very much real , whether or not the people of then knew/used it ; while another term describes * another * thing , and those two things are not alike to a degree where you could just swap one for the other . 
  we could throw there * ruthenia * for good measure , and while you could say that * ruthenia * = * kievan rus * , if you try to put * russia * instead of * rus * in that sentence , you 'll pretty piss off some of russia 's neighbours . 
  btw . 
  the term * russia * came into use in the 17th century . 
  you made me smile so wide my jaw hurts !, 
  i will definitely take a closer look at your career . 
  so young and already so good , congratulations !, 
   it 's not as if poland was some jewish paradise, 
  actually , it was . 
  and for most of its history , too . 
   known as [ paradisus iudaeorum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_jews_in_poland ) ( latin for `` paradise for the jews '' ) , it became a shelter for persecuted and expelled european jewish communities, 
  why do you think they had the biggest jewish community in the world ? 
  but then again , in the early 20th century , it was n't good to be jewish * anywhere * in europe .
