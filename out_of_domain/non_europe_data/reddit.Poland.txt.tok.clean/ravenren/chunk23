  but being mean to someone does not equal committing the holocaust . 
  which was an industrialized , planned genocide for a scale unknown before . 
   non-german countries in europe love to whitewash their roles in the holocaust, 
  they do n't have to * whitewash * anything . 
  they did not come up with it . 
  they did not orchestrated and executed it . 
  and any cooperation was so marginal that trying to say they had a part in it is just factually wrong , not to mention highly offensive . 
  you may find [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/righteous_among_the_nations ) interesting . 
  and specifically for [ poland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_righteous_among_the_nations ) . 
  here 's some [ more ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rescue_of_jews_by_poles_during_the_holocaust ) . 
  for a country that owned up to its faults . 
  like [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jedwabne_pogrom ) or [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kielce_pogrom ) . 
  saying that they 're trying to whitewash something is really just bad will . 
  also , you may want to compare the [ punishment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rescue_of_jews_by_poles_during_the_holocaust#punishment_for_aiding_the_jews ) for aiding the jews in poland with its highest number of the righteous among the nations in the world . 
  and try to realize how unfair the phrase * polish death camps * is . 
   the imposition of the death penalty for poles aiding jews was unique to poland among all german occupied countries ( ... ) many families concealed their jewish neighbors -- were executed jointly by the nazis ( ... ) the entire wo\u0142yniec family in romaszka\u0144ce was massacred for sheltering three jewish refugees from a ghetto . 
  in maciu\u0144ce , for hiding jews , the germans shot eight members of j\u00f3zef borowski family along with him and four guests who happened to be there . 
  nazi death squads carried out mass executions of the entire villages that were discovered to be aiding jews on a communal level . 
  in the villages of bia\u0142ka near parczew and sterdy\u0144 near soko\u0142\u00f3w podlaski , 150 villagers were massacred for sheltering jews . 
  415 jews ( including 60 children ) were saved , in return for which the germans killed 568 people of polish nationality ( ... ), 
  polish christians and the jewish countrymen they protected , were herded into a church by the nazis and burned alive . 
  entire communities that helped shelter jews were annihilated . 
  and to add an insult to injury :, 
   additionally , after the end of the war poles who saved jews during the nazi occupation very often became the victims of repression at the hands of the communist security apparatus, 
  thanks for attention . 
  they ca n't decide between money , cuteness and beer . 
  ^ ^ ^ i 'd ^ ^ ^ go ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ beer . 
   download speed, 
  nah , that 's romania !, 
  in the thread you linked to , in a response to a brazilian saying '' * thanks for not coming . 
  we got enough problems as is . 
  no need for another gringo that thinks they can commit crimes and then be saved by the `` state department '' . 
   dude , we spend about as much on our military as your entire gdp . 
  and do n't forget they 've been to the moon too !, 
  and new york pizza ... because * why not ? 
  as a pole , our spelling is at least consistent and phonetic , english on the other hand ... 
  the one time when poland 's geographic position is a good thing . 
  the things this map does n't tell you :, 
  * people from the village * x * attend a university in the town * y * . 
  their registered permament residency ( there is such an obsolete thing as * meldunek * in poland ) is officially their parents ' house in the village * x * , while in reality they rent a room/apartment in the town * y * they 're really living in . 
  they return home for a weekend every week , then every two weeks , then once a month , then after five , or more , years ( at 24/25 ) they 're done with their studies , get a * real * job , a better apartment in the town and go home for christmas ... but if their first salary is not that great there 's a chance they 're still renting an apartment with flatmates and are not registered there . 
  result ? 
  26 years old living with mom , on paper , that is . 
  * the next thing is home ownership . 
  compare this map with the one that shows what percentage of the people own the apartment/house they live in . 
  you 'll see that scandinavia and the west mostly rents , while the east mostly owns . 
  most young adults where i 'm from ( poland ) aim for buying their own place , that usually occurs when they 're secure in their job ( mortgage , * duh * ) , and most people would wait * after * the wedding . 
  they 're nearing 30 at that point . 
  and if you 're a landlord you do n't have strangers to get a full time * meldunek * in * your * property because you can have a hard time to get a rid of them if the need arise . 
  that on top of the long list of things like : you ca n't get people evicted from october to march , you ca n't evict people with small children without securing them another place to live , forget of getting rid of a pregnant woman ... the list goes on . 
  not to mention the fact that paperwork here takes time and young people tend to move even faster . 
  * conclusion or ** tl/dr ** : the next permanent residency most people here get , after their parents ' place , is * their own * place . 
  literally . 
  that takes time , money , and other factors . 
  and of course money here is less and it 's hard to get your own * roof * when prices of those * roofs * are through the roof . 
  * story time !, 
  a girl owns a place ( that her mother paid for ) , a boy moves in with the girl . 
  on paper , the boy is still with his mommy ; his official correspondence goes to mommy 's place , but his bed is elsewhere , so is his fridge and his fresh socks . 
  the boy and the girl are in no hurry to tie the knot . 
  it 's all fun , but the girl wants to be absolutely sure , she owns a lot of stuff after all , and the paperwork is * bleh * . 
  they in their late twenties , life is good , things are safe , the time runs . 
  they 're better of than majority of their peers , you daresay , but a map that shows up on that reddit thing says 50 % of them have n't moved on since preschool . 
  nice cherry picking . 
  you 're ridiculous ... 
  romania 96.1, 
  lithuania 89.9, 
  hungary 88.2, 
  bulgaria 84.3, 
  poland 83.5, 
  estonia 81.5, 
  czech republic 78.9, 
  norway 83.5 and then ... 
  spain 78.8, 
  iceland 78.2, 
  portugal 74.9, 
  finland 73.2, 
  italy 73.1, 
  ireland 68.6, 
  sweden 69.3, 
  netherlands 67.0, 
  united kingdom 64.8, 
  france 65.0, 
  germany 52.5, 
  switzerland 44.0, 
  half of west is 4x-6x , and the rest all under 80 ( except for norway ... ) , while all the east is over 80 ( except of the czech republic 78.9 , which is still higher than the second from the west - spain ) . 
   you pulled up the home ownership rates as a explanation , as my `` cherry picked '' example shows , it is not . 
  no , i brought it as one of the things that * this map does not show you * . 
  things for considering before accepting for a fact those exaggerated numbers the map shows . 
  and it is a question as much cultural as it is financial . 
  the cultural * need * for buying your own place here is as important as close family ties that contribute to the italian number , for example . 
  and while most redditors on this subreddit would work out the reason for italy on their own , 99 % have no idea that most poles do n't feel they 're really on their own until they * own * the place . 
  many people live with parents to save money ( not to spent them on a rent ) and use that exact money a few years later when they 're looking for their own place . 
  financially , they could move out earlier and just rent , but then their ability to buy would considerably drop . 
  you need to put your own share even with a mortgage . 
  compare that to the swiss who have more money but tend to rent . 
  it is money , but money is not all it is . 
  ( does that sound yoda-like or just like i * can not into words * at half past midnight ? ), 
  also , your `` cherry picked '' example shows nothing . 
  because it 's norway . 
  which brings us to the next thing .
