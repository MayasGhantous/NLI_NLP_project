  * shit . 
  that 's a pretty wise thing to say . 
  not that desperate yet . 
  what 's not to get ? 
  poland 's awesome !, 
  i think it 's italy . 
  because he can carve ? 
  because [ daddy was disappointed ] ( http://i.imgur.com/r4cozny.png ) ? 
  okay , i did n't expect this , i have to give you that  * but * the boy in the first photo is too young to grow a mustache , and in the second one there is a stubble . 
  * yeah * , i know it 's not * the * mustache . 
  i know  but i really like what he did in there , so i decided to play dumb . 
  china can into zen . 
  this is a place where poland laughs that it got partitioned , my point is - just chill and do n't take it too seriously . 
  nah , we just [ use them ] ( http://www.britannica.com/ebchecked/topic/59923/bernardo-bellotto ) to get our status back . 
  you mean , if things had gone wrong , they would n't be the only one to blame ... ah , yes , * morale * . 
  ooh my god , you 're right !, 
  ^ * seriously ? 
  i 'm so used to polandball with reversed colors that when i saw one with white top and red bottom it looked * wrong * . 
  lol . 
  i was gon na make a joke but then i remembered i 'm polish . . 
  edit : [ shit keeps happening ] ( http://www.globalpost.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/medium/photos/10/poland_01_04_09_economy.jpg ), 
   i doubt it 's growth, 
  [ we 're * that * good ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2010/world/europe/06/29/poland.economy.recession/ ) ; , 
  i hate to break it to you , but major trade routes from north to south , and from west to east run through poland ever since early middle ages . 
  most notably the one from the baltic sea to the black sea or even the so-called amber road . 
  mainly because it being in the middle of europe made it kinda * hard to skip * . 
  especially when traveling took a lot of time as it was and you really did n't want to take the longer way . 
  and the sea coast with major ports ? 
  * +100 to trade . 
  * oh , * and the [ largest market square in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/main_square,_krak%c3%b3w ) that dates back to the 13th century ? 
  and as the wikipedia says [ * `` a major centre of international trade . 
  '' * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sukiennice ) any idea where did * that * come from ? 
  i 've heard that theory before but clean hands had nothing to do with this since we know how the disease is spreading . 
  also , i 've heard another one that blames the jews for the plague , and the reasoning was : if it did n't get the jews it had to be caused by them . 
  ca n't decide which one is more idiotic . 
  his concern is kinda sweet :3, 
  yay !, 
  * hugs *, 
  oh , hungary , please do n't be sad . 
  you know [ we love you ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pole_and_hungarian_cousins_be ) !, 
   it small and cute and look like me . 
  * aww . 
  * i 'm melting . 
  i just realized a stork looks like poland too . 
  * i 've read once the whole list of national birds ( on wiki if i recall correctly ) . 
  that was fun . 
  great idea for a comic . 
  love the line about penguin . 
  polan yuo of reason !, 
  edit : realization # 2 : that would have to be an imported penguin . 
  polan go back to school . 
  now that you said that it 's so obvious . 
  and heartbreakingly beautiful . 
  i 'm * weeping * ... 
  good melodrama - hollywood style with ridiculously epic soundtrack ;d, 
  you do realize that it 's how the world works , right ? 
  government vs. the people - the former just stands higher . 
  sorry , i 'm in an apocalyptic mood . 
  edit : grammar, 
   i 'm not sure what you do n't get , it 's quite literal [ + the picture ] . 
  the smaller one tells the bigger one what to do . 
  some tiny elite is equaled or even put in the superior position to the much bigger * `` opponent '' * but in reality , from perspective , it 's ridiculously unproportional . 
  oh , come on , why all the downvotes , what did i say to deserve that ? 
  i even made an excuse ... 
  oh , well , thank you  i was just starting to think that maybe today is not my day to put thoughts into words - got some downvotes earlier today . 
  drama big . 
   no , that 's trash . 
  there is no government vs. the people . 
  the people are the government , the government is the people . 
  the two are not two entities going head on ; they are the same . 
  that 's the ideal . 
  that 's how it supposed to be . 
  beautiful theory which often in practice sucks . 
  the people put the government where it is for it to represent them . 
  but the government in the position of power starts to feel cocky , glued to the stool , and * forgets * why it is there in the first place . 
  and that 's when it all starts to go south . 
  the government puts it 's own interests over the peopole 's . 
  and because government is made of people it 's flawed . 
  because , well , people are just people . 
  bear in mind my aforementioned apocalyptic mood . 
  i think the problem here is that it is easier to put them there , than to take them down . 
  some seems to be literally glued - against any logic . 
  it 's frustrating . 
   what else i should do ? 
  got ta love north korea ;d, 
  the last panel - classic . 
  and , * um * , do i want to know what 's that yellow puddle in front of finland ? 
  oh , that 's just brilliant !, 
  i was really hoping that 's not it . . 
  literal iron curtain is like literal coat of arms - brilliant . 
  you know how it is after a bad break up . 
  hard to remain friends . 
  they 're not fond of us anymore . 
  domestic violence . 
  24 years of therapy and they say there might be hope . 
  trust issues . 
  and lithuania says : oh , no , i 'm good here but you go !, 
  i was wondering recently where does this saying come from ? 
  that 's because he believes that people are essentially good !, 
  and look what he gets ...
