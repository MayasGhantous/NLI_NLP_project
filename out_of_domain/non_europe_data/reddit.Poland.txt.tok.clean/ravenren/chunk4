  he 's sort of a romantic , and we all know how they ended . 
  [ * seriously ? 
  * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pole_and_hungarian_cousins_be ), 
  oh , that would be incest . 
  you ca n't do that with your own brother !, 
  he 's adorable with those little wings ... 
  i did n't say it 's impossible , i said it 's hard . 
  i guess that 's because you , guys from the north , have much cooler temperament , to begin with . 
  also , we were violently separated , twice , by a third party . 
  i think a major factor here is looking for a guilty one and a lot of mutual accusations . 
   i think secretly everyone longs for the glory days of the commonwealth . 
  i most certainly do !, 
  but i was told you 're not a big fan of ours , because we were a little bully in charge ... 
  oh , thank god , i thought there 's something wrong with me when i came up with this the first time years ago . 
  i asked my friends if they noticed this too and it turned out that i was alone . 
  i was afraid to ask anyone else because i did n't want them to think that i 'm anti-semite or something . 
  also , that 's one of my favorites songs by them . 
  poland can not into good location . 
  i think that 's why so many of us ran to the uk - a friggin ' island !, 
   many germans like poland nowadays ... some day , we will into space together !, 
  that 's mutual . 
  rather a supervillain - the * law * part feels kinda oppressive ... + superpowers and you 've got a bully !, 
   jude and luke are terrible names in a book when you read it auf deutsch . 
  and johnny * depp * . 
  did you realize that you wrote * czechy * in polish ? 
  i just noticed that . 
  or was that on purpose ? 
  because now after a closer look i also spotted s ** \u0141 ** ovakia ;d, 
  it 's beautiful . 
  it 's called adblock . 
  [ that 's why ] ( http://www.dict.cc/german-english/depp.html ) . 
  * ouch * , that 's just massively creepy . 
  i cringed . 
  polan is of ~ ~ sad ~ ~ ~ ~ saddest ~ ~ pissed !, 
  borussia almost polan 's !, 
  borussia should into winnings !, 
  no worries , poland - you rock !, 
  he 's a fucking phoenix , he 'll get through . 
  one of my favorites quotes seems to be suitable here : * `` if you 're going through hell - keep going . 
  '' * - winston churchill, 
  that 's really nice blood . 
   is sweden keeping a bottle of piss behind his stool ? 
  oh , god . . 
  yeah , i saw , but that 's somehow , i do n't know , * natural ? 
  * , * spontaneous ? 
  * that bottle is * wrong * on so many levels . . 
   a girl here, 
  i knew someone would say that . . 
  ... who said anything about going to toilet ? 
  when you 're drunk you do tons of things you would n't normally do and that 's ok , because you 're drunk . 
  you came up with those things when you were already inebriated , it just came out that way - i mean - * shit happens * [ poland in the last panel ] . 
  but if you 're planning for all this weird inappropriate stuff to happen when you 're sober and sane then you 've got a problem , and it has nothing to do with being prepared . 
  it 's like crime of passion vs premeditated murder . 
  but i just noticed that sweden did n't actually bring that bottle with him [ i do n't know where i got that idea from !, 
  ] , just used one they 've already emptied so maybe it 's not that bad after all . 
  but it 's still gross - yeah , * i 'm a girl ... *, 
  ** just ignore me . 
  edit : as an afterthought , if he was good enough to take aim and use the bottle he could just use that toilet after all ... 
  it 's good he did n't confuse the bottles ... 
  oh , god . . * bis *, 
  we need more comics portraying ukraine !, 
  yeah , but they changed strategy and now they are threatening to cut us off instead . 
  * true freedom is to share *, 
  * all the chains our brothers wear *, 
  do you remember the great parade for the millenium ? 
  me neither . 
  so it was 966 . 
  edit : i just realized that if you 're under 20 y/o you may actually not remember 1996 , either . 
  then my method is useless . 
  anyway , that 's how i remember it without * actually remembering * . 
   by thy holy bollocks of john paul ii, 
   no wizard here , 
  a muggle , then . 
  we have history of removing kebab from premises . 
  preventing even . 
  face it , you need us !, 
  that was great !, 
  oh , sweden , what a fierce gaze you 're sporting in the last panel . 
  you must have interesting definition of * cute * . 
   you think they actually like it, 
  we * know * they like it . 
  yet another proof that the simplest ideas are the best . 
  feeling a little ambivalent today , are we ? 
  yep , people tend to be ridiculous when they glorify something . 
  one day , when i die choking on my morning coffee , i want an epitaph on r/polandball to commemorate that event . 
  the second panel is glorious . 
  * and now i 'll go to clean what i spilt ... *, 
  *** guys !, 
  *** ** polan can not into findings of plunger ... **, 
  ** is of stick , long and stiff , i left it on chair . 
  ** maybe someones sittings on it ... 
  [ ] ( http://redd.it/17nbms#mini ), 
  brilliant !, 
  i was laughing out loud throughout the whole thing . 
  oh , gee , poor germany !, 
  sealand * is not yet lost *, 
  * so long as * they * still live !, 
  * kie\u0142basa * festival without polan ? 
  ca n't be !, 
  you knew you 'd lose , admit it !,
