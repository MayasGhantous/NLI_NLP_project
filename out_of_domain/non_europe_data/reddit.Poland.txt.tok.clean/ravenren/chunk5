  * from the * main * land to * sealand . 
  ooh , austria , yuo of funniest !, 
  haha !, 
  ingenious !, 
  that 's a win-win situation . 
  how to allow gay marriage and still remain conservative . 
  they * 'll cross the * waters of * the * north sea ,, 
  they * shall be * sealandic . 
  he 's not on your right , he 's on your left . 
  look at the picture !, 
  i want one !, 
  poland 's ruling party is abbreviated to * po * , go figure . 
  oh , poor germoney can not into understanding !, 
  he of thinking of [ * bigos * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bigos ) !, 
  is of royal dish !, 
  * in the pots warmed the bigos ; mere words can not tell *, 
  * of its wondrous taste , colour and marvellous smell . 
  * one can hear the words buzz , and the rhymes ebb and flow , *, 
  * but its content no city digestion can know . 
  * to appreciate the lithuanian folksong and folk food , *, 
  * you need health , live on land , and be back from the wood . 
  * without these , still a dish of no mediocre worth *, 
  * is bigos , made from legumes , best grown in the earth ; *, 
  * pickled cabbage comes foremost , and properly chopped , *, 
  * which itself , is the saying , will in ones mouth hop ; *, 
  * in the boiler enclosed , with its moist bosom shields *, 
  * choicest morsels of meat raised on greenest of fields ; *, 
  * then it simmers , till fire has extracted each drop *, 
  * of live juice , and the liquid boils over the top , *, 
  * and the heady aroma wafts gently afar . 
  * like * prince roy * to * roughs tower, 
  * after * achenbach 's * occupation * ,, 
  ** edit : ** some native speaker , please , enlighten me :, 
  * `` the achenbach occupation '' * , or * `` the achenbach **** 's *** * occupation '' * ? 
  he 's the one who occupies , and not the occupied one . 
  and what about * `` the '' * ? 
  i 'm at a loss here . 
  almost like iphone in brazil , or something ... 
  * aww ... *, 
  i 'm really articulate today . 
  i know . 
   western europe was going to follow them, 
  well , that 's one way to put it . 
  did you just compare * the most serene republic * , a mainstay of tolerance and peace , to this * barbarous * russia ? 
  what an * indignity * !, 
  * a father , in * the storm, 
  * says to his * michael --, 
  what about [ this ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/14/business/apple-loses-iphone-name-brazil ) ? 
  yeah , sure , here you go !, 
  you 're gon na be a cube and wo n't rollin ' like everybody else . 
  awesome idea !, 
  you ca n't help but wonder what did some countries want that it turned out the way it did ... 
  * e mare libertas * - nice . 
  i wanted to insert it but it did n't exactly fit in my parts . 
  glad you did !, 
  and thanks !, 
  that was fun  one thing i regret - * d\u0105browski * in the refrain looks kinda out of place now that it 's all about sealand . 
  * huh * . 
  but it all turned out pretty well nevertheless . 
  so . . the soviet union did win , but we did n't ? 
  that 's not even double standard , that 's absurd . 
  ** edit : ** even more absurd from the polish point of view since we did n't see the soviets as the allies . 
  ever . 
  sorry for * drama big * here , but i 'm kinda touchy in the subject . 
  ** [ rant ] ** sure , that 's true , and that 's also what pisses me off so much . 
  we ended up behind the curtain [ not our fault , btw ] and moscow [ essentially the foe ] held the damn * victory parade * while we were n't even allowed to participate [ london ] . 
  and today you can find people who do n't know that poland was one of the allies . 
  and that 's ridiculous since it was the very first one . 
  but there are many who say that we collaborated with the nazis or created the death camps ... 
  ca n't believe i became one of those people who make * serious drama * on r/polandball . 
  * lol * . 
  have a pretty good excuse , though . 
  i 've just finished [ this book ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/for-your-freedom-ours-kosciuszko/dp/0099428121/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1370215226&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=for+your+freedom+and+ours+by+olson%2c+stanley+and+cloud ) and i 'm basically pissed so ... * shit happens * , i guess . 
  i 'm gon na get some sleep or something ... 
  yep , love you too . 
  i assume everyone on r/polandball knows that . 
  people on this subreddit are exceptionally well-informed . 
  [ and that 's why i like it so much ! ], 
  but there 's the rest of the world out there and once in a while you can stumble upon an idiot . 
   `` i enjoy the occasional spring breeze . '', 
  - usa, 
  and i want everything bigger and better ... 
  `` i 'd like to have a big family '' - russia . 
  oh , come on , it 's pure logic - if they won then we , as someone on their side , won as well ;, 
  if you say we did n't win and the main argument is that we ended up behind the curtain then there 's no way in hell you can count the soviet union [ the holder of that very curtain ] as a victor . 
  but it is widely perceived as one . 
  and then we have the polish pov : we - the good one , they - the bad one ;, 
  since they 've converted in the mid-step and now they are one of the good ones too , then so be it : we - the good one , they the good one ;, 
  no possible way , without being completly ridiculous , to make it into : we - the bad one , they - the good one ;, 
  and * the satellite state with no rights * is not an argument - you ca n't count outcomes as reasons . 
  that being said - it 's absurd . 
   clearly someone got dealt the better hand here . 
  that 's a really wrong thing to say , considering why those things happend . 
   there must at least be a good amount of antisemitism within poland , no ? 
  i am interested in your view on the topic . 
  okay , so here 's the thing - i 've always planned on writting such a thing , just for myself , to get stright my own thoughts . 
  so i did . 
  i started kinda eager , and since i wanted to get the whole picture there 's a lot of details , more or less crucial , and history since the 19th century , and a lot of stuff that i think is necessery to get it right , and in the result it got enormous . 
  i mean really big like 3k words ... and i 'm not even done yet . 
  i 've just ran out of power to carry on , so i 'm gon na finish it tomorrow , polish it a little [ no pun intended  ] and then i can pm it to you if you 're interested .
