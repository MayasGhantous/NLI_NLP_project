  i 'm not gon na post it here , since it 's massive . 
  if anyone else is interested , be my guest , but bear in mind that what i produced is my personal opinion , however objective i tried to be . 
  thank you !, 
   without `` the '' as its not a thing, 
  haha . 
  i was so determined to make it into * a thing * with the help of this very * `` the '' * . 
  but that 's when the *** 's *** got me confused , it did n't get along with the * `` the '' * . 
  and i 'd been staring at it until it stopped making any sense at all . 
  thanks for straightening things up for me !, 
   though , making an apple feminine is kind of insane . 
  * teacher : nouns in polish can be masculine , feminine or neuter . 
  * j : i see . 
  you mean like ` man , ' ` woman ' and ` micha\u0142 szpak ' ? 
  * teacher : not really , because ` man ' is feminine and so is ` woman . 
  * j : this is not going to be as straightforward as i had hoped , is it ? 
  i assume ` beer ' is masculine . 
  * teacher : ` juice ' is masculine , but ` beer ' is neuter . 
  * j : i can see how that could happen if you had too much . 
  * teacher : do n't worry . 
  polish is very logical . 
  * j : so this is the kind of logic that means you add masculine juice to neutral beer to make a drink for women ? 
  * oh , god * , we have those too . 
  i 'll be damned , literally , but some are pretty funny - in the wrong way , though . 
  but you ca n't help but laugh . 
  * wow * . 
  all it takes is to replace u with v and it looks intelligent right away .

   why was germany nuked ? 
  he said he wanted to visit . 
  it 's not a gag ... 
   you just have to know the gender of the word . 
  that 's right . 
  that 's also why native speakers of english have it easier to learn , say , french - they have no preimposed genders of words . 
  for me , half of the genders in french does n't make any sense . 
  la fen\u00eatre - since when a window is feminine ? 
  everybody knows it 's neuter !, 
  nice art . 
  simple but * wow * . 
  oh , * geez * , he could have asked for staying on the map this entire time . 
  watching from a distance is no fun ... 
  wow . 
  that 's a powerful comic . 
  and nicely executed . 
  ** edit : ** oh my god , poor word choice . 
  that was not intentional . 
  touch\u00e9 . 
  do i * seriously * have to explain that it was a joke ? 
  * really ? 
  ** edit : ** if anything , we did not surrender , so i feel authorized to joke ... 
  yep , also a joke . 
  i like indignant poland . 
  yuo of no hurting his friends or yuo 'll see !, 
  [ he even earned the final * `` d '' * this time , whoa ! ], 
  hahaha . 
  brilliant . 
  and a very good idea with setting china 's words vertically - looks right , and is hard to read - proper chinese , i 'd say !, 
  in poland , when someone is bragging about how * purely polish * they are [ usually some far-right freaks ] there 's always a person who 'll say that they should n't be so sure because their grandmother could have been raped by cossacks . 
  i never knew where it came from , and it 's quite popular . 
  what , no sweden ? 
  with words like * fika * i 'd be the first in line . 
  semi-relevant : * fika * is definitely my favorite swedish word . 
  not that i know any other . 
  ** duty ** before pleasure !, 
  that lady would love it in poland , within an hour she 'd meet at least five locals who apologized to her for their english not being good enough ... 
  [ here you go !, 
  that might be sleep deprivation on my part but russia here is very much like [ this gentleman over here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=p8j-ymvs1j0#t=135 ) [ 2:14 ] .

  the most serene republic is waaay too small in the first panel . 
  besides that , me likey . 
  man , without * the hat * you look just ... better put that hat back on . 
  while i ca n't !, 
  it 's so miserable and pathetic view that i can not find words that 'll do justice . 
  awesome hats are awesome but that * [ rogatywka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rogatywka ) * ... < 3, 
  i mean , who needs london when you have * this hat ?!, 
  britain , go hide somewhere , your funny top hat of no importance anymore !, 
  polan wearing rogatywka should into mighty comment inline images , nao !, 
  britain is in possession of more than a few ~ ~ fancy ~ ~ * fanny * hats .

  i am in awe of * everything * . 
  it 's a very well-drawn * everything * ... 
  louvre 's too mainstream . 
  it 's correct but more common would be * ja nie rozumiem ukrai\u0144skiego [ j\u0119zyka ] . 
  i 'm polish . 
  i 'd go even further and say that a pole would rather say that they do n't * know/speak * ukrainian rather than * understand * . 
  and then the sentences get rather different . 
  that 's the case with most comparisons between polish and russian/ukrainian/belorussian - they are pretty similiar but not to our * first choices * , if i can put it this way . 
  russian * ja ni panimaju * sounds similiar to polish * ja nie pojmuj\u0119 * but in that context it is almost not used hence people not familiar with russian at all [ youngsters ] might not get that connection and do n't understand , because they would expect * ja nie rozumiem * . 
   i of like getting whipped , you know . 
  well , that explains * a lot * . 
  he 's not a total loser he 's just into bdsm . 
  * wait ... *, 
   is poor poland still alive ? 
  is poland lost yet ?
