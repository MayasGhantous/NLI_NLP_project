  poland 's never lost . 
  * polish physics \u2122 *, 
  fun fact : our anthem was written when poland was already wiped out . 
  * so , * if it 's not * yet * lost while it does n't exist ... how could you possibly kill something that 's already dead . 
  i 've realized this just recently [ * best eureka moment ever * ] that it 's why people think polish anthem is pessimistic - they do n't have that crucial piece of information . 
  [ * yeah , i know we all here are exceptionally well-informed * ], 
  * polan !, 
  the christ of the nations *, 
  [ wait ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christ_of_europe ), 
  this might be the first comic ever where i laughed already at the first panel . 
   countryballs should remain balls -- redraw poland in panel 1 ,, 
  you 're telling him to kill the best part :(, 
  it is a ball , the air is just sucked ... 
  * wow . 
  * i mean * just * wow . 
  * all the feels . 
  it 's beautiful and ... 
  * wow . 
  edit : lithuania !, 
  come here quickly , i need to hug something ... 
  fun spicy fact : our last king was catherine the great 's lover ... * talk about conflict of interest . 
  i like how the events are described [ here ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/usefulnotes/poland ) . 
  also , [ bonus ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/usefulnotes/siegeofvienna ) . 
  the latter is actually pretty informative [ * gee , i learnt a few things i did n't know about * ] particularly it 's telling that sobieski 's linked to seemingly contradictory categories . 
  * hey !, 
  * we kinda rehabilitated in 1989 !, 
  besides , not our fault !, 
  * for real * !, 
  we [ just wanted be of friends ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vrnftfk.png ) ... 
  how * could you * say iceland not even into europe ?!, 
  bad lithuania !, 
  how would you feel if someones sayings lithuania * not even a country and can not into europ ??!!, 
  so , [ 1989 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolutions_of_1989 ) - we really like to think we did good . 
  i mean * really * . 
  i mean is of almost like in prophecy : * `` for on the third day , the soul shall return to the body ;, 
  and the nation shall arise and free all the peoples of europe from slavery . 
  '' * * ahh ... 
  [ ] ( http://redd.it/1nb0yd#mini -------------------- ), 
  our last king was a whore . 
  also , * geez * , i 'm saying this for the third time in the last 24h : * fun fact !, 
  [ the last king ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stanis%c5%82aw_august_poniatowski ) was of the [ * cio\u0142ek * coat of arms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cio%c5%82ek_coat_of_arms ) . 
  now , * cio\u0142ek * refers to a young bull that is shown on it but interestingly in today 's polish it also means not a very bright person - an idiot . 
  first things first :, 
  big brother bully : * um , really very sorry ... *, 
  and then :, 
   closer relationships between poland and lithuania start at ~ the xv ` th century . 
  i 'd say that 's [ the 14th century ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_krewo ) . 
   more of a diplomatic move, 
  * oh , come on * , i 'm sure the ~ ~ princess ~ ~ ~ ~ queen ~ ~ * king * was a hottie ...  [ edit : * this is getting awkward quickly ... * ], 
   open to debate - one could say that they started when jogaila and vytautas were born and he could n't be proven wrong or right . 
  i agree here . 
   by saying that the friendlyness started at the 15 ` th century i was reffering to the battle of grunwald - something you could say was the peak moment in the medieval history of our two countries . 
  i do n't agree here , * sort of * . 
  i think of grunwald as the * crowning moment of awesome * , for the time being , so to say that it was the begining kinda misses the point , but i guess this one is also * open to debate * . 
   try to of not causing riots after soccer games, 
  do n't remind me of these idiots , i 'm really suprised that they can write and spell . 
  i * love * how they 're sitting in a foxhole and the table has ornaments ... 
  i bet britain brought his finest bone china . 
  great punchline !, 
  i really like the comic but those circles look suspicious ... 
  well , i 'm sure i 'd need a miracle to draw one * that * good , but as he said , polan can not into wishes ... 
   it does n't have anything to do with the devil other than the movie the omen . 
  and * the exorcist * !, 
  sorry , could n't help myself  that was actually my first thought when i read about the alleged connection to the devil . 
  the second was that after watching * the exorcist * for the first time i bought a hamster just so i could name it damien ... 
  unless it 's voiceless at the end of a word - then it becomes * f * . 
  like in [ krak\u00f3w ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/pl-krak%c3%b3w.ogg ) . 
  i 'm sorry but i 'm not sure i understand . 
  what 's not to tolerate there ? 
  that the kid tried to impress/reason/argue his point and put some serious work into it ? 
  i 'd be really happy to have a child like that [ i 'm yet to be a parent ] , those are some favourable traits that should be encouraged and not something that should not be tolerate . 
  `` rules were not negotiable '' - that 's a little dangerous approach . 
  * everything * in this world * is * negotiable , parents can still say no and that 's it but i ca n't really imagine a situation when i would 've not been able to talk to my parents about anything . 
  even when they 'd already said no , if there are new circumstances - even made-up ones like that presentation !, 
  - you always should have a right to talk your cause . 
  we have that in courts - it 's called an appeal . 
  sure it should !, 
  you talk to the child , you explain , you present a variety of reasons , you answer their questions and none of these means that you are bound to let them do it . 
  you still can * and should * say no . 
  to negotiate means to talk and , if possible , to reach some agreement , it does n't mean that you have to submit to your child 's will , lol . 
  if a kid makes a presentation on alcohol it 's a great opening to talk to them about it . 
  i 'd even say that it should tell the parents that their kid trusts them enough to ask . 
  you can use that presentation to learn what your kid knows , are they aware of the danger that alcohol can cause , why are they interesting in it in the first place , if there are any lacks or misconceptions you can fix that . 
  that 's * a lot * . 
  and if it were my child i 'd definitely not agree to drinking as if they were an adult but at the same time i 'd rather have them try alcohol at home than god knows where , god knows what and with whom . 
  i mean , a sip of champagne on new year 's eve , as a treat , under your supervision wo n't kill them but can discourage any exploration on their own . 
  that 's what my parents did . 
  and i have a pretty healthy relationship with alcohol as an adult . 
  the number of times i get drunk as a young adult i can count on my fingers , and i pretty quickly got into that phase - * how to drink not to get drunk . 
  * i also had none incidents with drinking as a minor . 
  and i 'm willing to bet that it 's because alcohol was never the proverbial * forbidden fruit * for me . 
  there was nothing exciting or rebellious about it since i knew my parents ' stand on the subject . 
  and once i got into the age when i wanted to try and have a beer i told my dad - i was 16 [ i 'm in europe and the legal age to drink here is 18 ] - and the first thing he said to me was : if you are to do it , do it at home - show me you 're responsible with it , learn your reaction to it . 
  want to do the grown-up things - act as a grown-up - do n't hide , do n't misuse . 
  the truth is if , * when * , your kid will want to get a drink they 'll find a way , your job as a parent is to make it as safe as possible . 
  no amount of punishments and prohibitions works as powerfully as trust . 
  sorry but * tl ; dr * wo n't work here , 
  now that you put it this way , i agree . 
  my first impression was that you were n't allowed to even try to talk to your parents to change their mind . 
  thanks for explanation !,
