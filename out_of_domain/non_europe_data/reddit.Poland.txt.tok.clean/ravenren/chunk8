  * wow . 
  * i like this !, 
  even though there 's this little annoying voice that keeps telling me i should n't . 
  it 's brilliantly creepy and ridiculous in all the wrong ways . 
  i guess that makes a perfect polandball ... 
  i feel this unbearable need to point out that the sign was made by polish inmates which i always found the creepiest part of this . 
  / just in case someone did n't know . 
  yeah , in 2009 , reappeared ... in three pieces . 
  now it 's in the museum and they put a copy on the gate . 
  there were hats ?? 
  i ca n't believe i missed it : c, 
  awesome !, 
  of many thanks !, 
  but there * was * a happy ending !, 
  just delayed by 50 years ... 
  you 're terrible !, 
  of director 's cut . 
  well , underestimation of one 's opponent is the first mistake , often it 's also the last one ... 
  * ah * , you must be new here , obviously . 
  that 's not the genius part . 
  genius is where the fluid on the floor is tears and not something else ... 
  if by any chance you do n't have a wildly flourishing career in advertising , you should get one and quick . 
  but who needs blue ... 
  i lost it at * say , polant * . 
  you see , * palant * is an old-school way to say * a jerk * in polish ... 
  but not your regular meanie - criminal mastermind wannabe . 
  oh , no ... a * palant * is often a little clueless and not really capable of doing some elaborate harm on purpose , it just kinda happens on its own accord ... and then such * palant * takes all the credit but still does n't know what had hit him . 
  a * palant * is not only a threat to others but also to his very own person ... 
  glorious comic . 
  me likey . 
   the hell ? 
  did poland just urinate blood ? 
  * bia\u0142oru\u015b * has mean daddy who does n't let them play , and * litwa * ... well , it did n't end * well * the last time and now it 's all walking on eggshells ... 
  i must admit it 's a little unnerving to see murica instruct people about geography . 
  [ * `` neutrality means that you do n't really care, 
  cuz the struggle goes on even when you 're not there, 
  blind and unaware '' * ] ( http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/riseagainst/collapsepostamerika.html ), 
  the thing about neutrality , sitting astride on a barricade is damn uncomfortable and you can get hit from both sides . 
  and i think that 's the best thing about this comic , even though switzerland was neutral there 's always a gun pointed at them ... 
  one of my all-time favs . 
  for a brief moment i was wondering why is canada bleeding between his eyes ... 
  it seems it 's a weird place to start cutting after all . 
  i feel sorry for murica ... 
  at first sight you would 've thought it 's canada who needs to be pitied - all alone and left out in the cold [ no pun intended ] , but after a closer look - he 's not the one cordoned with a barbed wire , with no friends ... :(, 
  canada does n't seem to be bothered - a contented introvert , but ... 
  ... and * that anger * . 
  [ do n't mind me , i woke up this morning and started talking and talking and ... ], 
  man , we 're the best known flat passage of yurop , especially if you wish moving armies back and forth with no sweat , and [ yet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eight-thousander#list_of_eight-thousanders ) ... 
  can not into space , can into himalaya ^ tm . 
  close enough . 
  what book ? 
  holy shit !, 
  i 've always thought that the netherlands is screwed and low , we 're screwed and flat and you , well , you 're just unlucky and can not into winter sports , it never occured to me that it 's the [ same thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:europe_landforms_-_north_european_plain.svg ) that happend to us . 
  i mean , sure i knew what the north european plain is but that picture kinda enlightened me anew . 
  so ... since it 's been revealed that polan is denmark 's long lost brother can polan into scandinavia nao ? 
  monies plox ? 
  oh , come on , texas !, 
  you 're on your own !, 
  you 're a big boy already , you 'd know that !, 
  * lose your chains !, 
  free yourself !, 
  just do n't forget to take cal with you , he 's so bright and sunny , he does n't deserve to be left in that toxic enviroment ... without you two murica 's * nothing * . 
  ` did i do this right ? ` :d, 
  that 's understandable . 
  i love how all his * hopes and dreamings * are `` just '' hussar wings . 
  beautiful . 
  eesti , * you little * ... 
  my coffee just went through my nose ... 
  but if you think of it , it 's actually kinda happening , they 're just not called honestly . 
  lots of nuns here . 
  well , we all do . 
  in fact , i think it 's obligatory around here , 
  meaning : polan relevant . 
  i do n't know , my chopsticks fit pretty well ... 
  * class , todays of topics be :, 
  how reichtangle into neutral ... *, 
  [ ] ( http://redd.it/17rl9z#mini ------- ), 
  not into their 30s either . 
  i love you . 
  of girl . 
  tell me , stuhl , is n't being a perfectionist wearisome ? 
  i get it - polandball serious business !, 
  amen . 
  this . 
  perfect . 
  also , * mhmm * , lower silesia best silesia !, 
  * there . 
  and ~ ~ breslau ~ ~ wroc\u0142aw of ~ ~ polen ~ ~ polan . 
  * working on it ... *, 
  and guess what , you 're not the only one ... , 
  i 've always liked that little amendment ... 
  * if god is with us , then who 's * *** with them *** ? 
   england 's biggest achievement ... 
  hahahahahaaa, 
  indeed . 
  it makes more sense to you since that 's what you 're used to . 
  it sounds completely nonsensical to me . 
  i 'm polish . 
  everything in polish has gender , even inanimate objects . 
  and it 's not just feminine , masculine and neuter .
