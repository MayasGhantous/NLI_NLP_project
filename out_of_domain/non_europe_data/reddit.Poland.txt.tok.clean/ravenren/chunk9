  there are also masculine animate and masculine inanimate which have different declension . 
  every adjective/verb/numeral has to have a correct ending regarding gender , case , number ... etc. 
  i totally appreciate simplicity of english here !, 
  you do n't decide , you have to know . 
  and frankly , i ca n't imagine how people who learn polish as a second language do that . 
  in french or german there are articles so you just learn it along with the word , * le v\u00e9lo ; das fahrrad * [ a bike ] but polish does n't have that . 
  it 's just * rower * , you have to remember that it 's masculine . 
  but on the other hand , you can tell the gender by the way the declension goes . 
  * but * you wo n't be able to properly inflect without knowing the gender . 
  it sucks , i guess . 
  and there 's a fair share of exceptions like masculine animate that inflect same as feminine . 
  my favorite is * m\u0119\u017cczyzna * [ a male ] - gramatical gender is feminine and so is declension , but all the other words attached to it have to be as if it were masculine for the obvious reason :d, 
  and yet you call all animals * it * in english . 
   if it ends with a consonant , it 's masculine , an - a , it 's feminine , an - o , it 's neuter . 
  generally true , but there 's too many exceptions to leave it at that . 
  edit :, 
  sure you know your dog 's gender but to describe an unknown dog on the street most people would use * it * , that 's what weirded me out a little on the beginning because for me it sounds like treating an animal like an object , we 'd say * he * about any dog until it 's known it 's a * she * . 
  just an observation . 
  prophylactically , but he failed to take the hint ... 
  sure !, 
  it 's been this way for as long as i can remember . 
  * wait * ... 
  ever heard of the * there are no girls on the internet * theory ? 
  you could give them a run for their money with that logic . 
  feminine . 
  literally * a whore * . 
  used as a filler/intensifier/interjection . 
  translates to * fuck * / * shit * . 
  where did you get that from ? 
  you know about that miserable excuse for a song and you know how to spell that , so what are you exactly asking me about ? 
  that 's exactly what * grammatical gender * is about . 
  that 's why * m\u0119\u017cczyzna * is grammatically feminine . 
  like * hrabia * and some others . 
  i 'm not conflating anything but it might be that in english it 's called differently than in polish . 
  * m\u0119\u017cczyzna * as a noun is masculine - that 's * gender * , but * grammatical gender * is precisely based on how inflection happens , and here * m\u0119\u017cczyzna * is feminine . 
   it just so happens that in polish , words ending on ` a ' form a declension class with , for example , a genitive on ` y ', 
  word 's ending is unimportant , here :, 
  miecz - miecz ** a ** * m * animate ; like wuj - ~ ~ w\u00f3ja ~ ~ wuja , pies-psa, 
  it 's genitive 's ending that 's counts . 
  you basically sad that but the other way around . 
  what you called 1 ) gender and 2 ) declension class , i called 1 ) gender and 2 ) grammatical gender , like there 's a difference . 
  i think i made that clear . 
  i had n't checked beforehand the english nomenclature , though . 
  hence confusion . 
  edit : ortography , lol ;d, 
  * whoa !, 
  * ** stop ** . 
  we 're talking about * linguistics * here . 
  i stated in my first post the difference between ** two languages ** , ie . 
  english * and * polish . 
  and told how the english version seems from my * polish point of view * and the construction from * the polish language * that i 'm used to . 
  and how in english it being different seems * weird * . 
  and out of place . 
  i thought people on this thread are * curious * about languages , * boy was i wrong !, 
  here you are , another person , telling me how your version is * better * and that you 're gon na continue using it . 
  did i even propose any change ? 
  i wo n't even mention the guy before you who i thought was trying to by funny/sarcastic [ and i replied that way ] but based on all the downvotes i 'm not so sure anymore . 
  you people need to get the fact that english in not the * only proper * language . 
  it 's just one of many . 
  well , sorry , wrong place , wrong time , i guess  it 's just that it was meant to be a curiosity , and i even put * `` just an observation '' * at the end , just to be sure , and it 's all for nothing . 
  * nakurwia\u0107 * has a somewhat general meaning of * do/proceed * , and rather violently at that . 
  it 's similar to * napierdala\u0107 * . 
  the main point is the former contains * kurwa * , while the latter contains * pierdoli\u0107 * [ to fuck ] . 
  both have the same * main * meaning and there are several other . 
  depending on the context * nakurwi\u0107 / napierdoli\u0107 * might mean to get drunk , * napierdala\u0107 * might mean to beat someone up or to do something excessively , like to put too much food on a plate or sth . 
  like most vulgarisms they 're [ really universal ] ( http://www.linguatrek.com/blog/2011/07/how-to-swear-like-a-pole-pierdoli%c4%87?page=1 ) , 
  there 's a difference between * nakurwi\u0107 * / * napierdoli\u0107 * and * nakurwi **** a **** \u0107 * / * napierd **** a **** l **** a **** \u0107 * - the first pair is used when something occurs once , and the second one when something might be repetitive and/or continue for some time . 
  * w\u0119gorz * means * an eel * and the whole thing [ nakurwia\u0107 w\u0119gorza ] is a rather lame meme derived from the song you linked to and , as the urban dictionary explained it to me , it 's * a `` dance '' occurring after consumption of substantial amount of alcohol . 
  characterized by rigid arms and circular movements with your bend knees . 
  * [ i feel somewhat worse now that i know that ... ] but at the same time it apparently is a phrase good for every occasion , whatever that means ... hope i helped , 
  edit : * nakurwi\u0107 * / * nakurwia\u0107 * - infinitive ; * nakurwiam * - first person singular ;, 
  i would n't say that * he * and * she * `` express nothing '' . 
  and that 's essentially what i was referring to . 
   not true . 
  that 's exactly true . 
   there are no articles in ukrainian or russian languages . 
  yeah , that 's why * the * appears in english and not in ukrainian/russian ... 
  * ukraine * in the slavic languages is basically a description , i do n't know about ukrainian or russian , but in polish * ukraina * comes from * u kraja * - at the end/border . 
  [ the fact that * kraina * happens to mean land made it perfectly fit for a name for a country ] . 
  since there are no articles is the slavic languages that name makes a perfect sense for us , but in english you need an article before the adjective . 
  you can say * britons * but you have to say * the british * . 
  hence * the ukraine . 
  * and , by the way , their government 's been [ fighting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/name_of_ukraine#.22ukraine.22_versus_.22the_ukraine.22 ) the * the * since 1993 . it 's obsolete . 
  and the anthem was written while poland was partitioned , i.e. 
  did n't exist , and what it says is basically that * poland is not yet lost * ** nevertheless ** . 
  and then goes on on how we 're going to get back what 's been taken from us . 
  it 's inherently positive !, 
  one just needs to know all the circumstances to properly appreciate it . 
  edit : tasty letters, 
  so , here i was in the middle of a perfect sandwich and i scrolled to the last panel ... 
  * shit got real * ... ...
