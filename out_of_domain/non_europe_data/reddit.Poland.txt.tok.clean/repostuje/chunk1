  how did it look before taking it out ? 
  mastering my game takes about a year ( taken from observing players ) . 
  i simply do not have time to play it for a year . 
  rpn maybe ? 
  does this work both ways ? 
  is n't this as bad as promising gifts from santa if the child behaves correctly ? 
  these are socks hanging from a ceiling . 
  i 'm running an online community , with about 20000 unique gamers playing my game every month . 
  basing on my previous experiences i 've designed a game that gives an average gamer one year to master . 
  after that time , some players leave , some stay only for social interactions with other players , some notice that they can seek for a in-game moderator rank . 
  some of them become heavily irritated with game , channeling their frustration on the game forums , picking holes in smth and generally trolling on the forums or in-game . 
  i 've decided that the best way is to isolate those gamers , i.e. 
  that 's the best way i know to keep the community healthy . 
  banning players based on their hardware serials , and impossibility to register a new account on forum after getting banned on existing account are a godsend . 
  some people may regard this as a bad practice , but it 's a practice that works . 
  poland probably . 
  it 's simple - it ai n't broke . 
  the game has content to keep an average player entertainted for a year . 
  i consider this much for a game that was coded only by me . 
  it 's just a small amount of players thet start trolling and hating after reaching the level ` oh i saw everything ' .

  the specific port combination , and the fact that both of them are < 1024 is strange . 
  examine this connection using tcpdump .
