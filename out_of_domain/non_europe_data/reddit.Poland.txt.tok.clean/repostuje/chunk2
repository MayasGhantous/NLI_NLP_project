  currently it takes about hour for me using public communication and 20-40 minutes using a car . 
  you can call for a taxi at any time . 
  i strongly suggest ` ryba taxi ' , as they 're preatty cheap . 
  have not tried uber yet , though . 
  the charge should be about 15 z\u0142 . 
  i would n't use a taxi if you have a direct public communication connection available . 
  you can get an urban card and buy a monthly ticket that allows you to use all trams , buses and trains in wroclaw freely .

  probably every renter prefers long term rentals , and many will refuse in advance when you 'll state that you 'll want to rent for only 3-4 months . 
  you 'll have to call few of them and just ask ... or just sign a rental agreement that does not specify renting period ( umowa na czas nieokre\u015blony ) and just terminate it after 3 months . 
  regarding the furnishure , it really varies . 
  there 's no standard equipment . 
  also i would advise against renting without visiting the place physically .

   nothing is happening against democracy . 
  yeah , paralysing the constitutional court , no big deal . 
  literally everyone besides ~ ~ government ~ ~ ruling party is ringing up the alarm . 
  edit : government is ringing up the alarm too . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_constitutional_crisis_ ( poland ), 
  in short : both president and the ruling party openly break law and move forward with suppressing any oposition . 
    yeah , paralysing the constitutional court , no big deal . 
   same constitutional court which did nothing for people ? 
  source needed . 
   nobody is ringing alarm . 
  let 's see , who 's this nobody , in government bodies :, 
  and of course the constitional tribunal itself , as it has declared many times that changes espoused by the running party are unconstitutional . 
  following educational counsels publicly advised to refrain from actions that may paralyse tribunal :, 
  and of course , many experts , many international organisations . 
  prawo i sprawiedliwo\u015b\u0107 with our president openly ignored all of above protests , including the judgments of the tribunal court , thus breaking the law . 
  they do so because they know that they can not yet be judged for it , because they have the majority in the government . 
  in my opinion , the 're driving us clearly into dictatorship . 
  edit : what 's worth adding , is that after the ruling party forced this flawed law , president signed it almost immediately , despise many calls to refrain from doing it . 
  president 's office stated , that they did that after requesting several lawyer expertises . 
  when asked , who made tthem , they denied publishing it . 
  there 's literally no lawyer ( unbound to ruling party ) that publicly supports this resolution - http://www.tvn24.pl/wiadomosci-z-kraju,3/kancelaria-prezydenta-o-opiniach-prawnych-nowelizacji-ustawy-o-tk,606342.html, 
  imo current government is driving us into dictatorship . 
  taxes and socialism does n't have anything with dictatorship . 
  ignoring tribunal court judgments and pursuituing its paralysis do .
