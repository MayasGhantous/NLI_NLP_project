  if you do n't know whether you should believe media , then just check at the source . 
  government organisations that protested against recently introduced laws :, 
  - and the constitional tribunal itself , as it has declared many times that changes espoused by the running party are unconstitutional . 
  following educational counsels publicly advised to refrain from actions that may paralyse tribunal :, 
  and of course , many experts , many international organisations . 
  and to answer your guestion : i would like our president and ruling party to respect laws . 
  currently they 're openly breaking it . 
  they do so because they know that they can not yet be judged for it , because they have the majority in the government . 
  in my opinion , the 're driving us clearly into dictatorship .

  ~ ~ guy on the left ( the one 's owning the camera in top right corner ) left the intersection without giving preference to the vehicle on the right . 
  he is at fault . ~ ~ it 's a guy at right fault . 
  it 's a very shitty intersection . 
  imagine what happens when a snow falls and no one can see the lines on the road . 
  you 're right , the guy at right could not turn left here . 
  how about not serving ads with malware ? 
  why not . 
  how about providing ads only via https , as you already punish sites delivered without encryption ...

  also , they sometimes pay their students just to attend as they 're getting subventions for every student . 
  not so long ago people were attending such schools to avoid military service . 
  i 'm a native ( polish ) speaker and the fact that the name is unpronounceable even in polish makes it additionaly hilarious .

  - halo ? 
  - tak . 
  - hahaha !, 
  - made in china . 
  i do not think that is the case . 
  great firewall spoofs dns responses to people inside of china , making them to connect to random ips , mostly with other protocols than dns . 
  the behaviour that op described could be a dns amplification attack . 
  in that scenario , an attacker spoofs queries to dns servers to have an attack target source address . 
  each request - usualy small - is replied with a much larger response that is sent to spoofed source , thus amplyfing the attack and eating up bandwidth . 
  those attack were pretty popular several years ago , when many dns server were responding to almost every request and also allowed for ( quite large ) zone transfers . 
  simillar attacks were performed with chargen and ntp service which also work over udp and can be easily spoofed .
