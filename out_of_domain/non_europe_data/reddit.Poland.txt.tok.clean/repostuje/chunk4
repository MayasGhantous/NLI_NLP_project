  is this some heavy machinery ? 
  i believe that you ca n't open them ` wrong ' , there always some hinge catching the window . 
  a polish man goes to the eye doctor . 
  the bottom line of the eye chart has the letters :, 
  c z y n q s t a s z, 
  the optometrist asks \u201e can you read this ? '', 
  \u201e read it ? '' , the pole replies , \u201e i know the guy ! '', 
  no c\u00f3\u017c , \u017cart jest raczej dla [ obcoj\u0119zycznych ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/jokes/comments/49copy/a_polish_man_goes_to_the_eye_doctor/ ) , dlatego wklei\u0142em po angielsku :-) .

  it 's really a tape memory . 
  i remember my grandma watching that russian guy in poland too . 
  it was surreal . 
  and so the witchhunt continues ...

  - ansible for server installation and configuration management, 
  - jenkins for code deployment and semiautomatic tasks like copying a database from prod to wait, 
  - bash and python for all the rest , i.e. 
  making a screenshot from rectangular selection then uploading it and copying the url to clipboard , checking my work calendar , converting images ( imagemagick ftw ) , putting my wife 's computer to sleep at 3am or really anything that is repetitive .

  here 's a solution that i use : https://www.google.com/settings/account/inactive, 
  it makes a decision based on your google account activity . 
  found it on random polish electrical usenet group . 
  newsgroups are still somewhat popular here , and i mean normal discussion groups , not some binary warez . 
  there 's no influx of new users , but those who stayed are still faithful . 
  i lurk daily on ~ 10 groups .

  that trilogy is really amazing . 
  and if anyone fancies an audiobook , [ this one ] ( http://audioteka.com/pl/audiobook/narrenturm ) has an amazing quality - recorded by over 100 actors . 
  obviously , in polish . 
  if the router administrative interface is available from internet , then an attacker could override dns settings and perform mitm on all of your connections , sniff your traffic or alter it , for example to steal money from your online bank account . 
  i would not agree with it . 
  from top of my head i can name mailman , nagios/icinga , munin . 
  to be clear , i 've just named few apps that run under cgi and are written in perl or python , not that they are vulnerable to this . 
  i would not be surprised if it would also affect perl , but i agree that neither munin nor icinga/nagios seem vulnerable . 
  they do not make any http requests . 
  i 've chuckled and then feel bad about it . 
  from the dark army ? 
  it seems that they did n't suffer much from the hack , people that had accounts with them did . 
  sure , but i am not a python expert . 
  on what subreddit are you running it ? 
  which python version/os do you use ?

  for anyone wondering about background audio : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdmzvyc8ku, 
  in europe , kfc and burgerking are ran by the same company and are often located side-by-side . 
  in poland both are ran by amrest and only amrest for sure , though this photo was not taken in poland . 
  they state that they operate in russia on their webpage : https://www.amrest.eu/sites/default/files/infografika_dla_inwestorow/infografika-inwestorzy-v2-eng_0.jpg but maybe they 're not the only one franchising those brands . 
  edit : according to [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amrest ) , yum !, 
  and amrest is a joint venture :, 
   in 2000 , amrest holdings was formed as a joint venture company between american restaurants and yum !, 
  brands , and in 2001 the new company took over international fast food polska , the operator of the burger king locations in poland . 
  all burger king restaurants were soon converted into kfc .

  serious question : is it sensible to call a police in such case ? 
  he 's posing a threat to himself and people walking below . 
  imgur albums are slow as hell . 
  it 's just gollum in search for his ring . 
  great suggestion . 
  i 've tried it though and it seems that i ca n't enter a rule without disabling in-app browser for images ( like gfycat ) links . 
  actually , she does not like to be touched at all :( . 
  tell that to my grandma 's . 
  good point , but there 's more than that . 
  is it people 's fault that one can not buy groceries on catholic holiday ? 
  why is one religion deciding what i can or can not do in my free time ? 
  who is to blame for children discriminated in school for not attending ` religion ' lessons ?
