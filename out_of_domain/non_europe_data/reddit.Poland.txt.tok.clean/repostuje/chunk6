   who is fred 's boss ? 
  i do n't know but it seems obvious that the whole tycho station has to belong to some corporation . 
  and even if it is under his complete control , there are still citizens living and working there , and they just lost their major ( and only ? ), 
  contract . 
   at this point , all of humanity knows that eros is on a collision course for earth .

  he can steal your ssh agent connection and connect back to your box if you have your key in authorized_keys and the firewall allows it . 
  there is a scenario that not many people are aware of :, 
  if you connect to some server with ssh agent forwarding enabled , then you can use your agent ( and a private key stored within ) to connect somewhere further . 
  a root user on such server can steal your ssh agent connection ( which is just a socket ) to connect somewhere on your behalf , using your ssh agent and your private key without actually obtaining it . 
  i do n't have any source . 
  just examine your shell environment after connecting somewhere with ssh agent forwarding enabled . 
  it 's a running prank in my job that we test on new linux admins . 
  cover was probably metal , and that caused it to be stolen . 
  hopefully they 'll replace it with a concrete one .
