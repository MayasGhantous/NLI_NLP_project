  what 's the correct way to solve this equation ? 
  i 'm halfway reading that book ( so no spoilers please ) , and just wondering whether harry will appear . 
  should i implement dns and rdns names for end-user computers in ipv6 connected lan , that use autoconfiguration via ra with privacy extension ? 
  is n't that contrary to privacy extension mechanism ? 
  i 'm currently loosing about 4kgs ( 9lbs ) per month by using lazy keto . 
  i restrict my carbs , but do n't pay particular attention to the fat <  protein ratio nor i do n't count my calories . 
  i 'm wondering , whether should i switch to strict keto for faster weight loss . 
  what are the safe values for weight loss speed ? 
  how fast is too fast ? 
  i 'm an avid audiobook listener , but i 've yet to try listening to an english audiobook . 
  does audible have any audiobooks that are recorder by a group of actors ? 
  are they marked somehow ? 
  like , for example , this audiobook ( in polish ) : http://audioteka.pl/cos-sie-konczy-cos-sie-zaczyna,produkt.html,

  so i 've just started analysing benefits of extending mail servers in my company to send and receive mail using ipv6 . 
  i 've checked most popular global e-mail providers ( like hotmail , gmail , microsoft , yahoo , hotmail ) and those that are popular in my country ( wp.pl , onet.pl , o2.pl , interia.pl ... ) . 
  from that what whole list , only google accepts smtp via ipv6 . 
  is there something wrong with using ipv6 for e-mail that 's stopping those companies from using it ? 
  is it worthwile to use ipv6 for my mail servers or am i destined to run into some problems ? 
  i 'm a game developer and i have a somewhat popular online game . 
  i would like to embed every player id ( integer ) in game gui . 
  screenshots made in-game are originally stored as pngs , but mostly end up recompressed to jpgs after uploading to imgur or posting to facebook . 
  my first thought was about encoding player id as 4 pixels stored in 4 corners of the game view . 
  game offers a 3d view so it would be almost invisible to most players , and would give me 4 * 3 = 12 bytes of information . 
  although that would fail immediately after the image is recompressed to jpg . 
  the other way i came up with is to slightly alter a color of few big gui elements , so they wo n't be blurred or affected by block compression algorithm . 
  the only thing i do n't know is how jpg compression alters colors and by how much can any color be deviated from original . 
  does / r/steganography have any tips or guides on creating stego for files that will be recompressed as jpg ?

  i have two rabbits since a week , an adult male ( neutered few days ago ) and an a about 3-month old female . 
  it 's the first time we 're having rabbits as pets . 
  their cage is open almost all the time and they are free to roam the living room . 
  they 're still getting used to new place . 
  male started to chew on cables - yesterday he bit off my headphones and today he disconnected my wife 's internet . 
  i know that chewing on things is their nature , but are there any tips how to discourage them for chewing on cables ? 
  i 've noticed that they love to chew on apple tree branches . 
  will providing them in abundance deter them from chewing on other things ?
