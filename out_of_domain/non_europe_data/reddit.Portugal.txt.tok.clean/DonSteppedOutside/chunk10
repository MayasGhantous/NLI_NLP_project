  got ta have that possession, 
  gostava de o ver no porto !, 
  como sabes ? 
  o meu hino favorito ( sem ser o nosso ) \u00e9 o da [ rep\u00fablica democr\u00e1tica alem\u00e3 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtv92wqyjfa ) . 
  good times . 
  the only thing i know about cura\u00e7ao is the music of wim statius muller . 
  is he well known over there ?

  que \u00e9 excelente !, 
  lost 1-3, 
  i did n't bet on them because i knew what was coming . 
  porto does n't care at all about ta\u00e7a da liga and that team rarely plays together . 
  plus they have one of the most important games of the year on saturday against sporting so it was a dangerous bet .

  just watch it !, 
  it ai n't that bad . 
  not great bob, 
  that 's the million dollar question .

   you think he a good prospect ? 
  absolutely . 
  he is one of the best young gks i 've seen in porto . 
  he absolutely deserves a chance in the first team when casillas and h\u00e9lton retire . 
  god damn i love gudi\u00f1o . 
  thank you mexicanos !, 
  no highlights but god damn it was a fucking great match !, 
  the team played with so much passion !, 
  honestly in the next league cup match i 'd swap the a team with the team that played today , if i could . 
  yes , no one can break their spirit . 
  vit\u00f3ria scored and they just kept pressing until they scored . 
  i 'm so proud of them .

  what about the movie with mewtwo when ash turns to stone and the pokemon start crying ? 
  damn man that one hit me hard when i was a kid ...

  it 's probably all the emotions, 
  i remember mcmanaman because i have a dvd of a game where we beat england in like 2000 and i always found his name to be a bit goofy . 
  jan koller, 
  i know this mokoena was a legend in fm and my cousin used to buy him and another lad all the time . 
  take a look at this powerful freekick from hulk when he was at porto !, 
  very nice , where 'd you find this blog ? 
  done :d, 
  espero que se confirme . 
  not if he wins the olympics .

  oh que caralho , apanharam-me desprevenido a ver o eibar - las palmas para o placard ( ganhei 15 $ btw ) e a ver o debate do marcelo - sampaio da n\u00f3voa . 
  why is that ? 
  placed a 1 $ bet with celta and las palmas to win and won 15 $ .
