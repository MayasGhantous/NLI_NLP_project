  4-4-2 losango here we go ... 
  and a 3rd division title !, 
  i think he 'd adapt well to the premier league . 
  he 's very strong and he 's got good muscles on him . 
  suk will have to be our dzeko lmao, 
  was it aaron chalmers ? 
  if you 're looking for tips you already failed according to their website . 
  you just got ta figure things out yourself apparently . 
  i use a wide midfielder and konoplyanka works really well in the left position . 
  last season he had 11 goals and 10 assists in 33 matches . 
  this season he has 9 goals and 12 assists in 24 matches . 
  he may not be world class but he has the consistency i look for . 
  well sometimes high pa does n't mean he 'll be a god , sometimes he 'll just be very good because his attributes are misplaced for the position and he may have low consistency , professionalism , adaptability and determination . 
  but this is not the case and this guy is good . 
  and fucking thank you for including the attribute octagon , it 's so much clearer what his strong and weak spots are . 
  i do n't know why people often do n't include it . 
  i do n't know about fm16 man i still have n't played . 
  but on fm15 you do n't need other skins . 
  can you do this ? 
  i 'm on fm15 . 
  it 's the attribute analysis option . 
  should give you this :, 
  i 'm very confused and i do n't know if this is a deal i made or a bug because i keep receiving 35k $ from time to time and i sold this guy in 2017/2018 . 
  i 'm in 2023/2024 now . 
  oh yeah sorry about that . 
  fixed it , 
  well 35k does n't make much of a difference when you 're 20 million in debt lmao,

  this is clearly a practice match , they do n't even care about the result ... 
  suk has been playing really well . 
  you can tell he 's working very hard today . 
  if we start playing with 2 strikers he 'll be a starter definitely . 
  who am i rooting for here ? 
  ok i 'll pick the home side . 
  always rated bani yas . 
  royston drenthe , the man himself , is playing on our side apparently . 
  no way we 're gon na lose .
