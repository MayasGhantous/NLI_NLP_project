  did n't see a thing . 
  oof that was close . 
  mark milligan is playing well . 
  have to admit these chants are making me feel a bit suicidey, 
  also drenthe and belfodil ... 
  me neither . 
  he 's either injured or they must have a foreigner restriction . 
  that has to be a penalty, 
  fun fact : when i played a save with ferencv\u00e1ros on fm 2008 ( i think ) i always organized a pre-season cup called l\u00e1szl\u00f3 kubala kupa . 
  i do n't even think the man was a proper legend for ferencv\u00e1ros but i did it every season . 
  could 've picked fl\u00f3ri\u00e1n albert or p\u00e9ter lipcsei but i chose kubala for some reason . 
  barcelona never accepted my invitations . 
   in may 1949 he also agreed to play for torino in a testimonial against s.l. 
  benfica but pulled out after his son became ill . on the way back from lisbon the plane carrying the torino team crashed into the superga hills , killing all 31 people on board . 
  god damn .

  i think he has like 14 assists . 
  league leader in assists . 
  i do n't know if we 're gon na make an offer for him . 
  i like him but it 's hard to tell what is going on in pinto da costa 's mind nowadays ... 
  with verdasca and chidozie on the b team i do n't think this yank lad will have much playing time . 
  still , if he 's talented who knows what the future holds ? 
  was the guy taking this pic hiding behind a tree ?

  how about football tactics ? 
  cool , im gon na give it a try anyway because i like weird shit and apparently this is a very weird show . 
  i will definitely dive in because i wan na know what happens now . 
  and i have the pilot with 1 hour and 34 minutes .

   you might be surprised by whom we have met before, 
  woah you met tajikistan * and * kurdistan * once and in the * same day * ? 
  that 's just bonkers man , everyone knows that . 
  i 'm just joking of course , i think that would be very nice . 
  ( meeting people from iran , tajikistan and kurdistan * that is ), 
  i never saw that as a bicycle wheel . 
  just a weird round shape thingy, 
  i just finished episode 3 ( or should i say episode 2 ? ) . 
  i did n't understand shit in the end but i loved it . 
  hardly know him , but he seems like a nice guy . 
  good for europeans as well !, 
  why did you choose olympiacos ? 
  if our defense is angel - indi - layun - varela we might be raped . 
  this will be harder than last year 's away game against bayern with this defense ... 
  edit : looks like i was right ... 
  me too friend . 
  me too ... 
  i do n't how this defense will hold kagawa , mkhitaryan , reus and aubameyang !, 
  i still do n't really know if he 's playing in midfield and herrera or ruben in defense but this scenario ( layun as cb ) looks the most likely . 
  tuchel must be pretty confused lol, 
  yes, 
  thomas tuchel must be confused as hell with our starting xi, 
  my guess is that peseiro knew that it would be very hard to win so he tried his best to confuse the fuck out of bvb 's manager . 
  he was a right back when he was young . 
  he also was a winger a long long time ago ...
