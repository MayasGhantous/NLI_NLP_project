  i was talking about last year 's match not westfalenstadion obviously, 
  i can also hear the porto supporters often !, 
  great atmosphere !, 
  we 're still terrible though ... 
  most of the regulars are playing like shit too but yeah fair point, 
  i think the germans provide the broadcast for the entire world . 
  anyway i 'm watching on bein and i heard the porto fans louder than bvb fans several times . 
  holy fuck that was dirty !, 
  this yellow is an absolute joke !, 
  obviously a red look at that nasty tackle . 
  credit to / u/fragilelittlebunny !, 
  it was just a yellow . 
  what an absolute joke .

  / u/optikalcrow congratulations !, 
  i am sincerely happy for you . 
  i know you probably worked very hard and got this excellent result . 
  get yourself a gift ( anything , no matter how big or small , cheap or expensive ) , you deserve it . 
  there is no greater reward than seeing your hard work pay off . 
  this is a low energy video . 
  or that moment when you are siting down but somebody pulled your chair but you know you are too late and will fall down . 
  or that moment when you miss a step and you may fall down . 
  but it 's like that all the time . 
  i think his flanders impression sounded pretty good . 
  ... and bob, 
  it still is one of my favourite series on tv but c'mon . 
  what about that 4 day old account with 2 posts ? 
  i enjoyed reading the thread and i love watching the show , but yeah i get your point . 
  the thread was also linked in their facebook page . 
  there 's a match thread here if you wan na participate :, 
  game over tbh, 
  game over tbqh fam, 
  who will take care of the draw balls now ? 
  and more importantly where do i obtain the music played during the vote counting ? 
  there you go lad, 
  where do i get a flair with the portuguese flag though ? 
  it 's ok , they have a lot of work to do just moderating the sub . 
  this is a high energy sub after all :d, 
  never give up !, 
  i have a question : if bernie is so anti-establishment , anti wall street and anti 1 % why will he support hillary in the general election ? 
  but is that reason enough to go against basically everything he preached in his campaign by supporting her ? 
  source : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p9_bzwsy2e, 
  how are you feeling about the amount of support in florida ? 
  recomendo algumas que ando a ver e algumas que acabei recentemente : twin peaks , x-files , it 's always sunny in philadelphia , workaholics , shameless , deutschland 83 , curb your enthusiasm, 
  you have n't seen anything yet :, 
  just notice how in most of these videos the `` bad people '' are white and the `` strong '' people who speak their minds are mostly minorities . 
  watch any of these videos and i guarantee you 'll cringe .
