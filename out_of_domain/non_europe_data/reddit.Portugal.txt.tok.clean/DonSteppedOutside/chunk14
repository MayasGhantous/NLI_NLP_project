  [ man , prepare to be surprised ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnh0bmyt7os ), 
  i want to know more about french music , so i have a couple requests for you :, 
  can you recommend me some traditional music from france ? 
  and by traditional music i mean music transmitted orally between generations , or old music with unknown composers . 
  this means no commercial music and no classical music . 
  i want music that has been transmitted and evolved by a process of oral transmission or performed by custom over a long period of time . 
  i understand that it varies a lot from region to region , so the more you recommend , the more grateful i will be !, 
  another request i have is military marches . 
  can you recommend me some of your best military marches ( compilations are welcome ! ) ? 
  merci !, 
  ainda s\u00f3 vi o the seventh seal , wild strawberries , winter light , persona ( amei todos ) e planeio ver o through a glass darkly e o the silence . 
  same . 
  i actually just wanted to make lefties mad by supporting him but i read his positions on his website and ontheissues.org and i realized that a lot of his policies are pretty great . 
  i used your flag for my new nation on nationstates , the democratic republic of kachadan !, 
  thanks !, 
  i think the flag fits quite well , do n't you think ? 
  yes , they all look weird in the beginning because there 's lots of issues to settle and they take hours to appear . 
  are you kidding me, 
  delete this, 
  contras no meu caso :, 
  ymmv . 
  by the way you have all the people involved here . 
  no need to work . 
  here 's all the people involved :,

  [ \u00c9 melhor com a coreografia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b76ypfbo7bw ), 
  `` portugal 's salazar , dean of dictators : the first woman , fruit-laden trees , serpentine policy -- but no eden . '', 
  podias ter ido ao google confirmar , 
  mais depressa acreditava no george soros do que no putin . 
   e ultimamente , matar um animal \u00e9 definitivamente mais errado do que correcto, 
  absolutamente zero . 
  informados ; '', 
   czech republic will remain czech republic , they just `` legalise '' the term czechia as equal to cz , that 's it . 
  so officially , you 'll be able to use both .

  that sucks . 
  it does n't really matter that much because i 'm in 1431 but it still annoys me because my antipope had land in seville lol . 
  [ some images . 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/a/as2ji ) it looks like the last emperor died in the dungeons of the first pope emperor . 
  i play eu4 all the time so i 'm used to paradox games . 
  i already started a new game as count of \u00d6sterreich , 
  next steps are conquering krain and istria for aesthetic reasons and feeding every ottoman province to my new friends serbia and byzantium . 
  edit : just turned into italy and became a monarchy again !, 
  i thought this decision would lower my trade value but it actually went up because of their amazing ideas . 
  i 'm planning on taking istria for myself , give ragusa to serbia and cyprus to byzantium . 
  tunis have actually helped me when i was weaker and had only france and them against a pretty big coaliton . 
  i 'm gon na backstab them in the war against the ottomans and retake malta . 
  i 'll take a screenshot later to put your mind more at ease , 
  # ** all **, 
  # ** five **, 
  # ** states **, 
  # ** ave maria !, 
  i took like 26 loans and had the support of savoy right at the start . 
  the independence only cost 22 ws i think . 
  after that i did my best to ally france , join the hre/ally austria and of course i had savoy as an ally still . 
  my strategy was to constantly check other italians for weak alliances and nasty wars they get caught up in . 
  no , but i seriously thought about converting to reformed . 
  now i want to be orthodox because that would be pretty cool , but i have no idea how to do that :d, 
  but would n't they need to cross borders to siege everything ? 
  i 'm afraid my allies or other nations would attack them . 
  can i just accept demands as soon as they pop up ? 
  i 'm not gon na have a problem converting the provinces to orthodox . 
  but it sucks because i just want one province in the balkans to convert and later sell it to my friends serbia and byzantium . 
  i 'll try some stuff tonight and see how it goes . 
  they have no allies so kazan and tver ate them up . 
  right now they 're in a war with perm ( that does n't have any allies as well ) and they 're fully occupied . 
  i do n't know how they managed to be so weak . 
  it would be pretty cool if rebels had boats . 
  i wondered the same thing after getting my assignment handed to me last night by the umayyads playing as asturias . 
  yes . 
  i think so, 
  i still need krain for aesthetics haha, 
  ... which are ? 
   why is serbia so large ? 
  i helped them . 
   why is byzantium alive and large ? 
  same as serbia . 
  i guaranteed them both as well . 
   why is aragon alive ? 
  they became the dominant force in iberia . 
   how did the ottomans fail so hard ? 
  kebab must be removed . 
   why is moldova alive ? 
  happens pretty often tbh . 
  it 's to lure the ai there when mothballed . 
  formed as urbino . 
  i like to overdo things , 
  yeah basically . 
  i just nibbled here and there and all of a sudden ... italy !, 
  it 's only hard at first . 
  no interest . 
  live and let live man . 
  unless i wan na annex you . 
  in my game , the pope became holy roman emperor and the hre became a theocracy .
