  that got old fast . 
  background : i just converted to nahuatl and because i 'm in the western tech group , i ca n't reform my religion and that means the doom mechanic is still activated but i ca n't see it at all . 
  the doom mechanic goes off every year or so now but since i do n't like having vassals , i do n't really care . 
  i guess that guy 's age is part of the bug ? 
  anyway , nahuatl is pretty sweet . 
  \u2212 2 unrest , +10 % morale , +2 % missionary strength . 
  that plays well with my pacific northwest ideas which give +5 % discipline and +10 % morale . 
  i guess i 'm gon na try to make space marines with haida . 
  edit : the other guy just died .

  srs : does anyone have streams to the party ? 
  btw , i was here :d, 
  mate go party seriously , whatever it is you have to do can wait . 
  i wonder what nate `` increasingly worried man '' silver will write about this one . 
  is that sean penn on the right ? 
  it 's like the raiding vikings from ck2 all over again, 
  mate i 'm still in 1.12 and i dread going forward because i keep seeing stuff like corruption , sailors , estates , favours and all that new stuff and i feel like i have to learn a new game all over again . 
  i actually think it 's perfect . 
  it has to be something really simple and catchy . 
  you know , lyin ' ted , little marco , crooked hillary . 
  many people would be like `` what the fuck is a bolshevik ? '', 
  if he named him that . 
  keep me posted, 
  ~ ~ everything ~ ~ most things about isis are muslim . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  even if they 're scum , they 're still muslim though . 
  yes , not everything about them is muslim but most things about them are do n't you agree ? 
  by being followers of the religion . 
  i agree with everything you said mate . 
  no , not a good one anyway . 
  i did n't call them good muslims though . 
  which one of the five pillars of islam is that ? 
  precisely . 
  if you call yourself a vegan and eat meat you must be a pretty terrible vegan i 'd say ... 
  hence the ` terrible ' .

  continuamos a bitch do mendes ? 
  thanks , we will definitely need it !, 
  no entanto estou convencido que encontrei o perfil de facebook do rapaz utilizando as keywords `` international brigade of rojava mario nunes '' . 
  the only positive thing is that mendes can help us get better players and help us get rid of the crap players but that 's about it . 
  recomendo . 
  please pray for me , my friends , because exam season is coming and i am so desperate and anxious that i sit down for hours on end without being able to even start working .

  thank you very much .

  right on . 
  i 'll be rooting for you . 
  many people do n't like cm , they 're like the daily mail or the sun except they got a tv channel . 
  now they are a tabloid with a tv channel . 
  i think i would be pretty pissed if someone from a tabloid that lies all day interrupted me on my morning walk the day of an important match with their stupid questions . 
  he 's refused talking to them before a couple of years back : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg8rn9tmgp8, 
  he won a court case against them in 2014 because they released a story saying that he used one woman 's eggs and another woman 's uterus to have a baby . 
  he took the journalists to court for invasion of privacy and they claimed this story was relevant to public interest .
