  yes . 
  messi is better than any genius in their chosen field . 
  nothing is done with a great focus from such a young age by so many people in the history of humanity as is football by kids all around the world . 
  even in america and australia where football is not the biggest sport financially it is the most widely played but the best of the best in almost every other country are trying to become footballers . 
  messi is by a long distance , the best . 
  how many doctors focus on medicine from age 3 ? 
  how many mathematicians study relentlessly from age 3 ? 
  the numbers would not compare to football . 
  forget the number playing at all but focus on the number actively playing with an aim to enter the sport professionally in every country in the world - nothing in human history is as competitive as football . 
  basketball has only one tier one league , the rest are a far distance below . 
  even rugby which tries to be the next most biggest after football , there are only 120 professional rugby union players from australia . 
  australia being one of the powerhouses in rugby historically . 
  one of 8 with an automatic spot at the world cups ( how competitive , how sad ) . 
  no sport compares to the scale and competitiveness of football . 
  messi makes a mockery of the best of the best champions league players . 
  the best players in europe and from around the world . 
  think of how many divisions they are from the average guy playing for a sunday league team in any town , any country . 
  think of what he did to one of the best defenders , jerome boateng , or fabio cannavaro before him . 
  think of what he does so often to the most expensively assembled footballing teams ( bayern or real madrid ) . 
  messi is the only proof the superhuman we have . 
  he might not be a god but he is the closest we have had to one .
