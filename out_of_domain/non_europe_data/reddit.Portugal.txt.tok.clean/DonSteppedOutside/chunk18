  his game is so strong he already knew he was gon na score and he wrote a book about it, 
  i really hope we do n't sell lay\u00fan because i really love him . 
  one of my favourite players . 
  that being said , i like telles a lot and i hope having the two on the team works out . 
  he can play right back , defensive mid and left mid as well but his best position is left back .

  well the balance is restored . 
  an eyewitness on portuguese channel tvi24 claimed she saw way more than 30 bodies . 
  i hope this is not true and she said this because of the shock . 
  another person contacted by this channel said she was locked inside her own restaurant with 9 other people because of the situation in the hotel nearby and everything near the hotel is closed by the police .

  i just finished `` demons '' by dostoyevsky and it touches all those subjects . 
  there 's plenty of philosophy , politics and religion . 
  there 's also plenty of intellectualism and anti-intellectuslism because the story revolves around the nihilist movement in 19th century russia . 
  it 's a novel though so i 'm not sure if that 's what you 're looking for .

   there is a common misconception that the tar in cigarettes is equivalent to the tar used on roads . 
  as a result of this , cigarette companies in the united states , when prompted to give tar/nicotine ratings for cigarettes , usually use `` tar , '' in quotation marks , to indicate that it is not the road surface component . 
  tar is occasionally referred to as an acronym for total aerosol residue , a backronym coined in the mid-1960s,
