  not that guy but for me it 's :, 
  amnesiac  kid a = the king of limbs  ok computer  in rainbows  hail to the thief = a moon shaped pool  the bends  pablo honey, 
  i rated my list amnesiac ( 10 )  kid a ( 9 ) = tkol ( 9 )  ok computer ( 8 )  in rainbows ( 7 )  httt ( 6 ) = amsp ( 6 )  the bends ( 5.5 )  pablo honey ( 5 ), 
  i just love how anxious , melancholic and lonely amnesiac can be . 
  there 's nothing like it in radiohead 's catalogue . 
  * i might be wrong * , but kid a ca n't reach amnesiac 's ability to make me feel . 
  that 's why i put it above everything else . 
  it had a bigger impact on me than any other radiohead album but yeah kid a is a masterpiece . 
  for me amnesiac is like being in the middle of something very horrible while it 's happening to you and kid a is like watching that event unfold either in the past or the future . 
  you can hear this in morning bell . 
  the version in amnesiac sounds very nightmarish and desperate while the version in kid a sounds very anxious and melancholic . 
  ca n't believe no one mentioned this film . 
  ** sufjan stevens - illinois **, 
  ** sufjan stevens - michigan **, 
  ( sufjan stevens is more of a christian artist that sometimes makes christian inspired art but i like all his music . ), 
  ** bob dylan - slow train coming **, 
  ( check out the whole album , not just this song ), 
  ** pedro de escobar - requiem **, 
  ( this is great polyphonic stuff , i recommend getting the whole album by ensemble gilles binchois ), 
  ** spiritualized - ladies and gentlemen we are floating in space **, 
  ( lots of christian themes . 
  check out spiritualized 's other albums ), 
  wow . 
  what a coincidence . 
  i literally just finished reading that story and i was searching more about it . 
  what i got from that story is that by remaining faithful in god 's plan , we will be rewarded in due time . 
  this story is the perfect example of the old adage `` god works in mysterious ways '' . 
  joseph had to be sold into slavery and be falsely accused of rape to save everyone from famine and he was so faithful in god 's plan for him ( which came to him in a dream ) that everything worked out for him and his family . 
  i 'm still unsure about my comment though because , just like i said , i just finished reading the story and i have to analyze it better . 
  listen to this if you enjoy good polyphony :, 
  i wish this old composer from my country ( pedro de escobar from portugal ) was more well known . 
  i only read the first paragraph but i 'm gon na say cult . 
  edit : after reading everything it still sounds like a cult . 
  oh my god that 's the whole thing,

   looks like hillary 's operatives have gotten www.grrrgraphics.com shut down again , we are working on getting the site back up . 
  this is the third time the site has been shut down after a hillary cartoon has gone viral . 
  i will keep you posted . 
   this , so much . 
  but i have to be emotionally prepared , it moves me so much . 
  i wish i read that before i watched the movie yesterday . 
  in the imdb page the film was tagged as a comedy and i thought it was going to be a fun film to watch . 
  i was not ready for the way it made me feel about life in general . 
  what a great film . 
  wow , i will definitely watch the porto - leicester match !, 
  blue man group, 
  still recovering i think . 
  i 'd like it if ricardo carvalho played one more season for porto and joined the staff at the end of the season . 
  i think he can play another quality season . 
  stopped by to say that you were quoted in a portuguese newspaper article . 
  mate you were quoted in a portuguese newspaper article . 
  i agree . 
  do n't you mean diogo j ? 
  great player . 
  i 'm glad to have him in the team but i do n't like this type of business . 
  it 's on loan with an option to buy . 
  [ here are the details in portuguese . 
  ] ( http://web3.cmvm.pt/sdi/emitentes/docs/fr61405.pdf ), 
   did n't he just signed for atletico ? 
  yeah , but they loaned him out to porto . 
  i did n't know we had an option to buy !, 
  i do n't like this type of business at all but i 'm glad to have him in the team . 
  ricardo carvalho for like 1 year + another cb would be awesome . 
  ( for me at least ), 
   atletico bought 60 % of diogo jota for 65000 euros and mendes bought the other 40 % for 35000 euros . 
  atl\u00e9tico paid around 7 million euros for diogo jota .

  i know that christians do n't follow most of leviticus but if we want to get more specific there 's always [ leviticus 19:31 ] and [ leviticus 20:6 ] which talk about something similar to psychics and tarot card readers . 
  i know you 're shitposting but whatever . 
   many of the rituals , like waving around incense , come from the romans . 
  they do n't come from the romans . 
  these rituals are on the old testament , before the romans . 
   feel more like dungeons and dragons or game of thrones than something jesus would have wanted, 
  can you back that statement ? 
  by the way , in most catholic churches i 've been to there was no extravagant architecture , no latin mass and the incense waving was rare . 
   speaking in strange languages and murmuring, 
  latin was the lingua franca for millennia , why should n't it be used for mass ? 
  that 's like saying that mass in english is like the simpsons just because they speak english . 
  makes no sense at all . 
   waving incense, 
  the old hebrews also waved incense . 
  personally i do n't think there 's anything wrong with it . 
  does it also feel like dungeons and dragons just because they wave incense ? 
  must be a pretty weird game . 
   the people eating the funny crackers,
