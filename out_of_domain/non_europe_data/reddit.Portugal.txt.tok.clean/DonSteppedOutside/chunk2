  very nice man . 
  omg , `` mcii '' is * so * good . . 
  13th floor elevators 's first album is absolutely fantastic . 
  i liked `` there is love in you '' and `` pink '' by four tet a lot but i still prefer `` pink '' . 
  i really hope jai releases his album soon , or else ... 
  yes there is , but no one has ever heard of them . 
  i saw chvrches live last summer :p, 
  wavves are a great summertime band . 
  based on the comments i saw , it 's more of a combination between metalcore , thrash metal , pop punk and emo . 
  # #tybg, 
  dude i do n't think the jesus and mary chain are more popular than mbv . 
  dude , check `` burn your fire for no witness '' if you like indie folk . 
  how do you feel about `` the lonesome crowded west '' ? 
  `` r plus 7 '' is beautiful . 
  dude . 
  sensible soccers . 
  fuck yes . 
  yeah i just assumed that album was well known . 
  i 'm praying for that ( not srs ), 
  i do know about salem but i did not like king night . 
  but i 'm not really a fan of witch house sorry :p, 
  i think alt-j 's last album was fucking terrible , but hey , that 's just my opinion . 
  it was pretty good . 
  i found the lecturer 's channel on youtube where you can see all the comments he makes on his videos : https://www.youtube.com/user/hgross3comcast/, 
  you should n't feel shitty . 
  you should feel lucky and thankful that someone offered a second opportunity . 
  those do n't appear very often . 
  this is in livraria lello ( lello bookstore ) , one of the oldest bookstores in portugal . 
  people say those stairs inspired j.k. rowling to write . 
  you can see a lot of portuguese culture in harry potter because j.k.r. 
  lived in porto while writing the series . 
  it has been said that she got the philosopher 's stone idea from a portuguese song named `` pedra filosofal '' ( philosopher 's stone ) . 
  j.k.r also admitted that salazar slytherin 's first name came from ant\u00f3nio de oliveira salazar , an evil dictator that ruled portugal for quite some time . 
  another obvious one is the inspiration for hogwarts student outfits . 
  this came from the students in porto 's university that wear them on a daily basis ( not all of them ) .

  was saddam hung though ? 
  i tried to make a bad pun . 
  forgive me . 
  duh , he clearly has a gun pointed at his head . 
  that 's why his paws are raised . 
  it 's a meme you dip, 
  this ref likes to take his time , i see . 
  took 2 minutes to call the offside and took 40 minutes to call the penalty . 
  reminds me of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs5zkpxkto0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=28s ), 
  that 's exactly what i always thought about deep breathing even before seeing this image !, 
  i was doing a breath holding contest with a friend and i noticed that i felt invincible aftwerwards . 
  it really felt like i exhaled my worries , it 's kinda hard to explain . 
  i used to do this thing whenever i had this weird feeling in my stomach ( anxiety perhaps ? ), 
  that 's basically inhale as much air as i possibly could and hold it as long as i could ( my vision always turned completely white and i knew i should stop there ) and then exhale . 
  it completely cured my fears for 10 minutes and i felt really light afterwards but it only worked if i was standing and not touching anything besides the ground with my feet . 
  well , one day i was particularly nervous and i did this about 5 times on the shower , passed out , slipped and hit my head . 
  when i opened my eyes i was lying there with blood all over me . 
  i ended up in the hospital :( . 
  now i do n't do this as often , only when i 'm really really really nervous and i can control myself better nowadays . 
  i think that one time i even experienced something weird , it felt like a lot of time passed when i was whited out ( like 2 hours ) but only a couple of seconds passed and i had this weird feeling on my face and weird taste on the sides of my tongue . 
  this was kinda off topic but i felt the need to post it :p . sorry for my bad english . 
  1st goal is by brahimi, 
  2nd goal is by herrera, 
  3rd goal is by casemiro, 
  4th goal is by aboubakar, 
  including 2 free kicks !, 
  oh jeez i actually tried kvl too but i never thought about mixing the two equations . 
  thanks a lot mate . 
  i have n't really learned that yet but i 'll definitely try to remember this . 
  thanks . 
  according to his imdb page he directed two short films last year at the age of 106 !!!, 
  he received 47 awards and 31 nominations in total . 
  his career spanned from the silent era to our days . 
  he was grand cross of the order of prince henry and grand cross of the order of saint james of the sword . 
  what a beautiful life this wonderful guy lived . 
  truly one of the greats . 
  rest in peace , manoel . 
  that 's awesome :d, 
  well you could try [ a divina com\u00e9dia ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101739/ ) ( 1991 ) , maria de medeiros ( butch 's girlfriend from pulp fiction ) stars in it or you could also try [ aniki b\u00f3b\u00f3 ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034461/ ) ( 1942 ) one of his most famous films . 
  if you like john malkovich or catherine deneuve you should try [ um filme falado ( a talking picture ) ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364093/ ) ( 2003 ) . 
  just a heads up though , the actors seem very theatrical at times but that 's just his style . 
  [ different angles ] ( http://gfycat.com/shamelesspiercingindigobunting ), 
  yes, 
  11 hours ago you `` pledged your single button press to this fantastic cause [ knights of the button ] . '', 
  15 minutes ago you posted `` we 're blue da ba dee dabba die dabba dee dabba die , dabba dee dabba die . '', 
  14 minutes ago you posted a new thread named `` league of blues '' with these words : `` come , blues one and all !, 
  we must unite to convert the greys to our cause !, 
  we must turn them all blue ! '', 
  do you really want another chance ? 
  do you think you deserve another chance when you switch sides so easily ? 
  i suggest you think about the error of your ways and only when you are truly sorry then you can come here and beg for forgiveness . 
  that 's just what a 59er would say . 
  this was the first time i ever saw a swedish league match and i loved it . 
  the atmosphere was great , the teams were great , the goals were great . 
  it was really fun , even though i do n't understand any swedish :( . 
  this is nothing like in portugal where the weaker clubs struggle to have 1000 people in the stadium ( in the first division ! ) . 
  i 'm still deciding which teams i 'm supporting and hammerby is probably going to be one of them , 
  also , why is everyone standing all the time ? 
  do you not have seats ? 
  that feel when, 
  rayo fans , what can you tell us about this player ? 
  is he a good choice to replace jackson mart\u00ednez ? 
  do you think he will leave ?
