  you are so worried about what jesus would have wanted and yet you compare the host to funny crackers . 
  man , you 're a terrible provocateur . 
  you 're not offending me , i 'm having a lot of fun shitposting around . 
  exodus has half chapter devoted to the altar of incense but for you it does n't count because `` the other jewish books do n't really come from god . '', 
  and you also disregard the gospels because `` the gospels were chosen by roman aristocrats '' even though the church you compare to the catholics specifically says `` this congregation accepts the bible as its absolute authority in matters of faith and practice . '' . 
  you call the hostia `` funny crackers '' yet that church 's website specifically says `` we believe in [ ... ] the celebration of the lord 's supper by all obedient believers . '', 
  you speak about the `` wausau bible church '' and compare it to the catholic mass , but i do n't think you know what that church is all about either . 
  not exactly answering your question but i watched calvary and the end of moby dick was spoiled at the end of the movie . 
  i was pretty bummed out because i want to read it :(, 
  \u00e1 is wrong, 
  it 's \u00e0, 
  oh is it not used in english ? 
  that 's what 's commonly used in my country . 
  i do n't think i understand what you 're trying to say , sorry . 
  ok thanks !, 
  when i think about the word `` host '' , i think about a talk show host or a host body for parasites . 
  thanks for the correction .

  hat trick do diogo jota . 
  last hattrick i remember was tello vs sporting . 
  ~ ~ i 've heard he was opus dei . ~ ~, 
  actually , opus dei tried to recruit him but he refused after taking part in a retreat and lecture . 
  a good percentage of older people do all that . 
  before the revolution , salazar was in charge and pretty much everyone in the country was a fervent catholic because he defended and promoted the church a lot ( his motto was even `` deus , p\u00e1tria e fam\u00edlia '' or `` god , fatherland and family '' . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.casacomum.org/aebdocs/06/06278/06278.00001/d2/06278.00001_p0001_id001554265_d2.jpg ) one picture depicting his motto ) and the apparitions in [ f\u00e1tima in 1917 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/our_lady_of_f%c3%a1tima ) only helped the catholic church . 
  his economic system was even based in the encyclicals rerum novarum ( leo xiii , 1891 ) and quadragesimo anno ( pius xi , 1931 ) .

  since the revolution in 1974 the number of practicing catholics has been declining fast . 
  lots of young people are only baptised or just attend mass weekly with their parents for a few years . 
  this is in big cities . 
  in small villages there are lots of young practicing catholics and not much has changed in 40 years except for the declining population of the interior and the decreased illiteracy . 
  # ** here 's an entire debate prep for you **, 
  date : 2015-12-18 23:13, 
  ( one day before [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democratic_party_presidential_debates_and_forums,_2016#december_19.2c_2015_.e2.80.93_goffstown.2c_new_hampshire ) debate ), 
  it has one attachment : https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails//fileid/9089/2691, 
  here 's the contents of the attachment : https://i.sli.mg/w6voff.png, 
   ** the only potential president who can keep us safe and grow our economy **, 
   ** fighting for : ** women , children , families , middle-class , people knocked down, 
   ** fighting against : ** drug cos , reckless ceos , insurance cos , big oil , stacked deck , gop pres candidates, 
   ** fighting gop over : ** immigration , planned parenthood , aca , de-reg wall street , wages too high, 
   ** fighting to achieve : ** security , rising incomes , debt-free tuition , child care , clean energy, 
   ** our six goals for the foreign policy debate **, 
  first question : ** ( almost ) no matter what , deliver the drafted first answer, 
  hit sanders on his flawed approach to isis/syria : ** sanders says he will use coalitions ... but talk is easy ... i have built coalitions ; his approach will make it harder to get a coalition : ( 1 ) iranian troops on the ground + ( 2 ) uncertainty on arming/training opposition or use of us special forces . 
  you ca n't command if you ca n't be clear . 
  regime change rejoinder : ** sen. sanders criticizes regime change , but he voted for it in libya, 
  defend your record -- two ways to do it -- then pivot back to plan : ** ( 1 ) how you were right about us response to changes in the region ; or ( 2 ) what you did to make the us safer -- then pivot to plan, 
  hit the republicans hard for being wrong : ** their plans are bluster and bigotry ; alienating allies and partners ; logical consequence of what they are saying is a return to having thousands of combat troops on the ground . 
  guns : ** sanders against brady bill 5 times ; charleston loophole ; said he 'd reconsider immunity -- where is it ? 
   and on climate change , bernie ca n't take yes for an answer, 
   ** our six goals for the domestic policy debate **, 
  make the `` no middle class taxes '' exchange about the middle class , not about you : ** when sanders says your `` no taxes '' pledge makes you timid , respond with a rousing statement about what the middle class is going through : you get it -- middle class families need a pay raise , not a tax hike, 
  hit sanders on health care : ** not what i ever thought i 'd see in a democratic debate : we are not going to repeal obamacare , put it all at risk , and hand it over to the states ... 
  strong exchange on wall street : ** why are two hedge fund billionaires attacking me ? 
  my opponents are attacking me because to distract you -- my plan is better . 
  only 3 % of my $ $ from investment industry . 
  only one person on stage voted to deregulate . 
  the gender card : ** deal me in ; gop wants to defund planned parenthood ; the republicans want to take us back to the 1950s . 
  your progressive credentials : ** i 've taken on the drug / insurance cos ; stood up in beijing ; stared down oppressive leaders : do n't lecture me from the comfort of a blue state . 
  guns : ** sanders against brady bill 5 times ; charleston loophole ; said he 'd reconsider immunity -- where is it ? 
   ** do n't forget **, 
   demeanor is the debate : happy to be there !, 
  smiling !, 
  you look great !, 
   bernie/martin are here to talk about me -- i am here to talk about you, 
   attacks on republicans always  attacks on fellow dems, 
   nh specific references and context ( such as exim - $ 400m in exports ! ), 
   blur distinctions on `` their '' issues : wall street , social security , min wage , immigration -- what divides us, 
   democrats is minor compared to what the gop would do, 
   they want to talk about the past ; you want to talk about the future, 
  still , these are pretty hilarious, 
   the gender card : deal me in ; gop wants to defund planned parenthood ; the republicans want to take us back to the 1950s . 
   and on climate change , bernie ca n't take yes for an answer, 
   demeanor is the debate : happy to be there !, 
  smiling !, 
  you look great !, 
  if i was from new hampshire i would n't be pleased knowing that her staff had to tell her to look happy when debating in my state . 
  ** wow do n't forget to check out those attachments where the three speeches are : **, 
  in [ this ] ( https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails//fileid/11011/2873 ) speech hillary says :, 
  `` well , i think their traditional policy has been close to what you 've described . 
  ** we do n't want a unified korean peninsula ** , because if there were one south korea would be dominant for the obvious economic and political reasons . 
  we do n't want the north koreans to cause more trouble than the system can absorb . 
  ** so we 've got a pretty good thing going with the previous north korean leaders . 
  ** make sure the korean voters know that hillary does n't want a unified korea **,
