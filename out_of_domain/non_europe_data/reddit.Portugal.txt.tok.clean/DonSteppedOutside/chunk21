  the vote backlog is huge apparently : http://www.redditstatus.com/, 
  yeah we temporarily crashed their voting system lol, 
  it 's in 2 hours though . 
  no , the rally starts at 1:00 pm colorado springs time , like 2 hours from now . 
  yeah , the vote backlog is going down : http://www.redditstatus.com/, 
  we temporarily crashed their voting system lol, 
  they were posing as investors . 
  from his ama :, 
   in this case , one of our alias was the creation of overseas offshore account . 
  we created an actual overseas company . 
  by representing a dark money source overseas we gained access and credibility in places previously unimaginable . 
  at one point we were invited to the white house . 
  [ here 's the ama .

  who else upvoted all the submissions of the video ? 
  we have to keep the pressure, 
  they had a statement ready from bob creamer and bob creamer just resigned . 
  this is epic !, 
  this is going to be the msm strategy to discredit the videos :, 
  but we get to see it first on reddit . 
  ** go vote guys !,

  i , too , have a cat . 
  cnn is always playing in waiting rooms . 
  that 's where they get their viewers . 
  did they have to call hazmat team as well ? 
  this is her version of ted cruz 's butter cow tweet . 
  because all the mainstream polls are designed to influence voters by oversampling certain groups , the campaigns use internal polls to get accurate the most results . 
  translation : wikileaks has dirt on me and a bunch of my cronies and i 'm scared about it, 
  we got ta give them a lot of clicks , rts and shares on this article . 
  encourage them to release more stories like these . 
  do n't forget about jon voight !, 
  here 's video of the cnn focus group . 
  mika ca n't even contain her laughter when he says that @ 1:02, 
  i do n't know how to interpret the video . 
  i thought it was how each group is perceiving what the candidate is saying at the moment , is n't it ? 
  it would make sense that the trump supporters and undecided voters would give really low ratings to hillary during that russia bit and hillary supporters give her bigger ratings . 
  look at that weak shill in the first twitter response :, 
   @frankluntz @billspadea and his numbers remain waaaaay below hers, 
  he does n't know ( or maybe want ) to interpret the video correctly and he 's a pollster himself !, 
  america works only if you make it work !, 
  she 's been dropping red pills all over twitter !, 
   it is a statistical model that relies on presidential primaries and an election cycle as predictors of the vote in the general election . 
   presidential elections going back as far as 1912 are used to estimate the weight of primary performance . 
  it was in 1912 that presidential primaries were introduced . 
  that year the candidate who won his party 's primary vote , woodrow wilson , went on to defeat the candidate who lost his party 's primary vote , william howard taft . 
  as a rule , the candidate with the stronger primary performance wins against the candidate with the weaker primary performance . 
  for elections from 1912 to 2012 the primary model picks the winner , albeit retroactively , every time except in 1960 . 
  katy perry , miley cyrus , bon jovi , jennifer lopez and the national will do rallies for hillary . 
  yes , it 's a nice little bonus that comes with subscribing here . 
  it 's clear that the clinton foundation strikes a nerve every single time . 
  that 's where the worse dirt is . 
  down for me too, 
  i 'm in portugal and it 's down as well . 
  download [ tor ] ( https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en ) and open twitter there . 
  it works for me on tor . 
  also it works with tor, 
  i do n't think there 's any voter fraud . 
  it 's like how the american independent party nominated him in california so he appears as gop and ai . 
  thanks for correcting the record . 
  good omen , lots of calcium in your future !, 
  thanks for correcting the record . 
  [ it 's only a state-level party from new york though . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conservative_party_of_new_york_state ) who knows what the future holds though , maybe they 'll become the nationwide party for trump conservatives after the election . 
  it 's a speech , not a rally . 
  this will be a bit different from a rally . 
  if you 've got one of those red hats do n't take it off . 
  sleep in that thing . 
  rsbn has a big delay compared to fox news . 
  i 'm still giving rsbn the views .
