  i actually used that excuse on my parents about 6 years ago . 
  in reality i punched the laptop screen because i was so frustrated with a videogame i was playing at the time . 
  #podestaemails 23 was trending and they deleted it from trending, 
  the dangers of donald trump was trending with about 1000 tweets, 
   you may know my father , jim webb . 
  he was a democratic senator from virginia . 
  before that he was secretary of the navy under ronald reagan and , before that , an infantry marine in vietnam . 
  his son did . 
  he 's a democrat so he probably could n't endorse him directly . 
  no , that 's just www.redditmetrics.com not being accurate . 
  check out / r/the _ donald/about/traffic for the actual numbers,

  not true . 
  41k , 85k , 50k , 74k , etc. . . 
   who the fuck even has 650,000 emails ? 
  someone scared for his life . 
  its happening isnt it, 
  this guy is a meme machine . 
  thank kek he 's with us . 
  # ** elizabeth `` pocahontas '' warren wo n't be in that coalition !, 
  by the way , chelsea clinton seats at the board of directors of the daily beast . 
  about the article : it 's 26 years old . 
  lots of things change in 26 years . 
  i did n't expect the #stopthepot campaign to work so fast / s, 
  even if he does he 's not running for pope , is he ? 
   trump 's personal moral failings here can be overlooked considering his candidacy for president , and even that he would be much less-bad than clinton . 
  i agree . 
  it really is . 
  we should make the hashtag #changemyvote trend . 
  if it 's a smear job , our based plant lady will see right through that bullshit . 
  she has those crystal superpowers .

  today we will also reach a quarter of a million centipedes . 
  got ta celebrate that too !, 
   in combined results from friday night and saturday , voters split 45 percent for clinton and 46 percent for trump, 
  watch all of it . 
  it 's amazing . 
  there 's new twin peaks coming in 2017 too !,

  no wonder dukakis lost in a landslide with idiots like donna brazile around . 
  #breaking the conditioning, 
  me too , but she said it was her state so she knew better than anyone how shitty their situation is . 
  [ do n't mind me ... i 'm just a peaceful leak farmer tending to my leaks ... ] ( https://i.sli.mg/qopyps.jpg ), 
  fox & friends is pretty decent . 
  it 's probably danny williams . 
  they covered his first press conference and they 're gon na cover the new press conference today . 
  throwing her under the bus . 
  jim webb 's son already endorsed trump , by the way . 
  i do n't have the link right now but if you scroll through my history it 's there . 
  clinton ca n't give press conferences because collusion with super pacs is illegal . 
  if you glanced at / r/the _ donald you committed a thought crime . 
  if you participated in / r/the _ donald you acted on your wrongthink . 
  you are lucky the police was n't called to your home . 
  now move along citizen . 
  he 's from the future so evolution probably has something to do with it . 
  '' god does n't know what it 's like to be a persecuted christian like i am . '',

  auto alliance / esa / pulse opinion research, 
  it 's not very reputable . 
  this guy submitted a thread saying assange was killed 12 times in a row . 
  i do n't know how the daily mail is treating trump but they endorsed brexit !, 
  why does n't he read the snake anymore ?

  [ november 9th ] ( https://i.sli.mg/ts7uvr.jpg ), 
  the press conference was canceled . 
  i literally watched the story vanish as news from the press conference being canceled emerged . 
  apparently a reporter from jezebel ( of all places ! ), 
  debunked the story :, 
  / r / [ redacted ] just deleted their thread about this, 
  nah i saw it somewhere, 
  that 's what i said . 
  the story vanished because the press conference was canceled . 
  when i said vanish i meant from the website not / r/politics . 
  why the hell would / r/politics keep a story up if the story was deleted in the website ? 
  it was n't the media . 
  the story on / r/politics was from thebloomfirm.com , a lawyer firm . 
  their website does n't work , but here 's their facebook page : www.facebook.com/thebloomfirm/, 
  i 'm not so sure if it 's their fault . 
  it appears that both the website from the law firm and the story completely vanished . 
  but it 's pretty questionable that they would allow a story from a law firm to be posted there by a 5 hour old anti-trump account . 
  they had another story directly from the law firm website at 4000 points posted from a 5 hour old account . 
  the website and the story both vanished .
