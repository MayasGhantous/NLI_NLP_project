  andr\u00e9 ^ 2 in the bench , ruben neves not even in the bench and this guy is still playing . 
  does n't make any sense . 
  herrera looks like he was quoned before the match . 
  herrera needs to be subbed by andr\u00e9 ^ 2 or bueno . 
  show 'em what you 're made of !, 
  maxi did n't get subbed , it was herrera lol u crazy bot, 
  abombakar !, 
  can you please watch every porto match ? 
  maxi , aboubakar and varela were all great !, 
  ***** - aboubakar, 
  *** - casillas , alex sandro , marcano , imbula , danilo , andr\u00e9 andr\u00e9, 
  ** - maicon , tello , evandro ( not enough time ) , brahimi ( not enough time ), 
  i did n't give 4 stars to imbula because i think his performance dropped quite a lot in the 2nd half . 
  / r/portugueseliga / exists but it 's pretty much dead, 
  i 'd be up for a new one tho, 
  i never moderated a sub and do n't know shit about css but i know lots of dank memes and it ca n't be that difficult moderating a sub . 
  and i definitely will cooperate . 
  if you wan na watch some live footie , porto plays there ( funchal ) on saturday with maritimo and nacional plays with uni\u00e3o da madeira on sunday ( regional derby , also on funchal ) . 
  i do n't think so ... 
  i 'd be interested in / r/learnfinance if it was like / r/learnprogramming, 
  what do you think about something like this : / r/primeiraliga ? 
  what do you think about something like this : / r/primeiraliga ? 
  do you wan na be a mod ? 
  i need mods and people who know css . 
  disrespected ? 
  penalty for cska !, 
  why are sporting fans always whistling whenever cska touches the ball ? 
  but like i hear it when the teams are rivals but sporting and cska are n't rivals . 
  oh shit now i remember . 
  that makes sense , thanks . 
  that 's no bueno for sporting . 
  ah , i was n't aware of that . 
  thanks . 
  we will probably buy another lb and send jose angel to siberia . 
  i hope . 
  good draw for porto and chelsea . 
  bring it man !, 
  good luck for you guys !, 
  hopefully mourinho does n't get into casillas ' brain . 
  when i left to eat dinner the score was 0-0 and when i returned the score was 6-2 . 
  fucking shit i wish i did n't eat dinner . 
  more like 1 hour or 1h20 mins . 
  i was just eating and watching the news and kinda forgot about the match . 
  something without herrera, 
  fc porto is not forcing anyone to donate anything , we are assuming this initiative in the match against chelsea and ** inviting ** other people to do the same . 
  read it again mate . 
  i do n't care very much for greece 's football team . 
  ^ i 'm ^ ^ still ^ ^ ^ salty ^ ^ ^ ^ about ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ euro ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ 2004 ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ !, 
  obvious, 
  i wanted to get bigger but i dont know how you guys can do it . 
  i can never go to war because i always have rebels popping up . 
  i wanted the italian peninsula and restore the pentarchy by converting rome but they have tight alliances with scandinavia , castile , catalonia and bohemia and i would get destroyed by them and rebels because i only have poland , lithuania and scandinavia as allies and im sure scandinavia would backstab me in a heartbeat . 
  i have like 80 % unity or so and i have 3 guys converting everyone . 
  the problem is the separatism in the african provinces . 
  i do n't get why some have 10 % unrest just because of separatism . 
  i always make sure i have stab +3 and no war exhaustion . 
  actually things have changed now . 
  the papal state is allied with scandinavia , catalonia , the palatinate , castile and bavaria and bohemia is allied with lithuania and aachen . 
  if i attack bohemia , lithuania would n't join because they 're in a war together and that would mean no more alliance with lithuania but poland , scandinavia and iraq would join me . 
  if i attacked aachen i 'd fight bohemia , venice , cleves but that would mean no more bohemia and lithuania alliance . 
  edit : i just upped the local autonomy on every province with problems and that pretty much fixed the rebel problem . 
  i was gon na declare on aachen and lithuania pulls this shit on me :, 
  if i declare on aachen they would n't join me because they have this huge debt and that adds a -70 modifier , the manpower is a -44 modifier and the army strength in a -12 modifier but if i declre on bohemia they would join against me and the debt modifier is just -10 , the manpower is just -12 and the army strength is just -4 . 
  what 's up with that ? 
  if you want byzantine music , i have 6 hours of it . 
  yeah, 
  about point number 5 , why should you supress your negative thoughts ? 
  they are your best friend . 
  they tell you what needs to be fixed in your life . 
  if you try to supress them , they will undoubtedly pile up and burst . 
  my approach is to open my door to all the negative thoughts and work towards making them naturally disappear by fixing what needs to be fixed in my life . 
  unfortunately not . 
  how they got so huge , i do n't know, 
  started a new game yesterday :, 
  so close and yet so far ... year is 1582 though, 
  what about the siberian tribes ? 
  yes i know but do you have any tips ? 
  happens in my games fairly often . 
  smart move by brittany . 
  it 's like my 2nd game so i wanted to cheese it up a bit because i was a bit slow and a bit passive when i began . 
  hell i did n't even restore the borders of the roman empire because i was afraid of coalitions and shit . 
  i altered defines.lua myself and changed the end to 2500 . 
  they also have no manpower so i have basically a free pass to all of scandinavia . 
  i do n't even know how i got that far myself tbh . 
  i guess i got carried away . 
  if i only had more prestige i could claim the throne right now . 
  but i have 13 and they have 51 . 
  oh i thought that could make them lead a personal union with me . 
  mp as in multiplayer ? 
  no it 's not . 
  ah ok thanks . 
  i 'm afraid because i 'm not even a kingdom yet , i 'm just a duchy . 
  i see . 
  thanks . 
  right now i have double their prestige but they have a heir now . 
  sucks :( but i 'll wait . 
  because lorraine was divided into upper and lower before being lorraine . 
  oh yes , never noticed that . 
  it 's bothering me now . 
  i can claim the throne now .
