  what i did n't like was the president 's speech . 
  he was very harsh to the leftist parties and should be impartial . 
  but his actions were the correct ones and what is normally done is , you know , inviting the party that won the democratic elections to form government . 
  everything else is the ( leftist ) media blowing everything way out of proportion . 
  be your own reason . 
  do n't believe the hype . 
  exactly , the left is just salty about what the president said . 
  as a western european i can follow these threads just before bed !, 
  awesome !, 
  this happened in my hindustan game . 
  i was gujarat and bahmanis + jaunpur were my rivals . 
  i 'm playing bavaria and i got through the first years by having austria , france , denmark ( eventually dropped denmark for sweden as they gained independence ) and plc as allies . 
  now i 'm just waiting until france rivals austria and sweden rivals plc and i have no good allies left . 
  fucking pope leo x and his fucking indulgences !, 
  you 're doing better than me m8 ... 
  also i did n't annex ming because they had a bunch of cores so i vassalized them and gave them at least 20 provinces to retain mandate of heaven and fed them most of their cores . 
  that -5 revolt risk can take a lot of overextension . 
  [ who am i ? 
  what year am i ? 
  how am i doing ? 
  i 'm actually manchu in 1652 but thank you for reminding me how awful i am :(, 
  at least i 'm doing better than the real life manchu/qing were doing in 1652 i think . 
  started as jianzhou and have n't form qing yet and i have no colonies . 
  year is 1652 . 
  i 'm lazy . 
  yeah that 's mamluks in constantinople . 
  serbia got fucking huge somehow but guess what ? 
  90 % of those lands belonged to corfu at one point . 
  serbia is also winning a defensive war against the papal state +54 . 
  karaman also managed to obliterate the ottomans . 
  is n't there an advisor for that ? 
  but is n't that the same thing though ? 
  that appears to be true . 
  sorry for misleading you op . 
  i do n't think a bull stands a chance against infantry tbh ... 
  very well done albanians , skanderbeg would be most proud . 
  you 're very cool for doing this man !, 
  keep up the good work !, 
  for some reason they never formed greyskin for me . 
  they manage to pass 1 or 2 reforms and then the reformation hits and the hre goes to the shitter . 
  they still have a personal union over naples and mr. popeman as a vassal and they just rivaled me btw . 
  but it 's ok because i 'm allied with austria , poland , hungary , france and portugal . 
  i guess it 's time to fuck some shit up . 
  ally venice and poland . 
  dow on byzantium and take all their provinces + athens ( otto got their hands on constantinople first on my game ) . 
  no cb on urbino and get in the hre . 
  now you should be ready to go . 
  you have plenty of meat in the north of italy and the balkans . 
  when you get stronger than the ottomans you can take their provinces rather easily . 
  same goes for mamluks . 
  [ time to fuck some shit up lol ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mdiiiuk.jpg ), 
  because they have garbage ideas compared to the knights ' ( 5 % disc. , -2 unrest , +1 relationship and the other naval ideas make sense because i want to play the trade game heavily and dominate the mediterranean ) , all my european provinces would be overseas ( i 'm not sure about that one though ) and i like being a monastic order because the catholics have friendly attitude towards me . 
  i tried changing to jerusalem and all of a sudden my balances goes from like +49 ducats/month to -90 ducats/month and my allies attitudes change from friendly to defensive ( do n't what 's up with that , do catholic monastic orders have bonuses to relations with catholic countries ? 
  i did n't know urbino did n't start independent . 
  in my game they had no friends at all in about 1490 or 1500 ( probably got released because the pope was bashed pretty hard in my game ) . 
  anyway i had the alternative of no cb-ing ragusa if i did n't want to no cb urbino . 
  i always keep an eye on opms and attack them if they have no friends . 
  that 's how i got big really . 
  venice was bashed so they released crete , corfu and naxos and i just fabricated claims as soon as they were released and attacked , the same happened with lucca , corsica , cyprus ( was guaranteed by mamluks but thy were at war ) , genoa ( lost every province but genoa ) , etc. . . 
  eventually you get big ( especially if you have big friends ) and you can start picking on smaller nations like savoy , milan , tuscany , siena , serbia and bosnia . 
  this is almost a post-match thread lol :p, 
  how did you know i did n't fabricate claims on naples ? 
  ah yes , i just wanted to break their alliance with austria and since spain was allied with some south american tribe , i declared on them and boom alliance broken . 
  [ i 'm doing what i can ] ( http://i.imgur.com/irxcix3.jpg ), 
  how did you solve the pope situation ? 
  just refused to give him rome , and did you convert to other religion ? 
  but didnt he keep asking you for roma or was it just one time ? 
  yes the same happened to me . 
  totally worth it because the dip rep penalty can be easily balanced . 
  the -10 papal influence sucks tho . 
  i could never do that . 
  if you split a regiment in half how does that look ? 
  that 's why i would prefer having something like 18/6/14 or 16/6/12 . 
  i just finished my knights game and i wanted to stay catholic and a monastic order and when the reformation started i got like 3 events to change to protestant or i would lose 1 base production in all my provinces . 
  it was horrible . 
  the hanseatic league : as the hansa own all that land that appears in the game patrician 4 or at least those cities . 
  ( i dont know how to actually explain the achievement better and without resorting to patrician 4 but that 's the idea like own every coastal province in the baltic sea ), 
  i actually tried that long ago , sent 1 infantry in a cog to the middle of the pacific and i was sad when he just appeared among other generals . 
  like the guy is an imbecile but oh boy can he swim the pacific . 
  i ca n't find it in the wiki but it gives you the choice to convert or you lose 1 base production in all owned provinces and take a stab hit and catholicism gains reform desire or something like that .
