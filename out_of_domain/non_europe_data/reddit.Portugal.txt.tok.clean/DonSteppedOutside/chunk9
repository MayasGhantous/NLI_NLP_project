  this is good for me right ? 
  i 'm only focusing on colonization if africa and spice islands and i do n't have to bother with castile colonizing right ? 
  but austria never takes exploration or expansion ideas right ? 
  also , how would you rate my progress ? 
  am i making good progress for 1555 or am i being slow ? 
  yeah but the goal of the campaign is to control trade in the spice islands and africa because i 'm sick and tired of colonial nations and the americas in general . 
  [ and so it starts ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fdytcoa.jpg ), 
  i allied them as soon as they got the pu over castile . 
  where are the azores ? 
  i used to be the same way and the pomodoro technique never worked well for me because each problem takes me roughly 10-25 mins to complete so i just do it anyway , i figured out that in college my focus should be on learning how to learn and mostly learn how to work . 
  i thought to myself : how am i gon na make it through 8 hours of work every day if i ca n't focus for 20 mins at a time ? 
  so i decided to have some water by my side and have a sip from time to time , close my eyes for a bit and breathe , and things seem to be working fine . 
  i guarantee you : you 're just missing a good flow . 
  once you get a good flow going you will not want to stop . 
  also , are you working from home ? 
  i realized that i ca n't work much at home , especially in my room because i get all kinds of distracted . 
  my solution was to go to the study rooms my college offers ( you can go there 24/7 ) and bring just the necessary books , pencils , pens , notebooks ( and water do n't forget your water !!! ) . 
  no laptops , tablets or smartphones . 
  other people are judging your work ethic there and you do n't have distractions . 
  you do n't really need to bring a laptop with you most of the time ( only for something like programming/design ) , if you have notes write them on paper and if you need any videos to learn try to watch them beforehand and write the essential on paper . 
  good luck . 
  or newman running away and laughing like a maniac . 
  shit , i get those thoughts every day and i rarely smoke weed . 
  it sucks big time . 
  no `` the bannered mare '' em whiterun . 
  if we pick , do we not bleed ? 
  are you surprised ? 
  the low angle of the camera , the lineup , the early goal ... 
  i 'm gettin really bad vibes ... 
  watch the interview with sonic youth and the one with blur too, 
  there 's a great movie about a guy joining the partisans in the eastern front . 
  that movie is horrendous because it shows things that probably happened irl . 
  one of the best war movies out there . 
  idi i smotri ( come and see ), 
  edit : btw if anyone can tell me more movies like that i 'd be grateful, 
  i 'd say idi i smotri puts most of the other movies here in the bag . 
  one of the most intense movies i 've ever seen . 
  [ flyora in the beginning vs flyora in the end ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6wlzauu.jpg ), 
  it 's / r/soccer with blackjack and hookers . 
  hookers with moustaches . 
  um gajo que eu gostava de ver no porto era o [ dream mode ] omar abdulrahman [ / dream mode ] . 
  city !, 
  i do n't think he 's ever coming back to porto . 
  but i 'd like that very much . 
  ~ ~ arouca 0 - 0 mar\u00edtimo ~ ~, 
  belenenses 0 - 0 boavista, 
  if we win our group , we 're going to face the runner-up from group e ( belgium or italy most likely ) . 
  it 's an easy group but if we win it , things get a bit complicated .
