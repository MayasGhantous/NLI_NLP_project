  * the method nextint ( n ) generates a number between 0 and n - 1 , so you would have to add one to the generated number . 
  * you have to decide on how to check for repeated numbers . 
  you can do the verification during the execution of the cycle , or you can store the values in an array and then do the verification in the end before printing . 
  there is another option , but the final list wo n't be actually random . 
  you can use the code i wrote earlier for something like this :, 
  * take 230 and subtract the next integer ( 8 ) . 
  * you now have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 222 . 
  but that has 9 numbers . 
  so you can add 1 + 8 and you would get 9 . 
  you now have 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 222 . 
  * take 222 and subtract the next integer ( 10 ) . 
  * you now have 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 10 212 . 
  but that has 9 numbers . 
  so you can add 2 + 12 and you would get 12 . 
  you now have 3 4 5 6 7, 
  * take 212 and subtract the next integer ( 13 ) . 
  * you now have 3 4 5 6 7 9 10 13 199 . 
  but that has 9 numbers . 
  so you can add 3 + 13 and you would get 16 . 
  you now have 4 5 6 7 9 12 16 199 . 
  * if you keep doing this ( you have to find a termination condition that suits you , ) , you will get some numbers that ** look random ** . 
  they are not actually random , it 's more like a stair : 7 - 6 = 1 , 9 - 7 = 2 , 12 - 9 = 3 , 16 - 12 = 4 , etc ( this is due to our initial list being a sequence ) . 
  the next iteration would net us : 5 6 7 9 12 16 21 182 . 
  then 6 7 9 12 16 21 27 160 . 
  then 7 9 12 16 21 27 34 132 . 
  then 9 12 16 21 27 34 42 97 . 
  finally , you would get 12 16 21 27 34 42 52 54 . 
  that would be your final 8-number list . 
  it 's not random , but it looks more like it is . 
  notice how there 's the same `` stair behavior '' that i mentioned earlier . 
  i think i gave you some ideas , now you can try to figure how to write the code for it . 
  you can use the eclipse mars on your ubuntu version . 
  just download it straight from the eclipse website instead of using the ubuntu repository version . 
  i 've been using it on my laptop with ubuntu 14.04 lts and it works fine . 
  at least i have n't noticed anything wrong . 
  but you can try it , and if it does n't work remove it again . 
  campbell has shown more in 15 minutes than theo the whole season !, 
  for fucks sake , every year i get my fucking hopes crushed, 
  sanchez does the same thing every time he gets the ball . 
  fake going to the left , make a bad pass to the right . 
  arsenal and benfica fan here , you have no idea how stressful this day has been . 
  i 'd love to be able to say i love derbies , but i fucking hate this . 
  i was still shaking 15 minutes after the nld ended ... 
  i 'm better now , getting hyped for the benfica game , you should watch it !, 
  are you trying to say that performance enhancing drugs actually enhance performances ? 
  get out of here with your logic !, 
  he has probably been our best player today !, 
  really solid !, 
  i get your comparison , renato certainly is hindered by his lack of experience . 
  but martial is already world class !, 
  renato still has to improve some parts of his game to reach that level . 
  his passing is average at best ... 
  solid start , isaiah thomas has been on fire !, 
  this day has been a roller coaster of emotions to me , hope it ends on a high note !, 
  how are the bruins doing ? 
  i 'll be watching the game during the celtics breaks !, 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/41lcwb/jos%c3%a9_peseiro_is_the_new_porto_manager/cz4078y ), 
  what the fuck ? 
  was that not a foul on n. semedo ? 
  i never expected that jimenez and talisca would be responsible for us being in the ucl quarter finals !, 
  we are on to the quarters !, 
  ( and talisca scored ! ), 
  price gives up back to back hrs and now gets replaced by heath hembree . 
  please regular season , be the opposite of spring training . 
  i 'm also looking for it !, 
  if you find can you pm me ? 
  thanks !, 
  not op , but checking in : i got a ticket for 15 $ at the casa do benfica de aveiro . 
  no , they actually said they do n't make those deals for the nearby games , so i just bought the ticket . 
  sometimes you need to be associated with the casa do benfica , sometimes you need to be associated with the club itself . 
  this time they did n't ask for anything actually , so anyone could have bought it . 
  by the way , if you are interested , boavista still has some of the more expensive ones ( 25 $ upwards ) for sale at the stadium . 
  definitely , that would be a great idea !, 
  maybe for the rio ave game ... 
  i think you mean benfica , not bayern . 
  must have been a typo   :( :'(, 
  jonas with a really important goal there !, 
  it was n't a brilliant game , but it was solid considering benfica had one of the best players ( gaitan ) , the first gk , 3 of the 4 cb and the second best striker out . 
  really happy with that result , i was at the stadium and it was incredible !, 
  on the other hand , terrible display from beira-mar today against vista alegre ( distrital de aveiro ) , we definitely have to improve in the big games if we want to achieve the promotion !, 
  savage !, 
  why is count + = 1 better ? 
  i might be wrong , but is n't int immutable ? 
  if that 's the case , doing :, 
  count + = 1, 
  count = count + 1, 
  is just a matter of preference , since both create a new object . 
  edit : i 'm probably really wrong , i 'm still a beginner !, 
  iwobi and elneny have been surprising me !, 
  i wish we could be more consistent throughout the whole season ... 
  wow , what an excellent inning !, 
  6-5 now !, 
  can i get my ball games back ? 
  thanks, 
  great start by the offense today !, 
  big papi !, 
  i love this , what a start !, 
  hanley is our most improved player so far !, 
  i 'm really enjoying watching him this year !, 
  i 'll be doing an internship in sofia during the summer , i 'm looking forward to watching this in loco .
