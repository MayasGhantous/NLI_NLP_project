  we are definitely better this season , but we still have to improve the way we start the games !, 
  comeback time ? 
  ^ ^ ^ please, 
  shawshanked !, 
  let 's go red sox !, 
  5-3 , 0 out , it 's definitely possible !, 
  just as a side note , i think ( it 's just my opinion ) artists and engineers have a lot in common in the sense that both require creativity and not simply repeating the same task endlessly !, 
  you might actually know a lot about what inspires one to pursue engineering . 
  for me , it was the desire to create , which also applies to various artists . 
  good luck to your son !, 
  oh , he does n't need to link anything . 
  he 's totally legit . 
  he has also been a [ stripper ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/34a7b1/a_former_camgirl_responses_to_a_user_who_casually/cqssudy ) , [ studies islam academically ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4bgfx5/reports_of_explosions_at_brussels_airport/d19bmev?context=3 ) and the recipient of [ this letter ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/3xssls/i_found_a_ripped_up_christmas_card_on_the_train/cy7n63b ) . 
  he 's just messing around , pretty good comments actually . 
  that was really dirty horford ... 
  please , a smart three right now would be the perfect ending !, 
  ** i fucking love this team !, 
  thanks a lot for your streams man !, 
  he 's saying you can never have enough backup kickers , i think . 
  all your base are belong to us !, 
  itt : everyone, 
  you have probably made a typo . 
  points per game = total points / number of games ,, 
  total points = points per game * number of games ,, 
  therefore , in order to break the points-per-game record , one would need to have 96 points and not 98 . 
  96 points is 32 wins and 2 losses , or 31 wins and 3 draws . 
  is sporting the greatest sport team in portugal ? 
  i actually think that 's questionable . 
  both sporting and benfica are great team across all sports , but i do n't think there 's a clear winner . 
  i hope it turns out well for him , he 's still young and has a lot to learn . 
  great player all around , very important piece of our team , but terrible passing decisions . 
  not a player that i think would fit bayern 's playing style , but i might be wrong . 
  probably the best player in the league actually . 
  gait\u00e1n has n't been his usual self this season , and think the only other player that can be considered the league mvp is jonas . 
  i 's hard to measure potential , so everyone will have a different opinion . 
  i think renato has a huge potential ( more than the other two ) , but it 's up to him to live up to it . 
  regarding the current value and quality , i think it 's almost unanimous that joao mario is the better player . 
  one of the best in the league , for sure !, 
  i had never watched top gear us ( even top gear uk , i had only watched 3 or 4 episodes ) , and i started watching this season , and it is so much fun !, 
  this was a great episode , and the tesla part was just awesome !, 
  now i want to get one !, 
  giroud with an hat trick and possibly a st. totteringham 's day , there are not many better ways to finish a season !, 
  happy st totteringham 's day everyone !, 
  correct , but i was considering the fact that winning the league was pretty much off the table for the last couple of months . 
  but you 're absolutely right !, 
  the front page is glorious !, 
  i fucking love this , after just accepting spurs would have their year , this is just too good !, 
  5-1 against a relegated side !, 
  ** five fucking one !, 
  i will be doing an internship in sofia from july until september , i will pm you by then !, 
  04 jul 2016, 
  lets go get that top 2 !, 
  the final was great !, 
  i will be following this year 's season , and it is off to a great start !, 
  ^ desculpemadeptosdobraga, 
  i went into / r/nba/new to get this . 
  clicked on this thread just to laugh a bit . 
  ca n't say i 'm disappointed !, 
  tbf , an opinion is something personal that does n't need to make sense for others . 
  hey guys !, 
  it 's my first time watching the adac 24h of n\u00fcrburgring , anything you recommend me to look out for ? 
  ( like racers to watch ), 
  i 'll be trying to watch as much as possible !, 
  congratulations to afc wimbledon , one step closer to the pl !, 
  my favorite is the st bernardus christmas ale , followed by the st bernardus abt 12 and the chimay blue . 
  i 'm more of an ipa guy , but a good belgian quadrupel is always great !, 
  young !, 
  such a great signing !, 
  hoping for a great race !, 
  i 'll probably miss part of the race , but i 'll try to have rlm on all the time . 
  passarola blind date ipa or urraca vendaval from oitava colina !, 
  imo , those two are the best ipas ( and the best beers ) made in portugal !, 
  letra d , sovina ipa and marafada are also pretty good in what concerns ipas . 
  i feel exactly the same !, 
  i do n't like him , but i respect him as a player . 
  and i respect him even more after this series . 
  cleveland was down 3-1 against one of the best teams of all time , and they came back by winning three in a row , two of them at oracle arena . 
  it 's really difficult not to respect that , especially his emotion after winning . 
  as a basketball fan , i really enjoyed this series !, 
  having said that , now that he has done it , i hope he retires or goes to a bad team in the west or something . 
  i just want to not see him again , thanks . 
  de desporto costumo ouvir :,

  the only thing i have right now is the * bb | 1 . 
  bulgarian alphabet * course in memrise , as i feel i should learn the alphabet first . 
  i actually have exams up until the day before my flight , so i probably wo n't study a lot until then . 
  thanks , i will look into it !, 
  thank you !, 
  using my limited knowledge and with the help of google translate and the asking-questions skill , i will probably be able to figure out stuff inside the website . 
  usei as estat\u00edsticas do fourfourtwo . 
  it was great !, 
  st bernardus does make some of the fines beers around !, 
  and it seems to have given the red sox good luck !, 
  the season actually started this weekend , everyone should check out some games , it 's pretty exciting actually even if the player quality is not the same as the nfl .
