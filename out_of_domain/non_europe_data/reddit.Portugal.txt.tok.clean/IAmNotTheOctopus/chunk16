  the nfl has multiple games at 1pm , which is not that much later . 
  if i was ainge , i would not be looking for a blockbuster trade . 
  but i 'm so anxious , i really need to know what 's going on !, 
  we have those , our own in 2018 and a clippers sometime in the future ( not really sure when , but it has some conditions ) . 
  i think it was not there previously , he did n't remove it . 
  isaiah , why did you do this to me ? 
  ^ \u00ce ^ ^ still ^ ^ ^ love ^ ^ ^ ^ you, 
  the tweet says 33-13 , but it 's actually 33-17 . 
  celticsblog corrected it in a follow up tweet : https://twitter.com/celticsblog/status/839168753694814209 . 
  this is n't meant to create any kind of heat . 
  i sometimes also wonder if horford is worth all that money . 
  but he is , without question , a key piece of our team . 
  the top six teams make the playoffs , and this year there is a 14-4 team , 5 11-7 teams , my team at 10-8 . and then teams that wo n't make the playoffs . 
  basically , there are 5 teams at 11-7 and mine at 10-8 fighting for those 5 playoff spots . 
  anyone can get in , anyone can be left out . 
  wait , is that right ? 
  are n't durant , westbrook , derozan and harden paid the same as horford and conley ? 
  but yeah , you 're definitely right , if it 's between him and conley or nowitzki , it 's not a difficult choice . 
  porto , portugal . 
  i 'm not sure what to say , really . 
  this is incredible . 
  i had to wake up at 6:30 am and the game started at 3:30 am here in portugal . 
  unfortunately , going to sleep earlier so i could wake up for the game was not an option and i could n't watch it . 
  i had an alarm at 5:30 to check the score and when i woke up i could swear i saw we lost 130-118 . 
  it was only when i watched the highlights in the train that i realized we won . 
  and what a win !, 
  i watched the game yesterday , he did a great a job on tomic , who is a great player as well . 
  really good game all around , although barcelona have been really terrible this year . 
  i 'm very excited for zizic , hope he can translate this to the nba . 
  a rebounder off the bench would really help this team !, 
  let 's go on a run here !, 
  no b2bs , all home games against teams with a worse record ( miami 's record is deceiveing tho ) . 
  all of them are winnable games if we play at our best , so let 's go !, 
  hindsight is 20/20 . 
  history will tell , but it 's possible we also have an explosion just like that happening and just are n't noticing . 
  ** anathema - dreaming light . 
  the entire we 're here because we 're here album is the most beautiful thing i have ever heard , actually . 
  ** sebastian hardie - rosanna ** is a close second . 
  other than that , there are like three million yes songs that would fit this question . 
  ** bonus song : ** blackfield - miss u is also beautiful , in a depressing kind of way . 
  celtics fan here , i agree with that . 
  what you guys need is a healthy lebron . 
  honestly , your team for now is just that much better than any other team in the east .

  i , / u/iamnottheoctopus , of house / r/patriots swear my allegiance to the evil league of evil . 
  if my team is truly not one of the unholy 7 , may the football gods curse my stupid non-evil team next season and until the end of time . 
  their best players have played lots of minutes on sunday and are on a b2b and will have to rest . 
  i think our starting 5 should rest as few minutes as possible this second half . 
  winning this game would be huge , let 's get it !,

  that 's interesting . 
  i have actually started respecting him more . 
  i do n't like him . 
  but i do n't hate him , i actually respect what he has done as a player a lot . 
  but if you asked me 3 years ago , i would tell you i felt nothing but hatred for him . 
  great race by markelov , amazing performance in the last laps . 
  he is such an inspiration to us all , i hope he does what is best for him . 
  if he feels like the best thing is to play , it 's his call . 
  personally , i think i would take the day off , and if he does , everyone will support him !, 
  this would be the best for us , and also the evilest scenario - the three most hated teams getting to the final three . 
  boston sports radio guys are usually extremely reactionary , it 's ridiculous . 
  just ignore it . 
  brad is the only piece that is untouchable in our team . 
  guys , there is a survivor-like game going on over at / r/nfl . 
  everyday a team gets voted off , until the final three . 
  we are now up to the final four , and we want to eliminate the steelers . 
  unfortunately , the other three are voting so we are eliminated . 
  currently , we are 400 votes ahead ( which is bad , we want the steelers to have more votes ) . 
  the winner does n't win anything . 
  but we like to win just because it 's a win , so help us . 
  you do n't need a reddit account , just log in into your google account and vote here : https://goo.gl/forms/tkewa7orahpar9vk2, 
  please ** vote steelers ** !, 
  thank you guys !, 
  we are falling behind guys , i do n't have a good feeling about this . 
  but we can definitely do it !, 
  when do our australian fans wake up ? 
  just realized the game is on tnt . 
  i am not superstitious or anything , but ... 
  jk , let 's go win this one !, 
  celtics in 6 !, 
  please , i want king !, 
  i fucking love this team !, 
  i 'm watching here guys : http://onhockey.tv/, 
  yes , can you check now ? 
  come on !, 
  i do n't think i can survive a game 7 . 
  let 's win this one , let 's go on a run here !, 
  we got this !, 
  let 's win in boston !, 
  jaylen brown contributing to a game 7 in a big way upvote party !, 
  it 's actually a 25-75 chance . 
  this tom brady kid is going to be good . 
  regarding guimar\u00e3es , let me just say that guimar\u00e3es has the cup final against benfica next weekend and benfica will likely rest the starting 11 this weekend . 
  they might rest players as well . 
  i 'm just throwing the info out here . 
  i will actually probably bet on guimar\u00e3es as well , i will decide tomorrow morning . 
  i really wish this was a joke .
