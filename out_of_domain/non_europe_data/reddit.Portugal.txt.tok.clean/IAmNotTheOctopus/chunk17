  it 's not . 
  today sucks . 
  today sucks . 
  also wednesday sucked too . 
  i would mind . 
  i want the last game in the garden to be a w. 
  ideally , it would be game 6 of the finals . 
  but i 'll take this game 5 as well . 
  read it again . 
  game 6 of the finals . 
  fuck bill nye !, 
  as a non-american , i had no idea how cosby looked like . 
  you 're right though . 
  man , how can anyone not love this guy ? 
  a benfica fan saying there were bad refereeing decisions against his club . 
  a porto fan saying there were bad refereeing decisions against his club . 
  could it be that , maybe , but just maybe , referees sometimes make mistakes against every club ? 
  and maybe , just maybe , every fan chooses to ignore the decisions that benefit his club and remember just the ones that benefit the rival . 
  what . 
  was . 
  this ? 
  you are doing the exact same thing you criticized . 
  talk about hypocrites . 
  oops , my bad . 
  i thought you were / u/ygglow . 
  he criticized benfica fans for crying about corruption while actually just being butthurt . 
  once again , my bad . 
  i got the usernames mistaken . 
  how is that any different from what i just said ? 
  and why did you feel the need to insult someone over the internet ?

  i went with this one as well . 
  i 'm pretty sure moss , gronk and edelman will be on virtually everyone 's lists . 
  welker is a favorite of mine . 
  there is no valid reason to use pvcs . 
  i wo n't compare it to cvs or svn , which , although i do n't like them , have their merits . 
  edit : i had cvs alongside pvcs and i wanted to write it alongside svn, 
  leclerc is such a great driver !, 
  fucking the lakers will always be enjoyable . 
  having their pick makes it even better !, 
  trading for kyle o'quinn could be interesting , i think . 
  not sure on what would be a fair trade though . 
  um frontend developer que perceba como funciona backend , que perceba como funciona um browser , que perceba como funciona a internet , etc. 
  acho que o threshold \u00e9 22/23 $ , mas posso estar enganado . 
  leste e recomendas ? 
  recomendo que vejas os planos curriculares , compara com outras universidades , etc. 
  go to montserrat , it 's totally worth a day trip there - bring your own lunch though . 
  enjoy the museums and cultural aspects of the city , which are abundant . 
  i 'm interning here for the whole summer , if you have any specific questions , just pm me !, 
  e tu ? 
  e a afl . 
  e college . 
  \u00c9 de longe o meu desporto favorito . 
  ramsey has been amazing this year , hope he can keep this up . 
  how the hell was that not a penalty on bellerin ? 
  i live quite close to pl . 
  catalunya right now , and while my apartment is nothing special ( rent is low-ish , i ca n't really expect any luxuries ) , the place is actually very nice . 
  i would n't go as far as saying that ** almost everyone ** considers him to be ** by far the greatest ** . 
  some people consider him the greatest , but even if it 's a majority , it 's not ** almost everyone ** . 
  and from those who consider him the best , i am sure there are lots of them who would n't say ** by far ** . 
  i do n't know how to feel . 
  i really love it , and i sincerely wish him well in the future . 
  i actually think this is the best case scenario for both parties : celtics do n't have to pay him the max and he goes to a good team and eventually will get his max contract . 
  then why are you writing all caps , jae ? 
  i 'm down for it . 
  how many hours would you say you work ? 
  i am studying cs/se and i 'm avoiding the games industry because of long hours and low wages - i can deal with the latter , but i honestly do n't think i 'm able to put long hours towards something that is not mine , just someone else 's project . 
  fair enough . 
  thank you for your answer , it means a lot to us starting out when people take time to answer even the simples questions . 
  it would be more like a world beating . 
  that depends on the country/culture . 
  it 's very common in some places to have dinner at 9pm , so having lunch at 2pm would be perfectly fine . 
  what big update ? 
  as someone who started following boxing more closely this year ... this is amazing !, 
  cumps ,, 
  how is that not bribery ? 
  if you pay someone to do something/prevent them from doing something , that is the definition of bribery . 
  why do you say that ? 
  how can you even know that from the 1 day chart ? 
  the dip has been going on for more than one day . 
  we 're apparently not terrible anymore . 
  in all seriousness , really happy to know this is not one of those getting-smashed-every-big-away-game years . 
  also , credit to wenger , solid starting 11 and good subs ( albeit slightly late ) . 
  this was so scary . 
  brady do n't do this to me again , please . 
  i love me some chris hogan . 
  he has stepped up big time !, 
  brady running always cracks me up . 
  this is arguably the best front 7 in the nfl . 
  hopefully this performance has more to do with that than with our ol itself . 
  brady ca n't keep getting hit like that all year long . 
  14/20 , 245 yards . 
  2 rushing td , 1 passing td , 0 int . 
  granted it 's against the browns , but still impressive . 
  huge 3rd down , let 's go !, 
  defense is completely exhausted , this stop was essential !,
