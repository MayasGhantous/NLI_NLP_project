  i did n't know about that `` x '' , now i will take that into account when choosing my blazer . 
  thanks everybody for the answers !, 
  with the injuries we 've had this year , i actually think it 's a pretty good signing !, 
  i did n't want to believe the rumours ... 
  he was our captain !, 
  less than an hour now !, 
  ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ should ^ ^ ^ be ^ ^ ^ studying ... 
  i think you might like dead combo . 
  it 's a portuguese duo and they mix a lot of genres , including western ( and rock , fado , jazz , etc. ) . 
  i would n't consider them sad , but i think their music fits what you 're looking for . 
  you should probably ask / r/ifyoulikeblank , though .

  go germany !, 
  less than 5-0 is a loss !, 
  german and england have the stronger 2nd tier leagues , but i do n't now if the best players of these leagues are english/german ( if they do , they would probably win ) . 
  10 years old me , huge benfica fan ( as i still am ) , started reading the recruit by robert muchamore . 
  turns out the main character was a fan of arsenal and i started watching the games . 
  the 2007-2008 season was the one that turned me into a fan , though . 
  now i am divided and live in the hope that benfica and arsenal never meet ... ( emirates cup will probably be sad ), 
  portuguese fan here , i do n't think he would be a great signing . 
  sporting would want a lot of money ( more than what is being reported that ac milan wants for balotelli ) , and our midfield is pretty good already . 
  from the portuguese league , there are better players for us !, 
  markovic would be great , being unpredictable , having great pace , and showing up especially in the big games . 
  ( but we have theo walcott already ), 
  danilo is a great right back , but aurier is better , younger and cheaper . 
  garay is the best in his position in portugal , and seeing as he has only a year left in his contract , benfica are probably willing to let hin go at a cheaper price . 
  there are other good players and william carvalho is a great one , probably the best in the league , i just do n't think we need him that much to pay 45m $ . 
  that seat is mine , i just have to wait until thursday !, 
  the portuguese media have been reporting it as a done deal . 
  as a benfica fan , i 've watched all his games , and he is simply fantastic !, 
  if you watch some of his earlier games in the season ( vs sporting 31/08/2013 ) you can see how good he is attacking . 
  but he developed a lot during the season and he is now an attacking threat which also contributes defensively ( the game at home against juventus is a great example ) . 
  as an arsenal fan , i 'm glad you got it instead of chelski . 
  ^ ^ but ^ ^ fuck ^ ^ you . 
  estive a dar uma vista de olhos nos projectos do porto interactive center , e parecem interessantes !, 
  como \u00e9 o ambiente no isep ? 
  suddenly i do n't feel so bad about being eliminated in the group stage !, 
  * i will read for at least 30 minutes . 
  * i will read the news . 
  * i will clean and organize my desk . 
  * i will watch lecture 3 of 18.01 single variable calculus . 
  i know it 's not a lot , but i 'd rather do this than making a lot of plans and ending up doing nothing . 
  let 's give it a try !, 
  did n't have time to report back yesterday , but did everything i wanted , even though i could have spent more time reading than i did . 
  i did everything , which is good . 
  i hope everyone was able to achieve their goals .

  thoughts so far : fuck . 
  ( well , i 'm impressed with chambers !, 
  ) ^ ^ and ^ ^ \u00d6zil ^ ^ is ^ ^ nowhere ^ ^ to ^ ^ be ^ ^ seen , ^ ^ as ^ ^ usual . . 
  debuchy was another positive , and i think he and walcott will be great together !, 
  i do n't know about that version , but i have the 16gb moto g and it does n't have a card slot . 
  i use meenova ( cheap , small and so useful ! ), 
  and it works fine , so if you ( op ) need the extra space , take a look !, 
  it 's really a great phone , and it 's so much better than my old iphone 4 !, 
  welbeck will be the top scorer in the premier league . 
  eu sei que pensar sempre em xxx \u00e9 tentador , mas experimenta isto : http://www.uncommonhelp.me/articles/overcome-porn-addiction/, 
  is it too soon to say i love welbeck already ? 
  some thoughts :, 
  - alexis was well worth the money , he has been great both attacking and defending !, 
  - ozil looks lost in the wing , and drifts to the middle repeatedly , leaving lots of space . 
  - although he did n't score , i think welbeck had a great first half , and i think we should n't criticize afte only one game . 
  - please debuchy , be good !, 
  - i do n't know what it is , but ramsey has n't been as good this season as last season . 
  i hope he improves . 
  wilshere , on the other hand , has been great !, 
  motm for me . 
  - all things considered , it was n't a bad result , and we played well . 
  french : marseille, 
  scottish : celtic, 
  usa : seattle sounders and new york cosmos ( and since i support the patriots in the nfl , i have a soft spot for new england revolution as well ), 
  mr. odenkirk , i became a fan of your work after breaking bad and i have been asking myself : will better call saul have anything written by you ? 
  you 're a great actor , but an even better writer , and i was hoping we would get to see your kind of humor in the new show . 
  ps : i have n't read the book ** yet ** , but i will get to it . 
  where is it ? 
   what i 'd love to see is some backstory expansion on cooper 's first career in nasa . 
  this !, 
  it 's been in my head since watching the movie : how was his life before ? 
  and when i heard of a `` prequel '' comic , i thought it would deal with [ spoilers ] ( / s `` the crash '' ) . 
  thanks , i 've read a lot of good things about that series , so even if ends up not being the first one , i wil get to it soon . 
  thanks a lot !, 
  mistborn seems really interesting and i might actually read the original trilogy later this year . 
  ( still have a couple of books to read ), 
  regarding the name of the wind , it was already on my list , since it 's `` exactly '' what i was looking for !, 
  thanks for the recommendation !, 
  i read about shannara and it looks like it 's an awesome world . 
  i feel overwhelmed with the amount of books though . 
  any trilogy you recommend me to start with ? 
  or should i begin with the original trilogy ? 
  i will definitely look into that , and if i like it , i 'll check the other trilogies !, 
  i 'll start with the sword of shannara , and if i like it , i 'll check the other . 
  thanks for your input !, 
  that does sound awesome !, 
  i 'll put it on my list , so thanks for that !, 
  ( but 15 books ? 
  damn ... ),
