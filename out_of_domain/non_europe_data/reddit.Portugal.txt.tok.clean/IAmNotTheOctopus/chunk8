  it 's definitely a fumble , i do n't think it will be overturned !, 
  what a difference a play makes !, 
  martavis bryant , why do you do this to me ? 
  also , fuck the titans offense , ca n't you score a fucking point ? 
  i did n't think playing against the texans d was going to be such a pain in the ass ... 
  i think i agree with you ... 
  there 's absolutely no o-line , brady is being hit almost as soon as he gets the ball ... 
  but we have one of the best kickers to ever play the game , one of the best te ever , and the goat qb and goat coach . 
  this game is n't lost !, 
  7 points down , 7 minutes to go !, 
  i 'd go for it , 4th and 1 !, 
  that was a great throw to gronk , but on 3rd/4th down , i 'd sneak it . 
  brady is great at qb sneak !, 
  what do you guys think ? 
  are we in 4th down territory now ? 
  holy shit gronk i love you so much, 
  i now just need the seattle defense to have the best game they ever had , russel wilson to have the worst game of his carrer ( negative total yards would be great ) and julius thomas to have the best game all year . 
  also , doug baldwin ca n't catch anything , but since russel wilson wil have negative yards , that 's a given ,, 
  ninkovich with the header !, 
  slater , i 'm just confused ... 
  but if you add mccourty , hightower , edelman and amendola , i think it looks like a sb team ... 
  martavis bryant - 1 point , julius thomas - 1.20 points , seattle d - 1 point , cam newton - 14.28 points , odell beckham jr. - suspended . 
  yeah , not a good championship . 
  but it was my first season playing fantasy football , so it was n't that bad !, 
  just tuned in , is brady alright guys ? 
  i 'm 99.9 % sure this game is lost . 
  if somehow garoppolo wins us this game , i 'm getting a jersey with his name tonight . 
  okay , i 'm not sure on what you need to add to the path , but try this :, 
  open * my computer *, 
  right click , properties and then choose advanced system properties ( or something similar , my computer is not in english ) , choose the * advanced * tab and click on environment variables . 
  then , on the part that says systems variables , select the path variable and edit . 
  add this at the end : * ; c : \\ mingw \\ bin * if it 's not already there . 
  it does n't make it impossible . 
  i 'm in europe , 5 hours ahead of boston and i have followed the patriots , celtics , revs and bruins for the past few seasons . 
  some games run until 3 , 4 or 5 am but if you like it , you do n't even notice . 
  ( monday mornings during football season are especially difficult , though ), 
  this season i started following the red sox as well , and it 's even easier . 
  the afternoon games are great for that !, 
  my point is : being 3 hours ahead does not make it impossible !, 
  ffs , that was a clear penalty !, 
  i have family in kansas city , so i 'm kind of rooting for them . 
  but it 's hard to root against the houston patri ... 
  i mean , texans !, 
  this was the first season i followed the red sox , so i 'm not really familiar with how teams change in a year . 
  but do you really think it 's possible to go 96-66 ? 
  what makes you think that ? 
  i tink 85-90 wins is more realistic , tbh, 
  i actually feel the opposite . 
  being from portugal , i have no connection with any city , so i started following the patriots because i liked gronk in the first game i watched ( against the redskins in 2011 ) . 
  then , when i wanted to follow the other sports , i just started following the teams from the same city . 
  in azores it 's common to have family in the us . 
  in the mainland , not so much ... 
  i do have family in kansas city though , i just did n't know until a couple of years ago . 
  by then , i was already a boston fan !, 
  what the fuck ? 
  i really wanted that to be good . 
  walsh must be devastated ... 
  i feel so smart understanding that reference . 
  holy shit !, 
  i woke up , ate my breakfast and as soon as i opened facebook i started seeing pictures of david bowie . 
  i did n't think much of it until i read someone saying rip . 
  then it hit me . 
  what the hell , i totally was n't expecting this !, 
  man , your review of ** i ca n't give everything away ** ... 
  it 's such a well fitting track to end his career !, 
  looking at our schedule , i think we can go on a streak here !, 
  let 's go celtics !, 
  offense is not too bad . 
  the problem is the d , they are 5-8 on 3 point fgs . 
  that 's 15 points right there , in one quarter . 
  we are 1-4 . 
  we almost moved to st. louis , you can take that into account !, 
  ok , so gronk was in florida for the weekend . 
  he was seen boarding the flight ( there are pictures ) on sunday . 
  yet , somehow chandler jones went to his house and overdosed on pills . 
  that does n't make a lot of sense ... ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ still ^ ^ ^ worried ^ ^ ^ tho, 
  edit : the photo : https://twitter.com/onlyinbos/status/686244643026145280, 
  chandler jones went to the hospital sunday morning ( 7 or 8 am ) , so the 10 am flight does affect that . 
  i love smart , really . 
  he 's one of my favorite young players . 
  but he ** really ** needs to step up his offense ... 
  i know that , and i think he has improved and continues to improve a lot . 
  i did n't mean to say that he wo n't be great , because i 'm sure he will become better offensively . 
  that does n't mean he is already at that stage . 
  he is n't . 
  but he 's young and i 'm confident he will improve !, 
  i think we are favorites and i do n't think i 'm being delusional . 
  we might not be favorites by much , and this will be a difficult game , more than the one against the ravens last year i think , but we are playing in foxboro in january , we have tom brady , we have bill belichik . 
  no team in the league would be favorite in this scenario . 
  we also have a great defense , one that can force alex smith to make mistakes . 
  it would have been better if they did n't score , but we held them to 3 points and they burned 2 timeouts , could be worse !, 
  also , i 'm drinking a st. bernardus christmas ale , best beer i 've ever had !, 
  yes , now score 7 more , please brady !, 
  this drive is my new favourite porn movie . 
  gronkowski is now the all time te td leader in the play offs , i think !, 
  amendola , what a great return !, 
  now let 's get 7 boys !, 
  that should have been a fumble imo, 
  the butler did it !, 
  what a season he is having !,
