  i quite like that statement . 
  it sums-up pretty nicely the problem with the u.s. notion of freedom . 
  that being said , i would like to add that , in my opinion , your freedom ends where someone else 's begin . 
  you are free to act as you please as long as you do n't interfere with someone else 's well-being . 
  for example : you are free to listen to any music you want , as long as your neighbours are not disturbed by it . 
  in a more communist/socialist context another example could be that of a scientist who discovers a cure for some disease . 
  that scientist would have had the right to pursue research and be fully credited for his success . 
  he would also have some control over the use of his research ( he could ban a fascist group from ( miss ) quoting him or using his research as propaganda ) . 
  he should finally receive non-material benefits for it ( leadership of future medical research , more resources for his work , that kind of things ) . 
  however , as his discovery was done using knowledge gathered by thousands and tools made by millions he is not entitled to deny society full access to the cure . 
  that is : anyone would be free to access and read all of the research , as well as produce said cure but would need to credit him for discovering it if ever asked . 
  let 's take them one-by-one . 
  ** prostitution ** ) if you setup a true communist society , you would take away need . 
  that would automatically remove virtually all works that imply the exploitation of one person by another as persons would n't need to submit to rough treatment to survive and thrive . 
  however ( and this is were things get interesting ) we have the situation of a transitional state , going from capitalism ( or other ) to communism . 
  in this period there would still be a limited amount of need . 
  during that time ( and going forward ) prostitution needs to be illegal . 
  though it would only be a crime for the person requesting and not for the `` whore '' . 
  the first one would be punished ( and possibly treated , if mental disorder is present ) whilst the second would be helped ( and only imprisoned if he/she refuses said help ) . 
  help meaning : getting std check , making sure that person is not mentally ill , provide her with as much of her basic needs as society allows at the time and educate her to better herself . 
  if you want me to expand on the reason this system needs to be kept after the full transition or what to do in case the `` whore '' refuses help ( or anything else ) , feel free to ask away . 
  ** gambling ** ) if people have no particular propriety i do n't really see what that would gamble . 
  most unique items would be owned by the community and the others would be family heirlooms with sentimental value ( that a person would n't gamble away unless he/she is in extreme need , need that has been eradicated ) . 
  i honestly ca n't see how one person would accumulate ( or loose ) wealth this way in a commi state . 
  ** vices ** ) as long as said vices do n't threaten the thriving of the human race , they should be fine . 
  i , for once , like to spend too much time on the pc . 
  it 's slightly bad for me , but not to the point it hinders society ( heavy medical costs , etc ) . 
  however something like smoking does and hence smoking should be banned . 
  this ban includes all substance that have a negative effect on the self without being outweighed by the beneficial . 
  ** soft-drugs ** ) smoking `` pot '' would be illegal for the reasons mentioned above . 
  however i ca n't see why some recreational substance could n't be given to people who request it . 
  provided it 's in a controlled environment ( a room where one ca n't hurt himself ) , in limited doses and the persons submits to regular medical checks , i believe it would be a good thing for a society . 
  socialist/communist here :, 
  what i am afraid is that some of my comrades tend to be more interested in bringing down the bourgeoisie ( and punish them ) than in bettering the human condition . 
  killing the bastard that made the child hungry will surely feel good , but wo n't feed the kid . 
  first off , thank you for answering and for you doing so politely . 
  it 's all too rare these days . 
  prostitution : this is going to be a bit utilitarian , so please bare with me . 
  prostitution is always bad for the `` whore '' . 
  it will , systematically , decrease one 's happiness and thus society 's happiness . 
  a person would still be able to give herself in body to a random stranger , if she wills , but not gain wealth ( material ) from it . 
  i should mention at this point that i believe that it 's society 's goal to achieve the greatest happiness for all of it 's members and some members need to be protected , sometimes even from themselves . 
  i would also add that , unfortunately , in many nations women are inferior to men on the social pyramid and that , even after a revolution , a few men and women may still linger into those positions and both need to be educated , in different ways , toward achieving a greater happiness for all . 
  gambling : yep . 
  i ca n't see what to gamble with . 
  check other posts on the subjects for other opinions . 
  vices : `` would you ban certain types of food ? '', 
  in a word : yes . 
  though i would n't see fit to , for example , ban all fast-food . 
  i think that the best way to go would be to ban products that are designed to be cheap and nasty without consideration for health and nutrition . 
  you would still be able to buy/get potato chips , they just would n't be allowed to be burned or processed in certain fashions . 
  in the case of physical activity , the benefits outweigh the issues by a tremendous gape , so it would be strongly encouraged . 
  soft-drugs : the two are not mutually exclusive . 
  imagine the following : after a tiring and fulfilling week of labour , you and your comrades go to a relaxation centre , were a lovely lady assign you a comfy room and give each of you a patch/drink . 
  in said patch/drink is a relaxing/cool drug . 
  you go to the room , coated in soft foam without any edge , sit down with your mates and just chill out for an our . 
  afterwards , you all go home . 
  only condition is to do a couple of test every few time you go to check your health ( allergic reactions/overuse ) . 
  inb4 , not all drug are as addictive as cigarettes or hard-drugs . 
  i reckon that pot can be beneficial and most of the people i 've known to smoke it never developed addiction . 
  the issue is health and social , however . 
  i believe a lot of the drug problem we have in the world comes from the way we deal with them . 
  i would add to number two that robots can replace almost all of the manual workforce . 
  the u.s. could feed itself with about 5 % of the population working in the agriculture . 
  you would of course need all the machine making and fuel production , but even with that i believe it would n't go above 10 % . 
  you just made me realise how old i am ... 
  a sacred secret order from england has to use their captured vampire dracula to fight against an invading army of nazi-vampires all the while a priest from the vatican armed with holy bayonnets launch a new crusade . 
  show : hellsing ultimate . 
  would this depend on the material the planet is made of ? 
  it would seem intuitive ( albeit probably wrong ) that a planet made almost entirely of hydrogen would require much less energy to start fusion than a planet made of heavier elements , such as iron and above . 
  this is a good article to link when someone says china is communist . 
  though , considering how much we ( swiss ) are obsessed with privacy and with our direct democracy i think we are ( and will stay ) free from laws such as hadopi ( france ) . 
  he cut his spending by about three time my maximum take-home income . 
  details : i get a maximum of 391 $ / month from my scholarship ( 9-5 , 8hours of `` class '' a day ) . 
  that covers food ( 117 $ ) , transportation ( 91 $ ) and medical bill ( ~ 156 $ ) . 
  that leaves 27 $ that i usually keep in case they are late to pay the scholarship that month . 
  luckily though i no longer have to pay any house bills ( power , water , internet , rent , etc ) . 
   the years prior to reaching `` communism '' . 
  that , i think , is one of the most important thing many leftists ( like myself ) overlook . 
  we , as humans , have so far failed to create a communist society . 
  that means that , somehow , at some point , we missed something . 
  thank you for mentioning it , 
  now , to answer your question , i would say that heavy taxations and even removal of some wealth and ownership is a very good way to better the society and a good step toward a peaceful revolution ( i am portuguese , so i 'm kinda into the whole `` peaceful revolution '' thing right now ) . 
  that does not mean that it is the way to better things and it is not enough by itself . 
  i 'd say it 's a step and a good one . 
  being myself a leftist , i see things more in the perspective of common ownership ( or , if you prefer , no ownership ) . 
  that means the product of your labour is both yours and your neighbours . 
  if you will , every one puts their labour together ( i put sugar , you put water and he puts flour and we all eat cake kinda deal ) . 
  now , to answer the question of upkeep and upgrading : since i am ( hypothetically ) a skilled engineer , i 'll make an upgrade to the current oven ( not mine , not yours , ours ) whilst you work on producing better flour or getting more sugar . 
  of course , i can be an ass and not do anything , but that means that , at first i 'll eat bad cake and second ( when people realize that you are the best suited and are not working ) you will get a pie in your face ( or some kind of punishment ) . 
  in communism/socialism it 's always `` from each according to his ability '' . 
  note : i 've answered from a socialist/commie perspective , i am not sure about anarchism and thus will not endeavour in it . 
  i agree with you on that one . 
  i 'd add that the soviet model under lenin dealt with this issue in a way that i find rather clever . 
  by building camps where criminals were sent to work their way to rendition . 
  of course their methods might not have been the best ( it was a century ago , mind you ) but i believe that it was on the right track . 
  looking at present day norway we see that incarcerated people are treated as humans and that leads to low levels of crime and violence there . 
  if you `` give '' someone the option to learn and work their way to rendition i believe most will actually chose it and improve themselves whilst helping society . 
  i believe , however , that all criminals ( particularly reactionaries ) that do not want to/refuse to take part in recovery should be executed . 
  a simple `` do or die '' principle that seems much more human than forcing someone to live through the hell of american prisons .
