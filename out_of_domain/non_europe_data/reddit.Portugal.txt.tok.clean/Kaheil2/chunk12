  having one 's country known more for it 's current drug policy than anything else feels preety funny , 
  in practice what i noticed from personal and unscientific experience is an increase in the number of users but a big decrease in people i would define as `` addict '' or `` junkies '' . 
  one ( weird ) thing i noticed is that portuguese pot-smokers tend to be very aggressive whilst their counterpart from northern are much more...hippie-ish . 
  it 's sad to see that in a nation that has known so closely what inequality and division leads to , communists must still hide their faces when they demand what i see as basic rights . 
  say what you will , the corporate ( i.e. 
  bourgeois ) media are incredibly efficient at manipulating the masses . 
  i 'm fairly convinced that at some point someone will claim there where more death in the u.r.s.s. 
  than there were people there at the time . 
  people seem to be genuinely interested in having a socialist/communist podcast . 
  i 've long wanted to do podcasts again but i 've never manage to get it actually done for several reasons ... maybe i can try to get one pilot episode out by the end of this month ( no promise ) . 
  what would you actually want from such podcast ? 
  political talks , rants , recent news , history , readings ? 
  because wearing the red-hat fedora tells other geeks you run gentoo and not to ask you about that `` debian '' thing . 
  i personally prefere debian however . 
  paris . 
  though i do n't live there presently i know it well : it 's a shithole . 
  it 's dirty , noisy , smelly , filthy and crowded . 
  the outskerts and some places can be pretty nice but overall it 's not a nice place to live , imo . 
  portugal : as somewhat greedy and uneducated/rough ( the last one mostly because of tv shows like misfits ) . 
  there is also , and in opposition to what i previously stated , a certain idea of '' posh '' and '' snob '' surrounding english schools and tourists . 
  ps : this is not meant as a critique or insult to the people of the kingdom . 
  whilst some british folks are complete twats , most are pretty awesome ( check out the linux outlaws podcast , for example ) . 
  i 'm not sure where i last heard this quote , but when i hear of the dprk building-up their army and nuclear arsenal i think of it : `` it 's not paranoia if they really are out to get you '' . 
  anyway , beautiful video that truly shows another side to this intriguing country . 
  thank you very much for sharing it , mrmcawhsum . 
  being able to pleasure oneself with a vib . 
  yes , i 'm lazy and also because after 30min your arms hurt . 
  same as in portuguese . 
  wow , awesome . 
  i 've been running a steampunk rpg myself so i 'm definitely interested in your project . 
  will keep an eye on it . 
  people still do that here , but sadly it 's quickly going away . 
  probably something to do with the cultural isolation of the pre-revolution and with the strong catholic culture . 
  just not to portugal . 
  on a basic pre-paid plan an sms will cost ~ 0.20 $ ( 26 cents ) and a minute ~ 0.32 $ ( 42 cents ) . 
  though the 4g network is fast and `` relatively '' affordable ( 15 $ / gb , that 's ~ 20 $ / gb ) . 
  note : these price are from mid-2012 , have n't checked since . 
  also , keep in mind that you can drop the bill by having two phones/double sim . 
  thank you very much , 
  [ this kid ] ( http://imgur.com/7ckpx ) ( from [ this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/firstworldanarchists/comments/y4zad/aw_shit/ ) ) looks awfully like him . 
  i 'd love to know the ` european ' version of this . 
  i 'm well informed on a local ( national ) level but a bit more clueless when it comes to the eu . 
  i can answer regarding portugal . 
  though there are quite a few folks named jesus they are almost all first generation emigrants from brazil or africa . 
  the most common names are that of saints ( peter , john , etc ) or maria which is very common as a first name for girls and second name for boys . 
  though portugal sent the ` mor ' ( spelling ) packing centuries before they were out of the peninsula so that might have been a factor . 
  i find that , in my experience , the most knowledgeable and resourceful ` it ' folks i know all started like this . 
  for some reason many of them have n't even finished high school or even set a foot in university . 
  i was once told that the parking break engaged the rear wheels breaks whilst the postal engaged the front ones . 
  is there any true to this ? 
  edit : frontal , not postal . 
  * mumbles something about autocorrect *, 
  thanks for clarifying that . 
  the ` academie francaise ' one made me laugh quite a bit because of how true it feels . 
  i 'll write down a few ideas when i 'm back on my pc . 
  north vs south should be depending on what ideology one pick . 
  ** southern lazyness ** : portugal and spain tile improvement construction speed decreased by 25 %, 
  [ ** lenin 's words ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kezjxi-iqs4 ) : when entering the industrial era , russia 's leader changes to lenin , leading to 2 turns of anarchy . 
  afterwards order is automatically chosen and it becomes impossible to choose autocracy or freedom . 
  ** fan death ** : korea can not build windmills, 
  ** ` murican fanaticism ** : +15 % to faith yield from population and buildings . 
  -35 % science in the empire . 
  ** capitalism ** : when america and the english enter the industrial era , they get +5 % gpt and -15 % happiness . 
  repeats ( and stacks ) itself for every era afterwards until future era . 
  can not choose order . 
  most popular amine here , yet i never got into it . 
  not as a ` child ' nor now . 
  you should unionise to argue that iminus.com is not oppressive speech under a marxist perspective and , therefore , should n't be censored by a would be socialist leader . 
  i 'd actually be interested to know how much strength is required . 
  if someone is willing to i 'd love to know how much torque he is withstanding . 
  when every single item on the frontpage applies only to the usa . 
  i really love reddit and participating in its community but , living on a small peninsula and being rather penniless , i often find it hard to fit in . 
  honestly i do n't really understand what 's wrong with banning regular people from buying explosives , including black powder . 
  not so much because they would be used to kill groups of people , like in the recent events in boston , but because people can easily harm themselves and other with it . 
  1 ) cars serve an utilitarian function . 
  they are not , in general a recreational tool . 
  unlike black powder who is , for the general public , a recreational tool . 
  2 ) if there where a safer and similarly priced alternative to cars i would ban the car . 
  as long as there is none , no ban . 
  3 ) i live in a county where explosives are illegal to even manufacture ( much less purchase ) without proper licensing and have not , in any way , seen anyone 's life being worsen by that . 
  having marshall zuchov spawn in berlin was really an awkward moment . 
  depending on your country you may want to check if your local communist party is not organising some kind of celebration . 
  it 's the case in most of europe . 
  this is actually pretty accurate . 
  the use of `` tu '' in french is usually reserved for informal scenario , but it can be used to denote a certain authority/superiority on the person you are speaking to . 
  it is , for example , used towards children . 
  also , as a native ( albeit not necessarily very good ) french speaker napoleon 's speech sounded perfectly correct , down to the accent . 
  i 've only got one , albeit very small and barely noticeable , bug in 13.04 . 
  it 's been working much better than 12.04 so far . 
  all my printers have been working as plug & play for the good part of a decade now . 
  granted they tend to be lower-end models with less features, 
  note : i 've been on ubuntu for awhile now , not sure how it fares on windows . 
  reminds of the ending of sword art online ( the game ... in the eponymous anime ) . 
  so gorgeous ... 
  that fits pretty well with what i read earlier this week . 
  to my understanding , in a neutral environment like the iss you have to abide by international law and your coutry 's law . 
  though , as far as i know , no tribunal has jurisdiction in space so , as long as you stay up there , you ca n't be tried . 
  i 'll get sources as soon as i 'm not on my phone . 
  and also the fact that our ( swiss ) history is n't that interesting or colourful . 
  modern day swiss is very nice but it was quite unremarkable for a long time ( compared to giants like the prussians or francia ) .
