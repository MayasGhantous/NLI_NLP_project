  they saw , specially in the case of the dprk , rapid improvement of quality of life ( in the 70 's you were much better off in the north than in the south of korea ) but were ultimately hindered by autocrats . 
  unfortunately that goes a bit beyond my knowledge ( i know quite a fair bit about ww2 but anything beyond that is more general knowledge on my part than something i studied more profoundly ) . 
  best of luck in finding out more though . 
  short answer : it 's false . 
  long answer : i 've actually asked this question [ a while back ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/1c4to0/is_there_a_different_aspectpov_to_the_holodomor/ ) . 
  you may want to check [ this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/1c4to0/is_there_a_different_aspectpov_to_the_holodomor/c9dcmra ) by / u/east _ river, 
  i can speak from experience that the support for the 4xxx has been ... irregular . 
  they work well under 12.04 , but can not run the source engine with the proprietary drivers . 
  on 12.10 & 13.04 they are a bit buggy and no proprietary drivers are available , so performances are down . 
  i hope 13.10 / 14.04 / 3.12 will see those issues fixed . 
  i 'll hijacked your comment to warn anyone watching this that playing with a real sword to show off to your friends is a bad idea . 
  i 've trained martial arts for years and trained with a staff and wood/plastic swords and seen some really nasty injuries on people who `` knew what they were doing '' . 
  swordfights , or any kind of weapon fights , are awesome but are no joke . 
  never use live/sharpen weapons . 
  use soft wood sticks that will bend and not splinter , avoid anything heavy and never use a real sharp anything . 
  even alone you should never use a real weapon unless you have at least 5 years of practice . 
  that being said , i encourage anyone who is interested to start to look for ( serious ) classes . 
  it 's really an amazing sensation when you reach a certain level . 
  if you have any questions feel free to ask , i 'll try my best to answer . 
  this is going to be extremely specific , but most mice with multiple and unusual buttons will tend to cause app that do a mouse capture to register two devices . 
  in practice this means some games/other software will react as though someone is using a gamepad . 
  if your goal is gaming and you do not want to fiddle around i would recommend mice with 6 buttons or less . 
  unfortunately not in the afford mentioned show , no . 
  english is my fourth language so when i 'm typing , specially on my phone , i often make spelling mistakes . 
  my bad . 
  i 'm amazed any university would use non s.i. 
  units for science/tech . 
  course . 
  is that official policy or the teacher 's whim ( i 've seen a lot of that ) ? 
  also , guessing your not from liberia , how common is that practice in the u.s. ? 
  at least you use celsius/kelvin . 
  fahrenheit is just too confusing . 
  and most brits ( at least younger crowd , bellow 45 ) know metrics . 
  tbh speaking/dealing with british fellows is easy in terms of unit . 
  only the date gets mixed up sometimes . 
  english , for better or worst , is the lingua franca , russian is not . 
  reddit is also an international website . 
  though on a subreddit dedicated to u.s.a. oriented topics it would make sense to use imperial units . 
  but , ultimately , it 's more about being nice and going towards the other . 
  most foreigners learn english which in all likely hood is easier to do than having a native learn a foreign language . 
  it would seem to me that having the group of people that use hard and unusual units learn and/or use the simpler & more common system would make more sense . 
  again , in the context of international groups , such as reddit 's community . 
  i think people just make fun of that rather than being actually annoyed . 
  though i 'm not sure why `` american football '' has come to get that name . 
  5 ' 5 and i 'm average/slightly tall . 
  come live near the mediterranean sea . 
  unfortunately this video seems to have been blocked . 
  an acquaintance ( for lack of a better word ) of mine , 17y old i think , is n't allowed to take public transports or go out alone for anything but school or karate practice . 
  it might be for some reason though , i do n't know too much . 
  local sms ( s ) . 
  i refuse to pay for them by the unit because of the ludicrous benefit margin on them ( about 12 ' 000 % ( as in twelve thousand percent ) ) . 
  here an sms will cost you about 0.2 $ , or 0.27 $ , for up to 160 octets ( that 's 1.6875 $ per kilobyte , or 1 ' 687 ' 500 $ per gigabyte ( 1 ' 258 ' 576 $ , 1 ' 056 ' 537 # ) ) . 
  the source for the benefit margin comes from the time i worked for the mobile division of a large tech company . 
  the cost for the sms is based on the basic plans for the two largest phone operators of the country as of june 2012 : vodafone and tmn . 
  [ here ] ( http://imageshack.us/f/134/vincigt2wf6.jpg/ ) is an image of the gt-r , though this one never got beyond the prototype stage , as far as i know . 
  you can find more pictures of the vinci gt on [ this post ] ( http://planetarodas.blogspot.pt/2011_09_01_archive.html ) ( pt ) . 
  the rounder one is the prototype . 
  the company later closed but the car is supposed to come back as a kit car from [ lusomotors ] ( http://lusomotors.com/ ) , in the for of the [ lm gt ] ( http://lusomotors.com/lm-gt/ ) . 
  here is a [ render ] ( http://lusomotors.com/wp-content/gallery/lm-gt/lm_gt_barchetta.jpg ) of what it might ( hopefully ) look like . 
  edit : mixed up protocols , my bad . 
  thank you very much for your answer . 
  i think i understand what you are saying . 
  it does n't really make it easier though ... people are ( uniquely ) complicated . 
  i feel that this last sentence is what 's most important , however . 
  i 'll be sure to keep it in mind . 
   the most patronizing thing is ignoring someone 's dislike of something because they 're supposed to feel something that they do n't . 
  it 's very expensive , no doubt about it . 
  but it manages to be cheaper than local calls in some countries . 
  for example with vodafonept/tmn basic pre-paid plan it would be cheaper to call someone in guiana ( 0.2952 $ / min ) than to call someone next to you ( 0.32 $ / min ) . 
  the discrepancy widens with sms , in which case it costs 0.0984 $ / sms and ~ 0.2 $ / sms , respectively . 
  keep in mind that at 0.2 $ / sms the gigabyte of data costs over one million euro . 
  well , in nature it 's know as a [ mating ritual ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mating ) . 
  for humans ( and i just discovered that ) it 's apparently the word [ `` courtship '' ], 
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/courtship ) that applies . 
  whilst the wikipedia article does a far better job than i me at explaining it , in this context i meant it as the little ( or not so little ) things one does in order to get the attention and interest of a potential partner . 
  the little smile when you see them around the corner , bringing them home-made lunch , etc. 
  in portugal , near lisbon . 
  the vast majority of houses and apartment do not have any form of built-in heating or cooling . 
  landlords are not legally required to provide heating , cooling or insulation . 
   if you ca n't even afford electricity, 
  just to clarify , i can afford electricity for things like lighting or a computer ( i 'm not browsing via neural implants ... yet ) . 
  however a single 2000w electric heater would suck upwards of ~ 10 % of my income if left on all the time ( that 's assuming it has some kind of temperature control , if it 's truly always on then it would jump to ~ 20 % of my income ) . 
  gas is cheaper , but still beyond my budget . 
  thank you very much for your answer . 
  the incense trick is definitely a clever idea . 
  unfortunately i do n't have heaters but i should be able to obtain weatherstripping fairly easily . 
  i might also check if i can get silicon for free . 
  i hope you do n't mind me asking , but what was the font used in sweden 's letter to aland ? 
  otherwise a great comic . 
  i specially loved ( the giant ) gernazi . 
  that 's actually a good idea . 
  i 'll have to replace the cooking molds with bricks , but that might just work . 
  i 'll have to calculate if candles are more expensive than gas though . 
  thank you for mentioning this . 
  i 'm all too aware of the risk of monoxide and dioxide poisoning ( let 's say i had some darker times ) . 
  fortunately my house ( well , appartement ) is drafty enough that i do n't have to worry about that . 
  it 's actually great for 75 % of the year since it 's very good against moisture and mold . 
  the heater i have here is a 2000w gas heater , but it 's output can be reduced so i suppose it would be closer to 750w on average . 
  an 11l gas bottle costs about 30 $ which is actually pretty cheap ( in terms of w / $ ) but still a bit ... much . 
  the 2000w electric heaters i was used to were the ones used in the ... err ... `` communal house '' ( i 'm not sure of the english word for it , it 's a place where you pay very little rent , all utilities are included , but have to share a small space with many folks ) and in my high school several years ago .
