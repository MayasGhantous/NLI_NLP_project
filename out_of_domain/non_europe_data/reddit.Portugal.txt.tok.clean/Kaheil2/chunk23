  forgot to prepare your meal for when you are out tommorow ? 
  diet time !, 
  want/need to go out ? 
  walking time . 
  it 's raining ? 
  well , if it wo n't kill you it 'll make you stronger . 
  haha , i meant 3 or 4 times a week to spare water and gas . 
  my bad . 
  `` technically breaking a rule '' . 
  what does that mean , precisely ? 
  breaking a rule without causing harm ? 
  or breaking a rule only because said rule 's text is ambiguous ? 
  or something else ? 
   `` we have a zero tolerance policy against drugs . 
  this kid was carrying an asthma inhaler which is technically a drug so we confiscated it '', 
  would n't that be more a question of a poorly written law ? 
  for example saying that all `` non-medicinal '' or all `` non-fda-approved '' drugs/medicines/substance are unallowed would let people bring medicine without being able to bring `` actual '' drugs . 
  or am i just missing the point entirely ? 
  i was born in switzerland and grew-up there , so culturally i 'm obviously heavily influenced by that nation 's customs . 
  presently , however , i live in poortugal . 
  i 'll admit it 's a fault on my part and something i 'm still working on , but i often have issues with people not following rules . 
  more precisely : understanding how a social group works when they have established rules that they seem to follow or break randomly , with people reacting either well , neutral or badly in a seemingly random manner , too . 
  now , i 'm not criticizing people for doing that , within reason of course . 
  i realize that most social groups operate this way , it 's just a personal issue i struggle with . 
  you would indeed . 
  for all their woes the french people still have somewhat human limits on how an employee can be treated by a customer . 
  actually i enjoyed working and talking with french people ( and still do to this day ) . 
  and , whilst this is a bit of a stereotype , i found that dealing with people from paris was a bit more difficult . 
  they often seemed stressed and somewhat arrogant , in the sense that something was due to them . 
  i get : `` err_connection_refused '' when trying to access ( healthcare.gov ) from portugal . 
  well , i first get redirected to https://www.healthcare.gov/ and then get the error . 
  not that i 'm particularly interested in accessing the site altogether . 
  keys on a keyboard , anime , anime characters , symbols in the japanese `` alphabets '' , tv channels ( i do n't have tv ) , body parts , numbers , pc parts/components , cities , nations , leaders , video games , words ( well , several thousands across six languages ) and etc. 
  i may be slightly obsessive ... 
  gs2 , android 4.2.2 , and it claims incompatibility . 
  odd . 
  i 'm very happy with aviate so it is n't a big deal but it bothers me that more often than not apps are `` incompatible '' . 
  mainstream apps work , but usually the new apps/services refuse to install via the store . 
  i 'm not sure how that 's relevant in the context ( i 'm not saying this ironically , i think i 'm simply missing the point ) . 
  but if you trace my ip you 'll indeed find that port 80 ( and 443 ) requests route to my presently switched off server . 
  oh , silly me , i did n't even bother running a lookup on the address . 
  thank you for the clarification . 
  if your phone is carrier free ( like mine ) the official update is available to get past 4 . x , otherwise it 's carrier dependent ( i would still check ) . 
  otherwise check [ cyanogenmod ] ( http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/i9100_info ) . 
  unless you are in the u.s. jailbreaking is perfectly legal , too . 
  one of the most beautiful oc i 've seen on this subreddit in a long while . 
  is it your daily drive ? 
  i do n't understand the slang of kids/teens in any of the languages i speak , either the local one , native one or foreign ones . 
  i think it may have a relation with the social group one interacts with , however . 
  one of my lady `` friend '' ( i 'm european so the word friend tend to have a slightly different meaning here ) is a huge fan of anime . 
  she has watched more anime than i have , which is not that common to find in a lady . 
  otherwise most people i know that attend anime convention are girls , but that 's for other reasons . 
  how about something in the lines of `` restricted/partially restricted/available '' or `` region restricted/partially restricted/available worldwide '' . 
  usually region restricted means north america only so people outside of it are used to associate `` region restricted '' with `` not available in my country '' . 
  unfortunately adobe does not provide an updated version of flash for linux anymore so the only solution is to either use chrome or an independent flash player . 
  regardless , thank you for the help . 
  merry winter solstice celebrations comrades . 
  best wishes from a proud member of the pcp ( portuguese communist party ) . 
  tales of the past iii , by martin falch . 
  i asked about a related event ( the `` holodomor '' ) a while back . 
  check out the [ answer by comrade / u/east _ river ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/1c4to0/is_there_a_different_aspectpov_to_the_holodomor/c9dcmra ) or [ this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/1a5ujf/sources_for_different_perspectives_on_things_like/ ) , also on / r/communism101 . 
  thank you very much . 
  i was looking more for historical accounts than writings on marxism , however ( albeit i 'll eventually get to read those as well but i have much to learn ( and read ) before ) . 
   when will people figure out that trying to hide things from the nsa is n't the way to fight them ? 
  mass surveillance is n't a technological issue , it is a political one . 
  we should n't be playing a cat and mouse game with the nsa . 
  they will always be the better spy than you or me , but we need to change the rules politically so the nsa does n't continue trying to spy on us . 
  i ca n't fully agree with your statement . 
  whilst i definitely see the issue with pursuing a cat 'n' mouse game , i feel your statement does n't address the `` practical '' issue at hand . 
  in practice what we have are nations and companies , in my case foreign ones , attempting to gather data on individuals . 
  my government is not spying on me . 
  sadly it 's not something i , or the vast majority of the people on the planet , can solve through politics . 
  so i think projects like this one , tor , openwhispers and so forth are a very important part of the solution . 
  i truly hope that citizens of the nations that are abusing privacy will fight against it , but for the rest of us encryption is key . 
  note : when i state that `` my '' government is not spying on me i do not mean to imply that said authority is more virtuous than that of other states . 
  i know they are not spying in such a manner simply because they do n't have the resources , either human , economical or technological . 
  or latins in general . 
  i love the portuguese but damn are they noisy !, 
  `` lutter '' and `` combattre '' would be closer to `` fight '' whereas `` debattre '' would be closer to `` struggle '' i believe . 
  in a way , in french , `` struggle against the bourgeoisie '' would become `` fight against the bourgeoisie '' . 
  the words `` lutter/luchar/lutar '' would be literally translated to `` fight '' but a better adaptation is indeed `` struggle '' . 
  as comrade / u/rndzvs said it 's indeed an interesting phenomenon . 
  probably linked to the latin root of spanish ( and other roman languages ) as opposed to the germanic root of english . 
  right in the feels ... 
  this video is not available in your country . 
  i already have it installed . 
  it works awesomely indeed but seems to dislike youtube . 
  it takes a brave person just to drive in traffic here , in portugal . 
  portuguese here . 
  i can confirm that in portugal a small majority of the people look like that but you 'll find hundreds of different body types , hair , skin color , etc. 
  whilst there is no walmart here ( the closest one is an ocean across ) i got a look at the list and will do some research for reviews . 
  thank you . 
  < 35 $ is the maximum , but < 20 $ would be best . 
  nowhere ... the original price was 15 $ / m. 
  short version is that a local ( portugal ) isp ( zon ) now offers cellphone plans . 
  the original price was 15 $ / m for unlimited calls & sms with a minimum of two phones . 
  through negotiations i got the price down to 5 $ / m for the first year and 10 $ / m for the second with a two year contract ( and two phones , so twice that , though i only pay for one of them since my roommate uses the other ) . 
  and by all means you are welcome to come . 
  our apartment is small and cold and we mostly eat pasta but if you are willing to put up with that our door is open . 
  great !,
