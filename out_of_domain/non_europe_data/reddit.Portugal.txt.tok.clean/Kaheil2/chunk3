  tl ; dr : thank you , 
  loved that one !, 
  you are the second person telling about school days , it goes straight to my `` to watch '' list . 
  thanks , 
  `` i 've seen enough hentai to see where this is going '', 
  tier 1 tech support . 
  while the cst is doing a `` time consuming task '' i browse the web . 
  also between calls . 
  400 gb watched ( after a big clean-up ) and 50gb to watch ( steins ; gate , k\u00e4mpfer and others ) . 
  all , with the exception of older episodes of bleach , in 720p/1080p . 
  note : the heaviest anime is currently fairy : tail . 
  i have all episodes and ova , it weighs about 40gb on it 's own . 
  follow by fma : brotherhood with 30gb . 
  i also have 20gb of doujinshi stacked up . 
  ( not counted in the 400 total ) . 
  before cleaning up the heaviest anime was , by far , naruto . 
  i had all 220 episodes + shippudden until ep .100 and half the manga . 
  deleted all the episodes when i stopped watching the show . 
  i 'm a few thousands kilometers away , but if you want some chatting i 'd be happy to talk with you . 
  i used to work for a large tech company and our directive when the cst 's computer was too old/outdated/incompatible ( unless linux ) / did not have one was to try to sell one . 
  considering that the equipment in question was well over 1000 $ the customers usually did not take it kindly . 
  example :, 
  - hi , i 'm an underpaid slave , how may i help you ? 
  - hello , i can not run your software . 
  - ok , do you have a computer ? 
  ( and a few other questions ) . 
  - [ answers ], 
  - i 'm sorry to inform you that your ( windows xp monocore celeron with 500mb ram ) can not run our software . 
  a good solution for that would be to consider purchasing a newer laptop . 
  would you like me to help you choose one ? 
  - f *** you !, 
  all you want is my money , i can not use [ service ] without your f *** in software and now you want more money . 
  get me your supervisor , now !, 
  some companies offer online tech support and repair . 
  that 's the best option , imo . 
  if you are not in a hurry you can also e-mail them ( worked for two of my asus routers ) . 
  came for the boobs , stayed for the mountains . 
  the one song that will always be stuck to my mind is [ kyoudai/brothers/brat ` ja ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc6fljrtgxy ) from fma . 
  beyond being one of the most beautiful music in anime , the lyrics are amazing too ( [ english version , not as pretty ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lltr04re20w&amp;feature=relmfu ) ) . 
  bonus : [ violin version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhn3z6erqma&amp;feature=related ) . 
  most likely the guys from apple . 
  they are big fans of minecraft ( and himym ) . 
  i 've got the strangest boner right now . 
   customer looks as if i have just slashed his tyres while ploughing his daughter, 
  this describes perfectly the reaction one customer had when i told him that `` no , the `` wi-fi password '' is not a code that 's issued by us ( manufacturer ) , you have to look for it on the router or contact your isp '' . 
  i believe the law state something very similar here , but in reality no company actually respect said law . 
  just as it is for working on christmas/holydays and week-ends . 
  for example , you are ( or were , before the new party came to power ) supposed to be paid 300 % to work on a holiday . 
  never met a single person who was actually paid outside public service . 
  do company in the u.s. really pay you or is it just `` yeah , you 'll see the money some day , trust me '' ? 
  i think your physics my be broken , better check with a physician . 
  ( lame , i know ), 
  `` through '' norway ? 
  i installed linux on 20laptops and locked the bios ( force boot to hdd ) . 
  that forced people to actually try it and they loved it . 
  at the end of the year i left the bios psd in the pc . 
  there was an article on reddit a few month ago . 
  the top 5 porn ( streaming ) sites are owned by the porn industry . 
  i guess ads must bring loads of money + teasing people by posting movie cuts . 
  look , for example , at xvideos ( nsfw ) , they make a lot of money like that . 
  i had a viral neumonia and a bacterian one + h1n1 . 
  doctors said i had two weeks , if lucky . 
  in case i 'd survive i 'd have to carry around oxygen . 
  6 month later i fully recovered . 
  my doctor was speechless . 
  portugues , literraly translate to `` the donkey ( animal ) eats a lot of hay , but more of a donkey ( idiot ) is he who gives it ( to him ) '', 
  french for `` with if ( s ) you could put paris in a bottle '' . 
  out of topic but ... he is kinda hot . 
  i am suddenly very ashmed of my country ... 
  then again , a dog can be much more fun than a drunk female with whom you wo n't have sex anyways . 
  also , some ladies like sweet boys that are nice to dogs ( there is a study about that ) . 
  i started crying when i saw this picture ;-), 
  til how to spell `` allons-y '' . 
  my mother tong is french ... 
  if you ever have kids , your gon na have a bad time . 
  talking about various ways to torture people or commit mass murder . 
  i often chat about that with a good friend , tends to freak out bystanders . 
  unfortunatly this is not enough material to form an opinion . 
  would you care to provide more `` reaserch '' material ? 
  for science , of course !, 
  on a related note : this men is one of my idols ( in the true scence of the word ) . 
  in my opinion what if scenario help you take a lot out of your mind and prepare you for bad situations . 
  an upboat to you !, 
  sis ( the graphics card manufactureur ) . 
  to this day i have not been able to use a laptop i got ( granted , for free ) because of the lack of drivers . 
  the guy on the left is prettier than edward in the movie . 
  same goes for the lady . 
  mind you , i 've seen this happen ... sort of . 
  a few years ago , i decided to organize a lan-party , invited every `` friends '' ( people i knew , pretty much ) . 
  one girl , the only actual friend , showed up with soda and a headset ( got her a spare computer ) . 
  she was a lesbian , however . 
  fun times , fun times ... 
  omelette du fromage = omelette of the cheese . 
  in the french version they corrected it . 
  how about this , if you 're caught speeding 6 times , they will take your car and block it so that it wo n't go over 30mph ( 50km ) . 
  i got several calls with related issues with their kids ' ithing . 
  once i even got a call from the kid himself about how to hide pictures : told him about truecrypt . 
  that 's the sound of the internet . 
  this looks somewhat like a gauss cannon . 
  nice diy nevertheless .
