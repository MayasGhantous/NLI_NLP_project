  thank you very much . 
  if you do n't mind could you consider adding any country restrictions or special requirements these websites may have . 
  to be fair that ... thing ... was made to carry a space shuttle . 
  not the measly air plane parts those capitalist pigs move around in their puny planes . 
  you could try spooling the aero engine before launch , staying put with the breaks on the wheels . 
  you might want to remove a tiny amount of fuel from the tank so that you are dry by the time you reach the island . 
  anyway , the execution is plenty clever already . 
  very kerbalesque too . 
  good luck and jeb speed !, 
  to be honest i do n't know how much i would like to see top gear on netflix . 
  most of the world population does n't have access to it . 
  although they could always sell the rights to local channels/providers , in which case i 'm 100 % on board . 
  provided they do n't get a 3 year delay * cough * discovery iberia * cough * . 
  or worst , a dub !, 
  chibi-nazi is best nazi . 
  til , thank you . 
  i tried the game on my hd4870 . 
  it ran ... barely . 
  i then made a small upgrade to a 960 . 
  it now runs smoothly . 
  i upgraded from a tired hd4870 to a 960 . 
  7 years of age difference . 
  i feel like a born again ... err ... gabian ? 
  masterracian ? 
  not-a-dirty-peasent - ... ian ? 
  `` the uploader has not made this video available in your country . '', 
  well , here is a message i see far too often . 
  [ alternate link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnanjf2530o ) for those in the same situation . 
  was putin the head of the kgb/fsb or a high ranking officer ? 
  sources often disagree on that and my inability to understand russian does n't help . 
  i 've owned/worked on several amd gpu . 
  all had some degree of drivers issues on linux . 
  i have n't had any dealings with the rxxx series though . 
  preaching to the quire . 
  besides televisions everyone besides me uses sub-1080p screens ( tablets , phones , laptops , etc ) . 
  the closest best buy is probably around 6000-8000km from where i live so that may not be the case . 
  also , with 23 % sales tax and an average income of ~ 600 $ many people may shy away from sinking to much money into a monitor . 
  but then again they do buy iphone 4s and laptops , so this is n't the only reason .

   [ scene in question ] ( http://a.pomf.se/zhchuf.webm ), 
  my vintage hd4870 was working `` just fine '' until three weeks ago . 
  it could even run tf2@*many*\u00a9fps!, 
  i was finally lucky enough to be able to afford an upgrade , however , to a 960 . 
  day/night difference . 
  anyway , my point is , do not fall to despair brother , for better gpu come to those who wait ( or at least i wish you that much ) . 
  well , here is a flag i had n't seen in a while . 
  interesting to see it in the wild . 
  i wonder what other derelict flags one may find around . 
  i still have stuff `` fabriqu\u00e9 en r.f.a. '', 
  ( made in germany - before the fall of the wall ) so i imagine many are still around . 
   cientist ... or engineer ... 
  i 'm so conflicted !, 
  engineers are simply scientist that learned how to use duktape . 
  as an engineer i invite you to insert the mk1 pod into your anatomy . 
  but seriously , i have a lot of respect for scientist , specially those in theoretical research . 
  their contribution is far less obvious and often overlooked but without them i could n't do any of what i do . 
  the quite superheroes of science !, 
  and this is how ww1 started . 
  it would n't look out of place in japan . 
  keep them coming . 
  my secondary pc , that i lend to guests , has a p4@3.2ghz ( monocore ) , an 80gb hdd and an ati hd4870 . 
  the bottleneck is real . 
  the hdd is still configured with the old ide master/slave and the disk reader is hooked via a flat ide cable . 
  my gaming machine has a q6600@3.2ghz, 12gb of 1066ddr3 , a lot of storage , raids , an ssd and a gtx 960 . 
  inside a full tower case with a 700w psu . 
  the bottleneck is real too . 
  to be fair if you guys were n't doing it we 'd do it to ourselves . 
  at least you save us the trouble . 
  it would be a pain in the ass to draw , but by thor is it gorgeous !, 
  i love the colours , the style and everything . 
  i would n't have it as a military or political flag though . 
  anyway , i hope this piece becomes a flag . 
  i think it would specially great on white canvas . 
  i raise you 600 ( 599 ) $ , or one month of average wage . 
  plus shipping . 
  ( probably less than 500 # however , but not when comparing purchase power ) . 
  one of the ugliest ( imo ) flags i 'm aware of . 
  the region it represents , however , is pretty cool ( albeit cold and rainy ) . 
  did you do it yourself or did your ~ ~ slaves ~ ~ workers decide to `` funnel public resources into civil engineering '' ? 
   he is just a swordsman, 
  i do n't know if this is cannon but i 've often read ( and it does make sense ) that the ebony warrior is the avatar of [ ebonarm ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/lore:ebonarm ) . 
  besides the name the fact that he is a redguard and boasts a physique beyond man or mer adds to the credibility . 
  however i ca n't fathom why he would want to go to sovengarde or why he would n't interfere in conflicts happening at the time . 
   10 to adjust for faceplant, 
  this is the kerbalesque way to describe landing i 've seen so far . 
  aside from `` going up in flames , exploding , burning , crashing , exploding again , fragmenting , burning again , rolling down a hill , exploding and planting a flag '', 
  i personally find that mining has made eve ~ ~ easier ~ ~ less atrocious . 
  much more so than anything else . 
  just strap some death ray to it and shoot it up . 
  ( they actually did that . 
  it was awesome , but a failure ) . 
  i was ( role ) playing as england on archipelago . 
  as such i was using my considerable naval might to be a dick to everyone . 
  but because i was militarily stronger than any of the other 7civ nobody dared declare war nor was i in a pillaging mood . 
  then , suddenly , the other 7 civ declared war against me . 
  i lose all trade routes , i struggle to regroup and i 'm hemoraging gold . 
  i fight off a few wave but at best i 'll loose and at worst i 'll be wiped out . 
  and then , suddenly , one by one , all the civ sue for peace and offer me cities , riches and gold . 
  i profited from the war !,
