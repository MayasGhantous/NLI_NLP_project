  anyway , nice to know some made it across the pond , enjoy it as much as you can . 
  screw you op , because of you i just waisted over an hour reading about weird and awesome cars from the soviet union . 
  please do n't ever submit interesting and quality link like that again !, 
  my father was in training right before the end of the war , escaping by a few weeks , couple month tops . 
  i have other relatives ( i never met ) that died in that war . 
  i truly hits home when you hear stories of soldier blowing themselves up with grenades rather than go back to the front . 
  it 's far more poignant than the ( equally horrifying ) stories of old , from greece and rome . 
  oh you do n't know the half of it . 
  walking through lisbon is quite something when you know the history . 
  a city a the heart of the world , from where the once vast and immensely powerful empire ruled the wave , now but a memento to the vast glory of this nearly millennial nation . 
  you still have structure from roman time , some ( few ) still in use . 
  for americans it 's quite astonishing to realise that the same toilet has been in use over 2000 years . 
  it 's even more flagrant because of how little the centre changed , between protectionist policies ( in terms of historic structure ) and the everlasting economic ... limitations ... another european towns with similar characteristics , albeit not as striking imo , would be amsterdam . 
  really worth to see during the day ( and ... err ... `` enjoy '' during the night ) . 
  the [ first ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_opium_war ) and [ second ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_opium_war ) opium wars . 
  not often mentioned but quite interesting . 
  those wars , opposing the mercantile interest of the uk and the second french empire against the qing 's will to maintain a country out of anarchy and stay in power , ended-up paving the way for the prc , the republic of china and the current situation . 
  it 's a very good example of imperialism and gunboat `` diplomacy '' . 
  the battles themselves are n't thrilling but those wars certainly help explain how china got where it is today . 
  and as a bonus all parties were `` evil '' . 
  as a ~ ~ frog ~ ~ french speaking swiss , can confirm . 
  we also inherited the racism from ... err ... let 's not go there . 
  me too , using a play on words with the modern ( but `` wrong '' ) meaning of nimord and that of the mythical hunter . 
  and this is why you do n't hire escher to design your bus stops . 
  what 's next , dali to redesign big ben ? 
  unlikely , thorium would n't be optimal for a highly mobile fission power source . 
  it boils down to the characteristics of the material , which i do n't find all that interesting . 
  however it would be perfectly possible to build an effective nuclear reactor that could be thrown around `` safely '' ( safety is really subjective here ) . 
  stark trek federation ? 
  which one are you referring to ? 
  the first civ to discover it gets +2 happiness and +35 fps . 
  working it gives +4 science and +1 dust induced asthma . 
  black hole that small and light could n't exist for long , they 'd evaporate in a. . . catastrophic manner . 
  now for why this is happening in kerbal ... err ... bob did it ! ... 
  ahh , good point . 
  i should have said that at the beginning . 
  oh , i should go there !, 
  this looks like a fun place to visit during the afternoon . 
  gta5 ran with no graphical issue at 1080p and ~ ~ console ~ ~ potato graphics on my hd4870 . 
  quite a feat from the old card . 
  saddly the game itself was n't really all that interesting for me and i barely finished the campaign and did n't went back for it . 
  it 's objectively a good game , just not the game for me . 
  gta4 ( borrowed ) was buggy as hell and barely playable though . 
  fortunately i did n't pay for it and it worked fine on the pc of whom i borrowed it . 
  most people in the west do n't realise how much the average japanese hates war . 
  it came to me as a surprise to see this law pass , although the current administration has been ... slightly more militaristic than most . 
  no , you do n't understand . 
  because console do n't allow ~ ~ players ~ ~ peasants to use excessively accurate mousses you have to think ahead of time where you 'll want to aim due to how ~ ~ slow ~ ~ cinematic the game is . 
  this adds a layer of strategy to the ~ ~ fps ~ ~ tps that pc games such as tf2 or killing floor do n't have . 
  as someone who 's been gaming on pc for the past 20y due to budget constraints i think this guy is missing the point . 
  pc gaming can be much cheaper than potato gaming . 
  or far more expensive . 
  it does n't matter . 
  i still often play xonotic ( quake ) and hedgewars ( worms ) in lan , because half the pc ca n't even handle tf2 . 
  and it 's still mighty fun . 
  fuck you if you think you need 4k for fun . 
  the community balance patch prevents you from razing a flipped city . 
  found this out the hard way when playing tall with poortugal . 
  the community balance patch prevents you from razing flipped cities . 
  but regrettably it also makes it hard to get rid of them as , for some reason , other nations will often refuse to accept your cities , even as a gift . 
   will i have any issues with mods due to running linux ? 
  no , most mods will run better on linux , provided you use the x64 version . 
  some graphical mods may not run as well , however , mostly due to poor drivers . 
  if you have an intel or nvidia card you should be fine . 
  amd might have some issues ( speaking only from personal experience ) . 
   what is a good version of linux to run for ksp ? 
  any flavour with recent version of the software and decent graphical support . 
  examples : ubuntu 14.04 and variants for a simpler installation , arch linux for ultimate customization ( but labour intensive - not recommended to noobs ) . 
   is it possible to transfer my save over ? 
  within the limits of mods and versions , yes . 
  it 's exactly the same as transferring from windows to windows . 
  yes , very much so . 
  specially with mods . 
  the eli5 boils down to amount of ram available for the game . 
  for 1.0.4 i use three main space plane mods . 
  [ quiztech aero pack ] ( https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/612/quiztech%20aero%20pack ) , [ opt space plane ] ( https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/340/opt%20space%20plane%20parts ) ( does not have iva yet ) and [ adjustable landing gear ] ( https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/321/adjustable%20landing%20gear ) . 
  often recommended are also [ bahamuto dynamics ( parts pack ) ] ( https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/101/bahamuto%20dynamics%20%28parts%20pack%29 ) , [ realchute ] ( https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/71/realchute%20parachute%20systems ) and [ rasterprop ] ( https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/734/rasterpropmonitor ) ( fps intensive ) . 
  5 ' 000 , presumably sweaty , people will get naked together in public to protest homosexuality ... am i the only one to see this as ironic ? 
  with it you can make awesome ssto capable of taking of from the runway with a heavy payload , bring that payload to laythe , land , drop the load , take off and get back to the ksc runway . 
  all in a single stage , with experiments aboard , redundancy and crew . 
  and without refueling . 
  but it makes the an-225 look positively tiny ... and eats fps like they are a free buffet . 
  and uses a `` few '' gigabytes of ram . 
  and takes about as long to turn around as does kerbin . 
  you should play civ5 . 
  you 'd get along great with ghandi . 
  mars of destruction . 
  gainax ( not very original , i know ) . 
  the salt !, 
  i 've started playing with it recently , it 's a very cool mechanic . 
  made my little portugal into a powerhouse on large island map . 
  lfs is for the mentally deranged ! ... 
  or the people curious enough and willing enough to learn what makes linux tic . 
  more seriously , it 's a neet project but goes much beyond my knowledge and even will to learn . 
  i 'm glad it exists but arch is as far as i 'll go . 
  `` the '' folder ? 
  did any of the scientist or officer involved ever left the project for moral reasons ? 
  i would imagine that some ethical concerns were raised , would those doubting the humanity of the project ever punished ? 
  i ca n't imagine the us being thrilled at the idea of letting go someone with so much knowledge on such a project . 
  there should be a `` only 999.99 $ free castle dlc '' sign a the bridge , with the stock game featuring all that gorgeous water around , with two free quests ( with the game you bought ) .
