  me : hi , welcome to techsupport , how can i help you buy ? 
  customer ( with a strong `` gangsta/arabic '' accent ) : hi , i just bought this [ device ] ( minimum 600 $ new ) from someone/second hand store/some other story . 
  i 'd like to know how much warranty is has ( and get other infos ) . 
  me : of course , can i have the serial number and your name please ( we started , purposefully , not asking the e-mail at this stage . 
  cst : 1234567890 and my name is [ generic french name ] . 
  me : thank you , can i have your mail please ? 
  it 's important that it is a working mail , as the information will be sent via mail . 
  cst : ahh ... err ... my mail is ... mohammedalidu80@example.fr, 
  you can figure out the rest of the talk easily . 
  after that happened to me several times , i asked what these calls were about and was told they were coming from 2/3 generation immigrants , which were often legally french , but lived in ghetto areas and grew-up in a mix of arabic culture and ghetto culture . 
  that took me a bit by shock , as all my dealings in life with muslim or arabic people had went extremely well . 
  they were always nice , polite , thought me a lot about their beliefs and shared a lot . 
  they have always been a culture i held dear . 
  my point is : the issue is not with the arabs or arabic culture , but rather the way they were treated and how they behaved initially . 
  since neither camp made a real move toward the other , things got really messy . 
  tl ; dr : read n3onfx post, 
  that i ca n't stand writing in my mother tongue . 
  most people i 've talked to about that say it 's childish and i should stop behaving like a kid and stop using english for everything . 
  none of these people can write in my mother tongue , those who are fluent in both it and english understand , 
  portugal . 
  that is all . 
  in romandie , which has a culture that is very similar to the french , i grew up being beaten-up by kids for being difference , talked down by teacher for asking `` complex '' questions ( a science teacher that does n't know what plasma is should n't be a science teacher ) and ignored by society in general . 
  i barely made it out of school and they tried to sent me to `` special people 's school '' to stop having to deal with me . 
  when i got here , on the first day of school , every single person was nice , open , friendly . 
  nobody judged anyone else based on anything but their actions . 
  when i got home from school that day i cried for hours of how happy i was . 
  i have met hundred of people here , never did i encounter a person that was genuinely racist or that was against my religious beliefs ( or rather , lack of thereof ) . 
  as long as you are not openly gay/bi , you will be fine here ( really , that 's the only exception and marriage is legal here ! ) . 
  find me a country were a foreigner , that can barely make out a sentence and is more social awkward than a herd of penguins , is welcomed like you were a brother they had not seen in years . 
  ps : i 've seen this happen several times too , ones with an american girl , twice with ukrainian folks and once with pretty moldavian lady . 
  so it 's not just me . 
   as we say in argentina : '' el que sabe , sabe , y el que no , es jefe '' . 
  translates to : the one that knows his stuff , knows his stuff , the one that does n't , is boss . 
  exact same idiom , but this time in continental portuguese . 
  even half-way across the globe , shitty bosses are shitty , 
  french . 
  i actually failed to enter a science curriculum ( as opposed to , say , a linguistics one ) because i failed the spelling exam ( 0/20 ) . 
  good thing the actual science grade did not count , would have been ridiculous otherwise . 
  that aside , writing correctly in french is mighty hard and i 've always had pretty dramatic spelling issues . 
  after 17 years of trying ( and 3 years after moving to another country and learning two new languages ) , i ended up giving up on spelling french and simply use english/local language for everything . 
  french is so hard to spell , imo , that i manage to do less spelling mistakes in every foreign language i speak ( or butcher :p ) . 
  i 've never been to the u.s. unfortunately , but many ( most ? ), 
  of the people i used to deal with on a day-to-day basis were from there and they were really welcoming . 
  the crazies are crazy ( like everywhere ) and there are lines not to cross ( never , ever , talk about religion . 
  never , ever , mention anything positive about nazism/communism . 
  never had any issue as long as i followed those two rules ) . 
  i also love how americans are critical of their own country . 
  for all their defaults , the american people are very pleasant to deal with , 
  note : i am talking about your `` average '' american . 
  not a geek , a redditor or an atheist , etc. 
  i would never apply those rules on reddit , for example . 
  thank you , 
  i had a french teacher who used to say , half-jokingly , that there are more exception than rules in french . 
  even basic sentences such as `` i am going to school '' can be tough to learn . 
  `` je vais \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole '' i = je , going = aller * 1 \u00e0 * 2 , l' * 3 = the , school = \u00e9cole . 
  1 : the verb `` aller '' ( to go ) is irregular , so instead of being `` je alle '' ( which would be the rule ) it 's `` je vais '' . 
  2 : '' \u00e0 '' translate to `` to '' ( as in going to ) . 
  however , `` a '' means `` to have '' , so every time you write a sentence you have to check whether to put ( or not ) an accent . 
  3 : you ca n't have a word without either `` the '' or `` a '' ( un/une/des or le/la/les or aux ) . 
  now , '' \u00e9cole '' is a feminine word so it should been `` la \u00e9cole '' , but because it 's starts with a vowel , that means you compress the `` la '' to `` l' '' , which in turn is neutral ( because fuck logic , that 's why ! ) . 
  oh , in case your were talking about schools , '' \u00e0 '' and `` le/la/les '' transform into a single word `` aux '' . 
  which , obviously , reads like `` oh '' in english ... or in french , for that matter . 
  4 : and just to ease things up even more , the `` es '' in `` des/les '' reads like the '' \u00e9 '' in '' \u00e9cole '' but the `` es '' in '' \u00e9coles '' ( schools ) is silent . 
  pretty much all or `` s '' or `` t '' at the end of a word is silent in french . 
  a bit bias , but probably one of the best enumerations i 've read . 
  thank you sir ( or miss ) . 
  one question though :, 
   we want lower taxes so we have more money in our pockets . 
  not out of greed , but out of personal accountability . 
  yes , the government needs some for our roads , and police and all that jazz . 
  but after a while , our money needs to be spent on what we want it spent on . 
  in this situation would the state have it 's own workforce for building roads or would they rather open-up a contest to see who , from the private sector , has the best project ? 
   first off , your groupings do n't exactly make sense , neo nazis and the american republican party are n't exactly on the same side . 
  i did not mean to group them at all . 
  they are the only right wings party i ever dealt with in my life , that is all . 
  the udc whilst growing up in switzerland , the republicans because america and the internet and psd because i now live in the lovely country of portugal . 
   as far as not being representative , if you live in a representative democracy , then they are . 
  the only way they could not be is if there is fraud . 
  you may only hang around liberals , and read liberal news , so that can skew your opinion . 
  that might be a misuse of the word from my part . 
  by `` represent '' i meant `` to portray the views of most right-wing voters '' . 
  i only know the inner workings of the politics of only half a dozen countries , which does not portray , by any stretch of the imagination , the views of the `` righties '' ( is that a thing ? ), 
  of the blue marble we sit on . 
  the sound old , crappy , crt monitors make !, 
  it was infernal in my teenage years as i was the only person under 40 in the house and , hence , the only person hearing it . 
  the t.v. 
  was on 10-14hours per day and when i asked to turn it off every one yelled ... and then went back to reading . 
  i later discovered that they though i was inventing this only because i was a `` green sissy '' ( cares `` too much '' about the environment ) . 
  it 's been quite awhile since i 've posted here and , damn you , i did quite a bit of reading about guns . 
  that lead me to change my opinion a little ( quite a bit actually ) . 
  the truth is , i dig guns and swords . 
  not so much because of their `` murder '' ability , but by the beauty of their design and engineering . 
  and , damn you again , i actually now think that , yes , civilians should be allowed to own guns . 
  however , i maintain my point that `` crazy '' joe from the corner should not have access to a gun . 
  gun ownership should hence be considered a hobby/sport with strict rules and regulation . 
  as far as i know , in the u.s. anyone of age who has n't done anything wrong in the eyes of the law can have a gun . 
  why not simply make `` everyone '' ( hippies and crazies aside ) and have a process to gun ownership similar to a bike driving license in europe . 
  for starter , a person must be of a certain age ( let 's say 21 ) and can apply to get a license . 
  he will have to undergo basic exams , such as physical ability to hold and control a gun ( being able to lift the gun , pretty much ) , eyesight test ( with a very high threshold , pretty much only banning blind people ) , mental check and , most important imo , a day of `` gun rules '' training and a day of first aid training . 
  if all checks out , a few weeks later , you get the green light to buy a very small calibre , such as .22 .
