  unfortunately it wo n't be possible for them to join this specific one as it wo n't be held in english ( i prefer to hold the campaign in the native language of the players ) . 
  however i may ( possibly , not likely ) hold a separate campaign for / r/history later in time . 
  i make no promises as i have a lot to do as is studying . 
  thank you again for all your help !, 
  on the one hand i would assume that there would be a mix of glee ( revenge for versailles , glory to the nation , etc ) and relief ( most german knew at least someone engaged in the armed forces ) . 
  but on the other hand they probably would realise that they had just declare war on a large portion of the world , including the british . 
  they also invaded a nation of europe again , not some `` back water lawless land of africa '' . 
  are there any documents from that time , such as diaries or correspondence , of average german citizen ? 
  how did they see the future ? 
  did they assume a peace treaty would be signed and things would go `` back to normal '' for the reich ? 
  i 'm going to be moving in about three month to a large property . 
  it has a big garden and two houses . 
  both of them very old . 
  currently only the bottom one is inhabited . 
  it has dsl and cable , internet coming from the dsl line . 
  it goes into a modem/router combo that comes `` curtsey '' of the isp . 
  my goal would be to have wired internet ( 1gbs , cat6 ) in both houses and wireless for the property ( does n't need to be very fast ) . 
  the place is isolated , so there are no interference . 
  i have los between both houses . 
  the tallest one is roughly 15m tall , with access to the roof at the 10m and 15m marks . 
  my goal would be to have the most discreet , least invasive method of spreading those sweet data packs around . 
  ideally for a budget bellow 400 $ / 500 $ . 
  i was thinking of either using the dsl line and have two modems , one in each house ( not sure if the isp would authorise this ) or using a point to point wireless bridge connected to a switch . 
  that would take care of the houses . 
  for the rest of the terrain a beefy antenna stuck atop the tallest house would do the work . 
  do you have any advice ? 
  i do have some rudimentary networking knowledge but am by no means an expert on it . 
  i 'm currently on the second semester of ( contemporary ) european history and will have to present and defend a paper for this course . 
  i plan on doing an analysis of a biography of one of the prominent figure of the space/arms race , ideally a person who 's neither american nor russian by birth . 
  but given the vast array of biographies on von braun alone ( not to mention others of his no less brilliant contemporary ) i 'm thoroughly lost as to whom to chose and which book to read . 
  and as much as i wish i could read them all , i regrettably have deadlines to contend with . 
  so you ( yes : you ! ), 
  who has already finished their degree in modern/contemporary european history : what do you recommend . 
  should i go for the ukrainians or is there not enough translations of it ? 
  should i have chosen a course with better employment perspectives ? 
  thank you any help you can provide !, 
  my good old p5q3 motherboard is finally on her deathbed , after almost 25 ' 000hours of use . 
  but that 's also a great time for an upgrade !, 
  let me know what you think :, 
  ** current build ** :, 
  cpu : q6600, 
  mobo : p5q3, 
  ram : 12gb of 1066ddr3, 
  gpu : gtx960, 
  psu : gs700, 
  storage : 64gb samsung ssd + wdblack 1.5 tb raid5, 
  case : cm full tower case ( e-atx ), 
  ** planed upgrade ** :, 
  cpu : i5 7400 ( 200 $ ), 
  mobo : msi b250 pc mate ( 105 $ ), 
  ** usage ** : 1080p gaming and general computing . 
  i run linux , in case that matters . 
  ** notes : ** i 'm buying the parts in portugal . 
  i 've been reading quite a bit on contemporary european history lately and a word that 's come-up several time in regards to the german is `` kriegsgl\u00fcck '' . 
  having a basic understand of german ( and how to google ) i figured it means `` luck of war '' or `` fate of war '' . 
  but this feels quite lacklustre . 
  what was the significance of this word to the beleaguered german of the third reich ? 
  it seemed to me that it meant far more than just a literal translation , but not being fluent ( at all ) in * deutsch * i fail to grasp it 's proper intent . 
  any clarification you could provide would be of great help !, 
  hey !, 
  after living in the red ntunnel for about five month i started getting rather dismayed by the chaos of it all . 
  so i thought an inventory would be in order . 
  as such i 've placed signs in front of tunnel that were breaking rules , ugly , seemed inactive or all of those ( there are some champions out there ) . 
  i 'll wait for roughly one week ( counting from 17/04/03 ) . 
  the tunnels for which no answer of any kind ( including removing the sign , writing an answer on it , answering here or ingame ) will go into a list of `` abandoned tunnel '' ( probably a google doc ) . 
  i 'll then put the list-up on the subreddit and let the mods handle it . 
  if this works i would n't mind doing it for other tunnels and even `` repair '' the abandoned shafts . 
  after doing quite a bit of research on the aggregate program and mittelwerk there is one recurring factoid . 
  that von braun 's rocket are , supposedly , the only ( mass-produced ) weapon that was fired in anger to have killed more in it 's construction than military usage . 
  despite going through several books on war economics i could n't find anything contradicting this . 
  but history being so vast , and humans being so war-happy , i was wondering on the veracity of this claim . 
  so , is it true ? 
  * spoken by mankind 's last emperor before his public execution at the hand of revolutionaries *, 
  my sons , you stand today at the crossroads of your destiny . 
  but as you stare down the great abyss , your eyes filled with dreams , i beseech all of you not to forget : we are a pitiful joke of a specie . 
  we crawled out of the mud ; ridiculous soft-skinned monkeys . 
  we are weak , tribal and violent . 
  we act with no forethought and are dumbfounded by the consequences of our own acts . 
  and yet , my children , when you stand together you are magnificent . 
  you crawled out of the dirt and built cities of marble . 
  you conquered this earth and made it yours to rule . 
  and now you stand to do the same to other worlds . 
  you have cast away your delusional pantheons to walk as gods amongst the heavens . 
  i am so proud of you . 
  today my passing will not be a patricide , but rather the fate providence holds for me . 
  my children , my glorious , glorious children . 
  i beseech all of you , please heed my last words : remember what you are ... what we all are . 
  remember how weak , how tiny , how meaningless we all are . 
  stand together and the universe itself will bow to your whims . 
  but if you fight amongst yourselves , if you bicker , scheme , lie , deceive and cheat then , my beautiful , you will die a slow and agonising death . 
  go forth , be grand , claim your birthright . 
  i shall pray to you that you 'll forevermore sit atop the heavens . 
  i 've been wanting to play cities skylines for a long time , but until this wednesday i had an old q6600 that could n't handle cities of  30 ' 000 inhabitants , rendering the game somewhat uninteresting quickly . 
  however after upgrading to a ryzen 5 1600 this problem subsists . 
  i saw a massive speed boost on the early-game phase , as well as a massive fps and general performance boost . 
  however upon reaching roughly 25 ' 000 inhabitants the time slows down to `` normal/default '' speed even when i try to accelerate and at 30 ' 000 it 's unplayable . 
  i have no mods installed but have after-dark and snowfall . 
  despite doing some research here , on steam and google nothing came-up that seemed to solve this problem . 
  any idea what might cause it , how to mitigate or even solve it ? 
  is this a common issue ?
