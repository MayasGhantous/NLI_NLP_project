  i would also advice anyone to contact their local japanese embassy ( last time i talked to them their were very nice and helpful ) . 
  thanks for the answer ( an `` upvote '' for you , for what it 's worth ) . 
  now , i might have used a term a bit wrongfully . 
  by crusader i did not mean `` warrior '' or `` conqueror '' but rather one who would dedicate one 's life to the cause of his church and spreading of it 's beliefs . 
  obama is a leader responsible for war ( s ) , but as far as i know `` his '' war ( s ) were n't motivated by personal religious beliefs but by several other factors ( economical interests coming in first ) . 
  for the b1 , check [ common european framework of reference for languages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_european_framework_of_reference_for_languages ), 
  regarding reading/writing skills of japanese , they are indeed that of a native five years old . 
  that was never an issue for communicating with japanese ( i just asked them polity to use hiragana and katakana only ) . 
  i did check and one must write to them in japanese , so it is indeed out of the question . 
  note : ~ 1500 yen ( 15 $ ) per hour is twice as much what i made for the same job here , despite the salary being the same ( there was a middle man ( outsourcing ) taking 50 % of my income though ) . 
  thank you . 
  i 've checked ( thanks wikipedia ! ), 
  and i would indeed fit in the n2 category quite well . 
  however , writing a resum\u00e9 in proper japanese is quite beyond my skill so i gave up on that idea . 
  if she is only level 85 i understand their point . 
  i mean , mists of pandaria has been out for ages , she should be 90 by now . 
  first off , let me say outright that i agree with most ( if not all ) of your points . 
  i particularly love this part :, 
   the first , / r/communism , i left because of a particular quote i read in srs , and i wo n't be able to tell you where or who said it because it was so long ago . 
   `` a structure based on centuries of history can not be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite . '', 
   now i 've never liked anarchism , but that 's not important right now . 
  what is important is this quote always stuck with me . 
  and it 's consistently repeated after `` successful '' revolutions . 
  russification and mass deportation in the soviet union , or the `` flower vase '' and selective abortions in the prc . 
  both of these are racist or sexist in presumably leftist political systems . 
  that being said , there is one thing about / r/communism that struck me . 
  they are , as far as i can tell , nice , kind , polite and very cultured people . 
  they seem to have built a lot of knowledge by themselves and can claim to be , in my opinion , one of the most respectable online community when it comes to politics . 
  but there is an underlying hatred , similar in nature to the brazier than fuels the mind of anarchists . 
  but where anarchists ( as in the original meaning of the word ) refuse order and want chaos , the folks at / r/communism have a reasonable and well constructed solution . 
  my biggest problem with them is their method ( s ) . 
  hide as they might , nearly all communists have an unholy amount of anger and sadness in their eyes . 
  i can only speak for myself , but the reason i became radical ( or at least what society perceives as radical ) in my ideas is because i was kicked had first in the mud since i was three years old . 
  i was not kicked by another person 's foot , i was crushed by an entire society of greed that did not want of me . 
  and regardless of how much i study , how much i meditate , practise arts of peace and relaxation , how much i discuss and review my idea , i will never truly be free of the hatred that has grown into me . 
  but i know one think for sure : regardless of how much good you think you will be doing to the world , regardless of how many lives you think you are saving , if the change you offer is based on hatred and anger rather than compassion , then your goal is set to fail . 
  note : i often see the same problem with some feminist , who are fuelled more by hatred of men that wish for equality . 
  whilst they represent a tiny minority of feminists , let alone women , they are often ( and unfortunately ) the ones given most attention . 
  was i the only one who had no idea who bob the builder was before checking wikipedia after reading this post ? 
  yesterday , i read on '' [ danstonchat ] ( http://danstonchat.com/ ) '' the ( short ) story of someone who used a macbook air as a mousepad for over a month before realizing his mistake ( the laptop was given to him as a present , but it was second hand and as far as i know did not come with anything but the device ) . 
  this might not seem like alot compared to many things posted here , but there are two things that marked me :, 
  1 ) when i got into quantum physics at 7 my parents took me to [ cern ] ( http://public.web.cern.ch/public/ ) and [ epfl ] ( http://www.epfl.ch/ ) and i got many classes alongside university students . 
  it was really awesome , 
  2 ) around 15 i started getting bored of `` just '' playing games on the computer and got really into computing . 
  never once did my mother put any time restriction on how long i could spend on the computer as long as i was working ( i 'd often drop all school related work to read wikipedia and she was `` fine '' with that ) . 
  where did you buy your soviet flag ? 
  actually , where do you guys buy all your flags ? 
  ok , thanks , 
  somethings that they did not mention in the article but strike me as major issues :, 
  many ( most , in europe ) people do not own their house , so installing this device is out of the question . 
  second thing is , a regular toilet will set you back 35-100 $ plus 30 $ to install it . 
  a japanese toilet will set you back a month worth of income . 
  where it not for these issues , i 'd see no reason to stop everyone from `` upgrading '' . 
  i 'm certain it had a robot in it , somewhere ... 
  the one thing that annoys me is how `` weak '' many male characters are . 
  i am sure many of us have watch anime where half the plot could have been solved by having the male character `` manning it up '' and facing his emotions . 
  may the one person whom never wished to slap shinji ( nge ) in the face through the first downvote !, 
  when buying that anime , it should come with a couple of free therapy sessions . 
  a fairly unknow anime , [ aoi bungaku ] ( http://myanimelist.net/anime/7193/aoi_bungaku_series ) is said to be very dark and depressing . 
  have n't watch it yet though . 
  found out about it on this [ podcast ] ( http://www.nowatch.net/category/nowatch-net/nowatch-tv-nowatch-net/bakast/ ) ( it 's in french though ) . 
  i actually like shinji , but he has the talent to piss me off beyond that of any other characters . 
  i also love asuna and kiriito in sao , because they actually [ sao spoiler ] ( / s `` get together '' ) which is rare in most anime . 
  smoking . 
  also ,, 
  odd ... works just fine for me . 
  you might need to disable adp or other extension of the sort on that page . 
  given the nature of the theme of this subreddit and the title ( and the fact that this is , in fact , the internet ) i was expecting something ... err ... `` different '' . 
  most european nations offer at least healthcare and education . 
  in northern europe ( denmark and above ) you will often find good social security , smaller social inequality and , in some case , some form of social housing for people who ca n't afford private propriety . 
  now , what is relevant about that is that these nations , in particular sweden , has been going in the direction of socialism and despite not being anywhere near the almost dreamlike society a true communist state would bring it ( sweden ) has achieved pretty much the better living standard in the world . 
  i usually through sweden in the face of anyone saying that socialism ca n't work . 
  well , guess what , it can and it is working . 
  arguing for communism is a bit harder with some people , but more open-minded ( and rational ) folks tend to listen to mathematical argument quite well ( pull-up the living standard of the urss a few years before it 's fall ( and stress that part ) and now . 
  now stress the fact that even though the country might have seen an increase in total wealth , that wealth is being put into the hands of the few whilst the rest crawl through the mud ) . 
  nothing fancy , just a classic unity running on ubuntu 12.04 . 
  same , but with an active/animated wallpaper . 
  i 'd rephrase that :, 
  `` nope . 
  we 're only interested in 2-d [ everything ] . '', 
  i love yaoi and i 'm sure some cree ... hum ... 
  i mean , original folks ... are really into tentacle rape . 
  also , many fetishes i do n't know off . 
  am i the only one who had never heard of any of these companies ? 
  that case is just lovely . 
  i do n't think it 's in the best ( aesthetically ) possible place though . 
  in my case it was the cold . 
  when houses are designed ( from the ground-up ) to let as much airflow pass through and have no heating and/or isolation , living near the sea in the cold ( albeit short ) winter is a nightmare . 
  it often is hotter outside than inside during the day . 
  i would try various things , but to start i would impose one rule : it can not be in the centre . 
  you could try moving it to the right or left of the top shelf and see how it fairs . 
  if you do n't like it , try putting it on the stand we see on the left of the picture ( provided it 's free ) . 
  if you are willing to do a bit more work , you can always make a diy stand or rack for it . 
  of course , all is dependent on space . 
  i solved the space issue a year ago with this : http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/s99861340/ ( it was quite cheaper in europe though , when i bought it . 
  payed 80 $ at the time , when the dollar was about equal to the euro ) . 
  in the summer ( understand : 8 months per year ) it 's awesome . 
  in the two month in between it 's ok . 
  but , during winter , with temperature dropping under 10 degrees celsius and moisture around 80 % you start to really suffer . 
  picture taking a shower every morning when the ( stone ) bathroom is at 5 degrees .
