  granted , there are heating appliances , but they are gas burners , meaning that are very good at heating a small area ( such as a room ) but really terrible at heating an entire house . 
  you also have the problem of schools or old ( generally public ) offices that have strong airflow ( lower moisture , but colder air ) without any heating ( you ca n't have gas heating in a school and electricity is too expensive ) . 
  some student can have very small cases of frostbites in the feet , though this is very rare . 
  then you were like me when i came here . 
  i used to ski with temperature at -5 in t-shirt or pretty much hang in light cloths in the winter despite what many people would describe as `` bloody cold '' . 
  then i moved here during summer time and , just like everyone , suffered from the heat . 
  what they told me , though , was to look out for the cold , to which i responded with a `` not impressed '' face ... oh how wrong i was . 
  what i discovered are two things :, 
  1 : moisture ( above 80 % ) during long period of time will suck every inch of heat from your body and that regardless of how much cloth you put on . 
  regardless of how use to cold you are and how much you dress , spending a day at 5 degree with  80 % of humidity will make you regret life itself . 
  2 : spending long periods of time without any heat source will make you very tired . 
  in our modern society , our schedule do not reflect climate . 
  however , many houses are still technologically very similar to the houses with had 2000 years ago . 
  that means that , unless your work place has a heated environment , you 'll be exhausted by the end of the day : and that is every day . 
  another example of this would be the alps/deserts . 
  due to the extremely low moistures of these areas the temperature can drop quite dramatically during the night . 
  however you do n't need much in the way of cold protection as your body will not loose much heat ( provided you sleep on a isolated surface ) . 
  all in all , you can sleep in a t-shirt , a foam mattress and a light blanket without any healthrisk . 
  do this here and you 'll die . 
  if you are interested in the scientific explanation , i can extend on the subject , but i believe this is not the subreddit for it . 
  two factors to take into consideration though ;, 
  1 ) european are n't much racist against muslims or jews . 
  the racism usually go toward more specific populations ( as is the case with northern africans in france or gypsies across europe ) . 
  2 ) many european do not know there even is a difference between immigrants from romania/other ex-urss satellites who are seeking honest jobs elsewhere ( met many of them , quite nice people ) and gypsies who , more often than not , will refuse to pay tax and will trash the land they sit on . 
  the ( official ) graphics drivers for my gpu ( hd4870 ) are not the best of things and simply do n't work with wine or tf2 . 
  if i want to play any game that requires more advanced graphics or specific things ( like tf2 ) i have to boot into windows . 
  there seems to be a strong ( and recurring ) theme that i am not sure i understand . 
  at many points , in this ( and other ) episodes , is stated that living/working with people of talent will `` break you '' . 
  now , i live in a culture that is very remote from the japanese one , but i can understand always being in the shadow of a more talented person as being a pain in the ass . 
  in this case , though , it seems that characters start giving up just by being exposed to some `` talent radiation '' ( as evidenced by the `` people who left the atelier '' line in the middle of the episode ) . 
  can someone with a broader knowledge of japanese culture explain ( eli5 ) why working with talented would be so nefarious to one 's mental health ? 
  thank you !, 
  coming from a country with very tight gun control laws and where the military was one of the main agents in overthrowing a fascist government and in keeping the country as a democracy , i can not concur with this statement . 
  ** not all revolutions ( and people ) are the same and each must be dealt in it 's own fashion . 
  some ( most ) revolution will be bloody , but that should ** never ** be the aim . 
  where i to vote right now , i 'd vote against allowing anyone ( including private corporations ) from buying and selling devices designed to be lethal . 
  that being said , i realize that the united states is very different from the old nations of europe . 
  i 'd finish with a note regarding today 's news : as a society , we have taken the habit of looking away from the poor and feeble , ignoring their plight and misery whilst with try to climb the `` social ladder '' . 
  we lack kindness and we let our fellow humans in the cold . 
  someone who clearly needed help and never got it did something inhuman , and we try to blame each other . 
  the fact is , if you sit at home , raging on the internet then you are just as guilty as anyone else in your society . 
  finland could learn from that example . 
  correct country . 
  however i disagree with you , comrade dissident_walrus . 
  before going into my personal opinion though , i think a small ( and , as best as i can , neutral ) history of the country 's last revolution is in order for our foreign folks and ladies to understand the situation . 
  quite a few years ago , portugal was under a far-right fascist dictatorship , lead by salazar . 
  he was a ruthless capitalist and an enemy to the proletariat . 
  when he left power ( and , later , died ) , the chain of command was weakened and an alliance between many parties ( not necessarily political ones ) booted the old regime out ( in the 24th of april , 1974 , if i am not mistaken ) . 
  for that we have to thank , in a large part , the good people of the left , be them from the pcp ( portuguese communist party ) or other leftists groups . 
  however , in the wake of the revolution , not all parties agreed and because portugal is a very old nation who was once a democracy , they decided `` hey , what the hell , let 's try that again '' . 
  in between the pressure of the eec ( actual eu ) , usa and , to some limited extend , urss we where left with a constitution that is huge , impractical and , at best , does not reflect the ideal that lead to our fairly peaceful overthrowing . 
  now , to address the points of comrade walrus ( if i may call you so ) :, 
   the military stole the steam of the communist party in that country, 
  this is a bit misleading , at best . 
  for clarification , the portuguese communist party still exists and fares fairly well compared to other european nations . 
  we have other marxists groups , such as the be or even a small maoist party . 
  the event our good comrade is referring to was a desperate ( and , in my opinion , shameful ) attempt at a coup-d'etat from extremist . 
  it was not backed by the people and that is why it failed . 
  having a large group of proleteers defending themselves against the few ( but far better equipped ) bourgeois is a noble thing that i would ( and will ) support and give my life for . 
  a small group of people , regardless of how noble their ideas are , trying to impose their ideas on the masses by way of violence is not noble and will get you nowhere . 
  power lies in the union . 
   portugal is a good argument for guns , not against them . 
  we need guns so we can shot them at these military thugs when they try to steal our revolutions . 
   we want a revolution that destroys that very set of people who have been ruining our lives since the day we were born . 
  we want a revolution because it will be violence , because this violence will lead to the massacre of the people that are responsible of every genocide and war that has occurred in modern history . 
  you outline precisely what i think is wrong with too many communists union . 
  the reason i choose to go to the left and then to communism is not because i want revenge . 
  it 's not because i want to cause ** more ** suffering . 
  it 's because i want to lessen it . 
  sure , shooting that bastard that made the child hungry will feel damn good , but it wo n't feed the poor kid . 
  we , as the human race , should strive to help each other . 
  if the only way to do it is by smashing capitalism and punishing it 's guardians , so be it , all the better , but it should ** never , ever ** be the goal of any communist to strive for violence . 
  tl ; dr : so , no , we do n't want a revolution that takes countless lives and draws blood , we want a revolution of peace . 
  we know we wo n't get it , we will prepare ourselves for the worst , but i will never consider anyone my comrade if he has a smile whilst shooting his or her fellow man . 
   excuse me comrade , i was rude here because for a second i thought you were a social democrat . 
  i do n't think the social democrat have discovered the internet yet . 
  i have to apologise too , i believe . 
  i might have been too quick to imprint on you an image i have of too many people who scream for war and violence . 
  accept my humble apologies . 
  my point is not that we must reject violence or that we must not shed blood . 
  as you said , quite well , `` the bourgeois happen to like their privledge , in fact they like it alot . '', 
  and they will , surely , not relinquish it easily . 
  we will have to fight and we will have to struggle . 
  we must rally the people and with one beating heart fight the oppressor . 
  but , as i said , ** we must never hail violence and murder , we must never rejoice at the death of another human being and we must never , ever , use hatred as the source of our power . 
  i could continue on for hours , but i would simply become redundant . 
  i maintain my position that private groups should not be allowed to bear guns portugal or in other european nations and will do so until the people unite and the laws break down . 
  if and when the day of ( r ) evolution come , then i will reconsider . 
  you should mention what country you are in . 
  hulu , for example , does not work for me as i am in europe . 
  however , i live in a country where downloading `` pirated '' content on the internet is legal , so i use other sources ( that i shall not mention here ) . 
  there are some tv/web channels that streams anime , but most are localised in the language of the country . 
  in portugal , the national communist party ( pcp ) opposes european integration for various reason , chief of all because it means , according to them , that the portuguese people will loose supremacy over their own laws . 
  the be ( left-bloc ) , another large left party , opposes the eu in it 's current state because it promotes capitalism and exploitation , but supports the idea of a union between the people of europe . 
  as far as switzerland ( my `` motherland '' ) is concerned , there are no communist parties , so there is not opinion on the mater . 
  i fully agree with that . 
  it would make infinitely more sense to tell ( or remind ) parents to talk with their kids and use some kind of content control with the younger ones . 
  an appartement ( two bedrooms ) in montreux costed over 1 ' 000 ' 000 $ 7y ago . 
  though , as someone mentioned , our houses are built to very high standart . 
  i cried a little when they said they where going to go after kindgartens and kids .
