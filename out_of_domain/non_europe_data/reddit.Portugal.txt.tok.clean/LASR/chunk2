  oh ok ok :d good luck !, 
  you can have the front tnt to retract into the floor with a piston 2blocks below it and have theback piston retract with something similar to a jeb door, 
  awesome !, 
  you are welcome :d, 
  ahah , there were a lot of posts from other people too , but yeah the majority was from edolf :d, 
  university of lisbon, 
  ok , now all the players are approved submitters which means that none of your posts should end up on spam :d,

  i 've been on vacation ...

  shinecraft tnt olympics ? 
  what is that ? 
  i have a friend that had swimming competition last year in the river and finished it with fever ... 
  but this is the only thing i know, 
  i spent a lot of time filling a map ( when they did n't fill automaticaly ) when it was done i fell on a ravine and died . 
  insted of going to get de map again i thought i ` lll do it later , conclusion : i lost the map, 
  is n't that the sethbling 's tnt olympics ? 
  where is it ? 
  awesome !, 
  try to play cs : go the weapons are always the same and you will find a lot of beginners :d, 
  that is happening to me every single mm i play, 
  19 , started playing cs : s in 2008 when a friend gave it to me on my birthday, 
  the problem is that if i have all of my team screaming that i suck it is hard to enjoy it , thanks anyway :d i never bought one before i 'm going to try it !, 
  ok , i 'm going to do that , thank you :d i watched a few purge videos , i guess i 'll watch some more, 
  ok , there is much more : an awesome dragon !, 
  i was n't sure if op was joking or just stupid . 
  now i know :d, 
  just for the looks , 
  i can do it tonight but it has to be late night, 
  i 'm still studying but i 've already used autocad a lot, 
  this was quite unsuccessful, 
  no , thank you i do n't use the mac10 at all, 
  very good indeed !, 
  i did n't know anything as well, 
  i would love to join but sometimes i have a bad internet connection and i 'm afraid that interferes, 
  i would love to be informed as well !, 
  i would like to see cobble , piranesi , cpl_mill / tuscan :d, 
  [ of monster and men - dirty paws ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrwd0m7pmq8 ), 
  i really like them :d, 
  edit : forgot to write the song name, 
  add some depth to the sides , building a balcony pheraps ? 
  yes , i might be a little upset with this, 
  you really love quartz , 
  i did n't want to say anything but i think you have an arrow in your eye, 
  welcome !, 
  i hope you like this little community we have :d, 
  i think we could save the shops for the spawn area , because if we are going to put everything on the nether the spawn overworld will be empty ... 
  ** if you do not like the rules feel free to tell us why and we shall discuss them !, 
  ** i think that there is no need for superior power here , we are still a community of people that know each other and like to have fun playing together . 
  i just ask for good common sense and respect for everybody  if i was n't clear enough here is an example : * - oooops i believe the creeper that killed me blew up 3 blocks on that guy 's building , replacing them and apologize will be the first things to do when i respawn !, 
  * what if we make the seed : `` shinecraft '' ? 
  it is as random as the others :d, 
  * i think that ban a guy from the creative server is a bit exaggerated . . we are a small enough community to admit errors , forgive people and believe they have good intentions :d, 
  * i 'm afraid my mobilephone sucks , so there is no whatsapp for me . 
  i would like to be informed of everything though, 
  * about the ** spawntown ** . 
  i think that we can build anything we want there and there is no need for a restricted theme . 
  i would love to make the spawn area a place where we can find everything and everybody :d although i would like to see bases on isolated spots , just because they take space and everybody should have some space to mine and build wherever they want to . 
  * about the ** netherhub ** . 
  we can think about it later , but for now i think we could make a little competition for how it could look and evolve the layout and style from there . 
  in my opinion it just have to be big enough for all of us and some other community stuff . 
  * about the ** community projects ** . 
  there is no need to plan everything right now . 
  i hope that we build really big stuff together and have a lot of fun , but we have plenty of time to take it easy . 
  an arena would be cool to make some pvp events with everybody :d, 
  * about the ** base building ** . 
  i have discussed that on the * spawntown * topic :d, 
  * about the ** rules reminder ** . 
  i made a comment on that section that shows my point of view, 
  * here are my ** additional ideas ** . 
  i want to keep the death counter  . 
  for it is just that one ... 
  * about the ** group events ** . 
  killing the dragon and the first wither are obligatory , as well as find the stronghold ( this one is for you paul ) . 
  about some other events as many as possible please !, 
  i hope i made myself clear , feel free to discuss my ideas :d, 
  edit : i blame my lack of sleep for all the language mistakes or imperfections, 
  btw , i gave you a flair with your name , i hope you do n't mind, 
  i am with a problem , i have 10 mag-7 radiant alert and i ca n't use them in the contract , can you guys help me ? 
  hmmm that makes sense , thank you :-), 
  only with that one ? 
  i can help you !, 
  i have one on the creative server : can we agree on not setting spawnpoint for anybody on mini-games and everything else ? 
  there are other ways to put the players back in the game with the scoreboard and it does n't mess up some players organization ... 
  oh ok , thanks :-), 
  yeaaa you 're right , that 's true, 
  oooooooops , sorry ruining your format, 
  about the seed . 
  the problem was if people suggested seeds they know are very good . 
  it really does n't matter if they can see it before we have it in the server , because they will be able too see it once it is in the server , it is just a matter of days . 
  but a random seed works for me as fine :d,
