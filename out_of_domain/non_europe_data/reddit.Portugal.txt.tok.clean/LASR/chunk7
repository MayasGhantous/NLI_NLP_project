  the 12 item cap should n't give him a good advantage ? 
  there is cool things dota2 has that could be implemented in go one i really like is a pause system where you can pause a game for a minute until anyone can unpause it . 
  this would be good for disconnecteds that are actually tryingto connect , i really need to go to the bathroom moments and more !, 
  i see . 
  i am a fairly new player and i am not very familiar with spectre , i shouod try him sometime :-), 
  i find it very dificult to play chen or meepo , although lone druid and pl are really easy , i might use some mouse keys for them :-), 
  the thing is if someone dcs he only has 5 min to connect but if the game is paused those minutes are not counting, 
  magnus actually has an awesome combo too , i just really like faceless :-), 
  that is true, 
  that is the one thing i can not do , moving the camera with my mouse is just really really disorientating, 
  awesome !, 
  looks really nice, 
  the interface really looks amazing , i think that the problem is that it is not well known , advertising it could help . 
  for example go talk to / r/phtoshopbattles and ask them to put your link on their sidebar and stuff like that . 
  you are a brave man, 
  it woulb be cool if you could add a marker to the items you can buy on the side shop, 
  i like to play windrunner a lot mainly because she is really versatile . 
  i think she needs fase boots and forcestaff/blink for every role because she thrives on good mobility ( reason : skill shots and low health ) . 
  if you are not suporting ( offlaning or mid ) i usually go orchid and then depending on the game damage items like bkb or if semi-supporting sheepstick for the triple disable, 
  you can do the same thing around , call a vote , if your team mates say yes before the 2 `` no '' and you disconnect he gets kicked, 
  it is only for ipad atm , i am still waiting for the android version, 
  / r/idiotsgettinghurt, 
  ooops forgot about the wiki , thanks !, 
  thanks a lot !, 
  i will check them !, 
  thanks :d, 
  i believe it does , i play occasionally on my girlfriend 's ipad and it is exactly the same has the computer version, 
  i believe we did not receive your application , although we are not accepting anyone at the moment , i am sorry, 
  try / r/globaloffensive they should help you better :d i 've never played 1.6 but used to play scoutzknivez on source and now on go and it feels more or less the same for me, 
  you ca n't be called hacker if you ca n't buy helmet + kevlar ... 
  caps lock, 
  looking great !, 
  this is a different sub , and i posted roughly at the same time :d, 
  and his penis, 
  thanks !, 
  blood seeker , at 2k mmr everybody feeds him like crazy, 
  this, 
  there is a `` punishmet '' , if you leave it counts as a lost game even if your team wins, 
  try bountyhunter free wins at 2k mmr, 
  why do you think it is not worth it build a blink on ta ? 
  thanks !, 
  at a lower mmr like mine blink tends to help a lot because there is no detection and nobody knows where you are , but i 'll try the drums yasha and see how that works :-), 
  that is very nice :-), 
  / r/csmapmakers, 
  with items void can keep you stunned during the entire fight , i would vote for him, 
  for those moments where you ca n't handle the pressure, 
  just played a few rounds with a friend and it was a lot of fun !, 
  that dickbutt :d, 
  there is a problem with it tough , my friend and i would spawn on different platforms and needed to no clip through the map to find each other, 
  oh ok , did n't know that, 
  snow white and the seven batmans, 
  is it because of the shadows ? 
  the clouds look at a good speed for me . 
  thanks, 
  i see , i am going to try that sometime !, 
  can you provide the spawns locations ? 
  thanks, 
  giving it a quick look i ca n't see the purpose of the room on top of b site , it is very complex and looks interesting but then you have just a little door to the site , making it a bit useless . 
  maybe bringing it down and let it open with b site inside it ? 
  overall it looks fun with that middle where you can go pretty much everywhere . 
  i got the hero 2 early this year , using it ever since, 
  i used to love faceless void but then he started to show up on every game and being annoying as fuck . 
  so i guess it 's legion commander or kunnka now, 
  nice !, 
  in my opinion what makes d2 so popular is that it is a very simple map . 
  it has a very simple layout that is easy to learn , the colour scheme makes it really easy to identify players and it does n't have much props making it clean looking and easy to walk around . 
  one other big factor is that it has been played since forever and as / u/wazanator _ said the community hates change, 
  how long did it take to film it ? 
  wow , that really is a long time !, 
  it looks awesome though, 
  i like blues , rock , the beatles and lot more , not metal or heavier stuff though . 
  thanks !, 
  there is no good reason to block the all-chat . 
  people talk to each other when doing stuff and there is nothing wrong about it . 
  on every sport they talk to each other , why should it be diferent on dota ? 
  which ones ? 
  well , that explains a lot . 
  the thing is that usually i am the only one on my team with the problem, 
  awesome !, 
  how did you get the suit though ? 
  i use nothing but windguru , tells you everything, 
  sometimes i use my tablet to read , but only when i ca n't use my computer because the screen is very small, 
  the problem with that theme is that it is overdone ... nuke , cache , old season etc, 
  weapon : ak-47, 
  preferable skin : anything that is n't a blue laminate,

  o cl\u00e1ssico [ filho do recluso ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0h8dvuetncc ), 
  how do you builder as a support ? 
  wind is probably my favourite hero but i can only make her work mid, 
  happy new year !, 
  what an awesome way to start !, 
  thank you !, 
  i play her mid with great success , went from 1.6 k mmr to 1.9 k mmr playing almost only wind . 
  i go mid with ** null talisman ** and a ** set of tangos ** , then go ** bottle ** , ** phase ** , ** maelstrom ** and ** aghs ** . 
  after that you go to what you need in that specific game , if there is a pa or any butterfly go mkb , if they have a lot of stuns consider a linkens or orchid , if they rely on melee right clickers sometimes you can go skadi , etc. . . 
  i tried buying a blink or force staff but it did n't accomplished much , maybe because of my low mmr, 
  edit : for the skil build i put 1 level on windrun very early so i can escape ganks , then max powershot  shackle  winrun , i start to put levels on ulti at level 10 , sometimes earlier if i want to push towers, 
  what is wrong with that ? 
  i get force very occasionally , maybe when they have a clock or a void or something like that,
