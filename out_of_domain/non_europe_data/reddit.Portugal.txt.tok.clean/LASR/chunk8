  ancient tuskarition is the best name by far, 
  sunday would be nice , i have an exam friday, 
  the flair is enabled yes but i ca n't change it . 
  i do n't know how to make it so everyone can change their own , but i know that the admin can change each user flair individualy, 
  it works !, 
  thanks, 
  under the subscribe button , where it says `` show my flair on this subreddit . 
  it looks like : '' you can edit it, 
  why do magnets need to be solid ? 
  what happens when you melt one ? 
  thank you, 
  great video , thanks !, 
  yes, 
  it really depends on how you use it , for example if you write alot , maybe you should stick to the laptop , i find it hard to take notes on a touch screen . 
  the only fundamental thing is a big screen 10-inch, 
  71 % on wind with 50 matches vs 46 % overall, 
  i have one at my house too :-), 
  i ca n't remember , i got there through some portal in the nether :d, 
  we did n't loose the moose did we ? 
  yes , now that you say the name i think i remember, 
  i would like spawn to be a mediaval themed town , where everybody builds whatever they want as long as it fits the theme, 
  cs : go , dota2 e minecraft, 
  hi , i really like it !, 
  although the head looks a bit wierd . 
  do you think you can make the head to look a little bit more like an helmet and less like an hat ? 
  thank you, 
  much better thank you !, 
  this , my computer probably wo n't handle amplified, 
  i think people should be able to build them , and who does n't like it does n't use it . 
  for example , i hate that pile of poop jalk built on spawn so i just do n't use it, 
  i would like to see it looking like an actual town , with some garden areas , maybe a central circus with a fountain or something like that, 
  well , not that kind :d, 
  happy cake day, 
  do you want the bed coords ? 
  because 300 300 is inside my base and is pretty much the center, 
  if your are giving it names please do n't call it arroz chau chau 's base , call it arroz chau chau 's farm instead please, 
  sniper rush eblade never fails, 
  care to explain ? 
  thanks, 
  `` senior member '' = playing for more than 2 months :d, 
  this weekend it will be hard for me , but you guys can do it without me, 
  oh , did n't know that !, 
  thank you !, 
  even more ? 
  a stack of hay bale has 576 pieces of wheat , is n't a diamond worth it ? 
  i think that if you kill another mob with it , the other mob drops a head, 
  i think the head has a really small chance to drop , so you will need a lot of mobs, 
  i knew the 1 head per explosion thingy , very sad indeed, 
  make him the server mascot ? 
  you are mistaken . 
  it was done at y = 255, 
  i was just joking :-) the reason we built it so high was that we wanted to see how long it would take for you to notice, 
  hmmmmmm ... maybe ? 
  this time i missed a lot more people mostly because it took much more time that i was expecting and i am sorry for that . 
  if you want a camel for yourself just message me your coords . 
  thanks !, 
  great !, 
  mouse - logitech g400s, 
  rank - mg2, 
  i 'm drowning in tests , i 'll have time to play again next week, 
  try other kind of games like mobas, 
  thanks !, 
  that 's awesome !, 
  thanks, 
  portuguese here , caralho does not mean a hard thing or an icicle, 
  i do n't think the reset is a good solution , we ca n't reset the world everytime some people loose interest . 
  one thing that could work is the schedule of a frequent event , for example a weekly building competition or a pvp event every 2 weeks . 
  something that players will be expecting and feel like they want to work for it . 
  if it was n't for purge i probably would n't playing dota . 
  his videos made me understand the heroes and the game . 
  i?ve been playing for over a year now and everytime i want to play a hero i have n't played before or i played a long time ago i go watch is videos, 
  sounds good , if you need wheat for some reason ** there is an amazing wheat shop at spawn !!, 
  now for real , i think it is only fair that you open a shop just do n't make things very expensive please , 
  sounds like i need to investigate, 
  very useful !, 
  ingrish pzz, 
  today i got lazy , tuna and beans for dinner, 
  where are you getting it ? 
  today was study day ... 
  it is still better than no plans ... 
  teach yourself something or start a big project on something that you like, 
  how old are you ? 
  great age !, 
  are you studying ? 
  sorry about that , but college is great !, 
  work for it !, 
  is ir ok if i build a scyscraper or do you think it wo n't fit ?
