  you support each other , even the bad people , and try to make everyone a better person . 
  this , however , is cultural more than anything . 
  it is n't about logic . 
  as an example , you would n't sell your own mother . 
  some people would , even some cultures , and that 's appalling for most of us . 
  i do n't get this . 
  is n't that the very definition of a conservative ? 
  unrelated , but is that how much water american toilets usually have ? 
  it 's not what he said in the first place . 
  he said that even given every reason to disown a child , he ca n't grasp the concept of doing it . 
  he can not understand it . 
  you 're giving logical reasons . 
  but those are n't enough , because for most of the world , family is n't a logical but an emotional thing . 
  it was , for a few centuries . 
  it is n't anymore . 
  yes , all the news we get from portugal here is from dumb things . 
  ... that 's a christian name . 
  edit : [ proof ] ( http://www.behindthename.com/name/geronimo ), 
   they were among the first great explorers to go to sea ( i think ) . 
  this is pretty much the only thing portugal is famous for . 
  we were the first europeans to set out into the big blue monster over yonder .

  i 'm talking about [ this ] ( http://goldenvisa-portugal.com/faq.html ) . 
  basically , buy property , gain citizenship , and with that free travel trough the schengen space . 
  that is true , but it requires less pressure for water to evaporate without hitting 100 \u00b0 c. 
  think of it as less force holding the water molecules together at the surface . 
  as an example , water boils at about 70 \u00b0 c if you 're in the top of mt. 
  everest . 
  that said , i 'd think a washing machine would have the same or even more pressure than the outside . 
  that 's not vapour , it is liquid water . 
  please take no offense for this , but i am really curious : more often than not i see people talking about `` x decent '' . 
  it is really common so it makes me , as a non-native english speaker , really wonder : is that a typo or the actual word ? 
  oh i understood what you meant , but that word , together with desert , is very commonly mispelt , and i notice it all the time . 
  til americans vote on wednesdays . 
  is n't that counter-productive in that many people wo n't vote because they 've got to work ? 
  anyway , hope the democratic ways work for the best for you !, 
  uhm . 
  so it is . 
  brain fart , pay no heed to that detail . 
  weekdays all feel the same ... 
  / r/portuguese , try asking for help there . 
  that said , european portuguese is quite different from brazilian portuguese , even more than , say , american and british english . 
  but learning bp is just as good for us ( we can understand them fine , the opposite is n't always true ) , and it 's wiser for you , given the number of speakers of both languages . 
  ou de circular .

  is n't the use of poison very frowned upon in islam ? 
  or several with broken , unvaluable tusks . 
  i was trying to point out that for a muslim to do this to isis , they must really hate them a lot .

  i have n't seen this used in ages and it 's a good thing too , but just so you know , i 'm going to use it just for you :, 
  this is where i know you from . 
  air masses are the ones that collide and interact , the interface between them is called a front . 
  it can be a warm or cold front depending on which air mass is moving towards the other . 
  i have never been sure if 90 's kids were those who grew up in the 90 's or were born in the 90 's . 
  i just want to be sure that i am not a 90 's kid .

  relevant username pelo triplicado . 
  huh , thanks for the heads up about the joke . 
  nailed it ? 
  that amount is so oddly specific . 
  together with your username , i think you 're trying to get rich at reddit 's expense . 
  are you saying that if i ask to take a pic with an american policeman i 'll be profiled ? 
  soon enough someone will think the bottom post was somehow based on the top one !, 
  ah , that makes sense , thanks . 
  what myth ?

  that 's okay , there 's only so much you can do !,

  should n't earth time dilation be 1 rather than 0 ? 
  and probably a little extra . 
  did portugal run to brazil again or what the heck is going on ? 
  what 's with the hat ? 
  portugal conquers brazil ? 
  sounds easy .
