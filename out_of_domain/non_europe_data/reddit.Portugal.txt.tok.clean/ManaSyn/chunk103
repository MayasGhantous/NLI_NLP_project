  in movies and the like , people say things like `` a couple of years ago everyone died '' . 
  i always read it as `` a few years ago everyone died '' , but the subtitles go that `` two years ago everyone died '' . 
  so which version is true ? 
  so basically , a couple = a few . 
  that 's what i thought . 
  thanks !, 
  fuck that , water is the single most important material in the universe for us , i 'll stick with our beloved planet . 
  those are some mountains ... 
  i would n't say a series but rather a few movies . 
  the silmarillion has a lot of different stories , although they are related one way or the other . 
  awe is certainly not what i feel when i think of the us . 
  i disagree , i think it was a pretty sweet choice , together with actual ingame sound . 
  so yes , opinions , 
  my only critique is that there was no titan footage , but i can certainly understand that they were looking for a fast-paced , multi-kill video . 
  well it 's not exactly a secret that the us helped fund some wars either , should they also not help ? 
  i quite like your mathematical use of square brackets . 
  they 'd weather the weather , whether the weather was fine or not . 
  \u00c9 natural . 
  he 's using educated individuals as an insult . 
  that 's shit allright . 
  not sure i follow , did the satchel get thrown out on eject ? 
  til he 's 38 . 
  but you seem to trigger it , and pilot dies at the same time . 
  i guess the right attitude can make a difference . 
  what typo ? 
  sorry , english is n't my first language , that seems perfectly fine to me : /, 
  edit : a photography is perfectly valid in my language , i guess it is n't in english . 
  how should it be ? 
  ah , one letter makes all the difference then . 
  thanks !, 
  funny you had the tyre changing scene right after the cobblestone road !, 
  also , x-post this everywhere , the azores need to be seen , and your video is great !, 
  well they say beefed up guys look like they have a tiny person in a huge armour . 
  this one 's just a little big . 
  what type of portuguese ? 
  shame , then you 'll have a real hard time understanding any of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lua0jpzxk78 ) . 
  estar\u00e1 talvez a falar [ disto ] ( http://www.rtp.pt/noticias/index.php?article=665471&amp;tm=8&amp;layout=121&amp;visual=49 ) . 
  you wo n't understand most of the references though !, 
  this is a sad version of reverse gifs . 
  first one is close , i am a scientist . 
  second one is quite off . 
  i 'm portuguese . 
  none of the above line is correct . 
  at least i hope i 'm not a hipster !, 
  i 'd like to think the bottom one is , though , 
  that 's one very tall bed . 
  what about your independence day , 4/7 ? 
  in a way , that 's his point , just from a different view . 
   uncle steve - `` you 're probably putting on some weight with all that hearty german cooking , huh ? 
  you go to the bakery alot ? 
  you 're probably eatin a lot of that wurst and cheese and sauerkraut . 
  an american travelling to other country to get fatter ? 
  heh ... got ta love stereotypes . 
  physics , math 's the language that translates it to us . 
  it 's a refreshing new civ reference to wales . 
  should it not be atalantes ? 
  religious/other , mind you , the other in the us state being cultural , everyone does it . 
  just out of curiosity , how much does circumcision cost in the us ? 
  implying master bates is n't european . 
  piranha in portuguese , pira\u00f1a in spanish . 
  that goes for pretty much every word , like espanha vs espa\u00f1a . 
  portuguese * nh * = spanish * \u00f1 *, 
  that could get you killed back then . 
  who takes ten minutes to eat ? 
  food is to be appreciated slowly !, 
  america . 
  at least they got portuguese right . 
  so that 's why i prefer the average girl to those plastic-cut rich bitches . 
  reverse gif of that is probably creepy as hell . 
  looks like a caiman to me . 
  this is how i feel when i talk to an extrovert . 
  well , minus the stupid immature shit , of course . 
  ... and most americans . 
  yes , i 'm not sure what people are thinking here . 
  mostro-a . 
  and untrue !, 
  should you not have chosen the distance between lisbon and moscow for a more adequate comparison of distances ? 
  aipt, 
  ver raparigas a jogar \u00e9 sempre giro independentemente do pa\u00eds , 
  ou do reino unido !, 
  so this is what laurelin looks like .

  mobile . 
  youtube app is an hassle . 
  this , obviously , is only illustrative and has no relevant scale whatsoever . 
  [ here ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/world/10/goce_gravity_field/img/goce_gravity_field_786map.gif ) 's a map for anyone interested in values . 
  sorry , should have posted where [ i got it ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8767763.stm ) . 
  what the map is representing is the so-called [ geoid ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geoid ) , which is the representation of earth 's gravitational field . 
  every point in that map has the same gravitational potential , and the disparities are caused by different densities all the way down to the center of the earth . 
  [ here ] ( http://s.hswstatic.com/gif/secrets-of-gravity.gif ) 's the same map with letters in it . 
  not really . 
  you have ~ 10 m.s ^ -2 out of a bit over 6000 km . 
  how much do you think ~ 100 m is going to affect your weight ? 
  not even climbing mt. 
  everest or going down the marianas trench has an effect you could notice . 
  in fact , those who work in the area use the unit gal ( after gallileu , 1 gal = 1 cm.s ^ -2 ) and , pretty much always , the miligal ( 1 mgal = 10 ^ -5 m.s ^ -2 ) . 
  even so , despite the real small number , it is used to find resources underground , for example .
