  not the best thing to watch at 7 am ... 
   pqc, 
  well , a slab ( the plate being subducted ) would displace the heavier mantle so that could be a reason . 
  less mass , less pull . 
  still , i am certainly not the best person to tell you that . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.ncaor.gov.in/pages/researchview/11 ) 's some quick info i found :, 
   one such geoid low , the largest one , is centered around the south of india . 
  several suggestions have been made to explain this geoidal low . 
  some researchers think that it is caused due to the depression in the core-mantle boundary , while others propose density heterogeneities in the upper mantle . 
  it has also been proposed that it is produced due relict of earlier subduction . 
  all the studies are , however , in agreement that it is a deep-seated earth structure . 
  why did you get a random challenge completed out of nowhere ( ~ 0:35 ) ? 
  i still do n't get the reddit reference . 
  that 's what i call a shitty colour scale . 
  oh , okay , thanks . 
  you failed to see different currency symbols . 
  i guess you are at [ 6 ] indeed . 
  not sure if you 're homeschooled or ... 
  can you have your parents as your teachers in regular schooling system wherever you 're from ? 
  mass ! = weight . 
  that depends if the moon is american or not . 
  southern europe is low because no one stays here after finishing university , no point . 
  we were being pedantic . 
  weight is not measured in kg , 
  even so , if you 're going for ~ 1000 n , you 'd still weigh ~ 1000 n . the approximation of g to from its value to 10 m.s ^ -2 is much higher than the change between india and iceland . 
  \\  mcq, 
  a few weeks ago i went to a james concert , and there were a lot of phones in the air . 
  with that sweet look of him , he asked everyone to lower them down and enjoy their show , and people actually did it . 
  well , for the most part , at least . 
  yes , they 're still around . 
  next time i see a dubious post on reddit i 'll remember who let the dogs out . 
   mermaids represent chastity, 
  where have you seen a mermaid representing chastity ? 
  not even in the little mermaid as all ariel wanted was to fuck the prince . 
  i 'm not . 
  it is the first time i 've ever heard someone say mermaids are supposed to represent chastity . 
  fuck , i had n't even noticed it . 
  i 'm half tempted to just delete this for it , but i can not find a reddit post about it so this is actually oc ... 
  funnily enough , it 's actually from [ reddit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1ripc6/i_drew_a_on_the_box_for_over_700_people_heres_100/ ) , but it is n't oc from me . 
  here you go :, 
  [ source ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1ripc6/i_drew_a_on_the_box_for_over_700_people_heres_100/cdnr8j0 ) . 
  you can !, 
   http://www.goodietwosleeves.com/, 
  thanks !, 
  no , i found this on my facebook wall , someone posted the imgur link . 
  but yes , everytime one of my friends likes a post from there it is always something i 've seen days earlier on reddit . 
  neither of those is true . 
  i joined reddit years before the oc creator posted [ his own work ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/gabroll/submitted/?sort=top ) here , for actually all the karma . 
  what changed with portugal ? 
  they 're two different things , abacaxi the domestic , sweeter variant , anan\u00e1s the wild , acid version . 
  interesting bit about galicia . 
  at least 200,000 of it . 
  not sure what ` it ' actually is , because the map lacks proper units . 
  is this how the russians laugh on the internet ? 
  funny coming from an american show . 
  all the aliens land there , but one . 
  knowing his name is the reason for you to be bothered ? 
  i do n't follow . 
  esl here : why is it ` disappointed in ' rather than ` disappointed with ' ? 
  in the second picture , homer 's chin appears to be huge !, 
  ah internet ... 
  i need a lot more translation , this is really interesting . 
  got any source ? 
  on the contrary , even . 
  sound there is still about 5 times faster than in air . 
  interesting , yes . 
  relevant ? 
  not really . 
  oh , fair enough . 
  you could have quoted the relevant part , though . 
  i thought booze was expensive in the us . 
  almost double than what ? 
  i still do n't know how much it is in the us . 
  but after a bit of google i found that a 24 pack ( of what i imagine are those tall cans ) is $ 20 , is that correct ? 
  fog 's nothing more than ground level clouds . 
  well he 's not wrong !, 
  so it 's just like tinfoil then . 
  what 's the target made of ? 
  it looks like concrete , but i kinda doubt that ... 
  congratulations to the winner !, 
  my gift has yet to arrive ( but is marked as shipped ) , and my giftee is yet to post what i sent his way ... 
  i 'm just gon na go ahead and ask everyone not to make a religion joke . 
  thank you . 
  portugal . 
  it is a lot cheaper here than in most european countries , sure . 
  and this is why you should get a cab back home . 
  i 'm guessing you drive a bus down the mississippi ? 
  what 's with the dictator username ? 
  i thought pikey = gypsy , ie the culture , not the race . 
  i do n't want to sound pedantic , even because english is not my first language , but that is not what google tells me . 
  * you can not walk in the tagus river bridges , that is correct . 
  the smallest one is over 2 km in length and there 's no safe passage for that . 
  but both bridges have nice promenades underneath them right where they enter the river , so you can look up to them !, 
  * well i may be a bit biased , but bad food is hard to find in lisbon . 
  any place will serve you great food . 
  in fact , my rule of thumb is , the shittier a place looks , the better the food . 
  you know , in that `` they care about their food and not their looks '' kind of way . 
  * yes , you can pretty much walk anywhere .
