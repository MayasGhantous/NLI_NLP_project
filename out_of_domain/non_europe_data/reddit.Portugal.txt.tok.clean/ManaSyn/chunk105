  the city itself is not very big , and the pretty places are all around a ~ 2km radius circle , with a few outliers here and there . 
  keep in mind , though , january is one of the high rain months . 
  not that it 'll rain a lot , but if you 're unlucky to get a big event in that day , walking is n't too recommended . 
  doable , of course , but our [ cobblestone sidewalks ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-puxfa-ylq88/uqq33_p11ni/aaaaaaaaoyq/rg--abjryhg/s1600/rua+homem+cristo+aveiro+portugal+cal%c3%a7ada+portuguesa+roc2c+2.jpg ) , while pretty , are terrible to walk on with rain , as they can get deceivingly slippery .

  * sure , we have some nice high points . 
  you 'll probably love the castle . 
  anyway , we at / r/portugal have done a small [ wiki ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/portugal/wiki/index ) entry for visitors ( you can also check the lisbon link ) , and you 're more than welcome to x-post there to get a lot more opinions too !, 
  hope you enjoy our city , 
  it is n't here , because there was a dictator with that name . 
  but sure , no reason not be in other parts of the world . 
  that too . 
  after all , how many salazar roam around hogwarts nowadays ? 
  it is n't , though , because with all that access to the black sea , russia has returned crimea to the ukraine !, 
  the wheel weaves as the wheel wills . 
  you do n't need signs or lines , if you have someone coming from the right , you stop . 
  you drive slowly . 
  uploaded to imgur for mobile users and re-submitted it . 
  [ source video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p7pfucc1y0&amp;t=37 ) . 
   means traffic has to unnecessarily slow down from all directions . 
  unnecessary ? 
  it is very good practice to slow down on intersection , regardless of what priority you have . 
  i would never call defensive driving unnecessary . 
  do you really think a stop sign will stop idiots ? 
  [ source video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p7pfucc1y0#t=30 ) . 
  what video ? 
  congratulations you lucky bastard !, 
   it 's your 's, 
  trying to get a new meme working or something ? 
  dm ; hs . 
  s\u00f3 se for greve das operadoras ... 
  as a portuguese ... 
  i would n't mind this map . 
  i did look it up . 
  [ i had no idea ] ( http://mentalfloss.com/article/50957/do-lemmings-really-run-cliffs-their-death ) . 
   you could not hear about crimea without a mention of georgia . 
  well that 's a bit of an exaggeration , but sure , georgia was used plenty as an example of what could happen to crimea . 
  to be honest , every time i watch something from american tv i always assume first it is fake and scripted . 
  what about coffee with milk ? 
  it has that colour and tastes divinely . 
   on the other hand , some are the smartest individuals i 've ever met . 
  no offense but that does n't say much at all ... 
   g00db1e_m0b11e_us3r5, 
  oh that was well done you sly bastard !, 
  i 'm not . 
  op has given nothing more than anedoctal evidence . 
  i 'm not calling him dumb or anything , if he says he 's a good person and nice , i have no reason not to believe , but i also have no reason to believe marines are smart because of what he said . 
  n\u00e3o se v\u00ea muito bem na minha imagem , mas ela tem [ umas rodinhas ] ( http://www.jacostore.co.uk/ekmps/shops/jacostore/images/2-set-london-routemaster-red-bus-mugs-24-p.jpg ) a servir de base , \u00e9 mesmo louca :d, 
  i think it 's one of those weird english rules . 
  `` all but '' means `` almost '' . 
  i 'm not sure why . 
  that has probably happened a lot more times than we think . 
  so outside soviet russia , post is very important lamp ? 
  i do n't get it ... 
  it 's a hen whisperer . 
  when you look in a mirror ... ? 
  you do n't have to wear the same days in a row , you can alternate different items for days without washing them . 
  what 's a coe ? 
  i feel bad for laughing at this ... 
  maybe they felt the same but did n't show you . 
  huh , til there 's a debate about coe being catholic . 
  jurassic park . 
  i was 6-7 when it came out , and like many kids i had a special love for the giant lizards of the past . 
  thus , my uninformed parents took me to watch the movie when it came out because there was a lot of hype around it . 
  let 's just say it forever changed how i saw cute things and , close to 30 , i still have n't seen the movie . 
  i 'm sorry that my relatives are n't pieces of shit . 
  [ aqui tens ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/dec/29/best-clubs-europe-club-nights-picked-by-djs ) . 
  actually , freedom is related to lawlessness . 
  security , on the other hand ... 
  yes , that was what i was trying to say . 
  you live in a free country if there are no laws restricting your actions , hence the lawlessness , but in the real world we require laws to keep us safe from others ( in a very broad sense ) . 
  we 're saying the same thing , really . 
  huh , would you mean alt + ctrl +2 ? 
  i know this might sound like a weird question , but to access the extra characters on my keyboard ( @ $ # etc ) i either press my right-side alt button or ctrl + alt . 
  it 's an european keyboard ( portuguese ) so i know it differs , but i thought that shortcut was the same . 
  oh , okay , that should be enough reason , yeah . 
  try the [ rworldmap ] ( http://journal.r-project.org/archive/2011-1/rjournal_2011-1_south.pdf ) package .

  / u/asantos3 , mete esta merda como banner no / r/portugal faxabor . 
  is the sentence wrong or unnecessary ? 
  english is n't my first language . 
  ou transparente no background , 
  okay , i guess the word i wanted was trained rather than professional . 
  you 're right . 
  i wanted to say trained driver , i did not mean any disrespect for their work . 
  he did come to a stop . 
  i 'm not sure what you mean . 
  i 'm thinking they 're better than that . 
  it 's all good , you were n't the only one , i will try better next time , thank you . 
  not everywhere in the world , but i meant trained rather than professional in the title . 
  my mistake . 
  from the source video linked , maybe . 
  yeah , i read wouldnt as would . 
  sure , i get what you mean . 
  some of them think of the moon as the 51 ^ st state , maybe that 's what they mean . 
  do you also pay when receiving letters , or are the stamps used by the sender only ? 
  americans spend more dollars than europeans !, 
  source : am european , have never seen a dollar in my life . 
  nice moustache .
