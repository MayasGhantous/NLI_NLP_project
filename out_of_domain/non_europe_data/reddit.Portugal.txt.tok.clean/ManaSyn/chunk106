  it is n't as much as cell phones but different operators altogether . 
  as a portuguese , i 'm good with that !, 
  still , only one person pays . 
  what do you mean , that pilot jumping into the dropship made that smiley better !, 
  maybe it 's hiding something !, 
  that is n't chinese attire , is it ?

  why was faro rather than lisbon put there ? 
  i guess it is the south-westernmost city in europe ? 
  also , if you 're using honolulu , might have thrown ponta delgada/funchal in it too , for good measure . 
  not to mention cayenne ... 
  by what definition ? 
  easy to spot a troll when he speaks about uk having tax dollars . 
  that 's what i find the most puzzling about this , apparently they tell their kids to write letters to killers ... 
  to be fair , it 's a very good example . 
  i know a few roma who have been in the region for a few centuries and are hard-working and help society . 
  then you have the ones in the camp who ruin everything for everyone . 
  it is all a matter of culture , not race . 
  roma is an ethnicity , gypsy is a culture . 
  did you shoot her ? 
  i do n't believe you .

  man , that snow looks so cool ( pun not intended ) , i wish we had some around here ...

  how come ? 
  not a native english speaker ( in fact , i was raised less than a mile away from where this picture is ) , but i thought toddler was a very young child like that . 
  oh i see , thanks for the heads up then !, 
  amazing that i still get to improve my english at least once a day , even if i 've been speaking it for years . 
  well , writing , actually ... 
  thank you !, 
  as an european , i was wondering what was up with the communist boxes ... 
  why does it use feet for height and kilometer for horizontal scale ? 
  does anyone actually take srs seriously ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
  there 's a lot of starbucks in the big cities of spain . 
  basicamente quererias estar no preto . 
  portanto , no luck . 
  you can live for very long in the us for as long as you have a lot of money . 
   prescribe the exact same medications, 
  do you buy their medication ? 
  do you pay their expenses and relieve them of their stress ( which lowers life expectancy ) ? 
  if you 're into medicine , you should well know there 's a lot more into curing someone than treating them . 
  i 'm not even criticizing the us medical system . 
  i plainly stated that you can live for very long . 
  how is that criticizing ?!, 
  it 's your fucked up prices that are a problem , they literally ruin and destroy people 's lives . 
  so next time you go on a rant about how you love your job and everyone is ignorant , keep in mind that you could still do your job very well and get paid very well , while not destroying someone 's life at the same time . 
  next time you save someone , consider that . 
  it calculates a titan 's weak spots and three-shots it too . 
  sure , it 's great . 
  i 'm sitting in it right now ( well , in a chair above it ) , and i 've had it for years . 
  helps that i live in the world 's first cork producer , and stuff 's cheap here . 
  it never gets too hot , it never gets too cold . 
  it is very easy to wash , and you can walk barefoot in it without any worry . 
  how are they a bad idea ? 
  as a portuguese myself , i kinda have to agree with you . 
  we have hardly any problem understanding brazilians , but the opposite is not true . 
  thus , and because they are so many more , it makes sense that software developers use that version of the language , and let people know about it . 
  it saddens me , but i 'm a realist anyway . 
  i have the utmost respect for health professionals because it 's very hard and responsible work , but they/you have little to no control in the prices . 
  am i wrong in saying that us health prices ruin lifes ? 
  those supplement costs you mention , are there no cost associated to the patient at all ? 
  are they interest free , or however they work ? 
  the irony . 
  i always thought annoying super-thin ladies with high pitch voices were only something on american tv and were not real . 
  oh wow , i love that one . 
  did a bit of [ digging ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/eyk3g/hi_trees_ive_just_started_rleaves/ ) . 
   the name of the subreddit is , yes , a pun , but i hope a bit metaphor-y too : leaves being something that make the tree stronger , which i think a candid discussion will do , and ultimately something that can fall off once the time is right without hurting the tree itself . 
  that is amazing !, 
  toma [ alguns ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:video_games_set_in_portugal ) . 
  everytime americans say they went to europe , they mean the cliche places like paris , rome , london , berlin , etc. 
  but what do you feel and recommend about other counties like portugal ( my own ) , norway , czech republic , croatia , greece , the balkans , etc ? 
  we have some pickpocket problems in the touristy places , which i bet that 's where they did this . 
  the fuck is wrong with italy ? 
  ah portugal . 
  nice to be recognized for something !,

  as a non-american , i always see reddit commenting about a store or something i have never heard about . 
  i just deal with it and understand the context or google it , instead of making a meme .

  i searched using [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2rf5s4/young_monk/ ) image and found only a submission that got removed for being too small , so i tried my luck with a bigger image and did n't search for other . 
  apologies then .

  my phone is slow . 
  i need to hit the home button , wait for it , hit the camera button , wait for it , wait for it some more , take a pic , wait for it , notice it has no flash , turn flash on , take another pic , wait for it . 
  all in all i need a solid minute to take a picture . 
  yeah , i do n't think obama is more famous than ronaldo , at all . 
  edit : to clarify - the vast majority of the world 's population is some poor bloke from a poor country . 
  they do n't care about american ( or world ) policies there , but they do care about a fun game and its stars . 
  huh , til i can look north and have no land till ireland close to where i live . 
  everytime i see portugal in any of these , i wonder if they ask old ladies or something .
