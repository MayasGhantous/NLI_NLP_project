  do you mean northern as in culture or just to the north ? 
  because , yeah , you are a lot to the north related to me :d, 
  you need a bit more than that , actually , because you want a lot of liquid water . 
  earth itself does not average 0 \u00b0 c but rather around 15 \u00b0 c. 
  english question ( esl here ) : would it still not be called a sunset ? 
  a sun is the star of a system , ours is called technically sol , but is referred all the time as the sun , just like the moon . 
   i agree about the metric system , but i think fahrenheit is better than celsius . 
  fahrenheit is more useful for every day life . 
  that 's just not true . 
  if you were to say they were equal , depending on your uprising/habit of using either unit , i 'd definitely agree with you . 
  there 's no reason at all either is superior to the other for your daily use . 
  but since celsius ( as an addition of kelvin ) is far superior in science and technical terms ... 
   but to the average person fahrenheit is much more convenient . 
  why ? 
  that makes no sense . 
  you are not answering the question of why fahrenheit is the better measure . 
  you can do exactly the same with any temperature scale as long as you know what two arbitrary points feel like . 
  indeed , even for the same scale there 's bound to be lack sensitivity : a canadian wo n't be able to tell what temperature is in the sahara , other than ` above 100 f/30 c '' , and a moroccan wo n't know the temperature in the antarctic . 
   horror !, 
  what , like [ this ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/08/15/article-2726260-208e86fa00000578-422_634x390.jpg ) one ? 
  with what ? 
  this is probably gon na garner downvotes from american centric reddit ( i hope not , would love to have a civil discussion about this ) , but if europe were to unite against a common foe , nothing would defeat her . 
  in a way , would you consider possible that having the americans fight our wars for us could be a sign of european strength and influence rather than its weakness ? 
  wonder if you can glitch as a goddamn leviathan ... 
  what about apartment buildings ? 
  huh , til new zealand 's islands have the least original name ever . 
  what about te ika-a-m\u0101ui and te waipounamu , are those not official names ? 
  it 's not anti-patriotic to me . 
  but then again i 'm not american so that 's probably why , in this case . 
  big ? 
  it 's tiny , i did n't see it at first . 
  as a portuguese , i really do n't . 
  or in third world countries . 
  maybe them , as europeans , had to be reminded they were actually upside down !, 
  portugal has n't had a major change of her continental borders since about 1250 , with only one small change around 1800 . 
  in fact , if you look at [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1sjhgodfhg ) oft-posted video , portugal does get a little boring - although it is slightly in error as it portrays the iberian union has an unified spain ( a common mistake ) . 
  portugal was ~ ~ independent ~ ~ rather autonomous , she just had the same king as spain . 
  for all practical effects , it was an unified spain , but for border effects , it was n't . 
  edit :, 
  no one is afraid of russia , it 's a joke ... 
  nah , he is wrong . 
  there are some anti-american circlejerks . 
  but there are so many more pro-american circlejerks . 
  kinda makes sense given the userbase . 
   i hope you take a test flight on an extremely unwieldy experimental aircraft . 
  it 's the colloquial usage that is often seen here on reddit . 
  america seems extremely jingoist for most non-americans , in that all discussions tend to be american centred one way or another . 
  genuine question : do you think the us could defeat the combined forces of the eu in a war ? 
  what about china ? 
  i 'm not even sure what 's happening here ( other than the duck robot tatoo ) ... how did you get two kneeling titans inside a building ? 
  as far as i know , they are the world 's oldest stable borders . 
  but it gets more interesting if you understand how important that is , because being unable to expand in europe is the very reason portugal procured lands elsewhere , thus marking its fundamental role in modern history and setting the example for other expansion-locked countries like spain , england and the netherlands and creating the world as it is today . 
  what 's this picture from ? 
  looks awesome !, 
  why is this in / r/funny goddamnit !, 
  i had this very discussion with an egyptian last night : the arab world is the arab speaking world , according to them ; it is not about people or races . 
  from iran to morocco , all of it is the arab world . 
  ... i did , thanks and sorry for the brainfart . 
  edit : also , i replied to the wrong comment in the first place , wanted to respond to the one about morocco not being an arab country . 
  i 'm just gon na stop working on atmospheric wave functions for a bit ... 
  what mistake am i making ? 
  you just did a whole lot better job at explaining it : for all practical effects , it was an unified spain ( iberia , if you wish , as established by the catholic kings ) , as shown per the video map i posted , but in reality it was a bunch of relatively autonomous kingdoms all ruled by one king who did have , as you said , all his kingdoms in his title . 
  the portuguese borders , which was what i was talking about , did not change due to the union . 
  fair enough , independent was not the best choice of words . 
  i 'm not , it shows up in / r/all . 
  edit : actually , i was . 
  my mistake . 
  do you go to / r/titanfall ? 
  i could swear i heard that joke there , a week or two ago ... 
  anyway , vi no face , fiz upload porque achei piada , full circle etc. 
  if bangladesh was of sikh religion that would even be a sicker pun . 
  it 's okay , now you have a story to tell your grandkids :, 
  `` y' all wo n't believe me , but i once got gold and lots of karma for asking big girl lovers about some bbq . '', 
  yo momma so fat she russia . 
  but ... 
  most people do live on the coast . 
  what is the diagonal-lined giant area in the south , and why does it have no number ? 
  2 % of australia 's population is in the interior . 
  it has writing , it has the population of each county/area inside the yellow area . 
  2 % of australia lives inside the yellow region . 
  [ `` a portuguesa '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbn8yep4ba8 ) is mostly about portugal 's fundamental role in creating the modern world , but it as a relevant part that was created as response to the [ british ultimatum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_ultimatum ) in which our oldest ally trumped our sovereignity , so there 's also a bunch of references to offenses and cries of `` portugal revelant plz '' in it . 
  can read the lyrics [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a_portuguesa ) . 
  also , the foreigners of / r/portugal might enjoy it !, 
  madeira ( and the canary islands too ) are geographically part of africa , as they are situated in the african tectonic plate . 
  however , for all other purposes ( cultural , basically ) , they are very much considered part of europe . 
  was n't the only one , according to the chat . 
  what language is that map in ? 
  the very continent of europe is defined culturally ... 
  ah , there might be something lost in translation . 
  at least for myself , i 'm not saying the islands are of european culture but that they are traditionally considered part of europe . 
  depends on the perspective . 
  as a portuguese , this is how i would react to snow , any snow . 
  i have never woken up to a white landscape and i would fucking love to . 
  sure two days later i 'd probably be sick of it already , but ... 
  one of my favourite [ military marches ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_b0cyoao8y0 ) . 
  so naturally i had to make [ this ] ( http://gifsound.com/?gifv=zkfhqrj&amp;v=_b0cyoao8y0 ) ... 
  it 's been like that for forty years , not going anywhere anytime soon . 
  such is the alentejo . 
  the portuguese were at it for 80 years at the time of the discovery of the americas ... 
  that one in particular is from a link to the past , i believe .
