  put another red light with a police hat in it and the officer will be frozen . 
  maybe he disabled chat . 
  yes , but if german men freeze at the sight of a red light , would n't a german policeman freeze at the sight of a police red light ? 
  because it 's wrong , it 's something an american would learn as they never learn anything useful or true in school like doing taxes . 
  it would turn into a wedding joke . 
  as an esl , wtf is a nutt other than a surname , like google told me after i searched ? 
  but he said she 's not a female ... 
  douch\u00e9 ... 
  thanks !, 
  note to self : \u00a1 \u0250\u0131l\u0250\u0279\u0287sn\u0250 o\u0287 d\u0131\u0279\u0287 \u0250 \u029eooq, 
  actually has land in morocco . 
  ftfy, 
  ahh , o rasgan\u00e7o do traje ... 
   the uploader has not made this video available in your country . 
  i 'm not even german , what ? 
  do n't forget that it also declared victory . 
  there are a few [ here ] ( https://www.mediafire.com/folder/3bvdr0rjmbflp/titanfall ) . 
  holy shit so many stereotypes . 
  who is using ie in the third map for it to show in the legend ? 
  maybe , they say only old people use ie anymore . 
  we already did our job to the world , now we 're [ for ] the old and retired . 
  when have portugal and sweden been at war ? 
  yeah , like a german wwii veteran . 
   `` i think that if hollywood could just get past that bias , you would see more military blockbusters that celebrate american exceptionalism , selfless service , honor and integrity on the battlefield , and oh by the way , they 'd probably make hundreds of millions all at the same time , '' parnell said . 
  so we need more comedy !, 
  amazing how many people could n't see you were joking . 
  what 's up with that region of the world ? 
  is it genetic , cultural ? 
  you 've really ramped up op . 
  [ here it is at 2930 at 08:09 am gmt ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nven0dj.png ) ( my timezone ) . 
  holy shit i love that queen isabella !, 
  that 's a negative world . 
   that said , given the shit your ancestors have pulled on mine , i would rather live in a jewish state with bombs blowing up around me than in your state wondering if your kids will ever kill or expel my kids . 
  that is the stupidest thing i have read on reddit today . 
  you are stereotyping children over something that happened five hundred years ago . 
  clearly you have little to no experience of what the portuguese people are like . 
  but that 's okay , to be fair i have little to no experience of what the jewish people are like . 
  i 'm going to choose not to believe most jews feel the way you do , because i like to think people are rational . 
  any people . 
  but you know what they say about assholes , if you meet one , they 're the asshole , but if you meet many , maybe you 're the asshole . 
  let me guess , you read stuff online by highlighting several lines at a time ? 
  because you quoted something irrelevant that was probably highlighted somewhere . 
  but he was talking about the portuguese when he said our kids would kill or expel theirs . 
  yeah , sorry op but it 's been like that for a while . 
  now you know what i feel about half the us maps in here ... 
  what are those isles north of portugal/a \u00e7ores ? 
  and c royent in portugal ? 
  helps that you probably live in college campus . 
  migth as well post here while the thread is new :, 
  why are n't anti-vacinnes seen as a national security issue , under a health perspective , and thus the freedom argument loses weigth . 
  that argument is used for many other things , but not this . 
  which is actually an hazardous issue . 
  why ? 
  see , both / u/gwarster and your answers would be valid , but which one is the real one ? 
  the portuguese colonies were mostly from africa and brazil , which is now populated by african descendants for the most part . 
  so , yes , there are . 
  no , it 's still illegal to consume , but it is not considered a crime . 
  in other words , if you 're carrying drugs but under a certain limit , it will be confiscated and you will be shown some help centers , but you wo n't be jailed or anything . 
  things do change if you have more than you should though . 
  you have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  and ? 
  i will never understand why portugal is a rug in some of those ... 
  still not all drugs . 
  portugal is way cooler than the usa . 
  source : am portuguese . 
  best proof there is . 
  what 's with portugal having more than spain ? 
  is it because of the american base in the a\u00e7ores ? 
  i think my favourite clip is when you shot a cloaked guy in the giant vents on rise with the wingman by jumping over a ac vent ... 
  well , [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmmmfmoszws#t=106 ) , words ca n't describe it ... 
  foi a ver o layout do ultimo mail que mandou para o repetir que reparou naquilo . 
  yeah i get those a lot . 
  it 's awesome !, 
  more like a sitting duck . 
  you should add a scale so people have an idea what size it is . 
  i 'm afraid to say i 'm not really sure out of the blue ... 
  speaking of blue , is that babe ? 
  estar\u00e1s a falar [ disto ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/tinder/comments/23gvy0/its_hard_being_average_my_tinder_experiment/ ) . 
  edit : lembro-me porque o top comment apareceu no / r/bestof . 
  sorry , i meant a scale for the map !, 
  as a non-american , i do n't have the natural feel of how large minnesota is :d, 
  well it is by nestl\u00e9 so that makes sense . 
  should have opened a window , not a door ... 
  edit : [ wat ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0476298/ ), 
  that is one incredibly rectangular state . 
  the poor guy 's face ... 
  i guess elsewhere it 's fuckin ice ? 
  sombreros means sombreros , not hats specifically . 
  you asshole , why did you copy all of [ those ] ( http://www.dose.com/lists/2740/13-countries-summarized-accurately-in-one-sentence ) but forgot portugal ? 
  what did we do to you ? 
  here 's the runes :,

  syndey . 
  also , you really like people 's republics . 
  isto foi o mais antigo que encontrei , mas fair enough , sites de merda . 
  if time is infinite , infinite times . 
  huh , [ so it seems ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/sombrero ) . 
  i stand corrected , shame on me for not knowing this . 
  yes !, 
  i am from portugal and occasionally i travel to spain .
