  mas ali est\u00e1 fast and serious . 
  yeah you 're right , op doomed the titan then its pilot killed himself . 
  true , but the title mentions leaving the parents ' house . 
  if you buy your own house and move your parents in , that 's different . 
  both parking lots are on the east side . 
  should have payed attention in school . 
  it was a portuguese school . 
  ah that 's a whole different story . 
  they did n't , or ` paid ' for that matter .

  how much wine is $ 20 ?

   we did ' t do that in a mean-spirited way . 
  we will change the image as soon as possible . 
  sorry for the misunderstanding . 
  real men cry , not because they are insecure , but because there is no cod in the table . 
  i use km/h all the time and i also did n't know it was offensive to some . 
  only if you consider you have more experience and kill more things , faster .

  what 's with the scratches/lines in a few countries ? 
  madagascar , turkey , argentina , paraguay , a bit of brazil , saudi arabia , iran . 
  because i can die as many times as i want in titanfall and still get my reward ( titan/core build ) . 
  relative to what ?

   @swagginbicthezz as a portuguese : ouch !, 
  as a 9gager : nice !, 
  it really is n't so i 'm not sure why it is even linked . 
  ah portugal . 
  never change . 
  not sure how that is an argument against car reliance . 
  noticed that as well but it seems like a mistake , it seems [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dsagbkw.jpg ) map was done first and they forgot to change colours when changing units . 
  was wondering what kind of gas this is ... 
  thus sweden would rely less on public transportation and more on cars ... 
  is it me or is that stryder using a charge rifle in the last image ? 
  [ so it does ] ( http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/titanfall/thumb/c/cd/titanfall_vortex_shield.jpg/468px-titanfall_vortex_shield.jpg ) . 
  i need to use it more often ... 
  is this a xbone issue only ? 
  i have never crashed in the game before , except for some weird issues , but they were n't related to angel city . 
  i , on the other hand , wo n't be buying it if it does not have the smart pistol . 
  before you downvote me , let me tell you why :, 
  i have a mild hand tremor issue . 
  it is no big deal in usual day-to-day activity , but it is terrible if i want to play fps . 
  my precision in aiming is awful . 
  thus , titanfall is the first fps i have been able to play , because of sp and triple threat . 
  i would n't mind if it was nerfed somehow , if lock sounds were introduced , or it took more time . 
  i would in fact welcome it because it really is easy to use . 
  but i still ca n't play with other guns no matter how many times i have tried . 
  it took me months to get to gen 4 before i gave up with the sniper challenge . 
  dunno , how do i check that ? 
  still , on titanfall , it is slightly ahead of the little mark on the options . 
  less than that , and it seems like i just got to work on a friday . 
  but yes , i tried messing with sensitivity to see if i could aim better . 
  i kinda can , but then i ca n't parkourfor shit ...

  $ 65 for four drinks ? 
  that just seems abysmal to me , but fair enough , the market is the market . 
  where is okcupid metro ? 
  juraasic park obliterated my dinosaur hype because it scared the shit out of me ... 
  but only if done by their current partner , not a random hobo in the streets ... 
  in this case , it is work . 
  they were paid to wear that . 
  not ocean tiles , no , but what about coast tiles ? 
  segunda is the feminine form of second , yes , but feira is an old form for holiday ( currently feriado ) . 
  it 's an old move by the portuguese catholics to change the name of the days from pagan latin names to sacred days . 
  basically , it goes as domingo ( day of the lord ) - second holy day - third hd - ( ... ) - sixth holy day - s\u00e1bado ( sabath ), 
  oil 's going back to the ocean , says the guy with the oversized fuel burning machine ... 
  fuck rating agencies and all their bias . 
  most of those were based on portuguese inventions , which were upgrades of arabic inventions . 
  the question is n't ambiguous at all . 
  the scientific investment was done by portugal , spain stole most of it and did a few improvements . 
   there are virtually no goliath groupers left in the world . 
  but ... http://np.reddit.com/r/wtf/comments/35nl16/goliath_grouper_fish_swallows_5_foot_shark_in_a/, 
  why is there so much water in the toilet in the first place ? 
  not for a century or two they did n't . 
  the british ruled the late age of sail , sure , but not for a long while . 
  the portuguese population at the beginning of the age of discovery was roughly 1 million strong . 
  that is not an overpopulated country , believe me . 
  heck , it 's still just 11 million nowadays and it still is n't overpopulated . 
  i pride myself in knowing quite a lot of stuff about my country 's history and the monroe doctrine really is n't one of them . 
  in fact , kids do n't get taught about it at all . 
  why would they ? 
  no one forgets that . 
  thank you for spelling it properly . 
  it 's not the size , but the population that mattered . 
  the reason portugal did not colonise too much is because it just did n't have the population for it . 
  the spanish were n't so bad so they managed to gain holds on a lot of america . 
  that , and they fucked a lot of natives , in all senses . 
  what about railgun ? 
  i read the b in womb , but nothing in the end of room . 
  is that not correct ( esl ) ? 
  portuguese *, 
  that is a lot of different ships .
