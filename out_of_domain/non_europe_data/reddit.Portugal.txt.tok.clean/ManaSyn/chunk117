  property ownership is a bit outdated , given nowadays tremendous weight of pure financial business , no ? 
  it 's still bloody gigantic , that thing . 
  i would n't say that , since most parents are still at work , some put their kids in vacation camps , and they do visit the place . 
  is n't that why you go to a brothel in the first place ? 
  out of curiosity , how do you measure household energy consumption where you are from ? 
   europe may be a better place because they are n't prone to earthquakes . 
  some of europe is less prone to earthquakes than the rest , some is more . 
  that 's a weird generalization . 
  everyone , it just usually takes a few decades . 
  no it is n't . 
  56 years since ben hur . 
  cuecas cr7 ? 
   articles related to the country portugal or portuguese people in the world only . 
  sure , they 're the water cooling pipes . 
  it 's not really random to be honest . 
  there 's a lot of comments in reddit saying that usa is huge and europeans ca n't grasp how big the usa is . 
  i mean , uncalled for , yes , definitely , but not that random . 
  who is n't ? 
   world ocean, 
  i do n't know why but i love that name . 
   we 're leading the fucking world in military strikes yet again . 
  i thought france was the strike champion . 
  if i recall correctly you can return the 50 cents rechargeable card and get that money back . 
  not 100 % sure though , never used it in my life . 
  since you mention portuguese ( velocidade ) , the correct word for speed would be rapidez , but velocidade is indeed colloquially used very often ( maximum speed in roads , etc ) . 
  also . 
  claro que \u00e9 racismo , lol . 
  this does not make sense to me . 
  how can there be counties without majority ? 
  do they have equal percentage of two ethnic people ? 
  or is majority defined as  50 % in the us ? 
  that would make sense . 
  ah well . 
  there 's that wales/new zealand heavy density we all expected . 
  wait , who wrote that text , ricardo or her ? 
  the former would only show ricardo is interested , it would n't really mean much as long as she said no ( which is good ) . 
  the latter would mean she is interested , and that is n't good whatever the translation means . 
  i do n't think so , no . 
  `` it would be good to go to the caribbean '' does not mean you have already been there , for instance . 
  it 's just something you would like to do . 
  i mean , i can definitely see what you mean , but i would n't jump into conclusions .

  yeah ... 0 c is already very cold to me . 
  i keep telling myself i need to watch this movie but keep forgetting . 
  what is it called ? 
  por favor ... 
  i think people are forgetting an important detail here : the gay culture and behaviour . 
  if you behave like a normal ( read : average ) person , just living your life normally , no one will give a shit who you are attracted to . 
  however , if you [ have ] ( http://dioguinho.pt/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/josecastelobranco20121.jpg ) [ a ] ( http://cdn.controlinveste.pt/storage/dn/2012/big/ng1950504.jpg ) [ flamboyant ] ( http://static.globalnoticias.pt/storage/jn/2014/big/ng3061488.jpg ) [ attitude ] ( http://cdn.flashvidas.pt/2015-01/img_650x412$2015_01_21_14_43_01_92177.jpg ) that runs away from normal standards , you will feel everyone gazing upon you . 
  but this holds true whatever your sexual orientation is ; the man i linked is a famous portuguese socialite who is , as far as he and his marriage says , not gay . 
  disclaimer : percebo pouco de economia , 
  why is this guy being downvoted . 
  while it is not on the same level of touradas or hanging on to a live goose till it dies , getting shot is also a pretty shocking thing . 
  ca n't mouseover on mobile . 
  firefly . 
  just a note , next time do n't post it ending in . jpg , change the extension in url to gifv , loads much faster . 
  someone posted a much larger version a few hours ago :, 
  he clearly should not be talking on his phone like that . 
   we think before you visit a country , you should know what to eat when you get there . 
   so we would like to tell you of some dishes ...

  a dead man produces no wealth . 
  or the wrong styrofoam . 
  99 % de que ? 
  de volume ? 
  mount olympus is indeed an actual place , but it is a mountain range rather than a single mountain . 
  to be fair , columbus is also only really remembered out of sheer american patriotism . 
   strong irish heritage, 
   3 generations removed, 
  what . 
  due to your experience in mozambique and timor-leste , i have to wonder : do you speak portuguese , or how do you communicate with the locals ? 
  where in denmark is 18c ? 
  immigration minus emigration . 
  + / u/user _ simulator / u/manasyn, 
  now i want to play negative titanfall ... 
  that is true for every part of the world . 
  i have waited for the original op ( / u/nobandy ) to post here , but since he is n't doing so and i 'm bloody curious about it , i did it myself . 
  i titled it as a x-post from portugal in case that helps , and because that was all the information op gave us there . 
  he also posted this :, 
   no , the only thing that it has is the number 3 in one leg and the number 2 in the other ... 
  this is a thread about trolls , witch is why their auto-correct chose ogre . 
  no problem at all , if you want to do it yourself go ahead , pm me afterwards and i 'll delete this one . 
  otherwise try to give as much information as possible to help others . 
  that does not mean everything is exceptionally difficult . 
  come francesinhas . 
  we could call them by their country as well , like the late zimbabwe cecil , khenia dumbo , etc. 
  would work great for chad . 
  likewise , we do n't really joke about the spaniards , but rather about south portugal as well ( alentejo ) . 
  \u00c9 preciso ter os updates activados ? 
  they are n't protecting you , they 're protecting the money .
