  why must there always been someone like you trying to go for le gem easy karma ? 
  stop it already , it has n't been funny for two years . 
  that is true and i agree , but so is the obvious karma-grabbing of `` dae le gem '' . 
   i intend to kill them . 
   it 's assholes like him that make people like me look bad . 
  yeah . 
  okay . 
  e [ este peixinho ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/man-of-war_fish ) ? 
  that little fish should be named portuguese sailor , tbh . 
  little quick thinking bastard !, 
  [ you got that right !, 
  esl here , am i missing something ? 
  edit : ah , hate to see your face ? 
  i did n't , or else i 'd post it under [ oc ] . 
  i got it from / r/europe . 
  if both days are at the same temperature and the same humidity , then the dew point is the same . 
  but if they feel different , is mostly because of wind/radiation you 're feeling than actual water content . 
  in other words , your sweat cools you by `` stealing '' energy to evaporate . 
  now , if there 's no wind , your evaporated sweat will stay close to you ( in other words , water content close to you is actually higher ) and it gets harder for more sweat to evaporate . 
  if there is wind , the evaporated sweat is blown away and you can cool a bit more . 
  actually , if i recall correctly , it is a rather ingenious way to cool yourself . 
  you see , our body cools by evaporating sweat ( evaporation requires a lot of energy ) . 
  the problem is that , once evaporated , it is n't coming back , and you would need to drink a lot of water to keep cooling yourself . 
  those clothes , however , do not let water vapour go away and they basically serve as a way for water to condensate and fall back into your skin , thus renewing the process . 
  that way , those clothes allow you to cool down many times using less water . 
  as a bonus , there are small temperature/pressure gradients around the person that allows for some small air currents which also help cooling down . 
  of course , it is n't perfect , but there 's actually a reason for the desert clothing . 
  you 're looking at it . 
  this is how . 
  it 's intensive work in the peak of mediterranean summer . 
  it does not . 
  true , but not the cork oak . 
  nope . 
  it will only stop further evaporation if it remains in the air . 
  the key is that it actually condensates in the clothing . 
  but sure , i could be wrong . 
  yes , cork is a multi-generational investment . 
  my father planted a few years ago and i wo n't be seeing any money from them for a few decades . 
  but their full worth will only be going for my children , and a few generations after . 
  it 's nine years minimum , lower than that and the bark is just too thin . 
  of course it depends on the tree , but i do n't think i 've ever seen any that grows that fast . 
  well , corkboards are made from waste anyway . 
  but good quality cork has been unfortunately [ decreasing in price ] ( http://www.saomarcosdaserra.com/resources/prijs%20kurk%20grafiek1.png ) ^ ^ [ 1 ] mostly because of plastic competition . 
   got ta kill the myths and make sure people are informed it is a healthy , sustainable industry !, 
  cork oak trees vary greatly in shape and size . 
  this is as efficient as it gets , as machines ca n't really be used . 
  da\u00ed a thread . 
  fair enough , obrigado . 
  boa !, 
  okay , now next time i see a parade i am going to think of every single men standing there moving their bottocks around . 
  you know taste may differ to due to condiments , cooking method , rice quality and type . 
  you have to be a bit more specific , please .

  edit : ah well , devia estar a trabalhar , mas pronto . 
  while alho means garlic and it could be linked , the truth is different :, 
  cock , even . 
  if it 's used like this it gives much enthusiasm to the first word - see / r/portugalcaralho , our circlejerk . 
  do not order bitoque caralho in restaurants unless you are very enthusiastic about it ( you should ) and you do n't mind the weird looks . 
  yep !, 
  parents play a fundamental role , for sure , but it is n't just them . 
  there are some of us who just get absolutely no joy from sports , and that 's okay . 
  what is n't okay is how society portraits them as loners and outcasts . 
  i 'm kinda preaching to the choir here on reddit , but seeing everyone enjoying `` normal '' stuff and picking on you , or just simply acting surprised that you do n't appreciate it , like you are n't normal or something , takes its tolls trough the years , as if you just do n't belong . 
  we , as a society , really need to work on improving our tolerance and understanding that different people are different and that 's okay . 
  try good cheese then .

  well i most certainly am at the moment . 
  literally . 
  what is it and reading reddit so much in the loo ? 
  i guess it beats the shampoo bottles . 
  wal-mart is n't ubiquitous , it barely exists outside the us , if at all . 
  facebook , on the other hand ... 
  that 's hilarious to me for some reason i can not explain ... 
  ha ha !, 
  i 've soloed it once ( i think , maybe someone else was shooting but i do n't think so ) . 
  started spamming triple threat , fired cluster missile and electric smoke , reloaded , continue shooting while doing the eject sequence , nuke and a final archer missile did it . 
  english question , actually : is n't the bull a more generic name for male ? 
  elephant bull , etc. 
  depends on the conditions . 
  you can go as far as having only a battlecruiser and still be in the game . 
  both are correct , but in european portugueses cobarde is the one used .
