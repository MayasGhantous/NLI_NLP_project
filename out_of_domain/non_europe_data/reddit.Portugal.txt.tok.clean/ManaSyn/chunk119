  they charge for anything outside the basic 1 cabin bag + 1 seat . 
  you wo n't be getting anything else for free but the truth is , you do n't need it . 
  they 'll even charge you if you forgot to print your ticket at home . 
  but that 's okay , because there 's a smartphone app anyway . 
  how expensive is a beer usually ? 
  1 $ for a beer down here in portugal is already on the top side ... 
  ryanair is great . 
  i mean , it 's low-cost so of course it is n't super confortable , but they get the job done and on time . 
  i flew with them some ten times already and not once was my flight delayed or arrived late .

  holy shit !, 
  hah , what about that little song they play at the end of the trip ? 
  i laugh every time for how silly it is :, 
  edit : esquece , [ encontrei ] ( http://www.cm-alcobaca.pt/pt/destaques/2208/aljubarrota-medieval.aspx ) . 
  portugal discovered brazil , and for some reason brazil does n't cover portugal . 
  no wonder toyota is the strongest car producer in the world . 
  i love my hiace and my hilux < 3, 
  bot fail . 
  this is n't an image of indiana . 
  no caso da guerra dos tronos , o cereal killer \u00e9 o autor . 
  is the reporter 's creation saying `` kill me '' ? 
  leave that pc bullcrap out of history books . 
  what portugal and other nations actually discovered were the routes to many places . 
  we know there were humans there before , it does n't matter . 
  why did i bother answering . 
  obvious is ... 
  it 's an insecurity thing . 
  do n't worry , women do n't do that . 
  actually ... 
   pride in one 's country ... 
  patriotism . 
   ... and fuck everyone else . 
  nationalism . 
  i fully agree with you ( you had to have a guy from portugal in it , did n't you ? 
  :( ) , but for the next time you should pay attention if the guy you 're responding to is n't an obvious troll as not to waste your time with it . 
  that is the whole premise of the american dream . 
  that 's why you see it so much on reddit . 
  but even they make fun of it with the occasional `` just stop being poor '' sarcastic comment . 
  i just clicked op link on my computer and installed it on my phone and tablet from there ... 
  well it most certainly is n't intelligent design , i 'll give you that . 
  maybe it 's even evolution at work . 
  for those who wonder , 20 feet is about 6 metres . 
  that 's a huge fish !, 
  hey that 's awesome , thanks !, 
  generally called delta formation , not flying v. 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hel_ ( being ), 
  in some languages , there is the netherlands , sure , but everyone calls ot holland . 
  other way around i bet . 
  well he is chad ... 
   dress respectfully while not being culturally approprative . 
  what does that mean ? 
  it should be noted that everything in this thread only holds true for brasilian portuguese . 
  have n't been paying attention , what changes in the expansion ? 
  i ca n't search rigth now ( on mobile ) but search for something called `` p\u00e9rolas do dragonball '' or similar on youtube . 
  it is n't the entre series or anything , it is just a collection of many examples of the ( rather liberal ) portugueses translation . 
  edit : here , i knew i had posted it before . 
  \u00c9 por causa do s\u00edndrome do rebanho . 
  why did that site just try to check for my browser ? 
  dunno if i can report bugs to you , but the mod lacks formation shortcut and gunship corvettes have strange behaviours in it , they leave formation if the entire strike group is ordered to attack from afar . 
  espero que a encontrem . 
  it was single player i did , yes , but a game vs one cpu , not campaign . 
  anyway , i maxed out all ships , grouped them all under one strike group and ordered an attack . 
  what usually happens is that all units move at the speed of the slowest ship ( this case , a battlecruiser ) and upon reaching a certain range , they resume normal speed and engage . 
  not this time : the gunships immediatly left formation and went on intercept course at full speed from far away . 
  as for formation shortcut , the meant the f keys for capital phalanx , figther screen , wall , etc. 
  but none is active . 
  will do , thanks !, 
  fuck you if you think i 'm gon na ask for dick pics for karma . 
  it 's the other way around . 
  one ding , three shames . 
  edit : nvm , i derped . 
  this is totally unrelated , but i have this auto-converter extension which is very helpful in threads like this one , filled with imperial units . 
  however , sometimes things do get a [ bit funny ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nmypqi2.png ) ... 
  yeah but you 're on reddit now , who knows what wonderful adventures that kid is living now ? 
  failed to send email with code activation . 
  please try again . 
  we have [ those ] ( http://www.aborim.pt/uploads/images/noticias/sede%20da%20junta/img00041-20110921-1833.jpg ) in portugal , but they only exist in major malls so they are n't that common ... 
  the idea is that people get rid of the old ones in the same trip they 'd go buy new ones , tho . 
  as an european , a daily commute of 160 km sounds fucking insane . 
  portugal should have been marked as not english too :(, 
  do n't be daft , he 's spanish , nuestro hermano , of course he 's interested in portugal . 
  should it not be castille and le\u00f3n , not leon and galicia ? 
   you speak spanish , you should be able to understand portuguese better . 
  yeah right . 
  this is probably a shitty source but i looked it up because of how it works in my own language and , it seems , english :, 
   an [ airport ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/airport ) is an [ aerodrome ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aerodrome ) with facilities for commercial aviation flights to take off and land . 
  in my opinion the map is wrong because it mixes aerodromes and airports , but yeah , not sure how it works in english . 
  sure , i understand that . 
  city dynamics are just very different in our continents with how suburbs are built . 
  i commute some 5 miles and i already get bored everyday ... 
  it was a joke , but for whatever matters , it is also the spelling in portuguese . 
  it was a jest at how spain has the non-english marker ( es , i know ) . 
  do n't worry , it was a bad joke . 
  and i think you are confused because of the word for port , porto in portuguese and puerto in spanish . 
  porto is also a city in portugal and , together with its twin city , gaia , is where the name for the country comes from . 
  they transport energy ( and mass ) from one place to another . 
  windows 8.1 , chrome , username sem caracteres especiais , password com caracteres especiais ( pontua\u00e7\u00e3o ) . 
  yes , i would expect the major metropolises of the blue banana to have large commutes . 
  public transportation in europe is much more widespread than in the us , as well .
