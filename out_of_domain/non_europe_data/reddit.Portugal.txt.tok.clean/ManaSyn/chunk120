  here in portugal they are kind of a non-issue ... 
  some towns are proclaiming they welcome them , but that 's all . 
  that was great , and there were so many things i did n't know about : titan shotgun , they were making a single player campaign after all , a giant earthquake weapon that actually explains fracking . 
  great share . 
  yes , being on the opposite side of europe does help . 
  their moms do , at least . 
  same can be said for the night owls to be honest . 
  the bulk of refugees are coming from syria and eritreia , and are crossing the mediterranean illegally . 
  well ... til . 
  500 $ is about 445 $ . 
  not quite the same . 
   i 'd like to see them try : i 'm the ultimate internet tough guy and i 've got like 60k comment karma . 
  they would n't stand a chance !, 
  do n't think nobody has seen this , i have . 
  keep it up dude . 
  summer was n't very good for me either but i 'm gon na try fix that now as well . 
  also , beer is n't that bad for weight , it is what you eat with it that is usually the problem . 
  soda is far , far worse . 
  what 's up at 1:47 ? 
  seems like a random clip out of nowhere . 
  selective breeding ! = inbreeding . 
  why would you use mph and m/s ? 
  sounds inconsistent to have different units of time . 
  there are only three major airports in continental portugal . 
  / r/keming, 
  that was a brain fart , i meant to say media sound , sorry . 
  either way , that 's the problem . 
  i have no media running , i even just now tried and restarted the phone to make sure nothing was open , and tried the button - it still gives me the media sound . 
  it 's not . 
  wind is usually measured in km/h for metric people . 
  unless you 're talking about a scientific medium where wind is measured in m/s regardless of imperial or metric orientation . 
  a national weather agency is a scientific medium . 
  check a website made for normal people . 
  i tried weather.com and got [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zqhe1b7.png ) . 
  it 's not very important either way , it 's easy enough to convert from m/s to km/h ( just multiply by 3.5 and that 's close enough ) , it 's just odd . 
  i do n't disagree with that myself , but i hope you realize that is 100 % a cultural convention . 
  may not hold true in other cultures . 
  for some people , trusting in others is the respectful thing to do . 
  and i do n't see anything wrong with that . 
  that 's my point exactly . 
  edit : isto aos 30 . 
  emigrantes *, 
  we get a bit offended if you use spanish , we read it as if you think we are the same . 
  i mean , we wo n't hit you for it , but i would advise against it . 
  to avoid that confusion is the very reason i mentioned he wo n't get hit by it ... 
  the borgia were spanish tho . 
  well them , find us those statistics for all the ~ 200 countries in the world . 
  but there are a lot of bodies to notice . 
  post traumatic served dance . 
  i do n't believe you , that looks proper american , not international at all !, 
  o auto-correct . 
  you 're french . 
  unrelated , but rego is portuguese for ass crack . 
  ... i do n't know why i said this . 
  you would have to be completly retarded not to . 
  well that 's the first time i hear about americans and gypsy discrimination ( or lack of it ) . 
  i thought templars were the bad guys . 
  captain america should have been an assassin to bring fair justice to all those towel heads like the real america . 
  other than the very obvious fact , i do n't understand the point of your post . 
  the rethoric is common , the intention however is sarcastic and not to be taken seriously . 
  fair enough ; i was referencing assassin 's creed , where the templar order is the antagonist . 
  ah , fair enough . 
  lol, 
  the lion king . 
  memories . 
  portugal : we do exist . 
  same , but then it clicked that it was a building !, 
  e , claro , interesses do dito cujo . 
  we 'll still see a redeemed sargeras or corrupted titans . 
  wait , you went to macau or hong kong ? 
  they 're completely different cities , albeit close . 
  hope you and your wife enjoy the place !, 
  check [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/bitoquecaralho/top/ ) for reasons to stay . 
  who put the mines there ? 
  or rather , who gave you the maps with the information ? 
   we work to live not live to work . 
  this right here is the difference between southern and northern ( european , but american too it seems ) . 
  i wonder if it is because of temperature . 
  it says on imgur she 's english , right above her name . 
  what does that matter , tho ? 
  edit : it was a genuine question ... 
  ketchup and mustard for me !, 
  fair enough , apaguei .

  notas :, 
  in english , it would be '' * someone with whom i could exchange * '' vs '' * someone that could exchange * '' . 
  bit of a nitpick maybe . 
  * in english , letters means both the characters from the alphabet and slow-mail . 
  not the same in portuguese : the characters are called '' * letras * '' , and you send '' * cartas * '' to other people . 
  in english , '' * the * '' antecipates pretty much every noun and you can only tell its gender ( and oft its number ) from context . 
  if it sounds complicated , you could think of as , in english , '' * the man did it * '' vs '' * a man did it * '' . 
  * the last sentence , albeit not completely incorrect , usually has a bit more information added . 
  i 'll be doing further review a bit later , i have to go out for lunch . 
  food is sacred here !, 
  edit, 
  segunda frase :, 
  most mistakes here are fixable in english too , ie , `` mozambique is a country where they speak portuguese '' rather than `` mozambique is a country that speaks portuguese '' . 
  i hope you do n't mind that i try and correct grammar instead of sticking to portuguese .
