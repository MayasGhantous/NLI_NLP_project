  como \u00e9 que o idioma se simplifica ? 
  find the subject/object in the sentence and , unless it is a pronoum like i , you , he , she , this , that , etc , put the article just before it . 
  in your case , the object would be would be `` meu portugu\u00eas '' , which is what you 're praticing . 
  do mind that in brazilian portuguese they not always use it like we do in portugal . 
  indeed , they would not add the article in the sentences above . 
  it is n't off . 
  it states very well that this is from the la atunara port ( which is indeed northeast of gibraltar ) and mentions fishermen going to protest an artificial reef in the bay of algeciras . 
  yes , not england . 
  well it must be the first time in history someone confuses spanish for portuguese rather than the other way around ... 
  edit, 
  but he is using the expression correctly , in the meaning that if science was funded in australia , there would be many new things . 
  `` pelos '' is the conjuntion of `` por '' ( for ) and `` os '' ( plural masculine form of the ) . 
  said like that you almost make it sound like they 're nearby or something . 
  not true . 
  appropriate username . 
  we ^ ^ ^ 1 the bones ^ ^ ^ 2 that ^ ^ ^ 3 are ^ ^ ^ 4 here ^ ^ ^ 5 for ^ ^ ^ 6 yours ^ ^ ^ 7 await ^ ^ ^ 8, 
  note that `` aqui estamos '' and `` are here '' are inverted due to how the different portuguese and english grammars work . 
  woah there , no need to insult the cunt for a joke : /, 
  2 days donation for / r/millionairemakers '', 
  yeah it was an intersting tour of an american city to me . 
  your username does n't sound italian ... 
  nothing , for two reasons : our food is both great and unknown to foreigners . 
  pizza is italian . 
  there is no debate . 
  pizza is italian . 
  surrogate for bread and circus . 
  mas boa sorte com o survey . 
  what gets more than a half-assed chuckle in germany other than 100 ballons ? 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auereqe2rgs ) does sound like german humour to me ... 
  please take a deep breath and calm the fuck down . 
  if the brain gets no blood , it shuts down and the victim stops fighting . 
  well he does have children . 
  really ? 
  is that how it 's spelt in engish ? 
  it is n't even the same sound , fernando poe would be closer . 
  bees are the best way to pollinate your crop , most farmers worth their salts want to attract bees . 
  serious question , i read somewhere on reddit that most you would ever pay in the us is something like 7000 $ , is that true ?

  [ thanks bro ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-d9kcek5x_ve/tmv03plcqci/aaaaaaaag4g/gjnljakib2q/s1600/cristianoronaldo_de_bigode_20100427-300x225.jpg ) . 
  i feel i should add this as the service was very good :, 
  i seldom buy things online but i purchased their map as i love the roman empire . 
  the first map that arrived was not in good conditions due to transportation so i sent an email about it and , after taking about 20 mins to respond , they sent me another one , free of charge . 
  now , i should add that i was one of the first buyers and the guy who answered me said he was still practicing packaging so that may not work next time , but nevertheless , my review stays : awesome map , awesome service . 
  the roman culture still has a very strong influence in the world : catholicism . 
  indeed , and p\u00f3 is read , as i said , with a strong acute o. 
  like the o in porn . 
   the new map shows the persian empire and the mediterranean world during the reign of king dareios i. 
  ( 522 -- 486 bce ) , when the power of the achaemenids peaked . 
  was wondering when the persians got to iberia . 
  edit : woops , wrong reply button . 
  actually , the [ kingdom of iberia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_iberia ) was founded after the fall of the [ persian empire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/achaemenid_empire ) . 
  socialized healthcare in a nutshell , too . 
  to be fair , tipping is an odd thing to do in most of the world . 
  some places embrace it , others are insulted by it , but for most it 's just a neutral thing . 
  well what made you reach that difficult conclusion ? 
  til countries can fuck off . 
  a good bottle of wine can go as cheap as 2 $ around here . 
  it 's odd they named belgium but went lazy with portugal . 
  not really . 
  as a top example , [ this ] ( http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/life/food/wine/article4494187.ece ) article names a good portuguese cheap wine . 
  actual good , not just drinkable . 
  and while the price in the uk is ~ 6.50 $ , you could buy it portugal for [ 1.95 $ ] ( http://www.nit.pt/article/07-23-2015-o-vinho-do-verao-esta-no-lidl-e-custa-menos-de-2euro ) ( article in portuguese but the price is in the title ) . 
  evidently not all of them are that cheap or that good , but , as i said , a good wine can go as cheap as 2 $ . 
  5 $ -10 $ and you 're already paying too much .

  [ here ] ( http://www.keepeek.com/digital-asset-management/oecd/social-issues-migration-health/international-migration-outlook-2014/portugal_migr_outlook-2014-34-en#page2 ) 's some data corroborating your point . 
  did you find it [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/reference-data/administrative-units-statistical-units ) by any chance ? 
  nevermind , [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/statistics-illustrated ) 's an interactive map with nuts 1 , 2 and 3 . 
  to remove the colours , go to the wrench , indicator filter , and just hit the button under nuts ( not sure what it does , but it does remove the colours ) . 
  i think [ po\u00e7a dona beija ] ( http://www.pocadadonabeija.com/ ) is better than that now that they built something nice around there . 
  write english , please , this post hurt my eyes , it 's too early for this shit . 
  anyway , i doubt you can . 
  are you neglecting the effect a crisis in the rich economies can have in the poorer countries ? 
  he wants us debt to china canceled . 
  communist party of china ? 
  what the fuck , any american worth the name keeps a gun close to their heart ( or others , if the situation arises ) !, 
  that 's just being rude . 
  what do you think you 'll accomplish with it ? 
  you could get a home for 40k in some backwater town . 
  not in the country 's second largest city . 
  fucking hell , i slept over it ... 
  it peaked at 3 am around here and my alarm clock did n't go off . 
  why did it have to be monday :(, 
  audi 's a part of the vw group .

  i 'd rather a 1000000000000000000000 . 
  why is it strange ? 
  thanks , was wondering how much that was . 
  i reckon it is a lot more expensive than just to out to the club in czech republic . 
  do n't you need a knife to gut someone ? 
  how strong are their claws ?
