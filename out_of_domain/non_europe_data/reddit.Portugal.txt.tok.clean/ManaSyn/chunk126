  it means ten is a number smaller than the number of wars . 
  so a vietnamese business conference then ? 
   a keyword `` sofware '' devolve 1835 resultados . 
  hmm ... 
  you could try the lower floors of [ f\u00e1brica do bra\u00e7o de prata ] ( http://www.bracodeprata.com/ ) . 
  it 's not the ocean that warms europe , it 's canada that cools north america . 
  huh , that is odd ... 
  anyway , [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgzhtkdazzo ) 's the video source !, 
  africans enslaved them for the most part , they sold their own people . 
  white people are n't one people either ... 
  i have now . 
  you see that because you are biased against it . 
  your anecdote is hardly true . 
  what about now existing a database linking our real names with our reddit usernames ? 
  well , commenting because required . 
  good luck for everyone . 
  they are waves but not that kind . 
  those are simple gravitational waves where the particles move in a circular way but are not transported . 
  this is not the case as water is indeed transported . 
  and people . 
  what about indie gaming ? 
  and a vespa and we get a well evaluated model !, 
  altamente . 
  i do n't mean to sound disrespectful , but could anyone kinda translate what happened ? 
  i can not understand that accent : /, 
  so what you 're saying that 's why we never heard of galaxy wars ? 
  i really ca n't tell if this is about australia or canada ... 
  can confirm , got [ this ] ( https://dl.pushbulletusercontent.com/zokqzvvqpoqg54tra3jisz0giq6dnfs9/screenshot_2015-11-02-15-51-02.png ) open up out of nowhere . 
  it has happened three times already in the last three days . 
  thus , unless it comes from reddit itself , that ca n't be true as i 've visited many sites during that time . 
  this is no acute accent in norte , just letting you know . 
  not really , was n't expecting that backlash ... 
  i really had no clue what that was about ... 
  i can understand the feeling , it is similar when my own country ( portugal ) is confused with its bigger neighbour ( spain ) . 
  that said , i had only heard of marmite or vegemite when talking about australia ( i still have no idea what it is ) , yet everyone was so friendly . 
  i guess that 's new zealand then !, 
  piece of advice as i know a few ex-pats who do this :, 
  live in portugal , work online ; get paid as being in us/uk/germany . 
  trust me , condition of life in portugal is lower in nothing to those countries except in price . 
  sorry mate . 
  [ por exemplo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijy3aw_yj_a ) . 
  i 'm not sure you will be able to find work at a cork farm . 
  at least as a cork harvester . 
  it is a somewhat delicate job that requires the skill not to hurt the trees . 
  that said you could also help build the cork stacks ( for lack of better word ) , ie , gather the harvested cork and put it in a stack . 
  no , portugal . 
  and greece , i guess . 
  from [ here ] ( http://www.priceoftravel.com/1979/european-backpacker-index ) :, 
   how the backpacker index works, 
   prices for most things ( hostels , transportation , attractions ) are fixed and certain , but prices for a `` budget lunch '' or a pint of beer can vary depending on where you go . 
  still , our estimates are based on a lot of research , and should be very close if not right on . 
   costs for each city, 
   * one night in the cheapest bunk at the least expensive hostel with a good location and good reviews, 
  * two public transportation rides per day, 
   * one paid/famous attraction per day ( every city is loaded with free things to do for budget-conscious travelers , but here we take the average cost of a major attraction in each city for each day . ), 
   * three `` budget '' meals per day ( we took our minimum meal price and added 20 % to make it more realistic for a longer trip ) . 
   * three cheap , local beers ( or wine ) each day as an `` entertainment fund . '' non-drinkers might have dessert and coffee or attend a local music performance instead , so this is a general benchmark that should be proportional for each city . 
  still it 's probably rather badly made . 
  i can only really speak for lisbon , but three budget meals for 17 $ is waaay too much , as is three cheap , local beers for 9 $ . 
  you can get one beer for 0.50 $ ... 
  and '' \u00e3o '' to `` on '' like c\u00e3o to perro . 
  it 's not obvious at all to me . 
  no idea a 24 pack was a case ... 
  have n't play civ in a while , which one 's the pog ? 
  ah , right . 
  cheers !, 
  the game itself is on sale ; i bought the game plus both dlc for 13.5 $ , cool stuff !, 
  there 's an even new promotion for 11 $ , heh . 
   i know military wise the eu cant hold up to the us, 
  what do you mean ? 
  that does not convince me . 
  the eu has more population . 
  numbers are n't that important . 
  it 's a hard discussion that one , and would highly depend on the circumstances , but to lightly underestimate the eu is a bit rushed . 
  if the war was domestic , the invader would always lose ( ie , eu would fail to invade the us and vice-versa ) , if it was n't , that would depend on power projection and , while the us has a lot of bases around the world , the eu is much closer to the most vital points on earth . 
  it 's at 11.20 $ now , what price do you get and what region ? 
  yeah ? 
  the us has a bigger army and the eu has more population . 
  it is not about numbers . 
  i understand the argumenta and i still stand for what i said . 
  if history has taugth us anything , is that numbers are not enough to establish an obvious victor . 
  mind you , i 'm not saying the us would n't have more chances at winning , of course it does , but it still is a wager i would n't make so lightly . 
  does it not see if the line in the ground is continuous or not ? 
  ele anda nos comments do subreddit e pronto . 
  sorry not sorry sounds like something children say . 
  i do n't understand the \u00b0 o for europe ... 
  there are plenty of videos from the us with people yelling variations of `` god '' , `` oh god '' , `` jesus '' , etc. 
  \u00c9 normal nesta altura do ano . 
  good luck everyone . 
  edit : aqui [ t\u00eam ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wegzd6gi5ve&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=147 ) o sotaque ( spoilers , \u00e9 a campanha ) . 
  `` quash\u00e3o as voss\u00e1s ordins ? '', 
  portugal is older than spain . 
  \u00c9 plena hora de ponta . 
  legacy of the void para mim . 
  so far , i think none , it was tarkin who did it . 
  why should n't we trust scientists that watch star wars then ? 
  purity of essence . 
  i feel you , i have n't played in over ten years and still intuitively knew all the hotkeys without even thinking . 
  the new ones , although logical as they follow the keyboard , just messed up my game . 
  as for changing , i just did it manually .
