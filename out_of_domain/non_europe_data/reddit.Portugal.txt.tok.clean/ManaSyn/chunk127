  you make it sound like the portuguese global empire was insignificant , when it was actually the longest in history , lasting from the beginning of the 15 ^ th century to about 40 years ago ( or 15 , depending on the definition ) . 
  it peaked for over 200 years , too , as the portuguese all but controlled the spice , gold and slave ( yes , i know that 's bad ) markets untill mid 18 ^ th century . 
  i mean , sure it does not have the global impact of 19 ^ th century england nowadays , but that 's hardly surprising .

  it is n't a map , it 's propaganda . 
  pure out propaganda from a dictatorship to its own people . 
  for instance , labeling the uk as england ( as it is colloquially known in portugal , even nowadays ) shows this is not an informative piece but a comparative one - it 's just propaganda . 
   that thing he was standing on realized its momentum . 
  ftfy, 
  fair enough , perhaps i should have said `` informative map '' .

  well to be fair , you ca n't really see if it 's either concrete or cinder , but since it has to be heavy , it 's probably concrete .
