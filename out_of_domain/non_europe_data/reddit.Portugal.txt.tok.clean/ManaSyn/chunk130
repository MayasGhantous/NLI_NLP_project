  wait , i thought only keeps slow down attack speed . 
  wait , i read that as towers/keeps ... 
  but now i have to ask , that 's the difference between forts and keeps ? 
  huh , i never realized they were different . 
  thanks !, 
  can you tell me the context ? 
  have n't played the game . 
  should n't chen say that as well ? 
  i love how american those territories are . 
  square and straight lines for the most part , and a few counties that lost some territory to the neighbour and got some from the other side to compensate . 
  i learnt new things already ; sgt. 
  hammer 's crits on heroes ( talented tier 2 ) splashes as crit as well . 
  `` i can give you the moon '' after you steal moon rocks from nasa . 
  ie , empresas ou outras causas . 
  abathur is a person too :(, 
  actually water can boil at very different temperatures . 
  it depends on air pressure . 
  edit : http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/boiling-points-water-altitude-d_1344.html, 
  what happens if you have to divide by any other number ? 
  not disproving you ( portuguese ) , just presenting facts like all discussions should be . 
  `` you 're much more likely '' , he said . 
  / r/all, 
  / r/portugal, 
  / r/europe, 
  why ? 
  that does n't sound fair . 
  it is n't literal , tho . 
  dunno who that is , but til kerrigan is voiced by cylon number six . 
  her :, 
  ... yeah , that i know , i do n't know who was on that image you posted tho . 
  i think he 's just saying that for the americans ... 
  probably not , since you seem to know what celsius and kelvin are , but plenty do n't . 
  i dunno really , it is the only reason i can see someone would say that . 
  also , the frozen throne was an expansion , not vanilla wc3 . 
  portugal is a soldier . 
  not sure if that 's bad or not ... 
  yeah , everyone talking about how the lich king is some scooby doo villain did not understand the plot :, 
  arthas purposedly let you escape and destroy his minions because you would prove to be the greatest addition possible to his army . 
  if it was n't for that meddling tirion and his ashbringer who managed to destroy frostmourne , he would have easily succeded . 
  let me understand , you only need someone to visit the places but you 're the one choosing them , yeah ? 
  if that 's the case , i can get some time to visit it even today , have a smartphone with a good camera , internet connection and a basic knowledge of house hunting . 
  would certainly help with getting a valentine 's gift for my fofita . 
  can we see this as a percentage of gdp , or per capita , or something ? 
  does n't show much this way , but it is interesting that portugal has more than other , bigger and richer countries . 
  innocently o meu rabo . 
  it does have a lot faster queues . 
  sindragosa is not a dragonflight , tho . 
  i mean , if you 're talking about one of the aspects ? 
  everyone had one on my troop . 
  i do n't think a fox could beat trained dogs to be honest . 
  migth help mention what region you play in . 
  probably us . 
  the beautiful island and the fishermen islands is what the legend says in two languages . 
  it is n't , piscadores is an archaic form of the portuguese word pescadores which means fishermen . 
  it is now known as penghu . 
  formosa is a portuguese word for pretty , beautiful , as well . 
  i do n't understand why that is . 
  what is especial about arcane that it would do less damage to non-living things or , if you prefer , do more damage to living things ? 
  kinda . 
  i get how a particular element can be strong or weak against a particular target ( eg , ice destroys water but melts against fire ) , but i always saw arcane as the specific school of magic that has no elemental strengths nor weakness . 
  it does same damage to everything . 
  but i see your point as in arcane can be a weapon of the mind and have no effect against the mindless .

  to be fair there was many a king or lord who was technically first in command but it was their second in command who did the victories . 
  it is if you have no friends . 
  i have n't play gall get : /, 
  [ here ] ( http://db.edcs.eu/epigr/epimap.html ) you can zoom in and see if there is any documented latin inscription somewhere in your area . 
  if anyone 's wondering , the force of buoyancy ( b ) exerted by a fluid on a body that enters it is equal to the weigth of displaced fluid volume , ie , b = mass of displaced fluid x g. 
  in order for boats to float , that force must equal the boat 's weight ( w = mass of boat x g ) and thus the displaced water has the same mass as the boat , ie , b = w or mass of displaced fluid x g = mass of boat x g. 
  i 'm out of the loop , why is this ? 
  there is no r in falstad , unless he is a pirate .

  on va \u00e0 paris ce weekend et j' ai une question ( j ai essay\u00e9 de chercher le wiki dans le mobile mais il me reenvoie vers a / r/wiki ) :, 
  c'est plus facile de rechercher le traject quand on ne connait pas de noms des stations de metro e train ... 
  merci pour l'attention . 
  wow , putricide is tall !, 
  thank you for your answer . 
  here 's a quick one too : do the buses announce exits or am i safer by taking the metro ? 
  i actually want to ride the buses so i can do some sightseeing while transiting around but i do n't want to get lost because i missed my stop ... 
  fair enough , merci . 
  try licor beir\u00e3o . 
  it 's a liquor that tastes like the candy of the gods . 
  will killing his summons provide any xp ? 
  this argument comes often , but it is not complet . 
  universities are a place of learning , yes , but they are also a place of research and discoveries , which is also part of those rankings . 
  to be honest , driving had been invented for a long time . 
  i wonder if coach drivers required a license . 
  you can make pork bitoque too . 
  100 mgal is 10 ^ -3 m/s ^ 2 disturbance in gravity . 
  it has little to no effect in meteorology . 
  that said , besides being in the equator which is a hot and very cloudy region , what causes all that lightning could very well be the composition of the ground - a strongly conductive soil , for instance - which also influences gravity values . 
  in other words , the cause for both may be the same , but the mechanism is n't related at all .
