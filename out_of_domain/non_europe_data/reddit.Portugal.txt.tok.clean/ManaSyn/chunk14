  what is this , ukranian women are also looking for norsk men ? 
  those girls are such sluts !, 
  so aliens are abducted too !, 
  this is just hilarious . 
  this is the behaviour of a teenager . 
  good god of humour , thank you !, 
  do you also believe teachers make tests and finals in one go ? 
  i am no linguist , but i 've read somewhere on the internet ( for validity ) , plus it makes sense , that your kid would learn most of his speech in school/society rather than from you . 
  at most he 'd get your accent , or rather some specific sounds . 
  but as far as fluency goes , i think he 'd be fine , because one is only really fluent after ten or something ( this one i just made up ) . 
  the social awkward scientist/professor . 
  is this some sort of bad switch-a-roo ?

  well , atmospheric pressure is due to the weight of the atmosphere on us . 
  that weight depends both on the mass of air above and the value of the gravitational constant of earth . 
  so , indirectly , it does . 
  different planets would have different pressures for the same mass of air . 
  edit : keep in mind , however , this would be a very specific type of pressure . 
  it has a much broader meaning so generally pressure does not depend on gravity . 
   i 'm not even sure the lingerie matters,

  scottish 've got slogans . 
  they 'd win !, 
  non-american here as well and i would say the same . 
  indeed . 
  the only countries i could consider paying more for are germany and japan , because they culturally thrive for perfection . 
  there is an alternative to killing newborns : adoption . 
  there is no alternative like that while they 're still inside the womb . 
  oh so that 's why i do n't see adds on starcraft streams . 
  cool . 
  i can imagine deedee working with poles right now , yes . 
  reddit has an auto-correct ? 
  i said consider , not that i would . 
  to put it in other words - i would n't give it a second thought about buying cheaper products from anywhere else in the world . 
  that does n't mean i 'd buy the most expensive just because it 's german or japanese . 
  she is guilty of being irresponsible , but i would n't say ` just as accountable ' . 
  it was still his fault . 
  30 years in jail for trusting her boyfriend , that 's just destroying her life too . 
  as a non-american atheist : what the fuck is tgif ? 
  so , an idiomatic expression , just like ` bless you ' or ` goddamn ' . 
  yeah , other than ` lol , if god created the sun after he created days , when is actually friday ' , i do n't really give a damn !, 
  maybe [ this ] ( http://img.reversegif.com/1311.gif ) makes more sense ?

  would be funnier if it was up to scale . 
  evolution . 
  fair enough , one more thing i learn about american culture , 
  from an european pov , canada is the i 'm sorry america . 
  that 's okay , you also can not roll your rr . 
  closest you can get is when you mimic a pirate . 
  upvote for the good spirits !, 
  and do n't worry , those of us in europe who care about north american ( the subcontinent ) history know of the only us-canada war and who burnt whose city . 
  by all means , retreat all your troops and corporations from outside the us untill you have your own problems solved . 
  nothing . 
  you 'll be as conscious as you were before your brain cells first interconnected . 
  man up and accept the consequences of your actions . 
  freaking out will only make it worse . 
  no other there 's so many of them . 
  americans . 
  bodies radiate energy even if they are not in contact with anything . 
  the ammount of energy radiated is proportional to temperature ( to the fourth power ) so the object would start lowering its temperature as it radiated all its energy . 
  brilliant !, 
  thus , cuccos evolved from loftwings . 
  it means you have to understand very well what consequences telling and not telling have and choose from those . 
  you wo n't like either option , but that 's life .

  every repression of scientific advance . 
  for any reason . 
  i said repression , not regulation . 
  there is nothing wrong in making sure things are done correctly . 
  no problem !, 
  it is taken , but is there any reason why you go from ` disagree -- neutral -- agree ' to ` often -- never -- do n't know ' midtest ? 
  noticed it almost too late . 
  plus , would be maybe cool for your test if you had asked the nationality . 
  but would n't serve any real purpose so that 's ok . 
  good luck !, 
  yes , they do , i was pointing out the order of the choices , though . 
  it 's no big deal , 
  i think reddit mocks him for his brilliant idea of going to the moon to create a new 13,000 ( or 30,000 , not sure ) people state .
