  that kinds gives another perspective and it makes sense . 
  thanks !, 
  i 'm so confused right now . 
  that is the same source as the op . 
  not 5 . 
  over 5 . 
  could mean 1,000,000 . 
  both , england 's a big place . 
  it 's not surprising republicans are partisans , to follow authority is their very philosophy ... 
  why , is n't it an acronym for information technology , which includes everything computer ? 
  i 've always used it as a substitute for all things computer related . 
  what do you mean by that statement ? 
  it 's a compliment in both . 
  the earthquake was basically the killing blow . 
  dunno about spanish , but in portuguese , generally , `` usar `` refers to ingredients and utilizar refers to tools ( utens\u00edlios ) . 
  it 's a bit of grey area tho . 
  for instance , i used bananas to make a cake and utilized a knife to cut them . 
  yes , hence the grey area part . 
  just to nitpick : his name is leonardo , who comes from vinci , a town . 
  i have a seven month old black lab and while she spends all her time nose down and does grab stuff on the ground if we are not aware ( if we are , we can tell her not to grab it and she wo n't ) , we have a short table we put shit on and she does not touch it . 
  we never give her our own food and she only eats ration . 
  love the little bugger but the bitch needs to be properly educated and trained . 
  why does it have to be english speaking , could n't it be translated information ? 
  edit :, 
  is that how you write the weird oui sound i keep hearing ? 
  i was talking about that odd parisian ( i think ) pronunciation of oui that sounds like ou\u00e9 ( guess it comes from the english yeah ) ... 
  i 'm a complete noob at cryptocurrency at all so i have a question regarding liquidity :, 
  there are a few threads regarding cryptomillionaires in here or r/ethtrader , but if they were to sell all their eth and get its due usd value ( in the millions ) , would there actually be that kind of money available to them ? 
  or is eth expected to be used as eth per se ? 
  in other words , is forex trading even possible with cryptocurrency like eth ? 
  for what it 's worth , i was never told that , or that bread is good for your health in large quantities . 
  i 'm also not american . 
  is the title a jest to [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/s23w4ws.jpg ) portuguese map ? 
  how much is too much money ? 
  i 'm on the eu and pondering buying a few $ of it . 
  not trying to make a fortune as money is just not my game but why not try a bit ? 
  minutes :, 
  it does because that 's how we do things and there 's really nothing wrong with that . 
  it 's not due to lack of respect , nor is it interpreted as such . 
  on the other hand , cheek kissing is absolutely normal , but no one hugs unless they 're family or close friends . 
  hugging is weird . 
  edit : also you make it sound like it is always the men initiating said greeting but that is not necessarily the case . 
  int returns the integer part and does the same as rounddown , if you will . 
  basically i summed 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 and ( 30 + 40 + 10 ) / 60 = 1.333 , thus getting 5.333 , and just snapped the 5 out of it . 
  it 's the exact same thing as u/emorich , just differently written . 
  can always do something like :, 
  = weeknum ( a1 ) + ( year ( a1 ) - year ( $ a$ 1 ) ) * 52, 
  assuming cell a1 has the first date and data is sorted by date . 
  i suppose so , but what would be the templar counterpart ? 
  do n't say interception because i reckon that would only really work with former assassins like shay . 
  was thinking more of a general rule rather than present time pay . 
  i am aware templars have always been wealthy tho . 
  interesting , where is that implied ? 
  yeah , rogue does one hell of a job at painting the templars on a good light and the assassins as evil jerks . 
  i 'm confused , are you talking about the caucasian question up there or that band-aids are the colour they are ? 
  use the $ notation . 
  it locks either row or column , or both . 
  examples : $ a1 locks column a , changes row as you drag formula vertically , a$ 1 locks row so it changes column when you drag formula horizontally and $ a$ 1 locks both row and column so you always get the a1 cell reference . 
  well you can always do a conditional formatting rule for duplicates for the entire column , that way everytime a duplicate is introduced it will be painted red ( or whatever you chose ) . 
  i 'm at a bit of a loss here . 
  what is wrong with creating a new row and just do sumproduct for each column ? 
  you can always do the daily value for the interest rate ( often based on annual/360 , but could be annual/ndays in year , which would mean you 'd have to check for leap years ) . 
  either way , dates are treated as numbers by excel so you can do 01/01/2017  02/02/2017 ( dates in different cells ) and get a false returned no problem . 
  that 's a matrix . 
  try this . 
  select 9 cells ( in this case , in your case you 'd have to adapt ) :, 
  = mmult ( transpose ( f2 : h4 ) , b2 : d4 ), 
  where f2 : h4 is the people table ( rows of your result ) and b2 : d4 is the equipment table ( columns of your result ) . 
  hit shift + enter for the matrix to work . 
  edit :, 
  u/snorge _ 202 works wonders and you can change items and months without an issue , just be sure to lock the appropriate cells , like for instance :, 
  = sumproduct ( index ( $ b$ 2 : $ d$ 4 ; 0 ; match ( b$ 13 ; $ b$ 1 : $ d$ 1 ; 0 ) ) ; index ( $ f$ 2 : $ h$ 4 ; 0 ; match ( $ a14 ; $ f$ 1 : $ h$ 1 ; 0 ) ) ), 
  like before , a1 : d4 is equipment table , e1 : h4 is people table and a13 : d16 is final table . 
  ah , sure . 
  just select the whole column you want ( let 's say , column a1 : a300 ) , go to data validation , select custom and type this in the formula :, 
  = countif ( $ a$ 1 : $ a$ 300 , a1 ) = 1, 
  remember to also pick a error alert if you want the user to know why he got an error . 
  bostik . 
  but ... 
  it says right there you can use it for women . 
   ( of a woman ) striking and imposing rather than conventionally pretty . 
  not really , evil has an intention . 
  it means both evil and bad . 
  bread can be bad , it ca n't be evil . 
  evil is generally `` malvado '' . 
  hang on , why would toilet water be sterile and her water not ? 
  does n't it all come from the same source usually ? 
  yeah that 's a brazilian portuguese thing i guess . 
  i guess you 'll be surprised to know that power outlets like that are actually not the majority and there 's quite the diversity :, 
  keyword : openly . 
  australians are just open about their feelings and do n't really give a shit what others think . 
  americans , on the other hand , ca n't say a thing without getting sued or whatever so it 's safe to be a pussy . 
  note : i prefer the australian way . 
  op , a 5 % increase of 5 is 5.25 , not 7.5 , so i 'm assuming you meant 50 % . 
  anyway , use this formula in a2 and drag down , with 5 in a1 . 
  = if ( mod ( row ( ) ,5 ) = 0 , a1 * 1.5 , a1 ), 
  if you also add a different cell ( say b1 ) with the percentage you want so you can change it and the entire table , you could use this :, 
  = if ( mod ( row ( ) ,5 ) = 0 , a1 * ( 1 + $ b$ 1 ) , a1 ), 
  just be sure b1 is indeed in percentage ( ie , translates to decimal ) . 
  on a note , you could add the + 21 on the outside for a simpler formula :,
