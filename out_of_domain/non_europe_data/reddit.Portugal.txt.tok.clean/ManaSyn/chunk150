  what 's wrong with row ( ) ? 
  what 's with americans always thinking they can take on the entire world ? 
  the only war they only ever had in their own territory was between themselves and they still talk about the destruction and pain it brought , let alone against foreign powers who would feel no empathy against their enemy . 
  write that formula in cell g4 , then select the cell , and you see the little square on the bottom right ? 
  just click and hold in and drag down to cell 100 . 
  would n't even need much thanks to inertia , one fart and you can see the universe . 
  if you 're immortal , at least . 
  okay , why the fuck is everyone using the word `` descend\u00eancia '' when that means their children ? 
  it should be `` ascend\u00eancia '' !, 
  it 's driving me nuts . 
  what do you mean ? 
  reaprovei o teu post . 
  it 's wrong tho . 
  at least the word is wrongly used . 
  to say `` i am a descentant of '' is fine , but to say `` my descendency is x and y [ ancestors ] '' is flat out incorrect . 
  imperial is only retarded when there is no factual relationship between units . 
  if you want units with multiples of 4 that everyone uses , you have time . 
  that is not a selfish reason . 
  on the contrary . 
  why does venus temperature matter for the layman anyway ? 
  is this observational data ? 
  you should n't replace outliers , just flat out remove them if it 's observational error , or interpolate them if you needed the numbers . 
  replacing a day 's temperature is a mistake unless the month you were using was following exactly the pattern . 
  i , for one , think it 's great there 's a place on earth where you are free to put up a giant billboard telling everyone what an idiot you are . 
  that 's faking the data , tho . 
  i understand why you did it , but it 's not the best approach . 
  this is why we usually use climatological data , which requires averaging all daily data throughout a number of years , usually 30 . 
  in other words , instead of using months that resemble the average , build the actual average . 
  oh i understand it 's for fun , do n't worry . 
  it 's a great thing to do nerdy stuff , 
  what do you mean , ants do n't play cricket ? 
  they play them so hard there 's even a fable about it !, 
  best of luck to all . 
  = countif ( b28 : b80 , ''  0 '' ) * 20, 
  data -  text to columns -  delimiter -  other : /, 
  you can do it with the offset formula , which basically selects a range . 
  if you do offset ( a1 ,0,0,30 ) , you are selecting cells that do the following pattern : start at a1 , 0 cells down , 0 cells to the right , 30 rows selected . 
  so , since you 're starting at cell y6 , try this :, 
  = sum ( offset ( $ y$ 6,30 * row ( y6 ) -6 ) ,0,30 ) ), 
  check if that does what you need . 
  edit : btw , y6 to y36 gets you 31 cells , not 30 . 
  i remember a few years back there was something done about depressed people seeing differently as well ( [ e.g. ] ( http://www.livescience.com/9965-depressed-people-gray-world.html ) ) . 
  are these two related ? 
  = isnumber ( search ( '' * '' & substitute ( b1 ; '' '' ; '' * '' ) & '' * '' ; a1 ) ), 
  a workaround but it 's probably not what you want . 
  ca n't you just add the text ? 
  like, 
  = a1 & if ( < condition for percentage  , '' % '' , `` $ '' ), 
  true , fair enough . 
  elephants are very strong , they coils lift their young for a few months , it 's just they have no practical way to do it ... 
  not because we want to :(, 
  agree with everything , albufeira is a tourist place , thus it 's goddamn awful . 
  you should honestly check tavira or one of the neighbourhood small towns . 
  what is the shortcut to select column ? 
  great , thank you !, 
  would love to help but i have no idea what a kpi or an accelerator are ( well , i googled it but still no clue how it works ... ) . 
  allright so , let me get this straight . 
  you have , what , three columns :, 
  your sales | quarter goal | boolean kpi2, 
  50 | 100 | yes, 
  and want to check % of sales for quarter goal and if kpi2 is yes or no , then do the maths . 
  is that it ? 
  also , what is the logic for the accelerators ? 
  say you make $ 100 . 
  if that 's below 60 % you gain nothing , if it 's below 80 % you gain $ 50 , if below 100 % you gain $ 100 , if below 120 % you gain $ 100 , if below 150 % you gain $ 120 else you gain $ 150 ? 
  i think you miss a word there , because 140 square miles of ocean is not a lot . 
  he was wet . 
  first thing you do when saving a wet victim is to take all his wet clothes and cover him to stop hypothermia . 
  although we still use 1 to 12 in the afternoon colloquially . 
  that said , 0 to 23 is better for science too . 
  ca n't calculate day length using am/pm . 
  apologies , but how is that old ? 
  or is that it 's style ? 
  i 'm not american so i do n't know much about giant wooden houses . 
  thank you for your answer . 
  also , i wish i had a castle to enjoy :(, 
  actually he probably is n't my ancestor and i have no clue what my ancestors are , but one could dream , and the odds are good . 
  i wonder if there 's any country anywhere as litigious ( or more ) than the us , to be honest . 
  \u00c9 logo a primeir\u00edssima [ regra do reddit ] ( https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy/ ) . 
  this is true . 
  i have a 8 months old lab puppy ( read , supposedly voracious combo ) that drops most stuff when i tell her to , and allows me to completely put my fingers inside her mouth to grab anything when she does n't without complaint . 
  she also does not immediately run towards anything that drops on the floor like this one . 
  that said , this is more likely because he 's fed remains at the table than being trained or not . 
  eh , you could say training is the active part of raising your dog and stuff like that is the passive part but that would be arguing semantics so sure , fair enough .
