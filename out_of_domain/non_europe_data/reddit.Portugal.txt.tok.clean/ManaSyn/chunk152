  obviously , i would never touch them with excel . 
  at least it 's not -0 % !, 
  50 $ is not trivial money to most of us , tho . 
  well he 's not wrong ... 
  there 's a reason jurassic park dinosaurs used elephant sounds ( [ relevant video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cqghljxkho ) ) . 
  if i 'm reading correctly , less issuance = less items = more value per item . 
  hey , thanks for creating this , i too am in your situation , trying to learn this stuff because it looks like helluva profitable if you know what you 're doing , and helluva bad if you do n't . 
  that said , i 've been using https://www.tradingview.com to try my hand around some charts , it 's free and comes with many tools ( and some more if you pay ) . 
  perhaps someone else will tell you about a better one . 
  good luck !, 
  if that is your analysis of your strategy , what will you do ? 
  as i 'm only still learning how to play the market , movements like these are the ones that scare me the most . 
  i keep thinking , `` should i buy in , it keeps increasing , should i buy in ? '', 
  then i eventually buy in and it goes down right after . 
  i 'm still a goddamn pig . 
  i honestly much appreciate the input , but i still have much to learn in terms of trade language and methods . 
  i will definitely come back and read your comment once i am confident i know what you 're even talking about , and how to do it . 
  here you go :, 
  the russian 's answer is brilliant . 
  yes , it 's the airport . 
  well , that is a tourist trap ... 
  every multinational place is a tourist trap , as in , thieves know people using it are tourists as locals use the - much better - local places . 
  but the man who killed the emperor is dead . 
  i loved the scream at the surprise mob !, 
  i had tickets for it but they cancelled the concert here :(, 
  pretty retarded to post spam in german on an international site , if you ask me . 
  the `` hold on holdon holon hon hon hon hon '' was great too . 
  i did n't say that . 
  post removed , good stuff . 
  have a nice day . 
  i do n't care what you think . 
  it 's spam because you 're advertising your own work in the wrong place , it 's retarded because it 's in german in a place where most people do n't understand german . 
  furthermore , you advertised it in english with no warning that it would be in german . 
  you 've done everything wrong , so i hope you learn from it and do it better next time . 
  they seem to work like that in the us for some odd reason , cardboard or wood . 
  this is why the baddies can punch trough walls in their movies . 
   it matters not . 
  we have lost . 
  look to the skies !, 
  so we will actually be seeing the god himself !, 
   it matters not . 
  we have lost . 
  look to the skies !, 
  there are tornados in europe too and i 've never heard of that happening ... 
  i do n't know , part of me feels sad we might not actually fight it , but then i realise that fighting an actual , full-sized , full-empowered titan would not work well for us . 
  i guess this is blizzard 's way to solve the too-big-too-fall conundrum . 
  we started globalization . 
  was realm first 85 shaman too , and made a horde shaman quit the game because i `` stole '' it from him . 
  now that i think of it , how powerful are pit lords in legion ranks ? 
  they are seemingly so powerful , but there is no boss at all . 
  maybe they 'll be trash , or adds . 
  unrelated , but the k on the url is kinda sucky , looks like a h. 
  how much is olive oil in the us ? 
  olive oil is probably the healthiest cooking oil you can use . 
  we buy the cheapest olive oil , really , but for frying we use vegetal oil ( like sunflower ) . 
  [ this ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20141029020706/https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2km4et/tifu_by_making_a_stupid_assumption_about_my/ ) story is in the comments ... now this is sad . 
  why does it matter what country his parents come from , why 'd he have to have a chinese culture . 
  god what a fucked up country . 
  definitely wind waker . 
  the music alone makes the game for me , but everything else is awesome too . 
  edit : now that i am home , my two favourite musics of the game ( but there are many more ) - [ dragon roost island ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxggvshq6ia ) and [ the great sea ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gn_x1rpgby8 ) . 
  fuck , i got ta play this again ... 
  ie , crazy cat lady syndrome . 
  how about do the opposite and make the adds as factual and small as possible ? 
  present-day advertising is bloody annoying because , apparently , you 're supposed to buy an item because plastic jane and jock paul get perfect teeth out of this extremely great `` wow !, 
  best car oil ever '' , buy it now !, 
  nice video , but the credits , with the character dancing and clearly enjoying the anduin 's theme , was pretty well done !, 
  simple but great . 
  this is what some snakes do to hypnotize their victims . 
  i thought the point of corrupting titans was to create a weapon of doom for the universe . 
  now that i think of it , the void lords might not really care much about entering our universe at all , they just want to consume it . 
  a quick example :, 
  ( i will talk with her ) . 
  ( i will talk at her ), 
  ep : `` amo-te '' ( i love you ) . 
  bp : `` eu te amo '' ( i you love ), 
  i 'm not kidding , this is word-per-word direct translation . 
  it is understandable but it can get difficult once in a while and , to be honest , it can also get bloody annoying . 
  in my country , the usual time schedules for work is to arrive at 9h30 , have lunch at 13h00 for at least one hour of loud conversation , leave at 18h30 . 
  it 's all just a huge waste of time for me ... 
  i arrive at 7h30 , have a 10 minute lunch alone at 12h00 and leave before 16h00 after my work is all complete so i can have a lot of time for myself , my fiancee and my dog . 
  you know , enjoy life . 
  unfortunately , there are some places in the world where it is n't mandatory because freedom . 
  a bit rusty but this ( or a variant ) should work :, 
  range ( `` a '' & range ( `` a10000 '' ) . end ( xlup ) . row + 1 ) . value = 0, 
  change a for whatever column you want and 10000 for a value you know your column will never reach . 
  edit : added + 1 . 
  how the fuck is this colonial europe fault ? 
  it 's americans who make a big deal out of skin colour and `` ethnicity '' . 
   or did africans kidnap themselves and sail to the new world ? 
  the answer to the first question is ` yes , they did ' . 
  there 's two main reasons for this :, 
  those are huge countries and a lot of hardware is required . 
  cartels charge whatever the fuck they want . 
  love the giant easter egg . 
  coriolis effect . 
  relative to us , he was moving inward in a straight line , but the result is a spiral . 
  wait , i too have a black lab just like in the photo ( 9 months old tho ) in an apartment and i 've never trimmed her nails . 
  i was told by multiple vets that dogs do n't really require nail trimming because they naturally use them simply by walking and scratching the ground outside . 
  looks like magica de spell is up to no good !,
