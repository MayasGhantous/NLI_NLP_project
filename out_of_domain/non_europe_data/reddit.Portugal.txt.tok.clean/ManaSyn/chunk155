  what about leaving them early or skipping them ? 
  and this is why the earth can rotate in its own axis without falling down too . 
  this goes both ways . 
  we do n't care that you 're gay , and we also do n't care to hear you say it . 
  that arthas ' a king , not a prince . 
  the most sadistic evil fucker of them all . 
  that is the unexpected ending . 
  oh no , a non-tech person doing computer stuff !, 
  where do kids go to school in the middle of august ? 
  plate still would n't protect from that , really . 
  when she falls in love for you , but you aim too high . 
  hey , as long as he 's not a dreadlord ... 
  not quite . 
  you can be paranoid without losing sight of reality ( ie accusing a random cashier of being a government agent ) . 
  i 'm guessing op is from minnesota . 
  portuguese here , they recently ( ~ 10 years ) banned all death bullfighting . 
  all bulls survive . 
  and about a week ago our national tv has announced they will no longer broadcast any kind of touradas . 
  we 're getting there . 
  our culture is already rather influenced by islam tho ... you know , the land 's been muslim for almost half a millennia . 
  santa luzia is south of tavira and there 's at least 4 or 5 restaurants that i can think of on its 600m long main street ... 
  do you play falstad in heroes of the storm ? 
  mate , you 're the sole reason he 's a character in wow as well . 
  you should get a falstad skin instead .

  wtf, 
  ` as an esl , forgive my english '' . 
  meh , scandinavian trust in each other probably comes from older times where you 'd die in the cold if you did n't trust others . 
  spanish sea expedition over portugal ... 
  there has been a lot of hints regarding it . 
  it will be the final reveal of the season for sure . 
  not sure if this has been said , but what if the wigth is hodor that bran can control ? 
  his name is jon . 
  hodor . 
  probably not a coincidence , [ protestant work ethics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protestant_work_ethic ) are quite different than catholics ' . 
  in other words , in the northern cultures you are expected to work and thus you can do whatever you want , in the southern cultures you are expected to ~ ~ pray ~ ~ enjoy life and have to work to pay for it . 
  tl ; dr : live to work vs work to live . 
  there is no shame in enjoying life , and i quite like it . 
  i 'd rather be lazy and warm than efficient but cold . 
  you clearly misunderstood what i said and are just looking to enter an argument so sorry but you wo n't get one from me . 
  fair enough . 
  it was ama n'thul . 
  algalon was in wrath , tho . 
  this happened to me once ( spring holding it broke and my window got slammed in the middle of the highway ) . 
  i immediately hit emergency lights and moved to the side , and i could only see the road from the gap below . 
  portuguese too , and it is a mass measuring unit , ie , 1 @ = 15 kg . 
  he was very willing to go over the other colonial powers , supposed allies , to do this . 
  for instance , he pressured the british government into giving an [ ultimatum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1890_british_ultimatum ) to portugal , its oldest ally ( our countries have the [ oldest treaty still active ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-portuguese_treaty_of_1373 ) ) , to give up on land during the scramble for africa . 
  then again the humiliation suffered by the portuguese crown proved to be its undoing , as it contributed quite a lot to , only 20 years later , turning portugal into a republic . 
  white walkers have an icey sword , i guess thoros will teach the nk how to light his sword on fire . 
  should post it to r/portugal . 
  why is cersei dissing the inexistent dragoon ? 
  i reckon the [ portuguese ] ( http://i.imgur.com/knaoo8w.png ) are in it again ( right side flag ) .

  yes , hence the `` again '' . 
  all of these are undead wc3 heroes . 
  dreadlord jaina , death knight sonya , cryptlord zagara and the lich himself . 
  if we 're being precise , higher altitude only matters if there are stronger winds , which is probably the case ( due to lack of friction ) , but then again the wind would probably be against them as air tends to move from cold ( more dense ) to hot ( less dense ) areas . 
  i 'm sure the maesters have a few treaties on westeros meteorology . 
  unless i am very mistaken on my reasoning , `` parking '' and `` travel '' are n't logicals , so the or function will not work . 
  you should rewrite that part as, 
  if ( or ( [ @description ] = `` parking '' , [ @description ] = `` travel '' ), 
  also you may have too many parenthesis . 
  that influence may be partially modern , but there is a lot of arab ( and berber ) influence in iberian cuisine from the time it was muslim territory . 
  what 's with australians and spain ? 
  do n't worry , i 'm from portugal and i got your reference . 
  not sure i understand your question . 
  yes , i did think of it , because it is not the first time i 've seen someone say portugal is in south america and i 've been told the reference then . 
  on a side note , they are also all the undead heroes in wc3 . 
  i do n't think killing everything would kill azeroth . 
  afaik life is independent of a titan soul ( see draenor ) . 
  it would just drive her insane , because of all the loss , and thus easier to corrupt . 
  i know i ca n't be the only one ... kings and dinasties come and go , wars do n't really matter . 
  but the wall stood for ten thousand years and it finally fell . 
  this is the most important thing that happened in the entire episode ( although very predictable ) ... 
  just so you know , fire is plasma . 
  god no , that dragonbawl would have later forever and we 'd have to wait for the next episode ( s ) to know the conclusion . 
  i have a question that 's probably been answered , so apologies if it has . . 
  is n't jon now also the rigthful lord of winterfell , since bran refused it , and males get precedence ? 
  why worldwide ? 
  i was never taught a food pyramid were vegetables were n't the biggest slice by far . 
  i hope you did n't speak brazilian portuguese ( unless she 's brazilian , in which case i hope you did ) . 
  it 's not about permission , its about respect . 
  you 're letting them know their daughter/son is so important to you that you 'd like to spend the rest of your life with her/him and hope they accept you . 
  they do n't have to , but everything goes better if everyone appreciates one another . 
  what is he saying , ca n't see it on mobile . 
  this , really . 
  it 's not permission as much as it is letting them know . 
  the draenei exodus was because of the naaru . 
  velen is beginning to think he should have stayed and try to save his brethren and his planet rather than fleeing . 
  '' , etc. 
  i want a family guild ... 
  eh , i 've had my time in the sun in wow , got wotlk realm first galore , so a relaxing , mega-casual guild sounds great . 
  que lol . 
  holy shit i 'm not playing wow at the moment and i have n't been close to a fel reaver in close to 10 years and still i actually heard the bitch just from the image . 
  i am the same . 
  music brings little to no enjoyment to me , and it 's nothing more than annoying noise to me , as i 'm distracting and bothering .
