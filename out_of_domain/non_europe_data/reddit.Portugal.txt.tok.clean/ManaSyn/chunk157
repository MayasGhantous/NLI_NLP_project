  ** laptop questionnaire **, 
  * country of purchase :, 
  portugal, 
  up to $ 1500 , with some effort i can go a little over , but i 'm not looking for the ultimate death machine , and a more economic option is prefered . 
  if i can get something nice below $ 1000 , that 'd be great . 
  i do n't know if this is necessery , but i have been using [ this website ] ( http://www.kuantokusta.pt ) to compare prices , maybe it can be helpful for someone helping me . 
  * purpose ( netbook , ultraportable , mainstream , gaming , desktop replacement , etc. 
  it is meant as a desktop replacement , to sit in home and dualscreen with my late desktop 's monitor , but also to be carried once in a while when necessery . 
  that said , i need it to run scientific programs like matlab that would require reading huge ammounts of data and process it . 
  on the other side of life , a good ammount of gaming would be great . 
  i do n't need to have super ultra high fancy graphics . 
  enjoying a game 's story is good as it is . 
  so , a computer that could run games without any problem on , say , medium or high graphics . 
  * screen size preference :, 
  * os preference ( windows / mac / linux ) :, 
  windows , maybe also installing linux eventually . 
  * gaming requirements ( example games and desired fps/settings ) :, 
  starcraft 2 , high settings with no noticeable breaks . 
  to compare , i 'm used to playing it on low and being that guy that shows up on the '' ## is slowing down the game '' , 
  open world games ( assassins creed , skyrim , etc ) , being able to see far with decent looks would be nice . 
  * performance requirements ( video , cad , etc. 
  data processing and a bit of gaming lulz . 
  * method of computer support ( office supplier , college bookstore , self support ) :, 
  uhm , not sure , office supplier i suppose . 
  i 'm awful at hardware and a newbie at software . 
  self support = nuclear explosions . 
  * brand preferences and reasons ( already owned accessories , familiarity , business, 
  compatibility ) :, 
  i have a sony cellphone and an asus tablet . 
  i quite enjoy asus , but i 'm not a huge brand fan . 
  as long as i can remove all the damn programs that come with the laptop ( with a format , i suppose ) , brand is not a problem . 
  * any particular style that you like ( examples are great ) :, 
  i 've been looking at the [ asus n76vb ] ( http://www.asus.com/notebooks_ultrabooks/n76vb/#specifications ) , it 's about $ 1100 and it looks decent . 
  * which of the following qualities would you prefer ? 
  ( choose one , the other , or balanced ), 
  * long battery life - vs - low weight : battery, 
  * build quality - vs - low price : quality, 
  * low noise/heat - vs - high performance : performance, 
  ** would you pay a premium for something that has : **, 
  * high resolution screen : maybe . 
  * a great keyboard : no . 
  * a great touchpad/mouse buttons : no . 
  will always be using a mouse . 
  first thing i 'll do is to disable the touchpad . 
  my hands always land on it while typing . 
  * great audio : not really , no . 
  ** list any features that are critical : ** ( e.g. 
  optical drive , usb 3.0 , sd card slot , ethernet port , hdmi port , bluetooth , vga port , removable battery , glossy screen , matte screen , etc. ), 
  ethernet port , vga port , laptop for dummies book . 
  i 'm not sure what else is needed , but feel free to ask . 
  i know this is a shitty question , but i 've been sitting here for 15 minutes and it 's a crap to get anything out . 
  edit : you . 
  yes , you . 
  why are you checking posts i created ? 
  i have a question regarding routes between your civ 's cities :, 
  say you use a caravan to send 5 hammers between your capital and a smaller town . 
  are these 5 hammers deducted from the capital 's production numbers or do they show up from nowhere , and the capital is not affected at all , your only loss is the gold you 'd get from an external trade route ? 
  i 'm wondering if there 's any item or service in the world that works as a final destination for money . 
  for all i know about economy and finances ( close to nothing ) , money is n't destroyed , it just changes hands , but i am curious about that , because then it would mean that , in a way , zug 's first arrowhead exchange for dur 's piece of meat still haunts us to this day . 
  so , where is it that money goes to die , if anywhere ? 
  given the free library , that is . 
  i 'm thinking specifically of the azores and madeira isles , because they strike close to home ( am portuguese ) , and how they were discovered ( or re-discovered ) by men in small ships . 
  looking at their size in the middle of the atlantic ocean makes me wonder what were the processes used by the captain to decide where to go , out of the blue sea . 
  it boggles my mind even further to think of the tiny isles in the much larger pacific ocean . 
  i can think of birds and cloud formation above the isles , as well as possible breeze due to the presence of land , but i wonder if there were other methods used . 
  so , title question , did anyone ever make a mod that would make sure each city-state has a different luxury , or at least that not all of them had the same ? 
  there are only so many whales i care about having in my empire . 
  [ for reference ] ( http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/03/07/does-the-color-pink-exist-scientists-arent-sure/ ) . 
  so i did a 3-game playtrough with a serial killer , genocidal shepard : tried to kill everyone i could . 
  killed wrex , killed all crew and all but two characters in the suicide mission , which afterwards died in me3 , as did ashley , leaving me with liara and james , who died at the hands of harbinger , and edi , which would die , together with the geth ( who wiped out the quarians ) , once i hit the destroy option . 
  it was great , untill the end !, 
  except i got the control option . 
  i thought low war assets would only give the destroy option . 
  i tried to replay the end and see if it was some choices i had to pick . 
  or is this an alignment issue ? 
  must i play a paragon serial killer in me3 ? 
  8h , por exemplo . 
  edit2 : [ prova ] ( http://www.museudacidade.pt/aacontecer/paginas/jornadas-europeias-do-patrimonio-2014.aspx ) . 
  self-post etc. 
  what gives ? 
  this feels great , you die fast as a pilot ( not instantly , but fast ) , and titans can survive for a little while . 
  all this parkour !, 
  uns headphones wireless e ouve assim a m\u00fasica . 
  to be clear , in the end of the third movie there is [ this ] ( http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130420050659/starwars/images/5/55/jedighosts-rotj.png ) scene where anakin , yoda and obi-wan are seen as `` ghosts '' . 
  as far as i know , it took years of training for the jedi masters ( in dagobah and tatooine , between the trilogies ) to be able to defeat death and become one with the force . 
  but where did anakin learn how to do it ? 
  i ca n't see him doing it as darth vader ... 
  broas . 
  nem no horto do campo grande as h\u00e1 . 
  por exemplo , [ kajal chelliva ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctlph4bvgrq ) , [ tunak tunak tun ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcj31-d_iwk ) , [ ding dong song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z13qnzuqwui ) , etc. 
  deparei-me com este [ site ] ( http://stock-off.com/ ) hoje . 
  hi everyone . 
  i was just thinking it would be interesting for our portuguese learners ( and native speakers as well ! ), 
  to hear about weird , unheard words from our various dialects . 
  i can only imagine what strange words there are in the african portuguese versions influenced by their culture , not to mention brazilian and even european portuguese . 
  but even words shared by all can be fun to hear about . 
  so , i 'll start with a few :, 
  * [ cantarolar ] ( http://www.priberam.pt/dlpo/cantarolar ) ( light singing , like you do when you 're doing chores or something ), 
  * [ trautear ] ( http://www.priberam.pt/dlpo/trautear ) ( to hum ), 
  * [ outr\u00e9m ] ( http://www.priberam.pt/dlpo/outr%c3%a9m ) ( someone else ) - \u00c9 de outr\u00e9m : * it belongs to someone else *,
