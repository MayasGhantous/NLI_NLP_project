  since the last update my opo had ( think it was for cyanogen os ) a few days ago , every time i press the volume keys i get the [ notification sound ] ( https://dl.pushbulletusercontent.com/cqrynenpfzdchirdjysaxw3bjo8uf19j/screenshot_2015-09-04-10-06-21.png ) instead of ringtone , like it did before . 
  it was very handy to turn vibrate/sound mode by just clicking the icon , now i have to do a bit more work . 
  is there a way to fix this ? 
  thank you .

  this is what i mean :, 
  somehow it even uses my phone 's language ( although slightly incorrect ) , as relay itself is in english . 
  i do not get this window anywhere else on my phone . 
  i hope i do n't spoil anything to anyone so really do n't read down below if you have n't played it . 
  i also do n't know if this has been asked so apologies if it has . 
  anyway , to my question :, 
  [ according to the campaign , to ascend as xel ` naga you had to be of two races , the whole purity of form and purity of essence issue . 
  given what happened , and that it was amon who uplifted the protoss and the zerg , can we assume that it was the terran who had the purity of form and the primal zerg ( unaltered by amon ) who had the purity of essence ? 
  kerrigan is a product of both , as shown in hots .

  hello all ,, 
  i 'm gon na use opie to have one bind for all my interface windows , but i 'm having a hard time finding a simple command line to toggle the collections and adventure guide windows . 
  also , is there a simple line to toggle profession windows as well ? 
  thanks in advance . 
  good afternoon . 
  i am a researcher and my girlfriend is a teacher , and thus we will only be printing the eventual paper for me to read and tests for her to give . 
  this being said , our estimate is that we will not be using the printer much but will have moments where we will have an intensive use . 
  we would like to buy a colour printer that can scan and copy documents in both a document feeder and the normal scanning apparatus . 
  online connection is nice but it is not the most important thing we want , as we both have laptops . 
  finally , it is rather important that the printer works in an economic way , and this is why i 'm coming to you . 
  we are rather uninformed on the advantages of ink vs laser in terms of ink usage , and we have also been told about an ecotank printer which is much more economic , albeit more expensive . 
  tl ; dr : multifunction cheap and economic colour printer that wo n't break under a bit more intensive use .

  hey !, 
  i just have two quick questions regarding my new op3t :, 
  * i had a opo with a sms/text widget , that allowed me to easily access my messages on screen . 
  i ca n't find anything of the sort now ... how can i fix this ? 
  * i would add said widget to the shelf , but i have an issue with it : i ca n't seem to be able to remove other widgets from it , and i accidentaly added netflix 's which i now want to remove . 
  is it even possible ? 
  also , one final question : can i charge my phone with with other android cables ( ie , not dash ) ? 
  thanks in advance !, 
  so there 's a lot of speculation about what exactly happens to life on a world-soul upon its titan 's birth , like azeroth for example . 
  some say our characters will all die from destruction that puts the cataclysm to shame , others say that they will survive and ride azeroth into glorious battle . 
  i 'm going to assume the last is true for my question :, 
  do you think it is possible that there is life on sargeras ? 
  maybe he travels around carrying legions of demons on his skin . 
  or maybe not actually life but hundreds of thousands of constructs to tend to his every need , whichever those may be ? 
  what would be the implications of that ? 
  could we maybe one day board the fallen titan to cleanse him ? 
  or destroy him , as maybe that 's a titan 's weakness ( other than being cleaved before birth ) .
