  after all , only a handful of people , if any , worship zeus and odin nowadays , yet they are deities . 
  evidently this all depends on the definition of deities . 
  mine goes along the line of a supernatural being with powers to an extent , finite or not . 
  because of said powers , it has the potential to be worshiped by us puny humans . 
  now ghosts , they do n't really have any power , other than being spooky . 
  at least not the bloody mary christian ghosts , i do n't think . 
  but sure , i understand what you mean with ghosts and spirits being minor deities . 
  there are so many cultures that revere them , it would be prejudice to discard them alltogether . 
  i would still say there is a difference between calling the modern western version of a ghost a deity , or a roman lar ( a bit of trivia , was searching for this word as i could not remember , turns out i should because it means home in portuguese  ) , and as such , one atheist raised in modern west paradigms will have less problems believing in an afterlife with powerless beings than others . 
  which brings us to the topic at hand . 
  if my definition of deity is incorrect ( it is a bit incomplete , sure ) , or lack understanding of that superstition ( as i am not from an anglo-saxonic country ) , feel free to correct me . 
  you may be an atheist , but you should still visit catholic churches . 
  they did a really good job with all the people they burned . 
  the churches are massive and beautiful . 
  just be sure your woman is properly dressed . 
  and maybe no shorts , i can not remember . 
  i do n't think you will find any momument to the old gods that has n't been destroyed or turned into a christian monument . 
  but there are lots of historical places to visit . 
  you obviously should n't skip the most famous ones , and those are in any book you can buy . 
  the only tip i can give you , other than paying a visit to the catholic churches and vatican museum , is to see some catacombs . 
  they 're really creepy . 
  tell her she is made of stardust while showing her [ this ] ( http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/hawaiianstarlight/wallpapers/hawaiianstarlight_w2-1440x900.jpg ) . 
  no girl can resist pink . 
  heck , i ca n't resist that , and i am no girl !, 
  to be honest , for a good look at ancient roman temples you 'd be better off at some backwater province where they kept the damn things . 
  but as said , you can also check out the pantheon ( i forgot about it ) . 
  it 's been a few years since i last went rome , so i 'm not your best guide . 
  all i can say is i went to a few on the outskirts of the old city ( or however it is called ) for some catacombs . 
  if memory serves , there 's a fully dedicated area of ancient ruins close to circus maximus . 
  ah really , you 're better served with somebody like happygopink who knows his rome , 
  just as you said , even if atheism was a set of beliefs , it still would n't be a religion . 
  believing the weather forecast everyday is not religion . 
  not for those who make it , no . 
  but for those who listen to the simple version broadcast in radio , with no evidence to back it up other than `` guy in radio seddit '' , it is belief . 
  it 's even faith !, 
  yet , no religion . 
  you would be correct , here in portugal we have pretty much no reference to ghosts or afterlife apparitions whatsoever , and we have no traditions about it . 
  our afterlife is pretty much catholic . 
  heaven , hell or purgatory , no soul left behid . 
  that said , and while you raise very good points on the deity of ghosts , i would have a bad time seeing them as such because of my culture . 
  in fact , i would have an hard time believing them even if i was no atheist . 
  with that in mind , it is fairly obvious why the op would consider unbelief in ghosts part of her atheism , and why other atheists would n't . 
  he 's a good person because he 's a good person . 
  it has nothing to do with christianity . 
  too late , goddunit 5000 years ago . 
  a dangerous joke . 
  humanism . 
  i think that 's quite [ ironic ] ( http://preacherontheplaza.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/mega-church.jpg ) .
