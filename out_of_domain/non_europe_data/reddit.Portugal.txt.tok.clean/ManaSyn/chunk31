  fair enough . 
  still , i 'd wager to say thomasmakapi was wondering about why all the fuss over high school graduation we non-americans see . 
  reddit , for example , gets quite flooded with pictures from high schoolers talking about their graduation stories . 
  nothing wrong with that , but it 's still a bit puzzling because , to be honest , graduating high school really is n't a superb feat around here . 
  i 'm going to use your logic to suggest the city of lisbon : mediterranean climate , in the westmost part of continental europe , bathed by the atlantic itself - the sea traffic of the capital of the world be chaotic in the strait of gibraltar if it was situated inside the mediterranean , plus it also has historical significance ( first european expansions and all ) . 
  i 'm from the 80 's and what is this ? 
  that 's a lovely friendly book , but i do n't understand your title . 
  muhammad was from arabia . 
  he was indeed white . 
  yes , i understand as much . 
  thing is , it 's probably the only line in the entire book we can expect to be reasonably accurate . 
  hey , none needed mate :p, 
  it would seem they bust a gut instead . 
  quite the pain in the arse . 
  i 'm curious now , do people from dublin actually give a damn about swearing ? 
  wrong meme usage , posted in wtf ... 
  have you ever felt a tiny bit of hunger in your life ? 
  i was talking about a more general approach on swearing of people fro dublin , rather than if literally every single person cared or not about swearing . 
  obviously , some care and some do n't . 
  as an example , in my hometown ( my country 's capital ) people swearing is very much frowned upon , but in the city i studied at , just 300km north , nobody gave a damn about children swearing in the street . 
  it 's a cultural thing , really . 
  bit unrelated , but what map is that in the background of joffrey 's ad ? 
  [ parallax ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parallax ) . 
  to put it simply , we look at a star in january , then look at it again in june when the earth is in the opposite side of its orbit , and we can calculate the star 's distance by measuring the apparent movement of a closer body we know the distance of in reference to that star . 
  average american . 
  you guys have some really crazy advertisiment infestation problem going on . 
  keep in mind most people do not have an advanced level of english . 
  i never read shakespeare in english , for example ( one day i will ) . 
  that being said , basic level english has a really easy grammar , so it 's not hard to learn at all . 
  sigh . 
  when 's the one about moises ' tablets gon na pop up ? 
  [ what did i say ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/vbx4i/they_stole_that_from_apple_fixedfixed/c533yvw?context=3 ) ? 
  well done old chap !, 
  yes , seriously . 
  pray do tell . 
  because of your post , i 'm beginning to think you people are confusing the question `` what map is that '' with `` what map is that of '' , really . 
  if that 's not what 's happening here , could you or someone please explain to me what 's wrong with my original question ? 
  for the life of me , i never said anything about not recognizing the world the map represents . 
  i merely asked ** what ** map it is , not ** where ** & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ;, 
  in other words : who made the map , and for what purpose ? 
  i must be really dumb because if it 's really obvious i 'm just totally missing it . 
  edit : perhaps if it helps , i did not read the hard cover books in english , as i 'm not english native speaker . 
  perhaps those maps were in those books , but that i have no way to know . 
  and yes , the wallpaper is quite awesome . 
  quite right . 
  i suppose it 's part of my esl status , as asking `` what map is that '' directly translated in my language would make sense , so i immediately assumed it would work well in english . 
  oh well , i guess that 's two things i learned today . 
  thank you , and thank you for finally putting an end to this silly thread . 
  new novelty account , i see . 
  bomberman . 
  pfft , you have a long way to go before you can reach any old world country 's kill count . 
  take her with you . 
  because people under 18 think nsfw = m rating ( or whatever the fuck mature rating is ) . 
  quite the shitty ad . 
  what the fuck , this shit is still going on ? 
  someone already made my perfect sandwich : [ francesinha ] ( http://news.travel.aol.com/2011/04/21/sandwiches-around-the-world-10-international-bites-on-a-bun/#4075224 ) . 
  that picture does it no justice , so here 's [ another ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-foodrmhji_k/tbg4c6mvqgi/aaaaaaaaaty/osiusvr7aou/s1600/francesinha4.jpg ) . 
  what 's this , metric system on reddit ? 
  i ca n't possibly think that , as i 'm not american myself , 
  that 's some fine handwriting . 
  i wish i could ever write like that . 
  pokem\u00f3n posts . 
  it 's okay to enjoy a good show/game , but there 's just so many of them . 
  legend of zelda : wind waker . 
  i just love sailing the damn boat . 
  i 'm not subscribed to it . 
  that 's rude , but it is n't a crime as far as i know . 
  because the refrigerator just magically creates cold out of nowhere . 
  religion in europe is nothing compared to religion in the us . 
  [ this ] ( http://dumpendebat.net/picture_library/coffeecup.jpg ) . 
  yeah , it should have been an american flag for the real english . 
  i do n't get it , why ? 
  why , at least they get desks !, 
  i figured it was about that , but i do n't get the relation between it and the egg . 
  3rd world because he 's black , or ... ? 
  it 's funny , on my country chinese people swap r with l , in english they swap l with r. 
  i wonder why that is , really . 
  if you 're being charged , it will . 
  if you were recieving it , that 's a whole other story . 
  i 'm sure whoever made that had some fun throwing the cat off . 
   and , yes , we know about the enlightenment , the age of reason . 
  it was the scourge of religion in europe . 
  many thousands of conservative christians fled to america during this 18th century exodus from europe to enjoy and inflame the great awakening and the second awakening . 
  that 's just adorable . 
  and true . 
  why , but i keep all my money inside my mattress . 
  banks are not to be trusted !, 
  i did it by allowing natural light to enter the room ( ie , open blinds/curtains ) and doing some exercise as soon as i got up . 
  it 's probably best to just expand elsewhere . 
  why would it be nsfw ? 
  my cart filled with all my precious stuff . 
  it 'd be empty , but at least i could sit down if my feet hurt . 
  i 'd say equatorians . 
  actually , i wonder if there 's any name for when people mass help one person and feel well about the problem even if it continues for everyone else in the planet . 
  what about the flying slugs ? 
  there is no way i 'm waiting for this gif to load properly . 
  oh fine , i get it , i 'm terribad :(, 
  not sure why you linked that , maybe you were trying to link the image . 
  [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_european_time ) is the correct one . 
  but anyway , the reasons are mostly political .
