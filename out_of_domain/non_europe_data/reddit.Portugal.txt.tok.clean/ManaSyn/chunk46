  how 's life in the mississippi ? 
  there has been six moon landings as far as i know . 
  shit , yeah , that 's one of the things from american movies/shows that i 've ever been curious about . 
  being an introvert . 
  it 's 8:40 , how is that lunch ? 
  `` i 'm sick and tired of '', 
  what if it ran off ? 
  like what ? 
  i see . 
  so when you build a dam you just guess the water might be doing more pressure on the bottom ? 
  `` i 'm sick and tired of < insert commonplace  '' . 
  ca n't you read ? 
  he changes the too le . 
  not sure if you meant us as in united states or us as humanity ... 
  because i did n't have to . 
  it is n't , at all , if you have money . 
  to be fair , if one 's personal experiences are corroborated by several other 's personal experiences from all over the continent , which can be read in plenty of / r/europe 's posts , there might be a chance one is n't so biased after all . 
  also , \u00e0 primeira vista li [ bowser ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/pt/7/76/bowsernsmbwii.png ) ... 
  are introverts affected by advertising the same way extraverts are ? 
  i ca n't certainly speak for everyone , specially because where i live is n't as advertising heavy as it would seem to be in the us , but i could say i think advertising has very little impact on my purchasing choices . 
  they all look great , so damn classy . 
  it was awesome then !, 
  what exactly is the blue beam of death on the top of the image ? 
  well okay then . 
  i 'm from southern europe , and we do have problems with foreign catfish destroying domestic ecosystems because of how voracious they are . 
  but [ this ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/catfish-have-learned-how-to-hunt-pigeons-2012-12 ) , this is just a whole new level !, 
  that 's , like , your opinion , man . 
  `` funny image sites '', 
  the eu won a nobel prize . 
  yes . 
  yes you should . 
  shipping fees so i could actually participate in reddit giveaways . 
  what kind of defence mechanism makes you look like a crab ? 
  i should downvote you for that bit of karmawhoring , but i 'll upvote you for the funny conclusion instead . 
  awesome story !, 
  you had your chance right there , rather than taking a photo . 
  just do it . 
  you 're right , it 's not about karma at all , it 's about sending good posts to the front page , so yes , i do give a fuck about those small ` upvotes plz ' posts . 
  why are you so mad anyway ? 
  the amount of penis pictures on / r/new today is too damn high . 
  they 're wolves , not dogs . 
  real [ dire wolves ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dire_wolf ) , here , but i 'm going to assume they 're bigger and scarier . 
  sorry about that , i did a quick search to make up for it , it would appear they were [ northern inuit dog ] ( http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/direwolves#behind-the-scenes ) for the first season and actual wolves for the second season . 
  ... if you 're 16 & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ;, 
  wait a minute , the pope is carried by an scv ? 
  no , you 're just lagging . 
  is there a reference i 'm not catching here ? 
  it 's 11h00 . 
  i 've been awake for 4 hours now . 
  why , `` me '' , of course . 
  he 's a successful fat nerd , and a nice guy at it , doing cool stuff for his fans . 
  that 's why reddit loves him . 
  not your title , that 's for sure . 
  hey , sure , would n't mind having one , kinda low on money with this damned eurocrisis at the moment . 
  let them sleep . 
  not a problem . 
  unfortunately , not many people heard of him , and i 'm not actually sure why . 
  if you do that , they 'll want fembruary , where they also wo n't shave any of their parts . 
  you sure you want that ? 
  are you bragging about buying 3 games at once or something ? 
  so i suppose you are against rehabilitation ? 
  i 'm not sure if i 'm interpreting it correctly , but the aspect ratio would give you an angle 's tangent . 
  after you know which angle that would be , it 's easy to find it by using arc-tangent , and you can just multiply your diagonal 's length with the sine or cosine of said angle and you get your screen 's dimensions . 
  now forgive me if i use the wrong terms , i do n't speak english as my first language , but , for example , if your aspect ratio is 16:9 , and tangent is calculated by doing the opposite cathetus/adjacent catetus , that would mean your angle would be between the diagonal and shortest side of the screen ( the adjacent cathetus ) . 
  let d = diagonal , s = side , b = bottom , a = aspect ratio , i = angle between s and d , assuming a = b/s . 
  s = d cos i, 
  b = d sin i, 
  it 's also a good method . 
  what he is saying is this :, 
  d ^ 2 = s ^ 2 + b ^ 2, 
  with a = b/s comes b = as, 
  thus ,, 
  d ^ 2 = a ^ 2 s ^ 2 + s ^ 2 < =  d ^ 2 = s ^ 2 ( a ^ 2 + 1 ) < =  s ^ 2 = d ^ 2 / ( a ^ 2 + 1 ), 
  you can now calculate s and use the first formula to calculate b ,, 
  b ^ 2 = d ^ 2 - s ^ 2, 
  ` ctrl + f portugal ' indeed . 
  not a native english speaker here , so this may sound an awfully silly question :, 
  what the heck is a false logistic ? 
  i never realised she said that because , again , as a non-native english speaker , many things do get lost in translation and i just interpret what i think i hear . 
  now i wonder how much stuff in firefly have i lost due to that . 
  i might have to rewatch it . 
  again !, 
  i do n't get the first one . 
  i speak a bit of french , was he supposed to say ` mais il est fou ' ? 
  it 's an internet typo , how did that turn into a meme ? 
  i do n't understand why you listed the reconquista . 
  it really is n't . 
  reconquista means to conquer again . 
  the moors first invaded and conquered the iberian peninsula , because they wanted good and fertile lands . 
  to say they did it because of religion is very naive . 
  they did n't . 
  so what the spanish and portuguese did was not a religious war , they simply retook their ancestral lands they were pushed out of . 
  even what happened to the jews was political , although religion did play a big part in it . 
  the nobles were jealous of jew power , and forced the king to kick them out . 
  now the inquisition ? 
  sure , that was a terrible religous thing , no arguments there . 
  source for all this : i 'm portuguese , i should know !, 
  do n't get it , what 's that one supposed to be ? 
  because the sketch is wild .
