  i think he was calling wikipedia participants a bunch of nerds . 
  not sure , though . 
  love it , thanks !, 
  because it looks like op is basically bragging about a witty comment , rather than letting the other person answer , thus starting what could have been an interesting conversation . 
  maybe i 'm reading your post wrong , but you seem to have overlooked the influence of earth 's orbit itself :, 
  for a person standing somewhere on earth , its rotation around its axis will propel you at a speed of about [ 465 m s ^ -1 ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2*pi*%28mean+earth+radius%29%2f%281+sidereal+day%29+in+m%2fs ) , but the earth is also travelling at a speed of nearly [ 30000 m s ^ -1 ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2*pi*%281+astronomical+unit%29%2f%281+sidereal+year%29+in+m%2fs ) , that is , about 64 times faster . 
  i tried googling it , but without much success ... would you mind explaining a non-english native speaker what betty means here ? 
  i 'm with you , sometimes i enjoy watching those tv shows with cake makers that build some solar system out of this weird material . 
  they look amazing , but the cake itself looks fake as hell , like some sort of pre-baked giant cookie covered in edible plasticine . 
  [ here you go ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmnzrjryqni ) . 
  what , were you really expecting anyone to say porn ? 
  he does , but that does n't mean it 's cool . 
  i do n't get it , how is plain text ever nsfw ? 
  because they grow up enjoying their version of football with their friends and family , we grow up enjoying our version of football with our friends and family . 
  are you just browsing / r/new and pasting that in every piece of shit topic like this that pops up ? 
  or are you actually a bot ? 
  i 'm from portugal . 
  our rival is spain . 
  they tried to conquer us dozen of times for 900 years , always failing when the military was involved , succeeding only once because their king was cousin to our dead one . 
  we started the discovery age , and were very successful at it for a few centuries , but they had more people and resources and eventually took over our might . 
  they 're also * nuestros hermanos * !, 
  an american once came to my country and said some typical american ignorant bullshit about our history . 
  i talked to him for hours about how he was wrong , and gave him a complete course on portuguese history . 
  now that i think of it , it probably was n't funny . 
  i was drunk . 
  poor guy ... 
  you would die of subnutrition . 
  play something online . 
  i [ invent long and well-written story ] . 
  [ funny one-liner , in bold ], 
  thing is , some of those inventions actually helped create nations . 
  naval technology comes to mind . 
  i dunno , it looks rather happy to be honest . 
  what the fuck . 
  why must every swedish food look like vomit ? 
  i mean , i 'm sure it tastes awesome , but it looks terrible . 
  just to be clear , toe = theory of everything ? 
  right now ? 
  lawyer or finances . 
  being a crook 's what 's giving money !, 
  i have no idea what those sizes mean , but well done nevertheless !, 
  you look more beautiful now . 
  not at all , it is phonetically based on my real name . 
  it would sound weird at first , but i 'd deal with it . 
  is that a bat ? 
  a pen . 
  the thing about this quote being overused is that whenever i want to find it all i have to do is google for donkey emission . 
  the sun . 
  and i do n't mean because of its benefits for physical health , i mean i 'd be depressed if i moved to a permanently cloudy country . 
  so ... what 's the price of eggs in the us ? 
  what women want . 
  what 's with the second picture , is that some sort of drive-thru crooked lawyer ? 
  i kill you . 
  they said 2012 was the end . 
  they was wrong . 
  the cure for procrastination . 
  as a portuguese person , i understand you . 
  just like what it shows in that image . 
  well , it is black ... 
  what are you , 12 ? 
  where are you from ? 
  why would they have godzilla ? 
  well , til new zealand has utc + 13 . 
  i thought the limit was + 12 , but i guess that 's daylight saving time or something . 
  well , for what it 's worth , i have a little stain on my screen and it showed up with your post . 
  it 's not red , no , but you made me clean it so at least it 's something productive of yours !, 
  neither does christianity , actually . 
  fuck you . 
  fuck you too . 
  this is a silly question , but are geese in central park actually wild ? 
  i suppose it climbed the other car 's tire ? 
  why ? 
  is your boss behind your back , reading the stuff you should n't be reading ? 
  it 's for images with sexual or mature nature . 
  literally , images that are not safe for work . 
  because , you know , people who are far away could be able to see them . 
  that is , however , not really the case with text . 
  it ca n't be read from far away , and it 's as useful to tag a post about kitties nsfw as it is to tag something like this . 
  tagging text posts nsfw is not a rule usually enforced here , as far as i know . 
  i 'm not surprised by your comment . 
  i am surprised , however , that nobody responded `` i was going 2 say that !, 
  i also enjoyed `` winter is coming '' , even if it 's quite obvious what it was supposed to mean . 
  you might be interested in knowing about x , it opens up the image associated with your post . 
  so , x , a or z accordingly , x to close it if you wish , j , repeat . 
  tipo . 
  no it is n't . 
  it would be if it were 13.02638888888 hours right now . 
  actually , no it would n't , you 'd still need to decimalise hours , days and years . 
  it 's true that the second is a basic unit of the si , and it is used decimally , but you do need to convert it . 
  eg , an interval of 1h must be converted to 3600s . 
  [ oh you ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4o2qdhue2fa/t76gzcg_cwi/aaaaaaaaffw/yzvx9e7dcu4/s1600/jaqen_h%2527ghar.png ) . 
  no rabo do psychamele0n . 
  not entirely . 
  as i said , the second is the basic unit of time for the metric system , but only for scientific purposes . 
  unlike the meter , which is commonly used by the layman in countries under the metric system , you never hear anyone say they 'll be at a place in 3.56 kiloseconds . 
  that said , the other time units are also accepted in the scientific world precisely because they are easier to identify , but they must always be converted to seconds . 
  mind you , what i 'm calling metric here is what is used in the layman world , really . 
  i mean , correct me if i 'm wrong , but the scientific and engineering worlds in the us already use the metric system , right ? 
  why did you switch to german in the end ? 
   portugal 's economic pain is your gain in porto,
