  m\u00e9dico 2 :, 
  seven kings of men were given seven rings of power , as is written in lotr . 
  the witch king was one of those , the king of the iron throne of angmar , at the time , and he nearly destroyed the west of middle earth before he was defeated and went into exile , rebuilding his strength , about one thousand years before the war of the ring . 
  to put it simpler : he was a king of men , once , got his ring , got really powerful , almost wiped out everything in half of middle-earth , was defeated by an alliance of elves and men , returned when sauron told him to , in the war of the ring . 
  so , what events ? 
  oops , i knew it was nine , the nine nazg\u00fbl , but mentioned seven like an idiot . 
  my bad indeed . 
  south korea needs more starcraft . 
  i ca n't tell you for sure ( pirate_archer will ) , but that wikipedia layout is from the [ battle of aljubarrota ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_aljubarrota ) , the biggest victory portugal ever had against castille . 
  trevo is portuguese for clover ( 4chan symbol , i suppose ) , jota means jay ( the letter , j ) , but i suppose it 's meant to rhyme with aljubarrota , somehow . 
  i 'm not a 4chan user at all , so this is all just wild guesses . 
  funny you mention caesar because that does look a lot like a laurel wreath . 
  i 'm curious now , how do you read `` hue '' in english ? 
  in portuguese , i read it ( with brazillian accent ) as something like a baby cry . 
  allright , i thought so , it makes `` huetiful '' sound great indeed !, 
  and yes , that is about it , in portuguese . 
  edit : nevermind . 
  china seems to be eating israel 's parachute . 
  is it ... is it me or are the wives wearing makeup ? 
  i really like it . 
  i approve of shadowed parenthesis to help me navigate around the calculations . 
  looking forward for more math tools !, 
  in canada , even the sea is really cold . 
  took some time to load . 
  ca n't tell if image is too big or just i.minus . 
  tens casos e casos . 
  you can do it with any page on facebook , all i did was search for ninth doctor and copy the numbers in the end of whatever page first popped . 
  that 's because he does n't believe in a sixth sense . 
  neither do i. 
  backpacking sounds great , but i 'd sleep in proper places , who knows what kind of weird hobo would show up like that ? 
  they do in portugal . 
  in spain too , i suppose . 
  there 's a lot of chinese around here and they always swap the rrs with lls . 
  `` clepe '' instead of `` crepe '' and `` lalanja '' instead of `` laranja '' . 
  do keep in mind that our rrs sound different than in english . 
  it 's one thing i find funny on reddit , every time i see chinese being made fun of , they speak the opposite of what i 'm used to !, 
  the ball with the crescent , is that turkey ? 
  and what 's with the o and e ? 
  ottoman empire , i take it ? 
  if you look at the tombstone , you are hue'ing quite a lot even if you 're dead !, 
  we probably have better food anyway !, 
  now i need the conclusion of that last paragraph !, 
  they have been noticed , yes . 
  they show more than that , if i recall correctly there is also a part about the doom of valiria and targaryen conquest of the seven kingdoms . 
  lovely to see a low dimensional string theory game . 
  it 's eight in the afternoon , is tired a mood ? 
  freedom for nk .

  why is luigi asking himself for help ? 
  and should n't mario , the star , be the one dieing ? 
  now i am confused why first brazil ball has two colours , if it was drawn . 
  that does n't look like france .

  how someone can defend such an outdated measuring system is beyond me . 
  fahrenheit has got nothing on celsius or kelvin , it 's far worse , for scientists . 
  but as far as your argument goes , if a person is taught as a child that the range of temperatures in weather in their area go from about , for example , 10 \u00b0 c , a cold day , to 35 \u00b0 c , a hot day , they will feel about the same as you do when you say temperatures in weather in your particular area go from 0 f to 80 f. 
  my point is , fahrenheit is only used because people are still being taught it as children . 
  same for pretty much any of the imperial system of units . 
  but as far as real usefulness goes , it has none . 
  the metric system , because it 's based on the power of ten , is far superior in usefulness . 
   one thing portugal wo n't have a shortage of is old people , since the over 65 age group is projected to grow and grow , even as the working population shrinks and shrinks . 
  no wonder the young are leaving , even if the youth unemployment rate was n't 38.3 % , just think of all the taxes and social security contributions the remaining young people are going to have to pay just to keep the welfare ship afloat . 
  patriotism at the end of the day has its limits . 
  why is poland upside down into space ? 
  here 's another you may have heard in many different movies and games , too , the [ howie scream ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4dx2dbwttk ) . 
  brothers were brothers and she turned out awesome . 
  i do n't know , you can see the sky , i thought you could never see the sky north of the alps . 
  needs more * chaparro * . 
  if you want to be fed bullshit . 
  it 's true .

  til drinking is really expensive in north america . 
  i 've never seen that woman in my life , yet i can hear her loud and clear !, 
  i do n't know , think of how many people were n't born because of world of warcraft . 
  hey , nothing wrong with portuguese women !, 
  who can blame them ? 
  americans can only see one type of red . 
  freedom red . 
  i see a lot of purple in that link . 
  a comfortable car , yes ? 
   in russian , it is called indeyka which is related to the word for native american, 
  so is the english indian , and the same for several languages , is n't it ? 
  they are different , yes , but related . 
  in portuguese , you have `` ind\u00edo '' for native american and `` indiano '' for someone from india ( both male , yes ) . 
  they are not the same , yet they are related ( and there 's an historical reason for that ) . 
  edit : this is unrelated to the bird at all , i was just curious about the [ indio ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indio ) vs [ indian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indian ) . 
  * terra * is the latin name for our planet , and still used for pretty much every romance languages . 
  that got me curious , how would you call the natives of earth ( rather than humans ) in proper english ? 
  in portuguese , you 've got several ways , ` terr\u00e1queos ' , ` terrenos ' , ` terrestres ' ( best one for european portuguese i believe ) , and as you can see they are all based on terra . 
  there are coordinates in the image . 
  the thing i love the most about this subreddit is how international it is . 
  i have nothing against americans at all , but because reddit is an us site , pretty much every subreddit follows a lot of their trends and cultural rules ( halloween , thanksgiving , etc , you know what i mean ) . 
  not here , though . 
  it does n't feel that way at all . 
  this subreddit is very cosmopolitan , because you see submissions about topics from all over the world . 
  you can either see poor european nations , the huesome adventures of brazil , fat america or , of course , beloved poland . 
  humour does a great way in opening doors between cultures .
