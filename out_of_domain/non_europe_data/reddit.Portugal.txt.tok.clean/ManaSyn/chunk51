  and the comments follow that line , too . 
  people are willing to share their countries culture , and others are willing to listen to it . 
  i like that a lot .

  that would be melkor . 
  nine years for ten million , forty-five years for fifty !, 
  worth a watch indeed . 
  thanks for the video . 
  what a crazy , crazy country . 
  no , i meant melkor allright . 
  morgoth is but a shadow of the true power of melkor . 
  edit : and yes , i know they are one and the same . 
  but morgoth is a less powerful melkor , as it has lost his ability to change its form at will , among , i am sure , other things . 
  edit2 : just for the fun of it , i googled a bit around and wikipedia , of all places , actually has an interesting view on it :, 
   in late writings a distinction is made between the ainu melkor , the most powerful of eru 's created beings , and morgoth , the diminished being that styled itself dark lord of arda . 
  this distinction is not limited to the change in name ( `` arises in might '' to `` dark enemy '' ) . 
   as described in ainulindal\u00eb , melkor 's discord marred the music of the ainur in heaven . 
  melkor 's thematic variations in that music amounted to his own self-elaboration . 
  ( each ainu arose from a divine theme , existing beforehand only in the mind of eru . ), 
  e\u00e4 , or the world that is , is shaped after the music . 
  thus , the evil that melkor weaves into the music was mirrored in e\u00e4 by the evil he wove into the fabric of reality . 
  as a result , the world arda was `` marred '' : the conceptions of the valar never came about , and melkor 's very essence was present in all creation . 
   melkor 's inability to perform true creation is tied to the idea that something of his actual being must pass into the things he `` created '' , in order to give them an effective substance and reality . 
  melkor could not create anything , as he did not possess the flame imperishable ; thus he could only create a mockery of those things in arda . 
  from his trolls to the sun ( which was made from a flower from a tree poisoned by ungoliant , and was thus itself imperfect ) , melkor 's power and essence was poured into arda . 
  melkor 's individual self was diminished as a consequence . 
  he was reduced to morgoth , the `` dark enemy '' ( poetically elaborated as `` the black foe of the world '' ) . 
   morgoth , once the most powerful being in e\u00e4 , spent his will on his vast armies and followers , so that in the war of wrath , as his armies were swept away before the host of aman , he was captured by e\u00f6nw\u00eb and cast off his throne . 
  morgoth 's spirit was cast out beyond the walls of night , yet his presence remains as the pervasive corruption of the world , `` even until the end of days . 
  [ yes ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1%25+of+a+lightyear+in+ua ) . 
   but it is kind of weird since the netherlands = / = holland . 
  but people still think that they 're the same here . 
  is g. r. r. an ent ?

  wtf happened in [ 1663 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1663 ) ? 
  her majesty 's aussie ship ? 
  i 'm curious , what is portugal doing there ? 
  hey , hey !, 
  we are n't damn commies here !, 
  we 're just free democratic socialists !, 
  funny thing is , it is the other way around in other languages . 
  i ca n't certainly speak for others , but asians do swap r 's with l 's in portuguese . 
  ran out of maple paint , did ya ? 
  i thought it was just an easter egg about amelia pond , rory williams ' wife , and how the eleventh doctor is better than ten . 
  so is this why we all have funny hats ? 
  i can assume by the number of your hats that you probably still do n't understand anything !, 
  edit : what , you just had some twenty hats , now you have one !, 
  this is a better fight :, 
  nathan fillion responds , and his pun is related to firefly . 
  i was wondering what the hell this was about , it really looks like a medicine case ... 
  [ provo , utah ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/provo,_utah ) ( check flag in the right ) , for those wondering . 
  nice find , i guess !, 
  so , black wally then ? 
  you do n't know if he 's american , nor canadian . 
  people seem to think the way to use it is by pushing the lever as you are turning the wheel . 
  no , his name is wally , you 're just translating it into ` murican . 
  much like the person you responded to . 
  semantics ( or whatever this is ) aside , i do prefer your term because , as a non-american , i find the term # - american quite laughable , but i can understand why he used it . 
   his name is waldo regardless of where any of us live . 
  this is where you are wrong , sorry . 
  his original name , in english even , is [ wally ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/where's_wally%3f ) . 
  so for all you know , he could either be an african american waldo , a black english wally , a black [ take-your-picks ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/where%27s_wally#international_editions ) or even a black canadian waldo !,

  yes , you should . 
  just try not to think of mance rayder . 
  hah , come on . 
  i 'm one of seven , and even though there are times when i wish they all jumped off a cliff , now that we are all grown up , it is a pretty damn amazing and unique thing to have !, 
  that would be because you may have poor communication skills in speech , and are considerably better at writing stuff down , because you can take your time and reconsider what you are writing . 
  i am like that too , but is it really just an introverted thing ? 
  looks a lot like some japanese game background , even . 
  doctor m. erica , * libertas doctor * . 
  uhm , does this qualify as punchline in the title ? 
  if you 're using grams in the second image , may as well use kg in the first , for science , yo !, 
  i 'd translate 0.4 grams to imperial but i have no idea what unit you use for something that small ... 
  just an opinion , bro !, 
  is there any particular reason for the transparent eyepatch for portugal and spain ? 
  the exponential growth of this subreddit ( the ten thousand mark was reached [ 8 days ago ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/1b1km3/10000_abonentow_uslug_internetowych/ ) , and we 're already over eleven thousand ! ), 
  must mean a lot of work coming up for you good people . 
  keep up the good work !, 
  yes , i understand it now , read it the other way around , in speech . 
  yeah , but why a eyepatch rather than a monocle or just a normal eye is what i 'm wondering . 
  maybe iberia is of pirates ? 
  huzzah for southern states [ drinks beer ], 
  ` urop , quite right !, 
  why is a group of boars called a singular ? 
  yeah , if you hear the word ` new ' in europe , chances are it 's centuries old . 
  just like the new world , actually . 
  it 's okay if you hear us say ` brand new ' , though , ca n't be older than fifty years . 
  the artist tried to improve all mounts equally . 
  atlantic coast of spain = portugal , toda a gente sabe . 
  argue then , because that makes little sense to me said like that . 
  yes , it can be dangerous , in heavy traffic . 
  but how is it in anyway much more dangerous than being above the speed limit , specially in the same condition of heavy traffic ? 
  holy shit , i had those too , the memories . 
  so is the second reich of mordor ? 
  unrelated :, 
  a random_girl shows up on the internet , there 's always a hero being friendly to her . 
  would that really work , though ?
