  i mean , what that would is to bring forth the popular opinions and bury the rest , even though the latter could start an interesting argument . 
  the kid at the end who got stared at cracked me up for some reason . 
  i dunno , he only said you have a girlfriend and are not an orphan . 
  maybe he was trying to be a nice lad ? 
  do n't get the reference ( s ) . 
  i 'm from europe if that helps .

  some have nice colours , sure , but that 's it .

  i am confused , can a corporation actually arrest people in the us ? 
  and for how long can they hold them ? 
  if there is a limit ... 
  well , it might be better than `` anti-polish '' , that just sounds dirty .

  that is actually illegal where i come from . 
  what , i have four sisters and i never had a boner for any , are you from the south or something ? 
  do you really need an answer ? 
  so guys , i need to know , when do classes for high school end in america ? 
  because i might need to stop coming to reddit then . 
  other cultures , for a few months . 
  that thumbnail made me think he was screaming with a spider on his face . 
  i really do n't think it is related to guns that much . 
  this is much more a cultural issue . 
  london has 1.6 per 100,000 murder rate , that 's 0.0016 % as stated in the article , not 0.0016 per 100,000 ... 
  no , a culture of violence and individuality rather than peace and community . 
  london is hardly a peaceful place , yes . 
  but that is an extreme case , the rioting , and most murders in the world happen in homes rather than in big groups of people , i would say . 
  edit : i hail from lisbon , which coincidentally is the most peaceful city in that article , and i too am against guns for the average people , but i wo n't go as far as saying that guns are that heavily responsible for people dieing . 
  if anything , i 'm sure guns have also saved some lives . 
  pre and post pok\u00e9mon . 
  evidently , i am the former . 
  there just has to be a specific year where people who were born before that never gave a shit about pok\u00e9mon because it was n't present in their childhood and those born after are crazy about the damn thing . 
  edit : heh , mayhaps i misread the question . 
  fair enough , i stand corrected , as long as the facts are reliable . 
  london is indeed a violent city . 
  but i thought that if you did wanted to murder someone , any tool works . 
  sure , guns make it easier and more definitive , though . 
  that , however , does not adress the individuality part of culture i mentioned . 
  maybe londoners just give more value to the life of others than new yorkers ?

  it has 6.593 million sq miles ( 17.08 million km \u00b2 ) . 
  they do n't . 
  i hope you gave him some actual advice after that . 
  hey , at least it 's not duckface . 
  on the contrary , it 's a reason to try and learn some more .

  in one hour someone 's going to post about how they planted that note , on reddit . 
   ajay kapur , a global stratigist at citigroup , coined the term , [ 1 ] which became public knowledge on 16 october 2005 when citigroup published a large memo defining the meaning and the scope of the term . 
  hm , that sounds awfully far fetched , but might be to me as i do n't speak the language every day . 
  thanks anyway !, 
  bring some american girls . 
  could use some here in portugal . 
  yes i am . 
  but i 'm about to get up . 
  this is incredibly creepy . 
  okay , i laughed . 
  thanks !, 
  i can be lazy and still be rather well informed about the world . 
  you are used to looking at yourself in the mirror . 
  this is the image your brain has of yourself . 
  it is a wrong image , as it is inverted . 
  so when you see a picture and check that your hairline , your marks , everything , is on the other side , it looks weird . 
  actually , the people who know you only know that side . 
  it 's not weird nor ugly for them . 
  if you showed them your mirror image , they 'd probably find it weird . 
  one thing you can do is to grab those pictures and just invert them horizontally . 
  maybe you 'd recognize yourself then . 
  edit : although , mind you , because you ca n't actually do your best pose , you will always find yourself uglier than what you really are .

  there was a iama or something recently about a company that sold ideas for other companies far away . 
  i remember it was called firefly in homage to the show , and their logo was a light bulb with wings . 
  i found it brilliant . 
  wish i could find it again !,

  no , they really are n't . 
  how about you pay attention ?

  to be fair , i would n't have said anything if it was n't for the rubbish title . 
  it 's not that i want to see more , but i would really like a source to know what the fuck is happening . 
  are you wasting your parents money , or you pay it yourself ? 
  or lucky enough to live in a country where it does n't cost hundreds of thousands ? 
  it 's an american thing .
