  please do n't take this the wrong way , i just find it fascinating how people sailed in such small ships . 
  you know , you can prevent anyone from entering your country and you will also have fewer terrorists . 
  actually , quixote is the original , it is quijote now , in spanish . 
  check the image of the book 's cover in [ here ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/don_quijote_de_la_mancha ) . 
  why would you torture someone even if he was guilty ?

  everyone says portuguese and russian sound very similar . 
  those are offensive terms , we prefer the word ` black ' . 
  phonetically , close enough . 
  to european portuguese , that is .

  [ source in portuguese ] ( http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/lista_de_reis_de_portugal#titulatura_r.c3.a9gia ) , but foreigners can see that almost all of them have it .

  how does them being from syria explains that , though ? 
  to be honest , i could see it happening in some redneck american town , or in mexico , or whatever .

  fair enough . 
  there 's no clay in the expanded english channel !, 
  i 'm merely giving this a thought , but i have a question about comic making :,

  they are generally very talkative and friendly and whatnot . 
  also , i kinda hate to say this about anyone at all , but they are generally dirty and sweaty . 
  we do not , and it pains me to see it used for portugal on this sub . 
  in fact , i was going to make a depressing month entry about how portugal is reduced to ` hue ' after being a global empire , but i did n't have the time ( not that it is actually historically relevant anyway !,

   she got stink-eye for speaking portuguese when she visited spain .
