  but i really do n't think madeira wants to be independent , it 's just an empty threat from their everlasting president in order to get more moneis . 
  also , i love the attention to detail !, 
  dude , there 's spoilers all over that cradle !, 
  we are doomed to pay for the huances of our children :(, 
  what kind of orange juice ? 
  natural , or whatever sweetened version of it one may have at home ? 
  reason i ask is because i usually have fresh oranges at home but never any orange juice . 
  are oranges fine or would i need to do some juice and add sugar to it ? 
  i 'm not diabetic , but i generally do wake up awfully early ( 5 something early ) with no reason to . 
  what 's this , someone is working for fun ? 
  what is this phenomenon ? 
  why did the piigs bath for saudi arabia ? 
  oh do n't worry about that , i just have too much attention to detail . 
  is miss liberty supposed to show the french flag somehow ? 
  are we practicing political correctness now ? 
  or portugal , poor portugal . 
  e sources ? 
  not sure who is speaking in the 8th panel ... 
  i was quite puzzled by the ` non-violent prisioners ' . 
  you really are n't known for non-violence in anything , sorry : /, 
  do you actually pronounce the last two letters as * way * in english ? 
  almost made it but he had to get himself killed on a faraway beach !, 
  also , what does berry mach mean ? 
  i wonder if my countryman also did n't get the joke and that 's why he called philippines a pain in the ass . 
  or is there also another joke in ` chata ' that i also am not getting , and should rather drink my coffee ? 
  that 's what it means , actually . 
  pain in the ass , picky , annoying , boring , all the same !, 
  female version of the word too , if that matters anything . 
  okay , so first person to filter that sound will make a fortune . 
  get to it !, 
  to be fair , magalh\u00e3es looks a bit enthusiastic about it ( until the last panel ) , not bored or annoyed . 
  as for the other question , that would depend on what lies on the bottom of the philippines !, 
  well , i ca n't say i have seen much of trinidad and tobago around , nice to see some fresh , uh , balls . 
  or was there any specific reason for that one ? 
  like [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=j71vxxji_5y#t=73s ) ? 
  i linked to a bit later in the movie , but he said before he was doing his filipino accent , his american accent and then an exaggerated filipino accent . 
  / r/swecirclejerk, 
  which one ? 
  there 's like seven . 
  it makes me ask questions , and accept my responsibilities as my own . 
  let 's be honest , though , he has reasons for it . 
  americans seem overly defensive of their country compared to any other nation on this subreddit , except for sealand . 
  how so ? 
  could i have not understood that there is nothing to help me but myself ( and human society ) after i realised there are no superior beings ? 
  i do n't understand why you get the [ magnanimous ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pedro_ii_of_brazil ) as leader and we get the [ crazy queen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maria_i_of_portugal ) whose only events of note was fleeing portugal and elevating brazil into a kingdom , thus beginning its independence process ( no offense , we could have used your monies for a bit longer !, 
  we had so much better leaders & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ;, 
  ex-girlfriend *, 
  indeed . 
  i do n't care much about belonging , but if i did , this would be a great place to start . 
  it 's okay , just do n't be the black guy in the movie . 
  for a moment i wondered what were the big lakes in russia : /, 
  it checks out . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sucralose#history ) a wikipedia link for a til repost later . 
  til chemists test chemicals by taste . 
  i 'm not american , so could you elucidate me what you mean with major sports ? 
  so what was the look on the face of whoever opened the gift first ? 
  i wish you had portrayed some strong winds to show the kamikaze in the last panel . 
  still , it shows bad weather , and i love the water patterns !, 
  it is the building style , yes . 
  most our warehouses look like that , really . 
  ugly , but sturdy . 
  while it might be that one , i doubt you hit jackpot that easily , sorry . 
  nice novelty account , i suppose . 
  this is reddit , so yes , probably . 
  european penises shaped the americans of today . 
  i 'm awful at making gifs , and i do n't know if this has been said already , but i found it funny what [ adwd ] ( #b ` tyrion said about going across the narrow sea and juggle ' ) . 
  way i see it , the second one . 
  tywin climbed the stairs both to be able to look at his grandson from above and to show the little brat that stairs are n't hard , but he could be carried if he really whined about it so much . 
  where 's best korea ? 
  why does texas look like walter white ? 
  so you did n't learn it after all . 
  so i 'm curious about this american tradition ; what are you talking about ? 
  is it customary to prank people ? 
  and what people ? 
  there are better , more civilized ways to get what you want . 
  this does nothing but make us both upset . 
  i would love to talk to you in [ face ] and discuss your issues like a normal person . 
  thank you . 
  ca n't quite tell what 's in the [ ] , and my english is n't strong enough to venture a good guess ... 
  i 'm actually wondering what is it you do . 
  i come from a country where pranking is so strong people dress up for it , and there are hierarchies and rules and whatnot . 
  it sounds fancy , but it is n't , although most people do n't get and think it 's but a joke . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/praxe if you are curious . 
  `` how hard is it for you '', 
  okay , that 's all the puns we need . 
  almost all of them . 
  yeah , what exactly counts as sex offender in the states ? 
  or rather , what does n't ? 
  there 's nothing wrong with you or your parents . 
  they are repetitive , and you have more important things to do . 
  it 's normal . 
  would you rather fight a horse-sized duck or 100 bacon sized switcharoos ? 
  snoo . 
  i said there is nothing wrong with you or your parents . 
  i never said there 's nothing wrong with other redditors or society in general . 
  society is fucked up and , yes , life 's much easier if you are just like the other drones . 
  but it feels great to be different than most people around you , even if sometimes it hurts . 
  besides , there 's always someone around like you . 
  it 's hard to find , but there is . 
  the only thing that is wrong with your question is the first `` america '' .
