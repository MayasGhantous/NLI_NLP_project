  well , what about panama ? 
  there are no british in the uk in the summer , they 're all in iberia . 
  this was posted in / r/gameofthrones , as was this comment that i did enjoy :, 
   eau d'or . 
  i 'd love to link the source but i can not seem to find it ... 
  edit : why did i bother with reddit search system ? 
  googled it , instant find :, 
  nah , it 's okay , foreigners are n't people and can be spied and killed at will . 
  source : i 'm a worthless foreigner . 
  how is he misleading with the title ? 
  maybe his friend does have the shirt and he noticed it . 
  it has been seen before , yes . 
  does n't mean op is a faggot . 
   it 's not his friend because the same photo had been reposted before . 
  prove it . 
  edit :, 
  i 've done a bit of work for you :, 
  [ karmadecay results ] ( http://karmadecay.com/r/funny/comments/1h64f5/noticed_something_familiar_about_my_friends/ ) . 
  as you can see , no match . 
  again , just because it has been noticed before , it does n't mean op is reposting . 
  i dislike the ` my friend found this ' format as much as the next redditor , and even worse if it 's an actual repost . 
  but this one is n't . 
  you get used to it . 
  saying that a percentage is what 's good for humans is bullshit . 
  i can tell someone it 's about 30 \u00b0 c and they 'll understand exactly what i mean . 
  still , i liked this one 's title . 
  well , i 'm european , and to be completly honest with you ... that the us govnt is spying on us while pretending to be our friends really , really does n't feel like news . 
  everyone knew that already , without any need for evidence . 
  i mean , is n't it really obvious for you , too ? 
  so , yes , i can tell you that no one was shocked . 
  why should we ? 
  it 's like saying big bankers steal money , or some other really obvious thing . 
  oh , we wo n't hit you , do n't worry . 
  we 'll just hide what we 're doing untill you go away !, 
  well , til yankee does n't mean all americans . 
  because all middle easterners are jihadists ... 
  so i googled [ * tu quoque * ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/punch-tu_quoque_1904.jpg ) ... 
  which one , obama 's or europe 's ? 
  obama 's . 
  well , i guess it 's a good thing i never got that , right ? 
  bran 's wolf , summer , is also still around . 
  wtf , this post makes portugal look of relevance , what is this nonsense ? 
   but really , outside the us it generally refers to any american ( or canadian ) . 
  it only refers to us people where i come from , not canadians . 
  those we call canadians . 
  i believe you :, 
  by the end of this morning , the word sorry will be feeling very weird indeed . 
  second time i 've seen it mentioned ; what are these rose glasses ? 
  [ the ecstasy of gold ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wv0wpbydq6y ) ? 
  what if someone calls you asking where did you go ? 
  may as well :, 
  why is there a shower head in the right side of the banner ? 
  it helped me !, 
  is n't blond used for males ( esl here ) ? 
  crazy wasps . 
  it 's not like you say the party is happening in 8/7/2013 anyway . 
  i bet you must have a blast with today 's flair . 
  it 's also funny there is always someone complaining about how american jokes are overdone . 
  but i guess it makes sense , as the vast majority of redditors are from the us . 
  oap = old age pensioner ? 
  you wasps and your damn acronyms ... 
  yes , but for everyone , not just those who can afford it . 
  the british have their own sense of humour . 
  thankfully . 
  basically , what he 's doing , although crudly explained , is this :, 
  volume of mediterranean = area of world oceans x change of height in sea level due to the filling of the mediterranean . 
  vm = aw x \u0394h < =  vm/aw = \u0394h, 
  or yellow . 
  preposterous !, 
  this is awesome , but shame about the imperial units , though . 
  if this is in spain , why is the translation in portuguese ? 
  or is it galician ? 
  hate being picky , but why did n't portugal 's colours swapped when seen from behind like france did ? 
  there 's no such thing as an american accent either , for that matter . 
  evidently , it shows how engineers will eat three chocolates in a row like it was nothing . 
  that 's okay , we do n't tip anywhere at all . 
  what 's the shoulder patch ? 
  what does that mean ? 
  it means faith . 
  thank you for answering . 
  no idea why i 'm being downvoted for asking it , it 's not an obvious thing at all . 
  ( 4 / 3 ) + ( 4 / 3 ) = 2.667 rounded to 3, 
  uh , i 'm afraid 2.667 is actually half-life 2 episode 2 :(, 
  indeed . 
  while american culture is much more spread than any other , you good folks are still as foreign to me as i am to you . 
  my city 's strange small and irregular streets are common to me , your little towns in the middle of nowhere with a barbershop and a diner are something i would really like to see . 
  it seems like such an interesting way to live . 
  boring , perhaps , but interesting nonetheless . 
  actually , i 'm not sure about norway , but if they also have a monthly salary , it is usual to be paid a 13th month to compensate for other countries with weekly salary ( 52 weeks per year or 13 months of 4 weeks each ) .

  if it was 1920 , the european powers were much larger than this , these are just the actual territories in europe . 
  only because the map does n't include wildfires which , as far as i know , can be a natural hazard ( but it would be the only one in the list that can also have human causes ) . 
  what is the `` mexico city effect '' ? 
  google tells me about 1985 's earthquakes there but i 'm not entirely sure what it means . 
  which us colonial territory was larger than the us itself ? 
  at least evita ripley will be there to kill them all !, 
  i do n't get the bottom one . 
  if it is telephone numbers , why is there another telephone ? 
  or is it an atm or something else ?
