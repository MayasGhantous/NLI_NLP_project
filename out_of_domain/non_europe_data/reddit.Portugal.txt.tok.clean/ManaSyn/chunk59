  what about pipes ? 
  on the other side of the mirror , i do n't understand how a percentage between cold as fuck and hot as fuck is any good either . 
  you know 80 \u00b0 f is good because you know what it means as much as i know what 26.6 ( 6 ) \u00b0 c is , not because it 's 80 % hot as fuck . 
  everyone defends fahrenheit like that . 
  it 's a bogus argument , because it 's how you feel about a temperature ( which may even vary from person to person ) that matters for the average joe , not a percentage . 
  if you associated 0 to alaska and 40 to florida since you were a child , it would still work . 
  yes it is . 
  think of it this way : you 're a desert man , with temperatures always over 100 \u00b0 f. 
  you have to take a trip to the snowy tundras of farawaykistan where the temperature is around 20 \u00b0 f. 
  does saying it 's 20 \u00b0 f means you know exactly how cold it is , and exactly what clothes you should wear , or you 'll just know it 's quite cold indeed ? 
  likewise , where i come from , temperatures average about 25 \u00b0 c. 
  if someone tells me it 'll be 18 \u00b0 c , i 'll know it 's good for a shirt , 10 \u00b0 c needs some cover , but below 10 i 'll just wear a goddamn jacket no matter where i go . 
  it does n't matter what the scale is for a layman . 
  he 'll use whatever perception he 'll have . 
  heck , you can even tell if the weather is bloody hot or bloody cold without any numbers !, 
  it 's pronounced like * where * , minus the * - re * . 
  what the fuck , i have n't seen the lion king in about twenty years , and that scene 's music immediately kicked in . 
  edit : yes , the lion king is almost twenty years old . 
  not as a 90 's , but as an 80 's ... 
  still not feeling old . 
  go circlejerk somewhere else . 
  i 've seen bambi and the land before time . 
  yes , the mothers die , but they never played any role and are hardly identified as caring and loving mothers . 
  mufasa , on the other hand , is a big strong lion with great personality that resembles one 's father . 
  that 's why his dead had so much impact . 
  what the fuck . 
  i suppose you forgot the price tag in order for this to be creepy .

  did you get stuck at the 6 ' foot 1 '' or you just ca n't convert american heights ?

  yeah i was n't actually being serious .

  never too late to say never , right ? 
  we did establish colonies . 
  your flair is relevant . 
  nice asoiaf reference there too !, 
  so i was wondering why portugal was of european importance , we have no say in anything . 
  then i remembered barroso . 
  yep , he 's so unimportant we too often forget about him . 
  reddit is n't insecure about its relationship ; it has none . 
  morgoth feared a lot of things , though . 
  it is similar to english , yes . 
  for instance , the word ` dad ' . 
  first d is strong , last one not so much . 
  cidade is read just like that , see-dad ( a read like ah ) . 
  as an esl european who has been insulted by an american for saying those exact words , i would like to tell you that i am 95 % sure wilcows meant no offense with it . 
  i have yet to understand why exactly those two words together offends you , as i 'm not sure if you are offended by being grouped with every other american or if you think we feel superior , but it ( usually ) is nothing of the sort , or at least not with an offensive tone . 
  it 's just supposed to mean we do things differently . 
  i 'm dead serious here ; not american : he just meant that you do things different . 
  he differentiated us from you . 
  in fact , the [ people ] is there to make sure the [ you ] is plural , reffering to americans in general rather than just the person he was replying to . 
  [ you ] can be quite a fuzzy word for us esl . 
  so please tell me , what tact is he lacking , and how should he have said according to you ? 
  `` j\u00e1 '' translates to `` now '' , but in the context it means something like `` however '' . 
  for instance :, 
   the sky is blue . 
  now the clouds , they 're white . 
  it is an interesting word ; `` agora '' also means now , and can also be used in the however context , but it does n't happen often . 
  the two together , though , `` j\u00e1 agora '' , mean `` by the way '' :, 
  then i 'm sure you understand it is n't tact that is lacking , but a simple misunderstanding of two different cultures , out of ignorance , possibly . 
  since i learnt `` you people '' offends you , i try to avoid it , but sometimes i still feel the need to show that when i say you , i mean plural . 
  usually i say `` you good folks of the us '' , because that does n't offend anyone . 
  really , single ( singular ? ), 
  and plural you being the same can be very confusing in sentences where no other words are plural , but are directed to many . 
  it can also mean already . 
  '' ** j\u00e1 ** foi feito '' means `` it has ** already ** been done '' . 
  none taken . 
  preciso de windows e possivelmente de linux porque os programas que terei que utilizar funcionam nesses os , para que me serve o ios ?

  it 's enough for high range laptops , sure , but the best are easily over $ 2000 .

  damnit , why did i post in this topic ? 
  yet your image host choice has n't changed since then . 
  this should have been posted to / r/cringe . 
  a wall in the dark . 
  in my country , centigrades is the coloquial term for celsius . 
  weather on tv and radio generally mention maxima of 38 centigrades , for instance . 
   of course , i can already hear some people advocating that even if we convert our other measures over to metric , we should really hold on to our fahrenheit units `` because they 're easier . '', 
  curious , how can it be objectively said that either unit is harder or easier ? 
  you know , it sorta seems that rome is stabbing itself on the second panel . 
  i see you 've been to europe . 
  yes , homer saved a lot of breath . 
  if text = ` xd ', 
  end, 
  yes , and the same can be said for any other country in the world , as far as public opinion is concerned .
