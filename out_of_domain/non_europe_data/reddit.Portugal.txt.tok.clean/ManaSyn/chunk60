  [ just their wives ai n't no good at sewing ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n67s2vt_8w ) . 
  i have six siblings , so my mother , who is a doctor , quit her job and stayed home as a full-time house maid ( this is portugal , being a doctor only means money if you go private ) . 
  so , when i was about ten , after years of saving , i spent 10,000 $ 00 ( escudos , old portuguese coin , about 50 $ , it was a lot of money for me ) , i saw this mop on tv that seemed pretty cool . 
  it had a lever to help remove the water into the bucket , something like [ this ] ( http://www.okokchina.com/files/uppic17/sponge%20mop%20series_pva%20mop263.jpg ) . 
  i bought it , with the adult help of my father , and gave it to her on mother 's day . 
  she told me later that it felt a both awkward as if i thought of her as a cleaning maid , but then she realised it was my own special way of thanking and helping her . 
  so , yes , the mop worked just fine . 
  and so did the gift . 
  i would say that an english speaker , given his full time oral practice of the language , is more often inclined to do ortographical mistakes such as spelling and punctuation , but with reasonably correct grammar , whereas us foreigners tend to literally translate our own oral knowledge of our language and create grammatically incorrect sentences in english . 
  just a total guess , to be honest , but i can usually identify my own countrymen , if they are n't very good at english , because i read a sentence that makes little sense but is easily recognisable in my language . 
  sometimes it can be both , refering to the english language without capitalizing ( not done in my language ) , and using s or z in recognisable and capitalizing .

  wait till you learn about specialists . 
  you get the resource , but i think you lose any bonus from buildings/policies that depend on the improvement , eg , if you build your city on top of horses , you wo n't be able to build a pasture , thus no stables that would give that tile one extra hammer , if there 's no other tile that could get a pasture , of course . 
  portugal and greece are not children , they are of old , at least compared to germany . 
  that 's why they 're bad with money . 
   are attributed the greatest land discovery in history, 
  first time i ever heard such . 
  i mean , i can see it happening , even if half of south america was explored by the portuguese , there 's still a lot of land there , plus central and part of north america . 
  but i thought the british did it instead , they explored a lot in north america , india ( if it counts ) , australia and africa . 
  i 'm talking about total area explored , rather than the time it happened .
