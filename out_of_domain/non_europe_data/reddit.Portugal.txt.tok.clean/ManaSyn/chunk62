  those are n't even sphinxes . 
  what am i drinking this early in the morning ? 
  no , this is / r/funny . 
  no , wait , where am i ? 
  not particularly . 
  i mean , you have the whole ` merchants in the temple ' episode in the bible , but it was a jest on jews and money , rather than actual israel . 
  they would definitely be a faith oriented civ . 
  you are literally two hitlers . 
  my teacher is mostly the internet !, 
  sigh , there 's a video thumbnail with a doll 's face and some fingers in its mouth , at first glance i thought it was porn ... 
  batman wins . 
  keep what a secret ? 
  i must know !, 
  procurei no google . 
  as fontes valem o que valem . 
  sorry , i should have explained it . 
  a [ francesinha ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/francesinha ) ( portuguese for little french girl ) is a sandwich with several types of [ enchidos ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/embutido ) , the recipe differing from restaurant to restaurant ( which makes for an amazing gastronomical experience as you are invited to going for different places for different meals ) , like presunto ( wet-cured ham ) , chouri\u00e7o / lingui\u00e7a , paio , you name it . 
  add a nice big beef or pork steak and put it all in bread , covered in cheese that will then go to the oven ( hopefully ) to melt . 
  sometimes a fried egg is added to the top . 
  the sauce , which has a secret recipe , again depending on the place you go to , is based on tomato and alcohol , mostly beer , with some added white drinks because it 's alcohol . 
  you can also add tabasco or some spicy sauce . 
  it 's more or less of the size of a palm , again varying in places , and it is served with french fries and , usually , beer . 
  it 's not actually typical portuguese cuisine as it is very recent ( just short of fifty years old ) , but it 's a goddamn meal of the gods . 
  yes , jungles should have trading posts because if you go rationalism ( and you should ) , trading posts will give 1 science . 
  add two science from the jungle itself from university , and you 'll have two food , two gold ( up to four with commerce/golden age ) and three science in one tile . 
  edit : although , sure , 6 food there would rock !, 
  aprender is learning , saber is knowing . 
  aprendi a ler ( learned to read ) vs sempre soube que ia chover hoje ( i 've always knew it was going to rain today ) , for instance . 
  what is american food , then ? 
  honestly , i have no idea , the only thing that ever gets out here is junk food , apple pie and thanksgiving turkey . 
  holland is the name of the country in some languages , maybe op speaks oe of them . 
  this is n't true at all . 
  but maybe you are n't from the south . 
  be that as it may , i find it interesting . 
  i was aware there were [ lots of cities ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_cities_claimed_to_be_built_on_seven_hills ) who claimed to be built on seven hills , after rome , so maybe it is the same with stockholm , but with isles . 
  you 're paying to enjoy yourself with a nice meal , that 's what you 're paying . 
  resized it for you , hope it is sufficient :, 
  the witch night part ( or whatever it is ) belief may have started in europe , but disguises and candies probably started in the us . 
  halloween is only now being slowly introduced here , and it 's mostly for marketing reasons . 
  no it is n't . 
  ctrl + f : recent = 10 entries . 
  it is n't global , it 's being introduced gradually . 
  it 's only really heavy in the us . 
   methods, 
  \u00a7 around 166 000 adults aged 16-65 were surveyed in 24, 
  countries and sub-national regions : 22 oecd member, 
  countries -- australia , austria , belgium ( flanders ) , canada , the, 
  czech republic , denmark , estonia , finland , france , germany ,, 
  ireland , italy , japan , korea , the netherlands , norway , poland ,, 
  the slovak republic , spain , sweden , the united kingdom, 
  ( england and northern ireland ) , and the united states ; and two, 
  partner countries -- cyprus * and the russian federation . 
  i 'm portuguese and we have a very similar word , cabr\u00e3o . 
  it is exactly what you 're saying . 
  play as siam and get four universities for free !, 
  it 's 3 am and more alcohol will probably not help me , and i was thinking of quicker ways , but i guess there is no magic way . 
  thanks anyway !, 
  this is interesting , like birthing position ? 
  with the time i 've been here i 've probably gestated a big brown baby ... 
  i 'm on mobile , all i see is korean and blue boxes . 
  that only makes me confused !, 
  also , i am not entirely sure of this , but i think that if you get the policy after building amphitheaters and before researching education , you will not get free wats . 
  it 's probably something of a glitch in the first place anyway . 
  i can not test it right now . 
  a bit related , if you nuke a spaceship part on its way to the capital , will it die ? 
   ** the uk ** lacks a significant ** african american ** minority, 
  ... well , yeah , they do . 
  technical names aside , what does race have to do with weight ? 
  does top gear really get 380 million viewers per episode ? 
  i was aware it 's the most watched program in the world , but holy shit , that is a lot !, 
  after you do the appropriate research . 
  not sure if errors are on purpose or not ... 
  yo , portugal 's awesome , bitch !, 
  so he speaks spanish ? 
  he 's joking . 
  he was a god-king . 
  he never lifted anything except for the scepter , his slaves did . 
  why 'd he need bigger arms ? 
  i wonder , is this why blacksmiths ( and i guess metallurgical industries ) would heat up the metal , hammer it , cool it down , then heat it up again and repeat the process ? 
  i forgot the name of the process in english , and i 'm not even sure if that is how it is done , so apologies if this is n't clear . 
  edit : it 's called tempering , i believe . 
  wait , how did poseidon die in 200 bce ? 
  you did n't read the first comment in there , did you ? 
  it 's a monty python joke . 
  i do n't understand the judgmental part . 
  why are you judgmental ? 
  or do you mean that you just think a lot , because to me judgmental is someone who stereotypes people , although this may be something lost in translation , as english is n't my first language . 
  when i went to berlin , people were also standing around in the grass in front of the reichstag . 
  this was in early october too . 
  i guess germans love the sun . 
  who does n't !, 
  your dad then ? 
  why ? 
  i understand that concept , but i wonder how true it is . 
  you are considering the nuclear option , which might still not happen in a melted war scenario , and while the nuclear winter theory is very popular , is there any scientific data to it ? 
  i mean , the number of nukes is, 
  not enough to blast away either the us or russia , let alone the world , but i can see how the energy and , worse , the radioactive material released could be catastrophic , perhaps cause mass extinction , but wipe out everything ? 
  i doubt it . 
  that would hardly be ` the end of all civilisation ' but fine , i guess i 'm just being picky . 
  it 's called the tsar bomb , and no , it would n't ignite the atmosphere .
