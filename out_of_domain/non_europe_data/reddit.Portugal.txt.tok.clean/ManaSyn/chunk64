  definitely agree with your second part . 
  the man did his job . 
  sure it may not have been a dangerous one , but it was still a job . 
  in my opinion , the military is a necessary evil , but an evil that needs maintenance . 
  i consider a mechanic and all logistics behind it far more important than any courageous grunt , but both have their roles . 
  make my queen win ? 
  i love this challenge !, 
  do n't get me wrong , i also agree with the first part , military people deserve no special praise , it 's just their job . 
  you 're hitting on [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/maria_i_of_portugal_as_queen_by_an_unknown_artist.jpg ) [ sexy ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/queen_maria_i_of_portugal_with_regalia.jpg ) [ woman ] ( http://www.royaltyguide.nl/images-families/braganza/braganza2/1734%20maria-02.jpg ) . 
  there 's both the ` thank you for your service ' and the ` shut the fuck up about military ' circlejerks . 
  that 's not true , we evolved from assholes . 
  look at what they achieved !, 
  in some countries , army has the same colloquial meaning as military , or armed forces . 
  i 'm not american : is n't there quite heavy society pressure on young men to join the military and be heroes , let alone the financial benefices ? 
  i 'd say that 's being forced , just like black people in ghettos becoming criminals . 
  in the end , it 's their choice , but to say there 's no one forcing you , even if not pointing a gun , that 's a bit of a stretch . 
  i do n't know what is a joke when it comes to american patriotism/nationalism anymore on reddit , really . 
  remember i do n't live in the us , and while i do take with a grain of salt anything i read online , there 's just so much propaganda transpiring that i also take with a grain of salt that americans would be capable of a complete rational decision regarding that . 
  please do n't get me wrong : i 'm not calling your people stupid or incapable of taking decisions ; i 'm saying there seems to be a lot of influential pressure regarding the matter . 
  and if influence did n't matter , there would be no advertising or propaganda . 
  it does matter . 
  there are no good circlejerks . 
  i would buy this thing in a heartbeat if that was the actual ad . 
  igualmente . 
  i do agree . 
  i would have done something to work with feitorias and typical portuguese gunship diplomacy . 
  after all , this is how the empire in the indian ocean was established , by bombing cities until their leaders surrendered to the captain 's command . 
  for example , i would do a challenge involving declaring war on all city-states you encounter , and build and keep a feitoria in it , while gaining a scientific victory to be , you know , the first ones to explore , again . 
  to be fair , when i tried it once , those who did n't settle at first just afked till they gave me a free worker . 
  well , i 'm partial to maria 's themes , specially [ war ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9p4zcjyffu ) ( [ peace ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf_dybjwrvy ) ) , but both [ war ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14yhs0375ty ) and [ peace ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icthzncrzc8 ) for shaka are awesome . 
  i can tell from personal experience that as long as you were moving it was n't very hot , there 's a lot of air movement inside the cloak and you 'll actually stay relatively fresh ( it 's still summer ) . 
  but if you stand still , goddamn it is hot !, 
  i believe you would mean [ this ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_bwteye4_xji/tptp2knh_pi/aaaaaaaaacm/bvgefhc92gs/s1600/traje.jpg ) ? 
  this is from another town . 
  each town has its variation . 
  edit : [ another ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_nanjctcgas/tmdtjp9emii/aaaaaaaaata/fqb3c1imuks/s1600/page.jpg ) pic . 
  that 's a great video , i wonder if x-posting it to / r/videos or somewhere else would be a good idea . 
  where can i see every other expedition 's poster ? 
  til the modern age started in the second half of the last century . 
  down for anal ? 
  you seemed to have just finished the harbor , did you try going to the next turn ? 
  maybe not bricks , but what about good old concrete buildings ? 
  i know they 're expensive , but they are durable . 
  what 's wrong with it ? 
  arguing who are the fattest americans . 
  this is amazing . 
  which is the same in america really . 
  ( joking , do n't bomb me ), 
  there was one . 
  it probably died of overworking . 
  parece-me normal . 
  why 'd you turn canadian in the end ? 
  ah , terry pratchett . 
  that 's because there was no xbox back then . 
  so what 's black and gray ? 
   may scoop a few kitchen tiles out of a statue . 
  first time i ever heard that . 
  sounds funny . 
  brailleddit ? 
   the results show that commuting patterns in ivory coast , portugal and boston are remarkably similar . 
  most people commute between the hours of 8 and 10 in the morning and are home by about 8.30 pm . 
  and the further they travel , the earlier they leave . 
   stupid question : would you pronounce ` kkk ' like in brazil or capa-capa-capa ? 
  after so many years of english internet , i 'd say kay-kay-kay ... k is ( was ) not part of our alphabet . 
  i 'm surprised you did n't mention yourself in this nonsensical response !, 
  yes really . 
  doctor who 's . 
  that one only shows eleven ... 
  i do , but it 's not his birthday , it 's the show 's . 
  very fertile lands . 
  what is a simulcast ? 
  on mobile , not easy . 
  but thanks . 
  the cast they got for this short is crazy amazing . 
  it 's great so many people agreed to join . 
  if a random guy asks me anything whatsoever in the bathroom i 'll think he 's a freak . 
  is this really that confusing ? 
  people build settlements close to volcanoes because those are among the most fertile lands on earth . 
  it 's been plenty of centuries after those villagers were founded in the first place , but the principle still stands . 
  people live there and not in a non-volcanic land because it 's worth it . 
  just like there 's houses in many dangerous zones , like the st andreas fault or the tornado alley in the other side of the ocean . 
  thus , it is semantics . 
  warship and battleship are equivalent by now . 
  hey , i was thinking it seemed very close to the portuguese word * saudade * . 
  it seems [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hiraeth ) agrees . 
  so is air , the only difference is that there could be advection with air , none with vacuum . 
  i think you would if it was a big part of your history , like a civil war battle or the tomb of a president or so . 
  because the farmers need houses , that 's what i 'm saying . 
  over the course of centuries , though , one farm becomes a town . 
   but you do n't lead jack shit . 
  you do , that 's what the whole engage thing was about . 
  not really , but it 's still better than being the guy everyone is cheering . 
  odd . 
  i was having problems with paper in my hp printer yesterday , it appears you actually have to press a button in the printer when you work out the paper jam , rather than waiting for your computer to do anything . 
  maybe you should have tried that !, 
   there does n't seem to be anything here, 
  i think it 's german , it has the [ \u00df ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%9f ) right of 0 . 
  no , valkyrie , titan was a bigger ship they were going to rendevouz with but got destroyed . 
  so , 9:00 gmt , now everyone can do their own maths with their timezome . 
  the best part about this post is that we can use bicycles in europe because europe is small , whereas america is huge .
