  loved the video !, 
  great , now we have lost smoke monster walking around !, 
  what 's the start button on pc ? 
  that 's just one building , albeit the most famous one . 
  petra is an entire city . 
  no , that would be because there are no historical sites there . 
  not in a circlejerk , there are n't !, 
  is n't anderson rich , and is n't he shaming him on tv ? 
  do you really think that 'd work ? 
  why are people associating ` seen ' with actual visual phenomena happening ? 
  it may very well be just sound . 
  that everyone can ` see ' it does not necessarily mean everyone will have it in front of their eyes , but rather than everyone will acknowledge it . 
  i may be wrong as english is n't my first language , but associating ` seen ' with ` visual ' may incorrect . 
  ugh , i posted this in the wrong topic , sorry about that :,

  we do in my language , so fair enough , my bad . 
  yes , i have been answered in the other topic . 
  in my country we use see rather wildly , to see anything may very well mean to hear , to taste , to smell , no problem . 
  so sure , i get it if it does n't work that way in english . 
  portuguese . 
  close enough . 
  12 mil euros ?!? 
  why ? 
  i think one week of team work is one of the best things ever . 
  the american side ? 
  is n't it ru vs cn ? 
  all the ingredients for success in this subreddit !, 
  okay , this feels terribly awful to me . 
  i 'm not sure why , i guess it 's a cheesy way to win after a long battle where the others deserved as much a victory as you did . 
  yes , i 've seen that post too , but thanks anyway . 
  no idea how you found my post amidst the other ten thousand ( i thought i was the first , that 's why i posted it , was wrong , did n't get front page , etc ) . 
  to defeat opponents who fought just as hard as you did to win the match by not playing the game feels like cheating to me . 
  but i see this is not a popular opinion here . 
  6 in a row , that 's some bingo right there !, 
   ranjeblanjebleu, 
  never heard that term before . 
  someone would make a fortune recording non-dutch speakers saying that word . 
  go see the doctor ? 
  hah , next you 're going to explain how there were peters and james and good old english names like that in ancient palestine !, 
   by definition a 1.9 gpa is below average so that redditor you refer to is already aware of his/her shortcomings, 
  [ not really . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dunning%e2%80%93kruger_effect ), 
   the dunning -- kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which unskilled individuals suffer from illusory superiority , mistakenly rating their ability much higher than is accurate . 
  do they give workers ? 
  you can either say something like, 
   ` antes gostava de jogar videojogos ' , which translates to ' i enjoyed playing videogames in the past ', 
   ` costumava gostar de jogar videojogos ' , translating to ' i used to enjoy playing video games ' . 
  it does sounds fishy , works well without the enjoy , ` costumava jogar videojogos ' -  ' i used to play video games ' . 
  used to = costumar ( verbo ) . 
  / r/portugal, 
  it is n't weird per se , it 's the triple verb that is a bit fishy : costumar - gostar - jogar . 
  you do n't really say three verbs often . 
  think of it like , dunno , ' i like enjoying playing video games ' . 
  this is why i said that other way to translate is to use ` antes ' . 
  in your example , ` antes queria aprender muitas l\u00ednguas ' . 
  but you can say your way too , it 's just not usual . 
  also , is enjoying something actually an action ? 
  like , ' i enjoy playing videogames ' . 
  is the enjoying here an action ? 
  this is a genuine question for someone else who understands linguistics , but it also holds the same value for what nandemo said , ` gostar ' is as action as much as ` enjoy ' is . 
  i can talk about weather in a normal conversation !, 
  \u00c9 justo . 
  exactly , you can say three verbs , it 's just not common , it does n't feel right , but that 's it . 
  everytime you post something regarding your blog i always think it 's a question and start answering it until i actually click the damned link . 
  thing is , most of the times you are n't actually expecting to be ressed , and you 're clicking esc/whatever button for menu on consoles , or map , or something , and it just bugs out . 
  at first i thought the citadel 's warning voice was the echo from your wife speaking ... 
  that reminds me of [ this ] ( http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/july/undeadonraptoronsharkwithfrickinlaserbeams_small.jpg ) . 
  there will be fireworks by the river , not entirely sure where yet but there are usually some in bel\u00e9m , in terreiro do pa\u00e7o and in torre vasco da gama ( oriente ) . 
  and the northern border too , it seems . 
  that 's odd , one of the reasons portugal got its independence from the habsburg ( the austria ) in 1640 was because filipe iv , who was fighting the thirty years war at the time , also had his troops moved to catalonia who was also attempting [ independence ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_revolt ) . 
  high five , shareholder !, 
   heightism, 
  uh , yeah , you 're right , i just noticed everything in the image is the southern border . 
  that was not smart . 
  what musics were these ? 
  loved the first one . 
  ugh , i actually did and did n't see any link so brainfarted about it . 
  cheers !, 
  also , you made me think there were dolphins on paracel storm :p, 
  in the last point , why use stingers if iglas are more powerful ( first point ) ? 
  at least they have more range , i think . 
  although it looks like a triceratops . 
  team dino ? 
  well i can try yelling ' i like the new death animation ' next time i fuck just to prove you wrong . 
  now i just need a volunteer . 
  anyone ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ pls ^ ^ ^ ^ respond, 
  his giggle at the end was awesome !, 
  i do n't , what the fuck is going on here ? 
  well it took quite a while for someone to say it , but austria is n't english , it 's latin . 
  blame the romans !, 
  also , `` austral '' means south , which is where both australia and auster come from , as well . 
  what model pops up if you look at yourself in the portals ? 
  freeman or chell ? 
  so which duck dynasty are we talking in this post ? 
  that 's why you have sign language , you see ? 
  that was the joke .
