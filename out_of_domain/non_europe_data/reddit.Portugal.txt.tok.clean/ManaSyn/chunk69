  wait , you can build improvements inside other people 's borders ? 
  fuck that , best thing there is !, 
  apologies , it is fixed now . 
  to clarify , i started a game in the information era to be sure you all the luxury researches done ( information era is like 1000 % sure of it ) , and just spawned a gs using ige . 
  unless i 'm an idiot again , this should show that gp improvement do not in fact give luxury resources . 
  farto means saturated . 
  it can mean both an annoyed feeling ( i 'm tired of this ) and a rich/filled thing ( the harvest was good this year ) . 
  or you can take it as flatulence in english if you so desire . 
  i do n't get that pun :(, 
  [ that 's okay ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/theory_of_the_portuguese_discovery_of_australia ) . 
  no , the us did . 
  i do n't understand . 
  the map says very explicitly that these are the lands that did not have anyone living in it . 
  yes , there were people living in africa for a long , long time . 
  but show me one tiny bit of continental africa that is in anyway not colored gray in that map . 
  in fact , the map shows only isles . 
  so yes , this was land unknown by humans or , worst case scenario , land known by humans who died years before anyone else got there . 
  this is the only case where you 'd have a point , otherwise the map 's pretty accurate on actual human discoveries , european or not ( like , you know , the us , also portrayed ) . 
  do notice that the million isles of polynesia , which were discovered and inhabited long before europeans ` discovered ' it , are not shown . 
  uh , full vegetable soup is the best i can think of !, 
  a classic facepalm moment . 
  i guess that 's a lake and not a inland sea ? 
  i am a local . 
  i guess it is where doc brown went in his final time machine . 
  you will enjoy it , that i can say , 
  still , you should ask questions in / r/portugal , there are a lot of helpful people in there , and we all love to talk about how great our country can be for tourists !, 
  far fetched . 
  i 'm unlucky with spain , can never find a nw anywhere close by at the start . 
  must be my iberic rivalry or something . 
  are both these bad for you ? 
  i 'm just wondering if it 's really the colour 's fault or you 're just unable to recognize the earth if it is displayed as is usual to you ( [ white sea , black land ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mcorfda.png ) ) . 
  does n't matter what everyone says about settler , it 's fun to try silly things once in a while , so i tried a different civ , [ the celts ] ( http://i.imgur.com/l1l7wcf.png ) . 
  12 cities , 10 civs , 100 turns , culture victory . 
  with only two buildings ( mosques and pagodas ) , it 's a bit shitty to choose a pantheon belief with the celts so i ended up choosing +2 faith per quarry ( had like 5 quarries in my whole empire ) , as well as +100 g once each city gets converted ( much better than tithe for this ) . 
  i think i built something like 5 of my 11 settlers , bought the remaining 6 , everything else was used in faith and culture buildings . 
  i did finish piety asap and did build a missionary before enhancing , which i only did with the prophet from ending the piety tree . 
  i know it sounds silly but hey , settler !, 
  edit : just did a 85 turn win with the mayan . 
  uhm . 
  it kinda is upside down . 
  `` this is bullshit - you 're oversimplifying a complex situation to the point of no longer adding anything useful to the discussion . '', 
  friendly rivals , thank you very much . 
  like brothers . 
  me neither , where 's the history part ? 
  it 's not like it was ever a bloodthirsty relationship ... 
  in terms of civ , it goes down to spying and colonial skirmishes in the renaissance era , an annexation and eventual liberation in the modern era , and dof with ra ever since . 
  we may very well be the best documented case of brother nations in history . 
  mind actually breaking it down and tell me why ? 
  not that i agree or not , but i 'd like to know . 
  that last sentence ... god damn it , english !, 
  that warmongering roman empire , blame them for the eu crisis !, 
  let me put it this way :, 
  there is not a single meal gone by without bread . 
  that is forbidden . 
  [ bread ] ( http://c8.quickcachr.fotos.sapo.pt/i/bb704493e/6687849_ektdm.jpeg ) and [ wine ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/red_wine_glas.jpg/150px-red_wine_glas.jpg ) are the fundamentals of our country . 
  edit : okay , on a more serious note , yes , bread is a big part of everyone 's lives . 
  there are bakeries in every town , and there are even men who go around in their vans in the countryside with the only purpose of selling bread which , by the way , can last a few days . 
  also , nowadays it is not so usual for families to make their own breads , specially in the cities . 
  we have one famous baker , linked to a myth : brites de almeida , the aljubarrota baker , who supposedly killed seven spaniards who ran away from the celebrated [ battle of aljubarrota ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_aljubarrota ) . 
  we do n't really celebrate bakers , to be honest . 
  dwarves like it rough . 
  that 's what he said . 
  i do have a question , it 's probably too late :(, 
  why do you say ` she 's a keeper ' , if you 're the one who should keep her ? 
  should n't it be something like ` keep her ' ? 
  hahahaha, 
  mierda is spanish , it would be merda . 
  plus we do n't speak like that !, 
  this is a terrible , terrible joke , but it has puns in it which may be interesting for those willing to learn the language :, 
  i wonder how many learners will understand it at all . 
  carriers . 
  how is it in greek , though ? 
  is that a banana from madeira ? 
  the portuguese , that 's brasilian accent !, 
  the grammar is different and noticeable . 
  faz x-post no / r/mapporn e no / r/europe !, 
  i have n't been into the sc2 professional scene for months , but is n't eg a clan ? 
  how `` do '' he deny drinking red bull ? 
   holy roman empire : as rome , adopt christianity as your religion, 
  that 's not what the holy roman empire is . 
  which is rather odd because there is no city with that name . 
  it 's a small archipelago with two main isles , s\u00e3o tom\u00e9 , and pr\u00edncipe . 
  it is ? 
  til . 
  which one ? 
  the gui is facultative , it is only there to make things easier . 
  i do n't think it even had an os at all . 
  you had to create your programs in cards with holes , corresponding to values ( numerical and logical ) in binary , which would be read by the computer just as you do now trough your gui . 
  at the time , it was used for heavy mathematical calculations , such as physics and meteorology modeling . 
  it does n't really make any sense to be honest , hence why i never heard about it . 
  sure elvis was called king and he was loved . 
  but he was hardly the first one . 
  pok\u00e9mon . 
   what about countries like sweden and norway ? 
  they do n't fit ? 
   norway : too small , with oil and liberty in many areas . 
  sweden : no socialist , an example in liberalizations , reducing gov , few regulations , free labor market , a strong private sector , much investment . 
  how the fuck is yahoo so big . 
  seriously , who uses it still ? 
  +1 culture per turn , turn 33 , 18 culture ?
