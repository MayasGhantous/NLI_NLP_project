  i ca n't think of a better word to describe that site but glorious !, 
  just one variant of [ einstein 's hoax ] ( http://www.snopes.com/religion/einstein.asp ) - without einstein if i may add . 
  no , it should n't . 
  children should be educated on what religion is . 
  on which religions there are , how much evil and how much good they have done , why some people need it while others do n't . 
  rather than indocrination , education . 
  i 'm beggining to suspect the guys from [ c&h ] ( http://www.explosm.net/comics/2672/ ) read reddit !, 
  well , i can agree it should be partially controled , for the well-being of citizens , but not completly forbidden . 
  just like drugs !, 
  was about to say this , not dannish but from another european country ( one more religious , obviously ) , and there 's no debate at all over religion . 
  we just do n't care . 
  we debate other things . 
  money , culture , science , etc. 
  we can tell from some pixels and seeing a few shots in our time . 
  i 'm sorry , i 'm not familiar with this confirmation name thing - i 'm actually confirmed ( also forced ) but nobody has to pick a name over here . 
  what is it for , are you actually going to legally add something to your name , or is it just a sort-of christian nickname ? 
  we use a lot more than that , like size of hoses , pipes and other water infrastructures . 
   the mco mib has determined that the root cause for the loss of the mco spacecraft was the failure to use metric units in the coding of a ground software file , `` small forces , '' used in trajectory models . 
  specifically , thruster performance data in english units instead of metric units was used in the software application code titled sm_forces ( small forces ) . 
  the output from the sm_forces application code as required by a msop project software interface specification ( sis ) was to be in metric units of newtonseconds ( n-s ) . 
  instead , the data was reported in english units of pound-seconds ( lbf-s ) . 
  ( ... ) an erroneous trajectory was computed using this incorrect data . 
  edit : this has been posted before , had n't seen it . 
  these are [ lenticular clouds ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lenticular_cloud ) , if i 'm not mistaken . 
  as for why you do n't see them in germany , i ca n't tell you for sure . 
  i could speculate that the proximity of the north sea is the reason , seeing the latitude of germany and washington state are almost the same , but i 'd leave it to an expert to answer you for sure . 
  does n't have to be a real children though . 
  a doll works fine . 
  would n't work as well with a puppy puppet for these hobos . 
  i 'm sorry for asking this , but did the cult do anything to your close family after you left ? 
  is it still your family or they too have disowned you ? 
  ouch , i ca n't even imagine one of my siblings not helping me do anything i ask . 
  was she by chance a kid , or an actual adult ? 
  on a related note , do you think the cult leaders are watching your family closely in order to prevent more withdrawals or , again , they did it so the family does that on itself ? 
  i 'm curious because you do say you 're talking to them again , but that should be scaring those control freaks . 
  would you say you use your intellectual raising strictly on the scientific side and your spiritual side is all a matter of faith that you ca n't , or refuse to , intellectualize ? 
  edit : i do n't want to sound offensive , so maybe a better question would be , do you try to use your intellectual raising to explain your faith ? 
  sean connery . 
  it 's not so much as understanding the significances as it is to believing conspiracy theories without proof . 
  because you 're all aliens ? 
  since this is an imagination thread , i 'm portuguese , and we started the whole explore the world thing , so i 'd go back and supply my own country with a fully detailed world map with all the resource locations and stuff . 
  not that it 'd change a lot , our population was about one million at the time . 
  first things first , atheism is merely the lack of belief in gods . 
  it 's not a philosophy of life . 
  but the one most atheists subscribe to is humanism . 
  you know , the philosophy that says humans are perfectly capable of distinguishing good from evil on their own thus able to make moral decisions . 
  second ,, 
   the betterment of our species becomes completely subjective, 
  i 'm sorry , what ? 
  religion is what makes it subjective , subject to the moralities of ancient shepperds . 
  the problem with that is that most times people try to shove their beliefs into others . 
  i mean , it would be great if the ordinary john doe was allowed to believe whatever the heck he wants , but for as long as religion is linked with [ lower education ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religiosity_and_intelligence ) there will always be bigots who think they know better than others . 
  i guess you could say what most atheists try to fight is the anti-education atmosphere religion creates . 
  what you say makes sense , but that 's still a leviathan . 
  check the wiki for [ licensed images ] ( http://starcraft.wikia.com/wiki/category:sons_of_the_storm_licensed_images ) , about midway down . 
  here 's an upvote for being better than the troll . 
  does n't really bother me because i 'm aware that detail probably is roman propaganda . 
  i hail from lisbon , portugal , europe . 
  that list is just fucking scary . 
  eu descarto . 
  art in europe is fabulous !, 
  my hometown was the shit five centuries ago , as the main hub of european commerce . 
  now it is just known for shit . 
  who pays for all that ? 
  that 's what i call `` el cabron '' . 
  she should just move to europe . 
  that article would have been so much better if this was written by whitera himself :, 
   `` thanks to everyone who expressed his support this way . 
  it is very nice , that among all the known names , i have been chosen . 
  it is always nice to know that my surrounding field support me , i will struggle to improve continuously for you '', 
  this is just english too good !, 
  it sells . 
  the ten thousand different cults in america have always puzzled me . 
  it 's like reddit , everyone creates his own . 
   be alert and of sober mind . 
  your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour . 
  how is this supposed to help ? 
  if you care to read a bit , the sun being a greenish colour is due to [ wien 's displacement law ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wien%27s_displacement_law ) . 
  it happens . 
  and , like everything bible , the misquote was enough for a good laugh !, 
  `` when you see it ! '', 
  newly created troll account , go away . 
  it is naive to say all of sciencists , philosophers and artists worked because they wanted to touch god . 
  no , it is n't . 
  that 's what `` all '' means . 
  you should have said `` most '' if you wanted to mean `` most '' . 
  til there are donuts in churches ... you must be american !, 
  atheism is more expensive than theism because books and education are n't free !, 
  i do n't see how this refutes anything . 
  you are a left moderate social libertarian . 
  left : 6.05 , libertarian : 2.11, 
  i got lucky and only had to fight the imprisoned ii at the 7th fight . 
  that means i was able to get full hearts back by cutting grass and breaking pots/toes . 
  then again my 8th was that multi-armed robot , easiest boss ever . 
  in portuguese , `` home '' translates directly to `` lar '' ( based on the roman household gods [ lares ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lares ) ) ; the saying `` home , sweet home '' is equal to `` lar , doce lar '' . 
  `` house '' is `` casa '' . 
  just thought you 'd like to know , 
  really ? 
  did you share your story already ? 
  i tried searching for it on your site and found nothing , but i 'm afraid i wo n't go trough your reddit account because you 've got just so many posts and it 's lazy sunday !,
