  128 k $ , seriously ? 
  i just have to post this [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8szi_gj9q58 ) someone linked there , it 's just crazy . 
   hahaha !, 
  you will really like olympus has fallen ... i watched it in a theater full of marines and their family members . 
  it was pretty intense !, 
  i bet . 
  what do americans call timberlands ? 
  ca n't be srs . 
  we are n't comparing the quality of the health services . 
  obviously , there are shitty and there are good hospitals everywhere . 
  the point here is that if you live in a society , the thought of having to pay for your life is absurd , and your exclamation of being lucky for only having to pay only a few thousand dollars is rather weird . 
  if you 're lucky to pay that little , then one could infer that the normal price is on the hundred thousand range . 
  that 's just sweet . 
  really , indebting yourself for health ( or education ) is just a strange notion for most of the world . 
  co-autores . 
  i guess i enjoyed the pun in the title than in the text more . 
  the puny army . 
  an army that does puns . 
  holy see + vatican . 
  it 's okay , they ca n't make it successfully after about 50km outside of porto , for much of my own despair . 
  would this be it ? 
  everywhere , everything . 
  relevant username shenanigans ? 
  keith is probably op . 
  has to be . 
  [ what he 's saying ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pink_map ) . 
  like the hat , still dislike the clownish-grin :(, 
   catherine of braganza ( portuguese : catarina henriqueta de bragan\u00e7a ; 25 november 1638 -- 31 december 1705 ) was queen of england , scotland and ireland from 1662 to 1685 , as the wife of king charles ii . 
  yey now we can into buyings new car to our politicians !, 
  nope . 
  it 's been over a decade since i 've talked about the quinto imp\u00e9rio , but i thought it was started by padre ant\u00f3nio vieira which was way later than cam\u00f5es . 
  where does cam\u00f5es say anything about it ? 
  / r/circuloidiota, 
  created by lorheim a community for 2 months, 
  so you 're a shrink ? 
  or a priest . 
  problema ? 
  what , is n't saints row iv the one everyone mentions a purple dildo bat ? 
  and the main character is a potus ? 
  i really should try that game , should n't i ? 
  portuguese too . 
   but a locksmith working on the docks disagrees . 
  joaquim mendes dionisio , who is in his 50s , has seen his pay cut since portugal 's 78bn-euro bailout three years ago . 
   he thinks the government should be coming up with schemes to help hard-hit workers . 
   `` those rich people come here because they want the sun and the sand ... 
  it does n't benefit the workers at all . 
  because the money they bring in , it 's just for them . 
  it 's not for workers like me . '', 
   `` the people that are coming are investing in portugal . 
  the chinese love european brands . 
  they buy vineyards , pig farms . 
  all this helps portugal a lot . '', 
  he likes his cigars . 
   not all of that has come from property sales though , because foreign investors can also get a golden visa by investing a million euros in capital or creating 10 jobs in portugal . 
  judging from last decade 's actual foreign affairs , maybe they are . 
  okay , but why does it matter ? 
  maybe i 'm just being dumb and am looking for a joke where there is none : /, 
  edit : woops , accidentally deleted the first post . 
  i asked why ohio matters , in it . 
  depends on the heating system . 
  cool name . 
  til about venice going full city-state . 
  moors were n't arabs , but i guess i 'm being pedantic .

  this is really weird . 
  in my country , portugal , asian people ( 99 % chinese ) ca n't say r and will pronounce them as l . it is the complete opposite of what i see in reddit . 
  pretty sure it 's cheaper to die , anywhere . 
  for you , at least . 
  not in portugal . 
  once removed , what ? 
  since you did n't say , which month are you coming in ? 
  it makes quite the difference if you 're coming in sunny summer . 
  do 3 turns in a diferent starting era , move settlers , settle three cities , win . 
  ai will only have settled once . 
  works with any civ . 
  that 's a really weird way to say it , for an esl , but i would n't know how to say it anyway . 
  thanks . 
  maybe i 'm seeing things , but the look on russia that shows it 's closing it eyes and farting strongly does n't have the same effect in the usa , where it looks like it 's looking up and closing its mouth to avoid belching so everything goes to europe . 
  thank you for not wasting anything , america . 
  i 'm sorry , that site keeps tingling my anti-flash extensions , here 's an [ youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqkzsd2vstq ) mirror . 
  i love the guy who arrives last and still tries to beat him . 
  posted elsewhere , here 's a [ youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqkzsd2vstq ) mirror for anyone like me who ca n't get that site to play it .

  the ship in question is called the vera cruz ( archaic portuguese for true cross ) , and it was built for the five century celebration of the discovery of brazil . 
  it can be visited in lisbon , where this picture was taken , as a museum for the portuguese golden age . 
  it can also be used to sail around by volunteers , in the ways of the time . 
  some info :, 
  yeah , i do n't know what those are , but those shirts are bigger than that woman , what the hell ? 
  why third crusade ? 
  were n't they all for this purpose ? 
  more confused at the random assyrian african colony . 
  build a city here and spread judaism to it . 
  you 'd then have the star of david copper field .
