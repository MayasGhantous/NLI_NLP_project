  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ terrible . 
  would have been nice if you had showed the votes ... 
  why did you underline kathmandu ? 
   `` quantas l\u00ednguas falas fluentemente ? '', 
   thingol rules in mirkwood as the elven-king , and he would n't probably listen anyway . 
  still , i think it 's pushing it ... 
  the americans have a fuckton of resources and land . 
  they would last a lot more than half a decade , but not with their current level of consumerism and wasteful culture . 
  it would require a total society change , but i think they could manage it . 
  although , okay , they 'd probably implode in civil war before that . 
  it just does n't work because of whatever format he uses , the link becomes unclickable ... 
  acaba com caf\u00e9 . 
  edit :, 
  let me guess , it was the second between him turning around and showing the rest of the body ? 
  you tried , buddy , you tried ... 
  what i of missing !, 
  ok so i cubed it . 
  that did n't help . 
  can not understand jews . 
  this is what i get ( not moving ) :, 
  ... serves me right for forgetting parenthesis ... 
  on the other hand , 0.28 ^ 2/3 = 0.428 = 42.8 % , which makes sense !, 
  ah jews , always so smart . 
  this makes no sense , the cost of medical supplies is the same worldwide , the way the average people pay for it is what differs . 
  it does n't matter for anything if a medicine was discovered in the us , in europe or made in china . 
  i mean , if anything , since most of it comes from the us , it would be us companies profiting the most , thus contributing more to taxes and therefore to public healthcare . 
  i really do n't see how the us having better health research is a problem ( or a benefit ) for free healthcare . 
  for some americans , liberal = red evil commie . 
  o que \u00e9 o sector oficial , o p\u00fablico ? 
  i 'd say that would be gold . 
  how can you see the upvotes he expected before his post reaches 1h of age ? 
  it will also google highlighted text . 
  lebanon is a country , not a city ... 
  right , forgot about the countless namesake cities in america . 
  fair enough !, 
  americans are n't foreigner , the ukrainians in the class were the foreigners . 
  i thought arda was a globe , not flat . 
  am i wrong ? 
  not many nations have a pledge of allegiance . 
  it is generally regarded as a sign of nationalism . 
  how is it useful , specifically ? 
  maybe so , but op is still technically correct : half-life ^ 3 is getting closer . 
  i have n't , and it 's a mythical place to me like shangri-la or something of the sort . 
  they are everywhere ... 
  in the us .

  they could n't . 
  fingolfin tried , but lost . 
  the thing is , he put up a fight because morgoth was a really big coward and saw any minor injury ( which a very fast and strong king of the elves was able to do ) as the end of the world . 
  not many beings could take on morgoth . 
  if i recall correctly , only tulkas was able to at the height of melkor 's power , but then fear and hate got the better of him and he turned into the much weaker morgoth . 
  which was still bloody strong . 
  they are n't imperial ? 
  both were created during british imperial times ( maybe even before ) and are rather empirical like most imperial units . 
  there 's a non-automatic toll system too , no worries . 
  as for not paying to go to sintra , there are roads that take a little bit more time but do not require toll payment . 
  i think [ google ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/eqpk4 ) helps you with that ( click the different suggested routes ) . 
  here 's the route for [ f\u00e1tima ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/d5fss ) . 
  keep in mind these are google maps routes , there may be other routes in smaller roads where you wo n't pay tolls . 
  but at the price of gas here , it might just not be worth it . 
  because liberia was an american colony . 
  the jokes in that thread are exactly the same you see all over reddit , are n't they ? 
  ca n't tell if you say european because it 's not super large . 
  but i 'll agree that it is weird . 
  i 'd wager percentage relative to total work force , but a scale would have been great , yes . 
  metropolitan area ! = city , no ? 
  edit : nevermind , read below that map is about metro area . 
  alarmist in regards to the internet specifically or in regards to loss of personal freedom ? 
  because imprisonment for personal speech is still loss of personal freedom , no matter the medium . 
  why is your leader 's name not yaroslav as mentioned in your steam community link ? 
  would that be vladimir putin i ? 
  was a joke . 
  still , the link you posted does not have vladmir i as leader of ukraine , i suppose you changed it yourself . 
  citation needed . 
  okay . 
  what 's that got to do with my question ? 
  / r/satire *, 
  is n't that medieval rather than renaissance ? 
  is not in the eu . 
  it 's a bot . 
  i guess you 're right : if we take the average human being , chances are he does n't give a shit about the us and they do in there . 
  | nothing | = nothing , you know ? 
  is n't that a bit anecdotal ? 
  he 's wrong anyway , coal is still responsible for about half of the world 's electricity production . 
  there is no reasoning for xd . 
  it 's just dumb . 
  cultura portuguesa !, 
  that is fair enough , but i 'm willing to bet there are far more people in the world who know who pel\u00e9 is but have never heard of reagan . 
  length , width and height rather than diameter is indeed a rather strange way to address the size of a sphere . 
  i thought that did n't matter anymore . 
  we do n't have jokes about poles in portugal . 
  we also do n't have jokes about lawyers . 
  we fucking hate those . 
  i thought about making a portugal one , but there really is no point . 
  [ productivity , visualized by gdp per hour worked ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vyusqpe.jpg ) . 
  amazon.uk used to ship freely for a lot of eu countries . 
  not anymore , the bastards !, 
  quando chegar a casa linko a source . 
  is any of those uses even correct ?
