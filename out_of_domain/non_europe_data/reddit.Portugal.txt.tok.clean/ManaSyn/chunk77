  there was a colonial war , sure , but the fucking up of the country after we left was hardly our fault . 
  wonderful europe . 
  also , you forgot the mausoleum of halicarnassus . 
  or at least it 's hard to see . 
  it 's an ent city . 
  how is this unpopular ?

  the different languages thing was a nice touch . 
  close this tab . 
  letterman is another name for mailman . 
  they were speaking arab ( cairo ) , english ( new york ) , french ( paris ) and portuguese ( rio de janeiro ) . 
  the square in the iberian peninsula is for portugal , which only has the border with spain . 
  this trending option does n't show from / r/all , it shows from the front page . 
  why is there a random unicorn in there ? 
  those are some nice story telling skills . 
  thank you for your service . 
  thanks reddit .

  what is the meaning behind flair colours ? 
   the number of people killed as a result of his regime is estimated by international observers and human rights groups to range from 100,000 [ 1 ] to 500,000 . 
   villages were required to meet quotas on rubber collections , and individuals ' hands were cut off if they did not meet the requirements . 
  his regime was responsible for the death of an estimated 2 to 15 million congolese . 
  o que \u00e9 ?

  typical george , even if you already know you 'll be getting joy out of this episode he 'll still manage to kill it a few times . 
  less military people , perhaps . 
  which does n't make it any close to a good excuse for that horror . 
  i still do n't get why this is in / r/funny . 
  it 's okay , i have the total opposite anedoctical evidence : as a non-american , i can spell massachusetts , wyoming , mississippi , tennessee , idaho , utah , etc , no problem , but i can seldom place them 100 % correctly . 
  although , i 'm not sure what the us matters for an european in that particular matter . 
  am i the only one who think the houses from the king 's landing shot look way too modern ? 
  they look like a normal mediterranean city of today ( which it is , i guess ) . 
  it is easier for me to spell states than it is to spell some english words . 
  as i said , not american . 
  the translation of `` anecdotal '' to portuguese is `` aned\u00f3tico '' . 
  you can see where my error comes from . 
  the states , however , are the same , for the most part . 
  it was risky to play on this map , you could have had few city-states with coastal tiles for that feitoria . 
  still , well done , and thanks for showing portugal can be a good civ indeed . 
  also , for playing my favourite victory type , portugal can into first to explore again !, 
  it 's kilimanjaro , not fuji . 
  yes , it 's an overused reddit joke . 
  this is shitpost , you forgot to say allahu akbar . 
  pensava que era preciso esperar dez minutos entre posts ... 
  it 'll move when you settle right next to it . 
  hey , this is actually a great idea for a bot . 
  i do n't think you are one , but someone ougtha do it !, 
  maybe one that would also add historical context from submissions with a date in it . 
  and a full-out g.r.r. 
  martin-like description of the peasant and noble food alike at the time . 
  water is pretty dense , that mountain range should be somewhere in the millions of tonnes . 
  are you implying europe is diverse and there 's many ways to look at it ?!, 
  nonsense !, 
  namely , the third picture . 
  too many . 
  in terms of benefits for yourself , dofing sweden grants you +10 % in gp generation , and trading with morocco gives you +2 gpt . 
  i misunderstood what you meant with trading . 
  to be fair , overused reddit joke is sort of a pleonasm anyway . 
  [ but , that ] ( http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/2mfct16woxs/maxresdefault.jpg ) ... 
  most of the times they do n't even know what the word fact means . 
  `` that 's a fact '' is thrown away so often . 
  it 's almost as bad as `` i 'm sick and tired '' or `` thank you for your service '' . 
  it is a rather silly sentence on itself , to be honest , but i meant that it is thrown away really often . 
  a duck !, 
  i 'm not actually sure if i 'm allowed to post this here , as i did n't actually travel anywhere , but i supposed it could interest most subscribers from this subreddit . 
  the entrance is located in [ here ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/sa2gc ) ( you can see it covered just to the right of the bike ) . 
  as for when they open , i wish i could tell you , but i do n't know and i ca n't find any schedule for them right now . 
  last two years it was open in september ( as it makes sense , because by the end of summer is when the water levels are at the lowest ) , but this year they opened it in april due to the international day on monuments and sites , on the 18th . 
  hopefully they 'll start opening twice a year , but that has n't been the norm . 
  it usually is in september due to lower water levels , but this year they also opened in april as i explained above . 
  on the 13 ^ th of june we celebrate lisbon 's patron saint , st. ant\u00f3nio , and the [ old neighbourhoods ] ( http://maimagazine.net/2/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/santospopulares.jpg ) all get [ decorated ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gsrlfroax_i/t9zagzxyiyi/aaaaaaaaad0/fldd0x2kwp0/s1600/alfama1.jpg ) , and much wine , beer , bread and absolutely gorgeous and delicious [ sardines ] ( http://www.setemalas.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/captura-de-tela-2012-05-29-%c3%a0s-10.36.29.png ) are had . 
  we even have cute [ parades ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vgejpt-4rre/tfsvono9xxi/aaaaaaaaahk/v78gac2zowo/s1600/marcha_benfica.jpg ) with prizes for the best neighbourhood of the year !, 
  if you do come to lisbon , i ca n't recommend the week around june 13 ^ th enough . 
  definitely the best week . 
  but if you can only make it in july , you 'll have a good time as well !, 
  capital is the capital city . 
  i love sheep on a desert hill close to the river . 
  by the end of the game they grand +4 [ ] ( / food ) and +5 [ ] ( / production ) . 
  but hell , any hill close to water makes for an excelent tile . 
  mui is an old form of muito . 
  `` leal '' means `` loyal '' . 
  leal means loyal , it does n't mean truthful . 
   isabella i ( spanish : isabel i , ** old spanish : ysabel i ** ; 22 april 1451 -- 26 november 1504 ) , also known as isabella the catholic , was queen of castile and le\u00f3n ( crown of castile ) .

  censos 2011 . 
  but dude , because 0 fahrenheit means quite cold and 100 f means quite hot , you can know tell your friends it feels 67 % too hot , how amazing is that ?!, 
  it 's an american-filled site , if you have never seen imperial defended here , and the retarded `` convenient '' arguments , then you have n't been paying attention . 
  it 's not easier , you 're just used to it . 
  metres , kilos , litres , celsius , they are all as intuitive to me as imperial is to you . 
  and the math is far easier . 
  and that 's the reason why metric is better . 
  i do n't actually care what people use in their normal life , but saying imperial is as good or better than metric is just fooling yourself . 
  confirmas ? 
  what i 'll never understand is why the why in the thumbnail , in the front , is different than the one in the image , in the back . 
  apologies for the delay , i was out for easter .
