  they do , they just ca n't do it easily . 
  how common is it ? 
  hate is such a strong word , i hate seeing it used so liberally . 
  notice the lack of answers ? 
  this is because portuguese men have no idea what our women want , either . 
  anyway , i 'll be sure to follow this thread , perhaps someone somewhere got it !, 
  why is there a building in the very bottom of the pic ? 
  some luxury ? 
   guys just do n't know the meaning of courtship, 
  so what is it for a woman , then ? 
  i 'd just like to emphatize van_zeller 's bolding of ** people ** . 
  i agree with him in everything he says in this post , but i 'd also like to add that the amount of closeness and distrust of outsiders varies with region . 
  i fucking love portuguese women for all of their virtues and some of their bad issues , i think the precautions they take are good , but approaching one without common grounds is unreasonably hard . 
  and for me , it 's in may 4th . 
  [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mother's_day ) 's the dates to avoid confusion . 
   estados unidos, 
  ca n't tell if you 're serious ... 
  it is the internet after all . 
  but if you are , why would anyone need double yolk eggs ? 
   tip # 3 : know what things sell for !, 
  luxuries sell for 240 gold ( or 7 gpt w/o dof ) , strategic for 45 each . 
  if you are being underpayed , the other civ does n't like you or does n't need the resource . 
  you can be a super-efficient and sell strategics for 2 gpt each , whereas selling 2 or 4 at once will only yield 3 and 6 gpt respectively ( sell individually is 50 % more ! ), 
  those values ( the absolute ones at least ) are for standard . 
  what are the values for other speeds ? 
  is that not fat to you ? 
  same thing . 
  what exactly is comfort food ? 
  i would say this too . 
  it 's a simple thing that has so much effect . 
  it 's a start , only , but a good start . 
  i see . 
  bit of a foreign concept as every time i have a meal i try to make it comfortable , but i can definitely understand what you mean , there are foods that i care more than others . 
  a nice hot bowl of soup is one . 
  i ca n't see most of those pictures . 
  they wo n't load . 
  did you go to the galaxy map , and tried landing in the citadel again ? 
  i should say i still have no idea why portugal is a towel . 
  it is just reddit . 
  i assure you most people in the world care as much about america as you do about them . 
  this might be interesting for you :, 
  i think it 's a problem with the site , really . 
  if i go trough the site ( full gallery link ) , for zaeed 's link , i get to [ this ] ( http://postimg.org/image/891mm3ij9/ ) page which shows the image no problem . 
  if , however , i click the image there ( or the images here on reddit ) , i get redirected to the [ full size image ] ( http://postimg.org/image/891mm3ij9/full/ ) which wo n't load . 
  tl ; dr : use the full gallery link provided by op . 
  op is n't asking about unusual , he 's asking about unique . 
  it 's not quite the same thing . 
  de certeza que podes pedir aos mods do / r/europe que te mostrem o codigo do flair deles . 
  \u00c9 isto e o fad absurdo do pok\u00e9mon . 
  hah , i love that the hanar 's leader is javik !, 
  i do n't want upvotes . 
  it 's *, 
  being able to choose what you care about . 
  in what , cellphones ? 
  is n't windows still the widest used os in the world , ie , skynet material ? 
  wait , you can rescind open borders ? 
  only by declaring war , yes ? 
  how would you say it in arabic ? 
  we have the b sound for it in portuguese . 
  in fact , the [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alhambra ) article about it shows a b in the arabic phonetic . 
  he made a throwaway just to post this , i doubt you 'll be seeing that picture . 
  you have been answered , but i should add , just because you mentioned it , that the [ reaper destroyers ] ( http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120729060651/masseffect/images/b/b5/priority_rannoch_-_el_reaper.png ) are the ones that open up to fire , not the sovereign-class reapers like the one you posted . 
  not the middle leg , but in both sides of the middle leg . 
  teehee , your culture is 1337 . 
  that 's the translation into latin alphabet , no ? 
  i meant the word rigth after that , which shows the phonetic word , ie , how the word is pronounced in arabic using ( afaik ) american english sounds . 
  maybe it is a matter of accent , even in arabic ? 
  it looks like someone painted his cap over in the beginning ... 
  why not ? 
   j\u00e1 resolvi o meu problema ( preferences , display options , allow subreddits to show me custom styles --  off ), 
  eis uma compara\u00e7\u00e3o simples entre ambos os layouts , com chrome a 1920x1080 , no chrome , windows 8 . 
  para isso j\u00e1 me basta o telejornal ... e que tal um esquema de cores como azul e branco ( tipo [ isto ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uuryhk1mv04/uzqcseqfkyi/aaaaaaaajm8/zy8jygf1q8e/s1600/portugal_away_turn_prideht_ ( v1 \\ ) _ hfr1_large . jpg ) ) , ou as cores republicanas ? 
  cabem menos links no teu layout . 
  se precisares de testes em windows , avisa . 
  edit :, 
  vergonha is shame in portuguese , letter by letter , too !, 
  i did n't know that . 
  my sister 's name is ana . 
  this makes me sad :(, 
  this is so old it 's printed . 
  curious , why 'd you change the name of the city to castille ?

  outer space . 
  actually , she is . 
  check the [ description ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrhd8jpn7vo ) . 
  there are something like 40 midnights in the world . 
  it 's december , not january , for december 1 ^ st , the restoration day ( the end of the iberian union ) , but yes , national day is in june , not december . 
  that 's being shy . 
  you care about what others think of you , or how you will feel afterwards . 
  if you were outgoing ( i think this is the english antonym for shy ? 
  ) , what others think about you does n't matter , so you 'd just speak . 
  in fact , you 're probably outgoing about things you 're comfortable with . 
  if you enjoy videogames , for example , you 'll be speaking your heart out about them , and even if you say something stupid , you and the people you 're talking with will probably laugh it out and you wo n't care . 
  likewise , you 're shy about things you 're not comfortable with . 
  say something stupid about a topic you 're unfamiliar with , and if people notice it you might feel terrible about it . 
  to finish , and going with ops topic , not having something to say is neither shyness or the opposite . 
  you just really have nothing to say . 
  if it is consistent , it 's probably because you 're either an introvert or you 're just ignorant about most things .
