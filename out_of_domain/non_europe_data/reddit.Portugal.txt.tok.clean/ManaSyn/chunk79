  what does venice have to do with it ? 
  i thought being a fucking cunt in australia was a good thing . 
  just get science for better weapons . 
  actually it makes sense , they survived for so long because they were stealthy . 
  sintra *, 
  e o tempo . 
  i do n't understand . 
  it 's not like the dutch are a terrible civ . 
  besides , their ui represents their ingenuity ( while giving them gold !, 
  ) , their uu represents their naval power , and their ua is quite nice , getting gold while staying happy .

  tectonics in two words . 
  maybe venice bought enough city-states with your religion that its their primary religion . 
  and i always pick buddhism because it 's the first damn icon , how 's that for bias ? 
  that ` is ' ruins the russian . 
  he 's saying he lives in america , not that he 's american . 
   lois standing ovation, 
  who the fuck is lois ? 
  edit : gotcha , family guy . 
  google did n't show that . 
  \u00c9 pena . 
  what if he works in the school library ? 
  you did n't have to recolour it !, 
  the spanish inquisition was indeed not to be expected . 
  what rankings ? 
  til there 's rankings then . 
  well done !, 
  `` i always wear a kilt , because i 'm celtic , i 'm french and i was born in brittany . '', 
  i can let a black man call himself celtic , but what does being french have to do with a kilt ? 
  anyway , perdoem-me a paintice horrivel , mas era algo deste g\u00e9nero que falava .

  shoshone , 1 turn time victory , settle , end turn , win . 
  terra . 
  it has the same meaning , but it can also mean much more , soil , dirt , land , ground , etc. 
  simple fix : start with 3 turn time victory on a later era . 
  you will start with 3 settlers , just move them and settle asap , the ai will only have settled once . 
  and it works with any civ !, 
  this is n't even fun ... 
  but a fact is 100 % not made up , by definition . 
  hey , he 's being generic , he 's not talking about actual * homo sapiens sapiens * . 
  for a moment i thought you were captain obvious . 
  thanks for clearing it up .

  i am most glad to please .

  the lando of lys . 
  that is awesome . 
  something tells me the views on that video tripled in the last hour . 
  from an outside view , i would definitely say the us government is doing well enough about the environment , except for control of the corporations that fuck it up entirely for profit . 
  do kids call women foxes these days ? 
  plus , the title does say `` old student '' . 
  maybe it was n't a kid !, 
  [ alfama ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alfama ) is the oldest standing neighbourhood in lisbon , over a thousand years old , and as any medieval place , it 's an absolute chaos of a place , making it one of the most beautiful places of lisbon . 
  despite being born in lisbon and living here almost all my life , i never actually visited in detail , because it 's easy to get lost . 
  so i joined a toured visit around the places . 
  [ this ] ( https://mapsengine.google.com/map/edit?mid=zr5vcfepx5hi.kwhsdeegpfds ) is the path we took , with the location of photos . 
  i felt i should share with this subreddit , even if i 'm being a tourist in my own home . 
  also , i 'm a newbie photographer , so if you have a trained eye , i apologise if it hurts eventually !,

  why did james cook change his name to great admiral by the end of the war ? 
  portugal . 
  despite our strange choice of a leader , i actually like how we are portrayed , a gold-making trading , early exploration civ , with big emphasis on diplomacy . 
  seriously , though , i wish we had a less bitch of a leader . 
  makes us look posh and awful when we are not . 
  that 's the english !, 
  [ manuel i ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manuel_i_of_portugal ) . 
  he was the father of civ iv 's portuguese leader , john iii . 
  it was in his reign that vasco da gama reached india by sea , opening a whole new path of trade previously dominated by the arabs , and his successful policies of gunboat diplomacy in the indian ocean realms that started portugal 's golden age . 
  he even had a type of architecture developed in that era named after him , of which the [ jer\u00f3nimos monastery ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jer%c3%b3nimos_monastery ) in lisbon is the prime example . 
  pretty much every civ has a golden age leader . 
  we get the one who ran away . 
  he 's also my namesake , so there 's that . 
  another choice would have been the first king , [ afonso i ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/afonso_i_of_portugal ) . 
  he too has an interesting history . 
  it 's bothering me that his position changed from # 5 to # 6 !, 
  nice name for a non-portuguese . 
  you 're right , i was in the metro , on my phone . 
  thanks , though !, 
  still , that mod is n't quite right what i was asking , [ this ] ( http://www.picknmixmods.com/mods/facba1b7-c00a-4698-86da-157e119dfff1/mod.html ) is ( whatever this website is ) . 
  lu\u00eds really is n't a popular portuguese name at all . 
  at least not here , in portugal . 
  you also have the [ portuguese grandmother ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qz0r_calvw&amp;list=rd4qz0r_calvw#t=1 ) . 
  i 'm from portugal myself and can barely understand her . 
  as a portuguese manuel who loves [ bifanas ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nvn9u4xnel8/txmyqfpnrgi/aaaaaaaaaoc/qjhh7pl0pu8/s1600/bifana.png ) and beer , can confirm .

  no , really , what do you want to know ? 
  it 's not at all surprising . 
  drinking wine/beer for lunch and dinner is the norm around here , especially the older folk . 
  they made one about neil armstrong ? 
   the united states has an unemployment rate of 9.30 % while portugal has 9.20 %, 
  if you visited lisbon ten days earlier you 'd have a city-wide folk party . 
  it 's not even 7am , that 's how i read it at first , too ...

  i felt it was more relevant .
