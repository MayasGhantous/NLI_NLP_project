  of course . 
  i was n't expecting a full story , but i suppose from your resume you were a cultural believer ( ie , did it all your life ) that eventually got disappointed with religion , to put it very simple . 
  if you do ever find that link put it in your blog , it could be an interesting story !, 
   if you 're a christian and do n't believe mohammad was a prophet there is n't a word for being a non believer, 
  there is an word for that , infidel !, 
  thank you for that . 
  the nerd in me is trying to identy which game she 's from . 
  i 'm aware of the immense cultural diversity in the world but she just looks too fantastic !, 
  i can only imagine your dog acting like [ this ] ( http://i49.tinypic.com/23gzei1.gif ) !, 
  thank you for testing it out . 
  that answers my questions !, 
  oh , i always thought you people were using map editor or asking a friend to play with you . 
  that could prove useful , thanks again !, 
  i 'm sorry , [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uf5ns18rvbe ) was the best i could find , it seems even the camera died laughing . 
  this is one of those situations that every dog owner goes ` oh you bastard , poor dog ... shit , i got ta try this ' , really . 
  well , i did .

  conclusion : do n't mess with america . 
  you know , that 's the same about americans . 
  america is the shit yo . 
  i 'm not swedish and have no idea if you 're american , but that 's just whining , man . 
  it means people should be helped rather than fighting for themselves . 
  the horror !, 
  well , they can both be quite obnoxious about their nationalism , sure , but same can be said for about every nation in the world . 
  i guess the reason we hear so much about sweden is that they are in fact the paragon of an atheist country . 
  or , well , the whole scandinavia is , which is not the same , i 'll give you that . 
  where do you think religion actually comes from ? 
  the worse conditions you live in , the more prone to inventing and believing in bullshit you are . 
  this is no coincidence . 
  well , this beats those 2 second old posts . 
  so he 's saying ordinary men are stupid . 
  i still ca n't believe some people ( men and women ) see women as inferior . 
  can someone translate that for me , please ? 
  my esl/common sense is kicking in . 
  bring forth the apocalypse !, 
  i 'd wager the us will turn into a full scale empire 500 years before that . 
  something like what happened with rome . 
  edit : uh , 500 years before usa 's demise , that is , not 500 years before 2276 . 
  because nothing divine talked to him . 
  for the lazy : http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/p2wcc/please_describe_your_position_on_the_existence_of/, 
  my personal conclusion : we give jesus the middle finger . 
  well , do they get any tax benefits from this ? 
  if not , i do n't give a fuck . 
  it 's a better ideology to actually choose not to help people , right ? 
  edit :, 
  to clarify : you find it better to be forced to have to fend for yourself , because that 's what happens to most people in a fully capitalist system , than to be forced to help others . 
  the difference being that in the first it is due to circumstances , the second is due to law and government , which only purpose is indeed to help people be safe . 
  what kind of morality and ideology is this ? 
  i respect that . 
  i merely pointed a simple reason for socialism , and as sort of a joke , just like seriousblack 's post . 
  nice try , man-pretending-to-post-as-a-woman-depicting-her-husband-as-a-helpful-wish-washer-man !, 
  trolling / r/atheism , you mean ? 
  it had just too many details ; i had to google this and ... 
  i. . . actually had no idea about it . 
  is [ this ] ( http://socyberty.com/history/how-pope-clement-viii-had-a-significant-influence-on-the-history-of-coffee/ ) for real ? 
  [ prime mover alias first cause argument , in the faq ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/faq#firstcauseargument ), 
  nothing beats a key west winter except for an atlantic sunset . 
  you keep that in mind , american . 
  i did n't . 
  i did gloss over where the fuck key west is though . 
  you got me there !, 
  edit : second link is forbidden , can not see . 
  shame , would love to . 
  [ here 's one in the middle of the atlantic ] ( http://imgur.com/sajoo ) my brother took , posted it on [ / r/skyporn ] ( / r/skyporn ) few weeks ago . 
  which is really the only time i actually count the exact number of units i have . 
  and do n't help , it seems . 
  i see . 
  so it is acceptable to be forced not to cause suffering to others , but it is n't to be forced to relieve others of suffering . 
  how are these any different ? 
  indeed , it seems to be a matter of definition . 
  i live in a socialist country , and i do not consider to be forced to do anything . 
  sure , i have to pay , but i also get benefits , free health care , cheap education , etc. 
  to imply you 're forced on gunpoint ( ie , to be kidnapped or murdered ) to help others seems a bunch of propagandistic bullcrap . 
  i do n't actually go out of my way to help old ladies cross the street because there 's a policeman pointing a gun at me . 
  heck , they 're not even allowed to have guns !, 
  so , i do n't understand you guys point . 
  maybe you should explain to me what exactly you mean with `` forced '' , and why do you speak like socialist countries do n't have freedom of choice . 
  we do , we can also use off-shore accounts . 
  here 's good conspiracy logic :, 
  us vs iran , therefore world war iii, 
   if you successfully resist arrest they may very well kill you, 
  you 're either not serious or completly uninformed about , well , everything outside the us . 
  furthermore , your argument is completly unvalid , as you too pay taxes , and are indeed forced to it . 
  surely you also do n't `` consent on having your money taken '' lightly . 
  the difference is that while your money is used to maintain national infrastructures and make the rich richer with financial aid , my money is also used to maintain national infrastructures and to make the poor poorer . 
  sure , making the rich richer means more investiment , but that 's forgetting the present . 
  since you asked , [ this ] ( http://www.e-financas.gov.pt/de/pubdiv/de-devedores.html ) is basically what happens if you stop paying taxes . 
  since you probably do n't know portuguese , it 's basically a site that automatically puts debtors names into the public . 
  you know , for public shame . 
  it 's a bit more complicated than that but unless you actually defraud the state by declaring to have less than you actually have , you wo n't be prosecuted . 
  i think that when you die , the state gets your stuff , while in the mean time leaving some stuff to make sure your heirs do n't starve to death and maintain a good level of dignity , but i 'm not sure about that , actually . 
  it obviously is n't a perfect system , sure , specially because we do have a lot of lazy people basically living on welfare ( that much is true about the propaganda ) . 
  could you please produce that google search ? 
  i 'm pretty sure prison is only for fraud ; max that can happen for lack of legit payment ( ie , not fraudulent ) is to have your stuff taken . 
  what 's the book made of , gold ? 
  corporations are n't divine yet , why is this here ? 
  i still do n't think i understand what it is . 
  at least your eyes are open . 
  the oompa-loompas of science .
