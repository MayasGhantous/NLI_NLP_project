  nah , in portugal , everyone 's favourite little food spot is at their mother 's . 
  it 's safe !, 
  those are really close capitals , what map is that ? 
  oh shit , did n't even notice , i only saw that constantinople is in the wrong side of the strait ... 
  that city must have grown so fast it failed to get a religion from pressure alone . 
  there are several police forces in france . 
  the municipal police which , afaik , can not carry , the national police which can , and the gendarmes , which are sort of a liason between the military and civilians , and they can carry as well . 
  this is n't in france , though , but i think it is very similar in italy . 
  pretty much all southern european countries police forces are like that . 
  `` but all you have to do is go to a wal-mart , stop being such a loser , get out of your parents basement and be a man , buy a gun ! '', 
  can you find that again ? 
  would love to see . 
  it was n't , everything is in italian , so it 's either in italy , san marino or the vatican city . 
  as opposed to running for their lives protected ? 
  said like that , it just looks like a gesture of greeting , as you put it . 
  i do n't think it means anything . 
  but just go ahead and ask her , say you are n't too sure about portuguese ways , you know , 
  yes . 
  no , what we have a hard time understanding is how it is acceptable to have such easy availability of a tool which only purpose is to kill to the general public . 
  he 's giving an hypothesis and asking how it would turn out , in no way is he saying americans are cowboys , what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  and the gun issue should be resolved with both gun control and education . 
  i 'm sorry , tried googling it , what is ccp ? 
  concealed carry permit ? 
  if i 'm reading that correctly ( my french is a bit rusty ) , they can carry but they need monitorization equipment ( cameras , mics , etc ) , and it requires a special permit from the mayor , yes ? 
  still , i stand corrected . 
  gun control is n't just about sale , it 's also about disposal of current weaponry . 
  you 're right that the us has an abundance of guns , which is why you could never have a one-time gun ban , so to say , and expect it to work . 
  it has to be gradual . 
  like , twenty to fifty years gradual . 
  vastly reducing the number of available guns and their ease of availability ( easier said than done , of course , but it 's not impossible as seen in europe ) , allied with a general public education on the danger of guns , is what most non-americans have in mind about how to solve the gun situation in america . 
  but sure , since it 's not our matter , all we can do is watch you eventually fix it , whatever way you want . 
  it is now , i could be wrong but in the byzantine empire it was only on the european side , with a few villages on the other side that eventually all merged into istanbul . 
  had to search for it , it seems to be of around 1937 . 
  i searched for coffee dumping in rio as per the ship doing just that in the map , found [ this ] ( http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/rumsey~8~1~260182~5522897:south-america-in-globular-perspecti ) . 
  a crab . 
  hurray for best korea # 1 !, 
  why is that , are they clearing the path for better breathing ? 
  that 's a british joke waiting to be told . 
  somebody nuke this chain already . 
  that article is a bit confusing :, 
   the name ` nils olav ' has also been given to two other king penguins who preceded the current nils olav as the king 's guard 's mascot . 
  so which one got the knighthood , ii or iii ? 
  whoever thought of adding `` color '' code must be laughing at it right now . 
  i do n't get it , why would spain have portugal because of civ ? 
  i 've never been to arizona ( or the us for that matter ) so i have no idea what to think now . 
  but i guess that , like anywhere else on earth , arizona is a giant place with many different geographical profiles . 
  love your edit . 
  cunts . 
  i love those pictures !, 
  so beautiful !, 
  thanks for sharing . 
  also , i 'm from portugal , you ca n't impress me with good weather . 
  dat snow , tough ...

  unrelated , but what 's up with your username ? 
  just curious :p, 
  close to 29 and yes , pok\u00e9mon has zero appeal to me as well . 
  it will always look like a children 's game to me , yet there are adults with children who play with their kids . 
  i think that 's fascinating . 
  puzzling , but nice . 
   either isabella or spain . 
  what ? 
  so by straight line you mean constant latitude , yeah ? 
  not really , we have a lot of blank crosses around here too . 
  you do n't have to be a protestant to wear a necklace with a blank cross , that 's what i 'm saying . 
  there are plenty of blank crosses in the catholic world , as well as jesus-wearing ones , sure . 
  who ? 
  ~ ~ maul ~ ~ ^ * dooku , sidious and himself ? 
  ^ * brain fart . 
  time . 
  for the old and retired . 
  portugal . 
  it 's a lot like florida , except without swamps , dangerous wildlife and floridians . 
  it 's okay , i meant dooku as well and said maul instead . 
  is that supposed to sound like mario ? 
  what kind of portuguese ? 
  and why portuguese ? 
  it 's spelt braaga , not [ brega ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yl1jymcitjg#t=175 ) !, 
  also , nice jellyfish reference . 
  it 's okay , european portuguese being somewhat hard is something we braga bout anyway . 
   my wife is from europe , and have been many times to europe just never portugal till now . 
  that europe is a continent and portugal 's in it !, 
  jokes aside , a few redditors have contributed into writing [ this nice guide ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/portugal/wiki/index ) of portugal and the portuguese , and i highly recommend you read it in some detail . 
  namely , follow the link for the city of lisbon , since you 're staying nearby , and read what you can about it . 
  i most definitely recommend a one or two day visit to many of the monuments around . 
  if you 're coming anywhere near june 13th , the festivals in honour of one of the city 's saints are at its peak , with lots of wine , sardines and music . 
  and people , so be careful with your kids . 
  there is n't any special danger , but small streets packed with thousands of people make it easy to lose anyone from sight . 
  but , close to lisbon , i would also recommend you visit [ sintra ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sintra ) , the [ batalha ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/batalha+monastery/@39.659158,-8.82554,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0xd227545c8a9b7b9:0x56110d7fa73d1de9 ) ( [ link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/batalha_monastery ) ) and the [ alcoba\u00e7a ] ( https://www.google.pt/maps/place/alcoba%c3%a7a+monastery/@39.548209,-8.979607,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0xd18a5d9d953f9c1:0xef1eaa8ca99202ac ) ( [ link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alcoba%c3%a7a_monastery ) ) monasteries , since you 're already about 100 km north of lisbon . 
  there are also several castles in many locations , like the [ almourol castle ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/almourol+castle/@39.461943,-8.383912,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xb00d11a42c575286 ) ( [ link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/castle_of_almourol ) ) , in the middle of the tagus river ( although it may be closed , i do n't know for sure ... ) , or the small town of [ \u00d3bidos ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%93bidos_municipality ) and its castle . 
  finally , be sure to eat in the shittiest looking restaurants you can find . 
  they 're the cheapest and the best . 
  maybe the architect really went for something he/she liked . 
  ah , yes , the old shoshone deity cheese tactic . 
  i would n't mind being recalled to relevance in the present ... 
  it does n't work on deity iirc , so you set the limit to three turns , information era , settle once , move the remaining two settlers far enough to settle , win . 
  works with any civ !, 
  go buy a fan . 
  que surpresa . 
  but the rule says nothing about comments , only posts ?
