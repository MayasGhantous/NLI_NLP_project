  i 'll remove it because it is n't funny anyway , sure . 
  two racists drinking black beer . 
  sounds great . 
  somewhat related , but have you seen americans and bullfighting ? 
  if a bullfigther gets hit , or heck , there 's a reasonably related accident , you hear the cries of justice and how happy they are for the death/injuries of another human being . 
  now do n't get me wrong , i 'm all for abolishing bull death and torture , but the american reaction is just way , way over the top . 
  that 's the thing , though , sometimes it is n't even a crime . 
  it 's hatred born out of ignorance : /, 
  nice try , mo [ n ] strengo . 
  my only beef with it is that depressed , unmotivated people , sometimes simply have no goal . 
  they just go with the tide . 
  i take it you built the national college there too . 
  [ and mcdonald 's ] ( http://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/mcdonalds-of-uk-ireland-625x742.jpg ) . 
  i am ignorant about the arab language : what 's with the empty long lines ? 
  culturally , it is . 
  i thought meat is flesh used as food . 
  picture nine shows that it was finished in 1680 . 
  this was a bit over 150 years after the portuguese reached sri lanka . 
  damn workers take so many turns to reach city-states . 
  still , awesome find . 
  as a portuguese , i love it !, 
  it shows architecture that is so far away in space and time , but that i can still see in lisbon . 
   we ate them to fast for pictures . 
  haha , that 's good !, 
  also , you need a lot more chouri\u00e7o . 
  how is this martin vargic ? 
  unless i 'm missing something else , the map mentions a jay jason simons facebook page , and the name of the file is map_of_the_stereotypes_by_jaysimons-d7jo0w0 . png . 
  were they anything like the ones in the site you provided ? 
  is that a battleship ? 
  you 're in it already . 
  do n't worry , the collective brain power of reddit will eventually figure it out . 
  or you can just do alt + 255 . 
  it 's not space , it 's an invisible character . 
  you quit wow after just a month ? 
  weakling indeed . 
  just search / r/askreddit and / r/til for portugal , and you 'll get a lot of discussion about it , it 's pretty much the only times we 're mentioned there because of how successful it was . 
  geres and serra da estrela if you enjoy nature . 
  wrong subreddit : no money here . 
  i too , would rather have humanity than a medal . 
  looks like a statue , not a cosplayer ... 
  not so in english . 
  also known as a merchant of venice , most badasser settler there is . 
  edit :, 
  i wonder , what happens if you conquer it the venice/austria way ? 
  of all the signs you could pick , that one 's the worst choice , as it 's pretty much used [ all over the world ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stop_sign#stop_signs_around_the_world ) . 
  it 's good if you 're used to it . 
  as is celsius . 
  or kelvin . 
  or rankine . 
  you ca n't read it in the image anyway . 
  it 's not odd at all , pretty much all measurement units are named after scientists . 
  [ lord kelvin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/william_thomson,_1st_baron_kelvin ) , [ fahrenheit ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/daniel_gabriel_fahrenheit ) and [ celsius ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anders_celsius ) in this case . 
  of course , you have others not named after anybody but that have a meaning in whatever language they were created , like metres and feet . 
  i think what 's really cringe is how often people from this subreddit do n't get satire . 
  ** that 's fat !, 
  what are the bold lines separating ? 
  i 'm more used to [ these ] ( http://www.learner.org/interactives/historymap/images/new50intro_07.gif ) regions . 
  cool . 
  what were your criteria in choosing the musics ? 
  you won because you did n't pick the mountain route . 
   to be fair it seems that the rain was caused by the radioactive gas cloud to begin with . 
  how do you figure that ? 
  it seems to me that it 's just typical weather behaviour . 
  orographic rainfall is a common type of precipitation , it just so happened that the air was also contaminated and the rain brought it all down . 
  but i can see how that 'd work for the frontal precipitation , a radioactive gas cloud must be warm indeed . 
  that 's a different definition of [ country ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constituent_country ) . 
  it 's autonomous , yes , but it is not a sovereign country . 
  which is why it 'd be strange that denmark is marked as something while greenland is n't . 
  could use more information . 
  * what kind of place are you looking for ( middle of nowhere , close to beaches , cities , etc ) ? 
  * when would this be ? 
  * do you want it all for yourself or can you share occasionally with the owners ( with young kids of their own ) ? 
  * would you have your own transportation ? 
  * would you be able to share part of the cost for the rest ( food , electricity , water , etc ) , while still paying nothing for a roof ? 
  depending on the answer , i might be able to hook you up with something ( absolutely no guarantees for that , though ) , or someone else might . 
  i 'm not arguing at your post specifically , i 'm arguing about how it could be strange that a non-sovereign country is different than its sovereign state , in response solely to / u/tebbe97 's two posts . 
  that is all . 
  the place i 'd have in mind is isolated , not close to the beach , with no decent public transportation ( only twice a day , i think ) , but nearby town can be reached by bicycle , and it has no internet and not great signal for mobile , so i doubt it is what you 're looking for . 
  but i wish you the best of luck !, 
  i ca n't get any enjoyment at all from doing exercise , and some people can actually get orgasms ? 
  this is n't fair :(, 
  i 've already been going for over two years , managed to lose nearly 40 kg ( with diets too , ofc ) , and i can appreciate the effect for sure , but the physical activity still feels dull and boring . 
  i have no desire to demoralize anyone , but i guess some people do n't have the pleasure chemicals working fine ... 
  the only reasons i still go is for health , and self discipline . 
  i no longer aim to be awesomely fit . 
  my response for another user is about the same here , really :,

  it sucks . 
  it really really does . 
  but i still go , because nature . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.oportocityhostel.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/francesinha_@_ar_do_rio.jpg ) is the best picture of a francesinha i 've ever seen . 
  i just had lunch , and it made me hungry . 
  thought i should share . 
  edit : actual [ source ] ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/fortes/3190847021/ ) for the picture !, 
  hmmm , king 's landing pizza ... one can only imagine how succulent george 's description of that would be . 
  because it looks like a buffering icon . 
  the only thing you do with the buffering icon is play snake with it .
