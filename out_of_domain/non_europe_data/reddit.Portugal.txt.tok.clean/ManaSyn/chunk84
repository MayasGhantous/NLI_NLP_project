  as much as i 'd love zelda-based characters and tracks , they 're not part of the mario universe . 
  this is n't smash bros. 
  that was my impression as well , first time seems unskippable . 
  maybe it 's navi/a fairy in human form . 
  would be one powerful aoe attack !, 
  i remember playing the snes version so long ago ... saying i have n't touched the game in nearly twenty years sounds about right , but i still remember some of the shortcuts , like the narrow straight in one of the ghost circuits you had to use a mushroom to jump to . 
  ah , good times . 
  heck , we even have that in the big surface supermarkets around here . 
  like [ this ] ( http://www.hipersuper.pt/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/continente_cascais__zona-mercado.low_.jpg ) ( this is just the fruit and vegetable area ) . 
  the fish and meat areas also have workers who you talk to and give you the parts you desire . 
  that said , there are also the packed versions of pretty much everything , for those who prefer that . 
  i think one important distinction is the weaponry industry which , in the us , is probably massive . 
  i 'm impressed your horse could piss his way trough the wall . 
  what are you putting in his water ? 
  how about pressing the little + in it ? 
  related question , what about the piranha plant ? 
  you can also spam it for small boost . 
  my only hope is that terrorist organizations are too dumb to understand the potential terror wiping out a national football team has . 
  good thing they probably watch it , anyway . 
  which concept ? 
  he ca n't access it with gold from where he 's standing now . 
  wtf is the eye central thing even supposed to be ? 
  isto est\u00e1 na [ frontpage ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/wtf/comments/27z2vf/protesters_in_brazil_at_the_world_cup_being/ ) , porque puseste aqui ? 
  do / r/wtf . 
  er , that was n't a good question . 
  i meant , for the battleship 's eye , what 's the iris/pupil/centre supposed to be ? 
  kanecos \u00e0 mistura , dispensa-se . 
  \u00c9 o sangue viking . 
  yes , it 's just you . 
  nobody else has your thoughts . 
  or hispania , the roman name . 
  definitely not spain . 
  heck , i just tried writing a small sentence , it 's amazing how fast and random key pressing looks like . 
  that 's why this is in unexpected . 
  so different gliders do have an effect on air speed . 
  figured as much . 
  what 's with the last one for thowmp ruins , is that really a shortcut of any kind ? 
  robin hood 's black hand . 
  if you kill yourself because it happens , why do you need to know when ? 
  this may have been the first time i 've ever heard a kangaroo ... 
  i would say [ 4chan ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/wfhe7/just_sayin/ ) indeed . 
  vi [ isto ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zroc3t2npgy/tisg_fqfoli/aaaaaaaabb4/pxy4eg8tg2g/s1600/legal+immigration+flow+chart.jpg ) no outro dia . 
  as portuguese , i can relate . 
  must be something about places starting with p , like pluto . 
  ah , that is better . 
  portugal smashes puny foes with the power of the atom . 
  i like it !, 
  another border between portugal and spain :, 
  why not ? 
  as a portuguese , i love schnitzels . 
   6 ) portuguese when happy : - huehuehue portuguese when sad : - pepepepe, 
  please , we 'd rather not be stereotyped as laughing like that on the internets . 
  we use lol and hahaha as much as almost everyone else . 
  none of that facesmashing nonsense . 
  from what i 've read on reddit lately , i hope that cat has no death-causing syndrome of any kind . 
  you 're still part of the young crowd , old man . 
  found [ this ] ( https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/ficheiro:de-rinderkennzeichnungs-_und_rindfleischetikettierungs%c3%bcberwachungsaufgaben%c3%bcbertragungsgesetz.ogg ) , why is it slighty different ? 
  still , it sounds impossible to understand . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/fun/news/a444700/longest-word-has-189819-letters-takes-three-hours-to-pronounce.html#~ohsrekgyxgtlmi ) 's the source . 
  i ca n't even ... 
  it sounds russian . 
  i wonder how much of it is n't gibberish . 
  is n't the south exit ( and surroundings ) the only place on earth where the pacific is to the east and the atlantic is to the west ? 
  the only annoying thing is this talk of freedom , when [ we 're just as free ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_in_the_world ) . 
  i know it 's mostly a joke but we really do n't want your freedom . 
  i know . 
  but it 's about the same feeling you get when americans are called gun-loving fatasses . 
  it 's 99 % a joke , yet it 's annoying . 
  shit , i live in portugal and had a really hard time identifying iberia , untill i realized it 's the gigantic blob . 
  funnily enough , the lisbon area is not distorted at all . 
   some of the earliest science in the world was done by muslims . 
  that 's a really odd sentence to say . 
  sure , the arabian empire was a center of enlightenment at the time , but it was hardly ` earliest ' . 
  there is an anti-portugal crowd , yes . 
  they 're called the portuguese . 
  not sure why you 're being downvoted , as far as i 'm aware you are correct . 
  while the duration of the day is constant troughout the year , the direction the sun illuminates anything in the equator is not . 
  that can be seen [ here ] ( http://astrocoffeehut.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/equinox_solstice-equator.jpg ) and [ here ] ( http://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/ua/earthcirclesandsunrays.png ) . 
  como ? 
  the vomitorium is not a place to vomit ... 
  nice battlecruiser reference . 
  should have been ( ? | \u00bf ) , at least ... 
  i have no idea what either of those are ( well , i do now , thanks google ) . 
  but people thinking the vomitorium is a place to vomit is a common , although understandable , mistake . 
  our warp drive testing was a success . 
  we apologise for any inconvenience . 
   what time is it ? 
   it 's half past green . 
  it 's the only good thing about gold , to be honest . 
  there 's some discounts in some stores or whatever if you 're american , though , no idea how useful they 'd be . 
  yeah , this confused me . 
  i 'm not french but portuguese , and i 'd read samantha and samanta in the exact same way . 
  how do they differ phonetically in english ? 
  it 's catholic . 
  the symbols would be the [ chi rho ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chi_rho ) and the [ alpha and omega ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alpha_and_omega ) . 
  you can see them both [ here ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/bentoxvi-44-11052007.jpg/640px-bentoxvi-44-11052007.jpg ) under the apex of the catholic church . 
  besides , they look like they 're from latin america . 
  but for what it is worth , i 've had a catholic education and all the priests wore robes like that in the masses . 
  it does make sense , sure , but i 'd still read it as samansa or samantsa ... that \u03b8 sound , it 's quite hard for me . 
  that 's why i ca n't spell third , most of the times i read it as turd .
