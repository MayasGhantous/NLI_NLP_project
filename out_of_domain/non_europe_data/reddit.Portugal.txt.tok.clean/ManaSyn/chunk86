  also , awesome video . 
  in hardpoint domination , my titan was there as a giant taxi of doom . 
  and to give me some cover or serve as distraction while i captured flags . 
  the animations to get out and get in are just too damn amazing , too . 
  only played it this weekend , but i thought that was the whole point of the campaign storyline . 
  saturday is the sabbath , not sunday . 
  the week starting in the day of the lord ( sunday ) , after the sabbath , is an old catholic tradition . 
  in fact , in portuguese , the days of the week are named with the ordinal numeration . 
  domingo , second day , third day , fourth day , fifth day , sixth day , s\u00e1bado . 
  this is why plenty of countries have their week starting on the sunday . 
  wait , the week does start on sunday in portugal . 
  not the work week , just the week . 
  no idea why it 's shown as yellow . 
  actually it 's an old testament thing so that guy had nothing to do with it :p, 
  fuck , i would just have fallen over , that is amazing !, 
  you really only noticed one country ? 
  after watching the video and seeing you jumping and yelling with those colours , i was really happy about you !, 
  much love from portugal !, 
  very few with the exact same writing and pronunciation . 
  eso and isso , for instance . 
  please do n't believe this guy . 
  he 's full of shit . 
  as a portuguese , i appreciate it !, 
  thanks all of you . 
  it 's a [ cabo verde ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cape_verde ) flag . 
  to be honest he just seems to be copying the titles from the threads . 
  i ca n't really say he 's giving credit to himself , but he 's also not giving credit where it 's due , that is true . 
  it seems to be a scarf . 
  you can read his comment [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/28wgap/the_moment_portugal_scored_the_gametying_goal/cifh0qd ) . 
  what ? 
  that only did anything.after the first unit died , yeah ? 
  minorities aside , every country in europe is considered to be culturally white . 
  i have no idea why americans seem to see the mediterranean people as non-white . 
  i 'm new to this , but how much damage does it do anyway ? 
  i thought it was instakill for anything in range . 
  what are peak times in gmt ? 
  no problem , i got you covered , free of charge :, 
  i think somebody in the other thread mentioned they got damaged by a nuclear eject , but not killed , due to moving out of range before all ticks went off so it 's not entirely a moot point , if it had work . 
  thanks for busting the myth !, 
  we 're praying , we 're praying !, 
  [ if you ca n't see it ] ( http://i.imgur.com/llw20bq.png ) . 
  at least i hope that 's it . 
  are you enjoying yourself or just have a slow internet ? 
  the gibraltarians ( yes , that 's actually a word , i googled it ) . 
  i 'm not sure they 're actually english , but fuck it , you 're all camones to us . 
  ep\u00e1 , se eu quisesse ver posts do facebook eu abria a merda do facebook !, 
  yeah i 'm actually an atheist . 
  using [ this ] ( http://www.flaginstitute.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/protocol/uk-flag-diagrams.gif ) as measurements for the english flag , we get a 180 in \u00b2 rectangle ( vertical , 30x6 ) and two 132 in \u00b2 ( horizontal , 22x6 ) , summing to 444 in \u00b2 or 29.6 % of total area ( 1500 in \u00b2 ) . 
  using [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/construction_sheet_of_the_japanese_flag_no_text.svg/486px-construction_sheet_of_the_japanese_flag_no_text.svg.png ) for the japanese flag , the circle has 3/5 units of radius , or an area of about 1.13 units \u00b2 . 
  or about 18.85 % of total area ( 6 units \u00b2 ) . 
  and there you have it . 
  if i did n't fuck it up somehow . 
  as a portuguese who 's american by ... actually , by nothing . 
  nevermind . 
  portugal , its culture and its people are all considered mediterranean , even though none of it touches the sea at all . 
  including the atlantic islands . 
  where can we find a giant drum to sit on ? 
  can . 
   since most of the people here is portuguese ... 
  i reckon we 're all advanced learners of portuguese . 
  isto \u00e9 legal ? 
  basically , a girl broke some shit so she could go to prison to be with her boyfriend who was there for dealing drugs . 
  edit : the host from the show also calls her dumb because she would never go to the same prison anyway . 
  hmm , to put it simply :, 
  poder = power , ie , posso fazer means something like i have the power to do , i have the option , i am available to do , i am allowed to do . 
  conseguir = ability , ie , consigo fazer means something like i am able to do , i have the capacity to do , i have learnt how to do . 
  i hope this is clear enough , although the two verbs are also relatively interchangeable . 
  was n't there a scenic video maker doing things like that ? 
  we say that last one as `` in rome , be roman '' , so i did n't catch his phrase at first either . 
  portugal . 
  edit : it actually seems your way is closer to the [ original ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/si_fueris_romae,_romano_vivito_more;_si_fueris_alibi,_vivito_sicut_ibi#latin ) anyway , 
  [ tyl ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muslim ) :, 
   a muslim , sometimes spelled moslem, 
   alternating between the left right method into llrr, 
  what are those ? 
  that was awesome !, 
  if your grill runs away , you must be really bad at barbecuing . 
  final quote :, 
   good job staying alive down there . 
  it makes more than one sense , seeing that is how you actually spell it . 
  barbecue . 
  you have now . 
  i suppose it may be a matter of geography . 
  it seems muslim is the most used english form nowadays anyway . 
  sopa do dia is n't a specific soup , it is whatever the owner decided to make a giant pot of . 
  sometimes , it has meat . 
  caldo verde , for instance , generally has a piece of chouri\u00e7o ( a kind of pork sausage ) , [ like so ] ( https://www.google.pt/search?q=caldo+verde&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=y8evu7xqfkha0qw484ciaw&amp;ved=0cayq_auoaq&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=965 ) . 
  you should definitely warn your users about it . 
  to note , we really are n't a vegetarian country . 
  there are vegetarians , of course , but they generally prepare their own meals at home . 
  that said , sure , there 's a few restaurants . 
  i 've tried one in lisbon once , it was actually better than expected . 
  also , your pictures are awesome , and the porto one in the end is really , really nice . 
  did you take them ? 
  to be fair , it is probable that today 's soup will always be made of vegetables . 
  it 's cheaper . 
  i do n't know where you 're from , but i feel you . 
  for some reason , portuguese and spanish people ( and all southern europe ) are not considered white in america ... 
  i feel you , i tried the game during those 48h free thing , but i am too poor atm to actually buy the game , and i keep enjoying videos because that is all i can do . 
  seeing people complain about what was the most fun 48h ( well , okay , less than that ) i 've had in months makes me sad :(,
