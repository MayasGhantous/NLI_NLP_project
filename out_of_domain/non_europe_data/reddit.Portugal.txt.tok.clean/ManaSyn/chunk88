  was all that done in tvt or did you rodeo a lot and they did n't know what hit them ? 
  no , it 's a $ 10 space station . 
  you should try friendly fire with the vortex shield . 
  both a friendly titan shooting at you to see if it reflects , and an enemy titan aiming at other titan from his team and see if it does damage . 
  probably neither works , and it 's not really a usable tactic ( unless you have an ogre with core taking damage and shooting a fuckton of bullets with the first one ) . 
  his killcam must have been fun . 
  ... til they have flavour text . 
  i like the smart pistol 's `` so it 'll do calculus now ? 
  you should really check your sound when you 're making a video . 
  the echo is really annoying ... 
  it almost looks like a giant face which is slowly looking at you , `` why are you doing this to me :| ? 
  i do n't understand why you keep mispelling manuel in brazil either !, 
  no idea why no one mentioned the burning stadium , nice touch . 
  you can also fire hop after using mushrooms and speed boost platforms ( the orange ones , no idea what they 're called ) . 
  i 'm sure the mosquitoes try really hard to spread malaria . 
  are you running ingame origin ? 
  i do n't know , [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/titanfall/comments/2ai3aw/help_low_fps_in_titanfall/ ) similar thread says it is . 
  there is no england in the fourth panel . 
  nevermind , i 'm a dumbass , i thought the english flag were the diagonal lines !, 
  it is nice to see so many portugal comics of late . 
  what are peak hours ? 
  i 'm sure i could read anything from a serbian poet , too . 
  as long as it was in the latin alphabet . 
  i would n't understand a word , or pronounce it if asked , but i could read it . 
  you wish , the final was against portugal . 
  [ proof ] ( http://metro.co.uk/2014/07/12/north-korea-media-tells-country-that-its-team-has-reached-world-cup-final-4796033/ ) . 
  what the hell is up with those urls ? 
  you could check some [ videos ] ( http://tf.reddit.com/r/titanfall/search?q=flair%3avideo+and+tip&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=hot&amp;t=all ) for tips . 
  but for me , the fun comes from all the parkour/non-stopping movement rather than the actual fps part , so try and find something you enjoy . 
  that has been fixed . 
  only because the rising people wins , or it 'd be called a rebellion . 
  yes , i get that , but which hours would those be ? 
  i just watched all ten episodes . 
  you guys sound really fun . 
  keep them coming !, 
  better versions by [ / u/capitao _ falcao ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/portugal/comments/2anwtt/a_carro%c3%a7a_de_rui_reininho/cix1u40 ) :, 
  it was well worth it , tell vanessa reddit says hi !, 
  * tips hatch *, 
  i play on pc , it is fixed for me . 
  that was a lucky mark kill . 
  in european portuguese , ` joo ' followed by a strong ` aww ' . 
  edit : i do n't mean a long ` aww ' like you saw a really cute kitten . 
  i mean you speak it like you 're a giant viking of doom .

  be careful next time you [ reddit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/2aopbw/redditors_outside_the_united_states_what_are_the/ ) in the shower . 
  that 's over midnight for me , i wish i could pay so late :p, 
  but i guess we get peak hours in europe , too !, 
  it says so right there , x kills per minute . 
  titanfall itself also seems to be 50 % off . 
  i have an important task scheduled for today so i could n't try it so far , but i want to see if i can hit this up later today and tonight . 
  hope i 'll find some people in there !, 
  oh this is great , thanks for the link !, 
  edit : also , op ; feel free to add me , but i 'm from west europe . 
  ca n't tell if spelling error or scottish ... 
  edit : yes , yes , i get it , i thought he meant ` dearly ' , not `` nearly '' ... 
   for allowing them to build campo bahia on a nature reserve . 
  well this is awful . 
  it sounds like a strategic move by some rich guys to steal more land from nature . 
   i would nearly pay someone, 
  or is this a joke i just did n't get ? 
  i see , i thought he meant ` dearly ' . 
  now that i think of it , i guess i dumb . 
  firefly . 
  espera ... 
  are you drunk or something ? 
  such strange commentaries ( loved it ! ), 
  a few commentaries , in the 3rd top play the narrator mentions you throw out some satchels into the flag ( ~ 4:15 ) . 
  they were n't satchels . 
  a bit before he mentioned a titan with a 40 mm when it was a chaingun . 
  i understand this is a pilot episode , so i guess that 's okay , but i do n't understand why you are n't the one narrating ( the end sounded really weird ) . 
  speaking of pilot episode , when 's the titan episode coming ? 
  i know , i was joking :p, 
  my only critique really is the number of mistakes in the names of weapons and all , and the goofy voice at the end is perhaps avoidable , but that 's it really . 
  i liked it . 
  yeah , this will be a fun challenge , already have 2 titan kills , 48 to go !, 
  but frothyomen 's [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o7uq6fn-j0 ) is quite good and as far as i can tell , the lack of mobility you get from having to aim down the sight is compensated by the stryder . 
  it really is a gun where you have to get the fuck away from the enemies . 
  definitely not my kind of gun , but it really is powerful . 
  why big punch if you want to be as far away as possible ? 
  est\u00e1 giro , o trailer . 
  it certainly is more newb friendly , which is definitely a good thing . 
  it does , check how wide you drift when you have it . 
  regenerate . 
  but i doubt it . 
  that would at least improve australia 's climate policies . 
  hmm . 
  `` t-t-thanks , you too ... '', 
  he was 16 , that 's probably the only thing he was paying attention to . 
  everybody likes boobs , specially at 16 . 
  then you do n't understand the culture . 
  some people do get offended for being given money after helping someone because they do it to be nice , and only that . 
  titans ca n't see them . 
  that 's because it is [ made in portugal ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/renova_ ( brand ) ( add a ) in the end of the url , i ca n't seem to make it work even using \\ like usual ... 
  this is it , really . 
  the work mentality of people is just different . 
  i do n't find it hard to understand at all . 
  that is virtually one of the shittiest places in all of portugal , not just the azores , and their accent is the strongest out of the already very strong azorean accent . 
  i hope you do n't judge portugal and its language out of that !, 
  i know you meant the sounds . 
  i guess it can sound like that to a foreigner , with french being a lot of low pitch and spanish a lot of high pitch , and portuguese having both .
