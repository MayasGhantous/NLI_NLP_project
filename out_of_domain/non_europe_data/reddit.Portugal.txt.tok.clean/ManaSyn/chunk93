  the accent , the slim looks , some of the jokes and puns of ten , but on a totally different scale . 
  i am loving him . 
  so what you 're saying is that you both have dark humour and laughed at the most insensitive moments ? 
  i 'm confused , are n't your sister in-law 's parents also your spouse parents ? 
  there 's no denying truck drivers are very important , but there 's something i 've ever wondered : why is n't everything shipped by train ( or ship ) and trucks are only for local transport ? 
  download , puro e simples , ou download para venda ? 
  i 'm curious , we have n't seen a clip from you even if you 're pretty amazing yourself . 
  is there a reason for that or you think these clips are just better ? 
  nice , it takes about 157 billion years to crack my passwords . 
  that 's an upgrade from the 3 hours it took to crack my old password . 
  how is sending twelve trucks cheaper than sending one train ? 
  bulk is almost always cheaper than not bulk . 
  as for what else , it might very well have been lobbying . 
  it does give jobs to a lot more people . 
  i 'm curious if anyone actually knows . 
  i figured , thanks . 
  short scale : ( 10 ^ 3 ) ^ x +1, 
  example : billion , x = 2 , ( 10 ^ 3 ) ^ 3 or 1,000,000,000 . 
  undecillion is ( 10 ^ 3 ) ^ 11 +1 , from undecimo , eleven . 
  i 'm writing this on my phone so do forgive tucked up formatting . 
  then i 've always mistranslated ` in-law ' . 
  i thought it was the family of your spouse . 
  what is it then ? 
  i use the initials of a long but easy sentence in a seldom used internet language that changes , in an encrypted mode only i know , with different websites . 
  whatever i inserted there is unique . 
  as an example :, 
  reddit , you suck - r , ys, 
  facebook , you suck - f , ys, 
  i can remember different passwords for different websites , which matters because if one gets hacked , the others are still safe . 
  of course mine ai n't that simple , too . 
  ah , that makes sense , thanks !, 
  read above . 
  no it does n't . 
  read above . 
  okay , i give up . 
  so how much time is represented here ? 
  girls ask men out .

  if the crucible is there , why is n't the citadel ? 
  also , where are the prothean ships from ?

  the lyrics are about his visit to an old widow and her cute daughter . 
  it 's pretty much a lot of allegories about him fucking the daughter . 
  it 's really not subtle . 
  should have added units !, 
  not everyone knows the height of bill gates in metres . 
  what 's your paper about ? 
  edit :, 
  i know , right ? 
  the accent . 
  it looks great in english , but better in his northern portugal accent if you can understand him . 
  i do n't know , it does look to be 4 times in length . 
  it 's also about , dunno , two or three times in radius proportion , which would mean the citadel is then about 15 to 30 times larger in volume than the crucible . 
  assuming cylinders volume , that is :, 
  could you explain it better , please ? 
  coolness . 
  one bot read your youtube links and created a playlist , also providing a mobile link . 
  another bot read that mobile link and demobiled it . 
  it was useless . 
  nice taste in music , btw !, 
  the only thing i really want is for the game to have some lore and that you can understand what the fuck is going on in the campaign . 
  it took me several playtroughs to realise that there 's not only a war going on , but it 's also about spectres replacing grunts , like some sort of terminator 's skynet plot , and even then i 'm not exactly sure that 's what 's happening .

  how much do you love your job ? 
  also , do you have a team to help celebrities read questions , or do they actually read them . 
  because they must be in the thousands . 
  huh , i had never heard about that , but i have n't played lotro which it seems that 's where those are from . 
  eorlingas is the rohirric word for rohirrim .

  you help celebrities with their amas , right ? 
  do they read the questions themselves , or do you read them out loud , and if so , alone or with a team . 
  fair enough , that actually makes sense . 
  yes , but in many places in the world north america is a colloquial term for the us .
