  why do you think southern europeans are n't white ? 
  this goes for italians , greeks , spanish , portuguese . 
  way i see it , we 're all white , but i 've seen a lot of time people saying we 're not , that we 're hispanic or just a minority . 
  op is russia . 
  by free do you mean no cost or available ? 
  or both ... 
  yes . 
  ( just getting the obvious out of the way ), 
  it must be fun being 14 . 
  i 'm white and from europe and i 'd love if you lot just stayed in america , thank you very much , we have nothing against purple people !, 
  we also say bm in portugal . 
  not the english bm , the portuguese bm . 
  i never heard anyone call it beamer or anything of the sort , that just sounds horrible . 
  `` your home or mine ? '', 
  good lord , no . 
  is n't nanotechnology supposed to be the solution to this , eventually ? 
  nice music !, 
  the tagus is n't polluted at all . 
  [ this ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3tjkdels1va/uz1_x8tvoci/aaaaaaaapho/n4pd5kdhpwc/s1600/citarum-river-west-java-indonesia-the-most-polluted-river-in-the-world-the-flying-tortoise-001.jpg ) is a polluted river . 
  unfortunately he died way before that . 
  [ eli5  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_exceptionalism ) world rules not always apply to america because it was created under just humane principles , in a fashion . 
  i 'm not saying it makes sense , i 'm eli5ing what it [ is ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_exceptionalism ) . 
  personally i think it 's bullshit , something every empire always say about itself . 
  damn straight , i wish i could be among humanity 's first space pioneers !, 
  which rule is it breaking ? 
  maybe it is n't explicit , but i was taking a picture of the landscape while travelling by car , and [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uivqtet.jpg ) ended up looking like the [ portuguese flag ] ( http://mundabor.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/portugal-flag.gif ) . 
  i thought it was good enough for this subreddit , but i guess it was n't , by popular vote . 
  i do not see , however , how is it breaking any rule . 
  allright , that 's more than fair , it is n't really a great submission . 
  [ spoilers ] ( #s `` check the video . 
  jack heavily implies he is the face of boe , who did die billions of years into the future . '' ), 
  [ jack spoilers video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mogtr2rpcsu ) , ca n't link it inside spoilers so watch it at your own risk . 
  but these are from season 3 , seven years ago . 
  what the heck is portugal , a little hamster hitler ? 
  was he garfield lazy or you just took pics of him laying down ? 
  must have been fairly active to live for so long . 
  that 's a bold assumption . 
  so what you 're saying is , wearing seatbelt is a win-neutral scenario , not wearing a seatbelt is a lose-neutral scenario . 
  why would anyone on his right mind not wear a seatbelt other than being a rebel teen ? 
  what 's the skip button for ? 
  that 's because it was invented by the greek , adapted by many people afterwards . 
  i would add that sp being included in the game is a way for you to learn a new set of skills : how to best avoid it . 
  that game is all about being agile without being on the open , unless you 're on a titan . 
  i 've learnt to parkour trough windows and doors and boy do i love it . 
  that 's the key here , really . 
  the driver is acting polite enough , asking questions and trying to understand what 's wrong . 
  if he acted like his mate in an aggressive manner , things would be different , i 'd wager . 
  they mispelt sovereign . 
  i do n't see any problem , i 've constantly had games to play using the variety pack . 
  it 's a shame there are no maps from the first dlc on the rotation , and that there are random disconnects , but those are titanfall bugs unrelated to destiny . 
  so , there were also only two people in the opposite team ? 
  this is nice , but i have to say i love this game 's death animations . 
  just look at [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utpwslsxtbu#t=40 ) one !, 
  it 's a thief , not a math student . 
  did the aliens jump directly into energy weapons ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  would n't it be a gaggle of goosers ? 
  oooh . 
  they mean the one with purple hair . 
  i said nothing about high mobility fighting . 
  you 're not supposed to outrun a smart pistol user , you 're supposed to hide from hidden smart pistols . 
  once you know he 's there , then you quickly make short work of him with a conventional weapon . 
  in the meanwhile , you have to stay mobile because that 's how this game is played . 
  knowing how to do that and staying hidden in corners and buildings at the same time requires knowledge of the routes and the skill to do it , and there 's really no reason to learn it other than to avoid sp users . 
   antes de portugal ter posto l\u00e1 os navios , as ilhas eram desabitadas . 
  i rest my case . 
  so that be why the text be piratey !, 
  tis the colour of blood !, 
  what ? 
  no they do n't . 
  edit : [ average wage ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_average_wage ) , the us is first in two of the three lists . 
  it 's more like our lady is fighting the irish . 
  i thought i recognized the roasted apple !, 
  try eating it grilled and with olive oil , the mediterranean way . 
  it 's very different to meat , but good nonetheless . 
  i 've gotten a server shutdown once or twice the last couple of days . 
  what 's up with that ? 
  i was playing campaign , finishing the darned plasma gun challenge . 
  school season usually starts in mid or late september which is why it ends in june . 
  it feels weird to us that you start classes in august !, 
  if they were underwater how did you know they were used ? 
  thank you . 
  the ocean explorers . 
  anyone that lives close to the sea or that has spent any time in a modern ship far away from land that all you see is sea knows how fucking scary it is . 
  space flight is great and requires a lot of courage and trust from the astronauts , but they are experts working under the supervision of experts who planned every detail . 
  the sailors were , for the most part , peasants led by slightly less peasant men venturing into the complete unknown , in tiny wooden ships that creeked all the time . 
  furthermore , death in space would be quick , and you would be remembered for centuries . 
  imagine what dieing in the sea is like , either waiting till you 're so tired you just give up , or feeling the dark horrors from the depths circling around you , completely alone in the world and forgotten by all but family ... 
  that , in my humble opinion , is the most badass thing any human has ever done so far . 
  the iberian peninsula is wrong , lisbon is too far south . 
  try and kill as many people as possible through all three games . 
  it is indeed extremely ignorant to say that africa has any lack of resource ... 
  it means `` kings '' in portuguese . 
  well , they were also under roman rule and they 're hardly italian . 
  but you 're big , right ? 
  where was this ? 
  it was a supermarket so i 'd be very well stocked with supplies . 
  no guns , this is n't america , but i 'd have plenty of knives and children 's colouring books . 
  and evil people are n't . 
  he left .
