  that 's right , you can actually watch the seasons trough the shadow of the night !, 
  it also shows cloud cover but i 'm not entirely sure if it is real time . 
  i think it 's daily rather than every 15 minutes like the rest . 
  the running . 
  \u00c9 domingo ... 
  why was the nurse tomato-faced in shame ? 
  damn straight . 
  that 's why he did n't think that . 
  one bananodollar ? 
  [ nope ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romani_people#origins ) . 
  what the hell is wrong with the [ sixth ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zxhaxvq.jpg ) ? 
  i can not play any other fps because you ca n't wallrun and everything is so slow . 
  hello . 
  there was recently an american guy asking about the [ same ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/portugal/comments/2il901/ill_be_in_portugal_for_about_a_week_starting_on/ ) here on / r/portugal , and i ended up taking him out to a nice dinner and a fado night i had a chance to get . 
  you 're more than welcome to pm the op and ask if he enjoyed it . 
  if you 're interested in maybe that , or maybe a walk trough an old neigbhourhood in lisbon followed by a nice lunch , or any other idea we can think of till then , i 'd love to do something . 
  as a fellow travelover ( not mispelt ) , i know the feelings you get from meeting a local who knows some cool spots . 
  i only ask that you share some cool stories !, 
  great !, 
  it 's still a bit early to know what exactly is going to happen ( and way too early to know what the weather 'll be like ) , but let 's talk !, 
  compared to lisbon , they are an awful lot more genuine , which means friendly people will look friendlier , and shitty people will look shittier . 
  i get the relevant username , but since 4chan is an educational hacker , [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hear,_hear ) . 
  oh man , you 're really being mean to the poor zulu people . 
  so , clap ? 
  no , but i would have understood better if he said that they had no real right to a defense , rather than talk about this sixth amendment i had to google about . 
  checkmate , bald people . 
  ca n't tell if reference to civ , arrested development , or both . 
  what 's got the fabric to do with the colour ? 
  to be completely pedantic , canada does use the metric time system . 
  even the us does . 
  ... a probable reference indeed . 
  sure , blame the portuguese . 
  titan hijacking . 
  this is why i do n't play the lottery . 
  i 'll try to keep a journal of the day , sure !, 
  \\  v\u00eddeo no reddit, 
  \\  50 minutos, 
  and the women . 
  you just have to act casual . 
  i would definitely be impressed if the perpetrator were to be killed by an ax . 
  so is the smart pistol overpowered for this ? 
  but if they fail , does it matter if they 're being used ? 
  yes , gen 10s get a beta invite . 
  because of [ this ] ( http://www.aco.nato.int/nato-fighters-rotate-in-the-baltic-states-and-poland.aspx ) - portuguese and canadian fighters commence baltic air policing duties . 
  i have the exact same contraption !, 
  did you by any chance buy it on lidl or aldi or some other low-cost supermarket ? 
  while you are correct as far as [ at least ] the english language goes , the guy who is said to have called them that first , columbus , did not call them indians but indios ( check # 2 [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indio ) ) . 
  a slight difference , i know , but even nowadays the portuguese and spanish languages differentiate between a native from indian and a native from the americans like that , indians and indios . 
  there 's nothing political incorrect about it , either . 
  i read the other day that someone did the math and it 'd be cheaper to live in barcelona and travel to london everyday than actually live in london . 
  wish i could find it now but am on mobile . 
  pic from [ this ] ( http://www.eldiario.es/desalambre/pagado-fondos-publicos-frente-melilla_0_316369381.html ) article ( in spanish ) . 
  / r/europe 's [ post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/tb/2k2u0u ) . 
  this could have been a south africa joke somehow . 
  how is it technically correct ? 
  edit : if you 're talking about the name , that is . 
  if you rotate it 90 \u00b0 it is now a taller rectangle . 
  you ca n't explain that . 
  i know some of those names , they even reddit , and you 're saying that 's a pug ? 
  i wish i had those kind of pugs . 
  i have the complete opposite notion , from mmorpgs i used to play years ago , where you 'd have to pick a group close to a meeting point ... 
  it really seemed like he had goddamn great luck to find such good players . 
  that , and he 's also good . 
  definitely bought the game last week , can confirm . 
  if i 'm reading it correctly , the building looks great but it pales immensely in the phone 's screen . 
  i think it 's a critic on how everyone seems to try and take out a photo rather than enjoy the moment with their own eyes . 
  i 've already replaced jeeves . 
  i love sid . 
  as far as i know it charges faster , does more damage and jumps farther . 
  so you 're saying there are few people in game modes that are n't popular right after a new gargantuan and very interesting game mode was introduced ? 
  sid also keeps it warm with the blood and flesh of my enemies . 
  pilot :, 
  * smart pistol with extended magazine, 
  * arc grenade, 
  * mag launcher, 
  * quick reload, 
  * warpfall transmitter, 
  * atlas, 
  * quad rocket with extended magazine, 
  * electric smoke, 
  * nuclear ejection, 
  * core extender, 
  the only thing i 'm not sure what could be better is warpfall transmitter , but my loadout is based on killing as many minions as fast as i can , which helps building up titan core ability to wipe out titans asap . 
  and nuke them if needed . 
  til the english language actually has the letter '' \u00e7 '' , even if it comes from an imported word . 
  not sure which one of the two i liked the most , that first four kill grenade or the arc cannon jumps ... 
  ... wait , that was his name ? 
  i thought he was saying something like ` bimbo ' to ridicule the fucker . 
  loved it , you can do great things with that gun !, 
  and loved the music too , lindsey stirling is always great . 
  heh , my real name 's in the game . 
  well , the brazillian version of it , but still !, 
  i think freeland is a nice name for a country that started out as a giant prison of sorts . 
  where is it from ? 
  cool , nice job !, 
  [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/portugal/wiki/lisbon ) 's some helpful reading by several redditors . 
  if you want to do alfama on foot , i could guide you around for a few hours if i find the time during the week . 
  also , night life is much better by the end of the week , i suggest you try out bairro alto by then if you 're still around !, 
  finally , my personal rule of thumb for great food experience : the shitter a place looks , the better the food . 
  are you serious ?
