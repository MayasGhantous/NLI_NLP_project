  should i care about vram for the future ? 
  i was thinking about only upgrading 3 years from now , will the effectively 3.5 gigs be enough by then even for 1080p ? 
  should i care about vram for the future ? 
  i was thinking about only upgrading 3 years from now , will the effectively 3.5 gigs be enough by then even for 1080p ? 
  and what would you say about the 970 vs 390 for 1080p gaming considering the amd card is 20 $ more expensive than the nvidia one ? 
  yeah i do that with my brother , im connected through ethernet and he uses wireless ... 
  what would be the best one ? 
  the gaming , strix or g1 ? 
  whats the difference between 2x4 gb of ram and one 8gb stick ? 
  is the 390 better than the 970 at 1080p ? 
  i cant find any benchmarks for that amd card : /, 
  oh ok thanks . 
  but i know that the amd card consumes more energy . 
  do you think a 550w psu would be enough to handle an i5 4690k and the r9 390 ? 
  how about when i eventually overclock it ? 
  acording to the intel website the 4690k should be consuming an average of 88w at base speed and the 390 is around 210w . 
  with all the other components that should go up to about 400w maybe ? 
  what would be the power consumption when i overclock it ? 
  i 'll just go for the 970 . 
  im already buying a mobo that supports sli so if i ever feel the need to upgrade i can just get another 970, 
  that makes sense and i actually found out that getting 2x4 is cheaper than a single 8gb thanks to a kingston promotion that is happening in the store i will buy my components from, 
  why going for a z97 if you ca n't overclock the cpu ? 
  i went to check the board 's specs and you actually cant sli , only crossfire . 
  i think the advantage of being able to upgrade to an overclockable cpu is worth it though , specially if it is the same price as an h97, 
  yeah , thats my problem right now . 
  would a 550w psu be enough for the 390 and an i5 4690k ? 
  would an i5 4690k run fine without an aftermarket cooler if im not overclocking it ? 
  im thinking about getting this cpu but only get the cooler when i overclock it in a few months or maybe even years from now, 
  what will sli do for you may i ask ? 
  i 'm building my pc now and im going with a mobo that supports it but honestly i do n't know what advantages there is to it since de vram will be the same if i go for the 970 ( 3.5 gb ) ... 
  but it should give me no problem right ? 
  and once i consider overclocking it then i can go and grab a cooler ? 
  will a 550w psu be enough to run an r9 390 and overclock an i5 4690k ? 
  yeah when i overclock i will get one for sure, 
  are the corsair vs psus any good ? 
  they are not 80 + and im afraid to get one . . 
  i 'll avoid it . 
  xfx is good though right ? 
  yeah , i will go with an 80 + xfx 650 psu then , thanks for the help !, 
  xfx ts 650w 80 + bronze and im buying from portugal , the store is globaldata . 
  the r9 390 would like to have a word with you , sir . 
  i would argue the 390 is worth it for 1080p too . 
  im getting one with my build and it gives me a great cheap option for crossfire, 
  yeah , i agree . 
  its free if you are a student, 
  yeah well im going to build a pc this summer . 
  this is how my build started in mid june :, 
  mobo h97 pc mate, 
  gtx 960, 
  430w psu, 
  120 $ asus monitor, 
  what im actually going to buy next week when i go out to get the parts :, 
  i5 4690k, 
  650w psu, 
  my wallet cries . 
  well it depends on the agreements with each school or university , i would recommend you checking out if the school/uni you go to has it before celebrating haha, 
  im getting all my parts next week . 
  as a first time builder what do i need know ? 
  how to get good cable management ? 
  does the cpu come with the cooler installed or will i need to install it myself ? 
  and how do you guys install the os ? 
  is it through a cd or a pen or something else ? 
  thanks !, 
  is there any downside in getting an intel cpu with an amd card instead of both amd card and amd cpu ? 
  the r9 390 should do a fine job as well, 
  thanks for the help !, 
  i 'm thinking about asking in the store for them to put the cpu in the socket for me , it 's a free service that they do and i think i will not risk it . 
  would i need to buy any thermal paste to install the cooler ? 
  i 'm going to install windows 8 . 
  what is the type of file that i need to have in the cd ? 
  do i just download directly from the website and use that ? 
  do n't i need to go to the bios to tell it to start the booting from the cd drive ? 
  yeah i know but since thats the most delicate part of the build i think i wo n't risk it and i will ask them to do it since it 's free . 
  thanks . 
  when i get an aftermarket cooler later would you recommend changing the thermal paste ? 
  i 'll just buy both things there , ask them to put the cpu on the socket , store the mobo on it 's box and bring it home with the rest of the components , i wo n't go to the store on purpose to get it done . 
  that cooler is regarded as one of the best for its price . 
  everything looks great , but since you said you have 1500 available i would push it and try to fit a 980ti in there cause thats the best value for money high end card right now . 
  i would get an r9 390 if they are the same price or cheaper than the 970 . 
  also i dont really trust the corsair cx psu as ive read a lot of bad things happening to them so i would push for a better one . 
  other than that i would try to get an ips monitor if you can find one at that price . 
  can you elaborate on why choosing the 290x over a 390 ? 
  i said that because im going to get the 390 and i thought that maybe the 290 was better and i didnt know !, 
  is your brother planning on overclocking ? 
  if not the money you save from getting an i5 4460 and the consequent loss of cpu cooler cab give you money to upgrade to a gtx 970 or an r9 390 which would seriously improve his gaming experience . 
  you can also cut on the ram as 8gb are enough as long as he is not doing heavy rendering and editing and stuff . 
  so you do n't actually try free to play games , you just ditch them as soon as you see the free to play tag attached to them ? 
  he said that he can go up to 1800 so if he wants to he can fit a gtx980ti in there or just an r9 390x, 
  true , you are absolutly right . 
  you can drop that cooler as you are not overclocking so it wont be needed . 
  the same applies to the thermal paste , the cpu already has it . 
  with the 30 bucks you save from that and what is left from your budget i would advise you to get an ssd or get a better gpu like a gtx 970 or an r9 390, 
  dota 2 , tf 2 , warframe , path of exile , hearthstone ... 
  altough i agree that there is a lot of shit on the market the good free to play models show that its not just bait and switch and that is a broad generalization . 
  the i7 has 8 cores instead of the 4 cores used by the i5 . 
  the i7 is also much stronger in multi threading which helps cpu intensive tasks such has video or image editing , rendering , programs like photoshop and that kinda shit . 
  however , for gaming , the single core processing speed of the i5 is more than enough . 
  or at least it 's what i 've been reading for the past 3 weeks while i 've been trying to get my build done . 
  i have a couple questions for you guys, 
  - how much difference would a modular psu make as a first time builder ?
