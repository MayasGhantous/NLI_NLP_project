  obligatory we fuckin did it reddit, 
  you know why ? 
  yeah , the thing is that , i do n't really know much about sweden so i had no idea if 4k is that much or not . 
  as i 'm reading your comments now i understand that it is a lot . 
  i 'm gon na let her know that she has to make sure what they are offering her and for what exactly . 
  thanks, 
  by the way what do you mean by the working conditions ? 
  as in the working conditions for nurses are overall quite shitty because of time tables and such or that in sweden specifically the work conditions are not very good ? 
  yeah i have to let her know that it is indeed too much and she has to go find more information on the offer , to make sure what she is getting into in case she actually wants it . 
  electrical engineering is my field . 
  things here in portugal are not that good on that side either even though it is one of the professions with the most market . 
  haha thanks !, 
  is that enough to live with in southern sweden ? 
  as i said i assume housing is cheaper there than in stockholm but what about food , bills and such ? 
  hmm okay , i will try and search a bit more information on it . 
  and let 's assume for a moment that thats a lie and what she would actually be offered is the 2500-3000 $ nurses usually receive there according to you guys , would that also let her live nicely there ?

  w0t ? 
  it 's still a huge waste of money but you are right , each one does whatever he wants with his own money, 
  yeah those fuckin idiots who come into a `` god spray from friberg '' video actually expecting a god spray from friberg , what a bunch of clowns amirite ? 
  i ca n't even get through the campaign in normal without getting my ass wooped . 
  any tips to a guy who is new to the genre ? 
  i 'm not even sure what im supposed to be building , if im supposed to build at all or what to build in what situation . 
  it might be one of the least loved guns but it 's the one i have the most skins of !, 
  the good old announcement of the announcement, 
  anele, 
  do you know how long this free access is and if it is available for someone that already tried the free star citizen module that was available back in october ? 
  he is comparing sc to other mmos which is the fair comparison . 
  mmos actually have complex mechanics that have to be carefully balanced and worlds that are ... well massive . 
  its funny that you even list star wars battlefront as taking `` only 2 years ! '', 
  to develop when the main complaint about that game is that its so shallow in content and depth that it gets old after 5 hours . 
  its like they took 2 years painting a beautiful picture and thats it . 
  i kinda feel like i just read the description of insurgency . 
  anyone know what the main differences are ? 
  yeah , i think i get it . 
  it 's a bit of a blend between red orchestra , insurgency and arma maybe ? 
  and i guess you go and cap points or hold points by deploying those fob 's and vehicles to push etc right thus the crucial squad coordination ? 
  that looks like a lot of fun for me , im a shooter guy and i already love insrugency , arma and red orchestra . 
  not sure if you are being sarcastic , but it is for sure . 
  otherwise flicks would be muscle memory and therefor not skill . 
   + 8 % spell damage, 
  we league of lesbians now, 
  this is something i actually thought was what devs were always looking for , the perfect patch . 
  when i started playing dota i believed that this utopian patch was what icefrog was looking to get , small balance after small balance . 
  but i eventually understood that it actually does n't matter , the patches are here to keep the game fresh . 
  although i completly agree with you that 6.85 was a great balanced patch the way to keep you coming back to the game without getting bored is to release new patches , just fuck up a couple of things , reinvent a couple heroes and give players something new to play . 
  i actually love the way icefrog does it too , he is not afraid of changing heroes in big ways . 
  it 's literally been an hour . 
  it 's not even enough time to play 2 full games on the test branch , how would you know what works and what does n't to have an opinion formed so early ? 
  im a bit late to the party but i wan na throw this in here because god knows how frustrated i feel that this is not teached throughout the 12 years of obligatory school i had and all kids have to go in my country . 
  disclaimer : i have no idea how it works in the us ( from where most of you are ) , but here you have the basic subjects until the 9th grade . 
  on the 10th you have to choose one of 4 courses : sciences and technologies , visual arts , languages and psychology or economy . 
  1 - i have no fucking idea why ** economics and basic finances ** are not teached from the first grade . 
  simple shit like knowing that you should n't spend more than you have otherwise you create a debt . 
  not only is it hugely important no matter what you will do professionally but its also a good way to apply math in the real world , something a lot of kids struggle to relate . 
  on top of that you dont actually have an economy specific subject throughout those 9 years of basic school , i have no idea how you are supposed to choose the economy course on the 10th grade if you have no background on it . 
  2 - ** programming ** , specially in the sciences and technologies area . 
  its essential to any engineer ( the course people go to the most after following that area ) to know how to program , everything is becoming autonomous and the people who can create the machines are the people with guaranteed future . 
  not just that , but even people who dont go on to be engineers will need fast thinking and an ability to quickly solve problems whether they are in the biology , chemistry , whatever area . 
  thats what programming helps you do , with simple things like ifs and cycles and all that stuff , you create something with a function out of the tools you are given . 
  those are my 2 cents . 
  honestly how can you play dota and say this ? 
  its a team game . 
  if you know your team , your callouts , their strenghts and their weaknesses you are going to get better results than getting put in a team with 4 other strangers whose gameplay characteristics you know nothing about . 
  thats why ranked mmr is there . 
  oh you 're suggesting like a team mmr ? 
  where you always play with the same guys ? 
  well yeah but i think that would be something that online tournments could fill . 
  maybe have valve organized tournments in client where you can only participate with your pre-made team which have an mmr that would only improve when the team played together ? 
  that would be cool . 
  but i also value playing solo , thats why i agree with a solo queue . 
  there 's some merit in getting matched with four strangers and work your way to victory . 
  yeah i have to give it to you , i always considered party mmr as a full 5 man stack because thats usually what i do , but playing as just 2 or 3 might not be a good indicative of your ranking . 
  if someone has a spare key i would really appreciate , thanks !, 
  do we activate those on steam ? 
  i used that !, 
  thank you so much !, 
  good shit go\u0c66\u0501 shit thats \u2714 some good shit right th ere right \u2714 there \u2714 \u2714 if i do \u01bda\u04af so my sel\uff46 i say so thats what im talking about right there right there mmmmm\u13b7\u041c \u041do0\u041e\u0b20\uff2foo\uff2fo\u041e\u0b20\u0b20oooo\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52 good shit, 
  his ass . 
  i also wonder how the hell a thread praising a cast turns into a another shit `` lol is so bad gaem lol lmao xdxd '' discussion . 
  just play your fucking game and shut the fuck up, 
  rocket league too , i might buy a pack of 4 for my friends as well if i have the money . 
  other than that i do n't think rainbow 6 siege is getting any discount but i 'm really impressed by it and i hope it can keep the playerbase alive until a good discount that makes me pick it up . 
  rekt, 
  it 's the standard and the games you can compare it too . 
  cs : go has as much or more replayability than r6 and it costs 1/5th of the price . 
  same with mobas , they are free to play and they live off the replayability . 
  the problem is when you create a multiplayer only game you better have good core mechanics that make it last and you better have a lot of players playing ... thats why most of the online games go for much lower prices or go the free 2 play route . 
  but with that said i surely enjoyed the game and i hope i can get it too for a lower price in a couple of months . 
  hopefully the community will still be going strong by then . 
  it 's literally what this sub is known for . 
  this is the place i come to to laugh a bit reading all the shitposts and memes . 
  i dont have a problem with this either , i actually come here for it but it strikes me as quite a hypocrite attitude to say that they are trying enforce that rule . 
  which one ? 
  you have to understand that im not specifically comparing game genres , just comparing multiplayer only games . 
  is n't it the scheduled tuesday maintenance ? 
  oh ok , it 's tuesday already over here in europe , i kinda thought it could be it . 
  i 'm pretty sure that according to enigma this is somehow the fault of the support for not buying wards . 
  there are skins in this game that can go up to several hundreds of dollars . 
  people in the `` real world '' have been arrested for stealing less than that .
