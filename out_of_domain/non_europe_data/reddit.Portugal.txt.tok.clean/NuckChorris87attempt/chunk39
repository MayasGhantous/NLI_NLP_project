  do n't illude yourself or anyone else into thinking that it 's fine because it 's a video game , it 's still stealing . 
  those games are not built in to work from microtransactions . 
  cs and dota only offer you skins that do not impact gameplay whatsoever but you can buy them if you like them . 
  its just like in rainbow 6 ( i believe ) with the difference being the price point . 
  i said cs had as much or more replayability but its arguable . 
  no idea why you guys took it to hearth this much . 
  but still cs is easy to get into and hard to master , thats why its so appealing . 
  the competitive map pool is probably as big as the maps released with r6 and after reading and wathing some vids i understood that the different spawm locations end up being the same one in ranked because its the best out of each map , its something ive seen pointed out in the forums as a flaw that i hope will get fixed . 
  one thing that is really good with the game costing 60 bucks is that there will hopefully be less cheaters . 
  thats about the only pro i can see to it, 
  oh yeah , that is true . 
  but i dont understand your point then . 
  surely there is a store in cs , dota , lol , etc but so there is in r6 . 
  i dont acually know if it is a store but something has to be there for you to buy the skins or whatever they are selling . 
  so again its the same as other multiplayer only titles with the difference being the price point of the actual game . 
  dont get me wrong , im not trying to bash on the game itself , i played a couple hours this weekend and it waa great but its incredibly hard to give 60 bucks for it when its competitors are much cheaper and already have big fan bases . 
  what ? 
  i lost my shit watching this, 
  yes , i 've tried all of that . 
  i still get the same problem . 
  i have an i5 4690k , 8gb of ram and an r9 390 . 
  specs should n't be a problem . 
  this happens in both my laptop and my desktop , i booted the laptop up right now to see if the same thing happened there and indeed it does . 
  if it is on my end it 's something related to the internet , but i 've restarted my router and nothing changed . 
  download connection speed : : 63807 kbps or 63.8 mbps, 
  yup , \u00e9 meo o isp . 
  those were my results , but i do n't really know what any of this means :,

  i will try that now , thank you . 
  only today ? 
  yeah it 's on my end then . 
  but it 's not the first time this happens to me . 
  it 's been okish for the past 3 months but during my last semestre between march and june this year this shit happened almost daily . 
  i 'm connected through ethernet though : /, 
  so fucking disgusting . 
  i love it . 
  yeah i might have to do that as this is for sure a problem with my isp . 
  people come to this thread and some of them only had this issue today with the exact same isp . 
  it 's just wierd that this is only happening with twitch . 
  i can watch videos on youtube at 1080p just fine , i can play with the same pings i had before , it 's just twitch that is absolutely unwatchable . 
  i can only have a stream on low and it stutters . 
  i can do everything else though . 
  no idea , but i 'll sure give em a call this week saying whats going on . 
  are you in lisbon ? 
  just trying to understand if it is restricted to a certain area . 
  will try , thanks !, 
  had you experienced these issues before ? 
  or was it just today ? 
  unfortunatly , trying to connect through a proxy did not work . 
  i used zenmate to do it with no success . 
  thanks for the help though !, 
  that makes sense . 
  if the problem persist i might get back to you so you can tell me exactly what you did and what you sent your isp so i can do the same . 
  hmm i unchecked everything on the installation other than the display driver and the sound driver . 
  am i fine like this ? 
  so playing online should be fine ? 
  as long as we are online already ? 
  yeah , i 'll stay loged in and keeping a close look at my email for login attempts from other pcs . 
  \u00c9 wireless ? 
  my pc has about the same specs ( the cpu is intel though which is slightly better for gaming and i have 8gb of ram only and a liquid cooler for the cpu ) and it cost me about 1400 $ with all the peripherals . 
  so if you know it has been treated well , i would say thats a good deal . 
  just take a look at it first . 
  i 'm gon na say again what i already said in a thread about this a while ago . 
  it 's not about the content it has , it 's about the standard other games that compete with it have already set . 
  cs : go is about the same idea and it costs 11 $ , 5 $ now that it is on sale . 
  dirty bomb is free to play , blacklight is free to play , insurgency is cheap as duck , etc. 
  it 's just hard for someone to go pay 60 bucks for a multiplayer only game when all of those alternatives are there . 
  on top of that it 's a game that is played really good with friends . 
  i can get my friends to play mobas , cs , rocket league , etc because they are cheap .
