  but the reward for that mission are two engineers - . - so i basically ca n't refuse that because i do n't have the money to buy a satelite to lower the panic level of that but i also ca n't get the money if i do it . 
  it 's a lose-lose situation all the time and that happened at least 3 out of the 4 runs i did so i assume it is something normal , a trade off that is `` built '' into the game ? 
  how should i go about that ? 
   there 's really no ` right order ' to research and build items . 
  some people might argue otherwise but , especially at the lower difficulty levels , it 's not super important . 
  allright , i 'll just do whatever suits the best of my needs . 
   i do n't know what you mean by ` recon ships ' . 
  are you talking about the interceptors you use to shoot down ufos ? 
  you 'll develop technology for them and will be able to build new weapons and ship types in time . 
  ship upgrades do n't really come into play during the first month or two of in-game time . 
  yeah that 's exactly what i mean . 
  it got to a point in one of my runs where i was researching so many upgrades to those planes that i thought i had to somehow install them . 
  but i did n't know how to do it and i still do n't . 
  are those not important ? 
  cause at that point i had to send the two ships to intercept an enemy ufo . 
   pick up the squad size upgrades from the officer training school asap . 
  these are probably the two most important upgrades in the game . 
  allright , gon na do that . 
  thanks for the help !, 
  do you watch a mcdonald 's commercial and go there the next day thinking that your burger will look just like the one that was showed on tv ? 
  why the fuck ca n't people understand that marketing is the same thing across all products and all companies ? 
  even witcher 3 got downgraded after e3 . 
  e3 is just a tech demo , it 's just for the sake of showing the best out of the best you could get out of your game . 
  what the hell are you running on that 2 cards in sli makes your performance quadruple ? 
  i was teaching a friend of mine yesterday and something i noticed is that a lot of the people who sunk a lot of hours but still miss the shots are people who go for where the ball is now instead of where it 's going to be when they reach it . 
  rocket league is a game of prediction , patience and precision , it 's not about fast reflexes ( most of the time ) . 
  you need to understand where the ball is going to be once you get to it , not where it is now . 
  it 's like playing chess or a strategy game , you make your play with the next play in mind . 
  once you grasp that and start hitting those basic shots consistently you get a free pass to at least silver 3 . 
  tell me one insntrumental song that is `` good '' by your standards, 
  that 's still electronic . 
  i thought you were going to post some classical stuff when you said you didnt enjoy deadmou5 because `` im over the age of 25 '' lol, 
  that 's some fuckin ignorance right there . 
  love you guys . 
  went ahead and bought all dlc as a thank you . 
  i see a lot of people saying they do n't like it . 
  why is that exactly ? 
  i 'm also one of the guys who do n't like wasteland but i wan na hear your opinions on why that is . 
  psyonix improved the performance on that map according to the patch notes , so i guess that does not serve as an excuse now . 
  i mean the graphics are great but the gameplay is terrible sometimes, 
  they added that option , it 's in the patch notes !, 
  you can just enable the quick chat and disable everything else . 
   but it actually made me uninstall the game . 
  the fuck, 
  a lot of people had performance issues with it . 
  those issues are supposed to be solved after the patch . 
  the thing is all the other arenas are rectangular and with an even floor . 
  wasteland has an elevated floor on the corners . 
  what happens is that a lot of the time you shoot the ball into a corner it will eventually go to the goal because of that inclination . 
  also because the floor is tilted the aerials are now diferent as sometimes you start lower and need more air time to reach the ball . 
  after being used to the regular arenas where the aerials and moves were always similar across them all it 's kinda hard for people to have to do things differently with such a core part of the gameplay to this arena in specific . 
  also a lot of people will use the `` it 's like the guys who only play dust 2 on cs '' but you have to keep in mind that in cs you can choose the maps you play on before entering a game . 
  here you ca n't really escape it , you will have to play it if you go for a ranked game . 
  sure , i understand both sides of the discussion . 
  but you also have to keep in mind that this is a game where perfection is reached after hundreds of hours of playtime . 
  when you change the map layout in a way that the core moves you used to do get affected , it really takes it 's toll on the gameplay . 
  on one hand it 's a breath of fresh air on ranked matchmaking with something new to improve on , but on the other it 's something that directly affects the way you 've always been playing . 
  i guess it 's kinda the same as knowing the different map layouts in cs , but im actually not comfortable with that comparison after playing both games . 
  i agree mostly with the second point . 
  the curved floor makes it so that the ball naturally goes to the goal when you try to cross it by shooting at the corners of the arena . 
  it really frustrates me . 
  the other thing is that all the aerial timings that you had to practice for hours and hours before go a bit to waste as now they are different , because you can start your jump from lower and need more air time to reach the ball . 
  anyway i think it 's up to us to adapt to it and learn from it . 
  it 's a breath of fresh air , let 's see how it pans out . 
  woah dude calm down . 
  baby steps , one at a time . 
  it 's stamped on the box of every 900 series, 
  the thing is amd cards have ace 's , which is what allows them to have that better async computing . 
  as i understand after having read about it , ace 's basically manage the flow of data through the pipelines , they are able to prioritize certain tasks and they overall increase the processing capability of the unit . 
  the thing is i believe there is an ace in each pipeline , so the async computing that is managed in these units is derectly related to the data buses they come from . 
  more data buses means more information can be processed at the `` same '' time . 
  as far as i understand the maxwell architecture only has 2 main pipelines but a 390 for example has at least 8 ace 's , so 8 pipelines ? 
  so in the end this is kinda related to software , therefor better drivers should mean better performance but there is only so much you can do software-wise when you have so few pipelines to receive and send information through . 
  i may or may not be right . 
  this is what i understood after reading a lot of articles about the subject . 
  the manual transmission is coming to console . 
   for those players on console we can also confirm that manual transmission will be making its way to both playstation 4 and xbox one . 
  keep an eye on official channels for future updates . 
  did n't we have a flag and an antenna from the beggining though ? 
  it 's the rocket labs option on the unranked queue . 
  hi jonathan and team , thanks for doing this ama !, 
  i would like to know from any of you what are some the top missconceptions about gaming development that you read/hear from browsing forums and from the gamers in general . 
  also , a question to lu\u00eds ant\u00f3nio but this one in the most beautiful language in the world : a ind\u00fastria de videojogos em portugal tem futuro ? 
  ( translation : does the videogame industry have a future in portugal ? 
  specially when all the media outlets push the stigma that videogames are for kids ) . 
  good luck in your future endeavors !, 
   being able to find investors that believe in the medium and want to do something more than money, 
  exactly , but then again thats a problem that goes well beyond the videogame industry here in portugal . 
  even the ones who want to make money ca n't . 
  it 's just that the industry in general is so bad right now that it 's really though to think about these small niches that on top of that are essentially being bullied by the media . 
  i do hope we get a brighter future , but it 's looking though , specially when all the people with the ideas and motivation are simply leaving the country . 
  anytime you get tired of this english language make sure to visit us over at / r/portugal !, 
  thanks for the answer !,
