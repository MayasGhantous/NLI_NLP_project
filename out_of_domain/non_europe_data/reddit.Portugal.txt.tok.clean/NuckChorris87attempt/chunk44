  * ** requirements for isolation ** : i guess the most isolation the better . 
  * ** will you be using these headphones in public ? 
  ** yes . 
  * ** preferred type of headphone ** : closed , over the ear . 
  * ** preferred tonal balance ** : not really sure , maybe someone can pick the best one based of my prefered music to listen to, 
  * ** past headphones ** : apple , akg , wesc and some others that i 've lost track of, 
  * ** preferred music ** : i listen to literally everything i put my hands on and enjoy a lot of it , but i mostly listen to prog rock and prog metal , , post rock , hard rock , metal in general , instrumental rock ( my fav genre ) , etc , so a lot of ambient sounds and sustained notes paired with a heavy sound of high distortion basically . 
  * ** location ** : europe - portugal, 
  i will also use the headphones while gaming on pc , not sure if it influences the choice though . 
  not looking for a headset , i really just want the headphones . 
  but anyone who wants to can get win 10 for free as an upgrade from 7/8 . 
  i do n't really know why they are doing this but it is great . 
  now if they improve the store to be as good as steam/origin that will be even better . 
  i have n't used it , but a lot of people say that there are some huge issues with it . 
  yeah i was actually looking for an immediate financial reason for them to do this but i failed to realise that they already made lots of money with these franchises on console , having the trouble of porting them to pc is only gon na give gamers a good reason to upgrade to 10 . 
  makes sense and is in line with ms 's last trend of pushing windows 10 to only have one platform to worry about . 
  the point of the store still stands though . 
  i made a post yesterday on the daily thread but got no responses so i 'm gon na keep it simple :, 
  i need a set of headphones that sit over hear to use to listen to music while studying or when i feel like it and also to use on my desktop pc . 
  i kinda needed something that can be packed easily in my backpack with my computer that would still be comfortable and durable , with a strong wire . 
  i was looking at the audio-technica m20x and the sj55 , but what i actually wanted was an hybrid between both , with the over the ear design and thoughness from the m20x but the flexibility and easy to pack functions of the sj55 . 
  thanks in advance for any tip !, 
  thanks for the suggestion !, 
  my only gripe with them is the head band not being protected , cause i use my headphones a lot and i 'm a little worried it might end up being a bit uncomfortable . 
  other than that there 's only the problem that i ca n't seem to find the hm2 or any other brainwavz 's headphones for sale on european amazon , only the hm9 . 
  yeah the hm9 are definitely out of question , they are just too expensive unfortunately . 
  i think i will go with the audio-technica m20x , again the m50x is just way out of budget , i do n't have that much money to spend on headphones even though i use them a lot daily . 
  i do n't know , i just watched a review saying that the m20x are a bit uncomfortable and the sound is not that great . 
  i 'll keep looking for alternatives . 
  holy shit she really does, 
  for some reason whenever i click the hm2 on that website i get an error . 
  tried in 3 devices already and it always happens , really weird . 
  i do n't know man , i really need some advice . 
  some days i 'll wear my headphones for like 10 hours , whenever i have classes i 'll use them at least 4 hours a day at the university so it is really important that they are good . 
  i might end up dropping the ball on something better but im not sure yet . 
  i think ( im not sure ) that the 14nm chips will be coming in this gen and that they will have a much better performance/power ratio , according to what i 've been reading from amd . 
  the thing is i 've always been picky about headphones but i never actually looked into it as a place where i would put my money on . 
  but i use them a lot , i love music , i play the guitar so sound means the world to me . 
  money is tight , yeah , like i 'm not poor at all , but i simply ca n't afford a 200 $ set of headphones , i just ca n't . 
  i guess i 'm just trying to get the best bang out of my money and according to what i 've been reading that sweet sweet spot lies with the m50x . 
  but then again all the reviews and things i read always seem to studio focused , there is not much out there for someone who wants to listen to music and use the headphones on the pc , cause thats what im really trying to find , the do-it-all with good quality headphones . 
  i totally see why you are into this hobby , i fell in love with the meze 73 after finding out about them , there are some amazing headphones out there . 
  na \u00e1rea de tele ou mais virado para web development como no teu part-time ? 
  hey guys . 
  i 've been trying to find some good headphones for my needs over the past few days and already posted in two of this threads . 
  / u/swordknight really helped me out in understanding a bit more of this hobby of yours and after reading a lot of reviews i think i have an idea of what i want . 
  since i will use the headphones to listen to music and game ( maybe mixing music eventually as i play the guitar , but thats further down the line as i have no mic yet ) they need to have a good trusty sound but they also need to be potable . 
  so / u/swordknight suggested the brainwavz hm2 . 
  right now i 'm torn between those , the creative aurvana live or just waiting a bit more to get more money and get a brainwavz hm5 or hm9 . 
  the thing is there are not a lot of reviews on the brainwavz on the internet , when they compare heaphones they never include those . 
  sorry for the long post but i need your guys opinions on whats the best bang for my buck . 
  i guess i 'm willing to go up to 100 $ . 
  between the brainwavz or the creative , which should i get ? 
  or should i go for something like audio-technica ? 
  thanks in advance !, 
  yeah the k701 's are around 185 $ in eu : /, 
  well as i said i 've been reading a lot about headphones and as far as i understood an `` open back '' means that people around me can hear what i 'm listening to right ? 
  cause i will be using them while studying on the university and i wanted something that kept the sound to me . 
  also what do you mean by `` diminishing returns '' ? 
  and another thing : why is that the brainwavz seem to go so under the radar ? 
  and between the hm5 and hm9 i was thinking about the hm9 because they are selling at 110 $ on amazon and appearently they fold and become very compact , the ideal to have them in my bag with me . 
  i read that the m40 's are a bit uncomfortable . 
  you think that between the hm5 and the m40 's , the m40 's are better ? 
  yeah that 's what i thought too after reading on them . 
  the hm9 however are foldable , so that makes packing a lot easier and they go for about the same price as the m40x ( 15 $ more on the hm9 ) . 
  yeah , thanks , that was actually something i did not know , the price point of the best bang for the buck . 
  you seem to think it 's in the 250 $ area and a lot of the videos i 've watched and reviews i 've read also put the headphones in those price ranges as the best out there ( bose , beyerdynamics , at , senn , etc ) . 
  i ca n't really spend that money though , i do n't have it haha my current akg are literally falling apart and i really need new ones . 
  i guess i 'm just being too picky , i think i will just choose what seems to suit me best and go with it , it 's not like i know how a 500 $ set of headphones sound to compare it to whatever i will get so it does n't really matter as long as i get something comfy i guess . 
  1080p with an i5 4690k, 
  my cpu is constantly on 95-100 % usage and gpu on the outside areas sometimes goes as low as 35 % . 
  i 've never seen my gpu go over 70 % . 
  maybe i need to oc my 4690k a bit , but it was just a beta and i highly doubt i 'll even get the game , so no point now . 
  my cpu is always on 90 % as well , the problem is the gpu which sometimes goes down to 30-35 % on areas where i 'm getting 35 fps . 
  i do n't even understand if it is an optimization issue or if my cpu is bottlenecking my gpu , which i highly doubt . 
  that 's exactly what i 'm talking about , the difference is abysmal . 
  i 'm at 1080p on medium-high and i get 50 fps sometimes , but most of the time i was running on 35-45 . 
  makes no sense , i started to wonder if it was anything with my maching that was not ok . 
  i wo n't be able to try anything else as the beta already ended but were any of your parts oc 'd ? 
  i5 4690k , stock clock . 
  oh no , i 'm not upgrading , thats for sure . 
  i bought my whole rig like 7 months ago , no way i have the money to upgrade anything whatsoever . 
  i just find it weird that a 4690k would bottleneck . 
  i have an aio cooling unit , but the beta is over and i do n't know if i will even buy the game , so i guess i 'll just wait out and if i have any problems in other games i will oc it a bit . 
  i did n't , no . 
  i do n't know either , i play bf4 on ultra with 80 + fps , on the best maps it goes up to 110 . 
  i 'm just worried that it is something with my system , i find it weird that a lot of people get good performance but i ca n't get it to a stable 60 without turning everything to low . 
  is there anything better than the brainwavz hm9 at that price point for the portablity , comfort and sound that they offer ? 
  hey man , not op but how are those dt770 's in terms of portability ? 
  i am about to get a new pair of headphones but i 've been really torn over the past weeks between some at 's and brainwavz and now the beyerdynamics , so im kinda looking for some insight from someone more into this hobby . 
  i 'm sorry , can you tell me the difference between the pro and premium version ? 
  thanks !, 
  thanks , i understand it now . 
  but one thing that i still do n't get is the difference in impedance from each one . 
  does having lower impedance ( lower ohms ) mean it 's better ? 
  i would assume higher impedance just makes it so smaller devices ( mp4 's ) would n't have the power needed for it to fully function but does that mean better sound ? 
  sorry , i 'm new to this headphones business and as i said i 'm just looking for a good set to get for the first time as all i have bought until now were crappy ones . 
  i know it is a joke but he is actually saying `` injusti\u00e7a '' , which the portuguese say when something is not fair . 
  im gon na ride the secrekt fangay train until their next stop at disband city . 
  there they will pick their new passengers :,
