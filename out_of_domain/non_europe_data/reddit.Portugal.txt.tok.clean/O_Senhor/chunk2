  i sold my photo gear , this is only achieved with a sigma 800mm . 
  xl a `` normal-sized woman '' , nop , sorry . 
  no . . i ref . . no . 
  we do n't have uo where i live but bought some stuff in amsterdam and it 's pretty good . 
  btw , in nl almost everything is shitlord-approved . 
  i used to be bmi 25 ( 1,82 m/83kg ) ~ 11 years ago , now i 'm bmi 22 ( 1,82 m/73kg ) . 
  lost 10kg just using logic ( eating less + eating healthier ) . 
  i was studying food engineering and the stuff i learned was a * click * for me . 
  i 'm completely anti- `` science bullshit '' , and that 's mostly why i 'm here . 
  a nice bokeh and you would only see the buttons , perfect . 
  you can eat one 1 $ burguer all meals and still be on caloric deficit . 
  but if you eat 3 . . 
  reek , reek , it rhymes with freak !, 
  i love to eat a north portuguese food called `` francesinha '' , [ it 's fucking hardcore , a caloric bomb ] ( https://www.google.pt/search?q=francesinha&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=vs9bvlm2mc-oyascpidacq&amp;ved=0cayq_auoaq#imgdii=_ ) . 
  found a recipe in english : http://www.food.com/recipe/francesinha-super-indulgent-portuguese-sandwich-370897, 
  usually i go to a restaurant with some friends , some of them are fat and we all eat this and have some beers . 
  we all struggle to finish , and some times i end first . 
  everyone stares in disbelief , every-fuckin-time . 
  the secret is simple , i do it like once a month . 
  genghis khan would be proud !, 
  a mexican moustache . 
  just do compensate the shitladies in our sub , this calendar was made by portuguese firefighters from set\u00fabal ( for charity purposes ) . 
  done !, 
  no words can describe this photo . 
  i do n't see 1 thing in there that i would have bought . 
  a it is !!, 
  `` francesinha '' means `` little french girl '' and it 's an adaptation of the french dish croque-monsieur . 
  it originated on oporto after the return of a portuguese emigrant in france . 
  amsterdam is shitlord heaven !, 
  :d everybody riding bikes and all the tall and fit/normal people . 
  one of my fav european city . 
  that 's one of the reasons i 'm here . 
  preparing for what 's to come . 
  this is pretty much my experience in portugal . 
  when the iphone came out i had a smartphone ( sony ericsson p1i ) already . 
  most symbian and blackberry users moved to android devices . 
  i tend to find that iphone users are mostly a ) girls and b ) old business people ( i worked with a ceo that had 3 iphones and an ipad . . only for calling and e-mailing ) . 
  here i see a lot of people using `` new brands '' ( mostly chinese ) like wiko , bq , huawei , xiaomi . 
  humm , in china the big thing right now is xiaomi ( `` their take '' on the iphone - mi3 and mi4 ) . 
  here , have a cheeseburguer . 
  wtf is wrong with this sub nowadays . 
  you are a rower , i 'm a rower , everybody is a rower !, 
  i read the sidebar and the rules but ca n't find the info about being approved . 
  instead of downvoting , maybe some help ? 
  forget , it 's the fatty brigade . 
  thanks for the info best mod . 
  ^ ^ was i supposed to read that in the sidebar ? 
  because it does n't appear here . 
  i only shame the people i care for . 
  it may sound strange , but those are the only ones i intend to help if they really want to lose some weight . 
  the others only get my best contempt face . 
  this is an article worth spreading . 
  i think i have a natural asshole-face . 
  it 's that damned adenine !!, 
  that bitch binds with sugar to move energy to the cells and i get fat !, 
  a fucking conspiracy i tell you guys !, 
  ** eli10 ** : adenine is one of dna nucleotides . 
  as atp ( adenosine triphosphate that prokaryotes and eukaryotes use to move energy for cell functions ) it binds with a simple sugar ( ribose ) and phosphate groups . 
  all cells temporarily store energy as atp . 
  saving ryan 's privates !, 
  this . 
  adding only that some of those bacterias ( acetic bacterias ) need the ethanol from the yest fermentation to get energy ( acetic fermentation ) and when they do that , acetic acid ( vinegar ) is the resulting product . 
  that explains the taste in spoiled beer and wine . 
  phagocytosis . 
  macrophages do that . 
  they usually even respond different ( how they degrade them ) if the bacteria are alive or dead . 
  not only they are bad at estimating , they do n't know the existence of the harris-benedict equation !, 
  microflora do n't just `` appear '' on obese people . 
  due to the food habits and hygiene the microflora in an adult obese gut have - instead of `` good '' bifidobacterium - a lot of pathogenic enterobacteriaceae and staphylococcus ( in some extreme obese , 35 % of all the microflora , it 's insane ) . 
  haes people . 
  i 'm doing the same in science related subs . 
  `` what is it in peoples genetic makeup that makes things like weight problems hereditary ? '', 
  yesterday on eli5 had great comments . 
   `` being overweight does n't run in families . 
  nothing runs in those families , that 's the problem ! '', 
  odeith is a portuguese artist , maybe he was painting in br . 
  no way , the chargers are 5v !, 
  some of them 0.700 ~ 1a . 
  try using one with 1.2 ~ 1.8 a. 
  lisboan i believe . 
  `` lisboeta '' in portuguese . 
  nineteen eighty-four by george orwell . 
  maybe trying not to think about sex . . teenager right ? 
  me neither . 
  do n't do it with music or you will end hating every single one . 
  i do it with a calm ringtone , another calm ringtone and the last one , the worst ringtone in the mobile phone . 
  unreal tournament ( yes , the one from ' 99 , goty ) . 
  online leagues/championships . 
  hardcore training . 
  lan tournaments . 
  being a fucking beast in a game . 
  i miss those years . 
  i have to agree . 
  i 'm bias because i played it for some years and still play when i can . 
  but nothing beats a final . 
  the shots , stamina , concentration . . 
  it 's impressive . 
  that 's unfortunate , i dislocated the shoulder twice during trainings ( service ) . 
  portuguese ? 
  algarve , portugal,
