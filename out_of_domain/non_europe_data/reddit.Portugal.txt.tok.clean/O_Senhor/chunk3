  ** pros ** : some of the best beaches in the world ; some of the best golf courses ; very cheap cost of living ; some of the best food in the world . 
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebg4m--olsu, 
  ** cons ** : almost no events during the year ( concerts , sports , galleries , etc. 
  ) , awful transport system and high unemployment rates . 
  * no added sugar, 
  * no white bread, 
  * no milk/dairy, 
  * little to no processed food, 
  * drink a lot of water, 
  change one of your meals per day to a soup or salad . 
  do it yourself , buy some fresh ingredients ( vegetables , herbs ) !, 
  give yourself time to love healthy food . 
  healthy does n't mean tasteless !, 
  take a look at those recipes :, 
   http://www.mangi.pt, 
  and it usually has too much sodium in it . 
  i have to concur with everything said except for starvation mode , that 's a proven myth . 
  but yeah , do n't starve yourself , that 's something plain stupid to do . 
  if you drink a lot of soda , changing it for water has a great overall impact . 
  no fuerte in europe ? 
  one of the best fuertes in the world is pro fluke from the uk . . 
   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mvudymr3vi, 
  did the same search !, 
  country , cities , `` state '' . 
  all good !, 
  a lot of foreigners that come here ( south of portugal ) eat at chinese/indian/fast food instead of looking for local food . 
  never understood why . 
  i believe the vast majority ( british ) do that because they do n't have a local cuisine or so many `` national dishes '' i believe . 
  oohh , that 's why there 's the expression `` do n't feed the troll '' !, 
  not that slow clap . 
  most average people can search google and read books . 
  the problem is that they probably have to change their habits . 
  people are n't good at accepting change . 
  those who are , are shitlords . 
  sorry if truth hurts . 
  this creatures are the worst , they feed on excess food and they get a surplus from feeding on credulousness sad fats . 
  everyfuckingthing seems ( badly ) photoshopped . 
  guess the gender !, 
  ( because i ca n't ), 
  i have a name for this style : cowish . 
  not all bacteria can produce toxins but a great number of pathogenic bacteria do ( and you have bacteria like * e. coli * with different strains that produce different toxins ) . 
  the bacteria can produce endotoxins or exotoxins ( or both ) . 
  endotoxins are produced and stored on the bacteria cell wall , it `` works '' on contact or is released when the bacteria is destroyed . 
  exotoxins are released/secreted when produced . 
  exotoxins are usually more potent . 
  if you want to read more about some `` famous '' toxins , search for botulinum toxin ( from * clostridium botulinum * ) or shiga toxin ( from * shigella spp . * ) . 
  both are related with food poisoning . 
  it is n't legal , only if you are assuming that everyone lives in the us . 
  lobbying is an illegal activity in my country for instances . 
  you are wrong . 
  the article 44 of the charter of fundamental rights of the european union ensures the right to petition to the european parliament . 
  no , but i was confusing in a way . 
  lobbying is not a legislated , regulated and `` official '' activity in portugal . 
  so , in a certain way , it 's not legal . 
  i ca n't find info in english , sorry . 
  this . 
  still love you , but fix it !, 
  - dual monitor user . 
  dunno , so many fatties commenting . 
  and so many comments ( some mine ) deleted . . 
  i will end up getting banned or unsubscribing . 
  ahah , have you been to eastern europe ? 
  pretty and small !, 
  take a hug . 
  i 'm glad i 'm not fat and i 'm glad i 'm fit enough that i can surprise everyone when i start a new class . 
  i can see it in their eyes : `` an it teacher should n't be like this '' . 
  love it . 
  it 's not a big of an impact when i 'm teaching microbiology though . 
  i should check my privilege . 
  i find eatern europe people to be a lot more direct and sincere . 
  it 's a gem !, 
  it 's not rude , it 's direct , sincere help . 
  without sugar coating . 
  working out releases so many endorphins , it really helps fighting any sort of `` depression '' - like feelings . 
  and what you eat can affect your mood too . 
  avoiding added sugar helps prevent mood swings . . eating a lot of vegetables helps getting all the vitamins and minerals needed , a lot of micronutrientes can be beneficial . 
  especialmente dos algarves . 
  and i though gwcurvy ( * curvy * sigh ) was for this kind of shit . 
  give them 5 years !!! 11 !, 
  if it 's like that in denmark , imagine in portugal !, 
  it should n't be overlooked that we are talking about obesity (  30 bmi ) . 
  there are a lot of overweight people (  25 bmi ) in portugal for instances , but the obesity rate is under eu average but we have many overweight . 
  we should have another graph with overlapping columns with both obesity and overweight rate . 
  you can correct lockdown too , it was in portugal , not france . 
  he will be nervous wreck and he is not that good so . . yeah . 
  i 've tested with the same person both ps3 vs ps3 connected over ethernet and pc vs pc connected over ethernet . 
  ps3 has 1f input lag i believe ( after 15 min playing your brain adjusts ) and psn simply sucks . 
  pc version , in endless , with stables connections , is a great experience . 
  almost like playing offline . 
  if you are experiencing some kind of weird input lag just turn v-sync off , it happens with some graphic cards . 
  s\u00f3 li o primeiro , i see what you did there . 
  adding that you have bacteria with mobile dna segments that can carry genes for virulence and drug resistance to other bacteria . 
  it 's really an important deal but the sad truth is that you ca n't say anything against food industry . 
  ** edit ** : it 's not about the antibiotics in food , it 's about bacteria in animals that gain resistance and will sooner or later come in contact with humans . 
  most of the enteric bacteria can live in humans and other hot blood animals . 
  opportunist pathogens like * klebsiella * , * enterococcus * and * e. coli * will know when to strike .
