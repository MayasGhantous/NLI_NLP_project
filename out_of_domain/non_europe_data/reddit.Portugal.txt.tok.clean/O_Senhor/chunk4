  i 'm on eu and i do n't even accept invites anymore . . 
  it 's always like this : http://i.imgur.com/mzijqey.jpg, 
  i 'm portuguese , the other dude i do n't think so . 
  i 'm not exactly a teacher , but i teach daily ( i 'm an instructor on professional/technical schools ) . 
  one of the battles i fight is trying to change the shitty foods available on every bar . 
  and i 'm talking about portugal , not america . 
  but every bar in this organization ( run by the state ) only has sweets , chips , cakes and some fried pastel/croquette . 
  i was playing handlock . 
  you can not change others , you can only change yourself and lead by example . 
  with all the fungus , rotting is the right word . 
  i can help you with some vegetarian restaurants in the algarve , i think they will have some vegan dishes . 
   faro - [ gengibre e canela ] ( http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/restaurant_review-g189116-d1105945-reviews-gengibre_e_canela-faro_faro_district_algarve.html ), 
   loul\u00e9 - [ cantina dos sabores ] ( http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/restaurant_review-g189118-d3569247-reviews-cantina_dos_sabores-loule_faro_district_algarve.html ), 
  this two are worth visiting , the food is great there . 
  in quarteira you have [ vegetariano & companhia ] ( http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/restaurant_review-g580249-d6949674-reviews-vegetariano_companhia-quarteira_faro_district_algarve.html ) with good reviews , but i can not give you my personal opinion on that . 
  you can also find a lot of markets with fresh fruit and vegetables ( i recommend the market at loul\u00e9 on saturdays ) . 
   2 - algarve - head to the seaside in portugal , and if you look in particular at the old town you could find some good value there , or if you 're happy to spend a bit more money , go to vilamoura . 
  beautiful beaches and weather , the food is absolutely to die for in this stunning part of the world . 
  if you need any help planning your trip you can always drop by / r/algarve . 
  i knew a guy that got really fat in 2 ou 3 years , like a gainer , he lived to the crazy age of 40 . 
  i do n't know you , but i think i love you . 
  wowow , first time i meet a fellow tuga shitlord . 
  in portugal it 's pretty common to see `` daily menus '' that include the main dish , beverage , coffee and desert for 5/6 $ . 
  this is for those who have to eat out at lunch . 
  when it comes to fish it normally boosts to 9/10 $ . 
  but nothing beats fresh fish . 
  yesterday i was driving and had to lunch out , the restaurant had a lot of fresh fish to choose from . 
  i ate [ grilled cuttlefish ] ( http://www.restbolina.com/images/pratos/p1013944.jpg ) with salad and steamed vegetables , 1,5 l water bottle and a coffee - 10 $ . 
  in malls you can eat from the normal franchises , but usually there are 1 or 2 healthy ones , like [ vitaminas ] ( http://www.vitaminas.com.pt ) where a salad + natural juice is 8,5 $ . 
  when i have to go to mcd i eat a grilled big tasty with water and . . a soup ( 6 $ menu ) !, 
  in portugal we can change the fries in the menu to a ) salad or b ) soup . 
  no noodles or nasty looking soups , they are really good . 
  [ have a look ] ( https://www.mcdonalds.pt/ementa/categorias/sopas/ ) . 
  it 's not common to eat `` take out food '' everyday like in some countries , most of our meals are home made . 
  i can tell you guys that the `` eating out '' budget for my family ( of 2 ) is only about 200 $ / month . 
  of course things can get pretty expensive if you want to , and mostly , dinning out . 
  if you add wines and desserts things go easily up to 25 $ / person or 50 $ / person in a fancy restaurant . 
  shitlord checking in , just because .

  not really , uo in amsterdam has the same placement ( but , if i remember correctly , with snes ) . 
  the fat person will quit in 2 weeks because no diet was adjusted , sob in the corner and keep being fat . 
  the tattoos will keep looking like shit . 
  looking at the body i presumed a bmi between 20 ~ 21 , inside the normal range for normal people . 
  [ did some research ] ( http://healthyceleb.com/audrina-patridge-height-weight-body-statistics/4591 ) and found her height ( 171 cm ) and weight ( 57 kg ) , yap , bmi 19,5 . 
  ** normal ** !, 
  there are so many inherent characteristics that we see so clearly but they refuse to acknowledge . 
  no , you are not stigmatized and discriminated . 
  we are sure you are lazy , greedy/self-centered , unmotivated and , probably , dumb . 
  that 's way we do n't like you , that 's why we will never date a fat person . 
  when you feel stared at , please remember this .

  algarve in april can be great with good weather , but it can be really shitty in bad weather , since we do n't have that many cultural events/places to offer ( only if you really enjoy golf ) . 
  come back in july or september for a week , it 's worth it .

   if we 're not there already , i predict a day when company 's have groups of people in addition to their `` social media manager '' who go anonymous and vaguely reference how great the company is in anonymous posts . 
  i think they already do this . 
  note that this will only happen ( the separate network transaction ) if the css is located on a separate file ( external style sheet ) :, 
  the css can also be embedded on the html as internal or inline . 
  internal will be between the < head  tags and inline will be inside each element . 
  vacuum is important in manufacturing processes where you can control the atmosphere content or/and a sterile environment . 
  it does n't help much at home , since e. coli , s. aureus , clostridiums , enterococcus , salmonella , are all facultative anaerobic or anaerobic . 
  because they want to cruise portugal !,

  * naxx : 6, 
  * crafted : 5, 
  * golden : 2 ( gelbin and gallywix ),

  i 've disenchanted some ( millhouse , cho , nat twice , and he came back ) . 
  but i keep most of them . 
  i mostly play arena , that 's why i ended up opening so many packs `` for free '' .
