   this new species ( metoposaurus algarvensis ) belongs a group of similarly large salamander-like amphibians called temnospondyls -- a group that has previously been located in what 's now modern day africa , europe , india and north america . 
  dominating the food chain during much of the late triassic period , the creatures subsisted mainly on fish and behaved much like crocodiles . 
  they grew up to 6.5 feet in length and weighed upwards of 200 pounds . 
   researchers from the university of edinburgh identified the new species from a haul of bones dug from mudstone in loul\u00e9 , in the algarve region of southern portugal . 
  the bone bed may contain the remains of hundreds of amphibians that perished when an ancient lake dried up . 
  to date , only a fraction of the site has been excavated .

  food engineer here , stop doing my work !,

   we got scared that in the summers it get 's overcrouded with tourists and in the winters it 's kinda empty place, 
  it 's only overcrouded in august and only in some spots ( quarteira , vilamoura , albufeira , portim\u00e3o ) . 
  in september and july it has a lot of tourists but you do n't `` feel '' like it is overcrouded .

  really ? 
  way did the guys sent me an e-mail with beta keys ? 
  num computador talvez poupes 50 $ no total ? 
  that was probably an error from the bot that uploaded the info from the real estate to realtor . 
  the price listed for that apartment is exactly the same as the price ( 5.390 $ ) listed for a parking lot space/garage . 
  and vila real de santo ant\u00f3nio is in faro district but 65 km away from faro city . 
  beach side apartments are damn expensive . 
  if you are really interessed in buying a property in the / r/algarve you should take a look at some of this real estate agents :,

  not in the algarve . 
  but if you come here you have so many better thing to do . 
  where are you staying ?

  do n't know much about it but the location is pretty good . 
  i never ever found an atm machine in portugal that did n't withdraw the money i requested . 
  so , if this happens to anyone , it 's clearly a scam , with 99,9 % certainty . 
  it 's already hot in the / r/algarve . 
  yesterday it was really cloudy , but ~ 31\u00bac and warm water ( ~ 22\u00bac ) . 
  it can get hotter , though will probably stay like this during june and get extremely hot ( ~ 35\u00bac ) from 15/july to august . 
  it 's already getting crowded yet nothing compared to august . 
  it really depends where you are going to stay . 
  the touristic stuff is parasailing , jetsking , etc. 
  but surfing/bodyboard/kitesurf is really big on the west coast ( lagos and sagres ) . 
  also , every dock has it 's own naval club with sailing and other activities , for instances , the one in faro island ( `` clube n\u00e1utico da praia de faro '' ) has sailing , windsurf and canoeing , you can rent or have classes for a fair price ( something like 20 $ for 2 hours ) . 
   will it be crowded everywhere ? 
  we actually prefer the calmer spots and pristine nature . 
  in june it will only be crowded in vilamoura and albufeira .
