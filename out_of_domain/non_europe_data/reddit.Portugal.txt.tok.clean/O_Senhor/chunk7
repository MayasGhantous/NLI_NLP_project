  hahah , true . 
  if warm water is really important , i think you should go to tavira . 
  you have great beaches like praia da terra estreita or praia do barril . 
  you can visit tavira island or some of the other islands if you want ( armona , culatra , farol , barreta ) . 
  near tavira you can also go to cacela velha ( where ria formosa ends ) . 
  you will find warmer waters in the algarve but better waves in alentejo . 
  for snorkeling the west coast have more attractions . 
  regarding sea food , it will awesome everywhere .

   the caves can only be accessed from the sea .

  to reach benagil beach you have to take the road n125 from lagos to carvoeiro , when you reach the traffic lights in carvoeiro you will see the signs , turn right to benagil and follow those signs .

  * ~ ~ p\u00eago do inferno ~ ~ - near tavira ( it used to be awesome , but nowadays it 's abandoned and forgotten ),

   alternately , the fruit falls to the ground , decomposes , and that provides nutrients to the seed . 
  nowadays some commercial `` versions '' do n't even have seeds ( bananas , watermelons , grapes ) and the common man ends up thinking about those fruits as seedless , consequently , useless for the plant .
