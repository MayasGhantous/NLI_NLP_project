you mean like release thrall ? 
  as an organism abathur , that was n't very calculated on your part . 
  her biggest problem was not maxing e vs gnar matchup . 
  she could 've blocked all gnar 's damage ( every 3rd hit ) and she could have disengaged on mega gnar 's . 
  really bad played by her . 
  fuck this man , this gave me feels !, 
  tanks having % hp damage or abilities scaling with hp is broken and should not exist . 
  actually , i want to ask you something . 
  why would someone , who plays and understand the superior moba of the market , want to try one of the shittiest ones out there ? 
  just because its popular , does n't mean its good . 
  crit chance is still in the game . 
  still an assassin nonetheless . 
  healthiest and assassin cant go hand in hand , you know . 
  no , because they are pretty much broken . 
  they are easy to play , deal too much damage and have way too many tools to get in and out . 
  every assassin on this game should be reworked . 
  i read your post , my original post maintains and if everyone tells it sucks , why would you want to try it ? 
  it 's like people telling you that getting your ass pounded sucks while you pound ass and you wanted to try it anyway . 
  it 's plain dumb . 
  only season 1 . 
  league became garbage, 
  your mom, 
  why is gengar a bat ? 
  her q-auto animation cancelling is slower on dragonblade riven . 
  there was a video demonstrating that , some time ago . 
  if you try to do it fast , you 'll probably just cancel most of your autos , leading you to lose massive damage . 
  i just stick to bunny skin because its flawless . 
  you could just try it , calmly , on a custom game . 
  try it against a jungle camp . 
  do a full clear with dragonblade riven and then just go with the classic skin . 
  you will feel the difference and understand why it drives riven mains away from that skin . 
  i `` mentally '' know the range , and i just aim accordingly . 
  maybe i 'll start using range indicators , so there 's no margin of error . 
   nautilus ' basic attacks deal 2 + ( 6 \u00d7 nautilus ' level ) bonus physical damage and root icon root his target for 0.5 / 0.75 / 1 / 1.25 / 1.5 seconds . 
  root is not a stun . 
  fuck no . 
  oh well , guess its time to mod the hud . 
  she went from the second worst winrate to 9th place . 
  give it one more week and see her reach 3rd or 2nd place ( heimer will hardly lose the throne ) . 
  it 's the same thing . 
  from the top 10 champions with higher winrate , she is the 9th . 
  it 's in proper english . 
  i just checked the splash and she does look like taylor swift . 
  you got zhonyas , thats is actually pretty much better than mercurial scimitar . 
  you can overall mitigate a lot more damage and cc with a well placed stasis that you would with the qss . 
  it does n't matter , but because he resembles the idea of what a loser looks like to reddit ( even it 's a copy of themselves ) , they bash what he looks like . 
  however , i would advise pink ward to get a better haircut and exercise , not only for his health but for his future life . 
  so mostly sugar ? 
  tl ; dr : darius , garen and morde got slight buffs - skarner is now playing dominion on summoner 's rift . 
  on a more serious note , did n't they go overboard with that darius change ? 
  i mean , sure he is not a tier 1 top lane , but ever since his last changes he is in a fine state . 
  i feel that these will make him not only a really strong lane bully but also scale well to late game . 
  are we going to see penta darius all over again ? 
  nooooooooooxus ... how do ** you ** do that ? 
  no , it 's not . 
  conceptually , it 's fine - but they need to increase the number of stacks you need to get sated devourer . 
  right now , the junglers that use devourer get it way too early into the game , and do not allow enough pressure from junglers that use the other enchantment . 
  most devourer junglers upgrade it to sated at about 18/20 minutes ( and this without getting dragons or most crabs , because they can get it earlier ) , right about when baron spawns and if you 're not one of them - your pressure compared to enemy 's pressure will swiftly drain to ther side . 
  i 'd say increase the stacks to 45 instead of 30 , so that you can not only get like a 3rd drake in the mean time , but also force a baron fight against someone whom has to make a decision between farming or stopping enemy team from getting baron . 
  and vladimir reminds me of harry potter for some reason, 
  oh boy , i 'll have to decide between battle bunny and arcade skin !, 
  and new armor nerfs makes me very happy as a riven main !, 
  inb4 hate, 
  * ** server : ** euw / every server, 
  * ** type of bug : ** riven ca n't hop walls that she is supposed to be able to jump across, 
  * ** description : ** millennial riven bug that has ruined me many games - you ca n't hop a wall if you 're hovering over an enemy unit with your mouse ( it can be minions , jungle monsters or enemy champions ) . 
  * ** video / screenshot : ** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5lxckzwalq < -- this is pretty much it , the enemy unit could be at any distance , even close to that wall and riven still not being able to jump . 
  * ** steps to reproduce : ** just try to wall hop a known wall , while hovering an enemy unit with your mouse . 
  * ** expected result : ** riven wall hopping the wall, 
  * ** observed result : ** riven does n't wall hop the wall like she is supposed to, 
  * ** reproduction rate : ** 10/10, 
  * ** system specs : ** irrelevant, 
  this bug existed for years now and even boxbox , a fairly famous riven player has commented on this - still nothing done about it . 
  i personally could 've killed a lot of champions and stolen lots of barons if this bug was already fixed . 
  i really hope that riot sees this post and actually gets this wrapped up next patch . 
  if not , i 'll keep posting this until one day they notice me . 
  yes , but like someone else said - it 's too late now . 
  but i 'm pretty sure cristina vee would love to do some new riven voice overs , 
  possible . 
  i 'm guessing you have a replay ? 
  post it or just upload the full game to youtube . 
  send it to riot . 
  and this is why i ban rengar . 
  not only one shots carries with little counterplay ( and sometimes zhonyas , oracles and pink wards are n't enough ) , once he reaches level 6 , he just applies way too much pressure . 
  ah , assassins . 
  healthy . 
  i would n't say he is faceroll , but he can pick his own fights like no one else . 
  janna could 've easily ruined your fun :p, 
  omg lucker dog, 
  they 're not really overpriced at all if you buy both daily and per-win ip boosts ... and thats the point . 
  i 'm not exactly sure how it works , but i 'm fairly confident that it takes into account character movement and items bought . 
  cassiopeia is much stronger than azir later in the game . 
  pick her if you have enough poke and a early/mid team comp . 
  i have a better one :, 
  i am tryndamere , king of crits, 
  if you 're shit out of luck, 
  you better cut your own wrists, 
  because you 're going to suck, 
  that 's pretty much pbe 's job . . and we all know where that road ends, 
  actually , make her q reset on vitals broken,
