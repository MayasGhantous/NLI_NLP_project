* looks at sim city server issues * ... are you sure ? 
  my first game was with rumble ... suicide diving the entire enemy team with his q just to kill one and then die in seconds is still the most fun i had in this game ... good old careless times :d, 
  sidenote : and not a single ult was successfully hit in those games ... 
  me with veigar , the first champ i bought , going mid, 
  teammate : `` veigar why are you taking smite ? '', 
  me : '' 'cause it helps me kill the minions faster :d '', 
  teammate : `` noob '', 
  lulu : `` yup , that * beep * tasted purple *, 
  confirmed veigar x lulu :d, 
  it would still be better than anything that he has done with the franchise lately v.v, 
  and tf when he and graves were `` partners '' ... * if you know what i mean *, 
  why is trick2g 's photo a photo of gavin from roosterteeth/the slow mo guys ? 
  the new cleanse looks a bit like korra from legend of korra o.o, 
  * taunts with neon striker skin * do n't worry , i 'm on the case !, 
  so sky 's dst really works :o congrats btw !, 
  maybe jinx was always an undercover cop working with vi ( cait could n't know , for her own safety ) to dismantle piltover 's crime underworld :d that would explain her mafia skin as well, 
  i laughed just from how evil that sounds xd imagine the horror of placing a pink ward and finding yourself surrounded by a field of shrooms that keep `` respawning '' as fast as you destroy them d :, 
  * starts writing a script for a lol-themed saw movie *, 
  you need to be a serious girl gamer otherwise it wo n't work !, 
  you ca n't really compare business-wise riot , a game developer with a single game out functioning in a free-to-pay system , to valve , which holds a monopoly on pc digital distribution . 
  valve has an entire economic infrastructure ( steam ) to support . 
  my friend started working with fimo recently and she made me this little derp-looking poro :d, 
  edit ( for better photo ) : http://imgur.com/rvjsdhk, 
  i still ban jax whenever i can just because he annoys me to hell even if i demolish him in lane and he goes 0/7 he just split pushes all day long ( like tryn but nobody plays tryn , rip ) and i need to deal with him cause he can still duel easily with all my other teammates : /, 
  there 's toxic players in aram as well , and it has gotten worse lately , people just love blaming/harassing other people even in a `` just for fun '' - mode :\\ i started to just / ignore every one in those matches just so i do n't have to bother to read useless comments . 
  to be honest saying that concept skin , even though well done and pretty cool ( props to the creator ) , was the inspiration of the artic ops varus , seems kinda naive and gives little credit do the aov skin designer . 
  sure some aspects are similar ( the increasing circle during q and the grenades ) but aside from that they are very different in aspect . 
  similar ideas can be created separately , it happens :\\, 
  even though i saw a zyra concept art way before the haunted zyra announcement ... so i do n't know in what to believe anymore d :, 
  most yordles have a very spastic-type walk , just look at ziggs and veigar . 
  they just made heimer look more like the other yordles :d ... so we can kill them on sight faster !, 
  obviously the world of valoran is so afraid of the tiny master of evil that it tries to run away every time veigar makes a step !, 
  all hail lord veigar !, 
  well actually wanted the graphic novel , had lots of fucked up things aside from the bullet curving thing . 
  the movie though ... so much wasted potential ... hey it 's the clg of comic movie adaptations :d, 
  they could have tone down the typical over the top mark millar violence , like they did with kick-ass ( which i actually prefer the movie to the book ) i also did enjoy the wanted movie initially , but once i read the book i was like `` what why but but d : this is so much awesome , why not do this ?!? '', 
  i guess angelina jolie in a [ fox outfit ] ( http://starsmedia.ign.com/stars/image/article/884/884758/wanted-profiles-20080626032050477-000.jpg ) was too much for audiences :p, 
  ps : i agree with the no spoilers , read the book :d, 
  i ai n't even mad about the 20 + minutes lobby with tb waiting for a jungler , got to know the rest of the team before the match , never got trolls , really nice players , most fun i had in this game with random strangers . 
  gave normals a try today , got attack speed soraka jungler , she fed -_-, 
  why is your table wider when you throw it ? 
  d : tell me your black magic or i 'll call lucian !, 
  he 's hidden , plotting his revenge , adapting , awaiting his glorious evolution ! ... in the only place with less people than an amumu 's friendship is magic party . 
  ftfy, 
  so let 's also nerf all the global ults ( like ziggs 's bomb ) that do the same without actually making jump right to the middle of the enemy team :\\, 
  well but he 's right , for some reason people in this subreddit think they own this game , or that riot needs to answer to everything they say . 
  riot are the developers , they change the game as they think it 's better , they are the professionals , not the loud self-entitled gamers that think they know better -_- ', 
  there 's two extremes to malz 's bugs , or they completely ignore the person you are attacking which sucks when you are ult ` ing them , or they just randomly decide that suicide is the only answer and just follow the enemy and stand near their tower not attacking anything even though you are trying to make them focus the minions -_- ' the bugs are true to their name it seems . 
  ^ ^ but ^ ^ maybe ^ ^ if ^ ^ they ^ ^ fix ^ ^ this ^ ^ he ^ ^ will ^ ^ be ^ ^ op ^ ^ and ^ ^ rito ^ ^ will ^ ^ nerf ^ ^ him ^ ^ ; _ ; ^ ^ pls ^ ^ leave ^ ^ malz ^ ^ alone . 
  yeah i 'm scared that they will do that ( same with blind , my bird needs it !, 
  ) , but they did change kass silence to a channeling-cancel , so they probably wo n't do it . 
  besides , itemization is a counterplay , it 's not malz 's fault people forget qss exists -- ' , what they need to do is create a qss item for mages , since it 's useless for 90 % of mid laners :\\, 
  oh sorry \u0ca0 ~ \u0ca0 it was a freudian slip from my native language ( portuguese ) where you do use `` or ... or '' . 
  she 's an awesome duelist that can splitpush all day , with great mobility for escapes and to join tf super fast , still get flamed almost every game i play her top , usually it stops after you dominate your lane ... but if one of the other lanes loses , you are blamed for everything for being `` useless '' -_- ', 
  still , laughing at an ult ` ed tryndamere while he tries to lifesteal from you after you q him , is wurf the flame :d . i usually go for the crit burst + passive of ie+s hiv and then build tank items , only go for botrk when my lane match is really hard to kite or really tanky . 
  but my theorycraft is below wood v so ... 
  that 's what the kids call lesbian porn nowadays ? 
  oh o_o i 'm actually right ... ok ... * hmm * ... i shall do my research on the matter ... * hmm * ... for science !, 
  definitely * only * old nokias , since the last few generations the software is so bad i completely gave up on them . 
  sorry but randomly turning off during a call is not `` ok behavior '' for a mobile phone < _ <, 
  yup same thing as totalbiscuit 's `` total biscuit of rejuvenation '', 
  i 'm sorry but nothing gives me more pleasure in this game than see a nidalee in pain xd like one the other day that went bruiser nid top vs me with panths and complained about pantheon 's `` broken kit '' , coming from the `` you ai n't getting this pussy '' - champ it was extremely ironic . 
  too me it was the [ lissandra login monologue ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglisrzftry ) , made me really interested in the lore behind the game , which helped me stick to the game even though i had zero experience with mobas, 
  those americans and their na streamers !, 
  how about eu streamers ? 
  no love for keyori , sp4zie , uber , the obamacare crew , sure they are mostly youtubers but they do stream d :, 
  edit : oh and making gbay99 a caster would make him the happiest summoner ever probably, 
  i think riot can pretty much just make accounts with all champs and runes and everything , so that would n't be a problem xd, 
  i was under the impression that it would be a match for shits and giggles , was n't expecting high elo plays , it would n't be that much fun watching sky and sivhd cast a `` tryhard '' match in my opinion , but you are right , i actually do n't know any high elo eu streamers < . <, 
  is n't that what happens in the lcs and ogn ? 
  * honest question * i have no idea o.o, 
  epicskillshots had them all upload but they got deleted d : but i found another channel , not as good quality as the ones that where in epic 's channel :\\, 
  [ game 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofgofaexjha ) [ game 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqybkw6zlci ) [ game 3 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6btf2oeb8gg ) [ game 4 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_usua0lplbs ) and the [ man 5 vs flower 5 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhnopg0mqk0 ) match is pretty troll as well :d, 
  this , solo'ing baron with 5 constant voidlings is too awesome :d even though ad malz kinda sucks later on when people are full build and just focus you < . < ^ ^ pls ^ ^ riot ^ ^ give ^ ^ malz ^ ^ kassadin 's ^ ^ jump ^ ^ for ^ ^ opness, 
  got called `` bronze 5 noob '' for not dodging a barrage of nidalee 's spears and dying when two of them manage to hit me ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ even ^ ^ ^ ranked ^ ^ ^ ; _ ; also a nasus got flamed for backdooring while the enemy team was killing our nexus < _ < why ca n't people just have fun , i never laughed so hard in this game , there 's something special about getting demolished by the cow :d, 
  yeah , poor talon trying to kill me , ult myself w < e < q < q and repeat until he dies , i think he hated me xd , only had issues with master yi cause he kept alpha striking my w d :, 
  played a game today with 2 nidalee 's top ( from my team and enemy team ) plus me as fizz and a enemy teemo . 
  me and teemo just stayed in the back while the 2 nidalee 's threw spears at eachother . 
  it was so retarded and hilarious at the same time xd, 
  i always give the benefit of the doubt to people since sarcasm and jokes do n't translate very well through the internet ... but in this case in particular that person kept flaming the entire team every time someone died or we got aced , so i 'm pretty sure it was n't a joke xd, 
  gave teemo a try , served has my team 's scout going into the enemy jungle and eventually base to put down as much shrooms as possible so that we had vision and teleport points all over the map ... pretty accurate with the lore . 
  ( could n't actually kill anyone doe xd ), 
  kinda too late ... `` hecarim 's joke , `` suffering is magic , '' is a reference to the tv show , my little pony : friendship is magic , created by lauren faust . '' . 
  besides , what 's wrong with mlp , or is this just bandwagon hate ? 
  saw a couple of episodes of it , it was fun , not my thing , understand why people enjoy it though :\\, 
  but several other shows/songs/characters are over-referenced not only in games but in other media ( just look at simpsons and family guy ) i think the issue is not the show itself but the community around it and what it represents , like ideachannel talked about in one of their videos [ are bronies changing the definition of masculinity ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=est3uns-lik ) , but this connects to a bunch of other gender identity themes and social issues that are too over-extensive to discuss in / r/leagueoflegends xd ( on the other hand there 's probably a post in / r/anthropology about it :3 ), 
  about `` cloppers '' i guess sexuality is a even more complicated topic to discuss , and i do n't have a psychology background to speak about it :\\, 
  already seen that video a thousand times only now did i notice the song is from mass effect < _ < good guy dunkey actually puts links to the songs in the description :d, 
  `` the otamatone - it is a musical-note shaped singing toy which requires two hands to be played : while one hand holds and/or squeezes the `` head '' , the other hand controls the pitch of the tune by sliding the finger up and down the stem '', 
  [ what ? ... k. . . 
  ] ( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/157/639/t1zr7.gif ) ^ ^ iwantone, 
  i do n't understand these top laners , your entire job is to pull pressure from the enemy jungler , if you are losing your lane , ward and turtle in your tower . 
  on the other hand , if you do decide to gawk my lane , pls junglers , do n't gawk my lane when i 'm vs a renek and you are less than 50 % health -_- ', 
  actually the `` in summer '' song would make more sense , so many great lines for snowlaf :, 
  taunt - `` imagine how much cooler i 'll be in summer ! '', 
  ^ ^ brolafsnowlaf ? 
  ... it got patched ? 
  disengage : `` flips fiora a little bit farther '' , so they are giving her quinn 's vault ? 
  it 's great that i finally started playing her and love her now during her current free week and they are going to rework her -- ', 
  14 year old me , i need a name , what are the coolest characters i know ?
