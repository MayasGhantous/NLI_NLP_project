  i still miss the old veigar , my only ranked penta was with him :\\ i 'm pretty sure he will get nerf , being a 600ap veigar by 20-25 minutes just from farming and harassing is bullshit, 
  it 's probably just a matter of time before ~ ~ google ~ ~ i mean `` alphabet '' buys twitch and incorporates it into the family , i remembered the other day when google tried to start their own video platform to compete with youtube and when nobody was using it they just straight up bought youtube , i think there should be a law against that sort of thing ... ^ ^ / s, 
  and it made the next scene with emily blunt ever more distressing because you had the context from the dinner scene in mind . 
  seriously del toro and blunt were amazing in sicario . 
  [ well he reacted fast ] ( https://twitter.com/montecristo/status/778971659478761472 ) , still with no actual official annoucement and no details yet discussion about being a fair amount or not is speculation at this point, 
  full metal alchemist scene with nina and the tachikomas scene in the sac second season are still the only two animes that made me cry , fucking cute robots, 
  it 's a very effective system , you just need to build a big enough community so they do all the work for you . 
  well that 's great for the overinflated us university context , but universities in europe are free or at least affordable with the money pros already get . 
  i think a structure to help the young kids with legal , financial and health/mental issues during their pro career , and have a programme to give them support or counseling during the transition after they leave the pro-scene would be better . 
  not every team can afford the same structure that tsm has , it would be nice for riot to help the actual structure of the teams a bit more besides a coach . 
  oh i thought it was announced that obsidian was working on a new fallout like they did with new vegas , i guess i dreamt it :\\, 
  using the ekko example helps people understand better what happens , both hec and ekko 's e empower their auto attacks and increase their range , but while ekko blinks to the person he autos , hecarim 's model still travels the distance normally so he can be affected by cc and displacements during the travel time but the auto already hit according to the server . 
  thanks for reminding me the finnish have some of the chillest metal bands ever , all i 've seen live were super cool with fans . 
  seriously in terms of viewer experience every esport should try to achieve what cs : go has , it 's simple and intuitive , i ca n't play cs : go to save myself so i gave up on the game long ago , but i still watch some of their major tournaments and i can easily see what 's happening and enjoy the action even without understanding the nuances of the plays . 
  league 's perspective and ui helps newcomers a bit , but teamfights can still be too chaotic to understand what 's happening , ffs i 've been playing for 3 years and i still need the recaps with slowmotion to understand most 5v5s, 
  well he 's not stupid , nobody knows how long a career as a streamer can actually last , much less someone that plays mostly 1 game , he 's better off trying to milk it as much as possible while he can , also there 's obviously a big enough community interested in that type of content , just look at the bigger youtube channels they are all pretty much the same thing . 
  did sirhcez drop off from the `` good guys streamers '' list ? 
  i have n't watched him in months ^ ^ there 's ^ ^ only ^ ^ so ^ ^ much ^ ^ singed/nasus ^ ^ top ^ ^ i ^ ^ can ^ ^ handle, 
  to be fair , are n't the blizzard servers under pretty regular stress from ddos attacks lately ? 
  it 's pretty hard to play a game when you ca n't access it :\\, 
  yeah that was my exact thought watching it , a mini map allows the viewer to have some point of reference to where everyone is , it 's super confusing when they keep changing between pov of different heroes to free cam and back to pov , honestly the observers are still new to the game and they will improve , but right now they really need to show some restrain from changing perspectives every 1 second , it reminds me why i hate most modern action movies with 30 edit cuts for a 20 seconds scene < _ <, 
  there was no live performance last year , do n't get your hopes up that there will be one this year . 
  even though i would love riot to just hire an orchestra and let them play all the awesome songs their music studio produced over the years . 
  hi you should give [ sanctuary of legends ] ( http://sanctuaryoflegends.org/ ) a try , they are a pretty nice community of players trying to help other players going through depression and other mental issues . 
  there was a mod for that when the orange box came out , it was as awesome as you imagine, 
  [ example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vp4a7nljffg ), 
  lcs ( league of legends championship series ) are region specific league tournaments ( north american lcs/european lcs ) they have 2 splits , spring split and summer split and have games every week during the first half of the year , there 's similar leagues in other regions like lck ( korea ) ; lpl ( china ) and lms ( taiwan/hong kong ) . 
  the worlds championship is a tournament with the top 3 teams from na lcs/eu lcs/lck/lpl + top 2 lpl + 2 wildcard teams ( from the smaller regions like brazil and russia this year ) , it last 1 month and has the biggest prize pool from all the lol tournaments . 
  there 's a another tournament , msi ( mid-season invitational ) that happens between the spring and summer splits and only has the top 1 team from each region , it 's like a mini-worlds . 
  that sounds exactly like something ogn would make as an hype video, 
  yet that international thread got 81 % upvotes ratio , and this one is at 67 % right now . 
  yeah i 've been watching the highlight videos during breakfast , you do n't get to see much of the macro play of the teams but you still get a general sense of the context of the plays happening , damn even the ahq vs c9 is enjoyable to watch when it 's compact into a 5 minutes video . 
  while i appreaciate the effort , [ the esportswiki also has this and with more information ] ( http://lol.esportswikis.com/wiki/2016_season_world_championship/statistics/champions ), 
  on topic : without wanting to keep beating a dead horse , the jungle diversity shows how important it is for riot to increase the bans to 10 , once the trinity got banned you started seeing skarner , olaf , nocturne . 
  if you ban most s tier champs teams will have access to a bigger pool of possible a tier champs increasing the diversity in games . 
  sidenote : they also said previously they do n't want to increase the pick/ban time in normal games , but is it really that bad to have 6 bans in pubs and 10 for competitive matches ? 
  the problem with jungle is that you always have an holy trinity , 3 s-tier champions that have better clears/early ganks/utility than most other a tier champions which is why they have priority , when you start reaching for the a tier and b tier pools you see champions that fill certain niches and comps , like the skarner/karma strat and the malz/noc strat , jungle picks stop being a paper , scissors and rock game between the two teams to see who gets who and becomes a choice more heavily related with the general team comp and strategy . 
  well if they ban 10 junglers we might start seeing full damage bruisers and mages in the jungle instead of low-economy utility junglers , that might actually be fun ( would probably start a new tank top meta though < _ < ), 
  why the illaoi flair if you have n't played in 2 years ? 
  myself personally i have a huge problem with getting into a game at the start and power through the initial bump/grind , even before i started playing league most of the games i played for 2 ~ 5 hours and then just stopped and was unable to force myself to continue . 
  on the other hand after the bump i tend to stick with them for obnoxious amount of hours , with for example hundreds of hours in tf2 , the fallout games , mass effect/dragon age , and the now `` omg this is depressing '' amount of time spent on league . 
  i love that splashart so much but i always feel remorse in picking it cause the actual in-game model looks like shit ; _ ;, 
  `` florida man shoots aussie in clown makeup '' sure sounds like a great nottheonion title, 
  is n't `` we will rock you '' already a pretty standard sports chant , even just the base rhythm with other words on top , at least in europe it is not sure about na :|, 
  i spent like 30 minutes watching all the [ hero spotlights from this channel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=pl86e04995e07f6ba8 ) it kinda helped understand at least some basics of what each hero was doing during the international , also some mechanics are similar to league . 
  my biggest issue was trying to follow more macro strategy stuff . 
  r/summonerschool for easier access, 
  we could give them the rest of ukraine for the honor of being represented by the russia motherland , i think that 's a good win/win situation :d ^ ^ minus ^ ^ for ^ ^ ukraine, 
  [ radio lab did an episode about buttons ] ( http://www.radiolab.org/story/buttons-not-buttons/ ) , the third part is about `` the nuclear button '' and how the nuclear codes are always in a briefcase near the president , and they talk about a proposed alternative to the current method to access the codes , put it inside a man 's heart , if the president wanted to kill thousands he would have to first kill a single innocent man with a knife to get the codes ... but i doubt that would stop trump though :|, 
  edit : this is a theory proposed by roger fisher - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roger_fisher_ ( academic ) #preventing _ nuclear_war, 
  to be honest i do n't think it 's good for riot to improve animations for certain skins and much less create very different animations because they might give several hidden benefits to the player using them . 
  in the first case , improving animations can alter the way you play the champion , this already happens with 2 skins in particular rocket girl tristana and aether wing kayle , both have improved aa animations that make the base skin and other skins look sluggish when using them . 
  the second case is related to the expectations and perception that players have associated with a champion , most players use certain animations to understand what the enemy is about to do since some animations give away specific abilities , there 's the example of the recent arcade ezreal skin ult that riot had to add a direction indicator because the animation made it hard to understand it , and there 's also the issue with warring kingdoms katarina skin whose initial animation for one of her taunts was extremely similar to her q animation and people could exploit it . 
  tl ; dr : improving animations for specific skins can be problematic when dealing with the perception that players have of each champion and might be considered unfair for some player-to-player interactions . 
  why should the people be punished because of their dick president ? 
  damn the color pallet feels so much like the graphic novel [ east of west ] ( https://images7.alphacoders.com/664/664160.jpg ), 
  i strongly suggest reading east of west if you enjoy the western/sci-fi mix of westworld ... there 's a ton of western/sci-fi comics , i guess space and the post-apocalyptic works very well with the western frontier thematic . 
  even if you do n't enjoy the new skarner it made it relevant again in the game , he has the 7th highest winrate of junglers with 52.59 % and it 's the 13th most played jungler when he was pretty much seen as a troll pick before the rework . 
  we can discuss possible quality of life fixes that would make him less clunky , but right now he 's in the best state he has been in years . 
  i love his [ spider jerusalem ] ( https://shoresinflames.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/spider1.jpg ) look , it 's nice when the creators cosplay their characters, 
  damn yeah my lapse sorry , for some reason i always grouped together transmetropolitan , watchmen and v for vendetta on my head . 
  which to be fair the jhin ult nerfs happened in 6.17 , still i agree that riot should at least remove the slow from the ult , once you hit 1 shot the rest are way to easy in a normal context , but the clip the op is using is not a normal context since jhin was 1 level ahead of cait and a full item ahead of her as well . 
  i really liked the director 's cut ( i guess that 's snyder 's thing ) , i did make the mistake of introducing a friend to the film with the ultimate edition , that version kills all the pacing from the movie < _ <, 
  i swear people like this need to get out of their little echo chamber and actually talk to people in real life more often , still why do people that love so much to talk about these topics do n't do actual research on them ? 
  there 's tons of studies showing that transsexuality is at least in part result of epigenetics , it just shows their ignorance . 
  and that 's the moment when you must grab the opportunity by the pussy and get a double kill , showing who 's the true king of the top lane ... or the most plausible alternative , you flash , the wave pushes , you lose cs and get fucked for the rest of the laning phase , when this happens i just try to make the enemy 's midlaner life miserable . 
  [ you know what they say : karma always catches up to you ] ( http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/7/72/karma.joke01.ogg/revision/latest?cb=20130320013301 ), 
  [ karma sup 's highest winrate build has 2 frost queen 's claim ] ( https://champion.gg/champion/karma/support ) probably an issue with champion.gg ... or maybe they are telling us karma mains to stay [ frosty ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncnw5vu9wsy ), 
  the na finals were 1 ) in canada , different country different people , 2 ) it had tsm there and 3 ) it had no non-na teams ... these are 2 completely different contexts < _ <, 
  early game everyone has access to free trinket wards , trinket wards - consume a charge to place an invisible sight ward which reveals the surrounding area for 60 -- 120 seconds . 
  stores one charge every 180 -- 120 seconds , up to 2 maximum charges . 
  there 's definitely time windows to gank the lanes , you need comunication, 
  it 's still one of the biggest games around , and most devs would love to have a cash cow with such a dedicated player base as valve has with dota 2 , maybe in comparison with league it might be smaller but its hardly `` dying '' and irrelevant , this makes you look as misinformed as the guy in the original op . 
  meanwhile blizzard tried to force esports on hots and it was dead on arrival . 
  the best compromise in my opinion is :, 
  turn msi into a full major-type tournament , with the same amount of teams as worlds , scrap the seeding stuff and they all play for money ( which can now be increased by skins ), 
  turn all-stars into what msi was ( small tournament in the off-season with few teams ) while maintaining some random games ( there 's a ton of special modes now ) and 1v1s between pros . 
  to be honest i really do n't enjoy the random 5v5 ( ice vs fire ) games . 
  the uk is still very much part of the eu and it will be for a while , they still have n't even triggered article 50 which starts the process of them leaving and that can last 2 years before it ends . 
  also , yes the op is a joke reference to the euphoria memes from last year with fnatic/origen in the semi-finals . 
  * ziggs 's satchel charge ( w ), 
  * tristana 's explosive charge ( e ), 
  is there more abilities able to damage towers ? 
  edited , thanks !, 
  i miss having the possibility of playing adcs in other lanes , they pretty much made the rework to create diversity in the role and open opportunities for the champions that are pretty much stuck botlane since season 2 , and now , after an entire year of nerfs to all non-standard marksman 's they are all back to the same position they were , niche champions that are barely viable outside of botlane . 
  [ why not both ? 
  ] ( http://wallpapercave.com/wp/hkehlfc.png ) ^ ^ i ^ ^ miss ^ ^ souleater, 
  you can pretty much go anything that you feel comfortable top nowadays , if you go even in lane the top with best tps and pressure with side waves control tends to win . 
  jayce is the only truly broken top laner now , just ban him . 
  hide it before the americans wake up and start calling it `` black face '' !, 
  still really great cosplays there . 
  sandi was always one of my favorite guest on the show , she always showed balanced between being knowledgeable about several subjects and being funny at the same time . 
  out of context plug because i also love them , the guys that work finding all those qi facts have a podcast [ no such thing as a fish ] ( http://qi.com/podcast/ ) , about more random facts , and a tv/youtube show about weekly news called [ no such thing as the news ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucsthsjj6okpxgsvouiwvpca/videos ), 
  i think the major difference is between those that smoke regularly and actually work and those that just kinda try to pass the class , i know multiple people that do drugs recreationally and those that got high grades usually were present almost every day ( even if high ) , talked to the teachers and worked hard when needed ... the other stayed at home getting high and playing games . 
  they are far from perfect though , many have critized their internal structure related to their fast growth as a company as you can see in their [ glassdoor reviews ] ( https://www.glassdoor.com/reviews/riot-games-reviews-e247538.htm ) , but recently several rioters said there have been some internal changes which was what made possible all the recent projects that we have been waiting for . 
  edit : examples of [ negative reviews ] ( https://www.glassdoor.com/reviews/employee-review-riot-games-rvw11920755.htm ), 
  it 's easier to find a pro-heartstone viewer than someone that watched monte/doa 's overwatch . 
  i think they do sell tshirts and other stuff , try contacting their [ english twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/tigerslol_eng ) or [ facebook ] ( https://www.facebook.com/tigerslol/ ),
