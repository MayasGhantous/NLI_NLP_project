  those games were fun , extremely accessible to newcomers and had a great cartoon style design with personality , it 's like all the main tenets of riot 's design philosophy , the only downside was that the story was kinda meh , but inject a bit of league lore and background and we are good to go !, 
  but we are talking about battleborn ... the game with a full retail price that still forced you to unlock heroes and buy in-game cosmetics , it was already a game designed with a f2p model but they still decided stick a entry value to it . 
  if they made it 60 $ with all heroes unlocked , some free cosmetics from the start and released cosmetic packs or bonus missions as dlc maybe the game would have had a chance . 
  as it 's been said before over and over again , you can play whatever the fuck you want as support , really most people do n't freaking care , as long as you :, 
  1 ) buy sighstone ;, 
  2 ) help your adc if he asks for help , instead of roaming 99 % of the time ;, 
  3 ) communicate with your team about what you are doing . 
  the only truly meta thing i said was buying a sightstone , and that 's because its low cost/high value makes it slot efficient mostly for low economy roles ( aka support and junglers ) . 
  the only reportable offense of the singed supp was him not communicating with his team , people are spreading a mindless bullshit argument that the meta does n't allow roaming for supports and makes them adc babysitters , and that play style is fine if you are playing soraka i guess , but if you are on a support with any sort of cc you should roam mid , you should invade the enemy jungler to deep ward or harrass the jungler , you can go top and gank , as long as you warn your team of what you are doing . 
  hell , if you are in a losing matchup bot and getting fucked by the enemy botlane you better off just roaming with your jungler creating pressure on other points of the map , instead of being under tower getting poked and killed over and over again . 
  tl ; dr : situational context is fucking important to play support , it 's not just babysitting the adc , unless you are playing the role the wrong way . 
  unless ogn pulls out of league completely ( which i doubt ) , ls only casts the spotv games ... ogn with monte/doa/papa / doa2 cast all the lck games on their stream , so your comment is just a random critique of ls . 
  from my perspective the biggest issue with marksmen is the only big rng that riot and the community keeps accepting , crit damage and crit chance , which directly affects these power spikes and corners every crit based champion to have at least 3 items before he can be anywhere considered a threat . 
  it would be much easier to balance champions kits and items if all champions in the marksman class instead of relying on the randomness of crit chance , they would all instead get a basic attack value modifiers , for example , instead of 100 ad = 100 damage on auto , it would deal 150 damage on auto but always , no rng . 
  they already did it with corki , having hybrid damage , and kalista/kog , reducing the value to incentive on-hit build . 
  changing the basic attack values of the marksmen and removing crit would allow a easier balance and more experimentation with builds , since right now crit builds allows for the highest dps on any adc . 
  ^ ^ also ^ ^ removing ^ ^ crit ^ ^ would ^ ^ fuck ^ ^ yasuo ^ ^ and ^ ^ trynd ^ ^ :d, 
  to be fair liberal safe spaces should be spaces in which people should be allowed to propose questions and express themselves without judgement ... instead of making people safe ( and more ignorant ) of divergent opinions which is how they have been used lately . 
  like always both extreme views suck . 
  the honest answer ? 
  because most people do n't wan na spend 40-60 minutes stuck in a game fighting until the very end for a 30/70 chance that they might be able to win that game after a disastrous laning phase . 
  if the average game time of league was way shorter more people would be willing to fight until the end , otherwise it 's just too time consuming which is why many simply stopped playing it . 
  it also does n't help that league right now is extremely snowball with very few opportunities for a comeback unless the enemy team does something really stupid . 
  like i said before , the issue is that people feel frustrated when playing from behind and the only thing that can help them comeback is if the enemy team makes several mistakes in a row ( give up vision , towers , drakes for free ) or misplay teamfights , it 's never your urgency to make the comeback , you always have to rely on the enemy to fuck up . 
  if riot implemented better comeback mechanics this mental process would probably improve . 
  lets consider pro play as the most correct way to play this game , skt are the undisputed kings of league because once they have a lead they will suffocate the enemy slowly and methodologically by playing the map and not making stupid mistakes , it 's almost impossible for the enemy to make a comeback ( unless you are ambition with his godlike smites ) , as much as i find skt 's play impressive it still makes feel frustrated for their enemies inability to do anything . 
  yeah this is kinda unfair if the enemy does n't have a hard engager on their team , i once was playing jhin with a xerath mid and jayce top , it felt dirty . 
  the same old story with league champions , she 's released , people call her underpowered , riot buffs her a little bit and gives her abilities quality of life fixes , suddenly everybody figures out what makes her kinda op ( in this case , her retarded wave clear and being able to clear all caster minions at level 1 ) , she becomes top priority in pro-play and her damage gets gutted until riot figure 's out what to do with her . 
  the paresh dave 's article in the la times talks about the biggest issue with this in my opinion :, 
   ** `` riot games would take on major risks if its app becomes the only place to watch professional `` league of legends '' games or if a subscription is required . 
  twitch and youtube have large existing communities and can draw viewers into a match while they 're perusing other videos . 
  the features could be difficult for a standalone app to replicate . 
   ** `` if they are cutting people off , is it going to make the game a less popular thing ? '' said eliot kent-uritam , who follows e-sports as director of media and analytics at ad agency nice & co. `` what could be the worst long-term thing is doing something that makes people less interested . '' **, 
  people watch the lcs because of it 's structure , you know always when it 's on ( aside from when they decided to change the twitch channels this year and saw a huge decline at the start ) , and because it 's on two very familiar and very accessible platforms , youtube and twitch . 
  i wonder how many people will bother with the mlbam app/streaming service just to watch na and eu lcs , specially when most have no interaction with it since it 's an american thing for what i understand . 
  but to be fair klein has nothing to do with the esport division of riot . 
  since everyone here is being a dick you are probably better off going to r/summonerschool , they tend to be more helpful with this sort of thing , goodluck mate . 
  he does have a [ portuguese water dog ] ( https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rtxdznb-1024x741.jpg ) , should we call r/conspiracy ? 
  holy ... this kills the item , i know it 's 600 gold cheaper , but is it even slot efficient now with less 100 health , less 25 ap and less 20 % slow on single target and aoe abilities ? 
  i feel like they pushed it to be obligatory on every champion that really needs it , mostly cass and malz , while everybody else will never buy it . 
  sidenote , this is the exact opposite of how i wanted riot to balance ap items , the item choice should be around their actives and passives , making items with very different raw stats just makes people go for the most stat efficient items over and over again :\\, 
  [ shakarez ( aka kaylebot ) calculated it going from 101 % to 93.51 % gold efficiency ] ( https://twitter.com/shakarez/status/801599151544877061?lang=en ) , with the slow also being nerfed for everyone that does n't have a low cooldown ability or a dot i do n't think it will be picked by most mages at all , on the other hand hextech glp-800 might be more picked as an alternative if you really need a slow . 
  the enemy le blanc has 0 mr runes , is 2 deaths and 1 entire level behind vs a fed lb . 
  new le blanc is way easier to deal with than before and she kinda sucks in team fights if you have good positioning since she has to wait before the burst to proc , in those 1.5 seconds a late game adc can auto a lb twice with crit and she 's dead . 
  you clicked on her , it showed her stats and she only has the 30 base mr. 
  in his op.gg profile he only has 2 ap rune pages and both run cdr glyphs , still cocky as fuck to go vs a lb without mr runes and then not buy mr after dying twice already . 
  it 's honestly indifferent whatever elo you are in the ladder during the preseason , the new season will have a soft reset and you will have to play 10 placements for the new solo ranked season , this means that if riot still has n't fixed the mmr issue we will all be bronze and silver after the placements . 
  if you really care about it wait until may or something to start playing ranked . 
  well , whalen ( riotmagus ) is still the head of esports , and after multiple stories from different people about interactions with him , its hard to doubt he would n't try to bully back the teams instead of being professional and negotiate new agreements that favours everyone . 
  because they knew there was no way riot would agree with most of the stuff that would benefit primarily the organisations instead of the players , trying to pit the community against riot was the one real pressure they could make ... aside from leaving the lcs , which would be the biggest ultimatum in this entire conflict . 
  i think they did n't put it back on rotation because it was hard to balance visually , as in , people were complaining about having difficulty seeing abilities in the map . 
  or people could downvote it , report it as non-league related and move on . 
  the article in no way mentions ogn , it looks just like the kespa cup but also with chinese teams . 
  on a side note , it 's interesting seeing cs : go mentioned as a big esport next to league and dota 2 , i thought sudden attack and crossfire were way bigger in the asian markets . 
  all things related to basic human rights should not be privatised , since they will always come second to profit . 
  i honestly do n't understand how people keep blindly supporting a capitalist system with free market and few regulations when it has been showed over and over again that industries are able to manipulate said regulations to improve profits while fucking over everybody else . 
  personally i do n't believe in only one system having supremacy over every industry , i think a state should provide basic tier necessities to everyone , cheap healthcare/food/housing / education even internet , and a capitalist free market system should work in `` premium '' tiers providing services above the basic needs . 
  that 's pretty much how healthcare works in most european countries , you have extremely cheap and accessible hospitals and clinics , if you want something specific you are always free to go to a private clinic of your choosing if you have the money . 
  it 's the second q proc , it blinks when the second q is ready to deal true damage . 
  oh nevermind i thought you were talking about the blink , i just noticed the crystals below the enemies , no idea what that is :| i do n't remember seeing it mentioned anywhere, 
  edit : it might be a remnant of the map itself since skinspotlight have their custom sign over the floor, 
  oh , now it makes much more sense , thanks for the info !, 
  and thanks for working on these videos :d, 
  against an anivia with zero mr runes , because they went for scaling ap . 
  i love all the clips showing up of burst mages doing their function against dumbasses with no extra mr -_-, 
  trickle down [ memetics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/memetics ), 
  god i started playing the game when this sub was making fun of vulcun for changing it 's name to xdg , it was a long time ago < _ <, 
  i think it 's sillier that he even made himself into a `` character '' as the video game attorney for pretty much free publicity , any time there 's any law related issue in videogames or internet culture in general people keep tagging him here on reddit . 
  i 've heard assassins are pretty strong vs her , you should give it a try ^ ^ ^ seriously ^ ^ ^ pls ^ ^ ^ do, 
  [ base champion statistics ] ( http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/base_champion_statistics ) , have fun . 
  until it stops giving people upvotes and website views , i doubt it . 
  this is great news for twitch , it seems they have been trying to get a better foot on the korean market lately , which benefits western viewers as well . 
  maybe / u/lilsusie can gives us more information . 
  and probably one of my favorite versions of deadpool , much prefer his dark humor yet lovable version in x-force than the `` random-acts of randomness '' that the internet appears to love about him . 
  the same is happening with harley quinn , but i have n't read her solo series so i do n't know how much dc is letting the margot robbie version influence the comic book character . 
  in the end , the version that makes the most money will be viewed as the definite version for most people unfortunately . 
  a practice mode is nice and all , but it 's far from being `` game-changing '' wtf < _ <, 
  it means stick , but it 's often used as a slang for dick , no idea why dick is the first translation that shows up in google translate . 
  there 's a difference between someone forcing you into a bubble ( what facebook does ) and yourself creating a bubble with discussions you think coincides better with your interests . 
  any conscious person with free will is able to `` leave their bubble '' and explore other perspectives , i visited the donald many times even though i do n't agree with most of what they say , but i also do n't want my frontpage ( edit : r/all ) with mostly posts from there . 
  this is what i meant , sorry . 
  my bookmarked reddit link sends me directly to r/all, 
  there 's a difference between you unfollowing a friend and stop seeing their posts ( which works like the reddit filter ) , and what facebook 's algorithm does , which slowly stops showing posts from individuals you do n't interact very much ( through likes and comments ) . 
  one is voluntary the other not so much . 
  serious question : has the balance team ever consider making variants of a sightstone item , or vision items in general , for other roles ? 
  aside from trinkets , right now jungler 's have the tracker 's knife and assassins have the new duskblade of draktharr passive , meanwhile tanks , ap casters and adc have to rely on the trinkets and hope their teammates do the job since sightstone is n't a slot efficient item for these roles :\\, 
  ... i did n't know there was a `` most recent '' tab :| i guess a lot of people do n't as well , or i 'm just really stupid . 
  why are you shitposting / u/obscurica , are you ok ? 
  sidenote , this is the moment when riot should seriously consider a separate bracket during the world championship 2017 , side a would be the korean bracket and side b would be the losers bracket with everybody else . 
  i thought he stopped playing league for overwatch , he 's back to league ? 
  i started maining renek last year because of him lol, 
  i have n't read the short story it 's based on in years , but i think they did add a bunch of stuff that was n't on the original to pad it since otherwise the movie would be really short . 
  i absolutely loved sarah snook though , i do n't think i 've seen her in anything else since predestination :\\, 
  everyone expected you to be the next toph but you ended up being like those [ shitty cgi earthbenders ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rpgbzchk_a ) from the shyamalan movie, 
  when i started watching ogn everybody talked about the great org that was cj entus , but all i saw in 3 years was a korean [ vulcun ] ( http://lol.gamepedia.com/xdg_gaming ) full of burnouts and suffering a painful slow death . 
  he was also the stand-in for [ rocket raccoon during filming ] ( http://images.moviefanatic.com/iu/s--esz6useq--/t_full/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_75/v1417643407/guardians-of-the-galaxy-set-photo-dave-bautista.jpg ), 
  as a non-american with no access to spike , most of my knowledge of geoff came from the work he did with gametrailers.com and he seemed to really care about the gaming industry in general . 
  that reminded me of the [ `` se * xbox '' debate because of mass effect on fox news ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzf173gqtu ) , he handled that situation with much more patience than i would have , that thing was 8 years ago wtf < _ <, 
  [ bjergsen appears to be in la ] ( https://twitter.com/bjergsen/status/804604622975299584?lang=en ) , is n't everyone in barcelona already for all-stars ? 
  or they can just make it like heal where subsequent heals casts on the same person will be 50 % less effective for a certain period .
