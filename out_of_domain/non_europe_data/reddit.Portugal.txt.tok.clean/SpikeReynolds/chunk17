  the sub is just too big for serious game discussions , even esports threads are mostly full of jokes and memes , just like r/gaming , there 's smaller subs if you wan na talk about the game , like r/summonerschool, 
  the new rox tigers are also playing it right now , but it shows that it 's extremely situational and you need to abuse the bot side otherwise it 's a super squishy botlane that can be killed over and over again ( which * spoilers * it 's what 's happening against this ziggs ), 
  yup and riot is all about readability , that 's their argument for not bringing back the butchers bridge aram map , even though it was really cool and they wasted a ton of manpower doing it . 
  many people complained about being unable to see champion abilities , which makes sense since all new champions and skins are playtested against the summoner 's rift colour palette . 
  damn , just got hit with nostalgia of starting playing league and finding the [ the misadventures of veigar and lulu !, 
  ] ( http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3174110 ) , it 's sad that the icons do n't show up anymore , he/she even made custom icons for the champion 's reactions [ ex : [ lulu blushing ] ( http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/attachment.php?attachmentid=748883 ) ], 
  honest question why do you see that number on a free to play game that can be played on 15 year old pcs to be so unrealistic ? 
  minecraft is another example of how accessibility is super important in games , according to mojang last year they already sold over 100 million copies , and there 's also a bunch of people playing it illegally . 
  and there 's also the mobile game debate since they are rapidly becoming the biggest gaming market , specially thanks to asian countries according to data from last year . 
  my argument is that these are all , extremely accessible and free/very cheap games , in a global market 100.000 million is not an unrealistic number . 
  first off , [ in 2015 steam actually had 125 million active users ] ( https://www.vg247.com/2015/02/24/steam-has-over-125-million-active-users-8-9m-concurrent-peak/ ) , with a peak of 8.9 million concurrent users . 
  this was almost 2 years ago , [ just randomly looking today steam had a concurrent peak of 12,5 million users ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/stats/ ) ( might be higher on weekends ) , we can extrapolate that this could also mean an increase in overall steam active users . 
  that makes the steam platform way way bigger than league ever was and probably ever will be . 
  second , the 100 million number can and should be taken with a grain of salt when it comes to its importance , they count as active users anyone that plays a single game during the month , this would include the working dude that played 1 aram on a friday night because he was bored , or the guy that has n't touched the game in months but wanted to try a new champion in a match vs bots . 
  these people exist just to make riot look good when it comes to an overall number , even though they barely touch it or are involved in the game/esport scene . 
  i agree that games sold = / = active users ( which i usually use to criticise overwatch potential as an esport ) , but i was trying to demonstrate that games do reach insane numbers nowadays . 
  there 's steam bots ? 
  o_o why ? 
  what can bots farm with a steam account ? 
  the `` without bots '' comment was made by a rioter whose job is to identify bot accounts and even he said that some might slip through , still yeah nobody will talk negatively about their own freaking job lol, 
  like i said the number is pretty meaningless overall if it 's true , and even if it 's false at least it helps teams get new sponsors which will then increase the money that players get , so that 's a positive way to look at things . 
  still when it comes to esports all the big 4 ( apparently heartstone is huge as well ) are all pretty close when it comes to viewers/money , closer than their respective playerbases would be , which is also an interesting statistic to see , like if the 100 million is true , then 2/3 of their playerbase has no interest in esports , have no interest in their biggest tournament . 
  pretty hard to sell that 100 million as a potential viewership to broadcasters in that case . 
  you 're just dumb , riot is a genius implementing new ideas over and over again , that 's why they saw stuff like this as useless and removed custom items sets in the new client , riot is on the vangard of implementing new features into their game !, 
  should i point out the obvious sarcasm ? 
  much much worse ... the old client had custom item sets , a third party made an application that would inject the most used and highest winrate builds from champion.gg ( only high-elo players ) and would update itself with every patch , it was neat if you were playing a champion that you have n't touched in a while ... but , riot removed costum item sets from the new client `` because nobody uses it '' , and said they would help the third party so their application would still work , as far as i know nothing happened yet . 
  so ... instead of improving it the obvious solution is deleting it ? 
  sounds right . 
  [ last year their final had 2.1 million viewers overall ( including tv viewers , so believe it with a grain of salt ) , with 700.000 on streaming websites ] ( http://esportsobserver.com/brazilian-lol-final-attracts-larger-audience-tv-internet/ ) ... i know this is a circlejerk sub , but there 's easier things to shit on riot 's head with while having actual evidence instead of speculation of corruption . 
  archyes was right about one thing brazil tends to be very very corrupt , there 's less tech investment there for the same reason of less tech investment in the sea region , sometimes the investment you need to make with backdoor deals to build your business is not worth it . 
  also brazil is not the most politically stable country right now . 
  hey if there 's another investment boom in brazil like it happened pre-2008 more power to them , i would jump right into a plane and move there . 
  maybe if they also make it a little safer , i do n't wan na live in ` merica !, 
  well yeah most countries do have more dangerous zones than others ( including here in portugal ) , and to be fair most brazilians i know are upper middle-class university students and doctorate investigators , so their bad experiences there might not reflect most brazilian experiences , but the last statistics that came out ( in 2012 ) showed that brazil had an incredibly high homicide rate , like 20 times higher than most of europe . 
  since when are reddit comments always exclusively related to the op 's topic ? 
  yeah you guys lucked out on your spawn spot , you should have restarted a new map . 
  there 's already 8 bloodmoon skins , you could make 2 perfectly good comps with them :, 
  top - kennen vs shen, 
  jug - elise vs diana, 
  mid - yasuo vs twisted fate, 
  and you still have akali , talon and ~ ~ twisted fate ~ ~ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ca n't ^ ^ count, 
  as someone that used to main gnar , yasuo made me cry too many times already . 
  i hope the mods never update the rox tigers flair so that we will at least have something to remember them ; _ ;, 
  also the new icon is ugly as fuck , it looks like something from a 90s cereal commercial, 
  as a top lane main there 's nothing more satisfying than seeing your other lanes doing well without your help . 
  i know i know people like winning , but league really is a totally different game when everyone is winning or at least equal in gold/kills , people appear to actually have fun and want to play as a team . 
  the issue is that there 's no real comeback mechanics in league besides your enemy being dumb and making mistakes , every time riot tried to implement comeback mechanics they were mostly about turtling in your base and wait for them to make a mistake . 
  sure many people will say `` yeah but it 's bronze/silver/gold / plat/diamond they will eventually do a mistake '' , fine , but then you still have no active role in the comeback , you are just going with the flow and having a awful experience of just trying to stay in the game . 
  i would always prefer neutral objectives to possibly be the comeback mechanic , but my biggest issue right now is that kills and kill bounties are useless since riot removed their scalling , the only thing that scales is a team reward that caps at 90 gold , increasing this value would give an active objective for a coordinated team to comeback with . 
  this also affects pro-play since going for kills is less worth it than staying safe , maybe push the enemy out of lane for a while so you can get an objective , and i 'm sorry as much as i enjoy macroplay , it can get boring when more aggressive teams are shafted for their preferred method of play . 
  if you want a short moba go play heroes of the storm or vainglory , making league faster just because that 's what people want , results in what we are seeing of very onesided matches that you either wait anyway 40-50 minutes for the enemy to make a mistake or you convince 3 of your 4 teammates to surrender at 20 , which rarely happens and people start arguing . 
  i think the question is if other public figures will eventually be able to get verified as well , like prominent journalists/writers , video producers , other type of content creators ( youtubers/streamers/well known non-pro players like solorenektononly for example ) . 
  or will this be exclusive to people that work directly with riot and their partners . 
  i think it 's still snowbally but in a different way , it 's much more snowbally if you keep getting objectives , i think a perfect balance would be one that would allowed for both fighting comps ( both skirmishes/splitpush , and teamfights/engage ) and objective based comps ( siege comps , peel/avoid fighting ) , even though there is comps that can fit and play for both , right now playing for objectives is the most efficient way do win . 
  i never thought dota 2 should n't be talked here , both games are similar but also incredibly different if you observe them closely , mostly because of how some mechanics differ and both can learn a lot from eachother ( like the case you mentioned ) , i.e. 
  the dota2 vs league debate is childish . 
  well , in the case of journalists it would be easy to verify at least the members from more `` official '' news sources ( yahoo , thescore , espn ) , members of smaller websites/blogs would probably need a discussion between the mod team and the person in question , like how active they are in the community , how much do they publish and how it 's received in the sub , it 's your system and you have the right to the final decision though . 
  in the case of video producers/youtubers/streamers i think that yes a specific number of subscribers would be a fair limit for everyone , and it could be even a small objective of up and coming content creators . 
  you could even make a sticky once in a while with all the new content creators that reached the milestone and became verified , it would be a neat community interaction . 
  ^ ^ bigfan yes i realized that , the fact that riot has pretty good community management departments should help a lot getting a reddit user list of every prominent people in the scene for the launch . 
  the question was just because since the system will be implemented anyways expanding it to more of the community outside of esports players/casters would be really good . 
  when i was little all i wanted was to go work for national geographic , doing anything , i loved the magazine and the channel , i wanted to be a writer , or a photographer or do documentaries ... eventually that drifted to the back of my mind . 
  right now i do n't know what 's the saddest part , me never staying on that course or the current state of the great institution that national geographic was when i was growing up :\\, 
  people can bitch about the predictable story ( case in point : the oscars list thread in the first page right now ) , but i found it beautiful , it was a simple and nuanced story about the relationship between parents and sons , but also about loss and grief , i almost broke out crying while watching it next to my guy friends , and i 'm in no way an emotional person . 
  it was definitely one of my favorite movies of 2016 on a personal level , and i do hope it wins something , but at least being nominated should help it get some recognition . 
  god , i do n't remember much about that movie besides hating that scene at the end [ when she has to choose to kiss her highschool crush or tell who was the man that killed her , holy shit that scene ... ] ( #spoiler ), 
  it was twilight made by the guy that made lord of the fucking rings < __ <, 
  national geographic after years of losing money was bought by 21st century fox , who immediately fired 9 % of the staff ( 180 people ) . 
  i still own a bunch of their old issues from the 90s that my dad used to collect , and some of my uni teachers were editors and writers for the portuguese edition , kinda sad to see it go downhill :\\, 
  without wanting to bring politics into the discussion , the reason why the nordic countries have such an high happiness rating is that their social systems allow for people to take personal risks while being able to get back on their feet if it does n't work , but socialism is like a bad word outside of europe so i do n't know . 
  i would agree with them if the game was totally balanced and every champion was equally viable , but it 's not and they are not . 
  add the fact that they are also increasing the bans which directly increases the number of champions a person needs to own to play ranked , + how they keep balancing champions based on pro play while not buffing other cause they are overbearing in low elo and the result is a shitstorm of a mess . 
  and going on a tangent i find it funny their argument that you can be the best player in the world with a low champion pool , meanwhile faker , the guy riot loves to put in everything is undeniably the best player right now exactly because of how huge his champion pool in competitive is . 
  you missed a much better one :, 
   grinding implies that you are doing something you dont enjoy in order to reach a state which will be enjoyable . 
  this was said in the context of league not having griding, 
  let me try ... * coughcough *, 
  but see , it 's true that you do n't need many champions to be in the top of the ladder , just look !, 
  the 2 top spots are riven one-trick ponies !, 
  hey , annie bot is challenger and he only plays annie !, 
  we are right !, 
  ignore the fact that happens thanks to how inherently good some champions are to climb in the unorganised environment that is yoloq . 
  ~ some riot official, 
  they probably have to keep the model as similar as possible to the original skin , and it appears that the dog replaced a wolf which is why it looks so weird , it 's a wolf body with the `` doge '' face, 
  and he got more well known as the director that fucked his main star ( kristen stewart ) than by the generic action/fantasy movie they did together . 
  i did n't mind she getting shoved in don jon ... 
  do n't go down that rabbit hole it will give you cancer mate , they created `` subclasses '' ( anotations of what they really are were made by me ) :, 
  | tanks - vanguards ** ( dive tanks ) ** , wardens ** ( protect tanks ) **, 
  | fighters - juggernauts ** ( low mobility dps ) ** , divers ** ( high mobility dps ) **, 
  | slayers - assassins ** ( burst damage ) ** , skirmishers ** ( consistent damage ) **, 
  | mages - burst mages ** ( ... it 's ap burst ) ** , battle mages ** ( short range dps ) ** , artillery mages ** ( high range dps ) **, 
  | controllers - enchanters ** ( buff/debuff mages ) ** , disruptors ** ( actual control mages ) **, 
  | marksmen - marksmen ** ( all ranged ad dps ) **, 
  it 's all useless names because they look cool when you call their new champion camile a diving fighter or a skirmishing slayer -_- . 
  case in point juggernauts are ad melee dps with low mobility , divers are ad melee dps with high mobility , marksmen are really just ad ranged dps , they are all just ad high dps champions . 
  like i said , this is purely a marketing thing , in no context would people say `` hey we an artillery mage would be way better in our comp than a battle mage '' , but it 's useful if you say `` welcome our new battle mage , ryze - the rune mage '' because it looks pretty in those champion spotlight pages they do . 
  it 's also pretty useless to classify champions this way since many can be defined by 2 or more of these stupid qualifications so this says fuck all about them . 
  it also causes hilarious bullshit since riot themselves classify champions with at least 2 base classes , going back to the ryze example , according to riot is a mage ( primary ) and a fighter ( secondary ) , so he 's a battle mage juggernaut ? 
  ( since he has low mobility ) what da fuck does that tell you about ryze ? 
  dota 2 's classification is far far far superior , and could be easily copied , but rito needs it 's edgy shit .
