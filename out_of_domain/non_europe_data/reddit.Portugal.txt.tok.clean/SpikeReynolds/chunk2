  spike spiegel ( cowboy bebop ) and malcolm reynolds ( firefly ) - and so i 've been using this name for pretty much everything since then . 
  that vlad was even creepier than he usually is , i feel like i should call chris hansen d :,

  pigeon already posted below they are doing it ... eventually ... soon ^ ^ ^ tm, 
  actually , does n't riot record that ? 
  :\\ we probably wo n't see something like that on `` sounds of the game '' . 
  most of veigar lines kinda sound ... wrong in this context :, 
  [ what 's black and blue and is about to show you the definition of pain ?!, 
  ] ( http://images.wikia.com/leagueoflegends/images/6/61/veigar.joke.ogg ), 
  well at least we know lulu is into some kinky stuff :|, 
  i usually can duel 1v1 trundle 's ok with champs with an aa block mechanic like fiora , jax or panths , just walk away when he ults and wait a while . 
  that pillar is annoying though . 
  sidenote : it 's hilarious watching a trundle trying to bite a fiora and walking away confused for losing health instead :3, 
  [ velocity used him last year vs clg ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czhm7hk62qe ) not to great success though < . <,

  he means 8:14:00 ~ like 8 hours not minutes, 
  chobra ( ogn caster ) made [ a blog about promise 's situation and the problem in general in korea ] ( http://willchobra.tumblr.com/post/80360011437/promise-and-what-that-says-about-korea ) , it 's a really interesting read . 
  to be fair , i see tons of adc just dodging 'cause they do n't like their support , or someone wants to try an off-meta champ , i had a queue with a full team except adc , we waited 30 minutes for one , 7 dodged :\\, 
  if the players in his games send riot tickets with screenshots of the chat it will probably be way faster , since he seems to be a pretty well known troll in high-elo the riot ban hammer should be way faster with enough evidence . 
  this gives an all new perspective to his ~ ~ crabs ~ ~ voidlings and his space aids < . < ... is the void like std universe or something ? 
  this gif made me watch all the archer seasons in the last 2 days ... #noregrets, 
  is n't heroes of the storm a very casual moba ? 
  most people i 've seen that got into the beta say the game is fun , but does n't have much potential for competition like other mobas :\\, 
  well it was pretty smart to throw harmon 's name in front of the show , it made me and i bet many people watch it , they both have a similar type of humor ( even though being very distinct ... if that makes any sense < . < ) and thanks to people like you we now have another awesome writer to follow :d, 
  and now i remember one of the things i actually hated in me3 -- ' god , if they wanted an hot `` geek '' girl hostess get olivia munn , at least she can act . 
  that 's just the enemy fountain in dominion , it seems that in that spot the fountain does n't insta destroy you ... i guess you can use this to kill a low enemy going to heal at the fountain , but then you are stuck there xd, 
  did it in 1 month as well , not unemployed , just uni student during my finals month ... i regret nothing < . <, 
  my exact thought , i do n't own even 1/3 of the champs and do n't play most of the ones i already own , why would you wan na buy champs you do n't even like ? 
  but then you see an high-elo player demolish everyone with rengar and think `` hmm that seems easy , lets buy rengar !, 
  '' ... you proceed to feed and suck hard as balls with rengar and you have him there looking at you in champ select , mocking your lack of skill ; _ ; ... 
  sorry , a case where punctuation actually made it more confusing xd i meant i was n't unemployed ( nor was i employed ) but something similar ( * or worse according to some people * ) which is a university student . 
  why ... why taunt us like that ? 
  the world needs a video like that , i need phreak doing a viking techno dance for my life to be complete ; __ ;, 
  and it seems that it 's an album coming out june 3rd http://na.pentakillmusic.com/en/,

  somebody already [ found the full album with previews ] ( https://www.hmvdigital.ca/releases/3489928 ) for all the songs, 
  one step closer to real sports !, 
  wp riot !, 
  you still saved me from losing my match last week , so thanks !, 
  it 's [ bruno mars - runaway baby ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ww-8jvxt5q&amp;feature=kp ) ^ ^ i ^ ^ thought ^ ^ it ^ ^ was ^ ^ a ^ ^ kpop ^ ^ band ^ ^ v.v, 
  but ap tankplank is so much more fun , them baits with 10 % health and eat a orange to stay ' k, 
  1 ) i play mega passive and dodge those retarded lighting balls , while losing farm and still getting hit by some, 
  2 ) or i play a all-in champ and he just hammers me away and runs from me v.v, 
  never played that matchup , and you pretty much outscale him late game , thanks for the tip :d, 
  usually jayces rush tear and have zero mana issues after that :\\ sidenote : i could try lee , but my mechanics with him are laughable xd, 
  yep probably the most success i had vs a jayce was with fiora and quinn ( cause overall better kiting and burst than jayce ) but your team always expects the toplaner to be the damage tanker , which fiora/quinn definitely are n't and jax right now is better at deleting squishies and surviving then both . 
  pantheon is my favorite `` fuck this i 'm going to carry this game '' - top laner , but that ult `` fix '' really fucked up his catching people potential , still trying to get used to it :\\, 
  so the exact opposite of the mega aggressive , tons of kills , chinese lol ? 
  o.o that 's pretty interesting actually, 
  the difference is that while fiora is easily shutdown during lanning phase with an early gawk or a mistake , making her useless for the rest of the match , that never actually happens to jax in my opinion , he always comes back :\\ but that 's also probably cause of lack of communication in soloq that does n't take advantage of a shutdowned jax . 
  so you do n't care about the actual gameplay mechanics ? 
  the games themselves have tons of mechanical differences :|, 
  [ kinda relevant ] ( http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/originals/b3/c5/53/b3c5539a2f2644dec4b2bb159df0b0c1.jpg ),

  i 'm pretty sure its a reference to smaug :|, 
  it 's true , it talked about it in the last summoner 's insight he was on . 
  `` we 've disable the champion yorick due to a known problem '' ~ i think they will just keep him disable until the rework , nobody would actually have a problem with this i think xd, 
   maybe it 's time for you to man up and play some ~ ~ tryndamere ~ ~ mantheon . 
  fixed that for you bro . 
  the wolfs probably asked riot to disable him so airwaks could n't pick him again xd, 
  it 's seems to be a bug with karthus passive which ca n't use abilities when there 's an yorick in the game . 
  so ogn made 2 video analysis of the same teamfight ? 
  [ this one which is actually interesting ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1uxjxmaztm ) , and this parody just to use that song < _ <, 
  they are changing the attacks of dragon and baron , which are a pretty big deal still :\\, 
  [ me too ] ( http://wombocombo.net/images/games/quizgame/rank_6.jpg ) d : thanks for the link !, 
  this should keep me busy for a few hours ... studying is for the weak ! ^ ^ ^ rip ^ ^ ^ finals, 
  right now , my bet is shiptur and zion , also the lord of wards crumbzz is starting to get a bigger following recently as well . 
  they are a solid team and aside of qtpie 's thrashtalking , they all seem to be pretty nice guys . 
  handjobs might be more time efficient ... [ they did the math ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zywyxwkrhg ) ^ ^ siliconvalleysogood, 
  [ solwolf is pretty well known for his break the meta series and has 233.000 subscribers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/solitarywolfxd ), 
  that 's just a well known death recap bug , it happens a lot as well where it shows flash doing damage , the magic damage was probably from the sunfire cape yes . 
  i always do this , i usually let him farm until he 's 1 level below me , or when he calls his jungler to gawk me , in that case the deal is off . 
  once the other guy actually pushed the lane , and my jungler wanted to gawk when i was 3 levels above the other guy , i went back to my tower , pinged my jungler to stop and warned the other lanner . 
  more players should be like you !, 
  ... but seriously , so many people do n't know how to freeze and zone the other lanner . 
  but in this context that 's just damn right evil xd, 
  i usually build it on my pantheon top , the cdr is awesome on him , he has mana issues in prolonged teamfights or skirmishes , and you can tank quite a few tower shots with your passive and with tons of armor if needed , also an early glacial shroud really helps in the rare occasion when you are having an hard lanning phase . 
  finish it has 3rd or 4th item . 
  time to see people pick her as adc , die a bunch of times in the botlane using vault to engage , or ulting in the beginning of tfs vaulting to the middle of the enemy team and insta click r again -_- ' so cringe worthy ... 
  it 's great to proc your passive in duels ( especially in the top lane , which is where i mostly play her , so i 'm kinda bias ) , but not at the cost of putting you in a bad position and leaving you with no escapes after . 
  you could vault the enemy if valor tags them with the passive , you aa and get a double proc with vault , which deals a great burst , otherwise in a cc heavy botlane ( like leona or thresh ) vaulting to harrass and to engage ( which is even worse thing to do at the start of a teamfight ) can put you in a really bad position and get instagibbed ... 
  from my personal experience , vaulting someone which later flashes to the middle of their team is the worse v __ v, 
  aoe q with blind and an execute ult , valor fits perfectly in this team :3, 
  did n't we do this already with rammus that was at 0 % ban rate at the beginning of the season ? 
  finally a rational answer on / r/leagueoflegends !, 
  seriously the backlash from the last couple of days seemed like 12 year old kids complaining about not getting the exact icecream they wanted . 
  worlds this year will be huge , and from the perspective of someone that wo n't be attending but watching from the good old euw , ca n't wait to see all the different countries and communities interact with esports . 
  besides like many people ( including riot ` ers ) already said , worlds will be a 5 weeks deal , 90 % of the people going to watch worlds live would never go the entire 5 weeks , so why not let people that ca n't go to korea have to opportunity to watch it live as well , while establishing a greater relationship between league and other countries ? 
  no , never !, 
  he still lives in our hearts !, 
  that 's not the only bug , she still takes damage when she ults herself when it 's supposed to make her untargetable , every time she 's free i love playing her , but i ca n't bring myself to buy her because of this bug , it makes it useless to use it on yourself since you basically just cc yourself :\\, 
  which is a shame , cause she 's a really fun and different champion to play , and her ult can be use to change a teamfight in your favor ... if it was n't more bugged than syndra 's balls ... 
  sometimes when syndra throws her balls directly at your face , even though they hurt they do n't stun you like you expect from having balls shoved at your face . ^ ^ amidoingthisright ? 
  but but but , what if you do n't like either one 's personalities and just ignore both streams ? 
  lets be fair , in comparison to sirchez everyone in league is toxic . 
  edit : holy hell the sirchez hate train < _ < ^ ^ whathaveidone, 
  to be fair , every time he uses spellvamp singed he warns the viewers that it 's something only he can do because he 's very experienced with the champ and knows it 's limits ( like trick 's udyr ) . 
  you forgot step 5.2 - put him in the increasing list of champions you regret buying 'cause you ca n't play them and qq, 
  know to many female lol players that would definitely be affected < _ < even the straight ones ... 
  this patch i was always iffy on banning her , since it felt like an useless ban ... thanks riot for making my decision so much easier .
