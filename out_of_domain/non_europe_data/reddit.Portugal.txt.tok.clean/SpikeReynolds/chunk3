  it 's just extremely frustrating to play her on the top lane, 
  ... ironic since my favorite champs are quinn and panths but still d :, 
  a ranged bruiser that can poke the entire lanning phase and burst you with pounce if you get marked , also can heal herself and has a dash every 5 seconds . 
  can riot then stop trying to make quinn an adc and put her as a bruiser so she can get the same treatment ? 
  yes , marc `` tryndamere '' merrill and brandon `` ryze '' beck are the co-founders of riot . 
  also a bit o / r/gaming ... `` hey guys look at what i just did in this videogame , i 'm awesome/awful/funny ! '', 
  ~ 50 % of the daily posts, 
  good positioning + braum shield and w + lulu 's ult and shield . 
  qt was a unstoppable and unkilable machine gun o_o it 's awesome seeing adc 's starting to really carrying games again :d, 
  they are my favorite underdogs in lcs right now , they are all so happy to be able to be there playing with other very strong teams , also prolly 's personality is just downright awesome :d, 
  you could say that about several other players in lcs , but you ca n't just change players and expect a team to improve as we already seen this split ^ ^ * cough * tsm * cough * , complexy has several problems they need to fix , not just their midlaner . 
  yasuo 's wall has a pretty big cd , and both abilities can be baited , just like what happened with braum 's wall in the last teamfight , please stop with the circlejerk about riot bad design choices without solid arguments . 
  i have no knowledge about the chinese scene but the hosts make it very approachable :d great show !, 
  definitively watching kelsey in si made me way more interested in this . 
  sidenote : holy shit , people complain about thoorin , hughbo is way worse in bm , one thing is pointing problems in a player another is just downright beating them to death while saying they are the shittiest players ever o_o ^ ^ * ido n'tlikehim *, 
  to be fair my comment was mainly about when i started watching , which was in the middle of an ongoing discussion , and you were ranting about a bunch of different players . 
  it was a bad first impression from my point of view . 
  but i did enjoy the following more in-depth discussions about the strengths and differences between the different regions , and your arguments which were less ranting and had more thoughtful comments about it . 
  as someone that really enjoys this type of discussion in league you guys won a new regular viewer . 
  samsung blue literally rising to the top \u0ca0 _ \u0ca0, 
  well they did make [ this pretty cool animation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px_iqkexq9g ) for season 3 worlds . 
  sidenote : i miss meteos zac ; __ ;, 
  the c9 crew always streams in the most awkward hours for me :\\ i need to find vods of meteos on zac , i 've been wanting to see someone try him now with the new jungle item , thanks for the tip :d, 
  hmm ... you can see it on the left , you did n't blacked his name there xd, 
  edit : his name is kinda ironic btw ... 
  god , 20 minutes afk farm jungle , comes out , triple kill bot , goes mid , gets kill , comes top and makes me scream and run like a little girl 'cause i do n't understand where so much damage is coming from ; __ ;, 
  to be fair you can only reliably trade with q and autos pre-6 , your w has a very slow animation , and your stun is not enough early to let your w hit them ( unless they walk to it of course ) . 
  safe farming for gold and stack ap is always better than put yourself in a position that gets you out of lane . 
  yup , go vel ` koz supp , buy only magic pen items after sighstone , do more damage than your ap carry :|, 
  bruiser nidalee would disagree, 
  her q is not even the issue , the problem is that she can build ad , a.a. you to half health if you are melee champ ( or outright zone you from farming ) and exectute you in cougar form , and you ca n't even build resistance to deal with her , cause she 's the perfect hybrid damage dealer ( remember when riot said they hated hybrid builds 'cause they had no counterplay ? ) . 
  other poke champs like quinn , pantheon , ryze , jayce , you can build around them or go with a sustain champ , but nidalee has great poke , great disangage ( and a heal ) and does n't use mana in cougar form , it 's just bullshit . 
  theoddone only seriously talks about things that change the jungle or junglers ( which is his main role so it 's understandable ) in this last patch he just said gg rip lucian when he saw the range and completely ignored the e changes :\\, 
  what ? 
  o_o did you forget the '' / s '' ? 
  just install [ the add-on ] ( http://alientube.co/ ) that shows comments from reddit threads where the video was posted , way better way to enjoy youtube . 
  sidenote : it seems this video was also posted on gaymers subreddit with the title `` as a househusband , i enjoy this over `` the view '' . 
  also . . snoopeh * swoon * '' < . <, 
  you play it instead of talon ap mid ? 
  the cdr build is a waste , you can kite as hard with only 20 % cdr from ionian boots and masteries . 
  at level 5 e has 10 secds cd , 8 secds with the cdr . 
  e + aa ( -4 scds ) + q + aa ( -4 scds ) , is enough to reset your e , just keep rotating q and w when they are up , and you can constantly dash every ~ 4 seconds during teamfights . 
  build pure damage items to empower your qs and passive shots , in my opinion ie and bloodthirster seems to be the perfect combination , still have n't been able to really try it though :\\ . 
  lucian seems even more an ad caster now , which is really fun in my opinion . 
  also , in teamfights tristana would never use her ult and escape to run away from the enemy adc , when you probably have 2 tanks or bruisers going for her face at the same time :\\, 
  in my opinion full damage is the best option with 20 % cdr, 
  5 % cdr from masteries + 15 % cdr from boots of lucidity lets you keep e constantly up ( at level 5 ) , you can just combo [ e ] + aa ( -4 scds ) + [ q ] or [ w ] + aa ( -4 scds ) , to reset your e , just keep rotating q and w when they are up , and you can constantly dash every ~ 4 seconds during teamfights . 
  for the rest of the build , in my opinion you should maximize your q damage ( which has a 120 % bonus ad ratio ) and you double proc passive . 
  you can rush ie for max early damage , build bloodthirster for sustain , and a last whisper for penetration . 
  the rest of the build is more fuzzy , maybe a trinity force if fed to use the shen proc ( or even an iceborn for permaslows ) , or more tanky items since you are going to be very close to everyone in fights . 
  ionian boots -  ie -  bloodthirster -  last whisper -  trinity force [ or ] banshee 's, 
  probably has to do with `` cleansing '' slows and adds more procs of his passive , also think it 's a longer dash so he can dash more walls than vayne can . 
  well , it does n't seem to be that bad for him in high elo either , according to lolking ( which is n't that great of a source but still ) in platinum , diamond and challenger ranked , lucian win-rate also increased :\\, 
  aside from being both league-related parodies of the same song , the lyrics are completely different from one another < _ <, 
  because his shield blocks the first source of damage , any source of damage , and reduces the next ones , it 's not like yasuo 's walls which blocks only projectiles ( and stuff like kayle 's e or syndra 's balls actually go through ), 
  there 's nothing op in tf , he has a huge map presence with it 's ult , but even that has counterplay like we saw in the eg vs clg match . 
  the nami pick made no sense , a morgana would be way better vs tf and braum . 
   other than hai ~ ~ getting caught ~ ~ baiting the enemy team, 
  hai the true mvp ^ ^ jk, 
  ziggs still here , xerath and lux coming back ... must spam doom bot games to improve my dodge skills < __ <, 
  honestly i think the problem with dominion is that people just have no idea what to do in that mode , i tried it a couple of times and every time i tried to coordinate with my team something they just kept going wherever they wanted . 
  it 's even more frustrating than sr :\\, 
  ranked team in dominion could possibly be pretty cool , soloqueue ranked on the other hand do n't see how it can work . 
  again i 've played less then 10 games in dominion , so i do n't know , but can soloqueue teams actually coordinate something it does n't seem to be a mode where 1 person can hyper carry a team ? 
  by `` biggest event in esports history '' , which by itself it 's a really bad statement to make , i presume he means because of the prize pool . 
  still it 's just a editorial , e.i. 
  one man 's opinion . 
  my problem with it is that even though he 's comparing dota vs lol , when talking about esports you ca n't just ignore the rest of the scene , even more when evo was 2 weeks ago :\\, 
  someone needs to post that darude video on / r/cringe , they would love it < . <, 
  they need to give him some sort of self peel , in the increasing league of mobility creep malzahar ^ ^ and ^ ^ morde is the only mage without some sort of self peel . 
  in my opinion , letting him walk during his ult , inside the range limit , would be a huge buff to him defensively and offensively . 
  probably twin shadows , or might be trying the shitty ardent censer that works with his heal :\\, 
  to be fair you only get banned from leaving/dc ` ing if you do it 2 ~ 3 times in a small spam of time . 
  if for some reason you dc , just do n't go back for while , by going back you are possibly ruining the game of the other 4 people by dc ` ing again and possibly getting banned . 
  high-elo on the other hand gets repeatedly ddos , so that 's another issue , but not something 99,9999 % of the league community has to deal with . 
  but by doing that you are directly influencing the experience of the other players just by being selfish . 
  there 's no rules against it , but there 's an always changing `` best way '' to play the game , which should help you climb the ladder . 
  you can do all those things in normals and have a smaller impact in the other players experience , so why do it in ranked ? 
  so you use [ sky 's dst method ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz7twprxyry ) ? 
  patch 4.13, 
  leona : r - now is a global stun , and disables animations . 
  i seriously have my doubts on how good of an improvement this is , especially since the last few weeks you see gleeb talking a lot during pick & bans and during the matches . 
  tsm biggest problem is their shotcalling , which was xspecial job , and gleeb seemed to be trying to fill the role . 
  it does n't matter if lustboy follows loco 's instructions by the letter during the match if the rest of the team does n't respect his shotcalling , which is probably hard when you just start playing with someone . 
  to be fair , the positioning of piglet during the second match was really horrible during the dragon fights , he got trapped twice inside the dragon pit :\\, 
  but then what about veigar ? 
  1 shooting the enemy ap carry is the entire point of his kit and dfg is pretty much a must for him :\\, 
  after the interview krepo did with travis , we would definitely have enough drama for a show if they followed eg and what 's happening in their house/organization . 
  also col would be awesome , everyone loves a good underdogs narrative , also ... more prolly !, 
  :d which according to brokenshard is actually very serious talking about the game , outside of interviews and streams . 
  why are people down voting gay for shushei ? 
  the sacrilege !, 
  like everything in life there 's pros and cons about this , sure google is pretty much monopolizing the internet ^ ( all hail the google overloards ! ), 
  and sure imposing google + on users really sucks , and the youtube comments are basically the cancer of the internet . 
  but they have the money to improve twitch tech-wise , stability is a huge issue with twitch as we can see every week with lcs ( which is why i watch the stream on youtube ) and it gets worse with big events , so that might be a big improvement . 
  on the other hand , no idea how monetizing the content creators will end up if they join youtube and twitch :\\, 
  because they probably are :| on the other hand the discussion around the business practices in chinese culture in this thread are rather interesting , which makes for a weird mix of comments though < _ <, 
  true , as much as i love to hate that champ and keep calling him broken ... i still 100 % feed and lose if i try to play him ... so i just ban him whenever i can so i do n't have to deal with him :d, 
  it 's more interesting the part where they are talking about alliance with a strong lead prefers to play safe instead of going for risky plays , or tower dives ... and then ... mejais , mejais everywhere !, 
  :d makes me think if they actually took the advice of monte about pushing the lead even more when you have it .
