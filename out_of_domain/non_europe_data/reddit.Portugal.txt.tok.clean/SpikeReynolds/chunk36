  so your social behavior ( relationships you have with people , behavior toward government ) do n't actually impact your credit score , like extra credit insinuates ? 
  so blizzard is justified by implementing an anti-consumer system because they can get more money with a exclusive loot box system ? 
  they could make the recolors loot box exclusive , or just make more interesting stuff than player icons and sprays . 
  they would still get paid for selling the skins directly , people feel comfortable paying 10 to 20 dollars for a skin , if it 's something they really want . 
  better for them , worse for the consumer . 
  which is the entire point of this discussion . 
  seriously this system just over complicates things and does n't help anyone understand what certain champions can or ca n't do just by seeing a stupid tag name . 
  [ dota 2 has a way better system by classifying heroes by multiple roles ] ( http://dota2.gamepedia.com/role ) , which not only gives you a better idea of the hero but also what to expect from his abilities . 
  case in point : do you understand better alistar 's role in a team if you classify him as a warden , or as a durable | support | initiator ? 
  like i said , before my time , but i can confirm riot did try to force lcs players to play nothing but league of legends on-stream , this was around the time hs 's beta came out and a bunch of pro 's were playing it between games . 
  the issue is that these titles tell you nothing about the champion 's role unless you go to the wiki or riot 's page and see what a juggernaut is supposed to be . 
  juggernaut/vangard/wardens / battlemages/enchanters are all meaningless titles , at least burst mage and diver give you some context to what the champion does gameplay wise . 
  well that 's obvious , i made that argument when they announced the classes initially , it looks much cooler to say , for example : `` welcome our new ** battle mage ** demonfights , a high dps late game champion with a dark and mysterious past ! '' . 
  it connects the player to a specific power fantasy . 
  my point is n't to just say dota  league , i think dota 's approach is better at communicating the heroes attributes to players than riot 's approach right now . 
  but i also do n't want to copy it since how heroes work and how champions work is n't a 1-to-1 comparison, 
  it does n't affect a hero , it just tells players the most probable game play pattern that a specific champion will follow , for example , zac is a tank with high self sustain and whose most characteristic ability allows him to engage from very far away and initiate or disrupt teamfights , so according to riot he 's a vanguard ( a tank/diver ) , from seeing that tag next to him players can understand more or less what he does . 
  this is mostly for players that do n't have hundreds of hours and do n't know all the specifics of each champion . 
  my argument is that these random titles instead of direct attributes ( vanguard vs tank/diver ) do the exact opposite . 
  in movies maybe ( even though i still think he 's pretty great in 28 days later and sunshine ) , but is n't peaky blinders viewed as a really good tv show ? 
  i keep forgetting to watch it ... 
  honestly their loot system is the most disgusting anti-consumer manipulative gambling simulator out there right now , i lost a ton of respect for tb ( the white knight of consumer rights ) when he said he was fine with the loot system `` because it 's only cosmetics '' , as if forcing people to gamble with money to get what they want is n't scummy as fuck ( when there 's no other way to obtain those items directly ) . 
  most of blizzards updates and marketing is `` hey kid you really want this shinny new limited edition skin , you better grind your ass off or better off , gamble 50 $ for the chance of getting it !, 
  you even get that extra dopamine rush from gambling your money away , it 's a win win situation ! '', 
  edit : wow they are actually masturbating blizzard for how good the loot system is in their main sub , the post was even gilded , this is fucking pathetic ...

   would you rather they sold skins directly ? 
  yes ... is this seriously a ridiculous notion ? 
  tell me another game with microtransactions that does n't allow you to buy cosmetics directly or at least buy the in-game currency with real money . 
   they 'd inflate the prices ,, 
  people pay 10-20 dollars for skins in other games , i think it 's a fair price if you really like and want a particular skin , if you want to waste those 10 dollars on loot boxes maybe you get a better deal , it 's all about options . 
   or remove the lootboxes and charge for new heroes and maps , lovely , now we have a split playerbase , which is cancerous for a games longevity . 
  i never argued to remove loot boxes , most game with those systems currently still allow you to purchase cosmetics directly through a game store or player market . 
  loot box gambling systems have their place , you might get a better deal with them than spending money directly , but that gambling system should never be the only option . 
  i 'm fine with a regional clash , as long as it was a normal tournament ladder with bo5 . 
  it 's still `` international '' , maybe eu vs na would develop a different meta that might be able to defeat the koreans , but they decided to make another showmatch like all-stars ... 
  i mostly remember the debate between tb and jim sterling during the beta , i think tb approved even more after blizzard allowed people to purchase the limited timed skins with in-game currency . 
  his philosophy as always been as long as it does n't affect gameplay he does n't care , even though it does n't stop being shitty consumer practice even if it does n't affect gameplay ... 
  i 'm in no way taking blame from other developers that are using this as well , valve is now being force to regulate it because their micro transaction system created an entire outside-the-game gambling industry , which is even worse . 
  but like i said , at least people playing dota/cs/tf can purchase the items they want from the marketplace . 
  overwatch is using a similar system but siphoning all their possible costumers to a gambling system , i personally think it 's unethical and a shitty business practice , specially since their audience probably skews to younger players . 
  the discussion is around these systems being consumer friendly or not , i argue that they are n't specially in ow since it 's cosmetics are locked exclusively behind a gambling system . 
  i could also argue that it is n't ethical from blizzard to push their players , which probably skew to the younger-side , to this type of system just because it gives them the higher revenue , specially since the game has a 13 + age rating . 
  gambling in gaming right now is heavily unregulated and that has to change , people can argue that loot boxes are n't gambling , but they still push all the same buttons that a slot machine does in a person 's brain . 
  anecdotal evidence ca n't really be used for this case , we know the actual probability because of the new chinese law , so if you look from a general perspective you would see that most people would get on average 2 legendary skins for 20 boxes , outliars like you and people that might get zero are what makes it a gambling system . 
  something that people have n't said yet , is that these subclasses sound like rejected titles from [ league 's champion mastery classifications ] ( http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/champion_mastery#titles ), 
  and they do repeat lol . 
  a player can have a warden level mastery of alistar a warden class champion !, 
  they originally only created 5 tiers , but it was so easy to get them that people started complaining and they had to create 2 new tiers , as you can see most titles for tier 6 and 7 or are ridiculous or make no sense when compared with the first 5, 
   what is it that you 'd hope to see in new pre-game systems ? 
  what are your thoughts on the current runes and masteries ? 
  ** | masteries **, 
  the mastery tree is in a good spot , good variety in most games * ( no more 10 thunderlords ) * but also good variety choices for some champions , but like they said there 's issues with some champions only being able to utilize 1 mastery , this should n't be too bad as long as the mastery actively changes the way the champion can be played or feel . 
  in the example of malzahar the extra tic damage is n't very satisfying , meanwhile dft felt extremely good with jhin ( pre-nerf ) , this mastery could be more engaging if it was a `` finish them off '' mastery like it happened with jhin , by making the tic true damage that only activates after you dealt x % of their health * ( this is just an example , this might be way too broken in some cases ) * . 
  ** | runes **, 
  2.1 what i want ? 
  remove the rune system , and spread their power between base stats ( like they did 2 year ago by giving everyone extra early armor ) and the more lackluster mastery options ( i 'm talking about non-keystone masteries ) . 
  it 's a useless ip sink , and a few extra dollars for riot because people need to buy rune pages . 
  and it 's already mostly solved for all champions resulting in very little actual choice if you bother to copy them from op.gg . 
  also , the fact that they are locked and need grinding to get , results in this `` possibility of choice '' not even existing for most players . 
  riot still wants runes ? 
  fine ... make them impactful , similar to keystones , quintessences are supposed to be the keystone equivalent for runes but they are just a few extra numbers in stats , that 's not engaging at all . 
  create more interesting and interactive runes and less stat boosts runes . 
  i do agree with riot that this system should revolve around what you are planning for the early game and have less impact in the mid and late game . 
  ** sidenote : summoner 's **, 
  please create more , ktxbai, 
   that 's not sport that 's a videogame . 
  holy shit i 've been bamboozled !, 
  i always thought i was playing a sport when it appears that dota and league are ... oh no ... videogames :o, 
  well , i do n't like it , i also think riot 's inclusion of the gemstone skins to their loot system is also ridiculous . 
  but at least you still have the option to buy most of the other sets/skins directly , while in overwatch you have no choice but buy loot boxes . 
  i should introduce my bronze 4 league communist housemate to hots , maybe he can become pro in it . 
  but i do n't want to start a debate on how communism is misunderstood and we need to start a revolution in the moba genre :\\, 
  see my second paragraph , people are saying in the thread that op.gg did n't reset at the start of the season for every other region but na , so people that played last year but have n't touched it this year are getting counted into that number . 
  ranked numbers are the only number we are access too . 
  why are you focusing on eu ? 
  na is the only stable number that we can see right now because apparently they did n't reset the ranked number at the start of the season . 
  are you all just ignoring the second part of my post saying that the numbers for the rest of the regions are not correct apparently because they did n't reset the number at the start of the season ? 
  was n't sc2 one of the games selected ? 
  that 's probably why they are bitching about the selection of players/teams . 
  really ? 
  i thought kespa was a governmental division , so pretty much all korean esports had to go through them, 
  does n't matter , now faker will earn a ton more money specially with the new rivals tournament !, 
  oh wait , those tournaments have zero prize pool ? ... teams are forced to go by riot ? 
  it 's a for fun , and they are paid in `` brand exposure '' ? 
  ok nevermind then ... 
  the point is not the player number , but the fact that it 's decreasing , something that people have been saying for years , but right now it 's apparently true ( again , at least in na ) . 
  also , i 've played league way more than dota , if that helps ... 
  and they will definitely open more spots , the franchised league will be 12 or 14 probably , the lpl is starting its franchise this split and already said that it would expand spring split 2018 . 
  the extra spots will be expensive as fuck though . 
  and this is not counting the streaming deals , he 's streaming 2 or 3 times a week exclusively on a chinese streaming platform and they also rebroadcast the stream on twitch and he has between 50 ~ 100k viewers just on twitch . 
  you are seriously underestimating faker 's value and forgetting that skt is one of the biggest telecommunications company in korea . 
  reingover is the highest paid player in lcs right now and he 's being paid 700k by team liquid according to news from a couple of months ago . 
  vc money is one hell of a drug . 
  are you just ignoring the part that reignover gets paid 700k to play in na , where esports is an even bigger niche than in korea ? 
  also complexity 's manager confirmed a 4 months ago that [ `` tier 1 dota players have nowhere near the level of salaries/incentives that tier 1 lol players have '' ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/dota2/comments/5l9uje/congrats_to_universe_for_becoming_the_all_time/dbumfd2/ ) . 
  i do n't understand why people in this sub have such a difficulty understanding why some of these guys are getting paid ludicrous amounts of money . 
  korea has more than double the amount of american league players , that 's why it 's more niche in na than kr , na is only the 4th almost 5th ( since brasil is growing ) biggest region .
