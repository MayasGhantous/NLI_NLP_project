  my initial argument was against blackdevill 's claim that faker earn 300k , which is ridiculous . 
  better yet , why are you watching a podcast with the youtube drama chasers , pew die pie-light and half of the `` doing random shit is funny '' - duo ? 
  because the cc from quinn 's q is nearsight not blind ... different debuffs different effects . 
   looking at the stream stuff some models look remade or well higher detail ( whatevs ) so they do n't look nearly as bad as in-game . 
  * looks at lulu and udyr *, 
  i 'm not sure about that mate , those are some mobile game level shit models right there . 
  i wonder how much control seth killian will have over is team at riot . 
  while riot has been very `` player-aligned '' , their balance decisions go against the interests of competition and what pro-players want , case in point : completely removing the option to lane swap at the start of the game because it was something that did n't happen in non-pro matches , and was n't `` interactive enough '' for viewers . 
  specially when galio can work as a way better malph ult ... also i think he might be mini-rework during the divers rework . 
   removed laneswaps kinda made players interact with each other ... 
  hmm debatable , it made laners fight eachother again , but you still rarely see any kills before level 6 unless someone missplays super hard . 
  most of the times the first kill is around the 8-10 minutes when the lane swap would stop and teams would go to standard lanes again . 
  they also created an asymmetrical map by making the bot towers weaker , that plus since first tower gives so much gold , they pretty much locked the duo laners to be bot at the start of the game in every strategy . 
  this was the defining moment when riot said `` this is how we want the competitive scene to play our game '', 
  i 've seen this site a bunch of times how does it confirm that you were actually an employee in a certain company ? 
  to be fair that 's daniel klein , being `` snarky '' while ignoring the players justified complains is his game dev philosophy . 
  he does n't block people individually usually , there 's `` block lists '' that people trade with eachother , and they use scripts to mass block users from their twitter . 
  you are probably on one of those lists , it 's not very hard to be on it , you just have to follow particular people at times . 
  i used to play a ton of aram a few years ago , it 's good to mindless play something while you drink . 
  it 's like watching a shitty michael bay flick . 
  ls is a korean masters player and coached several lcs teams * * insert iwd meme * * , i think his perspective on the subject has a bit more value than a random person saying that all supports are shit and boosted . 
  saying that `` nobody understands what supports actually do '' is a bit delusional . 
  no , you play whatever the fuck you want , nobody is telling you to stop playing support . 
  the issue is more around riot 's balance of the game and the community 's forced meta for the role . 
  supports have no agency in the early game besides warding the bot side and keep the adc as safe as possible while he farms.sure they can try and roam but that puts the adc and you as the support at a disadvantage , the adc gets frustrated for being in a 1v2 , and the support loses on exp and possible gold that might be devastating if the roam does n't result in a successful gank . 
  all the other roles ( minus the adc but they can have a either impact late game ) have more agency during the early game and should try to make plays around the map while keeping up the responsibilities of their respective lanes ( or jungle ) , this results in higher skill since it necessitates knowledge of lanning and matchups but also macro game sense and execution . 
  meanwhile the notion of a stationary support player in games like dota is laughable , the role is much more about supporting your entire team than supporting another specific player , like it happens in league . 
  those are all mechanics that the solo laners have to do by themselves while also cs ` ing . 
  so are you just going to ignore the part where top/mid/jungle are allowed and should be active and try to make plays in the entire map ? 
  just because supports partly do similar functions to solo laners/jungler does n't give mean they they have the same early game agency as the rest of the roles . 
  i guess the comedy there is an acquired taste , i absolutely hate the new standard for american comedies to be 80 % improv connect flimsy to the main scripted story , in the case of the ghostbusters it felt like the entire movie was an snl sketch where the characters had no actual personality and were just parody of themselves , also incredibly low brow jokes at times ( there 's so much fart jokes a man can take ) . 
  but again , some people might enjoy that style of comedy , i personally hate it . 
  is toxicity the new buzzword of the game ? 
  every single day there 's like 4 to 5 posts in the frontpage about it . 
  maybe if the amount of `` toxicity '' increased in the last couple of days , maybe there 's something wrong with the implementation of riot 's current system . 
  well since the rumor was that the final cut was done by the producers after they meshed together the ayer 's cut and the trailerhouse 's cut , that makes sense . 
  for the first time ever riot actually did everything i wanted for one of their systems . 
  runes choices that actually matter , special runes that change gameplay , and they are all free and customizable in champ select . 
  and yes , it makes sense to combine the mastery and rune system into a single unified system , fuck riot is n't full of retarded devs . 
  only seven more years before they make all champions free !, 
  i argued before that giving people access to all champions increases the probability of people spending money on skins for champions they barely play . 
  specially since they have bi-weakly sales + that new `` your store '' sales , people love to buy shit they do n't need as long as it has a % off next to it . 
  well to be fair with the loot box system and the new missions system they are implementing at least getting champions will be easier and more `` interactive '' for new players , it 's still a shit system that fucks with them trying to balance the game . 
  they appear as impactful as the current keystones , slight more interactive though , i think one of the examples they gave was an old keystone they had to rework lol . 
  i think this is better than the mastery trees because at least it does n't lock them into a few select number of keystones , they are n't limited by 9 , they can make as many interesting and different keystones as they want , some might even help certain champions be more viable . 
  but they could n't make real counters in league because since the start champions were locked , otherwise it would literally be pay to win , you either buy the champion that counters the other or you are fucked, 
  according to the wayback machine he used to have shoutcaster for riot games in his bio , and now he just has `` i talk about videogames '' he might actually have been fired . 
  kinda weird that eu lcs is starting and we do n't have an official statement from riot , even if they do n't say the reason for firing him . 
  most games that go f2p is because they have a severely decline in playerbase or do n't think they might attract a sustainable playerbase . 
  neither are issues for riot right now , maybe in 2 years they will start to get worried . 
  the issue is n't homogenizing heroes , hots has half of the league 's champions so that 's not a fair comparison , also a played a bunch of hots during their 2.0 event , saying that they make heroes as unique as possible is slightly laughable as their last heroes are overwatch characters and that super cookie cutter amazon warrior , their more interesting heroes are specialists but they prefer releasing warriors and assassins from what i 've seen . 
  the problem i was talking is riot and blizzard being unable to create characters that directly counter other characters . 
  i wish they just gave valor his old q and e ability , he was super fun to play before now he just works as a taxi for quinn ... 
  honestly some bugs were hilarious , once i was able to auto and ruthless predator during the dash animation of this slice and dice and got accused of hacking ( lul ) , they completely broke the croc i do n't even understand how they can dig up more bugs while trying to fix the current ones and just give up after 1 month . 
  i 've played league for 4 years and dota since 7.00 , you can play and enjoy both games and still be able to point out key issues in league 's balance/development that could be improved if you look at dota 2 's systems . 
  also this is one of the few subs where you can discuss riot 's retarded decisions with league in a smart way since people have a better outside perspective . 
  yeah i saw the original clip on the main sub , that build is greedy as fuck though , but yeah his animations get so much smoother with a bit of attackspeed , also it 's super satisfying to melt tanks if you go bc + botrk . 
  ** passive : ** attacking gives `` fury '' , a resource , fury enhances basic abilities . 
  ** cull the meek - ** aoe circular slash around him , deals damage and heals . 
  fury enhanced : damage and heal increase, 
  ** ruthless predator - ** auto enhancer , applies stun and 2 quick basic attacks . 
  fury enhanced : increases stun duration , increases damage , and he autos 3 times instead of 2 . 
  ** slice and dice - ** 2 small dashes , the second can only be used if slice hits an enemy . 
  fury enhanced : increased damage , the dice dash reduces enemy armor . 
  ** dominus : ** increases health , aoe damage around him , gains fury passively during the duration . 
  if you do n't agree with my comments you can just downvote it , that 's how reddit works buddy . 
  [ here ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/dotamasterrace/comments/6e9c4k/new_runeshonor_update_for_league/di8ndxf/ ), 
  they touched riven 's animation cancel ? 
  where are the riots against riot ? 
  touching riven animations is like taboo in that sub . 
  well , that 's a good way to sell more of that new riven skin . 
  i 'm not sure how they are going to market this show without softening up or removing key plots , it 's a very dark at times coming of age story . 
  like the main arc is about betraying and possibly killing their own parents , people do eventually die , nico cuts herself to utilize her magic , there 's a lot of sexual fluidity talk for one of the characters , also it would be pretty cgi intensive , is old lance gon na be full cgi or a puppet ? 
  i guess a cgi dinosaur could either be super expensive or super shitty looking . 
  on a more random sidenote : i guess molly wo n't be a mutant anymore , or does hulu belong to fox or something ? 
   ack snyder should have taken a lesson from bruce timm, 
  so ... should we expect some gratuitous sex scene between batfleck and a 20 years younger batgirl in justice league ? 
  yes , unforgivable !, 
  she obviously worked much harder on her cosplay , almost as much as a d'va cosplayer . 
  the op from that post linked directly to the video , so the drm thread shows up in the `` other discussions '' tab of reddit , that 's probably how the rioter saw it . 
  timm injected a stupid sex scene between batman and batgirl in the killing joke animated movie , and he previously pushed that type of relationship between the two in stories he wrote , which is super awkward since barbara and dick also have a very close relationship . 
  the worst part in the killing joke , if you want to overanalyze it , is that barbara goes from liking batman as a mentor and for respect to liking him in a sexual way , forcing herself to him in a rooftop and fucking him . 
  this happens before the start of the actual killing joke story , in which * spoilers * barbara gets shot by the joker and they allude that she was raped . 
  people already have issues with batgirl getting raped in the original story , but in this new context its even worse , it feels like a punishment for her sexual impulse earlier . 
  hmm , is this player 's association a outside entity ? 
  cause creating a player 's association to represent players while still being a part of riot makes absolutely no sense . 
  edit : `` we 'll be funding the launch of the association , however the representation that the players vote on and elect is responsible solely to them . '', 
  well , that 's a somewhat fair middleground , but that initial funding still might give people a bad taste and might seem that riot is trying to control the players . 
  it was an incredibly short story to be fair , it felt like a one-off experimental issue , but thanks to being written by alan moore it got escalated into the pantheon of great graphic novels . 
  i did like the memories speech and the one bad day rhetoric from joker , i like when you get to hear joker 's psyche from himself , similar to what happens in morrison 's arkham asylum . 
  the rest of the killing joke is mostly just alan moore experimenting with aesthetic in a batman story in my opinion . 
  people are thinking `` yeah no franchising for eu ! '', 
  but they seem to not understand that this means less investment for eu orgs and less money and rights for eu lcs players . 
  na lcs players already get paid more than eu lcs players , and now with the minimum salary increasing you should expect that difference to be even greater . 
  i wan na see what all these people cheering for this news will say when eu starts hemorrhaging players and sponsors , specially with na lcs forcing teams to fill 2 squads thanks to the new academy system . 
  minimum salary , as in , the money given by riot if i 'm correct , so they are tripling the money given to riot directly to players . 
  according to scarra all na lcs players have 100k + salaries right now , and reignover has the highest at 700k . 
  and with nothing changing in eu lcs we can expect the same that it 's happening with overwatch , ca n't wait to see people bitch about every eu player moving to na , it 's already somewhat happening right now , but with this system they get more money directly from riot , you are not in danger of getting relegated and you will have a player 's association to take care of your contract . 
  the issue is , sure esports are growing at a rate that nobody expected , but you ca n't really sustain a localized scene yet , there 's just not enough people to be worth it , not even in league , much less for overwatch . 
  people are starting to understand that communication is super important and i think teams might start preferring getting english speaking europeans to koreans .
