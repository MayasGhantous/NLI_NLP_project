  but the stacking items by themselves are an aggressive move , after that first dragon fight they could have gone back to farming and build more items just to play it safe , but they built snowbally items and played according to them ( keep stacking them and not dying ) so they could snowball harder . 
  :| then you look at other lcs players on gragas ( like dyrus ) and realize that you are very wrong . 
  still do n't know why he does n't , utility/tank gragas late game falls off hard , he 's useful for his utility , dyrus is very good in selfish aggressive-type carry toplaners ( like renekton ) , by going tank with gragas his entire point is to trust that the rest of the team will follow his ult ... which they were not doing it in many occasions . 
  but the koreans top laners do complain about the current top lane meta , just listen to thoorin 's interview with flame :|, 
  i really do n't wan na beat on a dead horse , but the entire `` potential '' - meme , honestly in the early split clg and dignitas really showed potential to became something that could seriously compete in the international scene by developing their own style of play ... but half-way through the split it 's like they started making stupid decisions and could n't adapt as fast as other teams :\\ it 's a shame , my guess is lmq , c9 and tsm will stomp the rest of the teams during the following weeks and clg/dig wo n't be able to do anything about it . 
  like the others said , they did a couple of videos together actually , [ here have fun ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heubjqbwdwa ), 
  my guess is that it really does n't affect lcs itself since they do n't organize the korean tournaments , ogn does . 
  on the other hand , i really do n't know what riot will do if samsung blue and samsung white get 2 of the 3 korean spots in worlds ( which seems very possible ) , i guess they would have tiny heart attacks if the twin teams actually ended up at finals `` lol world championship , on the red side samsung , on the blue side samsung !, 
  ~ lol wc not sponsored by samsung inc. '', 
  lulu 's kit is amazing , i 've been playing her a lot lately just thanks to her kit . 
  those es to far away minion to kill the running away enemy with q , chain cc with w and ult ( rip assassins ) , laughing while having the entire enemy team chasing you while you w yourself and q them all . 
  also you can play her top , mid and supp and carry your team thanks to all the versatility she has :d, 
  also nobody expects that e+q burst . 
  i love playing orianna and i still do this from time to time , or ball ` ing a teammate that is engaging just to have them flash away when you ult ; _ ;, 
  very true , my first few times with ori were so depressing , i had no idea how to move the ball and ori at the same time . 
  after a while , positioning ori to auto attack and dodge skills while moving the ball at the same time feels like the most satisfying thing in league when you can make it feel fluid . 
  i 'm still below thrash elo , but love playing her . 
  the rework looks amazing , sona seems way more active than just stacking your passive to harass during the lanning phase and being a heal station with a aoe stun late game, 
  neither will lucian 's after tomorrow :d,

  2 teemo skins in a row :| i guess i 'll start maining him -_- ', 
  yes quinn , the adc that people take top lane to annoy bruiser top laners and then assassinate the enemy carries with valor with a couple of items :3, 
  your use of logic and restrain about the little information we have about this champ is not welcome in this thread , instead we should all believe riot likes making op champs for the early sales ^ / s , down with this cute adorable fluffy abomination of a champ !, 
  so fluffy seriously  __ <, 
  the church of valor is a very motivated group yes , you too can see the holy mother 's true potential if you embrace demacia 's wings . 
  join us !, 
  join the quinntologists !, 
  go through your lane and watch everyone new trying to play him hop ` ing right into your turret range :d you know ... the yasuo syndrome ^ ^ whichihave, 
  imagine if riot reworks her to be like a bird version of nidalee , able to switch between valor and quinn , a summoner can dream ... 
  you have no idea how glad i am every time the enemy team bans or takes rengar away from meteos ... pls dude stop trying < __ <, 
  i 'll start by saying i ca n't play zed so i do n't understand fully his kit , but looking at the cooldowns , i do n't understand why it was such a big nerf to zed , at least in the lanning phase where he can snowball , exhaust has a 210 secds cd while zed 's ult rank 1 has 120 secds , why not bait the exhaust and 2 minutes later go for the kill ? 
  :\\ also it seems cleanse removes exhaust , so you can always run it as well . 
  pwyff , please never stop writing the patch notes ( unless you are doing something more awesome of course ) , you make looking at stats and numbers the most interesting and funny thing ever :d, 
  i love quinn and as much as i would love to have her be an op pick and see more play i understand that what i said would be extremely broken ( even though a smaller cooldown would still be appreciated ) . 
  i think the w needs to have it 's passive improved as quinn , the utility of the vision is great but the attackspeed and movement when attacking someone marked ( which this passive by itself is extremely unreliable ) is just bad , i would very much preferred a scaling with levels base attack and movement speed , then you could actually max it sooner if you preferred it 's utility and stats booster instead of the damage from q and e. 
  and now he 's played as supp , builds only magic pen and does double the damage the ap carry does :\\ he was a midlaner that came out during a meta that does n't like low mobility midlaners , it was not because his kit was weak . 
  as long as you can hit his skillshots he does tons of damage , just like xerath , not my type of champion though but i always respect his damage output < _ <, 
  never understood why people do n't just pick mage supports every time the enemy instalocks morgana , so easy to bait the shield or even break it with a rotation of spells , and vel ` koz/annie/karma / zyra cooldowns are definitely lower than the long ass cd of that shield , but everyone still go for thresh and braum `` because op '' . 
  it definitely changed soloq , so many hecarim and aatrox < _ <, 
  damn that 's almost xenophobic :| i 'm pretty sure nationalities = / = bad supports . 
  but again , language and communication have nothing to do with not itemizing correctly according to your role . 
  also pings help you communicate to your team most of all the essential information ( riot is even implementing the `` enemy ward/ward here '' ping we 've been asking on pbe ) and it 's more than enough in soloq where there 's little team strategy . 
  i ca n't talk about your personal experience , but every time someone in my games was talking anything but english if you ask them to speak in english they do , pretty much all europeans can speak a little english or even learn it as second language in school :\\, 
  this , while i agree with several people in this thread about riot focusing in reworking the kits of the champions less played , taric and braum have two completely different themes in their kits and fill different playstyles as support ( even though right now braum 's kit is way better in general ) . 
  like they did with sona , the most recent example , i think they should rework taric a bit to make him his own style of champion . 
  well , maybe eg and col since they are pretty much stuck for relegation , c9 and dig will probably go hard carry mode to try and get seeds for playoffs, 
  i agree , dexter seems to be in a very bad place right now in relation to the game , he hard carried several games earlier in the split with his elise , and now he seems lost in the jungle . 
  he starts doing bad , loses motivation to play with his teammates outside of lcs , and he gets rants from his teammates about his performance ? 
  when honestly everyone in that team can be blamed for their loses ( even the almighty `` you have 4 more kills than me but i can still 1v1 u m8 '' - lift ) . 
  i think dexter is starting to doubt his decision to move to na , a still play league , like he said `` it 's not fun , it feels like a job '' , that was just depressing to watch . 
  probably a full c9 chasing the cup ( nothing wrong with that , go c9 ! ), 
  since i doubt machinima has enough money to send someone after the main rooster to korea . 
  even though a inside look at the super stars clg this week would be fun as well . 
  i would totally follow that roster to korea , but dl can be such a cock to aphromoo sometimes though . 
  ^ ^ iseemymistake ^ ^ ^ sorry, 
  i meant the machinimavs crew , do n't know how they are associated to the main company though , they might just be another content creator :\\ do n't know why people still join machinima , so many bad stories about them , right now game related companies i think polaris and yogscast are the best option for games-related youtubers . 
  * outside of korea ( and maybe china , do n't know the players ), 
  since riot is revising the rules for next season now its a great time for teams to push this option to have the coaches in during champ select ( at least in mic with the team , they do n't need to be on stage ) , they already discussed many times on si about teams preparing a comp and then going completely outside of the strategy during champ select . 
  it 's all a conspiracy from the soloq rengos so that they can keep demolishing everyone while not getting more nerfs because of he sucks in lcs . 
  we need to warn everyone ... ( ! ), 
  - * `` spikereynolds has been slain '' *, 
  unless you 're dade , then you blind pick zed and dominate vs a team with exhaust and zilean ult < . <, 
  i can confirm this , so freaking annoying to have a chat full of distanceb 32948342 -_- ' and both teams see it :\\, 
  unless someone is buying upvotes for a post to reach first page there 's no reason to stop a source of material that is interesting for the community . 
  how can we decide what is or is n't interesting for the community ? 
  well through the vote system , that 's the entire point of reddit , and censoring certain outlets of information because they used shady methods to get views should not stop the community from getting access to it . 
  tl ; dr : censorship bad , let the vote system decide .

  now veigars need to wait 90 secds to be relevant again !, 
  dfg helps a ton vs the tanks , you can usually 100-0 the ap mages and adc with just your combo after 2 items , once i 100-0 a katarina with just my ult < . <,

  you need to to one more mage game to unlock it, 
  the company that makes the copyright claim steals the profit ... not google . 
  they get their piece of the pie either way though . 
  but yes this is a serious concern for many streamers/youtubers , those with money just buy music from companies that give you music packages to use in your videos , other youtubers with less money just use copyright free music , like sp4zie started doing when the all copyright issue showed up on youtube . 
  i 'm pretty sure they already pay/have copyright for the lcs songs , most are from companies that produce stock music anyways . 
  i do n't know how these deals work , but most probably riot `` rents '' their playlist , they ca n't allow other people to use them because the songs belong to someone else . 
  on a positive note , monstercat which is one of the most well known labels / `` music libraries '' out there on the interwebs , is very much against what 's happening in youtube and twitch , they might help streamers . 
  please your logic and common sense is not welcome here , this is / r/leagueoflegends mate !, 
  but seriously , riot needs twitch/youtube as much as twitch/youtube needs their viewers , they would never break their partnership because of the choices of business practices of one another . 
  also true , like i said in the other post , streamers that are also youtubers already went through this months ago and had to change with it . 
  after the copyright issues on youtube spazie stopped using his playlist and started streaming with free license music so he could easily upload his videos later on youtube without issues . 
  i 'm not personally defending the copyright enforcement going on , but this is not the end of the world issue people are making it . 
  you know what 's the most useless udyr ever ? 
  tank max-turtle udyr that gets kited by everyone and then does zero damage after being able to hit a stun ... that was so depressing to watch ... 
  on the other hand , fuck splitpush tiger udyr with triforce d ;, 
  does n't look like that at all . 
  it seems he [ slips his left front paw ] ( http://im.ezgif.com/tmp/ec84be190a-gif/frame_042.gif ) , and then [ tries to balance himself with the right back paw ] ( http://im.ezgif.com/tmp/ec84be190a-gif/frame_044.gif ) and slips again . 
  tl ; dr : friction is a bitch, 
  i agree thoorin definitely brings a different approach to the normal professional league analyses . 
  the fact that he has a wider knowledge of esports in general thanks to his work in other scenes definitely helps him give a better perspective of the pro-scene in league and gives us more in-depth information that most `` colorful interviews '' like travis 's ( which i also love , everything as its place ) do n't develop . 
  that happens more often with akali in my experience ... `` meh buy pink , gg she ca n't do shi - '' * pentakill * `` we 're fucked ... '', 
  very true , i picked her up recently when i usually play more aggressive supports , not a good transition v.v, 
  i meant aggressive in the sense of doing damage or tanking it , nami can be aggressive in lane but you need your adc to dps otherwise you are just wasting mana . 
  for some context my favorite supports are leona and braum because they can engage and tank a lot of damage ( i.e. 
  win the trade ) or zyra that does just retarded levels of damage and you can easily poke the enemy adc down while your adc just keeps farming .
