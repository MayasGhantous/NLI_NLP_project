  i do n't agree with being a big line , it 's a very very thin line between jerk and toxic rager , since it 's incredible subjective how much you consider `` too much '' . 
   the reform system is chat bans . 
  also what the fuck do they need a reform system for ? 
  chat bans and 2-week bans are not reform systems , it 's a simple time-out , and it creates no behavioral change . 
  it also does n't help when people know that their ban was automated by a bot and they have no way of knowing if their behavior is improving after being chat banned, 
  time to get downvoted for mentioning dota 2 , but valve 's behavior score and prisoner 's island is way better at informing and punishing their players than this matrix dystopia created by riot . 
  ** edit : lol apparently they had a 270k investment last year to create the wikia and only saw 5k in revenue during that year , no wonder they are getting fired . 
  well , i do n't really understand how that wiki even needs a staff , it 's just a competitive wikia it 's a 1-2 people job honestly , and even though they are usually the fastest to update the stats they are just one of several wikias that exist that do exactly the same shit that they do , also they lost a ton of users after having to change domain when they got fired by their previous sponsor . 
  there 's also the fact that recently the biggest rank play aggregator for league , op.gg , started their [ own esport-centric database ] ( http://best.gg/ ) which looks a million times better than the standard boring looking wikia , and it links directly to the players soloq profiles, 
  compare their player profiles , for example [ bjergsen in best.gg ] ( http://best.gg/player/bjergsen ) vs [ bjergsen in esportswiki ] ( http://lol.esportswikis.com/wiki/bjergsen ) , you have direct access to all their recent matches , performance , builds , etc. 
  he does super passive aggressive comments most of the time , flaming and degrading his teammates he mostly does out of the game . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  lucian was reworked after being too strong for months , which resulted in the insane 0 cooldown on dash lucian which made him even more broken and op . 
  i do n't really care about the system , i think it will quickly be forgotten once people do n't see rewards fast enough . 
  i think it 's hilarious that they made `` did n't tilt '' an honor , and that < 3 is cringe as fuck , not sure what is their problem with `` friendly '' and `` helpful '' which were the previous honors . 
  according to a post they made before i think the key drop rate is increases with your honor tier , also it appears that the end of season rewards are only given to people with at least tier 3 honor . 
  but apparently you only get keys through the honor system if people give you honors , instead of randomly dropping after games like before , that 's how they are reinforcing the `` be a good boy '' mentality , no keys and you ca n't open any loot boxes . 
  why ? 
  it 's not the community fault that esportswiki was a niche wikia that only a minuscule fraction of people ( mostly casters and analysts ) were interested in the very specific data that you could n't find in a multitude of other wikias and websites that do exactly the same stuff that esportswiki did . 
   even if you are only looking for top level stats , it is by far your best choice . 
  and you understand how niche of an audience that is ? 
  it also did n't help that the other options were way better established , if you google anything related with league esports wiki , gamepedia and esportspedia still show up first . 
  from an economic standpoint it makes sense for developers/publishers to push their games as esports right away , if you are making a multiplayer-centric game your biggest issue is trying to maintain a consistent active playerbase otherwise your game dies . 
  esports scenes help maintain player engagement even when they are not actively playing the game , that 's why these people are pushing it so hard . 
  also i find it hilarious how nintendo has one of the oldest esports scene around and they are pushing fucking splatoon and arms as esports . 
  the recall animations were [ `` done '' by the skt players ] ( https://youtu.be/l8kxrbs-2pk?t=8s ) in november though ... 
  there has been several metas where supports were the highest damage dealers in their team , but they were eventually nerfed to the ground because everyone bitched that supports should n't do more damage then an ap carry or ad carry ( malzahar was bullshit though ) . 
  the league community has a retarded definition of the support role , instead of seeing the role as being about champions that can do their job and help their team with low-income , whether this is through utility or damage , they see supports as ward/peel bitches that heal and shield the adc or just stand in front of them . 
  you can still go zyra or vel ` koz and hard carry with damage though . 
  brand 's damage is too situational and he has too many mana issues , i prefer vel ` koz , aoe true damage is just too strong . 
  zyra and malz had the exact same issue , their pets were annoying and super hard to play around , people eventually figured out that mf could counter zyra plants and lulu could one-shot malz 's voidlings , they needed a few damage nerfs , but riot just gutted malz over and over again because pro-players still liked his ult . 
  yes but this sub does n't show up in r/popular exactly because it 's one of the most filtered subs in r/all . 
  in the case of r/popular it 's a curation done by the reddit administrators , in the case of r/all it was individuals filtering the sub . 
  concurrent viewers = / = unique viewers overall archyes ... 
  riot said worlds finals had 43 million unique viewers , and valve says ti had 14.8 million unique viewers ( ** edit : ** ok not counting chinese numbers , did anyone post the chinese numbers ? 
  even if possible false ? 
  ) , am i missing something ? 
  the only different in the data is riot saying their top concurrent viewership was 14.7 million while esports charts says it was 28 million , which is a weird big difference , but it was n't riot exaggerating their numbers . 
  i never argued that league of legends has a mostly casual playerbase . 
  the vast majority of people do just play videogames for the enjoyment of playing them , specially if it 's a social thing to do with friends , league esports exploded thanks to its sheer amount of users . 
  risenlazarus leaves out the part where the players were allowed to reject all three candidates and get their own if they organized , which is impossible , like it has been said before by proplayers , the biggest reason for not existing a players union in league is because most of them are kids and do n't bother with it , ffs most of them have shit contracts , winterfox still holds pobelter 's image rights because in his contract he gave away is image rights for his entire life . 
  [ case in point , the recent lemonnation interview  ( https://slingshotesports.com/2017/06/12/lemonnation-flyquest-riot-games-players-union/ ), 
   `` without riot actually taking the initiative to fund it and get good representatives as options for us , it just would n't get off the ground . '', 
   `` i mean we 're constantly competing with each other . 
  the pros are n't talking to each other . 
  there 's the friendships and teams and stuff like that , but we 're never brought all together . 
  the only time we were brought all together was by riot . 
  we were brought together recently for the players summit where we had all the players association ( talk ) and stuff like that . 
  there 's just no way that the players by themselves would do it . 
  i think most of the players are too lazy and just too focused on other things . 
  they 're too focused on competing and winning . 
  we 're all technically on the same side , but we are all competing against each other as well . '', 
  there 's only 2 things about the windwall that are bullshit :, 
  the fact that the wall is created inside his model , which negates any sort of possible counterplay when he can always windwall in the last millisecond to save himself . 
  solution : make the wall be created 1 teemo unit in front of him . 
  the fact that he can dance in the wall to negate any damage from both sides . 
  solution : make the wall negate only from one side , the actual position of the wall should be a tactical decision , and this would make it impossible for him to deny damage from 2 sides at the same time , it does n't even make sense visual btw . 
  maybe you do n't have any friends to trade when you are a kid and still want to collect all pokemons and that 's why you buy both versions , why open old wounds ? 
  yellow was the shit though , it blew my little kid 's mind that you could talk directly with pikachu and see his reaction , that was some futuristic shit for me back then . 
  one of my favorite gaming memories is trying to figure out how to catch mew in the original games by looking it up in old early 2000 's websites when i barely knew any english so i had to go by the reference pictures . 
  i fucking loved those games , it 's kinda sad that i was never able to get into the newer games . 
  i actually just have a bunch of reddit accounts and upvote all my comments here ^ ^ / s, 
  he 's a play-by-play caster though , i already said this before , but games with phreak are beyond annoying because he monopolizes the entire cast , he tries to do the play-by-play casting which is the usual overhyped lcs bullshit and at the same time tries to show his `` game knowledge '' when that 's by talking about strategy and macroplay when that 's the job of the color caster . 
  what happened to jason reitman ? 
  thank you for smoking , juno and up in the air were pretty well acclaimed movies ( even if people started hating juno later on ) , and then suddenly he came out with young adult which was pretty divisive movie and since then i have n't heard about any of his other projects . 
  i actually saw that thread in `` new '' , did n't actually expect people to upvote such a delusional and circlerjerky post , the league sub is already starting it 's descent into hots daily masturbatory posts ? 
  lets see if i can find some cringe in their front page ... 
   recently , my social media feeds have celebrated the new wonder woman movie and how it empowers young girls . 
  i just want to take a moment to recognize blizzard in that my daughter has had no desire to see wonder woman because she gets her female super hero fix from hots, 
  yup that 's good enough ... 
  also, 
   her current favorite is d.va ( ... ) and none of them are gratuitously sexualized . 
  he 's obviously not visiting the correct websites, 
   the utility support items bring are just absolutely absurd to the point where you could almost pick anyone as a support and just buy those items and still contribute a meaningful amount, 
  how is that a bad thing ? 
  the reason why people hated playing support was because of the stigma of being ward bitches , now you can pretty much play anything , utility supports , tank supports , damage supports , since there 's cheap items with great utility for each type you prefer . 
  i wish riot was able to do the same with the other roles , the biggest issue with league is how restricted the champions playstyle is , and this happens because most items in league are just stats boosts . 
  he 's arguing against the new support items because they make anything viable in that role , how is that a bad thing ? 
  i think this might worsen the eu talent exodus , seriously currently most pros careers are extremely short and they have no idea how long they will be able to ride the money wave , most will be better off moving and earning as much money as possible before retiring . 
  sidenote : about loco 's single league , well at least nobody would bitch about schedules . 
  i thought the origin of riven was `` hey i like roy in smash , let me try and make someone similar in league '',
