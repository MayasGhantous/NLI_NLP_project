  lb 's only issue is her stupid wave clear with w-q , she 's an assassin with a mage level wave clear , it 's also what make the gunblade build possible since for some reason each proc of w-q counts as a single ability and the heal is n't reduced like other aoe abilities . 
  but that is riot 's new philosophy for assassins , they want there to be a delay between the engagement and the assassination , look at what they did to talon and fizz . 
  her mobility is exactly what makes her an assassin instead of a traditional control mage or poke mage , i have no issue with her w being purely a positioning tool . 
  well , to be fair that 's the eu tournament , going by ow 's history they are lucky to break the 1k viewers in europe, 
  / r/summonerschool if you want tips of any general help,

  they are extremely repetitive with their content and slightly clickbaity ( not as much as others though ) , but i guess [ foxdrop ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/foxdroplol/videos ) and [ phylol ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/thephylol/videos ) are probably good reccommendations for someone starting . 
  in general , watching junglers is the best option if you want to learn more about the game in general since they are the most active role , unless you want to learn lanning specific mechanics . 
  i actually never understood why they introduced the hero limit , i know people were abusing stupid comps like 5 tracers 1 lucio , but limiting it to only 2 of the same hero would probably result in more interesting metas ... or maybe you would only see 3 heroes every comp lol, 
  i do , they ( well mostly foxdrop ) were part of a riot documentary where fox talked about his social anxiety and depression . 
  pretty neat little doc . 
  i presume that 's accounts created , also there 's multiple chinese serves so people have accounts in multiple different servers , the last number for last year was around 75 million active chinese accounts , since some rioter said they were 2/3 or 3/4 of the playerbase . 
  only trust monthly active numbers or concurrent player numbers , boys and girls . 
  that 's not a fair assessment , i do n't play cs : go and do n't watch their regular tournaments but i do watch the semi-finals and finals of most cs majors , it 's really fun to watch even if you are a casual viewer , that 's why it 's the title with the biggest `` viewer-only '' ratio from the big 3 . 
  honestly it 's the only way for riot to increase again their viewership , europe and na were pretty bad schedules for chinese viewers , so it makes sense . 
  also it 's their main fanbase , chinese players eclipse all the other regions together . 
  the 100 million number was confirmed by a rioter in the main sub , whose job it was to identify bots , and even he/she said that he might not have been able to spot all bot accounts,
