  the cringiest part is all the `` another poor friendzoned guy '' comments , maybe the guy is the one that does n't want anything more , maybe neither wants anything romantic , hey kids , boys and girls can actually be just friends , specially if they only know eachother from playing an online game together . 
  [ #themoreyouknow ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/3og0imjcsi8p6hyqxs/giphy.gif ), 
  putting the whore in karma whore ? 
  but the only real footage from the jungle book was with mowgli , every setting was green screen . 
  the lion king has zero human characters and i doubt they would bother using real animals when they can do it in cgi ... so no ... call it a new animated lion king , not live action, 
  are you going to ignore the asterisk ? 
  `` includes rebroadcast hours '' ... also what 's a unique viewer ? 
  someone that was on twitch randomly saw an msi stream , clicked on it , watched 10 seconds and left , does he count as a unique viewer ? 
  because if so , this number is meaningless . 
  [ source of the viewership ] ( https://twitter.com/esportscharts/status/883783504315772928 ), 
   rr was perceived as a fun tournament for many people , kinda like allstars . 
  or maybe league of legends viewership is actually declining for several reasons . 
  how was the time fucking bad lol , it started at 9 a.m in the west coast , everyone that wanted to watch the finals could watch the finals , yet it had less viewership than a match in the first day . 
  viewership is important for 2 things :, 
  - you enjoy watching an esport ? 
  if it 's viewership is shit or declining it might mean that you wo n't be able to watch said esport for much longer , since viewership is directly connected to the money in the scene and how much the pros are paid, 
  - you enjoy the game ? 
  declining viewership might indicate decline in playerbase , if that 's the case it 's also going to be harder for you to keep playing said multiplayer-only game . 
  edit : also has a disgruntle viewer , declining viewership gives legitimacy to your arguments when you criticize how stupid riot 's tournament structure and balancing are . 
  what 's the exchange rate from rito points to blizz esport dollars ? 
  i have the feeling that for 1000 rp would be enough to buy you a spot in the owleague , go for it mate !, 
  it means that every time someone clicked on the stream for any amount of time during the broadcast or the rebroadcast . 
  say , the user codisshit420 is browsing twitch , sees the msi stream with 300k viewers , clicks on it , watches 20 seconds of it says `` fuck it '' and leaves , he still gave riot 1 + unique viewer !, 
  oh i left out people saying that the overall tournament had a shit time because it was in the morning during the week for americans ... yet , the first day which was wednesday had the highest viewership match , higher than the actual finals , and it was in the middle of the weekday for americans . 
  the 5 % ratio is for how long the boxes last before being proc ` ed or die out , its not their damage , `` 35 / 50 / 65 / 80 / 95 ( + 20 % ap ) '' is their damage ratio . 
  i do n't agree with just gutting champions , they need to balance her so she is n't so oppressive with just her standard combo , they could make the % damage from her headshot scale with levels . 
  caitlyn already is supposed to push you and poke you early thanks to her range , but once you are under tower is just super frustrating , mostly because of the ridiculous damage from headshot and removal of peacemaker 's damage mitigation when passing by your minions . 
  you want all league players to flock to dota 2 then ? 
  cause the only 2 other real options are dota or hots, 
  this is the thing i do n't understand , how does the overwatch proscene even work ? 
  ignoring the asian tournaments which do n't have western teams anymore . 
  i know right now blizzard is organizing :, 
  - the contenders : which according to them is for teams and players to showcase themselves in hopes of getting into a owleague team ( most wo n't and most wo n't get any money from that shitty prizepool ), 
  - the overwatch world cup : which is n't org based , they just vote for players from specific countries to participate, 
  - overwatch league : the main event which is starting with only 6 teams , and it starts in december according to people in their sub . 
  so , in theory blizzard is already controlling the rest of the year in the west + probably the start of 2018 . 
  what are all the rest of the players and orgs supposed to do for 6-7 months if they are n't competing in anything since blizzard does n't give licenses ? 
  is contenders going to be a recurring thing ? 
  like season 2 ends , and season 3 starts 2 weeks later ? 
  orgs keep dropping players and people say `` oh they are good they will get picked by an owleague org , there 's a limited number of spots unless orgs get multiple squads , that 's a lot of unemployed pro-players not competing professionally for over 7 months . 
  i do n't know why you guys are bitching , it 's a huge success , blizzard just made 140 million $ clean . 
  smartest business decision they made in recent history, 
  even better , the chinese team will be own by blizzard 's distributor of the game in china which is a pretty big conflict of interests , and the korean team will be owned by an american with silicon valley investors , i wonder how koreans will react to their country being represented by american investors . 
  actually he 's exactly the target audience of blizzard going by their previous statements , the reason for the city-based system is for casual players to start watching esports just because there 's a team that represents their home city , just like normal sports . 
  ( which in my opinion will never happen because esports are a way more international industry than any regular sport ), 
   players build loyalty because they are the primary lens through which people interact . 
  which is what blizzard does n't understand , and what many of these orgs ( specially immortals ) are trying to change . 
  noah has said in many interviews that his main goal is building the immortals brand disassociated from his players , so that he can change players whenever he needs without losing fans . 
  but this goes against the nature of esports , people get invested way more in the players than in the orgs they play for . 
   beyond that , the allocation for current cities is stupid . 
  5 na teams , 1 chinese , 1 korean ? 
  no european ? 
   blizzard is doing that thing where they try to force conventional sport practices into a scene that has no regard for geography . 
  those teams are all they got , they either have direct connections to activision-blizzard ( kraft and wilpon are friends with bobby kotick , netease is overwatch 's distributor in china ) or esports orgs that recently got millions in vc money . 
  just to ram even harder blizzard ignorance of how esports work , they want to do a global league , with city-based teams , yet , they saw what happened to sc2 and are n't restricting imports slots for their regional teams , if he wanted , kraft could go to korea , throw 2 millions to the biggest korean squad and bring them to na to play for boston , i wonder how people from boston would feel about being represented by 6 koreans . 
  oh sorry i misread the `` find it boring as hell , as i do watching real sports . '', 
  part, 
   precisely . 
  you need long , long term stability and community for a brand to eclipse it 's roster . 
  that has n't happened in esports yet . 
  maybe some of the brood war teams got close , and i suppose eg is the closest in dota ( i dunno about league ) since na ` vi is basically dendi + 4 . 
  tsm could be a contender when it comes to league , but they are mostly bjergsen and doublelift fans , and tsm is a garbage org for players in the rest of their titles . 
  i could argue that cloud 9 are the closest to that , they are respected in most esports they are active in even if their roosters change , they have the strongest brand loyalty across multiple titles , and guess who strangely is n't involved in the owleague even after advocating in favor of it early on ? 
  there must be a reason for jack to not invest in this . 
   i just do n't understand why they did n't just copy riot or valve to the letter , and build up a healthy competitive scene before pulling this move . 
  riot probably has the clout and management capability to pull off city focused themes . 
  valve does n't get that involved , but the dota scene at least has the numbers to support it . 
  overwatch and blizzard quite obviously have neither . 
  not even league is able to create a city-based system , there 's just not enough local fans for something like that , only one of the pro leagues is able right now , and that 's the lpl ( chinese league ) which started their franchise this year , but even them will have their 14 teams divided between 4 different cities , because 1 org per city just is n't sustainable . 
  canadians speak english , pretty hard to interact with players of the team you like when they do n't speak your language . 
  that 's just wrong , asians just do n't play the same fps games that western countries play , they have their own versions like sudden attack and crossfire , which is why you do n't have that many chinese or korean cs : go pros , because they are competing in asian fps titles . 
  if only the greek government had implemented more loot boxes and better trade systems , maybe their economy could have been as big as dota prizepool . 
  ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ a ^ ^ joke ^ ^ because ^ ^ varoufakis ^ ^ worked ^ ^ as ^ ^ an ^ ^ economic ^ ^ adviser ^ ^ for ^ ^ valve, 
  ask the cs : go and vainglory subs what they think of tsm though, 
  edit : even their ow division was pretty lackluster last time i heard . 
  do n't kill the messenger i literally just used the auto-filled option :| i considered removing his name because i knew it would be misleading but i also did n't want to offend the guy by removing him from the title . 
  yeah , because saying `` hey guys did you see those amazing plays that the denver broncos 's seagull did on doomfist last night ? '', 
  is any less silly ... 
  oh nice , this means i can [ bring out this little gem again ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y63rwp3ogig ) :d, 
  how is that any different from the team names you criticized ? 
  that account is not banned though ... [ he played 2 hours ago ] ( https://na.op.gg/summoner/username=youmuusyt ), 
  it 's even in the video 's description , [ riot lifted the ban after analyzing the video and games ] ( https://twitter.com/youmuusyt/status/874808328173608960 ) , their system is no where near perfect but at least they acknowledged and fixed their mistake, 
  yup , lets make it more interest boys , who 's the most talented ceo , clg 's devin nash sexy dance moves , or [ echo fox 's jace hall smooth rhymes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltm5jhijfw4 ), 
  the first one even counts as a football club nowadays ?

  nothing says esports more than 2 middle age corporate white dudes .

  mate , league 's 100m number is monthly active players and is already a questionable as fuck number . 
  it 's accounts created , which probably includes free weekends and multiple free accounts made in pc bangs in china and korea , we have no idea how many active players they actually have . 
  quoting that number over and over again to sell their league is literally false advertising . 
  maybe if there was something that defines adcs * cough *** they are ranged *** cough * and if there was something that could be done to limit their effectiveness with them * cough *** reduce values for ranged users *** cough *, 
  but i guess riot knows what they are doing , it 's not like this has happened a million times before ... 
  duskblade is beyond broken on vayne as well , she can proc it multiple times in teamfights thanks to ult/tumble , and it brings back the tumblr one shot build from last year , duskblade proc + stattik shiv proc + tumblr increased damage just deletes any squishy , even harder if she builds ie . 
  also thanks to the mini-stun from duskblade combined with her movement speed passive you can literally never escape her, 
  i think you should be about to just change the mp3 file in your directory as long as you keep the name , i did it with the old client , i do n't know how to do it now though :\\, 
  the file appears to be in same place and has the same name : tbd_mus_lobby_base . mp3, 
  the directory is :, 
  c : \\ riot games \\ league of legends \\ rads \\ projects \\ lol_air_client \\ releases \\ 0.0.1.251 \\ deploy \\ mod \\ tbd \\ assets \\ audio, 
  i still have n't tried it , i 'll edit the post to say if it worked or not . 
  edit : hmm it did nothing , sorry dude , maybe someone with more patience and knowledge can help you out .
