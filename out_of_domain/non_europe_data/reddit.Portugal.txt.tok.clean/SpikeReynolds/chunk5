  i just ca n't position well with nami yet , which ends up with me getting easily cc ` ed and dead cause she 's very squishy ^ ^ likethefishsheis, 
  that 0.5 player is probably the top laner that afks farms the entire match and pushing his lane . 
  because dota 2 is a different tier of f2p , its system was n't made around the purpose of making money , unlike league , which needs to make money otherwise riot goes down . 
  league + loot . 
  that would be the gaming version of heroin o_o please do it !, 
  also , their cinematics are getting better and better , it would be kinda weird to put so much work into these animators and not use them for something more `` substantial '', 
  yeah people keep forgetting the other half of the story where clg did all of this in a rush ( to the point they had to find subs in less than 24h ) , if you do something in the last minute expect not so perfect results from the people you are working with . 
  clg did something illegal , they pay the fine and deal with it , it 's how the world works . 
  there 's no big gambit conspiracy behind this . 
  [ i 'll just link you to this comment on the other thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2dbe2j/league_of_legends_competition_ruling_counter/cjnwzyo ), 
   edit : additional translated quotes from riot korea during their interview with inven . 
   `` when it comes to account sharing there is no discrimination . 
  clg players were found playing ranked games with other user 's account so we suspended those accounts for 30 days according to our rules . 
  when clg was planning for their trip to korea , they requested accounts to riot hq , actually the eula is a little different in every regions . 
  riot hq thought riot korea could not give out live server accounts but that was a misunderstanding . 
  riot korea is able to give out live server accounts . 
  but there was some time period required to do the necessery paper work and during this time clg was given tr accounts to practice and they used other user 's accounts to play ranked games . 
  we know this was not for any financial gain or elo boosting but is still against our eula . '', 
   `` when a pro player is caught with account sharing , there is a ban to play in tournaments . 
  clg played with korean account in korean server so they are banned from tournaments hosted by ogn , kespa for 2 years . 
  but they can still compete in lcs or world championships . 
  there is however a penalty for them as they are a professional team and that will be $ 1,250 for each players amounting to $ 5,000 total . '', 
  on the second part , you should seriously join / r/conspiracy and / r/circlejerk , have fun . 
  yeah leprechaun veigar is also my favorite , love screaming taste the rainbow !, 
  after 100-0 someone with his combo :d , i broke my `` only 1 skin per champ '' with veigar ( got leprechaun and superb villain ) guess i 'll break it again thanks to the little master of evil . 
  pushing daisies and dead like me , both by bryan fuller ( better known now for hannibal i guess ) both shows have a lot of dark humor with some occasional serious themes if you enjoy that ( pd is more colorful though :p ), 
  what 's your opinion on morello 's ? 
  i started using it as a supplement to his passive and did n't have much mana issues ( or none if i get blue of course ) also you get more ap than athene 's and it 's passive can be helpful in some situations during teamfights . 
  [ veigar the tiny master of adorableness ] ( http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/227/d/c/cat_veigar_and_lulu_by_inkinesss-d5b8ire.jpg ) approved by lulu . 
  i 've been moving more towards morellonomicon for my midlaners thanks to the consecutive nerfs to athenes , but mostly on non-spammy champions ( i.e. 
  not ziggs or orianna ) since its cheaper and it gives more ap which really helps early game . 
  also it 's passive seems to be very useful against the current `` fuck you i 'll regen the shit out of your damage '' ~ top lane champs like maokai and gragas ^ ^ fuckmundo . 
  * this sub needs more items discussion threads *, 
  last worlds made twitch go into panic mode , ca n't even imagine if spectator mode was available < _ <, 
  i 'm sorry but [ wraiths  towers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ippanudyg3e ) ^ ^ i ` mkidding, 
  but seriously one of my biggest problems is trying to group when we have and advantage and can win a teamfight , people always insist on just continue farming instead of pushing for objectives , ending up in the enemy turtleing and coming back - . - ', 
  karma is hilarious to play vs a yasuo , you can easily poke with the aoe of your q and even bait the wall , and if he goes all in just root him with w and q+aa him . 
  if he 's able to actually catch you with his ult , shield with e , ult + w to get your health back while rooting him and winning the trade with qs . 
  at least she has flaws and can be shut downed in lane , the same can hardly be said about ad bruiser nidalee top and her broken ass kit . 
  you ca n't muscle her out of lane thanks to her retarded sustain , and her hybrid damage is a bitch to build resistances against . 
  100 % ban even if i 'm not going top < _ < adc steps on a trap/gets speared - cougar < jump < execute = it 's now a 4v5 and nid is full health and all abilities are up again . 
  i blame rivington 's narration over jatt 's , i would love a documentary about the evolution of lol esport narrated by riv :o, 
  well neither did blakinola 's patch video , but nobody complained about him :\\, 
  macro strategy is the most interesting part of professional league for me , and watching these teams play is depressing , i like to believe that koreans are not genius ( aside from faker ) and these guys are pretty smart , but it looks more and more like they are just stubborn and do n't care about trying to play the game above a reactionary mode ( aka yoloq ) . 
  you ca n't spell na lcs without nacl ^ ^ no ^ ^ idea ^ ^ how ^ ^ to ^ ^ add ^ ^ sulfur ^ ^ to ^ ^ that ... i ^ ^ hate ^ ^ chemistry, 
  after yesterday 's matches the koreans are more depressed about being forced into possibly fighting na teams than laughing , here 's to c9 and lmq stepping up their game and giving a good enough fight . 
  there 's definitely a difference between single matches and bo5 , these bot 4 teams seem to have no idea how to adapt their champ select and comps from match to match , c9 tends to be very smart in their champ selects ^ allhailthelemonbook and against koreans these 4 teams would lose right out of champ select in my opinion :\\, 
  he has a forensics tab open , he 's obviously qualified to hide all his dirty secrets, 
  lyte said a couple of weeks ago that only like 20 % of the community can have honor badges at any single time and most of them belong to people that play a lot of bot games and arams ( where people tend to give honors more often ) , that 's why you rarely see them in people that play more sr. 
  they are changing it so that the % top people with honors in the all different queues get the badge . 
  that was the normal chinese scene drama following lmq all the way to na, 
  to be fair thoorins exagerations are less his personal opinions and more a way to get a reaction from the guests ( and co-host ) and start conversation , not my favorite type of `` interview '' setting , but he gets it done . 
  the only issue with monte in si that i agree with the rest of the community is that as clg 's coach he constantly ignores issues with is team , issues that he criticizes other teams for doing , but that 's normal bias i guess :\\, 
  true but prolly is known for being the joker ( and he even identifies himself as one ) but he has also shown great respect for professional gaming and knowledge about the game , i hope the context of si will let him talk more seriously about some issues . 
  that 's actually a pretty funny idea , then we only need baker pantheon and panths , zed and lulu can open the first champions of valoran bakery :d, 
  sorry , my hatred towards her blocked her from my mind , so we got top lulu , mid zed , jungle pantheon , supp morgana , now we only need a bakery themed adc , well caitlyn has her cupcake traps , good enough !, 
  he 's [ cone hair is freaking weird ] ( http://www.gr8game.in.th/statics/temp/lol/skin/malzahar/skin_03.jpg ) < _ < i prefer the djinn skin personally, 
  and it seems the minions probably scale with the same attack speed , so you stack cd for the attack speed and to maintain the minions and you can demolish towers alone o.o, 
  azir : `` i 'll push your lane , destroy your towers with my minions and then use the remains of your tower to destroy you !, 
  he 's an editor for a league news website [ surrender@20] ( http://www.surrenderat20.net/ ) , they are pretty well known for keeping tabs on any updates in the pbe and any new stuff coming out . 
   there 's very little in the way to stop his ult, 
  if you hard cc or silence him it stops the ults ... and crucible does n't work on suppressions . 
  fair enough , but you can hardly expect a coordinated engage after ww 's ults in soloq , at least in the lower levels of ranked . 
  still , on topic , the last news we got from his rework [ ( in april ) ] ( http://www.reignofgaming.net/news/27965-updated-warwicks-rework-full-kit-preview ) made him seem like a way more player input intensive champ , his w and e look way more fun, 
  i do n't know if this is what happened but once in si monte was complaining about players going into a match with the a pick and ban strategy planned and completely change their strategy to whatever they want at the moment once their start it :\\ again , not saying this is what happened , but i agree they lost at least 2 games in the pick & ban phase . 
  edit : this was about the necessity of having a coach with the teams during the pick & ban phase like they do in korea . 
  [ another perspective ] ( https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/t1.0-9/10620633_10154666560715556_5904882310022610984_n.jpg ) from league 's facebook page . 
  it 's the same team that made the katarina , tryndamere , ryze and [ ziggs statues ^ ^ sooo ^ ^ gud ] ( http://i.imgur.com/it0dhai.jpg ) , they are incredibly talented o_o, 
  i mostly enjoy his videos because it 's a group of random friends having fun playing league , besides , he 's a really nice guy and very friendly to viewers/fans . 
  [ and a increasing number of subscribers/viewers is kinda complex and gets influenced by other factors ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egmqhemhvv8 ) ^ ^ ironicallyihatepewdiepie, 
  but it helps us relate to thoorin , he 's a slob and human just like us , not the angry demon god of hate we like to think of him as d :, 
  ^ i 'm ^ just ^ kidding ^ ^ my ^ ^ room ^ ^ is ^ ^ actually ^ ^ worse, 
  i ca n't hear the song in that ad again , i 'm so sick of it , i 'm actually interested in the game but twitch repeating the same ad over and over again is doing exactly the opposite, 
  in my opinion , the biggest difference between curse and c9 this series was team communication , c9 was way more decisive in their plays and map movement , there were individual plays but the main force was the team synergy and focus which was incredible to watch . 
  my reaction , pretty much only use it to see if dragon/baron will be up in the next 60 secds :| but i also try to never play jungle ... 
  [ this should have been their theme during all-stars ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zbi0xmgtmw ) ^ ^ ^ shotsfired, 
  they just need to change the color palette after worlds and it 's done , quickest world championship skins ever . 
  you are right , from ctc season 2 announcement `` while we were bummed to hear tsm wanted to strictly focus on their play and would not be returning for a second time , we were more than thrilled to add counter logic gaming to the mix . '', 
  also they probably went for clg because of their huge fanbase , only second to tsm 's . 
  this is true , [ he said this in a interview with travis during pax ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=960pxhqvkbw&amp;list=uu7mwqn7ngj02etvoak7wkkw ), 
  god dammit that passive is more bugged than syndra 's balls < _ <, 
  do n't know if this is the correct thing to do , but if i lose lane i start building my defensive items first ( in the top lane ) or afk farming ( if i 'm mid ) . 
  i keep seeing people go 0/3/0 in the first 10 minutes and just keep building damage and scrimming the enemy laner when he has a level and item advantage :| ex : i had a gnar trying to finish his trinity force as first item at the 30 minute mark < _ <, 
  i had a friend right now go from stable 50 ping to 6000-7000 ping in team fights right now , every time the 10 players were together and only in those situations . 
  i presume she went for zephyr because of the tenacity passive and mov speed , since with that much ap she already had ( 4 ap items ) going with nashor 's tooth would be way better in most cases , it would increase the ad given by her shield , more cooldown ( for the trinity procs ) + given mixed damage aa 's thanks to nashor 's passive . 
  i was the exact oposite :| i got out of silver pretty quickly by spamming orianna , possibility of 1v1 outplays in lane [ check ] , can easily roam to help other lanes [ check ] , great in teamfights thanks to disorganized enemy team [ check ] ^ ^ so ^ ^ many ^ ^ 4/5 ^ ^ man ^ ^ shockwaves . 
  my only issue was actually forcing my team to join me for team fights - . -, 
  tl ; dr : orianna is broken as fuck , why do people think she 's balanced ? 
  [ no he will not ] ( https://twitter.com/cursexpecial/status/525049844679708672 ), 
  the convict udyr skin made me realized how a fun kigurumi skin , like gnar 's would be awesome on udyr . 
  / r/leagueoflegends is hardly the majority of league players ... 
  the surprise bird is the deadliest , splitpush top or bot , if the other team engages your team go full valor , reach the fight 5 seconds later , clean up the low enemy team in the back and help your team demolish the rest :d you can easily combo one squishy and if someone is low enough the execute damage of your ult is enough . 
  i 'm ok if they just nerf jungle pantheon , please leave lane pantheon alone he already has enough issues ( mostly sustain related + shitty late game ) but it 's tons of fun vs all the ap squishies going around in the top lane lately . 
  +1 ... alcohol + games/movies better company than dealing with the family honestly :|, 
  it would be more shocking if this was the first `` guy puts glass item up his ass and then it breaks '' gif/video i 've seen on the internet ... i need to reevaluate my life ... 
  i agree with pantheon , he 's my go to blind pick , there 's no real hard counter to him since you can easily adapt during the lanning phase to win or at least go equal in lane , if you know you ca n't kill the enemy laner and snowball your lane you can just roam mid and help snowball your mid . 
  if you build armor pen ( ghostblade/cleaver + lastwhisper ) and tanky items next you can transition easier to late game as an off tank and peel for your carries and still have damage to burst the enemy adc and apc if you catch them . 
  fuck akali , seriously i feel like buying pinks just so i can harass her , it 's super annoying as pantheon using your stun on her and you ca n't follow up because she goes invisible - . - ... i ended up just maxing e first , melts right through her , that bitch can hide but the spears always find her ass !, 
  too be fair that 's hans zimmer ripping off hans zimmer , i agree he did some really good soundtracks but with the quantity of osts he puts out every year , and like this example shows , most of his music sounds exactly the same < _ <,
