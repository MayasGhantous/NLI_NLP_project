  again , there 's many stuff you could say about riot skins , but you are going the wrong way about it . 
  let 's be honest here , bioware 's facial animations were never exactly high tier , even in the dragon age and original me trilogy they were barely a step above whatever bethesda does to their characters ( i bet it 's some sort of satanic ritual ) . 
  andromeda was only more obvious because it was full of bugs that made everything much worse . 
  i honestly would prefer visual/gameplay reworks every 2 months than a new champion every 2 months , if this champion does n't have any new interesting interaction or new mechanic it will pretty much solidify my opinion . 
   there is simply no way 400k players stop playing at the same time . 
  [ i want to believe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqorxhs7vlu ), 
  it was a joke mate ... pick one :, 
  a ) `` they were all abducted by aliens '', 
  b ) `` it 's a government conspiracy to stop the revolution '', 
  c ) `` they were dragged to hell '', 
  d ) `` they all got bought by riot and are now riot chills '', 
  on topic : it might just be an issue with the dota api, 
  holy shit , some of these guys are straight up delusional and have no understanding of how the world works , i swear most of them must be below 18 . 
   c9 has tons of fans , of course , they 're one of the best brands in esports . 
   but boston overwatch is owned by that guy who owns a little ( decently popular ) team called the new england patriots, 
   if rkk gets tom brady to wear a boston overwatch jersey once , and talk about it for a press conference , pretty sure they will draw in a bunch of fans . 
  yes because traditional sport orgs owning esport teams is something new , where were all those fans when schalke owned a eu lcs squad ? 
  are misfits getting a ton of fans thanks to being owned by the miami heat ? 
  do these kids really believe that robert the 44 year old boston truckdriver will start watching overwatch because tom brady wore a boston overwatch jersey in some random publicity stunt ? 
  do you think that jaime the 21 year old university jock that loves to watch the boston patriots with his buddies will randomly decide to support their ow team because they have an tenuous business relationship ? 
  that sounds super interesting , i wonder if npc behavior generated this way will result in something similar to the uncanny valley . 
  the uncanny valley happens because we evolved to identify facial patterns and markers , if something feels `` off '' like symmetry or wrong proportions we immediately identify it as alien . 
  now imagine observing procedurally generated behavior , small facial ticks , tone of voice , irregularities in speech pattern could definitely result in an way bigger uncanny valley obstacle to overcome . 
  let us take out the annoying as fuck siren from when you activate her e and i would actually use that skin . 
  it 's not really `` my thing '' but i see many indie games and smaller studios experimenting with story telling and different narratives , i guess most triple a studios just do n't think it 's viable to tell different stories when they can make it as generic and broad as possible to satisfy all demographics , you have the same issue with most blockbuster movies , look at all the marvel movies , they are all average stories wrapped around entertaining visuals , fun for the entire family . 
  i do n't know why you censored the shitposter dude , he 's a mini celebrity and easily identified by his bulshit statements + g2 flair . 
  [ here , have some anti-nazi protection ] ( http://www.myjewishlearning.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/bear-jew.jpg ) ^ ^ and ^ ^ shitty ^ ^ director, 
   it 's a bo3 . 
  plus , it 's one of two concurrent streams . 
  yeah ... those 19k ( twitch ) + 7k ( yt ) viewers on the other stream totally explain the missing viewership, 
   but 200k for 3 games ( + whatever nalcs2 is getting ) is just as good if not better than 400k for one single game . 
  sure it 's great for advertisers maybe , but less unique viewers , are you honestly defending that people did n't stop watching the lcs ? 
  the reality is that the lcs structure is boring as fuck for viewers and only benefits advertisers , who will quickly bail the moment the % of lost viewers increases more and more . 
  it 's 22h30/23h30 is most of western europe , and it 's summer , i doubt most league potential viewers have work/school tomorrow . 
  picks fiora :, 
  - builds full lifesteal, 
  - does n't splitpush vs a tank, 
  - gets 2 shot ` ed by corki because no mr. 
  i swear darshan saw the post in the front page and tried to lose on purpose, 
  i actually posted another thread here today about utilizing new software to edit voice acting and animations without the need of the actors to come back , [ some users also started talking about some other software and future ai that will be able to self-generate it 's own animations and behaviors ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/games/comments/6rxtmq/could_the_emergent_voice_editing_and_facial/dl8kwmy/ ) . 
  pretty interesting stuff that would circumvent the issues that la noire had, 
  ... yeah , weird how blizzard keeps pushing out the number of accounts created ( which is meaningless ) instead of active monthly players or active concurrent players for their multiplayer only game . 
  numbers sure speak for themselves . 
  he 's mobility used to be much harder to pull off , but riot streamlined the animations so you can `` buffer '' the combo , so pretty much everyone can easily do a shurima shuffle . 
  riot announced they are going to rework him already , and last time i checked the league sub community apparently want riot to remove all his mobility and make him a generic ap auto attacking champion . 
  honestly the first trailer they released looked incredibly like a generic `` low-budget '' young adult fantasy movie , kid goes to alternative earth meets a bunch of weird people and saves both worlds , the only reason why i did n't directly think that was because this sub had been talking about it for months and about how incredible it was going to be , the first trailer was like getting hit with a bucket of cold water ... but even less exciting than that . 
  '' ** 3 teams ** from south korea , ** china ** , north america , europe and taiwan/hong kong/macau '', 
  also it 's in china this year , that would be the stupidest thing ever . 
  apparently ... last time i saw a thread about the azir reworked i argued that all they need to do is make his damage dependable of dps ` ing with his soldiers autos while re-positioning his squishy self with his mobility abilities . 
  azir 's issue during the last time he was a s tier midlaner was because he could consistently chunk people out with conquering sands and 2 soldier autos + thunderlords . 
  all they had to do to make him viable and more fair would be :, 
  1 - remove the damage from conquering sands . 
  you can reduce the ability cooldown and make it exclusively about repositioning the soldiers instead of a spam poke ability . 
  2 - make the soldiers apply on-hit effects , so that azir has more possibilities for itemization , seriously there 's only 2 attackspeed `` ap '' items and they both suck on azir because he does n't proc the on-hit effects with soldiers . 
  this would also allow him to use other more ad centric items like botrk . 
  sidenote : i 'm pretty sure they gave up on kayle as well . 
  that 's being naive , triple a studios pick the roles and appearance of their characters according to what focus groups tell them it will help sell the most , the reality is that gaming is still a mostly male industry ( if you ignore all the mobile market ) , and for many publishers the mentality that boys ca n't relate to female characters besides lusting over them is still very much ingrained in their heads . 
  this is n't to say that female lead games ca n't sell well , just look at horizon zero dawn , but when publishers see it 's success they think `` well , aloy is pretty attractive '' instead of `` well , aloy is a pretty interesting and unique character '', 
   hussain : `` i want the regular season split to be shorter and the playoffs to have double elimination '', 
  oh god yes please , seriously people keep talking about lcs players lacking personality and that 's why there 's less viewership . 
  no , it 's because there 's a huge saturation of league of legends pro-matches right now and people get easily burned out during the regular season thanks to most games being meaningless or just do n't feel that impactful . 
  i understand riot will never let go of their golden goose and create an open tournament system , but at least reduce the boring as fuck regular season and increase the playoffs where each match has some actual repercussions . 
  there 's a reason why people get excited even for the relegation matches , because there 's the possibility of a team ( even a shitty one ) to lose their spot in the lcs , that 's pretty big and creates hype around the relegation matches . 
  it 's chasing the white rabbit , if something has been successful just try to copy the formula as best as possible and hope you get similar results . 
  same thing happens in the movie industry , how many young romantic adult novels were made after twilight , how many teens survival movies were made after the hunger games , wash and repeat . 
  color within the lines as much as possible to reduce the danger of your investment going down the drain , that 's why the most interesting games and movies are almost always low budget/indie stuff , you just ca n't justify being `` bold '' when you have people investing 200 + million dollars in your project . 
  i was talking about eli roth ... 
  eli roth is the guy that play the bear jew , he also directed the nazi propaganda movie inside inglorious basterds , and it 's probably his best work , since his other best known works are the hostel movies , which are hot garbage lol . 
  it 's not like comic book adaptations have been all successes , wanted was a critical bomb ( even though it pretty much only shared the name with the graphic novel ) , you mention image comics , did you know powers got a tv show adaption ? 
  well , do n't worry if you do n't , not many people did since it was quickly cancelled . 
  still i agree with you , i do n't understand why netflix is n't jumping into a deal with image as soon as possible , so many great graphic novels coming out in the last decade from them and most do n't even need that big of a budget , they could get the cw crowd with a show based on deadly class or the wicked + the divine , imagine a comedy based on chew or a slightly more raunchy comedy from sex criminals , or an animated show based of invicible . 
  i would literally murder someone for some weird sci-fi shows based on east of west , the manhattan projects , fuck just get remender 's black science and fear agent please or the probably impossible to ever be produced besides by hbo , saga , i want more good spacy science fiction tv shows goddammit , the expanse is not enough . 
  speaking of saga , hey netflix , buddies , brian k. vaugh is also a screenwriter , he worked for lost , get him to make y : the last man into a tv show . 
  [ champion page btw ] ( http://na.leagueoflegends.com/featured/champion-reveal-ornn ), 
  yup , they should seriously just focus on the champion reworks in my opinion , they are going at the rate of 1 new release for each 1 rework . 
  at least this one has some new mechanics , the shop everywhere passive , is able to break player terrain , has a new status effect that synergies with other champions . 
  same ca n't be said about the last 4 releases , which the only thing that they added to the game was make the mobility creep worse . 
  ( camile with that stupid hook , birdman with the out of screen dash , and the 2fast2edgy boy with the terrain passing ), 
  is there a vod anywhere ? 
  i was n't home :\\, 
  also , i 've only seen a grainy clip of pentatonix on twitter ... but seriously pentatonix now , and stirling last year ... nothing against them , i used to enjoy them both but i never associated `` x factor turned youtube music celebrities '' with dota 's demographic ... 
  oh , my mistake then , saw 4 guys and a girl singing acapella concluded it was pentatonix since they are the only ones i know by name . 
  russian acapella group makes much more sense with dota 's demographic, 
  1 ) thanks bro, 
  2 ) fuck i know a girl that looks exactly like slacks o_o, 
  yup he seems a bit bloated , i think the w is the worst offender :,

  there 's already [ the otter dude ] ( https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/a/a1/red_team_shopkeeper.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140705051214 ) , not furry enough for you ? 
  it 's riot being bipolar again , `` we love clarity '' + `` but we also love to make abilities that do so many things at the same time that we need to ask the community for help to explain the tooltips '', 
  having aghs in league would be fun as fuck , but riot hates having fun items ... 
  dota 2 : if everyone is op nothing is op, 
  league : if everything is spaghetti , nothing is spaghetti ... it 's a feature . 
  holy shit it 's actually bingo :o i 'll pay the first beer round . 
  neither the nunu nor the singed support are banned , they accounts have been active in the last month . 
  actually , 2015 had a bigger diversity than 2016 , 74 champions picked , 2016 was god awful yet people complain about how in 2015 riot fucked everything with the juggernauts patch . 
  honestly riot should fuck shit up more often , if nobody knows what 's op at least that will fake some sort of diversity with people trying to figure it out .
