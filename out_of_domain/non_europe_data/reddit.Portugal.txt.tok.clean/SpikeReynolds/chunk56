  that 's griff , he 's mod and a total attention whore , he `` created '' a forced meme about himself and then asked the rest of the mods to not remove the spam related to his obnoxious `` joke '' . 
  sorry , every time they get mentioned people usually say they got permabanned, 
  still , riot released an [ official statement ] ( https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/etxqhs5j-weore-updating-our-policy-so-unusual-play-styles-dont-get-14-day-bans ) about not giving bans anymore to people that play unusual roles but are still dedicated to winning . 
  case in point : there was a youtuber that was tagged by the automated system a few months ago for playing `` proxy '' tryndamere , he contacted riot support explaining his strategy , and they removed his lock in less than 24 hours . 
  you really ca n't compare sr to dota 's map , it 's not even close from a visual design standpoint . 
  sure the update was an improvement but it 's already looking dated , just look at [ dota 's special `` reskin '' for the ti this year ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9abjbewttcm ) , even the standard dota map is much more `` alive '' then league 's . 
  that video is garbage though , it 's so badly structured and it barely explains more important aspects of the game that would be more useful to league players watching a dota match , like buybacks , how vision works , runes , etc. 
  i guess that might be something to get used to once you are more familiarized with the map . 
  i personally think sr is getting too claustrophobic when compared to dota 's 2 map , specially now with the plants and with so many big aoe abilities , it 's almost impossible to watch teamfights in pro matches nowadays , more than ever before . 
  stuff like galio 's ult or the new champ 's huge ass fire ram , do n't seem suitable to sr size , i think they need to widen the lanes and make the jungle slightly more open up . 
  it 's just something you get used to , most people do n't play enough to get through that discomfort . 
  it 's like playing a ton of league/dota where the movement is done by mouse click and then start playing an action rpg , with a similar camera perspective but where the movement is done with wasd , it can feel weird at the start , it 's about getting used to a different feel of movement input . . 
  if you play a ton of league where your character just turns immediately , once you start playing dota with turn-rates it feels `` laggy '' because you do n't have the immediate input you usually get in league . 
  the human brain loves finding patterns everywhere , it 's the exact same thing as seeing different objects/animals in clouds . 
  they were n't banned though , op gave no evidence to that ... 
  edit : [ mods removed thread ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/leagueofmeta/comments/6senc4/getting_banned_for_this_pacifist_ascension_game/ ) 1, 
  we facebook chat now boys !, 
  on topic : i hope this includes lcs related emotes as part of the new revenue streams . 
  '' [ having the same question on all these `` features '' ] ( https://youtu.be/etxmccsmod0?t=47s ) '', 
  apparently riot did n't learn with jinx , it 's actually hilarious seeing riot doing over and over again the same `` balance '' mistakes , it 's like there 's no one actually leading their balance team , someone yelled `` gut cait 's attackspeed , it feels amazing to barely be able to auto early game as an adc ! '', 
  and the rest of the team just collectively said `` meh fine we do n't care '' . 
  that 's exactly the issue with riot 's balacing at times , they nerfed jinx attackspeed , it was awful , they reverted the nerfs ... then why are they doing the same to cait ? 
  to in the future revert them again ? 
  this just screams `` we do n't want cait at worlds '' like many people are saying here , so instead of trying to balance a champion to make the game healthier they are nerfing her in hopes of pushing other adcs over her for entertainment 's sake . 
  watch the man from u.n.c.l.e. 
  if you want to see charismatic henry cavill , it 's a fun spy movie, 
  [ this one ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo5uevzx9jc ) it 's just on private , you can still find it with the link in her twitch page apparently, 
  earlier this year she went to a mental institution to get help for a few weeks . 
  she was doing well when she worked for geek and sundry a couple of years ago , but i guess g&s decided to restructure and fired most of their vloggers nika included . 
  i wish moretz would name the guy so he 'd be burned for that, 
  in what world do you think something like this would burn an actor ? 
  not only are this things mostly sweep under the rug but even if there 's some press about it , after a couple of weeks there another different scandal and people forget about it . 
  how many murderers/rapists/wife beaters still have no issue finding work in the movie and music industry ? 
  compared to that people will just say the guy just said some mean words to chloe and she should just get over it since it was years ago . 
  yeah , poor casey affleck sure had trouble getting more work and even getting an oscar after several high profile industry people spoke against him , brie larson even refused to touch him and clap for him while giving him the oscar , and last time i checked his career is doing fine . 
  i ca n't remember if you could do it with gangplank 's voice over 2 years ago , i hope you can , or at least make it exclusive to normal matches , valley girl voices tilt the living shit out of me . 
  rip :, 
  - strife, 
  - infinite crisis, 
  - awesomenauts ( do n't know if it 's alive now as f2p ), 
  - guardians of middle-earth, 
  also smite , hots and hon have nowhere near the same playerbase that dota and league have , ncsoft also just released their own new moba to little fanfare master x master . 
  there 's also a ton of dead mobile mobas , with vainglory being the only kinda successful one in the west , and tencent 's league clone being the biggest mobile game in the east, 
  i guess we could consider battleborn a moba and we know how that ended , right now in the same ballpark of third-person moba we have the newly released gigantic and paragon coming out , so lets see how they do . 
  nah , they just want you to pay for [ the skin with the better model ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6pxfixdbje ), 
  no idea , i think i only played 1 or 2 matches of that mode , i do n't care much about riot 's special modes . 
  honestly , since valve/steam refuse to have some sort of actual professional curation from their part i really just want some better search tools for games in their store . 
  for me personally i would love a system that would allow me to just remove options from showing up . 
  like if i 'm looking for an rpg but i hate turn-based rpgs , let me remove all games from the list with the turn-based rpg tag , and let me organize the resulting list by `` most hours played '' or by `` overall user review '' or `` current user review '' , there 's a bunch of different stats and tags associated to each game it should be easier to narrow down something than with the barebones system implemented right now . 
  and in this case , we could just remove all games that came from direct from showing up in the list . 
  if all of this is already an option then i 'm sorry but steam does n't help people find these stuff . 
  edit : why ca n't i just go to the strategy games section remove all [ shooters ] [ simulators ] , order the list by current user reviews , narrow down the price from between 10 $ -30 $ . 
  is something like this so hard to implement ? 
  i was actually was thinking the other day how i never see italian pro-players in either of the 3 big esports , is there a reason for that ? 
  it 's not 20m yet , it 's 5m to enter and 15 over a certain period , similar to na lcs . 
  i still think it 's going to bomb , and seeing teams like nrg and immortals lose a ton of investment might dissuade future investors for even thinking about backing other teams in other titles in the future , but i guess the young prodigy noah whinston sees something in the owl league that no other endemic org sees . 
  my last interaction with the ps store was on the ps3 and all i remember was spending hours trying to find something , even their search engine was buggy as fuck , i guess it did n't improve in the new generation ? 
  i wonder if they will face the same issue that they had with dota , people are already too invested into heartstone and it will be hard to drag people out of that game . 
   riot games is still a `` one hit wonder '' , this is a real test for them to break away from that title and see if they can actually be a real competitor in the gaming market . 
  hey , they made a table top game as well , that counts for the s in rito games !, 
  yeah , after evo i was pretty sure they scrapped the project and hoped nobody would talk about radiant again , but they did invite arc system works to their studios , maybe they showed them something there and asked for some tips since asw is pretty hot right now . 
  i really just want a new game from them to see if riot was really just lucky with league and at their core they are a shitty game dev studio . 
  [ it was already posted ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/dotamasterrace/comments/6s73pc/i_swear_to_god_riot_is_producing_a_new_champion/ ) just in case you are wondering why people are downvoting . 
  if possible you would then be able to remove games with the tags for sandbox and multiplayer games to then only get something different , that 's what i meant . 
  `` only games from [ 2015 ] to [ 2017 ] '' , more options is always better . 
  hmmm i do n't know , i do n't feel like league of legends has the same level of fandom as other titles do , like , league is `` the biggeztz game in ze world '' yet none of it 's characters jumped into gaming 's popculture , we can bitch about blizzard and overwatch but they marketed the living shit out of their characters , go see any `` top 10 female characters in gaming '' list and you will probably see tracer there even though the game is only 1 year old , i seriously doubt any female character from league would even show up there . 
  what i mean is , the entire playerbase of league plays it for the game itself , and league and it 's characters did n't transcend the game like other games do , they are n't a brand name like warcraft , final fantasy , metal gear . 
  well , this for now is all speculation since to prove my point riot would have to make another game , but i honestly feel the league of legends brand ca n't sustain another game . 
  i never noticed slacks bald spot , i guess that 's the benefit of being tall as fuck . 
  when i posted something similar after valve announced the siltbreaker campaign for this year 's compendium almost half of the comments were people saying `` i do n't care about lore or pve , i play league for ranked and riot should just focus on improving my ranked experience '' , this sub is n't representative of the entire community though , to be fair . 
  [ valar morghulis ] ( https://media.tenor.com/images/7727a60ef2108a29c24f228a096b9e38/tenor.gif ), 
  well , it 's not like the vast majority of us can confirm if the guy above you is telling the truth or not, 
  20 * now because of the new ban system ( 10 possible bans + 10 possible picks ), 
  mate , the lcs is in berlin and l.a. , lck is in seoul , and none of them can fill weekly their small 100 seats arenas , do you think that will change for overwatch ? 
  yes , and how many of those users were from free trial accounts ? 
  in may they had the free weekend on pc/ps4/xbox and china had the entire month free access to the game , are you telling me that did n't increase artificially the mau for that month ? 
  just like they keep saying `` accounts created '' instead of games bought , because they know people created multiple accounts in pc bangs while it was still possible . 
  you ca n't conclude that because `` record play time '' does n't indicate directly a record mau . 
  also '' included a player\u2010versus\u2010environment mode that drew record play time '' , is that compared to the overall play time of the game , or compared to other pve modes/special modes ? 
  you understand how these statements can be misleading right ? 
  tf2 's diversity comes from the weapons each class has , which are quite a few right now , you ca n't compare tf2 classes = ow heroes, 
  and let 's dispel once and for all with this fiction that riot does n't know what they are doing . 
  they know exactly what they are doing ... in this case , they are introducing features to keep the community happy because they started losing people with the shitstorm that was the soloq removal last year . 
  i never understood this mentality of thanking developers , they do n't do things from the goodness of their hearts , it 's intrinsically connected to them making more money , it 's marketing . 
  there 's nothing wrong with it , we get free shit and new features , and a few people probably buy a new skin/champion/loot box because they want to `` thank '' riot for the `` support '' , it 's a win/win situation i guess, 
  i was just pointing out that you ca n't just compare class to heroes . 
  but honestly pointing to tf2 as a `` balanced '' class-based game is complicated , [ funke has a pretty interesting video about it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uivttr4amy&amp;list=plo1m-hccl5lrj5pt3ltp8oyncmjgnhpdt&amp;index=5 ), 
  that 's a stupid analogy , people cleaning the movie theater do n't get a bonus for cleaning extra garbage , riot does receive more money if they introduce more features . 
  also , i 'm the asshole but you are the one that started your argument by insulting me . 
  this is a new documentary series around game developers , the channel is also new and it 's an offshot of chainsawsuit original , a channel created by mike neumann , previously gearbox writer for borderlands ( and voice of scooter ) . 
  there 's also 2 previous episodes :, 
  episode 1 - [ young horses ( octodad ) - here we are , having a company ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcpjfkmbnp8 ), 
  episode 2 - [ william chyr ( manifold garden ) - the hermit of hyde park ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_3kdnr3o4 ), 
  lol they made 1.7 billion in revenue last year . 
  are you seriously comparing the production costs/distribution/marketing of a cars manufacturer to a video game developer that the only thing they produce are virtual goods and their biggest costs are the maintenance of servers ? 
  also most big tech companies are notorious for having negative net income ( like it was recently announced by netflix ) because they invest in the development of their product over years before seeing any real profit , do you think riot 's recent `` investments '' in the game overshadow the revenue they are making with league ? 
  ok smartass lets put it in a different context , op is criticizing riot for being greedy by releasing pretty much only 1350 + rp skins this year , while in previous years they also released a bunch of cheaper 750rp skins . 
  you argued that the reason for this , is worlds coming up and worlds is expensive , so you are arguing that worlds this year for some reason is going to be incredibly more expensive than worlds 2015/2016 , since riot did n't see the need to release only high tier skins in the previous years to cover the costs of worlds . 
  your initial logic makes no sense .
