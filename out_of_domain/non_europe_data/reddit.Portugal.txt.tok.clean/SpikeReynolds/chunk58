  you are a tank that got behind ? 
  well good luck doing your job since you will be melted in seconds . 
  you are a carry top laner that was n't able to snowball , well good luck being useless for the rest of the match since you ca n't teamfight nor splitpush . 
  tl ; dr : you never see champions that are n't strong and safe early , or that at least can go even with other s tier champions in the meta , since there 's no way for them to be useful if they fall behind . 
  league of legends meta game pushes safe picks into the top , and makes it almost impossible for risky picks to happen . 
  edit : this also relates to the part you said about most abilities not having that great of an impact , since this means that a champion from behind really ca n't do shit to help his team . 
  the part about wanting to be human was a lie , since he went to several other planets before reaching earth , it wanted peter to think that he met his mother while searching for meaning , fell in love with her , and they had peter . 
  i still prefer the comics version of his father though . 
  i really wish that riot was able to balance the game so that playing 50 % of the roster was n't considered a `` troll pick '' . 
   stop karma whoring maine !, 
  there 's nothing like relaxing in dmr after being in the lol sub trying to argue with morons and their delusional circlejerk about the declining shitty viewership of eu lcs . 
  releasing champions with passive steroids in every single ability is n't really the high standard of `` balance '' either though and that does n't stop riot from doing it . 
  same with supercell ( clash of clans etc. ) . 
  from what i read , supposedly tencent does n't pretend they know anything about gaming , at their core they are a tech company , they do n't make games so when they invest into game studios they trust them to do their thing . 
  the only recent moment when we know tencent actually used their influence on riot was during the 2016 owners vs riot clusterfuck , where tencent pretty much forced riot to implement all the new revenue streams and the up-and-coming franchise for na lcs . 
  he 's only getting money from the sales made in the netherlands though . 
  seriously i do n't understand why valve does n't push for cs : go in asian countries , they could easily dethrone sudden attack and crossfire if they were smart with the marketing . 
  league and dota had the exact same number of viewers in those charts , is it because dota caters to their crippling pay to win addiction, 
  as well ? 
  you do n't need to be dismissive of an entire group of people just to criticize league ... 
  games are clown fiestas if the players die for making stupid decisions , you can have high kill scores and not be a clown fiesta if the player was outplayed , but right now it seems in pro-play they just do n't have enough tools to force an out-play most of the times . 
   pros go for the strategies that gives them the highest chance of winning . 
  gambling in the early game reduces both team 's security because the winner might be decided by that early gamble . 
  and you do n't think that it 's bad that the only strategy viable in pro-play is to play as safe as possible early game instead of trying to snowball ? 
   early game kills are already incentivized because the player get a massive advantage against their lane opponent that can continue to snowball . 
  and first blood gives a little extra gold . 
  you also have the opposite happening exactly because of that massive disadvantage you can get if you die , if a pro player gets ganked and has to blow is flash , you can be damn sure that for the next 3 minutes he wo n't move 1 cm more than he has to for farm , which results of 3 minutes of nothing happen because the person without flash has to play passive otherwise he gets super behind and is useless for the rest of the match . 
  all i want is some diversity in early game strategies , most of the times it seems farming for 15-20 minutes with the jungler occasionally ganking to blow a couple of summoners is what most often happens, 
   early game kills might be cool in dota ( because that 's what you are talking about , let 's be open , we do n't bite ), 
  shhh , that 's a forbidden word in this sub , also ti just ended hence the question , even though dota does occasionally have low kill counts early games it 's not the standard . 
  also we ca n't really just translate directly dota early game to league 's because there 's a ton of different mechanics at work , dota has lower death timers , tp scrolls , and the fact that deaths cause people to lose gold also incentivizes aggressive plays . 
  i do think riot could make early game less passive within their game 's mechanics . 
  ignoring all the dota vs league discussion , you ca n't say that pro league of legends would n't be a million times more entertaining than having the same 30-40 champions on constant rotation during a patch when there 's 137 right now . 
  people play league because `` every game is different and you never know what you are playing with and against '' , except if you are watching pro-league where p&b is a solved system and there 's rarely any big surprise picks , just look at when ls was a caster at lck and he would `` guess '' pretty much all picks and bans , that 's because p & b is incredibly stagnant . 
  people will argue that `` oh that 's not true , you can play anything in soloq '' and `` challenger is full of weird one-tricks you can play anything '' , which makes no sense , the reason why so many picks are n't used in pro-play is because they ca n't survive the organized play environment of pro-play , and riot does n't seem to really care about it , they are fine with most of their champions only being viable in soloq . 
  people keep saying that the best big thing will come and dethrone the big 3 , but they keep seeing growth and breaking records year and year . 
  people forget that the gaming industry 10-8 years ago was wildly different from the one right now , streaming and esports definitely affect the longevity of a title , it also helps that these games see continuous development and support , something that was also very rare in the past . 
  i considered posting it on the league sub , but there 's no point , it will get downvoted and circlejerk about this not being an issue , delusional monkeys ... 
  saw it on twitter mate i did n't write this . 
  how is this news any different from the posts last year about ow getting ahead in pc bangs ? 
  you do n't need to be dismissive of other games , it is interesting to see a casual viewership declining for league , dota and cs : go are still in the top 5 viewership in twitch pretty much every month , yet they would probably be out if you ignored the esport viewership . 
  league might be going the same path , with people watching more the esport scene than casual streamers . 
  there 's a big mentality in gaming of going around from title to title , just look at / r/games , weeks and weeks of non-stop posts about witcher 3 , then dark souls 3 , then zelda , then whatever big game comes out next that gives them that brand new game hype `` high '' . 
  i guess the fact that many players there are console gamers and consoles thrive on this gaming cycle mentality might have something to do with it though . 
  [ hmm ... i 'm sorry ] ( https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/fma/images/3/38/nina-profile.png/revision/latest?cb=20131114163720 ), 
  meh , they still keep putting out champions that do n't bring anything new to the game , they are just remakes of concepts of other champions ( cough camille = fiora cough ) . 
  from the last 10 champions they made , including ornn , only 3 are somewhat unique and have an interesting design :, 
  - ornn , with the store passive , destroys walls ; new debuff status ;, 
  - ivern , the first and only true support jungler , that interacts with the jungle in a different way , and can create bushes . 
  his design was so different that he broke the game and had to be nerfed to the ground, 
  - jhin , which is one of the best concept-to-practice champions that riot was able to do , he plays like no other adc and his mechanical quirks make him super satisfying to play , also , it 's weird how league players do n't complain about the reload mechanic feeling stiff or slow , it 's almost like it 's a balance thing ... 
  sidenote : both ornn and ivern were done by the same designer , which started working recently at riot , ivern was his first champ, 
  wait wait wait ... but i 've seen photos of her ... i thought it was a mtf trans because she still dresses and looks like a female , so , she decided she is a boy but still maintains her biological female appearance ? 
  he and varus where 100 % pick banned during january and february this year i think , because of the lethality item changes and the fact that all other ad carries were garbage . 
  i know personally many trans people ( mostly ftm ) , there 's biological genetic or hormonal basis for transpeople to feel the need to be their opposite gender ( maybe even cultural and societal but that 's harder to prove ) , but my argument is that these people usually feel a certain repulse about looking like their biological gender , that 's why they change their name and try to `` pass '' by the opposite gender . 
  this girl decided she is a boy , but apparently has no need to do any of that , she 's a girl that just says she 's a boy . 
  lore does n't make money , most league players do n't give a shit about it , even people here do n't care much about it . 
  the reworked vorpal spikes to a having a pretty big slow and the changes to the feast stacks not going away at death made him viable , the interaction with stoneplate just made him s-tier, 
  in concept i like the stars around him being the majority of his dps , sol is all around positioning correctly and constant dps , but i absolutely hate the fact that his stars disappear if he is hit by any sort of cc , it 's super punishing because if you get cc ` ed , after the stun he still does a stupid long 0.5 seconds animation for the stars to form again around him + the time needed for them to expand , it makes him extremely clunky in teamfights because besides the stars his other abilities are pretty meh . 
  edit : i love his voice acting though , pompous bastard , i love him . 
  ignoring the fact that skt 's m.o. 
  is pretty much just farm farm farm and run around taking towers/objectives until they can set up a 1-3-1 push and win ( i fucking hate them for this ) . 
  league at the pro level just does n't allow aggressive plays in the early game for several reasons :, 
  early game ganking is hard because ** everybody has free wards ** + ** there 's no items to help junglers/supports gank ** . 
  if the enemy has vision of you , it 's pretty much impossible to die in a gank . 
  ** flash is a thing ** . 
  ok imagine that you are able to sneak around wards , you gank the enemy , most of the times the enemy will use his escape and/or flash to dodge any cc ability you have ( which are almost always skillshots ) and you are now almost under his tower , even if he 's at 50 % health , you ca n't dive him cause the tower will most definitely kill you in just 3 shots , so you just back off and mark ~ ~ 3 ~ ~ 5 minutes in chat ( duration of flash cooldown ) . 
  guess what will happen to that laner for the next ~ ~ 3 ~ ~ 5 minutes ? 
  he will just farm under tower and be as passive as possible . 
  since the mere possibility of dying in the early game is catastrophic in league , you could easily be 1 full level behind if you die pre-6 for the rest of the match . 
  so pro-players will just play super safe and almost never go for aggressive plays if their flash is down , that 's the issue , once flash is down they will never ever go aggressive . 
  combine 1 +2 +3 and most of the games are : jungler ganks lane - blows flash - flashless enemy now has to play passive for ~ ~ 3 ~ ~ 5 minutes - wash and repeat until teamfights start happening . 
  you 're right it 's 300 seconds , i had a brainfart, 
  from all the possible current middle eastern actress working , you pick a brazilian ? 
  the issue in my opinion is that since there 's no tp scrolls , in league if you die , not only did you give exp + gold to the enemy , you are also losing gold and exp from your respawn timer + exp/gold from the time that takes you to leave the fountain and reach the lane again . 
  dude , riot is finally open to at least modify their summoners , including flash , and the first thing their thought was ... `` what if we made flash a channel but with the same distance ! '', 
  * clap clap * genius * clap clap *, 
  there 's 1 conference room and 3 mini-conference rooms + they can use the extra league scrim room if needed , it would n't make sense to design the space from scratch with the dota squad in mind if they were n't going to use it the majority of time . 
  it 's not like all their other titles have special rooms either, 
  - increase map size, 
  - introduce tp scrolls, 
  - ^ introduce ^ buybacks, 
  - ^ ^ introduce ^ ^ ton ^ ^ of ^ ^ items ^ ^ with ^ ^ actives, 
  - ^ ^ ^ introduce ^ ^ ^ actually ^ ^ ^ interesting ^ ^ ^ champions, 
  - ^ ^ ^ ^ make ^ ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ ^ dota, 
  league laneswaps are not exactly the same as dota laneswaps , in league it was a 3v0 lane bot and top , with the 3 man squad taking eachother 's towers rotating to the opposite lane and doing the same again , there was some micro decisions mostly about gold distribution and wave management but that was pretty much it . 
  this would take 7-9 minutes with teams just fighting the towers and with no action happening . 
  an improvement over the laneswap meta from 2 years ago , where it was a 4v0 lane top with the enemy 4v0 the bot lane , and they would kill all tier 1 and tier 2 towers from bot and top lane , that was minimum 15 minutes with nobody fighting . 
  honestly , i do n't thing slacks and his followers gangbanging the kid while he was trying the game out was the best idea , he looks like a small streamer , he probably got slightly overwhelmed . 
  hmmm how the fuck did you find this post ? 
  lol, 
  `` dota does n't care about cosmetics '', 
  - highest revenue of any valve title, 
  - only thing you can buy are cosmetics, 
  ] ( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/993/875/084.png ), 
  not that there 's anything wrong with that , but that 's a weird ass statement to make , specially since valve is doing the dota card game exactly because dota brings so much money just with cosmetics , which means their players will be more willing to spend money on cards . 
  i think you are in the wrong masterrace sub mate . 
  no ... no it does n't 80 % of the fights are close ups + jump cuts , and slow motion close ups , it 's fucking awful , and yes i know jessica and cage do n't really fight , but they could have been more original with how they behaved in fights , it was boring as fuck . 
  also fuck cinematography , lets make it all as fucking dark as possible and use boring ass camera angles , standard shot - cut - standard shot . 
  what happened to how engaging the fights in dd were ?
