  and when for some retarded reason it repeats 3 or 4 times before stopping , a couple of months ago happened all the time for me :\\ like 5 minutes of ads to watch a stream . 
  do n't know if it 's a incredibly stupid idea but i usually like to go ham with full armor pen runes ( 9x reds 3x quints ) for 19 straight armor pen , it reduces the damage you could do thanks to your ad scaling on q during lanning but its a safer option for damage later even if you do bad in lane , 19 runes + 10 bc + 30 % last whisper , is good enough to help chunk the carries , and i like to go tanky after . 
  i think lyte said a couple of months ago ribbons are only given to the top % of summoners honored in all queues , and people tend to honor more in bot games and arams so the majority of ribbons are in bot only or aram only accounts , they want to rework the system to the top % for each queue . 
  there 's normals for a reason , if you want to play with your friends do it in other queues , do n't fuck over other people to do it . 
  her e is way too strong right now in terms of base damage relative to it 's cooldown when you hit your q or w ( which is n't that hard ), 
  , you can easily go agroo at level 2 and 100-0 the enemy if you have ignite because they never expect the shred from 3 ~ 4 es in a row and get an early lead . 
  she still has zero escapes and gets fucked by hard engages or chain cc but if you know how to position in teamfights the speed boost from q plus your ult if they jump on you helps keeping you alive , not ignoring the insane spellvamp from the e 's passive . 
  she overall has insane damage late game ( you can even go with a tankier build if needed roa or abyssal etc , and deal tons of sustain damage ) and can kite anyone ( except akali ... fuck akali ), 
  movement quints are a way better option ( specially on veigar ) early and late game on mages if you do n't want the early ap . 
  this resulted on many double toplaners/double midlaners , or worse ... supp nidalee < __ <, 
  she 's pretty shitty at peeling for the adc which is what most adc 's want from their supports , and her damage needs items to scale well , if you are really playing supp you need to buy sightstone and at least 1 support item delaying even more her possible damage , if you want damage poke supports there are way better ones like zyra or karma who can do the same ( if not more ) damage and have peel/disengage . 
  also people get pissed off because like i said some nidalee 's tend to be frustrated midlaners that got stuck with supp and do n't even buy sightstone and steal cs . 
  believe , got poe , vici and kikis as my first picks , trust the pink unicorn hypetrain :d, 
  instead of a team playing 2 teams in 2 different days , they just play 1 team in 1 day , better preparation for a specific team and a more enjoyable series for the viewers . 
  bo1 make no sense unless you want to have a popular team play every day so that it 's fans stay tuned * cough * tsm * cough * . 
  it already was s\u00f8ren 10-4-5 on cass yesterday :|, 
  i still prefer the attack speed ap magic resistance shred kayle , even more now with so many double ap comps and ap damage supports that are showing up ( i missed you annie < 3 ), 
  also , [ obligatory kayle bot guide ] ( http://www.lolpro.com/guides/kayle/475-kayle-build-guide-solo-lane-by-kayle-bot ), 
  nashor 's  sorc 's  runnan 's  void staff ~ absyssal ( which one first is situational )  zhonia 's, 
  i do n't like wit 's end as an item , i avoid it like a plague : <, 
  had packet loss for about a minute before i restarted the client and everything , it was fine after that ... but it was enough for the enemy akali , not having me in lane , to roam and get 3 kills :| ^ ^ * westillwonteamworkop, 
  sorc 's + morello + deathcap + zhonias + void staff ... lich bane ? 
  :| i guess it would help her to deal more sustain damage which seems to be the type of mage riot wants her to be :\\, 
  nah the most enjoyable is almost killing them with ult and see them run a away and flash while your q is traveling towards them , and you see the +1 stack after you killed them  :d * with final boss skin *, 
  does the final boss animation change ? 
  o.o never noticed , too busy killing people in fights * evil laugh *, 
  style points , it 's all about the style points, 
  sidenote : got so fed yesterday i was 100-0 their azir and syndra with just ult , i felt soooo dirty doing it though < . <, 
  oh yeah ... the zed dilemma ... `` zed is so easy to counter , just build zhonias or qss '' ... thanks rito - . - . 
  but to be fair veigar is easily countered if you have an ad bruiser or tank with mercs that just jumps on him and keeps him away from the carries , he has no mobility ability to jump on you and delete you and unless he is incredibily fed he needs to land his stun to combo with w and kill you . 
  like i said in another comment , zed 's entire counterplay is building an item and people do n't seem to have a problem with him . 
  if you ca n't dodge the stun , you have cleanse , qss , your supp can build crucible , those seconds while veigar 's stun is down he is extremely vunerable and you can just jump on him and kill him . 
  stole blue with leona 's zenith blade ... 5 minutes later stole dragon with her ult ... it was a fun match ^ ^, 
  only because of the mov speed and attack speed steroids . 
  her ratios stay the same , she does get an execute ability but she turns into a melee squishy assassin . 
  meanwhile jayce and nidalee are ok having a transformation that makes then insanely strong for dueling because ... reasons ? 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ really ^ ^ hate ^ ^ nid ^ ^ and ^ ^ jayce, 
  nowadays toplane just straight says fuck you and does the chickens for the early level 2 if they are playing sion or maokai, 
  until he starts dominating nalcs and eulcs you should all be safe , i ca n't play vik for shit but i love seeing people play him ^ well :d, 
  or like a smaller graves ult , she throws the single target spell , if it hits the webs spread out behind him and stuns the enemies behind him in a small aoe area :d, 
  oh so thats why i got a warning saying there was an error in league 's files and i needed to fix it . 
  never happened again after the client fixed the files . 
  no more `` enemy got away because my mark did n't proc after e '' < 3 rito, 
  there 's the possibility of the screen moving be the reason for the crash in some pc 's , you could always have the option to make it static like the login screen maybe . 
  being chased into the jungle is hilarious , makes me wan na [ play this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnbl5omeuno ) while doing it . 
  i actually started waking at reasonable hours ( starts at 8/9 a.m here ) just to watch ogn ... ogn made me have a sleep schedule , something 3 years in uni could n't . 
  `` reusing tunnels '' it means going through an already created tunnel , it 's not the e cooldown , tops you can tunnel go back to safety sooner if you tunnel into a bad situation , you ca n't just dash around like vi or lee, 
  passive does damage over time ( dots ) , it means those values happen during 3 seconds , the active lets you do it 's damage according to your attack speed . 
  i got a little mad when the casters did n't mention how he used twisted advance in game 1 during the 3 man towerdive bot to avoid the graves ultimate , and eventually survive the dive . 
  it was a pretty neat play . 
   this is big news, 
  many people related to the subreddit were shadowbanned before , mostly content creators only posting/commenting their stuff , and it was n't big news , besides only reddit administrators can shadowban someone so that topic has nothing to do with / r/leagueoflegends mods , this is reaching new levels of paranoia , you can go to / r/conspiracy for that . 
  mods create sub - mods control sub - mods ca n't do whatever they want to it . 
  unsubscribe and create your own sub if you want , it 's the magic of reddit . 
  between this and the freaking recoloured skins debacle the loud minority of this sub sound like self-righteous pricks -_-, 
  after all the backlash they got from the re-texture is nice to see they went back to it . 
  ogn is still a company , there 's no way they just gave up the stream revenue if they were n't getting equal or superior monetary value or something else in the trade . 
  honestly the entire korean league scene looks extremely iffy when it comes to decision making since they just let chinese organizations buy out all their top talent . 
  * ps : i 'm not saying ogn = kespa teams ( samsung , kt , skt ), 
  so ... shaco ? 
  easyhoon is probably their choice , he has shown more consistency than t0m , who seems not that comfortable in high stakes games like today , and also gives less pressure to faker , less burnout of your star player is always good . 
  sidenote : they still need to beat ge tigers lol, 
  to be fair he was commenting on high pressure matches , since t0m had zero experience in them , as it showed vs cj where he got dumpstered and made tons of stupid mistakes ... today was a completely different t0m able to adapt to a different strategy really fast . 
  but in the meanwhile tsm loses jungle pressure and their top and bot get dumpstered by the korean solo top and duo lane , wt/lustboy are outclassed by bang/wolf and marin is like a better version of dyrus . 
  true , forgiven already does it on twitter , why not give them a video segment , they are mostly harmless and create fun rivalries . 
  honestly after trying to branch out and give other mobas a try , like smite , heroes and dota , there 's some features that are truly superior that i think should be implement on riot 's client , but overall riot 's is way more sleek and easily accessible to new players . 
  smite 's a clusterfuck of stuff , dota has more detail but it 's a bit confusing for new players like my example , heroes has the best shop design in my opinion . 
  that means some situational counterplay for the person she ults and situational benefits if akali uses it smartly . 
  it 's an overall good change in my opinion, 
  i can agree with that , i just really dislike that the chat and friends list is half of my screen in the client it 's a waste of space from a design standpoint in my opinion :\\ i would remove it if i could ... can i do it ? 
  we also need to stop feeding the bird , he keeps stopping mid flight by touching a minion with the tip of his fat wing during q :\\, 
  gnar is still pretty strong and can deal in lane with maokai , just not that great in soloq if your team does n't know how to work around your rage bar . 
  was ... was that a reference to [ cowboy bebop 's intro ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqvsus-iqvg ) ? 
  * inspired by jonny quest , cowboy bebop , and venture brothers . 
  * awesome :d, 
  the only thing that truly annoyed me about both those champs is their `` free '' damage , they can easily outtrade you without any damage items , yasuo with some crit and kali with just attack speed , while you buy damage items and they still shit on you . 
  fuck top heimerdingers -_- after getting raped every single time i face one i still do n't know what champion to use or how to lane vs him . 
  there 's a chrome extension : [ red tracker ] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rleagueoflegends-red-trac/nbpfkceoeabndcecpjldleagknhklfdh ) , it shows in red the threads with rioters comments . 
  it does show as second on [ redditlist in recent activity ] ( http://redditlist.com/ ), 
  :| still trying to understand why ... 
  it 's not that bad , it was fun , the companion got a boring boyfriend , cool mysterious woman which ended up being ... fuck this shit * starts rewatching tennant 's seasons *, 
  to think that bigby has dealt with some fucked up shit and reddit conspiracies would still look ridiculous to him . 
  bugged to the point of not interacting with banshee 's veil shield , which we saw more than a couple of times happening . 
  he might do it ... but not well , or at least not well enough . 
  you ca n't really have a hyper carry midlaner trying to focus on his lane and at the same time trying to shotcall the other positions . 
  only worked for hai because he was n't the only `` carry '' on the team . 
  honestly his e is not the big issue , it 's a nuke ability . 
  i think they should tweak his q shield/damage . 
  early game it 's a 1 point wonder that lets you poke the enemy and auto win the trade because of the shield , and it helps a ton vs burst oriented champs ^ ^ fuckzed, 
  played a ranked the other day : ashe ( me ) , leona , lux , elise , shen , most fights the entire enemy team was cc ` ed to death, 
  the problem is that most of this `` gurlz streamers '' do play the game , you ca n't report for the moments when they are not playing , even most big streamers pause for a while to do q&a s. 
  i just report for `` self-harm '' since most the attention they get are from people calling them names , and some even pretend to be crying or having a mental breakdown ( which is fucked up ) , s&m streams can be watched in other websites in my opinion ... 
  if you go by the western standard of teleport use , yes its a defensive spell , good asian top laners on the other hand can use their teleports aggressively correctly to initiate and make plays . 
  see : dyrus teleport in g4 vs tl and less ... all the other teleports made in na/eu lcs this split , which are just embarrassing most times . 
  hi froskurinn , honestly your insight on the chinese scene was one of the primary things that made me curious about it , so thanks for that !, 
  question : when you started working in the official riot stream of lpl you talked about how they helped you in the beginning , can you tell us in what way they helped you improve your casting ? 
  also the production value of the lpl stream is increasing incredibly lately making it much more enjoyable to watch for the casual viewer , can you tell us if the team has anything else planned in the future that can will increase even more the production value to the level expect from the lcs streams ? 
  he did n't ask who has the best hair in the lpl cast team , frosk still wins that ^ ^ you ^ ^ come ^ ^ close ^ ^ second, 
  o_o what did you play for more than 3000 hours ?!, 
   towerdiving,
