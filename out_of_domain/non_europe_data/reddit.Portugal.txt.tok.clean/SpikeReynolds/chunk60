  season 1 of dd was amazing because it had multiple tiers of villains , you had the small henchment from different `` flavors '' ( russians , the ninjas , the yakuza etc ) , you had all the `` mini-bosses '' which had their own mini-story arcs , but the most important part you had fisk which was the best villain in any marvel cinematic story . 
  what i mean is , even if you removed all the main storyline , and character development of dd and friends , the show was a really really engaging action flick because it kept changing contexts and making it interesting . 
  that maybe people should n't have issues with seeking help if they are feeling suicidal , that having depression and suicidal thoughts it 's a cyclical thing and it 's something that can easily creep out of nowhere . 
  bojack has always been in denial of his issues , just because people relate to him does n't mean they are him , they can make different choices . 
  it 's not riot 's ad , it her channel 's ad . 
  youtubers can market their own videos to show up as ad before other videos , i once had a 30 minute long vlog of some russian dude , it was just him walking around his town , i went to his channel and he had less than 1k subs . 
  honestly i wanted to love that game so much , it was finally fire emblem on pc , but the story was mediocre , the combat like you pointed out was unintuitive , only the visuals were somewhat interesting but 50 % of the time was just the caravan going in a straight line . 
  and i absolutely hated that you changed groups , that shit completely removed any sense of progression you had with the game and actually made me stop playing it for a couple of days . 
  it was also incredibly short , i still have n't forced myself to play bs2 exactly because of how burned i felt playing the first one . 
  the in-game logic of it would be `` well it 's a war zone people would be running around with all these bandits killing people '' , but this was every single open world zone , even cities felt incredibly small and empty at the same time , it make no sense that val royeaux , the capital city of a huge merchant country was not only stupid small , but had maybe what 20 npcs ? 
  it felt like a ghost town . 
  meh , that 's a pretty shitty list , most of the games came out in the last couple of years , this is at the same level of a list of the 100 best movies to watch with transformers in the top 20 . 
  look at msi 2016 schedule , it might be similar . 
  no , that summoner trading is garbage or extremely situational , exactly because of the trade off of having to `` charge '' it by using summoner 's 3 times before being able to change them . 
  also , aside from midlane there 's zero diversity of summoner 's and this ai n't gon na change shit , flash is a must for 99 % of the champions :, 
  - top will always need teleport during the early and late game , `` oh but then you can take ignite and roll on some mofos !, 
  '' ... no no you ca n't since nobody with 2 brain cells would not use teleport to back and get health back if they are below 40 % instead of trying to trade with someone with ignite . 
  - junglers will always need smite because it 's connected to their jungle items and it 's upgrades ( early game ) and it 's obviously needed to secure objectives . 
  - adcs will always take the summoner 's that make them as safe as possible , which is 80 % of times heal , or barrier if the supp takes heal . 
  ( also better damage alternatives ), 
  at most you will see midlaners maybe using it to change between safe lanning summoner 's like heal and barrier for teleport late game for map rotations , but like you said then they would be missing better keystones that increase damage . 
  and maybe you will see supports with cheese strats like smite early game for an extra xp boost , but again , there 's better more efficient keystones for them as well , like the free hp for every minion that dies near you . 
  my tl ; dr of the new runes : 50 % of them are reskins of previous keystones and they function pretty much the same so if they are used or not are based on their numbers ( and if they are too high riot will just nerf them again ) ; the other 50 % are extremely situational or useless . 
  i do like the slow one , but that shit will get nerfed to the ground after a couple of patches . 
  wait this is bullshit , how can jack even consider this ? 
  orgs growth is intrinsically connected to their brand , people support cloud 9 players partly because of being cloud 9 , especially if the are watching scenes they are n't familiarized with . 
  a league of legends c9 fan will more easily support their cs go squad instead of virtuous.pro simply because they recognize the brand name . 
  lol this is exactly the opposite of what the immortals kid wanted xd nobody will give a shit about his immortals brand if he has to change it 's name to something else , `` i want people to be immortals fans , not only fans of our players '' , get cucked boy . 
  edit : [ blizzard employee pretty much confirms this is exclusively beneficial for blizzard and not for the teams ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/competitiveoverwatch/comments/6vzqjx/overwatch_league_teams_required_to_create_new/dm4au64/ ), 
  this literally only benefits blizzard and the overwatch league , it 's actually fucking stupid for the orgs , specially the endemic ones like c9 and immortals that wasted thousands in creating and growing their name brand , this means that any success these brand get in the overwatch league will be much harder to translate into the rest of the org . 
  by this i mean , if cloud 9 sees huge success with their league squad , their league fans will probably also support their dota and cs go squads and vice-versa . 
   when i was running yorick jungle, 
  damn you must really hate yourself . 
  jokes aside , if you want to be aggressive early you go back to the point of any of the damage runes being better , since they can be used without many constraints and scale better ( since they have ad/ap ratios ) , also red smite right now is almost a mini-ignite , that not only deals true damage but also reduces damage from the enemy , which makes it situationally better in skirmishes . 
  tl ; dr : ignite is almost always inferior to a damage rune + red smite . 
  sidenote : but if you really really want to run smite/ignite , try eve , she 's pretty good with it , well , at least until riot deletes her from the game with her rework, 
  the most depressing part is that pubg is reaching both casual viewerships and esports viewerships that overwatch can only dream of right now , it 's ridiculous . 
  i consider gbay99 a mini-mattpat from game theory , guys that want to be `` youtubers '' instead of making good content, 
  honestly it looks like it 's getting smaller and smaller every year , i really thing ogn is losing interest in producing lck , just look at the [ 2014 stage ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msvpffiose8 ) . 
  either league is really dying in korea that they ca n't fill more seats or ogn is really giving the middle finger to kespa and riot . 
  [ yet ow 's apex was in the open ] ( https://clips.twitch.tv/acceptablereliablemetalcoolstorybro ) , it 's hard to see if they had more seats or not , but it seems like ogn has no issues with making another open venue final , not in their studio . 
  the 15 % cdr on ss was something that you could already get in the current resolve tree ( which you almost never go into unless you are a tank or supp ) . 
  that 's my biggest issue with the new rune system , yet again riot is locking options behind attack/defensive/utility trees instead of letting people mix stuff up for actual interesting playstyles . 
  i thought gambit was a given , or is another team actually able to beat them ? 
  thanks for the explanation !, 
  btw , out of curiosity , how 's the cis scene currently , it seems that there was some more investment especially with gambit coming back and vp as well , and that weird m19 investment after they rebranded , but cis still feels very much like dota/cs territory , is the lcl viewership growing ? 
  yeah , i guess if the playerbase does n't grow neither will the viewership . 
  also cis viewership consistently overshadows eng streams in dota specially if a cis team is playing . 
  do you think if riot opened the eu lcs to cis squads again it would help grow the community there ? 
  i 'm guessing that most of the earlier cis league fans started watching thanks to gambit and their international and lcs success . 
   the conversion rate is pretty poor for most esportstitles , and i think it will be even worse for overwatch as the playernumber of 30 million is inflated by it being a blizzard game ( in the same way that almost every blizzard title is ) , and their core playerbase simply cares more about having fun and the world than stuff around it . 
  i 'll keep annoying people with this until they stop using it , it 's 30 million accounts created , which is in no way , shape , or form the same as active players nor games purchased , it 's inflated not only by being a blizzard game but also by being available for `` free '' in pc bangs in asian countries and people were able to create multiple accounts there . 
  that number might even include people that played during free weekends , since they still receive emails from blizzard about overwatch every time an event happens , the last `` big jump '' in that number , happened after the game went f2p during 1 month in china . 
  going back to the pc bangs context , in korea in january ow had 30 % -32 % market share , now it dropped to 15 % -18 % on average . 
  tl ; dr : the 30 million is a bullshit number that blizzard uses for marketing purposes and should n't be use in the context of possible esport viewership ( even though they are using it for that ) . 
  no , [ they bought all the remaining shares of riot a couple of years ago ] ( https://www.polygon.com/2015/12/16/10326320/riot-games-now-owned-entirely-by-tencent ) , tencent owns 100 % of riot , they can do whatever they want with riot 's art assets . 
  case in point , tencent 's honor of kings also uses a bunch of league of legends assets , in the end , it all belongs to tencent . 
  ignoring the fact that this [ was already posted ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/dotamasterrace/comments/6vd70x/ornn_champion_spotlight/ ) , [ twice ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/dotamasterrace/comments/6u5b7r/ornn_is_league_of_legends_most_dota_2_champion_to/ ) . 
  i do n't really agree with your statement, 
   [ passive ] living forge - allows to buy stuff outside the store . 
  allies can upgrade certain items . 
  well , like you said , this is pretty unique , even though the upgrades are kinda shitty at least they are gold efficient and give a small advantage late game when everybody is full build . 
   [ q ] volcanic rupture - long skillshot , damage + slow , creates bulder, 
  pretty much the most standard and boring ability , ** yet it synergizes with his e ** , so at least it has a purpose . 
   [ w ] bellows breath : % damage , immune to cc , gives shield , applies brittle, 
  well , this is just a mess to be honest , it 's one of those `` lets throw as many shit into a single ability as possible . '', 
  ** but it does proc a new and unique form of cc , brittle ** , which increases cc duration on targets . 
   [ e ] searing charge : dash that knocks up if he collides with terrain, 
  standard dash that every bruiser/tank needs nowadays , but the fact that it 's a knockup when it collides with terrain , including his bulder and walls made by allies/enemies , can allow for some neat tricks in specific comps , pretty much an improved version of the poppy/anivia combo . 
  ** also , it 's the only ability so far that can destroy player terrain ** , this means that if a taliyah cuts your team off with her wall , ornn can open an entry . 
   [ ult ] call of the forge god : aoe long range slow that applies brittle + possible knockup, 
  while a pretty standard aoe slow , at least the way the second part knockup happens is unique since you can redirect it , it 's not like braum 's ult where you just press the ability . 
  and it applies brittle , the unique debuff to him . 
  ornn has some pretty meh parts of his kit , personally i think the passive is lackluster , since he has no self-sustain , so going back to base is a must if you need to regen health and mana . 
  but at least it has some unique stuff , same ca n't be said for other new champions , which just have upgraded and improved versions of other champions , stuff like how rakan 's grand entrance is an skillshot form of alistar 's combo on a single ability , or how xayah 's pretty much plays as a better form of sivir , with more consistent and cheaper wave clear and it 's safer thanks to her ult . 
  i hate rakan for several reasons , mostly because he 's a fucking sleazy rat that can escape everything with his 3 dashes and stupid movement speed with ult . 
  but what i meant by comparing him to alistar was mostly just the grand entrance , which is basically just an alistar 's headbutt + pulverize with a small delay . 
  god , i 'm having deja vu 's to last year when overwatch was released and everybody was freaking out that it had more users in pc bangs than league . 
  could you all just relax ? 
  yes riot , keep removing mechanics from champions , that 's the true meaning of balance , it also makes the game so much more interesting to play when you have less and less options on how to play a champion . 
  the difficulty of something has nothing to do with being a mechanic in the game or not , redirecting abilities with flash is a mechanic in a ton of champions , some work easily the same way like how people are pointing out to shen 's taunt + flash , and even more recently camille 's hookshot + flash . 
  if the issue is the lack of counterplay they already made his ult have a minimum animation timing so people can flash after gragas 's slam + flash , there 's stuff like lee 's ult + flash that locks people in the animation and does n't allow any counterplay but people do n't seem to be bitching about it . 
  yes , they renamed it from human ryze to young ryze in his last rework, 
  like many people said before , it 's going to be interesting to see if pubg will start a new wave of big studios doing battle royale games , similar to what happened to class-based shooters , and mobas before that . 
  the battle royale genre feels like something that ubisoft and ea would love to jump on . 
  ubisoft 's thing is literally big open maps and tactical/survival shooters , and ea could easily put their battlefield studios doing a spin-off br title for them . 
  but on topic : the fps community feels like the most `` migratory '' of any other genre , i wonder how many will ditch the game once the next big popular mp fps comes out ... like destiny 2, 
  there 's a big difference between mobas and shooters , dota and league to a smaller extent have a huge burden of knowledge , you have a ton of stuff you need to learn before you properly play the game , even more when you start thinking about individual matchups . 
  there 's obviously differences between all shooters , but the extra information you need to learn between titles is much smaller than going from league/dota to another moba , well except hots which simplified even more the genre , which is why it had it 's mild success . 
  yes , it 's soooo much better watching teams group near baron and tickle eachothers frontline until they are 40 % health and then backoff to regen and go back to throwing a bunch of abilities until one of the carries gets caught out of position . 
  that 's something that i never understood in league of legends , how inconceivable it is to some people to roam as a support even if just to ward the enemy jungle , i put partly blame on riot for always associating support to the botlane instead of the dedicated support person for the team , but also the community that starts bitching the second a support leaves the duo lane . 
  that and how dumb some people are by staying in a lost lane , bro if you are a support and you already lost 3 duels and fed the enemy draven 5 kills , fucking leave the lane , specially if you have some sort of cc . 
  camp top and mid , or just follow your jungler ( you ca n't even `` steal '' exp from him now ) , that will 9/10 times tilt beyond believe the enemy solo laners . 
   you can stick any type of champ in every role , yet ranged marksmen are always as adc ( except for some ziggs games ) yet they still manage to cry . 
  this is not true and it 's exactly why i always laugh when people stay that people that play adc have the hardest role or need the best individual mechanics . 
  it 's the only role that literally has a babysitter for the entire early game . 
  and , this is the most important part , almost all other roles have/can play ranged carries , jungle has graves/quinn/kindred , top has quinn/lucian/jayce ( to some extent ) , midlaners are all picking up currently lucian , there 's also varus/corki/kog ` maw . 
  every other role in pro-play has to adapt to completely different styles of champions , yet carry bots exclusively play ranged ad carries , fuck off with your `` hardest role '' . 
  i just misread the sentence sorry . 
  but yeah , pretty much adcs are the most standardized role .
