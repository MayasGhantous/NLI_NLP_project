  dota was already it 's own thing and was n't influenced by league . 
  it 's fluff , he gets an extra soul at the start when playing against lucian , it 's a lore reference since thresh stole the soul of lucian 's wife . 
  also , he only gains 0.75 armor ( not magic resistance ) , which is pretty insignificant in league 's context . 
  i do n't agree that league 's system is predatory , at max it 's annoying and a huge entry wall to new players . 
  i think the biggest issue with the league 's system is how it conditions the design of the game , which is something games with micro transactions suffer from at different levels . 
  in league you will never see hard counters simply because people might not owned the counter for some champion . 
  this resulted in most metas being comprised of the same 15-20 s-tier picks and a slightly bigger pool of a tier picks being picked for 80 % of the matches ( mostly in pro play ) . 
  you also have a very narrow player mentality that evolved around having a small pool of champions or having a main/being a one-trick pony , since most counters in league are just soft-counters , experienced players tend to be able to deal with their champions counter pretty easily , people do n't play for specific comps or a specific strategy , they play the 1 or 2 champions they know and do n't care about their team .

   in lol you have to pay or grind for heros not to mention the skins that cost $ 25 sometimes, 
  well ... i guess 4 times could be considered `` sometimes '' since only ultimate skins cost that , and they only make 1 every 1.5 years and they have a bunch of special shit in it . 
  more money for all teams participating ? 
  did nobody read how the small percent of the prize pool from last year really helped the wildcard teams ? 
  albus nox luna went home with 270k which was probably fucking amazing for them . 
  why would n't you want every team at worlds to get more money if possible ? 
  it 's not only about the top 4 . 
  worlds skins % from sales goes directly to the players that won those skins ... so that would really only help skt get more money . 
  previous championship skins increasing the prizepool could be an option . 
  ... but league has loot boxes . 
  the issue with overwatch is that you have to deal with random chance . 
  in league you can either pay 25 $ for one of those skins or if you want , you can buy a bunch of boxes and maybe you get lucky and get one of those skins . 
  [ literally 1 week ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/games/comments/6zran8/blizzard_creates_10_pet_in_wow_to_support/ ), 
  it 's pretty much riot yet again doing the minimum possible , `` people bitched about increasing prizepool , fine fuck it championship zed increases the prizepool '' , then they saw they lost 5 million thanks to that so , no only did they increase the skin cost from 950rp to 1350rp this year ( higher profit margin ) they are also selling stuff for the missions without increasing the prizepool, 
  that 's already over , if championship ashe does n't sell as much or more than zed last year they are already not meeting the prize pool goal , it 's their own fault for not wanting to make the prizepool compendium interesting , they have no issue finding new ways to get money from their players regularly , but with the prize pool they have an issue with changing shit up once a year ? 
  pretty much that , the community in league do n't give a shit , and if you try to even argue they just dismiss it because `` league does n't have to throw it 's cock around like dota '' and like you said `` yes more money for the koreans '' , ignoring that for many small region teams the small payments they got from worlds really helped them . 
   the prize pool in league is large as it is , especially with the skin money that comes from the winner 's skins . 
  probably would n't reach dota levels , but it 's more than enough . 
  yes that 's great ... for the winner . 
  but higher prizepool also means higher payment for all other teams , i 'm pretty sure albus nox luna were way happier for getting 270k than the 70k the 8th best team got the previous year, 
  well , it 's really impossible to evaluate that because not only did riot sporadically told us how much the prizepool increased but it was happening during the event itself , we only knew the final prizepool after skt won , which is ridiculous . 
  we ca n't know if the prizepool increasing made anl or any other team play better or not because they did n't know for how much they were playing . 
  it 's essentially the same patch as playoffs and finals , which were honestly boring because you kept seeing the same picks , op is delusional . 
  i think the worst example is blademistress morgana , [ amazing art ] ( https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/5/51/morgana_blademistressskin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170616003426 ) but it 's her [ shitiest skin ] ( https://lolskinshop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/blade-mistress-morgana-morgana-skins-morgana-lol1.png ), 
  til people hate rick and morty because of it 's fanbase and because they think it 's the cartoon version of the big bang theory with all it 's science geek chic ? 
  wtf , all the sciency aspects of r&m are pretty much magic , they never bother to explain anything because it does n't matter , it 's a comedy-drama in a science fiction setting , it 's a character study of rick and it leans much more on philosophy than science , i do n't think people complaining actually bothered watching the show , it 's like saying bojack horseman is a hollywood comedy but with talking animals, 
  6 months ... holy shit , blizzard is full on retarded . 
  for context : one of the biggest complaints about the lcs structure and what many presume is the reason for the declining viewership ( or at least partly ) is because most games in the regular season are meaningless , teams play so many matches that individually it 's really hard for a viewer to care about them ... and that 's with 3 months splits . 
  now imagine 6 months of meaningless matches , got that shit is terrible . 
  sidenote : is contenders going to work along side the owl ? 
  if not , what are the non-owl teams supposed to do for half the year ? 
  wait for papa blizzard to allow them to play ? 
  honestly this is incredibly stupid , it 's really hard to care about the games being played when they do n't really matter much , playoffs and tournament structures are engaging because every single match is important , it 's a team being able to continue and the other dropping out . 
  there 's a place for a league structure , the lcs works by creating a reliable schedule for fans to watch their favorite teams , but even the lcs with 3 months long splits ca n't create hype for most of their big matches half-way through the split because the only thing that happens is a team getting a few for points or not , that 's not interesting as a viewer . 
  `` but i only care about watching the best esportz in the worldz '' oh stfu , esports just like traditional sports are entertainment , and the entertainment does n't come exclusively from the play itself , it comes from the hype surrounding the teams , the narratives of individual players , and of course possible drama happening in the scene , it all works together . 
  but the argument riot gave at the time was n't that it was a broken item , it was because according to riot only 1 % of people that bought dfg actually used it 's active , if that was the case , why even bother deleting an item that people barely use the broken part of it ? 
  also dfg and luden 's while doing a similar job ( i.e. 
  increase damage output ) are two very different items exactly because of one being an active and the other a passive . 
  with dfg you had control of on whom and when you wanted to use the damage output increase , luden 's passive gets proc ` ed on the first target you hit , which means if you throw your aoe skillshot to an adc but it touches ever so slightly the tank first , the tank is the one that gets the burst while with dfg you could select the target of the burst , you also need to recharge it every time you use an ability which creates those `` moments of counterplay '' that riot loves but it also takes a lot of control out of the player . 
  thank god all big esports are sustained exclusively by american viewers last time i checked ^ ^ / s, 
  it was a bullshit playstyle , but at least allowed champions to be played in different styles , over time riot pretty much made most champions have to follow a single build or single playstyle to work reliably . 
  i love ekko , but right know you really ca n't build anything else but lich/protobelt , they gutted the tank-ekko and full ap does n't work as well because of shit ratios ( except on ult ) , it gets incredibly boring if you have to keep building the same shit because riot ca n't bother to properly balance champions to allow different playstyles . 
  and yes i remember how bullshit dfg was , my only ranked penta was with veigar thanks to dfg ( pre-rework veigar was pretty bullshit as well , i loved him < / 3 ), 
  if you have no research background but are serious about looking these stuff out i have 2 tips for you ( illegal though , but it 's actually easier and faster than going through legal ways ), 
  step 1 [ ( google scholar ) ] ( https://scholar.google.com/ ) : honestly i have used many scientific papers search engines and google scholar is still the best one in my opinion for an initial stage of research , just search the keywords you are looking for ( example : thc + gaming or thc + sports , etc ) , most will probably not be available but you can almost always read the abstract and see if you want to read the full article . 
  if you do want the full article , look for the doi number , and grab it, 
  step 2 ... the illegal step ... go to sci-hub and type the doi number , the website will give you automatically the article you are looking for in pdf . 
  is that you telling us in a very non-subtle way you are suicidal ? 
   germany masterrace heil, 
  hmmmm ... please do n't . 
  the issue is bo3 + the lcs structure . 
  there 's nothing wrong with bo3 it 's the best competitive structure for a tournament , but with a league like lcs , it creates a ridiculous amount of games being played during a regular lcs split , individual games are meaningless and have no hype because they barely matter . 
  people just get burned out of so many games being played weekly , i already said this before , but between the 4 major regions ( eu lcs , na lcs , lck and lpl ) there 's between 50-60 individual matches per week , plus all the smaller regions and regional leagues , that 's just fucking ridiculous . 
  you are better off waiting for the next week and see what games were worth watching . 
  it 's gambit , an incredibly loved old org , with 2 of their old star players + 2 players from the russian squad that got to quarters last year . 
  gambit was probably the most hyped wildstar team and they got demolished today :\\, 
  in my opinion league is has it 's worst meta in years , and this is the world patch . 
  ** top lane : ** do you hate playing tanks ? 
  do you hate having no impact in the game unless you tp every 3 minutes ? 
  well , fuck you then . 
  ** jungle : ** remember when this was supposed to be most `` intelligent '' of all roles , well fuck you , gank 24/7 , farming does n't matter , counterjungling has no impact , just help feed your botlane otherwise you lose . 
  ** mid : ** boy you better fucking love playing syndra and ori , you might even be able to play taliyah or corki as well , but do n't even try to be the most diverse role it used to be . 
  ** botlane : ** remember when juggermaw was a niche comp that only the best teams could do it efficiently ? 
  yeah fuck that shit , now it 's meta and any adc can fit in a juggermaw comp as long as they have an ardent censer supp , lets give people double their health in shields , that sounds fun . 
  sure the mordekaiser/darius worlds patch broke the game , but at least that shit was entertaining to watch , this is just plain boring . 
  as far as i know the only other experience rubberband i know in the game is that if you participate in a kill of an enemy higher level than you , you gain extra experience . 
  i 've seen a ton of times people 4 or 5 levels above the person with the lowest level in the game , even in pro-play . 
  they do n't , at least not since patch v3 .14 `` lane minions are no longer worth more experience based on game time . '', 
  according to the wiki . 
  [ the only rubberband experience mechanics in the game according to the wiki ] ( http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/experience_ ( champion ) #gaining _ experience ) is when you kill or get and assist for killing an higher level enemy and from jungle camps higher level than you, 
  i thought r/movies was a pretty neutral place , going by the graveyard of downvoted comments it seems i was wrong ... i 'm actually disappointed . 
  context is important , it 's a dead time zone for the west , how many streamers are going to stream between 7-9 am in europe or between 1-3 am in na ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
  my initial context was just anecdotal , my issue is with how riot decided to balance their game . 
  issues viewed by riot :, 
  ( we do n't like ) - laners taking early jungle camps to get exp leads, 
  ( we do n't like ) - laners buying jungle items that we balance exclusively for the jungle, 
  solution : make it impossible for laners to access the jungle exp and items by locking them behind items that are exclusive to smite users, 
  this removes many alternative strategies in resource allocation ; summoner spells taken by junglers ; item diversity . 
  simply because riot is unable to balance the jungle and jungle items without breaking the game . 
   did n't they harass and threaten palmer luckey 's girlfriend off of twitter ? 
  or was that neogaf ? 
  no idea who he is :| i stopped visiting the website a little bit after the bastion videos . 
  also , [ these are the videos i was talking about ] ( https://www.giantbomb.com/videos/building-the-bastion-part-02/2300-3563/ ) , and they were around 2010-2011, 
  i know , but that 's the only experience i remembered at the moment where the developers were pretty open about all the details of their game while developing . 
  i know it 's a common practice in outsourced games specially in greenlight since people have access to pre-alpha patches , but i do n't follow that scene . 
  was n't really my objective though , i have some nice experiences with developers discussing their games in the open and i love gdc talks even though i do n't work nor probably will ever work in the gaming industry .
