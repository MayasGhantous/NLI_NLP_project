  even if i do n't agree with certain decisions personally it 's always interesting to see the thought process behind them . 
  like i said to another commentator , the example was exclusively to when they developed bastion , i did n't really followed them much after that , besides around the time transistor was about to release . 
  i forgot to pick smite because i was slightly drunk , sue me -_- the jungle from 4 + years ago has nothing to do with the jungle currently , my point is that machete and talisman are locked into smite simply because riot wants to avoid another ezreal mid with jungle item example . 
  they did it with the fantastic four though . 
   some say he only got the spot as a caster because he has been with riot forever . 
  it 's less about the amount of time he has been there but more about last year 's allegations of riot esports being a `` boy 's club '' , that if you want something you need to kiss some boots . 
  in phreaks case , is the fact that he was a subpar caster relegated to casting the challenger matches until riotredbeard left as director and riotmagus became chief director of na lcs , after that , suddenly phreak became more and more prevalent in the broadcasts , including casting some finals when there was more talent casters to do it . 
  personally , i hate that he tries to be the play-by-play caster ( i.e. 
  his job ) and still keeps inserting is `` game knowledge '' which is the color caster 's job , he totally monopolizes the casts he works in , it 's specially egregious in big matches where you already have 2 color casters , in those cases the pbp caster should only try to direct the conversation not be an active part of it ( imo ) . 
  i seriously doubt people watch these shows for the drama , they could put white noise over it and people would still watch it because seeing somewhat competent people cooking is fun . 
  holy shit an actual adaptable webpage , this is probably the biggest tech advancement in league 's history !, 
  on topic :, 
  overall the keystones look undertuned or garbage , here comes my armchair analysis :, 
  ** precision **, 
  | * press the attack - * is a worse version of fervor , since you need to keep attacking 1 target , this will be good for single target focused champion like master yi or tryndamere , it 's shit for adcs, 
  | * lethal tempo - * this shit is gon na be broken on adcs with as steroids ( like tristana/kog ` maw ) , it will be nerfed as soon as possible, 
  | * fleet footwork - * literally warlords bloodlust, 
  ** domination **, 
  | * electrocute - * literally thunderlords, 
  | * predator - * lol this is garbage , who decided to give this shit 180 seconds cooldown , it barely does any damage . 
  | * dark harvest - * again , why bother with this situational damage when electrocute is more reliable and deals more damage ? 
  | * summon aerie - * a huge nerfed compared to windspeaker , and deals piteful damage to enemies , people will always use it to shield allies, 
  | * arcane comet - * yet again , why pick this when electrocute deals more damage , it 's instant and has higher ratios ? 
  and you can fucking sidestep this shit . 
  | * phase rush - * literally stormraider 's, 
  ** resolve **, 
  | * grasp of the undying - * literally . . hmm grasp of the undying . 
  | * guardian - * yup this will be the de facto keystone for most supports . 
  | * aftershock - * lol stoneplate is not op enough , lets make a keystone that multiplies resistances with it , that 's gon na be hilarious , ca n't wait to see 700 armor/mr tanks . 
  ** inspiration **, 
  | * glacial augment - * i for one will abuse the living shit out of this before riot nerfs it or reworks it, 
  | * summoner specialist - * i still say this is garbage , summoner 's are pretty locked on for most roles , and having one of the damaging keystones is better than changing between ignite and teleport at 10 minutes . 
  honestly the basic runes are the most interesting shit here , some situational ones will be great for specific champions , like last stand : `` deal up to 5 % more damage to champions while below 80 % health . 
  '' , this will be really good for stuff like tryndamere or olaf . 
  when combined with other damage amplying runes it might be pretty big , specially on trynd 's crits , it was a bad example though , there 's other runes that exemplify better what i meant , i already edited my post , the great and minor runes are a miles better than the keystones , and much more interesting than the old mastery tree effects , imo . 
  i still do n't like that they are locked behind trees , it does n't allow as much diversity as they could if you could pick and choose without having to lock yourself into a riot `` playstyle '', 
  [ removed ], 
  first off most summoner 's spells in the game right now are pretty straight forward ( like teleport , barrier , smite , ghost ) , while some have side effects attached to them which introduce * some * `` complexity '' in their use ( heal gives health + speed boost ; ignite does true damage + applies grievous wounds ; cleanse removes disables + 65 % cc-reduction ) , on the other hand exhaust feels overloaded in its current state , it reduces movement speed + attack speed by 30 % , reduces armor and magic resistance by 10 , and reduces the damage output by 40 % . 
  in it 's current state exhaust is a jack of all trades being able to be used both to reduce the attacking and defensive capabilities of a champion and making them useless and vulnerable for 2.5 seconds , this only hurts the current assassins rework since riot 's new philosophy for the role revolves around widening the `` period for kill '' and incentivizing counterplay . 
  ** a possible solution could be a two-part : ** make exhaust a control-centric summoner 's by reducing dramatically movement speed and attack speed of the target ( to 40 % ~ 50 % , everyone could be malphite now ) making it still viable for skirmishes in the botlane and vs auto-attacking based champions in other lanes/contexts ; and buff barrier into being the burst counter it should be by increasing it 's values or attaching armor and mr to the shield until it bursts ( similar to having orianna 's ball on you ) creating the possibility of counterplay in duels with a personal timely defense . 
  these issues have been discussed before , but with the assassin rework coming up and with no apparent change to the summoner 's spells this pre-season , i thought it would be important revisiting and discussing the role of the summoner 's spells in the game , the issue with diversity and the lack of options in general . 
  ^ ^ please ^ ^ create ^ ^ more, 
  with people complaining about missing the `` informative '' nightblue3 , i started looking for more macro knowledge based content creators . 
  right now the only one that i 'm already following is [ valkrin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/thevalkrin/featured ) which in my opinion is an improved version of old nb3 ( and it 's a shame valkrin has such a small viewership ) , he talks about his thought process all the time and the implications of macro play for each lane from a jungler 's point of view , his youtube videos also have tips and extra information he might have missed edited into it . 
  is there any more streamers/youtubers like old nb3 and now valkrin that do this type of macro play content instead of meme videos and top best most op champions for patch 6 . xx ? 
  popular league streamers imaqtpie and scarra talked in their podcast about dota 2 's patch 7.00 , called out on runes existing purely to make riot money while having zero diversity and masteries being a balance clusterfuck , including rito 's shitty philosophy about them . 
  they talk about it [ in the context of dota 's patch here ] ( https://youtu.be/ogxdzi_ibck?t=34m44s ) , but they also criticised the masteries [ in a previous segment . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/ogxdzi_ibck?t=2m51s ), 
  i thought this would be masterrace material :, 
  `` when thunder lords first came out , did n't have the tech to do it . 
  i believe we have the tech to do it soon . 
  the reason this occurs is that we have no way to determine spell origin . 
  for example , on the second tick of morgana w , thunder lords has no way of knowing if that instance of damage was from w , q , auto , r etc. 
  as such , it has no choice but to treat it as a separate instance of damage . 
  this would mean that once the tech is out , any instance of damage from a spell will only refresh the thunder lords stack and not add one ( morg w , mf e , etc. ) . 
  multiple cast spells will count as a separate cast for thunder lords , eg . 
  ahri r. effects that state `` your attacks/spells apply x '' will count as one spell including the auto attack ( eg . 
  recasts count as one ( eg . 
  i believe aurelion passive will count as one for the game duration . 
  for the varus example , i 'm not sure what 's going on there , probably mum 's linguine . 
  edit : oh right , varus w is of type proc , whereas lux passive is of type spell . '', 
  [ original thread ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/5lksf4/the_ways_you_can_proc_thunderlords_decree_will_be/ ), 
  today it was announced that montecristo and doa , 2 of league most well known and liked casters will leave league of legends casting , opting probably with focusing on ogn 's overwatch league apex , this also came after riot blacklisted monte from any international event ( which are 80 % riot events ) . 
  this came after the announcement last week that ogn , a broadcast team that has been doing it extremely well even before riot fucking existed , would no longer be able to broadcast half of the games for this year . 
  thanks to another organiser , spotv ( a mainstream sports channel in korea ) throwing a bunch of money to kespa and riot korea for broadcasting rights . 
  spotv is straight awful , even below esl sometimes with delays and technical difficulties of over an hour , and this happens every single week they broadcasted last year . 
  we can talk about how quickly blizzard can destroy their esports , but riot is like that serial killer that enjoys torturing and slowly and painfully kill their scene . 
  have fun ripping this apart boys , i specially like `` value 2 : '', 
   the core engine of league of legends is competition and mastery . 
  spending money does n't give either team an advantage going into or during the game . 
  this is sacred to us -- winning and climbing the ladder should be about getting better , not about spending more . 
   also , it should be practical to be the best player in the world without spending , not just `` theoretically possible . '' we 've all played games where spending is the only realistic way to stay competitive , even if you could eventually unlock everything you need . 
  this is n't what we want for league . 
  champions and runes are the obvious question here -- we believe they are n't pay-to-win because you can be effective with a basic , earnable set . 
  skill matters much more than your champion pool , and our bi-weekly patches are our commitment to keeping the game balanced . 
  runes have been a tougher challenge for us , as ghostcrawler mentioned in ask riot , and it 's why we reduced all tier 1 and 2 runes down to 1 ip as we think about how we can stay even closer to this value . 
  first off i swear this is not a troll post , i wan na know if there 's someone doing highly edited analysis videos of pro-matches or general game analysis , similar to what riot 's caster jatt does for them , examples : [ teamfight analysis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfp13zqb4sa&index=2&list=plpz7h6l6lc7vbrahtalboozojdeouov0l ) & [ game mechanic analysis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh8z7npigb8&index=1&list=plpz7h6l6lc7xmwf9bgumrfx2lzy6irtkd ), 
  so far i 'm subbed to purge , and his series with day9 is pretty good and he has a bunch of other general analysis videos , but he mostly makes 1 hour long videos of entire games . 
  is anyone doing more edited short-form videos ? 
  `` why not ask this on r/dota2 ? '', 
  ... cause strangely they are more antagonistic than dmr ...

  ~ ~ yet again a competitive match has a pause and will probably be remade because of a bug and riot has yet to implement some sort of save state or rewind tool to prevent this sort of shitfests ... but #competitiveintegrity i guess . ~ ~, 
  for the curious , [ the bug in question ] ( https://clips.twitch.tv/nalcs1/helplessseahorseraccattack ) , a minion ate the entire miss fortune ult damage, 
  edit : false alarm boys , riot actually did some shit correctly :\\, 
  this time was a diamond roaming support nunu with smite , the main differences from the singed case is that : nunu only bought support items , warded the most on his team , helped get most objectives for his team , and had a good success rate in high-elo . 
  and it 's another case where the brainwashed rito caster phreak condemned the player after getting him in ranked .

  i just found out this podcast called song exploder , each episode they invite a composer/musician to deconstruct one of their songs and talk about their process of making the music and give some very interesting context to them . 
  some of the guests include movie composers like :, 
  - [ nicholas britell - `` little 's theme '' + `` chiron 's theme '' + `` black 's theme '' from `` moonlight '' ] ( http://songexploder.net/moonlight ), 
  - [ justin hurwitz - `` audition ( the fools who dream ) '' from `` la la land '' ] ( http://songexploder.net/la-la-land ), 
  - [ harry gregson-williams - `` the martian '' score ] ( http://songexploder.net/the-martian ), 
  - [ brian tyler - `` avengers : age of ultron '' score ] ( http://songexploder.net/brian-tyler ), 
  - [ alexandre desplat - `` the imitation game '' ] ( http://songexploder.net/alexandre-desplat ), 
  there 's also the game of thrones and legend of korra composers but that 's not movie related ( i do recommend both though ) . 
  i thought some of you might enjoy this , cheers !,
