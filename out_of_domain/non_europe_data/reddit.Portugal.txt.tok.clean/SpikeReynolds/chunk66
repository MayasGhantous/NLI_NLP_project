  do you think teams are overestimating the value of being able to communicate both in english and korean while ignoring that his past success might be related to his synergy with huni in fnatic/immortals ? 
  by this i mean , the risk teams might suffer to take down a drake in comparison with the reward they get from the buff :, 
  - mountain drake ** [ reward ] ** grants additional damage as true damage to epic monsters and turrets . 
  ** [ risk ] ** mountain drake has more health , armor and magic resist than the other elemental dragon , resulting in taking longer to take down . 
  - cloud drake ** [ reward ] ** grants bonus movement speed while out of combat . 
  ** [ risk ] ** he has fastest movement and attack speed , therefore , deals the highest single target damage and it 's harder to kite . 
  - ocean drake ** [ reward ] ** restores health/mana while out of combat . 
  ** [ risk ] ** his auto attacks slow their target 's movement speed by 30 % for 2 seconds , making it harder to disengage . 
  meanwhile , infernal drake , gives the second or the first ( if the team has many carries that stack ad and ap ) highest reward , but the only risk with taking it is that his auto 's are aoe . 
  taking infernal drake is too easy for the exponentially higher reward than most other drakes . 
  possible solution : give infernal drake a % burn effect on his aoe similar to brand , it would increase his dps while still fitting his theme . 
  background : australian team was negligent to their players by breaching a bunch of stuff from their contracts to the point that the players had to get lawyers to actually get out of the org . 
  interesting bits :, 
  - one of the issues pointed by the players was that the rioter they were trying to get help from had previous connections to the team that was fucking them over and just kept ignoring the issues . 
  - [ today riot released their competitive ruling ] ( http://www.lolesports.com/en_us/articles/competitive-ruling-tainted-minds ) , not only is it just a slap on the wrist , $ 7,000 aud for extreme negligence , ( ffs c9 's hai got fine 500 $ for flipping his finger in a barely visible shot in lcs ), 
  - but the best part , [ they did an internal investigation for the conflict of interest and found themselves not guilty . 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/eidelweiss/status/852357722343432197/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw&ref_url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.reddit.com%2fr%2fleagueoflegends%2fcomments%2f652yom%2fcompetitive_ruling_tainted_minds%2f ), 
  this is by the jungler , the role whose exclusive job is to roam the map to apply pressure and get kills , this shows why watching european league of legends is so fucking boring and why their numbers continue to decline even though every time someone posts about it they come out with an excuse ( `` oh there was a football match today '' , `` oh it 's friday people are out and drinking '' ... these are real btw ) , but the peasants in the main sub not only ignore this , but also think this shows how high skill the game is because nobody dies ... ever ... 
  i was creeping the hots sub to see what 's coming out with their new update , and saw they had a bunch of new skins , including a diablo skin , based on [ prime evil diablo ] ( https://i.imgur.com/izwjxov.jpg ) ... 
  for comparison sake : [ prime evil model ] ( https://i.imgur.com/bsoi3bm.jpg ) vs [ normal diablo model ] ( https://i.imgur.com/gxw3ji9.jpg ), 
  so , [ an argument started in the main sub about how league is free to play unlike games like heartstone ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/67ukj1/how_the_fuck_lol_became_so_big/dgtcqmp/ ) which i argued they are pretty similar in their `` free-to-play '' systems but the sub still disagreed with me . 
  so if you wan na throw at someone 's face that league is not free-to-stay-competitive , use the following arguments . 
  ** only thing you can buy are champions , runes are n't affected ** - this is a lie , because you can buy rune pages with rp , which help you plan your strategy pre-champ select , since you ca n't change your rune sets during champ select . 
  - also , you can buy ip boosts , which is used to buy more runes , so you literally pay to unlock/grind game content faster , just like hs . 
  again the argument is n't if it 's pay to win , but pay to have competitive advantage . 
  ** you do n't need all champions , you can be a one-trick and climb ** - while this is partly true , there 's a clear competitive advantage to using money even if only situational :, 
  even if you play 1 champion - having multiple rune pages with different set ups for unique matchups gives you a clear advantage early game vs someone that only has 2 rune pages . 
  your champion can be banned/picked by the enemy , which can fuck you pretty hard since you have way less leeway to adapt if you have few champions/runes . 
  but there 's also the possibility of being auto-filled in champ select . 
  if you only have champions for the 2 roles you queue up for , you can easily get fucked , using my anecdotal examples :, 
  - on my second account while playing with my roommates i was autofilled into ad carry , i had no set up runes for the role ( i.e. 
  no attackspeed runes ) , and only had 3 adc ( the cheapest ones ) , one was banned , another was picked , and i was forced into a bad matchup because i did n't have more champions for that role . 
  same thing happened when i got autofilled into support forcing me to go `` off-meta '' support ( and get flamed lol ) and this is much more probable to happen , yet do n't forget that every role can get autofilled . 
  so masterrace , how do you think people would argue against my points ? 
  glixel , the rolling stone 's gaming news website , released this article titled [ `` as esports explodes , will valve 's ` dota 2 ' be left for dead ? 
  '' ] ( http://www.glixel.com/news/as-esports-explodes-will-valves-dota-2-be-left-for-dead-w479522 ) , the author basically gives an overview of dota 's esport scene and structure since the first ti over the years using c9 's experiences with building dota squads as examples for the changes . 
  and at the end it discusses the possible future for the scene when compared with the incoming wave vc money and franchising in other games like ow and league . 
  i think it 's pretty well written and interesting , does dmr have any opinions about the future of dota 's esport ecosystem ? 
  bonus points if you guys get tilted for every `` valve 's moba '' in the article :3, 
  [ source ] ( https://pvplive.net/c/league-of-legends-owners-co-found-new-chinese-espo ), 
   the fact , then , that perfectworld , tencent , and riot are co-founders of the new channel should pique more than a few industry interests . 
  as the lpl 's broadcast rights are retained to its publishers via the new media outlet , it means that tencent 's effectively cutting out the middleman in its pursuit of profitability for the world 's biggest esports scene . 
  : : important bit : :, 
   ** it also means they have the ability to profit off of everybody else 's esports titles , should their nominal competitors be willing to sell rights to the new channel . 
  at the very least , it now gives them a platform to do so . 
  do you guys think that perfect world has the publisher of dota 2 in china might pressure valve to make a deal to show dota 2 tournaments in this channel ? 
  yesterday they released on pbe a bunch of icons for being able to mute pings because `` toxic '' people use them to annoy others . 
  [ here 's a rioter talking about `` toxic pings '' ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6937q5/muting_pings_incoming_in_patch_710/dh3duu3/ ) ... lets reduce even more the communication in that game , no voice com , no chat , no pings !, 
  [ valve is releasing co-op missions in the new compendium for the next international ] ( http://www.dota2.com/international/battlepass/ ) , like a traditional action rpg ( i.e. 
  diablo ) , it 's kinda sad that riot with a much bigger team is always one step behind in creating interesting experiences for their players , specially since they have been pushing so much for the new lore and playing with friends in the last few years , creating story missions is a great way to introduce story outside of summoner 's rift ( and earn a bunch of money , like i expect valve will do ) . 
  what do you guys think ? 
  would you be willing to pay for story missions in the league of legends world ? 
  since this week is `` wtf is blizzard doing ?!?!, 
  '' - themed , [ here 's jacob wolf article ] ( http://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/19347153/sources-teams-hesitant-buy-overwatch-league ) , he 's pretty reliable when it comes to scoops lately . 
  if you do n't want to give espn revenue , here the important parts :, 
   activision blizzard is struggling to sign franchises to its yet-to-launch overwatch league because the asking price is too high , multiple sources close to existing franchises and investment partners told espn . 
   multiple sources said blizzard is asking for a $ 20 million franchise fee for the league featuring its popular 2016 title , with prices escalating from there in larger markets such as new york and los angeles . 
  however , following the $ 20 million buy-in , teams are not guaranteed revenue sharing until after 2021 and only if blizzard meets certain criteria that sources did not disclose to espn . 
  additionally , sources said if a team sells its spot to another party , the league would receive 25 percent of the proceeds . 
  this is actually insane . 
  for the second day in the row , i do n't know what 's more annoying the constant voices of the brazilian casters in the background , or actually being impossible to listen to the eng casters at times when the crowd goes berserk . 
  congratz on the brazilian crowd for being awesome , but this makes the viewing experience unbearable . 
  hi , i need some opinions , i started looking for a job 5 months ago for the first time in my life , i have zero work experience and an useless degree so i mostly respond to administration-type jobs , since i did work 4 years in my students union , so far i had almost zero responses and it 's incredibly demotivating . 
  since my experience is pretty barebones but i do have some experience with photoshop ( mostly doing posters for events ) i decided that at least my cv will look pretty even if there 's barely anything in it , so i jazz ` ed it up a bit and make it look `` professional '' instead of the standard white background-type , but now i 'm afraid this is not helping me at all . 
  do you guys think i just do a standard looking cv , even if it demonstrates how little work experience i have ? 
  [ here 's a very blurred version of it ] ( http://imgur.com/a/zy6vo ) , page 1 - cover letter ; page 2 - education/experience ; page 3 - skills and interests, 
  with riot implementing a earlier surrender vote this patch , surrender@15 ^ ^ inc. 
  , which needs a unanimous vote , i still think riot is not resolving some key issues that result in the need for this surrender , and i think analyzing what league 's neighbor does might be interesting for this occasion . 
  league 's surrender vs dota 's abandonment :, 
  first off , dota 2 does n't have a surrender tool , they do have something similar to remake , in cases a player never connects or leaves the match voluntarily before the first 5 minutes . 
  the most interesting part , is how dota 2 deals with abandonments after those 5 minutes, 
   ** ( 1 ) once a player has abandoned , other players are free to leave the game without danger of being placed in low priority or receiving an abandon count in their stats . 
   ** ( 2 ) the abandoned player 's gold is divided amongst the remaining players on his/her team , as well as the passive 1.5 gold per second gain . 
  players can sell the items from the dc ` ed player and gold is redistributed . 
  about point ( 1 ) , it can be argued that if you go into a match you agreed to be there until the very end , but most people would say that a player agrees to a balanced 5v5 match and not play until the end after someone already ragequited , in a system where there 's no countermeasures to help a team with less players this just reinforces negativity from the expectation of a slow and agonizing loss . 
  that 's where point ( 2 ) is important . 
  the gold gain redistribution allows the remaining players at least a small advantage that might allow them a real fighting chance vs a full enemy team . 
  would you like to see riot implement more countermeasures like dota 2 has ? 
  * sidenote : abandoned players who reconnect will begin to gain gold passively again , but will not recover any of his/her lost gold . 
  [ someone in the main sub compared ranked numbers from last year to this year ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6dduk8/a_worrying_trend_for_na_over_the_past_12_months/ ) , it seems na definitely is declining in users . 
  edit : ** holy shit guys : read the second paragraph : **, 
  apparently the rest of the numbers ca n't be trustworthy since op.gg did n't reset the numbers for the other regions from last year , so people that played in the last season still show up as active ranked players this season . 
  with the introduction of the new client riot removed item sets because according to them `` not enough people used them so instead of trying to understand why and improve it we decided to remove it '' ( paraphrasing ) . 
  after the lol sub bitched , more than half a year later , they are finally introducing item sets ... limited to 20 , which as far as i remember had no limit in the previous client lul . 
  the fountain has been one of those movies that i 've personally enjoyed but i barely see people talking about it , in a similar way to tarsem singh 's the fall , but while the fall i can point out some critical issues with it ( mostly the slow pacing ) , i struggled to find reasons to justify the abysmal reviews the movie got . 
  today i was binging videos made by [ movies with mikey and in his analysis of the fountain ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzyokhl3lms ) , he pretty much just says the critics misunderstood the narrative , tl ; dr : people did n't understand how the 3 stories were connected , that is , the `` past '' and `` future '' stories were the book that the wife was writing in the present . 
  do you agree with him ? 
  or does the movie have more issues than people just `` not getting it '' ? 
   [ meanwhile dota 2 especially just expected you to understand bit of lingo . 
  `` did he backpack that ? 
  yeah he must have backpacked that '' [ literal quote i heard typing this ] tells a new player nothing . 
  backpack means ... having an item ? 
  what item or ability did he backpack ? 
  who is he ? 
  they explain the gold difference and items pretty well but the action language is totally foreign unless you have lots of dota experience . 
  ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6jt1p7/things_that_league_and_overwatch_pro_casters_do/ ), 
  also for some reason , [ the most upvoted comment is criticizing dota 's visual style ... in a casting thread ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6jt1p7/things_that_league_and_overwatch_pro_casters_do/djgwb7m/ ), 
  ** tl ; dr : the regional system of riot has failed multiple times at protecting the players , the reason that people actually watch their esport scene . 
  one of the biggest arguments in favor of the lcs and similar regional tournament system is that it brings better job stability and security for the players when compared to circuit systems like in dota and cs . 
  yet , today it has been announced that kespa , the korean esports government body , will take control of the lck team longzhu gaming until the end of the year , after accusations of lack of payment to the players and other negligence issues .
