  unfortunately for pray and gorilla longzhu 's botlane ( and 2 of the best players in the world ) is nothing new , since they already experienced similar situations while they were part of rox * tigers , where the squad at times had to play scrim in pc bangs because they did n't have conditions in their house , and went to worlds with pretty much no money , they were the second best team in the world at that time btw . 
  besides these cases there 's all the shady business that happens in the smaller regions like brazil and more recently tainted minds in australia , and there 's even several cases over the last 4 years of lack of payment and player abuse in orgs in na and eu , riot controlled regions !, 
  is n't there enough evidence that the lcs `` experiment '' has failed when it comes to protecting the players ? 
  also the player union is useless here since it 's na exclusive for now .

  ** tl ; dr : the 2 import limit makes it hard for players from smaller regions to improve and get better economic and personal opportunities . 
  currently riot has implemented a 2 foreign player limit , which in the case of western organizations is mostly filled with koreans . 
  in this current system any player from the smaller regions with interest of playing in the major regions , where they have more economic opportunities and better chances to improve , has pretty much zero chance of ever getting picked since for most orgs , if they have a foreign spot open , prefer importing players from other major regions . 
  there 's been cases of talented players coming from smaller regions , like quas and more recently inori , so he know there can be big talent in the smaller regions that could easily fill primary positions in bottom tier na and eu teams or at least fill positions in the future challenger squads in the na franchise . 
  ** possible solution : ** lift the 2-player limit ban if the player is from a non-tier 1 region ( na/eu/china / korea ) , this at least would allow western teams to scout talent from other smaller scenes like south america , oceania , russia/turkey , etc. 
  the podcast company gimlet media started a new podcast series about the life and death of chris lighty , [ you can find it here ] ( https://gimletmedia.com/mogul/ ) ( or in any podcast feed that you use i guess ) , the show is really well produced so i thought i should share . 
   the podcast is about the story of the birth of hip-hop and a hip-hop legend , but it 's also about the darker side of the industry . 
  it 's the story of how a kid from the bronx , managed to rise so high . 
  and how , when he got there , everything went so wrong . 
  the show is hosted by reggie oss\u00e9 , known as combat jack , first rose to prominence as founding partner of the small nyc law firm oss\u00e9 and woods , where his clients included such legends as jay-z , damon dash , dmx , and sean `` diddy '' combs, 
  right now the eu vs na rivals final barely reaches 300k even though :, 
  - it 's on a weekend , at a good time for both regions, 
  - rare international competition and it has the `` regional pride '' thematic, 
  - has the team with the biggest western fanbase playing, 
  it 's impossible to defend how little people in eu and na give a shit about league esports , that or people are just bored to death of watching the same shit over and over again . 
  what movies do you think got less favorable reception either from critics or average viewers because they `` did n't get it '' , by this i do n't mean they were n't smart enough , just missed important information or details in the movie that better explain something important about the movie . 
  for example :, 
  the fountain : many people including critics do n't seem to understand that the conquistador story is the book being written by the wife , while the space tree is the continuation written by the husband after she dies , the symbolism of both `` past '' and `` future '' narratives are the perspectives on life and death of the dying wife and the grieving husband . 
  colossal : many people think the movie was badly written because one character `` changes '' personality drastically in the middle of it , when in reality there were many hints , in a similar way to how it was done in get out . 
  spoilers : [ like the scene which is done as a awkward comedy moment when he says that his mother died when they were in primary school and she even went to her funeral as kids , this explains a lot about his character especially his behavior as an young kid and what probably happened to his dad ] ( #spoiler ), 
  riot released their [ msi 2017 by the numbers ] ( http://www.lolesports.com/en_us/articles/2017-mid-season-invitational-numbers ) and it obviously shows that riot is trying to hide the decline in viewership , according to riot they had 364 million total unique viewers ... ** over the span of the entire tournament and counting rebroadcasts ** , until now they always only gave daily unique impressions , which to be fair this number is beyond useless because we do n't know how long is an `` impression '' anyways , [ but the peasants are eating that 364 million number up . 
  ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6miinc/2017_midseason_invitational_by_the_numbers/ ), 
  eu vs na rivals finals had 333k western viewers , which according to many peasants is entirely reasonable , because no good applepie eating american would wake up on a saturday between 9 a.m ( west coast ) and 1 p.m ( east coast ) to watch an international final with their favorite team in the world playing . 
  [ peasants finding excuses 1 ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6miinc/2017_midseason_invitational_by_the_numbers/dk1wl9i/ ) ; [ peasants being blind 2 ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6m970b/rift_rivals_is_great/djzwmek/ ), 
  [ someone on twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/deapps/status/885864922479046657 ) noticed that riot delayed the application deadline ( which was today ) for the na lcs franchise that will start next year , an extra 14 days to 28/7 without releasing any announcement about the change . 
  [ jacob wolf confirming the previous deadline was 14/7 ] ( https://twitter.com/jacobnwolf/status/885874952531988480 ), 
  maybe the reception was n't as positive as they expected ? 
  maybe the teams asked for more time before giving confirmation ? 
  riot announced that developers will stop having access to data from any normal matches ( non-ranked ) through their api , this as always been allowed , and for many people that only play normals , this will make websites like op.gg useless to see their own stats . 
  [ subreddit thread ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6o2kxp/normal_game_stats_are_going_away/ ), 
  conspiracy theory : they realized that the playerbase is declining in a noticeable way and want to stop people from having access to that information . 
  i almost never had issues watching movies with some occasional shaky cam scenes , yet today while watching a clip of christian bale and johnny deep 's public enemies i reminded myself that i never actually finished the movie since i had to stop because the camera work and odd cinematography was making me incredibly nauseous . 
  has that ever happened to any of you with other movies ? 
  ** tl ; dr : na lcs  eu lcs in production/investment/viewership , riot should merge both and create western league championship produced in na , while helping the development of european national leagues . 
  we are reaching a point where na lcs and eu lcs are n't even comparable anymore , na has a larger viewer base ( mostly because it 's easier for both europeans and americans to watch it ) and bigger investments , meanwhile , european teams struggle to get sponsors , especially since unlike what many people think europe is not a single market when it comes to sponsors and advertising , most companies prefer target marketing , specially when it 's more effective to target people in their native language , this was confirmed by giants owner who said that losing the lcs spot was n't a big issue since most of their sponsors were spanish and did n't care about , for example , the german market ( where the lcs happens ) . 
  the reality currently is that there 's no reason for a team or a player to not prefer working in na instead of in eu . 
  and a good solution for both teams and viewers would be for riot to merge the lcs into a ** western league of legends championship **, 
  a franchise with both na and eu orgs . 
  produced in north america by riot . 
  with no import slot restrictions for european players , to incentivize getting european talent instead of koreans . 
  streamed using the schedule slots for the * ( defunct ) * eu lcs + na lcs, 
  ** benefits **, 
  bigger eu orgs would be able some stability within the franchise system, 
  eu players get better payments and access to the player 's union, 
  the top tier talent of both regions would finally be able to compete more frequently , which is a benefit to both players and viewers, 
  ** meanwhile in europe , riot should help develop more the national leagues **, 
  there 's already big enough national scenes in most european countries , look at spain , origen/g2/giants all had a second squad that exclusively played in the national spanish lol league . 
  there would be a bigger incentive for traditional sport clubs to create their squads when they can participate in their national league of legends tournaments , the initial investment would be lower and they could directly work inside their own country, 
  people would be more interested in watching their regional leagues thanks to national identity and pride, 
  to make it truly competitive , riot could organize before worlds a european cup tournament with the top teams from each national league , and the winner could get a wildcard spot for worlds . 
  [ removed ], 
  recently the [ fantastic podcast radiolab ] ( http://www.radiolab.org/story/breaking-news/ ) did a story about the possible loss of credibility from audio and video footage in the future thanks to 2 different technologies in development : voice editing , they give the example of [ adobe 's recent software voco ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3l4xlz59iw ) , and facial reenactment , [ they mention this program in particular ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohmajjtcpnk ), 
  now while this might be scary from a political standpoint , all i could think was how much easier these technologies would make voice acting and face animation in modern game production , specially in triple a titles where there 's a big focus on voice acting . 
  currently both processes are excruciatingly long and troublesome for the actors , and in some cases you can see how the studio was restricted either thanks to time or budget constraints . 
  let 's use the example of fallout 4 , one of the biggest complains about the game was it 's lack of diverse options in the dialogue , it was an rpg where player choices were n't being felt in conversations . 
  you can point to issues with the game 's narrative and storytelling and it would be a fair criticism , but we ca n't ignore that trying to make a massive rpg where all characters are voiced probably did n't help . 
  now imagine that you could easily create lines of dialogue with the main actor 's voice without him having to be in the studio all the time and easily alter in-real time the face of the character in-game without having to go through the effort of the traditional mocap system . 
  obviously it 's doubtful that these systems would ever be at the same standard of having an actual actor recite the lines , and we are years away from these software being perfect . 
  but still , the possibility of creating almost limitless voice lines and animations while cutting a significant % of the manpower needed it 's pretty exciting . 
  i was discussing with a friend the possible future of riot games as a development studio , the good old `` where 's the s in riot games '' , specially thanks to the `` recent '' acquisition of radiant games and the possible league fighter , the discussion ended in talking about league of legends as a franchise ( think final fantasy/warcraft/metal gear ) , series that have multiple connected titles in completely different genres under their umbrella , in my opinion i do n't think league of legends has the legs to actually sustain a multi-title franchise , because usually franchises work because people get invested in a game 's world or/and characters . 
  even though riot has made an effort lately in their lore department , lets be honest , the vast vast majority of people that play league they play it for the game itself , either for it 's competitive side or for the social aspect of it ( playing with friends ) , most people do n't give a shit about the characters besides what their abilities do , and much less about their lore or the lore of the world . 
  there 's nothing wrong with that per say , but even though league is one of the most played games in the world , at the end of the day it does n't feel like league is part of gaming 's mainstream pop culture . 
  so , going back to the main question , do you think league of legends could sustain a multi-title franchise like my previous examples ? 
  or do you think league will remain an sideline niche in gaming 's culture . 
  with the introduction of the future channel-blink rune , it appears riot is open to creating runes that can alter how summoner 's spells work , this might bring some diversity to the summoner 's spells , which right now besides midlane are pretty stale . 
  so why not open the doors to other summoner spells besides flash , me personally do n't think channel-blink is that good , but it 's a good enough starting point to give alternatives that could be useful in different contexts , some examples :, 
  | | ** flash **, 
   - ** greater lengths ** - increases flash range to 725 units ( extra 300 range ) ^ ^ we ^ ^ dota ^ ^ now ^ ^ boys !, 
   - ** double tap ** - when you use flash you can use it again for 1.5 seconds , if you use the second flash the cooldown will increase by an extra 150 seconds . 
  | | ** ignite **, 
   - ** the mark ** - ignite deals only 75 % of the true damage over 5 seconds , but during that time the user gets increased movement speed when chasing a marked target . 
   - ** fire pit ** - champions ignited burn allies around them for 1/4 of the true damage but also apply grievous wounds to their allies . 
  | | ** exhaust **, 
   - ** sheep ** - target gets polymorphed into a sheep for the duration of exhaust , but gets increased movement speed towards his allies ( because he 's a coward ) . 
   - ** stay ** - the target gets slowed/reduced damage but also gets `` grounded '' during the duration . 
  | | ** barrier **, 
   - ** fortify ** - during the duration of barrier or until it breaks the user receives a %, 
  of his resistances, 
   - ** spell immunity ** - during the duration of barrier or until it breaks the user is immune to the effect of any spell, 
  these are just some random ideas , some stolen from other games ... if you could `` enhance '' summoner 's spells with runes what would you like to see ? 
  edit : fuck tl pulled a reverse sweep ... they are n't getting relegated ... 
  which squad do you guys think feels more like a waste of money to steve right now ? 
  reminder that tl lol squad has 12 players signed , including the rumored 700k salary reignover , who btw , was benched after tl recently wasted more money in getting dardoch back ... a player they made a 1 hour long documentary about how shitty he is . 
  when i saw vol .2 for the first time i was slightly disappointed , vol .1 was my favorite marvel movie by a long shot , i loved how it embraced the weirds parts of marvel 's space setting , with all it 's weird different worlds including visiting the repurposed dead celestial head . 
  vol .2 on the other hand felt like a cartoon , james gunn definitely pumped all cheesiness of his characters and humor to the max , and it felt too different from the first one , it was like a cartoon version of gotg . 
  but on second viewing you are able to understand better what gunn wanted to do with the sequel , it 's definitely a much sadder movie , even though vol .1 started with one of the most depressing heart crushing moments in the marvel universe , the movie never really dwelled into that place again much . 
  but in gotg vol .2 there 's several moments when you feel incredibly sad for the characters and their personal stories , the 80 's saturday cartoon feel serves to give contrast to those moments , anything less than that and the movie would ' t really work . 
  i 'm not saying the movie does n't have other issues , but it really made me respect more what gunn tried to do with vol .2 , i still think the guardians are the best movies at telling personal stories in the marvel universe . 
  one of the core criticism of league of legends pro-play when compared with other similar titles is how low action/low kills the games can be in the early game , with the vast majority of matches staying below the double digits @ 20 minutes , and very rarely reaching the satisfying rule of at least 1 kill per minute of game . 
  on the other hand analysts like the now infamous montecristo said over and over again that the perfect match of league of legends should have very little kills and mostly win through macrostrategy . 
  - do you agree with monte 's perspective of how high level should be played ? 
  - as a viewer do you find entertaining games with very low kill scores ? 
  - do you think that 's even possible to incentivize early game kills without breaking soloq ?
