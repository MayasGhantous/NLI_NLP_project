  towers de-isolate targets , removing a ton of your burst damage, 
  in my opinion the only issue is jungle kha ` six and how shitty warrior 's is currently vs the other jungle items . 
  the other items synergize and scale better for late game , cinderhulk ( 10 % extra health ) ; devourer into sated devourer ; runeglaive ( extra ap ratio ), 
  it 's free + the dreadknight skin if you follow riot on twitter like pink tristana and `` this is pretty much his standard skin now '' alistar, 
  the scariest comp this season , where entire pick & ban phases were built around , was the juggermaw , with kog played as an adc . 
  and he was mostly played as an adc recently in the asian playoffs and gauntlets .

  i got the perception that most samsung players were trying to cash out their careers for as long as they could before retiring , they already got the fame as world champions and the pro-gamer career last like 4 ~ 5 years ? 
  most will go back to school or do their military time after , why not make as much money as possible so they can to have a nice safety net later on . 
  make it the free skin for the japanese server launch :d, 
  ^ ^ sorry ^ ^ japan, 
  possibly they are allowing her to be the niche top/mid adc , they were much against the use of role-specific champions in other lanes , that seems to have changed since they released kindred , the jungler adc . 
  honestly his xerath was extremely lackluster , to be fair he was always focused by the entire enemy team , and being a immobile caster is rough . 
  also after a while xerath just dropped from the meta , the same happened to gbm , he would get a lead on this godlike xerath but could n't carry his team with that pick . 
  team ranked you can queue with people from any tier ( bronze to diamond + ) while in dynamic queue you have the usual tier restrictions of duo queue . 
   95 % of my games as the solo guy in a 4 man premade vs another 4 man premade with an equally oppressed guy . 
  it 's the opposite - ___ - you have a 5 % chance of being in a game with 4 premades, 
  honestly , the entire last season was the best example of giving fans closure , it was 13 episodes made entirely for the fans satisfaction but still without feeling forced and with a lot of heart and care .

  yeah , let our assassin blow all his cooldowns on the support who does no damage , while the other 4 teammates cc and delete him, 
  it 's actually because in comparison with other mammals human babies are all born premature , this was an evolutionary adaptation to humans being bipedal , which changed by necessity our pelvic bones this included having a more narrow pelvic opening , so to keep our huge and brainy heads we are born `` premature '' , smaller and not fully formed bones , to help the birth process .

  but they had reignover that could translate ingame and communicate between the english speaking players and huni . 
  huni probably improved so much is english thanks to reignover 's help .

  riot magus commented [ in another thread today ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3v8q89/if_riot_is_going_to_force_ogn_to_give_up_half_the/cxlcqur ) we should have more infor next week, 
  it ticks 5 times during 5 seconds , each tick does the 100 +150 % ad x5 = 500 + 750 % ad, 
  honestly i always saw graves as a poor man 's lucian , aside from the inherent tankiness from graves both were high-mobility burst adcs , and lucian was more mobile and with more consistent burst and poke . 
  not really my area , i 'm mostly interested in human biology/behaviour and doing my masters in medical anthropology , but one of my friends doing his masters in social/cultural anthropology loves the area of business anthropology , he repeatedly mentions genevieve bell , an australian anthropologist that currently works for intel , she has a ton of work published , and it 's a success story in the field it seems . 
  but it increases is ad ... which is extremely counterintuitive and an unnecessary gimmick , why would you ever buy attackspeed on him then ? 
  when they announced dynamic queue riot said they were constructing the code to match similar groups ( ex : 4 +1 vs 4 +1 ) and 4 premades would probably get longer queue times thanks to this , in most elos finding similar premade groups should n't be too hard , so honestly all this fuzz makes no sense for 99 % of the players . 
  i think the real issue and what people are using as example , even though it 's not the same context for the majority of players , is d1/master/challenger , which thanks to the small players size 5 premades vs 5 solos is very probable . 
  maybe they can restrict dynamic queue per elo , for example : you are in diamond + + you can only use dynamic queue with 2 other people , or just keep the 2 premades rule for highelo ( which honestly already seems to be an issue the previous season ), 
  true , but people do n't realize that because they are all using high elo examples with an extremely small players sample size ( which is the real issue and should have some type of restriction ) , for low diamond and down it should n't be hard to match similar premade groups . 
   i have zero friends at the same skill level to duo with ( i 'm low plat , all my actual friends are either mid diamond or low gold ) ,, 
  ... but you can play with anyone 1 tier below and above you , so you can play with your friends .

  overexageration , [ looked back ] ( http://matchhistory.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/euw1/2446504666/30907318?tab=overview&amp;participant=10 ) , he backed @ 10 for banner , it was a very slow early game , and i never had been cheesed by banner first item heimer , so it scarred my mind for ever v.v, 
  i climbed last season playing 80 % top and following the `` just do n't feed the enemy laner and peel for the carries '' motto , guess i 'm prepared . 
  honestly hate the mentality of `` i must carry and deal most damage '' in league , good team plays is way more satisfying for me . 
  even though i agree issues should be debated in a civilized manner ( not by created posts whining and qq ` ing ) i also do n't think most people realise that riot would never do something that would fuck up hard enough to lose players in their only source of revenue , they have between 1000-5000 employees , there 's a huge pressure to not put those people out of work . 
  also most decisions are never a `` do or die '' situation , most , like dynamic queue , can be adapted and improved with * gasp * constructive consumer reactions and critiques :o,

  which is an issue for 0,01 % of the ranked population , and even less if you count the majority that only play normals . 
  i still maintain my opinion that limiting to 3 premades ( or any other restriction ) for diamond + would attenuate the issue .

  [ kelsey said they were on 6.3 ] ( https://twitter.com/karonmoser/status/706572984777977856 ) , do n't watch much lpl because of lack of time , but since you do , is it true they really do n't have that many lane swaps ? 
  it seemed to be their biggest issue early game, 
  i stopped watching after that scene the first time i tried to watch the movie , not only did the dad go save the dog ( which was contrived as fuck ) knowing that clark was faster and more durable than him in case something went wrong , but he also forbade clark from saving him and clark complied ... no that 's stupid , people are selfish , no one having the option to save a parent would chose not to do it `` out of respect '' even with those stupid teachings about `` keeping it in secret '' , which also made me hate this version of supes . 
  i googled him and [ it seems froskurinn made a video about him ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iz2ijibwnb0 ) a couple of months ago for those interested . 
  i think people tend to `` burn out '' from the game mostly due to meta changes , you eventually go back if there 's a meta you enjoy more . 
  also their matchmaking is kinda of a mess right now , or at least not working as correctly as they said it would .

  how is na a bigger market ? 
  just counting ranked players ( a small percentage of the league population ) in euw and eue on op.gg we have more than double the ranked population , europe has by far a bigger market than na . 
  still the issue is with na lcs production team vs the european lcs production team who seems to be underfinanced to produce these videos , or just do n't care . 
  then , if places outside of the us do n't consider gaming a taboo , should n't that indicate that it was more probable for people there to play their game and actually watch their tournaments , since there is n't such a stigma around it ? 
  ramsay bolton agrees , never waste good meat, 
  i wish they made his ult what thematically should do , remove the damage and when he ults he gets back all the cooldowns he had before , that at least would be more fun than `` press r and if someone is near your shadow they are deleted '',

  i hated it the first time , and i rewatched it recently and had a better experience , yet even though i love the cinematography and soundtrack , i was annoyed by some character 's decision making since it made no sense . 
  honestly , it 's the end of the world , these people were picked to save humanity above all else , yet some react very not logically for a group of trained astronauts and scientists , chris evans character was honestly the most reasonable of the bunch . 
  the movie also has a ton of plot holes just to create tension :\\, 
  i 'm actually from portugal , we have breaks in the mid point of all movies usually 5 minutes for a bathroom break/smoke/grab food or drinks .

  honestly i only got to play malz once in ranked yet , but my first impression of the minions went from `` omg so many voidlings ! '', 
  to `` holy shit they deal zero damage and die pretty fast :\\ '' . 
  his early shove is still retarded , i wish they made the spawning voidlings equate to the w level as in level 1 - 1 voidling , level 2 - 2 voidlings etc. 
  at least it would prevent the zero counterplay of `` e a minion and spawn a bunch voidlings and delete wave in 3 seconds '' at level 2 , it would fuck jungle malz though .
