  i subbed initially for the videos about korean culture , i thought they always tried to balance their personal experience with knowledge taken from their korean friends , which was really interesting , i did enjoy the food stuff at the start , but it became 99 % of their content and i got bored . 
  i also agree that they look like very nice people . 
  his next gn `` seconds '' was really good as well , would love to see it turned into a movie , but not by edgar wright , it feels more like the `` eternal sunshine of the spotless mind '' type, 
  that 's the result of them cherry picking stuff from the graphic novel , it could have been a fun popcorn flick like kickass and kingsman , two other `` adaptations '' of millar 's work , but they made a generic spies thrillers with superhero stuff in the middle that did n't make sense in the movie universe . 
  honestly i have 18 pages and 90 % of the time i just use the same standard ap / ad pages , itemization pretty much made most pages useless , case in point : how easy it is to get cdr in pretty much anything . 
  tl ; dr : 2 rune pages + good itemization is enough, 
  my jungler in plat 2 decided that mountain drake was not worth getting and was worse than ocean , i think it 's more an issue with people still not understanding the utility of the different drakes . 
  he 's working for eu lcs has a video production contractor , there 's a good chance he made this video . 
  because there is , from the 2011 uk census :, 
  plus we do n't have data on the 15 to 17 that ca n't vote from that 15-19 number . 
  also known as ~ ~ `` immigrant '' ~ ~ `` emigrant '' , that word that british people seem to hate to use in certain contexts . 
  ^ ^ / generalization, 
  the history of the epidemiological investigation of kuru is fascinating and a great example of the benefits of multidisciplinary teams in health studies ( which as a medical anthropology master student , i highly approve ) . 
  more recently there 's some amazing papers reflecting on the disease and its history written by some of the main investigators like michael alpers ( medical investigator ) and shirley lindenbaum ( anthropologist ) , highly recommend for people interested in epidemiological studies and the people working on them . 
  but this season when you lost one fight at 30 minutes you did n't even have to snowball the lead , you straight up just went mid , destroy 3 towers in a row during their death timers and win , that was the main complain . 
  people want the ability to see outplays have repercussions on the match and for the other team to have mechanisms for comebacks , right now riot just diluted both snowballing and comebacks and unless a team is miles ahead of the other , they always seem to be at in even field ( same gold same objectives ) during the entire match until someone eventually wins a teamfight late enough to win the match . 
  `` british '' ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ joke ^ ^ ^ mates, 
  do you wan na trade ? 
  it 's 38\u00ba-40\u00ba in portugal right now , i would n't mind the cold weather at all . 
  sounds like a remix of the original theme for league and [ surf rider ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soh7t6mal3a ), 
  but could n't that have been because of the celebrations of the storming of the bastille ? 
  the same celebration people were grouping for in the nice park before the retard showed up :\\, 
  above ex machina , at world 's end and the road o_o , well everyone is entitled to their opinion i guess ... 
  it 's really good and beautifully shot , just , do n't watch it if you are not ready to be depressed and sad . 
  nobody ever mentions `` top ten '' :\\ i loved the world he created in that series, 
  case in point `` serenity '' , trying to explain to friends that never watched firefly why [ spoiler ] ( / s `` book 's and wash 's deaths '' ) were important to me was extremely hard because they barely had any development in the movie . 
  for a fan of the show it works , as a closed film not really :\\, 
  it 's even more jarring and ridiculous if you saw the citizenfour documentary , with actual footage of snowden and of the event . 
  which in all regards is a really well done doc , i liked that the journalists were trying to find the personal reason why snowden leaked the docs , it made him more relatable but also made him look very self centered . 
  yeah , nautilus 's q is complete bullshit and incredibly unintuitive , you can get someone even though you were sure you missed but you can also thread the needle with that giant anchor like it 's a nidalee spear . ^ ^ i ^ ^ miss ^ ^ the ^ ^ naut ^ ^ top ^ ^ meta, 
  it 's their website they are allowed to decide how to apply their rules , same thing with twitter and censoring racist or sexist comments . 
  the only real power a user has is not to use their service . 
  honestly , nightblue tilts me when he does stupid stuff just to entertain chat and feeds horribly , i guess that 's how he makes his living still kinda shitty for his teammates i guess :\\, 
  naut 's autos are the most frustrating thing ever if you do n't have some attack speed , people can literally dodge your autos by walking away while you are still mid animation , cancelling your auto and making you just stand there frozen ... looking at them walking away ; __ ;, 
  there 's also some very talented people that work for riot , like their music and art departments as well as the more recent lore team . 
  it 's a shame that to the public riot wants to look as an open community based company but feel like they just ignore most feedback even after they say `` they hear us '' . 
  honestly , a couple of years ago i found their company structure ( no hierarchy , everyone is at the same level and work in multidisciplinary teams ) really great , but now more and more it seems like there 's no actual communication within the company thanks to it . 
  at least this is my perspective from the outside , do n't know what actually goes on inside riot . 
  [ he sure seems to love fantasia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=penjyqnylik ), 
  my issue with dynamic queue is that riot is telling us that right now people in groups have an higher winrate than soloqueuers , but they want all players to have similar probabilities to win a match either by being in a full group or from 4 man to solo , which contradicts everything they have been doing in terms of balance in the game . 
  they made teamwork and coordination a must , so people queue with friends will always have a better chance to climb , they ca n't honestly say they want a soloqueuer to have the same 50 50 change of winning than people in groups , cause that will never happen and contradicts their current balance philosophy . 
  yet , we are all in the same ladder , being `` evaluated '' in the same terms . 
  you are asking kids to waste their late teens and early twenties playing a game professionally in a mostly unstable environment ( even though riot 's system does help create some sort of stability ) without knowing when it will eventually end meanwhile postponing other work possibilities that would give them better cvs or even an university degree , if you have the skills and you want to follow an esports career thinking about the money in it is just being fiscally responsible . 
  i 'm sorry but `` thats not what esports is about '' is such an naive cop-out . 
  i need to rewatch carnage , i remember loving it , but it was very far from a comedy in my head :|, 
  not really anthropology podcasts but i think [ 99 % invisible ] ( http://99percentinvisible.org/ ) and [ radiolab ] ( http://www.radiolab.org/archive/ ) presentational methodology and investigation is really interesting when viewed from an ethnography prespective . 
  but again , i do n't remember them addressing anthropological ideas directly but they tend to talk a lot about human behavior , people 's interactions to urban or tech design , and other topics . 
  damn :\\ he 's getting worse and worse with each film lately , i remember thinking he would be the next big thing ( like edgar wright at the time ) , i loved thank you for smoking , up in the air had great actors and juno was ok aside from some weird subplots and george michael being george michael , on the other hand i had to stop watching young adult after 20 minutes because the main characters reactions were making me cringe too hard to deal with it . 
  it was weird that so many edgar wright quirks stayed in that movie , like the jump cut editing while the friend recalled where he got the information , yet the comedy felt very `` american '' with all the improv thing they love doing that to me feels extremely forced some times . 
  but you are right , aside from those few scenes , it was the a marvel movie , same aesthetics , same story beats , same soundtrack , marvel movies are feeling more and more like different episodes of a decade long tv show , with guardians of the galaxy being that episode where they all took drugs and it got trippy , but people still love it because it 's a marvel movie . 
  most enjoyment i get is from references though :\\, 
  did it feel like a 2 hours long trailer ? 
  damn totally forgot about utopia , i binged watched it when i tried to find more british shows after watching sherlock , utopia and black mirror were on another level . 
  i thought it ended pretty well , ca n't remember feeling unsatisfied by the ending . 
  yup , i remember watching him because even though he was a jungler he used to talk a lot about what the other laners in his team should do to help him and vice-versa , and what the enemy laners did correctly or wrong to counter his ganks , old old trick also used to be a little like this ( i still have mental references about jungle paths you should be worried as a midlaner from trick 's streams ) , now they are both 99 % memes and loud screaming < _ <, 
  they focus group tested the director 's cut vs the trailer studio cut , the end is a mesh of the two [ source ] ( http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/suicide-squads-secret-drama-rushed-916693 ), 
  so ... hyperlink each skin to skinspotlights youtube channel ? 
  the director talked about it in the q&a yesterday , the guy that died was going to get married and asked vinicios ( brazilian dude ) to be his best man at the wedding , which makes everything so much worse . 
  ~ ~ edit : victor is the one that died , sorry , ca n't find the name of the guy in the doc :| ~ ~, 
  edit 2 : thanks riotjerkee !, 
  someone did concept art for this [ concept 1 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rlfrkpd.jpg ) ; [ concept 2 ] ( http://img04.deviantart.net/9ecc/i/2015/089/7/1/braum_safe_breaker_by_karamlik-d8fjfzo.png ), 
  if dc wanted finally to do a more family friendly movie they could totally do a teen titan or young justice , you have people that loved the 80 's / 90 's comics and the newer generations that grew up with the animated shows , it 's a pretty wide demographic and they could include blue beetle and make cyborg their adult supervisor . 
  i think marvel could also get that latino demographic with a coming of age movie with little nova ( sam alexander ) , now that the nova corps were destroyed mostly ( ? 
  ) , he could even team up with young spidey :d, 
  i still use young justice as an example on how company executives have zero brain cells , really cancel a freaking successful show because there 's too many girls watching it and you want to sell toys to boys ?!? 
  you just doubled your demographic and you are canceling it because it was n't your target ? 
  not sure if you are being sarcastic ... but you are thinking of dc 's captain marvel ... the one that screams shazam !, 
  well , europe sure loves the football manager games , some of us have been training for this moment for years !, 
  it also literally `` opens '' your access to the adc or apc if you ult them , since their team has to actively avoid and get out of the way if they do n't wan na get cc ` ed for 3 seconds, 
  i thought mr. 
  robot was pretty respectful o.o i have literally zero tech knowledge and much less `` hacking '' , but i always read the show was pretty grounded in reality . 
   `` beware the depths targets that depth charge passes through are now stunned for 1/1 .5 / 2 seconds in addition to the knockup '', 
  then why say `` in addition to the knockup '' ? 
  maybe i 'm reading it wrong :\\, 
  it honestly looked like a snl sketch of ghostbusters mocking the young girl empowerment movement , i 'm fine with improv when the actors have control over the characters , but when its used in a narrative driven movie where the characters have a backstory and distinct personalities they just look like actors doing improv pretending to be characters from something else ... like in snl . 
  to be fair i did n't watch the movie , it might actually have strong characterizations and good/smart comedy scenes , but i 'm talking from the perspective of someone that saw the marketing and all the buzz around it which at the end created my perception of the movie and resulted in my lost of interest . 
  this is a news story about people not actually watching the movie after all :|, 
  i thought it was actively insulting , to the original material ( which i would love to see fincher to a spin of the novel ) , insulting to the work that real health workers and epidemiology organizations do , and straight up boring as a zombie flick as it did nothing special to differentiate from an already over done genre ( it 's walking dead mixed with soderbergh 's also shitty `` contagion '' ) , they could i do n't know , tell the story of an epidemiology investigation with the personal retellings of the proliferation of the disease from the perspectives of very different people around the world ... which was the book . 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ really ^ ^ hated ^ ^ this ^ ^ movie ^ ^ sorry, 
  i actually have a friend doing his thesis on the socioeconomic impact and cultural influence of microtransactions in videogames ( including league ) , there 's so much that could be studied right now in gaming . 
  have you tried talking to eu rioters ? 
  [ draggles is the eu community specialist ] ( https://twitter.com/bedraggles ) he might be able too hook you up with some interesting people to interview , also [ rioteglorian ] ( https://twitter.com/rioteglorian ) works in the eu lcs as production manager he might also be able to help . 
  their new show / allchat is n't bad , it 's better now what it was at the beginning when they were doing really weird scripted jokes , the newer ones can be fun , specially the episodes where they interact with the community in events , they feel more relaxed and less staged i guess . 
  also nika is doing her own thing now , mostly creative writing , you can follow her at her [ patreon ] ( https://www.patreon.com/nikaharper ), 
  i just saw her twitter o.o wtf, 
  have not been able to watch most lck matches , has anyone even tried a karma ( mid ) - kog ( adc ) - lulu ( sup ) comp in the last couple of patches ? 
  it 's depressing how tanky kog gets with karma/lulu, 
  the korean lck produced by ogn has them , none of the other regions or international riot events use them , because `` it interferes with player - fans interaction '' and are too expensive , which makes no sense when lcs has a studio where they can install them and use them every single week ... like the koreans do . 
  lpl is on right now and they are definitely not in booths , the players are like at 3 meters from the crowd :|, 
  is n't that just incremental chance ? 
  with each non-crit auto you make , there 's an higher chance the next is a crit . 
  dude , at least change the title a bit if you are going to spam [ `` after watching ti6 '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4xoe90/after_watching_ti6_its_very_hard_to_go_back_to/ ) threads, 
  as much as i love the flash , aside from a few shining performances from carlos valdes , tom cavanagh and the always lovely jesse l. martin ( and gustin when he 's crying ) most of the acting in flash and arrow is `` tv good '' and sometimes goes into `` tv cheesy bad '' specially the female characters , which might be related to the fact the writers in both shows ca n't write women to save their lives , flash 's mom is still my favorite female character and she has like 2 lines in the entire show < _ <, 
  it 's the same group of people that believe upvoting images will make them show up on google results ... it will , but just for them , because google results are adapted to each user and they frequently go to that subreddit - __ -, 
  that 's why vods exist , it 's pretty much impossible to even watch most eu and na lcs matches anyways . 
  also , thanks [ r/loleventvods ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/loleventvods/ ), 
  see the rest of that channel 's videos , it was suggested to me by youtube when i was binge watching science and other educational channels which makes no sense , i still do n't understand how this one has so many subscribers . 
  because they are n't currently high tier players in their leagues , unlike ~ ~ sven ~ ~ zven and mithy .
