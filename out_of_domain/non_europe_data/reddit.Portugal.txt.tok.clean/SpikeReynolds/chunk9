  garen ), 
  there 's a number of different factors , the meta was n't much fun to watch , the change in schedules and streams might have confused some people , but honestly for me personally i just got jaded by so many matches across all 4 major regions , which is why it was sad that monte stopped doing the `` what to watch '' series for ogn , at least it helped limiting the amount of games that were actually worth watching , i stopped actively paying attention to lcs and even lck ( which i loved last year ) aside from when there was a match between 2 teams i liked . 
  and he times his ridiculously low cooldown q to kill you after you pop out of zhonya . 
  1 ) higher cooldown than zed 's q until you put 4 points into it, 
  2 ) does n't go through minions unlike zed 's q, 
  3 ) karma has actual mana so she ca n't just spam her q like him during laning phase, 
  99 % invisible has a super interesting podcast [ fixing the hobo suit ] ( http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/fixing-the-hobo-suit/ ) with several costume designers ( include designers for man of steel and bvs ) explaining the evolution of the design in movies and the thought process behind said evolution , it 's one of my favorite episodes . 
  honestly when i know i do n't have much kill potential like vs a riven top who can easily escape i always ask my jungler to focus mid and bot , i trust myself to play safe if i do n't have vision of the jungler ... not so much of my overextending bot lane . 
  i presume it 's pretty well known is most football ( soccer ) centric countries , including european ones , it is in portugal and probably spain since our version was dubbed in spanish . 
  as much as i love that movie and pretty much anything else edgar wright touches ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ would ^ ^ ^ also ^ ^ ^ love ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ be ^ ^ ^ touched ^ ^ ^ by ^ ^ ^ him ^ ^ ^ though i 'm kinda sad they left so much out from the graphic novel , the base is still there but you get much more context for the characters in the books , specially envy which i thought was n't really that fleshed out in the movie , still scott and ramona 's narcissism was well portrayed , they really deserved each other < _ <, 
  riot would just block them from using their ip in an independent league, 
  they could just make ward skins for each team and have a percentage go directly to the team , most people do n't care about icons , ward skins are actually in-game and you can show support for your favorite teams that * in-game * . ^ ^ also ^ ^ people ^ ^ would ^ ^ fucking ^ ^ ward ^ ^ more ^ ^ hopefully or even just a special taunt that shows their logo like they had for worlds , ffs is not even that hard , if riot really wants people to care about their pro scene they sure as fuck do n't show it by trying to implement it into their game aside from the icons and worlds winner skins , which i 'm pretty sure the players do n't see a cent for having their name associated to a skin , how many zed and ryze skins do you think were bought simply for being `` faker 's skin '' . 
  i would be fine dropping 5 $ or more for a icon + ward skin + special taunt for my favorite team . 
  well he ca n't do it on his own , they probably pay very talented editors which make the videos extremely pleasing to watch , but jatt could easily pay for editors himself if he was able to monetize his own youtube videos and even get sponsors and could still make a pretty nice profit from the work . 
  i understand that , i was trying to point out the potential mutual benefits of working with teams to produce cosmetics that players actually want , if there 's a market for more team-centric cosmetics riot is actually losing money by not producing them , and they are obligated to pay the teams because they do n't actually own the rights to their images ( which is why i presume a % of the icons have to go to the teams , otherwise riot would just keep 100 % of those profits as well ) , it 's virtual goods you only lose money on the initial production costs , the rest is mostly profits ... but they have to exist . 
  like you said people have different preferences , i personally do n't like team 's clothing but some people do , that 's great for them , but there 's no problem with having more options which usually result in more profits for everyone . 
  i 'm not bashing riot i 'm pointing out how there 's more ways to monetize their esport scene , most already implemented in other scenes like cs : go and dota . 
  add an enraged tibbers after you kill annie . 
  edit : that was a weird timing , patch 6.17 `` anger management tibbers ' bonus movement and attack speed after annie 's death decays 20 % faster '', 
  tell him you 're straight but are free for drinks later . 
  the player contracts are made with the organization not riot , the orgs own the player 's image , which riot has probably some rights to use based on the contract between riot and the organization . 
  as far as i know it 's not even riot that pays directly to the players , they give the money to the orgs . 
  which is weird when you look on how pr most of their official posts addressing directly community issues usually are , i do n't want most rioters to stop posting on reddit they all have a right to their personal opinions and it 's nice to see rioters in random threads , but their ceo should in no way talk in a public forum about a serious discussion . 
  if a small rioter says something stupid , that 's on him , if one of the heads says something shitty the entire company looks bad . 
  they already have rotating special modes on the weekends that change cooldowns or change the map , allow you to create minions etc etc etc , they honestly ca n't use the `` spaghetti code '' excused anymore , even a group of interns would be able to do a simple working sandbox mode . 
  and they are freelancers , they might have a few more liberties , also iem had ogn teams and the hearthstone tournament was also from ogn right ? 
  so ogn still had some form of interest in allowing them to split for the different events . 
  honestly it was n't that great , i did n't like at all how they tackled the `` social media '' reporting bubble , i understand it was from the perspective of traditional media and a lot of bad information comes from social media , but still , most of the scenes with dev patel 's character ( the social media expert ) felt like sorkin is becoming that grandpa trying to talk about their grandkids and their interwebz . 
  both fizz and ekko have 2 things that make them perfect for going tanky builds , % health damage + high-mobility for stickiness , unless they change that , the tank option will still exist ( if not prefered like right now ), 
  it seems to be from that historical japanese naval battleships turned into cute girls anime , honestly not the weirdest premise i 've heard for an anime . 
  honestly , 90 % plays of the game and other silly fanart and stories might get tired to see in the overwatch sub , but at least they seem happier or at least try to be positive , unlike this sub which feeds on negativity , any small drama will get upvoted for no reason , this place is becoming a post-apocalyptic wasteland . 
  i honestly regret doing my degree in anthropology , it 's super hard to justify a degree in anthropology in the job market when it would be easier with a more general field like sociology , biology or psychology . 
  on the other hand , masters are great if you have a interest in the a specific field , like someone with a degree in biology and a masters in physical anthropology , or a sociology major with a masters in social anthropology . 
  i have a degree in anthropology and finishing my masters in medical anthropology , i 'm pretty sure i 'm fucked in the current job market , i feel like i do n't even have qualifications to work in a store :\\, 
  to be fair my initial plan was going into physical anthropology , my father was an archeologist , so i had easy contacts to get into excavations and work in the area ... but by the end of my degree i realized i hated working with bones so that kinda ruined everything :| i would love to work in epidemiology , it was one of the reasons i went into medical anthropology , maybe i 'm just being too pessimistic and should look around for jobs better , good luck with your endeavours !, 
  i feel like medical anthropology tries to be the applied anthropology field with practical application but never achieves this , a friend of mine while having an existential crisis about his life prospects asked our master 's coordinator what kind of jobs we should be trying to get with a masters in medical anthropology , her answer was `` go get a doctorate '' ... 
  first , wow an admin :o , second , that 's awesome can you tell us what you do in general terms ? 
  to be fair my comment is in particular to my situation and where you are from plays a huge role in the ability to get a job in the area or not , i 'm from portugal and anthropology is not really seen as a job as much as a field for academic investigation , the few people i know working outside of academia are in museums or their local government administrations , the sad truth is that those who are able to continue their studies do it others just go into other fields or get random jobs :\\ also your cv and experience with other things you have also helps a lot , i spent 3 years working for our students union and organizing local and international academic events , which i hope might help me out in the long run . 
  thank you so much for the thoughtful answer , it sounds a lot like business anthropology applied to a digital context which is super interesting , i 've met a couple anthropologists working for big tech companies and they all told me how hard it is initially to `` sell '' yourself as an anthropologist and how you can be useful to them , was it easier to use your experience in online community management as a leeway instead of explaining what anthropology could do facilitate or improve your job ? 
  last year my university , which is comprised of mostly old school social anthropologists ( i.e. 
  african studies ) changed its curriculum for the social & cultural anthropology masters , we did try to implement a business anthropology class ( which was denied because nobody could teach it ) and a digital anthropology class ( which i still do n't think it will implemented like it should ) with some reluctance from the more senior staff , i feel like anthropology is missing out is not adapting fast enough from a purely theoretical field into a more practical one , do you think the general tech industry is opening itself more for the use of anthropologists ? 
  p.s : if you are ever in portugal please tell me , we would love to organize a talk to hear more on how applied anthropology is possible in the modern world :d, 
  thank you for the answers again !, 
  i 'm going to share your comments with our undergrads it might inspire a few to follow applied anthropology :d, 
  and the movie was released alongside a pretty good game for it 's target demographic , the soundtrack for the game by anamanaguchi is also really good . 
  :\\ yup , [ bryan lee o'malley was talking about trying to re-release it ] ( https://twitter.com/radiomaru/status/763496255024574464 ) maybe in a physical format . 
  i stopped listening to their podcast after finding another `` fun facts '' podcast called `` no such thing as a fish '' which is made by the guys that work for the british facts show qi , which is funnier and more knowledgeable than cracked . 
  i still listen to their podcasts when they are interviewing someone other than themselves , like the one with the epidemiology investigator . 
  yeah ... [ `` convoluted '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsr5n-q7axq ) is a nice enough word to describe it, 
  and ( besides cdr runes ) most of the runes only truly affect the first couple of levels , those 15 extra ad/ap or attackspeed are n't going to be a big factor at level 6 + , the only impact i feel between runes are slight differences while cs ` ing and that 's if you used to a specific page . 
  cass was already being used as a counter to vlad in lck no idea why it was n't more used in lcs playoffs :\\, 
  6 days before i 'm over 9.000 days old ... i feel like i should celebrate o.o, 
  if a 3d skin viewer is harder to implement , [ a plain `` 3d '' model like this tristana ] ( http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/champion-update/champion-update-tristana ) would be enough just to see how the skins actually look like , because let 's be honest there 's some that look nothing like their splashart , even more now thanks to the chinese artwork . 
  [ fat princess ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fat_princess ) was the actual title of an old ps3 capture the flag-type multiplayer game ( spoiler : the fat princess was the flag ) , it was pretty fun . 
  i have access to most big scientific journals through my university but i still use scihub because honestly their search engine is amazing , you can search the title or just the doi and instantly it gives you the pdf , meanwhile in my university engine if i search exactly the title of an article it shows up in 8th or 9th and i have to jump through a bunch of different pages before reaching the pdf . 
  i would honestly pay to use scihub just simply because of how practical it is . 
  i do use google scholar but it 's mostly during the start of the research when i 'm looking for general terms and topics , i tend to keep finding reviews instead of actual studies on g.scholar which is great at the start to get a general bearing of the subject . 
  but i ca n't access restricted papers even when i 'm connected to my uni 's vpn , i have to actually go through my uni 's platform to get the papers , which is why i just use scihub . 
  the worlds 2015 opening ceremony was depressing , even the [ 2013 ceremony ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39k9tnijaeg ) was more fun to watch , last year it felt like they regressed 4 years in production quality and it felt kinda disrespectful to the viewers just showing a premade video . 
  on the other hand [ msi this year ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5w45sszt-4 ) with specific region anthems and well choreographed performance was definitely an improvement and i hope that means riot is listening to the complains from last year 's worlds . 
  on a sidenote , people were already complaining that worlds lasting an entire month kinda kills the hype of the event , having such a anticlimactic opening does n't help, 
  they are already made and showed up in pbe [ ( obligatory surrender@20 link ) ] ( http://www.surrenderat20.net/p/current-pbe-balance-changes.html#worlds ) , i personally do n't like the design in general but that 's a question of taste , [ go tigers go ] ( https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-n9lcjb_p-fk/v7yb4uxr1ci/aaaaaaaatpk/l0gk3yhx-5yqfsnvdklfp6kjnrxqd1ofwclcb/s1600/profileicon1258.png ), 
  holy shit i just realized it 's corey and leon from the spill.com ( rest in peace ; _  , i never found out what happened to the gang , they were my favorite movie reviewers some years ago , i still miss the league of extremely ordinary gentlemen podcast :\\, 
  you can also extrapolate from the european statistics in general , [ this study from 2010 ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/19/5-facts-about-the-muslim-population-in-europe/ ) , points to an 1 % increase in muslim population per decade with 8 % of the european population being muslim by 2030 , this was before the boom of migration from the last couple of years which should increase drastically this numbers . 
  in the long run you also have an aging european population with more couples having less or no kids , while the opposite happens in the muslim population which is on average eight years younger ( 32 ) than the median for all europeans ( 40 ) , this will probably create a bunch of different economic and social stratification issues in the next decades like it already happens in a smaller scale in countries with high immigration like france . 
  and it was completely ruined by their last episode , i loved their arc , they had their adventures with the doctor and as much as they loved him they knew they were ready to just stop and live their normal lives again , it was a perfect ending for them ... but no ... let 's both ruin their characters and the weeping angels as villains in the same episode . 
  you are correct , but it 's probably also very hard to construct a population pyramid right now since data from muslim immigrants can be unreliable in terms of age . 
  in terms of birthrate we know [ european countries tend to have a low birthrate ( which results in our current aging population ) , while middle eastern country tend to have a much higher birthrate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_fertility_rate ) , unless migrants coming to europe change their birthrate tendencies , which might actually happen i do n't have knowledge about this , the 1 % increase should happen mostly in younger age demographics and create the stratification problems i was talking about . 
  but there 's also a bunch of other factors like average health , life expectancy and other economic factors that might influence the population increase and change the future demographics , so i guess there 's a lot of work to be done by researchers for the next decades , 
  he has 2 millions subs and all his videos have 1 + million views , just play any other game or vlog or anything , damn so much wasted money by not producing new videos o_o, 
  janna also fucks him hard if they are decent enough with q. . . or just ult him if they ca n't deny his engage with q, 
  to be fair his damage was pretty retarded , he 's even able to delete carries if he goes the titanic hydra build . 
  but i think riot should have incentivize better positioning of his sword by keeping the 7 % increased damage if it passed through an enemy , nerfing that was a bit too much in my opinion . 
  the way they handled barry 's mom is still the best thing they did in the flash tv show , i honestly cried . 
  in general the show is just another police procedural but with super powers , you ca n't expect much else from a 20 + episodes per season show , most feel repetitive and have a ton of non-consequential scenes , same with agents of shield . 
  gorrila 's twitter is 90 % photos of their cat and dog , they are freaking adorable . 
  the best most recent one its with their [ lck trophy ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cqynylbvuaa5mqb.jpg ), 
  reddit seems to have a huge aversion to non-pro league youtubers ( the skype group dilemma probably did n't help either ) , there 's a ton of league youtubers with 1 + million subs yet they almost never show up here . 
  this is n't me agreeing with just posting all their videos on the sub and let the votes decide what 's worth watching , a ton of them do really low effort daily videos , we do n't need 15 posts from 15 youtubers talking about the new zed skin . 
  like the 5 clips from rush 's stream this morning ? 
  i 'm also getting kinda sick of those, 
  holy shit , trickle down economy is a pyramid scheme [ o_o ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/2013/10/tim-and-eric-mind-blown.gif ), 
  honestly currently a sandbox mode does n't exist just because riot does n't want to relocate resources into doing it , they already have weekly alternative special game modes that change cooldowns and abilities , allow you to create minions or structures etc etc etc , the only thing missing is creating a new ui , the `` tech '' is already there , even if it was n't perfect most people would appreciate just the possibility of using it . 
  i personally do n't play them , but yes i think most are just old modes , some with a few new changes , while others were created after they implemented the weekly modes system , like the [ nexus siege ] ( http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/nexus-siege ) , which also changed the map and created special abilities and structures . 
  i loved dead like me the cast was perfect its sad it did n't have more seasons , bryan fuller 's next show pushing daisies also has the same kind of humor but with a happier more colorful atmosphere which was awesome for a show about death , i was never able to get into hannibal but he 's doing neil gaiman 's american gods and the new start trek tv show , i hope he keeps a bit of that dark humor for his new shows . 
  that detective 's hair though < _ <, 
  do you know if any of the sci-fi shows coming out around the same time as the expanse are worth watching ? 
  like the killjoys or darkmatter , i ca n't seem to find anything good , the expanse was a needle in a haystack for me, 
  i 've spent 265.5 $ since 2013 ... i stopped buying skins after i saw that number < _ < , not that much for 3 years of weekly play , but it 's still depressing, 
  you can find [ how much you spent in league here ] ( https://privacy.riotgames.com/en_us/ ), 
  meanwhile ogn spent the resulting years improving and perfecting the [ `` pro players running and doing awkward eye contact into your soul '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9h1y1gi-em&amp;index=2&amp;list=plmx9rabozt3khdxknf2xyk--vckgrvl78 ) model , i 'll give riot the documentaries production , but ogn still do the best hype intros, 
  edit : i linked a playlist guys , most of the ogn videos you are talking about are in the list < _ <, 
  the article states the overwatch tournament will run between `` oct. 7 throughout december '' the same time frame as worlds ( both doa and monte retweeted the article so we could should take it as truth ) , which makes the easy conclusion , since the tournament is in korea , that both doa and monte will not attend worlds in north america . 
  you find it reasonable to delete a 1400 + comments thread because there 's no official comment from riot or doa/monte yet to such a obvious conclusion ? 
  for most people league is just a game that they play casually with friends , watch a few competitive games when they know the teams and have free time . 
  people keep forgetting that the majority of gamers have no interest in the developer drama or other gaming scene issues , otherwise why would preorders still be a thing , why would more and more developers keep cutting up games into dlcs and season pass . 
  the vast vast majority of people playing league do n't give a shit about what riot does or the backdoor drama with pro-players and casters , and that vast vast majority is what gives riot and every other developer money . 
  i liked the `` lovecraftian 's '' leviathan as the old gods of the mass effect universe that saw themselves as above every other life form and created the catalyst , eventually creating the cycle of evolution and cleansing in that galaxy , i also enjoyed that information from previous cycles allowed the shepard cycle to finally break it , they learned from history how to adapt and improve . 
  i understand why people got pissed by our actions not having much impact in the final moment but i always saw the choice system as a way to enrich our interactions with the other characters during our journey , honestly the ending is not even the thing i disliked the most in me3 , and it did n't retroactively destroy the previous games for me , i absolutely love mass effect 2 and is still a masterpiece in my eyes ^ ^ if ^ ^ you ^ ^ play ^ ^ femshep, 
  well , he 's trying to make people follow him into watching overwatch , so he 's kinda begging for attention .
