  god b plays for germany , why the turkish flag ? 
  best knife round i 've ever seen !, 
  they thing is , g2 is already one of the orgs that pays the best , it 's less toxic than nip and ocelote seems like the best guy ever . 
  one of the best infographics i 've ever seen about a cs competition . 
  he 's not new , he has been around with cs before 1.6 , he 's kinda of a gamer . 
  i think he was le ( not saying is good or bad ) last time he i saw his stream .

  `` ugly '' is relative and since i choose that specific artwork i like it . 
  quality is the best one i 've seen for 0,99 $ , it 's around the same you pay 10 $ at photo shops to have a custom photo . 
  have a good day dude , do n't be so full of hate , 
  but just use a paysafe equivalent or something, 
  ! remindme in 2 hours, 
  let 's say i 'm a huge noob with alias/binds . 
  how can i do this ? 
  thanks man . 
  just wait until tomorrow and we 'll see . 
  i just finished a cache game and saw the same exact thing !, 
  8.5 / 10 awesome work, 
  holly cow !, 
  well , she 's `` working '' for the `` just average '' mr. sparkles ;, 
  logos are awesome ; the `` wallpapers '' could be better , but great work anyway !, 
  `` quite a while now '' ; yeah , for fucking two years lol, 
  how many times did you think you 've done it before realizing it ? 
  yeah nikkyys work is not supposed to be some kinda of coll fragmovie , it 's supposed to be a `` movie '' itself . 
  last time i queued with brazilians they werecalling each others `` filhos da puta '' all game long . 
  yes it is . 
   hometown favorites, 
  why do n't you read man ? 
  wherever a competition is , the hometown usually have a favorite team . 
  in this case you can see the crowds favorite team is by far , na'vi, 
  i mean , it 's more than time for a new operation . 
  wrong , eu = european union, 
  awesome !, 
  yeah , mcskillet told this already a couple days ago , from a pro intel . 
  dude this , this is gold !, 
  nice , way better !, 
   copenhagen wolves, 
  here you go . 
  i tried with the two versions of the logo . 
  edit : fixed the link , v1 -  http://imgur.com/fg8wx02, 
  there you go . 
  since the original logo has 3 colors , i did three different versions , http://imgur.com/a/bgfvc, 
   torqued, 
  the torqued team is now echo fox . 
  these are so good for minimalistic !, 
  a lot of teams not here tho . 
  edit : i decided doing them myself . 
  including ibuypower , ence , copenhagen wolves , lgb , ga , etc. 
  hope you actually enjoy it , http://imgur.com/a/bgfvc, 
  this is so good !, 
  should be fixed now , sorry . 
  yeah , my bad , i added it to an album so the link changed , should be good now tho . 
  this the exactly the opposite of rip, 
  no way the same person did them all . 
  ones does it , then there are 2 . 
  the 2 guys do it , then there 's 4 . 
  that why there are so many now . 
  ( btw , this one is one of the most duplicated because if 'm not mistaken this one have kato '14 stickers . ), 
  i 'm from portugal and that 's true . 
  although a lot of people do n't know that . 
  it 's not an holo . 
  try using the `` oldschool '' azubu , since the main one is a beta version . 
  it 's basically oldschool.azubu.tv / ( nameofthechannel ), 
  what a god < 3, 
   baseball bat is called `` taco de baseball '' . 
  so yeah , taco = stick , club . 
  he should have said : ( ... ) so yeah , taco = bat, 
  they should make a unique case collection . 
  it already exists for stickers . 
  at source ? 
  so it would still be possible that he was the youngest major winner when he did it , since you know , it was before all that . 
   adren is too fucking bad with rifle that it forces s1mple to switch to rifle so that adren can pick his shit up ? 
  this one . 
  not joking , it really is . 
  most of the time it was worldedit , but some times , idk the reason , s1mple would do it and he did a way better job than worldedit, 
  wrong , there was no buyout .
