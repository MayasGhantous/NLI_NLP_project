make sure to listen to the percursion and know both piano parts well by ear , i do n't know this piece very well , but i had a look at the score , and i think you can get over the 9/8 by listening to the beat that starts in measure 18 , internalise the rhythm by swallowing that first beat and going after the next eight , make it physical . 
  i discourage you from simplifying it into groups of three , i 'm very much against that type of thing that students usually advise each other to do , it might seem innocuous , but it decharacterises the music , be it 6/8 , 9/8 or 12/8 . 
  practice the attack on the octaves with 1-3 , 1-4 , and 1-5 jumps , there 's a very distinct way to do that in bartok 's music , just like in his piano sonata . 
  you might enjoy the documentary `` pianomania '' , focusing on a steinway tuner who works with performers in recordings and live shows . 
  you do get a look at that side of specially prepared pianos for each individual pianist , and the work that goes in setting them up that way . 
  on a separate note , i think such a reserve of brilliant instruments was only made possible by the insane monopoly steinway has got on classical music performances . 
  i might be wrong , but i think if you 're a pianist and go on tour using a steinway , you do sign a contract obligating you to exclusively use their pianos . 
  that 's why you mostly see performers using yamahas or steinways . 
  show preference publicly for one , and you might not be allowed to use the other . 
  funeral parlors . 
  if you can disolve a body in a vat at home , you should n't be paying thousands for slabs of wood and stone . 
  i agree with rest of the comments here , finishing is not that important when the idea of a drawing might be already evident . 
  i 'll only add that starting from the top is usually best , not only for sizing models , but it also helps with discerning what you can finish up first and add later . 
  how did you prepare beforehand ? 
  what was your final score ? 
  i did say i might be wrong , and obviously i did n't know anything about the subject . 
  you are also right with the tuner/technician subject , i did n't mean to be dismissive of the job , i probably just called him a tuner either because i have never had any contact with professional technicians like that before , or simply because in my language , or maybe just in my ordinary speech , it sounds far more pedantic to call him a technician , a title usually given to municipal workers like garbage men , than a tuner . 
  but i did recommend the documentary , which is completely focused on him , i thought the praise was implied . 
  this map pops up so many times , and yet it 's always severely incorrect . 
  it accounts for military presence as being equal to invasion , which is maybe half the countries marked red . 
  a double colour scheme making the distinction is due . 
  this does look far more legit than those maps usually lifted from wikipedia , i quite like it . 
  we can see that you went by national subdivision , it 's very evident looking at germany and the like in this map . 
  can you talk us through on how you designed it ? 
  where did you get the info ? 
  this might be an off-shot , but i think this might come close : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpyruej1miq, 
  i ca n't really put into words , but i think in the same way that fifth movement is eternally slow , that one is eternally fast , in a very similar , ecstatic way . 
  they both share a type of devotion only evident in what colour they might give out from a key , that is my take on them . 
  if you 're an avid messiaen listener , you 're bound to find the common pattern .

  with the 20th century coming around , and the opportunities to immigrate , most went to live in the us , argentina or mandatory palestine , what with all the [ pogroms ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pogrom ) and subsequent wars . 
  the nazi invasion of the soviet union murdered most of the remaining jewish population . 
  that 's the least possibly diverse answer to the most diversely answerable question possible . 
  it is not so much that it is void of emotion , but that emotion is the lowest possible value in art , that good work and proper creation should be the highest concern . 
  what i think he meant was simply that whichever your emotional output is , it 'll be different for everyone else . 
  music does n't work like poetry , it is non-descriptive , and because of that , it can also be manipulated out of context and significance .

  when people explained their own views of stravinsky 's music to the composer himself , he would often reply : `` you are right , but for all the wrong reasons . '', 
   but in the big picture there 's obviously plenty of agreement . 
  depending on which reference points , as either audience or performer you have got beforehand . 
  as an example , at school , people usually ask me to play that `` dinosaur music '' ( rite of spring ) . 
  i did n't mean that art should be without emotion , rather that art that concerns itself * only * with emotion and discards proper expression for the sake of authenticity of feeling is usually bland , and as a rule , bad art . 
  just think on much more elegantly beethoven expressed himself in comparison to his contemporaries , and on how well known he is for extreme sentiment , how in technical mastery and innovation ahead of everybody else he was . 
  in other words , your emotions in exposition are only as powerful , refined , or of any importance , as well as you can express them , through whatever means . 
  and to go one further , i think beethoven himself would think that you * could only feel * as much as you could convey . 
  yes , i think you 're right , thanks .
