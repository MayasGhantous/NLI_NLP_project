  you must n't know about the amount of people i know , and myself , that can not afford instruments of any quality . 
  needlessly destroying any one of them is a joke i ca n't take . 
  i do n't care to take offense at anything . 
  it 's just the type of thing that gets a bad response from me . 
  you begin to take these things to heart if you have to work hard to buy your instrument , to make school payments , all that stuff . 
  i 'm sorry if i 'm oversharing too much on the subject , but anyone that finds any fun in destroying good instruments probably never had to work and sacrifice practice time to buy one . 
  [ complete bach cantatas ] ( http://www.amazon.com/bach-sacred-cantatas-complete-1-199/dp/b000rzor2u/ref=pd_sim_sbs_m_1?ie=utf8&amp;refrid=04jnbgzwss80amtmjajn ), 
  imo , harnoncourt and leonhardt did a better job with the cantatas than leusink . 
  take a listen on youtube and decide which you 'd prefer . 
  god , * yes * . 
  good article , it points out the principal flaw with new orchestras around the world ; government vinculation . 
  obviously , setting up such projects can only be done with a good deal of financial help , and although in european countries government support is ideal , in these new undemocratic states classical music is an ornament for the powerful , a status symbol to demonstrate how refined and how enlightened this new wealth made these countries . 
  quality is questionable , but not in all cases . 
  gergiev is , of course , one of the best , and his orchestra is one of the oldest around , it is however painful to believe that the man who brings to life the best tchaikovsky today is the best friend of the insensible gonvernment that oppresses its citizens . 
  i have no idea about the qatar philharmonic or its artistic merits , but it 's still a project enjoyed by the tyrants of a slave-state . 
  i do believe there must be thousands in china who do not see this music as simply entertainment or a middle class commodity , and that they truly can see the art in it . 
  i hope those who have the plainest ideas about it can learn from it , and that maybe the worst that partake can capture some of the great ideals and values that good music has . 
  cool map . 
  you could add wolves , fill europe up a bit . 
  fun to think that in 1914 there was only one country between germany and japan .

  this woman had amazing power . 
  her messiaen is the sharpest and strongest , it 's impressive how much expression and precision she could get out the loudest fortissimos , and at such speed . 
  i think she understood very well the mix of violence and devotion in his music , while most simply observe the religious or ornithological aspect .

  britten really knew how to set poetry to music . 
  he really had an hear for the english language , his [ serenade ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7yds_b-nku ) shows just how much so . 
  translation , from top to bottom , left to right :, 
  ** what do communists fight for ? 
  * ample democratic liberties and their firm defense . 
  * raising the quality of life of the working classes and of the people in general . 
  * access to education and culture for the popular masses . 
  * agrarian reform , agricultural improvement and radical betterment of living conditions for the rural working population . 
  * nationalisation of the fundamental sectors of the national economy and economical development beneficial to the large working masses and the efective independence of portugal . 
  * continued decolonisation to full independence . 
  * a true politic of national independence , a policy of peace and friendship to all peoples . 
  * building a new democratic state in service to the people and homeland . 
  goddamned , that one really hurt .

  i think webern , much like schubert , could with limited resources and well judged simplicity create incredible tension . 
  as for the twelve-tone vs. atonal distinction , i ca n't see your point of view . 
  schoenberg 's piano concerto is very close to a classical concerto , and it is structured by a tone row . 
  you can just search imslp.org , they have a lot of good quality scans , you can just print those yourself .

  alkan was actually very well known as promising young prodigy . 
  he was very well known in paris , but after his youth he became a recluse and refused public appearances . 
  the french never actually forgave him for being one of the greatest living pianists ( a french one at that ) , and not sharing that and being publicised as that . 
  after his death most , out of ignorance or derision , simply asked , `` who is alkan ? 
  brahms really knew how to dish out some burns . 
  he moved between the elite of the time quite well , the same as chopin , but did eventually become more of a confined studious man with age . 
  after the death of chopin he inherited most of his students , making a living out of teaching . 
  he absconded to a very deep study of the bible and other matters , only resurfacing late in life to give some concerts of his works , but his personality was n't agreable to the salon life .

  for anyone who cares , here 's [ a documentary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ninha6tqgqm ) on her that might give some insight on her composing intentions . 
  the mastery in those compositions is just that , not overt sadness , but subversive anger and revolt .

  i think it was a mix of historical legitimacy , giving back some of the old commonwealth , and having a polish majority in some very far apart cities , like lemberg to the south and up to the baltic . 
  great as always , thank you .

  the [ ave maria ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5kf_rolatu#t=4920 ) in poulenc 's dialogue des carmelites . 
  that bach performance is n't bad , but the swiss accent warps it a bit . 
  rosseau was a composer , but a terrible one at that , focusing way too much on the logical mechanisms in art , which rameau did account for , but exposed much more elegantly . 
  rosseau , besides inventing a musical notation form that would pretty much reduce scores to guitar tabs , also disliked rameau 's music , except plat\u00e9e , which is imo probably his best work . 
  that 's a chop-job of the whole work , using just some highlights . 
  [ here 's the full version . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=splhkp0nzii ) . 
  that also correlates to horrible danger of considering those composers as divine messangers , while forgetting that they were real people , and very off-balanced complicated people at that . 
  to use the same christian correlation , christ was also a person , and that is usually not underlined . 
  tell that to yuja wang . 
  it 's very important to keep appearances and play your looks to the audience , even if you 're not a stunner . 
  this harpsichordist tries too hard , and gives himself up by talking about it . 
  that just-out-of-bed look is hard work for him , keeping his hair that way and trimming his beard just right . 
  [ scott ross ] ( http://www.bach-cantatas.com/pic-bio-big/ross-scott-01.jpg ) looked like a bum , but he was way more stylish . 
  however you care to see it , style is also substance , and performers like glenn gould would n't have the same impact as they did , or have today , if they were ugly , or unkempt . 
  i might be wrong , but this was the first piece he wrote in america .

  surprisingly cool . 
  not to attack the compositional value itself here , but i 'm under the impression that most of this music , reich 's in particular , somehow impose the scenery and grief upon you , which i think is a very crass way to do it . 
  to deal with tragedies so close to home and so recent at the time of these compositions is a hard thing to transpose to music , but maybe that 's just what annoys me , that a cinematic and invasive artistic experience needs to be made . 
  classier composers do it differently , do n't they ? 
  when mozart 's father died he wrote stuff like the [ romance ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2okl6wsdfle ) in nachtmusik . 
  the march in chopin 's second sonata is an introspection , with very light sections in between , not a dramatic rendering of death and the dying , but a meditation on those subjects . 
  to me , music , as well as grief and other thoughts , are about intimacy , which can be experienced in a communal enviornment , as they tend to be with tragedies and musical concerts , but to extrapolate grief into misery is unnecessary . 
  art should be about evidence and not imposition , never sentiment for sentimentality 's sake .
