  thank you , i did n't know that mozart snippet , i agree with it . 
  the documentary-composition aspect is a great way to put it , maybe it is that dual-fuction that makes me aprehensive , it might also be that the subject matter is detached from my own experiences , and so , less available to me . 
  personally speaking , composers like reich and adams i find boring , in the same vein of minimalism , repetition and intensity , i prefer the music of [ ustvolskaya ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttqnm6u8yy ) , which i connect better with my first point . 
  it might just come down to me not being an american and not relating to that wave of composers and their work , much like books by phillip roth are about experiences too particular to the us , or we might just leave it as a matter of taste .

  reminds me of chopin 's [ nocturne in f major ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lin5ua0lsam ) . 
  it 's nothing to worry , with improvisation you 're always going to fall into familiar patterns . 
  the worse that can happen is if you actually take too much time composing something that is all too recognisable . 
  i do n't understand how you 're being downvoted , you make a perfectly good point . 
  i did n't get to enjoy bach 's passion music before i had a good listen to his cantatas . 
  however similar in form , to the uninitiated , orchestral and chamber music have a different power . 
  what exactly happened with yundi li ? 
  i 've never heard of this . 
  [ the 22nd ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omdkpkys60s ) , because to me it is like distilled beethoven . 
  the third interval relation in a short theme , the variations , the instrumental writing and surprise , and most of all , rhythm , which is his greatest strenght . 
  the tempo is brilliantly pushed around in the first movement , and the second is incredible in proportion . 
  i do n't think beethoven ever really gets overtaken with emotion , however his character was . 
  in all sonatas the construct is always far more imposing than the sentiment , which is not to say that it is n't there . 
  it 's definitely his final gift for the piano , but it 's also funny how his actual final work is much more [ snarky ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ie9gt1eksq8 ) . 
  i should have said final gift for the sonata form , you 're right . 
  use a bench , not a swivel-chair , and cut the reverb . 
  let them put some reich on , and let everybody stress out . 
  great video !, 
  he 's since mellowed out a bit , i think , but he 's a great conductor .

  that 's pretty much what bebop is all about . 
  if you 've been playing for 12 years and are n't familiar with good piano music do n't expect people to believe you 're a good player . 
  besides that , midis are a terrible way to learn pieces , you should try proper sheet music . 
  i know it 's fun to hear how gould goes to town on the keyboard , and it 's a fresh take usually , but by god , this really is n't what beethoven wrote , nor something he would condone . 
  i think beethoven had rhythm as his priority and gould totally ignores the beat every time he plays him . 
  i 'll just have to wait for what the concert hall puts on the playbill , because recording devices have n't been invented yet . 
  you 're becoming a great challenger to allofbach.com in completing the catalogue !, 
  great work , thanks again . 
  well , after your own edit , i would arrange a staging of the st. matthew passion . 
  beethoven had access to a huge library of music , i find it hard to believe he did n't come across it sometime or other . 
  he knew the goldberg variations and the well-tempered clavier at a time when nobody did , there 's a good chance he had seen a copy of the work in some collectors library , or in archduke rudolf 's . 
  no problem , thanks !,

  just a thought , but there are performers way worse in the choreography department than lang lang . 
  i think if he were n't manchu he would n't get half the rep he 's given . 
  mitsuko uchida is just as expressive in the face as he is , but with a different repertoire . 
  i think there are more subtleties to the aspect of a performer than just facial expression . 
  [ richter ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bki9l4njz4 ) was also very stiff , and he played in almost darkness , but when you watch footage of him you can tell he was not boring at all , and that he commanded such power once he sat at the keyboard . 
  or maybe it 's just that uchida has a look of class about her , while lang lang has a really weird , round and bug-eyed face . 
  what i meant earlier was that maybe it is easier to tolerate these things if the performer is fairer . 
  david fray is just as much of a young pianist , and does the same frowns and smiles as lang lang when playing , but he 's way more handsome , so i 've never heard anybody calling him up on that . 
  this is pretty much the equivalent of going on / r/guitar and posting `` hey , here 's smoke on the water , for all you who like known riffs and extremely popular music . '', 
  just saying . 
  six more years of [ beethoven ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohly6leixzu ) sound fine to me .

  there are a lot of bach arias which you could sing only with the cello playing as the continuo , like [ \u00d6ffne dich ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q48wcg45eyw#t=617 ) .

  just a note , in my school there are bunch of people with music related tattoos , and some have come to regret it , mainly because they look very tacky , and every singer and their mother has a g clef on their wrist , every bassist an f clef . 
  if out of love of shostakovich you wish to go fully crass with it , i suggest this [ lovely symbol ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b4/fc_zenit_logo.png ) . 
  sviatoslav richter in prague . 
  relativism is voided the moment you assert some objectives in comparing any two pieces of art . 
  what is it exactly that puts one composition over another ? 
  if you take into account harmonic development , melodic ability , overall structure and innovation , then things become clear . 
  however , the distinction between classical and pop is very unnecessary , they serve different purposes . 
  i think the great virtue of good pop music is to write songs , simple as they may be . 
  what you know as jazz standards used to be the days ' pop tunes . 
  that pop vein distilled itself into the most commercially effective type of music , but there is still a lot of good bands and artists writing great stuff in the medium . 
  i 'll defend people like noel gallagher , who i think is one of the greatest songwriters ever . 
  the amount of work and intelect that goes into it . 
  some music is very nice , and very harmonically simple , but you should take into account if that was out of purpose or accidental . 
  andrew wk chose to make rock music , but he 's a fantastic pianist , i accept that whatever he does musically is intentional . 
  obviously , some masterpieces have been dished out very quickly , like hindemith 's trauermusik , but that came from a mind developed , and from somebody with a clear style and purpose , after years and years of practice and work . 
  it 's easier to compare these notions with literature , in which the same types of storyline have been used for thousands of years , but we take as the greats those that are ingenious with language and rhythm , and forget easily those who only write cheap entertainment . 
  for someone who said that they would not debate anybody here and cared just for their opinion , i 'm under the impression you only set up a bait to talk about your notions of god . 
   there is only one divine or one `` god '' which is understood in different ways by different people . 
  are you serious ? 
  you are n't taking into account the millions of people that have existed without a notion of a personal god . 
  moreover , people develop and experience existance in their own terms , even with a religious education i can extrapolate my own ideas about whether god serves me , cares for me , or does n't exist at all . 
  your point about how art 's purpose and origin is divine glory is not a very old idea as that . 
  the greeks believed their own genius was a seperate being besides them , and that some had greater geniuses than others , but they did n't believe that there was an allah that inspired them . 
  sure , milton might not have written paradise lost if he were an absolute atheist , but verdi was , and he wrote his requiem . 
  i can as easily claim that any that does n't know about the intrincacies of music theory and composition are less suited to fully appreciate bach or whomever , and that enjoying other pop music best is simply a lack of experience . 
  i do , however , believe that simply attributing value out of intuition or religious affiliation as you did in the comments above is an ignorant and simplistic attitude . 
  you still have n't answered / u/scrumptiouscakes questions , and i do n't think you can , you deflect the topic whenever people ask you things directly , as i can see from your comment history . 
  nobody here invoked god as a notion involved in music , yet you keep pushing it and claiming you have a superior involvement with it simply because of your own beliefs . 
  relativistic ideas should be a tool to get closer to an agreeing objective , not to reject things for an agenda . 
  you should relativise notions to help you discern what is essential in a philosophical object . 
  so far your argument has been that god heightens , and is a necessary element for aesthetical experiences , but if i take that first point as false or unprovable ( as you have yet to prove it ) no other statement you make holds . 
  like i said , it 's more likely the lack of technical knowledge that is a deficiency than lack of faith . 
  * deficiency * , a word i 'm quoting from you , because i do n't think anyone can have any deficiencies concerning simple enjoyment of music , unless , of course , you 're a dancer and ca n't tell your 2s from your 4s . 
  it 's a word you chose to use to imply that those who do not take god into play are as deficient as if they were blind . 
  in [ this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/2gdy0a/taoism_and_nonstandard_sexualities ) you bash homosexuality , basing your reasoning on eastern alchemy , so i guess you 're into that sort of stuff , which is fine , but clearly not in any way related to the christian god of all the composers you mentioned . 
  you simply set up these baiting topics to advertise your moral code , which apparently is anywhere near zen , taoism , buddhism or christianism . 
  for further reference i think you should read [ this chart ] ( http://i.4cdn.org/pol/1378753471679.jpg ) . 
  for my further notice , i 've got you tagged as `` spiritual mong . '', 
  cage i absolutely detest as a musician , as a conceptual artist i admire . 
  i did n't disparage the minimalists , i made the case that they too worked hard and learned the art beferohand , their whole ideology of work is valid , even if you like or dislike them . 
  as for team efforts , they are n't to be undermined , the whole conception of a film is a joint effort , or a tv show , many are of great value , but then again , most people writing the infective song hits nowadays are the gradutes of top music colleges trying to make money , they are very well aware of how to do it , they know jazz and classical music well , but what functions as a great piece of pop music has a different meaning compared to art music . 
  i ca n't really see how any of what i said before contradicts what you ask .
