  my problem with cage is that he devoloped a system of ideas dozens of people had before him but did n't care to use them , fair enough , but others , like boulez , who are actual musical masters , developed systems dealing only with musical or mathmatical notions , and did it better , but that is a topic for a whole other thread , this one is poisonous as it is . 
  so , the only requirement of music to you is to be enjoyable ? 
  i 'm sure you 're the type of guy that goes to a modern art musuem and talks about how you could have painted everything youself , but then again , i do n't think you go places like that . 
  late-schoenberg made ugly music ? 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuaq3itdau0 ) has a lot to do with the concertos of mozart or beethoven . 
  there 's absolutely nothing transgressive with that piece , it follows an ordinate system , and is written in a conventional form , it does n't use instruments foreign to classical tradition . 
  you 're probably a shit pianist if you ca n't see any merits with that or the works of boulez . 
  if all that you care about is pretty music , how can you defend shostakovich in cases like [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaixsgldado ) ? 
  he in particular loved ustvolskaya 's music , he believed it had something extraordinary about it , and so do i , and having played it myself i would never call it ugly music . 
  do n't harass people and talk crap about what they enjoy . 
  people can only enjoy new things if they have the reference points from which to progress foward , but of course you never did . 
  beautifully put !, 
  you should try [ / lit / ] ( http://boards.4chan.org/lit/ ) , where people are actually demeaning to one another , put proper discussion takes place . 
  reddit does n't actually reward being mean , but rewards popular opinion and being nice for it 's own sake . 
  4chan does n't reward anything to anybody , so if you care to have a proper argument over books it might as well be there . 
  i 've always thought it as the canons being the first of a cell of three , as the aria stands in place of a canon , and is followed by two variations . 
  i also only make the repeats on one of the variations in each cell , as some of the variations i find do n't need the repeat , and others do . 
  the quolibet i hate so much . 
  it 's a joke , a great joke to be true , but for me , the variations would end so much more gracefully if that 29th brilliant turn , ending in that strong free hand hitting of the g major chord , were to be followed by the aria . 
  i do n't think any of the comments here adressed it , but it 's probably no medical condition , i reckon . 
  do you hear it all the time ? 
  or only when you are quietly by yourself , like when you 're lying down trying to sleep ? 
  if it 's the latter case , it 's simply your nervous system , its nothing more than the electric impulse running through you . 
  in this case you can probably hear a lower frequence flowing also , that would be your blood stream . 
  paris from 1848-1871 was a repressive mess of opulence , corruption , reactionary and authoritarian policies . 
  france was brought into catastrophy by napoleon iii , and into further disaray during those first years of the third republic , up to the tragedy of the first world war , when rampant hysteria and ultra-catholicism became fashionable again . 
  most of the art we now value as the stepping stones to modernity were repressed or rejected by society at large . 
  the painters at the banks of the seine were often harrassed by the police , debussy only survived and made himself a composer because of a very wealthy russian lady that he soon felt very smothered by . 
  i like those composers too , but i 've learned not to glamourise the times , they were never as great as any imagine them to be . 
  great things were done , in awful days . 
  what most nowadays consider to be modernist crap , or `` art for art 's sake '' will probably just as much of an idealised scene in the future , as the * fin-de-si\u00e8cle * parisians are to us now . 
  up to the second world war there was no distinction between austria and germany , as there was no single german state , nationality was usually a question of language . 
  mozart was born in the german archbishopric of salzburg , that only became a part of austria after his death , he was unarguably german . 
  good choice of tune , either way . 
  gift exchanges usually work best when you 've got a short spending cap . 
  although this is a very nice idea , proper literature is very expensive , and most of what is n't affected by copyright you can get in imslp.org . 
  a fast food class by liz lemon would be great , with a plotline where she infuriates the school by asserting the superiority of sabor de soledad over let 's . 
  well , he was french . 
  is it the prelude to [ lohengrin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqk4bcnbqls ) ? 
  no problem . 
  [ \u10da ( \u2579 \u25e1 \u2579 \u10da ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4cdd2w5e0i ), 
  you are obviously not well and should seek a proper medical diagnosis , i do n't think a simple musician 's perspective is due when a doctor 's is necessary . 
  i 'm not going to guess about what exactly your condition might be , and i discourage anybody else to do so . 
  please go see a physician , and eat something substantial , not just medicine with peanut butter . 
  i hope you get better and continue to play . 
  a thousand times , yes !, 
  thank you so much for taking the time to write this . 
  i 'll add that gilbert and sullivan operas are from the few good large vocal works in english , and they did it so wonderfully . 
  [ mache dich , mein herze rein ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdnwo9-4eq4#t=9454 ) is so much better . 
  erbame dich sounds like a cheap operatic trick in the middle of the work , but all the arias are placed better in their full context . 
  compared to most other literature made for the same purpose , those early volumes are streets ahead . 
  [ penderecki 's threnody for the victims of hiroshima ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp3blfzwjna ), 
  i 've had you tagged as `` cool dude '' for a while because i 've always enjoyed your comments , i 'm sad you wo n't be around any longer . 
  this might be a depiction of solomon the elephant , a present from king john iii to the archduke maximillian . 
  it was probably at the time the only elephant in europe . 
  for the rhythmic quality you might enjoy messiaen , who has moments like [ these ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sdy1kepfdi#t=256 ) . 
  he also covers the brass part . 
  i find that metalheads usually transition well into classical music , so there 's a lot of stuff you can find agreable . 
  for vocal music i do n't know anything so gutural as your examples in the repertoire , but maybe aesthetically you 'll find something interesting in works like bach 's [ johannespassion ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwy3sty0ed8 ) , whose opening chorus is often described as `` nails to a cross '' , or much of his other vocal and sacred works , which are filled with [ narrative ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7ut6mgnnqg ) and subversion , or just straight [ loud festive riffing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9mwn4g2lis ) , qualities , as far as i know , commonplace in metal music . 
  should n't he be struggling with consumption ? 
  there is no single interesting american composer outside jazz . 
  if by instrumentation you find similarities , then the piano sonata has been the same for two-hundred years . 
  two violas , cellos and a continuo keyboard , just [ as close ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv4t7lo8zle ) . 
  please do n't misjudge me , what i meant was simply that the classical medium evolved using the very same instrumentation and breath , you ca n't judge innovation by a string but by character . 
  fingers do n't actually have muscles , your tendon flexibility is more important than wrist movement for trills , actually moving the wrist sideways while playing is very discomforting for me . 
  you 're also correct in saying that trills should be played stylistically , not for speed . 
  for older composers like bach i think 2323 is best , while for the romantics 1313 works best . 
  all things considered everybody should decide on what works best for them , if the lower note is a black key i have no trouble using 3434 or 4545 , depending on what i 'm playing , but it serves me much better than 1313 or god forbid , 1212 . 
  pretty much , that soprano solo in the first movement is so much better than any part of the requiem . 
  great choice , but i wonder what effeminate music might be . 
  it 's boggling how he could churn out pieces like that so fast , stuff like the 27th symphony , which is n't really much more than light chamber music , but fresh and light . 
  by definition , christ can not be christian , only his followers . 
  i do n't think there are overrated composers , only overplayed ones . 
  nowadays you do have a much more varied repertoire , yet every piano student insists on doing their first recital with a rachmaninoff sonata or some chopin nocturne . 
  that piano is a monster , maybe it 's just that it 's being recorded up close , but damn , you could hear that the next town over . 
  it 's the [ norse song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im_t8o3jltq#t=4178 ) from schumann 's album for the young . 
  [ relevant . 
  ] ( http://c0389161.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/dyn/str_strip/238736.full.gif ), 
  i think if you have the stretch you could make a nice arrangement out of shostakovich 's [ prelude in d major . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3vq3fdj5yi ), 
  i enjoy [ fux 's chaconne in d ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rlyw0elrw4 ), 
  the definition `` drunkest '' is n't apposite . 
  in european countries , median alcohol consumption values mostly come from the cultural custom of enjoying a beer in the afternoon after work or wine at dinner , not so much related to binge drinking phenomenons . 
  when i was fourteen i went to see evgeny kissin play chopin 's concerto no. 2 . 
  after he did two encores and the orchestra resumed the final part of the show , he came up from the side and sat at the seat next to me to see the performance . 
  his hair really is that curly . 
  [ here .

  louis xv . 
  i think nowadays he 's probably best known for being totally bonkers . 
  but his music is pretty great . 
  santos was probably the only composer to ever survive getting hit by a car 14 times . 
  yep . 
  bruno monsaingeon has been making documentaries on several performers for last decades , they 're well worth a watch . 
  here 's the [ sviatoslav richter one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfjvpji3wjm ) . 
  it 's really interesting how he extrapolated stuff like that from simple dances . 
  the st. matthew passion is , recitatives and choruses omitted , a huge dance suite . 
  i also enjoy how well bach 's music is versatile to the point of being perfectly sufficient to the barest number of musicians , or the largest ensemble . 
  here 's [ the same sarabande with single players ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eu0z1qlwnw&amp;t=9341 ) . 
  [ shostakovich 's first .
