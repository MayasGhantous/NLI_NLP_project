  well , classical era composers got shitfaced all the time and had very active sex lives , i reckon , so i ca n't imagine this quote being much more than a lame way to make alcohol intolerance or social ineptitude justifiable . 
  the point about kafka 's writing is that his characters are a just as much to blame for their circumstances , whatever the unjustifiable reason they are first put into them . 
  beethoven , then . 
  grew up in an oppressive household and got beaten up by his dad , became a brilliant musician and enjoyed success , decided he was totally the greatest composer , had this crazy middle period where his music is all in your face , got deaf , wrote the most innovative works possible at such a time that most people still are n't into them , died miserably . 
  yeah , beethoven . 
  if i say that your comment is four paragraphs of you criticising things that have nothing to with your original point , do i have to reply in four repetitions myself ? 
  if your problem is to do with beethoven , you should express exactly what you think is wrong with him to make an argument . 
  if you ca n't express it , it is because you do n't know the works or ca n't understand them . 
  why are spain and portugal marked as axis alligned ? 
  the [ prelude to the third act ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nscqj0gj1k8 ) of the same opera . 
  wagner is n't a composer you should search for brevity in , rather take an afternoon off to take the whole opera in one listen . 
  of psalms, 
  italian, 
  ravel in f, 
  swan lake, 
  the list is missing opera . 
  [ the 4th movement in schnittke 's string quartet ? 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/qs8mpgqoltu?t=897 ) . 
  [ shchedrin 's 3rd piano concerto . ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssjjydzu6b8 ) . 
  he actually hides the original theme in the end , it 's barely audible under the orchestra . 
  there are torrents around of most of his piano music , up to a point , but he 's a living composer . 
  if you can buy the actual books they are easy to find online . 
  cpe bach was also an incredibly agressive composer for the time , the cello and viola da gamba music he wrote was streets ahead . 
  of bach 's sons he probably was the closest to beethoven . 
  johann christian was probably the closest in sound to the age . 
  i guess it 's the same kreisleriana , but one 's a lp , cd 's have longer record capacities , they added kinderszenen and the tocatta . 
  copenhaga , no ca\u00eds do sodr\u00e9 . 
  [ cpe bach 's sonatas ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll-k-tlyjyq ) , but i do n't think they would be much good for the violin . 
  my guesses :, 
  n\u00ba 2 - probably brahms ? 
  n\u00ba 3 - messiaen - liturgies, 
  n\u00ba 7 - probably glass ? 
  having piano as an instrument made it easier to figure out the concertos , i 've actually played the schoenberg to myself . 
  ligeti 's was also easy , i 've never seen the score , but that piano writing was very easy to recognise rhythmically . 
  i also love oratorios and vocal music and make an effort to memorise the vocal parts , great choice putting haydn up there . 
  bwv 82 sounds wonderful for the alto , thanks . 
  it 's definitely not very pratically written , but i 've found it not very hard to memorise . 
  i 'll look forward to the next round . 
  yes , well spotted . 
  * they chattered like swallows * and the third of webern 's variations . 
  actually boulez 's first sonata , and yes ustvolskaya 's fifth sonata , nice one , i thought it would take longer for someone to get it !, 
  and yeah , ad\u00e8s is right !, 
  close , but it 's the first concert etude !, 
  you still earn the point . 
  whoa , first three we 're spot on !, 
  well done !, 
  kapustin was the concert etude . 
  yes , no. 8 !, 
  correct !, 
  right again !, 
  postludium and partita bwv 828 . 
  a bit of a curveball from me , i admit . 
  yes it is !, 
  spot on !, 
  it 's feldman 's * piano * . 
  both correct !, 
  well done . 
  yes , good catch !, 
  right you are !, 
  well done !, 
  nope , schoenberg 's piano suite . 
  thanks !, 
  glad to hear it , 
  [ check these out . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmnjjhu2s-k ), 
  i also enjoy his books , i 've tried finding recordings of his works , which are n't few , but they 're very scarce . 
  here 's [ manchester overture ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5jo-4aloay ) , a bit * ravelian * . 
  as a composer he 's not * that great * , but an amazing one if you take it that he just did it on the side , and was n't part of the musical establishment , nor had the resources to dedicate himself solely to it . 
  the orchestration is rather decent . 
  maybe you mean battle of leningrad ? 
  if so it 's probably [ shostakovich 's symphony no. 7 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hon-9z1greo ) . 
  on what makes a piece great or not is subject to all kinds of debate , to me personally it 's * form * , over * character * . 
  i detest composers that focus on wanton passions and snuff romanticism . 
  the ability to control , and compose ; to develop and organise themes in whatever mediums , orchestras , solo instruments , etc. 
  ; that 's usually very denouncing of the quality of any given piece . 
  i have my difficulties with shostakovich precisely because of this , but the theme that he uses starting at 6:45 is definitely * engaging * . 
  it 's hard for me to compare anything without being unfair , but to relate two pieces not very far away in time , take vivaldi 's concertos , like any of [ these ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogk-ol8hgci ) , bombastic entrances with catchy tunes , but they go absolutely nowhere . 
  compare it to any of bach 's chamber music , which uses pretty much the same instrumentation , composed more or less at the same time as vivaldi 's music , like the any of [ brandenburg concertos ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v7oujd9djk ) . 
  you can hear a world of difference . 
  for something a bit more modern , i 'm not against american minimalist tendencies , works like [ this bit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlevr7i5psg ) by adams are fun , but i 'm never sorry to stop listening to any of it ; to compare it to something as repetitive , but far more inventive and fun , i 'd much rather listen to stuff like ad\u00e8s ' [ asyla ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dupkwrm-ziy ) . 
  it 's the difference between risk and commodity , to my ears . 
  polish doens ' t use the cyrilic alphabet , and it 's to russian about as much as portuguese is to french ... 
  poland was occupied by russia , if that 's what you mean . 
  i was just pointing out a gross generalisation made similar to the ones about portugal and spain . 
  thing is , this type of misnomers and broad but wrong understanding of two close together cultures is always going to happen if these cultures happen to be two countries as old as most european nations with a history of war and enmity , or control and submission as these are . 
  lars von trier 's [ melancholia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzd0u841lrm ) uses nothing but the prelude to tristan . 
  also by his , the idiots has a melodica playing saint-s\u00e4ens * the swan * off camera very often . 
  [ caligula ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16otlxl5e0c ) has prokofiev 's * dance of the knights * and khachaturian 's * spartacus * as main themes . 
  many kubrick films make extensive use of classical tunes , [ barry lyndon ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mponjrm5dly ) has handel 's sarabande ; [ eyes wide shut ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dexkpnbo7i ) has ligeti 's * musica ricercata * and shostakovich 's waltz no. 2 from the * jazz suite * . 
  it 's probably incidental music composed for the documentary , as it usually is with the bbc . 
  [ auto-retrato , degas ] ( http://museu.gulbenkian.pt/museu/en/collection/painting/piece?a=496 ) , \u00e0 sa\u00edda da colec\u00e7\u00e3o de pintura da gulbenkian . 
  yes , this one is a portrait by gainsborough . 
  the inaugural performer [ played just so ] ( https://youtu.be/fuwsbjt8xji?t=47 ) , not as slurred as most , you can almost hear . 
  ravel was also one to indicate very clearly to pianists how his music should be played , i can imagine that was a detail he pointed out himself . 
  [ it also works backwards . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/sd3hvhnd7yu?t=3165 ), 
  he was wrong , though . 
  [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjct5m8jzl4 ) makes proof of that . 
  he should credit where [ he 's drawing it from ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xlbow6wls0 ) ... very nice either way .
