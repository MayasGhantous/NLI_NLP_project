  \\  they have already felt all those new exciting feelings before , and are usually jaded and bitter, 
  \\  you missed what it feels like to have not a care in the world other than making your girl happy, 
  \\  you have missed out on teenage love, 
  it 's high school and confidence . 
  example : mine . 
  when i was 15/16 , i was a much more confident person than i am now at 21 . 
  i had a few female friends , i was good friends with them , i had confidence , i would flirt with them , hug them , whatever , i actually got a girlfriend because of that , i was confident enough , that as a `` i 'm cool '' attempt , i went to the classroom of my friends and just stood there , while the teacher ( which was also one of mine , and knew me ) asked me questions , that girl in that day talked to me , she was interested and i got a girlfriend , she dumped me later , and all that confidence was lost , and now i 'm alone at 21 , since . 
  confidence is key , and i 'm not very good looking . 
  i 'm tall though . 
  because you 're worth it ? 
  seriously , i 'm white as fuck , with a jew nose and curly hair , i do n't even know what 's going on . 
  also i 'm 6 ' 4 '' , and skinny as fuck . 
  from what i 've been reading around , people say todd looks like he has down syndrome , while joffrey just acts like an asshole . 
  two different things . 
  one is the physical appearance of a person , the other is the personality of a tv show/book character . 
  it is freedom 's . 
  portuguese here , went to family doctor and said , `` doc , i ca n't breathe . 
  '' , he said `` okey , let 's do some exams . 
  '' , i 'm going to have a surgery in a few months . 
  i then said , `` doc , i have pain in my knees . 
  '' , he said `` take this calcium . 
  '' , i then said , `` doc , i have pain in the right side of my jaw , and pops and locks . 
  '' , he said `` okey , let 's do some exams . '' . 
  for free . 
  ^ a ^ new ^ way ^ of ^ living,

  i read somewhere that he started calling the horse a lot of times , so the interns could have a credit in the end of the show and get paid . 
  good guy craig ferguson . 
  skrill , it 's the old moneybookers . 
  was that a pain in the ass ? 
  because it 's normal procedure for any company to verify your account . 
  from moneybookers to paypal to paxum , they all ask for that . 
  yesterday a friend of mine had his account limited , in the same day he unlimited it by sending the documents . 
  that 's a normal procedure used by a lot of online currency companies . 
  western union just does n't care . 
  wu is used a lot by scammers , paypal is n't due to chargebacks and that anti-money laundering law . 
  wu is like liberty reserve , except with physical stores . 
  i do n't have a chin , jokes on you . 
  how the fuck, 
  do i, 
  that wow, 
  so gifstop, 
  this is made by a friend of a friend of mine . 
  that 's not actually a comercial , it 's a short movie , and that short movie was used for a video clip of a song .

  i have ocd , and from i have been reading until now , i will never touch any psychedelic due to the fear of getting an even worse ocd . 
  all these studies contradict themselves , so until a study comes out 100 % correct i will never touch any fucking drug . 
  op , can you tell me what was the surgery about ? 
  i 'm about to have a nose surgery and i 'm fucking nervous , it 's my first surgery . 
  i wish i was as awesome as that dude .

  you are doing a movie ? 
  about what ? 
  are you the writer ? 
  after , i think , 1960 , deaths started to be very rare , they have better electronics , better helmets , suits , and motogp is fucking awesome . 
  ** who are you ? 
  well , i 'm not tipman . 
  ** bieber does what bieber wants **, 
  quickly cast ddl in every possible role . 
  ben affleck is cool and i 'm looking forward to see him as the new batman . 
  i do n't even know why i watched this until the end . 
  my three favourite actors are ben , affleck and batman . 
  i drive, 
  that shit sounds like a modem trying to connect to the internet . 
  dubstep is shit . 
  i have a good jawline from what i have been told , but i have no chin , so it sucks , because the jawline only shows if i lift my head up , due to not having a chin , the skin is not as stretched . 
  i 'm 21 , and people say i look a lot younger , i 'm thinking it 's mostly because of the jaw/chin . 
  ben affleck writing , he should also direct that shit . 
  i just watched the town , so fuck yeah , i 'm going to pay to see that shit on the cinema . 
  it would be like a mini-series . 
  imagine a mini-series with ben affleck and snyder directing . 
  i finished the town a couple of hours ago , it was a really good film . 
  ben affleck audition tape ,, 
  `` i 'm batman , son ! '', 
  well , you 're hired . 
  i like ben affleck , i finished the town a couple of hours ago , and i 'm forward to see bat affleck in the screen . 
  ** i 'm superbat **, 
  that 's what i said . 
  how the fuck did i knew this subconsciously , but could n't put it into words consciously ? 
  i would probably just say `` that 's looks fucking nice . 
  '' , but i would never know how to explain why does it look good , while knowing why it looks good . 
  thanks op . 
  i 've just learned about the rule of thirds , can you give me an example on how and why you should break ? 
  well , i 've done things already . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ * nice *, 
  it 's my favourite movie from 2013 along with mud . 
  it is a great movie , maybe you did n't like it . 
  / tv / is cool . 
  in the us . 
  imagine now porting tesla to europe . 
  a subaru brz here costs 60000 $ , in the us costs 25000 $ . 
  i imagine the price of a tesla model-s being 70000 $ in the us and the double in europe . 
  i 'm 21 aswell , but i like being alone , i 'm not lonely , but i fucking enjoy being alone .
