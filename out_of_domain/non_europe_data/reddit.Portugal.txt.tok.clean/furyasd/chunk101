  portuguese government could n't care less about cinema . 
  they already cut cinema findings by like 80 % so they do n't really care . 
  sic and tvi already said they are cutting their fundings aswell . 
  in a few years , when i get to do an indie and win something at sundance , or atleast recognition , the first thing i 'm to say is that portugal did n't help me in anything to acomplish the making of a movie . 
  cold opening is when they start with action instead of the credits . 
  master . 
  whatis . 
  going . 
  i enjoyed final fantasy viii and final fantasy x. 
  i never played final fantasy xi , but i 've played wow for about 4 years . 
  will i enjoy final fantasy xiv ? 
  i really want to play final fantasy and a mmorpg . 
  if you want to gift me your game , since you are not going to play , i 'd be more than happy to play it . 
  i do n't know if there is a trial to test the game , and i currently do n't have the money to buy 50 $ worth of games . 
  ^ i 'm ^ kidding , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ or ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ not . 
  not having a trial for 7 or 15 days like wow , makes me not wanting to pay the money to try to see if i like the game . 
  i love final fantasy , but 50 $ at the moment is too much . 
  but is he really a coke head or are you just saying he is a coke head ? 
  the guy is just fucking socially awkward and has a lot of anxiety . 
  just because he banters on an on about something he did does n't mean he is a coke head . 
  he may have some kind of aspergers and anxiety . 
  yet , i do n't doubt about the coke , but i kinda like his movies , so i do n't care . 
  i have a question , but i 'm afraid i 'm going to sound like a fool , because i know nothing about color or cinematography or key or anything , despite wanting to study film , but in the last still it says `` deakins uses white diffuse light . 
  '' , but how does he really use it ? 
  is n't just post-production stuff ? 
  how did he use the light in that setting ? 
  sorry if it 's a dumb question , i really do n't know how he does it .

  i 've been playing games since i 'm like 4 or 5 years old . 
  i started with master system with sonic , i then went to playstation 1 , playstation 2 , game boy color/advance sp , and pc . 
  i think i was 9 or 10 when i played max payne . 
  i 'm a pacifist . 
  i think there 's more to it than the normal argument of `` kids will kill someone like they do on video games . 
  '' , there might be some psychological problems for kids to do that . 
  and fuck you , my parents love me and they always trusted me and were/are always confident that i was responsible . 
  the turn out fine part it 's not be taken literally , we just did n't killed people on a drive-by or crashed a car into people , which is the main argument about video games . 
  thanks the explanation . 
  i just wanted to know if it was all natural with post-production for that foggy / dawn effect , because i saw a clip of post-production about skyfall , and i think that shot was added a filter to look like that , and that the actual shot was a very clear sunny day . 
  but what do i know ? 
  thanks . 
  the real question is , was she showing any cleavage ? 
  people are polite of course , but it 's a long hours job that needs to have everything perfect to work , it must be stressful as fuck . 
  it must suck to be a well known actor , trying to learn your lines on set , or whatever shit you are doing , and having people keep trying to talk to you when you just want to focus on your lines and your work . 
  also , rachel mcadams is cute and hot as fuck . 
  what brand should i get ? 
  what should i look for in those sheets ? 
  i always see reddit talking about high thread count sheets , but i do n't know what to buy . 
  jesus fucking christ , do they think they are creating `` art '' ? 
  i 'm going to have a stroke , because my brain ca n't understand why does that happen even though it read the description in the video . 
  tread lightly, 
  i got cetaphil . 
  there are only 3 available , i got the 1st and the 3rd . 
  cetaphil gentle skin cleanser 236ml and cetaphil moisturising cream 100g . 
  i 'm not an american , i do n't think i can get that in my country . 
  i 'll look for it . 
  thanks . 
  yeah , i ca n't get it . 
  i got chills from the fucking music . 
  i would if i could but on amazon it 's too expensive and here in portugal i ca n't get cerave . 
  oh shit , to look healthy i have to eat right and exercise ? 
  well , back to reddit then .

  tread lightly, 
  beatles and queen are overrated as fuck . 
  i remember that day , i opened reddit , saw a lot of spam , closed it , only came back the next day . 
  i 've been reading about these for a few months now . 
  tell me how good they are again so i can blow the money on them . 
  i only listen to music or watch movies . 
  the sound at the moment is rather flat , good mids/highs , but the bass it 's a joke . 
  i do n't want a moving booming box , but i want something that would make me enjoy driving from a to b. 
  why the change from a mono amp to a 4 channel amp ? 
  what about the 2 channel ones ? 
  and what are the 10 `` s ? 
  subwoofers ? 
  that would be too much for my trunk . 
  my car is small . 
  it would be an overkill . 
  but , the higher the rms per channel the better ? 
  `` wan na go to the discoteque hear some michael jackson ? '', 
   pretty much , and i would n't consider a speaker amp worth installing over a good deck unless it 's about 60w/channel . 
  i have a 52w sony head unit , do n't know if that 's what you are talking about . 
   then bridging a 4 channel to a single sub should be plenty of bass for you . 
  the thing is my trunk is so small a subwoofer would take a lot of space . 
  i 'm sorry for this stupid question , but just would n't an amplifier increase the sound quality of my speakers ? 
  as i said , a booming moving box is not what i intend to do , much less on a 21 year old car . 
  i had bought some jbl gto938 a few weeks ago , but i just traded them in for the pioneer , since the sound was shit and i did n't knew better . 
  for budget yes , probably , but the thing is , my car is old , and i do n't see how could i have a sub under the seat due to the lack of space . 
  thanks . 
  how hard would it be to install one of these ? 
  i installed this on my q6600 and it would frame drop like a motherfucker and slow the music down aswell , it sucked . 
  i have n't tried on my i5-3570k yet , but if the same problem arises is there any fix for the frame drop ? 
  nice .
