   good afternoon ,, 
   i 'm writing this email to see if there are any entry-level opportunities available in your company as a production assistant . 
   i understand that this industry requires a great deal of flexibility and despite not having experience in this area , i 'm ready to do and to work whatever it takes to get the job done . 
   i love cinema , and would like , in this gap year that i 'm taking before joining a film school to do some work related to film . 
   i took the liberty to attach my resume . 
   if there is anywhere you could use an additional pair of hands , let me know . 
   thanks for taking the time , i 'm looking for forward to hear back from you . 
   best ,,

  i 'll raise that and marry her . 
  are you talking about emma ? 
  she beat and bit her boyfriend and was arrested . 
  cute though . 
  i remember my shits and farts when i was going to the gym a year ago . 
  damn , i do n't want to go through that shit again . 
  i 've seen people that go to the gym with their 9-5 job . 
  and also , i 've read chris hemsworth saying that an hour and a half on the gym is enough . 
  people think hugh jackman or chris hemsworth spend 8 hours on the gym lifting , that 's not even true . 
  everyone can do what they do . 
  this is just an excuse to stay on the couch browsing reddit . 
  i do n't , i installed it , and yet , with only 2 tabs opened , it 's still slower than chrome . 
  i just remembered i acted on stage in a play , and there is a local article about that , should i mention it aswell ?

  got any before and after profile pics ? 
  yeah , side profile . 
  acknowledging the shy cutie . 
  i took it , but it was taken back . 
  i still want to look as good as a lead in a hollywood movie . 
  best friends with benefits , a marriage , two kids , and a dog . 
  i still think [ djesus uncrossed ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkgqul-sy4o ) is the best snl trailer recently made . 
  that 's hollywood . 
  yeah , let me correct that for you . 
  she said she would never lose weight for a role . 
  well , now i have a son , and i had to pay with all i had . 
  what 's the name of his new stand up ? 
  2 eggs and bacon makes you full until 2-3pm ? 
  at what time do you eat ? 
  how is your day, 
  thanks for clarifying , only noticed it when you pointed it out . 
  fitty cent . 
  she 's cute and tiny , i like it . 
  but i also read somewhere that she was arrested for domestic violence . 
  i have nothing to ask , but i would like to tell you that you should tell the writers on new girl to incorporate the accents you made on conan into the show . 
  it would be awesome to have cece doing impersonations .

  what do you think about these guys , www.youtube.com/watch?v=uf2kzqiroa4 , that got their breast cancer donation refunded due to the charity not liking how they raised it ? 
  they motorboated girls , and for each girl motorboated they raised $ 20 . 
  they raised a total of i think $ 2000 .
