  yeah , i notice that sometimes mediahint goes down , the whole website goes down and it does n't work . 
  this time , the plugin does n't work , but the website does . 
  that 's why i asked . 
  it 's not working anymore for me . 
  i 'm using zenmate , but it 's a proxy so it does n't work that well , i have connection breaks and errors . 
  with mediahint , it would load normally . 
  she did n't . 
  she 's cute as fuck without makeup . 
  taking this comment to tell you that that comic was deep as shit . 
  i felt it , deep , in my heart . 
  i have all those three games aswell . 
  imagine that moth inside your ears . 
  imagine that moth inside one of your ears . 
  yeah , that 's the first time i fucking cringed so hard i almost went full on fetus position in my chair . 
  that 's why i said that . 
  i always liked planes and whatever , but the first time i flew , damn nigga , that was some serious power . 
  now i kinda want to be a pilot despite not knowing that much math . 
  fuck dude , reading that was intense . 
  i sighed out of relief when i read that your arm was n't going to be amputated . 
  fucking hell , i do n't even want to imagine . 
  gon na grab some afternoon delight . 
  i want to take my motorcycles license , but every time i see a fucking bike in the road i think `` i could just touch this bike with my bumper and the guy would fucking die . 
  '' , it 's fucking terrifying . 
  my dad got his license i think 15 years ago , and never had an accident , but i 'm always scared of what could happen . 
  but i kinda want to know what 's the feel of driving a bike , must be awesome , that complete freedom . 
  i want to take my license , and i also want to buy that protective gear like motogp , with kneepads , shoulderpads , backpads , all around pads , and a helmet with the number 46 . 
  previously on `` how to live with jennifer lawrence '',

  i 'm a flying squirrel, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ joke, 
  ^ she 's ^ my ^ favourite ^ actress . 
  i did n't have the hand thing until a year ago i think . 
  and now it 's the shower aswell . 
  i have probably mild ocd , but every time i wash my hands i spend atleast 15 minutes doing it . 
  the water bill is insane . 
  the shower aswell , i spend atleast 15 to 30 minutes more in the shower trying to get out , but my brain does n't let me turn the water off , so i spend like 30 minutes washing myself , and then 30 minutes of wasting water trying to get out . 
  also , a year ago , i started to have that `` do not touch the door handles on the bathrooms '' thing aswell . 
  i ca n't even go to the movies without being fucking anxious about having to go to the bathroom and having to wash my hands and then get out so i can do the thing i enjoy the most in the world , which is , watching films . 
  so now i have a technique which is , i pee at home , and if i have to go to the bathroom , i wo n't wash my hands , fuck it , and just be dirty for that hour and a half or two hours , the feeling and urge to wash my hands usually goes away after that hour or two . 
  fucking ocd , i 'm not even medicated , and no one knows about my ocd , except myself . 
  yeah baby, 
  i went out with a girl a few weeks ago , and we were on the train and she was really close to me , i noticed it and also noticed that she was trying to put her head on my shoulder , so i said `` you can do it . 
  '' , and she did it . 
  you and me dude . 
  it 's fucking crushing . 
  and i do n't think i should lower my standards , because other people would n't do it aswell . 
  the point here is kids do n't want sound quality , they want to think they are cool , hip and dope to other people . 
  identity theft is not a joke jim , millions of people suffer from it every year !, 
  yeah , i do n't get it either , but oh well , i 'm not a teenager anymore and i pay for shit with my own money , so i want good shit . 
  thanks .

  i , do , not ,, 
  well , so do i. 
  it 's time to change barbers . 
  i ask the old dude to cut my hair in a certain way . 
  then when it reaches the point i like i say `` okey , it 's good thanks . 
  '' , and he says `` just a little bit more . 
  '' , and ends up cutting way too much . 
  i , just , fucking , shit . 
  if those noses are big , then i 'm a fucking jew .

  really incredible case , and i hope daniel br\u00fchl receives an oscar nomination for niki lauda , one of my my favourite performances from 2013 . 
  what i 'm asking if there are any pools like middlecoin or hashcow , who mine whatever coin is the most profitable and pay you in bitcoins , but in this case , pay you in litecoins .
