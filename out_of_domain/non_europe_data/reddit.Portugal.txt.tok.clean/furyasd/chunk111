  thanks . 
  do they pay automatically in litecoins ? 
  oh , that 's nice , did n't know about that , have to check because i did n't see the option in the website . 
  yeah , but eus\u00e9bio man . 
  really ? 
  maybe i was working out wrong then . 
  even on workout days , i was never tired . 
  i could go to sleep at 5am and wake up at 10am , go to the gym , and still go to bed at 5am next day . 
  \\  sleeping until 10am, 
  \\  only got 5 hours of sleep, 
  \\  still not tired, 
  really ? 
  that 's what you took from my comment ? 
  this is what i feel when i listen to `` the great gig in the sky '' , i just could never explain it with words . 
  ** no i do not like transformers therefore i do not like michael bay so stop making me feel emotions i do not want to feel **, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ liked ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ armageddon . 
   especially when you are wrong, 
  ** you dumb fuck !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ joke , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ was ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ right ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ there . 
  jesus , that made me depressed . 
  they ca n't be real if we are not real, 
  it 's just not joy or pride , it 's maturity . 
  i ca n't even open my arms the whole way , i hope that in july something is already different . 
  oh , i will remember the doms tomorrow morning when i wake up and i ca n't even fucking stand up . 
  all that fucking pain tomorrow . 
  i thought to just go for everything today , because i know how shit doms is . 
  probably , not the best way to go for your first day at the gym in a year , but i thought `` well , if i get rid of the doms , i wo n't have to suffer throughout the next week . 
  '' , so i did bench press , squat , bent-over row and curls . 
  i could n't do any shoulder or tricep work . 
  so , i probably should do that tomorrow or friday . 
  but tomorrow , all that doms . 
  squat that bar, 
  thanks . 
  my goal in 6 or 7 months is to try and get abs , because girl . 
  i hope it 's doable . 
  i 'm at the lowest weight i can . 
  i was bench pressing 135lbs last year , not much , but it was the progress i made in 3 months . 
  if you can run half a marathon , then you are set . 
  today , because there were a lot of people on the weight room , i went to the treadmill because why not , i ran for 2 straight minutes at speed 12 , and had to stop . 
  i was so fucking breathless , i thought i was going to die . 
  surgery . 
  should have taped it and put it on youtube with the title `` raw power squat this bitch '', 
  well , last year , i was doing it for myself only . 
  this year , i 'm doing it for myself , and for my girlfriend . 
  and i do n't think there 's nothing wrong with it , as long as you do n't quit after the first month . 
  i do n't think it 's whining , i just think it 's funny because of my thought process . 
  and also , because i want to pick her up while doing things . 
  i ca n't lift my max weights , i wish . 
  i was close to my body weight on bench press , but then i had to leave . 
  if i was whining , i might aswell quit . 
  i 'm not going to quit . 
  after 4 chest workouts ? 
  i did 3 sets of bench press and i was done . 
  i had to move on to the next body part . 
  i miss ohp . 
  yeah , not giving up is the hardest part . 
  well , atleast in the beggining , because of not working out for a very long time , and coming back and doms . 
  after that , it 's all good . 
  i do n't know what sauerkraut juice is . 
  but thanks for the advice . 
  nice to know . 
  yeah , curling and seeing all that veins popping with 15lbs . 
  all those fucking gains, 
  hey man , good luck to you . 
  i had surgery because i could n't breathe . 
  i could n't run more than 5 minutes in the gym and i would be breathless , now it 's a bit better . 
  just keep at it . 
  i 'm portuguese , so it 's kilograms , the bar is like 20kg , plus 17,5 kg on the bench press . 
  that 's like 37,5 kg , it 's less than half of my weight . 
  yeah , i do n't think i 'm going to start that rough , my shoulders are pinching like a motherfucker . 
  i 'm glad that you and your wife are taking steps for a healthier life . 
  good luck for you both . 
  two years ago , i ate a lot , and i had no problem , today was different . 
  i do n't like to vomit , so i always hold it in . 
  i do n't give a fuck . 
  i even felt my harmstring stretch when i ran . 
  i was planning on doing a 3 day a week routine . 
  thanks for the advice , but i already can stretch my arms . 
  i just could n't after getting home from the gym . 
  let 's see what happens tomorrow . 
  today , it hurts like a motherfucker , my left arm hurts a lot more than my right arm , i can stretch them both with a lot of pain though . 
  yeah , it 's the same pain as when i started two years ago , but i look like i 'm handicapped and my arms can only go 90 degrees . 
  i thought i just had to lick the clit . 
  yes , the girlfriend of my best friend was n't quite a very attractive girl , just a normal looking girl , but as i got to know her , she started to be more attractive . 
  i 've been single since 2008 , it 's 2014 . 
  i discovered this , told by a lot of girls , that i 'm not unattractive , i just say shit like an asshole . 
  imagine having no filter on what you say like house . 
  yeah , that 's me in real life . 
  what lance armstrong circlejerk ? 
  all rachel mcadams . 
  i almost , almost played for the national team in my country , i left my team because people were being bullied and there was just not comradery between anyone , i was young though . 
  a few years after , a few of my coaches saw me , and told me i was stupid as fuck for leaving and i could be one of the best players in the country . 
  i 'm portuguese . 
  well , fuck them all , for not creating a good environment between people and letting 11 and 12 year olds being bullied by everyone . 
  also , gta vice city had just come out and i prefered the safety of my house and the fun of the game , instead of running and being bullied . 
  and the goal in the video is n't anything special . 
  i played for years , and it was made every single day . 
  that angle ? 
  that 's the normal angle from where those shots are made . 
  i 've seen goals like that with even less angle than that .
