  ricky is a fucking genius , both him and louis ck have been putting awesome stand-up and tv content out there . 
  not `` o ( part 2/reprise ) '' , because `` the f \\*\\*\\* ing cd physically f \\* ** ing evaporated before i could play it . '' . 
  that could have been a life saver . 
  this is cheesy as fuck , but i 'm using this as my cover photo on facebook . 
  well , there are people like me that like to listen to every single bit of every instrument and discover new things in coldplay 's music . 
  really ? 
  that cheap ? 
  last time i saw on motogp website , it cost more than 100 $ . 
  if it costs only 29,99 $ , i 'm actually going to buy it . 
  edit : it 's 114,95 $ for multiscreen for the rest of the season . 
  eheheheheheh, 
  deserved that red card . 
  what a retard . 
  nah , pepe is dumb . 
  that is not justifiable . 
  do n't blame the referee for stupid and dumb mistakes by a already known shitty attitude player . 
  reel midrid . 
  jesus christ , where the fuck did you get that jacket ? 
  where can i buy one ? 
  i want one . 
  now . 
  where did you bought that shirt ? 
  i know the person for about a year now , i 've been getting paid salaries for the past year , because i 've been doing customer support for another company . 
  now , the person who is paying me is starting up a new company and asked me if i wanted to be a power of attorney . 
  but what bullshit scam are you talking about ?

  i 've read on the three comments that this is a scam . 
  but what scam are you talking about ? 
  they have n't asked me for funds . 
  i 've already been paid for my work for the past 12 months . 
  $ 600/month for customer support . 
  now , since a new company is being created , they asked me to do some administrative stuff , like hire freelancers to create creative content for our website , manage social media content , manage a support team . 
  they never asked me for any money . 
  i 'm just worried of what repercussions i might have for being a power of attorney . 
  will they be able to use my name for illegal stuff or is n't the power of attorney ( me ) only able to do that ? 
  as i 've said on another comment ,,

  how will they scam me then ? 
  what could happen to me ? 
  fucking hell , that 's harsh . 
  no , never seen it . 
  also , am i good if i do n't sign anything ? 
  yes , it does clear . 
  i do n't want to get fucked or fuck my life because of this . 
  thanks . 
  yeah , i enjoyed saying takaaki nakagami 's name , but now he just disappeared . 
  always in my head . 
  i think of you . 
  we 'll be glowing in the dark . 
  thank you everybody .
