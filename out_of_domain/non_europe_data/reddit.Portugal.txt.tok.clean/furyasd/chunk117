  never heard it . 
  it 's fucking beautiful . 
  now after learning cemeteries of london on the guitar , i have to learn this one . 
  the fuck is going on ? 
  this is the first time i smile for 4 minutes and 13 seconds without stopping !, 
  fucking coldplay !, 
  also , i need to go to the gym !, 
  coldplay, 
  something something, 
  yeah , first thing i noticed when i watched it for the first time was `` 1080p ? 
  this is not that hd as it seems . 
  '' , and i really did n't care . 
  the video is beautifully done , and even though i noticed that some things , like the drum on chris 's back is n't beating on time , i did n't give a shit . 
  they walked on the fucking street , guy berryman smiled , they showed happiness , it was nice . 
  another championship for him in the next two years ? 
  previously on ... chris martins ' love life . 
  i was on the verge of having a panic attack and yell at the screen saying `` jesus fucking christ , leave me the fuck alone !, 
  '' , and i 'm not even chris martin . 
  fucking marquez , so skilled he rides his bike with his mind . 
  how can 3 million hours in the week if only 7 million people in the world ? 
  i 'm very happy with this , too bad it was n't a 3 year contract , because i will only be able to ride a 600 when i 'm 25 , and i 'm only 22 , and i would really like to ride with my dad to see valentino rossi , but i 'm sure i will have the pleasure to see him win another championship . 
  i just fucking hope . 
  well , there 's still the emotional part natalie portman had to play , still as many voters said , dancing was part of the acting , but despite what the dancer and darren aronofsky said , maybe the 80 % scenes that appeared in the movie are n't the 80 % scenes that the dancer shot , so they are all correct , if that makes any sense . 
  but that 's just me . 
  i knew it . 
  i 'm on reddit with my mind . 
  she is my fucking age . 
  will `` the calmer '' champion, 
  but did n't the interviewer called chris a dictator ? 
  and the sick of your shit thing , was that coldplay related or just chris being chris ? 
  sometimes you ca n't stand your friends . 
  and they both have been friends for a very long time .
