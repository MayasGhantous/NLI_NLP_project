  i know . 
  that 's why i went to the fucking psychiatrist to cure myself . 
  probably . 
  it 's a very delicate subject for me . 
  i hate that i 'm like this and i hate that i 've hurt my girlfriend . 
  i fucking love her and the first time i did it , i knew that i was sick and i needed help , that 's why i went directly to the psychiatrist .

  i still have n't got a chance to attend a coldplay concert , so this vr thing would be fucking awesome . 
  it feels a bit radiohead-ish . 
  but cool as fuck though . 
  i think to be honest coldplay make better music than radiohead . 
  i actually do n't game professionally , so i just want a second monitor . 
  i thought about getting a ips dell , but i remembered that i 'm playing cs : go daily/every other day now , so i thought , why not getting a better monitor ? 
  overclocking ? 
  had no idea that was possible . 
  i 'm thinking in buying the monitor today , so too bad . 
  is the benq xl2430t better than the benq xl2420t ? 
  i see . 
  regarding ips 's , do you recommend any ? 
  i see that dell and [ benq ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/b00hvcjs8k/ref=s9_simh_gw_p147_d0_i7?pf_rd_m=a3p5rokl5a1ole&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=1ttykqvazfp2g45vj186&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=455344027&amp;pf_rd_i=468294 ) are probably the best . 
  24 '' dell or benq ips for 200 $ -300 $ ? 
  also , gaming monitor for 200 $ -300 $ ? 
  what models ? 
  need to order from europe . 
  i ca n't decide !, 
  yep . 
  oh fucking hell , i saw this like a year ago , and it 's still awesome . 
  does anyone have the accurate chords for this song ? 
  seems like a seizure . 
  cute though . 
  actually , it 's pretty normal . 
  it 's one of the honeymoon stage things that happen to me . 
  my girlfriend just needed to say hello via text when we were in the honeymoon phase that i had a boner . 
  now it 's not like that anymore , but in the beginning .

  if we sexted while i was out , fuck yeah . 
  walking around with a boner . 
  ah , good times .
