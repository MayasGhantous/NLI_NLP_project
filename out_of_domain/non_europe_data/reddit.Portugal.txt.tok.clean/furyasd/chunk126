   few, 
  also , last one , she 's really tiny . 
  thanks mate . 
  well , in charlie brown it was actually specific . 
  it was, 
  all the boys , all the girls ,, 
  all that matters in the world, 
  all the boys , all the girls ,, 
  all the madness that occurs . 
  all the highs , all the lows ,, 
  as the room a-spinning goes, 
  we 'll be glowing in the dark . 
  slowed down . 
  i 'm just shaking my head . 
  my porsche 911 is better than both of your cars . 
  stop being a raging cunt . 
  will on the piano on a full song !, 
  nice !, 
  i have ocd , i 'm being treated for it and i do n't care about that sweater . 
  in case you have missed the last few months on csgo . 
  pasha and olof are friends . 
  * woosh *, 
  are esl and esea considered hollywood already ? 
  what happened here ? 
   the band is starting to sound like a chris martin solo project and it 's seriously upsetting . 
  you clearly did n't hear the bass , and as for as on topic goes , listen to the bass on birds from guy . 
  listen to the bass from guy on adventure of a lifetime aswell . 
  i do n't think x&y was depressing . 
  i think it was about overcoming fear and finding a purpose in life . 
  wait , will stoner be back racing ? 
  i 've heard so much about him , but never saw him riding live . 
  i love you for being such a good person towards animals . 
  i cried at the comic too . 
  guy has different teeth here . 
  check the facebook interview on the bakery . 
  he has caps on that interview . 
  no worries . 
  she 's cute . 
  not in the case of op . 
   not nearly as physically demanding, 
  you should read about the gforces on motogp and formula 1 . 
  it 's as or even more physically demanding as a normal sport like soccer , american football , basketball , etc, 
  and everything 's not lost . 
  that 's a lot of money . 
  that is a lot of money, 
  of money . 
  chris , you ca n't just go around and hit people with your jeep . 
  jesus christ , chris . 
  chris . 
  there goes my idea of watching them live . 
  yep . 
  should n't even sleep or do my life stuff . 
  that 's ok , i 'm just unlucky . 
  viva la vida era they did n't come to my country , mylo xyloto era they did but i did n't have any money and was struggling as fuck to survive , ghost stories they did n't tour , a head full of dreams they are also not coming to my country , i do have money to travel , yet tickets are sold out . 
  thanks . 
  saw on stubhub a lot of people selling tickets , but the reviews for that website are really bad . 
  birds, 
  this is very old . 
  that one girl did n't know what she was talking about . 
  what about football players who leave their familes to play football ? 
  it 's just shit propaganda back in the day where everyone badmouthed videogames . 
  really ? 
  jesus fucking christ , i 'm glad i have n't watched tv in a while . 
  still those threads are from 2 years ago . 
  the interview to which the article is referring is from 2013 . 
  still those morning shows are shit . 
  they only speak about what 's wrong with portugal , just to appeal to the elderly that watch the show , and never ever speak about uplifting stuff , because who the fuck cares about uplifting stuff when after you watch the show , you go out and complain how shit the country is . 
  i am almost certain that camera ugly people ( no chin , jaw , any other facial deformities ) wo n't ever become successful tv/film actors . 
  i have read about the golden ratio , and i have come to the conclusion that real ugly people wo n't make it . 
  are there any studies that discuss this ? 
  the facial structure is there anyway . 
  jonah hill , amy schumer , adele , rebel wilson and melissa mccarthy . 
  fat , but with a good facial structure . 
   if it were n't for this golden ratio of camera would you get plastic surgery on your chin ? 
  yes . 
  i am not good looking . 
  here 's my proof , [ 1 ] ( https://www.dropbox.com/s/r72m5l2c4vb3e5w/2016-01-02%2023.06.42.jpg?dl=0 ) , [ 2 ] ( https://www.dropbox.com/s/7nc8y11us6dks4z/2016-01-02%2023.07.08.jpg?dl=0 ) .

  [ this guy ] ( http://www.tracking-board.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/red-state-portraits-2011-sundance-film-festival-_ohuyyj9e16l.jpg ) ? 
  good face . 
  steve buscemi [ fits the golden ratio ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/12/f3/79/12f3798b326f487414882b3757ce5233.jpg ) . 
  gerard depardieu [ good facial structure ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/0d/9e/70/0d9e70dd56d1c6b217a78a85e1a2f698.jpg ) , just adrien brody nose . 
  gary busey just has weird teeth , same thing as steve buscemi . 
  benicio del toro , the [ puerto rican brad pitt ] ( http://36.media.tumblr.com/e56a32632d2a56567bb03aa3d84140f3/tumblr_mo7y3o9xlh1qh32dco1_500.jpg ) ? 
  have nothing on danny trejo , luis guzman and linda hunt . 
  kathy bates is fat , but a good looking woman . 
  carol kane is meh , conchata ferrell is similar to luis guzman , mostly small roles , probably struggling to make a living out of acting . 
  s epatha merkeson , female morgan freeman . 
  the thing is those actors you 've mentioned actually have a good nose/chin , except for adam driver 's weird jaw and ears . 
  jay leno was/is a comedian , do n't think he would be a good drama actor . 
  [ here 's something i just did ] ( https://www.dropbox.com/s/oh1y3h5r1q5f1ui/combined-20160102_230642.jpg?dl=0 ) . 
  i was going back and forth on both pictures , and there 's a big difference on having a good chin or no chin . 
  thanks for the words . 
  regarding the golden ratio , yeah , a lot of actors do n't fit it , yet if you check all the actors , they all have a good chin and 90 % have a good nose . 
  i think the nose is fine aswell , just check jake johnson and adrien brody , they are rocking non-average noses . 
  pff , nope . 
  i started taking ocd medications and started to eat a lot due to them , they open the appetite , gained 88lbs . 
  i 'm 6 ' 4 '' , so i went 132lbs to 220lbs . 
  i will go back to the gym when possible , i 've been traveling around a lot . 
   conchata ferrell is struggling to make a living ?
