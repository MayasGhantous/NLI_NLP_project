  i 'm going to download call of duty : modern warfare 3 , gta iv , sleeping dogs , borderlands 2 , and all those games people are benchmark testing to see what 's going on . 
  my setup is, 
  asus p5k, 
  q6600 @ 2.4 ghz, 
  sapphiree hd 7950 vapor-x oc, 
  is my cpu bottlenecking my gpu ? 
  also , i have n't overclocked the gpu , it 's still on 850mhz . 
  my setup is, 
  asus p5k, 
  q6600 @ 2.4 ghz, 
  running at 1280x1024 resolution . 
  i ca n't find any info about this on the internet , is anyone else having the same problem ? 
  i suffer from anxiety , ocd , and i 'd like to know how much did it help smoking regards anxiety , etc. 
  thanks . 
  so , i had a internet/tv/phone service contract with an isp , but this isp started having problems 4 to 6 months ago , and my dad was always calling them telling them to fix the service , they came here 5 to 10 times , and never fixed , the internet went down every 15 minutes every day for the past few months , so today i got so fucking mad , i called them and told them politely `` i want to annul the contract i have with you because for the past 6 months the service is n't according to the contract !, 
  '' , i did n't yell , i spoke politely but with confidence . 
  i usually do n't like to talk in front of anyone , and i even get embarassed by talking alone , but today i got so fucking mad , i talked to the customer service for 30 minutes infront of my parents , i did n't care , i just want my fucking internet working as it should . 
  so 30 minutes on the phone , with no anxiety , and it was cool . 
  so , now , i only have to get fucking mad when i want to ask a girl out and everything will be good . 
  ** tl ; dr : solved anxiety by getting fucking mad . 
  sometimes people talk so fast or mumble something i ca n't possibly understand it . 
  english is not my first language , but i can read it and write it as if it was my native language , i do n't have to think about it or to translate it from portuguese to english to know what i want to say , but when watching something , it 's a bit difficult to understand sometimes . 
  does this happen to you , native english speakers or am i alone here ? 
  i 'm thinking in buying a ssd . 
  and i would like to do what 's the life expectacy of a ssd , and what you can do or not with one , since i 've read that if you defrag the ssd it can die very soon , and i do n't want that . 
  thanks . 
  i 'm thinking in buying the canon 550d , what do you think ? 
  i think my temps are high as fuck with the stock cooler , i think the psu is blowing air to the cpu because i have an old case and the psu is above the motherboard and cpu , etc. 
  100 % load with unlocker because i need to delete some shit that i ca n't with the normal shift + delete . 
  and it went to almost 80\u00bac . 
  i ordered a monitor thinking it would be the acer s240hlbid with hdmi , but i got a acer s240hlbd thinking it would only be a typo , but now that i see it 's not . 
  http://www.acer.co.uk/ac/en/gb/content/model-datasheet/et.fs0he.005 - bid, 
  i 'm using d-sub aswell now plugged into the monitor , i think it 's vga , and i use an adapter to dvi to plug it to the sapphire hd 7950 vapor-x i have . 
  are there any major differences image wise ? 
  or should i just buy a dvi cable and it 's done ? 
  thanks . 
  my monitors are a philips 17 '' and an acer 24 '' . 
  philips is connected to the integrated graphics by vga . 
  acer 24 '' is connected to the gpu by vga to dvi . 
  edit : nevermind , drivers were n't installed , i do n't even know why . 
  if i play world of warcraft 1080p at ultra it will go up to 85\u00bac and make a lot of noise , and idle it gets to almost 50\u00bac . 
  i know my case and cable management is n't that great , but this cooler is the stock cooler and it makes a lot of noise . 
  since i do n't know much about coolers , can i get a recommendation on one ? 
  my budget is 100 $ . 
  i have no idea what the problem is . 
  you all know you want it .

  i 've been trying to get some headphones to watch films and tv shows , but i ca n't decide , i could go to a headphone only subreddit , but i 'd like to know what people from buildapc have . 
  i watch a lot of films and tv shows , also i listen to coldplay , i 'd like to know which one of these is better to get for what i do . 
  thanks . 
  s3 is still a bit expensive , so i was thinking in buying a s2 , i mostly only listen to music and browse reddit on my current phone , but it 's very slow , it 's a nokia 5800 xpressmusic , and i 'd like to buy a better and faster phone . 
  there 's this picture , i ca n't find it anywhere , it 's einstein with his face in a woman 's vagina , and his mustache makes her bush . 
  yeah , if anyone has it , please upload it , thanks . 
  i wanted to know if this is possible to happen , and it 's not a side effect of any other thing , because it has happened with full/complete anesthesia and local anesthesia . 
  and why does it happen aswell ? 
  is it just only the anesthesia ? 
  is it because of the stress that a person goes through during an operation ? 
  post-op stress ? 
  is it a combination of anesthesia , stress and medication ? 
  i 'd like to know this . 
  thanks . 
  so , there 's shit shitty soap opera in my country , portugal , and i sometimes watch it because there 's this really cute actress . 
  but anyway , i sometimes want to punch the directors , whom are 3 to direct a shitty soap opera , because they let the actors do whatever they fucking want , and therefore creating a shitty soap opera , which it 's a fucking irony . 
  so here 's the problem , the actors , most of them , or 99 % of them do n't know how to act in television , which made me ask this question . 
  would it improve the scene if the director told their actors to when doing a scene where they are the only ones in the shot , ( as in , doing a conversation with another person , but they are the only ones in the shot ) , to lift their eyes and look at the person that they are talking with , instead of looking to where the camera is , or to the ground ? 
  to me seeing that they are looking elsewhere except to the person they are doing the scene feels like they are not invested in what they are saying and they are n't even in the scene . 
  am i wrong about this or am i right ? 
  i then go watch any american tv show , as i went to watch happy endings , and the acting was so different , they were in the scene , looking at each other , etc. 
  edit : first on the front page . 
  nice .

  my dad wants to start reading , but wants to start with some light reading , so books with probably less than 100 pages . 
  i do n't know much about books , the only things i know are from the top 200 from reddit , but i do n't know which are easier to read or have better stories or just grab you from beggining to end . 
  if you could recommend me something would be great . 
  any genre is good .

  i 'm 21 , and i have a lot of oil/grease in my face , i do n't know where all this oil/grease/fat comes out , probably my diet , a lot of cheese/milk/fat , but do you have any way of getting rid of the oily face ? 
  i take a shower , and 5 minutes after of getting out of the shower , i 'm as oily as i was before taking it , and my nose and forehead are the most oily/greasy parts , i have no idea what to do , this shit sucks , and i have no idea of what to use . 
  thanks . 
  i just got a really good grade in a exam , that might open the door for a few film schools for me , i really like film/tv , and would like to be a director/actor , but i 've never even filmed anything , ever , only acted in a shitty play a few years ago , and it was somewhat cool . 
  so , i 'm thinking if it 's bad to go to school without any kind of experience , since i think most of the people that go into art schools have some kind of experience before going to school .
