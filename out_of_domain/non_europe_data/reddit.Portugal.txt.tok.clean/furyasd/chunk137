  thanks . 
  i think the fucking world if falling apart or is fucking upside down , i do n't know . 
  one or two weeks ago , i discovered that my 13 year old female cousin is somewhat dating a fucking 19 year old who has no sense of whatever the fuck he should have sense of . 
  why the fuck a 13 year old and a 19 year old would be in a relationship ? 
  a girl i saw today from my class of a year ago , said that she was racist and that she did n't like black people , i saw her today in the street , so i remembered to go on facebook to see what 's what , and i saw that she is somewhat also probably dating a black dude . 
  how the fuck do you go from racist to non-racist ? 
  did she went to the church and some magic happened ? 
  last , my german uncle , is going to marry a brazilian woman .

  i just bought [ this hdd ] ( http://www.amazon.com/dp/b005t3grnw/?tag=pcpapi-20 ) , because i need extra space on my computer due to my only 300gb hdd . 
  and it 's being noisy as fuck , like when it spins so fast that it makes noise . 
  does this happen to you aswell ? 
  jesus , it 's annoying . 
  i 'm thinking in sending my resume to a few production companies to see if they have pa work available . 
  i 'm volunteering . 
  what do you think ? 
  my email consists on, 
   hi , my name is furyasd , i 'm 21 , and this email is to provide my resume and ask you if there is any production assistant position open . 
  i like cinema , and would like to work in this gap year i 'm taking , before going to film school , so i can start to know the film world . 
  what do you think ? 
  i have no experience , and i want to learn . 
  i ca n't use my card anymore with mediahint on netflix , my card is portuguese . 
  does anyone know if they really blocked it , or is it just a problem with my card ? 
  i 'm new to this , and it seems that from the calculations i 've been making i will mine almost 3 ltc every 7 days . 
  i have a few questions , will i be able to be on the computer while mining , or it will be impossible ? 
  will my gpu suffer any damage from the prolonged use ? 
  thanks . 
  i 'm running a single 7950 , and the fan goes up to almost 3000rpm , it 's noisy as fuck . 
  does everyone else has this problem ? 
  is it possible to create your own pool and website ? 
  it seems to be a bit difficult since there are only a few dozen pools , but is it in anyway possible to create one ? 
  i 'm trying to mine with my 7950 , but i 'm afraid that the 80\u00bac 24/7 will fuck it really fast . 
  does anyone know what the life span of 7950 under these conditions is ? 
  edit : it seems not much because it just crashed at 900/1300 at 80\u00bac . 
  i have a 7950 and a i5-3570k , and since if the intensity is at 20 , i ca n't be on the computer , since it 's locks , so what i thought about was connecting the monitor to the integrated graphics of the cpu and just have the gpu mine connected only to the motherboard and nothing else . 
  yet , i ca n't seem to work this out because i tried to connect the monitor to the integrated graphics and it just does n't show any image . 
  i only started with this a few days ago , and i see a lot of people with their wallets as flairs . 
  is there any way of getting hacked just by sharing the wallet address ? 
  i 've discovered litecoin a few days ago , and i 've been on this subreddit and the litecoinmining subreddit . 
  at the moment , i have no money to invest and the last few days have been making me even more anxious than i already am . 
  from the jump from 7 $ or 8 $ to 11 $ , the anxiety gets higher because i have no way of investing in the currency . 
  i 've been awake for several hours after trying to sleep because i do n't want to miss this oportunity like i missed bitcoin a few years ago when i dismissed it because i had no idea what it was . 
  thanks for reading , this was just a rant i wanted to share with this subreddit . 
  feathercoin , they even have their own market . 
  cgminer -- scrypt - g 2 -- lookup-gap 2 -- gpu-engine 1095 -- gpu-memclock 1400 -- temp-target 78 -- auto-fan -- worksize 256 -- thread-concurrency 8192 - i 13 - o stratum + tcp : / / stratum.hashfaster.com :3333, 
  gives me errors and if i raise the intensity it lowers my kh/s . 
  any help on how to fix this ? 
  thanks . 
  i know it 's probably not much , but a friend of mine said he had like 50 $ to buy a camera and wanted to buy a shitty camcorder . 
  i think my s3 is far way better and films way better than a shitty camcorder from 2000 . 
  we do n't know much about filmmaking , but i 'm eager to start , i know the rule of thirds and the 180 rule , that 's all i know about filmmaking , the rest i know from watching films and tv , which is probably not much or nothing at all , but it makes me excited to want to film , and to learn about light and editing . 
  what do you think ?
