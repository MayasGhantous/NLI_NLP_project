  it 's just so fucking beautiful . 
  i want one !, 
  i played mop , but left in the middle because it was boring . 
  wotlk was the best to be honest for me . 
  cata sucked , mop was way better when leveling , but end-game was n't that great . 
  how 's this one so far ? 
  want to buy a budget acoustic guitar to play coldplay . 
  maybe up to 200 $ ? 
  help please ? 
  i have a [ 50 $ acoustic stagg guitar ] ( http://www.nashvilleguitarstore.com/files/2014/08/5714.jpg ) , and a [ ~ 100 $ electric fender squier ] ( http://www.bestbuy.ca/multimedia/products/500x500/101/10140/10140097.jpg ) . 
  but none has the sound i want . 
  i know chris 's guitars are martin 's but those are 1000 $ + , i want a guitar that 's a lot more cheaper but that has a better sound than the ones i have at the moment . 
  can anyone help ? 
  chris martin 's guitar is a martin 15 series d15m dreadnought acoustic guitar . 
  i want a second monitor . 
  one to game , and the other i already have to have other stuff opened . 
  my budget is 200 $ -300 $ . 
  which from those should i choose ? 
  prices, 
  * [ asus vg248qe ] ( http://www.pcdiga.com/2/10029/monitor-asus-led-24-vg248qe-144hz-3d ) - 292,00 $, 
  * [ benq xl2411z ] ( http://www.pcdiga.com/2/13213/monitor-benq-24-led-xl2411z-144hz-9h-l9slb-rbe ) - 249,90 $, 
  * benq xl2420t - n/a / [ xl2430t ] ( http://www.pcdiga.com/2/14803/monitor-benq-24-led-xl2430t-144hz-9h-lchlb-qbe ) - 355,00 $, 
  benq xl2430t seems too expensive , and there is n't the 20t version where i live . 
  benq xl2411z is ugly . 
  asus vg248qe no idea if it 's good or not , and it 's also 50 $ more expensive than the benq . 
  so , what to choose ? 
  thanks . 
  i 've tried to google the console command , but ca n't find it . 
  how to do it ? 
  also , how do i make bots have infinite health so they do n't die ? 
  swiftkey on cm 11-20141218-nightly-i9305 not working ? 
  gets installed and shuts down instantly . 
  how to fix ? 
  i do n't like any other keyboard , and the default on cm is n't as good as swiftkey . 
  i 've tried reinstalling , reinstalling with titanium backup , nothing works . 
  why does my dell u2414h connected through displayport has a shittier image than my acer s240hlbd connected through vga ? 
  very disappointed with the new dell image . 
  i 'm using the dell connected to a sapphire hd 7950 3gb connected through displayport and the acer also connected to the same gpu but with a vga cable on the monitor converted to dvi for the gpu . 
  what 's going on ? 
  is this the real image of the dell ? 
  it sucks . 
  i started playing cs : go a in august and i 'm gold nova 4 , but i do n't have a team or play professionally because i do n't know where and how to get a team and i 'm european , i currently follow weeds and it 's fucking awesome . 
  i want to help streamers out there , get more viewers and followers . 
  i just want to have some fucking fun for now . 
  any streamers in this subreddit that want/need any help ? 
  i may be willing to help someone out depending on my schedule , and depending if you are already setup and need any sponsors or any financial help . 
  i 've recently acquired a dell u2414h , but i 'm not sure it fits me . 
  maybe it 's time to upgrade from 60hz to 120hz/144hz atleast once in my life . 
  i have an acer s240hlbd which actually i thought was better than the dell out of the box . 
  dell 's ips technology is just not what i was expecting . 
  it has actually more tearing than my old acer . 
  so , i want to upgrade i think . 
  what do you think ? 
  asus or benq ? 
  benq is ugly though . 
  why do pro players play at 1024x768 resolutions when you can see a lot more clearer at 1080p ? 
  i can see a lot more clearer at 1920x1080 . 
  i tried 1024x768 on my dell , and i ca n't even stretch the image , it 's just a square in the middle of a 24 '' monitor . 
  can anyone explain this to me ? 
  edit : switched from 1920x1080 to 1024x768 stretched and it seems i can play a lot better and hit a lot more . 
  maybe it 's a placebo effect , but i 'm seeing some chances , and it 's a lot smoother aswell even on my dell u2414h . 
  just bought a benq xl2411z but ca n't stretch at 1024 , and gpu drivers are set to stretch . 
  it was stretching on my dell u2414h , but not anymore . 
  also ca n't install drivers to use blur busters .
