  i 'm going to berlin in the 29th , and the ticket shows 18:30 , what time does the show start ? 
  i think berlin show wo n't have a pre-show . 
  ** tl ; dr : 996 still the best sounding car . 
  old 2006 987 cayman does n't sound as good as new 718 cayman . 
  as a previous owner of a 996 , let me tell you that the 911 is probably the best sounding car i 've ever driven , and it 's literally the best car i 've ever driven . 
  the handling is just the best thing i 've ever experienced . 
  now , i was never a fan of the old cayman , as i felt the back was a bit ugly , so when i saw the new 718 in miami blue i instantly fell in love . 
  it is the best looking porsche at the moment for me , but when i started reading reviews on it , i noticed that the car was better on every aspect , but reviewers were saying the sound was shittier since it was n't a na flat 6 engine . 
  i felt like paying $ 100k + with extras ( i 'm portuguese , so the car with 20k $ in extras is close to 90000 $ ( $ 100k + ) , and having a car that did n't sound like the 996 i owned was kind of a bad deal . 
  two days ago i searched for old na flat 6 engine caymans , i found 2 987 close to me and i decided to check them out and listen to them . 
  let me tell you it was disappointing compared to the 996 . 
  i heard both 987 cayman 2.7 stock exhaust and 987 cayman s 3.4 and even though the cayman s sounded better with an aftermarket exhaust , the engine sound was n't that good compared to the 996 carrera with a stock exhaust . 
  i still remember how good the 996 sounds , so i went for a test drive on the 718 boxster a few weeks ago and let me tell you that this 4 cylinder engine compared to the old na flat 6 of the 987 caymans from 2006 sounds a lot better . 
  the 718 sound is a bit more voluptuous , while the old cayman is a bit more metalic when in neutral . 
  i did n't drive the old caymans , but the new 718 was really really good . 
  you did n't quite hear the loud roar of the engine inside the cabin as it happened with the 996 , which as a daily drive car , is a plus when driving long distances and you do n't want to listen to the engine the whole trip and get an headache from hearing the engine roar for long periods of time when you just want to enjoy the car and listen to some music . 
  as of now i 'm in an impasse of waiting months for the new 718 with the extras i want and have it be my first brand new car or trying out a $ 40k old cayman for a while to see if the engine sound really changes that much , because from what i could tell with my non engineer brain , the old caymans sound worse than the new ones . 
  still trying to figure out what i want for me . 
  sorry for the long wall of text , and thank you for reading .

  sometimes it 's confusing as an healer when the tank sometimes appears on the bottom or middle of the party frame , instead of always on top . 
  is there an addon to let me configure the roles and their order ? 
  not grid though . 
  i only use that for raiding . 
  thanks . 
  i have n't leveled an alt in years , and i want to do it , but i can only seem to find that the best way to do it now is through invasions , but i do n't know if that 's still a thing or how do i do it . 
  i am a holy pala and i 've been comparing my hps to other holy palas to see what i can do better and where i can improve and where i failed and what i did wrong . 
  however , can i really compare myself to other players despite raid members being different and therefore raid damage taken , etc being different due to the new scalable raid feature ? 
  * on cenarius i do 259k hps , and another holy pala on another cenarius fight does 324k hps . 
  however , i did my fight with 13 people , 3 healers , fight took 7 + minutes . 
  and the other holy pala did his fight with 25 people , 5 healers , fight took 5 + minutes . 
  * another fight on nythendra , i with 10 people , 2 healers , i top hps with 232k hps , while other holy pala did his fight with 25 people , 5 healers , and did 264k hps below a 300k holy priest . 
  is it fair to compare hps despite the different number of people to be healed and damage taken ? 
  or am i really that bad anyway ? 
  i killed xavius hc yesterday and i did 328k hps . 
  i uploaded the logs , but it did n't ( is not ) update ( ing ) on the xavius kill , it only shows a kill that i did with the guild a week ago . 
  with a one click , i could just change my talent tree to what 's best for that specific fight . 
  is there anything around like that ? 
  example : nythendra , 1,2,2,1,2,1 , ursoc , 2,1,2,1,2,1 , so on and so forth . 
  i 'm thinking about buying a 996 or 997 , but i also like technology and the bluetooth and gps are always a must . 
  is it possible to upgrade the infotainment system for a newer porsche model ? 
  i do n't really want anything other than porsche , so after market brands like pioneer , alpine , etc , i do n't really care for . 
  hallo . 
  i travel a lot to germany to be with my girlfriend , and i would like to know if germany has a cellphone carrier that i can use that has free spotify streaming . 
  i know vodafone as a specific portugal only plan with free spotify streaming . 
  i was wondering if germany has the same . 
  so i can use it when i go there . 
  thanks !, 
  `` mom , i 'm pregnant . 
  '' , is that really it ? 
  would like to see lorelai 's reaction . 
  this just happened . 
  what the flying fuck ? 
  this happened in solo/duo . 
  i did my 10 and he did his 10 , we did n't do them together , we did n't do flex . 
  we did the games side by side , obviously we could n't duo , so i did mine and he did his , and in the end we got these ranks . 
  i probably am the rank i was given , however diamond v to silver i is a bit weird . 
  then we queue together and we get bronze , silver and gold teammates . 
  if he just queues alone , he gets plat and diamond teammates . 
  what the fuck rito ? 
  season 7 did n't develop on why negan is how he is , and i would like to know what happened for him to turn into a psycopath . 
  was he already a psycopath ? 
  was he a criminal ? 
  was he a normal person with a 9-5 job ? 
  i do n't read the comics , but any kind of backstory would be nice . 
  i have a computer who is capable of handling everything , and i would like to try vr . 
  but are there any good games yet ? 
  and from which company should i buy and what ? 
  the vr set i mean . 
  thanks . 
  i 've been playing mid/jungle main leblanc/lux amumu/vi respectively . 
  i know that leblanc/lux are n't probably the best champions to learn the game as a silver v player , so i decided to take the advice of some people and play only annie mid . 
  i started today .
