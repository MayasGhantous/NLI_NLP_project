  to intervene at the behaviour level : just do it !, 
  the more you avoid something that makes you anxious , the worse it 's going to get . 
  exposing yourself to anxiety-provoking situations is scary , but it will teach you that you can do it . 
  this , from hot_mix_pickles . 
  i have anxiety , and i 've joined the local theatre group . 
  when i got there , in between the 3 hours of class/exercise whatever , we had a small break of 15 minutes , the first weeks i just sat on the floor listening to music , while the other people were outside smoking and talking to each other , the group were 12 people . 
  i talked to none , until they talked to me , because i overthink to much and i 'm always thinking what are they going to think about me and such , and the `` social anxiety '' i had started to end . 
  well , some of it , since sometimes i could not talk and making eye contact or would just answer something like `` put the lotion in the basket '' and make the craig ferguson 's movement while he says this . 
  i 've always felt bad when we had to do some exercises when we were in a circle and each one of us had to go in the middle of the circle and say or do something . 
  ** my arms and legs would just go numb there . 
  then it was the day of presenting the play to ~ 120 people . 
  that day i was n't anxious at all . 
  i felt very surprised about that . 
  but , 5 minutes before starting , i started to be very anxious , my heart started racing , i was trying to say my lines and i 've had forgotten all of them , so the only thought i had was ** `` i 'm going to leave them here , and i 'm just going run away , and leave my stuff behind . 
  i would leave 10 people behind because of some anxiety shit . 
  so my thought after that was ** `` no , i will do this shit , and i will make this anxiety disappear . 
  a note here , i was so anxious that i started to do radio voices , accents , making radio commercials and stuff the 5 minutes before the play , like, 
  * '' [ insert random supermarket name here ] , [ make random sound like in the radio ] , 1lbs of [ random meat ] , 10 $ lbs . '', 
  '' `` hi , this is [ insert random radio name here ] , what is the song that you want to hear ? 
  `` oh i want to hear [ insert portuguese pop music name here ] . '' '', 
  so , the lights go out , i enter the stage , lay down , and i start to breath really heavily , and while i was snoring ( which was part of the scene ) , i was trying to say my lines in my head , as i was too concerned that i would fail and shit . 
  as soon as my scene starts , and i start delivering ( all my lines at this point appear in my head ) , i 'm thinking to myself ** `` i was so afraid of this shit ? 
  i 'm not nervous or anxious , and i remember my lines , fuck anxiety . 
  there were like 120 people in front of me and after the first scene is done , i go backstage and i just do this, 
  with both arms and say ** `` fuck yeah i did it , i fucking did it !, 
  '' ** and i was very calm and not anxious at all , and did the rest of the play very calm and in the end , my colleagues tell me that people were talking about me , about how good my performance has been and that kind of things . 
  i still have anxiety , but i just had to confront this shit , and i 've passed the test . 
  ** i have anxiety since i can remember , so , i fell you op . 
  * so , if you have anxiety do not ignore the situation that makes you anxious , or it will get worse when you confront it the next time . 
  * just ** confront the situation ** , and ** everything will be fine ** , trust me . 
  ** tl ; dr : i was social anxious when i joined my local theatre group , i was anxious about not beeing able to deliver at the presentation of the play , and was able to be social and deliver at the play . 
  ** i was congratulated by my colleagues and received some nice compliments . 
  if i think too much , i will just conclude that everything will be allright . 
  dubstep is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in south london , england . 
  its overall sound has been described as `` tightly coiled productions with overwhelming bass lines and reverberant drum patterns , clipped samples , and occasional vocals '' . 
  i do n't think the problem is in the router , as i can connect to a server normally ( through the console ) . 
  i do n't get disconnected or anything , i just ca n't see the servers list . 
  no , i 'm not in nz . 
  it 's a fish that is jew . 
  do n't look at the screen during an eclipse . 
  or atleast use some glasses . 
  and the dog was kung fu fighting . 
  i 'm 6 ' 4 '' aswell , and sometimes when you are walking in the street , people you do n't know from nowhere just whisper `` that guy is really tall . 
  '' , and i can hear what they are saying and that shit just pisses me off . 
  it 's even more weird when you are 6 ' 4 '' and only weight 154lbs . 
  shit . 
  you forgot the duckface .

  i 've read about cc , but did n't saw any exercises , care to explain to me better or link to it ? 
  thanks . 
  yes , i 've already got the pdf , i 've downloaded it . 
  thanks for the help . 
  thanks for the advice . 
  i do n't have to lose that much fat though , i have a little belly fat . 
  i ca n't do pull ups since i do n't have a bar , but will start doing the rest . 
  once again , thanks for the advice . 
  yes , there is , i could go in the morning , 5/6 am and do some workout there . 
  yes , i need to gain some weight . 
  the thing why i 'm not gaining weight is because i do n't have a good diet , i do n't really know what to eat and what contains high calories or high protein . 
  i think the highest calorie meal i have is 200gr cooked pasta with tuna and 500ml chocolate milk , which are like 600-800 calories . 
  i do n't eat that every day or every meal though , because i just get tired of eating the same thing nor have the appetite to eat the same thing over and over again . 
  fuck , i laughed at this for like 10 minutes because of 2nd panel . 
  thanks .
