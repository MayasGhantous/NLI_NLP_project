  i have learned my lesson and will probably not say `` i love you '' that soon , or she has to say first . 
  i just had a girlfriend in high school , because i am a shut-in and i 'm not that attractive despite what my friends say , but that 's just to increase my self-esteem and what not . 
  i went to college for a few days , and the first party that the people in my house threw i just went to my room and browsed reddit and went to sleep . 
  i hope i can find a girl that is willing to put up with my shit and let me be alone when i want to be alone while listening to coldplay , since i think that the fact of me liking and wanting to be alone sometimes can be a deal breaker . 
  i really started to talk about something that i should n't talk , well whatever . 
  thanks for your advice . 
   you are not what you drive . 
  20 year old male here . 
  i drive my dad 's subaru impreza . 
  this is my favourite car and its top speed is 260km/h . 
  218 horse power , 2.0 . 
  its color , it 's the subaru color , that blue , that the rally subarus have . 
  i love that car and i want to have it and drive it until the day i die . 
  chicks look at the car , and i feel powerfu when i 'm driving that car . 
  ** yet ** , ~ 12mpg is a lot , it was 12mpg when my dad bought the car , now we are doing ~ 23mpg , yet gas is very expensive now , and i ca n't pay 320 $ of gas per month to drive it , 10 $ per day if i wanted to go meet with my friends , since the minimum wage here is 485 $ . 
  so , now that i have the experience of driving a very powerful car , and since i know that i ca n't at the moment afford all the costs , i would easily drive a ~ 50mpg that is 50 years old with no problem . 
  my friends say `` omg , why would you want a 50 year old car that does n't make you look good ? '', 
  i say `` because it 's cheaper , and i know what is like to drive a very fast car . '', 
  thank you , good bye and goodnight . 
  ima liek damn shut up u dunno anythng ` bout 2dayz uth, 
  iama gnna go now , 2 my peepz smoke sme weedz . 
  ** edit : ** i took a lot of time typing that . 
  yeah , i was just trying to be funny , writing that way takes a lot of time and it 's hard to read . 
  if the guy was ugly it would n't matter , right ? 
  yeah , thanks for that . 
  as a 20 year old virgin male , * shit * . 
  i hope that i do n't get that awkward feeling and that the girl does n't laugh at me , otherwise i might cry or something . 
  `` ah , shit , i have to have sex again , not again , ah fml !, 
  i could be browsing reddit . '', 
  i have so much difficulty doing the `` keep your mouth shut '' . 
  i ca n't be an hypocrite , i just have to say whatever i am thinking in the moment , and i can be a fucking asshole , but meh . 
  maybe due to social anxiety or shit , i tend to speak whatever i am thinking , and feeling great , but then i start to analize later in the day and thinking if what i said was good or bad , specially if a girl i 'm fond of heard it . 
  the keep your eyes open , i think i can do it , and the phone on lock , fuck it , i do n't have anything important in my phone , but my music . 
  subconsciously i knew this , consciously not that much . 
  my 1st girlfriend in highschool when i was 15 or 16 , fucked me up . 
  i was a socially awkward penguin , had no experience , and one week after we started dating i told her that i loved her , i think that shit scared her and she broke up with me some days after , i cried beeing the immature 15 year old kid . 
  i got called ugly sometimes aswell while growing up , so that fucked me up aswell . 
  and i 'm an asocial asshole who likes to keep to himself , and is too afraid to go for the girl he likes because he is too afraid of other people laughing at him , ie : her girl friends talking about me and laughing at me . 
  i have social anxiety . 
  so , in these 4 years , i am thinking that a girl has to make the first move , otherwise i 'm too anxious to do it . 
  ** edit : ** my then girlfriend made the first move aswell , added me on hi5 after a friend of mine introduced us , got my phone number , when she broke her nose invited me to her house to watch a movie , kissed me and broke up with me . 
  i am too scared of being denied to make the first move , rejection is fucked up . 
  oh , i will be honest , if she can makes fun of me probably she is n't a good human being and that 's definitely what i was thinking , if she makes fun of me , i 'll insta-break up and move on . 
  social anxiety . 
  that 's what i thought in the first place , but then my brain started working again and now i 'm over-analyzing every thing i said . 
  i am now specially worried about what 2 girls that i 'm fond of are thinking of me . 
  one told me that it was good that i told them that , because they sometimes did n't understand why i acted so strange with them . 
  i did n't want them to stop talking to me because i may be kinda weird , `` oh , that motherfucker is socially awkward , what the fuck . 
  just leave him alone . '', 
  another thing is that if i like a girl , but i did not tell them because it was much more personal , i am so afraid of getting rejected or that other people will see me talking to a girl and say `` oh , that motherfucker is so ugly , why the fuck is he talking with her ? '', 
  and laugh at me . 
  i also told to my teacher that sometimes i may be agressive to people , but it 's not because they are being mean or because i 'm angry , it 's because i do n't want them to make fun of me or even think of me . 
  what kind of things happened after you told them that ? 
  or how they acted around you or said after that ? 
  wow , yeah , my teacher talked about therapy , that was when it hit me , `` i just fucked up badly and told them i have social anxiety , they know think i am a freak . 
  '' , if the teacher had n't said anything about therapy i would n't be thinking about this i think . 
  i am a fun loving mellow guy who goes with the flow has a good sense of humor and a loving person in general , like you , sometimes i just act angrier or maybe we can say defensively , because i do n't want to talk to someone , say something i really mean , or talking about a serious subject and be laughed at . 
  thanks man . 
  oh , your class was trying to help in a way , that 's kinda cool , but what we want is to be treated the same , i think . 
  yeah , some people shared they personal issues , one girl also said that her deceased grandparent had some affairs , got aids and died and she and her father ca n't forgive him , and that they did n't went to the funeral and do n't go to the graveyard and other shit . 
  maybe something very important to her , but i do n't think i will judge her for that , and i 'm sure i wo n't change my way of seeing her , i just see her with a very strong personality and a very strong woman , she became more attractive to me . 
  so , i would like to think , that i had the same effect on them , but this anxiety thing makes my brain think otherwise . 
  yeah , i probably will start to be nicer and to say hi to them in the morning instead of just passing by and say nothing , i will try to be a little more social and not think about what other people think of me . 
  also , i 'm not working with anyone , i just shared this , because i thought they were seeing me as somewhat arrogant and an asshole , and i have a girl there that i would like to be more than a friend , but with all this shit i do n't have the courage to talk to her , even though she is one of the most intelligent people i have ever seen and talked to . 
  she was not there today , and i think it was better , i think . 
  they were already thinking worse than i was of myself , and i noticed that , so . 
  i just want that the people i 'm fond of do n't change the way they talk to me or treat me differently because i have anxiety , that 's just it . 
  it has helped me i think , because i will try to say hi when i see them and not ignore them . 
  therapists are expensive and i do n't have the money . 
  i am trying to be more social atleast in the school with my class , because i 'm fond of a couple of girls , and i ca n't be arrogant or angry to/with them every time i wake up and i do n't feel going to school or hear anyone . 
  i hope your brothers are doing fine . 
  i 'm not in us , and the budgets in portuguese schools are very tight , they almost do n't have money to feed their students , so i 'm almost certain that they ca n't afford a counselor of some sort . 
  i 'm an atheist , and what advice do they have to give ? 
  the faith in god will heal me ? 
  sounds arsh , what i just said . 
  yeah , i will have to check on it , but i do n't want to go on and ask everyone if there is a counselor in the school , maybe i can talk to my teacher who was in the class today . 
  talking with someone who has been or is going through what i am going through might be a good way to deal with it , they could have advice to give or other things , but a priest , i do n't think so , and i 'm not even seeing me going to a church and talk to one , i do n't see me talking to a paid professional , much less going to the church . 
  oh , they are . 
  in the city i 'm living for the past 2 or 3 years , shit , fucking religious . 
  in my class , in 23 , i am the only one atheist , the 22 remaining are christian . 
  the teacher was the first saying that social anxiety is cured with therapy , maybe she knows something , i told her today in the class , since we have a book to present to the class , that when the book presentation is made , i will probably be suffering a lot , due to my anxiety , my heartbeat will be 160bpm and i will be in pain in the inside and outside i have to fake it and act like i 'm good , she said that in that case i have to talk to the teachers and say that i am uncomfortable . 
  yet , i do n't want to do that , because i 'm no less or better than anyone and i should go through what everyone is going aswell , if i have to make a presentation i will make it . 
  well , i 'm glad i have someone to talk to in the internet like you , but i probably wo n't bother you with my problems more than i 'm doing now since i do n't want to take anyones time . 
  you did ? 
  do you think this is just a phase due to beeing a teenager and having shitty problems , like `` oh a girl does n't like me , i 'm depressed '' or you think this is a thing that can remain until i 'm older ? 
  thanks for taking this time to talk . 
  i know that in theory , but please tell that to the part of my brain that needs to know that . 
  i know it 's easy to talk and say that i should go out and instead of being afraid of being made fun of , make fun of me and enjoy life , yet , i ca n't do it , and yeah , in 100 years maybe no one will remember me , but that is a thing that i ca n't put inside of my head and be happy , the amount of anxiety is too much , and sometimes staying at home and not dealing with anyone is prefered . 
  i will , i will try . 
  i have thought in going to the doctor and ask for some pills , but yet , lack of courage and confidence has made me always stay at home and say `` well , another day . '', 
  anyway , thanks for the advice . 
  but, 
   that feel when you have a problem, 
  i do n't want it . 
  ah , i hope too , there is a girl in my class i would like so much to talk to , she is so intelligent , but the thought of having everyone laugh at me , just makes me want to say `` fuck it . '', 
  and not do it , yet , today you made me see that this is not bad and that i should fight anxiety and make a better life for me . 
  thank you very much . 
  david shore asked if she wanted to continue working on house , she declined and went on work with david shore and katie jacobs on another thing with her boyfriend at the moment , david cross , better known , as tobias funk\u00eb on arrested development or as his character used to call himself aswell , uncle t-bag . 
  20 year old male and yesterday i discovered the real reason i do n't have a girlfriend , and it is , that , i , have , social anxiety and sometimes people see me as an arrogant and asshole person , a girl from my class after i told her that i have social anxiety and sometimes i do n't talk to the class because i have a feeling that they will laugh at me said , `` oh so that 's why you acted strange with us so many times . 
  '' , and it clicked .
