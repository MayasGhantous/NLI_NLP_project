  can you give me some tips on what i should eat instead of almost just bread ? 
  it 's easy for me to eat bread because 2 slices are 130 calories , and 20 or 22 slices are like 80 cents . 
  oats are pretty cheap too , 400g are 60 cents , milk and cheese are the only things that are fucking expensive . 
  also i probably wo n't eat all of this bread and milk everyday for every meal , since as i said i will have normal lunch and dinner meals . 
  thanks . 
  i will be able to probably get some whey protein , and i am already tired of eating like this , i stopped eating like this about 2 weeks ago , but as i said i will buy a blender to not have to eat all this bread and start eating more oats and easier . 
  i think pasta is easier to eat than rice in larger amounts , but rice is good too . 
  i struggle to eat vegetables aswell . 
  i got a bit constipated a week ago , and that 's aswell i 've stopped eating that much bread , milk and cheese . 
  thanks . 
  jesus fucking christ , eating eggs and bacon , it 's too fucking expensive here to eat every day . 
  also , do you have any before-after pictures ? 
  i would like to see what i can become if i eat and lift a lot . 
  those 20lbs were visible or was just stomach fat like i have now ? 
  i have skinny arms , no chest , but my stomach has fat . 
  ah that 's cool , i 've never seen a change from skinny to big in a person of my height . 
  and i hope if i have the same gains as you , since i 'm thinking of starting lifting next month or in june to gain those 20lbs you gained aswell , and i hope that i can fill my clothes and look healthier . 
  and yeah , girls mirin my weight change . 
  that 's what i want at the moment , i 'm sure i 'm pretty weak , and i 'm just going to aim for strength and then looks , and i 'll probably only do ss this summer , and then when my strength is established and i can lift heavy , i will then get a routine that can make me look better . 
  also , what was your routine ? 
  i think that 's my max in bench press , maybe less . 
  how much strength gain did you get during those 3 months along with the 20lbs ? 
  was that big of a change ? 
  did you follow a weight change like ss or you just kept adding weight as long as you felt comfortable with it ? 
  also , from 165lbs to 210lbs , during 3 years , were consistent , or did you get a break from lifting , since people say i wo n't be able to gain 40lbs / 50lbs in a year , but maybe in 3-4 years . 
  ah , that 's cool . 
  i hope i have gains similar to yours , i would be very happy . 
  anyway , thanks for the advice and tips man . 
  appreciated . 
  conan said some years ago in inside the actors studio that leno was a great guy and it was really good to be with him , that he made people comfortable and that sort of things , i wonder what he would say now , and probably how the perception of hollywood to him changed , since leno was probably considered a friend to him by the time he started to host the tonight show , and i probably think that before everything that happened in 2010 , he thought that no one or atleast him had to be ready for that sort of thing . 
  nice progress , but the 3 years ago did n't seem 165lbs , it seemed more , since i 'm 165lbs and i do n't look like that at all . 
  anyway , if i could look like you in the 3 months pic , in my 3 months of lifting , i would be so fucking happy , great progress and difference , but it seems that you had more weight than me in the 1st pic , i think my arms are skinnier than yours . 
  quickly , to the death mobile !, 
  i would really like to do this aswell , but what time do you go to bed the day before to wake up at 4:30 -5:00 ? 
  i hope she did realized by now , because if she was my daughter , i 'm sorry op , but i would fucking punch her in the fucking face .

  not here !, 
  i 'm 6 ' 4 '' , 165lbs , 20 years old , and here is what i 'm going to eating for bulking , will try to do it every day . 
  there 's this girl in my class , damn , i 've went to school on november again , i did n't looked at her the first time i saw her , looked at her friend , but when she opened her mouth and talked to me , oh man , i instantly liked her . 
  since november we talked a couple of times and atleast i had a great time , yet , and wanting to ask her out since then , never did , 6 months later , still have n't got the courage to do it , and probably wo n't do it . 
  i used to catch her looking at me a lot , when i was new in the class , now , i never do , oh well . 
  that feel . 
  yeah , i know what are you feeling , but i have social anxiety and if i had to ask the girl i 'm fond of out , i think i would faint like a pokemon . 
   my heart goes crazy and my words get caught up in my mouth and i sound like an idiot . 
  i am like you , even a simple `` hi '' , makes me think `` oh shit , did i say that well ? 
  why does this happen to all of reddit but me ? 
  i would be very happy , if i knew , that a girl had a crush on me . 
  even if it was just a crush . 
  news ? 
  how much waiting you talk about and what is it ? 
  is it like months time , or psychological time until they get over the ex ? 
   noticing body language and shit i never even noticed years ago, 
  ca n't do this , because i think , i misunderstand whatever the fuck they are saying . 
  sometimes i mock the girl i 'm fond of , and i feel bad right instantly after . 
  i am fucking 20 years old , makes me feel like a stupid high school kid . 
  i 'm 20 , 6 ' 4 '' , 165lbs , so imagine a awkward tall skinny guy . 
  i can be funny , but all my friends can be funny . 
  and the gym membership , i will start next month or in june , i was already with that on my mind . 
  yet , i do n't really like to party , i prefer to stay at home watching a movie or something like that . 
  my friends like to go out and go to clubs and bars , i do n't , but yet , we can have a nice conversation when we are at someone 's house . 
  i get anxious inside a club or a bar , there 's nothing to do , ca n't talk . 
  but yeah , the gym thing , i will do it as soon as possible . 
  thanks for the tips man . 
   i just say really inappropriate shit that sounds funny in my mind but comes out awful . 
  this happens to me too . 
  it 's even more terrifying when you were in middle school and high school and you were called ugly and bullied and shit . 
  my friends say i 'm attractive and that my height favors me . 
  i just do n't see it , and whenever i find a girl attractive , i follow a advice a aunt gave me some time ago `` girls have to chase you , you do n't have to chase them . 
  '' , which follows to me being alone since like 2008 . 
  i do n't know man , i have a friend who is very good looking and has n't had a relationship for a long time . 
  society fucking sucks , people want equality , but no girl asks a guy out , or they do , just not me and you , well , fuck that , we still got reddit . 
  this is shit i do n't get . 
  girls flirt with you , or atleast from what i read , they seem to flirt , and then they come up with some boyfriend you have never heard of . 
  what the fuck is this ? 
  i hope you do n't get in trouble for these girls being crazy . 
  really , who does this ? 
  i remember when i was in high school , this girl hold hands with me , hugged me , that motherfucking shit , and when i told a friend of hers what we were doing and i told her i kinda liked her , she said `` girl is making out with a guy in whatever place . '' . 
  i was so fucking disappointed , but fuck that . 
  also , this girl i 'm fond of , i know that she does n't have a boyfriend , i think she never had a boyfriend , she used to look at me a lot , great smile , one time we were sitting together , and we had that leg rub connection thing , in each of us were touching the leg of each other but did n't move , yeah , that , had great conversations for as long as i can tell , and when i see her with a guy , i fucking go ffffffffuuuuuuuccccccccckkkkkkkk ! , hoping that she is n't dating anyone , and if she does , i hope not for the sake of me , why would she be so fucking friendly to me and not do anything ?
