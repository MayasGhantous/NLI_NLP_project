  anyway , sometimes it rains at night , so we might need to use the glass to protect them from breaking . 
  even without water , it will can damage right ? 
  like the magnifying glass and sun , it can kill an ant . 
  yes , i understood that , but imagine that we have a 1 or 2 weeks storm , it would not be good for the plant to stay indoors that much time . 
  as for the glass , it really depends on the weather , but since i live far away from where we are growing the plants i ca n't see them every day , only 1 day a week , every two weeks , so i do n't know how is the weather in his town . 
  but the glass will only be kept when we have bad weather , when we have bright sun and hot days we will take it off , otherwise it will kill the plant . 
  anyway , thanks for your time and advices . 
  really appreciated . 
  thanks . 
  and he 's back !, 
  where can i buy that mug ? 
  and now hugh laurie stars in my favourite tv show , house md. 
  i do n't like clubs either , but let me know a party where you can hear any other genre than house music , or any other electronic shit that people hear now , because you are lucky let me tell you if you hear other genre in other home parties you go because every party or every person i know that does a home party , just listens to this electronic shit . 
  really , fuck this . 
  ah , okey , i thought every glass could burn like a magnifying glass . 
  thanks for the information . 
  it 's michael scofield . 
  you must be so fucking excited , that you are n't going to sleep tonight . 
  congratulations man . 
  oh , major studio , portal : the movie . 
  major studio feature ? 
  oh , shit , take my money . 
  no , that 's clearly joel mchale , jason bateman is the one who played ned in game of thrones . 
  thanks , but even so , the plant is n't growing at all , it stopped growing . 
  is this available worldwide ? 
  we have n't done anything except giving it water . 
  a colleague said to me to give some organic nutrients and to buy them from a store , but my friend wants to do them homemade . 
  so we do n't really know what to do , my friend also said that we should let it die , and just keep the critical one . 
  yeah , and it 's really small compared to critical . 
  thanks for the tips . 
  we bought a 10 litres bag of soil for 1.50 $ . 
  okey , thanks . 
  thanks for the tips . 
  i do n't know where to get mykos tho . 
  i 've asked my friend and he said he does n't know , he also said it 's the worst soil ever existent . 
  i am looking for offers . 
  well , everything that 's the value of those two consoles . 
  no , thanks . 
  no thanks , i 'm not interested in games . 
  yes , i just had the confirmation , he transplanted to the same soil , only to a bigger vase . 
  is n't this hipocrisy ? 
  how did we get the plant ? 
  how come ? 
  we 've bought some seeds . 
  we ca n't clone from the dying plant right ? 
  they are all female . 
  she really likes to talk . 
  if the soil is the problem , and using common sense , transplanting a plant to the same soil only to a bigger vase wo n't solve any problem , ** if ** in this case the soil is causing the problem . 
  anyway , i 'll post some pics in a minute . 
  okey , here are the pics . 
  from left to right, 
  first image - critical and newly transplanted to a bigger vase but same soil dying big buddha automatic . 
  second image - rumoring dying critical from what my friend just told me . 
  third image - some dots on critical leaves , do n't know what this is , but maybe some nutrient deficiency ? 
  fourth image - smaller and older pot , with the ** newly fresh fruit ** ( wtf ? ), 
  from the fifth image with the soil of the big buddha automatic that was transplanted to a bigger vase . 
  fifth image - organic trash made by my friend with ** newly fresh fruit ** ( wtf ? ), 
  also , what is happening with the critical one ? 
  it has some brighter dots on the leaves , maybe a nutrient deficiency ? 
  this is our first time , but since i do n't live close to him , he wants to do it by himself , like if he knew everything what he is doing . 
  anyway , do you think we can give this to the plant for nutrients ? 
  thanks . 
  we live in europe , i do n't think we have fox farms in our country , nor in the neighbour countries . 
  he already killed one plant , another big buddha automatic we had for overwatering , and if i try to talk to him he will be very offended because i 'm far away and he is the only one who is taking care of the plants , but he wants me to pay for everything , like nutrients , and other shit . 
  i just hope he does n't fuck up the critical one , which seems it 's the one that 's going better , i 'm really concerned on what he can do to the plants , since i want to smoke due to its medicinal effects for anxiety . 
  the only thing i can do now is try to buy a nutrient fertilizer and give it to the plants , hoping that they will grow healthy . 
  no , thanks . 
  it 's not rotten fruit , i must say , it 's ** newly fresh fruit ** . 
  but yeah , he left it to compost . 
  the compost is beeing made in the vase , from what he said to me , is this a problem ? 
  he says it 's a lot of fruit and vegetables and a layer of soil in the top . 
  edit : here is the image , http://imgur.com/6z3q3&amp;kioai&amp;t0tb2&amp;uqxigl&amp;eorue?full . 
  well , i do n't know what he used specificaly , since i was not there , but i asked if he used fresh fruit and he said yes , it must be apples , pears and for the vegetables maybe cabages , i really do n't know . 
  i told him this , and this is what he said :, 
  `` are you fucking kidding me ? 
  people told me to put chunks of food in the soil to speed up the process , if i slice it smaller , there will be more bacterias , atleast it was what i saw . '', 
  okey , thanks , can you give me that link please ? 
  i want to show it to him . 
  message me the computer parts you have , like gfx 's , and specs of the several older computers please . 
  thanks . 
  * a nice hot cup of shut the fuck up . 
  this . 
  fuck , this is fucking hilarious . 
  good luck on that man , naughty dog is one of my favourite videogame companies . 
  what tv show was your dog on ? 
  it seems she has already won an emmy . 
  yeah , i learnt this from watching house md. 
  the true friend is the one who did n't even reply with a thank you to the guy who offered his star wars account . 
  * oh , i see what you did there . 
  and this game is fucking awesome , i ca n't complete the 300 missions though , and get the judge , since i 'm missing an item for the last mission . 
  yeah , and not a fuck was given . 
  this made me laugh more than it should . 
  i 'm 19 , and got my license two months ago . 
  i do n't have android nor anything related with that , is there any way to open it on windows , maybe with an emulator ? 
  i 'm european so the minimum age requirement for getting your license is 18 , but anyway if any other european rule is the same as the usa ones , be careful with the speeds , because in here you have a temporary license for 3 years and if you get a ticket in these 3 years you may have your license revoked , and you have to repeat the driving exam again . 
  yeah , i would like to use a cane aswell . 
  i want 2012 to happen , or that a virus like the one from resident evil or the walking dead spreads so i could drive a very fast car while shooting some zombies , and then go to a store to pick up some food , smoke marijuana , and then have sex with a smoking hot woman , in the end cuddle , and then go back to the beginning and repeat . 
  or as op , the complete collapse of civilization . 
  * shit * , i laughed a lot . 
  that 's so fucking creepy , that a tear came out of my eye .
