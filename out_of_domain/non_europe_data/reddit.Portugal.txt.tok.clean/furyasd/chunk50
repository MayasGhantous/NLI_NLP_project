  thanks , my trainer said my form was good , so i probably do n't know that 's it . 
  i 've been reading , and i think i got a rotator cuff tear . 
  i think i need to go to the doctor , and i hope it 's not serious . 
  symptoms are ,, 
  pain in the shoulder and arm , which varies depending on how serious the tear is . 
  weakness and tenderness in the shoulder . 
  difficulty moving the shoulder , especially when trying to lift your arm above your head . 
  snapping or crackling sounds when moving the shoulder . 
  inability to sleep on the shoulder . 
  i have all but the 2nd and 3rd . 
  fuck cracker nigger cunt you . 
   the show is written so they literally act the part . 
  acting . 
  since i 'm only starting , i 'm afraid that this will make my improvements slower than they would be if i was okey . 
  i 'm 6 ' 4 '' , 165lbs , want to gain some weight , and i do n't want to stop lifting only after 2 or 3 days . 
  and i do n't even bench that much , only 80lbs . 
  but this shoulder pain comes from a very long time , but i never looked at it because i never did any exercise . 
  i will probably use the same weight i 'm using at the moment , or lower a bit . 
  probably from 80lbs on bench press to 70lbs , maybe less . 
  let 's see . 
  thanks . 
  thanks for the tips , will look into it . 
  i hope i have n't fucked up the shoulder that bad , since it only hurt yesterday a bit and today again . 
  have n't had a problem in years . 
  i hope not because i still need some time to lift to achieve my goals , and one year wo n't do it , i think . 
  besides the warm up routine for the shoulders did you go to the doctor or did you take anything prescribed by the doctor ? 
  i will probably go see a doctor , if this happens tomorrow again , while i workout . 
  i do n't think i have anti-inflammatory pills at home , but let 's see what happens tomorrow . 
  thanks . 
  do you approve of [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7187yqpq6i ) ? 
  i 'll probably do this tomorrow before the workout . 
  i think i prefer alcohol aswell , but i do n't know , i 'm getting old for this shit , at 20 years old , i ca n't drink , and the next day be `` shit , why . '', 
  probably because when i get drunk , i usually sleep like 4 or 5 hours in the house of a friend , so that 's probably it . 
  anyway , instead of alcohol , i prefer staying sober . 
  i do n't hate math , when i solve an exercise it 's fucking awesome . 
  math is cool . 
  i just do n't have the time to study it . 
   final fantasy . 
  you know your shit , son . 
  i put some of her musics in my ipod , when i had one , like poker face , bad romance , telephone , they were quite catchy , but after a while it gets boring . 
  i 've seen a youtube video of her singing and playing piano when she was younger and known as steffani . 
  yeah , she is talented . 
  if i was an actor , i would probably never do shakespeare , because it would be so fucking hard to do it . 
  fuck that . 
  i 've watched the godfather i , the godfather ii and the godfather iii . 
  the godfather i , i watched it without italian subtitles maybe that 's why i lost a lot of the movie , dialogues and other stuff , yet very well made , fucking marlon brando acts that shit . 
  the godfather ii and the godfather iii are awesome . 
  also , 2001 : a space odyssey . 
  man , fuck that movie . 
  so brilliant , so fucking great . 
  yet , i had to stop 2 or 3 times during the film because there was nothing going on in there . 
  just people in space . 
  but let me tell you , fucking stanley kubrick knows his shit , and that film is a fucking masterpiece . 
  she is cute . 
  i do n't watch the normal championship or the league games or whatever . 
  but this year , because of the euro , i 've watched the games with my dad . 
  pretty cool actually , but watching the games every weekend for the leagues , nah , fuck that shit . 
  also , the theatrics , so much overacting . 
  i used to be an handball player , and even if i got a punch to the face , or even if i had fallen to the ground and hurt me like shit , i would just stand up and keep playing . 
  fuck getting pushed in the back and putting your hands on your face saying you got punched . 
  i watched it the first time , it was cool . 
  i watched it the second time , i was like , oh yeah , that makes sense because you had already seen it the first time and you knew what was going on . 
  just the people who were in charge of that decision . 
  i do n't like queen at all . 
  yeaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh !, 
  i think inception was meh . 
  or maybe i did n't understand the movie . 
  but they had 3 layers of dreams . 
  he was with his wife in one . 
  when he woke up he was alone . 
  or maybe i watched it wrong . 
  probably should watch it again . 
  ** her : i like that song , who is it . 
  ** me : it is rush **, 
  ** her : how can you stand to listen to that republican music ? 
  johnny depp owns that shit . 
  i was looking at the apes , and thinking , `` oh , these are n't real apes , these are people in costumes . '', 
  also , `` you can clearly see that that is a set . '', 
  that probably is n't true . 
  as an atheist , i read that , as , `` i 'm not on my own , but belong -- to my family and friends . 
  they are there when i need them , and when i fuck up things . 
  they are there to tell me when i fuck up and to cheer me up . 
  because i belong to them , and they belong to me , i assure that i will have a long and happy life , and that i will live for them and for me . '',

  i ca n't actually tell funny stories , i get the thing in my head where the story is hilarious , but when i start telling it , it 's not . 
  craig ferguson said it happens to him a lot of times . 
  yet , sometimes i can be the guy that comes up with the perfect thing to say and everybody laughs . 
  and second yet , i have no social skills whatsoever . 
  orgasms aswell ? 
  about memory , i actually read something that might be useful in the long term . 
  i ca n't quote a source because i do n't remember it anymore . 
  anyway , i read that if you try to forget things , it can cause you alzheimer 's down the road . 
  an example of that , is something that has appeared often on reddit . 
  people that know a person and know everything about their lives but tend to say they do n't when they meet said person because they do n't want to be seen as creepers . 
  that trying to forget or saying that you do n't know things about whatever , can make your brain really try to forget that stuff and cause some stuff on the brain , i do n't know what , and it can cause you alzheimer 's when you are older . 
  sorry , that i ca n't quote a source , if anyone has it , please share . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** trying to forget things might lead to alzheimer 's later in life . 
  and iiiiiiiiii ^ iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii ^ iiiiiiiii ^ iiii , will always love youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu ^ uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu ^ uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu ^ uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu !,
