  i 'm not the dad !, 
  i 'm on fire ! '', 
  `` i do n't like you chloe ! '', 
  `` i do n't like you too kim ! '', 
  `` well fuck you then ! '', 
  `` fuck you too ! '', 
  - `` damn , this shit is too hilarious !, 
  where are my cheetos ? '', 
  not dating a girl because of a guy who will probably never met in your lifetime is extremely dumb , but i get you . 
  but hating on bieber who never insulted anyone , never did anything wrong , but take care of his life and do what he likes , i really do n't see the point on insulting and hating the kid . 
  if i could do what he does , i would . 
  no i do n't, 
  i do n't even pretend to do this . 
  i 'm bad at that shit , i 'm not going to pretend and say `` oh hey nice to see you , it 's [ weather status for today ] , did you see [ news about politics that are screwing the whole world ] , ah fuck that [ name of politician ] . '', 
  i ca n't do that . 
  so i do n't . 
  yeah , and i do n't have the skills for small talk . 
  so i prefer to stay quiet and say nothing . 
  by the way , what is the first star wars movie that i should watch ? 
  another thing i ca n't pretend . 
  music for me is sacred . 
  i ca n't listen to wub wub or house shitty music . 
  fuck that . 
  try using headphones . 
  that 's how i got a girl from my class to stop talking to me . 
  and yeah , i was interested in her . 
  i do n't even know on what i 'm in on if that makes any sense . 
  i just do n't know !, 
  you do n't have a bit of the script for any reason , right ? 
  i would like to see a script . 
  and wet . 
  but like gaining weight , it should n't be a carb/fat/protein type of diet ? 
  if i want to gain weight , i should eat [ x number of calories ] + [ 1g of protein per lbs of bodyweight ] right ? 
  what about cutting ? 
  should n't it be like eat 1500 calories and 20g fat , 10g carbs , 100g protein ? 
  i 'm asking because i do n't know how cutting is made . 
  i 'm trying to gain weight . 
  i do squats without a squat or power rack , because my gym has none . 
  i am . 
  so the macros are important on gaining weight . 
  are the macros as important while cutting ? 
  that 's what i 'm trying to ask . 
  what if it happens again ? 
  should i go to the doctor and ask for anti-depressive pills ? 
  local legend in my city is me . 
  we had a local theatre thing here , and i was the lead role . 
  people asked if i was a professional actor . 
  so yeah , i 'm a fucking celebrity . 
  deal with it . 
  apart from that , nothing happens here . 
  can you give input on my numbers ? 
  i do n't know if you can without pics to compare , but i 'm 6 ' 4 '' , 165lbs . 
  squat 80lbs, 
  barbell row 85lbs, 
  deadlift 70lbs, 
  bench press 95lbs, 
  this is the second week of sl 5x5 . 
  thanks . 
  also , michelle williams who played marilyn monroe said that marilyn monroe was a character of marilyn monroe . 
  she was not that glamorous , sexy and confident when alone . 
  it was all a character . 
  i do n't know how to film alone . 
  so i ca n't post form checks . 
  i have to find a way on how to do that . 
  thanks . 
  i 'm 6 ' 4 '' , 165lbs , what do you recommend instead of ss/sl ? 
  gain weight/strength at the moment . 
  i really do n't care about aesthetics at the moment , since i 'm underweight for my height . 
  greyskull is the same as ss/sl , but with neck harnesse 's . 
  i already do bb curls on the a day , so , it 's okey for now . 
  yeah , this is what i discovered from myself aswell . 
  thanks for the info . 
  i 'm 6 ' 4 '' , and my wingspan is probably  6 ' 4 '' , today i took the bar to the chest , and arms at 90 degrees , my shoulders started to pop . 
  thanks for the tips , will change the way i bench press now . 
  thanks . 
  yeah , i 'm doing bb curls on a days , which are the days that i bench press . 
  do n't know what to do on b days though . 
  yeah , squatting 3 times a week and not working the arms seems unfair for the upper body . 
  thanks for the tips though . 
  thanks man , it did . 
  and the second way of doing it below nipple line seems a lot more natural , above nipple line seems a stiff position , while below it seems a more smooth and natural movement . 
  thanks . 
  now a bullshit comment about how you are right about what the guy above you said , just for karma . 
  play wow like me .
