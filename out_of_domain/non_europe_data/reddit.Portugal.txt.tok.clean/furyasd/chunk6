  he actually likes to solve puzzles ( or the disease from which the patient might be infected ) , but hugh laurie once said that he likes to think that house really cares , i like to think that too . 
  anyway , house md is my favourite tv show .

  someone made that while high . 
  bradley cooper also asked a question to robert deniro . 
  what is this ? 
  and this is good . 
  in fact , a quote from imdb ,, 
  `` while modeling , she attended acting classes , as her real dream and ambition was to be an actress . 
  in 1984 , she landed herself a small part in one episode of `` as the world turns '' ( 1956 ) as a young d\u00e9butante named bunny . 
  her first big break , however , was being cast by brian de palma in the bruce springsteen video `` dancing in the dark '' . '', 
  costco ? 
  i was hoping this kind of behavior was only in walmart , well i guess i was wrong . 
  school starts tomorrow in my country i think , but i 'm going to college , so no school for me , until the next week . 
   completely fictional person, 
  no , it 's proven that every person you see in your dreams , you have seen in real life , despite you remembering that person or not . 
  yeah , sorry for that , but i think you can see what it is . 
  yeah , that shit looks like a kit-kat . 
  that retangular thing that looks like a fucking kit-kat . 
  i know that , i only took 2 puffs of that , and it tasted like shit . 
  yeah , that 's what i thought , my colleague bought this , i think 10 grams or more for 13 $ . 
  thanks . 
  no , only nausea .

  no one irl wants to talk about movies with me , so if you want to talk about movies with me on the internet , yes , i would be up for it . 
  `` are you mohammed '' , made it for me . 
  thanks . 
  i have anxiety when i go to a bar or a club , so i never go . 
  my `` friends '' go to bars or clubs 1 or 2 times a week , and every time they say they want to get drunk . 
  i 've stopped hanging out with them . 
  well , all the people i knew that were in my class from the 10th to 12nd grade , i have stopped talking to them and them to me , because they could n't stand honesty . 
  one of my best friends ( the only friend i have ) ca n't stand honesty either , if he does anything wrong , i ca n't be honest with him and tell him he did wrong , but have to tell him he did good , otherwise he would be pissed . 
  i wonder if i only do this because he is my only friend . 
  i suspect it is . 
  i personally do n't like [ fake nails ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_lhy1cojzgow/tqzyczevpoi/aaaaaaaadjo/o3jvoj5zp4i/s1600/acrylic-nails.jpg ) , it 's just a big turn off . 
  girl i made out with says : `` i think i 'm falling in love with you . '', 
  me : `` then we should date . '', 
  girl : `` yes , we should . '', 
  1 week after . 
  girl : `` i 'm sorry , we have to break up . '', 
  all by text messages .

  now you can name yourself the batman !, 
  i 'm still a fetus , 19 years old . 
   2 ) you can never be too honest . 
  this is true , you can never be too honest , otherwise you will end up without friends . 
  yeah , that happened with me . 
  too bad , you !, 
  are fired . 
  do n't know if you are going to see this , since it 's going to be buried but i used to be like you . 
  if anyone needed a ride i would provide , if anyone needed food i would provide , but i stopped doing this and like you i never asked anything in return because i thought i had friends , but no , when i needed something , like 2 $ to buy a bread and a juice for breakfast at school , needed a ride home ( where friends lived 100 meters from me ) or just needed to ** talk ** to a friend , everyone did n't have money or time to listen . 
  now i say fuck them all , and i hang out alone . 
  this `` console '' gives me anxiety .
