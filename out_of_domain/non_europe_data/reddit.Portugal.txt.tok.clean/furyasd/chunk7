  [ ] ( / poker ), 
  treat your mom nicely !, 
  do you have any before surgery x-rays that i can see ? 
  did you use any kind of vest to fix the curvature before the surgery ? 
  thank you . 
  for how long did you used it ? 
  did n't fix even a little bit ? 
  i 'm not american so i do n't know what grade is junior high , so how long was your surgery ? 
  thanks . 
  surgery was how many years ago ? 
  thank you for answering . 
  i hope everything goes well with you . 
  my sister has scoliosis aswell , and i 'm worried about this , since she has the back brace aswell , and her spine looks like an s. 
  she is only 15 , 16 in 3 months , and i was hoping that the back brace would fix her without surgery . 
  not that the surgery would n't fix , but the thought of anyone messing around on a fragile thing as the spine just makes me worry so much . 
  thank you again . 
  what agency was that ? 
  thank you . 
  she also goes swimming almost every day due to doctor 's advice . 
  he said it can also help fixing the spine . 
  gon na get down on friday . 
  i do n't have brown paper lunchbags at the moment , but you just made me want to try this now in the microwave . 
  is there any way of doing it without the lunchbag ? 
  thanks . 
  i 've used a mashed potato powder box ( cereal box type ) to put it on the microwave . 
  some came out a bit brown , others came out normal white . 
  i hope the box does not have any kind of chemicals since i 'm already eating the popcorn i 've made . 
  shit * is * about to go down . 
  * mac and cheese, 
  * dr pepper, 
  * mountain dew, 
  * lucky charms, 
  * pop tarts,

  i 'm missing something , but i ca n't remember now , well just let me know if you can do these and how we will do it . 
  thanks .

  i would like to taste a american one . 
  and may the force be with you .

  to be honest , i do n't really think we have that much to offer , everything is imported . 
  some big chain supermarket companies make theire own chocolate , but it 's just meh , it 's good and cheap , but i think it would be a waste of money to send these to you , since yeah you have everything there . 
  yeah , but i have to try those . 
  oh shit , yeah , i was only thinking about chocolates and things similar to that . 
  yeah , i rarely drink wine , but yeah a lot of people like '' [ vinho do porto ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-j8qzojpp9qg/taeq0erabhi/aaaaaaaaano/vsvvgefsqxa/s1600/porto.jpg ) '',
