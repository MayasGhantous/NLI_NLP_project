   also , props for a personal trainer who , while not an expert or master , is at least knowledgeable and willing to teach the deadlift . 
  yeah . 
  there 's a pt on my gym , that said while i was doing deadlift , that i should n't do deadlift , but instead do stiff-legged deadlift on the top of a step bench . 
  i just want to tell you , thanks . 
  emma watson is perfect . 
  and we like her that way , now get out !, 
  like emma , emma , emma , uuuuuuh !, 
  like emma , emma , emma , uuuuuuh !, 
  i thought you 'd always be mine ( mine ), 
   when harry potter came out, 
  she was 11 . 
  are you a fucking retard ? 
  no , tell me , are you a fucking retard ? 
  i have n't been watching that much the office , but what happened to andy ? 
  i do n't like him anymore , he is now arrogant as fuck . 
  by the way , is this the last season of the office ? 
  jim is going to have a sports business and will have to move . 
  i stopped seeing after steve carrell left , just caught up now , and i really like the premiere , i think the thing jim has going on is cool , the whole sports thing , i would really like to see where this is going , other than that , andy is a fucktard now , and today 's episode , or atleast , the one i watched today , i sensed that ed helms , when he had a scene with ellie kemper ( erin ) , that he was trying to much to be like michael , the pauses , the camera looks , and he just does n't fit into that , also , the jokes are n't that great . 
  oh , i did n't catch that , thanks . 
  i 'm 20 . 
  i grew with game consoles everywhere , i had pokemon , i had a playstation and a playstation 2 , i had game boy color and game boy advance sp . 
  from very young that i started playing games , so yeah , i actually like to spend my time , alone , aswell , at home , reading reddit , interesting threads on reddit , learning something , or just , at the moment , play wow . 
  i have friends that live 35 miles away from me , and due to this economy , i do n't see them that often , maybe 1 or 2 times a month , and when i see them , it 's like we never stopped talking . 
  so , it 's probably not that common what we do , but it 's certainly not that weird . 
  the way i socialize has nothing to do with clubs and/or other things that involve noise and money spending . 
  i do n't like to go to clubs , so i do n't go to them . 
  now , what i do with my friends is this , they come to my house , i go to theirs , we talk about shit , and now , since we are 20 , and have no money , we cook food at home , instead of going out . 
  a nice conversation and a good 4am dinner , is much better then going out to clubs and spend money i wish saved to buy a used 300 $ car , that i need . 
  we are 20 , but it seems like we are 70 , and we like to be at home , sharing war stories and eating . 
  yet , i fucking love to be alone , at home , reading reddit , and playing wow . 
  also , watching films and tv shows . 
  i must be jew . 
  but that 's why people not knowing the benefits and qualities of a plant that makes them think that this plant is very harmful and will kill you if you smoke it . 
  there 's no education in this , people just think that cannabis is just one thing , and that there are n't other products made from it . 
  like the study they made , they said people smoke cannabis . 
  wrong , they smoke something made out of the oil of the cannabis plant , which the one that is sold on the street is cut with shit . 
  but in usa there are a lot of people fighting for the legalization of the plant , and in some states it 's already legal . 
  well i like her , so you have to deal with it !, 
  ^ edit : ^ she ^ talked ^ about ^ people ^ not ^ liking ^ the ^ way ^ she ^ dresses ^ or ^ her , ^ because ^ she ^ sometimes ^ seems ^ too ^ girly ^ in ^ [ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvrr1_rrsgw&amp;feature=relmfu] ( here ) . 
  ^ i ^ like ^ her , ^ she ^ is ^ fucking ^ adorable , ^ and ^ i ^ would ^ date ^ her , ^ and ^ pay ^ for ^ all ^ her ^ meals ^ on ^ our ^ date . 
  ^ she ^ likes ^ to ^ dress ^ more ^ girly , ^ and ^ i ^ think ^ that 's ^ fine . 
  do not fucking bring coldplay into this !, 
  where the fuck did you saw this ? 
  fucking chris martin seems humble as fuck , and the rest of coldplay aswell , but gwyneth paltrow just seems fucking arrogant . 
  also , i think she said she did n't like green eyes or moses from coldplay . 
  well , she 's wrong . 
  as a redditor said [ above ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/11oqoj/what_celebrity_do_you_have_an_irrational_hatred/c6obffk ) , she is probably that way , because she grew in that environment , she grew up very privileged , and does n't know how people live in the `` normal/real world '' without money and all that shit . 
  but angelina jolie also was the daughter of an actor , and she is probably now in africa feeding orfan black kids , or even adopting an entire city of kids . 
  also , chris martin seems humble as fuck . 
  but did you look at her boobs ? 
  so good . 
  for natalie portman , i would have all the time in the world . 
  jesus , i read your first two sentences , and i thought i was like you . 
  i read the edit , and i 'm you . 
  i was bullied aswell , got called ugly and that i 've got a huge nose , however , my friends tell me i 'm good looking and that i 'm just stupid . 
  the rest of what you said from i 've always been bullied to the last three words `` your social skills '' apply to me . 
  atleast i 'm not fucking alone on this shit . 
   ding ding ding +1 for researching stuff on the internet, 
  this shit right here , is in the back of my head for when i get a girlfriend , the fingers hook and the spongy mass , yep , it will be saved on my head for when i get a girlfriend . 
  one thing you must remember is that you touched your mother 's vagina . 
  i claim jackhammered, 
  hands up now \\ o /, 
  oh boy a new bike, 
  oh boy a playstation, 
  oh boy a gameboy color, 
  oh boy a playstation 2, 
  oh boy a gameboy advance sp, 
  updownupdownupdownupdownupdownupdownupdownupdownupdownupdownupdownupdown, 
  i want to feel, 
   more experience, 
   just laying there, 
  choose wisely, 
  if i had a girlfriend , and if my girlfriend had an extreme sense of humor , i would might say this to her while going down on her , yep . 
  i 'm like that . 
  would still suck . 
  i think tonight i 'm going to cry myself asleep , just thinking about that i will never have a girl by my side like natalie portman . 
  first girlfriend was at 16 . 
  broke up one week after . 
  i 'm 20 . 
  been alone since . 
  i 'm portuguese , and in portugal a lot of people do n't know the newsroom , so there are no portuguese subtitles for the show , so i watched it without subtitles . 
  should 've watched it with english subtitles because the speed they talk and the intelligence of aaron sorkin 's writing is just to much for me to handle at that speed . 
  it 's like he said on the making of the social network , he likes to hear his writing like a symphony , and it 's beautiful , but jesus fucking christ , at that speed , wow , slow down motherfucker , put some subtitles on that shit . 
  do n't know if this happens with american people aswell , but it happens to me . 
  i have no problems with other shows . 
  i have a lot of american television since our country has a shitty tv and film industry . 
  i have been talking english since i was like 6 ? 
  not fluently speaking , but i 've started on videogames very young , and i 've developed my english alone , and i understanding it very well , i think i write it very well , i just do n't talk it very often . 
  sometimes i even think in english , so , i do n't know , i 've read american people sometimes use subtitles too , so , probably not only my problem . 
  ah , i 'm not the only one then . 
  i can easily write and read english , and i do n't waste time thinking in translations , i just write and read english as if it was my mother language , but that speed is just too much sometimes . 
  i fucking like his writing , most recently , i loved the social network . 
  but sometimes the speed gets in the way , and i have no idea what i 've listened to . 
  yeah , i 've been talking english since i can remember , i started with videogames very young , and i 've learned by myself , but i 'm with you , we need subtitles to watch that shit . 
  it is lovely to listen , and as you said , sometimes it seems scripted because no one in real life , atleast i do n't know anyone , is that so well spoken and so quick with so many great fucking ideas and arguments . 
  oh , what 's that lack of flow and how can i fix it ? 
  yeah , starting to do it more and more now . 
  oh yeah , poor choice of words there , should have chosen speaking instead of talking , yeah i got it , thanks . 
  thanks , no one ever actually explained to me the misuse of the talking/speaking thing , so i learned something new today . 
  thank you .
