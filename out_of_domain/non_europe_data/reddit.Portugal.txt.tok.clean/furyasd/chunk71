  it just makes me think that i 'm a better actor than 100 % of these people . 
  i could be making a living just because of all the emmys i would win just for all these infomercials . 
  i thought it was a low budget non-horror horror tv show . 
  if she 's in real life , like she is in this [ photo ] ( http://i.imgur.com/inxqf.jpg ) , i want to date her , and marry her , and be nice to her , and yeah . 
  i really like that photo . 
  it 's now on season 3 though . 
  i want to do that for a living !, 
  jesus , some of the footage there , seemed so fucking great and beautiful . 
  they shot a green screen with 4 people , then resize it to a smaller size , put it on a fucking picture and voila , you are in the fucking snow . 
  i 've saw the wall on game of thrones , ca n't remember the name now , with 4 people on the horses , they shot that , resize it , and put it on the fucking picture of the fucking wall , it was so fucking beautiful . 
  i wish i could work on the fucking industry , so fucking great !, 
  well , in portugal , we have to pay 100 $ + to have cable , and then the episodes get released one year after the season is over . 
  ie : boardwalk empire is on season 3 at the moment , here in portugal , is on the 2nd . 
  and the shows that are in the same season and same episode , are release a couple of days after it 's shown on the us . 
  fuck it , i will watch it when it gets released on the internet . 
  just realized what i 've done . 
  it was a joke . 
  it was a joke , because someone said season 1 , then you said season 2 , then i said season 3 . 
   miscarriage, 
   crime, 
  please choose wisely, 
  i wonder how that shit passed . 
  it 's unfortunate that i will have to work an entire year to save money to go from portugal to the us and buy a ticket to see louis ck live . 
  i wish i was american . 
  i does n't eveen noticed the gramarmitcal errosd . 
  twist : it was always tim burton . 
  you can have ronaldo , i prefer louis ck . 
  louis ck gets 5 $ per show , gives almost everything to his crew and charity . 
  ronaldo earns more per year than a a-list hollywood actor and still cries about it and says it sad that his club wo n't pay him more . 
  fuck him . 
  praise louis ck . 
  people are leaving the country because they ca n't find a job . 
  are you sure ? 
  oh yeah , sure , you 're right , i 'm sorry . 
  dawg 's syndrome . 
  this was a worldwide known story , it 's not an internet meme . 
  i 've seen this shit in the fucking television . 
  he was on letterman recently . 
  he did n't know what the sistine chapel was . 
  he asked letterman if he had said `` sixteen chapel '' . 
  oh the irony , yes . 
  but wait , adobe wants to update . 
  i gave a giant leap 2 years ago , when i finished high school , until then i really did n't care about politics or economy , but i graduated , i was able to vote , and i definitely changed my way of thinking , and with the state of this country , i 'm seriously thinking changing country . 
  i was thinking in moving to the uk after seeing this thread , because , well if they have regular looking people , i could have a shot in an acting career , but , well i guess i 'll have to settle for being on reddit for the rest of my life . 
  any live feed for new york ? 
  thanks . 
  thanks . 
  thanks . 
  thanks . 
  thanks . 
  thanks . 
  thanks . 
  thanks . 
  i 've seen the mother and her kid on jimmy kimmel , and i thought it would be kinda trashy like people like jersey shore people . 
  i was wrong , they are helping people , giving money to charities and other shit , the mom actually knows how to behave , the kid not so much , and i thought the kid could use a lesson or two , but , yeah , not as bad as i thought . 
  yet , i 've never seen the show . 
  i actually said that the pic was fake , it looked really fake on the last picture where the news anchor had his hair all grey and shit . 
  yeah , thanks , i got the rest covered , i 'm going with a 3570k and a hd7870 . 
  thanks .

  me and my cousin ca n't do leg press because it is uncomfortable on our knees . 
  the gym has no squat rack . 
  first day i got into the gym i said i wanted to do ss , pt said `` okey , but let 's do a resistance training first , 4x15 everything , do every machine . '', 
  also , no deadlifts they fuck up your back !, 
  these pt 's have no expertise . 
  this is the best gym in the area , but i hope that i can find one with a fucking squat rack , so i can grow my fucking legs . 
  also , only one olympic bar on the gym ? 
  that 's why in my gym , pt 's put people on hydraulic machines doing 4x15 . 
  deadlifting is bad for your back !, 
  no squat rack !, 
  everyone says this , and i have science on this shit , from / fit / repository . 
  the trainers in the gym say `` no more than 1 minute resting or you wo n't progress ! '', 
  i 'm doing ss . 
  not strange . 
  this clip made me realize that everything will be okey , and that i really really love films and that i should follow my dream . 
  are you me ? 
  are you portuguese ? 
  i 'm so embarassed of my dream , i do n't like to talk about it . 
  portugal . 
  we talk the same language !, 
  i 'm thinking in going to film school next year aswell . 
  or the way i think `` you will follow your dreams , and end up sleeping in the street while you read the script that you have to memorize for the next day for an audition , and after years of failure and frustation you come back home and have nothing to show of yourself . '', 
  but you want to move to the us ? 
  or just work in brazil ?
