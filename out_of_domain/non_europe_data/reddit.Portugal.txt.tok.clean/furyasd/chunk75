  i 'm not really interested in drinking , and partying , except if it brings me knowledge about film making or connections , what i 'm really interested in the actual festival , in watching the movies and trying to make some connections , and i 'm not american , i 'm european , so all the money i will save is for film only . 
  and i will probably travel alone if i get the chance to go to a film festival , that 's why prices are very important to me . 
  i really do n't care where i 'm sleeping as long as i do n't fucking die , get injured or get robbed , and a condo is probably expensive as fuck . 
  did you get to see any film that went on to be on the theaters ? 
  thanks for the info . 
  it 's sad that in a sad season , i 'm going to bed at 10am and waking up at 7pm . 
  today i woke up at 4pm , fuck , i 'm so fucking tired . 
  acting and video games . 
  from when i was probably 6 or younger , i 've started playing video games , i got quite good in a lot of them , especially final fantasy viii and x. 
  but now , i prefer acting , the amount of tv and film i watch is a lot . 
  i did n't watch that much , but this year , i think 100 to 150 films , and a few tv shows . 
  and then do not move and try not to breathe when she falls asleep in your shoulder or chest . 
  and then , make her breakfast in the morning . 
  yeah !, 
  i was watching an interview and that 's why i wanted to ask . 
  when i did a play last year , actions and sequences made it easier to act , because you knew what you had to do . 
  do n't know about film and tv though . 
  how 's that ? 
  memorize my performance through actions and sequences ? 
  because last year i did a play and i memorized it by actions and sequences . 
  if i memorized by how i said the lines i would not remember them if i said them in any other way . 
  it sucks , but now i know . 
  yet , i was asked if i was a professional actor . 
  i memorize the lines before performing . 
  as in , reading them out loud , and saying them out loud . 
  when i know them 100 % , i perform the action , and the scene . 
  and therefore , through actions and scenes , i memorize my performance and what should i do , so if i take one step to the left , i will know what i have to say . 
  does that make any sense ? 
  is that wrong or right to do ? 
  tv and film are different because most of the times there is no rehearsals , and as al pacino said in inside the actors studio , `` know your lines . '' . 
  i 'd really like to act for tv or film , to know the differences between this . 
  i know that there are many ways to sad , but there is the overacted sad . 
   the fluidity of the back and forth between actors can become unnatural . 
  ah , no , i memorize everything , and if another actor acts his line different , i will adjust accordingly without overacting or underacting , i know what the scene has to be , and what we have to do there , and so i adjust accordingly . 
   you run into a table on stage on accident ... react ... it just really happened . 
  by ignoring it , the audience gets taken out of the scene, 
  yesterday , i was watching some shitty theater made for tv from my country , and there was a scene where 4 or 5 girls entered an house and there was a guy greeting them , ( note , that the guy and one of the girls are professional actors , and are known in the portuguese industry ) one of the girls hat falls into the floor , and no one picks it up ! , i thought `` well , that 's fucking plastic wooden shitty acting , how can that shit happen and no one does nothing ? 
  '' , and i remembered it now because you said that . 
  i do n't know who directed that , but it was shitty , also shitty actors , but whatever . 
  my face , i 'm not good looking enough to be an actor . 
  i 'm not fucking good looking enough to be an actor , if i knew i was good looking , i would probably already changed country and struggle to be an actor , but since i know i 'm a fucking shit , i probably wo n't do it , and live a long and unhappy miserable shitty life . 
  i am , i have no really cool bone structure , my chin is very small , though i 've been told that i have a good jaw , yet , my chin is pratically non-existant . 
  also paul giamatti and philip seymour hoffman . 
  christoph waltz as captain mill\u00ebrz . 
  i 'm an atheist and i celebrate christmas . 
  it 's a time of the year where all the family gets together . 
  it 's fun . 
  so fuck that . 
  how the fuck was even that shit shot ? 
  that was beautiful . 
  too bad the spoiler . 
  at the same time . 
  man , he makes it seem so easy to audition , i get this feeling that i should really try and move countries and try to be an actor . 
  ^ it 's ^ sad . 
  hitler , abraham lincoln , bin laden , jfk . 
  yeah , fuck other people , that shit is heaven to me . 
  two free movies ? 
  fuck you all , i ai n't sharing anything . 
  i think i would be so pissed about that , that i would start to itch . 
  i do n't know anything . 
  she said that , but who knows ? 
  it could be just a joke , or maybe she really meant something . 
  i do n't know . 
  by the way , i dreamt with her today . 
  yes . 
  can you make sure there 's enough fried chicken for tonight ? 
  thanks . 
  i like to stay in the basement . 
  billie jean is not my lover, 
  ^ because ^ i ^ can, 
  i 'm portuguese , and i can speak english , i can do an american and a british accent , both are shitty , and i 'm going to start working on the french and german . 
  fuck yeah watching craig ferguson makes you learn shit . 
  i love your fried chicken !, 
  is n't that enough of a good reason to keep you around ? 
  it 's a kfc bag . 
  to remember how awesome you are at making fried chicken . 
  ^ you 're ^ not ^ even ^ from ^ kentucky ^ though . 
  that 's why i go so attached/infatuated to this girl i met in school . 
  this was the first time i had a real nice conversation with a girl , and i enjoyed the fuck out of it . 
  and that i did n't have to change myself ( like when you do when you are younger to please a girl ) , i could just talk about what i liked , movies , music , etc , i really really enjoyed talking to her , and i still wonder why i did n't ask her out . 
  what if i 'm 6 ' 4 '' , and she is like 5 ' 5 '' ? 
  yeah , that could do the trick , but i may slip and fall , or the walls may be cold as fuck . 
  yeah it is . 
  lay down as in lay down ? 
  man , i 'm 6 ' 4 '' . 
  i see her when i go to school to have lunch with a colleague , so probably every once 4 weeks , and i know that recently she did that thing where she looks when i 'm not looking . 
  no , i have n't talked to her since i left school . 
  yes , i 'm fond of her .
