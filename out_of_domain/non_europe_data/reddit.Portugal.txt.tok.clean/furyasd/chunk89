  ben affleck let me be in one of your academy award nominated or winner movies , jesus fucking christ ! '', 
  face off, 
  yeah , of course , i know , i would n't do that anyway , probably just say `` hello '' or `` hey , i liked your work . 
  '' , i really do n't actually believe that stalking someone to be the right way to achieve something . 
  ^ it ^ was ^ just ^ for ^ karma . 
  i 'm actually interested in being a filmmaker/actor , i 'm just in the wrong country at the moment . 
  coldplay . 
  i 'm not even american . 
  i do n't know , give me gold and in a month i 'll tell you . 
  reddit is like standup , sometimes we say shit that we do n't even mean , just for the laughs , in reddits case , just for the karma . 
  ** l ** ** o ** ** s ** ** t **, 
  sushi !, 
  i do n't need a story , i just need to say , keanu reeves . 
  no , taco is muerto , ding ding ding ding ding !, 
  yeah , i really liked the animation , i 'd really like to know how it 's done , i also want to do it . 
  what ? 
  i want to do that for fun , not professionally . 
  i just wanted to know what programs were used to get that animation , and i really like the font and that grainy effect . 
  cool , thanks , i 'm actually just installing after effects . 
  the way the words move are also really cool . 
  come on , really ? 
  i was going to watch it because of jane levy . 
  one day , i had a friend . 
  it 's not the generation , it 's the people , if you do n't like who you hangout with , change that . 
  i 'm not an american , i 'm portuguese , so i do n't have netflix available in the normal way , i 've installed mediahint , and i got a american netflix account , this is the first month i paid for it , i only downloaded parenthood season 4 to watch because netflix does n't have it , and i have n't downloaded lost , because netflix has it and it is faster to stream at 1080p , than to wait 2 or 3 hours to download an entire season . 
  with netflix i have n't pirated that much anymore , well , only the shows i do n't really have access in any way like new girl , game of thrones , etc. 
  what i do n't understand and i would like someone to explain it to me , is how it 's possible to pay for a tv show or a film without commercials . 
  3.1 $ billion a year is more than enough for a couple of high quality shows . 
  thanks . 
  it would have been fucking awesome if it was andrew garfield . 
  i think the director thought he was stanley kubrick and that he would be able to pull 5 minutes scenes where nothing happens and keep them interesting . 
  this could have been a short movie if they had cut all the 5 minutes scenes where nothing happens . 
  sometimes i 'm watching something , well this happen a lot with independent student films or something like that , with people with no experience , and there are a lot of shots that are shot like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zjczbmb.png ) , it 's a profile shot , i do n't know the film term for it , sorry , and the acting sometimes is so wooden that i feel that if it was shot differently , the acting would benefit a lot . 
   profile comments, 
  does this mean that facial structure is important ? 
  i think most people like attractive people to them . 
   it can be quite dangerous , and i think a few lives lost in hollywood had to do with the method, 
  can you name some ? 
  i 'm quite interested in that . 
  anyway , i know why people stay in character , etc , it 's much easier for you to fake an accent if you use it every day for 3 months , it 's much easier to walk like daniel plainview in there will be blood , if you walk hunched every day for 3 months , daniel day lewis did it , it 's much easier to talk the way joker talks , if you talk as he talks every day for 3 months , and also if you hunch your back a little , like joker did , and like heath ledger did . 
  there are a lot of ways of acting , and every person chooses its favorite . 
  in my opinion , if i had an acting career established like most of movie stars in hollywood , i would like to try and do some daniel day lewis kind of shit , just stay in character for the 3 months of shooting , and see what would happen . 
  if it was just to do a typical rom-com where you get to make out with a lot of girls , i would probably just say the lines and be a bit funny . 
  can you link robert deniro 's methods ? 
  i did n't even think about the ending , i saw it , i liked it , even though it was slow as fuck , really liked a lot of parts , i think there is a very long scene where you just hear breathing through the helmet , and the main character is out in the space , i really liked that , do n't even know why , i think it 's a very calm scene where you just hear people breathing and it was cool . 
  which movie ? 
  well , why does everyone always forgets jane levy ? 
  she is the cutest . 
  is it worth a watch ? 
  what happened ? 
  can you give more details ? 
  i do n't know james dean case and i never read that much about heath ledger 's death and why he could n't sleep or if he would n't sleep intentionally just to get crazy . 
  but river phoenix is just fucking stupid and crazy , there 's a difference between staying up for 24 hours like dustin hoffman did and using a very addicting drug that can fuck up your life the way it did to that actor , which i do n't even know , they are probably from the 50 's or something , i have n't watched that much stuff before the 80 's . 
  i think staying in character as daniel day lewis does is just to pick up mannerisms and whatnot , it 's not to create a new personality , or to change your brain into thinking that you are something that you are not . 
  am i making myself clear ? 
  he does that to get the accent , to get the way he talks , slow , fast , with pauses or not , the way he moves his hands , the way he stands , hunched or not , etc. 
  i have n't read anything about method acting except a couple of things , so i do n't know if i 'm correct or not , but there 's an extreme to things . 
  and acting is just a job , like a normal job , if you only do your job and do n't care about the rest of your life it will hurt you in any way that is possible in that moment , ie : fucking up your family relationships . 
  there are extremes to it , but this is just my opinion and i know nothing about method acting , and yet , i would really like to be an actor/filmmaker , and try to do a daniel day-lewis method kind of character . 
  my 12 year old son called his teacher a cunt , told him he fucked his mom , and then shot him . 
  i guess no more call of duty after 10pm . 
   i would love to sit down and pick his brain . 
  getting acting lessons from daniel day-lewis would probably be better than going to a method acting class with strasberg or stela adler , but yeah , i get it . 
  but that lock up , slandered and cold water , especially the cold water , to me , would it just to know how to connect it all when doing a scene and how you felt doing it , but as i said there are extremes to it , doing that versus doing heroin and snorting coke is a lot different . 
  big nose , like a jew nose and a small chin , and a lot of peopel do n't believe that facial structure plays a part in being a `` sucessfull '' actor . 
  i have never seen an actor or actress with a nose like mine . 
  chin ? 
  probably , it 's not that bad , i have a good jawline , but nose ? 
  never , and since i want to be an actor i like to know about this shit , even though , people who have n't read or seen as many movies and tv as me would n't probably notice , it would just notice if the actor or actress is good looking or not , but i tend to notice on the chin and the nose . 
  it sucks , that you probably would n't be an actor because of your nose or your chin , but yeah , it 's a visual medium . 
  i notice that even the fatest guy has a good facial structure , good chin/nose , check jorge garcia from lost , who plays hurley , that guy is fat , but has a chin and a nose , so it 's cool . 
  not so much , 6 ' 4 '' , but big nose , and the chin get overshadowed by the nose . 
  do you have an article so i can read it about facial structure in film or did you learn this in class/internet ? 
  i want to be an actor , but i 'm too lazy to do it , i also do n't like my face , so i just stay here watching lost and pretending i could be there . 
  but i thought bono was the lead of nirvana . 
  boom goes the hole . 
  you do n't see sti 's going fast enough ? 
  is 175mph fast enough for you ? 
  cool thing is robert downey jr. fighting for his co-stars . 
  but that motherfucking pay of 50 $ million upto 80 $ million when other people just got 200k $ , is a bit too much , but i guess iron man has been around for a longer time than the rest of them . 
  yeah , like johnny depp , he got 70 $ million in the 3rd or 4th pirates due to box office share . 
  one day , i was walking in the street , and caught myself in a mirror and said to myself `` jesus , that guy is really ugly . 
  '' , then my brain processed the information and it was me . 
  yeah . 
  that was sad . 
  another youtube comment ,, 
   he articulates like a movie scene, 
  and now i 'm off to write a screenplay which features a young dude who takes the place of a shitty teacher and gets his classmates to pass the final exam that will enable them to join college . 
  hollywood here i come !, 
  but wait , martin lawrence is black , this is going to be a white kid in an all black/mexican/foreign people class , that will gain their trust and make them make their dreams come true . 
  `` you wan na know how i got these emotional scars ? 
  and so do you ? 
  my teachers were ... some of the most lazy people i have ever not had the pleasure to meet . 
  they did not know how to reach into your heart , and make you to follow whatever you want to follow and do it . 
  bongqueesha , what did you ever wanted to do with your life ? 
  y' all know i wan na open my hai ' salon . 
  and you shall do it ! '', 
  whatever . 
  i do n't know what he did in that movie . 
  yeah , i did n't get it , i just wrote and did n't read the sentence .
