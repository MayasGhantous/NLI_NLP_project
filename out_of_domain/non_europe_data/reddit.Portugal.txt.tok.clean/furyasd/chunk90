  do n't attack me , i 'm portuguese and i have no money . 
  yeah , he moved his hands a lot while talking , it looked like he was rapping . 
  but martin lawrence has to be a woman then , playing a police officer undercover as a nhl player , while teaching in a school and reaching out to those kids , while thinking he 's going to bust the world 's largest diamond robbery , while in fact dreaming while he was dead , but never ever been born the whole time . 
  directed by shyamalan and me . 
  where 's that from ? 
  but in the back of his head , daniel day-lewis knows that if something happens he will have all those millions in his bank account . 
  are we talking about the girl with blue eyes , really tiny , and with a piercing ? 
  if yes , then , get the fuck out she 's mine !, 
  oh shit , ask her to go out on a date with me , i just need to buy the ticket , plane ticket , from portugal to wherever she is in the us . 
  ** we did it reddit **, 
  except for nothing . 
  if you had my permission and asked , then it 's okey , if you took it without my permission and not asked , it 's not cool . 
  it 's never cool , there are no exceptions . 
  well , i 've been using 1 or 2 chapsticks per month for 12 years now . 
  i do n't know why , my lips get very dry , and i ca n't fix it , not even with chapstick , i may have an addiction . 
  and i 've never lost one . 
  i really like this picture , she seems really tight . 
  good morning , how are you today ? 
  i 'm portuguese . 
  i drive . 
  they almost could be family . 
  i 've only started watching the show this year , i 've marathoned the 8 seasons in 1 week , but if i had started watching this when it premiered , almost half of my life would have been spent watching how i met your mother . 
  because in the end of the day , you stop seeing them . 
   the group of them is group enough . 
  that 's why when i see a group of girls looking at me , i do n't think `` oh , they probably think i 'm good looking . 
  '' , i think `` motherfucking shit , they are making fun of me again . 
  new is always better . 
  \\  acting, 
   staying relaxed is the most important thing . 
  this applies to acting aswell , atleast it 's what i think . 
  if i 'm relaxed , lines would flow better and i can hear myself through the ears of other people , like quentin tarantino in reading his script to his friends , so he can hear it through their ears . 
  if i 'm nervous or anxious , it will suck . 
  and being nervous or anxious will make you overact , now i see the connection between acting classes and taichi , which is a class that a lot of acting schools teach . 
  but being social , not so much , only if the subject / topic of the conversation interests me , i 'm an introverted though . 
  is your username a music from coldplay ? 
  everybody hurts, 
  pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa, 
  well , atleast you know she 's from brooklyn .

  i 'm 6 ' 4 '' , alone for the past 5 years . 
  yeah , but it comes down to `` is she really interested in me ? 
  nah , maybe not , maybe she is sitting on my lap because there are no other chairs for her to sit . '', 
  let 's . 
  hacked, 
  so that 's why when i was doing some acting , girls asked me to pick them up . 
  i heard some coldplay clocks on modern alt rock , 4:59 . 
  \\  tfw good jaw no chin, 
  i think i prefered the amazing spider-man , probably because the actors are better , both andrew garfield and emma stone . 
  feet and hands . 
  dude , since i was a kid , i noticed girls feet , and now it 's like a standard , feet and hands , if a girl does n't have good feet and hands , oh shit , it 's a point less , it seems shallow as fuck , but damn . 
  also , jane levy has perfect feet . 
  she 's pretty as fuck without makeup , [ here you go ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rvu5nhi.jpg ) . 
  fuck yeah , brotha !, 
  my dad bought a subaru impreza in 99 , never had a fucking problem . 
  i liked what happened in these 3 comments . 
  is it tomorrow yet ? 
  buy in bulk & bring your own baby back bacon bar-b-que, 
  i 've already sent it to her , do n't worry about it . 
  check again . 
  so , what 's the explanation behind paying to get a thousand dollars ? 
  i smell an hollywood script right here . 
  it was actually named one . 
  floaters ? 
  i ca n't remember the exact name of it . 
  if your only problem is baldness and braces , fuck you . 
  braces will eventually get off , and baldness can be badass . 
  on the other hand , being 6 ' 4 '' , skinny as fuck , jew nose and no chin , that is uglyness . 
  you will eventually do it if you try hard enough ? 
  there are no ugly actors . 
  none . 
  being an actor requires a certain facial structure , that if you watch any movie or any tv show , every actor will have that facial structure . 
  and that facial structure is a `` default '' facial structure , having a fucking jawline/chin . 
  i have never seen an actor male or female without a jawline/chin , everyone has chin . 
  you will never see an actor without a chin , and i 'm not saying without a chin fat , i 'm saying without a chin bone .
