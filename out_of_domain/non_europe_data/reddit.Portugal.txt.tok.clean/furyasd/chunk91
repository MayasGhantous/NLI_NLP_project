  people talk about steve buscemi being unnattractive . 
  really ? 
  small nose , nice chin , just weird teeth . 
  michael emerson , ben linus from lost , long nose , but has a chin , weird eyes . 
  people say `` oh that 's just nonsense . 
  '' , but the next time you watch a movie or a tv show , check if every actor has that `` default '' facial structure or not . 
  \\  life dream is being an actor, 
  \\  unnatractive so ca n't become an actor, 
  \\  no money because no acting jobs, 
  \\  no acting jobs because unnatractive, 
  i still have the jew nose / no chin . 
  she can be hot , sexy , pretty , it 's fucking amazing . 
  no chin . 
  to chin up and live a life with more self-esteem . 
  he is also going to get his own tv show . 
  thank you for doing this . 
  when i was in 4th grade and i was a good looking kid there was this mean girl , who was always mean to me , but also did me some papers with portuguese to english translation things , now that i 'm older , i realized that she liked me , and now that she is probably 20 or 21 , she is so fucking hot , thank you for doing this , because now i 'm not good looking and i wo n't be able to do it . 
  atleast use fucking protection god dammit !, 
  use the meme today , and get double the karma .

  on the 9th photo my brain wrapped and twisted itself , i took too long to discover how that shit was done .

  as a person who has never read the book , let me just tell you there are parts in the movie that are fucking good . 
  that monologue with the manequin . 
  that dog . 
  oh shit , i smell a screenplay on your life . 
  ryan gosling and rachel mcadams . 
  yeah , i came to the thread to ask why the fuck do you all hate coldplay ? 
  but it seems they are like the kid that everyone likes but they also make fun because it 's just cool . 
  tell me you do n't like this [ piano ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&amp;v=r5ldyvrrdgy&amp;nr=1 ) . 
  are you really comparing coldplay to justin bieber ? 
  their austin city performance is so fucking good . 
  [ x&y ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&amp;v=r5ldyvrrdgy&amp;nr=1 ), 
  i have been listening to coldplay since i can remember , but since 2008 , that i 've been listening to them nonstop , the only times i do n't listen to coldplay are if i 'm too tired of hearing any kind of music , and then i 'll stop for a day or two . 
  people say that they sound always the same , what they have is distinct sound in every album , but they never sound the same . 
  not fancy . 
  why do you keep insisting that it is n't a fancy and good sports car ? 
  atleast on the us , you always say this shit , in europe , subaru is a really fucking great car . 
  it 's not a budget family sedan in portugal . 
  subaru impreza is not a cheap car in europe , it is on the us , it 's like $ 20k or something . 
  my dad bought one in 1999 , same as [ this one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qj2mecx.jpg ) , but with stock grey rims . 
  i think culture and country differs , because as i said in other comments , europeans really like subaru and it 's not a cheap car to buy . 
  my dad bought one in 1999 , same as [ this one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qj2mecx.jpg ) , but with stock grey rims , and it was really fucking fun to drive , and if 175mph is n't fast for you , i do n't know what it is . 
  rated pg-13, 
  / tv / is a cool board , i get to laugh sometimes when i browse it . 
  i went to / r/canada and was downvoted to hell and insulted when i asked if they could give me advice on what to visit there . 
  i 'm starting to feel bad because i 'm the only person that i know that did n't like reservoir dogs . 
  what are you acting in recently ? 
  vfx seem so fucking difficult to do/create and you people never get any recognition . 
  life of pi , that shit was fucking amazing , but no one said anything about vfx . 
  i tried to do something on after effects just for fun , some moving letters , but fuck that shit , it was so fucking difficult , i closed that shit after 15 minutes . 
  tracking boxes were fucking difficult to create , whatever . 
  i do n't know what the salaries for vfx staff are , but the work you do , and from what i 've seen on the avengers and game of thrones , that shit is fucking amazing . 
   production management, 
  as someone who would like to be an actor , can you tell me what a producer actually does on set , or what are the functions of on ? 
  then it 's settled . 
  thanks . 
  what will change ?

  ** hey mom !, 
  people on the internet are telling me that you are a milf !, 
  nice huh ? 
  i do n't know why , but watching this video , i think it 's going to give me nightmares , something about old people and that shit holding them and them twitching , and that shit , it 's like a fucking phobia . 
  shit . 
   they can look down at times and do more humanistic things because they are on tv . 
  yes , and i know that there are times for those things , and times that they should connect with the other character and talk , if in a 5 second scene , you look half a second to the people you are talking it 's not going to make me feel that that person knows what their are doing . 
   if they are never looking at the person , this definitely has some effect on the audience . 
  i have another example for this , there is this woman who is about to get arrested because she killed her husband and their children just found out and they told the cops and motherfucking shit soap opera plot , and then her acting is just shit , she is talking to another person sitting on the couch with her , and she 's just talking almost directly to the camera , and has no contact with the person she is talking to in the first place in the last half a second of the scene . 
  she talked for like 10 seconds on about she does n't want to whatever , and in the last half a second she looks to the other person to finish the sentence , it did n't stroke me as a person watching and as a person that wants to be an actor and direct sometime that the character was feeling fear/regret/whatever emotion and it was just bland and bad acted . 
  they have no audience . 
  so [ example ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fwwecwt.png ) , actor 1 should atleast look to actor 2 when talking about some major life event regarding her daughter , but she does n't , she just looks for about a sec to the person she should be talking and then to the plate , and then to the front , and does n't make any other contact to the other actor the entire time . 
  in real life , i would say it 's normal for people to talk like that if they are amongst friends , but since on tv/film most of the times with close ups it 's not , example michael caine eye thing , i just thought it was poor directing/acting for tv the way they are doing it . 
  yeah , you 're right , but the acting is just not good because of that , they could have atleast tell the actors `` yo , lift your motherfucking eyes . '', 
  yeah , you are also right about the people watching , their demographic is n't people who want quality , it 's old people whom their children have left them in a home and they have nothing more to do than to watch shitty soap operas . 
  but i take that the bad acting could be improved if the directors had more time to work and the actors knew atleast what they were doing .

  i ca n't even afford to eat . 
  yeah , come on now , jessica alba is attractive as fuck . 
  why ca n't we have both ? 
  i would !, 
  magic, 
  nice . 
  am i the only one who actually says to the person `` hey , you were going to say something , please do . '' ? 
  it seems rude that people try to talk and add something to the conversation and they are ignored . 
  so fucking rude .
