  as someone whose only favourite games are the final fantasy series and the metal gear solid series , thank you . 
  i miss those series so much . 
  by the way , can someone tell if ps4 will be compatible with ps1 , ps2 and ps3 games ? 
  my marriage is ending , quickly what is e3 ? 
  i do n't rage at anybody , the last consoles i got were ps2 and gameboy advance sp . 
  i always prefered sony because of the final fantasy series and the metal gear solid series . 
  people like to think this is a personal war of their own , it 's not . 
  they landed on a land mine , exploded , came back , landed on another , exploded , etc. 
  i did n't know microsoft liked to get fucked in the ass this much , jesus , this is just fucking unfortunate . 
  nah , it happens because of sony . 
  i never played ps2 like that , use the middle of your thumbs you newcomer . 
  as an european who does n't know what 's happening , can anyone tell me what 's happening or happened ? 
  should i bring drugs ? 
  what about that nuke ? 
  i have nothing to ask , just say that me and my parents are big fans . 
  dude that subaru brz , oh shit !, 
  not this shit again . 
  my dad has a subaru impreza since 1999 and never had a problem . 
  and why the fuck would people buy a 335i coupe if they want a subaru brz ? 
  are you fucking high ? 
  you 're goddamn right !, 
  hello darkness my old friend, 
  yeah , i like samuel l. jackson , but that shit is bryan cranston 's , it was specifically designed for bryan cranston 's walter white . 
  yo mr. white , knock knock, 
  i am the one who knocks, 
  i should stop talking to myself, 
  i 'm so alone, 
  jesus , are we really going that road ? 
  people have personal preferences . 
  why the fuck would they buy a car just because people say so ? 
  why the fuck would you watch conan if you can watch leno ? 
  why the fuck would you fuck one girl when you can fuck two ? 
  why the fuck would you die when you can live ? 
  why the fuck you do n't get rid of that cancer instead of living with it ? 
  why the fuck are you even asking those questions ? 
  people have preferences and no one is equal , let people be . 
  why the fuck would i buy a subaru brz ? 
  because it 's fucking awesome and i like subaru , that 's fucking why , fuck you !, 
  ** l o s t **, 
  i 'm a 21 year old guy who made noises by seeing this picture . 
  but is this a worldwide thing ? 
  as in , i 'm portuguese but if i browse american based websites i am a nsa target ? 
  or is this only for american isp 's ? 
  what have the american people done to prevent this ? 
  i think she 's cute . 
  i would date her . 
  oh you know it . 
  i would probably have an heart attack if i stepped on that shit . 
  edit : thanks for the gold . 
  you were almost killed and you were naked . 
  i 'm 21 , and i 'm not a fan of formula one , i prefer motogp , so i got recommended senna on a thread i created a few days ago , and watched it , jesus fucking christ senna dies . 
  9/10 , renault not even once . 
  i kinda wanted to do that test , but since it gives you too much information , ie : diseases you might get when you are older , i do n't want to do it anymore . 
  she seems like that crazy cat lady from gordon ramsay 's show , but extremely more attractive and an actress . 
  we need to talk, 
  we have to go back !, 
  and that 's why i watched ** l o s t ** in 2 weeks or less . 
  6 seasons , 6 years , 5445 minutes , 91 hours in 2 weeks or less , fucking hell i was addicted and i would stay up all night , but fucking hell if it was n't worth it . 
  i think ** l o s t ** was perfect , maybe because i watched all in one sitting and i did n't watched it like you and was n't aware that they were different seasons . 
  ** l o s t ** to me was n't about the ending , it was about the journey i made throughout those 6 years in weeks . 
  this was the first show who made me literally stand up and yell `` what ? 
  '' , i do n't remember the episode , but i really stood up in the living room and did that . 
  to me it was really awesome writing . 
  i liked it so much that when desmond said `` see you in another like , brotha '' to locke , i started saying it in real life . 
  going to piss ? 
  `` see you in another life , brotha . '', 
  going to sleep ? 
  `` see you in another life , brotha . '', 
  taking a shower ? 
  `` see you in another life , brotha . '', 
  watching ** l o s t ** ? 
  `` see you in another life , brotha . '', 
  we have to go back !, 
  they were dead all along . 
  i really liked homeland .
