  does anyone know who she is ? 
  this one , oh man i fell in love . 
  does anyone know who she is ? 
  i 'm booking a ticket to the us . 
  oh yeah , nice , thanks !, 
  watch happy endings , i 've started watching and she is so cute in it . 
  but good news , sony is in negotiations with netflix and amazon to bring the show back . 
  just like community . 
  ** from the professional titleist **, 
  my godmother had just died , some of our , i think distant family said that i was really tall , and i said `` if i grow any taller , i 'll kill myself . 
  '' , i was probably 12 , so the `` i 'll kill myself '' for anything phase was in . 
  it 's probably fahrenheit . 
  i think in my early heritage , i might be like 50 % american , because i 'd really like to move to the us and play some football and some baseball , we do n't have that here in portugal . 
  am i the only one who understood like 20 % of what johnny depp said in that clip ? 
  thanks , i 'm portuguese but after watching the video , i 'm canadian , still living in portugal . 
  as an european , i still have no idea what nsa is doing/did . 
  i have n't been spending that much time on reddit though . 
  i hope you americans do fight against it , i do n't know what me as a portuguese can do to help you , but good luck on that . 
  ah that sucks , what are the us citizens doing to combat this ? 
  that should do it . 
  fuck you nsa !, 
  i have no words . 
  i disagree but i respect your opinion . 
  i think it was still good , and to me it 's one of the best comedies in television right now . 
  oh shit , i read that yesterday on zooey deschanel 's twitter . 
  it 's time for watching it for the 5th time !, 
  thanks for the reminder . 
  new girl . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_-nfkaks6a ), 
  i was so happy before clicking on this thread , now i 'm raging . 
  i want my happy emotion back . 
  i 'm not an american , but fucking hell , your country is fucked like a motherfucker . 
  edit : for people complaining about what perfect country i 'm from , let me just tell you that the finances/financial minister was fired yesterday , and the country is portugal . 
  it 's sad , because i really had the us has one of the best countries to go visit and possibly live . 
  i 'd like to be an actor , so the us is the number 1 country . 
  but the shit i hear from the tsa to the nsa , it 's making me not wanting to live portugal , despite portugal being a shithole anyway , we just got our financial minister ( spelled it right ? ), 
  fired yesterday , and got a new one , which from what i 've heard is not that good either . 
  but damn , your fast food is so cheap and you have so many great shit food , candies , chocolates , i just want to go there and become fat . 
  it 's not , if you read another one of my comments in this thread saying that the financial minister was just fired . 
  parkour !, 
  / r/aww, 
  i choose new girl , happy endings being second , then probably how i met your mother first 4 or 5 seasons , modern family the same . 
  op , i 'll play the joker for free , hell , i 'll even pay to play the joker . 
  oh , the dreams of wanting to be an actor . 
  another moment to add to those is the time when lily and marshal make a bet about ted and robin being together , and then when they are both in bed , marshal says `` not yet . '', 
  and gives hope about ted and robin being together . 
  i think that was great . 
  * sir * vongalafianakisbergski iv, 
  as a portuguese , i support you both . 
  it still is n't the best , but thanks . 
  i 'd like for portugal to have some of the marijuana laws your country or some of the states your country has , we can not buy medical marijuana yet . 
  never forget 4/7/1996, 
   ftfy, 
  oh my god look at the dragons, 
  i have a good eye for acting , and i 'm telling you that you are being rude . 
  give me an upvote , and while you are at it , give me gold . 
  edit : well , it happened , thanks !, 
  thanks !, 
  first time it happened . 
  i know someone who got 11 months of gold just by replying to the comment by saying `` h '' . 
  and winter 's bone . 
  what ? 
  she was on craig ferguson !, 
  jesus fucking christ , why have n't i seen this yet ? 
  what ? 
  i installed gta iv on my computer and every time i pressed anything on the keyboard the game would slowdown for a sec . 
  i will never ever again compliment anyone . 
  i was at school , and i had read somewhere on reddit to compliment a girls shoes , i did , and she just looked at me like i was a creep . 
  never again . 
  i still cringe at the thought of what i said and her face . 
  ** o2 ** - ^ no ^ one ^ knows ^ who ^ we ^ are, 
  nice, 
  i can never download the 226 pictures , the rar only comes with like 50 . 
  i do n't know why . 
  the most recent i remember seeing is the terminal , sad and funny at the same time . 
  fucking awesome . 
  ah , good enough , the shit i put up with . 
  * something *, 
  and that 's why i 'll never be a super hero or an actor . 
  steve buscemi is not bad looking . 
  rooney mara is fucking cute . 
  ut3 is shit , no one is playing that anymore , ut99 still has full servers . 
  i have almost everything , but the career i dream about , and love . 
  not love from my family , but love from a girlfriend , i have been alone since i was 16 , i 'm 21 now , i have almost no friends , but that one thing , i kinda miss that , and i have n't felt it much . 
  i am 100 % fine by being alone , i just do n't want to be lonely . 
  also , the career i want is pratically impossible to achieve . 
  i have 7 movies , season 1 of six feet under , season 3 of game of thrones and the pilot of the wire to watch , and i do n't watch anything . 
  why ? 
  actor/filmmaker . 
  i do n't really like to talk about it , because i think that people think that i 'm pretentious or that i could n't choose a profession that would actually help the society . 
  and because my self-esteem is shit . 
  \\  no jane levy, 
  to be honest , i just thought he was very anxious , but the stutter ? 
  if you have n't said anything about it , i would n't have noticed it . 
  as i said above , to be honest , i just thought he was very anxious , but the stutter ? 
  if you have n't said anything about it , i would n't have noticed it . 
  it 's more like a thing about enthusiasm and a bit of anxiety . 
  i have that voice that people listen to , i just do n't listen to it myself , it 's always the same shit . 
  i think that if i had any career of some sort in that area , i would fulfill some more of what 's missing . 
  thanks .
