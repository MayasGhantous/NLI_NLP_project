  good luck . 
  oh shit , i actually have that . 
  my jaw clicks , pops and actually locks several times , and i can not move it for a few seconds until it goes back to its place . 
  been like this since i was 16 , i 'm now 21 , and it 's been almost unbearable since i was 19/20 . 
  was it a shitty surgery ? 
  oh okey , i thought you had it , because i have that , and my chin is no where to be found , so i still do n't know if i 'm going to wear braces or i 'm going to have a surgery . 
   a natural transformation like this would easily take over a year . 
  only one year ? 
  time to go back to the gym and eat like an horse . 
  i wake up 7 times a week , so that makes me an anti-death expert . 
  i know this is out there somewhere , but what 's bulk up clean ? 
  not eating pizza , and french fries and fried shit ? 
  just drink/eat milk/protein/pasta / rice/tuna/meat ? 
  i did a play a few years ago , and this is common to do , i knew all the lines of everyone i was in a scene with , i had to know everything , not that i would mouth them , but i just knew , and also will smith did this in fresh prince . 
  only 7 $ ? 
  you americans have it easy . 
  here in portugal , a 300gr ( 10oz ) cereal bag , cost as much as that . 
  minimum wage is 485 $ per month , 600 $ . 
  lowest quality here is expensive anyway . 
  pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa, 
  yeah , it is , but in this play i had the lead role , so while knowing my monologues and whatever bits i had to know , i knew what everyone was saying . 
  it 's cool . 
  op here , just watched it . 
  just because those guys did what they did , does n't mean it 's a good documentary . 
  i 'm a dude , and i 'm not good looking , and i feel as long as a girl is somewhat attractive to me , i 'm not attractive to her . 
  and then there are those that are not out of my league , but do n't think i 'm attractive . 
  do you think playing gtav is a motherfucking game ? 
  i do n't want to share gtav . 
  with no one !, 
  i have no current routine , i know nothing about this , and the budget is tight , i do n't know if products for the skin are expensive or cheap . 
  thanks , i 'll take a look at the sidebar . 
  edit : i have no idea what to buy . 
  thanks for the help . 
  fortunately , i have no other skin problems , i just get a lot of oil , specially in my nose and forehead , also i have a problem with my lips since i 'm like 10 , which is i have to use 1 or 2 chapsticks per month , otherwise my lips and all around it will become red and i get a burning sensation , it has gotten worse over the years , probably because of the shitty chapsticks i bought . 
  i will have to buy those products on amazon , since i 'm portuguese , and i do n't know if they are available here . 
  yeah , i 've just stopped writing for a bit , and looked on google , and it 's not available here . 
  i 've got some links from amazon , [ cleanser here ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/cerave-hydrating-cleanser-12-oz/dp/b000yj2skm/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1373394545&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=cerave+foaming+face+wash ) amd [ moisturizing here ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/cerave-moisturizing-cream-16-oz/dp/b000q2rp7i/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1373394551&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=cerave ) . 
  it 's seem expensive , but i 'm tired of having this problem , and i 'll make an effort to buy these , if these are worth buying . 
  the only thing i used when i was like 12 was clearasil , but only for a few days/weeks , due to having a little bit of acne , nothing much . 
  i appreciate your help , seriously , i have been dealing with this for so long , i 'm getting tired . 
  thanks . 
  i 'm gon na pay 40 # for everything on amazon if i order those two . 
  i have absolutely no idea of what i 'm doing . 
  is this [ foaming good ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/simple-vital-vitamin-foaming-cleanser/dp/b00aodwyes/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1373395963&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=foaming ) ? 
  i could buy that instead to test . 
  i 'm going to read the post , and see what 's what . 
  i appreciate your help , once again . 
  thanks . 
  yeah , i think i can [ here ] ( http://www.feelunique.com/brands/cetaphil ) . 
  it 's cheap and it ships to portugal . 
  i do n't think it has cerave though . 
  but yeah , it costs like 10 $ with shipping included and almost 15 $ with faster shipping . 
  it 's actually more expensive if i go and buy from a pharmacy . 
  yeah , everything is overpriced here for the wage we get . 
  actually , i was thinking instead of ordering from amazon that foaming cleanser , i 'm thinking in buying everything through that shop to save shipping fees . 
  have any recommendations on a [ good moisturizer ] ( http://www.feelunique.com/search?q=moisturizer&amp;filter=fh_location=//c1/en_gb/$s=moisturizer/department%3e { skin } / % 26fh_sort_by = - $ rc_popularity % 26fh_view_size = 25 ) ? 
  you can actually see the ingredients there . 
  there is no cerave nor cetaphil . 
  thanks , i really appreciate your help , i 'll see what i can do , and i 'm going to order this probably this week . 
  thanks for all the advice . 
  thanks .

  it 's a really cool website , sucks that 's only for the americans . 
  i 'd like to buy another copy of final fantasy x and i ca n't because i 'm portuguese . 
  edit : also , do you think you will add consoles to buy/sell in the future ? 
  what the fuck ? 
  i have already finished ** l o s t ** . 
  why are you doing this by the way ? 
  now i understand when they say in the movies . 
  `` we need to go to church , if we do n't , what will the neighbours say ? '', 
  stupid hypocritical catholics , they are only the ones who are hypocrites . 
  yeah , i do . 
  maybe they weiner mission . 
  i do n't think in my particular case it 's genetic . 
  no one else in my family has this problem but me , i 'm gon na go with the diet , probably because of the things i eat , i ate for a very long time at mcdonalds when i was younger , i drank a lot of milk , cheese , i still drink a lot of milk and eat cheese . 
  it 's bruce !, 
  and he helped making the sandwich !, 
  i want a dog . 
  on netflix , now . 
  yeah , a few years ago , when i started seriously to really get into movies and tv , and acting , probably when i was 17 or 18 , i thought depp was cool as fuck , did n't watch his own movies , but still was a fucking good actor , until he started only taking shit roles , jack sparrow is still my favourite character of his , he and tim burton were good , atleast to me , up until alice in wonderland , not that the movie was a masterpiece , but i always enjoyed johnny depp 's characters , i did acting on the year i watched a lot of johnny depp 's movies and inspired my character on one of his . 
  local channel filmed the play , or some parts of it and did a story about the city doing local theater or whatever , and i did n't watch it because `` fuck it '' , and because of my self-esteem issues and i did n't like seeing myself , so i still do n't know what happened in that video . 
  anyway , now it 's starting to get to the point , where if johnny depp does n't really look at what he is doing , he will fuck up , and if he does n't review what he does , or atleast picks better projects , i agree with you and he will not get away for much longer . 
  but why should he care ? 
  he has money like a motherfucker . 
  ^ sorry ^ for ^ the ^ story . 
  yeah , i thought he was a good kid , now he 's just a cunt . 
  yeah . 
  thanks . 
  yeah , but i think it would be a better experience overall if i study film due to the technicalities of directing and how to shoot and how to place the actor and other stuff like that . 
  i 'm not american and i do n't think there are that many production companies here , but thanks for the advice it 's something i 'm gon na search and see what i can find .
