  a movie every 5 years is enough . 
  a movie and an oscar . 
  i have a samsung galaxy s3 4g lte , capable of shooting at 720p , i just do n't know what to shoot . 
  oh shit , it 's the second time this week . 
  thanks . 
  you are no longer a virgin then . 
  i 'm from portugal . 
  oh shit , i did n't know about this , they are mostly from lisbon , i 'm not from there , but i 've already seen some from where i 'm from . 
  thanks . 
  i did it when i was 20 i think , i had the game when i was like 10 , but the disc got so scratched from the hours i played that it stopped working . 
  the guy appears in the shot , does n't say anything , and i 'm already laughing . 
  it 's an hour and forty minutes ? 
  i thought it was like 4 hours . 
  i actually think it 's a shit show , they may have clever jokes , but that does n't mean i laugh at them . 
  and what the fuck is that `` you have to watch it more than one time to understand it . '', 
  who the fuck has time to watch a fucking show several times to really get it ? 
  it 's like saying , `` oh you did n't like the food ? 
  just try it one more time and you like it . 
  oh shit , last time i went to the cinema was in january to see silver linings playback , because of jennifer lawrence , and i watched children of men a few days ago . 
  so i will definitely watch gravity in the theater . 
  i have n't seen the trailer yet , but i hope it has good cinematography . 
  why do you hate sandra bullock ? 
  i am almost sure she can pull a good performance . 
  and i still liked the blind side . 
  a lot of people laugh at drama . 
  just watched the trailer . 
  that space beauty . 
  does it * look * shitty ? 
  i thought it had good cinematography . 
  it 's because the movie has n't been released yet and you are making assumptions . 
  i always wanted to do a movie about space . 
  and what is the conclusion ? 
  they die or they live ? 
  i was trying to read this with my somewhat heath ledger 's joker voice , but i just turn the joker into a british dude when i read armed forces . 
  well , time to practice . 
  do you have any videos of the other impressions you mentioned above ? 
  i would like to watch/hear them , as i 'd like to be able to impersonate voices aswell , and i like to watch other people do it because it gives me a base on how the voice should be . 
  where did you get this ? 
  edgy, 
  so much pretentiousness in this comment . 
  if plastic surgery is done to improve your self-confidence then i think it should be done , if it 's done just for the sake of it or vapid reasons or just because you are obsessed then it might be a problem .

  why is it always the typical fat stereotype , i 'm 6 ' 4 '' , 180lbs , and i do n't have a girlfriend , oh wait , i 'm also ugly as fuck . 
  a shit bomb, 
  i stopped going to the gym , when i more or less knew that i need to have surgery on my nose because i ca n't breathe properly , i need to go back , and i will , one month before the surgery . 
  i want a dog . 
  i 'm really glad i saw this post , until now , i thought it was because i was ugly . 
  dude , we should hit the gym and start eating . 
  i actually have a fat stomach for my height . 
  it 's like everything is skinny , but my stomach . 
  big nose , no chin . 
  do n't worry about it . 
  yeah , do it , because next month , i 'm going to start again aswell , but this time , i 'll see if i can buy some protein power and reach the 3000 calories every day . 
  the first few days are gon na be hard , i remember the first day , i went to the gym and ate more than 3000 calories i cried because it was fucking hard , but after that , it 's easy as fuck . 
  that still sucks for me , because yeah , i 'm the one who is alone since 16 . 
  and the one girlfriend at 16 , lasted a week . 
  and i 'm completely fine with my alone life , now i would like to share it with someone . 
  so , that 's that . 
  yeah , i know , i mostly need to learn how to eat clean , because i do n't know how . 
  i eat atleast 4 burgers per week with cheese , sometimes fries , and i eat a lot of pizza , i drink a lot of milk aswell , and the proof of that is the grease on my face . 
  6 ' 4 '' 180lbs 20 % . 
  i think it 's probably easier to lose weight than gain , because losing , you have to stop eating , which i 'm sure it 's hard as fuck for someone who had a higher calorie intake than what 's going to be used , but we have to stuff food down , which can also be bad , due to always being full and nauseated . 
  let 's count . 
  times i made out with a girl , 2 . 
  times i ejaculated within 2 minutes while having sex , 0 , i never had sex . 
  acquire body aesthetics . 
  disregard facial aesthetics , more important . 
  why is it always the typical fat stereotype that does n't get a girl ? 
  i 'm 6 ' 4 '' , 180lbs , and i do n't have a girlfriend , oh wait , i 'm also ugly as fuck . 
  oh look , you 've just described me . 
  why the fuck would i care to dress well and cut my hair , if my face is just a fucking train wreck ? 
  there 's no point . 
  also , why leave the fucking house ? 
  blue valentine is my favourite movie , but damn , if the lake scene in lars and the real girl is n't acting . 
  go watch it . 
  was n't he the one who was using the hanks name to ask girls from gonewild out ? 
  yeah , i saw it too . 
  well , your comment was edgy as fuck . 
  daniel day-lewis would actually create a new windows . 
  well , or she was dead all along and then woke up dreaming . 
   dream of someone, 
   restraining order, 
  ` murica, 
  and they say i 'm ugly . 
  you remembered me of [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcuh5lipkk8 ) . 
  a lot of hollywood actors are awkward as fuck . 
  and yes , you can be shy as fuck , and be able to act . 
  when i did a play 2 or 3 years ago and i was the lead , i was so nervous that before going on stage , i was impersonating radio voices , and saying commercial phrases and shit , and wanting to throw up , after i got on it , and said the first monologue without any problems , it was fine . 
  but would n't you really do it ? 
  i thought the kid was alright , until a few months ago , i saw a couple of interviews of him on conan and on letterman , and it seemed just like a normal kid , but now , what the fuck is this shit , what a fucking cunt , pissing on some janitors bucket while saying `` fuck bill clinton '' , spitting on people , almost getting arrested on dubai for whatever shit , jesus fucking christ , someone punch the kid . 
  and i 'm almost sure that his entourage encourages him to do it , because they want to be on his good side to be gifted some new cars . 
  canada would say `` sorry , thanks , but sorry you are going to be arrested , we are so sorry . 
  i think you missed the joke . 
  i never said the dude deserves death , but i 'm not going to applaud his cunt behavior . 
  what anne frank thing ? 
  atleast he did n't say `` wow , i would really like to visit hitler some day and smoke some weed with him and just hangout . '',
