  from the other thread . 
  does this 30 days thing is because of the humble bundle ? 
  or is it just a tos from ea ? 
  this was from user / u/trowelsbeforehoes . 
  is it yours ? 
  sorry , i did n't quote you , i 'm going to edit it now . 
  i do n't know if it 's with res , but there 's a source button , like the edit , report , context , parent buttons . 
  that 's one of the reasons i do n't want to buy an amplifier and a subwoofer for my car , even though i would like to have a good sound on my car . 
  at the moment , my head unit heats up a lot because of the overpower that the new speakers are , they are 40w rms to a 20w rms head unit . 
  but i also want to buy it because the sound is n't the best , but fucking hell , the kids make me mad and i do n't want to seem like a fucking asshole when i 'm hearing coldplay and pink floyd and dire straits just for me . 
  i got 4 new speakers , but they are 40w rms to the 20w rms sony head unit , sound is not that good . 
  i would need an amplifier . 
  yeah , my head unit has 2 rca line out jacks , but i have no room to put an amplifier on my car , it 's a small car , citr\u00f6en ax 1.1 tre from 1992 . 
  i 'm 21 , it 's my second first car . 
  the first car i drove was a subaru impreza , 218 horse power , 2000cc . 
  that was arrogant and pretentious as fuck , the car is old , and it 's french , but it 's a car , and takes me from a to b , if you think `` you are glad to be an american '' , then fuck you for being so fucking pretentious and arrogant . 
  as someone who has n't played any games recently , is gta online , gta v ? 
  or is it a different game ? 
  and i only have a pc , so i will have to wait to play any of these . 
  edit : thanks , well , it seems i will have to play it . 
  thanks , well , it seems i will have to play it . 
  thanks , well , it seems i will have to play it . 
  thanks , well , it seems i will have to play it . 
  probably on consoles only , when they port it to the computer , it would probably be like 100 people killing each other . 
  thanks yeah , now i remember reading a few days ago , about rockstar giving a lot of importance to how the online of the game is . 
  thanks . 
  \\  12 months, 
  might aswell buy a ps3 or a ps4 . 
  1 laugh . 
  it was the scar , and holding the sword like squall aswell . 
  sometimes i used an umbrella as a sword . 
  me too . 
  my favourites are the ones i played when i was young ( er ) , viii and x are my favourites , i tried to play vii recently in the psp , and i just did n't have the patience . 
  am i really and serious the only person who played viii that liked to be fucking overpowered and beat ultimecia in seconds ? 
  you all seem as worse as the people who play world of warcraft , `` on no it 's too hard , oh no now it 's too easy , oh now balance everything , but after unbalance again . '' . 
  my team was squall , zell and irvine , and i was fucking overpower , i do n't even care , i could be 5 minutes just spamming zell 's limit break and waste 2 seconds between each combo . 
  i was a fucking god !, 
  oh shit , oh shit , oh shit , oh shit , oh shit , oh shit , oh shit , oh shit , oh shit , oh shit , oh shit , oh shit , oh shit , oh shit , oh shit , oh shit , oh shit , final fantasy viii is going to be released again ? 
  my life !, 
  ^ okey , ^ it 's ^ great ^ being ^ overpowered . 
  what about my sister 's keeper ? 
  that fucking pitt , i need to impersonate brad pitt , even if it 's just for the fucking voice , because no good looks , but fuck , that dude nailed it . 
  i 'm with you , i can do deep and high pitched generic voices , but fuck , i would really like to have that fucking range to do those voices . 
  i think i can do heath ledger 's joker , but that 's about it . 
  fucking hell , i would really like to do brad pitt 's voice , fucking hell . 
  i 'm really enjoying medal of honor that i bought from the humble bundle . 
  i think that 's dice right ? 
  if not , well i 'm still enjoying medal of honor , more than battlefield 3 . 
  i only played like 20 minutes of the single player mode , i enjoy the multiplayer though . 
  i only played like 20 minutes of the single player mode , i enjoy the multiplayer though . 
  i was actually thinking about this , but i do n't know , i have a weak chin , and i think my jaw is receding , and i know for sure that i have a fucked right temporomandibular joint that needs some work , i 'm going to an appointment in some days to see what i can do . 
  also , my lower lip is more prominent than the other . 
  my question is , will braces help my situation or is a surgery needed ? 
  that middle pic , jesus fucking christ , did that shit hurt ? 
  also , how long did you have to keep your mouth shut and were n't able to talk ? 
  yes , it is . 
  but then again , i 'll watch anything with elizabeth banks or seth rogan . 
  i 'm gon na write a script about this . 
  i will send you the draft , you complete it . 
  i will direct it though , fuck you . 
  hollywood !, 
  not freedom apparently . 
  and then resurrect three days later and call it ellen deregenerates . 
  \\  hand brake, 
  learn how to drive , jesus fucking christ . 
  learn how to drive first , and then actually drive . 
  if you ca n't hill start , you do n't know how to drive manual . 
  serious question , i 'd like someone to enlighten me on this . 
  is a jaw transplant that different than a corrective jaw surgery/chin implant ? 
  this thread got me worried , because i have a receding lower jaw / `` weak chin '' and i would n't really like a fucking rejection and other complications from my body . 
  oh thanks , i guess no worries then . 
  by the way , not to intrude , but can you post a pic of your before and after if you have ?
