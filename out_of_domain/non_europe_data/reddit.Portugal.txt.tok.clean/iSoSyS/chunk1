contexto :, 
  your windows usage must be very low . 
  i 've find myself modifying the registry a ton of times . 
  just yesterday i had to add some keys that were erased during an incomplete update . 
  realmente , \u00e0 portugueses que se esquecem como as pol\u00edticas de esquerda do ps nos deixaram ( as mesmas que o amigo costa anuncia ) . 
  os 24meses ? 
  thanks for the input . 
  my question about buck vs buck-boost was more about how much a battery output varies . 
  from what i have read a fully charged battery can go beyond the indicated output , and in its discharging the output also decrease . 
  so the question was more do a rated 10.8 v output battery goes lower than 5v ( and still usable at that point ) ? 
  ok thanks . 
  so the best route to be safe is to find relevant information for this battery . 
  thanks . 
  pretty much what i thought . 
  aggro , it is either warrior or shaman . 
  dragon priest is far better than any other pure midrange deck . 
  jade druid is the * only * late game/control deck . 
  combo decks is where there is more diversity . 
  there is renolock , aviana otk druid and renomage . 
  hopefully i 'm wrong , but for the aggro , midrange and control categories i do n't think there will be changes till the next expansion . 
  i think renodecks are combo , the majority of the time they rely on their finisher . 
  but yeah , they drag the game until late , controlling the board as a control deck would do , and can win without the combo . 
  i can be wrong, 
  the definitions are vague anyway \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  it should be at least a weekend each 2 months ( or monthly if the adherence justifies ) . 
  like each 2nd weekend of each odd month . 
  as for how i think it should be organized : before the 1st edition , extensive information [, 
   * what is a livecd , how can i try a distro without modifying hd content ;, 
  * what distros are available , target users , pros and cons ;, 
  * compatible hardware/known to not work ;, 
  * how to backup , how to modify partitions , dealing with bios / * uefi * , how to install ;, 
  * advanced/tips and tricks during installation ( things like having / home at a separated partition ) ;, 
  * what to expect , 1st hours within your new os , new/breakthrough concepts ;, 
  * how to install software . 
  what is wine and pol ;, 
  * the linux way, 
  * advanced stuff . 
  ( vms , pci passthrough , etc ), 
  shall be created/gathered . 
  ideally there should be people available to help whenever difficulties/issues/questions arises . 
  we have both discord and irc , that should not be hard . 
  wrapping up :, 
  the organizers need to create/organize documentation and gather people with linux experience to help during the event ;, 
  the participants , need an usb pendrive ( 2gb should work for 50 % of the distros , 4gb for 90 % , 8gb 99,99 % ) , at least 20gb free space in the hd , motivation , open-minded spirit , and and fully acknowledge they are ** not ** installing a windows clone . 
  also , highly recommended , a second working computer ( and camera ) so you can get help from irc/discord if you get stuck while the 1st pc is installing/nonoperational . 
  also , we ought to poke / r/linuxmasterrace if this gains traction, 
  algo do tipo : a ahoy !, 
  nop . 
  as always you barely notice linux is there , but you are using it . 
  in this case , it lift off faster and took both photos . 
  maybe it is gnu hurd which is in the terminal ? 
  completely missed it . 
  it would be a great way to start the year, 
  they may not be the best game , but at least they have match history with detailed stats . 
  e as greves nos transportes p\u00fablicos a cada lua nova ? 
  e o que achas do https://riot.im/ ? 
  besides it has been released throughout 120 years . 
  who would read such thing when there is n't guarantee for it to be completed within a lifetime ? 
  unless it is different stories under the same name , i ca n't comprehend how can it be so popular . 
  the ending is a huge element in any story . 
  just verifying my persona . 
  it seems it is a thing of the [ past .

  i do n't have windows to test , but back in the day , windows explorer supported ftp , so you could just write in the address bar ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox , and download firefox . 
  iria sempre depender do contexto .

   redditor for 14 minutes, 
  i lost some time writing this , so i feel like leaving it here even if the comment i was replying to is now gone . 
   imo its first season was ok , each episode had its own plot but there was an interesting sub-plot running throughout the season . 
  the pace was decent and it had some great comedy moments . 
   now with the second season , there is a single plot for the season but it is delivered at an awful pace . 
  it seems they wanted more action , but it gets lost among all the talking . 
  also the comedy part is much smaller , and feels out of place . 
  it went from a decent comedy to an over-repeated format . 
  it is similar to the strategy employed by microsoft with windows . 
  it works , with barely any noticeable drawback , even if you do n't pay for it . 
  why force the user to search for alternatives , risking to lose both your monopoly and exclusive software lock-in , when you can just tank the `` loss '' .

  : facepalm :, 
  well , checking in . 
  wow . 
  how nice it is of you . 
  c'mon st2 you can do better . 
  yes it sucks that a community not related with / r/openttd , and i cite :, 
   ( note we 're not connected with the openttd subreddit in an official capacity , but we often play games on their servers ), 
  gets preferential treatment . 
  both by having their divulgation thread pinned , and by having their event thread with a flair . 
  but you ca n't jump to conclusions and please abstain from doing it ambiguously . 
  post your questions normally and wait for its answers .
