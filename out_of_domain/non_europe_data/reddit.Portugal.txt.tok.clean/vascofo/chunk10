  here , have a bunch of girls in thongs , be happy !, 
  you can thank me later ! '', 
  actually , i have a microsoft mouse that also takes both batteries in the same direction ... 
  lol . 
  allow me to rephrase :, 
  `` lol nope . '', 
  perhaps its time you try some coffee !, 
  pretty much all running okay . 
  perhaps you should try and shove a cigarette in your mouth with that coffee ... *** angry glare ***, 
  breakfast of champions . 
  wow has 100 levels already ? 
  whoa i 'm gettin old . 
  t'was 70 ( ? ), 
  when i quit ... 
  killed a walrus, 
  it could only have eben better if you actually yelled fus ` ro dah , 
  as long as she took the dog with her ? 
  how do you have private group friends if you always play in open ? 
  no love for samsung ? 
  alas , at least you learned some portuguese . 
  not a total fu . 
  but but how can everyone be okay with the spelling ? 
  will someone think of the spelling ? 
  lufansa hurts me . 
  tap is the best european air company !, 
  its called `` aero peek '' . 
  [ you can disable it ] ( https://www.google.pt/search?q=disable+aero+peek&amp;qscrl=1&amp;gws_rd=cr,ssl&amp;ei=d-xevyzgg8isudwugdgl ), 
  greatly enjoyed far cry 3 , planning on getting fc4 ... 
  i got a confirmation 2 days after submitting request , and funds showed on client + - 2 days after that . 
  plot twist : the 5 yo was waiting on someone to `` do the deed '' before he himself accidentaly did it ; op fit the bill perfectly . 
  * plot twist * dog 's normal response was `` he m8 , didnt work eh ? 
  better luck next time '', 
  far cry 4 ( wonder if it will get a flash sale ? ), 
  just cause 3 - can pre-sale titles go on sale ? 
  i tried maybe a dozen . 
  many were good , most were buggy , some were overcomplicated . 
  toshl is pretty good , free version is not too limited ( it does limit one income item per month ) , and has a gorgeous web client . 
  can we have a paste for the poor sods at work ? 
  i worked for a university and if it was less than $ 25 , i just gave purchasing the part number and vendor . 
  352.84 driver is fubar . 
  bsod 's from playing far cry 4 , among others ( tho heroes of the storm was fine ), 
  now using 347.11 ( ? ), 
  without issues . 
  interesting , i really tought ( at least from official announcements ) the only non-lumia that supported w10 preview was the htc m8 . 
  thank you for your reply , thats precisely the kind of feedback i wanted to hear !, 
  note that `` hey cortana '' is dependant on chipset - think only the 930 and 1520 support it ( snapdragon 800 + ) . 
  not sure what the chipset on the m8 is tho . 
  well , it might be because i 'm on developer preview . 
  some say i should downgrade in order to get on the regular path to receive updates . 
  might work , but its preposterous . 
  i 'm from portugal but i have a german ativ s ( dbt crc ) , 
  this happens on 8.1 . 
  just install both reader and acrobat , it will prompt you when opening files . 
  i could swear i got firmware updates on developer preview before . 
  light blue with logo and lettering . 
  i still think you may be mixing fw and os version tho . 
  i 'll try downgrading in order to get the last updates and will let you know , but we strayed off topic :, 
  do you think windows 10 rollout will indeed reach all w8 devices ? 
  welcome to the corporate world !, 
  * ( lies actually . 
  despite being in a so-called agile environment , we do n't really do scrum meetings - then again i work on a small team across the table from my colleagues - and we only have one development/it meeting once a month , and it never takes more than an hour ) *, 
  hear hear !, 
  most usb kb + mouse would be compatible with both systems , yes ... but you 'd need some sort of connector/splitter if you intend on using them on both computers at the same time , or some sort of switch if you intend to keep them connected to both computers and use them one at a time . 
  either way you 'll probably be okay using them on each computer individually . 
  weird question is weird . 
  the single best word in the english dictionary to describe cute women . 
  no , not gon na happen . 
  he wants to merge mac and windows desktops . 
  not gon na happen . 
  it would take some serious voodoo shit to make it happen . 
  you 'd have to raise steve jobs from the grave , mate him with bill gates and sacrifice the blood of the spawn along with a thousand malayan virgins for that to happen , and it would still need smb to be able to connect so it would happen . 
  i 'm guessing the best that can be achieved is some sort of mirrored input with a splitter . 
  unless of course you run a vm in one of the computers , but that would be one computer connected to two screens with an os running inside a vm . 
  tifu by not factory resetting my phone before giving it to a friend . 
  do n't you ** dare ** talk like that about slob weekends !, 
  lol . 
  well , i still want one . 
  good enough . 
  i had to downgrade nvidia drivers tho . 
  when oh when will microsoft become a global seller * sighs *, 
  welcome to the real world !, 
  thank you for not going dark ( yet ), 
  rofl , this would be golden . 
  tifu iring my director of talent . 
  instalable drivers ... yeah . 
  everyone is at risk, 
  repent, 
  also , do n't click anything that you have no clear clue what will do . 
  conices . 
  cortana does n't really like my ** cheap ** lifecam ( not the cinema one ) . 
  i have to go loud with it , and i do n't quite like yelling at my computer . 
  super bock . 
  trp must be taken with a grain of salt , but its not totally bullshit afaik, 
  it 's true what you say , * still * some men would benefit a lot from improved self confidence and pride ... trp is wrong at its foundation , but some of its behaviours deserve being looked into . 
  mainly not because they are trp practices , but because they are `` wise '' . 
  this said i totally agree with your commentary . 
  it 's a little like scientology in a way - i was positively baffled when i first found their website , their views on marriage and communal life ... and yet , lrh was just ... wrong , in so many levels . 
  i 've seen one in two ocasions ( or two different ones ? ), 
  in the pa\u00e7o de arcos area . 
  once parked near the escola naval ( two wheels on the sidewalk liek a proper portuguese ) , next cruising on the road between pa\u00e7o de arcos and quinta da fonte .
