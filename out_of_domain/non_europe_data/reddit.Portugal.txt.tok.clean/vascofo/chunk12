  fair enough and it does seem to be shaping up amazingly , but i 'm looking for a more laid-back after-work chill experience , rather than an hardcore driving simulator , hence my interest in horizon . 
  i 've been looking forward for fh2 since the first trailer ( with the r3hab song ), 
  had no idea sc 's music was composed by a portuguese fellow !, 
  i will probably do so xd, 
  thanks !, 
  gon na be hard coming around a copy of fh2 for 20 bucks tho = /, 
  readit ^ 2 !, 
  relay for reddit, 
  reasons, 
  4865 want it !, 
  woop !, 
  18 is teh number !, 
  edited, 
  is this over ? 
  if not , comment !, 
  not a bot serious !, 
  the 640 most likely . 
  still , no workaround possible for oneguide :(, 
  this , for me ( the region/language/functionality lock is the biggest fail on xbox/ms as a whole ( see cortana ) . 
  i get they want a `` flawless , regional tailored '' experience . 
  but as long as there are loads of people either purposedly changing their configurations to run as being on other countries and/or complaining about it , they should look into it as the most effective and pressing form of costumer feedback . 
  so far at 15 comments the winners are ( excluding the rant post in between ) :, 
  halo mcc : 8 votes, 
  witcher 3 : 8 votes, 
  gta v : 6 votes, 
  forza horizon 2 : 5 votes, 
  ( i was bored ), 
  thats because 90 % of those commenters have n't been eagerly waiting for it . 
  expectations ! = reality, 
  other than that , spec wise it is a monster phone , absolutely amazing from the battery capacity to the realsense camera , the only truly disappointing aspect of the 950 , and thats where the rage is at . 
  one day i 'll win a giveaway . 
  even if not this one . 
  i 'm actually on the same bandwagon as op , played the demo and love it , but ... 
  i was a wow player for a ( big ) while ( 1500 ** days ** gametime + - ) , and it messed up my life a bit . 
  the word `` raids '' still scares the shit out of me . 
  now i have a job , a house , a wife and a dog , and while i 'm not afraid of being tempted to play 8h/day 7 days/week again ( seriously , no time/life for that now ) i am slightly afraid the game caters to that type of audience ... 
  seriously , why 'd they have to call them raids ? 
  my samsung tv had the plex app pre-loaded or whatever . 
  it is glorious , let me tell you . 
  i would not have paid for it , but it is perfect . 
  it does take a couple seconds on startup while logging me in to respond , but other than that is not toooo slugish . 
  now the plex app , it works like a lovely charm - i spend more time on plex than regular cable , lol . 
  nowadays tho as long as your tv accepts usb , pc-in-a-stick solutions are a dime a dozen ... 
  tho you do have an xb1 connected to it so you do n't need one xd i assume media server general connectivity is good enough - is what i used to use on my old ps3 . 
  it was a nightmare for subtitles tho , and plex handles that perfectly - right to finding them alone ( bear in mind thats not the app working but the server , but still ), 
  well , i ended up buying the ultimate edition ... not regretting a single bit !, 
  can i get experience from ativ s users who installed the update ? 
  ( yes , i know it is ** not ** supported , but i have seen one single comment on wpc of it working fine wich is giving me the slightest of hopes ... ), 
  seen a report of working fine on ativ s. do n't believe it tho . 
  mines waiting , there , all alone ... 
  yes it does . 
  i 'm wondering about the benefits of hard resetting ... 
  i 'm still getting the start screen loading and the lock screen blinking now and then , but other than that its behaving properly . 
  seems to have some battery drainage going on . 
  i second the love for the overall look 'n feel , loving it , 
  seems to be an old issue , but i have a consistent crash issue after opening the lock screen settings app when trying to pick an app to manage lock screen . 
  i can change it but it crashes 1 ~ 2 seconds after opening the combo box for the apps ... 
  tried hard resetting to fix the start screen issue . 
  hard reset # 1 - no start screen at all , goes to app list , ca n't launch settings from quick task ( you need an app for that ) . 
  could n't restore . 
  hard reset # 2 - start screen is fine , no apps installed except for samsung ones , ca n't launch settings from quick task ( you need an app for that ) . 
  could n't restore . 
  hard reset # 3 thru # 10 - see # 2, 
  flashed phone with gdr3 . 
  flash went fine . 
  phone wont boot after restart . 
  phone wo n't hard reset after restart . 
  phone wont enter download mode ... 
  phone is dead . 
  ** 10536 did n't kill my phone . 
  flashing 8.1 killed my phone . 
  / goes sobbing in the corned, 
  better wait . 
  if i tell you this sandwich is edible , with or without cheese , and everyone can eat it , you 'll assume i have a sandwich in hand , right ? 
  great story , hope to see more from you !!, 
  apart from the formatting issue , but i see you 're trying to take care of that , 
  edit and view are often different , the culprit is most likely the copy/paste operation . 
  the `` boxed '' text is most likely preceded by 4 spaces - if you go into formatting help you 'll see the entry . 
  try editing your tale , find the first word in the text box , and delete and reinsert every space before it . 
  just delete any space between the last `` normal '' word and the first `` boxed '' word , and then insert one single space manually and save ... that should do it !, 
  edit : also , great tale  loved it, 
  have a slightly lesser shitty week !, 
  thank godus . 
  i actually have n't found out how to do this on w10dp yet , but on 8.1 you can set app notification `` access '' per app basis on the action center settings . 
  my ativ s hard bricked with the misfired preview so i ca n't check now , but it is definitely possible ( you can set up vibration , sound , and banner/notification center access independently ), 
  lol xd except this is actually featured, 
  cant access from work firewall . 
  good luck next one !, 
  go and play competitive . 
  i play for fun . 
  anyway , not my discussion , sorry . 
  edit : if someone i 'm playing with sucks more than i do ( i do play dota ) i also get frustrated , but i try and help them in any way i can ( tips/voice chat etc ) . 
  how do i `` control '' my `` temper '' ? 
  i think that there is surely a level gap as wide as between me and that guy/gal and other way better players than myself , sort of . 
  in a nutshell , you think you 're good ? 
  there 's a south korean 13 year old somewhere thinking, 
  you, 
  suck, 
  balls, 
  and should log off and just die because you 're not worth the wear on your keyboard keys , you wooden pc feeder faggot .
