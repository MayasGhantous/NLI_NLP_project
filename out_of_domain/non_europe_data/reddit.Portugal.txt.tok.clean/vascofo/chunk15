  i salute you if your story is true , op . 
  if it 's not , i could n't care less . 
   you will also have more resolutions and control over your graphics on pc , so you may be able to ` fiddle ' with your settings to get superior graphics on pc than on xbone ( changing anistropic filtering , anti-aliasing , shadows/water reflections etc. 
  and then pumping up resolution texture details ), 
  this is actually a point towards pc , i will be able if i renew my computer to improve graphics beyhound day one ... 
  thansk for your input !, 
  you 're pushing your luck , lol, 
  i could n't read past the first day . 
  thats a first for me in nosleep . 
  honestly to relive all the fun times of fooling around with my mates on split screen and beer multiplayer . 
  good times ... 
  soooooo ... 
  anarquia anyone ? 
  came back and read the rest . 
  i 'm extra itchy now . 
  i wo n't say this is the best , but it was definitely the most difficult to endure read i 've ever had in nosleep . 
  btw , is op dead ? 
  my wife will throw on a bad mood if i play for half an hour . 
  an argument if i play for 2 hours . 
  as a former wow addict , i ca n't help but think to myself `` goddamn , that was just a couple hours after workday and chores , what gives ? '' . 
  she liked playing the gwg tomb raider tho , but she did n't come back to it after the first play session = /, 
  lucky you . 
  then again , mcc has local co-op , so i 'm really looking forward to beuying her an extra controller and trying that . 
  i 'd love to share at least a bit of my passion with games with her , instead of having to hear from time to time `` another scantily-clad women game ?? 
  would n't you rather give me attention ? '', 
  ( honestly i 'm ** never ** picking up witcher 3 because of this ... ), 
  interesting , thats what console peasants used to say when we complained about 30fps cap ... 
  are you kidding , its a 2015 camaro . 
  man up and reclaim your vehicle . 
  seriously !, 
  i only have one question :, 
  is oneguide usable outside the us now , with my language set to english ? 
  stop trying to not let me avoid my maiden language ffs, 
  this , i want to know this . 
  a surface pro would be great . 
  my 78yo mother has been using a first generation surface since its launch without issues - i would n't recomend the first gen of course , but its portability , build quality and battery are great - you could probably get a surface pro 3 for that price ( pretty sure the 4 is over the budget ... ), 
  other than that you could go for a asus x555lj-7r92 or an hp 15-ac106np ( or nearest equivalent in the us . 
  i like the asus best , great value for an i7 processor althouth it may be overkill . 
  one is nvidia , another is amd , your pick ) . 
  these are two computers i recommended for a friend who wanted a good laptop under 800 $ , they should fit your bill all around . 
  a comment for a change !, 
  what is this ? 
  what you said , sense not makes . 
  business as usual . 
  thank you for the key !, 
  waiting to get home to find out what it is , 
  you 're right , sorry . 
  i just hate firewalls , and youtube for relaying info . 
  my bad :(, 
  i 'm still debating wether i should get it for pc or x1 = /, 
  i 'll add to the eventual tweet storm . 
  #noxboxlanguagelock !, 
  thats an whole other story ... 
  requires a lot of work . 
  what op says should be almost as flipping a switch for them . 
  still , localization is a far simpler task than the whole voice support shebang . 
  ( or you mean voice control localization specifically ? 
  i was n't aware of that fact . ), 
  i am ** working ** you * jackass *, 
  it 's a homage to breaking bad 's `` los pollos hermanos '' . 
  next alpha release will bring meth labs . 
  what is this ? 
   corsair obsidian series 450d black, 
  damn , i need money ... 
  tifu by saving porn on my pictures folder . 
  for anyone used to visual studio , pretty much all ide 's suck ... 
  my feels exactly .

  well i actually noticed the comment on pcpartpicker that said it included i7 support ... seems like a pretty decent `` budget '' mobo . 
  thanks !, 
  well i actually had a 250 one initially , but it always seems like its not much space . 
  currently i have 2 tb in 3 partitions , system , data , and storage . 
  my system allocation has 500 gb and is nearly full ... ( granted it could use some cleaning , but still , i might wan na put more ( work ) stuff in the ssd ( rendering and compiling software - vegas , vs , adobes - yes , i 'm * `` full-stack '' * ) hence the extra space ), 
  data and storage have software and media center/downloads and are obviously on a continuous need-to-clear-stuff basis . 
  erggmnmmmblll nvidia . 
  yeah , i 'll ponder the ssd size issue yet i guess ... 
  seems like an awesome , costy option ... !, 
  thanks , i 'll look into that build !, 
  i was really looking forward to the last generation of cpu , but it might be too costy for the end results ... 
  i picked the gygabite gpu because its the one i have currently ( albeit on a 760 ) and i love it ... 
  i am clueless regarding gpu makers . 
  ram is like the cheapest link . 
  i reckon i do n't need it for gaming , but sometimes comes in handy enough not to worry about the extra cost . 
  sounds like a nice ... 
  good luck with your project !,
