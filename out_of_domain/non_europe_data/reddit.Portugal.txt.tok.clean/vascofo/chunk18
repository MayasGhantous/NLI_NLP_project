  memo to all idiots holding a gun in my service :, 
  if you hear something inside , go investigate it with another idiot instead of yelling `` gee did you hear that ? 
  i must be going crazyes '' . 
  thanks !, 
  and the effing hololens !, 
  smaller ? 
  tought it was the same 5 '' . 
  and as for the processor , is it really better ? 
  its definitely newer , but was under the impression it was actually not * better * . 
  also afaik the battery is slightly smaller . 
  fair enough , thank you for the cpu explanation . 
  i do agree with your 920 comment , but i must say after getting a 640 the 5 '' does n't bother me as much as i tought it would . 
  my only gripe with the 640 's 5 '' is sometimes touching the rim of the screen with my palm when i reach my thumb to the opposite end of the screen . 
  other than that , size , weight , pocket/face accomodation are fine . 
  just cause 2 would be awesome, 
  altamente !, 
  wow . 
  / u/nazigramatical sff, 
  i guess as long as you can connect your xbox to the internet you can configure it and access xbox live being anywhere in the world ... 
  unless your government as some sort of gruesome censoring going on , nk kind of ... 
  as far as console setup goes , its just a matter of regional settings . 
  however , i do not think this will affect you . 
  there may however be a concern with your microsoft account address . 
  i used to have an account with a random uk address so i could use the app store before it opened in portugal . 
  i do not know if these restrictions are still in order , but then again , this regarded ** windows phone ** app store , way before it affected windows as a whole . 
  back then i knew people could use xb360 gold without issues ... 
  as far as isp/government limitations go , things can get trickier , savvyness wise . 
  if you know how to change your router dns settings and/or use vpn 's you should be okay . 
  this is a remote scenario however , your * country * ( or isp ) would be have to be restricting connections to microsoft in this one ... 
  witcher 3, 
  gta v, 
  i know its the same as 99 % but its really my opinion as far as pcmr is related . 
  ... but is he ... you know ... `` essential '' . . ? 
  i would so buy a galactic super bad cruiser m1 2016 destroyer x2 lazr selfie stereo beam . 
  last piece of advice : make sure to enjoy the dominican republic , do n't stay in all time !!, 
  the new downside i 'm learning to live with is getting excited when i see a new app to later see its only available on pc and not phone ... 
  lol . 
  dm is a synth . 
  i would say just cause 3 or far cry primal judging on your existing library . 
  moba 's coolest videos are always gameplay commented ones imo , if you 're good enough to comment on some good match , or even as you play your self explaining your decisions as / u/noobsalad said !, 
  now if this was uwp ... 
  i 'm just finishing my launch and i 'm planning on playing an overhaul next ... but i was more geared towards dytech than bob 's mods ... factoriomods.com is nice but seems lacking in content = /, 
  do you have a link ? 
  never heard of this one . 
  how is it ? 
  curious since you said it does n't include dytech after i said i was feeling like going dytech , 
  3.26 gb on a lumia 640 running w10 .0.10586.107, 
  en us : i have to be there is mike and i have to be there ... 
  seems like there 's not a lot of learning going on in pt ... 
  big jump ? 
  pretty sure this is a real story . 
  kinda makes you think about all the emergency calls that are actually , and really , like this , every day , all around the world . 
  kinda makes you think the life emergency dispatchers have , the burdains they take ... 
  respect . 
  boa sorte !, 
  the 90 's are back !, 
  cdburnerxp should still be around . 
  used to be a very popular , reliable and free option . 
  wet towels , of course . 
  dammit , again !, 
  deves sempre ter o pisca na rotunda . 
  quinta da fonte power . 
  `` similar to factorio '' is a great claim these days ... careful !, 
  i 'll give it a spin once i get home , best of luck to you guys !, 
  ooooh i 'm still on time !, 
  would love to play fallout on the xb1 , 
  will you also buy a google car when your android phone stops working inside your car of preference ? 
  it runs well on our roads , and best supports android . 
  its a shady area , but i 'm totally on board with op . 
  it 's sabotage , its not a rendering engine issue if changing the user agent makes everything work ok , its purposed and malicious intent , and those of us who use windows phones are used to it since a while back . 
  google wo n't make or break microsoft , only the consumer interests are getting hurt here ... 
  i wonder how you 'd comment if suddenly chrome stopped working on windows , just out of the blue . 
  because you know , more than the silly car comparison , thats pretty much equivalent to what google is doing . 
  the masses of people accusing ms of pushing bing down peoples throats do n't seem to care or notice that google is a pro at this specific game . 
  great app , gon na try it as soon as i get home !, 
  how 's the overall performance hit ? 
  can you do something to reduce/turn off the ram usage if we are running something in fullscreen or playing a game ? 
  i 'm getting ahead of myself talking before trying it out , but for me these are the make or break features of such an app , 
  i 'll provide more feedback once i try it in a few hours !, 
  fantastic writing . 
  i love how you give it away in the first line , did n't even notice :, 
   i rested by ** my brother ** 's grave and thought about what ** he would say if he ** were still alive . 
  how it came to this . 
  `` ** my brother ** was the eldest in a family ... 
  did n't notice until after the twist . 
  possible , but unlikely . 
  if you peeked up to a bullet-ridden baby on the carriage after that , it would be twice the trauma . 
  it 's pretty simple really :, 
  construction robots will build anything placed with a blueprint within the green range of a roboport , taking the materials from ** red ** , ** yellow ** or ** purple ** logistic chests . 
  this will include with research your very own personal roboport , with construction bots and materials from your inventory . 
  logistic bots will take things from ** red ** , ** yellow ** ( and ** purple ** eventually , these work differently ) and take them to ** blue ** chests or your inventory as needed , in the orange range of a roboport . 
  these chests should be placed with inserters as normal chests would . 
  further explanation on chests :, 
  * ** blue ** chests are * requesters * . 
  they have a special ui where you define what items and how many you want brought to them ( like the logistic slots on your inventory ) . 
  * ** red ** chests are * passive providers * . 
  bots will take contents from them to take to the blue chests or your inventory . 
  these are the ones you use most , mainly as output from fabricator machines or belts or furnaces , whatever . 
  * ** yellow ** chests are simply storage . 
  items you put on your inventory trash slots or from active providers without a requester available destination will end here .
