  i do n't know , but i think there is n't any priority management as to these chest should provide items before or after other tipes of chests . 
  simply put , its your trash can . 
  * ** purple ** chests are * active providers * . 
  anything put in these will be sent to the network , wether to a requester destination or to your storage chests . 
  i myself have very little use for these . 
  i use a pair with smart inserters to take the odd coal lump off my iron belt since i have a mine field with overlapping coal and iron deposits and cba to micro-place the mines . 
  blegh . 
  corrected . 
  all work and no fun makes vascofo a dull boy . 
   make the smart inserter have a logistic condition to only work if the number of belts in the logistic network is under a specified amount ( 1,000 ), 
  this , this is about logic circuits . 
  this is what i have yet to find out about . 
  nice usage example . 
  thats nice , thanks !, 
  you can , but for iron/copper for example the throughput should be so large that belts are more efficient . 
  there are never too many drones !, 
  mhm added, 
  wait up , dont repair kits have to be stored in a ** roboport ** to be used ? 
  have you ever seen a tesla replace the battery ? 
  its the future yo . 
  of all the unimersive aspects of the game , this is the least of them all . 
  halo 5 . 
  nostalgia took the best of me .

  if you want a package to install on mobile i can also send it . 
  hope it works well for you !, 
  cheers . 
  whelp , you do have a point , but i 'm fighting it !, 
  i still have hope . 
  i spent a while building up on aida . 
  i think it was the costumizing experience that let me down more . 
  but i guess you 're right , i need more to have an opinion . 
  just wanted to see if my first impression was wrong or right !, 
  i 'll be the first to come back to this thread and diss myself if i 'm wrong . 
  i hope i do . 
  will do !, 
  i actually done the silver shroud questline before starting automatron since i heard this , but i guess i have to roam the streets a little bit before i can get the whole ss feeling . 
  awesome questline btw . 
  good lord jesus, 
  this right here , is a million dollar idea . 
  no particular order , ** or platform ** :, 
  world of warcraft, 
  theme hospital, 
  warcraft 3, 
  minecraft, 
  final fantasy 8, 
  this has been done so many times in so many diferent ways , spreadsheets , smartphone apps , google maps ... 
  but have n't seen a mod for it , you 're right about that . 
  owww jc 3 is the next game on my wishlist !, 
  anyway for a hobby i usually work for my wife 's pr company . 
  no shit !, 
  ( other than gaming ... ), 
  the railroad are pussies . 
  burn the heretics . 
  and then betray the bos for shits and giggles and fire and brimstone ad victoriam . 
  [ you do n't wan na blow up your inheritance anyway ] ( / spoiler ), 
  imgur is blocked at my work . 
  my life is miserable . 
  thanks , you are lovely , but no need - i actually need to get some work done in between reddit pit stops :d, 
  also , portugal here  cheers, 
  hangman alley . 
  because masochism . 
  i can see the ss crazy eyed , sweating blood on top of a pile o half naked raider corpses `` i will survive '' . 
  a surface is a wonderful productivity/work machine , with a sidedish of browsing and video entertainment . 
  true pcmasterrace is desktop . 
  if you wan na go with a laptop , you 'll have to do with a so called `` gaming '' laptop , and even then you 'll lose on upgradeability . 
  this was announced yesterday ? 
  this si truly all it would take to make the rest of the world semi-happy about cortana ( or ready to complain ), 
  i do n't care about having cortana speaking portuguese . 
  i do care about having her active without pretending to live somewhere else . 
  we speak , work and breathe english half the time already anyway ... 
  edit - i know portuguese is in the soon ^ tm list , still do n't care for it . 
  i 'd rather have my smartphone speak good english than broken pt-br . 
  noooo this is awesome !, 
  i always use res and disable the sub theme but only today i entered from another computer . 
  i 'm sick and tired of regional locks and, 
  ... oh , color me silly , it works in portugal . 
  you 're right , you 're better off buying a smartphone with 4 gb ram . 
  who the hell needs holograms . 
  curiously enough , res was one of the ( three ) first extensions available !, 
  * readit, 
  * nextgen reader, 
  * xbox one smartglass ( if you have an xbox ), 
  aaannd thats pretty much it . 
  ( apart from the day to day daily driver apps , twitter , fb , swarm , zomato , etc ), 
  tried it once , never used it again . 
  i suppose if cortana was friendlier with my wife 's nicknames and could figure out punctuation and emotes i 'd use it more often . 
  how amazing would this be on hololens on a tabletop ? 
  it is an interesting and well written article . 
  but it still spurs my `` omg wtf no fo '' feels . 
  honestly , i have an android ( an s3 , outdated but definitely not cheap ) , and i have a cheap 640 , and i just want to keep having this choice . 
  the last thing i want is to be forced to use an android as a daily driver . 
  my android is a nightmare , a nightmare i have poured many hours into upgrading and configuring , one that i would gladly abandon if it were not for banking apps ( and the occasional stupid time waster game ) . 
  its rather frustrating how so much ms apps are actually better / more refined on android , but i see that as business acumen , the so said `` expand and embrace '' and it does not make me so salty . 
  as long as i can keep my wm.
