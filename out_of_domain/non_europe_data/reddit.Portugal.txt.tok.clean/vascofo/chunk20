  if windows mobile ( have we all agreed its now called windows mobile again ? ), 
  dies , put my soul to rest and cry me a river , for i shall most likely sell a kidney and buy an iphone , rather than live with the powerful and configurable disaster that is android . 
  much pub to other app ... 
  ... but issue remains . 
  thank you for your reply and suggestion - there are indeed plenty of third party options we can consider , but i am looking for something that can be deployed inside sharepoint . 
  wait what ? 
  this is huge !, 
  this is awesome !, 
  now we just need the same on xbox . 
  its ridiculous the need to have my games in portuguese and forfeit voice commands to use oneguide . 
  still , this is huge, 
  interestingly enough , after changing region to portugal and launching cortana she says she ca n't help ... and then happily launches anyway . 
  yep ... still , its a good sign . 
  probably the best advice is to forget about that girl and move on with your life . 
  but things are seldom that simple if you 're in love . 
  if she likes you , make her miss you . 
  there are little ( and bigger things ) you should not put up with if you are n't in a relationship , that do n't involve just moving away from her . 
  find out what those things are - examples usually all revolve around not being so readily available , wich i 'll assume you are . 
  do not show emotional commitment that should be saved for a relationship , but show that you are able to go there if she decides to commit to you . 
  regarding ex issues , they will go away , you just have to show you are not a jerk ( assuming you are not a jerk ) . 
  other than that , or further into that , be a tease . 
  be glamorous , be funny , be more interesting in any way you can than any other guy in her life, 
  portugal here - i 'm sure you would n't forfeit the oldest alliance on earth ? 
  i 'd love the ssd since its my next upgrade in line , long delayed because my gf wants to vacation in africa , thus sucking all my pcmr funds - . -, 
  ( i already have skyrim  ), 
  god damn corporate firewalls ... 
  i have that keyboard , love it , but the detachable/opposable numpad is kinda gimmicky . 
  supreme commander 2 is an amazing game !, 
  good luck with your project . 
  random poster over here !, 
  i have a 750 non-ti and it works mighty fine with dx-12 . 
  edit : ups wait its a 760 . 
  the best thing about pcmr ... 
  ** neverdying ** may consoles come and go , tablets endure abuse and rust in a corner , but may i always be able to strip and screw my very own machine . 
  ** neverending ** it may be kepler or pascal , it may be one bank or 2x8 , but may my options be plenty and fitting . 
  ** neverletyoudown ** console peasants may bicker , non-believers may shun and grieve , but all are free to ascend , and all are welcome . 
  there 's no joy like seeing your younglings ( or oldlings ) snap a pci in place , or press the button to a gleeful first whirr of the fans on a first time build . 
  there truly is n't . 
  ** amen brothers and sisters of the pcmr !!, 
   or would most of the active users have migrated to windows 10 already and windows 7 user base would be pretty much as negligible as xp users were ? 
  this . 
  nothing special will happen when windows 7 support ends . 
  windows 10 adoption has been pretty good , even considering the free upgrade . 
  the thing is , the free upgrade is the `` special '' event here , not the support end - that has always happened . 
  upgrade being facilitated for one year by this offer only means the `` shock '' will be even lesser when that date comes . 
  ( w10m ) settings  lock screen  sign in options  pin, 
  mas subscrevo o / u/refogado sinceramente ... 
  does facebook allow timeline review in app already ? 
  is skype any more reliable getting notifications and calls while in background ? 
  shit happens . 
  your bosses are cunts . 
  might as well check!good luck !, 
  when things reach that level of retardedness , its better to back away slowly while you 're still sane . 
  if he has sons our daughters , kidnapping is an alternative . 
  ( but really , apart from installing ms apps theres not much you can do to an iphone to make it more `` windowsy '' ), 
  i 'll post a picture of my terrier ... if i win !, 
  amen . 
  32 , pc/xb1 regular player . 
  if i did n't have a wife , i 'd play for at least 6 hours a day . 
  but i like playing with her too . 
  just tell whoever told you that they are a waste of oxygen . 
  ** beware , as with everything in life , gaming should be taken responsibly and in moderation . 
  crap pc , good enough for csgo tho . 
  deliver to op what op requests . 
  assassin ii should belong to me because i live on the sunniest country in europe ... 
  hot weather galore !, 
  `` when i get sad i stop being sad and be awesome instead ... 
  true story . '', 
  left my 640 charging all night on usb . 
  woke up this morning to roughly 40 % battery . 
  phone is dead after 3 hours of idle . 
  disabled cortana on lockscreen . 
  battery sense seems normal ... gon na try hard resetting = /, 
  amazingly well written, 
  suffering the same . 
  did an hard reset without restoring backup ( for the first time ever ) and its still awful . 
  too late . 
  its digging money off your credit card . 
  you where , where n't you ? 
  ran into this problem aswell . 
  got a sad smiling face when installing update and the phone wont go past that ... 
  gon na have to rollback i guess . 
  dona broke my phone !, 
  seems faster, 
  the best about pcmr is the generosity of its users !, 
  both in giveaways and advice ... 
  been mostly a lurker around pcmr for about 3 years now afaik ... !, 
  hey , you asked !, 
  imgur is sadly blocked at my workplace :(, 
  a lontra, 
  this would be great ... is there any source to backup this ? 
  yes . 
  you are way over your head . 
  gtfo while you still can . 
  ** - it 's not spanish , its portuguese . 
  * do n't ever say that again or horrible things will happen to you and the ones you love , including pets and work associates * . 
  - the reporter is from a fluff network in portugal . 
  one that has been pestering cr for long and he publicly hates . 
  he just asks him how he 's feeling for todays match . 
  sort of .
