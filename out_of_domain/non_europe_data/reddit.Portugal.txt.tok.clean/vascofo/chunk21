  ah , e se tiveres na aldeia ou arredores , da grossura do envelope . 
  a ver . 
  end of story . 
  tens um portatil ou pc com windows 10 ? 
  boom , cross-play , ecossistema conjunto , etc etc. 
  edit : eh pah , foste r\u00e1pido . 
  working fairly well in a 2011 megane , except the bogus number you call for cortana on hands free doesnt seem to work in w10m :(, 
  get out while you can . 
  i mean the country , not your job . 
  i hear the irish can be very welcoming ... 
  whelp , i 'm not so sure . 
  after all , he 's a brit that spurned a brit , and is being forsaken by the brits themselves . 
  i think there 's potential for op to gather some irish/scotish ( / welsh ? ), 
  love . 
  then again , we portuguese are suckers for misery . 
  come down , we 'll save you a sardine . 
  he might very likely get the full refund since he has n't played two hours yet . 
  just try . 
  they might take a couple days to evaluate , but there 's still time on the sale . 
  either way , who buys a game on a pre-sale day ?? 
  that land is sadly lost :(, 
  well , it can be arranjed !, 
  you get a sardine !, 
  and you get a sardine !, 
  everyone gets a sardine !, 
  both my wife and my 80yo mother use one . 
  they are not on the preview tho - wife did n't like it when it was possible to install/too buggy and now its too late . 
  oh please , i would love to hear more from you on this most interesting affair . 
  well , congratulations !!!, 
  i ( we ? ), 
  have been joking around telling brits to come to portugal after , ahem , recent events , but nothing pleases me more than seeing someone actually doing it , 
  sincerely hope you feel at home in your new home !, 
  also and despite myself being from lisbon , oporto is a great choice !, 
  porto is portuguese ,, 
  oporto is english, 
  ^ ( we are so friendly we betray ourselves using the english spelling when speaking with foreigners ... : x ), 
  3 more months then ? 
  hello !, 
  i 'm new around here but been a user of pb for a while - and i love it !, 
  so this has probably came up before , but how about an amazing uwp notification-center integrated app for windows 10 and mobile ? 
  cheers and keep up the good work !, 
  / u/iia i dare you to make a somehow vegetarian version of this . 
  amazing series , congratulations !, 
  i have 470ish and a dozen suggested lists . 
  i just do n't have unlimited trafic because screw providers . 
  so this is basically useless to me . 
  well , not in my car or jogging , 
  when at home or work i just use a computer - granted , i have n't checked if i have the lists on groove for pc . 
   for the first time in 2 years, 
  ... yeah , you should probably update ... 
  ^ ( * - starts weekly update check - * ), 
  same on my mind , but the discounts are still not that great . 
  steam has me spoiled . 
  thinking on far cry primal and/or just cause 3 ... been eyeing those since launch . 
  maybe overwatch , check what all the hype is about . 
  but honestly , this sales savings are quite underwhelming . 
  does this allow couch multiplayer ? 
  in the meanwhile , i found out [ how to properly do a planetary landing ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/elitedangerous/comments/4rlser/how_to_properly_land_a_spaceship_cne/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link ) !, 
  dammit , the * literal * last thing i did before my hiatus was joining a faction  <, 
  thats an interesting insight . 
  would you care to elaborate about the tools you talk about ? 
  i play on mobius too , will add you later , hope to catch you around !, 
  i do have a type-6 stored somewhere . 
  i wonder if its in hostile territory . 
  well that does n't seem too bad . 
  i think i did pledge to a warring faction , ca n't recall now , and if i can just get 1k kills in my own sweet timing for some nice cashback , i wo n't mind the hassle . 
  not being able to drop in any res of my choice and screwing around for a bit does annoy me a little only ... 
  either way i did my time hauling rares , and even trading common goods in my type-6 - i do n't look forward to trading so soon !, 
  you sure did :d, 
  no worryes , you 'll only have one more game to watch . 
  on the lucky , unlikely event germany actually beats france , we 'll be happy to have you cry to sleep on the finals . 
  ( and i 'm rooting for germany actually . 
  tired of finals against france . ), 
  thanks for the answer !, 
  i 'll definitely hook e :d and inara on a second monitor , along with the market connector . 
  and yes , i did use elite shipyard in the past . . glad to see the tools evolved !, 
  whelp it 's already 4pm here but my gf * will be home * so no e :d all nighter heh : /, 
  fair enough , i 'll de-downvote you . 
  still rooting for germany for tonight . 
  it 's far from a fair comparison , even given the rotten group phase . 
  i wo n't go as far as reposting all the comments on your previous thread . 
  ... with all the portuguese coming from gb because of brexit, 
  actually , not . 
  it 's a punishment for bad behaviour . 
  now if the yellow cards were not fair , thats another discussion . 
  but the penalty accumulation makes perfect sense . 
  [ the one you linked ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/4pui4d/post_match_thread_portugal_1_croatia_0/d4nxyro?context=3 ) . 
  call it a personal opinion - for some people only winning matters - but not only i think closing your defense after some chance at a goal and sitting back good soccer , nor i think that is our playstyle . 
   sit back , spoil and counter , and score from free kicks and corners . 
  this is neither good soccer ^ ^ ( * opinion * ) nor the portuguese team playstyle ^ ^ ( * fact * ) . 
  i am happy , even tho i am a bit too scared of seeing history repeating next sunday - i just do n't like being compared to greece on euro 2004 , for emotional * and * rational reasons . 
  seems like i 'm affiliated to zachary hudson . 
  could n't find anything but haul missions to do last night tho , and damn theres a lot more stuff on the stations interfaces oo, 
  they wont ever . 
  it was bought by google . 
  if this were the case , they would have never made one in the first place . 
  oh wait , that was before waze got scroogled . 
  read update notes . 
  there are several pending issues opening pdf 's on edge , this should be one of them . 
  europe ?
