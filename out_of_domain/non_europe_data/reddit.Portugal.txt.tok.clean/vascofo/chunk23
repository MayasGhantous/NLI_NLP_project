  i do have a man purse , but even before that carrying two slim smartphones on the pocket was no big deal . 
  [ this ] ( http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/i/71zm%2byuk6gl._sl1500_.jpg ) is the solution to all your problems , 
  got it straight from the xbox yesterday . 
  there was an add on the dashboard and i went `` heh , why not '' and clicked it .

  * #windowsphonemasterrace *, 
  o problema do waze \u00e9 que mal a google o comprou , mataram a app para windows . 
  iriam saber . 
  viva a democracia !!, 
  viva a democracia indeed . 
  this . 
  i used to pirate games before i had an income . 
  thats amazing ... having never raided but reading quite a bit into it , i wish i would have taken part in that . 
  maybe next weekend , 
  not really a pvp ` er , i just struggle with free time and frequent afk 's mid play , so usually i 'd rather not spoil a raid . 
  but i will !, 
  ^ ... eventually, 
  a thousand upvotes upon you . 
  its `` working '' on my 640 . 
  just the location is always unavailable ... unless i 'm connected to the device . 
  yeah , but mind the quotes , its been giving gripes over the last few versions - either does n't work at all , or does n't find devices , etc. . . 
  this last version the only issue seems to be location . 
  yes , there was . 
  honestly have no idea why it was discontinued , we need to install our apps on the phones like cavemen . 
  150 megs of hdd ? 
  preposterous, 
  you ca n't jus go and make a post like this without a mod list dump !, 
  where can i sign up ? 
  ` tis correct . 
  tho my wife is still clinging on to her white 625 too . 
  she 'll get my 640 now ... 
  while she 's waiting to build her budget for a huawhauhwaey shotx because rotating camera ... 
  haha love it . 
  i wonder what joe is doing nowadays . 
  he should host an ama soon . 
  when samsung what wot ? 
  my ativ s died long ago but i had the idea that samsung just dropped wp ( despite some wild dual boot rumours ... ), 
  not going to hate back on you because i can relate and understand . 
  i do keep an old galaxy s3 as * backup * . 
  i hate that little bitch ( then again its an old , slow phone , cooked up to android 6 ) . 
  this rant is , actually , an admittance that my preference is now based on passion rather than logic . 
  nice . 
  that will be great for the remaining 17 samsung wp users on the wild . 
  i 'm being sarcastic , but the ativ s was a great phone , and i had a omnia 7 aswell . 
  it was a pity samsung never refreshed their windows mobile offer with w10m . 
  ( alas , w10m killed my ativ s. ), 
  that sounds silly . 
  i geddit , but it sounds just ... silly . 
  like owning a mac with a windows vm to play windows games ... 
  the 640 is great , but its limitations/slowness are beggining to wear on me ( slow/bugged apps on sd ^ ( also getting a better sd this time around ) , slowness starting apps , `` loading ... '' screens ) . 
  i 'm hoping that will go away with 950 , and i 'll surely apreciate always on cortana , the extra screen space and better camera , and i 'm surelly hoping for an overall snappier and spedier experience . 
  curiously enough ( or not ) , the only reason that keeps the s3 on my pocket is actually the app gapp . 
  and i 'm not talking about pogo , i 'm talking about overall experience on ^ some existing apps , and missing banking and companion apps . 
  i used to miss wifi analyser for example , but w10m solved ** that ** gap , and i loved it . 
  i wont mention basic smartphone features like calling / calendar / email / office / notes because those are unmistakeably better on w10m in my opinion , even without the world of alternatives that android offers . 
  reddit and feedly are actually ** better ** on w10m with readit and nextgen reader . 
  what do i use android for ? 
  banking . 
  game companions ( destiny mostly ) . 
  obd reader/car companion * ^ ( i know there are alternatives on w10m but have n't seen any key player on that area ) * . 
  shopping companions ( loyalty reward cards etc ) . 
  cracked reader . 
  and every now and then i fill it up with a crapton of stupid silly small games from wich i get no pleasure at all because , once again , old phone . 
  edit : oh also, 
  can we get a freaking updated ** linkedin ** app ? 
  please !!, 
  you bought the company for christsake, 
  demand answers from your superiors / u/jenmsft !, 
  i know right , i feel like a sarcastic isheep . 
  almost . 
  yeah , that was an harsh blow aswell . 
  always wanted a band , never jumped the gun because well budget vs usefulness !, 
  but i guess now i never will ... 
  950 owners , i 've been a fast ringer on my 640 since day one . 
  on my d-d-daily driver . 
  * because in case you have n't noticed , i do like to live dangerously *, 
  is this adviseable on the 950 ? 
  or should i grow up and switch to slow/release ... ? 
  `` so what made you buy this phone , vascofo ? '', 
  '' ** courage . 
  note 4 is actually a pretty swell phone . 
  ca n't believe there are already 3 versions after it . 
  it 's just ... silly . . 
  i do n't know . 
  its passion , not logic . 
  feels like running a treadmill to drive a car on a boat . 
  at the end of the day i know you 're just trying to get the best of two worlds somehow and theres nothing wrong with that ... ^ ( but hey , got ta keep my rep as a mac hater up ), 
  shun the non-believer !!!,

  no longer available in germany , uk , us afaik . ),
