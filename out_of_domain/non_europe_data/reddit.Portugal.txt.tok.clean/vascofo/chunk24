  hey / u/sandeepsb , good work on pushpin actually !, 
  i have tryed the other options but they are way less realiable with notifications or sync speed . 
  however , pushpin is spamming the hell out of my notifications with conversations on pushbullet ... do you have a dev blog of some sort ? 
  are you activelly working on pushpin ? 
  i 'd love to go for the paid version if that is the case , 
  cheers , and keep up the good work !,

  * sigh *, 
  sad because it 's true :(, 
  i have the same question ... 
  i did n't enjoy the beta so much because i just kept dying , but i suppose i could get better and enjoy the game out of sheer star wars fandom . 
  is there any sort of decent single player/history ? 
  how is the deth star expansion ? 
  i 'm mostly after the visuals and sw immersion ... 
   it 's a very casual game . 
  i like this , tho i felt the exact oposite in the beta . 
  felt like it was a kiddie sniper noscope 360 camping game . 
  my my !,

  dear lord , my rig is smoking just from the video . 
  `` ya think ? '', 
  somebody call a * whaaambulance * ... 
  it works properly , but i reverted to the default sms app - i feel skype is not only slower , but being unable to mute contacts , reply from notification and delete threads makes it a no-go for me . 
  not having a proper landscape screen is also a letdown ... 
  other than that , its pretty nice . 
  if you search for `` messaging '' on settings you 'll get to the screen where you can choose default sms app . 
  this wo n't remove the sms from skype or break sms relay to the computer , will only change the default behaviour on the phone when you receive a text . 
  if you want to completely remove sms from skype you 'll have to access the skype app settings themselves . 
  curiously enough , the option for disabling sms inside the skype app is greyed out on my phone ... 
  * `` cortana is a bing shortcut '' *, 
  damn , that hurts . 
  and it used to have so much potential on wp8 .1 :(, 
  trying bobs mods for the first time , and going for a main bus design ... am i doing it right ? 
  * bob 's mods is insane . 
  i actually have no idea what i should or not include in the main bus , could use a * used in * tooltip ... 
  thanks , thats a nice tip . 
  while the mx-5 is a roadster , op said :, 
   when i was growing up , my father had a gorgeous convertible roadster . 
  he would take my mom , my brothers , and i to the local ice cream parlor ( ... ), 
  now , roadsters are [ by definition two-seaters ] ( https://www.google.pt/search?q=roadster+definition&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=g54gwojxdeosjwss0jfoaq ) ( as is the mx-5 , z3 , mg tf , slk , s2000 , your american corvettes , etc etc ) . 
  unless op 's father was piling up his offspring in the trunk lid , it was n't actually a roadster but a `` common '' convertible . 
  technicalities . 
  thanks . 
  using it now and already changing mah bus . 
  still saying a roadster is a two-seater . 
   wasting 20 minutes of time . 
  well that escalated quickly,
