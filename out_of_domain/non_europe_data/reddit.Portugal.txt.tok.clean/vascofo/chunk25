  while not unusable ( i actually rather fancy it , tho having to lift the phone to eye level is awkward ) , i feel like albeit fast enough , it might be responsible for my 950 battery draining faster than i expected it to ... 
  the part where you stare at the sensor for 20 minutes . 
  i mean , the whole process wo n't even take 20 seconds , worst case scenario ... 
  i fully agree with the crashing part - tho my complaint is that i actually have to * look * at the sensor for it to work , rather than just swlapping the phone in front of my face and looking at the road . 
  as a recent owner of a crappy [ renault megane cc ] ( https://www.google.pt/search?q=megane+cc&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjmlcys0zvqahup74mkhy0acykqsaqihg&amp;biw=1381&amp;bih=650#tbm=isch&amp;q=megane+3+cc ) , i can assure you any convertible is a reason to be stoked . 
  even a miata , or lord forgive me , a [ nissan micra ] ( https://www.google.pt/search?q=nissan+micra+roadster&amp;tbm=isch&amp;imgil=9n0r6ocwvia4am%253a%253buwmpwpf5m7zb_m%253bhttp%25253a%25252f%25252fwww.theparking.eu%25252fused-cars%25252fnissan-micra-c-c-germany.html&amp;source=iu&amp;pf=m&amp;fir=9n0r6ocwvia4am%253a%252cuwmpwpf5m7zb_m%252c_&amp;usg=__2ibusoic_tyijleefiesq65q0-g%3d&amp;biw=1381&amp;bih=650&amp;ved=0ahukewjzxjfl0jvqahun04mkht4yameqyjcijw&amp;ei=oxajwjnnkqemjws-siiibg#tbm=isch&amp;q=nissan+micra+cc ) . . 
  i 'm not too much into factorissimo , feels like cheating tbh , plus i like being able to see whats going on in my factory . 
  just got to ferric chloride and i. . 
  i feel like i 'm losing it :|, 
  actually an interesting idea !, 
  whatever, 
  this would be awesome . 
  neither because i 'm poor and have a limited data plan . 
  if i could stream music at will i would get a groove music pass . 
  today , its the 17th november . 
  i left work for lunch and rode with my top down because it was 20\u00bac and sunny . 
  i parked the car and did n't close it because i 'm not worryed about the kids having lunch on the building stairs next to it filling it with trash . 
  today was a good day . 
  serious edit - the following might need some fact checking but its a starting point :, 
  - portugal has the most sea area in europe ( as in oceanic platform territory ), 
  - portugal has the oldest defined borders of an european country, 
  - worlds largest cork exporter, 
  - westernmost point of europe, 
  actually , i was talking about ilha das flores . 
  but that , too . 
  whats stoping me frm using skype for sms are actionable notifications and thread muting . 
  if you do n't use these , you should be good . 
  note its a tad slower than the system sms app too . 
  for me :, 
  * resharper ( replaced powertools for me ), 
  * apex sql, 
  awesome !, 
  * whispers * `` live tiles '', 
  * whispers * `` x86 apps soon ^ tm '', 
  honestly for me one of the biggest pluses in the wm10 experience comes from the lack of alternative apps . 
  on wm i know my dialer is the best dialer there is and i 'm not tempted to waste a 1000 hours looking for , testing , and wrecking my phone with alternative dialers from the store . 
  * unless you 're into that sort of thing . 
  betting it was an hitachi deskstar . 
  only hdd that ever failed me irreparably . 
  but honestly nowadays l2cloudbackup . 
  heh why not . 
  good luck guys !, 
  ooo gief christmas games !, 
  plot twist , he was actually dining out with his girlfriend and she went along with the gag before having her diner . 
   `` dad , i 'm cold ... ! '', 
   `` go stand in the corner then . '', 
   `` but ... why ?? '', 
   `` well , its 90 degrees there ! '', 
  also thank you for a good laugh reading other redditors jokes :d, 
  omg this one kills it haha, 
  super bock  sagres, 
  sad indeed . 
  but i 'm a lettuce and i loathe sagres and love super bock . 
  damn it , confundi os santos . 
  lisbon is center . 
  north is above leiria . 
  south is below \u00c9vora . 
  til super bock is `` more portuguese '' than sagres . 
  actually agree on the sagres preta , beats super bock stout by a slim margin . 
  fair enough . 
  i see now your post was not a correction , but an addendum . 
  honestly ? 
  if you want a ps4 controller thats as much buttons as you 'll get , third party or original . 
  about that , i love the x52 because the `` strafe '' commands live in a 8-dpad on my left index finger , and the throttle is simple to reconfigure to a reverse-zero-forward throttle with zero on middle setup - then again i dont do fa-off ... the 2 joystick setup eludes me tbh . 
  constantly happens on my living room between xbox and mobile or office between pc and mobile . 
  some pretty great solutions were already suggested , but i think by far the only true solution would be making cortana aware of commands , devices and even maybe positioning . 
  it could get tricky alright , but we have the technology and ms certainly has the savvy and brain power required . 
  there should be no reason the whole array of microphones in my lan , heck , in my microsoft account ca n't work as a whole towards whatever command i say . 
  if i say `` hey cortana remind me to bring milk this afternoon '' it does n't matter wich device picks up the command - onenote will relay the notification to my phone when i 'm leaving work - this example is simply a matter of either locking the first audio source , or collating info from all the audio sources . 
  something like first device to hear gives listening feedback , but others listen aswell / do n't listen at all . 
  then its a matter of sending the actual commands to the devices that matter , if applyable . 
  phone picks up `` hey cortana , watch tv '' ? 
  send it to xbox . 
  some caveats may apply , but could be solved by gps positioning of devices or asking wich device if more than one available ... 
  there 's a lot of issues , but i ca n't see any dealbreaker . 
  i 'd love to work on this really . 
  damn , give me spatial audio awareness and i 'd make cortana truly amazing . 
  i 'm grateful for being able to change my regional settings !, 
  i 'm struggling ... 
  lately i fell in love with the samsung gear s2 smartwatch , available in every outlet around portugal , and i 'm torn that i 'd have to get a crappy memory leaked android to support it , and the only alternatives to my top of the line , flawless battery chugger l950 is a b & w monolith or a sports band that ca n't be found anywhere ... 
  that said i feel your `` do n't give up '' motto . 
  i 'm right there aswell . 
  and of course i ca n't buy it in portugal , and the discounted price with gold on the xbox store is still like 35 $ . 
  woe is me / pouts . 
  was not expecting this nut shot from amazon , too ... 
  lisbon . 
  same as roughly 25 % of the population . 
  why ? 
  i have to wonder what 2016 is doing with all those powerful souls ... 
  the ai on `` her '' was one of the most clueless , shitty and obnoxious ai assistants on fiction ever . 
  imho . 
  so very cute , 
  still on time ? 
  pretty much - if you dont , the excess will just backup and stay in the main bus anyway !, 
  my items blink when moving accross conveyors , but i dismissed it as a minor visual bug ... 
  dollah dollah bill yo .

  ! remind me 24 hours,
