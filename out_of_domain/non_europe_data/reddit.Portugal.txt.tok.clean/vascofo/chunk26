  contabilista !, 
  huh , off the top of my head , witcher 3 , just cause 3 ... 
  go to steam and [ search for tag ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/tag/en/open%20world/#p=0&amp;tab=newreleases ) , 
  i actually find luna 's voice acting kinda departed . 
  i like the tone and voice itself , but the performance seems subpar . 
  then again i 'm a little offput by the unmathing lips/speech anyway . 
  coz ram is cheap, 
  and not everybody got money for dual 1080 's and gee-sync ultra-tall-wides . 
  edit : real reasones to have over 8 gb ram :, 
  video editing, 
  running virtual machines, 
  chrome tabs open, 
  yeah , bot how many gingabaites of ram could you buy for the price of a single 1080 ? 
  that was my point . 
  i ca n't afford a 1080 , so i douse my self pity in extra ram . 
  biggs and wedge . 
   note : for the pinky trigger to work you have to have the stupid control panel open in the background . 
  not sure why , but you do ... or at least i do . 
  yup . 
  have n't seen the need to use a third party player so far aswell ... 
  adding to this list :, 
  * rss/feedly reader  nextgen reader, 
  amazing job !, 
  keep them coming !, 
  i was surprised to see continuum when i cast screen to my samsung smart tv . 
  worked flawlessly , albeit a little slow on the mouse movement . 
  yet to try a bt keyboard and mouse . 
  huh , e :d only features our own galaxy ... for now . 
  that should be easyer than adding star systems ... 
  i do n't know how it works but might be some sort of dynamic backdrop . 
  that whol invisible thing might make it complicated tho heh . 
  it 's mainly for gaming - whatever else i 'm doing on my pc does n't require such hardware ( visual studio mostly , boring code and databases ), 
  i have a nox series 2 ... i beleive it may be 750w . 
  ca n't find a damn sticker ant i do n't recall . 
  i do n't really have a budget , its more of an incremental process , piece by piece until the mobo ca n't handle anymore . 
  talk about barebones :|, 
  [ hp sells several aios ] ( http://store.hp.com/us/en/mdp/desktops/hp-all-in-one ) in that price range :, 
  these are commonly on sale on europe on big retailers . 
  [ europe ( pt ) reference ] ( http://www8.hp.com/pt/pt/products/desktops/index.html#!view=grid&amp;page=1&amp;facet=all-in-one ), 
  ssd should ramp up the price tho . 
  thanks for the tip , but why would i buy a lower wattage psu if mine is 750 ? 
  also i have a biased preference for intel/nvidia based systems , so id get a nvidia equivalent gpu ( maybe the 1060 ? ), 
  the ssd however might be a valid contender for next upgrade - thanks for your advice , 
  estudasses .

  feel tempted to move my 950 to the fast ring for this one . 
  have had it on the release ring ever since i traded my 640 for it ... 
  pretty much every app has some sort of privacy concern , including dialer and texting ... 
  this does not sound like a bug or even safe . 
  i can give you two simple scenarios where it would be disastrous to have cortana/groove/maps bypass lock screen . 
  * your phone is stolen . 
  burglar says `` hey cortana , take me home ! '', 
  - boom your house is stolen , and your wife ran away with the burglar . 
  only a slightly confused cat and dog remain . 
  * some funny workmate decides to `` hey cortana , play rick roll non stop '' and mutes the volume - boom rick astley got your data plan . 
  this should be an option , not a standart feature imo . 
  just like we can set notification visibility on the lock screen , we should be able to set app funcionality under the lock screen . 
  now that seems interesting ... 
  trusted bt devices soudns like a good implementation aswell . 
  this sums it up pretty much . 
  but what comment !, 
  oooo a different giveaway !, 
  1st place would have to be [ rimworld ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/294100 ) because i love prison architect and this seems like a helluva game built on similar architecture , ca n't wait to try it !, 
  2nd place : i would like [ another brick in the mall ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/521150 ) because need i say ? 
  just that name justifies the money i 'll eventually throw at it !, 
  other than that , seems like a funny , humble game !, 
  as for 3rd place i do n't think theres anything on my wishlist under that price tag at the moment ... so i 'll leave more chances for the others !, 
  great giveaway , op is a cool cat !, 
  not entering because currently away from my humblestation - and most likely out of op 's delivery range too ... so best of luck to everyone !, 
  oooooo and an extension aswell !, 
  i might just be in time to enter still , 
  well i 'm damn needing an excuse to get a new pc anyway !, 
  blue - 8 bit army - 639, 
  got ta admit i had an eye on that game already !, 
  i always try this in all games ( bethesda rpg 's being the main culprits , fo4/sse most recently ) and fail spectacularly . 
  ya 'll experts have any general tips towards achieving maximum resemblance ? 
  there are just so many sliders . 
  got ta take a front/profile mugshot to try and compare as i do the character in the creator ... 
  remind me !, 
  5 days, 
  using a 32gb samsung evo + ( the red ones ) on my 950ds and works like a charm , i can barelly tell apps on sd from apps on internal . 
  before i had a white brand 8 gb card and it was hell , apps would load slower or just not work at all - nevermind games . 
  mind you i did n't bother running tests or benchmarks , experience is from daily use only . 
  yay for portuguese insiders !, 
  i stuck to release ring when i traded my 640 for a 950 . but the 640 got a build a few days ago ... 
  well , i do n't use spotify and i guess you can only have offline playlists with premium ? 
  i am however a heavy groove user and have all my offline playlists on sd , and they do n't stutter at all . 
  spoilers tag maybe ? 
  this was most likely the best finance tracker on wm10 , and a solid app too ... its a damn shame :(, 
  heeeeey ... five months ... have gone by ... . . 
  it puts the plate on the bus, 
  or it gets the hose again, 
  fluids, 
  space ... the final frontier ... 
  must be so pretty . 
  it 's ... everywhere ... everywhere ... 
  5 months later i started adding trains , not because i need ( accidentally selected too many resources ) but * because i can * - also , i can use some extra gas . 
  i am yet to go into rocket building , but got my gem and basic module production up to tier 8 . 
  also made a parallel plate production line with angel 's just to see how its done , but then i realised each metal has its own production method ( s ) and oh golly i can make wires from cast copper ?
