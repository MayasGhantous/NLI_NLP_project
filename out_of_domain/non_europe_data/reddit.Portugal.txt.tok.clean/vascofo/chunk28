  `` more than obvious reasons '' ? 
  do yourself a favour and ignore dumbfounded regionalisms . 
  * specially from the north * .

  tenho o toque do iphone default no meu windows phone, 
  * ultimate lulz *, 
  yeah now how about europe ? 
  i came from windows phone partially because the platform was dying and because i 've been utterly annoyed for years on how microsoft keeps punching all non-us buyers in the nuts . 
  having bixby release on us without a chance of getting it in europe , with a freaking dedicated hardware button , is the ultimate nut breaker . 
  at least cortana partially works if we set phone language to en , bixby not even that . 
  i can understand that they did n't make it in all/major languages 3 months after functionality release , but my phone is in english . 
  let me use it in english ... !, 
  whoa now thats a giveaway !,

  ooooh always wanted that game !, 
  comment !, 
  i love it . 
  its silly , and carefree , but i just love it . 
  shattered my back plate 4 days into having the phone due to a 30 ~ 40 cm fall into asphalt . 
  it ** is ** fragile , but it may be worked around with a slim case . 
  hhaahahahahhaha the navy ... 
  the tuna population or a sparsely deployed portuguese man-o-war jelly fleet would be more efficient at keeping them away . 
  edit : i do n't mean the navy or army overall are incompetent , thats just another discussion - what i mean is they are too few for the humungous ocean area portugal has to effectively patrol anything - there are patrols across the algarve coast , but they are meant to catch drug trafficking operations . 
  as said by others , the atlantic is not friendly to refugee dhingies like the mediterranean . 
  [ source ] ( https://support.xbox.com/pt-pt/xbox-on-windows/accessories/connect-xbox-one-controller-to-pc ), 
  likewise from portugal = / its a great deal ... 
  even if only for a museum :(, 
  pretty bummed i ca n't scrobble netflix to trakt on xbox : /, 
  now this is a real mans base . 
  using [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/6n7839/angels_bobs_mod_pack/dk7d719/ ) because search is a thing, 
  works great btw !, 
  been using it for the past month, 
  valves , mostly, 
  basically fuck nos, 
  uzo , as someone mentioned , is a meo `` low cost '' , so coverage should be ok . 
  yorn is a vdf `` youth '', 
  heres a qos source : https://pplware.sapo.pt/smartphones-tablets/portugal-vodafone-a-melhor-operadora-nas-redes-mveis/, 
  mind you even tho vdf is advertised as `` best '' meo should have better 4g coverage overall . 
  all that said , both of them should be near perfect in all the continental territory , afaik . 
  except nos . 
  no idea about the airport , but if you get on the subway for 1 or 2 stops you 'll get to `` oriente '' , where you have a shopping mall `` vasco da gama '' with all the kiosks you may possibly need !, 
  wait till she meets super cooper !, 
  it was the nametag of the officer that came before . 
  same in portugal , vodafone locked . 
  sempre as ordens !,
