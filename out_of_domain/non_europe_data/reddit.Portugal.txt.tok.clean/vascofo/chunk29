  ** first time a nosleep tale has given me a nightmare ** * achievement unlocked * ^ ( and it was glorious ), 
  well , i suppose the reverse situation applies aswell ... !, 
  fair enough , i probably should go to the forums more than subreddit . 
  never did a raid . 
  the community is awesome , and plenty of sherpas to go around , but the married life never let me time to plan ahead or be able to dedicate uninterrupted play time . 
  hahahahahahahahaha, 
  haaaaaaaaa, 
  same in portugal, 
  dark souls ii , i would love to smash my computer to pieces so i have to buy a new one . 
  no really , i 'm super curious about this so said difficult game . 
  yup, 
  also battery time keeps getting better somehow, 
  its expensive . 
  * twitch * theres uranium * twitch * there ... 
   so far only use for it i have is that i use it as a battering ram on biter nests . 
  it pretty much instantly splats them and has a 3500hp tank without shields . 
  and it 's faster than biters , so i can pretty much hit and run back to my turrets to take care of the followers after i run over their homes -_-, 
  you 're a ufing genious, 
  how did i never think of this ? 
  the only use i gave it was to flatten forests early on , but its not very effective since it tries to path around obstacles ... 
  anyway , those trucks and crawlers are part of a more complex mod called aai - look it up - you can automate stuff like finding new ore fields , have a crawler move there , and then have a truck shuttle the resources from crawler back to base . 
  it seems powerful but its not too straightforward - involves some circuitry work . 
  you can find more info [ here ] ( https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?t=38475 ) . 
  oh , this is news for me :| my bad then . 
  those are protectorates ( ? 
  ) , not tied to central government . 
  the azores and madeira islands , despite having local governments , are not independent ... 
  i still prefer using readit on my windows phone over relay on my android : x, 
  whatsapp is mostly alright , but migrated to android . 
  no alternative for whatsapp . 
  facebook messenger is a cancer on windows phone . 
  it 's not a resource hog or battery drain on background like on android , but its slow as balls nonetheless . 
  no alternative for messenger . 
   the only difference is that the islands are unsustaineable and as such have much closer ties to mainland . 
  i 'm pretty sure that ca n't be considered `` the only difference '' . 
  i do n't have the knowledge or lingo to back my claims , but i am pretty sure of what is `` common knowledge '' :, 
  uk is not the same as commonwealth . 
  uk is a country . 
  commonwealth is not a country . 
  scotland is ^ ^ ( still ) uk . 
  canada is not uk . 
  canada is a country . 
  australia is not uk . 
  australia is a country ( also a continent ! ) . 
  portugal is a country . 
  azores is portugal . 
  madeira is portugal . 
  azores is not a country . 
  madeira is not a country . 
  is any of these false ? 
  to be honest , most portuguese persons you speak spanish to will be quicker to explain this to you than to spit on your face , so you should n't worry too much , 
  nuff said . 
  early meta, 
  i know i did . 
  lvl 69 looking for help clearing those pesky 7/8 mod battles ... 
  so ... have n't seen a thread explicitly discussing this , nor any news regarding it . 
  beta was supposed to run for a week . 
  from player experiences , stuff seems better/worse/incomplete in the beta . 
  still , * i think * we should be expecting official release right about ... now ? 
  ( wishful thinking . ), 
  just noticed that ctp is available on my ativ s. 
  fuck it , i 'm installing on my daily driver . 
  ^ ( i wish i had a 930 ), 
  hello glorious compadres . 
  being somewhat well versed in computering technologies , i bring only shame on myself and my colleagues with such a question , but i would like to enlighten the horrendous strains i have put my rig to . 
  so i have a fairly decent working setup , alas not without a flaw :, 
  having two sub-par monitors ( samsung 22 '' ** vga only ** ) and a gtx 760 gpu ( ** only one dvi-analog output ** ) , i ended up connecting one of my monitors to the onboard gpu from my motherboard ( after enabling it on the bios ) . 
  while everything runs nice enough ( i did worry enough to set as my main monitor the one connected to the nvidia gpu ) , i would like to know exactly what am i doing to my machine . 
  can it cope with the two streams from two different and not connected gpus ? 
  am i underusing my nvidia gpu by throttling it down too the onboard graphics ? 
  should i buy an expensive dvi-d converter ? 
  ( i 'm thinking of just scraping my old monitors for hdmi monitors tbh , but funds ... ), 
  it does work well ... but would it run better ? 
  * what have i done ? 
  albeit the last ctp added support for that one htc model , i 'm beginning to think the samsung ativ s ( for wich i have never even gotten gdr2 , tho * it is out there * ) will not soon or ever be supported on windows 10 ^ ^ officially . 
  all of you running non-lumia phones feel the same ? 
  even tho they may not be as popular , theres a plethora of devive manufacturers with windows phones out there , and it was once told after the wp7 -  wp8 fiasco that * all * wp8 phones would be eligible for windows 10 . 
  opinions ? 
  forecasts ? 
  prophecies ? 
  hello fellow xboners !, 
  rude ? 
  hope not . ), 
  being a ms addict i arrive too little to late to the party of xbox ownership . 
  knowing microsofts usual regional craptastical limitations , i obviously set my location to us upon first boot . 
  alas , this un-enabled me from setting up oneguide to work with my cable provider guide thingie . 
  if i set it up to my fair little european country , i will be ( supposedly ) able to set up one guide . 
  woe is me , i ill lose voice commands , and gosh darn me if i want my games/dashboard in portuguese . 
  residing in portugal , i have but one question regarding the big great region/language infamous lock :, 
  ** if i set up oneguide with my console set to pt/pt-pt and then revert it back to us/en-us , will oneguide still work ? 
  ** har har bland smartness . 
  thank you for your insights , and may our borders collapse in a raging fire , and let cortana rise over the brimstones of their ruins . 
  [ re-post : sooorry for not reading the wiki :( ], 
  hello community ,, 
  just got me an xbone and am of course getting ready to buy the mandatory fh2 . 
  my question is , what edition should i buy ? 
  is the deluxe all packs included version worth it ? 
  or is it better to just buy the base game and mix and match whatever i 'll want ?
