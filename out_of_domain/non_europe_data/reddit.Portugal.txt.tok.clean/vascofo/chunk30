  my question is , what edition should i buy ? 
  is the deluxe all packs included version worth it ? 
  or is it better to just buy the base game and mix and match whatever i 'll want ? 
  hello community ,, 
  as many ( or not so many ) non-lumia wp lovers i jumped with excitement when i saw an update on my ativ s ( 8970 ) a few days ago when i woke up for work . 
  thankfully i checked first to see if it was for real and was ever so disappointed to see gabe aul 's * twit * . 
  so i denied the update . 
  alas , i did not unregister my phone from dp , i just kept denying the update . 
  well ... 
  this one morning , it decided to install overnight . 
  just because * f you human * . 
  tought i bricked my samsung , or at least should expect a nasty , crummy , 3rd party aided re-flash . 
  and crummy it was , altho it did boot up , i was stuck on the loading loop start screen . 
  tried a few tricks ( action panel -  connect -  cancel ) but nothing helped except for a. . . 
  after soft resetting ( restarting ) my old samsung ativ s , build 10536 is running flawlessly , if a little slugish at points ( lock screen blinks when turned on , cortana settings break sometimes , nothing serious ) . 
  and it is glorious so far . 
  love the keyboard , and wordflow even works in portuguese now , as i love the instant reply to sms 's . 
  i didnt want to update because i could n't find impressions on folks who did try , so now i am posting my experience so far ( and will update if the phone explodes , dies , or otherwise commits painfull murder-suicide ) . 
  how about the rest of you ? 
  htc , blu , huwauahuhaei etc users out there ? 
  did any of you `` accidentally '' install the infamous build 10536 ? 
  always remember kids : wp ! = lumia, 
  ^ ( since ms/oems forgout about it ... ), 
  edit : damn you samsung , damn you microsoft , damn you gabe , damn you all to hell . 
  edit2 : ... and now i own a lumia 640 . 
  i there , i 'm a level 30 hunter looking to do vog for the first time in about 6 hours ( 20:00 cet ) and was wondering if i could find a friendly frieteam that would bring me along . 
  i have crappy equipment and no experience , but i have read and watched the encounter and overall run mechanics and know from other mmo 's i can learn , listen and speak if need be . 
  i may be told i need better gear and i 'll acknowledge if its the case . 
  i just do n't have any xb1 friends but would like to try the raid , it seems fun !, 
  gt is vafolive - am open to invites to other fireteams and random banter if anyone fancyes some co-op gaming !, 
  ps - have been told it is of good taste to dance at the end of every strike and so i will . 
  so i am still restoring apps so it may be just late , but its been almost 24 hours now . 
  after updating to 10549 i restored a backup with my ms account , but my email/contacts/calendar from the main microsoft account are missing from outlook - only gmail got restored ( missing another exchange account aswell ) . 
  did check accounts on settings and i am properly connected to my microsoft account . . 
  if i try adding it to outlook , it says it 's already been added , even tho the only account inside outlook is gmail . 
  any ideas ?

  i am making this a crosspost on / r/fallout , / r/pcmasterrace , and / r/xboxone , and i suspect i will get similar flak in most if not all of these subs . 
  but i still expect some replies to be usefull . 
  i am , as every other ** gamer ** ( regardless of platform ) excited for fallout 4 . 
  but my battlestation ( i5/8gb `` cheap `` ram/gf760 ) is getting slightly dated , and i would really like to enjoy this game without drama ... and so happens i recently got me an xbox one . 
  so i have a few doubts and questions . 
  * i know there are suspicions that fallout might be yet another faulty port on pc . 
  xb :1 / pc :0, 
  * i do n't really see myself playing an rpg , even if its an fps style rpg , with a controller ... kb/m ftw xb :1 / pc :1, 
  * the main reason i like these games on pc is extensive mod support !, 
  xb :1 / pc :2, 
  * but wait , i read mod support is coming to fallout on xb1 ** first ** ? 
  holy wackamole ? 
  xb :2 / pc :2, 
  * screen size and sound galore : xb :3 / pc :2, 
  please , add to this list , help me and maybe who knows others that may be doubtful to decide !, 
  my battlestation is starting to need an upgrade , and i cobbled up together a build based on what i hear around the sub and my own preferences . 
  care to comment on it , where am i spending too much money , or is there any classic mistake i 'm doing ? 
  i am particularly clueless on ram and mobo choices ... 
  my only `` hard preferences '' are intel/nvidia combo and a big case !, 
  also i dont intend to overclock , but should i need a non-stock cpu cooler for this ?

  hi guys , i 'm a fairly new sharepoint admin / fairly old . net and asp developer , and i ca n't seem to find out how to do something in sharepoint 2013 . 
  i have enabled anonymous public file sharing in my company , but i wanted to create a filtered view that clearly shows wich files are shared publicly . 
  so i set up in the filtering options ` shared with ! = '' '' ' - except this column is only filed when i share a file with a specific user , and remains empty if i created an access link for the file . 
  does anyone know how to workaround this , or , god forbid , suggest me a better course of action regarding managing publicly shared files from sharepoint ? 
  thank you for your time !,

  hi community ,, 
  we are a rather small startup providing services ( not goods ) and we are using sharepoint through o365 . 
  i am the humble cto of this startup / waves . 
  i 'm looking for a simple billing tracker solution to integrate in sharepoint , not much more than core functionality : billable clients , have they payed already , how much , when , basic statistics for monthly revenue , and some expense tracking would be a plus . 
  i tried instaling dynamics nav on an azure vm but its truly overkill for our yet small enterprise ( our finantial is using todoist to track bills atm :p ), 
  do you guys know anything that would fit my scenario ? 
  i 've been looking around the sharepoint store but have n't seen anything that got my attention ... 
  hi guys , any idea why word 2016 is n't an option when clicking a ms-word link on edge ? 
  any option is word mobile ... 
  this is seriously hindering my template edit capabilities in sharepoint ... 
  so after raking up a couple hundred hours on e :d and dropping out after pp coming into scene , i took the oportunity of the last steam sale to catch up on horizons and commandeer my vulture once again . 
  last thing i remember was having fun in combat zones , trying and failing to play with a wing , farming kills near the capital ship , and feeling overwhelmed by the political mumbo jumbo coming with power play ... 
  so what should i know ? 
  is the grind fest at its peak ? 
  is power play worth it or should i just skip it ? 
  is it `` skimmable '' or does getting into powerplay imply you playing for two hours every day ? 
  how about planetary landing ? 
  is there anything on the planets ? 
  is it as hard ( * pfffft * ) as boosting thru the mailslot ? 
  fill me in , fellow cmdrs :d, 
  since the last 2/3 builds ( they 've been coming hot , do n't know for sure ) i 've been having random crashes while using my lumia 640 - phone will become partially or fully unresponsive , examples :,
