   `` put me down maaaaan , you ca n't beat me i 'm a god damn mandalorian maann ! '', 
  you can get a decent rig for that , but not a monster . 
  do you a decent monitor already ? 
  apart from the gpu , that tends to be where it hurts . 
  disclosure i play on a somewhat old but gold machine : 8gb ddr3 400mhz ram , intel core i5 3rd gen ( 3570 afaik ) , and a nearly-400 $ - back-then gtx 670 gpu - and e :d runs just perfect . 
  pretty sure it 'll lag with a rift , but i dont think thats what you 're going after . 
  this setup cost me a little north of 500 $ 2 years ago or something ( it was to be under 400 until i lost my head with the gpu too ), 
  however , if you need help picking the components , i assume you 'll need help setting up the machine . 
  do n't try doing it yourself if you do n't feel comfortable , but try and do not get ripped off too . 
  its a 50 $ job at most . 
  ( price references from portugal ), 
  i 'm sorry but your situation pales in comparison to the nuts guy . 
  the legend lives on, 
  people eat shampoo now ? 
  let them die i say . 
  50 shades of nope, 
  friendzone avoided ? 
  i bet she would have went all `` just wan na be friends '' if you acted on it . 
  shake taht mofo like theres no tomorrow . 
  it 's how i deal with my yorkie dog thing, 
  thats why we do it . 
  not to strangers tho . 
  same here !, 
  lol . 
  yes . 
  it kinda is . 
  it should be like a space station , have building phases . 
  not sure = /, 
  yer insane . 
  but we want pics of the progress !!, 
  honestly have no clue on how to help you , my x52 seems to have all the buttons i need on all the right places ... 
  best of luck to you . 
  will you be writing drivers for it too once its done ? 
  i remaped some of the throttle buttons for chaff and fa off , that i did , but i am still missing a button for cells ( i just dont use them atm ) - so maybe thats some input t take in account . 
  it loses the novelty factor after a few times . 
  op is a programmer and had a bitch wife . 
  my guess is he could n't care less about an axe to the head . 
  i believe him . 
  this is awesome . 
  crime material most likely , you could get them in trouble , but still , awesome . 
  i was a telemarketer once , now i hate myself for it . 
  she just went to the station , she 'll be right back . 
  everybody does this to conveniently hide the wild erection . 
   ask her if you can get your shorts back * from her *, 
  quote !, 
  ebola . 
  * too soon ? 
  ... who the hell eats abandoned food from a fast-food restaurant table ... ?? 
  ( i mean , not out of dire starving risk ), 
  not really a tifu . 
  this . 
  its commendable to want to create content , but you must be aware ed is ** not ** devoid of history so far , even tho its barely present in the game, 
  it 's not gon na happen . 
  all our hopes and dreams will be crushed . 
  do n't ** ever ** lie to hr ... 
  you should have just went with an * omelette du fromage * . 
  serves you right !, 
  i 'm torn between the naivete and goodwill and the sheer beta male attitude here . 
  commend your patience , trust , and the will to stay together thru all that . 
  amen . 
  but as an adult , an way too worn out adult i have to submit to the general opinion here ... what the fuck dude ? 
  man up and get your shit together !, 
  still , you 're beautiful . 
  you 're all beautiful and your kissing hugging love in furry jumpsuits . 
  i wish i had been forever with my first love - but ** fuck that bitch ** - i wish i had been forever with my first love ... if she were my current one . 
  you 'll grow up . 
  sadly , you will . 
  and you will know that the only way is to pee all over everything and assert your dominance . 
  door peed oil all over you . 
  on another tought , now you got another shot at that stop motion picture ^ ^, 
  it 's dota . 
  how come it didnt involve your moms ? 
  effing feeders . 
  and this is why in europe we only get our driving licences at 18 , and our parents do n't gift us cars that we ca n't afford to pay fines for . 
  tifu by looking fab-ulous ? 
  quit baconit and go for readit2 . 
  its awesome . 
  good for you !, 
  and yes , i was a stereotyping bitch . 
  i 'm sorry , but everything in your post screams stereotyped - 15 yo truck driver , loudmouthed idiot friend drivebys while you 're in trouble , retarded police comments ( altho in their own right i guess ) , `` parents are making me pay my fine '' . 
  i guess my 1.66 $ / liter ( because fuck gallons ) gas paying ass felt butthurt . 
  but still , 15 , own car , and proceed to drive recklessly a few days after getting a licence - well , its a fu allright . 
  but you supposedly learned your lesson , so my rant about legal driving age and responsibilities may be off place . 
  loud noises, 
  that was ... alpha as fuck , in a weird and original way, 
  should have sprayed her with gas to assert your dominance, 
  you have to factor in the hot/crazy ratio . 
  us redittors are mostly * sexy * people . 
  we date on a high risk ratio . 
  this sucks , but have you considered they just really wanted to fire you and were looking for an excuse ? 
  and thus the xbox asserted its dominance ... * all over your gf *, 
  simple really , his reply saved you any trouble . 
  you tell him it was an accident , and if he never talks or mentions it again , you will also take his reply as an `` accident '' . 
  you do need to make this clear tho , and afterwards you prolly should cut all ties with him once your dues are done . 
  because he might wan na pursue that followup regardless ... 
  does n't it feel so nice ? 
  it 's a whole different world ... 
  but yeah , even here in europe it 's getting harder to find . 
  safety and higiene and whatnot . 
  fyi they should change the razor with every client ( if it 's a switchable razor one ) or at least keep it in alcohol all the time .
