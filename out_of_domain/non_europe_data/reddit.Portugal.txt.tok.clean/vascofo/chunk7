  that moment when you press alt-f4 , and yet nothing happens , you shout `` fuck this shit '' and get up to go and smoke a cigarette . 
  your computer dies a little on that moment . 
  * it is trying man , trying hard *, 
  hmm ... 
  i 've been unable to play open since wings , massive lag . 
  i never tryed port redirecting , wonder if this will solve it . 
  gon na try tonight, 
  plot twist : manager screwed with you so you 'd fail your shift and fuck up your promotion, 
  i 'm seriously rofling with * fur * de lance . 
  how did i never think of that . 
  can only picture the van from dumb and dumber in my head when thinking of the fer de lance now xd, 
  honest typo , didnt mean to play the nazi xd, 
   tl ; dr : tifu by making a post no one will want to read, 
  * ftfy *, 
  we have to make this happen . 
  love the idea, 
  dota 2 works :d, 
  obviously yes . 
  thats what it is clearly and legally and rightfully intended to do . 
  ca n't update , got two old updates stuck at 0 % :(, 
   android , ios and mac os do n't run atms , hospital life support machines , mission critical military applications . 
  most are linux , afaik ... = /, 
  ( altho in portugal we have one of the most advanced atm systems in the world * ^ ( ( citation needed ) ) * and they do use windows embedded i think ), 
  did you enroll at heartsfield ** before ** going to the cz ? 
   the servers that already do a lot, 
  lol . 
  p2p . 
  an asshole ? 
  he got his friends book f * ng published !, 
  dude , start a publishing business , now !, 
  hilarious , awesome , insane , now go and start your business !, 
  i am baffled then . 
  everything worked fine here , apart from the staggering drop in fps in open mode . 
  go to heartfield , sign up for the community effort mission thingie in the bulletin board ;, 
  go to any in system cz , kill stuff , get bonds ;, 
  get back to heartfield , profit credits ( bugged assets after delivering scared the hell out of me but it was all fine outside the mission screen ), 
  that was my path ... 
  good to know, 
   my position is less grand and more equivalent to something like `` butt goblin '' . 
  butt goblins unite !, 
  and brotrayal is the worst kind of betrayal ^ sic, 
  can a kind soul paste ? 
  elevel fucking hours a day on average ? 
  * pardon my french *, 
  federation because space dollars . 
  betchu are alliance . 
  + - 18 mil . 
  full time job and a wife . 
  i 'm thinking op wants a ** mass ** operation , and not copy pasting every single message . 
  do n't think there 's an app for that ^ tm, 
  but if you 're getting a new wp , backup will deal with it if you backup your messages . 
  shit be crazy yo, 
  godless liberals, 
  the true issue here is having to make my smartphone think it lives on heathen land in order to have cortana/whatever top feature . 
  burn the heathens, 
  oh , it was actually cunting ? 
  would have never guessed it . 
  so many things wrong in this post ... 
  tyfu by making stuff up to fit in . 
  well-spirited , but would n't it be better being honest ? 
  * `` i have no idea who the fuck is the singer '' * - * `` i have n't read the bible really , i 'm coming here to learn '' * is what i 'm all about . 
  i do n't know about luterans ( i was ** raised ** as a roman catholic latino or whatever my parents say - the `` regular '' christians ) , but you are definitely not supposed to take communion if you have not taken the communion rights . 
  which is stupid . 
  * but are n't all religious rites anyway - i digress * . 
  now for the less stupid fuck ups , already brought by attention by others :, 
  your bf 's family sound like idiots . 
  they should have been happy that her possible future in law was willing to share in family moments rather than be rolling eyes around . 
  your bf seems like the most idiot of them all by not taking a stance on the previous point or not being more supportive during your ... ordeal . 
  i 'll just take it he 's more fond of you than what you make him seem like . 
  moot point given the two above , but i really ca n't believe they did n't walk out of the church with you and made you just wait after that . 
  maybe there are more details lost in translation . 
  ** i am not a religious person ** , but for religion to survive nowadays in a sane environment , it should be about morality ( not to be confused with * mormonic * or even muslim principles of extreme discretion and abstencionism ) , ethics , charity and self-improving . 
  this little episode of yours just exposed your bf 's family ( and maybe even congregation ) as just another group of look-good ; feel-good christians . 
  oh and all religious extremists that see whatever their religion is as and end and not a means can go die in a fire and rot in hell ( pun intended ) . 
  ** bonus red-edit **, 
  you really should fuck his brother now - you should n't have the reputation without reaping the benefits ^ ( portuguese saying ayo ! ), 
  and pee on him to assert your dominance . 
  you put card in , money comes out . 
  and eventually it stops . 
  you 're an intern on a bank 's it division who gets to nap during worktime ? 
  where the fuck are you from ? 
  you 'd be working triple time where i am at , intern or not . 
  must be a government bank . 
  ** edit : ** still , awesome tifu . 
  do not assume the woman liked it ... 
  but you could use the incident to engage in conversation !, 
  op just wanted to touch her a little bit . 
  the jenny event applies to everything . 
  up until someone calls you on it . 
  i honestly think this comment is utter bullshit . 
  portuguese are natural self-destructive , but not at all unpatriotic in general . 
  desenrascan\u00e7o is a huge portuguese cultural aspect , in everything . 
  and this kids , is how i met your mother . 
  and joined the mentally disabled group on high school . 
  o instituto gulbenkian e mais uns 30 ... 
  being openly anything at work never helps , unless its carefully and meticulously planned . 
  that was your fu . 
  at\u00e9 se m ` arrepiaram as c\u00f3rneas . 
  yes and working fine on windows 10 ctp . 
  just have to load the software control panel for pinky to work .
