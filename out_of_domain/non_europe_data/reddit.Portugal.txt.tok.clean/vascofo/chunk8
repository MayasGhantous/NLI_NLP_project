  * does it still qualify as working fine ? 
  i think you 're pushing it really xd, 
  that much yes , but it wo n't coordinate with a flight , as in `` you have to leave now to get to the flight that will be able to take you to your appointment in amsterdam '', 
  guess i was the one pushing it lol, 
  you 're lucky it was not raining . 
  apparently , you 'll die in about 13 hours . 
  agressivo mas true story . 
  just increase the driver installation timeout . 
  ** warning : format c : is nsfw **,

  nsfw, 
  * grumble *, 
  and it never will . 
  it was bought by google . 
  which is sad , because its a terrific navigation app . 
  * you 're in too deep *, 
   we want to see if people are willing to buy the game a 2nd time before go handing it out for free to existing users, 
  sounds legit . 
  steam adds an ocd like level of crazyness to game library organization . 
  not saying i would do it , but i find myself overly ill-tempered regarding this non-chalant decision . 
  if it is maintained by fd . 
  wich i believe will . 
  as posted before , and i 'll quote ,, 
   ** `` we are assessing player feedback '' ** - you 's all can eat a bag ' o dicks 'n we 'll laff at you choking on 'em . 
  this would be 200 % more useful overlayed with an example of weapon placement in the ships !, 
  you do know you can just go to any forum and get some help ... free , right ? 
  try http://www.codeproject.com/ for example, 
  `` give a man a fish ... '', 
  stack overflow is my go-to when facing challenges : http://stackoverflow.com/, 
  it 's quite late in here and i 'm not really willing to go into your assignment at this hour , but those seem really straightforward , you should get them solved in half an hour tops .

  btw , its create or replace - that means not both ( afaik ), 
  seems you got # 17 mostly right :, 
  create trigger trg_updatecustbalance2, 
  after delete, 
  on tbl_invoice for each row, 
  begin, 
  update tbl_costumer set cust_balance = cust_balance - : old.inv _ amount, 
  where cust_num = : old.cust _ num ;, 
  end ;,

  sqlfiddle is a nice resource for testing purposes , but you need to re-create the whole schema for testing : check out this fiddle for a update after insert trigger : http://www.sqlfiddle.com/#!3/a260c/1, 
  seems i may have been wrong on that create or replace issue . 
  refer to the example in http://www.techonthenet.com/oracle/triggers/after_insert.php for help on # 14 . 
  good night !, 
  mmmmmmmhmmmmmmm , blind and pointless murder ... 
  dominance asserted . 
  @ is not `` twitter '' . 
  if you wan na contain it , at least refer to email . 
  @ is fucking universal yo, 
  or exactly what is happening now . 
  people making fakes all around the place and when the `` real thing '' comes no one will believe until they are smacked n the face by the boy who cried wolf syndrome . 
  loud noises !, 
  i smells khargoids, 
  not a tifu . 
  i once picked up an umbrella an old lady had dropped in the bus and after giving it to her she proceeded to smack the holy smithereens out of me with said umbrella for `` touching her stuff '' . 
  i was like 12 years old . 
  still no reason to quite being polite ... 
  read it . 
  you were an idiot , for several and unquestionable reasons . 
  hope you learned your lesson . 
  it was ... mind you i 'm not trying to be offensive , just stating facts . 
  maybe back then it was n't so obvious how posting rl `` hard data '' ( profiles , pictures ) to the internet is so dangerous/comes back at you immediately , but taht was like ... going against all non-written rules of internet ( trolling ) . 
  you do win the tifu prize tho , this was indeed a fuck up !, 
  ` ats wot you git fer bein a smelly slaver . 
  interesting ? 
  i am a avid follower of all wp and w news . 
  i did not see any glimpse of it being available for samsung device ( s ) . 
  then again , this device is so uncommon it does n't surprise me anymore . 
  but in fact , insider app now does allow me to pick fast ring/slow ring and sends me off to firmware update as a follow-up after success . 
  on phone update , so far , i have only gotten errors ( network codes ) . 
  have tried on corporate wifi ( network error 80072ee7 ) and on the lunch restaurant wi-fi ( unknown error 800721e1 ) . 
  so , no dice . 
  will update if i find anything out . 
  disclaimer , am running 8.1 ctp ( 8.10.14203.306 ) with fw revision 2424.13.5.1 since my phone never cared to pick the official update . 
   then i pushed it to the right direction, 
  whoresome !, 
  thats fast track for you . 
  whelp , news :, 
  vulture after viper, 
  and in the end it was nothing . 
  after two updates , now running ** not ** even gdr2 :, 
  but hey , i 'm registered on the fast ring , so i got that going for me , wich is nice ... 
  i was planning to lurk a little more around the sub before posting an intro , but i have to give a solid cola on this one, 
  assuming its coca-cola ... coke ? 
  funny fact , cola in portugal ( europe ) is the designation for any tipe of unbranded cola-like soft drink . 
  ^ ( back to lurking ! ), 
  coffee and a cigarette . 
  breakfast for champions / s, 
  i 'm a programmer , i can handle it !, 
  very , very natural !, 
  i am signed up and did n't notice any news aswell : x, 
  ^ ( then again , i ca n't read soooooo ... ), 
  well if you have n't paid yet , consider steam indeed ... 
  oh i did see that one ... 
  i just didnt find it adequally addressed all the concerns of the player base regarding the issue . 
  while i do agree there may not be a clear advantage of owning a steam copy versus the `` regular '' version , i ca n't be convinced that , given previous feedback done by other redditors , and assuming that they are right , the operation of assigning steam keys to the existing player base would imply paying valve for those keys . 
  even if its for cosmetic reasons only , we are consumers , and * the consumer is always right * . 
  sort of . 
  i just mean , so many people complaining ca n't be wrong .
