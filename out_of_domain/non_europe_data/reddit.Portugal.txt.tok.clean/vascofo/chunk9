  myself included . 
  basically :, 
  ** if ** fd has to pay valve the 30 % whatever cut to assign steam keys to the existing player base , or if said keys ** can not ** be associated with our current profiles ( thus effectively giving a second copy of the game to everyone ) , i fully agree with you . 
  * this seems moronic , moreso taking into account the success the game is having on steam . 
  but hey , greedy gabe is greedy *, 
  ** if ** the so-said budget difference is calculated upon the idea that existing players may buy a second copy just to have it on steam , * and this sounds stupid , but it seems a lot of people are doing it * , then this is pure greed and bullshittery . 
  i do n't like nor want to believe this option , but it still seems the simpler/most apparent one . 
  we do n't want a second copy of the game . 
  we want our copy tied to steam version . 
  * it 's been done before ( do n't make me go look for sources ... ) * . 
  if this is impossible , then screw it . 
  but get valve on the phone saying it is not possible . 
  i get where your coming from - it 's a pretty extreme wording for a more complicated matter . 
  what i mean is , the sheer number of people complaining about it make it a valid point , more than the individual opinions of * it does n't add any value to the game *, 
  rofl that was pure dominance assertion right there, 
  `` hey , are you the other girl ? '', 
  thank you . 
  so gon na save this comment to rub on my wifes face later . 
  one more reason as to if the microsoft hololens behaves as announced , it will be huge . 
  where ma paste at ? 
  nope . 
  this is good news . 
  its one of my most used apps , and seriously flawless * except it could integrate with trakt * ** * cough *, 
   one that has a lot of focus on trading . 
   for example , would i be able to come and go into battles as i please ? 
  could an entire stream consist of exciting moments that will keep them engaged ? 
  in a combat zone , pretty much yes . 
  there 's always some conflict area somewhere nearby , with or without capital ships involved . 
  res and uss are more like hunting grounds rather than open battle area . 
  but cz 's are hardcore action non-stop mostly . 
   how steep is the learning curve for a casual gamer ? 
  steep . 
  unforgiving really . 
  but fun as hell . 
  oh , do remind : everyone is a murderous dick and will kill you because * heh * . 
  not true , but count on it . 
   what should i know before i jump in ? 
  always have insurance money in hand ( aka 10 % of your total ship value ) . 
  if you die without this , its pretty much perma-death . 
   how awesome is astra ? 
  do n't use it ... yet :-( must be awesome . 
  imho you should invest in a hotas tho . 
  i stand fiercely by the saytek x-52 , others will say the thrustmaster t1000 is more than enough ... game is definitely playable with kb+mo , but having an hotas is simply awesomeness . 
  the main advice i would give , and it 's really hard following it ( myself included ) is ... make the game about the fun , not the grind . 
  if you focus solely on getting that better ship , and you have to trade to achieve it asap , you 'll get lost in boredom . 
  this is a truly sandbox game , you can do pretty much whatever , and there is no real endgame so ... enjoy it the most from the start . 
  do n't get lost immediately thinking of a conda . 
   i 'm currently really digging these youtube videos i 'm watching right now . 
  too cool . 
  son , you 'll see how boring the videos are once you 're playing the game , 
  what if cortana was n't afraid of travelling - and worked regardless of regional settings ... 
   shave every part of your body , except for your head , make sure your junk is tied down . 
  this is where i would have gone the nope way . 
  there are some issues , but it works . 
  i 've gotten a couple bsods when closing supremme commander 2 for example , hard crashes with save file corruption on borderlands pre sequel , ctd 's when alt tabbing some games , but nothing too frustrating or constant . 
  i do however think installing tp to avoid paying a license wo n't do much for you on the medium-long run ... 
  but if i was on your toes i 'd definitely do that . 
  ca n't you get a free licence for being a student ? 
  i reckon a lot of schools are enrolled in soem way on ms affiliate programs / dreamspark programmes and windows licencing is pretty much standart there . 
  i do agree with the other redditors tho , given how you faced the whole situation , you should hold a grab of a copy of that yearbook and treasure it ... somthing along the lines of * it takes a real man to wear heels *, 
  pretty stable ... not perfect , but good . 
  been using as a semi heavy gamer for the past 3 releases . 
  thing is , if hololens applies a `` giant-screen '' with all visible area opaque , wo n't it be just like a vr headset ? 
  ar  vr if you think like this . 
  the opposite ca n't be done . 
  just look at all the space sims fans using hotas and rift . 
  the eternal struggle is using controls while in full immersion , because they ca n't see their fleshy appendices . 
  it seems to me that hololens would be able to do the opposite of whats been shown as well , i.e. 
  see your real hands and arms and your controllers ( keyboard , joystick whatever ) over a opaque , immersive cockpit . 
   if i do , it 's blood twice removed , like a transfusion from someone who 's had a transfusion before . 
  that was a stupid sentence . 
  this . 
  made my day . 
  somehow . 
  you need a really big lever and a fulcrum on which to place it . 
  kantrh 's strategy is silly . 
  you ca n't just grab a station by the edges . 
  * shrugs *, 
  and you still love it, 
  * plot twist * : op was fired not because he insulted the office , but because he ca n't edit a post properly . 
  more worried about infrastructure limitations/issues, 
  paste , you uncorporate filth !, 
  star citizen . 
  it 's basically e :d with a `` couple '' more million dollars thrown at it + not to be released before it 's ready . 
  so yeah , give it two years or so . 
  it 's coming up real nice tho ... 
  but the controls do n't seem as smooth as e :d , dunno , have n't checked in a while ( i 'm a cheap backer ), 
  that 's a form of pre release crowd sourcing . 
  all ships will be buyable with in-game currency after launch . 
  dunno about that . 
  have n't been much into sc lately really , the `` beta '' is too raw and e :d fills my space sim fancy a lot better . 
  damn , your wife just * asserted her dominance * all over you for that one . 
  this is a nice clean fun tifu ... and definitely a tifu !, 
   thanks world of warcraft , at least i got all classes on max level so it was kinda worth it, 
  stopped reading right here . 
  ( mainly because i can relate ), 
  well , word can now open pdf files from 2013 on . 
  yes , they do ... you do n't even have to have tech preview on mobile . 
  usefulness is overrated !, 
  `` what , you want to know about boring old some chemist dude ?
