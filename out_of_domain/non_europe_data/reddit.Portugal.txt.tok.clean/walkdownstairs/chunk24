  maybe it 's because i 'm a girl , and that my parents are protective , but i never even rode a bike as a passenger !, 
  they do go crazy fast and once on the highway i saw a guy that was going waaay too fast ... easily around 150kmph , which idk how much is in mph !, 
  i 'm in portugal , so the minimum driving age is 18 . 
  are teen drivers common in the states ( assuming you 're from there ) ? 
  16 year olds from around here seem to be way too immature for driving , so it boggles me a little . 
  i 'm always afraid i 'll end up doing some crazy thing or crash into a tree or something !, 
  sometimes my dad takes me to the forest so i can practice with handling his car ... really , i almost drove into a tree and i did n't have to drive too much for it to happen either !, 
  i wonder though , what are the most common car brands over there ? 
  here we get a lot of opel , volkswagen , renault and generally european manufacturers . 
  maybe i should boast on reddit when i get my drivers license haha, 
  it 'll probably take me about 3 months ... but i 'll get it until the end of senior year . 
  which do you think is the best ? 
  what grade is junior year ? 
  i always mix up juniors and sophomores haha, 
  thanks !, 
  i guess i do n't watch enough movies to have it memorised haha, 
  it 's normal for non-natives to mix them up , i suppose !, 
  especially when you do n't live or hear the expressions often haha, 
  i know i still get troubled by some expressions in general . 
  or that my vocabulary in certain areas is very poor !, 
  i do n't . 
  i do n't think i 'll even get any by now , i used to think motorcycles were very convenient because of their size and cost . 
  cars are more expensive to maintain , right ? 
  well , i 'd guess starting from a certain point , motorcycles become even more expensive . 
  say , the very fast/potent ones . 
  also , 3-4 seconds is crazy enough , so less than that sounds like asking for trouble !, 
  i bet they do n't sell those to about anyone without proper verification of the driver , right ? 
  in my country we use numbers in ascending order , from 1 to 12 . 
  but in france , for instance , they start counting down from a certain grade . 
  like counting the years you 've got left , rather than the time you 've been in school !, 
  then i 'm not even sure how dutch or germans say it . 
  ah , general vocabulary , sure , but specific , no way !, 
  and even when i look it up i end up forgetting it if i do n't use it . 
  it 's mostly specific stuff . 
  like right now i do n't remember the name of the 1st pedal on the left , though i looked it up a few weeks ago !, 
  are planning to follow it through or is it too much ? 
  oh yes , i ca n't believe i have n't even thought of that !, 
  maybe motorcycles are n't that practical after all haha, 
  i guess you also need to really want to drive one too , since they 're quite dangerous . 
  certainly !, 
  just now i 'm looking at a page with lots of vocabulary for specific teams ; i 'll give all the themes a look and do what you said !, 
  and yes !, 
  it is the clutch , thank you !, 
  i have a cork board on my left ... maybe i can write down and pin the words there !, 
  what is it ? 
  the speed or the accidents ? 
  ah , i see better what you mean now . 
  i 'd add my 2 cents about it but my driving experience is very limited . 
  a total of about 5 minutes with my dad , where once i was driving towards the recycling cans and braked all the way the wheels screeched or the time i almost hit a tree ... 
  if it helps , i had n't had any driving class and my dad was instructing me and i was scared shitless . 
  i 'm pretty sure this ca n't be taken as a model example haha, 
  yeah , i think that 's the best approach to it . 
  taking my experience , people want to know which country i like best , where it feels more like home . 
  so sometimes i feel home is where i was born , then other times i feel home is where i grew up . 
  it 's having to choose something to settle , rather than just say both . 
  when presenting myself to other people and they ask me where i 'm from i always say `` i was born in x , but grew up in y. '', 
  because i consider myself to be from both x and y. 
  ** tl ; dr ** : first time flying alone and i had no idea what to do . 
  a kind man decided he could spare his time to help me throughout the trip and gave me a contact card at the arrival so i can call someone in case something goes wrong . 
  i keep his card in my wallet to this day . 
  i was 16 and on my first plane trip ever , alone and without my parents . 
  next to me sat this man , possibly in his late 30s and i noticed he was carrying his luggage with him . 
  at checkout i dropped my huge ass luggage and only took my backpack , but for some reason thought `` hey maybe i should 've brought my luggage with me ... ? '' . 
  i pulled myself together and started asking about it , whether or not i should 've taken it with me . 
  he was incredibly kind to explain me everything . 
  then we kept talking ; he had been in my city for a business trip and that was his second time flying that week alone . 
  he offered to guide me through all the process and i was so relieved . 
  though i had reserved a place that was way too far from him and i realised i did n't know what to do at the arrival ... so i got up , faked going to the bathroom , picked up my backpack and looked for him in the plane , hoping the seat next to him was n't taken . 
  it was n't . 
  i sat next to him and we spent the following 2 hours talking about so many things , all in good joy and it seemed that both were enjoying the conversation . 
  once we were flying over germany , i remember him showing me the aerial view of the cologne cathedral , huge and gorgeous . 
  at the arrival , he offered to stay with me until i got my luggage from the conveyor but i declined , so we parted ways at the escalator since he had no luggage to claim . 
  he gave me his contact card and told me to call him if something went wrong ( lost luggage , host family not showing up , etc ) . 
  he knocked on the window and waved at me , then we parted ways and i 've never seen him again . 
  thank you , j\u00f6rg . 
  i 've kept your card in my wallent ever since . 
  i actually sent him an e-mail a month after the occurrence to express my gratitude !, 
  i feel like i should n't bother him anymore , i would n't have anything more to add to what i said in that e-mail . 
  i dig that sweater . 
  i want that sweater . 
  and that hair too . 
  i 'm learning how to drive and that 's exciting . 
  except waking up at 6am , but it 's still awesome !, 
  i have the instructor right there on the passenger seat just in case , so it 's the positive thrill !, 
  that i 'm too serious . 
  ooooooooh boy . 
  i 've had 3 people in my life tell me they `` did n't take to me at first '' , they do n't think that anymore !, 
  knew it . 
  i 'm romanian and while looking at you i instantly remembered so many guys i know !, 
  especially because of pic # 2 and # 3 . 
  great transformation though , you look absolutely stunning . 
  cheers !, 
  so late to the train , but congratulations , op !!, 
  make the most out of it , best of luck ,
