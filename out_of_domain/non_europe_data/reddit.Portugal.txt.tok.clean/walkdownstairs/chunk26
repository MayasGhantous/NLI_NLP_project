  i was going to cologne/k \u00f6ln , so when we were flying over it , i remember him showing me the cathedral from the plane 's window . 
  it was huge and it stood out in the city easily . 
  when the plane landed , safely , we got off and he guided me until the baggage claim . 
  before following our own ways , he asked me if i wanted him to stay with me until my luggage came , to which i replied : `` thanks s\u00f6ren , but i 'll pass it . 
  i 'm grateful enough you guided me both here and in lisbon . 
  that itself made this first experience really calm and not troublesome at all for me , so thank you for that . 
  i 'd feel bad to make you stick with a teen just for luggage while i 'm sure you 've got more important places to be . '', 
  he asked if i was sure and i replied affirmatively . 
  he did n't have any luggage to claim ( that 's why he only had his somewhat big luggage with him at the beginning ) so he followed through the `` no baggage to claim corridor '' while i made my way downstairs to the baggage claim . 
  in the end , he knocked lightly on the glass to get my attention . 
  i looked towards the noise source and there he was smiling and waving . 
  i did the same and proceeded to go down the escalator until we were definitely apart . 
  thus said , i really liked meeting you , s\u00f6ren , and despite the age difference , i really liked the extensive conversation we had about some pretty silly subjects . 
  you made my entire experience so much better and anxiety-free , so i 'd be glad to meet you again one day !, 
  edit : i apologise for the size !, 
  basically , mc goes into the house and each floor is a separate world with different characteristics from the previous . 
  they must fight they way out , or else you !, 
  decide the consequences . 
  i 've got this fear of drowning and i 'd be unable to dive/swim into deep waters ( deep being a measure where my feet ca n't touch the ground unless i completely submerge my body while standing up ) . 
  well , i ca n't even swim to begin with , but i 'd like to learn . 
  i 'm more curious about the latter part . 
  does the voice sound feminine if you 're a girl , masculine if you 're a guy or it does n't depend on your gender at all ? 
  context : i 'm a teen who 's worried about her food intake ( low ) and i 'd like to get advice from someone on how to better my situation before i start feeling too sick from not eating enough . 
  it 's not anorexia or anything similar to it as my problem is just that i do n't like eating/don ' t feel like it . 
  / r/health seems to be for news related to health . 
  i do n't think my issue is relevant enough for / r/askdocs, 
  / r/diet and similar subreddits seem to be mainly directed to people who want to lose weight/get fit, 
  / r/asknutritionists seems to be what i 'm looking for , but it 's too small of a community to get almost instantaneous advice . 
  help , please and thanks . 
  edit : corrected some typos/mistaken words, 
  update : done !, 
  thanks for the help , reddit !, 
  this sunday the 6th me and the other members of a club i 'm in are going to do a garage sale of sorts and we need phrases that relate to the whole idea of `` sharing is caring '' . 
  i could come up with the some sentences , but i do n't want them to be boring , you see . 
  perhaps add a bit of humour or originality to it . 
  thanks in advance !, 
  edit : i 'll have to translate them to portuguese , so if you speak it , yeah . 
  i 'd love to make it a hobby of mine , especially to make my own wallpapers and add my own flare to things . 
  i have photoshop white rabbit and sai in my possession as graphic tools ( i use them mostly for digital drawing ) . 
  i also have a bamboo pen and touch tablet and access to free fonts , as everyone else . 
  is there anything else i should get ? 
  i 've heard about adobe illustrator ; is it better ? 
  and if it is , is there a free alternative to it ? 
  thanks in advance !, 
  i 'm a 16 year old female who weights 49kg and heights 1,60 m. 
  people tell me i should put on a few extra kilos , but i do n't know . 
  i do skip meals sometimes , but it 's only because i do n't particularly enjoy eating nor do i feel excited about it . 
  when i eat it usually includes salads , fish or meat ( both on a regular basis ) , lots of rice and soup from time to time . 
  i eat at least a piece of fruit almost every day . 
  i workout at home sometimes . 
  i 'm a hs student myself and after having the same teachers for a few years ( well , mostly ) and seeing them weekly for many months made me realise the teachers do know us very , very well . 
  with enough time some can read us like a book and help us even if we do n't figure it out until later on . 
  i have a couple of teachers i absolutely love and hope to keep contact even after i graduate and go to university . 
  i wonder how does it feel for a teacher to give classes to a kid from 7th to 12th grade . 
  that 's basically watching them grow and evolve !, 
  do teachers get somewhat fond/befriend some students even after hs ends ? 
  edit : * most probable future . 
  yeah , i do n't proof-read with due care . 
  yeah , it affects my grades slightly . 
  i 'm new to this and i have no routine whatsoever . 
  i want to begin a routine for my oily skin but i do n't have much money to spare on products ; but i do have these laying around since my mum does n't use any of them . 
  i read the faq , sidebar and everything , but being new to this , i 'm not really an expert in distinguishing what ingredients are harmful and which are an okay . 
  so of course i need you , skin gurus , to help me !, 
  by now i should 've mentioned i 'm in portugal and my choices may be a little limited . 
  i did n't really check at the mall for the available skincare products , but i might do it tomorrow . 
  ingredients for :, 
  * [ clinique youth surge spf15 age decelerating moisturizer - combination oily to oily ] ( http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_58c423723.html ),

  the dove rich nourishment cream 's ingredients are hopefully legible in the picture . 
  there 's this file i was sent last year in april, 
  it 's called `` ensaio universo.pdf '' and i really want to see it again . 
  i have the url that redirected me to it , but when i try to access it , it was that the file was deleted or that the url is wrong . 
  now i tried accessing a cache version of that document but i did n't quite know how to do it so i did n't get any results . 
  tried pasting the url on wayback at internetarchive but i got no results . 
  seeing that it was most likely hosted on google drive then delete , is there any way i can see it again ? 
  i would 've gone to / r/digitaldarkage but i ca n't access it now and i 'm nearly desperate . 
  i do not have contact with the author anymore and i can not get contact with them . 
  is this a lost cause ? 
  i was trying to skype with my boyfriend today but it was n't being cooperative at all . 
  the calls had poor quality and lagged every 5 minutes or so to the point we had to stop . 
  it was becoming a nuisance . 
  i 'm pretty sure both our internet connections were stable . 
  do you guys experience the same with skype ? 
  as in , melting the entire lip balm and add some other scent ? 
  i should 've paid another $ 0.50 and stuck to babylips . 
  i 'd like to write her something warm and friendly ; you get the drill , nothing too formal . 
  something along the lines of `` ca n't wait to meet you again '' or `` you 'll always have a friend in me '' . 
  thank you in advance , 
  hi / r/romania , i 'll introduce myself clearly : i 'm a traitor of the nation who has moved countries at a young age and ended up being unable to talk romanian properly as a result . 
  entire family and ancestors born in romania and all went down the drain when my parents and i moved . 
  i can somewhat understand romanian as long is it 's not too specific ( salut oricare regiune din rom\u00e2nia ) but i suck at speaking it . 
  i probably speak as good as your next-door hungarian neighbour . 
  so i figured what better way than to * at least * learn standard romanian . 
  ** tl ; dr ** - born in romanian with mostly romanian ancestry and ca n't speak it properly , willing to change that by watching people speak romanian on youtube . 
  ** edit ** : i did n't think it could be important but i 'm female , so beauty channels / vloggers is fair game as well . 
  i got the game a couple days ago and ever since spent my time playing with a combination of my index , middle and ring fingers . 
  right hand plays , left hand holds the phone . 
  my android notified me of a software update , but it needed space .
