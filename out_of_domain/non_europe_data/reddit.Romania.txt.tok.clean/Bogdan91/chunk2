  i 'm not the op , but i can tell you what i know about them :, 
  bulgaria - more corrupt than us with a huge mafia issue and more violent than us . 
  i 've heard a lot of horror stories with romanian tourists . 
  hungary - extremists . 
  moldova - russian brainwashed brothers . 
  ukraine - the russian dudes . 
  serbia - bro 's \uff0c i think the only ones with whom we do n't have a beef . 
  nope , it 's a small boring city with nothing to do if you 're not into shitty loud clubs .

  shut up dude ... 
   100,000 to 200,000 dollars, 
  that 's just wrong ... 
  i do n't know anything about us students , but i think it 's free even for non-eu students . 
  in any case , it shouldnt cost more than 2000 $ a year . 
  in my college ( computer science ) where some uae ( or some arabic country ) students that signed up but did n't attend at all and they all had free scholarships . 
   4,000 to 7,000 usd, 
  not really , 1usd it 's almost 1 euro ( 1.08 $ = 1 euro ) . 
  anyhow , i still do n't think it costs this much for non-eu students . 
  and do n't forget about erasmus , i 've heard great things . 
   which politician and which political party ? 
  i could tell there was some sort of bias but i could n't really make out in favor of who . 
  dan voiculescu and the party is pc ( partidul conservator ) .

   peering outside of the country is probably shit, 
  reaaaally ? 
  this is my result with the cheapest 100mbs 8 $ / month : http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/4314811773 with a server from us was this : http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/4314819543 at 1 am . 
  and they are all made from a laptop connected to a really , really crappy tenda wireless router - the cheapest i 've seen from auchan . 
   viteze de transfer ( download ) de pana la 1000 mbps ( download speeds in the local network ), 
  viteze de upload in internet 30 mbps ( upload speeds in internet ), 
  viteze de upload in retea 100 mbps ( upload speed in the local network ), 
  as you can see in my speedtest.net tests , they are higher than the speeds mentioned in rds-rcs plan ; i think it depends on how much the network is used , i do n't know . 
  here 's the thing , we do n't need huge speeds outside our country because most of the pirated content is already on private romanian trackers - you do n't have any ideea how big piracy is in romania . 
  imho , our problem are the wireless networks which offer 300 mb for 6 $ including voice plan ( prepay ) . 
  last year i was getting 600mb , but since cosmote and romtelecom merged as telekom , they started to offer even crappier offers . 
  vodafone and orange are offering the same deals . 
  for example , vodafone offers 10gb traffic for 12 $ , without voice plan . 
  the good news is rds-rcs ( my carrier ) has started to offer wireless plans , but has wireless coverage only in the cities and uses vodafone infrastructure ( voice with 100mb outside ) in the countryside .

   yeah , i 'm not gon na pay 14k $ for a fudging domain with my last name on it . 
  the domain owner will be lucky to get 100 $ for a domain name made from a romanian last name . 
  thanks for your offer but the seller is not interested to sell at that level . 
  good luck with you project .

   he refused on a $ 2500 server + licenses . 
  it died on friday , he begged us to get it up by monday , he could n't make payroll and his employees were pissed . 
  why did you recommend a 2500 $ server when there are a lot of hosting companies out there ? 
  where 's gadea ? 
  except gypsies and hungarians ( in the centre of the country ) , nope . 
  as for poverty , mostly in the countryside .

   can i assume that a small number of romanians in cluj know some basic hungarian and wo n't be angry if i asked `` limba maghiara '' ? 
  do n't worry bro , as a suggestion you can also say `` am venit sa fur ederly '' . 
  they might appear angry , but trust me , it 's a custom when meeting foreigners . 
  jokes aside , you could use google translate on your smartphone ( android ) . 
  the app has a voice feature that records , translates and plays in the desired language .
