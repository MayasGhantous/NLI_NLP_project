  because i was sure he was a reverse trap until the discussion about his voice in the en dub . 
  he 's not the only person who speaks in third person though, 
  the impresssion he was giving me was sort of `` salary man who speaks like a little kid '' haha, 
  i 'm willing to bet that pretty much the entire alt-right movement is < 10k people . 
  sure there are a lot of * racists * but the actual white supremacy activists people are worried about are few . 
  compare that to millions of people who passively agree with `` though on crime '' stances or would rather kill a woman than let her abort and i just ca n't be arsed to care about this latest boogeyman . 
  even charlottesville , someone showed me a pretty damning video of someone slamming a pipe into the back of the car right before it accelerated into the crowd . 
  i remember avon selling those wristbands and saying they donated the money from them to the fight against aids . 
  that 's ridiculous sure , but there still are a lot of actual racists . 
  people who would n't want their daughters dating black guys , who are loudly outspoken against whichever minority they hate , who think police killings are okay because a black kid who was shot in bed because the police mistook the house must have deserved it somehow . 
  although i also think these `` progressives '' crying wolf at everything under the sun are doing more harm then the above guys by alienating moderates and people on the fence to becoming moderates , who might not trust a given minority for whatever reason but would change given exposure to them - telling these people they 're racists monsters will only radicalise them in the other direction . 
  interjecting the occasional kid word ? 
  or just leave the third person with no other caveman grammar . 
  it 'd have been weird enough in english . 
  my grandmother puts in everything and i 've had to eat it all my childhood / until i turned 18 . 
  it still tastes gross . 
  south korea might be a better point of comparison . 
  less about the `` it 's the us 's fault but now they 're ok '' , more about `` country in a terrible situation after a war successfully rebuild '' . 
  do you have any source with numbers ? 
  it 's an interesting subject . 
  that 's usually what happens . 
  or just use naoto full stop . 
  they could remake eo iii while still having eovi be the last `` new '' game in the series . 
  i hope they do this at least . 
  i think they meant something more like `` i do n't think you 're morally faulty '' rather than `` i do n't think you 're factually wrong '' , since the second the second is pretty much the definition of atheism . 
  would `` a divine being in heaven '' be better ? 
  `` a magical man in the sky '' is the same thing with more flippant words . 
  okay , but have you seen real life ? 
  christians tend to be super protective of their beliefs and atheist are almost universally the `` outgroup '' . 
  it 's not uncommon to hear that atheists do n't have morality , will burn in hell , are pitiful etc. 
  i find it hard to imagine any atheist who is not at least a little against organised religion . 
  i can even think of many theists who are against organised religion . 
  because it 's the internet , and being flippant about - everything - is basically internet culture . 
  i 've never heard anything similar to `` magical being in the sky '' from an atheist in real life and doubt it 's something people actually say . 
  the trump/ivanka nonsense feels like the democrat version of obama-is-a-muslim-immigrant . 
  i do n't think that picture is weird . 
  generally speaking , i see trump as a big orange poser with a foot permanently lodged in his mouth , who has been holding the idiot ball ever since the campaign started , and who ca n't seem to filter himself at all . 
  this is my context . 
  it sounds more likely to me that he 's just being embarrassing and blurting things out without thinking than that he wants to have sex with his daughter . 
  that 's about cold wheather . 
  people feel the `` draft '' when there 's 40c outside . 
  you should go to the dentist . 
  that sounds like an infection . 
  lol i keep having to argue with my coworkers that we need tu turn the ac on if it 's 26c inside draft be damned . 
  16 would cause them to freeze . 
  it shows as 13.28 for me . 
  i have n't opted in because i ca n't shake the superstitious belief that i 'm somehow more likely to die if my death will save another life . 
  it 's not rational , it goes against everything else i believe and it 's stupid . 
  but i ca n't shake it . 
  i would n't opt out if the government signed me up though . 
  ** it 's a vacuum-sealed empty bag, 
  i 'm not . 
  the amazon representative said something about regional pricing , which is shitty when they force us onto the amazon.com store . 
  they do n't have to mention it because it 's obvious to the target audience . 
  or a double bed with two mattresses , the kind you see in hotels around europe . 
  that way you can have the comfort of not sleeping alone but you also basically have your own bed . 
  i 've never had a phone for more than 3 years before something happened to it . 
  my previous phone got left in a taxi by accident . 
  the phone before that had a cracked screen after 3 years and a fucky battery since it fell into the toilet once . 
  the phone before that become obsolete because the android version on it was too old and it had too little internal memory to do much on it . 
  the phone before that got stolen etc, 
  i do n't think longevity is something phones are meant to be good at . 
  they 're fragile electronic devices you carry in you pocket or your hands everywhere , it 's more realistic to expect to just buy the cheapo version of the current flagship phone every two/three years . 
  just a guess : non-disclosure agreements, 
  i imagine a lot of women with it wo n't have the impulse control to not drink during pregnancy , so it `` inherits '' . 
  why not have the world be more like the secular nations of sweden and japan ? 
  russia 's population was still deeply religious even through communism . 
  i 'm not sure if you could call it underground in a country where everyone openly believes in god . 
  in communist romania at least it 's known that the priests were collaborating with the government secret police in exchange for keeping their parishes . 
  asta e scuza , dar motivul real pentru care cred asta e fiindca vape-ul e ceva gen 99 % mai sanatos si o trecere in masa la tigari electronice as scqde masiv riscul de cancer la nivel de populatie . 
  respect vs consecinte . 
  merci ca in sfarsit ajungi la idea la care bateam initial . 
  ai reactionat la exemple random . 
  i do n't really like the lighting / how the textures looking ue compared to proprietary engines of companies . 
  although i 'm also maybe the only person who 's glad persona 5 was n't 60fps , 60fps makes me dizzy . 
   which was pretty much every smt fan at the time of iv 's release, 
  strange journey is the one smt game i 've been putting off for ages for no reason . 
  marin karin was the least of it . 
  once mitsuru learns concentrate she will always do that when the boss has an opening instead of attacking . 
  so for p3fes , to enjoy it :, 
  1 ) use tactics and pay attention to turn order, 
  huh i should look into the emulator since it looks like we 're not getti g a pc or ps4 release . 
  shipping costs # 2 anywhere in the eu , so this is especially interesting for people like me who do n't live in the uk . 
  i bought both of dr kawashima 's brain training games ( # 7.99 and # 8.99 regular price ) , since i heard good things about them . 
  i 'd appreciate if you guys could point out other games worth getting with this promotion . 
  i 've never really been into mmos , but a friend is and he wants us to play something together . 
  i 'm new to this genre , and for the longest time i even hated it ... but i want to give it a chance . 
  ** games played : ** i tried path of exile , but the camera angle bothered me so much that i could n't continue , despite the game being pretty good otherwise . 
  other than that , i 've only played single players ( i like jrpgs , srpgs and dragon age ), 
  ** preferred genres : ** fantasy ( please no military ), 
  ** pricing model : ** i 'd prefer free to play , but i guess i do n't mind either way, 
  ** favorite features : ** i do n't even know what this is, 
  ** eastern or western : ** eastern . 
  i 'm very comfortable with jrpgs, 
  ** combat type : ** no shooters . 
  other than that , i do n't have a preference, 
  ** preferred perspective : ** over the shoulder i guess ? 
  ( third person , camera behind the character . 
  the camera can be farther away , that 's ok too - but please no top-down ), 
  ** graphics preference : ** no burly white men ?
