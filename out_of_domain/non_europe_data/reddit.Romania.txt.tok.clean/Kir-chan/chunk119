  i like colourful art i guess . 
  i 'm fine as long as the graphics look better than ps2 games from 2005 . 
  ** released or upcoming : ** released1, 
  ** platform : ** pc or browser-based, 
  i was thinking of smt imagine at first , but then i discovered that game was taken down . 
  thank you for your help !, 
  smtiv is coming out in september , and because they 're pricing it so low i 'll have money to buy an extra game . 
  i wanted curtain call at first because i like final fantasy music and never tried a real rhythm game , but then i saw the opening video nintendo posted for fantasy life . 
  it looks stunning and now i do n't know which one to go for . 
  what do you guys think ? 
  what will you be buying ? 
  edit : will be getting fantasy life , thanks guys !, 
  we drink water and eat salt . 
  so why not salt water ? 
  i just started playing khfm ( the one with the english translation patch ) a few days ago , mostly because i do n't have a ps3 to play 1.5 and did n't want to miss out on the fun . 
  i started it on hard , expecting it to be more like kh2 proud mode ... ugh , i 'm in agrabah ( just entered the cave of wonders ) and i 'm starting to seriously regret it , because even the random encounters keep killing me . 
  i also spent over an hour fiddling with gummi blocks yesterday because i could n't reach the new world . 
  it 's * really hard * . 
  my question ... is it worth continuing or should i just restart it on normal ? 
  i get the feeling i 'd have a lot more fun on normal , but the thought of replaying the whole thing ... plus , it kind of feels like giving up . 
  i got a * skeleton * from ozzie once . 
  he said he thought of me when he saw it . 
  ^ ... then ^ i ^ visited ^ him ^ and ^ his ^ house ^ was ^ arranged ^ like ^ a ^ classroom . 
  ^ that ^ instantly ^ made ^ it ^ triple ^ creepy . 
  so what 's the strangest/creepiest/funniest gift a villager has ever given you ? 
  the official site still says it 's coming in september , but that ca n't be true . 
  the mobile site just says 2014 . 
  do we have any date yet ? 
  how did this game get a rating this low . 
  we have demon designs ( including mishaguji who is literally a penis on a pole , ometeotl , who is practically goatse , tlazolteotl , who ... ugh yuck , as well as other series favorites ) , the violence , the cussing ( tayama : `` blow me . 
  '' ) , torture , and all sorts of nasty things we love about the series that i thought would raise a rating . 
  our dog has been having trouble with some unknown allergy which may or may not be food related and our vet recommended the prescription brands of royal canine , virbac or hill 's . 
  but we stumbled across a problem : all of them are very expensive . 
  royal canine veterinary and virbac in particular are way out of our budget . 
  the food we have been feeding him for the past two months is taste of the wild high prairie . 
  before that he had purizon chicken & fish ( which he reacted badly to ) , and before that more taste of the wild , alternating between high prairie and wetlands every 2 months , with one instance of acana . 
  the website we buy food from is zooplus , because they have a good selection of everything and they have a website for my country . 
  before this website , we tried locally available dog food ( pedigree , friskies , purina , royal canine ) and he reacted terribly to all of them . 
  i 've been looking into hypo-allergenic dog food from other brands . 
  [ greenwood 's ] ( http://www.zooplus.co.uk/shop/zooplus_exclusives/dog_food_treats/greenwoods/dry_dog_food/429937 ) looks good , but i ca n't find any reviews for it . 
  would this be a good choice for my golden retriever ? 
  there is also a taste of the wild with a single meat source , [ sierra mountain ] ( http://www.zooplus.co.uk/shop/dogs/dry_dog_food/taste_of_the_wild/409314 ) that looks promising . 
  thanks in advance !, 
  e nasol si la euro si dolar , dar lira a sarit brusc in sus pe 14/15 . 
  i opened my case to add a new harddrive and to clean it , and while checking it over before cleaning it i noticed something that looks like a burn :, 
  i have n't noticed problems with my computer , but i ca n't imagine something that looks like that being a good thing ... should i be worried ? 
  the motherboards is a two year old gigabyte 970a-d3 . 
  thank you in advance . 
  i updated my nvidia driver today and discovered , to my horror , that * everything is moving * . 
  it was n't moving before . 
  grass , tress , their shadows . 
  this is really bothering me and it has a huge performance impact on my game . 
  my system is below the recommended specs and i was playing it on a good medium-high hybrid at a comfortable 30-35 fps . 
  now it keeps freezing and crashing . 
  i also think it looks bad ( grass is swaying * through planks and rocks * , the bushes look like paper , the edges are n't smooth , little bits of moving greenery generate as i get near them ... all this was there before , but i was n't noticing it because it was n't moving ) . 
  i rolled my driver back , but this did n't do anything . 
  is there any setting somewhere i could try ? 
  i 'm not above mucking around in the game 's files . 
  and how come most other people ca n't smell it ? 
  my grandmother loves her roasted eggplant and is roasting some now , and the smell has pretty much permeated everything in the apartment . 
  it smells like a someone is burning the contents of a public toilet . 
  holy shit i wish i saved some money . 
  [ removed ], 
  at one point , i had my locale set to japanese for a few months because i played a vn that required that . 
  during that time , * something * from mcafee installed itself to my computer , and i have n't the faintest idea why because i 'm the only one who uses it and i do n't remember accepting it . 
  this was 2 years . 
  since then i 've been unable to remove mcafee . 
  the removal tool does n't work , i ca n't seem to make an account on the mcafee community ( i just ca n't get past their captcha , and god knows i tried ) , the chat support does n't get me anyone . 
  is there anything i can do , short of formatting the entire hard drive ? 
  thank you . 
  i 'm running windows 7 sp1 , if that helps . 
  found this on youtube , it 's awesome - someone took komaeda and some other character 's sound files and mixed them into a story about komaeda getting stalked by a shsl stalker . 
  link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=troswrvhx3y, 
  it 's a 3 year old video , so i hope it 's not a repost . 
  since it did n't have subs , i tried my hand at translating it , and posted the translation [ here ] ( http://squeekirie.tumblr.com/post/146857409047/translation-to-that-komaeda-x-yandere-stalker-mad ) . 
  i was diagnosed with anti-immune hypothyroidism and put on levothyroxine , 12.5 mg to start with . 
  it 's not the first time i 've taken it , and i always gave up because of the laundry list of side effects ( seriously , even metformin is gentler ) . 
  my base glucose jumped up to 150 in a few days and i ca n't get it down : / not even with proper keto . 
  i think i 'm going to have to stop taking it . 
  is anyone else managing diabetes + hypothyroidism ? 
  how are you doing it ? 
  i 've always thought of myself as a pretty security conscious person , to the point where i even have an antivirus on my phone . 
  but today i got hit by cerberus ransomware on my work computer ... no sensitive files were lost , because we use a virtual server for nearly everything and that was n't affected , but my local device needs to be formatted . 
  what leaves me stumped is the * how * . 
  the only emails i get on my local device are company newsletters . 
  i did n't connect any usb device . 
  i browsed a few websites , but they were all websites of local universities , online shops ( big ones like amazon and ebay , smaller ones that did n't look shady either ) , and webcomics like xkcd and smbc . 
  even then i do most of my browsing from the virtual server , because we still have internet explorer 8 locally . 
  mcafee did n't react at all . 
  i thought virus infections happened when you visited shady websites , or opened attachments from unknown sources . 
  things like that . 
  but this ransomware showed up out of the blue - how can something like this happen ? 
  * ** total budget and country of purchase : **, 
  romania . 
  i 'd ideally like a laptop around 500-600 eur , but my limit is 750 eur . 
  * ** do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor , good battery life or best specifications for the money ? 
  pick or include any that apply . 
  balanced i suppose . 
  best specifications sounds better . 
  * ** how important is weight and thinness to you ?
