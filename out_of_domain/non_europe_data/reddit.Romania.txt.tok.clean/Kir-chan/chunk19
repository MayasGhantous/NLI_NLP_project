  in those locations both parents should be held equally accountable * - i 'd even go a step further , charge * both * of them child support if they have a liveable income and abandoned the child . 
  i know the laws do n't reflect this though ... 
  edit : within reason , ofc . 
  rape victims excluded . 
  and minors ( unless both were minors ) . 
  look , i 'm not for `` nonconsensual parenthood '' . 
  i 'm as pro-choice as they come , and i 've described my ideal situation . 
  but * lacking * that , is where we disagree . 
  lacking a means to terminate an existing pregnancy , i believe both parents should be held responsible , not just the woman . 
  i 've heard of people being put in jail/prison ( in the us ) for guessing passwords . 
  hacking laws are pretty ridiculous everywhere . 
  is there even an average sentence ? 
  if metacritics posts a slew of terrible reviews and prevents 700k from going to that movie , would they also be sentenced ? 
  yes , i 'd stop watching random movies i 'm not particularly interested in . 
  or just watch them on tv , like i did 10-15 years ago . 
  or on netflix , if i had that . 
  it 's more comparable to pirating a console game 8 years ago , when the emulators were buggy pieces of shit . 
  if you were prepared to play it despite the trouble , chances are you really were n't intending to buy it . 
  same for watching a terrible camrip . 
  to put it into perspective , 779k is roughly the population of carmel , indiana . 
  worldwide it 's a very low number . 
  torrent downloads , i imagine . 
  including people who did n't actually watch it , or just watched a scene , or just checked the quality etc, 
  who says none of those 779 000 people actually went to watch it ? 
  i know a lot of people who do this sort of thing , and i have a friend who does this for * every * movie she goes to watch . 
  they count each time you download the torrent file , iirc . 
  meaning you could download the . torrent and not open it , or download it multiple times ( because you misplaced or deleted it ) , or open it but never finish downloading the movie . 
  there might be special programs that keep track of the actual downloads from a bittorent program , but i do n't personally know of any ( i 'm hardly an expert though ) . 
  and a nice hefty fine is n't a bad enough punishment for something like this ? 
   false allegation against unrwa, 
  number of people who are surprised : too fucking many . 
  because i do n't know the answer . 
  i replied because i find the concept of `` potential lost sales = theft '' ridiculous . 
  edit : not saying the guy is n't a criminal , but the scope of the punishment is ridiculous . 
  nice . 
  * very * nice . 
  edit : i hope we 'll get to walk through the original world that never was sometime , it 's such a beautiful world . 
  i wonder what it looked like before it - died ? 
  was forgotten ? 
  ... now i wonder what happened to it . 
  but first , start by blaming * the police who committed a crime while on duty * . 
  nice for spain . 
  they are n't one of the eu countries right next to ukraine . 
  but think of the carpet !, 
  they 're on sale in moldova . 
  does n't it already fall under animal cruelty laws ? 
  critical mode on this game so freaking hard . 
  i usually play plain hard , i tried critical for my second playthrough on ddd and i ca n't even get through the tutorial . 
  [ or that recent case where a woman struggled while she could n't get oxygen after the police assaulted her out of nowhere , dragging her naked into the corridor and pepper-spraying her 4-year old son . 
  ] ( http://gawker.com/nypds-brutal-arrest-of-half-naked-woman-captured-on-vid-1615047977 ), 
  edit : minor grammar, 
  but there * were no # 2.3 million in damages * . 
  that number is * potentially lost sales * , and is bullshit because of a variety of reasons . 
  the * actual * sales they lost was the # 1000 the guy earned off their hard work . 
  he should be prosecuted for that , not for other imaginary numbers . 
  me neither . 
  not a fan of sitcoms . 
  are you seriously saying the police * are innocent in the ferguson shooting case ? 
  it 's not a philosophical debate if you can get sent into prison for it . 
  fact is , the guy committed a crime . 
  that is clear : recording , sale and distribution of * copyrighted content . 
  * however * , # 2.3 million is a bogus number which he should * not * be punished for . 
  even the 700k downloads is a bogus number , because you do n't know :, 
  a ) whether someone who downloaded it watched the movie previously or afterwards at the cinema ( yes , a lot of people do this ), 
  b ) how many of those who downloaded it actually * watched * it . 
  c ) how many of those people downloaded the . torrent file or the camrip more than once . 
  d ) how many of those * global * 700k downloads come from areas where the movie is unavailable in cinema , or areas which do n't even have a cinema < - yes , these people are illegally watching the movie , however : they can not be counted as a lost sale because , for whatever reason , they are * physically incapable * of paying to see it . 
  770 000 views globally is , after all , not a lot . 
  edit : pirated -  copyrighted, 
  the dinosaur egg was first , yes , but the chicken came before the * chicken egg * . 
  a dinosaur ca n't lay a ` chicken egg ' , after all . 
  ( what do you mean this was n't actually a question ), 
  i mean , before it became the world that `` never was '' . 
  hmm , maybe it 's a world that lost its heart and essentially became a `` nobody '' in itself ? 
  because nintendo ca n't into lowering prices, 
  [ i 've seen an anime about this once , except they called them `` angels '' ( because of course they did ) . 
  ] ( http://myanimelist.net/anime/155/x/1999 ), 
  they can just claim someone was `` moving their hand towards the belt '' , or did any number of things that do n't leave a sign . 
  with the naked hyperventilating woman they claimed she bit one of them . 
  her panicking 12 year old daughter also assaulted the police when she kicked in a window on the police car and some of the shards hit those poor , sensitive policemen ( who were still struggling to abduct the wrong people ) . 
  i think it 's because your body has a certain flavour-calorie association . 
  if you eat a pizza , your body expects a certain amount of energy from consuming it , which it 's familiar with . 
  if it gives you fewer calories than it expects , you 'll get hungry again very soon ( this is part of the reason why diet coke is a bad idea on diets ) . 
  when you eat unfamiliar food , your body does n't `` expect '' an abundance of calories , so it sets its calorie expectation lower . 
  you can try this with any foreign food - i can easily eat a pizza , but i have trouble eating a full portion of chinese food . 
  i probably did n't explain it very well , there 's a lot more information [ here ] ( http://lesswrong.com/lw/a6/the_unfinished_mystery_of_the_shangrila_diet/ ) , and in the comments . 
  who does n't ? 
  [ even yahtzee liked it ] ( http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/9549-shovel-knight-good-nes-nostalgia ) , and he 's notorious for hating everything . 
  i ca n't wait for an emulator / something that cracks the region lock / a flashcart that works on new firmware , rf4 sounds incredible . 
  also , flat bobby pins ( those without a bumpy side ) have better grip in straight hair !, 
  opera used to do this natively , you could use content block to individually block any kind of intrusive ad or image . 
  i wonder why they removed it from the recent versions . 
  you may be able to tether it to your phone . 
  just be careful , if you have a bad data plan it 's not really worth it . 
  alternatively , you could try tethering it to the college wireless system through your phone . 
  or just localize the japanese imagine , that would be so cool . 
  and i totally agree , i 'd love devil survivor 3 . 
  even beyond that , i 'd be super excited if it got the persona treatment with ds4 , ds : dancing with demons , devil survivor q , devil survivor arena etc. 
  now i wonder why the psn emulator does n't support something like 4x native resolution . 
  not true .
