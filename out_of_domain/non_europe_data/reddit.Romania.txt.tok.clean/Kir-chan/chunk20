  well , mostly - the only country that locks out foreign credit card is the us store . 
  i can use my romanian visa just fine in germany , england and canada . 
  ... though i 'm not 100 % certain about the au shop . 
  i have no experience with those . 
  you 'll have to try . 
  at worst it wo n't work . 
  p4 -  nocturne -  devil survivor, 
  p4 is an almost ideal place to start the series . 
  you learn the names of the abilities and the importance of buffs . 
  devil survivor , on the other hand , is by far the worst place to pick up the series . 
  the game assumes you already know ( or can guess ) what all of the various abilities do - you learn skills by stealing them from your opponents , but you have to choose which skills to crack at the beginning of the fight ( with no explanation provided ) . 
  this game can be very fun or balls-busting hard , depending on how you play it . 
  oh riiiiight , that 's what i did . 
  deleting my posts . 
   unless you 're a good voice actor , please do n't try to act out scenes that the audience can easily read . 
  this , so many times . 
  but rroma are n't considered white , and they 've been in europe for ages . 
  i tried the phil cup , but said `` fuck it '' when it turned out to have 10 rounds , with pieces of the guard armor . 
  is level 24 low for agrabah ? 
  ... and i have to do the gummi ship minigame thing again to get back there . 
  that always takes several tries . 
  shield/sword ( discarded wand ), 
  and that 's great , about the gummi ships - thanks !, 
  i wanted to pick sword at first , but then i remembered that shield learns a lot of useful skills faster . 
  like scan ( fighting without it is strange ) . 
  doing that . 
  i got through agrabah in the end ... 
  ... then proceeded to spend two hours trying to figure out how to reach monstro ( answer : that warp thing * can be avoided * ) . 
  how did i even get though this game the last time without a guide . 
  to be honest , what annoys me the most is that there are a million `` how do you expect me to know that ! '', 
  moments : like hitting the column in the cave of wonders with fire , actually * avoiding * the warp thing with the gummi ship , that you do n't have to swing your way along the vines if you cross the hippo lake ( oh god how much time i wasted swinging back and forth ) , that entering the bizarre room from * that * exit makes it flip ... 
  ... although i 'm glad i 'm not having trouble with the platforming and the in-game camera . 
  i spent 13 hours on it , it 's a really well-made demo . 
  so , uh , what 's a steelbook ? 
  persona and dds are just the standard recommended first games . 
  another reason for p4 is that it 's not very difficult and can get very boring if you 're expecting a smt experience . 
  i still stand by what i recommend , p4 -  nocturne -  desu . 
  desu itself is a lot easier than nocturne , or even p3 : fes . 
  persona 4 is even easier . 
  nah , they tried that in europe but failed . 
  celebrities torture pregnant women in concentration camps ? 
  whoever downvoted you should read `` nothing to envy '' . 
  dick cheney can go shove a rifle up his ass . 
  it has n't been much of a talking point , since the draft has been a moot point anyway for years . 
  i remember hearing a lot more about it on tv as a child in the 90s . 
  still , if anecdotes are accepted , i 've never spoken to a feminist who thinks only men should be drafted . 
  to * women * who think that , yes - but those women usually also held many other outdated ideas . 
  i thought = / = meant something like `` either or '' . 
  so it stands for an ' = ' with a slash through ? 
  why not just use ! = it 's much clearer . 
  * cough * you can also play the final mix on the pc , on an emulator , because it has a translation patch . 
  i played that instead of the regular version , what feels like a million years ago . 
  ... and , you guys , if you did n't do this , you 're * in for such a treat * . 
  the ~ ~ cave of wonders ~ ~ cavern of remembrance and the roxas battle in twtnw were absolutely fantastic and my favorite parts of khii . 
  edit : nevermind , i read that wrong . 
  but i think bbsfm also has a translation patch . 
  buy 1.5 and 2.5 and play the translation patches ? 
  this is what i 'm doing , because i ca n't afford a ps3 . 
  kh1 and 2 look fantastic in hd on the emulator . 
  pssst , you ca n't abort babies . 
  nu prea mai are relevanta . 
   last year , 62 percent of the pcs in romania ran illegal software ,, 
  8 % as intelege . 
  i mean , the translation patches for the final mixes . 
  it 's not the remastered version , but the visuals are really beautiful in hd all the same . 
  does this mean i 'll finally have an excuse too buy a us 3ds ? 
  awesome !, 
  yep . 
  i 'm also looking forward upgrade my xl to a us new 3ds , now that it has better battery and a slightly larger screen . 
  this is amazing . 
   how would they even port such a huge game on the 3ds without killing the frame rate , loading screens everywhere , ~ ~ or ~ ~ and sacrificing the visuals . 
  you nailed it . 
  at least , according to the video in the direct . 
  la asta ma refeream , ca nationalitate clar ca-i roman . 
  [ best ] ( http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/asia-pacific/pleasure-squad-defector-sheds-light-on-life-of-kim-jong-il ) [ korea ] ( https://redditjs.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2et9k8/til_north_korea_enlists_around_2000_women_as_part/ ) [ is already ahead of you !, 
  but we 've heard that smt x fe is being worked on , and the persona 5 announcement was n't that long ago . 
  meanwhile , the [ official website ] ( http://ds2-p.atlusnet.jp ) for break record still says, 
     what 's new _ 2013.4.25, 
  i 'm hoping this means developers can port more games to the 3ds , and wo n't feel forced to release on the vita because the 3ds 's cpu ca n't handle it . 
  yeah , i assume the games they 'll put on the new 3ds will be games that could n't run on the old one anyway , so not ` intentional ' exclusives the way bayonetta 2 is exclusive to the wii u. 
  just wait and see . 
  you still have over 4 months until the earliest possible release date in the west . 
  i 'm expecting a serious price cut for the current models around christmas . 
  the current 3ds versions are still amazing consoles , even with a new version on the horizon . 
  or down . 
  you do n't realise how important the background music is in helping you concentrate until you accidentally keep turning it off during difficult boss fights . 
  or maybe they 'll be playable , but with horrible framerates and lag . 
  it 's * very * slightly bigger , but also lighter . 
  the small 3ds is also bigger , which is great !, 
  definitely getting it . 
  no return policy ? 
  make sure to respond to everything they say with `` no , actually ... '' !, 
  but jesus wants you to go to heaven !, 
  well , they 're building on their existing userbase . 
  it makes sense . 
  i 'd much rather buy a better 3ds than a wii u ( mostly because i do n't have a tv ) . 
  you can gift the old one , sell it , or keep it because it 's a different region , or keep it for homepass or multiplayer . 
  this upgrade seems more like kindle vs kindle paperwhite . 
  both !, 
  i 'll keep mine to play the games i already own and buy the us version of the new 3ds so i can stop complaining about the region lock .
