  i 'll probably buy the small version , not the ll though . 
  because you want to play the games on it ? 
  debatable . 
  virtue 's last reward looked better on the 3ds with 3d on . 
  conception looked significantly worse . 
  why is this even legislated ? 
  as long as it 's consensual , it 's none of the government 's business who they fuck . 
  i ca n't decide whether i hated riku 's final boss or riku 's stupid overpowered shield . 
  i ended up just spamming shield throughout the entire fight . 
  358 days managed somehow . 
  the riku fight was pretty awesome . 
  not in a single generation it does n't . 
  and since when does the government care about the genepool ? 
  edit : not a single -  not in a single, 
  the bible is * full * of incest . 
  [ first cousins add a whopping 3 % chance of birth defects . ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/03/health/03cnd-cous.html ) . 
  the same study says siblings add a bit less than 10 % . 
  if the government wants to `` better '' the genepool , they 'll have more luck banning people with inheritable diseases from procreating . 
  but that 's not ethical , right ? 
  i * really * do n't care who are what people sleep with , i just do n't want the government in people 's sex lives . 
  huh , now that i think about it , eve * does * count as adam 's daughter , since she was made from his genetic material . 
  til ? 
  358 days had overall pretty awesome combat . 
  it played even better on the 3ds , because the circle pad made your movements very fluid and precise . 
  ... except ruler of the sky . 
  fuck ruler of the sky . 
  and infernal engine . 
  i did n't even do that much . 
  i do n't remember the details , but i pretty much let the boss kill himself on riku 's shield . 
  those are the obvious choices , yes , but the bible actually has * explicit * mentions of incest , not just implied . 
  and in cain 's case ... that 's a little more complicated , and an interesting story if you read genesis . 
  the answer , imho , is not incest and is on the very first page of the book : there were several primordial gods ( the bible uses a plural here and uses a different word to refer to god some paragraphs later ) and they created `` humanity '' in their image , both `` male and female '' . 
  yes , this was my hobby in highschool . 
  do n't ask . 
  still , it 's an interesting twist on the usual story you hear . 
  it 's possible , since she 's supposed to be the princess of radiant garden . 
  it 'd be an interesting twist . 
  kairi has a keyblade because aqua more or less accidentally performed the inheritance ceremony on her . 
  eh , did n't mind him . 
  leechgrave always did me a favor and spit me out ready to limit break , after killing one last tentacle . 
  and the tentacles were nicely vulnerable to fire . 
   secret ansem 's report 9 :, 
  did n't xehanort write that though ? 
  edit : nevermind , that 's the regular ansem reports . 
  that xenoblade looked pretty terrible though . 
  probably not , nintendo said that the performance of the games that are already released wo n't be improved . 
  although ... well , we wo n't know until it 's out . 
  wait a few months and buy a `` new '' 3ds . 
  alt answer : the best you can do is take out the sd card and connect that to your computer , although i 'm not sure whether transferring files works . 
  i mean , in the direct . 
  although chances are they 'll improve the visuals until release . 
  or it may be education . 
  at least in my case , practically all my female relatives tried to ` teach me ' how to write neatly . 
  around highschool i started imitating my mother 's handwriting . 
  my sister never grew out of chicken scrawl though . 
  amusingly , she 's also starting med school . 
  a new smt or kingdom hearts game being announced on it , same as what convinced me to buy the regular 3ds . 
  though i 'll be buying it anyway , just to get out of the eu region . 
  we did have education in cursive writing , and i write cursive . 
  but cursive = illegible half the time . 
  i 'm sure women are better at it , i just do n't know how much of that is environmental . 
  i remember my teachers saying things like `` you write like a boy '' / `` i expect better handwriting from you miss ( while ignoring the guys ) . 
  interestingly , i also remember the teachers being stricter with the boys when it came to math and sciences in general . 
  danganronpa is pretty good . 
  not enough to make me buy it , but enough to consider it as a distant possibility . 
   it 's not worth buying a system over, 
  yeah , and this is the huge problem the vita has . 
  it 's nice , but i 've already played it on the ps2 . 
  the new content is n't worth buying a system over, 
   danganronpa, 
  it 's nice , especially the second one , but it 's * really * not worth buying a system for . 
   atelier, 
  they look nice , but not worth buying a system for . 
   vlr , conception, 
  are also on the 3ds , so not worth buying a new system for . 
   tales of innocence / hearts, 
  maybe , but neither are even out yet . 
  no , it 's the games that decimated the vita . 
  the 3ds managed to pull in * three * very large markets :, 
  - the casuals and children , because of what you mentioned, 
  - the adult nostalgia gamers , who are a very loyal fanbase , with long-established titles like mario , pokemon , zelda, 
  - the jrpg fanbase , because atlus and square enix released some fantastic games on the console, 
  the jrpg fanbase should have been the vita 's , but somehow they * failed * to localize key tales and atelier titles until people lost interest or moved to the games that were actually getting released . 
  bravely thirdly on new 3ds confirmed ? 
  ] ( http://www.nature.com/news/ancient-european-genomes-reveal-jumbled-ancestry-1.14456 ), 
  same . 
  i bought this [ thing ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/butterfox-deluxe-accessory-travel-console/dp/b008pcdjsa/ref=sr_1_15?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1409438687&amp;sr=8-15&amp;keywords=3ds+case ) along with my 3ds and it 's super convenient because it includes anything i might need . 
  the op just wrote `` nintendo '' in katakana . 
  to use an example in one of the other posts , it 's like calling your console :, 
   standard 3dss are called ` nintendo 3ds ' and ` nintendo ds xl ' , new 3dss are called ` nintendo 3ds nuevo ' and ` nintendo 3ds nuevo xl ' . 
  that 's what it looks like to someone who does n't speak english . 
  i just want to know what 's the deal with cloud and sephiroth in the kh universe . 
  ... and maybe have the twewy characters reappear . 
  joshua at least would be awesome . 
  `` yeah , i * totally * conspired with my children to kill my husband and feed him to the pigs . 
  are you serious ? '', 
  `` thank you for your confession ma'am . '', 
  um , that 's exactly the sort of crimes gypsies commit . 
  at least in romania . 
  this and 3ds advance are my favorites .
