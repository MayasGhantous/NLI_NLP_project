  they can . 
  bacon is just thin slices of various cuts . 
  examples : [ here ] ( http://www.aflacum.ro/images/photo_galleries/large/1208/afla-cum-se-prepara-sunca-de-casa-afumata-1.jpg ) , [ here ] ( http://www.combis.ro/image/view/img/276/mode/fit/w/485/h/300/image/_ch13754.jpg ) , [ here ] ( http://delabogdana.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/img_3567.jpg ) , [ here ] ( http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz272/ouapaste/sunca1.jpg ) . 
  they do n't sell huge hunks of it because - i 'm not sure actually , but i imagine it 's because they can squeeze a * lot * more profit out of it if they sell it in near-transparent slices . 
  only the first one is cooked , the other three are just smoked ( afaik ) . 
  now i 'm not sure what you mean by bacon . 
  [ these ] ( http://www.donaldrussell.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/s/t/streaky-bacon-10_1.jpg ) are just slices akin to the first image , except from a different cut . 
  here at least they sell them in [ whole chunks ] ( http://static.flickr.com/31/45265373_42fbee3ad5.jpg?v=0 ) as well : or do you mean fried bacon ? 
  ( none of the pictures are mine ), 
  what games do you have ? 
  it 's not yet possible in newer firmware . 
  the exploit the flash carts use does n't exist in newer versions . 
  but gba temp has some helpful instructions for finding an old 3ds . 
  ... you really need a couple of new games . 
  resident evil and monster hunter are on sale right now , the second can give you hundreds of hours of content ( according to many people here ) . 
  you should also look into animal crossing , it seems exactly the sort of thing you are looking for - a light , relaxing game with a huge amount of stuff to do that can last you months . 
  i 'd love another hand-held spin-off ( developed after kh3 ) where she 's the main character . 
  summer , definitely . 
  i found this list of locations for romania , and it 's pretty good :, 
  my own tip is to avoid castle bran ( dracula 's castle ) , because it 's not worth the visit . 
  go to castle peles instead :, 
  http://www.girlabouttheglobe.com/blog/bran-castle scroll down for pictures from peles . 
  brasov is n't that great either . 
  your time would be better spent in sighisoara , sibiu and cluj - sighisoara usually has a medieval festival in july , which i very much recommend visiting . 
  link : http://www.sighisoaramedievala.ro/indexen.html, 
  i just remembered , there 's a ton of free demos on the eshop . 
  play those and maybe you 'll even find a game you like . 
  try at least : fire emblem awakening , etrian odyssey , monster hunter and bravely default . 
  download whatever catches your eye . 
  there 's also a lot of low-price eshop games you could go for , like steamworld dig , shovel knight , attack of the friday monsters , liberation maiden , picross , so on . 
  not all of us . 
  it has a jrpg fanbase , but it should have been significantly bigger considering it 's the successor of the psp . 
  not that guy , but not having russian troops there would be a start . 
  the next step would of course be recognition as an independent state from the international community . 
  you do n't spend a lot of time on reddit do you . 
  to be fair , our standardized math tests * are * pretty though , because we 're teaching college-level math to highschoolers . 
  the math we studied in the first year of college . 
  eshop is fine , do it already !, 
  ... the 3ds has a drought of games ? 
  i want another fire emblem . 
  does that count ? 
  edit : nevermind lol, 
  wtf, 
  nu-i diferenta mare , dar [ aici ] ( http://www.365games.co.uk/3ds-games/super-smash-bros-game-3ds ) e 180 lei . 
  nu-s retro gamer , dar am un prieten care e. 
  cea mai buna investitie ever . 
  hey , aveam si [ tamagotchi ] ( http://bbcontact.info/tamagotchi_yellow_orange_number_new_box/tamagotchi_yellow_orange_number_new_box_01.jpg ) . 
  eu il tin in geanta . 
  and we 're also waiting for fantasy life , smash bros , curtain call , persona q , smtiv and the new pokemon this year . 
  two of those are only eu , but it 's still a good list . 
   `` hello kitty is not a cat . 
  she 's a cartoon character . 
  she is a little girl . 
  she is a friend . 
  but she is not a cat . 
  she 's never depicted on all fours . 
  she walks and sits like a two-legged creature . '', 
  til hello kitty is a furry ? 
  in europe accents are regional , not cultural or related to skin pigments or whatever is determining this . 
  if you have an austrian accent , it 's because you ( or your family ) is from austria . 
  if you have a north german accent , it 's because you 're from north germany . 
  what the op is asking , and i 'm wondering too , is why black people in ( for example ) new york speak so differently than white people in new york ? 
  it 's the same place . 
  ~ 10 % between siblings . 
  something like 3 % between first cousins . 
  more elaborate answer here : http://genetics.thetech.org/ask/ask65, 
  you can only transfer command skills . 
  and yes , that 's how you do it . 
  it 'll be faster on the second playthrough , but still rare . 
  a toaster is powerful enough to play the game at this point . 
  ( i also prefer japanese voices . ), 
  the ps4 is expecting kh3 , ffxv and p5 now . 
  if those are n't console sellers , i do n't know what are . 
  it is , but you ca n't play it :(, 
  [ are you sure ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/who_is_a_jew%3f ), 
   if one of the parents is not jewish , the rule is that the child takes the status of the mother ( kiddushin 66b , shulchan aruch , eh 4:19 ) . 
  [ 8 ] the ruling is derived from various sources including deuteronomy 7:1 -- 5 , leviticus 24:10 , ezra 10:2 -- 3 . 
  [ 8 ] accordingly , if the mother is jewish , so is her child , and if she is not jewish , neither is her child considered jewish . 
  leviticus says a lot of stuff though :, 
  leviticus 17:13 : that is why i have said to the israelites , `` you must not eat the blood of any creature , because the life of every creature is its blood ; anyone who eats it must be cut off . '', 
  19:23 ``` when you enter the land and plant any kind of fruit tree , regard its fruit as forbidden . 
  [ b ] for three years you are to consider it forbidden [ c ] ; it must not be eaten . 
  27 ``` do not cut the hair at the sides of your head or clip off the edges of your beard . 
  28 ``` do not cut your bodies for the dead or put tattoo marks on yourselves . 
  10 ``` if a man commits adultery with another man 's wife -- with the wife of his neighbor -- both the adulterer and the adulteress are to be put to death . 
  etc, 
  what did i just watch, 
  [ spoiler ] ( / s `` my poor sides when babybabybaby started '' ), 
  not every non-wbc christian shares your opinion either , as much as i wish they did . 
  digital devil saga ( 1 & 2 ) or persona fes , both are good games to get you into the series . 
  after you finish either , nocturne . 
  i hope so too ; _ ;, 
  i thought if i posted it someone from atlus will either confirm it or edit the page . 
   regionlock me to the depths of amala if this turns out to be an error, 
  ^ and ^ me ^ too ^ for ^ posting ^ this . 
  it 's still competing with fantasy life and curtain call . 
  august would have been best , or even earlier . 
  so you did n't play any of the amala labyrinth ? 
  i guess you can always replay nocturne in a year or so .
