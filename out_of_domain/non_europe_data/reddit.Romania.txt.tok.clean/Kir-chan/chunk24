  you do realise i 'm a stranger and all you know about me is that i earn an average wage in a country with notoriously low wages , right ? 
  as a side-note , i hope you do n't also complain about immigrants stealing your jobs . 
  i 'm actually complaining about how the reasoning of `` economic standards '' does n't work . 
  it 's the equivalent of pricing things according to new york or san francisco standards for the entire us . 
  my low wage is my own problem , but do n't invoke this argument to defend nintendo 's anti-consumer practices . 
   in poland theres actually population of hard-working and assimilated roma people - but theyre mostly polish for centuries . 
  these exist in romania as well , although you would n't recognise them because they 're indistinguishable from the native population . 
  for example , i had a physics teacher who was absolutely fantastic , hard working and a good man . 
  we live in the same apartment building and he 's always been a great neighbour as well . 
  i would have never guessed he was a gypsy until his relatives came to visit one day . 
  i do n't think his situation is that rare either . 
  on the other hand , we also have plenty of poverty stricken romanians who assimilate into gypsy culture . 
  nice . 
  huh . 
  personal , ma sperie cat de multi tineri avem in firma . 
  imi aminteste cam mult de [ asta ] ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b003v4asv8 ) si [ asta ] ( http://www.amazon.com/escape-camp-14-remarkable-odyssey-ebook/dp/b005gszz1a/ref=sr_1_1_ha?s=digital-text&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1409943527&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=escape+from+camp+14 ) ... 
  it may be a niche title , but all they had to do was advertise it as the `` the first fantasy mmo on the 3ds '' . 
  lol, 
  slightly different than what you asked for , [ but posting the lyrics of a song is illegal . 
  ] ( http://www.avclub.com/article/lyrics-website-owes-music-publishers-66-million-be-86629 ), 
  vigilantism is illegal regardless of whether you 're the majority though . 
  idk , banning them from mosques ? 
  public ridicule ? 
  shaming ? 
  isis is still an egyptian goddess , y' know . 
  although it 's probably mighty awkward for modern pagan isis-worshippers . 
  is it ? 
  the only thing in that list that would take extra effort would be to assign a female religious prison official . 
  the ds games - particularly days - are pretty awesome though . 
  funny , minimum wage in most of europe is * very * low . 
  uh , there is no european standard minimum wage . 
  where i live minimum wage is around 1 euro per hour ( before taxes ) . 
  of course it 's smaller . 
  nobody can afford the insane prices games go for . 
  consider it like this :, 
  the average monthly salary in romania is $ 534/month . 
  the average salary in the us is $ 3,769 / month . 
  someone in here paying $ 35 for a game is like someone in the us paying $ 245 . 
  35 pounds is 56 dollars and `` average '' . 
  that 's like someone in the us paying $ 392 dollars . 
  the limited edition from nis is even worse . 
  and people wonder why piracy is so high here . 
  thanks for taking so many of them off our hands , spain . 
  the streets have been so much safer here since . 
  most people here do n't care that much about international events . 
  it 's a remnant of communist mentality , back when international events did n't even exist for all intents and purposes ... 
  there is some tension among people who follow current events , but there 's not that many of us . 
  break record break record break record, 
  please, 
  huh , i actually prefer handhelds for gaming , even at home . 
  i noticed that i never 100 % and rarely finish games on large screens , but on the 3ds i almost always do , in large part because i can play in bed , on the toilet , on the couch , in the bathtub etc. 
  can i have a code ? 
  curtain call ( now ) -  smtiv -  persona q, 
  this is my order of priorities . 
  i still need to buy bravely default sometime too . 
  i 'm not planning to buy fantasy life yet , because i have my hands full with the animal crossing i bought during the eshop discount . 
  i 'm not planning to buy ssb4 yet because i ca n't afford to replace my 3ds and i 've heard that people keep breaking their slidepads . 
  maybe once the new 3ds comes out . 
  i 'm not planning to buy pokemon oras yet because smtiv will scratch that itch just fine . 
  why do all these games have to come out at the same time ... 
  the expert score is too hard for me , and not fun to play at all . 
  rythm games are also skill-based y' know and some people suck at them . 
  another argument for me to try and get my hands on a us new 3ds once it comes out < 3 ilu atlus i knew you did n't cancel the game . 
  seconded . 
  not having makatora on daisoujou breaks the game less . 
  4chan smt fans are n't that bad . 
  `` slightly less easy but still nowhere near challenging enough '' * is * `` infuriatingly hard/borderline impossible '' for people not good to rhythm games . 
  since this game is marketed at final fantasy fans , it 's just as well . 
  does he also drop $ 1000 when you say his name next to him ? 
   sint un roman care am plecat din romania de 20 + ani . 
  mind explaining then ? 
  i do n't know what it is either ... and the aircraft explanation is unhelpful . 
  in cet that would be ... 1-3 am ? 
  with one hand tied behind his back !, 
  buy curtain call if you care about limited editions . 
  otherwise , it 's probably better to go for the animal crossing sale , who knows whether they 'll ever have one again ? 
   like 4 or 5 hours, 
  sounds like it 's about the same length as the other level 5 games on the eshop . 
  so you can accidentally pull them out and rock the bus with kapp 'n' s singing ? 
   shinji and warhammer 40k, 
  i could n't even get through the first 10 chapters . 
  shinji was way too op , with none of the issues that made him interesting . 
  i ca n't get any of those jobs either , as an unattractive woman . 
  how do i download dlc in curtain call ? 
  i want to grab the free dlc while it 's available , but i ca n't find the option . 
  thank you !, 
  both have demos on the eshop , you can pick whichever you like better . 
  i used to change clippy to that cat you could also pick . 
  it had some cute animations and i used to love it . 
  then again , i was 8 . 
  i 'm not sure those are worth # 2 apiece . 
  i hope they convert the price properly . 
  the faceplates are n't region-locked , you can probably buy them off play-asia or something . 
  especially kingdom hearts , also the kh ds games . 
  they play a lot better on the 3ds with the slidepad . 
  staff is a pretty bad choice for proud mode imho . 
  you get second chance * really * late and most bosses - hell , many random mobs - can easily one-shot you . 
  shield nets you leaf bracer and second chance pretty early though . 
  the second weapon ( the one you do n't drop ) only counts for stats , i think . 
   mammy,
