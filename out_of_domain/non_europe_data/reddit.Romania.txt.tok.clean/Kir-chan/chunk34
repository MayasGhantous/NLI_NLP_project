  all of the 8th days are hard as balls . 
  there are very few virtual console games . 
  i did n't manage to get cubic ninja , but i wanted it for non-vc games and various fan-translations . 
  not everyone wants to pirate mario and zelda games . 
  actually , yes , i 'd buy it . 
  i was a pirate-only gamer for the longest time while i barely had money for food as a student , and now i 'm in the slow process of buying the games i 've played back then ( although i prefer going for new games , since i figure developers care about that more ) . 
  luckily i was n't much of a gamer , so my back-catalogue is small . 
  i was just thinking about this today . 
  i bought and played it last month , all month until two days ago , over 100 hours and i 've only done one route . 
  the game is * amazing * . 
  gorgeous graphics , breath-taking atmosphere - by the end i was using google earth to wander around real tokyo to find the landmarks in the game . 
  the only thing i could possibly complain about is that the battles are very unbalanced . 
  while the difficulty and frequency of the random mobs are good ( something 20 levels below you can kill you if you 're not paying attention ) , the actual bosses are almost trivially easy . 
  although , this did help in that there was never a point where i had to put the game down and rage for a few hours . 
  * devil survivor overclocked, 
  the characters , the plot , the dialogue , the battle system - devil survivor has all of these down perfectly . 
  the voice acting started out shaky , but even that grew really , really good as the actors got used to the roles ( this gets really obvious on the second playthrough , hearing the early dialogue again ) . 
  i also loved how much freedom the game gave you and how you could screw everything up by just avoiding responsibility and trying to run away . 
  my second playthrough was a yuzu run , and i even managed to skip one of the mandatory bel fights haha . 
  i spent over 100 hours on a single playthrough trying to max ~ ~ all ~ ~ most of the supports . 
  i put it down after i got desu overclocked , but i really want to return to it sometime . 
  * kingdom hearts : dream drop distance, 
  this is actually the reason i bought my 3ds . 
  i 'm a huge kingdom hearts fan and i loved this game , even the parts people usually complain about : raising dream eaters , drops and the confusing plot . 
  playing as riku was a lot more fun than i expected it to be . 
  * final fantasy theaterrhythm curtain call, 
  i never expected to like a rhythm game . 
  i never expected to fall in love with a game i 'm terrible at . 
  virtue 's last reward and animal crossing nl follow , and that 's about all the retail games i 've played , not counting the 13 hours i 've spent in bravely default 's demo ( but i never get around to getting it because there 's always new games coming out d : ) . 
  my favourite eshop games are attack of the friday monsters and witch & hero . 
  my favourite ds games are the world ends with you , the two kingdom hearts games , devil survivor 2 and 999 . 
   ( pope ? ), 
  anges 100mm height, 
  hope they do n't include it for the eu special edition this time . 
  the last one cost over 100 pounds . 
   `` we did things that we tried japanese soldiers for war crimes for after world war two . '', 
  well , at least they admit it . 
  also ,, 
   neither psychologist had any experience as an interrogator , nor did either have specialized knowledge of al-qa ` ida , a background in counterterrorism , or any relevant cultural or linguistic expertise . 
  you know what should happen ? 
  those senior agency officials should be handed over to isis tied up in a bow and with a copy of this report attached . 
  this level of cruelty is something you expect of ** fucking nazi germany ** , not a modern america . 
  page 112, 
   on march 5 , 2003 , ksm was also subjected to additional rectal rehydration , which [ censored ] oms , [ censored ] , described as helping to `` clear a person 's head '', 
  i found something closer , on page 130 of the pdf, 
   in the first half of 2003 , the cia interrogated four detainees with, 
  medical complications in their lower extremities : ** two detainees had a broken foot ** , one detainee had a sprained ankle , and one detainee had a prosthetic leg . 
  cia interrogators ** shackled each of these detainees in the standing position ** for sleep deprivation for extended periods of time until medical personnel assessed that they could not maintain the position . 
  the two detainees that each had a broken foot were also subjected to walling , stress positions , and cramped confinement , despite the note in their interrogation plans that these specific enhanced interrogation techniques were not requested because of the medical condition of the detainees . 
  edit : there 's another incidence of this on page 142 , two detainees broke a foot each trying to escape and they were deemed `` sufficiently healed to allow being placed in the standing sleep deprivation position '' about 3 months early . 
  edit 2 : `` rectal feeding '' is on page 143 , if anyone is curious . 
  afterwards , the cia headquarters expressed concern over the `` continued state of depression and uncooperative attitude '' of the man they subjected to this . 
  well , no shit . 
  ... actually , `` no shit '' is n't a mental image i want in this case ... 
  the cia lied to the white house . 
  how is that a grey area ? 
  well , of course they are . 
  there 's no `` eventually '' about it , there 's no way sociopaths this degree of unqualified would get the job otherwise . 
  i 'm much more interested in * who * they are . 
  fanfic has the advantage that they 're generally very light reads . 
  you know the source , you know the characters , now enjoy the fanservice . 
  this lets you read a lot of them really quickly , making it somewhat easier to stumble upon the truly great ones . 
  over time you build up mental filters and can guess whether a story is worth reading from the summary + first chapter . 
  you ca n't do this with published novels . 
  those take longer to get into the meat of the story and they have to spend time building up some characterization as well . 
  a lot of the time they 're also crap , and crap you paid money for to boot . 
  this one 's longer though . 
  unless you add the `` published '' qualifier , which is sorta so-so these days . 
  worm is n't published either ( afaik ? ), 
  i have 6 fanfics over 600k words on my favourites list over on fanfiction.net . 
  they 're all very well written :, 
  * [ prince of the dark kingdom ] ( https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/prince-of-the-dark-kingdom ) - 1.2 million words , harry potter , voldemort won au . 
  * [ three thieves ] ( https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5447851/1/three-thieves ) - 840k , detective conan, 
  * [ twist of fate ] ( https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5925524/1/twist-of-fate ) , 720k , harry potter , wwii-era , harry grows up with tom riddle . 
  this one has amazing writing and had some very rigorous research put into it for that time period . 
  this author has another earlier , very good story that clocks in at 1.6 million words , but the writing quality starts out terrible and it 's heavy in slash . 
  * [ dauntless ] ( https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6175861/1/dauntless ) , 664k , code geass au where lelouch returns to the imperial family before the events of the anime . 
  it 's heavy in plot and politics . 
  * [ their verdict of vagaries ] ( https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5356546/1/their-verdict-of-vagaries ) , 635k , it 's very well written but it 's also a time-travel slash story that 's not exactly reddit material . 
  * [ the sky and the dawn and the sun ] ( https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4463327/1/the-sky-and-the-dawn-and-the-sun ) , 602k , an origin story for aeris , cloud and zack in kingdom hearts written before bbs, 
  edit : major , well-regarded , edited * pony * fics * oh * nevermind then, 
  it 's been listed on the eshop for a few days next to rune factory 4 , so probably , yeah . 
  * looks at smtiv waiting for a second playthrough *, 
  * looks at persona q not even a quarter of the way through the game *, 
  * looks at curtain call that 's still full of songs i have n't played *, 
  i 'll . . give this a pass for now . 
  why do the games all have to come out at the same time ? 
  just a warning , the author is intending for it to become slash at some point and there 's been some developments in that direction . 
  but it takes half a million words to even get to the part where she * starts * building something up , and the rest of the story is well worth a read . 
  especially once you get to the norway part * shudder * ( it gave me nightmares for weeks , she 's an amazing author ) . 
  according to the report , the cia obtained the terrorist information it was boasting about mostly from ` just asking ' them ( well , from much milder interrogations anyway ) , and then lying about the way they extracted it . 
  ( edit : typo ), 
  the mornings when 5 minutes feel like an eternity are always glorious . 
  not to mention , not everyone 's sleep cycle is the same length . 
  mine is 75 minutes rather than the 90 they calculate there . 
  the odds are n't * that * bad actually . 
  theatrhythm should be fairly easy and therefore cheap to localize compared to actual dragon quest . 
  releasing it in the west might also help gauge actual interest for dq7 itself . 
  i predict we will get it . 
  if we do , i will buy it even though i 've never played a single dragon quest game and i 'm not familiar with any of the games .
