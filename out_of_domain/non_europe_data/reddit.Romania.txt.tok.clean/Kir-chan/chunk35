  i hope everyone else who signed the petition for dq7 will do so as well . 
  the world ends with you is not a music / rhythm game . 
   it was n't bad , but it was worse than p4a . 
  i disagree . 
  i * strongly * disagree . 
  i wish a-1 would have adapted p4 from the start , they would have surely done a better job than the trainwreck that was p4a . 
  also , the animation was good . 
  p4a had animators walk out on the project because the studio was n't paying them . 
  the animation was n't just terrible , it looked like its staff was actively sabotaging it ( the legendary screenshot with two chie ) . 
   we should n't have to pay this much in the first place . 
  welcome to eu pricing . 
  enjoy your stay . 
  i thought overclocked 's dub started out pretty awful , but somewhere during the game it became truly excellent . 
  i still wish they could include jp voices . 
  why are there licensing issues for using these characters if the original creators ok 'd it ? 
  : / i hope we 'll keep them for europe at least . 
  speaking of , i wonder how that will turn out . 
  i see what you did there . 
  `` record breaker '' does n't roll off the tongue quite like `` break record '' . 
  wish they kept the original title . 
  there can be a first for everything . 
  the original reason for not including jp voices was the fear of reverse importing of the much cheaper us copy , which is somewhat moot now due to the combination of region locking * and * more equal pricing . 
  am i grasping straws ? 
  i want dual audio so baaad ... 
  ( edit : typos ), 
   it was n't bad , but it was worse than p4a . 
  yes , but that 's just your opinion . 
  i strongly prefer japanese voice acting . 
  i cringe every time i hear english vas pronounce-mangle japanese names and place names , and it destroys my suspension of disbelief when the characters ca n't even pronounce their own names . 
  i always sought out undubs on the hackable systems , but that 's not possible on the 3ds unless i buy the gateway ( although i was strongly tempted for pq ) . 
  edit : on the other hand , i 'd also take a german dub over an english one . 
  actually , a german dub would be amazing . 
  yes , and we 're apparently not getting them . 
  i love durarara and the second season is airing soon , this is just about the worst news i could get for ~ ~ break record ~ ~ record breaker , pretty much on par with `` estimated 2016 release for eu '' ... 
  [ that estimate is straight from my ass , we do n't have any news yet ], 
  idk about others , but i 'd complain less about them if they actually coached the vas to * pronounce the names of the characters they are playing * . 
  that 's how much the first devil survivor costs on amazon right now . 
  yep . 
  the complaining in this thread is making me feel weirdly satisfied . 
  we do get them , we just ca n't use them unless we lie about where we live . 
  i registered mine on the german club nintendo . 
  bravely default is 3.23 gb with dual audio . 
  fire emblem awakening is 1.05 gb with dual audio . 
  overclocked is 1.13 gb, 
  smtiv is 1.81 gb, 
  i ca n't imagine break record being bigger than smtiv , nevermind reaching the size of bravely default . 
  i do n't think cartridge space is an issue ? 
  pretty much all of them ? 
  to be fair , some of the vas on the p3 side actually got it right . 
  the introductions still gave me a headache . 
  the worst one was `` mari '' , pronounced something like `` mouri '' or `` mawri '' instead of `` mari '' . 
  you have a point , but ... 
  nintendo is n't selling snes games on the 3ds . 
  that mention was for the wii u. 
  fuck you . 
  just ... fuck you . 
  it 's not minor at all . 
  maybe it is for you , if you 're a native speaker it fells ` natural ' to pronounce the names that way . 
  i find the way they pronounce yookeekou and chee-ay completely unnatural and forced . 
  i would n't complain about this if they coached the * professional * voice actors in pronounciation or included both tracks . 
  character names are important in games like persona . 
  i 'm not 100 % against dubs . 
  i enjoy the occasional german dub ( they still mispronounce some names , but not as badly ) , and i really do n't mind them in settings that are non-japanese . 
  ( also , `` mari '' is one of my favourite names ... ), 
  assuming the final game is the size of smtiv ( i * really * doubt that ) , another voice track * ca n't * be bigger than 2 gb if the first one fit under 1.8 gb . 
  so ... source ? 
   yes , the english dub of the game is done in a way that 's meant to sound palatable to native english speakers . 
  i 'm sorry , i 'm not a native english speaker . 
  * most * countries in europe are not native english speakers . 
  hell , the same goes for the na region . 
  we * still * get the same dub . 
  either make it palatable to everyone by making an effort to at least pronounce names correctly , or include * both * tracks . 
  `` well , the en dub is fine for native speakers '' is not a reason to * only * have the en dub . 
  edit :, 
   i do n't plan on complaining if something in a german dub does n't sound good to my english ears . 
  you would if you * only * got a german dub and no other option save for turning the audio off . 
  reading comprehension . 
  i * am * complaining that we do n't get the other dub track . 
  also , there are no dubs in my language . 
  nobody does or wants that , we watch and play everything subbed . 
  they had some attempts at introducing dubs a few years ago , and they were buried under complaints . 
  people are still angry that children 's cartoons are being dubbed rather than shown in english . 
  but this is beside the point , i guess . 
  devil survivor overclocked has 1.13 gb . 
  it 's smaller than smtiv and bravely default , the examples i used . 
  they 're `` leaders '' , so i assume they also have some dialogue that gets cut ... 
  that 's an article from 2011 from silicon era citing that atlus were worried the audio for * devil survivor overclocked * would n't fit on the cartridge . 
  for all we know , maybe they were joking `` haha , we have so many voices that maybe they wo n't even fit '' . 
  maybe cartridges were smaller back then ( doubtful ) . 
  we do n't have a context . 
  what we do know though is that the total , final size of devil survivor overclocked is 1.1 gb . 
  the biggest 3ds game is over 3 gb , so the statement that `` the audio almost did n't fit the cartridge '' is * not true * by a huge margin . 
  the entire game could have fit three times over . 
  they 're from the / r/3ds sub : [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/3ds/wiki/size_of_games ), 
  i have n't played it either ^ ( because i keep buying atlus games instead ) , but i do know that it 's dual audio . 
  i 'm not sure how much of it is voiced , but considering overclocked 's total size is 1.1 gb , the audio track ca n't be any bigger than that . 
  2.2 gb would fit on the cartridge no problem . 
  edit : i 'd pay for jp audio as dlc if size is any issue . 
  edit 2 : devil survivor for ds is 67mb , i just remembered i still have the rom on my computer . 
  the 8th days might push the size up to 100mb , but i think it 's safe to assume the audio was 1 gb .
