  not like the poor innocent policemen , who absolutely did n't assume any risks when they got the job . 
  this whole thing , it fills me with disgust . 
  thank you for being a voice of reason here . 
  many victims of police murder are also innocent . 
  where are the big yanks et all funded charities for them ? 
  they do n't have * a * parent , yes . 
  i grew up with a single mom as well , and so do millions of other children , excuse me while i do n't have any sympathy . 
  15 x 3b = 45b, 
  eh , i want more sidegames along the lines of bbs and days . 
  bbs was arguably better than ii ( not better than the final mix though ) . 
  it 's even sadder when you play it . 
  i was playing the final fight while crying . 
  9b x 1.23 = 11b, 
  $ 41b vs $ 11b, 
  they all should . 
  funding just these two kids is unfair . 
  also , pointless , because they still havpe a perfectly good parent . 
  if you want to help them deal with their father 's murder , how about buying them free counselling instead ? 
  you know , it 's odd to think romania is that much less dangerous than the us . 
  pizza delivery drivers and taxi drivers and such always walk around with huge wads of cash , but you do n't really hear about any of them being robbed . 
  or needing a police escort of all things . 
  that 's actually common in a lot of countries . 
   as to why the game has sold as well as it has on the 3ds ,, 
  it 's one of the cheaper 3ds games . 
  i was also thinking of picking this and dead or alive up someday . 
  the game is cheap enough that it 's worth the price . 
  op , level 5 will be having a christmas sale soon , so wait a little . 
  smtiv and ds :o have similar themes and involve demons , but gameplay and storytelling wise they are very different games . 
  of the two , ** shin megami tensei iv ** is more newcomer friendly , although both games are so ( compared to other entries in the franchise ) . 
  smtiv is a turn-based jrpg focused on atmosphere that demands you explore everything you can and which tells its story more organically , by having you walk around tokyo talking to people and demons , with only occasional cutscenes . 
  people also say that it has bad character development and that it ` does n't really have much of a story ' , although it seems to be the same people who finish the game in like 35 hours and do n't do side-quests ( i spent over 100 on my first playthrough and disagree on both points ) . 
  smtiv can get confusing . 
  i recommend opening the online map if you 're getting frustrated and having trouble finding things . 
  there are also moments when you 'll want to google one thing or another ( like how do you win training battle 9 ) , so it 's better if you have some sort of internet connection when you play it . 
  the gameplay is based on quests , but the battles are quick and satisfying . 
  because of the amount of exploration the game wants you to do , you wo n't have to grind . 
  demon fusion is extremely fun . 
  however , there are frequent random encounters and the beginning can get challenging . 
  the game also has dlc , but it 's arguable whether they 're necessary or add anything . 
  between the two games , smtiv is newer and has gorgeous graphics . 
  keep the 3d turned on . 
  the game has 4 endings . 
  i 've only played it once so far , so i do n't know how the game holds up on replay . 
  ** devil survivor overclocked ** is a grid-based strategy rpg like fire emblem awakening with turn-based elements . 
  there are no random encounters , but you will have to grind a little during the first playthrough . 
  unlike smtiv , ds :o is character and story focused . 
  you can choose which characters to talk to and what events to watch , and based on your choices during the game there are 8 possible endings from 5 possible routes . 
  you can not speak to everyone and visit every location in one playthrough , so each subsequent playthrough stays fresh and exciting . 
  the plot is complex enough to carry this and the characters really grow on you . 
  ~ ~ ds :o is also thematically deeper and better presented than smtiv . ~ ~, 
  while smtiv is thematically deeper , ds :o * explores * its themes more broadly , more deeply and in an overall better way . 
  on the downside , it 's an upgraded port of a ds game , so the graphics are n't all that . 
  it 's functional though , and the game is engrossing enough that you wo n't mind the simpler graphics . 
  the game does n't use 3d , and the top screen only rarely , making this the perfect 3ds game if you need the battery to last as long as possible . 
  both smtiv and ds :o are a steal at $ 14.99 , imho . 
  super/hypermarket manager ? 
  yeah , i feel your pain . 
  i also hoard boxes . 
  i bought my 3ds by saving money and doing a lot of paid overtime for about 3 months . 
  over here it 's something like $ 20 - $ 40 / tooth , depending on the doctor . 
  it still expensive , considering our salaries , but still . 
  romania here . 
  trebuia sa ma uit in dictionar . 
  the 8th day scenarios are a couple of hours long each , so yeah , if you love the game then it 's worth getting . 
  i got myself :, 
  - bravely default, 
  - weapon shop de omasse, 
  for the ds :, 
  - radiant historia, 
  - professor layton and the curious village, 
  i 'll probably sink another few bucks into songs for curtain call . 
  it 's also on sale right now for practically nothing ( considering its original rrp ) . 
  christ is a greek title , not a name . 
  e 570 aici : http://www.kindlestore.ro/kindle/kindle-paperwhite-wifi/, 
  and i updated my firmware . 
  hope gateway will support 9.3 and up someday . 
  eu m-am plans ca pretul variantei internationale era cat pretul variantei americane fara ads . 
  thank you !, 
  i 've been eyeing the layton vs ace attorney crossover , so i 'm really excited to get into these series !, 
  also a bit disappointed that the download puzzles are n't available anymore , but i have another 6 or so layton games ahead so i shouldn ' worry :d, 
  that , combined with the number of actions you do and the type of demons you have with you . 
  how does russian propaganda ass taste ? 
  is is good ? 
  you know , there is a reason russia is hated by every single one of its neighbours and neighbour 's neighbours . 
  you know , people would also hate the germans if they kept idolizing and defending hitler . 
  stalin was arguably worse , this sort of posts are really infuriating . 
  dude , i 'm from romania . 
  i give about as many shits about the russian population as russia gave for the romanian one . 
  also , arguing about stalin being good in any way is just plain ridiculous . 
  i know . 
  i got it from you . 
  a marketing ploy that involved the fbi ? 
  ^ ( i actually did that . ), 
  10k is a huge amount of money to spend somewhere that 's not some sort of luxury bar . 
  done . 
  same here !, 
  my second impression was that people look really ugly . 
  i thought people naturally looked like tv stars , because i was basically applying a corrective blur to everyone 's faces hah, 
  i nominate smtiv for best everything except multiplayer and new ip . 
  fantastic visuals , amazing soundtrack and the story kept me hooked for well over 100 hours - i fell in love with the setting .
