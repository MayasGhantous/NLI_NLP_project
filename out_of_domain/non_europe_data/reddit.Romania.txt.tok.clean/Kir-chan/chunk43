  i do n't understand the question .

  i 'm usually sub only , but i love me some nicely done uk voice acting . 
  me : brown, 
  mom : grey-ish, 
  maternal grandmother : brown, 
  maternal grandfather : brown, 
  dad : brown, 
  his parents died when i was small , so i do n't know . 
   what adjective do you associate most with milk ? 
  absolutely none of those ? 
  luna , marietta , myrtle , ** lockhart ** , trelawney , quirrel . 
  i do n't remember cho being particularly smart either , or that one boyfriend ginny had . 
  in fact , a better question is , what ravenclaw do we actually know that 's smart ? 
  on the other hand , snape is a pretty terrible choice for your sole ` good ' character , since he was a petty bully who abused his authority for most of the books . 
  soft , maternal , friendly , sensitive , naive , comfort . 
  basically things associated with mothers , small children , or a nice comforting cup of chocolate milk . 
  it 's white on my mobile phones ( both of them ) , blue/brown on my desktop monitor .

  persona is a fantastic dungeon crawler . 
  smtiv is a gem in the jrpg genre . 
  vlr is the best vn/puzzle fusion out there . 
  all of these are lower than pushmo ? 
  rune factory 4 is n't even on the list . 
  i was referencing, 
   you need to judge the game by what it tried to do, 
  i honestly think persona or eq are better dungeon crawlers than pushmo is a puzzle game . 
  i honestly think layton and ace attorney are better puzzle games than pushmo , and neither was included . 
  virtue 's last reward, 
  it 's blue and brown though , not black . 
  red and white is light red , not pink . 
  try it . 
  to get pink , purple + red + white .

  my old computer was an old core 2 duo with 1.7 ghz and the emulator ran at 40-50fps on pretty much any game i tried . 
  the only big slowdowns i remember were in the food court scenes in persona 4 , for some reason . 
  what 's with this trend of changing perfectly good names lately ?

  as opposed to which good guys ? 
  smtiv ( and rune factory 4 , which also seems right up your alley ) are only available on the eshop , that 's why you might be having trouble finding it . 
  the op mentioned vlr is 10 euros, 
  do n't save during puzzles and you 'll be fine . 
  unless you actually want an english dub , everything else is a non-issue . 
  there 's two or three rooms that are bugged , but they disabled saving in the one that 99 % of the crashes happened in . 
  the other two can crash in the vita version too , but it 's a non-issue because the vita version has multiple savefiles . 
  just explore the whole map ( as much as you can ) , talk to every npc and do the quests . 
  the game is very much about atmosphere , you ca n't just look for a plot because you wo n't find it that way . 
  you also wo n't like it if you go in just waiting for it to be over . 
  the story progresses from the quests , you ca n't ` mainline ' it .

  cry me a river . 
  so do a lot of other former eastern bloc or post-soviet countries , essentially ruined by russian imperialism . 
   nintendo is n't some scamming shithole company, 
  region lock , country lock + console lock + account lock via nnid , europe prices , utter lack of support outside of like 15 `` nintendo countries '' , not releasing the n3ds in the us , never lowering prices of old games , not releasing snes games on virtual console ... 
  some of those points are feeble at best , but at this point , i 've honestly had better experiences with ea . 
  i do n't like fifa . 
  sims 4 has had excellent support though . 
  also , freebie games on origin .

  you have to be fucking kidding me . 
  devil survivor overclocked added 1gb of audio , and the biggest game on the 3ds has ~ 4gb . 
  so break record has literally 4-5x as much audio as overclocked ? 
   also , it forces us to ensure no female correctional officers are in an area where they can view a nude offender . 
  what , why ? 
  maybe the doctor is actually a trans male and her biological mother . 
  and the mother is actually her father !, 
  so my grandmother has n't technically been catholic for 40 years ?

   accomplices without whose assistance a violation of a law prescribing latae sententiae excommunication would not have been committed, 
  and my grandfather and grand-aunt as well . 
  too late . 
  i think i may have excommunicated myself when i was practising witchcraft in highschool . 
  when i contacted nintendo of germany , they said i had to make a new nnid , but this would delete my dlc , eshop games and their savefiles and there 's no way to recover them . 
  i do n't think it 's possible . 
  my first thought was that that sort of text could help prime someone for transhumanism . 
  life-extension , at the very least - the people i 've mentioned this to ( as a future possibility ) seem to balk at the idea of living beyond the standard 80-100y lifespan . 
  unrelated , but i 'd kill for a shin megami tensei : theatrhythm . 
  and the gbp/eur exchange rate is currently terrible to boot . 
  just a heads up , the ace attorney trilogy is # 19 on the eshop right now ( down from # 25 ) . 
  well shit . 
  me too !, 
  although i have to admit i did n't like the song when i first heard it , but it sort of grows on you , right ?
