  if you like it more for the fun gameplay and the simple characters ... well , probably not so much . 
  yep . 
  but it 's a pretty big title nowadays . 
  personally , i 'm hoping for an atelier rorona localization once it 's out . 
  obligatory psa for vlr :, 
  * play 999 first, 
  * do n't save in puzzle rooms, 
  shovel knight ? 
  not sure what you 're looking for . 
  the inazuma series is a sports game crossed with an rpg . 
  there 's another football game on the eshop , but i do n't remember what it 's called . 
  the layton series is primarily a puzzle game . 
  you advance the story by solving various puzzles , iirc . 
  virtue 's last reward is similar , but it 's much , much more story focused . 
  final fantasy theathrhythm ( spl ? ), 
  curtain call is a rhythm game with some rpg features , but you can ignore them if you want . 
  the music is from the final fantasy series , but it 's very good - the game also has two demos on the eshop if you want to see what it 's like ( one for the old game , and one for curtain call ) . 
  project mirai is another rhythm game coming out soon , although it 's with vocaloid music so ymmv . 
  the eshop also has some simpler puzzle games , like the various picross games and pushmo/crashmo , and some racing games , like hyper speed ex . 
  there 's also a lot of platformers : shovel knight , steamworld dig , sayonara umihara kawase ... 
  harvest moon a new life and story of seasons are both good farming games . 
  someone also recommended style savvy on this subreddit recently , it 's a store management game . 
  i do n't know why it 's so divisive tbh , it just is - i got a huge kick out of trying to figure out what the hell happened haha i think i know what you mean by that faux pas , although it 's a storytelling element i usually enjoy . 
  speaking of ca n't be avoided for 3 , op , you should also look into some articles or videos of kindom hearts chi , that japanese browser game because it turns out that also ties into kh3 's plot ... 
   in inginerie, 
  am spus ca * nu o vei aplica * , e diferit . 
  oh , i definitely understand !, 
  i 've also been using curtain call to unwind between rpgs , it 's sooo relaxing and satisfying . 
  have fun with it !, 
  in state de exemplu nu se predau deloc matrici sau derivate in liceu , decat daca te-ai inscris intr-un curs de matematica avansata : [ sursa ( oarecum dubioasa , scuze ) ] ( https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110714114643aalnxcx ), 
  edit :, 
   en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ap_calculus#ap_calculus_ab, 
  se pare ca include si limite , wtf . 
   an ap course in calculus consists of a full high school academic year of work ** that is comparable to calculus courses in colleges and universities ** . 
  it is expected that students who take an ap course in calculus will seek college credit , college placement , or both , from institutions of higher learning . 
  brb installing tor, 
  plus , altfel decat alcoolul si tigarile , cannabisul este * foarte eficient * in tratamente de [ cancer ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/19/marijuana-and-cancer_n_1898208.html?utm_hp_ref=fb&amp;src=sp&amp;comm_ref=false ) , [ epilepsie ] ( http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/56968773-78/epilepsy-utah-isaac-sintz.html.csp ) sau [ crohn 's ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/339xum/a_medical_marijuana_advocate_has_lost_custody_of/ ) . 
  buying xenoblade * now * for full price would be a better idea because * attack on titan * is an atlus game and atlus games get discounted frequently . 
  nope !, 
  not at all . 
  they 're part of the same sub-series only because they have ~ ~ similar ~ ~ the same mechanics . 
  conception ii is a spike chunsoft game and it 's been on sale a lot . 
  the two devil survivor games . 
  overclocked has * 9 possible endings * across 5 individual routes , three of which have hours and hours of unique content . 
  you can not speak to everyone and visit every location in one playthrough , so each subsequent playthrough stays fresh and exciting . 
  the plot is complex enough to carry this and the characters really grow on you . 
  the second devil survivor game had 5 endings and break record , the 3ds remake coming out now , added a new scenario . 
  i do n't know how many endings that has , but the replay value is very good . 
  fire emblem : awakening , thirded, 
  si mai exista si studii ca asta : [ marijuana may protect against alcohol brain damage ] ( http://www.salem-news.com/articles/august212009/mpp_alcohol_8-21-09.php ), 
   they added a 3d cg opening , i thought it looked great but might look bad to others . 
  what about the opening song , is it still the same ? 
  the song was incredibly addicting , * inori kotoba omoi , kareyuku koto shirazu ni * \u266a, 
  m-am exprimat prost . 
  am corectat .

  [ canada , deasemenea ] ( https://yconic.com/community/thread/t31568?g=posts&amp;redirect_from=studentawards&amp;t=31568 ) . 
  turning off all combat animations is amazing for grinding . 
  din start am generalizat . 
  la fel am generalizat legat de facultati . 
  idea mea era ca indiferent de matematica de la liceu , * in general * o sa ai o sansa sa o faci la facultate . 
  i did n't know i could turn them off for most of the game . 
  it was ... slow . 
  that song is pretty good , thanks !, 
  there 's just two games and their 3ds ports . 
  the ports have tons of extra story content though . 
  i 'm not sure about break record , but overclocked also balanced the game ( the difficulty spikes were even more terrible before ) , and added a boatload of demons and skills . 
  it 's the definitive version and the old ds versions are obsolete - unless you want them for the different covers , i guess ? 
  the supernatural - or rather , the occult in our world - does rely on persistent and reproducible methods . 
  you can create seals to help you find an apartment , there are spells to find lost objects , rituals to summon demons ranging from something as simple as summoning the black man at the crossroads to help you learn a craft , to elaborate and complicated rituals requiring memorizing pages and pages of text and hand-made props . 
  these are all very well documented , there are exercises and steps and procedure . 
  these work ( or do n't work ) for various explainable reasons . 
  the magic mirror fogs over not because you have the right setup and mentality to call upon visions , but because of a well-documented quirk of the brain . 
  if the supernatural existed in our world , if all these spells worked , everyone would know about it . 
  someone would easily pass randi 's challenge and the slew of people summoning solomon 's demons would have a huge effect on the world . 
  ps2 games can be emulated on a pc . 
  the emulator can even load them from the game disc if you wish to avoid piracy . 
  there are a lot of advantages to this - you can up the internal resolution for nice 1080 graphics ( [ it looks * really * good ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfht5axujxm&amp;hd=1 ) ) , there are widescreen patches , undubs ( to avoid fuuka 's voice ) , and it runs on old computers just as good . 
  mine are project mirai dx , story of seasons , devil survivor 2 and attack on titan . 
  i hope devil suvivor 2 and story of seasons actually come out this year though ... ds2 has a tentative release date in november , but smtiv also got delayed a few months this year . 
  and i 'm worried about story of seasons . 
  birth by sleep and days are both more important to the plot at this point than the first game was . 
  i think i had an easier time getting into the convoluted plot than most . 
  i started with watching a kingdom hearts 2 lp until sora appeared , was in shock and not-quite rage for a bit , then hunted down and played days , and then birth by sleep because i was still bitter at sora , before going back into kh2 ( and then going for the final mix ) and playing the first game afterwards . 
  unorthodox , but i 've become really emotionally invested into the game . 
  you may be right . 
  nintendo seems to be aiming to become a luxury brand , to the point of ignoring entire countries they perceive as poor . 
  so far just that and the binding of isaac . 
  but the n3ds has ( or will have , not sure ) unity support , so expect more indie games . 
  that 's just in terms of games . 
  there are other advantages , like the slightly bigger screen , the longer battery life and the 3d effect that actually checks where your face is . 
  but if you 're buying an original 3ds , i suggest skipping that and buying a 3ds xl instead . 
  your stomach starts convulsing if it 's empty for a while , because of the acid , iirc, 
  eating grass ( or paper , or anything really ) would avoid that . 
  what do trade regulations and import taxes have to do with anything ? 
  i do n't think there even are import taxes within the eu . 
  i 'm a fan of this : http://www.labnol.org/internet/phone-desk-stand/28103/, 
  just piping in to recommend rune factory 4 . 
  it plays a lot like a cross between fantasy life and animal crossing , it can be a jrpg with areas to explore , a really , really deep and detailed crafting system , and it has stats for everything from swinging an axe to hitting rocks to sleeping . 
  you can also fish , farm , walk around and talk to townies and there 's in-game competitions from time to time like acnl .
