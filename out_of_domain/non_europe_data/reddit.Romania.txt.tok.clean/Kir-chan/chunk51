  holy shit that 's a lot of water . 
  speaking of shit , does n't that splash * everywhere * when it hits the water ? 
  i had both fenris and anders fight with me in the final battle . 
  it was a good moment . 
  am i the only one who just ca n't play dragon age female characters ? 
  they all all have that ridiculous ass-swaying walking and running animation that i just ca n't stand , and female hawke had it the worst . 
  you should consider the phrasing of the name of your study . 
  it said versus , so i automatically assumed i had to pick a * different * answer than the probability the question gave . 
  a mind-screw , basically - `` i am 70 % sure you will pick a. 
  will you pick a ? 
  no , i wo n't pick a. 
  wait , is picking b the predictable choice then ? '', 
  you 're welcome . 
  am votat ca sarbii ca au avut un cantec misto and for the lulz . 
  italia, 
  estonia,

  si estonia . 
  in difficult battles , origins is very nearly turn-based . 
  you input actions , let the characters carry them out , then immediately pause again for new orders . 
  also , learn cone of cold as soon as you can . 
  yes it is . 
  . se , . mn , . gd , . am and . la do n't work at least , do n't know any others . 
  never again . 
  dar hey , nu regret . 
  330 here and i 'm terrible at platformers and rhythm games . 
  also , action games where you have to avoid combos * in a very specific way * . 
  i feel for you . 
  i think denpa men for the 3ds is like that . 
  the beginning of shin megami tensei iv plays like that too , although it gets far less grindy and dungeony as it goes on , it still has a couple of neat ones . 
  for the ds , you should look up ** shin megami tensei strange journey ** and the various dragon quests and final fantasies . 
  it 's like animal crossing , but better in every single way and with a * lot * more stuff to do . 
  you can :, 
  * farm , the farming system is complex and well-made and incredibly fun . 
  there 's a lot of crops and harvesting your first giant strawberry is * so satisfying * . 
  * you can tame monsters for things like milk or wool , and they can also fight for you . 
  you 'll need milk for cookies , so tame a cow as soon as you see one . 
  bees and chickens too . 
  * the crafting system is spectacular . 
  there 's * so much stuff * . 
  armor , accessories , all kinds of weapons and farming tools , and more food recipes than you 'll know what to do with . 
  cooking was one of my favorite activities in the game . 
  you can give the stuff you craft as gifts to the townies , or you can wear/eat them yourself for stat boosts . 
  * there 's a stat for eating , the more you eat the better stats you get from food ( so eat breakfast every day ! ) . 
  there 's also a stat for any weapon and * every * activity . 
  * fishing !, 
  fishing was great in animal crossing , and it 's pretty much exactly the same here . 
  maybe slightly less variety , but there 's still * a lot * of fish . 
  * there 's dating sim elements - there are townies you can talk to and befriend , all sorts of events involving them , and they 're really charming characters . 
  you can date a lot of them and marry one of them and there 's also various events that involve your boyfriend or girlfriend . 
  you can play as male or female , this determines your dating options . 
  fighting !, 
  exploring !, 
  you explore the regions outside of your town and advance the plot of the game . 
  this unlocks some characters and , like everything else , it 's very fun , the world is big and varied . 
  you can even grow dungeons in your garden and there 's one really difficult bonus dungeon that you can only survive once you 're level 200 or so ( consider it * really * post-game ) . 
  even more , it 's all very customizable . 
  you can recruit your townie friends or your pet monsters to help you fight - all of them have different strengths and uses , and you can even influence the stats of your monsters in various ways , there 's a lot of magic abilities and special moves you can use , and different kinds of weapons so you can pick one that suits your style ( you can even hit things with your hoe ) . 
  in other words , this game is * huge * . 
  i have n't played fantasy life or monster hunter , so i ca n't compare it with those , but this is easily the most expansive game i 've played on the system . 
  i burned out at 130 hours ( i usually do ) , but i had n't even touched the bonus dungeon or marriage yet . 
  i think you can easily spent 150-200 hours in it . 
  to remember :, 
  * the swimming event can glitched . 
  do n't linger around the lake once you 've talked to everyone and you 'll be fine . 
  * if the third act is n't triggering , you can savescum to trigger it . 
  you can look it up if this actually happens though . 
  idk other than that . 
  the game is pretty good about teaching you everything . 
  i could n't even get past that first boss . 
  i heard some people can * defeat * it . 
  i ca n't dodge . 
  i never could , even in easy games , it 's like this big mystery for me and my clumsy fingers . 
  i 'll stick to kingdom hearts for action games kthnx, 
  i actually downloaded a mod to replace f-hawk 's walk with m-hawk 's . 
  the stompity stomp walk was a lot better than what it was originally , although still irritating . 
  the dwarves have the best dungeons and ruins and the elves have the best love interests . 
  really ? 
  it always struck me as a blend of islam with communism with shirtless men . 
  when you ask the iron bull what it would be like if the qun took over , he said that people like sera , solas and dorian would be incompatible with it ( i forget the exact wording or whether he said they 'd be executed ) . 
  tevinter slaves, 
  yep !, 
  i did n't focus that much on fighting and did n't know you could boost your pets by feeding them rocks haha so i was slaughtered the first time i went there . 
  then again , i was also slaughtered when i went into the rune prana . 
  i barely got past the first dungeon bit when i stopped playing ( although i spent a year in-game waiting for the third act to trigger - which was satisfying in its own way ) . 
   because those are friggin skinny jeans . 
  i totally have n't spent way too much time starring at my manquizitor 's ass in skyhold . 
  i 'm also fond of this one :, 
  * [ dragon age redesigned ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/dragonage/mods/686/ ? ), 
  ( the lore version ), 
  this mod redesigns pretty much all npcs to reflect their role in the story - [ battered people look more battered ] ( http://static-8.nexusmods.com/15/mods/140/images/686-4-1264914233.jpg ) , [ older people look older ] ( http://static-7.nexusmods.com/15/mods/140/images/686-2-1264914233.jpg ) , [ warriors look more warrior-y ] ( http://static-7.nexusmods.com/15/mods/140/images/686-1-1264914173.jpg ) . 
  there are three version , but i 'm partial to the `` lore '' version because it has the fewest changes and stays close to the game . 
  the companions have individual edits which you can individually choose to add or not - [ zevran ] ( http://static-8.nexusmods.com/15/mods/140/images/686-1-1315544238.jpg ) , for example , looks really good .
