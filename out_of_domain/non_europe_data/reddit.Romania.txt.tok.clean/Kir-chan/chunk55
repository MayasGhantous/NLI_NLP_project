  i 'm so pumped !, 
  have you played ~ ~ any other ~ ~ every other kingdom hearts game ? 
  are you planning to play kingdom hearts iii when it comes out ? 
  that 's basically what it boils down to . 
  the kh games are episodes of one story rather than individual stories . 
  kh 3d is basically the prologue to iii . 
  kingdom hearts 3d i guess . 
  the kingdom hearts series in general is very good and entirely linear . 
  they have some post-game content , but it 's hardly mandatory . 
  although it 's not linear , a game that fits what you 're asking is virtue 's last reward . 
  there are no sidequests , or collectibles or any sort of exploration - it 's a visual novel . 
  once the game is done , it 's done . 
  the reason it 's not considered linear is because it has a time travel mechanic that you use to experience the whole game and multiple endings , but those endings are not , well , endings - you have to play them and then you go back and make a different decision , often using what you learned from that ending . 
  yes . 
  definitely , it 's absolutely required for 3 . 
  you should also get 358/2 days for the ds while you 're at it , you can find it relatively cheap on amazon and ebay . 
  i 'm right handed and i do that too . 
  it just makes no sense to me to use anything other than the arrow keys to move and my left hand ( q / e ) to control the camera . 
  * dragon age ii was my favourite dragon age . 
  the characters were amazing , the story was amazing and the battle mechanics were exciting . 
  its flaws are not things i mind . 
  * i hate sprawling forest maps . 
  give me a good city or an exciting dungeon ( like the deep roads in da :o ) any day , but please no forests . 
  they 're so mundane . 
  i dislike open maps in general , but forests are the worst . 
  * i do n't like shooters . 
  i ca n't even see the attraction . 
  i do n't understand it at all . 
  one more group :, 
  * people who did n't grow up with these games but want to experience them anyway , and do n't particularly care about graphics . 
  i could never get into ff8 - i hate it when the enemies adjust to your level . 
  slimes are not supposed to be that powerful dammit . 
  real emotion is one of my favorite songs . 
  i play it laying on my side in bed and i switch to the other side if it gets uncomfortable . 
  me too !, 
  i also wrote that ai 'd love kh songs in theaterythm . 
  ^ ( is it bad that i liked it ? ), 
  the favourite genres question had me worried . 
  i hope they 're not considering multiplayer . 
  he was pretty clear on slavery . 
  you are not allowed to beat your slave so badly he ca n't stand up two days later . 
  that 's enough , right ? 
  * looks through comments *, 
  they did have boats . 
  the thing is , noah 's boat was a magical boat blessed by god and every other boat was n't so they sank . 
  not just the boat , but the flood itself was magical and killed everything . 
  at least , that 's the explanation i got when i was 8 . 
  `` you 're cherrypicking and taking things out of context , jesus said ... '', 
  `` i do n't care about science . 
  i do n't need any evidence for believing in god . '', 
  babies are also often referred to as ` it ' if you do n't know it 's gender yet . 
  `` is it a boy or a girl ? '', 
  when igarashi did that ama for bloodstained recently , he said that multiplayer is one of the most expensive aspects to develop in a game . 
  the multiplayer in days and bbs was fine because it was so limited . 
  i 'm just hoping kh3 wo n't try to incorporate more complex multiplayer . 
  i bought a 3ds because kingdom hearts . 
  just emulate it on pc . 
  there 's a translation patch for the final mix as well - or you can just buy a copy and then play it on the emulator . 
  it runs very well and you can play a higher resolution . 
  i 'm curious how the sales compare / will compare to a new beginning and the lost valley . 
  i have a feeling the rebrand will have a positive effect on sales . 
  * looks at phone *, 
  well , it has terraria and some dragon quest on it . 
  i 'll probably be getting final fantasy mevius too . 
  i think the import question addressed that . 
  you list the languages you know , and then it asks you whether you need the game in your language or are fine importing it . 
  i do n't understand what you mean . 
  it basically asks you `` will you import the game if we do n't localize it to _____ ? '', 
   i saw its songs being sung by everyone, 
  its songs or just that one verse from let it go ? 
  now i 'm curious how a let it go remix by yoko shimomura would sound . 
  aaand more reason to pretend / r/all does n't exist . 
  somewhat unrelated , but, 
   the authorities claim he had no bathroom , but the responding officer found our yard good enough to relieve himself in while our son sat in a police car alone . 
  is n't that public indecency ? 
  i thought taking a piss in public with a kid watching puts you on some sort of sex offender list ? 
  and give the commenters who agree with you gold so the website really knows you disagree !, 
  i just subscribed because somehow srs managed to become one of the most positive places on reddit during this shitstorm , and it changed my opinion of the sub . 
  ^ ( i do n't know if anyone will know what i 'm talking about , but reading stuff here , it feels like the fandom_wank of olde and i missed that a lot . ), 
  maybe his porn stash was called firefox . 
  thanks !, 
  not him , but [ here ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/39c0n3/cmv_reddit_was_wrong_to_ban_rfatpeoplehate_but/cs27yt4 ) . 
  ~ ~ by all accounts , it was a sunny day . 
  what 's wrong with leaving him outside to play , but keep an eye out in case something happens ? ~ ~, 
  it 's released by nisa , so no . 
  these people are talking about the us eshop , where atlus is regularly on sale . 
  the only smt games you can expect to go on sale are smtiv ( released by atlus ) and overclocked ( released by ghostlight ) . 
  remember not to update your console . 
  i do n't think anybody will disagree that a computer is primarily a tool . 
  but hey , it can be both - just like phones , it 's just a matter of having games for it . 
  are n't all cells replaced within the course of our natural life anyway ? 
  it 's fine , he apologised and say he would n't do it again by creating rainbows and sending a dove with an olive branch . 
  oh , i missed that part . 
  i thought they were stuck in traffic . 
  only when they come from women . 
  in fact , they do n't even need to be fake just as long as women make them ~, 
  make it a wheeled crate and put the videos on youtube #properparenting, 
  it was n't about censorship though , it was about [ harassment ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/39c0n3/cmv_reddit_was_wrong_to_ban_rfatpeoplehate_but/cs27yt4 ) . 
  and acting out like this is undermiming your point . 
  i wish atlus would take a page from square 's book and stop ignoring europe .
