  i 'd say the fact that there are many , many subreddits that were n't banned ( like coontown ) is proof that this is n't about censoring something . 
  however , i 'm not even sure how many subreddits there are that did anything even close to brigading suicide watch to tell a redditor to kill himself . 
  we both agree , and anyone who sees that post and thinks about it for a minute , that fph * deserves * to be banned . 
  as for the actual reason it was banned ( i agree it was probably the imgur thing that broke the camel 's back ) , why would anyone expect a subreddit * not * to be banned if it tacitly encouraged harassing one of the most important financial partners of this website ? 
  it 's still a business and we , the users , have an enormous amount of latitude - but there are cases when the admins ca n't not act . 
  at best you can say that reddit did `` the right thing for the wrong reasons '' , but even those reasons are justified . 
  if you wish to go to a website that also upholds free speech to an extreme , but does n't care about being a business , there 's also 4chan . 
  but it says a lot when even 4chan was more civil about this entire thing than fhp . 
  anyway , so you are attacking the ceo , who may or may not have made this decision herself , and i suspect she did n't , for something that was both * morally * right to do ( inasfar as morality applies in this situation ) and justified from a business standpoint , because you 're worried about the precedent it sets , when it 's an entirely exceptional situation . 
  ( btw , i did n't downvote you , i upvoted you because you seem willing to discuss it ), 
  well , there 's 50 vines , or 50 comics or 5 cosplays that seem small numbers . 
  youtube still needs 49k views and twitter 21k followers . 
  no idea how many retweets are still needed . 
  the problem with cosplay is that it takes time to create an outfit . 
  8 hours left . 
  if someone already has something similar to what ~ ~ gebel ~ ~ johannes ( to be realistic ) is wearing , they could round up 4 friends and make 5 cosplays . 
  edit : mixed up the names . 
  if there ever was a case for `` transrace '' , michael jackson was probably it . 
  i was a teenager when i found out he used to have black skin . 
  it 's niche , but not extremely . 
  asking a japanese person would be better , but i assume it 's the most similar to the anime/manga market in germany or france , where - just as in japan - people grew up watching anime and reading manga ( okay , disney comics , manga less so than in japan ) . 
  which is a great thing in a way , because making porn has far more potential adverse effects than just having ( safe ) sex , like if someone finds that porn later . 
  to-love-ru ( the manga with easteregg reflections that was mentioned ) was originally being serialized in shonen jump , the manga magazine with the most widespread readership . 
  people who were following naruto or one piece were also reading that . 
  [ the magazine it moved to ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jump_square ) seems to move about 370k copies per issue . 
  ^ ^ post ^ ^ brought ^ ^ to ^ ^ you ^ ^ by [ ^ ^ that ^ ^ one ^ ^ episode ] ( http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7dx7kidty1rncicho1_500.jpg#actualimage ) ^ ^ of ^ ^ gintama . 
  i was arguing for `` niche , but not extremely '' . 
  and that 's the number for the new magazine . 
  its old magazine , weekly shonen jump , sells 2.7 million copies according to wikipedia so yes the magazine is mainstream . 
  it ended/moved in 2009 . 
  nisekoi maybe ? 
  ( and hey , i do count shokugeki no souma . 
  although i do n't think every single series in it can be called mainstream . ), 
   ** if ** there ever was a case for, 
   black ** skin **, 
  i even tried to pick my words carefully and everything ; _ ;, 
  thanks . 
  if it makes it any better , i was n't trying to say he * was * transrace , because the whole concept around transrace makes my mind hurt , it was just supposed to be a silly observation . 
  same . 
  i bought those two , child of light and valkyrie chronicles . 
  col was a bit of an impulse buy though . 
  / r/europe , / r/science , / r/changemyview , / r/eli5 , / r/atheism , / r/unexpected , / r/shittylifeprotips , / r/3ds , / r/megaten , / r/kingdomhearts, 
  erau un loc ferit in tot shitstormul ala. 
  i get the feeling lots of people , when reading the title , think of it as default title and forget that it 's also a verb ( defaulting on your mortgage , defaulting your turn ) . 
  hey , it 's technically a ** village ** simulator . 
  and her response would be , `` so you 're not happy . '', 
  there was a thread a few hours after fph was banned , from an angry fph manchild , asking people to stop giving gold to reddit . 
  the thread had 33 gold when i read it and all the top level comments were gilded several times , by people protesting the bullshit . 
  more people were `` converted '' after that one redditor on cmv compiled a list of fph harrassing people and actually breaking rules . 
  i do n't know how things were years ago , i only joined reddit last year , but the people ( except for the vocal angry minorities ) are fairly reasonable these days . 
  i find it confusing . 
  what am i watching there ? 
  it looks like a guy shooting a gun at a crowd . 
  or maybe just threatening them . 
  wait , so the bible not only does n't say anything against abortion , it actually encourages it ? 
  why is n't this more of a talking point ? 
  i read it , i do n't remember this part . 
  i must have skipped it or something . 
  i wonder how many christians are aware of this . 
  the line in the sand is 14 where i live , so i have trouble thinking of the act itself as statury rape , but considering she was in a position of authority it should still count as abuse of power and rape . 
   it does still, 
  it * may * still . 
  but it 's not the sex , it 's the abuse of power , the lack of honesty from one party , and the adult themelves being an abusive ass that will fuck the teenager up . 
  what they need to be protected from . 
  an adult - a married adult , from most of the examples in the thread - seeking out a teenager for sex will not be the kind of person * anyone * , regardless of age , can have a healthy relationship with . 
  highschool junior with an adult ... ? 
  that happens all the time in fiction . 
  or , well , used to happen . 
  reading that felt like reading an episode summary of hetalia . 
  i can just imagine greece falling asleep somewhere while germany sits stiffly in his chair and italy bounces around . 
  thank god there are atheists to properly study the bible . 
  when they started the promo , i was like `` no , it ca n't be . 
  no way . '', 
  then the ff7 music started and i went crazy . 
  sony officially won e3 . 
  this is the first one i saw, 
  suntem o tara de oameni care au copiat la examene , la multi nu le-a pasat din start de plagiat . 
  he 's about 16 in kh3 iirc, 
  for that it has to come out after ffxv so the people from kh2 actually get to work on it a little . 
  ( ffxv is being made by the kh1 +2 team , and kh3 by the bbs and ddd team . ), 
  ddd is the prequel/prologue/intro to kh3 . 
  bbs provides vital backstory to the world and the characters . 
  358/2 days is roxas ' and xion 's story . 
  xion is in ddd and will be in kh3 . 
  recoded is just a recap of the first game , but it has fun gameplay . 
  chain of memories is the story of what happened between kh 1 and 2 . 
  it 's the equivalent of ddd for kh2 . 
  crisis core was what dragged me into gaming for the first time since back when we had to load our games from norton commander . 
  it was an absolutely amazing experience . 
  not really lately . 
  hopefully they 'll include both audio tracks as they did with awakening . 
  there have been some odd choices for translating titles on the 3ds lately -, 
  break record -  record breaker, 
  fire emblem : if ... -  fire emblem fates, 
  til ? 
  that 's literally the only rule wicca has and it does n't leave any room for interpretation , unlike everything in the bible . 
  that 's what i thought during ddd too . 
  riku looks a lot more masculine , and sora 's face became more feminine/pretty . 
  ouch . 
  thanks for the warning , i was about to buy it .
