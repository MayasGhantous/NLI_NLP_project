  for three days straight , i slept , ate and played that game . 
  devil survivor 1 . 
  it 's less dated , and really really good . 
  smt . 
  you collect demons instead of pokemon , and you fuse them instead of breeding them . 
  either smtiv or one of the devil survivors is fine - smtiv is more classic jrpg with turn-based gameplay , and desu are story-heavy tactical rpgs , gameplay along the lines of fire emblem ( you should get fire emblem too , by the way !, 
  well , there 's obviously the fire emblem and pokemons that you should check out , and two new ace attorneys ( one of them is a crossover with professor layton ) . 
  there 's also a kingdom hearts with twewy characters in it , but only if you 've played the other games in the series . 
  here 's a list of other things you should check out :, 
  * rune factory 4 - fantasy jrpg , although not turn-based . 
  it 's a really relaxing game . 
  you spend your time farming , recruiting monsters , dating your waifu/husbando , crafting , cooking , exploring , fishing and dungeon crawling . 
  * bravely default - old school final fantasy under a different title . 
  there 's a really good demo out there . 
  it has the best soundtrack of any game on the 3ds . 
  * shin megami tensei 4 - turn-based jrpg , rather dark , very atmospheric, 
  * devil survivor overclocked - grid-based strategy like fire emblem combined with turn-based battles . 
  amazing story and really explores its themes of religion , morality and the end of the world deeply . 
  it 's a great experience and you have to try it . 
  * devil survivor break record - same gameplay as above , better cast of characters , but in exchange for a somewhat worse story . 
  the two games are unrelated other than the gameplay . 
  * etrian odyssey - turn-based dungeon crawling , if somewhat light on story . 
  if you 've played the persona series , persona q is a good entry into this series . 
  * the zero escape series ( 999 and virtue 's last reward ) - this is an extremely story heavy puzzle game . 
  i mention it because it 's somewhat similar to ace attorney ( solve puzzles by finding clues and lots of story ), 
  if you like final fantasy music , you should also look into theatrhythm curtain call . 
  it 's a really fun rhythm game with oodles of music ( over 200 songs ) and dlc from various square enix games , including chrono trigger and twewy . 
  those are very different games , you ca n't really compare them with each other . 
  get awakening though , fates is already out in japan and coming to the west soon , and it 's better if you 've played awakening by the time it comes out . 
  the atheist position is n't that it 's necessarily bad to stay a virgin until marriage ( although it 's weird and quite possibly unhealthy ) , just that you should have a choice whether you want to do that . 
  your church seems a lot more liberal than what most of us are used to though - the sexual shaming the church generally does , particularly how it says you 're going to hell unless you confess to your pastor about your pre-marital sex life , is the direct reason why i 'm personally an atheist now . 
  my community was not fundamentalist at all . 
  tele-evangelists ? 
  i feel a little bad for the politicians , corporate leaders and regular people caught up in this , but the good pious christians deserve every bit of the humiliation for being such hypocrites . 
  ** question 1 : ** bad - abortions are obviously not good . 
  they can be traumatic in various ways , are very looked down upon in society and necessarily involve something close to murder . 
  however -, 
  ** question 2 : ** yes . 
  all humans should have the right to decide what happens with their body . 
  if the only way for an adult human to survive was to surgically attach him to an unwilling `` donor '' , would anyone ever argue about the morality of * that * ? 
  we do n't even have mandatory blood donation , and that 's way more basic than a pregnancy . 
  forcing someone to play host to what 's essentially a parasite for 9 months is cruel and immoral . 
  the argument that it 's a future human is bull , if that were so we should be preserving and using every single egg every single woman produces , because all of those are potential humans . 
  in fact , my position on question 2 is on the extreme end even for pro-choice - viability should not be an issue . 
  if it 's using the woman 's body to survive , the woman should have the right to cut it off - for a viable fetus you do n't even have to abort it , `` viable '' means that you can remove it via caesarean , treat it like a premature birth and keep it in the hospital until it 's old enough to be adopted by someone who actually wants children . 
  if it does n't survive , then it obviously was n't viable . 
  nope , persona 4 is on the ps2 and on the vita . 
  persona 3 is on the ps2 and the psp , although the ps2 version is recommended for the first playthrough . 
  persona q is half etrian odyssey , half a fanservice game for persona 3 and 4 . 
  if you do n't have the platforms for the persona games , are unwilling to emulate them or just want a 3ds game , just skip persona q and go for etrian odyssey iv or the other smt games . 
  catholic , yes . 
  confessing to a pastor was a necessary step . 
  they did n't actually talk about this , and it was n't the sex itself that would have sent me to hell . 
  impure thoughts and sexual activity was on the sin list for older teenagers in my catechism -  i was aware of this before my first confession -  i knowingly did not list it to my pastor -  the confession was invalid , i was still sinful -  i did my first communion in that state = sacrilege -  i never did list either that or the sacrilege , so i knowingly repeated it -  hell . 
  i 'd say days creates a far larger emotional impact when you realize what happened and what 's going to happen to roxas . 
  but the actual bad part is that new players will just watch the cutscenes instead of playing the ds games . 
  none yet , but they 're supposedly making unity compatible with the n3ds so expect more indie games . 
  the homebrew gba emulator also runs well on the n3ds compared to the 3ds . 
  probably . 
  the bigger question is , will eo 5 ever be a thing . 
  there 's also a second devil survivor game . 
  rune factory is harvest moon with dungeon crawling and battle mechanics . 
   history has shown that when consumers decide they do n't want a system right out of the gate , it 's really hard to ever change their mind . 
  history really changed huh, 
   then drop the price of the vita to $ 150, 
  this is literally all they have to do . 
  the vita is the only portable console with western games on it . 
  it has tons of indies , and also tons of jrpg - the high price of the console combined with the ripoff memory card prices are the main reason it 's not selling . 
  present tense , because by now it has a very good library , which it did n't in the past . 
  maybe it will be a laptop type thing . 
  that would be cool . 
  before taxes ? 
  at least they exist ? 
  the 3ds does n't have the kind of western games some people are looking for . 
  it ca n't , those people also want graphics and large terrains - if someone is looking for a handheld console to play this type of game , the vita is literally their only choice . 
  it does n't matter that the games are shit , it matters that they at least exist . 
  the vita has , imho , these 3 strengths :, 
  * `` panty quest '' - esque niche fanservice jrpgs , and equally niche vns, 
  * a number of big-name jrpgs the 3ds is missing, 
  * western games , this includes indies , but particularly the handful of ` mature ' aaas, 
  the 3ds has :, 
  * key big-name jrpgs, 
  * puzzle games, 
  * games for young children, 
  the vita , due to only having japanese support right now , has been focusing on 1 and 2 . 
  1 is a loyal but small market ; but it 's problematic from an image marketing standpoint . 
  2 is more promising , but puts it in direct competition with the bigger and better exclusive titles on the 3ds . 
  it ca n't win , it can only attract some of the audience . 
  but the vita * does * have something the 3ds lacks by design . 
  sony should * focus * more on that . 
  i really want to try playing senbonzakura . 
  i have n't opened the demo yet because of the stupid 1 use limit . 
  thanks for the info !, 
  i 'll redownload it then !, 
  look through the submissions to this sub , there was a way to launch tubehax without using the dns thing , that might help . 
  investigations 2 has a fan-translation though , if people want to play it . 
  i had more trouble with actual ansem , but the dragon was stronger than riku for sure . 
  i must have died a dozen times before i ( barely ) killed it . 
  it did n't change , still just one use d :, 
  contra .
