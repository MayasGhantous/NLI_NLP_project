  well that 's great . 
  but we 're not christians . 
  please link me to a single video of dawkins being anything less than perfectly polite and curteous . 
  the only inflammatory things i can find from him are book titles and a handful of tweets that can be interpreted either way . 
  yes , i need a source on that . 
  i 've only recently started watching his debates , i 've seen about a dozen of them , and he 's the nicest , most polite debater i 've ever watched . 
  it 's not that i do n't believe you , but i feel there might be some context on that . 
  twitter is a terrible form of communication . 
  you ca n't explain yourself in 140 characters , and it 's impulsive by nature . 
  i trust watching him * speak * far more than reading whatever derivative tidbit caught his attention for the 10 seconds needed to retweet something . 
  about the dismissal of rape victims and the countless other things , i 'll need a source . 
  i 'm also curious about that red pill talking point . 
  hopefully non-twitter , but i guess i 'll take that too . 
  okay , this is the first time i 'm aware of that letter , as i only recently started paying attention to him . 
  my first impression is that seems some pretty obvious , heavy sarcasm . 
  if it is n't , it 's not particularly defensible , and he needs to apologise and explain himself . 
  i 'll be quite happy not reading his feed , but he 's still a fantastic ( and polite ) public speaker . 
  the horrible treatment of women in that corner of the world and within that religion was a point that needed to be pressed back then a few years ago , but he picked a bad way to do it . 
  holy shit i 've lost a page-long comment twice now trying to reply to you , so i 'll keep this third attempt shorter . 
  about the nobel prize tweet : there 's an interesting chain [ here ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/3ng0rm/enough_richard_dawkins_bashing_let_us_praise_a/cvnxij8 ) . 
  i can see dawkins not having thought that through , and i agree he 's wrong about it , but i do n't believe he was attacking the believers . 
  about the segregation : i watched the debate and i saw him call out the segregation . 
  i agree with the tweets , and the article itself only seems to have an issue with him saying `` the muslims '' instead of `` those particular muslims '' . 
  it was a debate titled `` islam or atheism '' , if it was called `` islam or christianity '' people would talk about `` the christians '' . 
  it 's just how you refer to one side . 
  then there is :, 
   `` i think islam is the greatest force for evil in the world today . 
  i 've said so , often and loudly . 
  what are you talking about ? '' he tweeted to one follower in march . 
   yet , it can be possible to detest discrimination towards muslims and also disagree with some , or even all , of islam 's teachings . 
  he was n't saying * muslims * are a force of evil , he was calling out the faith itself , or more accurately the teachings . 
  he 's a teacher . 
  for him , the teachings = the religion , this has held for all of his debates , and when he debates christianity he always refers back to the horrible , horrible teachings in the bible as if that encompasses the entirety of the faith . 
  and maybe it does in a way , when people do not disown them , but it 's not an attack on the believers . 
  dawkins attacks faith . 
  believers hold the faith dear and * feel * themselves under attack and respond as if they were being personally attacked . 
  ( the muslima thing was pretty bad though , now that i 've read it . ), 
  playing days before khii can be a good idea . 
  roxas 's story is given much more impact . 
  let 's not forget that over 80 % of muslims worldwide think homosexuality is morally wrong , and the only muslims who do n't overwhelmingly think a wife must obey her huband are the ones in se europe . 
  these are actual , real numbers . 
  they are not generalizations and they were not compiled by bigots . 
  i feel these should * not * be forgotten when we talk about social justice . 
  this was two years ago . 
  i hope the numbers changed for the better though , if only a little . 
  over 80 % of muslims worldwide think homosexuality is morally wrong , and the only muslims who do n't overwhelmingly think a wife must obey her huband are the ones in se europe . 
  these are actual , real numbers . 
  they are not generalizations and they were not compiled by bigots . 
  i feel these should * not * be forgotten when we talk about social justice . 
  that still leaves  20 % decent people , but when the number of people who do n't want to stone adulterers resembles the percentage of feminist mras , and the entire group thinks that having sex with a 9 year old can be excused * in some cases * , there is a problem with the group . 
  there are a variety of factors involved in causing this , of course , but is it really wrong to point fingers at the common element - the koran ? 
  this might be helpful !, 
  smt4 is definitely one of the best entry points into the franchise . 
  2 ) i heard people recommend the r4i gold . 
  the supercard ds two is more pricey , but it also plays gba games . 
  oh fuck , hand tumor fusion accident lucifer is still there . 
  that was the * one * thing i was hoping they 'd change . 
  i was calling it a constant, 
  there are a lot of variables . 
  there are entire books worth of variables . 
  i wanted him changed back to his kaneko designs . 
  [ any ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/megamitensei/images/9/9d/kazumakaneko-helel.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080926062523 ) [ of ] ( http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080926062734/megamitensei/images/d/db/kazumakaneko-lucifer.jpg ) [ them ] ( http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/megamitensei/images/9/94/smt-datenshi.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080926085316 ) . 
  kaneko lucifer never again huh ? 
  this was the one thing i was hoping for when i saw the announcement . 
  i still have old games to play through . 
  i strongly prefer doi to that other guy who did the terrible new demon designs for smtiv , but i 'll never be okay for anyone taking over for kaneko . 
  kaneko * is * smt for me . 
  you could move the camera ? 
  hooooly til !, 
  but yeah , i did n't seem to have as much trouble as others with it . 
  nintendo platformers aside ( since those are the first things you should look into ) , if you have some sort of earphones , final fantasy theatrythm curtain call could be a good addition . 
  it 's a rhythm game with over 200 songs in it , and the songs are 2-4 minutes , perfect to just pick up , play and put down again . 
  the only caveat is that you 'd need to play it to unlock most songs . 
  you ca n't get dlc with it , and pressing home crashes it . 
  you 're better off buying the eshop version . 
  are you using naoto ? 
  if you are n't , why are n't you using naoto ? 
  she can one-shot random mobs and even some foes on her own . 
  smt4 . 
  for the devil survivors , it 's useful to be familiar with the spell names and the turn system . 
  but they 're perfectly fine games as well . 
  soul hackers is a bad place to start because it 's a port of an old game and it 's somewhat dated . 
  ideally , you should start with persona 3 , persona 4 or digital devil saga on the ps2 ( or the emulator ) . 
  there 's not a lot of dungeon crawling in the game , if that 's what you 're worried about . 
  the biggest dungeon is naraku in the beginning . 
  all of it is in third person , with the camera behind your character , only the battles are first person . 
  the menus are very intuitive and easy to use . 
  do n't grind , use buffs . 
  all early bosses are really susceptible to them . 
  sukunda lowers the hit/evade rate of the enemy . 
  sukukaja raises your hit/evade rate . 
  teach one of these skills to all your demons and treasure it . 
  tarunda lowers the enemy 's attack , rakukaja raises your defence - if you have trouble surviving hits , use these . 
  on the 3ds , shin megami tensei iv . 
  it 's a mainline game that was designed with new players in mind . 
  it starts out difficult , but it tapers off once you 're in the unclean one 's territory . 
  it 's also on sale . 
  other than that , the devil survivor games are both fantastic and quite newcomer friendly . 
  they 're not related to each other by plot . 
  soul hackers is a port of a saturn game , so it can seem dated and it 's not a great place to start .
