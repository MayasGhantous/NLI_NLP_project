  strange journey on the ds is a hardcore dungeon crawler that you must play at some point , but it 's a really bad entry point . 
  if we include other consoles , the best games to get into the series are digital devil saga on the ps2 or persona 4 ( ps2 and vita ) . 
  persona 3 as well , the ps2 version is better for a first playthrough than the psp version . 
  they are available via psn , but imho ps2 games are best played on the emulator - the emulator loads ps2 discs fine , so no piracy needed . 
  i have n't played them , but i followed a lot of discussion about it . 
  white is more like awakening . 
  it 's easier and the story is better , but the maps are simple . 
  black has a lot more varied map objectives , and the gameplay is overall more difficult . 
  it also has less opportunity to grind . 
  the story is supposedly pretty bad , but people seem to like the characters more on this route . 
  i 'd say to give him black and take white . 
  generally you want to play white -  black -  dlc route . 
  i stopped playing ds :o at 96 hours ( i usually burn out on games at this point ) and i had n't done everything yet - most people spend less time on it though , it really depends on how many endings you want to play . 
  the game is a grid-based srpg along the lines of fire emblem , with some turn-based elements . 
  you attack enemies on that grid , then it opens a turn-based battle that lasts 1-2 rounds ( you attack , the enemy attacks , bonus attacks maybe ) . 
  i really loved this system . 
  the boss battles are * difficult * and the gameplay will keep you on your toes for the entire game . 
  from a story perspective , it 's very dark and deep . 
  it deals with religion and morality , and not in a shallow way . 
  there are multiples routes and multiple endings - and i 'm not joking , there are 8 endings across 5 routes - so you can follow your own beliefs wherever they take you . 
  all of the them have fantastic writing . 
  in the game , you and your friends are trapped in an area of tokyo that was blocked off ; demons attack , people panic and despair . 
  there 's a religious cult either holding everyone together or fanning the flames , depending on how you look at it . 
  you do n't know why you are there or what 's happening , all you have is a device your creepy cousin left you that can control demons and you use it to defend yourself . 
  you have 7 days to figure out what 's happening and to survive . 
  there 's a time management system that encourages multiple playthroughs - you can not see everything on a single playthrough . 
  it 's one of my favorite games on the ds . 
  i typed up half a page of smt history before i realised that would confuse you even more lol the image should answer your questions . 
  the megaten franchise has a lot of games in it . 
  the numbered games called shin megami tensei 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 are what we call `` mainline '' . 
  persona is a sub-series in the franchise that is more popular than the main games ; persona q is a spin-off crossover game with persona 3 and 4 characters . 
  in terms of gameplay , persona 3 and 4 are dungeon crawlers by night , social sims by day . 
  both have a more solid plot and more developed characters than any of the mainline games . 
  the mainline games rely more on general atmosphere and making moral choices , with multiple endings . 
  persona 4 : golden is a better entry point to the series !, 
  as well as digital devil saga on psn . 
  i looked through the list of demons ... 
  gremlin ( lv 10 ) learns sukukaja at lv 12, 
  knocker ( lv 8 ) has rakukaja, 
  tangata manu ( lv 2 ) learns sukukaja at lv 4, 
  harpy ( lv 9 ) learns sukukaja at lv 10, 
  angel ( lv 3 ) learns rakukaja at lv 5, 
  fortuna ( lv 11 ) comes with sukukaja, 
  after that it 's just a matter of fusing the skill , sukukaja in particular , onto other demons . 
  well ... of course you 're supposed to try to recruit every demon you come across and fuse it into something else . 
  that 's half the fun . 
  you get plenty of time to run around naraku and that other forest in regular gameplay just doing the quests . 
  smt4 :, 
  * jrpg like nocturne, 
  * the gameplay is a homage more to smt 1 and 2 though, 
  * good plot, 
  * the characters do n't have any character development, 
  * amazing atmosphere , encourages exploration, 
  * you progress through the plot by going on missions, 
  * the missions are very varied , there 's a bit of everything ( good and bad ), 
  * some interesting and some plain dungeons ; dungeon crawling is in 3rd person, 
  * has an overworld map ( a really confusing one though ), 
  * beautiful graphics , great 3d, 
  * gets easier as you progress through it , can become trivially easy, 
  * multiple endings : 4 , ng + , some content for a new playthrough ( post alignment lock mostly ), 
  * you can experience enough of the game in one playthrough though , if that 's how you roll, 
  * dlc costumes , battles , convenience stuff ( money , exp ) and bits of story, 
  * goes on sale frequently in the eu, 
  * has a sequel coming out ( q1 2016 for jp ), 
  ds :o, 
  * srpg with jrpg elements, 
  * really tight and interesting plot , one of the best on the 3ds, 
  * good characters, 
  * no exploration , you pick events from a list ; there 's a time management system, 
  * ds graphics , no 3d , only uses the bottom screen, 
  * because of this the battery lasts * forever *, 
  * the game gets harder as you progress through it , brace yourself for difficulty spikes, 
  * multiple endings : ** 8 ** , customizable ng + , loads of content for a new playthrough, 
  * you ca n't experience all of the game in one playthrough, 
  * no dlc and no online features to worry about if you do n't have wifi, 
  both :, 
  * no multiplayer, 
  * neither are sequels to anything, 
  * themes include religion , morality and survival ( ds :o does it better ), 
  * fully voice acted but no dual audio, 
  * a lot of demons , smtiv has more, 
  * go on sale a lot in the us . 
  smt4 is on sale now , overclocked soon, 
  did i get everything ? 
  personally , i like both equally - i 'd say get both while they 're on sale . 
  ... smash ? 
  zero escape 3 and hopefully omori, 
  recommending rune factory 4 since it might fly under your radar . 
  it 's an amazing little gem of a game , it 's like animal crossing without animal people , with farming and crossed with a jrpg . 
  great list !, 
  here some more :, 
  * str is useless . 
  if you want a physical build , you need to push dex . 
  * do the missions . 
  they 're not side-content , they 're the meat of the game . 
  * once you 're in the unclean one 's territory , do n't mess with the camera on the overworld map or you will get hopelessly lost . 
  * explore everything , talk to everyone - multiple times at various points in the game . 
  one of the late missions gives you the awesome ability to fly across the map wherever you want . 
  * osiris ' coffin is behind a waterfall . 
  this mission gave me so many headaches .
