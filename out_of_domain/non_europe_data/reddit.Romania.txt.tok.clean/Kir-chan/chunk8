  the cheapest i can get from amazon is still # 26 , but i 'll consider it on my next paycheck ( depending on when they release smtiv ) . 
  the picture is from the first game though . 
  and people were defending the potential 50eur price in europe ... 
  i wish we had 15eur major games . 
  just make sure to play the other kh games , or the plot wo n't make any sense . 
  premium editions !, 
  thank youuuuu !!, 
  you 're kinda missing out on a lot of smt without a 3ds . 
  the answer does n't really count for ` replay ' value ... 
  p3p is also told visual novel style , while fes has 3d characters so you can actually see what 's happening in a room while everyone is talking . 
  p3p also is also too easy as a game , because they did n't balance it around being able to control your teammates . 
  i say play fes , then go play p3p for the femc route . 
  you can emulate ps2 games ... in fact , emulating them is better nowadays . 
  it took me 100 hours just to finish one playthrough on hard . 
  i honestly do n't understand how people can finish it in like 20 hours ... 
  devil survivor overclocked . 
  109 hours , and just because i eventually burned out on it . 
  i got it for about 25 pounds . 
  eh , p3p put me off smt for years . 
  i got back into it when the p4 anime was announced i decided to play the game . 
  after i got through nocturne , dds and the devil survivors , i tried my luck with p3fes again and surprise , i actually loved the game . 
  the storytelling style makes a world of difference . 
  probably because there 's no way china could afford the eu/au region prices . 
  we barely do as it is . 
  there 's very little reading text and dialogue , and you can skip them ( although you should watch the cutscenes at least once ) . 
  yes . 
  some people finish the game in like 20-30 hours , others in over 100 because they spent so much time doing non-plot-advancing things . 
  there 's also extra dlc maps , if you get bored of what the game offers . 
  do n't worry , it 's nothing like persona . 
  you can pair two units together , this gives the main unit extra stats ( which is kinda mandatory because otherwise a lot of them are fragile as fuck ) . 
  if you keep pairing up the same two units , they become friends and give better stat boosts . 
  there 's also some short dialogues . 
  it 's not strictly mandatory to complete the game , but you kinda need it to unlock certain characters . 
  well ,, 
  - there 's recruiting all of the characters ( which takes up a huge chunk of the late game when the child units start appearing ) . 
  these are essentially side-quests , but you 'll want to do them ; there are also a lot of dlc sidequests , some going for lighthearted humour , others for difficult bosses . 
  - building all of the supports you want ( some unlikely pairs have interesting conversations ) . 
  there are 40 characters , so you probably wo n't end up doing all of them . 
  - grinding the optimal skills/classes for the characters you want to use . 
  this is the meat of the gameplay , the part you 'll get invested in . 
  because of the number of characters , the possible variations for your avatar and the child units , the variety of classes , the difficulty levels , the possible strategies and approaches , this game is great for multiple replays . 
  some people like doing speed runs/playing for the lowest number of turns , which require optimising your strategy , others take their sweet time and log a huge number of hours on a single play-through . 
  i do n't think anyone actually wants an eu 3ds if they have an na one . 
  you could make the best of it and go all digital with a uk account , or sell it on ebay . 
  i though it was silly , and i was bitter because kingdom hearts 3d was going to be on it instead of a system that could be emulated . 
  ( * that was before i got a job and could afford anything more than cheap trinkets once in a while ), 
  seems like you can pick nano assault , or scribblenauts unlimited for + $ 5, 
  the sun , after a tie-breaker . 
  meh , does n't really fit . 
  i had about 40-45 hours on both games . 
  they were mostly the same length . 
  do n't forget break record and p4dan : d, 
  this is why i like handhelds . 
  there 's just much more opportunity to play , and i 'm not hogging the tv . 
  the jury 's still out on that in the eu . 
  the 3ds is the only console i have right now , and it 's more than worth it . 
  i 've been considering a ps4 as well , but dropped those plans when i found out that it was n't backwards compatible with ps3 games . 
  i did n't enjoy 3d land much . 
  i got it free from the eu promotion this winter . 
  however , ac is n't the type of game you play on long flights . 
  have you considered getting one of the rpgs on the system instead ? 
  rune factory 4 , smtiv , devil survivor overclocked , bravely default and the etrian odyssey games seem more suitable for that sort of thing . 
  i 'd say yes . 
  it really has an awesome story . 
  i recommend 365games . co.uk if you 're outside of the uk , because shipping is cheap across europe . 
  amazon if you 're in the uk though . 
  okay , i admit that my comment was out of place . 
  but really ? 
  not liking a game is `` summer reddit '' ? 
  and do you really have to borrow ** all ** shitty tired 4chan memes ? 
  thanks . 
  i could have worded it better though ... my excuse was that i just woke up and was irritable . 
  spamming one game usually bugs me . 
  saying `` everyone should '' bugs me even more . 
  where did i say they were misleading ? 
  i said `` they did n't look like anything '' , which is clearly just an opinion . 
  and i never said anything about `` promoting '' , i said `` pushing '' . 
  as in spamming the damn thing everywhere . 
  maybe i 'm just a unique snowflake , but nothing kills my interest faster ( and makes me dislike something more ) than seeing it everywhere and people saying everyone should own it . 
  the se store only ships to about 5 countries in europe . 
  out of 50 . 
  yeah , i realised that ... but by the time i did i was already off to work . 
  i just got home , and it 's too late to change it again . 
  it was probably too late by the time i realised it too . 
  the sd card from nintendo was very fast and i never noticed any lag . 
  the `` class 10 '' i bought on the other hand ... 
  i should n't have bought one that was on discount . 
  you guys are so lucky . 
  noe does n't ship outside of the countries with a nintendo ( nevermind that the rewards are progressively worse as you get farther from the uk ) and does n't even have digital game rewards . 
  you have to register ~ 10 consoles or roughly 26 full retail games to get the backpack ( eshop games get less points ) . 
  i 'd rather get the much cheaper physical things and the digital games you guys get * and * the games that are never released here , so ** you ** should n't complain . 
  could you please do final fantasy vii : crisis core and kingdom hearts : birth by sleep ? 
  that would be really awesome . 
  ... maybe they forgot ? 
  i tried , but it 's not `` password '' or `` nis '' :(, 
  i ca n't afford # 69 ; __ ; what the hell, 
  especially if smtiv will be 40 , 50-ish ... 
  shipping not included . 
  fuck shipping is another 20 pounds . 
  i was planning to save some money up until november / december , but 155 $ is just unreasonable .
