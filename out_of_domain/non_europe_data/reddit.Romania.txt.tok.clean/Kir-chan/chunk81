  not that i know of, 
  i spent about 90 hours on my first playthrough of fea , without any real grinding , but without speeding through the story or ignoring the side-stuff . 
  yeah , same . 
  i started in hard mode too . 
  my lunatic playthrough was faster than my hard playthrough - i knew what i was doing , had a small-ish team and only recruited 4 of the kids ( morgan , owain , severa , cynthia ) . 
  i could n't get into bravely default either . 
  you should look into the various atlus games ( shin megami tensei iv , devil survivor or etrian ) . 
  from the ds era , i strongly recommend radiant historia . 
  compared to the demo , the slow levelling of the jobs . 
  you ca n't freely mix and match abilities without investing a ton of time . 
  auto-battle grinding that had just enough varied enemies that you had to re-input all commands every other battle , and with the brave system it was a lot of commands . 
  if you set your encounter rate to low , you would n't get enough exp for the jobs . 
  also , no real incentive to do anything in the story . 
  i liked the characters more in the demo than i did in the actual game . 
  i dropped bravely default , so i do n't know whether it gets any better ... 
  i 'd say just go for stella glow though , and return to bd if you feel up to it someday . 
  i spent about 7 hours on it , did not quite get to 100 % though . 
  it 's not a visual novel , just a really amazing short game with a lot of story . 
  depends on the difficulty , whether this is your first fire emblem , how many kids you recruited , how many characters you used , how often you reset ... 
  romania e la granita ue si suntem varza la categoria aparare . 
  you should play awakening before fates though , because of the references in fates . 
  not really , but if you 're ever going to play it , now 's the time . 
  yes . 
  the device uses more battery trying to stay find and stay connected to a weak signal . 
  this applies to phones too . 
  i had a marriage equality mod for so long in my sims 2 game ( as well as acr and a bunch of other stuff ) that i forgot that was n't in the actual game . 
  why is sapling different from maple ? 
  you side either with the good guys in ~ ~ japan ~ ~ birthright or with the bad guys in ~ ~ mordor ~ ~ conquest . 
  depending on which side you get , there 's a different cast of characters , different stories , different maps . 
  from what everyone says , the bad guys edition is harder and more similar to old fire emblem , but has a worse story . 
  the good guys version is like awakening . 
  there 's a third dlc route where you pick * a different side * again , and play a new story with unique maps with characters from both routes ( iirc ) . 
  if you 're planning to play all of them , white  black  revelations is generally recommended . 
  if they go on sale , it 's usually around black friday and christmas . 
  please understand . 
  i 'd complain though . 
  there 's plenty of ds games that are hard to get and could stand having a digital release . 
  from what i 've heard , it 's because you side with the obviously evil guys without being really evil yourself , so there 's no adequate explanations for why you 're fighting . 
  but , when it comes to characters ( waifus/husbandos ) , nohr dominates the polls . 
  that 's something to consider . 
  good thing we have emulators , because holy shit those games are fantastic . 
  and just browse the sub to see what people recommend very often . 
  fates has 3 characters from awakening . 
  it 's not a direct sequel , or any sort of sequel , and you do n't * need * to have played awakening , but why not ? 
  * turn-based jrpg, 
  * minimal dungeon crawling past the first dungeon ( if you want dungeons , you should look into the etrian games ) . 
  * the difficulty curve is more of a downward slope , it gets way easier as you go along, 
  * mission based , you have to take missions and talk to all npcs to get anywhere ( and to enjoy it ), 
  * 4 endings , each ending is a few hours long, 
  * monster collectathon, 
  * has a sequel coming out in 2016, 
  * story is somewhat minimal , but still pretty great - it hooks you and carries the game, 
  * characterisation is mostly absent, 
  * has the best atmosphere of these games, 
  * can get * very * disturbing, 
  * you * will * get lost and guides wo n't help, 
  * the graphics are great : your character is detailed , adult-sized and runs around in a fleshed out , detailed and realistic-looking world, 
  * the music is nice too, 
  * has dlc for small bits of extra story , extra bosses , extra outfits and exp/money stuff, 
  * if you 're in the us , it goes on sale often, 
  shin megami tensei : devil survivor, 
  * fusion of srpg and turn-based battles, 
  * this game can get * hard * and there are difficulty spikes . 
  * there are like ... 7 or 8 endings . 
  5 ending routes , 3 of them have an extra day with a lot of hours of content . 
  the game lets you follow your own moral compass . 
  * high replayability : it 's impossible to do everything in a single playthrough , so each subsequent replay stays fresh, 
  * monster collectathon, 
  * has the best story of any 3ds game so far, 
  * it excels when it comes to atmosphere , themes and characters, 
  * it 's thematically very deep , exploring survival , desperation and religion from several view-points, 
  * the graphics are ds tier and it only uses the bottom screen most of the time, 
  * no online features at all, 
  * but because of these two points , the battery lasts * forever * - you can get like 10 + hours of playtime out of one session, 
  * music is so-so, 
  * if you 're in the us , it goes on sale often, 
  shin megami tensei : devil survivor 2, 
  * fusion of srpg and turn-based battles, 
  * this game can also get pretty hard . 
  if you go for one of daichi 's routes on your first playthrough , may god have mercy on your soul . 
  * about 5 endings , and there 's a second separate scenario too, 
  * high replayability : it 's impossible to do everything in a single playthrough , so each subsequent replay stays fresh, 
  * the gameplay is better than in the first desu, 
  * monster collectathon, 
  * has the best characters in this group of games, 
  * it has a character support system that gives you bonuses in battle, 
  * its story is very good , but do n't play it right after the first devil survivor ( which utterly eclipses it in this department ), 
  * does n't actually directly touch religion ( despite being an smt game ), 
  * despite the dark themes , the game stays pretty cheerful, 
  * the graphics are ds tier and it only uses the bottom screen most of the time, 
  * great battery life because of this, 
  * the game uses spotpass , but i do n't know whether it 's used in the west, 
  * the music is really nice ; look up the original ds opening for a really catchy tune, 
  * if you 're in the us , it goes on sale often, 
  * tie-ins : has a mediocre anime, 
  * srpg, 
  * the franchise has a new game coming out in early 2016 , playing awakening is recommended but not mandatory, 
  * has the most replayability of these games , and arguably the best gameplay, 
  * there are like 40 characters you can use, 
  * it has a character support system that gives you bonuses in battle,
