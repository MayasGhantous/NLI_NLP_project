  * you can pair two characters and they can have * children *, 
  * the story is sort of weak , but functional, 
  * nintendo game , so it goes very rarely on sale, 
  * good graphics with nice 3d , but it hardly matters in a game like this, 
  * nice music, 
  * has spotpass , streetpass and dlc for extra maps , extra story , some fanservice and exp/money/abilities, 
  * tie-ins : there are amiibos , characters in smash , general nintendo marketing , lucina and chrome are going to be in project x zone 2 , references in the upcoming #fe, 
  bravely default, 
  * turn-based jrpg , occasional dungeon crawling, 
  * levelling takes * forever *, 
  * single ending, 
  * it has a sequel coming out in 2016, 
  * it looks and sounds amazing , has the best production values of these games, 
  * downside though , it uses chibi sized characters, 
  * the story is pretty bad, 
  * the characters are boring as well, 
  * the music is composed by the guy who did the opening to shingeki no kyojin, 
  * no dlc except for one very optional potion, 
  * uses spotpass, 
  * tie-ins : has dlc songs in theathrythm, 
  yokai watch, 
  i have n't actually played this . 
  * i think the battles were active-time , where your monsters fight and you 're on healing/support duty, 
  * monster collectathon, 
  * the sequels will be coming out too at some point, 
  * the most kid friendly of the bunch, 
  * a lot more light-hearted than most of the games in this list, 
  not exactly similar , but still the best turn-based jrpg on the device . 
  pokemon picross or what it 's called is pretty fun . 
  most of them . 
  what kind of jrpg are you looking for ? 
  more/less exploration ? 
  story/characters ? 
  graphics/music ? 
  something relaxing/exciting ? 
  something you can take breaks from ? 
  if you just want a generic list of good jrpgs , there 's the recommendations in the sidebar . 
  terraria is n't even out yet . 
  let 's hold off on condemning it ( for anything other than the price ) until we 've played it . 
  do you have things you could n't stand losing ? 
  like purchases and save files . 
  yes , but play sos first . 
  rf4 is more exciting . 
  eh , personally i never cared about online play, 
  is having to re-add them worth the price mark up and bad availability ? 
  in you place , i 'd create a new nnid in ireland without a second thought . 
  you play fire emblem for the gameplay , not the plot - try the demo in any case . 
  well , it does * have * a plot , and it 's not a bad one either , it 's just nothing that will blow you away . 
  you should look into 999/virtue 's last reward and devil survivor overclocked . 
  i already could n't finish bd because of the shallow plot and uninteresting characters ( imho of course ) . 
  not for me then . 
  sort of bad , because i really loved the demo for bd . 
  they did n't include story of seasons or project mirai , but included two puzzle platformers and triforce heroes . 
  the first time i played the devil survivors on an emulator , i did n't even realise the bottom screen was clickable . 
  so yeah , the touchscreen is optional . 
  story of seasons , devil survivor 2 , project mirai , terraria , etrian odyssey untold 2 , stella glow , legend of legacy , pokemon mystery dungeon , majora 's mask , binding of isaac ... 
  if we include eshop stuff , pokemon picross/shuffle , fairune , mercenary saga 2 ... 
  i loved the demo ( i had like 13 hours in it ) , but did n't like the full game . 
  making a new theme = / = cheating someone out of money . 
  i 'm not paying 2 hours worth of pay for a wallpaper i do n't even like just for variety , when they 're not releasing the ones i do want anyway ( where are all the smt or fire emblem themes ? 
  i 've never seen a 3ds game released by nisa go on sale , ever . 
  well , 1 # / h , since i 'm stuck on the uk eshop . 
  more like 1.50 i guess , i was exaggerating a little . 
  i 'm hoping it 's a gaming laptop . 
  like a ps4 with an in-built screen , that you can also normally connect to a tv . 
  so , who else preffered the original ds translation for devil survivor 2 ? 
  i finally managed to get it and i 'm really cringing at some translation choices . 
  the game has 5 ending routes with a total of 7 or 8 individual endings . 
  3 of the routes have * hours * of unique extra content and story . 
  the game itself is very replayable . 
  it has a time system where you choose which events to view / pursue , and your decisions shape the ending you get - my favorite playthrough was the one where i played as a normal guy who did * not * want to risk his neck - it really opened some unique events . 
  either way , it 's impossible to view all events in a single playthrough , so the second one stays fresh as well . 
  because you also have ng + bonuses , subsequent playthroughs are all * fast * . 
  i 've sunk over 100 hours into this game , and another 30 or so into the ds version . 
  the story is also * fantastic * . 
  if it were n't for virtue 's last reward being the best thing ever , devil survivor would hands down have the best story of any game on the device . 
  so yes . 
  very warmly recommended . 
  try asking around in physical stores , you might have more luck . 
  devil survivor 2 break record, 
  rune factory 4, 
  theatrythm, 
  * almost 300 songs before dlc, 
  * dlc songs from bravely default , twewy , nier , chrono trigger, 
  * rpg-like stats and abilities and items, 
  * lots of achievements and stuff to collect, 
  * lots of instrumental songs and the songs are pretty awesome even if you have n't played it, 
  * generally easier, 
  * about 50 songs, 
  * vocaloid . 
  might be off-putting if you 're not used to them . 
  * some dating sim elements, 
  * costumes !, 
  * generally harder, 
  fire emblem 's storyline is so-so and it has boatloads of replay value . 
  virtue 's last reward is pretty much what you 're describing though . 
  club nintendo closing, 
  it was a pretty huge thing earlier this year . 
  when you play vlr , remember not to save in puzzle rooms . 
  there 's a save corrupting bug , but it 's easy to avoid if you know about it .
