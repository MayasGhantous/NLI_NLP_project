yes we do . 
  but , like some of the women ( hey everybody is different right ? 
  ) , some will show the full spectrum of emotions while other will keep their chin up ( or maybe just repeating every second `` man up man , man up '' ) . 
  some of them , as some other redditors said , engage in self-destructing behavior while other go on the creative path . 
  so to answer your question , yeah , we do . 
  but in some form or another we tend to do those things in private . 
  i 'm pretty sure there 's an equation for that exact catobird graph !, 
  installing a remote mysql server ( 15mins ) for $ 50 . 
  i could say that the experience was a real eye opener for him . 
  this might [ help ] ( http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/project_ideas.shtml ), 
  having to shave the damn beard everyday for work ( although my shaving habbits are , oh , so erratic since for now i work @ home ) . 
  probably invest them right away so that later i could buy a house . 
  ummm , this is a tricky question . 
  i would say the answer depends on each situation . 
  as other fellow redditors already mentioned , some methods would be to get busy , fall for another girl or just socialize . 
  i would add a 4th one : do n't get `` over '' - but get yourself better . 
  since it was an experience , value it as such . 
  sure , do n't get stuck in the past , that 's not healthy . 
  but do n't `` erase '' or just `` cut '' ties ( emotionally speaking since not everytime you 'll end up as friends ) . 
  the more you think about `` omg , i need to get over and forget '' , the most likely you 'll end up more hurt . 
  just focus on yourself and life will be good . 
  it does , but you need 4 eyes to see it , 2 hearts to feel it and a lil ' thing called faith . 
  while getting the fuck away from that fucking person . 
  i will find you ... and i will read you ... 
  oh , the excitement !, 
  `` wow , so here hides 90 % of the internet population ... aaaand on facebook '' . 
  her eyes . 
  it had to be her eyes . 
  any of the big it company or , after a careful examination a start-up . 
  do n't go mutual or stuff like that . 
  just do n't . 
  ofc , do some [ research first ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/feeonlyplanner/2013/04/24/5-ways-to-invest-your-money/ ) . 
  as a programmer/webdesigner , i hate it when i 'm contracted to do a `` simple website '' that should take 1-2 days and then , ( due mostly to additions/last minute alterations requested by the client ) , the entire job takes twice the time at the same price . 
  a sinclair spectrum 1986 computer that actually works . 
  `` any chance of raining these days ? '', 
  have you killed anything as a child ? 
  did you enjoy it ? 
  lots of growling and . . tail movement . 
  `` i 'm outta here ! '', 
  i would vote for jack the ripper . 
  preferred to re install windows instead of searching the drivers online ( when upgrading from 7 to 8 ) since w8 got the right drivers anyway . 
  in an ideal world the capitalism would work perfectly if it would be applied per se . 
  but given the fact that most `` capitalist '' countries got their governments involved , one ca n't say that right in this moment any country has true capitalism ( mind you that `` true '' capitalism has a basic idea of everyone for himself , mainly no type of social aid or services ) . 
  so the answer is : no , it would not work for a society , but would be great for an individual . 
  but since any individual is a cell of a given society some compromises had to be done - so we now ( mostly , the exception are the communist countries and some other select type of governments ) have some sort of mixed type of economies that try to help both the individual and the society as a whole . 
  i would say fast food , 
  because those are served from different servers ( that usually deliver static content ) . 
  also the commands for displaying them ( aka the scripts ) are in the beginning part of most sites ( [ head ] ( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/html/element/head ) ) . 
  about the data cap : it all depends on the ad type . 
  usually a static ad would not take more then a few [ kilobytes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kilobyte ) , but since most pages contain multiple ads , this could sum up to quite a data volume that , in case of static website , with no video/audio content , could surpass the actual `` useful '' content . 
  edit : you could of course always use an [ ad blocker ] ( https://adblockplus.org ) . 
  do n't hurry , we 'll also wait for the pics ... 
  why do we have to wear clothes in summer ... 
  i agree , we need a new app . 
  one that mashes all of the social sites and looks for users that have n't logged on for over 48h ... or 10 min , 
  probably `` meeeoowww there kitty ... '', 
  seriously , i hope you do n't expect me to answer to that . . 
  do n't treat them using adult logic , but try to use your empathy mostly . 
  do n't enforce things on them . 
  do n't over spoil them . 
  care about his/her psychological development . 
  pick one . 
  pretty much anything computer related . 
  and pooping . 
  eagle 's nest on sinclair spectrum and commodore 64, 
  `` do i have enough ? 
  do i have my wallet with me ? 
  what if my card gets denied ? 
  damn , i forgot to cut my nails ... '', 
  a . iso file containing all my ( and my family ) pictures from the last few years . 
  they need it . 
  to live it . 
  no use in having one if you feel dead . 
  well you 've taken the first step : admitting . 
  no small feat . 
  now you need to learn to listen first of all . 
  then compare your believes vs what you just heard in a distant matter . 
  do n't draw any conclusion yet . 
  take a few breaths and try hard , really hard to assume the other 's point of view for a second . 
  now you may have a different perspective over the matter . 
  remember , nobody knows it all . 
  and yeah , meditation in those `` me times '' helps a lot . 
  good luck !, 
  if you just want to use `` one easy trick '' so that you 'll not be an asshole anymore , it kind of defeat the purpose . 
  you 'll still be one , but with a mask , 
  working on my computer or waiting/talking for/to somebody . 
  and after sex of course , 
  nothing is permanent in life and we have all the time ( well , until we die that is ) to improve ourself , just like you are right now . 
  i wish you good luck my friend , 
  what is the [ unixtime ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unix_time ) of your birthday ? 
  i guess the answer could also be a negative number . 
  `` still a better love story than jewlight ... '', 
  on 26/12 i can probably give you a year 's worth of socks np . 
  i would document the 1st hour after the comet that killed the dinosaurs fell in collision with the earth ( one full hour of mayhem uhuuuu ) . 
  then sell it to bbc , 
  download and print all the articles that contain `` how to do '' stuff . 
  then archive them in a glossary called `` mygoogle 2.0 : paper edition '' . 
  man , it was like in a horror movie !, 
  socks kept raining from everywhere . 
  i was running for my life , could n't care less who they were from !,
