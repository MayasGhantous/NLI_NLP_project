  hi all ,, 
  next week i 'm going to arrive to palermo ( work and pleasure ) and will stay for about 2 weeks . 
  i already have some sights in mind for me to see but i 'd like to get one or more other worthy sights for me to visit ( as this is going to be my first and last visit i 'd like to make sure that i do n't miss something important and/or interesting ) . 
  my list contains so far the following :, 
  * cathedral of palermomonte pellegrino, 
  * triumph of death fresco, 
  thank you . 
  remain as you are , beautifull . 
  i 'm working with quite a few freelancers . 
  this is a message a got some time ago :, 
  * hi there ( ** me ** ) !, 
  ** freelancer ** is in hospital now , he/she had a mild heart attack a few days ago . 
  i 've talked to him/her yesterday and he/she told me about his frl account - the archive is at www . 
  **private**.org ( he/she was pretty sure he/she warned you about his/her heart problems before and , from what i 've gathered , you 've been a real friend about it , and for that i thank you ) . 
  he asked me to help you in any way i can ( coding related as i am a coder also ) . 
  other that that he sends you his best wishes and all the health in the world . . 
  so , if you need anything coded and i can help you , just tell me . 
  i can do at least that for our friend . 
  anyway from what i gathered he liked you very much and also he had big plans to do with you coding related . 
  so , i just hope that he 'll get back on his feet and well . 
  would n't be his first heart problems - he had more than enough for his young age . 
  but he 's a great coder , trust me . 
  i just hope that , within the next days , the doctors will give him a clean bill , at least until he puts his biz in order . 
  anyway , if you need anything , just tell me . 
  i have strict orders to do anything you need without any money as a token of his apreciation , so , you know , go ahead . 
  this message got my entire world upside-down . 
  at first , i thought of it as `` wow !, 
  this person really likes his job and wants to make sure that is done to the end '' . 
  but , after some reflection time i got it !, 
  it was n't about the job being done . 
  it was about him/her , and his love regarding about what he/she was doing . 
  i wo n't say who he/she is , but i 'm pretty sure that on freelancer ( for the last 4 years from what i gathered , he/she was quite the good guy/girl ) that reputation was well beyond 95 % - i only worked on fl in the last 2 years , but i had the honor to work with him/her ) . 
  well . 
  that 's the story . 
  about a person that loved his/her job so much that insisted to give a message while in a hospital to somebody that he / she could n't complete it but offered sollutions . 
  i managed to complete the project after all , but wanted to thank you wild coder . 
  be well , wherever you are .

  hi all ,, 
  a bit about me first . 
  i 've been drinking since i was 17 ( 18 years ago , oh god ) . 
  to be honest , while i was drinking , i felt no guilt whatsoever . 
  it felt good . 
  it felt like all my problems are gone , it felt like that moment was the one i 've been waiting my entire day . 
  yeah , i was drunk pretty much each day ( or evening if you may ) .
