  * -- pablo neruda , twenty love poems and a song of despair *, 
  how would that work ? 
  indeed my pdfs are in english ( as i do n't speak spanish ) . 
  but it does sound more . . dunno . . deep and personal when i try to read it out loud - in spanish i mean - ( latin language family speaker here - romanian ) . 
  i clicked on / r/ooer and instantly i was in css designer 's hell . 
  i mean i really do think that 's how the hell looks for a webdesigner . 
  now imagine your boss asks you to fix that . 
  i also smiled and felt somehow happy for you after i read this . 
  be sure to be there whenever he wants to smile but also when he needs to cry . 
  ** league of legends **, 
  * you 've spent about 3.492 hours on league of legends which means 146 days of your life . 
  you are 4.881 th on eune servers and 54.320 th in the world . 
  the main storyline does , then it begins to generate new sidequests . 
  i 'm cured !, 
  i can see !!!, 
  a good old tripe soup . 
  i 'll probably use it for irc ( instead of social websites ) , open some forums ( and while loading make something to eat ) , and playing doom or quake in the evening with 1 or 2 friends . 
  after that i would browse the news or something . 
  that should sum about 7-8 hours so , yeah , that should be the most i could probably do without going insane . 
  for the irc part i could probably use the 9.6 kbits/s dialup ( v. 32 ) but for gaming we would need a v. 90 at least ( 33.6 kbits/s ) . 
  mind you that the v. 44 andv .92 also included hardware compression that was pretty good in fact rising the data as high as 320 kbits/s . 
  so if for 8 hours i would browse the internet using a 320 kbits/s dial up modem ( using hardware compression as 99.9 of the modems have it ) , i 'd download somewhere near 40kb x 3600 seconds x 8 hours = 1152000 kb = 1.125 mb, 
  not so bad really if i 'm really stuck with it for a day ( excluding any errors ofc ) . 
  ** fold again . 
  fold again . 
  cha cha now , y\u2019 all . ** . 
  time to find some shit to ** boom !, 
  ** and wrap ... 
  it sounds more like your girlnemy than your girlfriend . 
  so , yeah , do it . 
  hell , it 's about time .

  a bullet in his head on the other hand ... 
  when i got my first paycheck .

  i went with `` dinosaurs '' and somehow ended up learning about ( really interesting ) other topics culminating with :, 
   pacemakers are also used in horse racing , where mediocre, 
   horses may be entered into major races specifically to set, 
   the pace for superior horses from the same stable .

  i 'm using it to find out what are the latest trends in trolling . 
  any week day : wake up @ ~ 6:30 , shower and all that stuff , coffee , a bit of running or some sort of exercise if it 's nasty outside , check the mail , do some coding , lunch break , back @ coding until 17-19pm depending on how much work i have , getting out and visiting anything new ( moved to another country a few months ago ) , going to a bar with some friends , back home , checking the mail , eating , some movies , sleep . 
  nothing interesting here . 
  paper money . 
  hahaaa now i keep imagine a 1h length conversation : `` hi ! '', 
  ( moves a bit ) - `` oh hi ! '', 
  ( moves a bit more ) - `` hi there shy one . . '' says the friend over her so 's shoulder ... 
  that guy played it cool . 
  like the definition of cool . 
  to be honest , if i did n't already have an almost equivalent job i 'd probably submit to it . 
  that was the most sincere job offer in that field .
