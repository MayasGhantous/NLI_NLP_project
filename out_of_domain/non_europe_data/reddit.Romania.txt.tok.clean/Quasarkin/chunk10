  it is called ` retrograde rotation ' . 
  venus 's orbit is an almost perfect circle . 
  it has an eccentricity of < 0.01 . 
  earth is infected with humans . 
  highly contagious . 
  the moon is the largest satellite relative to the size of its planet . 
  a quarter of the diameter of earth . 
  the moon is 400 times smaller in diameter than the sun , but also 400 times closer to earth . 
  thus solar eclipses . 
  the moon is in synchronous rotation with earth . 
  we 've never seen the other half of the moon with the naked eye . 
  ** edit ** : . . from earth . 
  thanks guys , like it was n't obvious enough . 
  mars has the largest volcano in the solar system . 
  it stands at around 27 kilometers high with a crater of 81 kilometers wide . 
  a day on jupiter only lasts 9 hours and 55 minutes . 
  it spins really fast . 
  the red spot of jupiter is three times the size of earth . 
  it is the most violent storm in the known universe . 
  the rings around saturn could be caused by a moon shattered by saturn 's gravity . 
  saturn is also the lightest ( density ) planet in our solar system . 
  ** edit : ** sorry , density not weight . 
  if placed in water , saturn would float . 
  being overly used as it is , uranus has an axial tilt of 97 degrees . 
  the north and south is where , on every other planet in our system , east and west are . 
  uranus is a hipster and as such he also moves in ` retrograde rotation ' . 
  since its discovery in 1846 , neptune has not made a complete rotation around the sun . 
  ** edit ** : as pointed out by gangsteroctopus , neptune has completed its first rotation since its discovery on june 11 , 2011 . 
  - go upvote him . 
  like jupiter , neptune also has a dark spot caused by a storm , roughly the size of earth . 
  if gas giants did not lack size they would most likely be stars . 
  size seems to be an empirical variable in the universe . 
  ** edit ** : as pointed out by trinexx86 : `` if gas giants did not lack density directly , mass indirectly . 
  neutron stars are incredibly small ( smaller than any planet in our system ) , but pack a massive punch in the density department . 
  pun intended . 
  size usually refers to volume , and you could spark up a star with the volume of jupiter or saturn with some difficulty . 
  clarification : central density . 
  if you 're looking at mean density , jupiter and the sun are remarkably close to each other . 
  look at the sun 's central density and you 'll see just how much disparity there is between the two . '',

  pluto 's orbit sometimes brings it closer to the sun , making neptune the furthest away planet in our solar system . 
  it went ahead of neptune on september 5 , 1989 and remained there until february of 1999 , when it was still a planet . 
  we only really know 777 extrasolar planets as well as 2321 unconfirmed extrasolar planets . 
  almost all of them are gas giants like jupiter . 
  but if it makes you feel any better , our solar system can boast intelligent life . 
  most of the time . 
  pluto orbits ` above ' neptune . 
  you have to imagine it in 3d . 
  short answer ? 
  no they will never collide . 
  i save before every game . 
  i hate replaying the same game twice . 
  it feels unreal . 
  i never reload because of poor performance . 
  oh i remember . 
  right ? 
  please tell me i 'm right . 
  there 's no such thing as a stupid question . 
  in any case , the red spot itself is not permanent . 
  we just do n't know how long it will last , and it 's not the only such spot on jupiter . 
  there are many although considerably smaller . 
  scientists assume the spot will last somewhere between 180 years and 350 years . 
  i read somewhere that it has lost some of its size during the years since its initial observation . 
  and of course [ it 's moving ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/790106-0203_voyager_58m_to_31m_reduced.gif ) . 
  for example , neptune also has a spot called the great dark spot . 
  but it lasts for a considerably shorter period of time . 
  the first such spot was observed in 1989 . 
  however , when they wanted to observe the spot again , in 1994 , the spot had disappeared . 
  a new great dark spot has since appeared in the northern hemisphere of the planet . 
  well fuck . 
  i 've been a redditor for quite a while now but this is the first time that i get actual evidence that people do shit like this for karma . 
  amazing what a number can do to some . 
  meh , maybe it 's just me but i have a feeling this is an obscure reference to `` kids from room 402 '' . 
  be original , they said . 
  you know , sometimes they talk too much . 
  good thing i do n't listen to them .

  after initial analysis on fyradiem 's comment , from the way the sentences are constructed to just because probydoby says so , our tests have pointed out to a comment full of irony as well as subtle inclusion of the secret location of the badass unicorns . 
  however , after further analysis in the bowls of soup , we here at \u0ca0_\u0ca0 and co. have reached the conclusion that , due to the fact that the post was written in all caps motherfuckers , fyradiem did not mean his post to be ironic , and neither does it point out to the location of the badass unicorns . 
  that was a red herring on his part . 
  we were dissapoint too . 
  you can tell we here at \u0ca0_\u0ca0 and co. are always right because we say so . 
  mumford & the sons - after the storm, 
  i wo n't shave my balls for a month if we win . 
  i 'm gon na go shave my balls now . 
  just in case . 
  i like getting my balls sucked . 
  a month without that ? 
  gk and fitness coaches train your players much better in the goalkeeping and fitness department than a regular coach would . 
  i ca n't say the same for first team/youth coaches but i generally have a couple of coaches taking care solely of the youth team . 
  their best player is vincent kompany . 
  you guys are mad . 
  people are failing to explain it to you using examples . 
  i 'll try my best :,
