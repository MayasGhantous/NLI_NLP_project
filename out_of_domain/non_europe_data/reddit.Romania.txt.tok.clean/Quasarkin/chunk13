  it 's sad to see him prefer to be a bench warmer instead of transferring to a decent club in a decent league and see his career out in style . 
  he 's still got 3 or 4 years in him ; i really doubt dimatteo will ever let him play for chelsea again ; maybe the league cup , maybe . 
  gustavo fring may have also gotten his name this way . 
  in season 1 , walter tells jesse a story about the gustav guns , 2 massive german world war ii railway siege guns . 
  it 's one of those references that i never see floating around in this sub-reddit or anywhere else for that matter . 
  he scores when he wants ; except against chelsea . 
  sheffield wednesday , clearly . 
  where the fuck is back to the future ? 
  i have only seen her in game of thrones but i do n't find her particularly attractive . 
  i do n't know why . 
  am i really the only one ? 
  i have reasons to believe that i too am from romania ; but the point i 'm trying to make is that this is [ not fake ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saaeriyhjgk ) . 
  get your tinfoil hats on before it 's too late !, 
  the dark knight . 
  from a popularity point of view as well as the fact that it 's well directed , well written and it features an amazing cast that plays tremendously , this is by far the best movie of the last decade . 
  it has pretty much everything for pretty much everyone ; and in case i 'm leaving it unclear , no it 's not my favorite movie . 
  my favorite movie of the last decade would be donnie darko . 
  go to options  video settings , set the 1st option to 1.6 ( they chose an interesting number for the lowest value ) and then set the 2nd option to television . 
  became a chelsea fan during the ranieri days , shortly before the abramovich takeover , when adrian mutu ( our national team best player in the last decade ) transferred to us . 
  i fell in love with frank lampard instead . 
  that and i also dislike the football displayed in romania ( except during the european runs ) . 
  wtf is this shit ? 
  once they get rid of the usual football manager applications , they can proceed with the view of appointing someone with real-life experience . 
  still weeping the fact that mikel could have scored his first official goal today for us . 
  other teams do that because they are required by law , otherwise they would n't do it either ; and by other teams i mean la liga teams . 
  well if it makes you feel any better , if you know how to tweak your settings accordingly , chelsea are overpowered in fifa 11 ( even better than real madrid ) . 
  my team was something like : sturridge lb , cole/kalou cbs , luiz rb , ramires dmc , lampard/anelka cms , torres aml , mata amr and drogba st. 
  almost no one ever uses crosses into the 6 yard box so the fact that the defense is filled with short players was n't a problem . 
  what was a key factor here is that every player in the team had 85 + acceleration ( except i think david luiz ) . 
  i always directed corners to didier drogba . 
  during play , depending on space available i would always attempt finesse shots with the wingers or a powerful shot with lampard . 
  other key factors included playing with an offensive high-pressure tactic with most crosses happening over the opponent 's team and an anticipatory game played at the back . 
  this tactic has guaranteed me win after win after win . 
  i rarely ever lost with it and if i did , it was at best by a couple of goals . 
  first time betting , i placed 3x 1 $ bets . 
  i lost 2 of the bets because of leeds - everton . 
  the 3rd one is to get the 3 $ back which i have yet to win , due on 2nd of october . 
  tomorrow i 'll place 3 more 1 $ bets , the first one to safely return back my 3 $ again and the other 2 using a `` 3 easy games + 1 hard game '' combo . 
  i 'm betting on a draw in milan - cagliari on the first one and on a draw in napoli - lazio on the second one , each giving me a return of 5 $ . 
  i know it 's not a lot , i 'm mostly using these types of sums to just learn the basics of betting and how to cover for my spending over a short period of time . 
  : we should have `` daily picks '' threads one day in advance so we can discuss games in more detail . 
  `` daily picks '' threads are currently done on the same day as the matches ( and quite late too , usually in the afternoon ) and it does n't really allow the community to speak their minds up . 
  there are 3 games in the romanian cup that look a lot like sure winners :, 
  acs berceni [ 17.0 ] - ** cfr cluj ** [ 1.12 ]  winners of 2011/12 liga i season , beat braga away in the 1st matchday of the 2012/13 champions league season . 
  ** vaslui ** [ 1.12 ] - fc botosani [ 17.0 ]  runner-ups of 2011/12 liga i season , made inter tremble on san siro in the play-off round of 2012/13 europa league season , game ended 2-2 after a sumblime finish by inter in the ending seconds of the 2nd half . 
  jiu ** [ 1.12 ] - fc zaigon [ 17.0 ]  current leaders tied with steaua bucharest in the 2012/13 liga i season , 6w 1d 1l . 
  they have been looking particularly good , a big improvement over their last season . 
  * this should increase your total winnings by quite a bit , if my calculations are corect , by 35 % .

  * if you 're planning on betting on 3 easy games and a ` what the fuck is happening ' game , this is the way to do it . 
  very similar . 
  both teams are doing well in their top-flight matches , losing horribly against 2nd division mid-table teams . 
  both everton and vaslui were tipped real contenders to the cup and both teams decided that it was the time they rested key players despite their next game being relatively easy . 
  i 'm a bit bitter , half of my bets today included these 3 games , to raise my total winnings . 
  i doubt anyone expected a win for the away team .

  the nard dog calls him plop and in fact he 's the only one to still use that nickname . 
  if i recall , he came up with it too . 
  who else has received a nickname from andy ? 
  maybe pete is the new jim . 
  this needs more than a couple of answers . 
  first time i hear there is hate for dimatteo . 
  you pretty much summed up all of our problems . 
  not a lot of problems , mind you , but it can still bite us in the ass every once in a while . 
  i 'm going to be cheering for a draw . 
  this is all great and everything but what i 'm really looking for is the david luiz mistake that could have cost us the game had cech not been . . well . . cech . 
  is it wrong that i 'm rooting for tottenham ? 
  it probably is but fuck manchester united . 
  laughed my ass off at `` goalkeeper-language '' . 
  steaua bucuresti are currently the leaders of liga i , tied with pandurii targu jiu : 7w 1d 1l , 22p . 
  they are currently tied with dinamo bucuresti for best defense , conceding 9 goals in 9 matches . 
  they also have the 2nd best attack in the league , missing out by just 1 goal , scoring 21 goals in 9 matches . 
  their only defeat this season so far has come from vaslui , away , the runner-up of liga i in the previous season . 
  it 's also worth mentioning that steaua bucuresti has won both matches against petrolul ploiesti last season , an aggregate score of 5-1 . 
  steaua bucuresti have consistently scored 2 goals per game this season against weaker teams . 
  the only big exception was the first game of the season , won 1-0 . 
  petrolul ploiesti are currently a mid-table team , 3w 4d 2d , 13p . 
  they are currently overachieving and all of their home games but one has resulted in wins , albeit against weak teams . 
  the exception has been against steaua bucuresti rivals , rapid bucuresti , drawing 0-0 . 
  however , rapid bucuresti are currently underachieving . 
  petrolul ploiesti have not drawn or won any away games so far . 
  they have scored 17 and conceded 11 goals this season . 
  now that you , hopefully , understand why the odds are so high for this game , stake it on steaua bucuresti without a worry . 
  this has ` win for steaua bucuresti ' drawn all over it . 
  i 'm still pondering over this bet : http://i50.tinypic.com/dnkbp0.png, 
  for those that care , that 's roughly 1 euro winning me 126 euros . 
  i should note that the timetable is gmt +3 . 
  i have 3 hours left to decide if i want to bet on it . 
  what do you guys think ? 
  ** as per usual , never bet on a monday . 
  . . and i suggest we do the 2/10/2012 daily picks thread a few hours earlier than usual today , to discuss the champions league in greater detail ; in fact we should probably have the 2/10/2012 and 3/10/2012 daily picks threads combined , to offer a wider range of matches in the champions league as well as the lower leagues of england . 
  ** do not bet on cfr cluj - manchester united !, 
  cfr cluj have reached the champions league group stages by defeating slovan liberec both at home and away ( 3-1 on agg . ), 
  in the third qualifying round . 
  they then defeated basel both at home and away ( 3-1 on agg . 
  again ) in the play-off round .
