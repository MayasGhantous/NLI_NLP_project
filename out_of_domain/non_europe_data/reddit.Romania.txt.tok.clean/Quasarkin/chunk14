  in the group stages they have so far played braga , away , winning 2-0 and i have a funny feeling they are going to draw 1-1 at home . 
  i called it first !, 
  cfr cluj has achieved quite a bit since the summer of 2005 : they were runner-ups in the last uefa intertoto cup , including key wins against the then athletic bilbao ( 1-1 on agg. , won on penalties ) , as saint-etienne ( 3-3 on agg. , won on away goals ) , and a 1-1 draw against rc lens in the 1st leg of the finals . 
  in the 2007/08 season , cfr cluj was the first team from outside the capital to win the romanian liga i in nearly two decades . 
  by winning the league , they qualified for the group stages of the 2008/09 champions league . 
  in their opening game they defeated as roma , away , winning 2-1 . 
  in the next match they held chelsea to a goalless draw . 
  they have since won the romanian cup 3 consecutive times , lost on penalties on their fourth one and also managed to win the league 2 more times . 
  i do n't really think i need to talk about manchester united , i 've written a lot as it is , everyone knows that united 's form in the champions league last season was terrible and they were , if i may say so , quite poor against galatasaray last month ; they played on old trafford too . 
  oh and i almost forgot about the defeat against tottenham . 
  my prediction is a goalless draw but i do n't recommend that anyone bet on this game , particularly on manchester united , due to very poor odds despite cfr cluj actually winning all of their champions league games this season so far . 
  ** edit : for fucks sake , i said ` do n't bet on it ' , not ` bet on a draw ' . 
  in hindsight , i also bet on a draw . 
  statistically speaking , bate borisov wo n't win ( or to a lesser degree , even draw ) against bayern munich . 
  i just came home , too weary to give you a full detail about the game . 
  i might do a decently detailed post about my bet that includes the bate borisov - bayern munich game with a convinced win for the away team . 
  note the might . 
   ** -- sure winners !, 
  hey everyone , sure winners !, 
  ** anzhi makhachkala [ 1.30 ] ** - young boys [ 8.05 ] [ draw : 5.10 ], 
  playing at home , anzhi will be looking for blood following the draw with udinesse in the first matchday of europa league . 
  they have n't lost a game since 23rd of august . 
  on the other side of the field , young boys have been particularly poor in their league , currently 5th placed ( out of 10 ) , 9 points behind and they have little hope , considering they 're traveling all the way to mother russia . 
  ** atletico madrid [ 1.20 ] ** - viktoria plzen [ 11.0 ] [ draw : 5.90 ], 
  playing at home , i expect atletico madrid to trash viktoria plzen . 
  madrid are currently 2nd placed in la liga , just 2 points behind barcelona . 
  their last lost match was at home , against real madrid , a 1-4 trashing , all the way on 14th of april . 
  also worth noting that viktoria plzen have n't won any away games last season in both the champions league as well as the europa league . 
  marseille are clearly unhappy with how their previous season went , finishing 10th , w12 d12 l14 . 
  they qualified to the europa league via the 2011-12 coupe de la ligue . 
  that aside , they have vastly improved their form this season , p7 w6 d0 l1 . 
  they lost their only game this season 5 days ago , an away 4-1 trashing . 
  not much i know about ael limassol except their current form and league position ; this is also their first season in over a decade in a continental tournament . 
  i just do n't see them winning this one . 
  hopefully , marseille are back to their winning ways . 
   ** -- there are hard games to predict tonight !, 
  liverpool [ 1.55 ] - udinese [ 5.60 ] ** [ draw : 3.70 ] **, 
  albeit liverpool have been performing better ever since the arrival of brendan rodgers , they seem to constantly run out of luck ( e.g. 
  west bromwich albion , manchester city , manchester united ) . 
  their form has somewhat improved over the last couple of weeks , but considering they were games played against young boys and norwich ( both being away games ) , you really ca n't draw a conclusion ( heh , draw ) about how this game is going to go for liverpool , p6 1w 2d 3l . 
  their defense have pretty much screwed them in every game . 
  even young boys scored 3 against them , while norwich scored 2 . 
  on the other side of the game , their opponents , udinese , are n't doing much better either ; p6 1w 3d 2l . 
  they won 2-1 at home against a struggling ac milan but they drew 1-1 at home against anzhi makhachkala . 
  if i were to bet on this match , i 'd say both teams will try to play a safe game , defending their point . 
  liverpool may attempt something more due to playing at home but i 'm expecting a ton of wasted chances and a goalless draw . 
  i do n't know much and ca n't find a lot about these two teams . 
  perhaps someone with more experience will be able to provide a better insight . 
  academica are currently 4th placed , p5 1w 4d 0l . 
  hapoel tel aviv are currently 3rd placed , p5 4w 1d 0l . 
  academica has gotten draw after draw after draw at home . 
  however hapoel tel aviv are n't likely to cause an upset . 
  they only won their last 2 games in the previous europa league season , defeating an already eliminated rapid bucuresti and an already qualified legia warsaw . 
  i 'd say this one is a tie between a win or a draw for academica but hopefully they will deliver . 
  ** newcastle [ 2.35 ] ** - bordeaux [ 2.90 ] [ draw : 3.10 ], 
  bordeaux have never won against an english side . 
  they have kept english sides at a draw on two occasions , both times playing at home . 
  they have never scored away at an english side . 
  meanwhile , newcastle have consistently scored at least a goal a game this season . 
  the only exception has been away at maritimo , 2 weeks ago . 
  if anything , i trust that alan pardew will carry the team to victory through sheer awesomeness ; also ba ; and p. cisse . 
  to be honest the odds for this match are great for what seems like an opportunity for newcastle to score their first 3 points in the europa league this season . 
  i do n't have much knowledge about either teams . 
  maritimo are performing sub-par this season in primeira liga . 
  p5 1w 2d 2l . 
  club brugge are the current leaders of belgian pro league , p9 w6 d3 l0 . 
  that aside , they were trashed by bordeaux , losing 4-0 away . 
  hopefully club brugge decide they must get the 3 points today . 
  kinda rushing writing this one as it 's already kinda late so i 'll keep it short . 
  stuttgart will be looking to finally get their first 3 points today , but probably playing it safe as their season has so far been a complete mess , p6 w1 d2 l3 . 
  molde are the consecutive winners of norway 's tippeligaen and are likely winners of a 3rd one too . 
  that aside , an upset is unlikely . 
  i 'm gon na go ahead and say it 's going to be a goalless draw . 
   ** -- you might want to take a step back before betting on these games !, 
  here be dragons . 
  people should really steer away from this game . 
  borussia monchengladbach very likely had a ( single ) great season that are unlikely to repeat in years to come . 
  2 seasons ago they were in the bundesliga relegation play-off . 
  now , somehow , an europa league team . 
  their bundesliga form : p6 w1 3d 2l , they won their first game and ever since then , their form has been declining . 
  it 's still early but i really do n't think their cut for the europa league , let alone at the top of the league in bundesliga . 
  fenerbahce are n't in better shape either . 
  p6 w2 3d 1l ; losing their most recent game . 
  if only they would have played this one at home , this could have had victory written on it . 
  i 'm gon na go ahead and say this will be a draw ; i may be very wrong so i 'll ask everyone again to steer away from this game as it is an unpredictable game ( in my opinion ) . 
  steaua bucuresti are the current leaders of the romanian liga i. 
  it 's more than likely that they will dominate and trash everything ( but the europa league ) until january after which they will descend into a disappointing form . 
  p10 w8 d1 l1 . 
  they have even kept stuttgart to a 2-2 draw , away , 2 weeks ago . 
  meanwhile , fc copenhagen are also current leaders , in the danish superliga . 
  p11 w7 d4 l0 . 
  i do n't know much about them except they played against chelsea last season and although they have performed well , they lost 0-2 . 
  this is simply a very hard game to predict and over the years the romanian teams have been inconsistent in their european runs . 
  kinda rushing this one as i have written a lot . 
  napoli have so far p6 w5 d1 l0 in serie a. psv eindhoven have so far p7 w5 d0 l2 . 
  i 'm gon na go ahead and say napoli will cause an upset simply because of their form . 
  napoli 's last season in champions league was sadly rewarded with a knockout out of round of 16 in the champions league 2nd leg by chelsea , losing 4-1 on stamford bridge . 
  they however kept manchester city and bayern munich ( runner-ups to the previous champions league ) to a draw and they beat a pathetic villareal both at home and away . 
  hopefully this will pay off . 
  * somehow it seems unlikely that so many home sides will win but hopefully my predictions are on par with reality and let 's hope for some great europa league matches tonight .
