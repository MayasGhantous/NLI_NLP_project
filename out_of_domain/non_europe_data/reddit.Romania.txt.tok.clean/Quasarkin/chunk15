  `` it 's due '' is never a great conclusion when betting . 
  i have little hopes for qpr , particularly because they 're playing west brom , as well as away . 
  in retrospect , i realized that i bet on napoli not because they were the better team but because i had no away winners in my post . 
  steaua bucuresti also decided to score a freak goal in the last possible minutes , winning 1-0 . 
  my best call would be the newcastle one . 
  poured my heart into that one . 
  oh well , better luck next time . 
  i will try something new today , hopefully the mods wo n't mind and the community will receive it well . 
  if all is good and i find the time to continue doing this , i will . 
  let me know in the comments which games you would like me to take a closer look at and update them into the main post . 
  i have updated this match into the main post and tried to detail it as well as i could . 
  here 's an upvote !, 
  i took the liberty of posting this one at 20:00 gmt since i think people should have enough time to dig through the information being thrown at them . 
  i have done reports on every premier league match tomorrow . 
  i would have done more leagues but i do n't know how the community will react so i 'll keep it , for now , to 6 matches a day and community daily picks ( to be done on request or at my own leisure ) . 
  no sir !, 
  dear everton , thank you !, 
  [ keep hope alive !, 
  i read the daily picks thread . 
  i have continued to do reports on every premier league game and i have taken the liberty of posting a few additional games that i think will be exciting to watch tomorrow as well as great to bet on . 
  there wo n't be a detailed daily picks thread for 08.10.2012 ( i 'll still do it ! ), 
  since i believe that ` mondays are the worst days to bet on ' , unless perhaps the community gives me a list of suggestions to write about ( maximum of 6 games ) . 
  just reply to this post if you know a great game that you would like me to write about . 
  i would also much appreciate it if you have any additional tips about today 's fixtures ; i 've noticed not a lot of people care to write about a specific great game to bet on , which is a shame because everyone is here to contribute and discuss exactly about those kind of games . 
  in the mean time , fuck manchester united . 
  i 'll throw my accumulator [ here ] ( http://oi45.tinypic.com/i6mbs4.jpg ) !, 
  1 $ to win me 374 $ . 
  also , today 's a great chance to bet 1x on southampton , great odds . 
  statistics point to a draw . 
  perhaps an x2 on inter milan would be great too . 
  ac milan have been poor but since it 's a derby it could be a draw as well . 
  barcelona will get the 3 points tonight in the el clasico . 
  no doubt !, 
  ** edit : **, 
  ** 14:31 gmt : ** once in a while a match is destined for a certain outcome no matter how hard you want to push for a different result . 
  that 's exactly how it went for southampton and fulham today . 
  statistics at its best . 
  dae like to bet on manchester united because if they win , good ; if they do n't , even better ? 
  same goes for arsenal and tottenham .

  god 's subtle way of saying he heard the prayers and making his presence known . 
  late season 2 . 
  memes about the legendary stinson were finally getting through on the internet ; so i gave it a try . 
  the liberty bell incident got me hooked . 
  one final epic 9th season will do it for me . 
  am i really the only one that dislikes eye candy just because they 're bound to play the same game every other eye candy has played before them and thus not make much of an interesting character because the producers will portray them exactly as that ? 
  i always assumed `` the dragon slayer '' is just a character created by coach without him even being aware of it . 
  he probably had an epiphany during his early days in his first season where he realized his weakest aspect will be the social game . 
  he made himself more likeable using unique quirks and uncommon experiences he 's had in the past , he made himself look smarter by delivering ` outside the box ' thinking , faked confidence to the point of arrogance and he made himself look physically imposing by practicing yoga every morning . 
  in truth , he 's social skills are so non-existent that he has to constantly talk about loyalty and honor to try and make people speak exactly what 's on their mind because he knows he 's not good at reading in-between the lines and figuring ahead of time what 's supposed to happen in case somebody is not being honest with him . 
  he 's smarter than most and he thinks he 's smarter than them all . 
  . . and coach is clever . 
  giving credit where it 's due . 
  he was aware of the fact that this is a television show every second out there . 
  he made himself very likeable playing an unique type of villain ; almost machiavellian . 
  he really does believe he 's being the good guy and everyone else is the bad guy and once those fears are confirmed to him all hell breaks loose ; as was the case with russell hantz . 
  all of this and more , at least to me , makes him one of the most likeable characters that have featured in survivor in the last 10 seasons . 
  join ` the gentlemen 's club ' channel . 
  to me it makes much more sense to kill both minions when you get the enemy buff at level 1 because that way you will be able to time and ward it for the next one , perhaps even gain a kill ; at least that 's how i do it and 85 % of the times it works every time . 
  i should note that i only do this in premades . 
  soloq is different . 
  i can tell this is going to be a really unpopular opinion . 
  i 'm not even going to argue my case . 
  s02e01 in which marshall ca n't stop thinking about lily after their break-up ; as the episode progresses ted gets more and more annoyed by this . 
  the scene when ted , after 56 days , tired of marshall 's shit , flat out calls him pathetic . 
  there 's a / r/bestof / potential with this but screw it . 
  i 'm too busy being on top of a chick . 
  i 'll just keep it simple . 
  if my math is right , they each had to fuck 9.7 men a day , every day for 50 years straight , to get to that number . 
  here 's some flaws with this estimation though :, 
  - 355,000 makes it seem as if they 're all unique individuals . 
  - the last 15 years of their career probably had scarce clientele . 
  i hope . 
  - they had breaks in their career to take care of their pregnancies/newborns . 
  also , how can you even compare barney stinson to prostitutes ? 
  he provides a very special kind of service to women . 
  he makes the bimbos feel special , he makes them feel wanted and he gives them an amazing night , without making them feel like sluts the morning after . 
  sometimes it 's multiple nights .
