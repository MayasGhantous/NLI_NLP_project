  edit : more money could flow in if bale fucks off to real madrid . 
  wishful thinking !, 
  in 2003 arsenal begun work on emirates stadium . 
  they have yet to profit from this investment thus very little budget for wenger . 
  it 's probably a crazy theory but it 's my theory and i 'm sticking to it . 
  sansa has pov chapters in a game of thrones . 
  first time i see the video but i 've seen it referenced a ton of times on reddit . 
  what 's so hard to understand ? 
  he 's asking if we 've ever had a dream where we could do anything we wanted . 
  for the most part he 's just chocking on rephrasing the first part of what he 's trying to say . 
  the boy in the stripped pyjamas - i went in it knowing anything about it . 
  literally . 
  at the end when i realized what was going to happen , as the boy and the other farmers were being taken to the showers , i was shocked . 
  i had my hand covering my mouth in disbelief for over 10 minutes . 
  i 'm 100 % sure that cech , ivanovic , cole and hazard are starting in both games . 
  i 'm 80 % sure on terry , oscar , schurrle . 
  on the other hand , i also think lukaku will play in both games but not everyone in here seems to agree with me . 
  we 'll just have to wait and see . 
  this is one of the reasons why i do n't watch liga 1 ; and i 've been told several times this is an unpopular opinion but what the hell , i 'll say it anyway . 
  there are a handful of teams that are actually trying to accomplish something , to play attractive football , to show they deserve to be in our top league . 
  but whenever i try to watch a game 30 % of the time is spent on drama and 60 % of the time is mindless passing with no vision . 
  * sigh *, 
  you 're totally right . 
  i was checking [ livescore ] ( http://www.livescore.in ) to see what teams already played and i totally failed to read that yesterday 's game was a league one game . 
  thanks . 
  does watford have a sub-reddit ? 
  i would like to check it out . 
  i 'll be watching watford 's away game with birmingham . 
  thanks for this great suggestion !, 
  i 'm ruling them out because they already played . 
  i was able to watch the 2nd half of the game and i was impressed with the pace of the game but in front of the goal the performance was a bit lackluster until the last 10 minutes . 
  weasel & septon meribald and that pretty blonde girl that is raped by everyone in harrenhal and has her teeth broken are just a few of the minor characters that i really appreciate . 
  they do n't care who 's lord of what and who 's warden of where . 
  yet here they are , in the midst of war . 
  ** part 1 **, 
  let me start this off by mentioning right away that this is just my youthful opinion ; the opinion of a 22 year old . 
  that being said , i 'll lay out our modern history for you while keeping it simple and you wo n't need to read an entire boring book about romania . 
  one last thing before i get started , and again i mention that this is all just my opinion , but i think romanians tend to act like we have rich history , rich traditions , yada yada yada . 
  this is mostly because most of our population was ingrained like that during our communism years . 
  so here it is , modern romania as i see it . 
  1821 : valahia uprises against the ottoman empire . 
  the goals were to gain independence for valahia and moldova . 
  the uprising failed but it made valahia , moldova and later on transilvania realize that we are united through our common language and interests . 
  1848 : revolutions all over europe , our people announced that they want to unite as one . 
  we were rejected by the greater powers and we were forced to proceed alone against the ottoman empire . 
  1859 : moldova and valahia unite under the name of `` the romanian principalities '' , under a single ruler ( known as ` domnitor ' ) , alexandru ioan cuza . 
  1866 : new constitution was formed to finally give us the official name of romania . 
  that same year alexandru ioan cuza was forced to abdicate and live in exile by an opposing coalition . 
  his successor was carol i of romania , a german prince . 
  we chose to do so because tying ourselves to a royal family , we were able to get our independence . 
  i should note though , alexandru ioan cuza is considered a national hero for what he has accomplished during his time as ` domnitor ' . 
  ** part 2 **, 
  1878 : romania is declared a sovereign country by carol i , following the defeat of the ottoman empire by the russians . 
  we fought on the russian side . 
  1881 : carol i is proclaimed king of romania and romania becomes a monarchy under the official name of ` kingdom of romania ' . 
  carol i ruled until 1914 . 
  1881-1914 is known as a period of stability for romania . 
  he did not produce a male heir . 
  his only daughter died at the age of 3 . 
  1914 : new king , ferdinand i. i do n't know the exact relation he had with carol i but he is to some mild degree related . 
  world war i breaks out . 
  romania declares neutrality . 
  1916 : romania joins world war i on the side of the allies , declaring war on the austro-hungarians . 
  within 4 months our army was wiped out , 2/3 of the country was taken away by austro-hungary and russia . 
  1918 : in may of 1918 , in no position to fight no more , romania negotiates a peace treaty with germany . 
  in october of 1918 we re-enter the war on the axis side . 
  russia and austro-hungary collapse . 
  we get all our land back . 
  we unite a second time , this time including transilvania , basarabia and bucovina as well commonly known as ` the greater romania ' . 
  ** part 3 **, 
  it 's not a period we 're told about in history classes . 
  probably just a period of stability . 
  succeeded by michael i. 
  1930 : michael i is succeeded by carol ii , his father , after he comes back in the country . 
  apparently he just had to give it away since it 's his father or something . 
  i do n't know for sure . 
  anyway , it 's not that important . 
  1940 : carol ii is succeeded by his son , michael i , after ion antonescu declared carol ii to be ` anti-german ' and staged a coup-d'etat . 
  the matter of fact is that he did kind of screw us out of a lot of territories through failed diplomacy . 
  with world war ii in progress , we once again try to maintain neutrality . 
  russia , known at the time as the soviet union , forces our hand and implies we have an ultimatum to join the war on their side or they will invade . 
  we said ` fuck you ' and joined the axis with germany . 
  we were forced to retreat from to basarabia and parts of bucovina and basically gave these to the soviet union . 
  antonescu 's regime in the meantime played a major role in the holocaust , following nazi policy to some extent . 
  close to 300 thousand people have been executed because of his regime . 
  1944 : the soviet union crosses the borders into romania . 
  king michael i arrests ion antonescu , joins the allies and declares war on germany . 
  yeah , i know . 
  we did some pretty major screw ups in world war i and world war ii . 
  russia , then germany ; then germany again and now back to russia . 
  fuck this shit . 
  because of this romania is not recognized officially as having a role in nazi germany 's defeat that same year . 
  with the soviets still in romania and exerting leadership , communism pulls through . 
  1947 : at the paris peace treaty we managed to get transilvania back but moldova was not recovered and remained under soviet rule . 
  they managed to become independent in 1991 following the soviet union 's collapse but to this day moldova is still not a part of romania as it should be . 
  although the opinions are split on this . 
  it could definitely help moldova as they are much much poorer . 
  that same year king michael i is forced to abdicate and leave the country . 
  romania was proclaimed a republic .
