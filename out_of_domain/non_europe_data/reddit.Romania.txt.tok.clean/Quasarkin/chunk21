  he died in 1965 but during this time he managed to negociate the soviet union 's retreat from our territory . 
  1965-1989 : new leadership once again . 
  we begun pursuing independent policies ; we condemnated the soviet invasion of czechoslovakia , we begun forming relationships with countries like israel and egypt . 
  during his reign he drastically increased our debts and he eventually had to initiate a project to reimburse the debt . 
  to achieve this he imposed harsh policies on the economy . 
  the impoverished romanians were hit hard . 
  among other things , like other communist leaders ( look at north korea for similar examples ) , he imposed a cult of personality and extended the authority of the police . 
  this led to a dramatic decrease in popularity and ended with his execution in the romanian revolution of 1989 . 
  ** part 5 **, 
  december 21 , 1989 : a mass rally summoned in bucharest to support ceausescu turns hostile . 
  ceausescu and his wife flee the city via helicopter . 
  they end up in custody shortly after landing . 
  december 25 , 1989 : ceausescu and his wife are executed after being convicted by a mock court for genocide and other crimes . 
  ion iliescu attains national recognition as the leader of an impromptu government , that aims to restore democracy . 
  post 1989 : romania becomes a democracy the following year . 
  we enter another period of stability . 
  we join nato in 2004 . 
  we join the european union in 2007 . 
  ** and that 's about it . 
   welcome to / r/romania , a beautiful yet undiscovered country by many tourists . 
  famous for its beautiful landscapes and gorgeous women . 
  renown for bringing the world the likes of ` dracula ' , nicolae ceausescu , nadia comaneci and gheorghe hagi . 
  this is our little romanian corner of reddit !, 
  i thought it was going to be a picture of you winning the empirates cup . 
  shower me with downvotes now ca nu sunt fanul echipei voastre favorite : <, 
  edit : why the fuck is everyone speaking in english in that sub-reddit ? 
  am postat un match thread de test in sub-reddit . 
  let me know what you think !, 
  e doar un match thread de test . 
  ** edit : ** match thread updated !, 
  though life . 
  bitches plz . 
  i 'm staying awake till 5:30 am to watch this game . 
  hazardous matarials ? 
  really ? 
  not that i wish to imply you are sleeping on your job but neither have a guaranteed spot in chelsea 's midfield . 
  i think hazard is the one who 's going to get more regular time but even that 's a risk . 
  mata will not be playing in the dgw as far as i know ; him , azpilicueta and torres have an international friendly that week . 
  lukaku will really shine tonight . 
  just watch !, 
  ** edit at ht : ** well he 's shining all right . 
  he 's the only one out there who does n't seem to be doing anything noteworthy . 
  si sincer sa fiu nu meritam sa avem echipa calificata direct in grupele champions league . 
  really ? 
  i really did n't feel like i was watching at a trailer set within the half-life universe . 
  it felt like an amateur 's fan trailer . 
   on my way home . 
   with a friend . 
   had spent most of the day at the mall buying cool clothes and shit . 
   we pass through a park . 
   it was getting pretty dark . 
   we sat on the grass . 
   initially skeptical because the area is full of dogs during the day . 
   afraid piss and shit would be everywhere . 
   there was n't . 
   i sat down and placed my head on the grass . 
   watched the clear blue sky in the ever-rising dimness of the night . 
   talked to my friend about the ever-endless topic of girls . 
   realize he 's my best friend and that life is worth living for . 
   even through the rough patches . 
  i am just like you . 
  i 've had depression on and off for over 10 years but i feel like things are finally starting to go my way . 
  for the first time in a very long time i actually want to be on the road ahead of me . 
  i am looking for a job , i am building solid relationships with my friends and i get girls smiling again . 
  i hope you get better !, 
  wish you all the best !, 
  ** p.s. 
  : ** i 'm not saying i 'm over my depression . 
  i 'm on my way there though . 
  i 'm a fairly decent poet , i like to think , but i did not try hard to write it as a poem . 
  i just wanted to get my message across . 
  it 's the little things that make you forget you have depression . 
  even if it 's only for a little while . 
  pana una alta , tanase la nationala . 
  about the same ; waiting for the premier league . 
  definitely - i learned this from a reddit comment . 
  it made so much sense , i have been spelling it correctly ever since . 
  nu stiu cat de bine s-ar tine in timp dar pe moment mi se pare hilar as fuck . 
  ma refeream strict difuzarea in romania . 
  that is bullshit . 
  schurrle wo n't if we score more goals than hull . 
  my fpl career is about to begin . 
  i barely missed out on it last year , found about fpl in gw2 or so because everyone in / r/soccer was going crazy about it . 
  [ my team ] ( http://i.imgur.com/v05azik.png ) will hopefully bring me the points !, 
  i 'm placing massive faith on my midfielders . 
  i woke up today and had to work on last-minute changes because bale is out drinking . 
  wish you all good luck & here 's to a good year !, 
  wager : 2 $, 
  system : 12/13, 
  minimum return : 22 $, 
  maximum return : 439 $, 
  what do you guys think ? 
  tore my bet apart . 
  a couple of those are some really lucky guesses . 
  to predict an away win for aston villa in the first match against arsenal who were looking to get on the table with 3 points right away in itself is quite the luck . 
  guessing that norwich and everton will draw is also very lucky . 
  in general , i think , guessing draws is quite hard . 
  yet he does it again with reading and watford ; as if one lucky draw was n't enough . 
  i find sunderland vs. fulham and west brom vs. southampton to also be a bit of lucky guesses . 
  either of them could have gone either way and i half expected a draw or a home win for both .
