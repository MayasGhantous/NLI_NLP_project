  what you could have told your team to do ? 
  two things . 
  either bait the enemy team in the jungle using a couple of smart wards and an oracle , baron is usually a good spot , or ask one of your teammates to split-push til the sun do n't shine . 
  massively split-push until the enemy team commits to either going to defend that particular lane or let it fall and try to make a play as 5v4 . 
  just play really passive when your teammate is split-pushing and wait for a reaction from the enemy team . 
  you 'll know what to do then . 
  that 's about it ; i hope i 've not been too hectic with my response . 
  edit : never abandon botlane as the adc . 
  the tower ai n't worth that much , you overestimate its usefulness , you do n't need to get it down as fast as possible unless you 're looking to switch lanes with the top laner or make really big plays down the middle . 
  focus on farming . 
  farming is the easiest and safest way to carry a game . 
  you 're on the right path to getting yourself even higher . 
  the moment you start to realize how many mistakes you 're making is the moment you start to really improve . 
  most of the people in bronze/silver and gold improve solely through experience . 
  but experience takes a lot of time to come by . 
  however , there 's a second and better way of improving yourself ; one that you will need to do anyway when you reach platinum : realize your mistakes and actively go about trying to improve those aspects of your game . 
  or setting up a wallcage with 4 anivia 's and a pantheon to drop in . 
  for style points , 4 anivia ultimates as well . 
  you 're painting it too white and black . 
  first of all , it could very well be 4v5 at baron and you could still lose a fight if they know what they 're doing . 
  but i 'm not going to talk about that just now . 
  not knowing when , why and how to approach baron is one of the most common mistakes in silver league . 
  let 's talk about what you can improve as a player . 
  your cs . 
  i can not stress enough how important it is for your cs to at least be at a level with your lane opponent . 
  csing is the safest , easiest way to get fed . 
  a kill 's real value is not in gold ( that 's worth about 3 minion waves ) but in the lack of playtime for the opponent . 
  it seems like you realize your mistakes but i do n't think you realize just how difficult you 're making it for your team by going for high risk/high reward plays all the time . 
  i 'll use my friend as an example . 
  he 's a bronze 1 player and he 's a top laner , just like you . 
  he plays riven . 
  it just so happens that whenever he feels he 's ahead he goes into chasing down the enemy top laner so hard that he gets ganked not only by the jungler but by the midlaner too ; and this is a thing that happens almost every game . 
  and he 's unwilling to learn . 
  he blames it on the midlaner for not calling ss . 
  he 's trying to carry a game so hard that he ultimately falls in mediocrity . 
  you can make big plays but you also have to learn when to retreat ; even if the enemy laner has 42 health left . 
  as i said , a kill 's real value lays in the fact that the opponent is forced to waste time . 
  it 's better to leave your opponent with 42 health and force him to recall and come back to the lane than risk chasing him down in the jungle when the enemy midlaner is ss . 
  the best tip i can offer you : if a kill seems too good to be true , it probably is . 
  always have 2 wards in your inventory . 
  always . 
  even if you do n't intend on using them for your lane . 
  overall , i 'd say you 're making common silver league mistakes and by realizing your mistakes you are on your way to improving . 
  clearly going down from silver 2 to silver 4 has been a good thing for you . 
  i suggest you watch some streamers and see what they 're doing , when they 're doing it and why they 're doing it . 
  it really helps you improve , no matter how tedious watching a streamer can be while you could be `` improving '' in ranked . 
  i love it when the good wife tackles current real issues and i think they did a really good job portraying it . 
  i remember last year when they tackled the anonymous group and it was fucking fantastic and i 'm expecting more of the same this season using the nsa as a background plot that will step forward in the second part of the season . 
  the good wife is such an underrated tv show . 
  maybe it 's because they 're pushing the love triangle too hard or too often or maybe it 's because the casual viewer is too lazy to follow all these sub-plots that seem to sneak in the main arc at a later date . 
  either way , this episode was a 9/10 for me ; the ending felt a bit forced . 
  in diana 's previous scene she seemed very committed to not tainting will 's reputation and eli made it very clear that she is not getting the position . 
  i have a sneaky feeling david lee will figure out everything and buy his way into florrick & agos . 
  i think it would be fun to see david lee throwing grumpy sarcastic one liners at diana & will if and when they meet in court . 
  i picked up annie about a week or so before her rework and i have to say she has integrated really well with my champion pool . 
  she 's a great counter to the popular bans like fizz , kassadin & zed . 
  i 'm surprised more people do n't play her against those particular champions . 
  edit : it seems there are strong opinions against annie vs. fizz -- as someone already pointed out , when fizz uses playful as you 're trying to stun , annie 's stun will cancel but wo n't remove the proc . 
  playful has a cooldown of 8 seconds , plenty of time to cast another q or , my favorite , bring tibbers out on top of her . 
  zhonya should be a top priority item against fizz and zed . 
  early levels against these champions are very important . 
  edit2 : people seem to forget how op annie 's e is as well . 
  she deals 20 + 20 % of her ap damage to any incoming basic attack at rank 1 and gives her an extra 20 armor and magic resist . 
  i 'm half expecting her to be raped . 
  that would be something previously undone in television . 
  she 's underage and she 's the daughter of a governor that aims to become the president . 
  that would be quite the scandal . 
  then again , it 's television and she 's a main character . 
  writers would fear that it would cause us , the audience , to detach from grace 's character . 
  either way , i 'm a big fan of s1 and s4 but s5 is closely shaping up to be one of the best ; if it 's heading towards where i think it 's heading . 
  * she is the champion if you 're looking to understand what mid is all about and learning how to play to the lane 's maximum potential . 
  * easy to pick up , difficult to master . 
  * easy to farm with . 
  * great roaming potential . 
  * not a particularly mana hungry champion . 
  * has the potential of oneshot-ing the ad carry and/or the support with a full build . 
  ** cons : **, 
  * does n't fit the current mid meta . 
  * assassins will destroy a lux newbie in lane . 
  my understanding of it is that tyson hates aligning with ` boring ' people while gervase hates aligning with ` scramblers ' . 
  all anivia mains think they 're better than everyone else . 
  ** and now for a short lesson in grammar : **, 
  * ` a ' comes before ** a word ** that begins with a consonant . 
  * ` an ' comes before a word that begins with a vowel . 
  ** examples : **, 
  * i 'm ** a s ** hit jungler . 
  let 's not kid ourselves , i ca n't play that role for the life of me . 
  * you 're ** an a ** wful mid laner and i hope you die in hell . 
  uninstall game pls . 
  * this lesson was brought to you by the people of league of legends . 
  please reprotr yourself . 
  do n't forget about the usefulness of staying alive and provide auras for your teammates . 
  not bad . 
  not bad at all . 
  maybe he 's american . 
  thank you for your reply . 
  i will be looking into some of the jobs you 've mentioned later today after i manage to sleep . 
  this thing has been eating at me really hard for the past 2 days and i have n't been able to sleep . 
  this was a clear penalty . 
  the referee made the right decision .
