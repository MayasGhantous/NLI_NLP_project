  `` somebody 's going to drop points , maybe both '', 
  edit : i 've been awake 28 hours . . this sleep . 
  ffs . 
  * i 'm platinum 2 and this is what i 'm doing right now ; it does n't matter whether you 're bronze or silver or hell , even platinum . 
  everyone should take some time off of ranked . 
  this is the best way to see actual improvement . 
  * your next ranked should be somewhere in early/mid january 2014 . 
  i 'm personally spending this time learning the roles i do n't often play ( top lane and jungle ) , increasing my champion pool and improving my general game knowledge . 
  * in additional to that , this is also a great way to settle into season 4 . 
  you do n't want to rush into things when so much is changing . 
  shurelya will not be forgotten . 
  there 's a lot of potential with the bvw theme . 
  i was skeptical at first but it 's definitely added the much needed strategy and drama ( from a fan point of view ) in the pre-merge game . 
  i hope they continue to come up with interesting themes so we can see how everyone 's game evolves and revolves around a particular one . 
  super happy smiling tigers fc is where it 's at . 
  that shit 's gold yo ' . 
  you 're disgusting and i hope you die . 
  i believe it 's a final four this year . 
  i 'm expecting final 5/6 fireworks between the two of them with caleb getting the short stick . 
  as far as i can tell right now ( having read no spoilers ) , tyson , gervase , ciera and hayden make the final 4 . 
  i 'm not sure where vytas is in all of this . 
  he got a great early game edit but it seems that 's over now . 
  similar edit to jonathan penner . 
  except that falcao was already great at porto scoring no less than 41 goals in 51 league matches . 
  reynold ( s ) comes to mind from recent survivor history . 
  hello , i would like a trial invite that rewards me with an incentive to play as well as a reward after signing up . 
  this is not my first play-through of eve , i 've had a successful account about 2 years ago but i would like to restart from scratch because there have been a lot of changes . 
  i intend on subscribing after the 21 days expire . 
  i do n't know . 
  shit , now i want to play monopoly . 
  and watch doogie howser . 
  be right back . 
  get all the 18 year old girls that you did n't get when you were 21 . 
  he does n't seem okay with it . 
  obviously . 
  of course it was . 
  ** / rant on **, 
  for the love of god people , rc does not deserve to come back . 
  she was a mediocre player at best . 
  just because she has a nice rack does n't mean she 's a quality player . 
  same goes for corinne but for now i 'll just discuss rc . 
  as far as i can remember , she was boring as fuck to watch and her strategies seemed to be employed solely to remind people that she could be someone to strategize with . 
  she was ** not ** someone to strategize with . 
  end of story . 
  vytas , ciera and malcolm on the heroes tribe ? 
  just plain crazy . 
  him and vytas are ** likeable ** villains . 
  do n't mistake them for heroes . 
  and do n't even get me started on ciera ; she has not exactly been able to shine and backstab people this season because tyson is running the show but if that girl gets her own season she will be a villain . 
  i guarantee it . 
  same thing happened to andrea . 
  and last but not the least , the villains tribe . 
  johnny fairplay , abi maria and alicia are not villains . 
  one of them was once a villain but then became a quitter and the other two are just plain bitches . 
  it takes a lot more to be a villain . 
  ** in my opinion . 
  it 's time for arsenal to draw galatasaray . 
  i 've seen this several times over the years and it never gets old . 
  i bet avb will be sacked after this game . 
  i do n't know man , i really enjoyed watching suarez put 2 past them and was really hoping for a hat-trick for some god forsaken reason . 
  if anything i should be considered the prophet that bringeth forth the chosen one . 
  for one , i was the one typing in local that i shall deliver nude pics to whomever warps through to pf - . 
  [ called it . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1sxpf6/live_match_thread_tottenham_vs_liverpool/ce2b6se ), 
  op success !, 
  cultural victory !, 
  watch yoself was on fire tonight . 
  he got several noteworthy kills and warp-ins . 
  so i guess i have to send nude pics now . 
  huh . 
  it 's very similar but alas , it 's not this . 
  you are a genius . 
  thank you . 
  thank you . 
  thank you . 
  any hd streams ? 
  this is exactly how i would describe it . 
  i thought i was fucking crazy ; this is the first time i hear an opinion similar to mine regarding this video game . 
  that was so last year . 
  this year he decided to be player manager for barnet in conference premier . 
  what a fucking legend . 
  [ fixed . 
  make it your new year 's resolution to make more of these after every match-day . 
  gk and gibbs are a bit debatable but everything else is spot on . 
  my calculations estimate that this pun does not make any sense nor does it fit previous responses . 
  further analysis concludes that i do n't give a shit nor is that state likely to change for the foreseeable future . 
  i was expecting ashley cole to send it anywhere but the goal . 
  hell , not even around the goal . 
  but he actually shot it fairly close . 
  good job , ashley . 
  your improvement is duly noted . 
  you 're either giving credit to a guy who quotes a lover or he 's trying to be poetic . 
  i 'm not very sure . 
  six ? 
  pls . 
  do n't insult us . 
  we 've got mata , oscar , schurrle , de bruyne , hazard , willian , marin , ulises davila and now traore . 
  hell , i 'm not even counting hazard 's younger brother . 
  they 're technically wingers but as far as i can tell they 're playing very much like attacking midfielders . 
  it 's not very obvious on willian but it 's very obvious on hazard .
