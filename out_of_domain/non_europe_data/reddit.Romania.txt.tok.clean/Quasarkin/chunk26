  ** edit : ** also , wingers are technically attacking midfielders . 
  give me a minute or two and i 'll figure out how many pure wingers we have . 
  starting with moses . 
  ** edit 2 : ** victor moses , gael kakuta , thorgan hazard , piazon and christian atsu . 
  pure wingers with the exception of piazon who can also play a forward role . 
  the consensus around / r/chelseafc is that he will most likely play today against southampton . 
  i really wish he can show jose what he can do because his statistics are off the charts despite not playing an entire half of the season . 
  i believe the statistics ( do n't quote me on this , i 'm still drunk from last night ) show that , over the last 1 and a half seasons , he has created more chances than hazard and oscar combined . 
  while hazard and oscar have played half a season more than him . 
  ** edit : ** jose really likes his clean sheets and my belief is that he does n't play mata often because mata is our only midfielder that does n't track back . 
  he prefers to sit in an offensive position so he can feed through balls or 1v1 defenders . 
  i 'm still quite drunk . 
  your post is much better and informative than mine . 
  have an upvote and let 's hope we see mata on the field today . 
  ktbffh . 
  we need a couple of attacking midfielders and mayhaps afterwards a striker if we 've got money to spare . 
  you 're exactly right . 
  a creative attacking player that feeds through balls to our strikers . 
  which we do n't have . 
  oh jose , you clever bastard . 
  you 're keeping mata on the bench for when we get strikers . 
  yup , that 's it . 
  #johnnykills 2014, 
  i was n't being sarcastic towards you , i 'm sorry if it came out like that . 
  i was fairly drunk when i came up with my inspired post . 
  right now i 'm just tipsy so i 'll try again : mata should be used more often when we 're one down or when we really need to get those 3 points . 
  he 's a great sub to replace one of our more defensive attacking midfielders . 
  i 'm looking at willian in particular . 
  right now what we 're doing when we 're one down is to either sub out our defensive central midfielder and sub in a false 9 or simply sub-ing in striker for striker . 
  and this , in my experience as a top-level mananger , demotivates our strikers ; particularly torres . 
  other than what i 've already said , i would probably sell schurrle and de bruyne and bring in a young complete forward with prowess on the ball and physical aspects similar to drogba . 
  someone who has had at least 2 years worth of premier league experience and has proven himself goal after goal . 
  i wonder if arsenal would give us bendtner . 
  any other hd stream ? 
  this one always seems choppy for me . 
  it might as well be 3d , if it does n't work it 's useless . 
  people need to stop defending this particular stream just because it 's ** free hd ** . 
  i have watched hd streaming before and they 're always seamless . 
  this one is not . 
  ** oldschool sd streaming : ** http://firstrownow.eu/watch/230262/1/watch-southampton-fc-vs-chelsea.html, 
  ramires overrated ? 
  if this was coming from anything but a barcelona fan i 'd even bother to argue your point . 
  * it differs a little bit depending on what country you 're asking for but the ` international ' version is that the manager is in charge of staff hirings , player signings , tactical decisions , etc. 
  * the head coach is the person in charge of every other coach on the staff . 
  he can make recommendations to the manager for hirings or sackings . 
  * there 's also a head scout for the scouting department that is in charge of the scouting staff and assigns other scouts on certain objectives ( opposing teams , the league , specific players , loaned out players , etc ) . 
  * the first team coach is a coach that trains players that are specifically on the ` first team ' . 
  he does n't train reserves , he does n't train youth players ( unless they are in the first team ) . 
  * in certain countries ( for example romania ) , the manager is the guy who hires the head coach and makes decisions regarding signings but the head coach is the main man that deals with players , tactical decisions , interviews and even has input on potential signings . 
  * ** edit : ** some clubs also employ a ` director of football ' which is probably the most unclear term for a job possible . 
  as far as i can tell , a director of football is someone who deals with the relationship between a manager and the board . 
  he also likely has input on what manager they should bring in should the current manager be sacked or retired . 
  brb , watching s4 so i can catch up . 
  i know it 's completely unrelated but what the hell is happening with ac milan ? 
  i just noticed they are 13th in serie a and have 19 points out of a possible 51 . 
  are we talking about the guy who won the golden boot at euro 2012 ? 
  i think more people need to realize that it 's not torres 's fault that he 's underachieving at chelsea . 
  look at eto'o and shevchenko and all the other strikers that signed for us . 
  they 're all estabilished world class strikers yet they all underperform for us . 
  it 's our tactics . 
  chelsea employ tactics that are run through the midfield , not through forwards . 
  this is why chelsea are in dire need of a striker typically known as a `` complete forward '' . 
  poachers and false 9 's wo n't ever make it here . 
  we need someone who can literally pull something out of a 1v3 . 
  i do n't recall anyone at the time of signing shevchenko or torres saying that they are on a declining path and we should n't expect much from them . 
  if anything everyone was stating quite the contrary . 
  hindsight is a powerful thing , even i can remember the first time we signed torres , i went to check some of his goals on youtube and i was n't particularly impressed . 
  not at all . 
  i knew he was a great striker but i did n't bother to pay attention to what kind of goals he scored . 
  i remember a lot of tap ins . 
  i can do 5 $ . 
  if anything he 's very empathic , he just does n't like to show it . 
  i can answer this . 
  i too believe i have what you can call a ` photographic ' memory . 
  as far as my personal experience goes , you ca n't actually recall mundane things like going out on a particular day to eat some particular food at some particular restaurant or how many times i 've been to the bathroom in my entire life ; it does n't work like that . 
  however , anything that did not feel mundane at the time of it happening , will be remembered with uncanny accuracy . 
  for example , and this may not seem very impressive right now but it 's off the top of my head , most people i 'm sure will remember the time their parents taught them the alphabet . 
  i however can actually recall what room i was being taught in , what objects were around me , how the room smelled , the pictures on the wall , i can picture how the book they were teaching me from looked and i remember the first word my father taught me how to read : airplane . 
  i can also remember i said it in my head at least a hundred times that day because it kept being put in my head different than all the other words until that time had been put . 
  to this very day the word ` airplane ' still seems very weird to me . 
  so how does it feel ? 
  it simply feels like a very organized mind and i 'm surprised more people have n't figured out how to organize their mind in such a way that they can memorize things by particular cues . 
  it does n't feel like i 'm storing them in pictures but if i 'm going through a memory i can actually play it in my head in real time and as i 'm playing the memory i can remember ` footnotes ' i made in my head at the time the memory was created . 
  for example , conversations : i can recall body language , particular words that were used in conversation , my posture , their posture , what things i was thinking at the time , what things i thought the other person was thinking at the time , etc. 
  the funny thing is that when i 'm storing all these conversations in my head i do n't actually store what i say . 
  i can recall some of what i 'm saying ( to fill the gaps of what the other person is talking about ) but most of the time it feels like a ` reconstructed ' part of the memory rather than an eidetic one like the rest of it . 
  this is not what i have experienced and it comes a bit as a surprise to me that it is widely considered as a fake . 
  is it possible that the array of people that have reported having eidetic memory to have been exaggerating how much they can remember ? 
  my mouth is literally dropping by the second that something that i have experienced for my entire life has no scientific evidence . 
  i am fairly sure that at least some of my memories are stored as ` pictures ' . 
  ** edit : ** seriously now , can anyone give me a rundown on how you remember something ? 
  do you really not play it inside your head in real time as if it 's a movie that you can skip ahead or rewind ? 
  i actually felt fairly normal until about 20 minutes ago . 
  now i 'm thinking , wait , this is not how everyone else does it ? 
  i always imagined everyone else does it and that i simply do it much better . 
  and now i 'm trying to figure out for myself if i 'm actually just using memory techniques and not actual ` frames ' . 
  i almost feel like one of those people that think they can sense the presence of ghosts or biblical figures . 
  i 'm at a loss for words . 
  ** edit : ** like , whenever you think about something someone said , do you not recall where they said it , how they said it , their body language , the time of the day , how words were being stressed , etc ? 
  do you just hear yourself in a flat voice ?
