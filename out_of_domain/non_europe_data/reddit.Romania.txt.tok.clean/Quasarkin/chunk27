  oh my god . 
  oh my god . 
  you are spot on mate . 
  i just tried to imagine a small conversation in my head and if i focused on the dialogue i would only ` see ' the dialogue , if i focused on the visuals i would only ` see ' the visuals . 
  if i try real hard i can put the two together but i have to focus quite a bit and i have n't even placed anything moving in the background , no smells or anything else . 
  the only thing that 's moving is the mouth of the person talking and it does n't even feel like they would talk that way . 
  no hand gestures or anything else . 
  no colors . 
  very impressive trick . 
  ** edit : ** well there goes my writing career . 
  i had such hopes . 
  i 'm actually fairly creative on paper when i 'm talking about something real but i 'm really shit at telling fictional stories and you just let me understand why . 
  awesome stuff . 
  disadvantages ? 
  hmm . 
  it depends if you can consider it a disadvantage . 
  because i 'm really good at remembering a certain action i can replay it ( and usually do ) in my head over and over again until i 'm sure i have processed it entirely . 
  it is very easy to notice certain words and inflections in hindsight and most of the time you get to realize that the person you 're talking to can only form a basic representation of who you are in their mind . 
  it feels very rudimentary to say the least . 
  it can feel like they 're not putting enough effort to getting to know you . 
  i hope this qualifies as a disadvantage for you . 
  finally , what do you mean ` all sorts of unrelated information ' ? 
  for me personally i can think up of my old room in our house before it got renovated and reconstruct it from all sorts of unrelated memories . 
  like for example i can recall my bed from the times i played hide and seek with my little brother and i kept going under it , i can recall the windows of the room and what objects where put there when i recall the time my mom would shut the lights off and i would look at the windows because they were the only source of lights . 
  i can recall my father 's desk simply because i can recall a picture of him in one of our old family albums . 
  can you go in detail a little bit more ? 
  he wants to play for a high level club , did n't you read the title ? 
  may the best cunts win . 
  ** hint : ** i 'm rooting for classenal . 
  yeah but i 'm a bit worried for you guys . 
  unlike the premier league , in the fa cup sometimes the shit club wins . 
  so wait , now we 're judging others based on how many people they 've been with ? 
  well . . fuck . 
  can you elaborate ? 
  what makes you think you 're a loser ? 
  i 'm not here to offer you my comfort or any of that bullshit . 
  only you can change yourself . 
  so instead , i will offer you my brutal honesty in hopes that you get the message :, 
  you are not the number of women you 've been with . 
  but if you keep your ` i 'm a loser ' mentality then you 're going to be a loser . 
  and no one 's going to ever bother to help you change that . 
  the world expects you to change it , not the other way around . 
  so what if women are rejecting you ? 
  there 's no way you ca n't see any kind of positives in any one of these experiences . 
  i 've had my fair share of rejections and i 've learned a lot about myself . 
  i thank those women almost every day for teaching me a little bit more about myself and what i want in a partner . 
  i even make a point out of it that we stay friends ( and i really mean friends , not the kind where you hope that you 'll get one of them eventually ) because they will feel some form of regret for rejecting you and they will give you hints on what they want in a man and so on . 
  you are a loser . 
  you are a loser until you 're not a loser anymore and only you can change that . 
  start today . 
  start small . 
  just do it . 
  fail . 
  do it again . 
  fail better . 
  you have n't tried to fix ** anything ** until you 've tried ** everything ** . 
  you need an escort . 
  a real one , not the trashy ones you see in the movies . 
  take a friend with you if you do n't feel like going alone , pay an escort to take care of you and let her walk you through it . 
  i strongly urge you to give it a try . 
  it wo n't last very long but you will get a better grasp on your anxiety and you will begin to improve your social skills considerably . 
  a friend of mine changed almost over night because he started paying for escorts ; he used to be the most awkward guy , close to no friends , kept to himself , always lame in conversations . 
  now he has the balls to go to random girls on the street and do cheap ass pick up lines just for the lulz . 
  and the funny thing is , ever since he started improving , he even became picky with the girls he would want to date . 
  he even broke up with his first girlfriend because he felt she was too immature . 
  that dude is my hero and i can only hope you try walking the same path . 
  most hookers are professionals but do ask a friend to point you in the right direction anyway . 
  do n't forget to bring your own condoms ( three should suffice ) . 
  you may want to try on a few condoms in your own private home before you get there though . 
  and do n't be afraid to admit that it is your first time . 
  some might even bother to go the extra mile in hopes that they gain a fidele client . 
  well for one , i finished high school 6 months ago . 
  fuck you man , now i got shit in my eyes . 
  da , am trait intr-o pestera . 
  dat goal in ` example 1 ' tho . 
  damn . 
  i do n't get it . 
  ( i 've been away from this sub-reddit and / r/gaming for about 2 days now ), 
  i 'm sorry but that was n't even close to the standards they have set in past skits . 
  it was vaguely funny but it felt way over the top . 
  cech , hazard , ivanovic , terry and ramires . 
  we ca n't really rotate them otherwise mourinho would have done so already . 
  he 's definitely trying . 
  i 've seen it happen against manchester city . 
  he gave up halfway through though because the referee was clearly against him but other than that and the match against us he definitely looks like he 's trying to have a more mature perspective on things . 
  in the heat of battle anyone can become a little hotheaded . 
  i wish him all the best and hope he continues to improve . 
  he 's definitely more enjoyable to watch . 
  well this thread is full of people that clearly do n't watch enough la liga . 
  i 'm not saying i 'm watching enough la liga but clearly nobody else is watching enough la liga either . 
  however , we 're definitely going to watch tonight 's la liga and probably root for atletico madrid because ` fuck barcelona ' and then we 're all going to think we watch enough la liga and comment about it for months to come in every single possible la liga thread . 
  mark my words . 
  first world problems . 
  it 's a good goal if you see it from where he picks the ball up but the real reason why it got posted , in my opinion , is because nobody expected him to get anything out of it and if they say otherwise they 're fucking liars . 
  chelsea were on their way to parking the bus and torres was being marked by 3 players at the 30 yards line . 
  and when we least expected it , we got a glimpse of torres of days long gone . 
  i should let you know by now that i may be wrong and op just wanted the sweet karma . 
  i do n't think infamous means what you think it means . 
  but yeah , i would love it if he can bring out his signature form starting on february 23rd or perhaps the 24th . 
  no need to rush .
