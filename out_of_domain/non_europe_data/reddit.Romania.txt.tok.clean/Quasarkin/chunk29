  he 's an amazing player and his stats are off the charts but he needed to be sold while his value was still high . 
  we 're just a little bit disappointed ( okay , quite disappointed ) that he is being sold to manchester united . 
  that being said , we 're all a little bit hopeful that mata puts a dent in manchester city 's title chances when they play at old trafford in early march . 
  ** edit : ** and a dent in arsenal 's chances to a 3rd place finish . 
  that is a man who will never win in a poker match . 
  he needs to work on his dribbling , finishing , concentration , decisions and acceleration . 
  ** ppms : ** shoot from distance , shoots with power , plays one-twos , cuts inside , run with ball through the center , curls ball . 
  only awesome people get this reference . 
  have you considered that it may be because it 's much easier for your strikers to finish off crosses coming on his stronger foot ? 
  same thing happens in my fm12 save and it 's almost always because my strikers have a tendency to miss sitters when crosses come from the right . 
  also , you 're playing man u wrong . 
  needs more wingers . 
  man u conceded 2 goals in 10 games before your game . 
  that 's some impressive defending . 
  to this day and all days to come still that game is and always will be a fucking disgrace . 
  each 1st of the month take a look at what upcoming matches you have to play , when you have to play them and against what kind of opposition . 
  are the first 3 games easy ? 
  are the last 2 games hard ? 
  are the dates of the matches very close to one another ? 
  are you playing against a particularly good team that is currently on a bad run ? 
  are you playing against a particularly bad team that is currently overachieving ? 
  you should at least have an idea on how you want to play for the month and you should have all 3 tactics ready ; a defensive tactic , a standard/control tactic and an attacking tactic . 
  ** 4-5 ( d ) -1 , 4-2-2 classic and 4-3-3 are popular choices because they all counter one of the other 2 ** which the ai is very fond off . 
  4-5 ( d ) -1 should almost always be used to defend your score ; it 's not a tactic that works well with control/attacking mentality . 
  you 're also going to want your players to be less expressive and use a deep defensive line ; if you 're into specific player instructions ** you can should tweak your cds to have 100 % defensive mentality and 0 % creativity and always have them do zonal marking . 
  ** your dm should almost always be man-marking . 
  on top of that , 4-5 ( d ) -1 should be considered more of a 9-0-1 ( or 7-0-3 if you specifically ask your attacking midfielders to stay forward ) , especially when playing away from home . 
  which most of the time means that a false 9 is not the best suited striker for such a formation . 
  you need a striker that can use his sheer physical abilities , particularly strength and jumping reach . 
  ** a complete forward ** . 
  also good qualities to consider : finishing , long shots , heading , aggression and composure . 
  leadership would be a big plus but not a necessity . 
  you also need ** support wingers ** that have a knack for through balls all the way from deep or ** attacking wingers with terrific crossing ** , dribbling , technique , pace , acceleration , creativity and stamina . 
  all in all , your tactic is decent , good tempo , hassle is present ; it just needs less creativity from the players , less roaming and a better spear up-front . 
  i 'm sorry for the long wall of text ; feel free to discuss my points . 
  you are correct . 
  do note that weaker foot training takes up a lot of points from his maximum pa , points that you could spend into what i mentioned in the comment above . 
  it 's fairly clear that you need to put this young man on a severely easier training schedule until you give him enough playing time on the field to build his fitness . 
  his natural fitness is 9 for god 's sake . 
  player stakes are common in south america . 
  basically the agent wants to buy 15 % of what he assumes will value more once you develop said player . 
  it 's an investment of sorts . 
  if the player fails , you 've got 300k to invest in short-term goals . 
  if the player succeeds , you 've given away 15 % of the value you 're going to sell your player for in the future and you got an injection of 300k to invest in short-term goals . 
  15 % stake is roughly 5m if value of said player is 33.4 m. 
  for more details i suggest you take a closer inspection on the real-life deal that barcelona made with santos for neymar . 
  i ca n't give you an exact number right now but it is believed that neymar 's parents ( or rather their company ) owned a 70 % stake in neymar . 
  it does n't affect who the player plays for . 
  keep in mind that his value is based off of his attributes and ca , while his actual sale value ( hidden ) is based off of his pa and performances . 
  since the club is looking to drop off wages , they will sell at the value of the player and not his actual sale value . 
  it 's also fairly possible that the player himself requested a transfer as he feels he deserves to be in a better team in which the sell will be at the value based off of his attributes and ca . 
  you 're still playing man u wrong . 
  just kidding , good job mate . 
  now it 's time to move on to some challenges . 
  may i suggest working on players from within your academy if you 're unwilling to end your current save ? 
  oh and i need pics . 
  loads of pics . 
  tactics used , match report of cl final , your best player ( s ) , etc. 
  great screenshots , thank you . 
  minor suggestion : when defending corners , you should have your dr mark the near post and your dl mark the far post ( you have them the other way around ) . 
  30 goals in 36 games is more than * alright * . 
  here 's the problem with lower divisions though . 
  clubs tend to have shit coaches and the facilities are worse . 
  so you ca n't improve your player through sheer training nor do you want to spend that long of a time in skrill premier just so your player will score an absurd amount of goals . 
  ** 9 out of 10 times you 're gon na need a new striker for league 2 anyway . 
  ** skrill premier and below tends to be much more physical whereas league 2 and above tend to be more technical . 
  your best bet would be to take a closer look at your tactics and ** toy with specific player settings ** , particularly in the final third . 
  set your midfielders to ** attempt through balls often ** ; set your striker to ** run from deep , move into channels ** , never attempt long shots . 
  ** your best formation in this scenario would be 4-5 ( a ) -1 with no players attempting long shots and setting your striker as target man . 
  in the cm era , value used to go up and down every week . 
  nowadays ( from what i 've seen ) , the value goes up and down every 3 or 4 months and ( as far as i can tell ) it 's done regardless of form ; ** it 's the fact that you play him that makes him seem worth more . 
  ** in reality , his actual sell value is hidden and it 's probably even higher than you anticipate . 
  you know those transfers where the value of a player is 3.5 m but every team seems to offer a very specific 12.3 m ? 
  that 's hidden sell value and that 's the one the ai uses when buying and selling players ( as long as the player did not request a transfer or the club really wants to sell ) . 
  let 's take messi as an example . 
  he 's worth ~ 40m at the start of every save yet his hidden sell value is somewhere at ~ 260m . 
  that hidden sell value does drop a fair lot as his age goes on but his ` shown ' value still remains 40-45m until after his prime years . 
  actual ` sell ' value takes a lot into consideration : form , avg . 
  rating , ca , pa , role at the club ( key/first team/backup ) . 
  funny story , i was playing fm12 the other day and chelsea ( played by the ai ) had a lot of injuries in the defense . 
  ivanovic was among the few that were still match fit . 
  his hidden sell value went through the roof to around 380m for a couple of days . 
  as far as i 'm concerned , value is weird in fm but surprisingly realistic . 
  ** it depends entirely on how you want to play said player . 
  ** being a cam i would probably train him to play with either foot as well ; but his attributes will no longer get as awesome as they could have gotten if you had not trained the weaker foot . 
  weaker foot training can add as much as 19 points on the player 's ca out of his total pa. 
  if i were to make an estimation of his ca i would say he 's around 150-160 and being only 19 years of age i would expect his pa to be somewhere around 190 . 
  he 's already a premier league star at 160 ca so from here on out he can only become a legendary player if guided right . 
  check my above comment for potential ppms to consider . 
  ** try finding a coach that is willing to train him the said ppm . 
  much more likely to learn the ppm . 
  ** even if all of them insist that he ca n't achieve said ppm he still has a small chance of achieving it , but first go for ppms that the coaches think that he can learn . 
  or tutor him instead and teach him how to curl the ball . 
  ** edit : ** i 'll reply much slowly from now on , i spent the last 3 hours on here because i was watching chelsea play stoke in the fa cup . 
  good luck !, 
  ** salah move completed **, 
  why you not title right ? 
  and they can probably add a comma after bill . 
  ** the analysis tool is very useful ** in this regard . 
  but it requires you to put some effort into it .
