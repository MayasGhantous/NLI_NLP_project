  for starters , you should play your matches using the ** extensive highlights ** settings . 
  and take note that ** the analysis tool will only show you the results of your tweaks . 
  ** you have to be the one who figures out why your team is not performing optimally . 
  let 's say for example that you 're playing a 4-5 ( d ) -1 with attacking wingers and a poacher . 
  why this particular set up ? 
  because i see people play this formation time and time out and they all make the same mistakes . 
  say you 've just played a match using 4-5 ( d ) -1 and you 've lost 1-0 away . 
  you go and take a look at your analysis tool and it tells you several things :, 
  * you were unable to get many goal scoring opportunities because almost all your attacking came through crosses by your wingers . 
  * you conceded because your central defenders failed to mark the opposing poacher and he scored following a good through ball by one of the opposing midfielders ( likely the playmaker ) . 
  * one or several of your players played particularly poor and you failed to win the match because you did n't : a ) substitute him , b ) move him to the other flank or c ) give him the support needed from one of his nearby teammates . 
  taking all these notes from the analysis tool should help you realize that for one , ** poachers tend to be really shit when getting service from wingers . 
  ** the best optimization would be to bring in inside forwards on your wings and tweak their specific player instructions to express themselves , use a lot of creativity , attempt through balls often and rarely cross the ball . 
  but let 's assume you ca n't bring in inside forwards . 
  you 're left with 2 options : 1 ) get an advanced playmaker who 's really good at through balls , a poacher who 's really good at cutting inside channels ( and optimally could be able to curl the ball into the net ) or 2 ) get a complete forward upfront . 
  someone with good jumping reach , heading , marking , off the ball , strength , stamina and finishing . 
  ** i actually wrote way way more than i initially assumed i would write so i 'll stop for now since this is already a very big wall of text ; but let me know if you would like me to go through the other 2 examples that you can fix using the analysis tool and/or the specific player instructions . 
  ** best of luck !, 
  ** mistake no. 2 **, 
   you conceded because your central defenders failed to mark the opposing poacher and he scored following a good through ball by one of the opposing midfielders ( likely the playmaker ) . 
  ** the good thing about the analysis tool is that ** not only can you see the passes/crosses/shots / mistakes/etc of your players , ** you can also see those stats for the opposing team ** . 
  i find looking at shots/shots on target/blocks particularly useful when deciding what 's currently going wrong with my line of defense . 
  and you can also see the opposing team runs and what players from your team they managed to get past . 
  ** knowing that the enemy striker ** ( let 's assume he 's a poacher in a 4-2-2 formation -- because the ai loves that formation ) ** gets past a particular player often ** means that you either need to a ) sell your player and buy a new defender or b ) give him a specific role in your line of defense that he can work with . 
  let me give you a more specific rundown of b ) . 
  let 's say you noticed your defender is pretty shitty when it comes to poachers . 
  that usually means his marking , anticipation , positioning and pace are below the league average . 
  knowing all this information from the analysis tool as well as his attributes , ** you can make a relatively good opinion that he 's probably more fit to be defender with a stopper role ** instead of a default central . 
  ** noteworthy observations : **, 
  * a central defender with a stopper role can still make mistakes , particularly if his aggression , anticipation and tackling is bad . 
  which means that almost 100 % of the time you 're going to need your other central defender to be a cover defender . 
  someone who has all the abilities necessary to force the opposing poacher into making a mistake ( it requires marking , anticipation , composure , concentration , positioning and pace -- exactly what the stopper is lacking ) . 
  * setting specific player settings for your central defenders can also be very useful . 
  you 're going to want them to play simple passes with little risk , pass short , attempt no through balls or crosses and it 's particularly useful if you give them as little creativity to work with as possible . 
  it 's also very useful to set their mentality to ultra-defensive and have them zonal marking 100 % of the time . 
  * and last but not the least , let 's not forget that ( in my example ) you 're using a 4-5 ( d ) -1 and you have a defensive midfielder that can give your central defenders the much needed support when playing against 4-4-2 formations . 
  there 's not much to say here , you just have to be on your game and notice as soon as possible what the opponent 's best striker is and have him specifically marked by your dm ( instead of zonal marking ) . 
  at this point it would also be a good idea to introduce the `` hassle opponents '' instruction as it works directly with specific man-marking . 
  * also noteworthy that ( as far as i noticed ) if you continuously play this tactic , the ai will attempt playing 4-4-2 diamond to counter your 4-5 ( d ) -1 which is a direct counter to the classic 4-4-2 . 
  ** that 's the end of part 2 . 
  well this is slowly getting out of hand . 
  so much wall of text . 
  ** mistake no. 3 **, 
   one or several of your players played particularly poor and you failed to win the match because you did n't : a ) substitute him , b ) move him to the other flank or c ) give him the support needed from one of his nearby teammates . 
  this is one of the most common mistakes i see and it 's done by everyone . 
  this last mistake is done regardless of formation used ; sometimes the player is just under-performing and there are several key areas that you could pay more attention to :, 
  * first of all you need to know that every player has a hidden attribute known as `` important matches '' and it 's an attribute like any other ( from 1 to 20 ) and it 's exactly what you would expect it to be : some players are simply shit when you 're playing against better opposition , rivals or derby . 
  one real life example that i 'm currently thinking of would be cristian tanase ( plays for steaua bucuresti ) who is widely regarded one of the best wingers in romania yet consistently under-performs irl in european cups as well as when playing for the national team . 
  ** to counter this , you need to use the pre-match conferences as means to reduce stress on your players ** , as well as pep-talking your players into thinking that they should just play their natural game . 
  if that fails , try telling them that you place your faith in them ( it usually works but it all depends on player personality as well as his determination ) . 
  and even after you do all that , there 's that one particular player that will still under-perform . 
  there 's actually a 2nd hidden hidden attribute that no application can read and it 's randomly generated before each game ; it deals with how successful a successful pass would be ( for example ) . 
  do n't quote me on this though since i have n't done much research on this topic either . 
  ** at this point you need to start planning to either substitute your player , move him to the other flank ( and tweak some of your tactical settings accordingly as to reduce playtime ) or offer him additional support from nearby teammates . 
  * moving him to the other flank rarely ever works in lower leagues simply because the players tend to be much more physical there ( instead of technical ) in which case you 're probably better off just substituting your player and be ready to offload him next season . 
  your player is also much less likely to know how to play on the opposing flank if he 's a lower league player . 
  * offering support from nearby teammates can be helpful but keep in mind that it would put a strain on the other aspects that the supporting player has to fulfill in your formation . 
  asking your dm to cover for your dl because the opposing mr does great deep runs against him will be helpful but it will also put a strain on your central defenders . 
  you can also ask your aml to take on a supporting role in the attack instead of an attacking role in which case he 'll stay much more deep and help with marking the opposing mr/mcr but you will have one less man in the attacking third when attempting to spear-head an attack . 
  * finally , you can support your dl by tweaking your tactics in such way that he will get minimum playtime until you can offer him the 45th minute pep-talk to ` chill the fuck out ' even more : force your players to play on the opposing flank , clear the ball to flanks so that your central defenders do n't pass the ball to him , drop deeper so that the opposing mr does n't get in early crosses , etc. 
  ** that 's about it for now . 
  i 'm sorry for this last part , i may have been a little bit hectic ; i 'm very tired , only slept 5 hours yesterday . 
  good luck !, 
  ** holy fuck !, 
  thank you !, 
  my first ever reddit gold !, 
  ** i never expected i would get some , let alone in the football manager subreddit . 
  feel free to let me know how my silly comments helped you on your way to glory ** anytime ** you want !, 
  pictures included !, 
  actually , in less than 24 hours . 
  keep in mind that the advice given to you by your coach is not necessarily good advice , particularly if said coach lacks the attributes required to make a good call . 
  ** and now i 'm going to write my very own opinion in regards to latest fm versions and how newbie-friendly they are and how they should be . 
  i have to say that i 'm slightly disappointed with the steps that si games have taken in recent versions ( that have become complex beyond reason -- which is a good thing ) towards teaching newbies how to play . 
  their idea of introducing the game to newbies are all decent ( tutorials , challenges , fm classic ) , but i feel like , if i were a newbie , i 'd still be taken aback because more than 80 % of the game is left unexplained and you have to get yourself involved with fm guides or spend years stumbling in the darkness until you put two and two together . 
  i 'll bet you anything that 90 % of the fm players do n't understand how each attribute works off of each other . 
  ** right now i 'd say fm12 is the best game in the series in regards to teaching newbies how to play the game . 
  it has a slightly easier to grasp ui , simplified tactics and runs much better on mainstream computers . 
  * they should make a tutorial in which all of your ui is disabled and you slowly unlock each window/setting as the tutorial progresses . 
  they should add little descriptions when you hover over attributes . 
  they should let you know that some attributes are hidden . 
  they should offer important matches and injury proneness as examples . 
  same goes for coaches and they should let the newbies know which attributes are important for which kind of staff role . 
  * they should make a secondary tutorial to walk you through your first team pick , press conference , pep-talks ( and maybe add little descriptions as to why each player is thinking this or that , maybe let everyone know that playing nervously is n't necessarily a bad thing ) and finally , they should show the newbies an example of a tactical decision to turn the match in their favor . 
  ** and that 's that . 
  i feel like this will be a very unpopular opinion already . 
  i have n't played crusader kings ii but i 'm a big fan of dwarf fortress and i remember it took me like a week to watch captnduck 's let 's play series . 
  which was fun but most people would rather play the game themselves if they 're unsure they 'll enjoy the game . 
  i myself do n't watch football manager let 's plays . 
  i tried watching a few once simply because i was too tired to play myself and wanted to see how other people go by their business but football manager is one of those games that are actually boring as a viewer ; to me at least . 
  if you wan na become good at football manager , i 've found that http://www.guidetofootballmanager.com/ is the best site around . 
  * it explains everything to you in detail , while also letting you make up your own mind in regards to how you should run your own team . 
  it does n't impose a certain view , it does n't impose that you should scout players with the player search feature but instead even let 's you know that if you truly want to simulate the world you should probably let your scouts do their jobs and it certainly does n't impose on you that you should play a certain formation to be successful . 
  way too often i see people recommending to others `` download a tactic from the internet '' . 
  you 're never going to learn how to play the game if you mindlessly do stuff just because it works well . 
  ** post the following screenshots , if possible : **, 
  * team instructions and formation . 
  * player instructions for gk , dl , dcl , dcr , dr. 
  * attributes for gk , dcl , dcr , st. 
  seriously . 
  i do n't think i 've ever seen the guy not smile .
