  i ca n't wait to see how moyesey implements juan mata . 
  i wish him all the best ^ when ^ he 's ^ not ^ playing ^ against ^ us . 
  ( assertive ) unlucky boys , it just was n't our day . 
  i 'll believe it when i see it on the official page . 
  why would they loan chicharito ? 
  he wanted you to offer him a better contract . 
  but you made it clear to him right away that you were willing to let him go so he left for a lesser club that offered him a better salary . 
  he has a dying mother , a gold-digging wife and 5 kids that want more than their hard-working daddy can give them [ .

  ** source : ** my imagination . . ^ except ^ that ^ first ^ sentence . 
  i myself just started a new challenge in fm12 . 
  i downloaded the english pyramid database down to the 10th level and edited it to create the worst possible club in the history of football in one of the 10th level divisions . 
  * chairman attributes are all 1 ( including board/fan confidence and ca/pa ), 
  * tickets to a home-game cost 1 $ and a season-ticket costs 15 $ . 
  * club starts with no staff , players and has 0 $ in the bank . 
  * club reputation starts at 1 . 
  club is amateur . 
  * youth facilities are non-existant and training facilities is set at 1 . 
  * stadium capacity is 50 and club estimated value is 2.5 k. 
  ** notes : ** chairman constantly bitches about selling the club , my regens are constantly leaving for other clubs , my income is close to 0 , my expenses are roughly 1000 a month . 
  ** challenge : ** only bring in players that your scouts/assistant have scouted . 
  only allowed to purchase players by yourself from within the league using the player stats window in the league window or if you have played against said player in a recent match or been linked with him in the press . 
  ** observations : **, 
  * club can become semi-professional but it takes a long time before the chairman wants to do so and on top of that all my current chairman wants to do is sell the club . 
  for one , i need a new chairman . 
  * reputation is set as 1 but it increases slowly each june . 
  ticket prices increase as well after the first season but very slowly . 
  * your first stadium improvement will be done after your very first season and will cost you 1m $ , 10 points in the league and you will have to repay the bank for around 1.6 k a month for 40 years or something like that . 
  ** so there 's my challenge . 
  feel free to copy/use it or whatever you want to do with it . 
  i attempt this challenge every year ever since fm08 and so far i always give up half-way through because the finances stay in the dump for decades . 
  not necessarily but it 's true for most cases . 
  some players actually want to play at a higher level and it 's all dependent on your club reputation . 
  in your case however , i 'm sure that he just wanted better wages . 
  players tend to do that when they outperform the opposition constantly ; they tend to realize their ability far outshines their weak salary . 
  ** how to test this theory : ** next time you have a player that tells you he wants to go to a better club to fulfill his ambitions , offer him a new contract . 
  you will notice his current wage is say 30.000 $ ( for example ) and he wants an improved contract worth 120.000 $ -- because his performances tell him he has become a key player for your team and that he performs well enough to carry said team to a cl spot . 
  sometimes the new wages the player asks for are so huge that he will outright reject your offer to sign an improved contract with him because he knows you ca n't afford said wages . 
  so he moves on to an under-performing club that can afford said wages ( and perhaps even have a better club reputation ) -- cagliari . 
  i actually only allow myself to personally search for the assistant manager . 
  i leave the rest of the staff searching to my assistant and , oh boy , the guys he suggests me to hire . 
  just . . no . 
  ** best tip for this : ** hire the recommendations that follow this criteria : young staff with +15 determination even if their other attributes are shit . 
  give them time , they 'll actually become decent staff in a decade . . or so . 
  i took a look for you in the editor and i only came up with the ** far-fetched theory ** that the game is somehow hard-coded in such a way that ac milan is unwilling to leave san siro for as long as inter milano want to keep playing there as well . 
  there 's a ** 5 % chance ** that 's true and about a 60 % chance that the board would much rather buy san siro from the city of milan ( the current owners ) and extend the capacity of the stadium rather than build a new stadium altogether . 
  the stadium can be expanded to around 105k seats , i believe . 
  ** do n't quote me on this ** last part though , pure speculation on my part using my previous experience with stadium expansions . 
  ** hello fellow fm player , let 's see if i can help you get you started on your way to glory . 
  for now , we 're going to take it easy and i 'm going to give you a couple of notes and fixes based on what you wrote in your original post . 
  feel free to reply with anything you need help with and we can take it from there . 
  ** notes : **, 
  * 4-5 ( d ) -1 is a defensive formation . 
  you actually do have a pretty impressive attacking setup up-front ( at least they 're not wingers ) but by the sound of it , your striker is under-performing ; and i 'm not a big fan of bbm midfielders but we 'll get to that in the ` how to fix : ' section of my post . 
  * you 're playing a ** single ** poacher up-front yet you 're asking your team to work the ball into the box . 
  it would work well enough but your other touchline instructions , like for example ` look for overlap ' , directly counters some of your other tactic choices . 
  ` look for overlap ' makes your full-backs be more attack-minded which in turn makes you concede more often ( particularly from the wings ) . 
  and as if it ca n't get any worse , ` look for overlap ' also means your full-backs will attempt crosses often . . which is your ** only ** poacher 's bad department . 
  poachers tend to have poor attributes in the heading , jumping reach and strength department . 
  they will fail to receive the ball from most crosses . 
  * ( almost ) never play out of defense . 
  ` play out of defense ' is a possession tactic , which a team like blackburn rovers just ca n't pull off . 
  they are one of the worst teams in the championship , any team will apply the proper pressure to force your defenders into a mistake causing you to concede stupid goals . 
  * ` run at defense ' also puts a strain on your defensive abilities , because it forces your midfielders and strikers to run with the ball more often , causing your players to pass less often as well as make ` decision ' mistakes often . 
  ** how to fix most of these problems : **, 
  * you have a poacher up-front and 2 inside forwards . 
  you should toy with specific player instructions and force them to rarely cross , rarely attempt long-shots and always try to look for through balls . 
  oh and since we 're on the topic of specific player instructions , ask your central defenders to have 0 creativity and an ultra-defensive mentality . 
  * you were pretty close with your ` work in the box/look for overlap/run at the defense ' tactic but it just does n't work with a poacher and a team that ca n't control the pace of the match . 
  ** try this for a change : ` work the ball in the box/play through the defense/get the ball forward ' . 
  ** -- it makes your players attempt through balls often , long-shots rarely and forces ( albeit not always ) the poacher to run with the ball until he reaches the box . 
  he should be able to outpace the defense . . unless he 's truly shit . 
  * try playing your midfielders as bwm . 
  see if they perform better . 
  they might or they might not but i have yet to witness a bbm that truly shines in a team that ca n't control the possession . 
  and set one of your central midfielders to perform the role of the playmaker ( while still being a bwm ) . 
  * always focus on teamwork during pre-season . 
  only focus on the other aspects of training 2 or 3 days ahead of a match and always change back to teamwork after each game if you can bother enough to maximize training focus . 
  * you should give the classic 4-4-2 a try since it sounds like you 're new to the game . 
  poachers tend to perform better if they have a partner up-front . 
  and it 's the best formation for newbies . 
  it can be molded both defensively as well as aggressively . 
  ** that 's about it for now . 
  feel free to ask me for any other tips or let me know how my tips work out for you . 
  i 'll get back to you as soon as i can . 
  good luck !, 
  itt : people selling their country short . 
  we would n't be us if it were n't so . 
  ** i came to like chelsea during their ranieri days , long before the glory came . 
  you see , i used to be a one-man follower and i 'm a romanian . 
  i supported the team that adrian mutu played for . 
  he was already very big in romania when he signed with chelsea . 
  he was the most promising player in the post - ` romanian golden era ' in football . 
  chivu had not yet become the defender that was a couple of years ago . 
  what is this ` romanian golden era ' i 'm talking about ? 
  it 's a bit hard to explain in just a couple of words . 
  it 's a very long story but the gist of it is that football is a very important culture in our country and it 's all because of communism . 
  when communism took over romania , in 1965 , football and the romanian national team in particular , were one of the very few things that would make us cheer while watching tv . 
  other than football , the only things that were broadcasted during the communism days were the news , the national hymn and every now and then a speech from ceausescu himself , letting us know that the country is taking big steps in becoming a better country . 
  and for over 4 decades it went like this until some men put some bullets into him .
