  you 've still got : jax , nasus , renekton , garen , pantheon that can tank and snowball the game . 
  if that would have been a corner kick he would have undershot it . 
  nu stiu ce este * touch-type * , am o tastatura no name ( media-tech ) si n-am incercat in viata mea sa invat sa scriu rapid . 
  why does it have to be a knock up ? 
  yeah , okay , that makes more sense . 
  but if you want to carry your games you 're gon na have to play snowball champions with good roaming potential . 
  think a-la-kassadin-mid-lane . 
  that 's exactly why he gets banned +90 % of the time . 
  his roaming ability on top of his snowballing abilities makes him one of the most overpowered champions currently in the game . 
  same reason why xerath is currently a ban ; people have n't learned how to deal with the huge range on his ultimate . 
  finally , proc does n't mean what you ( or perhaps yasuo ) think it means . 
  it means chance on hit . 
  or rather '' ** p ** rogrammed ** r ** andom ** oc ** urrence '' . 
  proc has n't been a league of legends stat since dodge was dropped back in s1 . 
  6 assists and a movi . . er . . goal .

  bazata pe realitate , adaptata pe pelicula incredibil . 
  it 's a 50/50 , you either love it or you hate it . 
  loads of naked scenes . 
  go fuck yourself san diego . 
  as a fellow romanian , let me tell you that dan petrescu , while a good manager , will probably never get the job . 
  he has a very distinct body language that reeks of inability to gain the respect of his players , particularly if said players are superstars . 
  i know you put a lot of effort into this and i do n't want to take anything away from it but , to me personally , this ca n't even be classified as a tangential theory . 
  you may as well write about the ozymandias poem recently popularized by breaking bad and still somehow connect it to a song of ice and fire . 
  if we 're talking about truly unimportant characters , then it has to be weasel . 
  the girl who lived . 
  tune in to / r/soccer tomorrow evening after the match with galatasaray . 
  interesting defending there , terry . 
  no he was n't . 
  just like david , it 's his fault he rushed to the final two thirds of the game when the first third had n't even started . 
  this is not chess . 
  you do n't have control over your pieces and you do n't automatically know the value of each piece . 
  he misread everything , blinded by his self-confidence . 
  he should have kept david around but he let garrett decide his vote for him . 
  that being said , i think he can still come out of this somehow . 
  he genuinely seems like someone who can figure out how to survive a fatal mistake . 
  diamond rings . 
  it 's not an interview per say -- it 's more of a conversation on subjects that the guest and ferguson are interested in . 
  you can see him tearing apart his ` notes before the ` interview ' begins . 
  it 's a refreshing take on q&a 's but i can see why it would n't be your cup of tea . 
  swoooooooooooooon . 
  i do n't know what happens next season but whatever happens next season will happen in louisiana . 
  that or hbo romania fucked up when they ` translated ' the name of the series ( detectives from louisiana ) . 
   the only * optimistic thing he said in the whole show . 
  ftfy . 
  because girls like it when a man has more than 6 packs . 
  humans are not the only self-aware species . 
  although there is no way to be 100 % sure , to test this out you can put certain animals in front of a mirror and see if they recognize themselves . 
  dogs , elephants and primates are known for recognizing themselves whereas insects , cats and other animals do n't ( yet ? ) . 
  on top of that , it 's a silly thing to say that humans are the only species that understands love when there is so much contrary evidence . 
  dogs in particular are known to get really sad if their master dies or abandons them . 
  you can find such experiments on youtube . 
  they 're very interesting . 
  i ca n't speak of ` the presence of the holy spirit ' -- as i myself have never felt such presence -- but the consensus about being different from other creatures stems from the fact that we as a species have developed intelligence faster than any other species on earth . 
  many believe we did so because we started cooking our meals -- thus providing better proteins for our bodies . 
  and do n't mistake spoken language for intelligence . 
  dogs/elephants and primates all possess similar traits to our ancestors of a few million years ago . 
  we , as a species , began talking about 150 to 350 thousand years ago . 
  most animals , at this current stage of their evolution , do n't have the proper mouth/throat/lips . 
  dogs for example can understand words but they ca n't speak them . 
  other species ( like parrots ) can speak them but they lack the intelligence to know what they 're saying . 
  finally , there are some animals that actually do have their own language ( dolphins/whales ) . 
  asa ma gandeam si eu dar poza nu include 2007 .

  at this point , anything really .

  funny guy here !, 
  thanks for the info . 
  i 'm only able to give you my humble opinion . 
  there have been players in the past that have gotten ** ` the winner edit ' ** and then fell short at the end . 
  see jonathan penner in survivor : philippines and russell hantz in survivor : samoa . 
  they were such massive players during their seasons that it was impossible not to give them said edit . 
  that being said , there have also been players that have gotten said edit and went on to win the game . 
  it 's very visible when the editors have to give the winner enough air time but do n't have the necessary material because said player played an under the radar game . 
  you will notice loads of confessionals focusing on ` reading the game ' and ` explaining what 's going on around the camp ' . 
  see : john cochran in survivor : blood vs. water and boston rob in survivor : redemption island and possibly lj in survivor : cagayan . 
  but more importantly , try to spot ** ` the fan favorite edit ' ** because that 's who 's going to be on multiple seasons . 
  see : ciera eastin in survivor : blood vs. water or malcolm freberg in survivor : philippines and possibly spencer in survivor : cagayan . 
  you too misspelled wyman manderly . 
  i have been watching survivor since season 13 ; i have even caught up with the first 5 seasons of survivor . 
  -- i was still unable to push through survivor : one world past the 4th or 5th episode . 
  i really enjoyed the one when alex went to see a therapist . 
  it hit close to home . 
  once upon a time , all the way back in 2012 , we were on a champions league run that nobody ( not even some of us ) thought we 'd win . 
  / u/octachaz decided to post a thread in here in which he mentioned he was going to wear his lucky 1983 chelsea kit and that we were going to win . 
  we had to score 4 goals . 
  ... the rest is history .
