  it 's currently unknown how the show will reveal to daenerys that jorah betrayed her for a pardon but it 's likely that it will happen by the end of this season . 
  jorah 's redemption arc should begin somewhere around mid/late in season 5 . 
  there 's plenty of time till then . 
  do n't quote me on this but i recall during a tyrion chapter in a clash of kings that joffrey boasts about killing some cats/dogs with his latest gold-gilded crossbow . 
  hopefully my memory is still intact , i have n't read acok since mid 2011 . 
  if i recall right , in the books the fight happens on a rainy night and jaime ambushes ned while he 's traveling by horse with his close-guard . 
  he 's not able to do much as his horse is killed by a random lannister soldier and the horse falls and takes ned with him , unable to break free of the horse 's weight and injuring his leg in the process . 
  oh man , now i want to read a game of thrones again . 
  unlike most valyrian swords , ice was a ceremonial sword . 
  ned was using it specifically for executions . 
  nowhere in the books is it said that ice was used for combat . 
  it 's unknown why ned took the sword to king 's landing but it 's likely that he was planning on being a hand of the king for a long time and/or execute criminals himself . 
  that is correct . 
  [ affc cersei ] ( #b `` i gathered from cersei 's monologues that she used to be a lot like sansa when she was younger , incest aside , and that robert drove her away with his love for lyanna . '' ), 
  realized this was a strong possibility about 38 minutes in . 
  i enjoyed the episode and i particularly enjoyed the ending . 
  it seemed a lot like the show was trying to tell the viewers that they wo n't take the romantic drama side of the show very seriously but that they will still toy around with it for the casual viewer 's pleasure . 
  also , i said it last episode and i 'll say it again : finn polmar is a god damn great addition to the cast . 
  the dude 's a fookin legend and you do n't even know his name ? 
  what kind of a fan are you ? 
  the tv show is taking too much liberties . 
  i will seriously reconsider watching the show if f i see stannis smile . 
  took me a second to recall who the fuck yara was . 
  i think the chain will be used to break something else . 
  ok so , bran ( don ) stark is the son of eddard ` ned ' stark and catelyn stark n\u00e9e tully . 
  he used to like climbing but some douchebag threw him off one of the towers he was climbing . 
  anyway , fastforward a couple of years and he 's past the wall with a blond kid hallucinating trees and they 're trying to go talk to one specific tree . 
  hope that covers it . 
  but in all seriousness : the blond kid is jojen reed and he , his sister meera and bran are looking for the three eyed raven that bran dreamed about in late season 1 . 
  jojen has the ` greenseeing ' ability that allows him to see certain visions into the future , including the path that bran must take to reach the three eyed raven . 
  it goes without saying that he , and possibly bran , are baked off of their fucking minds . 
  anyway , bran and co. managed to slip past the wall in late season 3 through one of the unmanned castles around the wall . 
  there are 19 castles defending the wall if i recall right , out of which only 3 are currently manned . 
  during their slip past the wall they came face to face with sam and gilly . 
  and that about covers everything . 
  oh , and the white trees are the old gods that the northmen pray to . 
  in the books it 's mentioned a lot of times that , before his fall , he wanted to become a knight and get all the girls and shit . 
  basically he wanted to become somebody noteworthy and perhaps even have his own legendary legacy like every brandon before him . 
  you see , historical brandons are very famous in the north . 
  some became famous for creating large fleets , others for burning said large fleets and some are known for building some 700-feet wall that it is said to guard the realm of men . 
  all of them fooking legends , of course . 
  anyway , all the way back in a clash of kings ( season 2 ) , after winterfell was sacked by ramsey snow and injured maester luwin in the process , luwin , while dying , suggested that bran and his little brother rickon split up in order to protect the stark legacy . 
  it took some convincing from jojen but in the end he convinced bran to try and find the three eyed raven far off beyond the wall . 
  rickon went off with osha . 
  ** note : ** i have a very good memory but keep in mind that i have last read the books 3 years ago and there 's no mention on why bran decided to take up on jojen 's word . 
  ** joffrey ** - for ordering ilyn payne to execute eddard stark . 
  ** cersei ** - for ordering the arrest and imprisonment of eddard stark . 
  ** walder frey ** - for slaughtering rob stark , catelyn stark , grey wind and robb 's loyal banner men . 
  ** meryn trant ** - for killing syrio forel , the first sword of braavos . 
  ** tywin lannister ** - for being the principal opponent to robb 's war and also for ordering the torture of many farmers , wives and children at harrenhal . 
  ** the red woman ** - show only addition to arya 's death list because she took gendry away to dragonstone . 
  ** berric dondarrion ** - show only addition to arya 's death list . 
  can not recall why . 
  ** thoros of myr ** - show only addition to arya 's death list . 
  can not recall why . 
  ** ilyn payne ** - for executing eddard stark and for taking ice as his own after ned 's death . 
  ** the mountain ** - the hound 's brother , for the torture of many farmers , wives and children at harrenhal . 
  ** the hound ** - the mountain 's brother , for killing mycah , arya 's friend in early season 1 . 
  the article is full of spoilers all the way through book 5 . 
  i would stay away from it if i were a tv show viewer . 
  let me redirect you [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/24r2cf/tv_spoilers_recap_of_who_is_on_aryas_list_and_why/ch9ub3t?context=3 ) . 
  it 's the first name she says . 
  they are currently unaware that joffrey is dead . 
  of course karl owned him . 
  he used to be a fooking legend in gin alley . 
  [ affc minor spoilers - that are unlikely to make it to the show !, 
  ] ( #b `` robin ( actually robert , after robert baratheon -- changed in the show to avoid confusion ) is the only born child of lysa tully and jon arryn . 
  lysa tully had previously miscarried several children of his to the point that she begun thinking that she was getting poisoned by ` enemies ' . 
  before her marriage to jon arryn however , she did indeed sleep with littlefinger several times and she once got pregnant . 
  she told her father about the pregnancy in hopes that this will make him let her wed littlefinger , who was of low birth . 
  however her father was intending on marrying her off to jaime lannister so he had her abort the child and sent littlefinger away . 
  and the rest , as they say , is history . '' ), 
  you should read the books man . 
  i would go as far as to say they are 10 times as good as the show and i fucking love every scene of the show . 
  yes . 
  i felt like jay brought up a good point that i rarely ever see mentioned . 
  who 's jeremy ? 
  i 'm specifically talking about the part where he says that he did n't chose to be uncomfortable regarding mitchell 's sexuality and that he was born this way . 
  i feel like that 's an underplayed point in real life . 
  what jay meant is that he was born ( grew up ) in a period where the world was homophobic . 
  he was taught that homosexuality is a sin . 
  by his parents . 
  by his community . 
  by his religion . 
  these kind of things hold sway on a person 's mind even long after they 've wisened . 
  you people are dreaming if you think jay can and will ever become 100 % okay with homosexuality . 
  but he 's trying . 
  he 's trying real hard . 
  the guy who said it fails should definitely do a casual ama . 
  he 's still active !, 
  that does n't sound right . 
  a match made in heaven . 
  i 'll take a stab in the dark :, 
  manchester scored 15 minutes in , equalized by everton 2 minutes later . 
  manchester scores again after 32 minutes , equalized by everton 8 minutes later . 
  manchester scores after 42 minutes . 
  everton is expected to equalize but they instead concede another after only 2 more minutes . 
  half-time . 
  manager goes `` we can make a comeback !, 
  we have to !,
