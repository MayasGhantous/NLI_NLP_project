  for glory !, 
  '' , changes tactics and formation to attacking , despite being away from home and despite having already conceded 4 . 
  everton go on to concede 5 more during the 51st , 62nd , 64th , 76th and 89th minute because the manager is stuck in his way . 
  such is life in football manager . 
  close enough . 
  * / rant * on * . 
  the episode was a poorly written ` setup episode ' to try and make everything happen at the same time in the season finale . 
  for one , i do n't find it in peter 's character to fall so easily for the flirtatious sides of an intern . 
  it would take a little bit more character deconstruction before peter is in the position to cheat on alicia again . 
  and diane 's ordeal with kenning is either boring or just poorly written . 
  i found kenning to be a great supporting character but ever since becoming a recurring character he 's been mostly just annoying that plots things just to show the viewers that diane is growing as a character , following will 's death . 
  ** p.s. 
  ** : i still enjoyed the episode and eli was top notch as always . 
  all in all , 6/10 . 
  you overshot because you gave bill kerman too much delta v . you are supposed to do a small correction to a delta v and let time take it 's course . 
  do n't worry , most of us did the same mistakes the first time around as well . 
  i remember my first time mun landing . 
  i did n't even think to put my spaceship in mun 's orbit . 
  i just went straight at it and spent way too much fuel to re-correct the speed that i was going at the mun with . 
  i do n't want to talk about it . 
  ** step 1 : ** launch your ship as a straight arrow . 
  ** step 2 : ** give it a 45 degree inclination at 15000m altitude . 
  ** step 3 : ** wait until your solid fuel has finished burning . 
  ** step 4 : ** look for ways to achieve a munar flyby . 
  ** step 5 : ** timewarp for an hour or two . . or three . 
  ** step 6 : ** re-correct the flyby until you have an apoapsis of ~ 40000m . 
  ** step 7 : ** start burning for retrograde as you 're about to reach the apoapsis . 
  ** step 8 : ** achieve munar orbit of ~ 40000m . 
  stop burning . 
  * note : * this is a great way to ensure you land wherever you want . 
  ** step 9 : ** start burning retrograde when you 're ready to land on the mun . 
  ** step 10 : ** stop burning fuel when you 're on course of crashing into the mun . 
  ** step 11 : ** maintain your speed until you 're about 12000m above ` the sea ' . 
  * note : * the iva has a great tool : a built-in altimeter ( height above ground ) . 
  ** step 12 : ** start burning retrograde until you achieve a speed of 50m/s . 
  ** step 13 : ** use the iva and check your altimeter . 
  ** step 14 : ** wait until it indicates you 're less than 3000m above the ground . 
  ** step 15 : ** turn landing gears on and burn retrograde until you achieve vertical landing . 
  ** step 16 : ** make sure you have a maximum speed of 9.9 m/s as you 're about to land . 
  ** step 17 : ** land safely and begin performing science !, 
  ** feel free to ask away if there 's anything left unclear . 
  and the breaks would probably not be on . 
  very seriously , who ? 
  i have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  / serious, 
  in romania we do n't get to learn much about astronomy . 
  in schools the only time we get to the surface of astronomy is during the first 2 lessons that actually covers geography for the remainder of the year . 
  in about 5 minutes we 're told the universe is 13.7 billion years old , that the earth was formed 4.5 ** b ** illion years ago , that the sun is a star and earth and 8 !, 
  other planets are orbiting around it . 
  without even having the time to process the information or ask questions about it , the lesson quickly moves forward to orbital revolution , a small tidbit about the moon and then it 's all about seasons , plains , hills , mountains , lakes , rivers , oceans and so forth . 
  i have made it my mission to inform my friends small trivia facts about our solar system ( and the universe ) whenever the subject makes a flyby . 
  mostly because one such friend was adamant that `` falling stars '' are , well , falling stars -- on motherfucking earth . 
  oh and there 's no way those other stars are bigger than the sun . 
  i mean , look at the size of it !, 
  all in all , at least in romania pluto is not like to be forgotten . 
  for what its worth , i for one laughed hard . 
  haha , it 's just a typo guys . 
  i did n't bother to read what i wrote before submitting my comment . 
  i was more focused on trying to make a ` flyby ' joke happen somewhere in the comment . 
  basically , come next season , arsenal are fucked . 
  none other than the guy who made sam the slayer . 
  what the fuck are you doing here if you 're not a book reader . 
  have you seen win win with paul giamatti ? 
  i found it to be exactly like that . 
  i think you are very close to what will happen but both tony and kass have made it abundantly clear that they will take each other to the final 2 . 
  i am about to begin my very first dwarf fortress adventure in over 2 years . 
  i 've last played the 0.31 version ; i did play the 0.34 version for like an hour when it was released but it was riddled with bugs . 
  i 'm expecting the latest version to be released in mid 2014 so i want to catch up with everyone else as i think this will finally be the version that strings things together . 
  the world is generating as we speak . 
  [ take a look !, 
  i 'm expecting to play the game for the entire day as the weather outside is really shit . 
  it 's 6 am ; the fort will go down by the end of the day !, 
  wish me luck !, 
  ** edit : wait , what ? 
  did i just get gold ??? 
  how can i repay this kindness ? 
  4 hours in , i 'm doing fairly well but i 'm constantly keeping the game in pause mode so i can get re-familiarized with everything . 
  i went with an easy temperate forest biome . 
  not much evil ( except humans with the heads and wings of mosquitos ) but i 'm expecting goblins in the early spring of year 2 . 
  i have no army yet and as all starks know : winter is coming . 
  * is there any way to assign a specific item to a specific dwarf ? 
  is there any way to remove a specific item from a specific dwarf ? 
  i 'm asking for military purposes . 
  * some error messages do n't seem to show anymore like they used to in 0.31 -- any way to put them back on ? 
  they were helpful in knowing what i was and was not producing . 
  it 's hard to notice when a specific dwarf is idling . 
  * fishing seems slower than i recall . 
  am i just imagining this ? 
  i never have more than 10 fish in my food stock . 
  should i simply assign more dwarfs to fishing ? 
  neither did op . 
  the lyrics are quite good in my opinion but the chorus fucking kills it . 
  11/10 would do him . 
  and with his dying breath he said : `` four '' `` four '' `` fucking '' `` two '' . 
  give a round of applause for harry redknapp ladies and gentlemen . 
  i 'm actually surprised by the fact that not all of those spoilers are true . 
  they `` hacked '' the mod team . 
  the chronicles of narnia are books . 
  they have been finished since 1954 . 
  so tell me , would you rather have a father that is always there but does n't quite get you or would you have a father that shows up twice a year and takes you to the titties ?
