  well in that case , pre-production for the latest movie begun at the end of 2013 , for more than 3 years they had a legal dispute over some bullshit so they did n't know wtf to do with the series . 
  you can read more about it on wikipedia , informative stuff man . 
  how come nobody said martin lawrence ? 
  okay so , i just tried out this ` fifa world ' thingy after facebook decided to ` suggest ' me something that i will surely like . 
  turns out it would be an enjoyable experience if the game was n't riddled with ancient programming . 
  * you are unable to change the key bindings to something you are more comfortable with . 
  this is particularly annoying as i play fifa with personalized keys . 
  i simply can not be arsed to be familiarized with these specific buttons . 
  who the hell runs on space ? 
  q is the way . 
  * you ca n't run diagonally . 
  sometimes it works , sometimes it does n't . 
  i have a feeling it works only when you already run towards the goal and you press up/down but you ca n't press left/right anymore because programming ca n't handle this many keys getting pressed . 
  like . . 3 . 
  * for unfamiliar players , the game can be riddled with questions -- specifically what some of the cards do and how the fuck can you raise the chemistry of the team and what not . 
  ** all in all , i would love to revisit the game in a year or so when they fixed most of these problems and make the game more similar to the classic series . 
  ** thanks for letting me know there 's a workaround the key bindings . 
  the game is much more enjoyable when i actually can remember what keys i want to press . 
  so here 's some additional bugs you guys can work on !, 
  * transfers sometimes expire before they reach the 0h0m0s mark ( i 've seen it happen around the 0h0m18s mark -- i won the bid and i did not use the buyout option ) . 
  * you are forced into a draw if an opponent leaves the game as soon as the game starts . 
  not exactly a bug but i do n't see why something that i have no control over has to cost me 2 points . 
  * you are forced into a loss after the match ends ( despite leading 2-1 ) if you ca n't get out of the match engine . 
  it will count as a 0-3 forfeit . 
  i triple-checked . 
  not just a visual bug . 
  * howerver this is a visual bug : sometimes the match engine will display silly scorelines if the opponent has forfeit , including `` nil-nil pen '' , `` 0-1 defeat '' ( despite winning ) , etc. 
  * the hub ui does n't respond seamlessly . 
  it 's almost as if it lags sometimes . 
  this is something that you should definitely work on . 
  * you ca n't get rid of the `` tutorial key bindings '' screen on the top right corner and it 's impeding me to see key visual aspects of the game . 
  * player stats screen does n't show all ( or specific ) players . 
  for example koke is nowhere to be found and i have to look at his personal profile in order to see what his player stats are . 
  ** and since i 'm already going full-on feedback on your ass , here 's some things i think it would make the game that much more enjoyable : **, 
  * you ca n't easily change the name of your profile . 
  it seems like you have to go through bullshit security questions but mine are in chinese for some reason -- no i do n't remember selecting chinese when i made the account . 
  * limited time accomplishments . 
  you guys need to add more of these and i think you need to amp the rewards just a little bit . 
  they 're great !, 
  * single player season/tournament are a a great way of becoming better at the game . 
  sometimes the pressure of online play is too much too . 
  good rewards too , i like it . 
  * trading with a player ( human ) . 
  there 's no reason to talk to people let alone add them as friends if ca n't trade them for a specific player in their team . 
  also it would be cool if you could see what the player is already willing to trade . 
  * you need to make the ` league teams ' button more visible . 
  i did n't even notice it for the first 4 hours of playing . 
  ** all in all it 's an enjoyable experience and i will be definitely be playing the game . 
   player stats screen does n't show all ( or specific ) players . 
  for example koke is nowhere to be found and i have to look at his personal profile in order to see what his player stats are . 
  i figured it out . 
  it shows koke as his real name . 
  this should be fixed though , i do n't imagine many people know him by his real name . 
  ** by the way , w/d/l stats from single player should * be separate from the online w/d/l stats . 
  for a second i thought i was reading something pokemon related . 
  [ chinese characters security question ] ( http://imgur.com/mjiqdyx ), 
  ** and thanks for pointing out that you can disable the key assistance during the match . 
  ** i have a feeling the button should be on the controls settings menu instead of the match settings menu . 
  by the way , here 's how much i 've enjoyed your game today :, 
  * [ the legend that is marco ruben ] ( http://imgur.com/n7zqryb ), 
   who needs cr7 when you 've got mr10 . 
  it 's open beta people . 
  there will be stuff that needs addressing , there will be random bugs , there will be unbalanced cards . 
  i for one believe this is a very similar game to league of legends in terms of business-model . 
  * do you know how long it took league of legends to become good after it left open beta ? 
  1 and a half * fucking * years . 
  * oh you want another example since league of legends is a game for kids ? 
  counter-strike : global offensive . 
  do you know how long it took cs : go to become good after it left open beta ? 
  1 and a half * fucking * years . 
  * do you know how long it took minecraft to finally get out of alpha and be released even though it was already considered a ` polished ' game by the majority of the fan base ? 
  that 's right , 1 and a half fucking years . 
  * do you know how long it took world of warcraft to finally become a balanced , good and historic piece of gaming ? 
  no , not 1 and a half * fucking * years . 
  try doubling that amount . 
  that 's right . 
  3 * fucking * years . 
  it 's an mmo , give it a break . 
  it was n't until the burning crusade that the game got pvp balance and became a video gaming icon . 
  it stayed that way for 4 years . 
  now do n't get me wrong , if you look at my history you will see me addressing to fifa world as somewhat disappointing but you have to give credit where it 's due : the game 's future is looking bright if they 're heading where i think it 's heading . 
  * every team has a formation and because of that you should always know where a specific player is , especially if you 're only playing with short passes . 
  if you 're only playing with short passes you will only have a few goalscoring opportunities during the game but your team will be more defensively responsible since they wo n't likely leave their position ( unless your formation 's tactics is free-form ) . 
  * jump into the arena , go to 11v1 mode and start working on your finishing . 
  try to score from crosses with your head , do long shots , do finesse shots , do chip shots . 
  work on it every day . 
  5-10 minutes . 
  you 'd be surprised how fast you can get into it and the next you know it 's dark outside . 
  * after you 're done with finishing or want to work on something else , select 11v2 or 11v3 mode and start doing through balls and chip-through balls so you can get a sense of counter-attacking . 
  * do n't run with your defensive players or pretty much any player if you do n't intend on shooting or dribbling by an opponent . 
  if you run and try to pass , depending on your timing of the pass , it will take you a half-a-second more to pass , time enough for an opponent to dispossess you . 
  * do n't engage attacking players during a counter-attack with your central defenders . 
  central defenders are generally low paced but are really solid at blocking a shot . 
  so instead of engaging on a 1-on-1 situation , keep your defensive player ahead of the opponent striker , anticipate his moves and use the skill moves button ( lt as i recall -- i do n't use the standardized buttons so i could be wrong ) to block a possible shot . 
  if he does n't shot , even better for you , he just failed a counter-attack . 
  * use the mentality button when you need it . 
  there are opponents that you want to play defensive against and other opponents that you want to play offensive against . 
  it all depends on how fast you can read the opponent 's skill . 
  and just because an opponent is better than you , does n't mean that you wo n't beat him . 
  80 % or hell , even 90 % of the player-base only know how to shoot one or two ways .
