  usually finesse shots from close range ( they ca n't even do a proper outside the box finesse shot ) . 
  as soon as you learn how an opponent shoots you can start shutting them down and they 'll be forced into putting more players forward from which you can hopefully spring a counter-attack . 
  christianity fc and only took him 3 days to work a miracle and get them out of the relegation zone . 
  i realize now that time does fly rather fast . 
  it feels like yesterday that we were getting a just-turned-23 juan . 
  i had no idea he would turn out to be so good . 
  i remember he scored on his debut in the 11th minute of stoppage time . 
  that same year he went on to score chelsea 's 6000th league goal and later put a corner up drogba 's head in some final . 
  a year later he went to put another corner up another 's head in another final . 
  what a player we had . 
  and now , let it be known : his prime is coming . 
  you 're one of those people that only enjoy a cast of players if they 're playing the game the way you want them to play . 
  strategic masterminds and the likes . 
  in terms of casting , i found sarah , morgan , lj , jeffra , tasha , trish , spencer , woo and tony enjoyable . 
  especially trish and woo post-merge . 
  kass had her moments ( she is to blame for keeping spencer in the game early on ) but ultimately she created too much bs out of thin air for me . 
  opinions are subjective . 
  so much so that he even said in one of his pre-game inverviews for blood vs. water that he wo n't take his 3rd season seriously either and that he was there only because he wanted to share another part of his life with his girlfriend . 
  or so i recall . 
  shit only got real for him when the culpeppers sent his girlfriend home . 
  you 've clearly not reached division 2 . 
  pacey players will outplay anything , you ca n't dribble through the defense and your attackers are n't likely to pursue attacking runs unless you specifically tell them to do so ( despite having the attacking mentality set on ) . 
  i wish i could relegate back to 4th/5th division until i get the players that are generally seen in the 2nd division . 
  every team has an eto'o , a sturridge or a benzema . 
  if i were op and people actually bothered to upvote and ask me a question i would take the time to reply to everyone . 
  so my question is , why is this cama so shit ? 
  but the real question is : will you gild his comment ? 
  * did you have any friends in highschool ? 
  if no , then why not ? 
  * do you still hang with your highschool friends ? 
  if no , then why not ? 
  * do you have any hobbies ? 
  watching movies and listening to music do n't count if you do n't go to concerts or the cinema . 
  * when is the last time you have tried to make a friend ? 
  why did you give up ? 
  * do you find not having friends as something that makes you less worthy as a person ? 
  * do you have a mustache ? 
  i do n't think i was being a dick for pointing out that you left your own ama without leaving up a note . 
  it 's like i 'm going to see a friend and she turns up 20 minutes late and i 'm the dick for being upset that she could n't manage her time , even though i called her an hour ago saying that i 'll be arriving in exactly 60 minutes and she was okay with it . 
  * do you go to lan parties ? 
  if no , then why not ? 
  * have you thought about opening a blog about the books and movies that you come across and enjoy ? 
  why have n't you done so already ? 
  * do you enjoy basketball or football ? 
  do you enjoy any physical sport ? 
  why the fuck not ? 
  * do you feel you are portraying yourself as anti-social to others when you happen to be in a group of people ? 
  why do you do it ? 
  * do you have a job ? 
  how come you 've not bonded with anyone over your shitty job ? 
  * have you tried growing a mustache ? 
  * why do n't you try organizing a lan party for people of your age with games that you enjoy ? 
  i 'm 22 year old and i organize lan parties whenever i feel like it and i do n't recall anyone in my lan parties being below 18 . 
  * have you tried going to the park and just asking around at ` the football fields ' ( or whatever ) if you can play too ? 
  i 've been going to this particular park for about 2 years now and while i started out really shy and pretty bad at the sport , now everyone sees me coming from 10kms away , calls me silly names , passes me the ball , expects me to open up the opponent 's defense , etc. 
  * are you skinny ? 
  have you thought about going to the gym ? 
  are you ashamed of going to the gym ? 
  it can be surprisingly easy to bond over at the gym -- especially if there are older guys willing to provide you with some starter tips . 
  i do n't think you see how important his 2nd point is . 
  i 've been playing cs : go for about 2 weeks now and i 've finally reached master guardian elite . 
  ** i think i hit my skillcap . 
  what should i begin to work on ? 
  thanks , these links are very helpful .

  ** wrecking ralph ** , the ' i am bad and that is good ' speech . 
  accepting yourself for what you are hit me hard . 
  well to be honest , i have played counter-strike from early 2000 until late 2007 . 
  after that i was playing fifa , world of warcraft and later on league of legends . 
  i played cs : go in 2012 for about a month when it was first released as well but it did n't click with me at the time . 
  i consider myself a pretty successful ** amateur ** gamer ; i ca n't seem to be able to pass a certain skill threshold in games . 
  to answer your question , i think experience . 
  experience has taught me the ** other ** parts that are necessary to be somewhat successful . 
  tactical awareness , patience , positioning , knowing that the enemy is prone to making minor mistakes in their gameplay . 
  and sometimes just being really boss with the awp ; even though i probably could n't hit a standing target with the ak even if i had three hundred bullets . 
  i need to learn aiming , headshots , crosshair placements , pre-firing , nade spots , advanced strats . 
  thank you for pointing them out . 
  experience skill cap is different than knowledge skill cap . 
  knowledge is something that you can actively work on . 
  while i know that i have n't hit my knowledge skill cap ( because it can be taught by simply accumulating experience ) , it would be pretty silly on my part to not ask for help and speed up the process and focus my experience on other key areas of my gameplay .
