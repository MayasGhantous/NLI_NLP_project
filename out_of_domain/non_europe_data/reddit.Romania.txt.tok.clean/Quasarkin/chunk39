  half-life 3 confirmed . 
  instead of letting the game `` make '' you a group of people to play with , you `` premake '' it with friends . 
  and one thing leads to another and you 're losing 3:15 on dust2 to that ` friend of a friend ' who went 7/0 in the first 2 rounds but then finished the game 7/16 . 
  i should probably mention by now that this is in fact a ** true ** motherfucking ** story . 
  also , i would like to add that the movie was made in 1997 . 
  at the time it was not solid fact that the moon held any water . 
  the scientists speculated that water made about 0.1 % of the moon . 
  meanwhile , the temperatures on europa , titan and most celestial bodies that you know about are burning cold . 
  for example , the warmest temperatures go for -160 c on europa and -180 c on titan . 
  i do n't suppose you have an easy/cheap way of getting water out of there . 
  oh , and the lakes that you keep hearing about on different celestial bodies are mostly made out of hydrocarbons ( not water ) . 
  i definitely include nicaragua somewhere in my top 26 . 
  you watched a web series produced in 2009 that stars allison brie . 
  it lasted for about 5 episodes . 
  it was trying to be awful on purpose but it was awful on things that it tried to execute well . 
  the only memorable scene is when allison brie 's cleavage is revealed by another character trying to rip her top off . 
  the . gif can probably be found on / r/alisonbrie and randomly throughout the internet . 
  no player is above the team nor is he the team . 
  manchester united sold cristiano ronaldo to real madrid in 2009 for 94m euros and they still won the premier league twice in the last 5 seasons ( not counting 4 other trophies ) . 
  do n't get me wrong , since frank lampard 's departure he is now at the top of my favorite current chelsea players . 
  every time he touches the ball it feels like i 'm watching a legend in the making . 
  i remember his first 3 matches in blue , he got us a penalty in each one of them and later on provided the assist for lampard 's record-breaking goal . 
  these things have been written down in our history . 
  now i 'm not saying we should sell hazard . 
  but if it 's 100m euros we 're talking about it would be silly not to at least consider it . 
  there are areas in which we could definitely use some strengthening ; and we 've got a shit ton of amazing attacking midfielders . 
  your mom 's overrated . 
  you know what i find amazing ? 
  that we 've had so many ** legends ** in such a small time span :, 
  ** jose mourinho , petr cech , marcel desailly , roberto di matteo , dennis wise , gianfranco zola , jimmy floyd hasseilbaink , ei\u00f0ur gu\u00f0johnsen , john terry , frank lampard , didier drogba . 
  how many clubs can say the same ? 
  off of the top of my head , these are the catchphrases that you missed ( i know this is just part 1 of 2 ) :, 
  * ** indeed . 
  * ** suit up !, 
  ** - barney , how i met your mother, 
  * ** true story . 
  ** - barney , how i met your mother, 
  * ** we have to go back !, 
  ** - jack , lost, 
  * ** waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaalt !, 
  ** - michael , lost, 
  * ** engage . 
  ** - jean luc picard , star trek : the next generation, 
  * ** hodor . 
  ** - hodor , game of thrones, 
  started out about 4 days ago . 
  i started out with 4x06 window of opportunity first because , well , it 's the best episode of the series . 
  i just about finished 1x17 solitudes , great episode featuring my favorite outtake of survivor . 
  the show is simply amazing . 
  i 'm in love with the way the mythology is being created bit by bit in every episode . 
  i love the little tidbits about the way the stargate works , about the goa'ulds , teal ` c , bra ` tac , the nox , the asgards and so on . 
  apophis is hands down the best system lord . 
  and knowing col. maybourne 's arc i ca n't help but have a big smile on my face when he 's on screen . 
  my main concerns right now is if i want to keep watching past the 8th season and if i will stargate atlantis in my watch as well . 
  the first 2 seasons of sga are great with some fantastic characters but after that i felt like the show became flat . 
  i stopped watching the show during the final episodes of season 4 . 
  i have only seen the final episode of season 5 . 
  in any case , this is probably the best tv series i 've ever had the pleasure of watching . 
  i 'm glad it exists . 
  your mom is a meme . 
  this , however , is not . 
  subtle knight, 
   ... not yet . 
  ftfy . 
  caputo made this season for me . 
  i came here to complain about his poor positioning . 
  god dammit . 
  you are correct . 
  it was a joke . 
  i like everyone 's theories but the actual answer is that ai clubs are programmed to assume that once they bid for a player other ai clubs will bid for the player as well . 
  the original ai club really needs the player so they will offer the maximum value that any of the other ai clubs will offer to ensure they get to at least talk to the player . 
  the fifth race . 
  plain and simple as that . 
  chelsea fan here . 
  can confirm mata was not first choice at any point during the season . 
  the [ entire album ] ( http://imgur.com/a/hlsxs ) thanks to / u/321fapfapfap, 
  unlikely . 
  if the earth was to accumulate a similar ring to saturn some time in the past , all the big objects in the ring would have already crashed on earth long time ago and the remainder of objects that make up the ring would be too small to cause any real problems . 
  falling on earth would burn the objects when coming in contact with the atmosphere . 
  ** edit : ** for those unaware , most objects inside the ring would be in the range of a few meters . 
  even if the ring was an issue , all the crashing would be around the equator . 
  given the fact that these rings would have predated mankind , earth 's culture would have taken this into account and not built cities around the equator . 
  that being said , nasa would most likely have an amazing budget so they can build an ` earth 's ring objects tracker ' in order to maintain travel clearance between the hemispheres for different vehicles and air crafts . 
  ** edit 2 : ** oh shit , i just realized there would be so many implications for religion had we have rings like saturn . 
  can you imagine the catholic church going around telling people that the rings are god 's way of shielding us from the great evil ? 
  actually , there would n't even be a catholic church . 
  religions would be entirely different than what we currently have . 
  can you provide any proof for this outlandish claim ?
