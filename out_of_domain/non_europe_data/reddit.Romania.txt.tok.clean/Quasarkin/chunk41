  the amount of time added is decided by the 4th referee ( not on the field ) . 
  the factors to decide the amount of time added is based on : substitutions ( +30 seconds for each substitution ) , faults ( injuries usually add +1 / +2 minutes , harder injuries can add as much as +5 minutes ) . 
  deliberate time wasting by the players like moving the ball around without really building up to any kind of play is generally not counted in here but the referee can stop the play to give warnings or even yellows for unsportsmanlike behavior and time wasting . 
  time wasting is usually attributed to the goalkeepers and are punished by a yellow card . 
  time wasting by the players when the ball is in play is very rarely carded by the referee . 
  i seriously doubt you can win more than 9 points in the group stages . 
  also , the way the ghanians players have been finishing their chances so far seems to point out to a 1-0 win for freedom . 
  penalties are faults and they result in a one-on-one with the goalkeeper from 11 meters ( the dot inside the goalkeeper 's box ) . 
  the player is allowed to pass the ball to anyone he wants but considering no one except the player and the goalkeeper can be inside the penalty box before the ball is touched why do that when he can just shoot at the goal ? 
  before the ball is touched the goalkeeper is not allowed to get closer to the player ( or rather , the penalty spot ) ; he has to stand on the goal line .

  two teams ca n't both be top of the group . 
  only one team is top of the group . 
  the other one is called the runner-up of the group . 
  the winner of your group gets to play with the runner-up of another group while the runner-up of your group plays with the winner the other group . 
  the system is made in such a way that the winner and the runner-up of the group ca n't meet again unless they both make it to the final .

  it 's 3:35 am here , all the way from romania . 
  my english is taking a nap . 
  i meant to say ` foul ' . 
  also , unlike club caps , friendlies count as a cap as well . 
  paging / r/slightlyoffaperfectsave, 
  is n't this what we 're supposed to do here ? 
  plugging / u / _ vargas _ to make sense of all of this . 
  romanian here . 
  i 'm rooting for your tiny country . 
  i think it 's an unspoken requirement for good strikers . 
  they need the right amount of cuntiness to do the things they do . 
  there will always be a few exceptions . 
  i love it too !, 
  since romania did n't qualify for the wc , i had decided to root for the team that pleasantly surprised me the most during the 1st round of the groups . 
  i 'm in love with costa rica ; such an amazing display of football . 
  `` the sheer futility of the match coupled with the irony makes it certain . '', 
  * nationala romaniei nu a mai impresionat de multa vreme . 
  almost as shit as miroslav klose . 
  * you need to have some form of relatability for this movie , i think . 
  most people will relate to it by realizing that they 're going or have gone stale in their past or current romantic relationships . 
  real life is unlike the movies . 
  in real life people do n't ask the right questions when something goes wrong for a quick fix and a happy ending . 
  in real life people awarely or unawarely change themselves for better or for worse ; given a long period of time . 
  blue valentine is not about the ending . 
  at least not entirely . 
  the point is to make you reflect on your choices in life . 
  * in the flashbacks of the movie , the guy ( dean ) is the ` better ' person of the two . 
  despite being a school dropout , he has a stable job and has a pretty interesting outlook on life ( characterized through the conversations with one of his co-workers ) . 
  the girl ( cindy ) is initially characterized as someone who would have cheated on a guy back in her younger days . 
  in her flashbacks she is also pregnant with her ex-boyfriend 's baby which dean decides to take in despite being the only one with an income . 
  * and now , the juxtaposition . 
  during the present time , dean is the one who needs to lean on cindy . 
  he is still working at the same underpaid job , he has long since stopped grooming himself , he is going bald and is having a hard time being a sexy and interesting person for the love of his life . 
  meanwhile , cindy has vastly grown as a person , perhaps partially because of the baby , perhaps partially because she has had a good guy to lean on during her hard times . 
  and she 's still very sexy , her boss is hitting on her , she has a good paying job , yada-yada-yada . 
  but here 's the thing . 
  the part where reality decides to check in . 
  she realizes that she 's tired of dragging her marriage through the dirt when her husband unawarely proves to her that he wo n't ever again be the sexy , interesting , safety net that she fell in love with . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** my subjective view on a movie i did n't enjoy it that much either . 
  ** p.s. 
  : ** i did n't expect my post to be this long . 
  i 'm really sorry about that . 
  this reminds me of the good old championship manager 03-04 where chelsea started out with a budget of ~ 78.000.000 $ and adrian mutu was the best player in the game after the first few seasons . 
  good times . 
  juventus do n't wan na sell him but if chelsea made them an offer so ridiculous , they 'd be forced to consider it . 
  for the truly talented specimen , the right player ? 
  how much would you say ? 
  this is what i 'm talking about .

  who the fuck are fc clinceni ? 
  livepool will sign him and make him a great player . 
  mark .

  fc sioni bolnisi e din georgia iar ks flamurtari e din albania . 
  as it happens , transfermarkt.co.uk seems to be streets ahead of the romanian press . 
  done !, 
  what the fuck is gibbs doing in the us team ? 
  if it 's a book , i 'm generally expecting the character and the plot to be built at the same time , with a lot of the character building being done through the actions of the character . 
  visuals are the last thing that matter for me but i will give the movie a lot more credit if the visuals are actually needed to improve the experience . 
  alien , schindler 's list , the king 's speech and a lot of scorsese 's movies come to mind right now . 
  in a modern movie , i 'm expecting the character to generally be built using minor secondary plots at the beginning of the movie that may or may not turn up again after the main plot has run its course . 
  i believe this is the more predominant technique used in the movies nowadays . 
  it 's popular among the teens and young adults who expect to fall in love with a movie based on a trailer . 
  baaaai , cat bulan pe greci !, 
  mark my words , qpr will sign him . 
  netherlands is looking like the favorite to win the tournament with germany coming in as a close 2nd . 
  on top of that , argentina will begin winning games more easily as they start meeting teams that are less likely to play park the bus football . 
  and then there 's uruguay . 
  do n't dismiss them just because costa rica beat them . 
  they will likely appeal and he will be able to play until a final verdict is given . 
  they can still appeal . 
  and liverpool can probably sue fifa because they themselves ca n't appeal . 
  ah , the ` blue dot in a sea of red ' wallpaper .
