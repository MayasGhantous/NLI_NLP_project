  there are many ways in which even a dominated opponent shows that they 're trying their best out there . 
  a gazelle chased by a leopard will still show its prowess at running away . 
  real madrid getting pressed inside their penalty box by barcelona for 80 out of 90 minutes of the game will still counter-attack and have a really good shot at goal that can potentially change the game . 
  and just because forrest gump is the most awarded movie of 1994 does n't mean that the lion king , the mask , speed and many other movies are n't worth watching out of that year . 
  however , what i saw in survivor : one world was n't trying their best . 
  most of the players out there thought they were called in to create drama for the sake of television , thinking that will make them great players . 
  i do n't think the greece gk knows that . 
  he seemed to be going randomly in hopes that something will hit his face .

  just saying . 
  she 's clearly american . 
  she taps the dude on her right in disbelief and the guy totally gets in her fac to get some facetime on camera . 
  as such , there 's a 83 % chance that 's her little brother . 
  he happens to be sporting an usmnt shirt . 
  thus my resounding logic . 
  lo and behold cum eu am devenit agnostic . 
  hmm . ', 
  * what the actual fuck ?

  what ?? 
  lol . 
  yeah , pretty much . 
  in fact , there 's a lesson to be learned here . 
  ask and ye ' shall receive . 
  gee , i could really use about 3000 dollars right about now . 
  yes but the thing that irks me is that he 's even better of a character when he 's portrayed as a dramatic character instead of just comedic relief . 
  i was just kidding . 
  i do actually need a lot of money of roughly that amount but there 's a far greater lesson for me to learn in not having that kind of money .

  awesome . 
  let 's get this party started . 
  merg pe mana stelei because ` hai romania ' . 
  * are you sure he 's asking for 600k/week ? 
  it seems like the actual contract is in a default state of ` what the player wants ' , which is 60k/week and that the text simply misrepresents what he 's asking for with an additional 0 added in by mistake . 
  * on top of that , the highest wage possible for a player is ~ 270k/week and that 's ** if ** the player has reached legendary ability levels ( 195 + ) . 
  ** edit : ** there 's always the possibility that the $ took a huge dive in value / s. 
  you should change your settings to use the eu currency .

  * voi face update la thread doar in cazul in care apar stiri importante . 
  there actually is some science behind it . 
  it has been theorized that the gravitational pull of the moon makes the lower sections of the brain more relaxed , which in turn makes you realize that i 'm talking out of my ass . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gfggutw.png ) is you right now , at least that 's how you choose to represent yourself . 
  have you thought about doing the following :, 
  * wax your face , your legs and even your private parts . 
  * see a dermatologist about that 3rd nipple . 
  * wash your hair , dye your hair , straighten your hair and let it go long . 
  * pluck your eyebrows , make them more feminine . 
  * tits are awesome but some men love a perfect ass . 
  work out and achieve said ass . 
  jeans , skinny jeans wo n't cut it and short jeans are trashy . 
  * do n't add a lot of make-up on your face but a good lipstick can do wonders . 
  if you want better advice you should show your face/body . 
  unless you are the absolute ugliest motherfucker on the entire planet , your face wo n't go viral . 
  your face would have already gone viral if your everyday friends considered your face internet gold . 
  if you still do n't want your face shown but want additional advice you can pm me a picture and i 'll send you my ** subjective ** opinion . 
  i would recommend you to ask a really close friend of yours about your situation but if my own friends have taught me anything is that they do n't want to hurt feelings . 
  i myself have bad teeth and although most people do n't notice , it has forced me into not pursuing romantic relationships . 
  i 'm going to be brutally honest with you . 
  i do n't understand the combination of gender identities thing . 
  to me it just seems like you have n't built enough maturity to deal with your personality in a proper manner . 
  explain it to me in your own words . 
  you 're making a generalization about genders . 
  i 'm a male and i 'm caring and compassionate too , that does n't mean i want to be a female .
