  this is my lame feedback for you .

  ** fixed !, 
  inca nu am destula experienta pe stadioane cat sa ma duc si singur desi as vrea sa ma duc cat mai des . 
  damn , that is bad . 
  good times . 
  * here 's what 's going on . 
  this guy is not looking to help any romanian online friend ; and his romanian online friend is not suicidal . 
  however , he does need help . 
  the truth is that he is depressed and his friend has stopped talking to him because he is self-centered and always talks about his problems like she 's his shrink . 
  it seems like the guy is in an unrequited love situation and is attempting to stay social with the girl despite her best efforts to stop all contact with him . 
  he is suffering from depression , social anxiety and most likely has suicidal thoughts .

  * dude , you need to get your shit together . 
  you are ~ 20 years of age and you still have n't figured out that life is n't always sunshine and fun video games . 
  your life does not have a predetermined path to happiness and nobody is required to like you or be friends with you . 
  and you are certainly not the number of karma you have . 
  ** you need to pick up the phone and call your family ** and tell them about what you 're dealing with . 
  that 's the only way you 're going to start growing out of this thing you have created around yourself . 
  ** pick up the phone . 
  i hereby giveth to you my highest of upvotes . 
  which , in case you were wondering , is 1 . 
  gratz !, 
  according to the 83rd law of reddit , if this has n't happened to you then it surely must be fake . 
   i did n't want to say anything , but everyone knew i was the computer wizz so , a few guys shouted out my name . 
  can confirm . 
  in a not that far , far away land . . 
  you worry too much about life and what people think about you and what you think about other people . 
  take it one day at a time . 
  3 or 4 years ago i was just as depressed as you are now and i did n't think i 'd ever change . 
  a year passed and nothing changed , 2 years passed and nothing changed , 3 years passed and nothing changed and at one point i sort of realized that while i did n't change , i was a completely different person from 4 years ago . 
  and i 'm going to be frank with you . 
  shit is though . 
  there will be days where all you 're gon na think about is that you ca n't live without a certain person in your life or that you wo n't ever meet another person as amazing as that someone or you 're gon na be jokingly thinking about ways of killing yourself and what the reaction of your friends and family would be . 
  you have to push through that shit . 
  you owe it to the people who care about you . 
  you might not even realize it . 
  but that 's not me . 
  i can not be your friend . 
  i have dealt with a lot of friends that were in a similar situation like you and they were draining a large portion of my personal life . 
  it 's a very mentally challenging and tiring experience that you really should n't put on someone else . 
  you need to deal with this shit yourself . 
  you are an adult . 
  you are a grown man . 
  you are not 5 years old and you do n't need mommy to kiss you goodnight . 
  you need a motherfucker to slap the living shit out of you . 
  then why am i here ? 
  well , i 'm here to let you know that you 're not different than anyone else . 
  everything you experience has been experienced by a million other people . 
  these are the kind of experiences that makes us who we are and who we will be and it is our job to make sure that we grow as people from these little moments in time , even when those moments are the worst things that have happened to us . 
  this is the real world , nigga . 
  it is what you make it . 
  make it a better place by working on yourself . 
  so what ? 
  people will see you in a million different ways even when you present the best version of yourself . 
  that 's the reason why most of us hate each other . 
  it 's been like this since the dawn of mankind . 
  you want reddit to have a better opinion of yourself ? 
  * use bulletpoints . 
  even if your opinion is shit it will still count as coming from a smart person because bulletpoints !, 
  did you know that fake smiling even when we 're sad improves our quality of life ? 
  it 's true . 
  because i 'm using bulletpoints !, 
  see ?? 
  . . also , i read it on til some time ago . 
  * which brings me to my 2nd point . 
  do n't take yourself too seriously . 
  don a smile and get a sense of humor that best suits you . 
  make jokes about how shitty your life is . 
  people resonate with that , you will be able to strike conversations like that . 
  unless you live in america in which case become a hipster and talk about first world problems like they really matter instead .
