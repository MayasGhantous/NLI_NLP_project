  do not motherfucking write up a post if you do n't think it improves the conversation . 
  people do not care about your opinion unless it 's well written and it has a level of objectivity so that it can create additional conversation . 
  did i mention bulletpoints ? 
  : ^ these lines help too . 
  that 's for you to figure out . 
  as i said , i 'm not in the business of making friends just to take care of their shit . 
  / rant on .

  ** 90 +1 ' ** - [ ] ( / / #fluiermini ) final de meci . 
  * are you saying natalie white would have made it to the final three without russell ? 
  russel 's whole thing was to bring a ` dumb blonde ' to the end with him . 
  now take russell out of the picture . 
  you 're left with a pre-merge boot . 
  * but let 's not take russell out of the picture . 
  the galu tribe was dominating foa foa in challenges . 
  the only reason natalie won is because the galu tribe was forced into voting a foa foa at the ftc and they were bitter over russell who took everyone out and felt that mick did not deserve to be there . 
  * the jury would have easily given brett the title had he made it to the final three . 
  erik cardona 's speech pretty much won the game for natalie . 
  ** note : ** now do n't get me wrong . 
  i 'm not saying russell should have won the game . 
  he clearly did not think about how the jury would react after he pulled off his plan . 
  he though that if he outwitted and outplayed everyone he would get the votes . 
  he did n't realize he needed their vote to outlast the ftc . 
  eu am impresia ca a venit intentionat fara un discurs . 
  this is how you know that football manager is one of the most realistic simulators out there .

  shut the fuck up and watch it . 
  video-ul poate fi vizualizat [ aici ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63adgjmlxq0 ) . 
  because the fans make a cold breeze and your sensitive parts like the eyes and the ears will be affected by the sudden change in temperature -- even though the temperature does n't really change . 
  the myth has been going on in romania for ages as well , without the fan part . 
  basically , any open window while the wind is blowing outside will make you get a cold . 
  in similar vein , if you 're in a moving car , do n't you fucking open the windows because the cold air coming from outside ( even though it 's only the sensation of cold air ) is guaranteed to make you sick the following day . 
  as soon as an elderly person sees an open window their backs start hurting , their ears start ringing , their teeth start hurting , shit 's hilarious . 
  i 've seen dozens of people go nuts over an open window while riding the public transit system . 
  ** source : ** i am romanian . 
  holy shit !!, 
  well this thread is full of misinformation . 
  success op !, 
  good luck and have fun with that . 
  * sniff *, 
  neah , i multitask easily . 
  i did n't think it 's possible to enjoy manchester united even more than last season . 
  it says `` this site could be stealing your password ... it 's not , but it easily could be . '', 
  i think we 're pretty safe . 
  real managers use the 2d match engine . 
  there are many and more of these gaming elements that have shown up throughout the gaming history . 
  for most players i think it all started during the starcraft days with a simple ` gg wp ' . 
  4 letters that paved the way for the code of honor in gaming in years to come . 
  i wonder how many remember the good ol' days of world of warcraft when the druid-playing gamers decided , due to their inability to kill foe druids in a timely manner , to simply ignore the enemy counterpart when crossing paths -- and in time people actually forgot why they stopped trying to kill their hostile brothers and sisters and simply started / respecting them for their well chosen character class . 
  every once in a while you 'll see someone screaming at the top of their lungs ' i was there ! ' . 
  alas , we are few and far between . 
  to all my fellow druids that i 've come across and have applied the code of honor , this one 's for you . 
  i think i found the guy who says ` bg ' at the end of every league of legends match no matter the outcome . 
  maybe i can ease your mind regarding gun control . 
  i live in romania , a country with severe laws against the possession of weapons . 
  the only civilians who are allowed to carry weapons are the very important politicians . 
  you are also not allowed to carry cold weapons or non-lethal weapons . 
  anyone who is caught having a weapon will get a severe jail sentence . 
  on top of that , the channels through which you can obtain hunting gear are directly monitored by the police -- all else will be considered illegal . 
  so what does this mean for my country ? 
  well , according to statistics in 2013 , only 2 % of all crimes in my country involve a weapon of any kind . 
  for example , only 19 violent crimes took place in bucharest and all but 1 suspect have already been caught and sentenced . 
  so do we fear for our lives ? 
  hell to the no !, 
  it 's one of the commodities of my country . 
  you will find very few romanians who will tell you that they do not agree with these laws . 
  these few who really feel the need to defend themselves can buy pepper sprays . 
  pepper sprays might not seem like much to the careless citizen but they are effective as fuck . 
  the difference is clear as day in my opinion . 
  [ platinum ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/platinum-nugget.jpg ) vs. [ diamond ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/apollo_synthetic_diamond.jpg ) . 
  but seriously though , platinum players are great at streamlining their income by outplaying enemies while diamond players are great at streamlining their income by having near-perfect farming . 
  sometimes the diamond players are not even as good as the platinum players but because of their farming ability they are ` better ' . 
  * chelsea vs. napoli , 2nd leg , cl 2012 round of 16 . 
  * barcelona vs. chelsea , 2nd leg , cl 2012 semi-finals . 
  * bayern munich vs. chelsea , cl 2012 final , 1-1 ( 3-4p ) . 
  * chelsea vs. arsenal , 2013-14 premier league , 6-0 . 
  there are many memorable matches to me but to be honest i wish this was a ` what is your memorable goal ? ', 
  type of thread . 
  there have been so many memorable goals over the years but the one that stuck with me is the lampard penalty after his mom passed away . 
  ** edit : ** ohh !!, 
  one more !!, 
  a qpr vs. chelsea match in the 2012-13 premier league season , i believe , in which chelsea sadly lost 1-0 but the players displayed so much fucking blue that day . 
  now that was a game to remember . 
  ** edit 2 : ** found it !!, 
  qpr vs. chelsea in the 2011-12 premier league season , our 2nd loss of the season . 
  which was followed by the 3-5 loss against arsenal at home . 
  that rvp hat-trick when he was actually good . 
  that one was memorable too . 
  there 's only one letter at the beginning of the alphabet though . 
  my natalie owned this episode !,
