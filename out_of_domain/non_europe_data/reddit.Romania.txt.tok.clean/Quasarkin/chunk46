  i was expecting something else . 
  i have not read the novel that the movie is based on and the trailer was seemingly promising a real world setting with a minor fantasy twist and the events that would follow in the aftermath . 
  i guess i 'm still hoping that hollywood will go back to the drawing board and redo this post-2000 formula for movies . 
  something about it is -- i would n't say fake but it 's definitely not real -- and i ca n't pinpoint what it is . 
  it 's frustrating and it 's something that keeps making me want something more . 
  the characters were almost one-sided . 
  and i almost feel like they were trying to go for this one-sided character theme as if ` each character portrays one of the 7 deadly sins ' but they executed the idea so poorly that i could n't care less for any of the characters . 
  glenna ( the chubby girl ) was the only fully fledged character with a plot that made sense , ending her story on a realistic note . 
  the plot was boring and cliche . 
  throughout the movie i kept wondering if the main character 's girlfriend is indeed what the movie is about . 
  i kept hoping that the girlfriend 's death is the premise for the horns . 
  and oh my god , harry 's best friend/the guy who ca n't see the horns is the antagonist !, 
  i did not see that one 86 miles away !, 
  all in all , i would say the trailer did it 's job . 
  it got me to watch a movie that i would 've otherwise disregarded 10/10 times . 
  i rate it 2/5 , i would not watch again . 
  it could have been so much more . 
  thanks for reading . 
  they did . 
  they have a son too . 
  come to think of it now , did n't he confess to her that he 's a virgin during the filming of the season ? 
  good times . 
  i 'm still trying to figure out what was with that cliffhanger from last season with that other judge coming to alicia for advice on where to take his law career next . 
  she did ok . 
  let 's get some gold natalie flairs up in here !, 
  well played basescu , well played . 
  we will live , they will die . 
  no , it does n't . 
  height and weight have no effect on the attributes of a player in football manager and are purely descriptive . 
  gamers have been suggesting this feature to si since the beginning of time but it has yet to happen and will likely continue to be this way for a long time . 
  this could potentially be a drastic change to the way the game reads the attributes . 
  i am not a writer by any means and i 'm pretty sure that the guys over at / r/writing will provide you with way better feedback than i ever will , but this is my feedback to you , one reader to another :, 
  * the first few pages should always serve as a method to suck the reader in . 
  make the reader care , make the reader wonder , make the reader anticipate and then twist it . 
  * do n't throw information to the reader without describing why you 're narrating that ` this extra detail ' is important to your story later on . 
  in fact , do n't describe important details at all . 
  create a story inside a story that explains why this detail could ( and will ) be a potential game changer . 
  * start by reading a lot of short , interesting stories and analyze why their formula works . 
  it will be even better if you have the time to read long , interesting books because those formulas are more complex , more detailed and suited to your needs . 
  ** p.s. 
  : ** * disregard my feedback if your story is purely fan fiction for fans who are aware with the narrative . 
  to the match engine it does not matter at all , it 's simply aesthetics . 
  the way the game determines how a header is won between two players ( regardless of height ) is by taking into consideration factors like physical presence , aerial presence , fitness , positioning and jumping . 
  once it 's determined which player wins the header , the match engine then determines how accurate the header is by calculating heading , passing/finishing , decisions , teamwork , etc. 
  there is however controversy of whether or not height does in fact affect the way that a new player is generated into the database . 
  there 's no official statement on this as far as i know and it would n't matter any way . 
  just type in the search bar `` s01exx '' whereas xx * is the number of the episode you just watched . 
  you 're welcome . 
  this comment does n't get the props it deserves . 
  nice catch !, 
  what language is this ? 
  it depends . 
  if you 're looking for beautiful crosses from the right wing , i can guarantee your player will fail . 
  however , if you train your left-footed winger to cut inside from the right and curl shots into the net from a long range , you may have a player . 
  he needs legendary creativity , finishing and long shots though . 
  i do n't advise it , he would just be a rw trying all game long to get into the position of an if . 
  there may be defensive advantages to it although i can not guarantee anything . 
  that makes sense but why did i get a loss ? 
  i did not leave the game . 
  now that you mention it , the game does tend to randomly disconnect when i 'm about to score a sure-win goal . 
  this is the only real answer i got . 
  thank you so much , i will definitely try it . 
  stick to the plan !, 
  it was a man . 
  the tone of the music is indeed similar too . 
  this is n't it but thank you very much for the suggestion . 
  it was sung live and it was something along the lines of `` lai lai lai lai lai lai la la ( loud ) , para sociedad ( medium ) , para sociedad . 
  ( quiet ) '' repeated 3 times . 
  phonetically it works but this was not the song . 
  thank you so much for trying to a pretty much dead tomt . 
  i would like to point out that dinamo bucharest is the only romanian team to have successfully left administration without being relegated . 
  and although many fans are still skeptics i would wager that we 're playing our best football in 8 years .
