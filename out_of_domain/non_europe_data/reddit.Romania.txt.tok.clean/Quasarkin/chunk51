  i 've been devouring a game of thrones , a clash of kings and a storm of swords after watching the first season of game of thrones . 
  amazing story and amazing characters to say the least !, 
  now i 've finally reached a feast for crows , opened it and then . . 
  it confused me . 
  what 's with the sudden change in how the chapters are named ? 
  i always thought the chapters are named that way because that 's the first name of the character . 
  what 's with `` the captain of the guards '' and the others ? 
  they all forgot their names all of a sudden ; and why are there so many new pov characters ? 
  where are the old characters ? 
  sorry if i do n't make any sense . 
  i 'm new to this . 
  i have no idea why i 'm so curious to hear the answer to this question . 
  not a big fan of the movie but i watched it a couple of months ago on tv and a certain song stuck in my head but i ca n't remember anything about it besides the fact that i loved it . 
  the song is sung by danny mcgrath [ steve buscemi ] during his first scene in the movie , i think . 
  i 'm hoping to see the famous reddit power at work and find out what song it was . 
  serious question , i am intrigued by this ` phenomenon ' . 
  i 've been playing the football manager series since cm03/04 and i 've never ever been remotely close to relegation . 
  i even got back to back promotions from time to time when i played in the lower english leagues and i 've generally had an easy time for the past 6 or 7 years . 
  so i decided to make myself a new challenge . 
  i created an amateur club in bss , no players , no staff , 50 seater stadium and began playing . 
  i brought some crappy staff to the club then began my search for players willing to play for the club for free using only recommendations from my scouts . 
  said and done and at the end of the season the club was crowned the new champions of the league . 
  then came the fall . 
  my board decided to step the game up a bit because we promoted ; we became semi-professional , we went 1m in debt to expand the stadium by 4950 seats , some of my key players were stolen by other clubs before i was able to offer them semi-professional contracts and the fa decided to deduct 10 points from the club because we went into administration . 
  1 week before season 2 begun my board had the idea to work the law and get a company voluntary agreement so our debt went away ; and all we have to do is pay back 1.5 k/month for the next 15 years for a total of ~ 250k . 
  the rest of the debt simply went away . 
  my board is brilliant . 
  that aside , they only gave me a wage budget of 1.3 k so right now i am halfway through the season at -1 points , getting only 9 points from my first 21 games . 
  i need around 18 points to escape relegation with a total of 63 points possible . 
  what now ? 
  ** update : **, 
  i have decided to stretch the wage budget even more and i am currently 700 $ / week over the allowed wage budget at a total of 2k $ / week . 
  i have signed a young striker that seems very promising , man of the match on his debut , scoring one and overall being a threat . 
  still hoping to root out the right defender which is currently of no use to me because i have decided to change to a very offensive 4-3-3 system ( i 've previously concurrently used a control 4-2-2 and a defensive 4-5-1 system ) . 
  i still need to find a goalkeeper , i 've been conceding like a motherfucker . 
  i 've just moved into the expanded stadium and got my first victory ( also first game of january ) through a comeback fight ( they kept leading by one goal , i won 3-2 ) . 
  on a side note , the board refuses to offer me a new contract until the end of the season . 
  which might mean that i 'm getting my head chopped off . 
  right now i need to recuperate 21 points to stay above the relegation zone . 
  20 games left in the season . 
  i 'm trying to find a show i 've seen about 5 or 6 years ago on television and for some reason the final image of it just stuck in my head and popped back up tonight . 
  i do n't really recall it in much detail but i think it was an episode of the twilight zone . 
  i do remember it was in color . 
  the final image of this particular show is of this lady walking through the streets , she just left her home i think , it 's night and it feels very lonely , there 's only the street light and a few cars parked , everything is completely still and eerie . 
  the camera is left behind and very very slowly pans upwards , while the woman keeps walking onwards without a purpose . 
  the camera then reveals ( or perhaps it was already revealed earlier in the show ) that time as we know it has stopped and there 's a motherfucking ufo frozen in time in midair ( 50 feet above the ground maybe ? ), 
  in what seems on course to crash . 
  the screen then fades to black and there is no explanation given . 
  : i hope this is the proper sub-reddit . 
  i 've already tried the list of episodes of the twilight zone ( including the 1985 and 2002 series ) and i have n't found a synopsis that resembles my memory . 
  i thought i 'd share . 
  i did not do it on purpose . 
  . . but then this happened : http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2i70gzq&s=6, 
  is there any other way i can donate my lame 2 $ to the developers ? 
  i am having an argument with my best friend over an english translation that he 's currently stuck on . 
  these are the two versions :, 
  his version :, 
  marketing strategies used by derp.co for card acceptance services by retailers . 
  my version :, 
  marketing strategies used by derp.co for card acceptance services to retailers . 
  which one makes sense ? 
  played the trial of eve online in 2007 and enjoyed it but found it too complex at the time and i did n't have the money to pay for a subscription anyway . 
  so here i am , giving it another 14-days trial because some asshat told me how awesome eve still is a few days ago . 
  anything i should know ? 
  what 's the best way to spend the next 14 days ? 
  how should i proceed about my business ? 
  i will start in about an hour and a half . 
  this is what she can recall : the movie begins with a guy in a white bed , everything around him is white , as if he 's in a psycho ward . 
  his phone rings , it 's his father letting him know that his mother died in the bathtub .
