do you know if the touchpad supports 3 finger gestures ? 
  i think you 'll learn a fair bit just by installing ubuntu gnome edition or xubuntu in a vm , then installing every program through the command line . 
  install a th ** e ** me for the de , then [ install and customize urxvt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kjbj-ez1vu&amp;list=pl5ze0djyv5dyf93rdfdwbrkdwps_-okni ) . 
  when you 're done with that , [ install and customize i3 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1i63wgcvu4&amp;list=pl5ze0djyv5dbcv9vnezfmp6su7zmkgzcf&amp;index=1 ) and use a few terminal programs like cmus , rtorrent , w3m . 
  then install [ airline ] ( https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline ) for [ nvim ] ( https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/installing-neovim ) . 
  doing all these things took me multiple tries , but i would now feel pretty comfortable in a linux environment . 
  of course , this is just a suggestion , i am not an expert , it 's just what worked for me . 
  used to have a fiio x3 ii , could n't stand carrying two devic ** e ** s with me all the time . 
  do an a/b test , i could n't tell the difference between 320kb mp3 's and lossless files . 
  make sure not to know which file you are listening to . 
  i use shuttle + on android , about the only thing you can do to really get better sound is to get an amp , but they 're annoying to carry around . 
  fiio makes some .

  it hurts, 
  ca n't really blam ** e ** samsung for people 's shit taste . 
  this . 
  i 've been list ** e ** ning since the beginning and i 've always wondered why he picked that specific sound . 
  mine was disabl ** e ** d because i had the action center turned off in the taskbar settings . 
  nowadays i t ** e ** nd to use the controller , but i went through a keyboard phase since i could easily alt-tab to skip ads and i could look around quickly enough to check before going through an intersection . 
  well , now that torr ** e ** ntz.eu and kat.cr are both down ... 
  fuck m ** e ** , that 's gross . 
  i 'd lik ** e ** to see this attempt a few drifts . 
  why ? 
  ** e ** verybody needs a hobby . 
  why ? 
  the general consensus seems to be that ram is ram , make sure it 's ddr3 ( i think that 's what you need , look it up ) , and that it 's made for laptops and uses the correct voltage ( again , look it up ) . 
  popular manufacturers : crucial , corsair , kingston . 
  you can do the upgrade yourself , but if you 're too scared ( which you should n't be , the process is easy and there are many tutorials ) , just bring it to an apple store . 
  what is vscocam ? 
  did n't know about that . 
  man , logan seemed decent , hope it 's just a misunderstanding . 
  but they had other guys who worked for them for a pretty short period of time before quitting . 
  decided to avoid buying anything new . 
  was thinking of getting a oneplus 3 or a galaxy s7 , got a second-hand s6 for less than half the price of the op3 . 
  it 's great . 
  i had to use my 598 's without my amp for a while , when i plugged them back into it i thought they sounded much better . 
  did you install tlp or something ? 
  i heard linux had terrible battery life , main reason for not using it on my laptop . 
  the macbook air will have better battery life and better framerates due to the lower resolution of the screen . 
  the touchpad will also be nicer , however you should also have a look at the thinkpad 13 . 
  it has better graphics than both of those and a 1080p ips display , which means that csgo will either look better or run smoother than it would on any of those . 
  it has an amazing keyboard . 
  the ram , storage and wi-fi card are replaceable , whereas all of the laptops you are currently interested in force you to make do with what you got or buy something new . 
  it is also milspec rated , so you can expect it not to break as easily . 
  its i/o is better imo , as you are n't forced to buy an adapter to connect it to an hdmi display . 
  i get the car thing , but how is public transportation cheaper than a bicycle ? 
  what makes you think it was n't just a joke ? 
  the fact that i believe in absolute free speech . 
  only happens in that app , if i use vlc it 's fine , so i really doubt it 's something in the background or a driver issue . 
  it does n't have any integrated graphics :(, 
  i did n't know `` wet paint '' was incorrect ... 
  i can think of several reasons . 
  xtz earphone 12, 
  he 's currently got a galaxy s7 . 
  the only modern qwerty android phone is the blackberry priv . 
  i do n't see what 's so amazing . 
  yeah , it 's a decent ad , but just think about the fact that you 'd be paying a stupid amount of money for low specs and gimmicky features . 
  should be tagged nsfl . 
  i get what you mean , but i 've started to like him since he begun calling maddox out on his bullshit . 
  going for normal mode for 90 days . 
  i do n't feel motivated to do anything , but that will have changed by the end of the challenge . 
  i would recommend getting a second-hand tablet , a bluetooth keyboard and a case . 
  word documents ? 
  google docs and google slides , and there 's also microsoft office if you really want to pay . 
  side-by-side multitasking ? 
  no problem . 
  i already got a laptop , but i feel guilty for not buying an ipad air 2 and the accessories i mentioned , as i would still be able to do everything i wanted while getting a better screen and battery life for less than half of what i spent on my thinkpad 13 . 
  as for playing games , i would get a second hand psp , there are lots of great games and they tend to be really cheap . 
  there 's asshole design and then there 's you-deserve-to-be-thrown-off-a-skyscraper-into-a-pool-full-of-cockroaches design . 
  yeah , i love it . 
  what do you mean by `` works better '' ? 
  i ca n't imagine anything better than twilight except maybe something that would n't affect the black pixels at all . 
  what does it do ? 
  i think i 'll consider rooting ... 
  we 've all been there . 
  every time you fuck up you get to know your weaknesses better . 
  and then you can use that knowledge not to fuck up . 
  you can do it !, 
  8gb of ram ? 
  that 'd be ridiculous . 
  i almost want it to happen . 
  what is that subreddit that you speak of ? 
  i 'd like a nice , friendly place . 
  you wo n't . 
  trust yourself , you can do it !, 
  i admire you for being able to stick to a single phone for so long , but if samsung were to update old phones , they would be very slow . 
  system requirements increase over time , as do the specifications . 
  the harder it gets , the better you 'll feel after getting over it . 
  do n't be yourself , be who you want to be . 
  now tell me : does who you want to be have discipline ? 
  then you will too . 
  it 's also on google play music , just sayin . 
  thank you so much !, 
  flushed my safari , now it 's fine . 
  before flushing it would skip multiple times on one line . 
  anybody know why it 's not on google play ? 
  that was great !, 
  really felt your anger , loved it . 
  yup . 
  i did n't like it at first either , but i kept seeing it in various places and now i like it .
