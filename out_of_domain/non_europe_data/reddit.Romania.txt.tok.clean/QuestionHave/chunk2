  i prefer `` afghanime '' . 
   280z in high school, 
  i 'm so jealous of you right now . 
  i doubt it , it is one of the comments to a kizuna ai video . 
  what made you change ? 
  i just love volvo 's interiors . 
  this chad fucker was his most annoying guest yet . 
  risky click of the day . 
  do you like [ kohh ] ( https://youtu.be/1iw_m-cxywo ) ? 
  here 's another [ song ] ( https://youtu.be/wu54wpqnyic ) and its [ remix ] ( https://youtu.be/ysmj0ffspbm ) . 
  ... so is it ? 
  that would be amazing . 
  i 'm not generally one for all-caps fuckery , but you 'd fuck him over so spectacularly by overshadowing his last resort that even i felt it was necessary to scream . 
  please do this . 
  i 'm not that interested in being able to use it independently . 
  could you give me a few examples of the sonic capabilities you mentioned ? 
  when a new episode of / r/thedickshow comes out . 
  i get you , but you do n't generally see ceramic on the bracelets of watches this cheap ... 
  i wosh more brands would gave ceramic bracelets , or at least ceramic middle links . 
  if it has a 2824 , no , that 's not normal , the maximum is 20 seconds/day . 
  that 's a 2824 produced under a different name . 
  chr . 
  ward says 20s/day on their website for the sw200 as well . 
  is it still under warranty ? 
  i had a black , and while i would n't buy one again , i have n't found it to be noisy . 
  that being said , my pc used to sit under the desk . 
  the tudor black bay 36 comes pretty close , i think . 
  not sleek , but it will pretty much always work and it does everything you could ever want it to do . 
  if you do n't like it , i 'd look for a different g-shock , though i would avoid analogue ones as they are not as resistant , readable or battery efficient as their digital counterparts . 
  edit : remembered about [ this ] ( https://www.amazon.com/pulsar-mens-pw3001-collection-watch/dp/b00cbg3qny ) . 
  great value , and you can put it on a metal bracelet while staying in your budget . 
  strapcode has some pretty nice ones from what i 've heard . 
  i thought tudor switched to their own in-house movements . 
  agree about the rest , though . 
  that makes me want one , i do n't want to sebd it to tudor for servicing . 
  afaik rolexes have a 5 year warranty . 
  they should gain up to just over a minute , so send it back . 
  because it 's more expensive . 
  even if they extend your warranty , i still think it 'd be cheaper in the long run to have a 2824 serviced by an independent every time there 's something wrong with it . 
  huh , i did n't know that . 
  thank you !, 
  i 'd have a look at [ this christopher ward ] ( https://www.christopherward.co.uk/events/half-price/c9-5-day-automatic-5 ) as its movement is really cool . 
  they also have an [ automatic moonphase ] ( https://www.christopherward.co.uk/watches/dress/c9-moonphase-820e98 ) and a [ fancy gmt ] ( https://www.christopherward.co.uk/watches/dress/c9-worldtimer ) that look quite good . 
  i 'd also look at [ nomos ] ( http://www.nomos-store.com/en/watches/model-series/ ) ; their clean designs are some of my favourites . 
  still , if you want bang for the buck , i 'd consider a seiko . 
  i 'm surprised i do n't see more people talking about the [ urushi ], 
  ( https://www.seiyajapan.com/collections/seiko/products/seiko-automatic-presage-sarx029 ) series , the dial is made in the same studio as grand seikos and it will always retain its colour . 
  same goes for the [ enamelled dial ] ( https://www.seiyajapan.com/collections/seiko/products/seiko-automatic-presage-sarx019 ) series , but i just do n't find them as appealing . 
  i 'm surprised that pretty much nobody ever mentions [ the seiko dolce sacm171 ] ( https://www.seiyajapan.com/collections/seiko/products/seiko-dolce-quartz-sacm171 ) , as it looks very nice and clean and has a thermocompensated movement ( + / -10 sec/year ) . 
  one of the main things i like about it is the lack of a date window ; symmetry is beautiful . 
  it 's 33.5 mm wide . 
  lastly , [ this ] ( https://www.seiyajapan.com/collections/seiko/products/seiko-prospex-200m-diver-solar-sbdn035-seiko-x-padi-limited-edition-for-ladies ) is a smaller solar diver . 
  no frills , and no ceramic or sapphire , unfortunately , but it looks good and is one of the few smaller divers you can get . 
  the only other one i can think of besides the skx013 is the christopher ward c60 pro , but they use c1 lume , which i found very dissapointing . 
  on a watch ? 
  for the same price as a solar seiko ? 
  i 've never seen one . 
  [ sauce . 
  thank you ~, 
  [ sauce .

  demonstrators ? 
  do you really need to `` demonstrate '' setting shit on fire and smashing up cars to get your point across ? 
  what 's the lume on the sinn like ? 
  also , i 've seen a video of someone turning the crown in order to use the slide rule and it seemed very slow and hard to use ; what do you think ? 
  finally , would you buy a new one again ? 
  i 'd like to buy a bagelsport nautilus or milgauss , does anyone know where to find one ? 
  i 've looked on aliexpress , searched for `` milgauss '' , `` bagelsport '' and `` patek nautilus '' and i could n't find anything . 
  any other seartch terms / websites i should try ? 
  i know there are some on ebay , but those are too expensive for what they 're worth imo . 
  i wish they did n't coat the new one . 
  i especially mind the sub-seconds register ; i wish it would simply measure hours , as it would be more battery-efficient while also providin more useful information . 
  did n't mind the date , but from what i 've read , these use proprietary batteries and i do n't know if i could buy them where i live . 
  love the old logo though . 
  oh , alright then , thanks . 
  i find the mako rather ugly , especially the font used on the bezel , which is generic and small . 
  the ray 's sunburst dial is also a nice detail , and i 'm a fan of round indices . 
  nomos watches are even smaller iirc . 
  have a look at their chronoscope line , those are the biggest watches they make . 
  the orient bambinos are even larger . 
  honestly , i would reconsider the whole `` size '' thing ; unless you have tree trunks for arms , a 36mm will look fine , it 's just that bigger watches are more common and we 're not used to seeing classic sizes . 
  the automatic max bill is 38mm in diameter : that 's 38mm of pure dial , which will make it wear bigger . 
  i think it 'd look fine on any wrist . 
  i want to get a max bill handwinder , which is 34mm . 
  i have n't measured my wrists , but i can wear a chr . 
  ward c60 trident pro 42mm without any lug overhang . 
  if you still want something bigger , have a look at stowa , especially second hand ones . 
  the antea comes in bigger sizes , maybe one of their 39mm versions will be what you 're seeking . 
  i 'd try to get one with their old logo , but that 's just my preference . 
  have a look at the g-shocks on that website ; you can get some nice ones for under 100 eurobucks . 
  rolex does n't decorate movements , period . 
  well , they might make exceptions for their cellini series , but that 's it . 
  i just put them on my cat . 
  was thinking of getting a dog so i have more slots . 
  who needs a watch box ? 
  it is a direct message i sent to someone with their consent . 
  why should i not be allowed to send it ? 
  it 's rage because it really pissed me off ; because fb messenger should simply allow you to communicate as efficiently as possible , and yet it 's getting in my way . 
  the cool thing about the movement is the battery life : seiko say it should last 5 years with 2 ( two ) hours of daily use . 
  just got a thinkpad 13 , loving it .
