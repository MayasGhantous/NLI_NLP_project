  so , i ca n't really say that my degree helped . 
  in retrospect it helped my understand many things i would n't have , it gave me access to information , it shaped me as the person i am . 
  for that , i would do it again . 
  i would even do it if i had to pay for it since it 's not that expensive where i live . 
  to conclude , if you do it for a career slingshot , be careful what you pick and that you do n't change your mind . 
  if you want to do it for self indulging ... but its too expensive , i believe that it wo n't affect your career development . 
  that is if you have access to information otherwise and you learn by our own . 
  i got a masters degree in european security and integration . 
  my work field is not related . 
  nor i wish it would be . 
  absolutely . 
  children are the next generation . 
  we ca n't be ignorant to what it would be raised as or by whom . 
  and about the basic human instinct to reproduce ... i 'm not sure that will still be a thing since we are 7 fucking billion . 
  humans evolve as a response to their environment . 
  so i do n't really think that punishment will be required ( that is if we reach a level of conscience where we admit : we are too many and we 're bad at raising children ) . 
  also imo if you 're too poor to afford life you should n't be allowed to have children . 
  there are too many homeless people with their babies in their arms begging for food . 
  that 's just wrong . 
  if you get pregnant and you 're religious enough not to get an abortion send it for adoption . 
  otherwise that child wo n't have proper food , proper conditions , access to education and it will end up on the streets just like his family . 
  romania . 
  but free/cheap education is not only a feature of ex-communist countries . 
  it is mostly seen in europe and specially at state colleges . 
  the private ones have a bad image due to the fact that you mostly pay to the degree and you do n't really have to study at all . 
  just pay up the professor , he 'll give you a passing grade ... and there you go , you 're a graduate . 
  scholarships are pretty small . 
  but the extra expenses like a place in the campus , food at the canteen are not that much . 
  got [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ievidbu.jpg?2 ) two days ago . 
  we really do n't . 
  but i 'm curious if there is the same discrepancy between the public and the private universities . 
  which are considered better judging by the quality of education , the laboratories equipment , the rate of graduates etc. 
  interesting . 
  thank you for the insight and good luck !,

  i laughed so hard at this without realizing that i was crying of sadness .

  [ quark ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oopifixdfz8 ) convinced me to stop poisoning my body . 
  live long enough to see experience space travel . 
  i do n't think it is . 
  children !!, 
  i try really hard to respect their options . 
  but i ca n't help myself thinking less of their rational capacities .

  it resembles human evolution , society , industrialization , civilization progress and all that in a very satirical way .

  of course they exist .

  ** we are living beings from the same fabric of space as others can be . 
  just because we 're too far from the others , or too `` blind '' it does n't mean they 're not there .

  it eats everything . 
  i do n't even like [ french ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5kac5cocuk ), 
  would you like fries with that ?

  if you shoot it directly to the sun no problem . 
  i need to do stuff with my hands ( hehe ) . 
  also it 's a good excuse to get out of a room , or take a break from whatever i 'm going, 
  therefore , were all aliens , 
  oh ... it make more sense now ... i guess, 
  edit : thank you mr_captainobvious . 
  your job here is done . 
  not sure that swims . 
  more like adrift . 
  where 's the dog ? 
  taking socks off whilst being in bed . 
  mostly , x is making , lets say , an objective harder to get , or turning attention away from that objective . 
  he is trying to either buy some time for his team or lead ( bait ) the enemies away from an objective ( turret , baron etc. ), 
  whilst his team can achieve an advantage . 
  heard a lot of `` niceeee '' during matches from most teams , but when i heard migxas i knew i was going to find a thread like this on reddit . 
  oh man , i love it when we all know what to expect from reddit in the next 3 minutes . 
  hmm ... i wonder why, 
  not me , because i do n't have to habit to insist about a fact when others are telling me otherwise , so until recheck my sources i 'm a humble person , but one day at work i was telling 5 of my colleagues that the skin is an organ . 
  oh my , they devoured me with arguments i did n't even understand well enough to reject , they kept using biological `` big words '' to intimidate me and so on . 
  i resigned my statement . 
  monday , one of them comes to me , telling me that he checked , and indeed the skin is an organ , the biggest of all organs , and that i was right all along . 
  oh , the feels , the grandeur , the righteousness ^ angelicchoir, 
  every time i shop i feel like i 'm spending hours to do it , so much lag, 
  it looks like u/marklar is right . 
  try not to kill homeless people irl . 
  ` wait for it ' < -- now we know how you feel . 
  how late am i for this ? 
  i read ant fart . 
  kai win . 
  every time i watch the show , from the first episode , first season till the end of the series ... bleah !, 
  i ca n't really see what 's happening on the map but i sure hope we still have our inhibs . 
  is there any chance that , if i 'm patient enough , i can get the game back ? 
  thanks for the link . 
  i knew stalin was a dick , but reading details like this , makes me think of him as a whole new level of dick < -- ^ if ^ that ^ makes ^ any ^ sense . 
  no , its just her paws overlapping ,
