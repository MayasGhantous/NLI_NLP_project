  `` we predict that this ring will persist for [ 1 million to 100 million years ] and will initially have a comparable mass density to that of saturn 's rings . '', 
  idk , but the possibility is exciting, 
  can you provide any descriptions for the photos ? 
  also , thank you for posting them !, 
  * queuing up for the answers, 
  i recently stopped buying as many munchies ( i used to go shopping and return with a full bag ) . 
  i still have the cravings but i tried to do with less . 
  also , i 've started drinking a lot of water ( no more sodas or beers , etc ) . 
  filling the stomach with water will lesser the need to eat . 
  you 're a true hero !, 
  thank you, 
  yes !, 
  travis fimmel aka ragnar is my newest passion, 
  * used to be *, 
  ftfy :, 
  * together ... *, 
  fuck / u/nefariousneezy , he started it . 
  thank you kindly . 
  she 's a snuggle cat and she begs for belly-rubs . 
  a constant source of awww . 
  i just got it and did n't had the chance to play it yet , but i 'm sure it 's gon na be my favourite edition . 
  star munchkin and cthulhu are my favourite , but we really have a lot of editions . 
  +1.5 k cards , in total . 
  she 's a mix . 
  all i know is that her mother was an angora . 
  make haste !, 
  i have n't had the chance to play it yet , nor did i play regular munchkin for over 5 years . 
  but i intend to share opinions with r/munchkin afterwards . 
  ( i hope ), 
  my cat like anyone who 's willing to pet her , so i can assume that my cat loves you too , 
  if you have n't received any feed back from your brother yet , i think it 's a great gift . 
  the mechanics are not so different from the classic munchkin but it 's waaay more fun . 
  the cards are very well made and there 's a lot more interaction ( i.e. 
  find snails on cards , penalties for time of day/time of month , hair colour and length , beverages or devices on table , etc ) . 
  it plays very well stand alone but it can be mixed with other editions as well . 
  ( specially with cthulhu - due to undead monsters ) . 
  your brother should be really pleased :d, 
  ** all items are allowed ** in the backpack ( on the table ) . 
  it does n't matter what restrictions ( race , class , sex , or available slots in your inventory ) they have and how that affects you . 
  by items i mean ** wearable ** cards , with persistent combat bonus and price on it . 
  by wearable i mean a card that tells you exactly where it goes , even if 's it not specified on a card . 
  for example if armor is written on your card , you know you have to wear it as an armor , but if you card is a * knee pads * or a * title * , do n't get confused when you ca n't find written on the card where to put it . 
  it 's in the card 's name most of the time they just printed the classic gear on the cards ( head gear , weapons , armor and foot gear ) . 
  ** usable once cards ** are not items . 
  yes they have a price but their combat bonus is not permanent . 
  you 'll have to keep those in your hand ( pots , wishing rings , loaded dice , etc ) . 
  you do not want to show whether you have these cards in play or not . 
  that 's why you keep them in your hand . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://forums.sjgames.com/showthread.php?t=80595 ) usable once cards are items and can be put on table . 
  we made a house rule 6 years ago and i forgot it 's only a house rule , to keep potions in hand , for secrecy purposes . 
  apologies for the confusion . 
  * `` unfortunately , everyone 's forgetting to mention that the rules tell you that you can play one-shot items from * ** your hand ** * or * ** from in play ** , * specifically , which should clarify things further in this case .

  give or take, 
  it depends mostly of your friends . 
  for example , we are sci-fi fans , so our favourite is space munchkin 1 & 2 . 
  we also like adventure time munchkin for obvious reasons . 
  apocalypse is fun as well .

  this is what i need , as well , but to scared to make it a resolution . 
  good luck !,
