  hopefully a top top player, 
  it 's a body language fight for who gets `` the upper hand '' in the photo . 
  putin in on home ground so he positioned so the photo would have shown he is in charge but obama countered by grabbing him slightly higher , thus evening out things . 
  the power of the grip is not that important .

  still a better story than after earth, 
  that means he promoted 7 new players every 2 years ... one full line-up every 3, 
  was he still wearing camouflage pants ? 
  how do they know whose penis will open up to accept the other person 's penis ? 
  are you koscielny in disguise ?

  [ ro ] we got greece and have the return leg at home ... could n't ask for something better, 
  they announce the venue for the game on oct 25 ^ th ... no other official data is available :p, 
  this would be some nice pr for the nsa, 
  streaks end : roma has ** 9w ** and chievo has ** 5l ** @ 4.00 on x2 seems like a god bet, 
  i hope the same will happen for the corporal, 
  marseille were in the 2 ^ nd pot at the draw so i do n't think they were considered weak at that time . 
  i ** think ** the clubs decide the order of the matches after the draw ( i know this is true for euro qualifiers ), 
  that 's some speed ... but keep in mind he came on the pitch 7 minutes earlier, 
  pat rice had the same look and pose as in the last few years, 
  i expect a really entertaining match here : 8 yellow cards , 4 goals , 2 penalty kicks ; 1 red card and 0 points for one of the teams . 
  i was 100 % confident the country was made up but i had to google it to make sure it wa n't some kind of autonomous thing ... still feel like a twat for doing that, 
  why is the referee the same height as them ? 
  anyone know how we can summon / u/cutest _ squirrel ? 
  not many choices today ... but i found an interesting statistic in brasil b : chapecoense drew their last 6 matches in a row and their opponents from parana drew their last 2 matches at home . 
  my bets : 12 ** @ 1.25 ** or 1 ** @ 2.20 **, 
  carrie is off her lithium again ... 
  the spikes are made out of plastic so they ca n't be very sharp so i do n't think anyone would get hurt by that thing ( thus they would n't stay away fro it ) ... but i think the other passengers can use it if their back itches,

  probably something similar to what happens at a normal tribal council :, 
  re-vote and only be able to chose from the 2 . 
  in case there would be a 4-4 tie maybe bring in the person that finished 3 ^ rd to chose the winner . 
  zooey deschanel seems to look better with them, 
  2-3 wins in the arena give you 40-50 gold and a pack so you kind of get your money back anyway . 
  because of this i always fancy my chances in the arena , even if i only got 6 wins once . 
  i ca n't wait to see city play some derby games with some away-from-home linesmen,
