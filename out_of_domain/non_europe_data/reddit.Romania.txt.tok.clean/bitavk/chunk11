  i personally do n't see why you would value the cabal shadow priest that much . 
  i basically see it as a 6 mana yeti with the possibility of getting a 1 drop or a support minion ( and the one in a million gurubashi ) . 
  i used to play this card myself but seeing that it did n't have that big of an impact i 've replaced it with a mind control tech, 
  tinkmaster overspark is appropriately the closest one to 50 % ( +0.5 % ), 
  got triple legendaries in arena draft ... got dc 'd twice, 
  2 fouls and a yellow - a bad game for per 's standards, 
  find out when rich kids that have money to buy arena tickets come back from school and exploit them as they do to their parents, 
  9/9 of the african players failed to make a big name for themselves . 
  only abdou razack traor\u00e9 and daniel opare play at decent teams from some 2 ^ nd tier leagues,

  alt avantaj pe care il are simona e faptul ca aproape s-a ridicat la nivelul performantelor virginiei ruzici ( fostul absolut in tenisul romanesc feminin ) ... deci the sky is the limit now ,

  what does that `` 3 '' in the middle-left-top part stand for ? 
  i 've been seeing it in my games and i did n't know what significance it has . 
  if we look over the odds ... we should the bet if we manage not to lose tonight,

  but ... can i still hop on board [ the train ] ( http://img.pandawhale.com/post-13085-all-aboard-the-karma-train-gif-nahz.gif ) ? 
  uhm ... is it just me or sanogo has some big problems with his balance ? 
  i remember seeing him at the emirates cup stumbling with the ball and falling to the ground twice in his first game . 
  he also failed to hit the ball on a few occasions when he tried to cross or shoot . 
  norwich at home is a tough not to crack and southampton will probably score at west ham, 
  6 + inches is above average ... but i would n't worry about numbers . 
  just have fun , learn how to use the cards in the right way and soon you will be giving lessons to others . 
  saw something similar on qi about what glasses should you use at a wedding ... the basic idea was that we also use our eyes when drinking . 
  you can also try this yourself : put the same drink in 2 different things ( one opaque and one transparent ) , serve them to a person and ask them what they think about them . 
  from my research they always prefer the beverage from the transparent glass .

  edit : `` nn '', 
  no problems ; thanks for the news anyhow ... 
  i was planning to place a bet on the game and this piece of news kind of changed my mind , 
  i learnt the same thing the hard way . 
  now like to put small amounts on big upsets ... they always seem to happen in these type of matches, 
  engaging tc 130 , mental dislocator !, 
  come on man ... just put that token on the board so you use all of your mana, 
  then good luck going through my sunwalker + redemption combo, 
  talk to you after the next patch then , 
  it 's still a strong combo with the sunwalker because of the taunt ( arena paladin dream ) ... and i 'm happy about the nerf because i do n't own a cairne bloodhoof and i do n't value scarlet crusaders that highly, 
  i 'm romanian , so the only way i 'm able to tell de difference is by asking myself whether that picture is from the communist period . 
  i average 10 + in a row, 
  is there trouble ?!, 
  i remember some guys did like 2k damage with the arcane missiles . 
  i think they used the ancient mage for the extra power . 
  they also had to use some ice blocks to buy some time and the priest also had some velens to keep the health total high .

  i 'm still new to streaming ( 0 followers ) and i need to upgrade my internet if to provide a better experience for the viewers .

  i had to dc and i lost a star even though the graphics did n't show it at first . 
  i have n't taken part in any competitions until now but i 'm looking to develop towards that area ( dreamhack is coming to bucharest at the end of april and they said something about a hearthstone section ) ... so you can mark me as competitive ; i 'm definitely not the sivhd of hearthstone, 
  amaz priest - if i get rag and ysera, 
  handlock - as long as i don ; t see many hunters, 
  any druid - if i smell hunters,

  yup , warrior . 
  ( i edited it ), 
  my problem with it is that you can only rely on brawl if you fall behind and you are dependant on drafting a good amount of weapons . 
  the card advantage for health trade that you get from the weapons and the nice combos with taskmaster / inner rage are very nice but i do n't seem able to get consistent results with this class, 
  your points are very good and i agree with them . 
  i tried to be concise and did n't explain what situations i was thinking of :, 
   2 medium sized minions are better to have than one really big one, 
  i often see people buffing their biggest minion on board , only to see it silenced , hexed or bgh 'd, 
   mana is power =  use as much of it as you can, 
  it 's definitely not good to overextend against someone that does n't pose a big threat ; i was advocating mana efficiency ... a obvious thing ... maybe i should ahve skipped it :p, 
  zelalem 's debut top seems like a very good investment, 
  would n't spectating be limited to your friend list ? 
  33 $ for a 1/16 chance of winning at least 500 $ - above average value, 
  i also use druid for `` 20 minions that cost at least 5 mana '' quest - put innervates , nourishes and wild growths + click on all the 5 mana minions after, 
  your opponent could very well mean `` gg/wp '' by using the `` well played '' emote ... the problems seems to lie in your frustration with losing, 
  i do n't have many experience with sc2 but from what i gather , hearthstone is a bit more rng based . 
  players may get salty when they get bad cards and relieved when they manage to sneak a win . 
  i played a bit of lol and i can say the lack of a chat with your opponent is a very good thing . 
  i sometimes get angry friend requests with people raging about how lucky or p2w i was ... but you will always get some bad apples . 
  i definitely feel that this community is less bm than avergae . 
  archmage antonidas in druid or rogue, 
  whatever happened just screwed over 2 of my arena games in a row, 
  pyroblast and flamestrike in the starting hand ... 
  such mage !, 
  i hope we do n't get out-tactic 'd, 
  i would take the bribery charges if that meant i could get the money back,

  [ arena ] having to send my deathwing in a goldshire footman when my opponent is below 10 health, 
  anyone besides mike dean would have been excellent, 
  cunter , winlock , mrglglglgl , amazing, 
  it seems that the orthodox church is n't very good at making people be `` pro life '', 
  the 5 ^ th division is the lowest tier in romanian football . 
  i know most of them struggle to get a full starting 11 each week so it 's no wonder they welcome everyone . 
  ( 15/20 ) * 1 / ( 20 * 35 ) = 0,0010 = 0,10 % chance of getting the same legendary in consecutive packs,
