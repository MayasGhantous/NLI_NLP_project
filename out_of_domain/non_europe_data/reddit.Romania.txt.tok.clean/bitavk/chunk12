  my zoo has a 80 % win rate vs midrange hunter : i run one owl for the 6/5 and the big hyenas and and 2 abusive sergeants . 
  i only lose to that deck if they have 2 strong uth or if they kept the explosive traps in their decks . 
  i 'm happy to see he is back on good terms with koln . 
  i remember him being booed by some of the fans when we played vs them . 
  gaara is the only known guy in my road to the qf ... let 's see what all that hype from reynad was all about, 
  33 $ entry fee ; first come first served . 
  there are still some free spots but i do n't know if registration is still open ( decks had to be sent by the 22 ^ nd ), 
  already saw this deck 4 time on ladder and lost to it ... so i guess i will give it a try, 
  cel putin nu joci hunter , 
  that looks medieval as fuck, 
  my experience :, 
  - lost 2 games to hunter after going 1-0 up, 
  - talked to the great amaz and king strifecro, 
  - gnimsh is a flippin giant, 
  - saw a guy playing a level 7 shaman with goldshire footman, 
  - saw a priest win with a inner fire combo, 
  - got the new cardback, 
  it 's a very one dimensional card . 
  you can use it to great effect only when you have the board control . 
  basically it gives you a boost when you are already in front and it 's pretty much dead when you are behind ( a thing that happens very often when playing priest ) . 
  it is also easy to anticipate ( seeing demolisher , mogu ` shan , turtle or gurubashi ) so people save their hard removal for your dream combo . 
  studying . 
  being a productive member of society . 
  it 's called `` open '' because everyone can take part if they want . 
  it was first come , first served and only 126/128 of the tickets were bought . 
  maybe some people just wanted to have some fun , had some super confidence or just felt the need to express their support for this game ( geepsy ), 
  for the sweet health plays i like to use crazed alchemist because it also leaves behind a 2/2 body, 
  xpecial got benched by tsm, 
  [ his vlog ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1o1qbwf5vw ), 
  / r/leagueofmemes, 
  he even discriminated against a bald player ( telling the coach to bench him ) , saying that 's the mark of the devil, 
  i was losing in arena ... probably against one of you guys, 
  now we need a 10-0 vs norwich and cardiff to get a lucky ** 8 ** -0 vs chelsea in order for us to clinch 3 ^ rd. 
  anything is possible if diaby got back in the team . 
  she needs to hire avril lavigne 's publicist, 
  this guy has 75k tweets and 78k followers ... you can mark that as [ very unreliable ], 
  this table should include welsh players as well ... considering that cardiff played in the epl ... just for that reason, 
  his singing skills are way better than trump 's ... 
  i ca n't wait for some original lyrics when he reaches legendary with the f2p priest, 
  winning percentages of a type of deck vs another . 
  i know everyone modifies their decks as they see fit , but it would be interesting to have an overview of something like how a handlock does vs miracle rogue ( % wins from people that would contribute to your site ), 
  you get and upvote . . and you get an upvote as well ... everyone gets upovtes because you believed in the guys and gave the all this passion throughout all these years !!!, 
  why would anyone be mean to soft voiced bruce willis ? 
  i heard that the sun coming out of the clouds is a pretty rare ocurance, 
  value squire soaking 16 damage, 
  `` spotted at the airport '' and `` set for a medical '' do n't mean anything for me anymore, 
  `` high level competitive scene '' - * cough * ^ ^ ^ daniel ^ ^ ^ is n't ^ ^ ^ legend ^ ^ ^ ** yet ** * cough *, 
  the only time i think mass dispel would be playable is when soul of the forest token druid will be very common, 
  there are like 6 world cups in 20 years : brasil 14 ' ; south africa ' 10 ; germany 06 ' ; korea-japan 02 ' ; france 98 ' and usa 94 ', 
  buffon 's first one was france 98 ' , where gianluca pagliuca was the first choice gk . 
  he was called up for france 98 ' but did n't play in any of the matches ( he was 20 back then - born in 78 ' ) . 
  he then went on to star in all the other 4 world cups ... hence the title , 
  refreshing to see a documentary that is n't paid for by same person that is praised in it, 
  i do n't think you can proc the secret on your turn ... see the paladin `` redemption '', 
  saw him and his gf back in bucharest ... 
  i would n't mind running into them on / r/gonewild, 
  you needed one knife juggler for some extra awesome combo potential, 
  up ** bro ** te !, 
  h. . . how you doin ' ? 
  why is it called '' gentlemen 's cup '' ? 
  is it males and ekops only ? 
  m'lord !, 
  rogues and druids, 
  inner fire + divine spirit in ranked ... pana si [ randuin wrynn ] ( http://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/6708-randuin-wrynn ) e mai consistent decat acea combinatie, 
  si eu mi-am dus priest-ul la lvl 60 repejor si imi placeau combourile de gen care aveau epic sax guy pe fundal . 
  / r/customhearthstone, 
  looking at the table before this last stage it seems that a draw would have meant both teams would avoid relegation ( 90 % ceirtanty ) . 
  it 's very common to see these kind of odds on draws in lower leagues , towards the end of the season , specially in italy . 
  it has also happened on a bigger stage : [ denmark -- sweden finished 2-2 at euro 2004 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/denmark%e2%80%93sweden_football_rivalry ) , a result that sent italy home and meant both nordic teams advanced to the next round . 
  after seeing that the home side has 6 wins in a row i 'll take the away guys not to lose ** @ 2.60 ** . 
  it 's very rare you see a team be so consistent in the lower tiers, 
  sterling had a longer and better season than ox but most of the dominant arsenal fan base around here want him to start for england, 
  people are on the list multiple times , admins are n't responding ... this seems like a mess, 
  it happened to me as well ... did n't understand that german message and my name did n't appear on the list for like 10-15 minutes ... 
  6 in the pink , 3 in the stink, 
  well ... the sheep really got the charge , because it had less than 3 attack . 
  the warrior could n't attack with it because it was n't his turn . 
  the interesting thing is ... if you hex or poly the warsong commander , the resulting [ frog or sheep will also get charge ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoih8ztu5mk ) ( because they are summoned before the commander dies ), 
  he was on the colbert report / the daily show a few times and the hosts made him look like a statistics genius ... maybe that 's why he has some extra popularity here on reddit, 
  mystery solved !, 
  i had a similar thing with a targeted spell recently , but i blamed it on my laggy internet, 
  but ... is he a prince ? 
  [ do n't embassies handle this kind of stuff ? ], 
  / r/hearthmemes anyone ? 
  pretty please ?!, 
  it sure feels like one when you have to hit a 2/1 with it, 
  yeah buddy !!, 
  sign him up , arsene !, 
  he already hate spurs ... 
  i find [ randuin wrynn ] ( http://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/6708-randuin-wrynn ) or whatever variation [ noxious ] ( http://www.twitch.tv/noxious_hs ) uses to be very entertaining, 
  turtles all the way down !, 
  i like how these small teams show great initiative vs traditional powerhouses, 
  then i 'm hoping for some more cahill-esque stuff, 
  there is only one 3/4 in the game ( new priest card ) because blizzard knows they would ruin all the 3 drops, 
  so many mistakes ... 
  i ca n't even ... 
  steaua lost 2-3 key players , they changed the coach and wo n't have any official games before you guys . 
  they are quite scared of you as well . 
  i can see demolisher compete for the 3-drop spot with the harvest golem , but it would only come out on top if he got to stay 2 turns on the board and actually hit minions with his mini-rag damage, 
  does commenting here give some extra raffle entries ?
