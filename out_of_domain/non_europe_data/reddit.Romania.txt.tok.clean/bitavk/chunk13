  handlock has a very slow start and the taunted/shadowflamed watchers help when recover from that start, 
  she started getting some good media coverage after she won in doha earlier this year and nowadays even the prime time news has segments about her , specially when she reaches the later stages of a tournament . 
  tv stations are competing to get the rights to broadcast her matches : the roland garros final was on our version of fox news . 
  i do n't think i ever heard something bad said about her in the press ... so she is in the honeymoon phase : great sporting/cultural personalities showed their support for her and politicians already started to leech of her success . 
  the station is owned by ( the daughter of ) someone that is less liked than the koch brothers , every anchor feels the need to criticize the president and they are frequently mocked on satire shows for their lack of impartiality, 
  what are those vests for ? 
  i remember when i used to get very excited at the possibility of a et ... this wc desensitized me,

  fitting that argentina plays in chelsea blue ... 0 build up play in the first half, 
  podolski to score the winner with a volley from outside the box ; messi bows and gives him the trophy . 
  fucking higuain gets up to see the call then falls down again ... what a joke, 
  neuer is a fucking mad man, 
  football won .

  steaua won the cl in 86 ' and was in the cl or el groups for the past 10 years or something ... 
  i would n't call it obscure . 
  i would stick to the over 2.5 . 
  the romanians did n't have great results in pre-season and they are n't used to the artificial playing surface that the norwegians use . 
  looks like it 's a couple of sizes smaller than he needed, 
  how can she rip ? 
  u wot m8, 
  in order for a foreign player ( non-eu ) to get a work permit he needs to play in something like 60-75 % of his national team 's last x matches ... so most of the buys are mandatory `` heard of `` s,

  well ... there was [ this thing ] ( http://uneddit.com/ ) and i remember it actually showed some of the deleted and edited comments .

  any info on the pots for tomorrow 's draw ? 
  united 's kit looks like a cheap asian knock-off, 
  that will teach the panic sellers that lowered his price back to 10.5 !, 
  mata is the 9 ^ th midfielder if you consider the number of points and the 10 ^ th if you consider the price ... 
  i 'm definitely keeping him during the international break ... and then consider if the next 3 easy fixtures of united can yield some points, 
  same shitty play , no more last minute goals luck . 
  thank god for the international break ... 
  i smell an arsenal fan,
