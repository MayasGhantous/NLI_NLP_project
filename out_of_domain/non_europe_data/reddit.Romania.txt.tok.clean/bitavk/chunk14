  according to the bookies , c9 ( 1.25 ) should stomp tsm ( 3.75 ), 
  s-ar potrivi perfect in sistemul actual si nici nu s-ar supara cand ar reveni giroud ... better than ~ ~ nothing ~ ~ welbeck i guess, 
  i guess monreal and flamini will try their luck at cb from time to time, 
  there are ~ ~ 866 ~ ~ 869 days difference between messi 's and ronaldo 's sons ( if we count the same way as op did ) ... but the data seems to suggest that men have a very fertile period around 23 years , 7 months ~ 15 days, 
  [ dem lips ] ( http://www.kmkz.ro/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/buze-gadea.jpg ), 
  arrested development, 
  team jack !!, 
  noob question ... where do i see my rank from previous seasons ? 
  why make a throwaway , op ? 
  live a little ... 
  needs more [ balut ] ( http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33848/2524782-balut.jpg ), 
  would have been an ok treat if it did n't have any seeds, 
  from what i know , [ they scrape it in to piles ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/marakkanam_salt_pans.jpg/800px-marakkanam_salt_pans.jpg ) an then proceed to fill up the evaporation ponds with the brine once again, 
  if it reached the top i assume somebody bothered to fact check it, 
  that serbian horse placenta would be better, 
  ca n't wait to chant '' danny danny danny welbeck '' to the tune of `` glory , glory , man united '', 
  yeah , [ boyhood teams are everything to a pro player ] ( http://arsenalarsenal.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/vanpersie-little-boy-inside.jpg ), 
  yes , you can draw . 
  both players get the losing screen , but the match counts as a draw : no stars won/lost, 
  mark noble ( 5.5 ) did pretty well for me , except for week one when he missed his pk, 
  his captain brought almost half the points of the gw, 
  taxi drivers all around the world try to scam people that are n't from the area because they know tourists wo n't go out of their way to report them to the authorities . 
  the best you can do is let them know you are planning to stay for a longer period and you already know some locals ... this may make them think twice about scamming you . 
  well posted , fast fingers, 
  what cable provider carries this damn look tv ? 
  sterling better fucking deliver after i trusted him wit the captaincy over costa :(, 
  [ this is not the change you are looking for ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1prr01t.png ), 
  [ this is not the change you are looking for ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1prr01t.png ), 
  his recent form is horrible . 
  i 'll give him one more chance to shine vs spurs then rotate him out before chelsea, 
  [ start your home defenders they said ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fblzgrh.png ), 
  at least ... you did n't captain blackett, 
  5 senior defenders have to cover 4 spots in the busiest period of the year ... this should be fun, 
   why not carefully play diaby against a non-physical side and pray to the 7 gods he wo n't get injured, 
  ftfy, 
  i do n't know if i should feel better about myself when the top players make silly mistakes or i should be angry about their lack of concentration, 
  wow !!!, 
  you won 15 minute control vs control game ... now how about you face zoo and lose in 5 turns ... 
  the plot thickens ... 
  arsene 's reign is now legal in most countries ... so it 's ok to post dirty pics with it, 
  it was n't all that yolo : if his opponent drew fireball he would have put him at 1 hp , thus making him unable to tap the following turn ... so if the last card drawn was n't relevant ( damage or heal ) he would have lost the game anyway . 
  hull are the only team yet to concede, 
  1 assist and 1 clean sheet from a total of 7 players interesting to see what the average amount of points will be, 
  so you had : siggy , sterling and ( 80 % ) aguero / ( 15 % ) bony / ( 5 % ) jelavic, 
  i guess the galatasaray fans were kind enough to give us the rest of their flares, 
  half way to filling the emirates, 
  when i got the golden warleader i had to spend some dust on all the other golden murlocs so i could get the [ rarest card in the game ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lypa9bi.png ), 
  there was a thread concerning [ the rarest cards ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/24uvv8/rarest_cards_in_hearthstone_list/ ) . 
  golden etc will eventually become the rarest due to the fact it 's no longer obtainable . 
  postari prin / r/standup ... you for real dawg ? 
  will we still have 10 minute ads with people deconstructing a chair ? 
  there seems to be a curse for teams that did well at the last wc, 
  + tot ce implica david mitchell , stephen fry sau charlie brooker, 
  you can also get it by using golden mind vision, 
  legendary play right there, 
  inb4 force of nature + savage roar, 
  is n't this like common knowledge for every 5 ^ th grader ? 
  why does mannone get -1 with 8 golas conceded ? 
  i read that ... but it seems like a garbage performance if you only consider the stats . . could he get some negative bonus points ? 
  i recently started levelling up my hunter and i have the opposite problem : everyone adds me after a match ... 
  came to / new for the same reason ... saw the play on reddit earlier this week . 
  guess reynad was right in saying one mistake can cost you the game, 
  did anyone noticed that reynad missed an easy boardclear in game 1 ? 
  play doomsayer and fireball sylvanas ... instant board wipe ... none of the commentators noticed it, 
  got my tinfoil hat on ... ready for the explanation, 
  yeah , amaz kinda baited him in to using the doomsayer by using his silence a turn earlier, 
  ca n't wait for the new ssw singed skin, 
  the reynad pjsalt after his loss was incredible, 
  damn my ocd ... 
  i always keep them in the same order : def , mid and striker, 
  / r/geoguessr if you want to compare scores and take different challenges, 
  just sold him for pelle . 
  70 % ownership meant he could n't give you an edge over any active manager ... time to take some risks , boys !, 
  i 'll just start watching arsenal from the 85 ^ th minute onwards ... 
  that was no bm ... it was the rank 22 basic strategy : play everything that you can in your turn, 
  you should try playing hunter ~ ~ in ranked ~ ~ if you want more friends like this, 
  and newcastle just turned the game around vs sp * rs, 
  ** rip ** premier league title contenders, 
  august 16 - october 26, 
  le saux may will lose this record , but he will still be # 1 in pun potential, 
  naked bgh would have been my only play if i did n't . 
  on his turn he played a venture co. and traded ... then i topdecked soulfire for the yeti and managed to clear the board, 
  e top lel, 
  drunk fuck with a history of drug abuse ... what do you expect ? 
  twitch chat is leaking, 
  ca n't remember if he went to rehab or jail a few months ago ... 
  i think it 's the last we 'll see of prison trump ... at least for a convenient period of time, 
  i 've counted less than 50 different people in the chat ... 
  i demand to get a viewer count !, 
  [ ca n't ever beat this ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ennskbelfa&amp;t=0m35s ), 
  you must have been really lucky in getting different legendaries from packs . 
  i have similar stats to you ( -500 in arena and + 500 in others ) and i 'm missing about 8 cards, 
  trump karaoke flashback, 
  you can see how important it is for him to finally establish himself as a regular in the bpl and subsequently in the national team . 
  prove yourself , panty lemon !, 
  he 's been a starter lately because tatarusanu moved from steaua to fiorentina 's bech, 
  i would have to give the edge to tatarusanu because he has better synergy with all the steaua players at the team . 
  a portuguese in bucharest from what i gather . 
  i guess this is one of the few times in history that romania is close to the level of portugal . 
  it may be worth going considering the stadium is the best in the region and there surely won ; t be any incidents like the ones at the hungary game .
