  fuck yeah , i 'm taller than charizard !, 
  maybe we should go back to our old ways and let the opponents score first ... 
  anti-base pandering, 
  wo n't sign up this year . 
  there is lots of political tension on [ my local subreddit ] ( / r/romania ) due to ongoing elections ... so i would n't want to hamper the joy of researching and giving with all of those things, 
  i just went against my first instinct and reached 12, 
  then the press would be down to one french midfielder permanently linked with us : gourcuff, 
  tottenham : minding the gap even outside the football world, 
  mana for 2xfon + sr = 26 damage from the hand, 
  i promised myself i wo n't level up the hunter ... but my ocd got the better of me and now i have to live with all the self loathing of playing that cancer deck . 
  lord !, 
  what is the name of said software ? 
  the best i could find is [ something that shows the money spent on particular bets ] ( http://arbworld.net/index.php/en/moneyway ), 
  i 'm guessing they saved some money on the interest by paying back the loaned money earlier than the due date . 
  the word `` planned '' is kind of misleading ... but it 's still very impressive they are so financially healthy . 
  drogba must be a very close second, 
  you ca n't get gelbing mekkatorque in packs !!, 
  rip dust devil : one time in arena - gvg expansion, 
  so i guess they will be on track to face bayern once again, 
  you can upboat it in the [ meme subreddit ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthmemes/comments/2klhg1/when_webspinner_gives_me_hungry_crab_against_some/ ) ... foresaw this possibility a month ago, 
  suarez almost bit his own knee right there, 
  `` just wait till i get to 10 mana ! '', 
  ( and have a shit load of spell damage ), 
  add some extra financial motivation , stir in some testosterone and let it develop for a few more years ... 
  jurnalism de tabloid , partinitor si infantil, 
  it makes me think of a decoy effect , similar to noble sacrifice ... and the dynamite ... maybe some aoe or a kind of betrayal for that attacking minion, 
  [ the brode vote is for the hunter card ] ( https://twitter.com/bdbrode/status/537681638839566336 ),

  am gasit un [ loc perfect pentru tine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_state_of_iraq_and_the_levant ), 
  and now i summon gnimsh to comment on this thread and hype the tournament like he always likes to do, 
  a legendary that uses all your mana left that turn and has decent stats ... to celebrate his perfect on curve plays in the final, 
  remove lazy socialist scum, 
  a common you say ... 
  i guess i 'll give druid some extra attention in arena, 
  ah , the drama ... we 've made it , boys !!, 
  i crafted all the golden murlcos ( and had the ones from levelling classes ) after leeroy nerf just so i could get my first golden legendary, 
  do a kripp and pull a 3 games at a time feat, 
  do n't forget about the gadgetzan and soulfire nerfs !!, 
  + soulfire will cost 1, 
  + flare 2, 
  got 2 golden ones ; i 'm surely going to get the best deal anywhere, 
  invite kitkatz as well ... we want some more of that on stream synergy, 
  santi was very confident it wo n't work ... 
  i suspect he tried something similar, 
  [ deathrattle training ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdnqkhq2jrc&amp;t=0m14s ), 
  arsenal and chelsea formed half my team ... cya next week , guys !, 
  chambers as a starter + costa as captain ... ^ ^ at ^ ^ least ^ ^ i ^ ^ got ^ ^ 2 ^ ^ assists, 
  oh , the arrested development nostalgia ... 
  can i dare ask how much money did you end up spending ? 
   no more trophies for my team, 
  we had 2-ish trophies in the last 6 months ... this should quench our thirst for like 10 years, 
  smite =  moonfire, 
  consecration =  dread infernal battlecry for the oponent, 
  kill command =  smite ( without a beast ), 
  eviscerate ( combo ) =  darkbomb, 
  whirlwind =  nothing happens, 
  hellfire =  consecration for everyone, 
  blizzard =  aoe cone of gold, 
  earth shock =  silence, 
  [ care ar fi problema ? 
  [ off topic ] nu stiu daca am avut un thread pe tema asta :, 
  does someone recognise any of the signatures ? 
  pathetique [ nu are conotatii negative ], 
  pathetic = causing or evoking pity , sympathetic sadness , sorrow , etc. 
  ; pitiful ; pitiable [ are conotatii negative ], 
  should have casted mind blast as the first spell ; the first circle was kind of useless, 
  switched my captain from guzan to austin in the last minute ... a gk has less potential and more liability , right ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ ^ long ^ ^ ^ ^ my ^ ^ ^ ^ sweet ^ ^ ^ ^ 10 + ^ ^ ^ ^ points, 
  another nail in the coffin for the `` we rely on sanchez less than others do on their top scorer '' ; hope he can keep it up until the others get some of their form back, 
  the warriror games are right on track for 2015 : long drawn out games that will give you enough xp to advance to level 60 ( 2015/2015 ) after a gruelling ordeal that will last one year, 
  i was told this was a more suitable place to preserve [ my achievement this week ] ( https://i.imgur.com/5ejpfsm.png ), 
  it 's barely day 2 of the season ... 
  i doubt there are more than 5-10 people at legend . 
  these kind of posts should specify how many hours did he take to reach legend since the new season began,

  i 'm afraid to find out how many of them are behind that '' + '', 
  i 've mastered kripp 's patience when it comes to dusting ... and his arena addiction as well, 
  eli5 : i do n't turn surplus cards into dust because of 2 reasons :, 
  i am greedy and want to get more dust ( about 4x ) for them in case blizzard decides to modify the cards in some way . 
  i mostly play arena , a place where you don ; t need cards or dust . 
  my behaviour is very similar to my compatriot and [ famous streamer kripparrian ] ( http://www.twitch.tv/nl_kripp ) , also considered a casual player by some parts of the twitch community, 
  first time seeing a game in a gunner pub . 
  do n't know anyone , the atmosphere is great but i can barely understand any of the accents spoken near me edit : after a pint i 've become a cunning linguist and recognised some gaelic and whatever newcastle blokes use, 
  i 've noticed whenever i choose the `` n/a '' option in the coin/without coin bracket it counts as `` without coin '' match, 
  - glumele self-deprecating ( auto-peiorative ? ),

  fingers crossed and sfincter clenched, 
  my first 1-3 on record : http://www.heartharena.com/arena-run/i514y0, 
  i did n't have any decent 3 & 4 drops and my only chance to get back in the game was putting out some big taunted trees . 
  there was only one problem with this plan : i get wrecked by priests ( and 3/4 opponents belonged to that class ), 
  the worst acting in movie history ; always fun to re-watch it, 
  they did n't bitch about mech mage at all ... they must have made it before the undertaker nerf, 
  [ hooray !,
