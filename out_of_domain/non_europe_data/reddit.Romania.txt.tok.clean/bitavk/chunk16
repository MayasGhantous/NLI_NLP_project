  oh , sure ... 
  it seemed like undertaker was the absolute filth of the earth , but most decks also ran this retarded shit alongside it . 
  for 2 mana you get a 2/2 body that kinda trades 1 for 1 ... 
  but you also get to draw a card ... and you also get to play that flippin card . 
  fuck this shit , when will we raise enough forks to get it nerfed ? 
  i read somewhere that arrogance is a way of dealing with insecurity, 
   one match per week, 
  do they think this is chess or cricket ? 
  unless the matches are bo9 they could easily squeeze the swiss style qualifiers in a weekend . 
  8 weeks are a huge commitment ... 
  i can foresee lots of people forgetting/being unable to show up to their matches . 
  a 32 points hit is insane ; you would need to have the exact team of the week for it to pay off, 
  the second one looks more flexible ; i would n't put in janmaat after looking at his fixtures, 
  lots of new faces on na ... only know firebat from that list, 
  i think the pros would even pay fir this kind of service ; comprehensive data about match-ups will help you make the most important decision for a tournament : what decks to choose .

  seeing ekop so happy made me feel uncomfortable, 
  i met ekop at dreamhack and he seemed like a very chill dude . 
  i think he tried to cultivate a bad guy persona way back when the hearthstone scene was in it 's infancy . 
  he also had that feud with trump ( tuckfrump gate ) , in which the majority of the community did n't take his side ( although a look at twitch chat would tell you otherwise ), 
  it was confirmed that 's how it 's intended to work by [ ben brode ] ( https://twitter.com/bdbrode/status/575322297889751040 ) when the card was announced . 
  alternative scenario :,

  always ending the cl play-off rounds with a win ... in the us we 'd get some rings for this,

  as i said in my post , after you validate the code , you purchase $ 5 worth of amazon coins ( 2500 ) and you will get the equivalent of $ 23 's worth ( 12500 ) . 
  so , all in all you will pay $ 5 + $ 12 ( the code ) = $ 17 for the equivalent of $ 25 worth of coins ( or $ 23 if you were to purchase with their standard promo ),
