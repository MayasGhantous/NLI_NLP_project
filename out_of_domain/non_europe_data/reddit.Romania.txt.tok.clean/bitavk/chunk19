  `` yeah , about the test ... 
  the test will measure whether you are an informed , engaged , and productive citizen of the world , and it will take place in schools and bars and hospitals and dorm rooms and in places of worship . 
  you will be tested on first dates , in job interviews , while watching football , and while scrolling through your twitter feed . 
  the test will judge your ability to think about things other than celebrity marriages , whether you 'll be easily persuaded by empty political rhetoric , and whether you 'll be able to place your life and your community in a broader context . 
  the test will last your entire life , and it will be comprised of the millions of decisions that , when taken together , will make your life yours . 
  and everything , everything , will be on it . '',

  daddy chick 's boys !, 
  wow ... no more `` fixed various issues '' !, 
  do it for the memes !, 
  a . gif should be 3 seconds long , not 3 minutes ... 
  must be the meaning of life ... 
  our anus is ready ... do your thing , giroud !, 
  i think he has ** p ** ea ** k ** ed, 
  would n't call it a weapon ... he was just happy to meet him . 
  uhm ... was n't the goal assister 25 meters offside ? 
  thanks for clearing that out ... did n't come across this situation before . 
  ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/8enbhs81en5kw/giphy.gif ), 
  that 's decent for a mobile phone plan i guess, 
  heh , now i see it as well . 
  i 'm not a week old spam bot and certainly not a developer ( i would have access to a sdk or smth ) ; i 'm just a redditor in need , 
  how are we going to call this guy when he plays for our senior squad ? 
  just wanted to give it a different style ... turns out we do n't have it on this sub , 
  i use chrome on my laptop and 128 gb is my rom memory ... still works fine after 6 years ^ ^, 
  who keeps bluetooth on in 2016 ? 
  valor 's mewtwo was taken down way too quickly, 
  [ bloody united already signed him ] ( http://www.manutd.com/en/news-and-features/football-news/2008/jun/ramsey-fee-agreed.aspx ), 
  if the majority of your activity was in an area that the app was n't available ... that might be a giveaway . 
  i 'm sure the developers implemented ways of gathering such data . 
  i really do n't mind it ... it would be fair ... got my fix ahead of everyone else and made my city all blue ^ ^, 
  [ this guy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bvshskt.png ) would have gotten you 69 % more matches !, 
  i did n't know how to place it for the first days :d, 
  now you have to make him a gym leader in a church !, 
  your names indicates you are a female ; contemporary society views you as the one with the power of offering sex , thus this would n't be an achievement for thou . 
  how do you know they did it in the stink ? 
  [ ok , slowpoke ... ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/4t87wg/heres_why_3_step_is_broken/ ), 
  was it the same situation after you logged in again ? 
  did you download the . apk before the official release ? 
  did you do something shady with virtual gps location ? 
  i was trying to convey the message through the voice of someone socially awkward or from another planet  . 
  whilst i agree with you on that being an unhealthy way of thinking , i would like to propose an experiment to you : take a heterosexual couple of some 20-year olds ( they are together =  they should have similar degrees of `` hotness '' ) . 
  if each of them goes and asks 100 people on the street to have sex with them , i can guarantee you that the girl would get a majority of yes answers , whilst the guy will get a majority of no answers , along with some slaps in the face and maybe some threats . 
  nice ... 3 eevees coming right up !, 
  women have sex with whomever/whatever they want , so do men ... 
  i 'd suggest you check the stats in the sex industry ... you will easily see that the overwhelming majority of sex workers are women . 
  there clearly is a higher demand for women in sex ... it 's the fucking oldest job in the world and will continue to exist until they perfect some female sex robots . 
  hey , this has gone far beyond anything related to pokemon . 
  both our ides are correct in some situations and wrong in others and depending on our upbringing and social environment we will incline to believe in some rather than others . 
  we could argue all day long , start launching personal attacks and nitpick stuff but this is n't the place to do so , 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ heyguyshow ` sitgoingkripparrianhere turns out he is pretty good, 
  oh , how the turntables have ... 
  gps spoofing and pokevision seems like the only way to achieve this so fast, 
  use thesilphroad calcularltor to see the exact level . . or you can power it up twice and if the 3rd power up would cost the same that means it 's a +95 %, 
  4 steps ; dust price changes at levels 3 , 5 , 7 ... and each power-up is 0.5 of a level, 
  200 is 1 , 1.5 , 2 and 2.5, 
  yeah , that 's true ... and when you catch or hatch a pokemon , it always has a full level , never .5 . 
  the dust steps get more expensive faster , they are n't a arithmethic progression . 
  pound and play rough ... oh , wiggly ... 
  arsenal legend !, 
  3 titles as a manager , all of them between 2004-2006 with the best teams in their respective countries , then nothing ... really like the guy as a person and i 'm happy to see another [ kinda ] romanian involved in british football ... but he seems like an odd choice ; probably has a good agent, 
  found arsene wenger 's account !, 
  2 cp off being an elite specimen !, 
  walcott to play 30 + games and get 10 goals, 
  if this is true ... 
  i will get 2 onyx from my 10km :( from my research i 'm leaning towards sorted by cp ... a table with level 20 pokemon cp range would be interesting ... 
  brought in vardy ( c ) instead of ibra after seeing hull 's situation ... let 's go !, 
  hull , you fools ... do n't attack ... that 's what leicester want you to do, 
  my captain geting 2x2 on the first game of the day ... guess some things never change, 
  need +100 revives to make this image seem more realistic, 
  i think height and weight only affect the damag taken by low kick or high kick, 
  so he 's saying there 's a chance !, 
  lost it at astra goo-goo !, 
  seminte !, 
  i wasted something like 20k dust on powering up a rattata : put the phone in my pocket , an egg hatched and by some magic it started to power him up :(, 
  she forgot to ask him what does he think of tottenham, 
  we are punished by having lower catch rates and higher flee rates, 
  level 25 with 103 captured in pokedex ... still no pikachu :(, 
  now his list of teams that he played at wo n't be a palindrome :(, 
  i kinda of grown to like spoofers ... i still write a page long report when i have enough evidence to send niantic ... but having a high level bad guy motivates me to be better . 
  [ pe gratis ] triggered !, 
  clear the game 's cache, 
  i think the title is talking about epl games . 
  we won some matches with him in the cups ( including away at united ) . 
  he is mainly a derby guy though : http://i.imgur.com/mfqpnjs.png, 
  sauce for all matches : http://uk.soccerway.com/referees/michael-oliver/60878/, 
  the 3 cs : city , county [ departments ? ], 
  and country, 
  why are there tree leaves inside what i assume to be an indoor office ? 
  never skip the kripp, 
  watching the game at anfield i heard a chant about saint cazorla ; something like [ the old eboue one ] ( http://fanchants.co.uk/football-songs/arsenal-chants/eboue-africa/ ) . 
  did anyone get the words ? 
  i think it 's going to be sang very often and i want to get that away boyz vibe when i watch the games . 
  if someone missed the match today ... [ here it is ] ( http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7639224 ) . 
  it 's my first match upload and i tried to get the best quality i could find . 
  ** please submit your other links too **, 
  ** edit : ** do n't get your hopes very high ; i kinda britta 'd the video quality a bit :,
