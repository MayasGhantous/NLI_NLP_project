  great torrent overall though !, 
  first of all , do n't ever ask for honors : i 've seen guys that carried the game 20-0 and then bragged about that until i lost my `` want to honor '' boner . 
  the best role to play in order o get some honor from your team is support ... you 're basically mr helpful friendly teamwork . 
  in normal or ranked games you probably wo n't get anything unless the game goes on for 30 + and you win ... but vs bots ... there 's a completely different story, 
  the non-stress atmosphere in ** co-op vs ai ** has the most honor yield . 
  i 've never played a game without getting any . 
  last game i got 3 teamwork and 1 friendly so i decided i had to share this with the world . 
  so next time you want to get your daily ip bonus and you 're not in the mood for pvp ... go for the bots , take a champ with some healing powers ... and help your team . 
  i do n't know if badges help ... but maybe they will be useful in avoiding some trolls or flamers, 
  i know many offline gamblers like to place their bets for the weekend all at once ... so here are my picks . 
  i do n't have much to write about every game but i checked the tips from 2-3 sources so i 'm predicting about 80 % of them will be right .

  i wanted to find an answer to early 3/2 drops and it seems they can trade 1 for 1 with all 3 drops except the harvest golem . 
  i kinda get the feeling that 2 mana 3/2s can snowball pretty fast and using spells on them can put you a little further behind . 
  what happened exactly :, 
  he played rag + summoned a token --  i use mind control tech and get the rag --  `` justice demands retribution '' and uses faceless my newly acquired rag ( hits my face ) --  i topdeck another mind control tech and 25 % his rag again --  ragequit, 
  after 600 + arena wins ( 65 % win rate ) i finally got my [ first clean dream ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ab5nv ) . 
  i managed to put some of the knowledge i gathered in this list of tips ; i hope they help you in case you decide to play some arena whilst the ladder is settling down, 
  ** hero selection **, 
  - mage , druid and rogue are tier 1 picks because their hero ability affects the board, 
  - paladin and shaman are tier 2 because they heavily rely on board control, 
  ; priest , warlock , warrior and hunter should be avoided unless you have a quest with them, 
  ** deck drafting **, 
  - always pick removal cards early on and make sure you have at least 5 of them,
