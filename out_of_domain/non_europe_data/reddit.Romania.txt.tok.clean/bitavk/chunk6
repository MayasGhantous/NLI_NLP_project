  * tottenham vs newcastle -, 
  ** over 3.5 goals @ 2.50 ** games where newcastle plays strong teams tend to go over ... plus the game is played very early in the day , which usually facilitates the scoring of golas . 
  * sunderland vs arsenal -, 
  arsenal to win by exactly one goal ** @ 3.75 **, 
  * southampton vs man city, 
  ** 1x @ 2.2 ** the saints are in good shape recently and city is n't usually that great away from home, 
  * swansea vs qpr - under 2.5 @ 2.00 the swans will dominate possession but qpr 's defence can cope with swansea 's attacking power . 
  on the other hand , new signing remy is still out for qpr , same as andy johnson, 
  it 's just something i saw in the epl fixtures , especially when top 6 teams played : tottenham 's 5-2 games vs arsenal ; [ this ] ( http://uk.soccerway.com/matches/2012/12/01/england/premier-league/west-ham-united-fc/chelsea-football-club/1293830/ ) [ this ] ( http://uk.soccerway.com/matches/2012/10/28/england/premier-league/everton-football-club/liverpool-fc/1293764/ ) , [ this ] ( http://uk.soccerway.com/matches/2012/12/29/england/premier-league/sunderland-association-football-club/tottenham-hotspur-football-club/1293880/ ) [ this ] ( http://uk.soccerway.com/matches/2012/12/09/england/premier-league/manchester-city-football-club/manchester-united-fc/1293835/ ) or [ this ] ( http://uk.soccerway.com/matches/2012/12/15/england/premier-league/newcastle-united-football-club/manchester-city-football-club/1293844/ ),

  * st.johnstone vs celtic - ** st johnstone to score @ 1.65 ** they were really unlucky not to score in the last match . 
  played a good game against ross county . 
  celtic showed a permeable defense last game . 
  celtic is on a 5 game winning streak in the league and although they are the superior team , they do n't do that well away from home . 
  some small stakes on st.johnstone to win ** @ 6.50 ** or not to lose @ 2.35, 
  * arsenal vs bayern - bayern to score at least 2 goals ** @ 1.90 ** . 
  arsenal will have to improvise for the lb spot ( gibbs injured , santos loaned , monreal cup tied ) , the rb sagna is out of form plus the cbs are prone to clumsy mistakes . 
  on the other side , bayern looks like the perfect side to capitalize on this kind of weakness . 
  * barnsley vs wolves - under 2.5 ** @ 1.90 ** ; wolves will have some regular defenders back to the lineup . 
  it seems likely they will play their regular all man back and hope for a counterattack or a longshot by o'hara,
