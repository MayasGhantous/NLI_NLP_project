  city . 
  united is unbeaten in the last 14 games and streaks like that usually end fast . 
  my money is on qpr not losing and a low scoring game . 
  i got bayern to score over 2.5 golas in the cl so i ca n't argue with the knowledge of a true fan . 
  i 'll rather see you win the title over city any day ... so give robin some silverware ... * sigh *,

  in romania , `` br\u00e2nz\u0103 '' is the most widely used word for cheese and it mainly refers to the traditional kind , usually made by farmers . 
  this , along with the pronunciation of the word ( with that sharp `` z '' ) supports the idea that it 's one of the few hundred dacian words still in use in the romanian language . 
  also , in the transilvania region ( formerly occupied by the austro-hungarians ) it 's common that the cheese be referred as `` ca\u015f '' ... thanks to the german influence,

  dacian was n't related to latin .

  chelsea vs spurs in the el final and we could hope for 3rd place, 
  we are 2 points behind chelsea and 4 behind spurs ( and one game in hand ) ... so because they face each other one or both or them wo n't get the 3 points , thus allowing us to overtake them ** if ** we do n't screw up more than them, 
  but ... 3 ^ rd place is more than a trophy ... is n't it ?

  more like jon snu snu, 
  20 minutes or less covered also covered some older news stories . 
  i always thought they stopped it because they ran out of old good quality material ... 
  i do n't think you can get a good 20 minutes just from the daily stories . 
  breaking bad, 
  i live in a country with 20 million people and we have about 8 full time national news networks ...

  they get along very well as friends but do n't seem able to evolve romantically,

  newcastle vs benfica : newcastle to score,
