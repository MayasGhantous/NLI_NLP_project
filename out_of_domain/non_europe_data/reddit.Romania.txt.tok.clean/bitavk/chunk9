  total epl games : 380,

  seems very surprising considering the epl has only 2 extra teams, 
  welcome to reddit , james carville !, 
  well , i did the math but i was surprised to see that 2 extra teams mean 25 % more matches,

  betting high amounts of money on low odds that seem like sure things is the worst thing you can do, 
  well let 's say you pick 4 events with odds @ 1.15 thus giving you a combined combo of ** @ 1.75 ** . 
  a 75 % profit seems nice but is it worth the risk ? 
  if you bet on 1x2 type bets the mathematical odds of you winning are ** @ 81 ** . 
  if you bet on over/under type bets the mathematical odds of you winning are ** @ 8 **, 
  if you bet on who is not going to win/lose type bets the mathematical odds of you winning are ** @ 5 **, 
  i know that in the long term ( that potential 50 bets ) the numbers will come back to bite you . 
  this small odds give you a false sense of security and make you think you can bet high amounts . 
  maybe it 's just me but i like being close to predicting some @ 5 event rather than sweat around praying that my @ 1.15 wo n't ruind my budget . 
   7 games on 1.1 odds will much more likely pass than 1 game of 2.0 odds, 
  can you explain this in any way ? 
  and the orcs in last place ... seems legit !, 
  because the time you spend downvoting a entire subreddit is definitely worth all the self-doubting and bad feelings that all those people would get seeing more blue votes , right ?

  not just someone , but you ... a person who has no clue about betting but insists about preaching a flawed system and promoting a shitty facebook page . 
  btw , spain barely won by 1-0 ... so yeah ... keep on with your safe bets mate ... let me know when you get 7 @ ** 1.10 ** bets in a row so i can make your money back, 
  the comeback king ... you ca n't think of any rational argument and resort to low end insults that are worse than your betting picks . 
  i have nothing against trying new stuff on this subreddit specially considering it has few active members . 
  the thing i was butthurt about was you not explaining why 7 bets of @ 1.10 were way better than a @ 2.00 one ... that 's all . 
  when you posted some tips and you backfired on that @ 1.08 i just had to say something ... just to rub it in ... i hope you understand me . 
  all i wanted to do was tell you and other people to be more careful ... maybe just pick 20-30 @ 1.10 odds and see how many they get right ... then proceed to putting money on them .

  another glitch in the could rendering ? 
  # 4 million buy back clause on a # 3.5 million transfer seems too good to be true . 
  his current market value is # 10 million so we could buy him and sell him immediately ... making a sweet ~ 6 million in the process, 
  yeah ... but a good season in the champions league or reaching a late stage of the europa league could boost his rating and he is still only 24, 
  yeah , the deal was probably done during the summer , just before his [ value started rising ] ( http://www.transfermarkt.com/en/carlos-vela/mwverlaufgraph/spieler_35773.html ) . 
  the clause was probably reasonable even though vela said he did n't want to come back to arsenal somewhere in the past . 
  oh well , in hindsight it would have been wiser if we put in a ~ 20 % of next sale clause .
