  balls !, 
  in my part of the world ( i.e. 
  transylvania ) it 's not uncommon to see hazel-eyed , brown-haired gypsies , even blue-eyed or blond . 
  you can recognize them by the way they dress : men have black hats with stiff large brims , black waistcoats , huge droopy mustachios , women have long plaits and wear shrill colored flower-patterned skirts in multiple layers . 
  shirts are usually white . 
  both like to wear big eye-catching gold jewelry . 
  they almost always travel in groups . 
  most likely , you 'd not recognize one of them as * gypsy * at first sight , if not for the way they dress . 
  so , i 'd say it 's more a way-of-life-slash-culture than a race . 
  edit : i had almost forgotten . 
  they * do * speak their own tongue , not closely related to any of the surrounding ones . 
  that would go in the `` race '' column , i guess .

  [ small businesses do not produce ample jobs ] ( http://www.winonadailynews.com/news/opinion/editorial/columnists/article_99b08204-cc52-11e1-bb5c-0019bb2963f4.html?comment_form=true ) . 
   consider europe 's crisis . 
  greece , portugal , spain and italy -- the countries with the most profound economic problems -- are among the countries with the largest percentage of workers employed by small businesses . 
  meanwhile , as the new yorker 's financial analyst , james surowiecki , recently pointed out , the countries with the lowest percentage of workers employed by small business -- germany , sweden , denmark and the united states -- are some of the strongest economies in the world . 
   the correlation is not a coincidence , according to surowiecki . 
  `` it reflects a simple reality : small businesses are , on the whole , less productive than big businesses , '' he writes in the magazine . 
  and people who run small companies are n't necessarily interested in owning big businesses . 
  `` most are people who simply want to run a small company , do the work they enjoy and have some control over their own financial lives . 
  ... small may be beautiful . 
  it 's just not all that prosperous . '',

  for much of the cold war the us was n't an unconditional ally of israel . 
  not in the 1956 suez crisis , not in the 1973 yom kippur war . 
  the * unconditional * bit came after the camp david accords in 1979 and in the early '80s . 
  i 'm sure this only happened because of the drought and of el nino . 
  they closed because of lack of raw materials or because they were forced to sell their products at prices below production costs .

  still , very close . 
  and with a long shared history . 
  if russia wipes the middle east clean , israel has no reason anymore to be a junior ally to either russia or the us . 
  that 's more because of the physical feature of the carpathians than anything political .
