  edit :, 
  he looks like he just told a joke and he 's waiting for you to laugh, 
  this guy does n't get the credit that he should, 
  i should have googled nsfl first, 
  here 's another nice rant on kony http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om17yhzrxte, 
  you shoul try boom fest ... it 's in portugal every two years http://www.mycitybynight.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/boom-festival.jpg, 
  yeah ... like people who shout '' shut hut the fuck up '' on the internet, 
  come to romania . . no one cares that you 're muslim here ... yet, 
  what 's the name of the super hero ? ... who can i reach him ? ... is he the poop throwing guy ? 
  e paris, 
  ma refeream la haosul care s-a creeat acuma, 
  went better then expected, 
  you sure know how to have fun, 
  actually plants can feel pain ... more like they react to the cutting by releasing a sent that makes the other plants around grow more viciously, 
  cause it works ? 
  the transistor . . good . . but i would go deeper . 
  how about electricity ? 
  not half as shocking as these http://www.boredpanda.com/top-10-most-shocking-fountains-in-the-world/, 
  so cheres mo, 
  and keep your foot under the blanket so the killer wo n't grab it, 
  in my second year of college * architecture * ... we had a deadline and after 3 days of not sleeping as i was sitting in my room finishing the project i just stoped and looked around , then i began to ask my self ( is this real ? . . am i real ? ... wtf am i doing here ? ), 
  then all of sudden a chill went through my body and i started panicking ... then the felling got worse and worse as i was starting to panic more and more . . the i thought ( am i going insane ? ... is this how going insane feels like ? 
  ) ... and the it got even worse , i was running out of breath , my heart was pounding , then another feeling occurred ( what if i 'm gon na get so scared that i 'll dye , my heart will stop ore something ) ... eventually i calmed down saying to my self that i 'm very tired and that it 's all in my head ... but from day that strange feeling stayed somehow in the back of my head ... and every time i panic really bad about something that chill comes back and i 'm like * oh no not again * ... but now i calm down really quick, 
  edit : sorry for my bad spelling, 
  i got that feeling on a bad trip ... then when i had my first real panic attack whit out being on anything i thought to my self ... heeey this feeling is familiar and that is when i really started to panic ... eventually i said to my self that i 'm tired and i have to clam down cause this is stupid ... so it went away, 
  | modify the way we see thoughts and feelings so they ca n't push us around and control our behavior . 
  segal calls that process disidentifying with thoughts -- seeing them not as who we are but as mere reactions . 
  that is how i calmed my self down, 
  from romania ... school is free , hospital is free ... and we can drink from the age of 18,

  [ stop it you ] ( http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/oh-stop-it-you.png ),

  they can barely speak english ? ... wow how stupid are you ? 
  haha that 's at a romanian wedding, 
  cause she could n't keep up with him, 
  in his head he is doing the dance perfectly because he is probably drunk, 
  from what i know light has mass but it 's so small and insignificant that when calculating it 's considered 0 ... and the force of a black hole is so huge that it can even interact whit the light and bend it pulling it inside, 
  yes and it has been discovered that some species of big dinosaurs had feather not skin like reptiles ... and they are speculating that even some species of t-rex had feathers ... just like ostriches, 
  yes , my bad ... species of tyrannosaurus ... i think that 's correct now, 
  creationist should see this . . then they would n't have any arguments against evolution, 
  it because of the people who listen to manele, 
  probably awkward,

  but you can say `` ziua buna `` it 's fine, 
  yeah it outdated but you can still use if you want, 
  true ... but in maramures for example people , well older people at least still, 
  use it ... but you are probably right it 's better to use `` buna ziua '' than `` ziua buna '',
