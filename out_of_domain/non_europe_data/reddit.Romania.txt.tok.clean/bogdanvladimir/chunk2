  the soldiers carrying the execution received special orders not to shoot them in the face so that people will recognize them after they are dead,

  the only rwd gallardo is the valentino balboni version .

  and you can spin like that in a awd drive car . 
  you just have to be knob head . 
  da pune-ti mintea cu o gloata de nationalisti ultra religiosi ... what could go wrong ? 
  huh ? 
  a friend of mine fucked up like that . 
  on his 24 ` th birthday his gf made him a surprise and bought two plane tickets to fly to another country . 
  if you 're flying inside the eu you do n't need a passport just a valid id card . 
  so the moron did n't bring his passport just his id witch they discovered that it was expired when they handed it over at check in . 
  needles to say his girl friend started crying ( she just lost 400euros and the trip ) , he was desperately calling us to bring him his passport . 
  the airport was at about a 3 hours drive and the plane was do to depart in 50 min it was literally impossible for us to get to him in time so we just laughed at him . 
  his id card had expired on his birthday . 
  edit : bad english, 
  shut the fuck up, 
  how says that ? 
  maybe ignorant dumb fuck 's . 
  you should n't have to clarify every time someone says anything about gypsy people . 
  who does n't know there is a difference between romanians and romas or hungarians and romas ore bulgarians and romas the 're probably just as ignorant as dose trying to explain every time what is the difference .

  that 's not russian ... it 's romanian ( the song ) , but the romanian spoken in moldova probably ... 
  the writing is cyrillic probably russian, 
  if the horses ears are bent like that it means it 's scared/aggressive and is probably going to bite you . 
  also , horses are not dogs they do n't need to smell your hand before you approach them .

  that 's like visiting the inside of an atomic clock, 
  a possibility is to fly a big ship next to the object slightly modifying it 's trajectory with the gravitational field generated by the large ship just enough to miss the earth . 
  but obviously this has it 's limitations . 
  the ship has to be pretty large in order to have a significant amount of gravitational pull . 
  the object ca n't be very big . 
  and we would have to discover the object years in advance . 
   if you stay for a longer period , expect to lose some weight . 
  food here does n't have corn syrup in it . 
  are you implying she is fat ?

  as an european i do n't get it either, 
   mixing all my food on my plate so i get a bit of everything with each bite, 
  that actually how you 're supposed to eat most foods .

   the architect probably has little imput besides the fact that he makes sure the plans respect existing regulations, 
  from this picture it does n't look that the buildings respect any urban planning regulations so i doubt that architects were involved in projects like these . 
  i bet they do n't have building permit . 
  check fashion in pinterest and tumblr . . you 'll find loads of inspirational photos, 
  they look to close to each other but not touching ( calcan ) . 
  there 's probably a meter between the buildings . 
  from what i know you need to have `` height to distance between buildings '' ratio so you do n't obstruct your neighbor .

  there was a story a few years back , where some villagers exhumed a recently deceased , took his heart out ( as you do ) ... burned it and drank the ashes . 
  the idea was that the spirit of the deceased would stop bothering them . 
  [ here 's a link to story that i could find ] ( http://translate.google.ro/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.evz.ro%2fdetalii%2fstiri%2ftemutii-strigoi-cu-inima-intepata-si-arsa-895276.html ) .

  it 's true , but it sounds noroc, 
  it 's a pretty complicated language . 
  i learned that when i was trying to explain to a swedish friend how to speak proper romanian . 
  i could n't tell her why you say that and not that i just knew the correct pronunciation . 
  so yeah , it 's kinda hard to learn it if you did n't speak it as child . 
  as a pole you ca n't be an illegal immigrant in uk .
