  tiny cox . 
  he is an uk politician i believe . 
  learned about him on charlie brooker 2012 wipe, 
  this also stands true when shaking hands . 
  dunn would be proud, 
  romani as in nationalitate . 
  my phone . 
  or a pillow . 
  i guess my phone then . 
  it 's more like a yawn now, 
  vader mean father in dutch . 
  i think, 
   judo, 
  ftfy, 
  it was meant as a satire made by some gandul.ro readers witch was the newspaper that responded to guardians satire campaign . 
  the romanian campaign was also meant as a satire . 
  never every go full retard, 
  the romanian campaign was `` if your country is so dreadful come to romania cause it 's nicer '', 
  i think he 's imagining that all east europeans speak english with a rusian accent . 
  also . 
  do n't hit with a full force . 
  cause you will break your hand . 
  when fighting bear knuckled of course . 
  which presumably you are , if you are in a bar or on the street . 
  edit : spelling, 
  avoid chit chatter . 
  oh man i 'd fit right in, 
  english is not my first language . 
   also , some people are just smarter, 
  whilst that might be true . 
  i had a colleague at the university . 
  he did n't use to study much when we had our finals but he always got great marks . 
  i mean he had a scholarship and all that . 
  i would need to study like crazy to achieve dose grades . 
  so i asked him what dose he do that he has dose results . 
  and he said that he pays attention in class , i mean he could concentrate for a full straight hour only in the professor even if the subject in matter was n't very interesting . 
  i could n't . 
  if i do n't like the subject then my mind wonders of after 20 seconds of paying attention . 
  so i guess the important thing is to study what you like . 
  huh ?!, 
  well enlighten us with your wisdom master . 
  much better, 
  also romanian revolution . 
  broke my humerus in three places arm wrestling . 
  big ass scar, 
  eastern europeam usually refers to former communistic countries . 
  east of berlin, 
  i read an article where it was stated that dead skin cells protect you from bacteria . 
  so it might be some truth to that . 
  it 's a silly game . 
  ne jucam the odd one out ? 
  yes he is, 
  do you really speak english like that or was it just an accent you had to put on for the show ? 
  chill,

   instead , interior minister hans-peter friedrich has demanded that the eu make money available for the integration of roma into their native countries . 
  buna idee . 
   oh get the hell out of here with this garbage !, 
   are you fucking retarded ? 
   you fucking idiot , you fucking apologetic scum sucker . 
  i hate you and everyone like you . 
   you are utterly insane , and should be committed to an institution .
