  he does n't like the 599 if i remember correctly, 
  look at the door mirror , interior and the door handle, 
  i think it 's actually a 360 modena [ link ] ( http://imgur.com/eqosgzd ), 
  add fresh mozzarella and basil . 
  heaven, 
  warning : kinda gross, 
  it was on a qi episode some while back ... but i cant remember the series . 
  maybe f . 
  si [ a day in the life of krafty kuts & a.skillz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=dgb8fdnfgcu ), 
  that happened in my town in romania last year . 
  the idiot parked on the tram tracks . 
  so the tram conductor stopped for a bit used the tram horn , nobody came so he just shoved the car out of the way with the tram . 
  he 's well hydrated, 
  and lotus, 
  also this brave move by [ kimi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yscldcxttrk ) on schumacher on [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2cnqapshv0 ) corner at spa2012, 
  yes ... and he used kers which gives you another 80bhp boost , which is pretty brave . 
  edit : spelling, 
  cool, 
  at least we 'll still see him at le mans, 
  yep . . butt crack, 
  it 's the moisture in the branch boiling over .

  yeah ... i 'll probably stick to, 
  [ o.z.o.r.a ] ( http://ozorafestival.eu/ ) and, 
  question : would n't adding some sort of turning vents at the back of the car ( like dose at the back of the front tire ) have the same effect ( straightening out some of the turbulent air ) which would allow the following car to follow up more closely ? 
  enforced by fia and made standard for every team . 
  or they have to produce a maximum of turbulent air . 
  they are pieces of cloth with prayers on them .

  18:18:23 ----- 18:18:24 that is where the video jumps, 
  edit : from 18:18:22 -18:18:23, 
  or it rained . 
  judging by the joints in the pavement i think it has,

  nsfw, 
  also you can use hola unblocker for chrome . 
  it vrey straight forward . 
  just install it go to bbciplayer click hola extension switch to uk and boom . 
  it also works for a lot of other sites . 
  try this . 
  belive it or not it even easier . 
  still not as bad as this, 
  is n't the visor made from plastic ? 
  how did it not melt from that heat ? 
  or hola unblocker, 
  oh god i ca n't breath !, 
  that 's so funny .

  edit : happy to see fellow romanians around here, 
  what 's giddy ? 
  yep . 
  feel the same . 
  they 're like the underdogs of the top teams . 
  at least that 's how i see them . 
  in brazil is it dacia duster ? 
  or renault duster ? 
  / r/polandball, 
  that font gave me cancer . 
  there is no conflict per se . 
  media and dumb politicians like to stir shit up . 
  that being said the szekely minority living in transilvania ( the vast majority living in covasna an hargita county ) have their own identity . 
  there were some conflicts between romanian ethnics and szekeley etnics just after the 89 '' revolution ( some street fights ) . 
  what they want is for the romanian government to recognize the szekely region as autonomous . 
  i suggest reading about szekely romanians and transilvania . 
  world war one and two is for a better understanding . 
  i broke my humerus like that !, 
  foarte interesant interviul cu [ stephen fry ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyrbzh2peji ), 
   hungarians which could barely speak romanian because they refused to , which demanded all kinds of stupid rights in college just because they were hungarian and which talked shit of us, 
  i 'm sure you have . 
  i 've also met hungarians who hate on romanians for some reason , and romanians how hate on hungarians . 
  but that is not the norm .

  he 's getting a little over confided with his predictions , the power has gone to his head . 
  alonso beating kimi does n't change the fact that he 's is a great driver,

  it 's not good quality but you can hear them talk, 
  we have done it romania . 
  we went full retard . 
  bullshit , it 's lotion . 
  i want to see more of these, 
  print screen-uri din sketchup si colate in paint . 
  si totusi te-ai chinuit sa lasi un comment . 
  it looks like it 's melting, 
  if you look closely the shorts have knee caps and they probably have chest and back protection under the shirts .
