the review sums everything up nicely . 
  one more thing that needs to be mentioned is the very advanced editor that comes with the game and which will allow anyone ( with enough free time on their hands ) to create custom content . 
  * designed to run on linux , * bsd , sunos , windows , mac os x , etc ... 
  * extendable with tcl scripts and/or c modules, 
  * support for the big five irc networks ( undernet , dalnet , efnet , ircnet , and quakenet ), 
  * the ability to form botnets and share partylines and userfiles between bots, 
  * the oldest irc bot still in active development ( eggdrop was created in 1993 ), 
  * established irc help channels and web sites dedicated to eggdrop, 
  * countless premade tcl scripts and c modules, 
  * best of all ...

  whenever i run a scan and the antivirus does n't find anything i become paranoid and start thinking that the computer must be infected with something that tampered with the antivirus or that it 's infected with a virus so new that the antivirus simply can not detect it .

  how much did that overshooting hurt ? 
  anything broken ? 
  no it does n't !, 
  i am actually in the process of downloading lotro ( 6 minutes remaining ) . 
  i migrated my account on which i used to have a level 42 guardian but after reading that post i wonder if i should continue the guardian or start a new character . 
  it seems a lot of changes have been made that make a lot of guardians unhappy , since the last time i 've played . 
  same here . 
  i love sword and board and heavy armor . 
  also since i 'm not a power player and i mostly play alone , i doubt i 'll notice any major change , so i 'll keep leveling my guardian . 
  it 's not like i 'll have a hard time keeping the mobs focused on me when i 'm the only one there , 
  you should totally save this post ( printscreens or something ) so when she 's older she can make a post called something like : `` 15 years ago my dad posted this on reddit ... 
  i hope you are still proud dad ! '', 
  and it will get huge amounts of upvotes and it will land on the first page and you will see it and comment on her post , and you 'll both receive incredible amounts of karma . 
  what i do every night ... try to get on the front page !, 
  shopped, 
  login still fails ... it 's sad really ... 
  i am so glad i found this subreddit !, 
  it always makes my day , 
  look with lust at someone and you go to hell , rape someone and you 'll have to pay her father 50 bucks . 
  sounds legit . 
  i do n't understand what is the point of mixing bronze , silver and gold together in the same tournament ? 
  seems to me there is no way someone in bronze can win this . 
  or am i wrong ? 
  it 's awesome !,
