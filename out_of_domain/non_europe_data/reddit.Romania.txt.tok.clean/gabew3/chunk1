thanks m8, 
  great idea , thanks for sharing . 
  during my dark times it 's really easy to forget the happy moment where you did n't had a worry or the persons who love you . 
  try to see yourself in third person , no one is aware of how you feel , no one knows you . 
  you got the job because of fucking deserve it , it 's gon na be a nice experience . 
  as jahmonaut said , you are making progress !, 
  either you fail or not this is gon na be a new experience , i always like to take the fails as lessons or try to learn something from them , even throught i feel like i 'm lying to myself sometimes it help . 
  it is good because you 're gon na experience new things and new people , it 's gon na get you out of your usual routine . 
  best of luck , mate !, 
  i do n't know how to feel but except the medicine and the concert part you 've managed to describe my entire existence . 
  i feel like i 'm some sort of tv show ... oh this is really weird . 
  may i ask you what 's the purpose of this ? 
  nope , i meant the text . 
  uh , i feel you m8 , happend to me too . 
  in my case i could n't get her out of my head , i just could n't . 
  it just happened through time , i still think about her when i 'm lonely but i 'm not thinking about her 12/24 , hang on m8 , time should take care of you . 
  i nearly drowned when i was 13 or so . 
  me and some friends went to swim in a river and there was some big-ass hole in the river , i was like `` oh i 'm going closer '' , i was in neck-level water when the curent started to drag me in , in the last moment my friend pulled me out .

  cam cat a durat sa invatati za basic stuff to get you hired ?

  thanks for advice , mate . 
  [ 2012-2012 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2hwdjizaxa&amp;list=plbf7b50b40805f0e6 ) ( ? , nu stiu daca albumul are un nume ), 
  tnr all the way http://www.timesnewroman.ro/?vid=&amp;mid=tnr&amp;act=is&amp;search_target=title_content&amp;is_keyword=cheloo, 
  so there was a time when ask.fm was really popular in my area and my crush had one , since i 'm quite shy and socially awkward i decided to ask her some anonymous question , what is she doing/reading/listeting to , whatever . 
  i guess it became kinda weird when she started to ask who i was , after a while i said that i was on a school trip with her during 6th grade , we only saw each other , did n't had any conversation . 
  i remember being in a hallway with her and that 's all , i 'm just stuck with that memory . 
  after a while i stopped to ask her anything . 
  few months forward , i posted something on facebook and she liked it , i had to give everyone a message saying * insert joke here * , it was kind of a dare . 
  anyway , so i message her and we started to talk , had a few things in common , she 's quite lovely but proud af , as me i guess . 
  anyway , after a few weeks she casually asks `` so you 're that anonymous guy from ask.fm '' ? 
  it was a little weird but i admitted . 
  only after i stopped talking to her it hit me how awkward it was for her . 
  thanks for advice , man !, 
  guys , i 'm thinking about buying a canon 600d with a 18-55mm lens , i thought about getting into photography for some times , i just do n't want to forget about the camera and let it collect dust .

  i like the idea , thank you !, 
  ... me too,

  why k8 m8 ? 
  [ removed ], 
  hi guys , i do n't really know how to start this or what i 'm looking for or even if this is a good subreddit for a theard like this . 
  i ca n't decide if i want an advice or my questions to be seen , i may be incoherent . 
  i often wonder if i 'm too emotionally mature for my age , most of guys my age are running after girls cars or cheap stuff , i do n't know how to explain but they seem so empty , like i can see throught them , i 'm talking about how cheap are them and how stupid , do they even to see things from a different perspective ? 
  are they trying to be better or they want sex and anything you would want i you 'd think with or penis . 
  i hate how they so dumb , they dress nice , in expensive suits ( the ones who can afford ) to look in a certain way or to look smarter or whatever and i feel like i can see throught them , like they are nothing but what they wear , they have no substance , they have no mind of their own like they are robots . 
  i like trying to figure out what is in someone 's mind , are they sad ? 
  are they happy ? 
  why ? 
  is that girl single , does she have problems at home ?
