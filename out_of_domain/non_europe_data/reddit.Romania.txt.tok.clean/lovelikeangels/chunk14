  `` put my trust in god that day, 
  not the man that taught his way '', 
  so much so , that i got it tattooed under my boobs . 
  thank you !, 
  i thought it was fitting :d, 
  vacation in july . 
  [ me right now ] ( https://media1.giphy.com/media/8miyqyfpol1qu/200_s.gif ), 
  ya 'll mf 's aint miss shit in trailer analysis < 3, 
  i used to be a library assistant in college and it was awesome . 
  i would n't get too many patrons and most of the time i did n't really have anything to do besides check in periodicals daily , so i 'd browse the interwebs , or work on my homework . 
  we always had one or two students every year try/succeed in making and turning in bongs in sculpting class . 
  also , in my senior year independent art class , i painted an abstract expressionism painting depicting orgasm and explained it to my teacher . 
  i had to read that a few times to understand that redneck math . 
  white trash alert ? 
  i can attest to this via 2 of my former college classmates . 
  they actually told me themselves that a large part of why they were morbidly obese was because of their financial insecurity . 
  not really strange , more like insanely obnoxious : when my neighbor 's husband was still alive , he 'd illegally work on repairing people 's cars in their garage at 3 am in the fucking morning and it was so goddamn loud i * should 've * called the police for noise disturbance , but i always let it go . 
  in high school , our chemistry teacher would dilute the liquid soap at our stations to the point where it was more like water with hints of soap . 
  i had an argument with my best high school friend about what the basis of all things was - math ( my standpoint ) or science ( her standpoint ) . 
  she would * not * give in even after several friends jumped in the conversation and all backed me up . 
  she maintained that you can not break down the soft sciences into math ( which is untrue given that the soft sciences are based on the hard sciences , which are based on math ) . 
  anyway , she kept the argument up despite ample evidence . 
  i mean , i 'm romanian and i still think moldova should be part of romania and not its own country . 
  my vagina just cringed for you . 
  furbies . 
  i did n't . 
  he did by telling me he was n't into squirting . 
  amadeus, 
  this has never happened to me in a * public * restroom , only ** at home **, 
  when a hair betrays you and falls to the nether regions , but you have no idea until it 's like 11:23 pm at night and you layin ' on your ride , and suddenly , suddenly you get an awkward feeling in the crotchola - you reach down into the pantaloons and behold , the most awkward and worst sensation of getting that hair out from your crotch which no matter what pace you do it at , slow or fast , feels like satan tickling your crotch . 
  * that 's * something that should n't be a thing . 
  ** i 'll pray for you **, 
  i just did that so i could agree with you . 
  yes , that 's how we do hanging backstock as well . 
  it 's the worst :(, 
  purses ... and boots . 
  i used to buy polyurethane/man-made material purses and boots , but their life spans are far shorter than real leather . 
  my $ 200 leather boots were one of the best investments of my life , real talk . 
  they 've lasted me 5 years and still look like new , whereas autumn right before i purchased them , i had already worn through faux-leather boots and had to throw them away . 
  pilot sent me a batch of all kinds of their pens one time cause i tweeted at them or something , and let me tell you guys , i love me some g2 's , but their acroball pens are also top notch . 
  thank you . 
  no , i do n't think we do . 
  at least not in softlines . 
  i should probably change that myself since no one else does it . 
  everytime i send stuff to the back , it 'll get backstocked , but then it comes out again in cafs the next day . 
  smh . 
  picking a wedgie . 
  especially in a thong , sometimes i just got ta stick my hand down my pants . 
  the quadratic formula . 
  honestly though , i did n't try * that * hard . 
  i hate math . 
  at work people always ask me `` having fun yet ? '', 
  and i nearly always reply with `` is n't hard , when you 've got a library card ! '', 
  no one gets it . 
  nail clippers and/or file because i always need that shit . 
  and enzymes , because you never know when indigestion/heartburn might strike . 
  we have a pb&j restaurant ? 
  is this in the national or international terminal ??? 
  i need to know for my flight in july . 
  i really enjoyed flying out from amsterdam - their spider-leg layout was super easy to navigate . 
  did not enjoy frankfurt , too big , too confusing . 
  although , helpful staff . 
  as a detroit native who flys out of detroit whenever i fly , i definitely have to agree with everyone else and say detroit is a fantastic airport - big , but easy to navigate . 
  rather jealous i 've never walked the psychedelic tunnel or eaten at the gourmet peanut butter and jelly restaurant though . 
  yes , but also , when i clean my windshield on a not-rainy day and my wipers are going - i 'm paranoid that people notice and think i 'm crazy . 
  every year in the summer , i would have dreams about either being late for class , or forgetting my locker combination , and/or both . 
  i had a dream like this not too long ago actually . 
  i 've been out of college for 3 years and high school 7 ... 
  another reason why i love my menstrual cup . 
  i crop dust at work all the time and if they 're particularly stinky , i 'm always hoping and praying people do n't come up to me and ask me questions . 
  so what i 'm gathering is that it 's basically just my ass-backwards store . 
  last night as i was folding rtw tables , i remembered everyone 's responses in this thread and cried on the inside . 
  i need to take pictures for ya 'll to see the bullshit i got ta deal with . 
  probably sansa 's absolutely horrible twist of fate in marrying ramsay and then being subjected to an uncalled for rape . 
  i loved/hated it because it was so outrageous and so far from her book story line . 
  ca n't wait to see where she 's headed . 
  they do n't look magical enough . 
  150 points for gryffindor !, 
  i just ... wuuuh ? 
  people are petty . 
  i have begun rereading the harry potter series for the 6th time . 
  yes . 
  i associate colors with broad ideas , emotions , physical well-being or lack thereof , genres , and so on . 
  thanks !, 
  thanks !, 
  thank you , this is also helpful . 
  - once made my own penis out of clay and stuck it inside of a glove for protective purposes before use . 
  - have masturbated with variously sized markers/highlighters . 
  - one of those [ 3 pronged massage things ] ( http://www.massager-machines-and-more.com/img/productimages/l/wooden-jolly-hand-held-massager-628-1.jpg ) . 
  - eta : also mardi gras beads . 
  but why an expensive prismacolor ? 
  that 's fair . 
  parks and rec, 
  i can not stand when people do n't take sexual harassment seriously , and then when you take it into your hands and talk to hr , which is supposed to be a neutral entity , somehow it backlashes on you , the victim . 
  i 'm sorry this happened to you . 
  either way , it ties in with the all-around hp universe . 
  are you telling me that your boss tattooed the famous dragon dick i 've seen on the internet for the past 15 years ? 
  tried falling asleep after christmas party at my friend 's house , overheard two separate couples getting jiggy with it throughout the night - one of the guys ran downstairs mid-way to get water . 
  very awkward . 
  i still have a ways to go in terms of disciplining myself , buttttt,
