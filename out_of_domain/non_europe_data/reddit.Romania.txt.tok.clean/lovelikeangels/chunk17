  daaaang, 
  where is you getting cheapass bags of pistachios homie !? 
  they 're like at least $ 20 ` round these parts . 
  do it . 
  it 's worth in in so many ways . 
  your body , your wallet , and the environment will all be happier . 
  the wizard of oz . 
  as it turns out , my head boss has not seen it . 
  the man is in his late 50s , there is no fucking excuse . 
  `` well the sign said it was `` $ x '' '', 
  okay but did you read the fine print on the sign ??? 
  is this a digital coupon offer price ? 
  did you get the right size/scent/brand / type ? 
  amen , goddamn . 
  this reminds me of xmas season this past december . 
  i had a guest in my line with a dented box of the dominoes game - the lady behind her proceeded to shove her nose into this lady 's business and point it out to her and tell her to ask for a discount . 
  i told her that i ca n't give a discount because there 's nothing wrong with the game , all the pieces are there , and it 's really just an aesthetics flaw . 
  * of course * she threw a fit and my manager had to come over and key in a 25 % discount . 
  i gave a death glare to the bitch who pointed this shit out when she was next up on my lane . 
  do n't fucking stick your nose where it does n't belong . 
  funny this link shows up here after i read in r/askreddit about using safety razor as opposed to conventional disposables . 
  i was considering it then , but after this video , i think i might just get me one . 
  no , i can blame the corporation i work for for that . 
  and it 's not even `` fine '' print really , it 's pretty big , but people do n't look further than the % portion . 
  alright , i got it to work . 
  thank you . 
  did you order a safety razor ? 
  or go looking for one ? 
  i ended up ordering [ this razor ] ( http://smile.amazon.com/vikings-double-swedish-platinum-manliness/dp/b011l8wjia?ie=utf8&amp;psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00 ) and it 's arriving tomorrow on shave day i am so excited . 
  i also noticed while putting stuff away in the men 's shaving aisle at work today that we sell one brand of safety razors at target for half the price of the one i ordered , but anyway . 
  responsibility . 
  if i remember , i 'll let you know how i like this vikings razor tomorrow . 
  the reviews for it were so stellar , i was like fuck it , let 's do this . 
  also , i got a follow up email from the sellers after amazon 's emails and they seem pretty dedicated to making sure you 're a satisfied customer . 
  please stop with the embarrassment for the love of sweet baby jesus . 
  nobody is going to question you in the makeup aisles . 
  and if they do , tell them you 're girlfriend sent you . 
  it 's that simple , honestly . 
  i always feel weak when i cry in front of my boss . 
  that man has a power to make my cry no one else , i hate it . 
  english , but sometimes my mind throws in some romanian sentences or words . 
  also , i pray in romanian . 
  believe it or not , i did think about that before i sent that comment , but listen , if anyone is paying that much attention to you testing colors , they can fuck off . 
  it is 2016 , do you . 
  there is no need to feel shame for wanting to look good . 
  i was planning on purchasing a variety pack later from amazon . 
  the razor comes with 5 blades so i figure that 'll last me a little bit until i decide what sampler i want . 
  update : it arrived in the snail mail today . 
  used it in the shower and it works really well !, 
  i nicked myself a few times but the learning curve is n't as bad as i feel people seem to make it out to be . 
  i posted an after pic of my legs on [ instagram ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/beukdqplcz8/?taken-by=lovelikeangels ) cause i was pretty excited . 
  i 'm unavailable on sundays so i did n't work this launch , but i was able to visit a different store today and check out the merch . 
  none of the clothes had sold and maybe like a small handful of the patio/kitchenware stuff was gone . 
  i was n't personally expecting this to be a big launch because i do n't think a lot of people in the us know about marimekko . 
  i only do because i went to school for fashion design and i 'm continuously interested in designers and brands . 
  i 'm a fan of marimekko , but i 'm not really digging some of the stuff in this line . 
  a couple of the bathing suits were nice though . 
  threshold fitted sheets . 
  really nice thick cotton , excellent coverage on my hella deep mattress . 
  i also really enjoy threshold specialty towels . 
  oh , and shabby chic linens . 
  i 'm waiting for that all white duvet set to go to 70 %, 
  tendies . 
  that sounds adorable and i want some . 
  nope and tbh i forgot this was a thing until i came here . 
  do you mean they 're promoting you to brand ? 
  idk about other stores , because i 'm under the impression that other stores are way more normal than mine is , but the brand members at my store basically just deep zone and close , like , all the time ( example : me ) . 
  i get to handle the mannequins when the vml is out of town or if someone needs an item off of the mannequins etc. 
  i also handle them when i personally feel like they need to be changed because they often look shitty ( because our vml has no fashion sense ... seriously guys - just because someone has a degree in art does n't mean they have the necessary skills for an artsy role ) . 
  hopefully your store will give you the opportunities to expand your visual skills . 
  i 'm not saying mine does n't , but i 'm basically in a silent war with my vml . 
  and coastal . 
  love coastal . 
  loved them more when they did their `` first pair free '' thing though . 
  well , i 'm a day 1 newbie . 
  thanks for the heads up lol . 
  really ? 
  i bought it because the nearly 800 reviews of it were pretty stellar . 
  i mean , i saw a straight razor at work the other day ( target ) for $ 17 and ran into one today at a local store for like $ 28 . 
  i mean , idk . 
  it works well . 
  i paid $ 32 for it ( prime ) i probably wo n't return it though , too much work . 
  mmm , i base a lot of my purchases around amazon reviews and i ca n't say i 've ever been let down . 
  okay , i understand your frustration . 
  i 've already used it though - is that not gross to return it then ? 
  does amazon even take back used personal hygiene stuff ? 
  i guess i can look into it . 
  do n't buy it yet . 
  r/wicked _ edge is [ roasting me ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/4f935u/ordered_my_first_straight_razor_have_fallen_in/ ) , probably worth a read . 
  i was reminded of these today in target 's dollar spot , where they 're currently selling rocks that you can decorate . 
  thank you !, 
  this was a really kind comment . 
  i got 2 but when i tried for a 3rd , they caught me . 
  probably why they stopped that offer . 
   but the slytherin portrayal in the books always confused me . 
  i 'm gon na pull a semantic argument on you here and ask why are you confused ?? 
  your entire explanation shows anything but confusion about the house imo . 
  your observations seem accurate etc etc. 
  are you confused about the house portrayal in general , as in adding all the other extra hp info that is n't in the books ? 
  because i think your explanation of how it 's portrayed in the books is accurate and there 's nothing confusing about it from my pov .
