  ** lmfao ** at voldemort , fanart version . 
  he looks so buff with an air of `` ima steal yo gurl '' i * ca n't * . 
  * nuggety in physique * ahahahahaa, 
  i 'm re-reading hp3 right now , and i agree . 
  her predictions do come to pass , but the way she goes about announcing them is what puts people off . 
  that was my thought while watching that bit of this scene . 
  everyone looked so surprised when he said he hunts rabbits , but i was like , * obviously * he hunts rabbits , they probably do n't really have nice big fat game up there . 
  at least not a lot of it . 
  rabbits multiply quickly , however , so they 're always in supply . 
  and of course randyll tarly looked disgusted that his son was hunting a poor man 's meal/small game . 
  he probably feels it 's just fitting that his `` weak '' son is hunting `` weak '' game . 
  omg that kitty . 
  that tail !, 
  also , your wand is badass and i 'm jealous . 
  i have n't seen anyone do this take on the dh before , i really like it . 
  this is the only casting i 've gotten excited about . 
  i was going to make a separate post for the first picture of margaery because i think it 's subtley fantastic . 
  you can really see the changes in her - the piety of her demeanor , but especially her dress . 
  it 's not only more conservative in cut , but a lot less rich in material and thread . 
  i also really like the baratheon x tyrell woven crown she 's wearing . 
  it 's a neat representation of the union of the houses . 
  additionally , her hair , like ep6 , is subdued and less styled/curly . 
  shoutout to creepy septa unella in the background too . 
  james ? 
  i 've always had great success with pravana , but you might have to get that done with a professional . 
  for 2nd day hair , i 'll generally just spritz with water/wet my hands and scrunch up , then air dry . 
  anything after that , i braid . 
  i literally cackled . 
  do n't put your wand there , boy !, 
  what if it ignited ? 
  better wizards than you have lost buttocks , you know . 
  great observation . 
  but if they were birds , and varys did say he has * many * , what happened to the rest of them ? 
  wait , what question ? 
  how can sexy jesus wear her face if a girl is not dead ? 
  so i 've been reminded after coming back to check on this thread . 
  makes sense . 
  what i 'm gathering from the house preference portion :, 
  a lot of people think they 'd be ravenclaws . 
  why . 
  why did i click that . 
  i literally feel like i might throw up . 
  not really . 
  i see the total numbers have gone up since last night , but it seems that the majority of people still * want * to be ravenclaws , closely followed by gryffindor , and then the majority of people still * think * they 'd be ravenclaws . 
  holy shit , that 's a * wild ride * !, 
  this is my relationship with my boss right now . 
  thanks childhood . 
  i also do n't invite myself over , like ever , even after my friends have told me multiple times to just come over or just invite myself over . 
  like , what !, 
  harry potter was never a trend to begin with . 
  and especially not now that it 's about to hit it 's two decade mark . 
  my biggest pet peeve with lancel 's appearance for the past like season and a half is that his stupid seven pointed star is still crusty red . 
  we 're led to believe quite a bit of time has past within this season and a half since he acquired it , which means by real life standards , the crustiness should 've flaked off and he should be sporting a shiny scar , not this bullshit . 
  what the fudge popsicles makeup department !, 
  does he actually or are you just saying that ? 
  ugh , * that 's not funny *, 
  at my last job , i had to use a tube computer running windows 2000 ; a fax machine from the 90s ; a looooot of other outdated shit . 
  jets bbq pizza, 
  harry potter books, 
  game of thrones blurays, 
  silicone mermaid tail, 
  nikon dslr camera, 
  i see several people answered daphne greengrass for who harry should 've ended up with and i legit had to look her up cause she 's so minor i was n't sure if she was canon . 
  is this pairing a fanfic thing ? 
  i wear harry potter themed jewelry on the regular . 
  my keys lanyard is slytherin and my work keys is gryffindor . 
  i wear various hp shirts and also socks . 
  i have hp pins on my pinned jean jacket . 
  i 'm re-reading it right now and you 're not alone . 
  percy really is a pompous git . 
  noooo, 
  i love the elongated hexagon motif and how it varies in each costume . 
  the last two seem to be wearing it as armor . 
  yes . 
  my favorite thing about those articles is that someone got ** paid ** to write that . 
  before i clicked on this thread , i thought the ravenclaw design looked like the greyjoy kraken ( game of thrones for anyone who does n't know ) in the preview icon . 
  i thought you were pointing out the actor looks like gendry ( game of thrones ) but then i realized no . 
  it 's the book . 
  i 'm vicariously excited for you that you 're experiencing hp for the first time - and happy that you 're documenting your thoughts about it . 
  it 's refreshing seeing first povs on the novels , nearly a decade since the last one came out . 
  i enjoyed reading your review and your reactions . 
  i also felt it was 180 contradictory to everything they 've been working toward for 2 seasons , but alas , a whole new world awaits us & arya . 
  also , even though they 've parted ways , i 'm hoping to still get some sexy jesus on my screen . 
  i have no complaints about any of the arya scenes this episode . 
  however , what * is * her purpose now ? 
  she 's going back to westoros as arya stark of winterfell , yes . 
  but what she gon ' do ? 
  i 'm hoping she finds her way to sansa & jon and/or rickon . 
  i suppose her purpose would be finding her family + continuing her list ? 
  yess . 
  i was so hype this episode . 
  cat was mentioned quite a few times , freaking bwb , * that shot * . 
  i 'm still holding out hope . 
  maybe she 'll be the ultimate cliffhanger/final scene this season . 
  i do n't know why , but i almost have a feeling that just perhaps , jon might suddenly pull out a flaming sword . 
  lightbringer . 
  my best friend told me her family would eat bread and mayo ` sandwiches ' . 
  but that was it . 
  bread , and mayo . 
  my heartstrings still hurt thinking about that revelation .
