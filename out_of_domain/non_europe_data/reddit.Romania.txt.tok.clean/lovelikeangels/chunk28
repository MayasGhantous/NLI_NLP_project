  this was really good too . 
   in ootp , i think dumbledore has already started to think that voldemort 's and harry 's souls are intertwined . 
  harry has just told dumbledore that he saw through voldy 's eyes , and i think that 's confirming what dumbledore is thinking . 
  the serpents are intertwining themselves , showing how closely the souls of harry and voldy are intertwined . 
  to piggyback off this , i think he 's confirming that voldemort and nagini are linked which is where i think the 2 snakes and the ` essence divided ' come in .

  cheers . 
  thanks, 
  nice . 
  it turned out well . 
  i do this too . 
  i do n't think i do it intentionally though . 
  i feel like the writing is paced that way and i naturally follow it . 
  100 % feel you . 
  would n't you be dead by the time you got into the black hole though ? 
  like would you even be able to see the threshold ?

  it drives me crazy when i see people praising him for his love for lily and all that . 
  that 's cool and all but he was literally a douchenozzle to everyone but the slytherins and dumbledore .

  in 7th grade , our ( attractive ) spanish teacher 's cell phone went off with the ringtone `` bootycall !, 
  repeatedly in the middle of class . 
  we never let her live it down . 
  exactly what i always wondered in college when we `` were n't allowed '' to be friends with our teachers . 
  what they gon ' do . 
  better because i 've had social interaction with my friends who i do n't get to see often . 
  working on being a more open and approachable person . 
  have you tried meetup.com for non-romantic relationships ? 
  no problem . 
  it 's a great website for meeting new people while doing things you enjoy !,

  my family and i are first generation immigrants . 
  while we came here when my brother and i were young enough to learn english so that we would n't have an accent , my parents certainly do . 
  my parents have both encountered racism because of their accents and it infuriates me . 
  my mom speaks very fluently , although my dad has some trip ups . 
  i remember this one cashier at a grocery store refusing to honor an incorrect price ( even though it 's law in our state that you must ) because my mom sounds like an immigrant . 
  my friend worked there in high school and i remember she had to use some cleaning agent to clean stuff with , but they refused to allow her to wear gloves , so she broke out all over her arms and had to go to the hospital . 
  smfh . 
  it 's infuriating to me that we are afraid of police officers when they 're job should be to ` serve and protect ' , not ` terrify and intimidate ' . 
  cocoa cereal ( like rice krispies or chocolate cheerios , etc ) with buttermilk . 
  i discovered this combination by accident while visiting romania . 
  thought i was pouring regular milk into my cheerios . 
  it was buttermilk but i was very pleasantly surprised to find i loved the combo .

  damn , idk if the teeth i had root canals hurt worse or if the intense stomach cramps from gastritis topped them ...

  i have found meditation helps me to get grounded and calm and come back to myself from all the stresses of every day life , which in turn helps me be ` in the moment ' .

  the only job i can say i loved was when i was a painting instructor . 
  unfortunately , the ` company ' i worked for was stand-alone and shady af . 
  no sign in ( got paid how the owner remembered we worked ) , late checks , told to go home between classes to avoid paying me . 
  but the experience itself was super fun . 
  when i first started my current job , i had a guy return a soggy box of veggie burgers that was half eaten because he `` did n't like them '' . 
  why 'd you eat half of them then . 
  your boobs are so amazing , i want to tittyfuck them . 
  - friend , every time he 's drunk . 
  tbh , i 'm upset they 're only going to be e-book versions , not hard copies . 
  i like reading e-books , but i need hard copies of anything hp . 
  i ended up getting a plain gold one from amazon for $ 20 . 
  i 'll use it as as a shapewear piece for under my costume .

  in 7th grade , we had a teacher who was like , * obsessed * with catching students chewing gum . 
  one time , she held the whole class back after the bell rang for idfk what reason but it was stupid nonetheless , and while she was on a tirade , suddenly she turned to me and told me to open up my mouth because she knew i was chewing gum and that i needed to spit it out now . 
  i did n't even have gum on my person at the time . 
  i only moved my mouth momentarily and she took it as ** gum chewer ** .

  i 'm sad to report that although they 're my all time favorite band , i still have yet to see them in concert . 
  costco is the only major company where employees who are at the bottom of the totem pole can actually afford to live off their wages . 
  i have n't had a reason to use a ti calculator in many many years , but my junior years pre-calc teacher was also a ti employee and he would frequently bring in new calculators for us to test out in class and they were legit .
