  that 's whats up . 
  he rode a unicycle to and from school every day . 
  there will come soft rains and the smell of the ground ,, 
  and swallows circling with their shimmering sound ;, 
  and frogs in the pools singing at night ,, 
  and wild plum trees in tremulous white ,, 
  robins will wear their feathery fire, 
  whistling their whims on a low fence-wire ;, 
  and not one will know of the war , not one, 
  will care at last when it is done . 
  not one would mind , neither bird nor tree, 
  if mankind perished utterly ;, 
  and spring herself , when she woke at dawn ,, 
  would scarcely know that we were gone .

  well you 're not him cause he killed himself a few years ago . 
  i want to fucking punch anyone in the face who has that mentality . 
  occasionally leaving shit where it does n't belong is annoying , absolutely . 
  but when i hear those words straight out of people 's mouths after they 've demolished an aisle of shoes and now there 's 48 pairs of shoes to pick up and put back in their boxes ...  =[,

  just started season 6 of a complete watch-through . 
  can confirm . 
  i work at target and have previously worked at various other retail stores of which i have plenty of stories , but this one is a target story that i did n't witness , but my lod at the time rushed over to tell me after it occurred . 
  it was a quite night after the christmas season , i 'm minding my own business in infants , when my lod runs over in hysterics and i 'm like ?????????? 
  she proceeds to tell me she just witnessed a guest shit his pants in the candy aisle , and then jiggle his leg to let the turd fall down his pant leg onto the floor , and then nonchalantly walk away . 
  we both laughed in horror . 
  i honestly do n't understand how anyone can shop at kohl 's . 
  a solid 98 % of the time , i ca n't find anything i actually like enough to spend money on , and i 'm an avid shopper . 
  i always get lost in my local kohl 's . 
  i find the materials they use are hella cheap for how much they want . 
  fuck you , kohl 's . 
  that gays = rapists . 
  i 'm getting heated right now thinking about it . 
  i 'm crying lmao, 
  i think there 's a subreddit for this . 
  i stabbed myself accidentally in my forearm in art class with the tip of a pencil that i had wedged between my fingers , sticking up . 
  i leaned over it too far , and woop there it went . 
  still have a graphite mark .

  mine found mine when they decided to clean my room while i was out of the country for 3 weeks 8 years ago . 
  they never mentioned it , but i noticed because it was n't placed how i 'd left it . 
  i have grapheme-color , lexical-gustatory , ordinal-linguistic personification , and orgasm-color synesthesia . 
  and some other minor types . 
  one time i found myself down a youtube rabbit hole in which i discovered there is like a market/subculture surrounding magnets in varying shapes and sizes that you can use to like , create shit with . 
  i was honestly tempted to get my own set of a couple of different styles . 
  i did n't sniff it . 
  but i do n't have the kind of parents who would use my sex toys . 
  it looks like green sunstone . 
  gold . 
  that 's probably a hot no . 
  i feel like this is already a thing : fanfiction . 
  and my answer is no because i personally do n't like fanfiction and even if she gave permission for certain people to `` play in her sandbox '' and make it so that it would be considered canon/somewhat canon , i still would n't consider it canon because it 's not her work . 
  that 's kind of how i feel about cursed child . 
  her name might be on that book , but it 's not really her work , is it ? 
  i do this all the time because often times i decide that in fact , i 'd rather keep my opinion to myself than be contradicted to my personal truths and whatnot . 
  and yes , i almost did just delete this post . 
  when i was around 9 or 10 , i was over at my aunt 's house playing outside in her front yard . 
  this was the metro detroit area , ~ 1999 . 
  for some reason , i looked up at the sky and there was a classic looking ufo , straight chillin about ~ 300ft in the air above her house , not making a noise , not moving . 
  i recall it had red and white lights around the rim of the ship and i just stood there transfixed thinking in my mind that i definitely should run inside and grab her polaroid camera , but i also knew that if i did , the chances of the ship still being there were a 50/50 i was n't willing to take . 
  as i 'm standing there staring at it , suddenly , it started to spin on a horizontal axis . 
  still no sound . 
  still not bobbing movements or anything like that . 
  i remember it gained speed spinning really quickly . 
  the best way i can describe it without being able to show it using a plate is if you had an object and attached 2 strings on either side and then tugged on them to make it spin - like a spin top type of thing ? 
  anyway . 
  it eventually slowed down , but then , once it became stationary again , it did the exact same thing , except this time it flipped on its side and spun on a vertical axis , like someone had moved the strings was pulling on them from top and bottom rather than side and side . 
  after it did this a couple times , it stopped , the lights blinked , and then it slowly started moving north , and i remember chasing it out into the street , and it flew to a point , stopped , and then suddenly , it went from like 0-1000mph and vanished in a blink . 
  i never got a picture of it , but there are a few pictures of me after the incident where i 'm sitting in a lawn chair , holding a pen and notebook . 
  i was recording everything i saw in the sky for months afterward . 
  eta : i forgot to mention , in high school , i discussed this story with one of my friends who at the time lived one street over from me . 
  she told me she had basically the same experience , in that she saw a ufo behave in the same manner , outside her house a couple years previously . 
  i can tie my hair into knots using 2 fingers . 
  `` do you do your hair yourself ? '',

  being able to pick out actors of varying fame in a show or movie and tell you what else they 've starred in . 
  i need fire and 100 emojis , stat . 
  was it a themed wedding or did this person just decide to show up with a wand on their calf ? 
  pretty sure the alternative was hufflepuff . 
  insert clapping and 100 emojis, 
  seriously where are the 100 emojis . 
  i 'm in love . 
  i need to be there . 
  same . 
  i need a break between orgasms . 
  and none of the ones after the first one feel as amazing . 
  that first one is like the epitome of what i want to feel .
