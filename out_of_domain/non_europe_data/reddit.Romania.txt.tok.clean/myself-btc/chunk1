2h and no word ... interesting ... it wont get live until there is a long serious debate for this topic so do n't reserve yourself, 
  u are wrong , you should update your information before posting, 
  +1 up vote for the effort, 
  that amounts are exactly what users are trading , accusation and no proofs = trolling, 
   current needs :, 
   we currently need :, 
   - over 10 000 usd to lend on bitfinex, 
  atm needs this sum to have to archive balance, 
  i can help you here u have it http://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/comments/15ixor/i_am_adviser_for_bitfinexcom_so_ask_questions_if/, 
   is there a specific point that you think i 'm wrong about ? 
  everything related how the platform works, 
  i u have any questions u can use this thread some sort of ama http://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/comments/15ixor/i_am_adviser_for_bitfinexcom_so_ask_questions_if/, 
  1 ) if you do n't mind i will make some copy paste, 
   you get them back  the liquidation is based on traders funds, 
   example you are long term holder and decide to lend bitcoins, 
   trader 1 take your 100 bitcoins and start shorting at the price of 10 usd per bitcoin, 
   if the trader 1 have 500 usd he can afford a 500 usd loss ( he is liquidated a bit earlier but to keep this simple ) he can afford 5 usd loss per bitcoin, 
   so the trader 1 will be liquidated at 15 usd per bitcoin, 
   when trader 1 go short the 100 bitcoin at 10usd the platform gets 1000 usd from that sell plus it own 500 usd that make 1500 sufficient funds to buy back your 100 bitcoins at 15 usd per btc, 
  you mean using leverage or using the simple exchange ? 
  you are exaggerating for example in the '90 there was no ajax , the other point is rows and columns are the best way to show data ( remember the accounting spreadsheets evolved into excel ) the site can look better that for sure but so far it serve the purpose to display data , after the platform get most of features implemented does make sense to improve the looks, 
  the credit book is the available funds aka not used funds , try harder on your trolling, 
  nice try troll with that old copy paste , try harder and never stop we need you, 
  i assume you talk about this https://bitfinex.com/pages/interest, 
  * depositors post offers using this page https://bitfinex.com/credit, 
  * depositors put the conditions for the credits ; interest , amount , time and auto renew, 
  * when margin-traders take this credits the pages get updated and show the average interest based on the total credits used by margin-traders, 
  * bitfinex.com do n't set the interest is all market based, 
  * bitfinex.com does have a fee for this , see loans https://bitfinex.com/pages/fees, 
  this formatting is a pain, 
   the size of trades are larger than the amount on the credit book . 
  this is how i know they are still a bucket shop , like bitcoinica . 
  try harder ? 
  http://userstyles.org/styles/79785/bitfinex-blue-compact-small here is a little demo , you can change how the site looks using stylish addon for firefox and chrome, 
  yep . 
  something like this is quite nice http://i.imgur.com/mnvha.jpg step by step the ui can get better, 
  1 ) available amount that other users offer , bitfinex do n't lend you money, 
  2 ) your limit is set by the tradable balance , you can take loans until this balance goes down to 0 , the size is set by your trading wallet value and available credit, 
  example, 
  + you get on your trading wallet 1000 usd, 
  + with 5 leverage ( max ) you can buy bitcoins for almost 5000usd ( about 370 btc at current price ), 
  + if there is available on credit book only 100 then you can buy only 100, 
  lol u got a downvote , have a upvote , upvotingobama.jpg, 
  what you are asking is how bot ( hft ) make money , ofc mtgox cant support 1000 trade per second so is slower compared to nasdaq , just go at http://www.nanex.net and read stuff, 
  for impact on market go here http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/pages/workingpapers/2012/wp469.aspx, 
  yep, 
  side note , mtgox does run its own liquidity bot , so if any of you make a bot and your bot cant put and remove orders at same speed like this bot ( order book delayed , pending ordets etc ) this can be a mtgox bot, 
  * unrealized = because the position is still open you do not take the p/l untill the position is closed so any p/l is no realized yet, 
  * swap the cost of borrowing funds, 
  * required margin = the money needed to cover your losing position, 
  u can earn interest by lending btc using bitfinex, 
  * https://bitfinex.com/pages/interest atm the average apy for btc is 25 %, 
  * how to lend https://bitfinex.com/pages/iwantto#lend, 
  * other question already answered here http://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/comments/15ixor/i_am_adviser_for_bitfinexcom_so_ask_questions_if/, 
   but there are reasons to doubt their trustworthiness, 
  can you make a list of reasons ? 
   known scammers, 
  can you point any of the scams ? 
  bitcoinica was a model for bitcoin trading , a model that failed on the other hand it served to have things started , i am mostly behind the idea how the site is running ( i am adviser for bitfinex ) and stuff , other ppl did support pirate and i dont consider that to be a point to start a witch hunt , so your only point you can make is security, 
   but you still have n't shown that bitfinex can succeed . 
  requiring the site itself to frequently have large open positions sounds like a recipe for the same kinds of problems bitcoinica had ( see the whole `` we had zero profits since march thing '' ) times a big huge multiplier . 
  i get the feeling that you dont understand how the platforms is running or i have a hard time to understand your point , can you use other words tia, 
   he promoted the biggest bitcoin ponzi fund of all time . 
  also other ppl did the same and was from good intentions, 
   he tried to start his own ponzi fund . 
  if you set the standard there you should know that there are funds that run and pay their customers , you did judge the thing before anything could ever happen, 
   there is no evidence that the bitcoinica ` hack ' was n't just the site owners stealing the coins and claiming they had been hacked . 
  i dont comment on that i will only say that i did lose money on btca, 
  dear god i need to explain this over again ... bitfinex has always 100 % reserve , traders that use leverage borrow money from other users and bitcoin movements are pending for manual approval, 
  and yet you did nothing to prove your scam accusations, 
  bitfinex dont work that way, 
  * users position dont cancel each other all order go live so if one sell 1000 and the next user buy 2000 the bid goes down 1000 and the ask goes down by 2000, 
  * like i said before leverage users borrow money , they work with borrowed money so even if you deposit 10000 btc and the total lending offer is 100 then you only can short 100, 
  * trader deposit are to back its position not to trade with that money, 
  * max leverage is 5 not 10, 
  * bitfinex.com have some pages that you need to read before posting crap , a short example https://bitfinex.com/pages/iwantto#short, 
   i want to short, 
   to short bitcoins , go to the margin trade page . 
  there , you will pass a sell order , with several options available :, 
   choose the amount of bitcoins you want to short, 
   choose the type of order you want to make : market orders are executed at any price available . 
  limit order are executed only if the price is above the desired price . 
  stop order are when you have an opened position . 
   choose your maximum expiration period : that will be the maximum numbers of days you can short bitcoins with this order . 
  in the `` credit available '' table , the `` sell '' columns show , for each period , how many bitcoins you can short , at which rate . 
  if you choose more than what is displayed , your order will stay pending until there is enough bitcoins available . 
   finally , click and the red `` sell '' button to place your order . 
  it will appears in the active orders table below . 
  when your order is executed , you will see the corresponding position in the `` active position '' table . 
   tip : use limit-sell to control the order execution price . 
   tip : to short bitcoins you need to borrows bitcoins from others lenders . 
  selling something that you do n't have is fraud . 
  if you have account is likely to get a email when the beta is over, 
  * you should check the point number 1 since does not use the same model where the platform make internal matching, 
  * is not a betting site is more like a ecn , bitfinex support most used orders types and order routing, 
  just look at cad market :d :d, 
  the first spike on 07/01/2013 23:54 gmt was to 13.72 on usd order book no ask order above 13.61 got filled with that order, 
  terms, 
  borrower,
