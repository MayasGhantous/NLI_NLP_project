  and, 
  the documentation will be implemented soon so far is 11 pages that will make things clear for you the long copy paste i made was just for p2p lending, 
  i will like to know the euro million combination for next week can you tell me?seams you are a skilled futurologist, 
  i did post on the forums another for wallets and lending, 
   interest rates,

  if ppl dont use your btc that means nobody want to sell bitcoins, 
  that coins are actually loaned out same apply for the usd , you should do your homework before posting crap, 
  because if you have usd you can only buy and if you have btc you can only sell , how are you going to buy bitcoins if you only have bitcoins ? 
  taking a usd loan , how are you going to sell bitcoins if you only have usd ? 
  taking a btc loan, 
   i hope this will answer your question, 
  * plz understand that my english is poor *, 
  i was thinking of a different scenario . 
  i was thinking that someone , person a , has $ 1000 . 
  that person will lend x amt to person b , for x % interest for a defined term . 
  person b will use those funds to generate profits through trading . 
  it 's as if person a was `` staking '' person b. 
  you are basically saying the `` lender '' is a money converter . 
  this still stands , your scenario is correct , traders take a loan and try to make money with said loan , if they make money they keep the profits pay the interest and return the loan if they dont make a profit they pay the interest from their wallet and take de loss, 
   but , even in your scenario , would n't it still be cheaper to convert funds outside the website than agree to the lending terms posted ? 
  with leverage you buy x5 your wallet value so if you have 1 btc you can buy almost 5 btc and if you have 14,50 usd you can sell almost 5 btc and if you have 10 btc and you want to buy bitcoin there is no point of selling the 10 bitcoin to get usd and buy again you just keep them, 
  it depend on the lender if the lender is a day trader and give loans he cant use said funds so the opportunity cost is bigger versus the lender that do n't trade to much for him the opportunity is lower since he wont use the funds anyway, 
  bitcoin user do n't believe much it ta and are extremely bullish by default since most of them are in bitcoin for the get rich quick thing and do really hope to sell bitcoins at over 1000 usd in the next years, 
  i personally like the rate of growth my personal time limit to generate decent income and have most of the basic features ( the devil is on details ) i set at xmas 2014 ppl concerns will be solved in a way or another but that it takes time and money, 
  some basic documentation is here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137022.0, 
  i hope he did not damage its ear, 
  we are working to set the community portal up and runing and get all the documentation together,
