   dear mt. 
  gox merchants ,, 
  gox is happy to announce that global account withdrawals have now fully resumed as of today , after several days of testing our new system for processing transactions . 
  we want to keep you informed about our progress in this arena , and especially assure our customers that their funds are accessible . 
   progress in the previous two weeks, 
   while we announced that there would be a temporary hiatus on withdrawals , during our testing over the past two weeks we managed to process over $ 1,000,000 usd to customers . 
  as this required a great deal of manpower and was not a perfect solution , we are quite happy with the progress made despite the conditions . 
   new banking partners, 
  gox has now formed relationships with several new banking partners both in japan and around the world , and we are still in the process of finalizing even more . 
  this means that we will have increased stability and ability to transmit withdrawals going forward . 
   current back-log, 
   the new system is just now getting under way , so there is still a back-log of withdrawals that we need to process . 
  our team is working hard to increase transaction speeds , but there is approximately a two-week back-log we need to overcome . 
  it will take a few weeks to get back to normal , and we thank you for your patience during this time . 
   moving forward, 
   we at mt. 
  gox are proud to be one of the first advocates and entrepreneurs in this growing ecosystem , but much still needs to be accomplished to bring trust and stability to a mass market . 
  in addition to our improved withdrawal system and new trading engine , we are very excited about the innovation happening across our industry and around the world . 
  despite the hiccups , these are exciting times and we are eternally grateful for your confidence and support along this bumpy road .
