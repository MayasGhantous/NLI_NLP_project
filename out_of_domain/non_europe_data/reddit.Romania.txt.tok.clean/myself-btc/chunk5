  here http://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoinmarkets/comments/2ay6o5/i_hope_in_the_future_people_will_stop_complaining/ mods said this belongs, 
  original post, 
   02:50 < myselfbtc  there is huge bid, 
   02:51 < myselfbtc  i dont know if the owner sell in front or is a hero, 
   see a manipulator is starting a rally with a huge bid for okcoin order book, 
   edit : boner bar archived https://i.imgur.com/dy7ofrc.png, 
   the bid is still there https://i.imgur.com/8texhxg.png, 
  so there are 45000-50000 btc in longs, 
  this is good idea but the way it was implemented wont reduce volatility but will increase it i expect some epic crashed because the * over-leverage *, 
  people should stay away from this type of contracts ( some called them toxic derivatives ) if they do n't understand them and this type of contracts are similar to [ icbit.se futures ] ( https://icbit.se/buu4 ) but instead of 10 $ it 100 $ so okcoin will have the exact same problems like icbit and the squeezes will be even more epic i start trading icbit futures since mid 2012 so i know that i am talking about, 
   futures volume, 
  i do n't really care about volume, 
  i do n't care about volume i care about open interest but you can explain me how volume is relevant and how i should really really care about the past closed contracts ... ... 
   also seems you 're trading not bitcoin , but bitcoin cfds . 
  i know is cfd and i dont have a problem on that, 
  u need a mt4 account , check your user profile, 
  cot is available only for futures fiat markets, 
  i did come up with the idea of hidden orders for bitfinex before bitfinex had a api to avoid having the user placing a orders ever now and then , hidden orders are not a dark pool, 
  i wonder if okcoin will offer a bounty for 1k btc to fix their implementation of the `` futures '' or simply they do n't care, 
  i use http://btccharts.com/ here a demo https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=672187.msg9005766#msg9005766, 
  only if people were using a decent price feed and charting tool,
