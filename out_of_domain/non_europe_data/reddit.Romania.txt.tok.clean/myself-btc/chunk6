  if you have all the positions closed you should be able to take the gains out there is no point to have the funds `` stuck '', 
  if you have all position closed there is no reason to have the funds hostage no fiat futures market do that, 
  the main reason for that is if the exchange lose money they will take a part of the money you gained , wish means the exchange cant do their purpose and eliminate counterpart risk,

  u need a reality check mostly because you have no idea what you are doing you made 50 % gain in a week and you dint see that like something odd or strange , what did u expect to be the new normal ? 
  also pigs fly and unicorns exist, 
  also you dint have any stop loss or even emergency break even stop loss at 820,

  i summit this so people have a idea how house construction is done in spain and why houses are so expensive, 
  at the beginning ( 2012 ) the purpose of hidden orders was to show a minimum of 500 and keep hidden the rest of the order then each time a part of the order gets filled refresh-fill up to 500 again, 
   am i correct your adaptations are primarily focused on allowing a insurance market . 
  correct, 
   i thought bitfinex ' ' automatic liquidation eliminated the negative effects of a default ? 
  that risk is impossible to eliminate, 
   i believe by setting standard amounts you will not be able to lend out your penny interests until they pile up to a round number ? 
  yes , so that will be bad for very small amounts lets say under 100 usd ( depends what is a standard amount ) and on the other hand will be less spam, 
  you dint focus at all in risk pricing , 15 % in a flat market is too much and on a volatile market is too little, 
  trading api and a external software for it, 
  if any devs read this take a look at this http://dtcprotocol.org/, 
   but it would allow me to write python ai to do it for me -  free isk ... 
  until trading bots will compete with each other and arbitrage opportunity will vanish, 
  https://www.tradingview.com/x/j1ukuulk/ margin called much ? 
  just take the funds out if they allow it, 
   the thing is that just as cutting interest rates stimulates the economy, 
  imo you are wrong on the wording , it give inceitives to take credits and nothing more, 
  ** you can take a horse to a river but you cant force him to drink watter **, 
  patience nobody know what `` crackdown '' really means, 
  is a trap :d, 
  yes , a huge difference, 
  i said this so many times * `` they will make whitelist of bicoins and miners will mine only those bitcoins '' *, 
  is time to add a zerochash protocol to obfuscate transactions, 
  # op also lost the control of the reddit account ping / u/bashco maybe you want to look for suspicious activity , also the hacker is clearing all the posts, 
  he is for real, 
  it was a damn keylogger, 
  # well this is free market if the community dont like how the domain is used they should form a foundation donate money and buy the domain, 
  u can tell raphael that since i designed the logic for lending system finishing feature 51 ( he got that email in 23.01.2013 ) and feature 67 will cost him about 5000 btc ( depending on the btcusd price ), 
  it did ? 
  it look to me that bfx is going to eat a loss on the lending market, 
   i designed the logic for lending system, 
  you little cunt should read again, 
  why did u move away from armory ? 
  imo it needs more volume to keep going, 
   i wished they did this in my school . 
  anyone can do that on their own no need for a teacher,

  thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137022.0, 
  from today lenders and borrowers will we a new option the lending page , variable interest rate ( vir ) using this option the cost and profit will go up and down based on the market demand and offer for credit, 
  faq : https://bitfinex.com/pages/faq#q15, 
  here is a snapshot of the credit market in bitcoin world http://i.imgur.com/a8pctda.jpg . 
  all the lending is done p2p by depositors so traders can use leverage . 
  to solve the problem whit the permanent white noise i plugged the usb on a secondary pc that i have 24/7 on and the white noise is gone , 
  so i started / r/bitfinex to put some info about how bitfinex works for reddit users .

  ... the government . 
  many that know me also know my view of bitcoin economy , bitcoin economy is pathetic at best but there is a good change that the government will give a helping hand and make bitcoin rocket not to the moon but to pluto . 
  \u00bf so what 's the tipping point ?
