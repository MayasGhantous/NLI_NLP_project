  someone has to do something about all this ethnomasochism !, 
  you sure have a way with words . 
  a wordsmith if you will . 
  you do realize your logic is the exact type of shit hardcore sjws use ? 
  how do you not see the ridiculous `` i 'm a revolutionary '' , `` i do n't care what the man says '' teenager crap thinking you 're using ? 
  you lot really have become the enemy you hate so much . 
  well , there is a drooling retard as president of the us trying to convince people he 's otherwise . 
  so yeah , i get your point buttercup . 
  case and point . 
  our friend over here , user gavypavl :, 
   all the apollo astronots are idiots , they scammed the american people . 
  fuck them all . 
  ... is a fucking retard . 
  remember fellow maga warriors !, 
  facts not feelings !, 
  keep being woke !, 
  i absolutely love this . 
  it is truly glorious . 
  i looked at the post history of the first top 15 upvoted posts on this thread . 
  all of them the_donald / conservative subreddit visitors . 
  ** all of them **, 
  * not to mention that the overwhelming majority of the accounts are not a day older than a year !, 
  did n't you know ? 
  pro-left people are the ones brigading !!, 
  they have , in this very thread , proved otherwise . 
  also , lest we forget the absolute dung that used to reach the front page artificially from their toilet of a subreddit : * `` hillary the hitman !, 
  '' , `` obama leader of isis '' . 
  they 're the ones to bitch and moan ?? 
  bucha fucking highschoolers . 
  yes , that must be it . 
  let us get back to what 's really important . 
  when is hillary going to fess up on hiring harvey oswald ? 
  so , when are you going to post * anything * about the multitude of pro-trump subreddits and subreddits infiltrated with far-right loonies ? 
  or how they ban * anyone * who even slightly disagrees with them ? 
  ** all in all , at least you can post here , i was banned from r/the _ donald and r/rightwinglgbt just for posting a mild counter-opinion . 
  you 're trying to come off as neutral whilst criticizing only one side of reddit . 
  keep trying though , i 'm sure people will fall for your bullshit that you 're not a trump supporter/conservative/right-wing . 
  obligatory :,

  maga brother !, 
  good point . 
  tell that to all the people whining about a * documentary * being posted on the subreddit dedicated to * documentaries * . 
  did i say that the anti-trump spam is n't the new ~ ~ hillary spamwave ~ ~ , ~ ~ bernie spamwave ~ ~ , ~ ~ the_donald spamwave ~ ~ ? 
  it 's clear that people got fed up with one and then upvote spammed the other out of spite . 
  i was sick of the frontpage spam with bernie promising the sun and the moon if he got elected and thus * upvoted anything that came from the_donald * . 
  then when they took their turn spamming i started to upvote anti-trump stuff . 
  simple . 
  also , i reiterate , at least you do n't get an * insta-perma-ban * for posting here , unlike trump-subreddits . 
  that 's really nice dear . 
  that 's nice deary . 
  shhh !, 
  do n't ruin his `` i 'm truly neutral donchano '' bit . 
  let him have his fun ... it seems to make him happy . 
  yeah , just look at trump . 
  you can be a gelded twonk and still be considered a male . 
  how does a 70 year old 's ballsack stuck in your throat feel like ? 
  do you fucking think soros pays me just for the odd little vice spin piece here and there ? 
  shilling for our marxist-reptilian overlord is hard work , boy . 
  we 've made great progress but there 's still so much more to do . 
  the bastions of traditional white society still , although isolated , hold strong . 
  through minorities and pc-police we will round up all of these remaining damn `` fascists '' . 
  * laughs in jewish *, 
  i see we 're using the definition of president loosely here, 
  ^ ca n't argue with facts !, 
  wasting your breath my man ... lost cause . 
  how where the no-go zones ? 
  like these [ ones ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflf6to7vsa ) ? 
  keep your kgb and assad apologist garbage for the sewers you frequent . 
  nobody 's buying your `` i am uncovering the new world order '' horseshit here . 
   self glorifying circle jerk, 
  coming from the shithead who browses : mgtow , weekendgunnit , europeannationalism , mensrights aaaaaand the_donald . 
   self reinforcing idiots, 
  coming from the loser who gets triggered every time he hears `` woman '' , `` feminism '' or `` sjw '' . 
  also a moron who does n't know what `` goyim '' means in the actual dictionary of the language it belongs to . 
  how is it that far-right-ers are half-schooled , lamebrained , sensitive little fairies all rolled into one big inbred pile ? 
  obligatory shit stirring addition : how 's that new wave of nationalism/far-right going ? 
  how 's le pen ? 
  how 's wilders ? 
  what happened to austria ? 
  dat guy right next to the lcvp ramp with the modern day molle backpack ...
