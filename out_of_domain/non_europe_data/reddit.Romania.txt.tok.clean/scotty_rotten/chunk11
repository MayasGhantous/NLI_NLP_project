  looks amazing nevertheless , good job !, 
  there 's a sort of similar looking mopp suit on the workshop . 
  search for `` 2000 era smocks '' . 
  they 're not real mopps but look very close to the real thing minus the desert combat boots . 
  also , fnatic was referring to the fact that your guys are wearing anachronistic post-2005 helmets . 
  the us military mod by delta hawk has the iraq invasion old style pasgts . 
  i really like what you 're doing , if you need mod suggestions ( i 've got over 400 of 'em , heh ) , hit me up on steam . 
  you married your sister yet ? 
  you realize that $ 60.000 does n't even come close to how much soros or ( ( ( they ) ) ) pay me at the end of a ** week ** , right ? 
  we 're closer and closer to getting our * man * . 
  the * russia thing * is working perfectly !, 
  the old man never stood a chance , he 'll be gone and replaced by one of our yes men soon enough . 
  after it 's done , this time around , we 'll make damn sure none of you `` nazis '' ever get a chance like the one in 2016 again . 
  * laughs in jewish *, 
  ~ ~ country 's * most popular politician * . 
  ~ ~ have you seen his latest approval rating ? 
  the man has been in a non-stop downward spiral since the beginning of the year . ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ not only that but in 2016 , only 57 % of eligible voters showed up and he failed to convince the majority to vote for him ( 3 million people difference ) . ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ how on earth is that `` popular '' ? 
  oh , you meant populist ... gotcha ! ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ let 's have it chief . 
  give us those * credible * polls . ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ and yes , when one candidate gets * 3 million * more votes in an election that is exacto-fucking-ly what it means . 
  the people of the us , represented by the majority of the 57 % that turned up , wanted clinton , not trump . ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ again , cheap backalley nationalism does not equal patriotism and caring for the people . ~ ~, 
  i 'll leave it as is in order to illustrate my shit reading comprehension . 
  however , i think this is a good example of why it is so hard to get your point across to the * other side * ( left , right ) , when each side is hellbent on how its version is the ultimate truth . 
  i did n't do it `` for no reason '' . 
  just misread his comment . 
  if he was an actual trump supporter it would apply 101 % . 
  also , how is it `` shooting someone in the face '' or aggressive in any manner if i just provided facts ? 
  i was not lecturing him . 
  just stating what i did in the previous post . 
  his wording was almost identical to fanatical trump supporters and how hard it is to argue on politics when it 's not really an ideological exchange but more of a tug of war . 
  brother tdo1 here is woke !, 
  he is aware of the cultural war being fought against our society !, 
  / s think i need to go rinse my brain ... 
  \u0287o\u028cso\u027e, 
  holly shit , how is he so damn stupid , lol, 
  can this dude even count to 10 ? 
  reported on by ruptly . 
  of course . 
  part of the rt garbage network . 
  sometimes i kind of agree with the right-wing loonies in the sense that we are too politically correct . 
  rt should be banned completely from the west until they clean up their act . 
  are you serious ? 
  if you are , do n't expect any contribution to the discussion from me . 
  i 'll say this , even though fox is total garbage , both it and cnn are private entities . 
  rt is known to be funded and controlled by the russian govt . 
  these are the assholes lying about the shootdown of mh17 and saying russia did not invade crimea . 
  on cnn/fox you will see criticism of the west/usa/israel . 
  you will see no criticism of russia on rt ; only ridiculous anti-west stuff mixed in with the occasional made up shit . 
  actually , we * do * have evidence that russians did interfere with the us 2016 election . 
  the whole us intelligence community in one voice stated this as a fact . 
  what we do not know for a fact is if mr. lardass trump is directly implicated or not . 
  to make it as clear as possible for you :, 
  if cnn/fox were to act like rt they would say that iraq was invaded by an unknown army in 2004 and that russia is eating western babies ( an exaggeration but it 's what rt does - the west is overly bad and the source of evil in the world ) . 
  i do n't care how much you 're trying to sell the `` i am neutral '' tactic , or the `` both sides are the same '' gimmick . 
  rt and its network of channels ' level of deceit and propaganda is unmatched . 
  this is n't the `` oh let 's spin this truth to fit our narrative '' that cnn/fox does . 
  they . 
  make . 
  shit . 
  lie and fake . 
  do n't give a damn if west media occasionally does it . 
  for rt it is modus operandi . 
  just a few weeks ago these pathetic losers were telling us how russia * did not invade/attack * poland and buddied up with the nazis in 1939 and how finland * actually started the winter war * . 
  no , both sides are * not * the same , not even close . 
  thankfully more and more people in europe/us are starting to see this . 
  also , love how you keep on moving the goalposts , from `` totally no evidence of russian interference '' to `` yeah evidence but i do n't believe it '' . 
   ... not to the extent it is portrayed ( i.e. 
  actually meaningfully influencing the result ), 
  releasing information in order to smear a specific candidate just as the polls open up means exactly that ... * meaningfully influencing the result * . 
  all done by the absolute corrupt joke that wikileaks has become . 
  and if that were n't enough , we 've got a more recent example of their dirty tactics . 
  during the french election there is a window in which media can discuss candidates and the like . 
  once that window closes you are forbidden to talk about candidates/politics until the window opens up again , after the voting has concluded . 
  these lowlifes , yet again , released information on macron just as the window closed , leaving the concerned party no way to counteract their bullshit . 
   i also said they are less subtle and more extreme in their bullshitting than western media . 
  they are not just more extreme , they have a whole network of channels on all sorts of media meant to infiltrate the west with their lies and bullshit . 
  i do n't think cnn goes on air in russia to smear putin or paint ordinary russians as criminals/fascists - no matter how much you want to take cnn/fox ' obvious western bias out of context . 
   but what would you call pandering to the narrative that russia is a military threat with their ruined economy and less than a 1/10th the military spending of the us ? 
  i would call that justified . 
  russia used unmarked troops to annex via force a legitimate part of another country and is in the process of fucking up other parts . 
  last i remember , the usa put its money where its mouth was and rebuilt germany/france after wwii . 
  the soviets bled countries dry and shoved the cancer of communism down their throats until violent revolts kicked them out . 
  the fact that the current russian leadership sees the `` old soviet russia '' , with the incorporated eastern bloc , as something that needs to be resurrected , does n't help either . 
   or fox 's obama birth certification agenda ? 
  is n't that making things up/promoting ridiculous narratives ? 
  that 's why i said that fox is trash . 
  double yup . 
  if i try and forcefully pull my dog towards the railing part he will lock up right there and refuse to move . 
  actually , it 's downright hilarious how many people in this thread do n't realize it . 
  all of them russian nationals ?!, 
  are you serious ? 
  all of those people working in the * us embassy * were , in fact , * russian nationals * ? 
  in order to work as a foreign service officer * you need to be a us citizen at the date of application * . 
  but yeah , go ahead and lie through your teeth , you peabrain . 
  * all 755 of them * ?!, 
  yeah , not buying that .
