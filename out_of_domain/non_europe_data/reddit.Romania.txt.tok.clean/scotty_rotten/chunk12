  so your logic would be , putin fired his own co-nationals in order to punish the us ? 
  also , i highly doubt the us contracts foreign security detail for its embassies - that is illogical to say the least . 
  guess i did not make myself clear enough . 
  of course a number of actual russian nationals work in some way or another for the us embassies . 
  ** that does not mean that , of the 755 , all of them were russian nationals and trump was right to take a giant shit on their current situation **, 
  this applies to the exterior of the actual embassy grounds and they are employed by the local government , not the us embassy . 
  ergo , these foreign security officers could n't have been included in the 755 staff members expulsed by the russian authorities as it would have been tantamount to firing your own employees to punish someone else . 
  well , this is what 's been discussed in this comment chain . 
  us government personnel diplomatic/security or others being expulsed by the russians . 
  but yeah , when you do it - about cnn or the big ol' scary msm - it is n't subjective . 
  give me a break . 
  the people , in their majority , voted for ** clinton ** . 
  that 's 3 million ** more ** people who preferred clinton over trump . 
   ... and the people voted for trump , it 's his agenda now, 
  looks like you were the one spreading fake news , buddy . 
  i stated no opinion whatsoever just official numbers . 
  wether you accept it or not is irrelevant . 
  fact is , ** the people ** , at least the ones who showed up to vote , ** wanted clinton to be president ** . 
  here 's an opinion though :, 
  i do n't think clinton would have been a good choice , however , we learned that it actually * can * be worse than having her as president . 
  sorry , got curious and looked up your posts ... 
   the us , who practically joined last minute for the spoils of war ... 
  apparently history is n't your strongest suit either . 
  the us was seriously involved in the war ever since pearl harbor 1941 . 
  actually , even before that if you take into account all the crucial things done to support the allies against the nazis . 
  neutrality patrols , confiscating german shipping , convoy duty ( see sinking of uss reuben james in 1941 ) . 
  they were officially fully on `` in the fight '' in europe ever since north africa campaign in 1942 . 
  1942 is not `` at the last minute '' by whatever measure you would stretch logic . 
  but yeah , to hell with facts , to hell with reality !, 
   white countries are in a constant state of demographic replacement . 
  there is no such thing as demographic replacement . 
  at least not in the context you 're putting it in . 
  all western nations have been , are and will always be in a considerable majority white . 
  the fact that you 're a reactionist or conspiracy theorist of migrant waves does n't change that . 
  what you 're saying is tantamount to the `` paris is 90 % muslim '' bullshit . 
  you should know better than this . 
   we are already a minority in the world-wide picture and that population is declining in relation to other races . 
  white people always where a minority worldwide , even during the crusades . 
  what 's your point ? 
  we stat having 8 kids at a time like the others ? 
  just hope 2-3 survive and the state pays for the rest ? 
  or maybe start killing off some of the other races ? 
  you make literally no sense with this argument . 
   white nations are not allowed to be white anymore ... 
  yet again , keep your far-right sjw shit to yourself . 
  no one with half a brain is buying this outrageous shit . 
  because some crazy far-leftists think whites should be punished does not mean ** the majority of whites are self-loathing ** . 
  you sound like an angry teenager , get ahold of yourself . 
   ... anti-white hiring practices that take place , and the anti-white education enrollment ... 
  more right-wing sjw crap . 
  the fact that some employers have some weird views on race and equality does not mean it is the norm . 
  ** it is not even close to being the norm . 
  ** you keep trying to paint this apocalyptic scenario and honestly , it 's downright pathetic . 
  you either do n't get out into the real world much or get your information from 4chan . 
  literally nothing you 've described as `` anti-white '' happens in a large enough scale to even begin to be considered a problem , at least in the west . 
   if you believe in collective guilt as many other liberals out there , do you not think that the jews were at all responsible for their persecution of the german people during the end of , and after ww1 ? 
  were the jewish/polish/german children also responsible ? 
  were those also subversive agents ? 
  where they saboteurs ? 
  you are a right fuckwit . 
  you are an absolute moron . 
  and this convinced me my time has been wasted . 
  this is where i stop . 
  literally no point in arguing with a fucking nutcase . 
  have fun living in your far-right sjw paradise . 
  remember , the world is not at fault because you 're a short , ugly incel . 
  he does n't even know . 
  do n't ask too much of him . 
  maaan , i knew some of you alt-righters were nothing but a buncha whiny , teen right-wing sjw ... but lol . 
  a black dude is responsible for the vile white supremacist racists that existed way before he was even in the public eye ?!, 
  grow the fuck up princess . 
  not that i agree with them but , when did blm burn down cities ? 
  violent protests does not equal fucking burning down cities , you twonk . 
  let 's not forget what the predecessors of these mouth-breathing inbreds with nazi flags used to do during the '60s . 
  also , trump actually blamed people that got run over in the same voice as fucking neo-nazi losers . 
  at no point did he call out this fucker for what he was . 
  a radicalized alt-right whacko . 
  only one side ran over innocent people in that protest and it 's the ones you 're defending ... neo-nazi fuckwits . 
  get real you delusional nutter . 
  also , tell me buddy , how bad does it hurt when you realize a black man was elected president twice in the us and is generally viewed in a favorable light - more so when compared to the republican trainwreck that bush was . 
  how bad does it hurt when , just a few months in , the majority of people do not like trump ? 
  how bad does it hurt when you realize ** the people ** voted , in their majority , for clinton ? 
  ( 3 million more people voted for clinton instead of trump ) . 
  enjoy your painful descent back into irrelevance !, 
  remember , the next generation will be nationalist and conservative !, 
  and absolutely fuck them for that . 
  edit : meant blm , not cops . 
  obama the racist . 
  that 's really nice dear . 
  now run along . 
  talibangelists, 
  [ keep working on it . 
  you 'll get there . 
  [ maybe this will help ] ( http://www.juventudrebelde.cu/file/img/fotografia/2013/04/29130-fotografia-g.jpg ) . 
  like the reality in which that fat disgrace calls the victims of sandy hook paid actors or a former president a terrorist just because he does n't like him ? 
  go take a hike knobhead . 
   ... much worse at a larger level ... 
  you are a legitimate idiot . 
  there 's no need to actually debate this by giving a well thought out counter argument . 
  if you believe this crap you 've been brainwashed to the point of no return by a bunch of pathetic losers and wastes of space like alex jones .
