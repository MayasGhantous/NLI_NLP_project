  good man !, 
  here 's your argument buddy , eat it up :, 
  guy is straight up calling people ran over , and implicitly , a woman killed by a dickless neo-nazi , a bunch of planted false-flaggers . 
  that should in ** no fucking way ** , in your delusional world , be the same thing as cnn posting footage of a dead refugee kid . 
  more so when cnn 's coverage of syria 's us backed [ rebels ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/06/world/meast/syria-rebels/index.html ) includes parts where they are not presented in a favorable light . 
  calling out a disgraceful shit for brains who pisses on the people affected by sandy hook . 
  can you imagine ?!, 
  the nerve of me doing such a thing !, 
  oh , i 'm sold . 
  absolutely . 
  gon na go buy some pills from the infowars store to support his fight against big pharma . 
  then gon na vote for whoever he says i should because , you know , he 's never been caught lying . 
  i acknowledge that alex jones is a piece of shit con artist . 
  i acknowledge that he incites people to violence . 
  i acknowledge that he makes shit up with very little to back up his claims . 
  i acknowledge he whores himself for cash by hiding behind the fake `` please support us by buying these fake products '' shtick . 
  * i also acknowledge that he tried to paint the counter protesters at charlottesville as false-flag operators . 
  * ** in an event where only one side ran into a crowd of dozens of people with a car . 
  that fucking neo-nazi maniac ran into a random crowd of dozens of people just because , like you , in his head all of them were antifa . 
  for all he knew there could have been a mother with a baby in her arms in that crowd . 
  fuck anyone who tries to reason with these western equivalent of isis lite . 
  [ or this . 
  ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fpirak3qtdy ), 
  well , we 're not the ones humping our own sisters . 
  we 'll be fine , thanks for the concern , inbred . 
  so not only do you not have any idea what you 're talking about but you 're also retarded . 
  [ cinco cero ] ( http://static.goal.com/117900/117900_heroa.jpg ) . 
  in yokel mchicksville that might be the case . 
  the case that the left is nothing but that . 
  also , you do realize that it 's just you and cleatus that consider being gay as a bad thing , right ? 
  some crazy hard-left neo-communists supports sanders = all liberals are followers of karl marx !!!, 
  whole rally of neo-nazis scream `` heil trump ! '', 
  whilst doing the nazi salute and some cary nazi flags = yeah but you 're not seeing the big picture !, 
  do n't get that drool on me you freaking mouth-breathing hillbilly , back 10 meters !, 
  i can smell the trailer park on you . 
  i link something from 7 years ago , you link something from 22 years ago . 
  not everyone is an incel like you bruv . 
  also , you dumbfuck , it 's `` you 're '' . 
  ... and non-moderate trump supporters . 
  funny how they have so much in common with radical muslims . 
  they are called talibangelists and vanilla isis after all ... 
  saying national socialists `` belong to the left and they should own them '' - just because it has `` socialism '' in its name is idiotic . 
  it 's the same as saying north korea is democratic because it 's called * democratic * people 's republic of n. korea . 
  fucking teenagers . 
  goes to show the quality of the people that congregate over here . 
  stranger popping in to help you out :, 
  so much winning !,

  you think i 'm going to answer any other way to some shmuck advocating for `` reddit liberals legit need to be castrated '' ? 
  the idiot does n't even know the difference between `` your '' and `` you 're '' for crying out loud ... 
  when he had anything to do with clinton he was n't involved in any racist/kkk shit for decades . 
  you 've been caught peddling bullshit . 
  are you from t_d ? 
  * checks history *, 
  i keep doing it yet i fail to be surprised every time . 
  some guy on youtube ... 
  what ?!, 
  they 're free thinkers donchakno !, 
  ask bannon . 
  it 's ok , trump 's dad was arrested at an actual kkk meeting so it 's all good . 
  clinton , trump and his dad , soros and the martians must all go down for their ties with the indonesian space pirate nazi mafia !, 
  you realize people can see your post history , right ? 
   there 's nothing like that on thedonald . 
  guess you can know what goes on at the_dumbass without being there . 
  what part of squashing the heads of nazis and italian fascists plus their leadership confuses you ? 
  you 're beautiful . 
  never forget that . 
  gascucksmemewarnow was saying that nazi germany and italy had the only fascist leaderships around the ww2 timeline . 
  he is an idiot . 
  many nations had fascist and fascist-like leadership during that time . 
  in short : y u attack me w/o reading up the context ;(, 
  my last name is trump . 
  sorry , i do n't know what that means . 
  he [ dodged ] ( https://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/08/02/us/politics/donald-trump-draft-record.html ) the draft ** six fucking times ** because daddy trump had money and influence . 
  then goes on to call mccain a coward . 
  what a shitsmear . 
  ** edit : lmao i got banned for [ this ] ( https://oauth.reddit.com/r/conservative/comments/6tmbtn/foo/dlmpl4m ) post **,
