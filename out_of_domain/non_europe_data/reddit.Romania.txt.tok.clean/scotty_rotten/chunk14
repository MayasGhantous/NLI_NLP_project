  you do n't get passed six times through the draft as a disabled person , you idjit . 
  here we go . 
  romania - fascist . 
  hungary - fascist . 
  croatia/serbia - fascist . 
  japan - fascist . 
  spain - fascist . 
  i can go on but you get the idea . 
   that 's not fascism . 
  if they rule like fascists , treat their people like fascists what would that make them ? 
  yup . 
  you literally have no idea on the subject you 're talking about . 
  why do republicans consider anyone left of them nothing but communist freeloaders ? 
  the r/the _ dunce trailer park festival has arrived to the thread everyone !, 
  and here 's something nightmarish for all y' alls :, 
  holly cow , look at how bad it is lol, 
  democrat party was more racist ? 
  wow , you really are full of shit . 
  then again the t_d will upvote anything that tickles their fragile ego ... 
  for anyone wondering , the retard with the most upvoted comment in this thread had submitted a post called [ hillary the child molester ? ] ( https://youtu.be/-ssa9tta0-k ) '' . 
  hope this gives everyone a clear idea of the sort of people that took over this thread . 
  nice right-wing sjw rhetoric . 
  ok then . 
  thought i 'd get an answer from someone who is n't a 14 year old . 
  my mistake . 
  that 's cool . 
  tell us something about feminists . 
  something about globalists . 
  are the literally satan 's followers ? 
  when is the next meeting of y' all-qaeda going to be ? 
  he 's the right-wing equivalent of what he 's blabbering on about . 
  literally a right-wing sjw . 
  too oblivious to see they 've become the enemy they hate . 
  why am i being silenced ?!?!?!, 
  the tolerant left strikes again !, 
  not going to reply when you 're caught lying like a toddler ? 
  typical . 
  and then you t_d retards wonder why reddit want to shove you in the deepest darkest corner . 
  you literally pollute the site with lies , propaganda and made up bullshit . 
  adjust your top comment , if you will , to point out this important fact :, 
  trump denounced * umbrella terms * for far-right shitheads ... kkk , nazis etc. 
  what he should have denounced is actual people , actual organizations . 
  like [ vanguard america ] ( https://www.adl.org/education/resources/backgrounders/vanguard-america ) -- car murderer was part of this , or richard spencer - known neo-nazi who organized [ unite the right ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/dcfztorxkaanji6.jpg ) . 
  got banned by u/chabanais for owning his butt in an argument . 
  he insta banned me and removed all my posts . 
  sensitive little thing , ai n't he . 
  ** edit : notice how they 're downvoting u/cbarnett010 's post to cut us off . 
   i have no tolerance for dipshits . 
  - u/chabanais , after banning me from r/conservative , in response to me saying this :, 
   show me where trump said `` unite the right should not have invited racists , neo-nazis and white supremacists '' . 
   trump only condemned umbrella terms for far-right maniacs not actual organizations or leaders . 
  why did n't trump denounce richard spencer ? 
  or all of the neo-nazi/ultra-far-right movements present at charlottesville ? 
   also , from what i know even blm denounced the dallas shooter and said they had no link to him . 
   in short , when trump is going to blame vanguard america and other far-right groups , i 'll agree with you that obama should have done the same with blm . 
  ... and where the comment chain started : https://reddit.com/r/conservative/comments/6tmbtn/ted_cruz_rekt_him/dlmbvx1, 
  ** to be noted , this ass is intentionally spreading lies . 
  obama invited the blm * before * the dallas cop shooting attack . 
  that 's wut ya git fer being a dayum thought criminul !, 
  fixed . 
  as i said , if you will - if you want . 
  here you go . 
  trump 's [ poor approval ratings ] ( http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/news/special/2017/newsspec_16394/img/5_approval_trump_tracker_976_v1.jpg ) . 
  show it to that u/northblizzard liar who keeps posting * only * the anti-trump subreddits whilst conveniently omitting all the pro-trump ones and the ones infiltrated by trumpets ( r/imgoingtohellforthis , r/conservative , r/kotakuinaction to name a very , very small few ), 
  ... and so is the absolute trash coming from the republican side . 
  arguably worse . 
  shit like fix news , zero hedge , countless idiots on youtube , paul j. watson etc. 
  for an old sea wolf , tired of all that damn bias , you sure are biased as shit . 
  it is also a know fact , that that clown 's approval rating is a * historic low *, 
  trump 's [ poor approval ratings ] ( http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/news/special/2017/newsspec_16394/img/5_approval_trump_tracker_976_v1.jpg ) . 
  do n't know why i keep doing this ... expecting a fair and balanced opinion in a thread swarmed by idiots from t_d triggered that they saw something anti-trump . 
  can i do the same ? 
  go on t_d and spam my biased leftist views ? 
  i was instabanned there . 
  science is dead ? 
  well , if you 're as uneducated as i think you are , yes , that is in fact the case . 
  that is exactly what the guy before me did . 
  are you even paying attention ? 
  well then , by the same logic , reddit is overwhelmingly liberal and therefore a liberal talk space . 
  time to silence some conservatives . 
  [ is this speaking broadly enough for you ? 
  ] ( https://reddit.com/r/anarchism/comments/6l7aeb/why_am_i_facing_75_years_in_prison_by_threatening/djrs4hq ), 
   lmao !, 
  condemned ? 
  obama invited blm terrorists to the wh . 
  ok , so you 're shamelessly lying to my face . 
  good day . 
  he was not correct . 
  he wrote it up in that way to make it sound like ** italy and germany were the only nations with fascist leaderships . 
  ** * that is not true , so what he said is false . 
  * i do n't see where i 'm mistaken ? 
   your so thin skinned yourself, 
  glorious . 
  i 'm being called a moron by someone who does n't know how to use `` your '' and `` you 're '' . 
  romania being fascist had little to do with the germans . 
  antonescu was prominent before ol' jerries came for oil . 
  it was a pseudo take over of power . 
  japan 's fascist-like leadership had little to do with hitler outside the fact they were allied . 
  spain . 
  if you do n't know this one , you should n't be having this discussion .
