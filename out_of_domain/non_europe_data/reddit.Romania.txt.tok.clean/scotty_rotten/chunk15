  stick to `` deus vult '' or whatever you 4chan kids say these days . 
  constant leftist/liberal bashing on kia, 
   left leaning or pretty centrist, 
  ok dude , whatever you say . 
  that 's true , my mistake for exaggerating . 
  you do however see the burning hypocrisy of all of these right-wing/conservative/alt-right / trump subreddits silencing any kind of alternative discourse whilst bitching about how the msm are fascists , right ? 
  more so when said discourse proves them wrong . 
  the charlottesville attack was n't the first done by a far-right extremist and this is the first time trump condemned it . 
  after 3 days . 
  after intense pressure from the evil msm . 
  even then not condemning actual organizations like vanguard america . 
  just using buzzwords or umbrella terms like `` white supremacists '' . 
  [ here 's just a small selection of said extremism . 
  ] ( https://reddit.com/r/anarchism/comments/6l7aeb/why_am_i_facing_75_years_in_prison_by_threatening/djrs4hq ), 
  that 's a nice collection of strawmen you have there . 
  the 2016-2017 collection of alt-right sjw buzzwords . 
  oh , since you were talking , i suppose , about cnn doxxing that racist piece of shit ... wait !, 
  they did n't actually doxx him , just threatened to do so . 
  here 's fox news going all the way and doing just [ that ] ( http://www.mediaite.com/online/fire-him-twitter-reacts-to-fox-host-lou-dobbs-doxxing-trump-accuser/amp/ ) . 
  i await your post on kia condemning these fix news bullies . 
  [ richard soencer ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/dcfztorxkaanji6.jpg ) organized this with the help of the guy you 're talking about . 
  nice lie though . 
  also i do n't eat the first thing 4chan or alex jones shits in my mouth so i ca n't read the rest of that conspiracy trash you wrote there . 
  also trump did n't condemn vanguard america - the organization that weakling neo-nazi was part of . 
  why the upset about obama not condemning blm ? 
  you tried to link a ** clear and undeniable neo-nazi ** as someone who conspired with ** antifa ** to smear ** neo-nazis ** . 
  that 's how brainless your theory is . 
  and that 's just jason kessler . 
  guessing we 're going to ignore pro-trump fervent neo-nazi richard spencer who organized unite the right ? 
  refuzandu-le dreptul de a se casatori legal . 
  yes or no ? 
  my bad . 
  so what you 're saying is that it 's happening across the board and that cnn is no worse than fox news or other right wing media ? 
  him :, 
   my bias ? 
  you 're missing the point . 
  corporate news is all designed for one thing , to have influence over us . 
   and so is the absolute trash coming from the republican side . 
  arguably worse . 
  shit like fix news , zero hedge , countless idiots on youtube , paul j. watson, 
  not the same thing . 
  are you fucking kidding me ? 
  yeah . 
  you 're right . 
  i 'm wrong . 
  i 'm wrong that i did n't hammer home the fact that ** cnn did n't go ahead with the doxxing and only threatened ( still bad ) , and fox news posted everything . 
  address , name , everything . 
  so in this particular case fox news is actually worse than cnn . 
  i 'm not wrong . 
  you 're wrong . 
  trust me . 
  i know wrong . 
  that 's wrong . 
  so wrong . 
  totally . 
  yeah . 
  sad . 
  i 'm not going to completely discredit your point of view on kia but it is really hard . 
  every time i look at the sub , every post that reaches r/all and most top comments are * very * right-wing and generally anti-left . 
  ironic , they could n't physically remove others but have been physically removed themselves . 
  ok i admit i stole that . 
  hate on both sides . 
  let me tell you . 
  both sides . 
  so much hate . 
  sad . 
  what did you say that riled them up ? 
  same thing becomes apparent on their love of `` individual freedoms '' . 
  love it how that slowly fades when they talk about lgbts and in some non-moderate cases racial minorities as well . 
  in that case , i 'll take the time to explain myself . 
  i do n't usually say that to people unless they say abhorrent shit - like that ass did up there . 
  imagine the soros paychecks $ _ $, 
  have you ever heard the term `` antifa '' before donald trump or before this surge of the far-right ? 
  have you heard the term neo-nazi/kkk member before all this ? 
  it 's almost as if they are a reaction to something whilst the other is a sort of `` is this shit your job bro '' kind of deal . 
  also , i would n't like to be associated with true , dangerous hard-left loonies , thx . 
  i was referring to the us `` antifa '' . 
  because `` anti-fascists '' have been in the spotlight since the '80s , most notably in europe . 
  [ dirty leftist here adding fuel to the fire . 
  ] ( https://reddit.com/r/anarchism/comments/6l7aeb/why_am_i_facing_75_years_in_prison_by_threatening/djrs4hq ), 
  known ** for a fact ** to be spreading lies , conspiracies and generally a shitrag . 
  i mean , i 'm not going to argue that aljazeera is good journalism but you come with that shit . 
  the list still stands buddy . 
  people yelling trump and kicking , shooting , stabbing other people . 
  are you going to * refute * reality that these people did those things ? 
  are all trump supporters like that ? 
  are all leftists/liberals commies and sjw ? 
  if you spend enough time in your t_d echo chamber , maybe . 
   talking to people like you, 
  from a 77 day old account . 
  also a guy who thinks neo-nazis waving the nazi flag right next to the us flag is `` free speech '' . 
  i 'll take that as a compliment . 
  a fucking pow that got tortured until he could n't lift his arms above his head . 
  then trump goes on to be `` military 's best friend '' . 
  i would n't want to go to vietnam either and would do anything i could to get out . 
  but after that , i 'd keep my mouth shut and never speak of anything related to the military subject . 
  this fucker has the gall to blame a fucking pow . 
  respect pow !, 
  never forget the ones left behind !, 
  no wait , it 's mccain .
