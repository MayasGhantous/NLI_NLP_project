  he fucked donny 's pathetic attempt on healthcare repeal so we can exclude him !, 
  good thing reddit just banned a fervently neo-nazi sub that was closely intertwined with t_d . 
  physical_removal 's admin ethicalfuntime posted on t_d often and interacted with the userbase . 
  also , how triggered are you my dear right-wing sjw that you have to come pour your bruised little feelings into every anti-trump post ? 
  republicans sure did like it . 
  we 're taking our time on this one . 
  so the fact that your employer , the us military , says otherwise is irrelevant to you ? 
  and yet your post history would indicate otherwise . 
  you may not be from the_donald but you sure as hell support him and got triggered seeing this on the front page . 
  which is fucktastical !, 
  you realize how the rest of reddit feels looking at the_donald toilet constantly overflowing with the most mind-numbingly dumb shit to grace this site ? 
  how about we go abd spam post comments on every the_donald post that triggers us . 
  you 're just triggered the rest of the site is upvoting anything remotely anti-trump . 
  good . 
  you 're getting your own medicine then . 
  well , `` we '' kinda won as well . 
  there 's no better opponent for trump than the man himself . 
  i do n't have a `` side '' in this fight . 
  i just think he 's incompetent in terms of his job and repugnant as a normal guy . 
  i also , usually , in my country , never vote . 
  the us military 's verified and approved version of the events that mccain went through in north vietnam are in line with what he said . 
  i 've said it before , i literally upvote anything that is even remotely anti-trump - even the shitty nonsense ones . 
  the reason being , i still remember the time when they fully took advantage of the fact that they botted their way to the front page and filled it with lies/propaganda/blatant insults to leftists . 
  that is gone now , as you said , because admins probably made it so and that 's good . 
  you can not imagine how the front page would look like if they had their way again . 
  remember when we had to deal with their made up pedogate lies and bullshit ? 
  i remember . 
  remember when the whole site as a whole would be called cucks ? 
  i remember . 
  remember when they were shitting on the people who run this site but continue to use it like spoiled brats ? 
  i remember . 
  all in all , * most * ( ok some ) of these anti-trump posts make sense . 
  the recent backlash against the whole ~ ~ people that got run over have themselves to blame for being violent ~ ~ / ~ ~ i hate neo-nazis ! ~ ~ / both sides to blame thing is nothing but his fault . 
  nobody put those words in his mouth . 
  whenever there 's a radical islamic terrorist attack he probably jumps of his shitter unwiped to blame muslims as a whole or something . 
  in that case he can blame the obvious guilty party . 
  in this case , the crowd that had normal people , women and teenagers barely able to lift their own weight - the crowd that got run over isis-style was equally to blame for being `` violent '' . 
  only thing that will redeem him , on this particular issue , is at the next terror attack he 'll say something like `` radical islamic terrorists are bad but our brave soldiers should n't have invaded iraq/afghanistan either . 
  both sides to blame . 
  so much hate on both sides . '', 
  i mean common , it 's livid that he 's wrong and reddit losing their shit over it is justified . 
   thegatewaypundit is simply a right leaning site . 
  hm ... right leaning . 
  and you wonder why people on reddit labels the whole of the political right with `` conspiracy theorists , racists , nutcases and nazis '' . 
  it 's because you swallow up all this repulsive garbage just because it is `` against the msm narrative '' . 
  let 's see , a small collection of utter dung from thegatewaypundit :, 
   ** during the campaign , the site claimed that photos of hundreds of thousands of people in the streets of cleveland showed the crowd for a trump rally ** when , in fact , the photos depicted a victory parade for the nba champion cavaliers , and during the inauguration , it reported as real a hoax picture that had been poorly photoshopped to make it appear as though obama was touching melania trump 's rear end during the transfer of power . 
  [ picture in question ] ( https://cloudfront.mediamatters.org/static/uploader/image/2016/08/04/hoftline.png ), 
   ** cnn photoshops the photo of oregon killer chris harper-mercer to make him look white **, 
   cnn did not alter the skin color of the photo . 
  cnn media reporter brian stelter tweeted that the photo is `` not real '' and that cnn `` has n't shown any images of the gunman . '', 
  [ picture in question ] ( https://cloudfront.mediamatters.org/static/uploader/image/2017/01/24/lgfgatewaypunditcnn.png ), 
   ** birtherism conspiracy garbage **, 
  [ picture in question ] ( https://cloudfront.mediamatters.org/static/uploader/image/2017/01/24/hoftbirther.png ), 
   ** plenty of articles on hillary 's health hoax . 
  she just keeps being on her death bed according to the site but just keeps kicking . 
  strange how that is , is n't it ? 
   ** white house asked for applause at tucson event **, 
   the text that hoft thought featured instructions was actually closed captioning . 
  a spokesperson for the university of arizona told media matters at the time : `` the text you see on the screen was part of the closed captioning provided for the individuals in attendance who were hearing impaired . '', 
  [ picture in question ] ( https://cloudfront.mediamatters.org/static/images/item/20110115-hoftpost.jpg ), 
   doxing people who create gifs ? 
  you mean how cnn only * threatened to doxx * but ultimately did n't ? 
  it 's sure as shit still is bad ... but not the same thing . 
  you know what 's the same thing as what you said though ? 
  [ this ] ( http://www.mediaite.com/online/fire-him-twitter-reacts-to-fox-host-lou-dobbs-doxxing-trump-accuser/amp/ ) . 
   nazis have the right, 
  no they do not . 
  they have no right to promote the taking away of the rights of others . 
  zero . 
  there is no two ways about this . 
  asking for cops to not shoot black people is not the same thing as shouting `` blut und boden '' . 
  look at the [ blm site ] ( http://blacklivesmatter.com/ ) and the message they 're promoting . 
  then go on really any neo-nazi site and see what * they * are promoting . 
  i do n't like the sjw-like narrative of blm but the white supremacists/neo-nazis make me sick . 
  it took me 14 minutes to find this info and write it up for you , it 's not that hard to inform yourself . 
   maybe they were right when they gave credence to the theory that malaysia whateverthefucknumberitis escaped atmosphere and flew into space, 
   `` the day before his apology , cnn identified the man behind the account and attempted to make contact with him '', 
  how the fuck is that doxxing ? 
  do you understand the difference between what fox news did and cnn did ? 
  let me help you , cnn threatened to doxx and backed off after talking to the guy , as you said . 
  ** fox news doxxed someone who accused trump of raping her ** is that simple enough for you ? 
   everyone has a right to free speech . 
  everyone has the right to not be persecuted by the government and have his voice silenced . 
  freedom of speech is not freedom of consequence . 
  i 'm not even from the us and i know this better than you , apparently . 
  these people were promoting violence towards jews , blacks and whatever . 
  fucking children could hear them . 
  if you want to say hateful shit , do it at your klan gathering or on your property or whatever . 
  there is no room for that brainless shit in public . 
  edit :, 
   black lives matter , and everyone who disagrees with me should be thrown in jail along with the nazis . 
  show me where black lives matter , as an official movement - not some fucktard yelling racist shit towards whites - promotes violence . 
  dudette , i think . 
  i really wonder some times , if migrants would actually be properly screened for crazy radicals and it would be revealed that a lot of them would be perfectly alright - i wonder , would they still be alright with foreigners ? 
  as in , is it really just `` hey , i do n't want crazy radical islamists '' or something else . 
  disclaimer : was n't talking about unterbas and i have no real information if screening is done properly or how some people say `` gates wide open '' . 
   do you not remember when cnn was hunting for the malaysian plane that got lost ? 
  i 'm not able to remember which numeral designation that plane had and i do n't want to confuse it with the one that got shot down in ukraine . 
  what of it and cnn ?
