  but i could be wrong . 
  any evidence ? 
  coming from a fuckwit trying to defend those people . 
  i 'm to blame for the dumb shit this guy says ? 
  i know you 're not past 18 by much probably , but learn to be accountable for the gobshite that you spew . 
  watch the [ fucking video ] ( https://news.vice.com/story/vice-news-tonight-full-episode-charlottesville-race-and-terror ) you asshole . 
  those are normal people , not antifa . 
  people like you - who label innocent people who did n't want neo-nazis on their doorstep - is why that fuck with the car thought it was ok to charge into that crowd . 
  `` because they were all violent antifa '' . 
  you fucking idiot . 
  it 's on topic - about the cville protest - he 's literally defending neo-nazis . 
  he 's labeling innocent people , like heyes , as someone who 's got fault in the fact that she got ran over . 
  then goes on to call someone else shameful when he says the thing i quoted . 
  are you dense ? 
  learn to use `` its '' and `` it 's '' you peabrain . 
  literally calling people that got run over `` lacking common sense '' . 
  and you wonder why people mass label trump supporters as literal retards . 
  also , did you even watch the video to see just what kind of people where counter-protesting ? 
  i 'd really love to see your evidence of the counter-protestors beating up reporters . 
  my apologies then . 
  i 'd erase the ugly words but i think it serves to underline my mistake better that way . 
  it 's just that it 's hard to tell , with way too many people trying to paint it the way i 've explained above . 
  if that kid would n't have been brainwashed to believe that all the people in that crowd were communists , feminists , gays or whatever , maybe he would n't have killed someone . 
  i really believe this wholesale labeling of anyone liberal , as dirty antifa/communists , at least partially responsible for what happened . 
  [ ** how many euros for the dry clean ? 
  edit : mmm , i can smell the rustled jimmies already . 
   very true the same can be said of labeling every republican , conservative and trump supporter as nazis, 
  and that would be called fighting ignorance with more ignorance . 
  always a good strategy . 
   both are painting one side as perfect angels and the other as evil incarnate . 
  as biased as i am , you have to admit , the right side is waaay more to blame than the left on this . 
  birtherism ? 
  linking practically every opponent with ridiculous conspiracies like assassinations and pedophile rings ? 
  also does n't help when your main figurehead is caught lying time and time again . 
  are we still doing the cleaners thing ? 
  because i need to [ drop ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/04/21/article-1379144-0bb96e2d00000578-269_306x423.jpg ) something off . 
  why would i expect anything else but downvotes by posting here , in r/realmadrid ? 
  i do n't think y' all understand that i am thoroughly enjoying myself at your expense . 
  i 'm from romania actually but ok , sure . 
  whatever feeds the r/realmadrid 's home away from home , r/soccer 's circlejerk . 
  funny you should use that line of thinking seeing as that 's how i see most of real madrid fans here as well . 
  i 'm willing to bet most do n't even know who [ this ] ( http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/sites/sbs.com.au.theworldgame/files/styles/full/public/gettyimages-97614629.jpg?itok=9k4oatrb ) is . 
  or [ this ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/5b/a0/ef/5ba0ef0c3fc47f3306767910c0e35e38.jpg ) guy . 
  heck , we 're getting scolded for being divers by a team who 's top player does [ this ] ( https://i.makeagif.com/media/12-07-2014/razmbw.gif ) . 
  or called uefalona by the club who invented fergietime or by a team which could have its player back home on his couch but still be [ onside ] ( http://cdn.images.dailystar.co.uk/dynamic/58/photos/579000/620x/cristiano-ronaldo-real-madrid-offside-atletico-610835.jpg ) . 
  or , rightfully , shat on by for the cannibal suarez but turn a blind eye to legit physical [ assault ] ( http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view3/3490125/pepe-s-mad-o.gif ) . 
  not to mention that i 'm actually a big fan of some real players . 
  ramos , aside from his dangerous tackles and unsportsmanlike behavior is a damn legend . 
  but yeah , top comments like `` fuck barca '' or shitty facebook/twitter memes are totally ok in comparison with my `` childish '' attempt at banter . 
  you can understand how i see the downvotes as the exact opposite of what they usually mean , right ? 
  yup , if we do n't win a sextuple this season with 99 % possession each game , with at least one goal scored by kubala whilst cr7 is in goal , i 'm turning full blanco . 
  fuck this shit . 
  surely you ca n't be this silly , can you ? 
  it 's freaking written in our damn anthem ... 
  love the attention to details . 
  even got the green furniture right and the elcan sight . 
  you realize why these `` cunts '' cried about that gif , right ? 
  it 's because that simpleton posted it as an official message of the office of the us presidency . 
  like how you support nba teams ? 
  [ stop lying .

  the fans you say ? 
  nice post history .

  just be an adult and own up to your duplicity . 
  also , by your logic , you should hope sunderland never wins - you know , in order to not become too mainstreamy . 
  not that that would be something to worry about for sunderland . 
  oh , so when i do it it 's being insensitive . 
  when you do it it 's `` bantz m8 '' . 
  and there 's more than that as reason for which i [ side ] ( http://storage01transcoder.rcs-rds.ro/storage/2013/07/19/103265_103265_popescu_barca.jpg ) with [ barca ] ( https://stocknewsusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/744fc712bfbbb69e62fa32f8f3547351.jpg ) . 
  i could have * sworn * that i saw a real flair . 
  oh well , point still stands , plenty of `` dirty clubs '' out there but `` diving barca '' or `` taxalona '' is this sub 's only fixation . 
  not that i 'd care but way too many idiots think barca fans are alright with that shit going on in our club . 
  you just hate me because i am a karma machine . 
  typical . 
  i have also adjusted the post accordingly . 
  just when you thought these incel losers could n't get any worse ... 
  just found this sub . 
  you guys are terrible !, 
  how do i get flaired up ? 
  you really seem like a reasonable individual , but that is just total nonsense . 
  antifa , as in the antifa that we know today , that organizes on facebook/social media to commit crimes did n't exist before this resurgence of the far-right . 
  not on this magnitude and not this organized . 
  you had anti-fascist movements before - really popular in the 80s - but they never got the exposure they get today and therefore they had little power . 
  i do n't like extremists of any color but let 's see it for what it is . 
  an extreme ( and wrong ) answer to far-right extremists . 
  i mean it 's even in their name and modus operandi ... against fascists . 
  of course , being full with brainless idiots they will undoubtedly label anyone , including the moderates as nazis and literally hitler . 
  you 're either `` on their side '' or you get your head kicked in . 
  delusional idiots is the perfect description . 
  also to note , they have no clear `` political enemy '' . 
  so this argument that antifa is out to get a particular political entity is wrong .
