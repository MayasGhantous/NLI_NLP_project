  they 're just going by `` duck duck duck nazi '' . 
  that is not the same with the alt-right ( read far-right/ultra-nationalists/ethnocretins / racists ) . 
  they 're the ones injecting actual change on the socio-political scene . 
  these are the people who will quietly slide in the propaganda and lies you see everywhere now . 
  look at any youtube comment section on political issues , look on popular news sites . 
  check some right leaning media . 
  filled to the brink with blatant falsehoods . 
  it 's how you 're seeing 16 year olds now worshipping pinochet , milosevic . 
  these kids are getting their world view from 4chan , crazy-side of reddit etc. 
  i can see how you think they 're the same but honestly one 's a bunch of violent overzealous `` warriors '' ( antifa ) , whilst the other is silently trying to change reality replacing it with lies and a made up world . 
  edit : another important thing to consider is how antifa is being used as an attempt to create this left-wing boogeyman and delegitimize the growing concerns regarding the far-right . 
  `` well what did you expect them to do ? 
  did n't you see they were provoked ? 
  '' , `` x-ultra-nationalist political party was assaulted by antifa . 
  they were just expressing their views . 
  why not give x-party a chance ? '', 
  what would your view on conscription be for a country like austria ? 
  basically surrounded by firm allies and shielded by nato . 
  would conscription be ok in this situation ? 
  thanks obama . 
  yeah , but no more cool tanks then . 
  where 's the fun in that ? 
  10-4 , but i have n't and was n't going to cross the line . 
   if you define antifa so narrowly to mean `` the organizations that use twitter to organize attacks '' , then it 's trivially true to say that antifa did not preexist twitter , therefore did n't preexist the alt-right . 
  but that 's obviously an artificially narrowed view of antifa , which has been active for decades , e.g. 
  1990s anti-wto activity . 
  your reading comprehension seems to be off a bit today . 
  my point is that antifa , as it is today , did not exist `` decades ago '' . 
  a simplified version of what i have said is that they have evolved from the * hey , the punk concert is over , let 's go squash some nazis * to * join our fight against these `` fascists '' . 
  bring as many people as you can ! * . 
  the latter message being posted online where potentially it can gather thousands of people in a march . 
  also bringing together the reactionaries and normal people who would n't mix with them otherwise . 
  do you not understand how that 's different ? 
  you are , again , confusing antifa with `` anti-fascists '' of the 1980s and before , who are a whole different ball game than what 's going on today . 
  in fact , you do that constantly throughout your wall of text . 
  read up on how the anti-fascist movement behaved and came into contact with normal society before `` antifa '' , you clearly do n't know the difference between the two . 
   but that 's obviously an artificially narrowed view of antifa , which has been active for decades , e.g. 
  1990s anti-wto activity . 
  case and point . 
   the view that left-wing terrorism is only now emerging as some sort of reaction against breitbart and richard spencer is obviously leftist apologetics , and it 's dishonest . 
  no , actually , that would be disingenuous . 
  and i never said that . 
  mostly because alt-right is not just breitbart and richard spencer . 
  you 're also terribly confused in your terminology . 
  do not use left-wing terrorism to define antifa . 
  left-wing terrorism is something you use to describe the farc . 
  which pushes home the point i was making earlier . 
  you 're exaggerating and erasing the lines between full blown acts of terror ( a la farc - truck bombs , a perfectly organized structure and leadership etc ) and vandalism/anarchism/violence . 
   no , it is n't . 
  antifa pushes a particular ideological agenda . 
  try joining antifa as a neoliberal - they will beat the shit out of you . 
  antifa is only selective in their use of violence for strategic reasons - they attack conservatives rather than liberals because they think conservatives are the bigger threat . 
  they have no sympathy for , e.g. 
  hillary clinton , whom they consider a fascist ( neoliberalism , according to virtually every thinker - with the exception of foucault - antifa reads , is a fascist ideology ) . 
  antifa routinely targets those who are not far-right ( e.g. 
  ben shapiro ) or even right-wing ( g20 ) . 
  again , you either did n't read what i wrote properly or are just sticking to contradicting me even when we agree . 
  they do n't have a political compass which they bring with them and make people point where they align . 
  they go by ear . 
  hence `` duck duck duck nazi '' . 
  whatever does n't sound right is enough for them . 
  that is the exact reason why they have no definable political agenda - they just attack anyone who does n't seem non-nazi enough . 
  that 's why their main ideology is rife with anarchism . 
  to further my point , for example , neo-nazis/ultra-nationalists have a perfectly definable political target `` leftists/liberals/cuckservatives ( read communists or anyone who is n't right of them ) '' . 
  neo-nazis do n't go making trouble at your local hardcore conservative rally or whatever . 
  that 's the definition of `` targeting '' - seeking out a specific enemy and applying pressure there . 
  antifa does none of that , it just shows up at whatever event/protest does n't `` sound '' right to them . 
  as you said , that includes liberals , conservatives , anyone really . 
   communism is not just an `` anti-fascist action '' - it is its own ideology . 
  stop denying that antifa terrorists are n't agents morally responsible for their actions . 
  and again my suspicion is strengthened . 
  you get things mixed up . 
  if you think antifas are the `` ground troops of neo-communism '' it 's because you apply that term waaay too easily . 
  a simplistic counter-argument for this would be that most antifas consider soviet russia , communism and stalin as a very oppressive regime and want want nothing to do with it . 
  forgot about this :, 
   in fact , there 's good evidence that right-wing radicalism has been strengthened as a reaction to antifa ( this is a pervasive theme in , e.g. 
  ** libertarian media ** ) . 
  well there 's your problem . 
  if you 're going to bring that as backing for your argument - not providing a source - and glancing over the fact that much of liberterian media today is nothing but hysterical opinion peddling then you 're not going to get your point across . 
   what political change ? 
  this is a genuine question - i 'm not trying to ignore the danger of the alt-right , but i 'm honestly not sure that they 've accomplished anything of political importance that is n't just the result of other , stronger forces . 
  [ really ] ( http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/trump-alt-right-701x390.jpg ) ? 
   maybe they 've pulled the republican party into populism ( e.g. 
  opposition to free trade ) , ** but that conflates the alt-right with right-wing populism in general ** , the latter of which has far more influence on the gop . 
  that 's because they 're near indistinguishable at times . 
  right-wing populism/nationalism is exactly the way to describe the alt-right , amongst others . 
  so yes , you 're right on that point , they 've somehow managed to inject influence and actual change into the gop . 
  that 's because , unlike antifa , they 're not a mob of guys in the middle of the street throwing shit . 
  they 're normal people with seemingly good intentions . 
  it 's why , for antifa , if you see someone creating that much havoc - endorsing vandalism and anarchy - you 'll immediately , as a normal person , discredit their attempts to influence your political view . 
  an alt-right troll will seem to you like a normal dude trying to show you an `` alternative '' political route whilst shoving in as much lies , propaganda and falsehoods as possible . 
   i ca n't go to see a controversial right-wing speaker on my campus , because there 's a chance i 'll have my skull caved in by a baseball bat . 
  milo is not a `` speaker '' and he should n't be allowed to speak on a campus where normal , well adjusted people congregate . 
  can he make his own rally somewhere else ? 
  sure . 
  can he go anywhere else where kids do n't have to listen to his inane trash ? 
  sure . 
  quick selection of what milo would try and tell you at such a rally - a perfect example of an alt-right-er . 
  you even called him a `` speaker '' , as if he 's someone worth listening to . 
  anyone who 's right in the head would not want to listen to some antifa thug with a bat and a fetish for kicking heads in .
