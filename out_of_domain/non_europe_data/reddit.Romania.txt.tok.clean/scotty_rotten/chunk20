  alt-right trolls still get the benefit of the doubt . 
   after the death of fidel castro , yiannopoulos promoted a conspiracy theory that castro was the father of canadian prime minster justin trudeau . 
   in january 2017 , shortly after the women 's marches worldwide , yiannopoulos posted a video on his facebook page containing a caption : `` planned parenthood is about sterilizing black people '' . 
   yiannopoulos further commented that this kind of statutory rape and child abuse happens `` a lot '' in the lgbt community . 
  really , just do a quick google search of the toxic trash this ass tried to spew into public mainstream thought . 
   plenty of antifa-sympathizers will be lauded by the democratic establishment . 
   the problem with antifa is n't just that their views seep into institutions and the mainstream ( which they do , to a limited extent ) . 
  that is not happening . 
  has n't happened . 
  will not happen . 
  violence has this real nice side effect of pushing people away from your message . 
  the fact that few cute `` neo-communists '' think it 's cool that they some times fly soviet flags is not `` mainstream '' . 
  but again , i think you 're confusing antifa with neo-communism . 
  and worse , i think you 're confusing anarchism with communism . 
   antifa has an influence on our ability to engage in public discourse - does the alt-right do that ? 
  if that particular public discourse includes milo then i 'm not going to lose much sleep over it . 
  i 'd love it if actual authorities take a stand against these alt-right losers , but yeah . 
  authorities * should * start taking a stand against these alt-right conartists but more importantly it should be that way because i do n't want anarchists suddenly going blue-on-blue because they ca n't tell wrong from right . 
  as i said above , the alt-right is interested in only one thing , subverting the normal flow of opinion on politics/western society . 
  they do n't need to silence anyone . 
  like in the french elections when they had a whole social media campaign to convince young people to stay home and not vote because `` what 's the point , they 're all establishment '' . 
   antifa is not a `` boogieman '' - if you think that , you have not actually had any experience with antifa , you do n't know anybody who is in or supports antifa , and you do n't know anybody who 's been targeted by antifa . 
  although that 's my exact opinion on your portrayal of antifa ( maybe you 're suffering from confirmation bias ) - and i think there might be some serious confusion going on with your general view on the extremes of both the left and right spectrums of politics :, 
  i guess it 's my fault for over-simplifying it . 
  they are indeed used as a boogieman by right-wing adversaries . 
  this is undeniable so no point in changing my narrative on the subject . 
  however , what i should have said is that this is because they 're `` useful idiots '' and that the bigger part of the problem is that they 're sometimes * very dangerous and violent * . 
  i can see now how that last conclusion has left my previous post describing antifa in an inappropriate way . 
  nuff said .

  i took a decent amount of look into it and am pretty sure about it . 
  mind showing me what you know ? 
  that 's probably it . 
  in wows , norcal hull b is uss norcal from 1941 to late 1944 . 
  the cxam radar atop the foremast is the earlier model she and uss washington had . 
  all later hull ( s ) are uss norcal steaming off the coast of japan or iwo jima . 
  it has the newer version of the cxam radar - the one you saw on her as a museum ship .
