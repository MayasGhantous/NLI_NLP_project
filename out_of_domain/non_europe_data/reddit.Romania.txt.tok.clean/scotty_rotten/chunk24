  also , when in eden - and looking at the little icons for pilot , crew , passanger - most are not what they actually show , so until you find which one 's the actual pilot the jayhawk wo n't fly . 
  nope , it 's this one, 
  nice bit of detective work there , heh . 
  i did n't . 
  use eden and search for an empty object called `` pond '' . 
  i have a lot of mods so i 'm not very sure if it 's a vanilla thing or i added it in . 
  ok , i really have to ask . 
  how does this stuff get upvoted to such a degree in this sub ? 
  i 've said it before . 
  almost all of the stuff he posts is bordering on concern-trolling . 
   first-hand source : yanis varoufakis , who in his books `` and the weak suffer what they must '' and `` adults in the room !, 
  documents his experiences in office , and analysis of events leading up the 2011/12 bailouts . 
  in particular varoufakis describes in detail how the italian president ( himself an enthusiastic eu supporter ) partly orchestrated the ousting of berlusconi . 
  first off , varoufakis , from what i know was n't vehemently against austerity measures . 
  he was against prolonging them more than was needed . 
  not to mention that he came to office as finance minister ** in 2015 ** - well after the people you 're talking about left - and was part of a typical recession period govt . 
  of the `` look how bad these people imposing harsh but needed austerity measures are '' - type . 
  basically low-effort populists . 
  so , no surprise that someone under tsipras would say these things in order to flare up the anti-eu sentiment . 
  in greece 's case , papademos was an economist technocrat put in place because who else would you put in after the shitstorm that 2009 started ? 
  an imbecile populist who will promise anything and fuck the country over even much ? 
  give in to the will of the people - who did indeed suffer - but damn generations to come because you ca n't see past the now ? 
  yet again , i fail to see how this is eu 's fault . 
  the fact that greece amassed such a huge debt is eu 's fault ? 
  the fact that hard economic measures had to be taken to assure that greece does n't fuck itself over even more was eu 's fault ? 
  yet again , you 're knee deep in your conspiracy eurosceptic bullshit . 
  also , i do n't want to get ahead of myself again , but did i just sense sympathy for that berlusconi rat from you ? 
  berlusconi was corruption in human form . 
  if you want to get all `` xxx1984.big _ brother .1984 xxx '' on something , try that . 
   second-hand source : james hatfield 's `` the european union and the end of politics '' , which describes the imposition of monti and papandemos as coups . 
  the continuing journalism of ambrose evans-pritchard , who also calls these events in italian and greek history as coups in a lot of his articles going back several years . 
  yet again , you do not understand how pm proposals work . 
  clear as day . 
  the fact that someone says something to sell a book/make his article interesting does n't make it true . 
  if you think that papademos and monti are `` coups '' then really , nothing much to say here as i 'm clearly wasting my time . 
  it 's like saying theresa may was `` put in power by the unseen hands of the conservative party '' because she was not directly elected . 
  stupid , stupid argument . 
   i 'm talking about people who redirect people talking shit about kkk/nazis with `` but antifa !! '', 
  which is * exactly * what u/hippiehoppe does on the reg , on multiple occasions , including in a debate with me . 
  yet somehow he gets upvoted for this in this sub of all places . 
  you 're both sort of right . 
  though , to be fair , i lean more to u/ivandelapena 's view on sam because the context of his views overall indicate that he 'd be `` the kind of guy to think that way '' . 
   i 'm glad to see you 're coming round to the idea that these impositions were utterly undemocratic though . 
  you 're really cute , unfortunately you have very little idea of what you 're talking about , at least in this specific case . 
  but hey , anything works for a eurosceptic nut , i guess . 
   the lack of a eurozone trade surplus recycling mechanism forces the manifestation of structural trade surpluses as trade deficits in poorer nations which are funded by lines of credit offered by the surplus nations . 
  debtor forgiveness is a fundamental part of the risk/reward calculation of money lending , butgerman bondholders were able to protect their investments from risk by staging a coup of democratically elected governments to avoid facing defaults on their balance sheets . 
  there it is !, 
  greece has no fault for ** its own damn fucking debt ** and it was these sneaky eu illuminati bankers all along !, 
  let me write up this cute assumption to back it up !, 
   ... and it was up to the italians to oust him , not the eurogroup . 
  and that did n't happen - as the eurogroup did n't do that - but you 'll get a kick out of the eurosceptic conspiracy tune anyway so what the heck . 
   how was papademos made pm ? 
  by mandate from greece 's party leaders and recommendation by the greek president karolos papoulias who also brokered the talks with the parties . 
  so basically via both points that you mentioned . 
  looks like the_donald got triggered , huge influx of comments inna matter if minutes bitching the `` but actually '' tune . 
  glorious !, 
  keep trying though , surely generation z will be conservative and nationalist !, 
  it has to be !, 
  no it 's not . 
  from your post history, 
  [ but guise we only care about the illegals !, 
  ] ( https://oauth.reddit.com/r/murica/comments/6y0wxq/foo/dmki3km ), 
  where in my post history do i call a legal resident of my country `` disgusting '' . 
  sure i 'll call a genocide apologist an inbred hick from time to time but that 's it . 
  we need to go deeper . 
  he 's the alt-righter you speak of . 
  it just keeps getting better and better . 
  first 64bit now this . 
  fix the ai and you can do no wrong .
