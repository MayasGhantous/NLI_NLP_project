  geeze ... sorry , i just ca n't even ... provide any feedback . 
  it 's a modern port city in russia and also the main office of lesta , the actual devs that work with wargaming on wows . 
  ok , what the hell , i have the same thing . 
  have you skinned/modded the texas ? 
  i think it 's because of majorrenegade 's no fog mod . 
  prolly have to wait until it is updated . 
  it also screwed up my custom ports : : <, 
  will this also give emden its correct imperial german flag as in previous versions ? 
  or y' all social types are so damn low on self esteem that you get offended when someone does n't want to reply to your mindless ongoing babel . . 
  says how he made it at his job based on how he socially worked up the ladder . 
  `` i care about what people think '' . . , you 're funny . 
  listen , people are n't your damn mother or grandmother put on earth to make you feel good by replying to your shitty smalltalk . 
  if you have any interest in talking , then make it meaningful , if not grow a pair , do n't be so easily offended and realize people are n't here to give you your daily ego tickle . 
  i 'm starting to see a trend here , we 're all cretins , you 're amazing and in no way are you a spoiled 5 year old who ca n't stomach the fact that there are people on this earth who do not enjoy your company . 
  i actually think we were talking about different things . 
  me - i do n't enjoy meaningless smalltalk and find it kind of offensive ( you 're not willing to put in effort into coming up with something to talk and you get angry b/c i do n't want to participate ), 
  you - hate self centered people who do not take responsibility for anything and get people in trouble as a consequence . 
  my point being , even in a workplace , socially passive people do not = lazy , self centered . 
  as long as you 're not telling people to piss off , and you do your job as is required of you then i do n't care if you 're fucking mute . 
  actually , if you were working for me , trying to `` work me up '' and being social just to see what you can get out of me or to get noticed , would be a very good way to make sure you never get promoted . 
  this one 's good . 
  i like this one . 
  since i know very little about ww1 ships , which would the 3 accurately portrayed ships be ? 
  thanks !, 
  it 's crappy but it is what it is . 
  i have the same feeling but with the ww2 ships ( hipper 's aa guns , new mexico 's turrets ... ) . 
  unfortunately , we 're the minority in the wows community . 
  unrelated , but thanks so much for reviving your flag mod . 
  the imperial german navy flag is back in time for the ww1 bbs !, 
  the price of a very decent and high quality game on steam for a ship that does n't , in the traditional sense , fit in a dlc for most games is reasonable ? 
  i know what you mean , but maybe you should have worded it differently . 
  could n't have said it better : , 
  whoa , the kids really have been let loose in this thread !, 
  not 100 % sure , but i think it 's the fourfourtwo stats app . 
  did you also paint her in overall ocean grey or am i seeing things ? 
  measure 14 ? 
  d : you are amazing , thank you !, 
  if i try forcing anything through my vid card soft ( amd ) my gui disappears , lol . 
  you are an absolute retard . 
  that is all . 
  hope you choke on your borsch . 
  might want to add that this is a screenshot from a game , and not an actual picture from the '40s , lol . 
  sorry to hijack but old thread is old ... 
  have you updated your marvelous port free-cam mod ? 
  or for that matter , found a way to make it not freeze the ui ? 
  thanks !, 
  any canvas/cloth on usn ships in ww2 was to be painted with something resembling `` deck blue '' , not black . 
  if you also want accuracy you 'll need counter-shading on the 5 '' and main guns also with deck blue . 
  ... and of course , a campaign in which you 'll probably need to glue yourself to the monitor/chair just to get half of it done . 
  lel to people who imagine that this ship will be `` free '' . 
  whatever amount of money you 're saving , you 'll pay its triple equivalent in time spent . 
  gimmie moar of those `` kill x ships '' missions !, 
  it could be a single battle per day . 
  the `` kill x number or y type of ship '' are just absolute shite . 
  i ignore them instantly . 
  you mean in comparison to 6-time draft-dodger donald ? 
  mccain of all people is the spineless coward ? 
  disclaimer : i 'd also be a draft dodger if put in the same situation . 
  am just stating facts . 
  like trump was a pathetic whining crybaby loser when obama won ? 
  you absolute joke , lmao, 
  be a shame if all you trumpettes get reminded that this kind of `` blabla popular vote is ours '' `` sore loser '' talk is the exact same talk trump used in the past before he became president . 
  case in point : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/uss_michigan_bb_27_collapsed_cage_foremast.jpg/640px-uss_michigan_bb_27_collapsed_cage_foremast.jpg, 
  you do n't understand . 
  you 're on reddit , being the edgy `` i am actually an adult and not disagreeing with you because your opinion is mainstream '' is the name of the game . 
  same garbage as in the cases when something genuinely funny/interesting gets posted and it gets downvoted to oblivion because `` wow , i already know this and therefore everyone else should . 
  love how the fact that one guy got needlessly bashed totally cancels out the mindbending shite wg has done up until now . 
  but hey , did n't you hear ? 
  calling out wg ( not sub ) on their shit makes us autistic says one 400 lbs redditor above . 
  suggestion : increase their transparency a tad , that will make them blend in just right . 
  it 's based on the one used by the molotov cruiser https://worldofwarships-na.gcdn.co/dcont/fb/image/tmb/01de1a88-1edb-11e6-ba4a-d89d6715223c_660x.jpg, 
  not if you use zfirewyvern 's mod . 
  bless the lad , 
  it 's the service.lib file from every update of his . 
  do not use old ones b/c sometimes it freezes on the first loading screen . 
  thanks again for your work !, 
  so , from what i read multiple govt . 
  agencies , not only us , canada as well signed off on this sale . 
  guess evil `` adolf '' hillary 's influence is stronger than us and canada combined . 
  that lost the popular vote ... to hillary !, 
  yeah man , but like , you do n't get it . 
  mainstream opinion is `` wg eu missions are shit '' -- and rightfully so , the missions contradict the company 's own ideology of `` teamplay first '' . 
  when the mainstream hate wave has been riding for a while it 's time to become `` the voice of reason '' and contradict the masses with my flawless logic . 
  `` wg eu is doing everything for you undeserving sheeple ! '' . 
  even if it 's baseless , since most missions spewed forth by them range from cancer to borderline-cancer , there has to be those two , three shmucks who go on how everyone is a spoiled brat and the missions are `` reasonable '' . 
  it 's almost as if that r/whitebeauty fucktard does n't realize that he finds the white race the most beautiful in the world because he is white . 
  heavens forbid that other races take pride in themselves . 
  he ca n't see past his own existence that it 's the exact same thing for black people thinking the black race is the most beautiful etc etc. 
  not to mention that there are people that find people out of their own race attractive and such . 
  pshaw , what do i know , he 's just special man , he has a view of the world that we just do not understand - he just a special little boy . 
  and this is coming from someone who thinks ( partially ) like him/her/it - i just find white females attractive b/c that 's what naturally comes to me , not b/c i think other races are not beautiful or the like . 
  but nooo , this shmuck has to go the extra mile . 
  why , you a real revolutionary thinker son ... 
  he lost the popular vote to ... clinton whom , at the time , was targeted by an intentional leak that hit her electability pretty hard . 
  also add to that the fact that a considerable leftist voter chunk , the youth , did not go out to vote in as many numbers as they * should * have . 
  even so this nitwit lost by almost 3 million , bigly-est margin ever , let me tell you ... against a weak candidate . 
  sure feels like a great win when the * majority * voted against you . 
  to preempt the typical response to this : `` well , how would you want it to be , california always getting to choose who 's going to be president ? '', 
  - well , you know , that 's how it works , the majority usually decides . 
  what are you talking about ?
