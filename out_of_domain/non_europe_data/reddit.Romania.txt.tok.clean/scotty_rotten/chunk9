   people from foreign backgrounds are suspected of crimes more often than people from a swedish background . 
  according to the most recent study , people from foreign backgrounds are 2.5 times more likely to be suspected of crimes than people born in sweden to swedish-born parents . 
  in a later study , researchers at stockholm university showed that the main difference in terms of criminal activity between immigrants and others in the population was due to differences in the socioeconomic conditions in which they grew up in sweden . 
  this means factors such as parents ' incomes , and the social circumstances in the area in which an individual grew up . 
   swedish government agencies have nothing to gain from covering up statistics and facts ; they seek an open and fact-based dialogue . 
  sweden is an open society governed by a principle of public access to official documents . 
  this means that members of the public , e.g. 
  private individuals and media representatives , have the right to insight into and access to information about the activities of central and local government . 
  to be noted , from the little i know , there is a difference between being suspected and actually convicted of something . 
   [ ... ] you would know that socioeconomic failures , language barriers , and ghettoization , are already factors in my equation . 
  you bring in people that are less civilized ? 
  you get less civilized responses and outcomes , you bring in poor people , you get a higher chance of crime , you bring in people from countries where they already do n't respect women , it will bring itself here . 
  * if sweden ca n't provide a middle class house , and lifestyle for the immigrants , then of course they 're going to fall behind the rest of the native population that 's been there longer . 
  so , following your logic , the us should start rounding up the `` socioeconomic failures '' that can be found aplenty in trailer parks asap . 
  would n't want those people to drag down the hard working regular joe , right ? 
  i 'm sorry , but your logic is flawed if you think poor , uneducated = irreversibly bad in most cases . 
  at best you have a solid argument for the rifts between lower and middle classes being too big , not against migration . 
  this [ guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/timcasts/videos ) might be independent but he 's sure as shit not a `` journalist '' , even if you use it as an umbrella term . 
  he 's a right wing -- sprinkle a bit of far-right here and there -- opinion peddler . 
  just a quick selection of his video titles : * `` hackers vs sjws in the cultural civil war '' * , * `` the french revolt against macron '' * , * `` new york times is fake news ?!, 
  '' * , * `` getting red pilled , the end of sjw 's ? 
  '' * , * `` hillary 's health is a serious issue '' * < - last one being posted during the cute little `` hillary is unfit to be president '' election propaganda wave -- but [ golf cart ridin ' , fat donald ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-golf-cart-g7-sicily-2017-5 ) at an international meeting is a-ok . 
  also , [ here 's ] ( https://www.thelocal.se/20170301/police-told-me-to-leave-rinkeby-us-journalist-tim-pool ) a funny little article about that * exact * event you mentioned , reported on by an independent newspaper/site , not the government , since you have problems with that term -- well , except when that government is republican . 
  and would you look at that , it seems your `` journalist '' used some shady tactics to arrange stuff to suit the narrative , how suprising . 
  but yeah , the government is the one that 's been cought `` obfuscating facts '' and `` watering down '' . 
  an instutition with * probably * hundreds of people working there ... they 're all in it to kill their own people . 
  if you actually care about `` no-go zones '' , about the truth behind these videos that you 're posting , then you would like [ actual people that live in one of these no go zones , filmed on location ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflf6to7vsa ) . 
  yet again , i think it paints a pretty damning picture of the typical misinformation campaign the far right is pushing . 
   no , they do n't fucking discredit anything . 
  yes , they * do * . 
  more so when all you have to offer is just your interpretation of things , whilst under the influence of heavy misinformation campaigns , to counter actual people who actually live there , the authorities responsible , etc. 
  and back up your interpretations with biased as shit sources . 
  you :, 
   why would i want `` official '' statistics when the police are apart of the government , and are n't allowed to be truthful or real about the situation . 
  also you :, 
   not only this , but your `` suspicion '' thing does n't really hold true when you look at one of the very statistics you posted being, 
   ** official report by swedish police representatives -  ** 123 incidents of sexual molestation in the country 's public baths and pools in 2015 ( 112 of them were directed against girls ) . 
  in 55 % of cases , the perpetrator could be reasonably identified . 
  from these identified perpetrators , 80 % were of foreign origin . 
  so , which is it ? 
  are the swedish police lying through their teeth , hiding the truth from these poor sheep or are they `` woke '' ? 
  are they allowed to speak the truth or not ? 
  oh , wait , i know this one ... this is just that one poor soul who managed to get the truth out through the grips of his tyrannical employer !!!, 
  please take a look at the link i gave you in the previous post . 
  it clearly says that the crime wave overall has been * largely the same * ( in 2015 ) as * before the migrant wave * ( 2005 ) , with only a * slight increase * , which can be * mirrored in other countries that did not take in any migrants * . 
  what utter trash . 
  because , did n't you know , all `` progressives '' and all `` do gooders '' are just social media attention whores . 
  what a whiny , teenage , aimless rant piece . 
  look at his post history . 
  more so on the one post about [ `` progressives '' ] ( https://reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/6ov722/serious_is_anyone_here_an_exsjw_what_changed_your/dkkjppy ) . 
  in his simple mind most of these people are `` doing it for the social media likes '' . 
  he 's full of it . 
  see below , the post by u/philitian . 
  i could n't have given a better answer myself . 
  and of course your reasonable reply will never ever be anywhere visible , buried under the usual noise . 
  though , as others have said , plenty trans people are currently serving . 
  what happens to them ? 
  `` sorry , you 're no longer considered acceptable ! '', 
  also , not to mention , this seems to be the job for something like recruiter `` panels '' of psych and medical specialists . 
  why did it require a post on the official potus account ? 
  you were making sense up until you said `` pc tyrants '' . 
  so i guess people * can * be silly and say useful stuff at the same time . 
  yup . 
  funny guy . 
  then there is [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf-mhggwigk ) . 
  even [ better ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflf6to7vsa ) . 
  spinning the truth to paint a particular picture , as cnn does some times , is n't as bad as actually making inexistent shit up . 
  i mean , in the first example there is at least a semblence of truth whilst in the latter there 's just plain , `` with a smile on my face '' lying . 
  i actually wanted to delete my reply b/c i thought i might have misunderstood your post within the given context . 
  now i 'm even more confused . 
  lmao , what a steaming pile of horseshit . 
  you missed some [ good ] ( https://oauth.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/6q1uyi/foo/dktyh91 ) [ ones ] ( https://oauth.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/6q1uyi/foo/dktz7jb ) . 
  why do you glance over the fact that this should have been addressed as a `` refusal to finance the medical bills with tax payer/military money '' then ? 
  instead of a half-assed , braindead blanket ban a la `` no trans in the military , sorry '' . 
  more so is it the case when you can meet the same requirements as everyone else , after your own , self paid sex change and you can prove that you are able to function normally . 
  edit :, 
   you have been banned from participating in r/rightwinglgbt . 
  you can still view and subscribe to r/rightwinglgbt , but you wo n't be able to post or comment . 
  how lovely . 
  this post brought to you by the same idiot who posted `` obama created isis '' on the_donald . 
  you sure you did n't get obummer mixed up with dubbyah ? 
  the guy who created the iraq mess based on a lie ? 
  aaaand getting back on topic . 
  you 're a cute little asshole who refuses to acknowledge that the problem lies in the government funding what some consider , rightfully or not , a plastic surgery and more than that , a personal choice . 
  trans people , post op , who can meet the standards and function should be able to serve like everyone else . 
  edit : repost and editing out the sub link . 
  tell us something about the cultural marxism . 
  come on man , i ca n't deus vult without the full list of retard-right buzzwords . 
  his words , not mine !, 
  thought so too , but what 's that small bit under the belly of the aircraft ? 
  seems like the external fuel tank pod ? 
  a bit kind of thick and protruding too much i think . 
  yes , yes , enough of this hogwash . 
  i need to get pumped , fellow pede .
