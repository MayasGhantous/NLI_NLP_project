  it 's made on adobe after effects !,

  the actual problem is saving the gif , i tried saving a few different types of . gifs and this was the `` best '' looking one in terms of quality, 
  you can take a look at my profile if you want and add me if you 're interested , 
  nice one , you could 've directly post your profile tough, 
  oh allright , fair enough !, 
  love it :d,

  i wonder how did you make all the gifs to start at the same time ? 
  really original , good job !,

  i never heard of dota back in the days , i was actually playing team fortress 2 all day , trading and stuff and on this website called tf2outpost.com everyone started to sell dota 2 keys , so i thought i could give it a shot , bought a copy for 5 keys and started playing ^ ^, 
  ^ then ^ a ^ few ^ weeks ^ later ^ i ^ recived ^ a ^ fuckton ^ of ^ keys ^ from ^ steam ^ as ^ everyone ^ else . . ^ feelsbadman, 
  absolutely , i 'd love to see this, 
  i agree , but maybe a simple `` 1 '' in the notification mail icon on top right will be enough ^ lul, 
  i said i 'm not crying !!, 
  :d ^ pls, 
  well , i guess so , here in italy these things go for 250-300 $ , i 'm waiting for a good sale to buy one honestly ... 
  you should feel old . 
  in my case since i never had the original wii , picking up a wii u would also be a good chance to play all the great games that i never got to play , actually i hope the nintendo nx will make the wii u drop in price really bad !, 
  what a time to be alive, 
  yep . 
  feelsbadman, 
  feelsbadman,

  what are you even talking about dude ? 
  did you see the swag this guy had ? 
  he probably gets all the pussy !, 
  best title ever, 
  just because his first game it 's in 2013 does n't mean he 's playing since then, 
  yeah man i feel you , it 's either you win every game or lose them all in a row . . 
  bad company 2 feelsbadman good times, 
  maybe it was n't better , but it had more character for sure, 
  i always wanted to try it !, 
  cause my teammates ca n't carry, 
  i agree . 
  that random ending is the best, 
  pretty cool , maybe the gif could be a bit longer , but good job !, 
  also i love the background spinning , nice touch, 
  i get 15 fps in the picking screen , usually it 's 90-110 . 
  anyone else ? 
  what the fuck is this, 
  tf2 did everything better ^ feels ^ bad ^ man,
