  world war 3 . 
  i do n't know dude , i had fun while playing it , did n't feel it was like how you described it, 
  i could n't agree more , what i 'm trying to say is that imo the guys at dice did an awesome job with the game , but it 's ea fault if you need the season pass to enjoy 100 % of the experience, 
  i need to keep that in mind more often,
