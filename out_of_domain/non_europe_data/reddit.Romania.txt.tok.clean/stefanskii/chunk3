  i 'm curious about the costs, 
  nice thanks , i guess if you have got the money for it it 's totally worth it . 
  yeah i have a friend who plays since his first game at around 11 ~ frames , i think with a decent computer he would rank up no problem as he sits at a pretty low mmr, 
  next level efficiency actually,
