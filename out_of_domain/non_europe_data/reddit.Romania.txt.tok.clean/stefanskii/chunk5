  this is amazing , thanks op . 
  welcome to the civilized world !, 
  dude that happens to me every time ... and i 'm using fiber and shit ( and it better not be the modem cause i 'm paying that isp shit modem 180 $ when the exact same model goes for 40-50 $ on amazon ), 
  i love art academy , really chill game, 
  this update actually means a lot . 
  was looking for this , thank you !, 
  understandable have a good day, 
   trust no one , even yourself, 
  not sure about that, 
  '' * not this shit again * '', 
  god damnit i was just looking to buy a 580 this week and could n't find * anything * in any site , that 's a shame, 
  restock should happen in a few weeks here , but i 'm sure they 'll be sold out again or something, 
  valve time ? 
  now this needs to be in the tips during the loading screens ^ ( if they 're still a thing ), 
  1070 if you can afford it or rx 580 if you can find one !, 
  that 's pretty cool , it 's this more of a typing keyboard or it 's perfect for gaming as well ? 
  overwatch is really fun and well made overall , but the community is full of crybabies . 
  overcooked is a fun one , i think it 's like for 2 to 4 players , so you can have also a few friends join if you want, 
  yea , real funny m8 :-d, 
  i mean , they 'll probably remove the current ones and add new sounds next pass, 
  is n't it the same publisher ? 
  i feel u dude , waiting for a new gpu too , hurry up amazon !, 
  i dunno on my cellphone it 's still slow as f ^ ^ ^ feelsbadman, 
  ahh . . such memories ^ ^ ^ ^ ** and ** ^ ^ ^ ^ ** mostly ** ^ ^ ^ ^ ** hats **, 
  trump highlights feelsgoodman, 
  yea boii, 
  in soviet russia . . 
  rate 8/8 great game m8 seemsgood, 
  this is genius, 
  fresh stuff i see, 
  that sounds so much better !, 
  https://steamdb.info/app/374320/ , steam database says the lowest recorded price on ds3 was $ 29.99 at -50 % , so i guess you could expect that amount or even less on the upcoming steam sale , should start soon i hope !, 
  `` pigs '' in the background is just perfect . 
  wow thanks for sharing the video !, 
  i ca n't play that game , wich is one of my top time favourites , because of game for windows live , i hate that . 
  i do n't know dude , tried to play the game a few days ago and windows live thing was still there , could n't login even with the correct infos ecc . . do i have to download the patch somewhere ? 
  never heard of it :0, 
  allright , thanks man , i 'll defenitely check this out next time i 'll want to play gta 4 again .

  791 , thanks op !,

  thanks buddy . 
  i mean a 1060 it 's not bad , i just bought a asus 1060 6 gb 'cause i could n't find any rx cards around , and it 's doing a really nice job , the only thing holding it back it 's my old processor , if not could do any game at ultra 60 fps, 
  you might want to center your primary monitor if you do n't want any neck problems :d, 
  do you guys know if there 's a way to check your current quests ? 
  gl everyone :d, 
  13000 , thanks op .

  rude, 
  dude i swear everytime i queque after midnight the game minimum duration is 1:20 hrs, 
  every time i was playing new leaf in the mornings and it was raining , i swear it started raining outside too later in the day !, 
  it was like some sort of weather forecast :p, 
  yes !, 
  . . wait i do n't have one, 
  rrrrrrraull, 
  that room is so cool :0, 
  record it, 
  coolio, 
  yeah i ca n't stand that for 2 seconds, 
  3 is madness !, 
  yeah this was a feelsbadman moment for everyone playing this game at first i guess, 
  so how does it work , they reveal a card every now and then or all of them at the same time ? 
  10/10 caption,

  i think they `` mate '' everyone, 
  i 'm not even mad, 
  no , so dota . 
  welcome aboard !, 
  definitely switch , the wii u is great but it 's not worth it anymore , unless you got more money to spend and want to collect you might get a deal for it some day !,
