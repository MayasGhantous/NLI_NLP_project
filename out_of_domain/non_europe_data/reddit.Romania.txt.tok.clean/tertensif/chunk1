  what hinted towards ratatorsk patch notes coming today was the patch spoils which they did last friday where bart said they 'll try to do spoils one week before each patch . 
  you can see i totaly expected that xd, 
  he 's black !, 
  truth is , when i turned around , i did n't notice everybody was dead , so i was n't expecting anything more than a triple out of that ult , that 's why i was shocked when i just heard `` penta kill '', 
  362 [ thank you and good luck to everyone ] ( https://steamcommunity.com/tradeoffer/new/?partner=78443398&amp;token=hnwehlxj ),

  any ... 
  i do n't care which one i just want to have 1 skin cause the noly one i have currently is army sheen nagev, 
  so is this starting tomorrow for us ? 
  i played games today and won most of my first wins so when is this starting for me ? 
  ` dusa vp , batz vp and chang ' e recolor is what i 've allways wanted, 
  perfect ... 
  i even got the vp and space monkey for the dude from a chest ... 
  still ca n't manage to go positive with him, 
  well do n't think you 'll be able to get 70 codes but yeah ... wo n't mind one, 
  holy shit will there be an e30 in the new need for speed ? 
  i just came, 
  voted split and i still got no fp ... why ? 
  the only thing i hate about loki is the fear he got into all of us . 
  that fear that is triggered when you hear his 3 . 
  it 's so strong that sometimes if you 've played against a loki the match before , you 'll hear his 3 even if he 's not in that game . 
  dude is creepy, 
  i thought i 'd give this a try . 
  been on a winning streak since . 
  for some reason it makes me focus and keep calm . 
  really weird but weirdly usefull tip . 
  i do n't think you got it . 
  i 'm not trying to deal with the bm . 
  i am the bm . 
  yeah probably . 
  i 'll try playing on na servers maybe i can learn their ways . 
  actually i do get angry at myself when i make a mistake . 
  but yeah i 'll try taking it less serious from now on . 
  he 's only being the next cabrakan because he 's going to be very weak at launch and probably will get buffed until he 's decent . 
  guan fu , sun 's bride and soultaker . 
  i really wish cog wins the second game too , without any dc 's so c9 fanboys can cry a bit more . 
  it will be a seige, 
  build ymir like that and get hit by a fully charged ult . 
  you 'll see why he 's okay . 
  with that build he 'll go down in max 3 seconds . 
  i know i 'm rank 3 on xing . 
  he does a shit ton of damage if you build him full glass canon , but at the same time you need to be good to last more than 3 seconds in a team fight with that build, 
  with that build any late game mage can kill you in the duration it takes to get your 2 off . 
  ymir can deal a shit ton of damage without being built glass canon ( 1100 base damage on the ult just saying ) . 
  you said it 's too much damage for a guardian . 
  it 's actually not at all too much , because you 'll never last enough to deal that damage with that build . 
  plus beads mitigates 75 % of the damage his ult does . 
  then a bit of kali . 
  and then fenrir came out . 
  fenrir, 
  ra ( back when you had to get 100 worshipers , those were the times ), 
  every time i see a planetside 2 post i think about how awesome a ps2 like game set in the world war 2 age would be, 
  if you camp him he has no chance, 
  dread queen , shaolin monk-ey , box cat and screaming mouth, 
  if he says '' ` tis but a scratch '' when low on health i 'll ship my wallet to hi-rez, 
  / u/f-dot i 'd say you 'd be pretty op, 
  xing probably , got him in a weekend . 
  if i hear `` why you mad about geb adc it 's just casual '' one more time i 'm gon na probably get banned . 
  it just sucks . 
  ! remindme 3 days, 
  it just plainly sucks . 
  i really hope it 's some kind of sick joke . 
  if it 's not my wallet would be happy at least . 
  that 's one of the problems . 
  the fact that the skin concept is just horrible is what 's making me not even think about buying the odyssey now . 
  thanks, 
  you do n't . 
  so i 've tried meeting hancock as part of the silver shroud mission and encountered a bug . 
  he keeps yapping about me killing bobbi , which i already did . 
  i refused when he asked to be my companion and now there 's no dialogue options when i try to talk to him . 
  someone told me to make him my companion , but i do n't see how i can do that since the dude wo n't shut up about the `` gangland-style murder he was promised '' . 
  killing floor plz < 3, 
  edit : sau mark of the ninja . 
  am i the only one that thinks this mode is in no way good or needed ? 
  like it 's 100 % a worse version of siege . 
  i 'd say just remove it from the game and focus on something else .
