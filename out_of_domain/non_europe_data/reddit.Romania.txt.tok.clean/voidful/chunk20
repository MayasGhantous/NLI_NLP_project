  but this , this was more . 
  earth is nothing , she is much more less than nothing . 
  a sick feeling of disgust trailed up her spine , stopping in her throat and stopped there . 
  but then she realised that she , she was thinking . 
  analysing her own self , her own situation , her own insignificance . 
  but she is alive , and more important , self aware . 
  she is there , floating in nothing , close to a big round unimportant rock thinking . 
  thinking about her own thoughts . 
  the image of her walking towards the space craft spawned inside her mind . 
  walking , on two legs towards that big pile of metal flanked by two immense fuel tanks which was supposed to propel her and the crue off the round rock without blowing to pieces to fix another big pile of metal because one engineer messed up a piece of data . 
  this is not nothing , she thought . 
  but this is not all either . 
  there 's much more to come . 
  much more than i can even comprehend or experience in the years i have left . 
  she smiles , turning her body facing the station . 
  `` heading towards the hatch , time to go back home . '', 
  this is spectacular . 
  the trial, 
  by kafka, 
  you must experience kafka at least once in your reading ventures . 
  the good soldier \u0160vejk, 
  pure fun to read . 
  i love and hate kafka 's surrealism . 
  i loathe and adore at the same time that type of writing to the point i feel sick in the stomach but ca n't stop reading it and i just want more and more . 
  the ending was perfect for the style and purpose of that novel , loved every bit of it . 
  i did n't say that the trial is kafka 's greatest work , but it is a great introduction to his unique style . 
  i too enjoyed the castle immensely , and felt that it is better than the trial . 
  that does n't mean that the trial is n't amazing . 
  that was an onesie . 
  and it appears that he tucked in . 
  priceless . 
  relevant user name and all !, 
  friend of mine got scammed in a similar way . 
  some dude came up to him on the street , asking him if he wants to but a phone . 
  as he got interested , the guy pulled out a phone , in a perfect state , all working and stuff . 
  he asked about $ 90 , and that phone was worth over $ 200 . 
  so my friend accepts , pays and happily goes home with his new phone . 
  then he realised that what he got was an identical case filled with play dough , and a piece of grey fabric on the screen to make it look like it 's shut down / on standby . 
  the scammer did the switch extremely quick with the case in his pocket when taking the money . 
  to pull it through he made it so that he seemed in a hurry and in need of money . 
  damn wind in my eyes . 
  m-am gresit in exprimare . 
  etnia e complet irelevanta . 
  de pe [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/android_\\ ( operating_system \\ ) ) :, 
   android is open source and google releases the source code under the apache license . 
  [ 12 ] this open-source code and permissive licensing allows the software to be freely modified and distributed by device manufacturers , wireless carriers and enthusiast developers . 
  in practice , android devices ship with a combination of open source and proprietary software . 
  cred ca m-am exprimat prost , nu am idee in ce masura apache licence permite introducerea in codul original si open source de cod closed source , dar permite software closed . 
  de pe [android.com ] ( http://source.android.com/source/licenses.html ) :, 
   the preferred license for the android open source project is the apache software license , version 2.0 ( `` apache 2.0 '' ) , and the majority of the android software is licensed with apache 2.0 . 
  while the project will strive to adhere to the preferred license , there may be exceptions that will be handled on a case-by-case basis . 
  for example , the linux kernel patches are under the gplv2 license with system exceptions , which can be found on kernel.org .

  newell is technical minded ; he wants to keep things moving forward , while still making money . 
  he always tries to find balance between keeping customers as happy as possible and making good money , and he is intelligent enough to do it . 
  yes he did . 
  for canonical it is a bit harder to become profitable fast , because they are not selling anything directly . 
  so becoming profitable while keeping the users happy would be a slow process , and shuttleworth seems tired of waiting . 
  dat muscle memory !, 
  as long as he as russian support and he supports russia , they will fund him enough to fix the votes .

  i also have l4d2 intalled , did n't play it much . 
  crunchbang linux in dualboot cu windows 7 . 
  specificatiile aparatului sunt slabute si windows 7 in virtual box e ridicol de incet , asa ca nu are rost sa ma chinui cu asta acum . 
  many people go there to work on contracts . 
  wages are pretty high compared to the poorer parts of europe . 
  and apparently they are looking to hire eastern european women quite intensely . 
  yupp . 
  it 's a bit ironic that now you can go there and earn 2000 - 3000 euro / month . 
  and they do actually pay . 
  but of course , you have to abide those sketchy laws .

  to get your debian up and running with functionality , use [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kuo6s-_2yk ) guide ; this is centered on debian a lot , you 'll learn a lot , there are more videos on how to get specific stuff done on a debian system . 
  i am on playonlinux 4.2.1 currently . 
  the pvp.net client shop does crash it yes , but the games runs fine , with a couple of more or less minor bugs : some items in the in-game shop do n't have icons , and the shop in the aram game mode has the ui messed up , but usable . 
  if you want to play lol , be sure to have the latest version of pol installed when you install lol . 
  you can get that from the play on linux website . 
  the one in the repositories is old . 
  you 're welcome . 
  just get the latest playonlinux from their website , and after you get that , click on install in pol , be sure to have `` testing '' selected and search for league of legends . 
  just install that and that 's all . 
  it 's just a matter of following instructions and pressing `` next '' . 
  very simple and head-ache free . 
  he 's 90 years old , probably a bit or more senile as well . 
  he 'll be over soon . 
  hopefully they 'll manage to get most of his money away from him . 
  other punishment is not really relevant in his case . 
  he 's old and on his way out . 
  in principiu , da . 
  the jackie chan preaching about the greatness of communism is probably enforced by the chinese government . 
  communist governments around the world always practiced this method . 
  they basically approach a famous likable person and tell them to say certain things or to participate on certain events , or else something not very nice will happen to you or your family . 
  a guy fixing his bike stumbles upon an unexpected and unsettling truth ... 
  fair enough . 
  living in an ex communist country . 
  many people here who were famous during communism were forced to do this as well . 
  also average people had to participate in all sort of events in which you were praising the greatness of the communist party . 
  and if you said something which you should n't about the party and the wrong ears were listening , you got in jail or worse . 
  when a citizen of a communist country says something positive about that country , do n't think that he / she actually means it , it 's said out of fear .
