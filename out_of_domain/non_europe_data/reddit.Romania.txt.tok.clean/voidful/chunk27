  he stood there , watching above , at the dark skies , smelling the air , feeling the water flowing under his feet . 
  he dips the lower end of his staff in the water , looks up and waits for a lightning to hit his staff , which happens shortly . 
  `` here i am now to claim my right ! '', 
  he yelled , with a surprising passive look on his face , looking straight forward . 
  after a short period of wait , a man and a woman emerge from the water , swimming , looking up at the old man . 
  `` you are indeed here '' the woman said , angered . 
  `` you have no power over us , old man . '', 
  `` i have called you , and you did come . 
  i am here , walking on and above the filthy waters you call home , atlantians . 
  here i am , standing above you all !, 
  i can destroy you all with a simple thought , or make you suffer in horrid ways . 
  but i shall do neither . 
  all i want is what is rightfully mine . '', 
  `` you do not own anything which is of ours , you old fool !, 
  be gone and leave our people alone , we do n't owe you anything and we do not wish to give you anything . '' the man said fearfully , but continued with confidence arising in his voice : `` be gone old man , you are not welcomed here , and we shall harm you of you linger for much longer '' . 
  `` harm me ? '' the old lets out a spiteful laughter , looking down at the two young atlantians . 
  the he looks straight down and spits into the water . 
  `` harm me you say ? '', 
  the young atlantian man looks around worried , getting more and more agitated . 
  `` what 's wrong boy ? 
  feeling a bit warm ? '' the old man makes a circle with his staff in the water and the young atlantian starts to swim further away , with his face and forehead getting covered in what appear to be beads of sweat . 
  `` you know what that is ? 
  sweating boy , sweating . 
  it 's a reminder of where you came from !, 
  from where i brought your kind , boy !, 
  i made your kind !, 
  i took you all under my protection when your useless island sunk !, 
  i made you , and i can and will destroy you if i have to !, 
  you think i 'm afraid of your kind ? 
  of your technology , of your advancements ? 
  i have lived through millenias , watched your kind grow and develop , and now i am here for what belongs to me . '', 
  the woman was looking at the old man furiously , while the young man was struggling in increasing agony . 
  `` you wo n't get anything without a fight ! '' , the woman yelled . 
  `` i do n't care about your will or disposition to fight , atlantian . 
  i am here to take what is mine . 
  which is destroying your kind , your civilisation . 
  that was the deal i have made with your forefathers and i will stick to it . 
  about you , your kind , your family , your advancements , your thriving society and your will to continue your existance , i do not care . 
  i shall destroy you all and everything your kind has ever created , crafted or thought . '', 
  the old man started to sink into the ocean . 
  `` fuck you , man !,

  i called heads , and heads it was . 
  `` c'mon , i ca n't do this shit , you 've always been better at the stressful shit than me , you know it .
