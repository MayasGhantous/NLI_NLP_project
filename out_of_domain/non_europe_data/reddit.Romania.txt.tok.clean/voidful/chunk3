  pure agnostic = not knowing if any god exists , and not caring too much about it either . 
  i have no idea if there is any god , and i do n't care . 
  if there is , i 'm pretty sure i 'm gon na find out after i die . 
  also , if there is , it 's obvious that that god does n't want us to be able to find out , at least during our life time . 
  until then , i 'm perfectly fine with not knowing and not being able to know . 
  you 're welcome . 
  [ wiki quote ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apatheism ) : `` apathetic agnosticism ( also called pragmatic agnosticism ) acknowledges that any amount of debate can neither prove , nor disprove , the existence of one or more deities , and if one or more deities exist , they do not appear to be concerned about the fate of humans . 
  therefore , their existence has little to no impact on personal human affairs and should be of little theological interest . 
  apatheists hold that if it were possible to prove that god exists , their behavior would not change . 
  similarly , there would be no change if someone proved that god does not exist . '', 
  i knew it under the name of pure agnostic , but i guess this will do as well . 
  glad to help !, 
  the less you want to know . 
  amazing song !, 
  been on liquid diet due to oral surgery for 6 weeks . 
  had a lot of stuff in a blender and turned into liquid , including meat with all kinds of stuff . 
  quite delicious . 
  only problem with eating through a straw was that after 4 weeks i literally got sick of liquid diet and was disgusted of it . 
  so for two weeks i ate almost nothing . 
  not fun at all . 
  still , meat through blender , as long as it is already part of a semi - liquid meal ( soup , meat with sour cream ) can be really delicious and helpful when you have to stick to feeding yourself through a straw . 
  no , they invented magic . 
  lol . 
  bunch of petmans dressed up in crazy suits doing the harlem shake ... yes please . 
  they are n't but this is a step forward . 
  if you ever want to have super robot soldiers , then you have to work and develop the technology to have super robot soldiers . 
  bd appears to do that as well . 
  true enough , but science does n't state the all there is came into existance out of chance , or from nothingness . 
  science is constantly trying to determine where from and how it all came into existance .

  donahue thinks that today , in 2013 , marriage is n't and should n't be about love . 
  but about having kids , and even if he did n't say it , he was definetly thinking it , about interest . 
  sir , the 18th century wants you back . 
  exact .

  i agree , the fact that it happened at an international competition makes it even more sickening . 
  this makes dolphins jumping through hoops like kindergarten sissy girls . 
  what is srs ? 
  thanks . 
  now the 1k $ question . . are they some species of trolls or actually serious ? 
  so they 're some kind of westboro of reddit .

  uhm , you 're stupid ! '', 
  i know too many people who are like that . 
  awesome sub to get some neat wallpapers !, 
  how does that not take an oscar ? 
  personally i do n't like the crust more than the actual pizza , so i always start with the crust so i can reward myself with the center part . 
  it 's also romanian for `` how '' . 
  as a romanian gaming with other fellow romanians , chatting can get really frustrating when chat blocking is blocked .

  how much ram does it eat bare , at startup ? 
  my netbook has only 1 gb, 
  i still do n't understand how competition in the isp business in the us never took off properly wayyy earlier . 
  in my country , the competition is fierce , they eat each other alive . 
  i live in a medium - ish sized city ( 150 000 people ) and i have 4-5 isp 's available to choose from . 
  this competition not only brought high speed and quality connections faster , but also the prices are ridiculously low . 
  10 - 20 $ per month of medium speed - high speed connections . 
  or something like 5 $ per month for a medium - low connection . 
  same thing goes for digital television , fixed and mobile telephony . 
  competition does provide better services at really low prices . 
  lowest would be 10 mbps ( 1 and a little mbps ) . 
  medium would be 30 - 60 . 
  high 100 - 150 . 
  the over 100 speeds are relatively recent around here . 
  2-3 years . 
  in my city for 1 year . 
  but 60 is something common . 
  dirt cheap also . 
  here neither of the companies had true full monopoly . 
  there are 2 main big ones . 
  one had half of the country , the other the other half . 
  in each town , city , village there were also smaller companies , which had some coverage locally , the big ones were buying the small ones . . expanding . 
  then the natural thing happened . 
  the big ones started invading each other 's territory . 
  and soon enough , 2-3 rather big companies appeared , and also started to gain people . 
  that 's why we have good services and low prices here . 
  one of the reasons for the low prices is also the low wages we have here . 
  50 $ would be the top price acceptable . 
  yes . 
  believe me you do n't . 
  i pay bout 18 $ / month for a pack including fixed telephony ( free calls on all fixed networks in the country after 8 pm , free calls in the fixed network i 'm using at all times ) , digital television , and 20 mbps internet connection ( i do n't really need more at the moment ) . 
  upload is bout 2.5 mbps . 
  my isp seems to have a one eight or one tenth of your download speed policy when it comes to upload speed . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-ick-8jptk ) should be a good start for you . 
  i find her voice quite annoying , but the way she systemized lessons is really good . 
  check out her channel and follow the lessons . 
  i 've been looking for ro lessons for a friend , and for the basics it 's by far the best i could find . 
  also if you know a ro native who can and is willing to help you , that could be of great help . 
  pronounciation is really important . 
  get it wrong , and people will not understand you at all . 
  the `` listen '' thingy on google or some sites might be wrong .
