  i agree , it 's far from a fetish , and from what i understand it is seen more as a mental illness . 
  if mental illness is the case , people should be informed and educated about it , and also sent to a pshychiatrist if any symptoms appear . 
  the psychiatrist should then try to help the individual and determine if he / she is fit to continue living in the society , if it is safe . 
  it should be seen and treated like any other mental illness ( or as a mental illness should be seen and treated - i am aware that many still have heavy stigma ) . 
  interesting take on it . 
  i was saying that we need to get rid of the stigma though , and people who have this attraction should be able to freely seek help and intimately if they need it . 
  some people might not feel in full control of their urges , may want help but they are afraid of being turned in to the police if they do so .

  not really . 
  the eye transmits the information continuously , without any frame rate . 
  or refresh rate . 
  the brain interprets that information in a very specific way , and you ca n't really link it to a certain frame rate , because you have a different `` refresh time '' for various areas you are watching . 
  the object you are focusing on has a very high refresh rate , while the background , everything around the object can have a refresh rate as low as 15 seconds . 
  that lowers the `` processing power '' needed for vision . 
  the way our brains interpret vision is much more complex than the camera -  display duo we are used to in technology . 
  it is a bit similar to how cartoons were / are made , with the characters moving , and the background being just a still image .

  in the countries where gun control is extremely strict , having a gun without a license can get you 5 years . 
  just having it , not using it . 
  this kind of punishment actually works since gun incidents are rare to very rare in those countries . 
  with insomnia and bored at night . 
  that 's how the laws work though . 
  you are right , but the thing is that most people do n't get a gun illegally just to protect themselves . 
  people like that just stick to the law and do n't get a gun in the first place . 
  my point was that in countries where gun control is strict , most robbers do n't have guns either . 
  they may have a knife or other tools . 
  but you can carry pepper spray . 
  i 'm not saying that it 's fair or that its correct one way or another . 
  i 'm just pointing out that in coutries which didnt have lax gun control laws in recent history and practice strict gun control , it works . 
  there is n't a culture of owning a gun for what ever purpose and owning one illegally is seen as dangerous for the owner , so even criminals avoid them . 
  im not saying that this system is superior to the us system , but it works here . 
  story time ? 
  roccat trailers are beyond ridiculous .

  maybe he is peter 's father . 
  he probably hurt himself during the celebration for the goal .

  germans might have some ideas now though . 
  pirlo has a lot of experience . 
  was surprised to see him at the tournament . 
  for a football player , he is old . 
  and probably was classmate with jesus . 
  amazing that he still has such quality of play at his age . 
  they do n't ship to europe :( . 
  i got all pumped up for their `` white walker '' juice . 
  and it should be more money . 
  millions for each of these cases , out if the tax payer 's money , until people get seriously pissed for their tax money being used to pay for criminal incompetence . 
  they all shaved their beards off before the match . 
  but due to their manliness , they grew during the game .

  he is really quick on short sprints . 
  he is conserving enrgy for those , while the defenders have to run around wasting energy .

  that is crunchbang , with openbox as a window manager . 
  the bar on the bottom is tint2 , a highly customizable task bar usually used with openbox , but you should be able to try it out on any de . 
  the icons are for firefox , thunar file manager and terminator terminal . 
  the firefox icon itself i have replaced it mnually because i wanted it to match my general theming . 
  i will edit this comment bit later with a screenie to show you the general look of openbox as it is on my system . 
  in the tint2 config file , under the #panel section , you should have the following line :, 
  panel_items = ltsc, 
  the `` l '' from `` ltsc '' stands for launcher . 
  t is for taskbar , s for systray , c for clock . 
  after that , somewhere further in the config file , you should make something like this :, 
  # launcher, 
  launcher_background_id = 0, 
  launcher_icon_size = 24, 
  launcher_icon_theme = clarity, 
  # each launcher_item_app must be a full path to a . desktop file, 
  launcher_item_app = / usr/share/applications / firefox.desktop, 
  launcher_item_app = / usr/share/applications / thunar.desktop, 
  launcher_item_app = / usr/share/applications / terminator.desktop, 
  the padding , background id , size , icon theme are self explanatory . 
  the second part , with launcher_item_app , you must provide links to . desktop files , it wo n't work with anything else . 
  as you can see , my . desktop files are in / usr/share/applications / . 
  that can differ with some applications or on other distros . 
  if you ca n't find them , google for your specific distro and you will find out eventually .

  cheers !, 
  it 's not about the no knock warrants . 
  these are being used in lots of countries and it 's actually a very effective method . 
  swat teams seem to be too trigger happy in these cases . 
  the purpose of a no knock warrant is to not use the guns though . 
  to use the surprise in your advantage . 
  i do n't know about how swat usually does it , but in romania for example , they simply break the door at 4-5 am when everyone is sleeping and enter screaming `` everyone get down '' while pointing a gun to everyone who is inside . 
  no flashbang , no need to use the gun . 
  when you are being wakened at 4 am by a group of huge guys covered in black with guns pointing at your face , reaching for your weapon is not the first thing on your to do list . 
  yes it is somewhat brutal , but very effective and without using too much violence . 
  also i must add that in romania , when they do a no knock operation , everything is recorded by a cameraman of their own and then made public . 
  this way there are some videos on youtube with the romanian police breaking down the wrong door , getting in and scaring the shit out of innocent people , or a video in which they have completely failed to break down a door . 
  tinand cont ca acolo e trecut uk , presupun ca ireland e republic of ireland , si nu northern ireland despre care se vorbeste in video . 
  in the case of big professional advertising it is not luck though . 
  skill and inspiration .
