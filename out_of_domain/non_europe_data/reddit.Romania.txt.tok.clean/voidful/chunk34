  because of the raging bureaucracy in romania , this was never noticed , and sam did n't care . 
  now he probably pissed off some guy with an ounce of power and this shit happened . 
  so pardoned ? 
  no , he did break the immigration law and should pay for that . 
  were the immigration agents abusive ? 
  hell yes . 
  if everything he said is true , this is clearly a revenge of some sorts . 
  if the flash of nationalism you are talking about is something similar to russia or recent hungary nationalism , then no , do n't worry . 
  most people welcome immigrants , they are pretty damn rare anyways .

  if you have the correct cleaner 's / janitor 's outfit for a certain building you will be able to go everywhere in that building and no one will ever ask you a question . 
  if you are trying to enter a residential area and there is security , go with your most casual outfit ( shorts and slippers or flaps ) while carrying a bread or something like that . 
  the security will say `` hello '' . 
  i thought that it was pretty obvious that chuck was indeed god . 
  and also that the show was originally intended to have only 5 seasons . 
  in the season 5 finale at least , it is pretty clear that chuck was god .

  it 's very interesting to see that microsoft is taking the linux threat so seriously . 
  i 'm a linux user , but do n't see microsoft as an evil company , just as a company seeking to make money . 
  them starting to see linux as a true competitor will only lead to better products from microsoft , which is a win - win for everyone . 
  so any lawyer will do ?

  i ca n't say that i loved him too much . 
  he seemed cool and most of the times had very interesting things to say about the subject in discussion , and i do n't feel hate for him now . 
  honestly i do n't understand why people feel hate towards him . 
  he did what he did for a purpose ( promotion ) , for him it was not only about fun , but also about promotion and going up in his career . 
  he wanted to put himself on the map , which he did , then got caught and paid for it . 
  rules are rules and he broke them .

  depending on in which part of romania your father in law is , `` ce faci '' is not only a polite greeting , but also an actual inquiry about the person , demanding a real answer and it is a way of showing that you are truly interested about starting a conversation . 
  normally , answering with `` bine '' indicates that you are not in the mood for a convo , but it wo n't work with all people . 
  if you want to make it more clear that you do n't want to specify further , say something like `` uite bine , si eu pe aici '' . 
  if you are greeting someone and you do n't want it to be a conversation starter , just say `` salut '' without `` ce faci '' . 
  it 's not considered impolite to say just `` salut '' or `` buna '' , it 's just that in romanian , asking `` ce faci ? '', 
  is a conversation starter , you are pointing out that you want to talk further . 
  `` si '' and `` iar '' can , in certain contexts mean exactly the same thing , `` and '' , but `` iar '' seems to be used more when you are stating a followup , like it was the case in your example , and `` si '' is used more when there is an enumeration . 
  `` am mancat mici si carnati '' . 
  plus cloroform , just in case . 
  best case scenario in my opinion would be that everyone gets sterilized ( reversible ) at birth , something similar to the vaccines . 
  once you get to a point in life in which you want children , apply the ( free ) courses , and once you pass the tests you the shot to become fertile again . 
  even though reproduction is and should be a basic human right , we are currently multiplying too fast , and our numbers will be a very serious problem in a few generations . 
  of course , sterilization at birth can summon a lot of other problems , and it would require a fair and honest government , with little corruption in the society for this method to work correctly and to avoid abuse as much as possible . 
  as i said , it can grow wrong in lots of ways . 
  auditory hallucinations are quite normal sometimes, 
   hypnagogic hallucinations are often auditory or have an auditory component . 
  like the visuals , hypnagogic sounds vary in intensity from faint impressions to loud noises , such as crashes and bangs ( exploding head syndrome ) . 
  people may imagine their own name called , crumpling bags , white noise , or a doorbell ringing . 
  snatches of imagined speech are common . 
  while typically nonsensical and fragmented , these speech events can occasionally strike the individual as apt comments on -- or summations of -- their thoughts at the time . 
  they often contain word play , neologisms and made-up names . 
  hypnagogic speech may manifest as the subject 's own `` inner voice '' , or as the voices of others : familiar people or strangers . 
  more rarely , poetry or music is heard .

  i often have them when i go to bed extremely tired . 
  voices , or just random sounds . 
  one time , after almost two days without sleeping i heard a full 10 minutes conversation in spanish . 
  i do n't speak spanish , just know very little . 
  there was a man and a woman fighting , it was very vivid , like they were in the same room with me . 
  and last night , just one very strong and loud and also weird sound , like to gigantic glass objects crashing into each other and shattering , made me jump out of my bed .
