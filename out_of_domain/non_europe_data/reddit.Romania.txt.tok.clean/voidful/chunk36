  `` take the gypsyes back , it 's romania 's fault '' does not make any sense . 
  they are romanian citizens , born and raised here , this ethnic group is in europe for hundreds of years . 
  yes , due to social / political reasons , they were not integrated . 
  but just because romania has failed at integrating them does not mean that we are responsible for their actions . 
  only them , the ones who commit these crimes , are to blame and to be punished . 
  and your police has the duty to catch and punish them according to swedish law .

  priceless . 
   while conducting research for his latest book , `` euro jihad , '' he found that western european intelligence agencies estimate that less than one percent of the muslim population living within their borders are at risk for becoming radicals . 
   working off of these intelligence estimates , if you were to take one percent of the muslim populations of germany , france , and the united kingdom , by the most liberal of estimates , less than 125,000 muslims living in these combined countries would be prone to radicalization . 
  add that to the possible radical population across the rest of europe and the sum is approximately 325,000 muslims are at risk of becoming radical . 
   the key qualifier is `` at risk of becoming radical . '', 
  that does n't mean that they will pick up a gun or start plotting an attack . 
   `` radicalization and violent extremism are two different things , '' mr. rabasa says . 
  `` violent extremist behavior only comes about if a radicalized individual falls in with a circle of people who are open to using violence . '', 
   according to rabasa , a `` radical '' muslim could also be an individual who belongs to an islamist organization that is advocating for a sharia legal system , but does not embrace violence to bring this to fruition .

  probably that 's why they 've tried to sweep this under the rug by offering a sum of money . 
  if this were a one-off situation , then the bank would have no issues with digging up the info and paying the respective amount . 
  but they 're probably perfectly aware that they have hundreds / thousands of such accounts , dormant , which actually have some serious money and it would require some serious workforce to dig all that info . 
  it 's not forgotten , they know it 's there and there 's simply too much work for them to dig it all up .

  hello , interesting post . 
  from all you have said , i think that you are actually a romanian born italian . 
  that 's nothing to be ashamed of ; the fact that you are born in romania does n't magically make you as romanian as a person who actually lived there as an adult . 
  the romanians you have met there were displaying that kind of behaviour because that 's why they are there . 
  to work and make money , some of them to make money by any means possible . 
  you , as an italian citizen , are there to build a life , to do something for your future . 
  they are n't there to talk about culture or other various intellectual activities , but to make money . 
  that is all . 
  i 've met plenty of people like that , and also people who were hating the natives . 
  it 's stupid in my opinion , but i 'm not going to spend my time and energy dealing with them .
