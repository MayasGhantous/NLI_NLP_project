  this is how it looks like on a 7.5 inches wrist . 
  i use it at work , and it 's absolutely great for physical work , due to it 's small size and profile . 
  and it also looks much better im real life than it does in any photos . 
  am zis cetatenie dupa 5 - 6 ani in care au stat doar in romania . 
  kek, 
  loving it !, 
  it does n't bother me that much , and i actually have use for the chronograph , which makes it quite awesome . 
  for me it was finding a chronograph which does n't have a useless ( for me ) sundial . 
  i do n't have any use for fractions of a second ~ ~ sundial ~ ~ subdial , or for a 24 h subdial , and all under 200 $ decent quality chronographs seem to have one of those , except this one . 
  and it looks awesome too . 
  this makes me loom past the second hand issue .

  reliable little piece , i use it as my at work daily , can definitely take a beating . 
  la asta ma refeream si eu . 
  simple , clean and lovely . 
  no , it 's just a somewhat recent one , less marketed , since the weekender seems to be much more popular . 
  i think it 's using the same movement as the weekender ( a very loud one ) , but it 's 40 mm , with a more classy / classic look . 
  i do n't mind the loud ticking , so for me it 's a great watch for the price . 
  [ here it is ] ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/b00lpsij0o/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?qid=1443011833&amp;sr=8-1&amp;pi=sy200_ql40&amp;keywords=timex+waterbury&amp;dppl=1&amp;dpid=5130wqexbvl&amp;ref=plsrch ) . 
  about losing time , or not working properly , no . 
  there is maybe a problem with that amazon supplier ( maybe sending broken / low battery watches ) . 
  i 'm in europe , so i got mine from amazon uk . 
  absolutely no problems . 
  i did n't set the time for 4 - 5 months now , and it 's still perfectly accurate . 
  the only issue is the loud ticking , but that is a known issue , and you either accept it or not , it 's not a deal breaker for me , but it might be for others . 
  i would recommend looking for another amazon seller , or buying from timex ( if you are in the us ) . 
  they said that they 're going for the classic watch look . 
  that usually means 36 - 38 mm diameters . 
  unless you have huge wrists , it 's going to look just fine . 
  i have a 37 , a 40 and a 43 mm watches , and i have fairly large wrists ( 7.5 inches circumference ) . 
  they all look great on my wrist , including the 37 mm one . 
  indeed , nowadays watches are 40 mm and above , but 38 mm is going to look just fine on almost all wrists out there . 
  if it 's the official one , go for it . 
  with amazon you can always return it safely and get your money back , it 's worth the risk if you like it . 
  also look around , the simple no date waterbury comes in a few colors . 
  oh , and the strap you get with it is absolutely amazing .

  si mirosul poate fi un factor decisiv .

  hello hello !, 
  complete and total noob reporting in . 
  i 'm east european , so all my life i 've been enjoying the turkish coffee method . 
  i 'm just wondering , what alternatives would i have to getting some coffee in my cup , considering that turkish coffee is something i enjoy , but it can get messy . 
  would a french press or a moka pot get close to that ? 
  or is there any kind of gear which is also affordable which can get close ? 
  affordable would be under $ 200 / euro . 
  i know that this is a sub dedicated to hobby-ists , but help a noob out please !, 
  thank you !, 
  din punct de vedere legal , o sa fie un clusterfuck monumental . 
   be me, 
  corect , my bad . 
  e win-win . 
  we are extremely mixed , so you will find people who are similar to some region of europe or another . 
  we do all appear to have common points too , though . 
  my so is not romanian , she says that almost all romanians seem to have similar cheekbones , with the skin looking like it 's being pulled back on the face . 
  she finds that hilarious . 
  that and the accent makes it very easy for her to spot romanians , even differentiate from polish / lithuanians , who are very close to romanians in terms of looks . 
  histirically , there is the darker toned part of the gipsy ethnic group , who did n't mix that much with the romanian ethnics . 
  but genetically , when a child is pricreated there is still a certain chance that that child might be a bit dark skinned . 
  most of romanians carry the gene responsible for a tanned skin , that 's why it is possi le for two snow-white parents to have a tanned skin child ( had a classmate like that , he was nicknamed chocolate ) . 
  as in proeminent cheekbones in the upper area of the face , making the skin look perfectly stretched , tight , as it were pulled . 
  ill try to post some google imaged comparisons when i 'm nit at wotk . 
  vadim ? 
  dar nu prea are sens.

   from 2005 to 2009 , the number of people entering the u.s. illegally declined by nearly 67 % , according to the pew hispanic center , from 850,000 yearly average in the early 2000s to 300,000,

  exactly . 
  if they sold enough items , anf with large enough margins , then the profit for the whole stock is still there , and selling the items to clear space at a very low price is an excellent idea , and counts as profit for that type of item . 
  it 's a good incentive to stop smoking though . 
  slowly but surely , a thought snook in the back of my mind , gaining power . 
  i was spending exorbitant amounts of money to get a pretty damn high chance of dying an awfully long and painful death . 
  fuck that shit . 
  i quit more than a year ago .

  i quit vaping cold turkey as well , few months ago . 
  i was vaping 6 - 12 . 
  i was a bit sick of e-cigs , as i was before with cigarettes , feeling sick because of the smell , and vapers tongue was also driving me nuts . 
  quitting vaping cold turkey did send me in a 3 hour long sweating and shivering session , which was more intense than any cigarette withdrawls i have ever felt . 
  but was the shortest . 
  after about 3 hours , i calmed down , went to sleep and had one of my best sleeping sessions ever . 
  and after quitting nicotine my sleeping is so so so much better , it 's incredible . 
  the craving does get much lighter , close to none after a while , so no worries .
