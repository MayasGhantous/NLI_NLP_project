  once you get the bare basics , and a general idea of how romanian sounds , and you can distinct words in romanian , start watching romanian movies and listen to ro music . 
  this will help you with pronounciation , getting used to the language and you 'll learn through assimilation and association . 
  yes , it 's the commercial support . 
  ubuntu ( canonical ) has , for a fee of course , 24/7 support lines . 
  for a governmental institution and for serious businesses this is vital to have , because it solves issues which may and will occur in a fast painless manner , because when dealing with a few thousands machines , no matter if you use ubuntu or debian , or windows , issues shall occur . 
  even with the paid commercial support , you get way cheaper than you 'd get with windows . 
  you are right . 
  it 's not only about how big or small the country is though , population density is the most important . 
  in my country , especially in the urban areas , the density is quite high . 
  thus creating the infrastructure for those areas and bringing the service there is highly profitable . 
  muslim majority that europe is soon to have ? 
  what ? 
  oh , i actually did n't know that and thought that he was being serious heh . 
  nowadays , most europeans consider religion as intimate , and mostly keep it for themselves . 
  people have their own takes on what religion is , and how and what they believe , and yes , they do interpret the bible to how they think it 's right . 
  you are the hero we need . 
  somewhat spoiler : if you read all 7 ** foundations ** books , not just the first 3 , you 'll see how far that can go . 
  keep the eye patch only for special ocasions mate . 
  exactly . 
  steam , netflix and gog have prooven that . 
  this applies even in second world countries , where wages are significantly lower . 
  if the service is cheap or relatively cheap ( all 3 of the above are cheap ) and easy to use , then users , even tech savy users who can torrent without too much searching , will prefere the paid service , not only because it 's legal , but because it 's just easy and handy to use . 
  he bought almost all of the items avalable . 
  the producer guy said `` tons and tons '' . 
  he put one with one billion , and bought it . 
  raised the `` in game '' value to half a billion . 
  so if you destroy a ship with one of those items in them was destroy , it 'll yeld half a billion worth of loyalty points to who ever destroyed it . 
  the other items were on the market with the price of 100 . 
  so naturally , when this got out , everyone rushed to buy as many as possible . 
  and he had them all on sale for them . 
  and it had 16 pixels . 
  yup , it 's amazing . 
  it 's probably topped only by some cheap , but very good looking and highly experienced prostitutes in some poor countries . 
  am aware of that , since i 'm living in one . 
  but there are some similar services here ( some websites which stream shows for free , and you get some extra stuff for a small fee , similar to netflix - they 're illegal though ) and people are actually happy to pay for those . 
  also there are some torrenting sites which offer huge amounts of content , and also have fees for some extra features , and again , people are paying for that . 
  police tried to shut those down numerous times , but apparently they simply keep their servers in countries in which our police do n't have any kind of jurisdiction , so their hands are tied . 
  yup , sometimes ^ ^ ^ stuff ^ ^ ^ happens . 
  i read an interview with bruno heller few months back . 
  he stated that there are going to be 7 seasons . 
  remember that rj had two men break into jane 's room and take photos of his research . 
  jane did the toothpick trick and he was aware of that . 
  i believe that since he did the toothpick trick , jane was expecting rj to send them there . 
  that means that the research on the walls was misleading , with the intention of making rj think he was real info about jane 's research . 
  jane lead rj into making up that list of 7 , making rj think that he is ahead , while jane is actually the one ahead , having a real list , maybe even shorter in his mind , being pretty sure about who rj actually is , and introduced rj on the list to make it more believable for rj .

  why chuck ? 
  chuck is no fun . 
  death on the other hand , could make it more entertaining . 
  if you wear that kind of tight suits , the friction from moving around can cause an unwanted erection , without any help from the mind . 
  when you wear underpants and really tight pants over the underpants , the genitals are still squeezed in that way . 
   you do realize humans are still evolving , yes ? 
  so we wo n't always be human, 
  we are n't evolving anymore . 
  not for a long time . 
  evolving is about adapting to your changing environment . 
  human species has reach the point in which it adapts it 's environment to suit it 's needs . 
  so most definetly we wo n't evolve naturally . 
  if changes will occur , they will be self induced , either via genetical engineering , or technologic additions . 
  or colonizing another planet and evolving to adjust to it 's gravity and oxygen concentration . 
  also , when you enter someone 's house , take your hat off . 
  it 's considered offensive to stay with your hat on inside . 
  sword fighting for the more advanced ones . 
  i 've seen really good orphanages , and also bad ones . 
  as bad as they were before ? 
  hell no . 
  children with mental illnesses or severe physical handicaps were n't considered useful so they were keeping them in dark rooms . 
  oftenly no beds , no windows . 
  if there were beds , they were tied to the bed posts . 
  they shit and piss and ate and drank water in that room . 
  many of them were not used with light . 
  they were almost completely unsupervised , no one gave a shit about them . 
  they were mentally unstable children . 
  the most physically able ones , or the older ones , were raping or beating the others . 
  the so called `` nurses '' just tied them and shove some food in there . 
  if you had a disabled child and gave the child up for foster care , that 's what was happening . 
  these `` orphanages '' were discovered in '90 - ' 91 . 
  the `` nurses '' and `` doctors '' were still there , doing the same damn thing , treating them in the same way . 
  you mean that the `` the dark knight '' and `` the dark knight rises '' are not documentaries ? 
  yes . 
  but the title of this post is misleading . 
  she never said that they should be put to death .
