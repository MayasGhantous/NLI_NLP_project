  that 's the chance that the pawn would accept the other pawns `` proposals '' . 
  multiply that with the sliding scale . 
  so let 's say that this pawn gets 30 % chance of approval . 
  so 20 % out of the 30 % will lead to an actual 6 % real chance . 
  which is low , but not impossible . 
  euro truck simulator is awesome to just lay back and relax . 
  get some podcast or misic or radio going , grab a controller , lay back and enjoy a few hours of driving through europe . 
  beautiful locations , constantly changing scenery and swearing at the guy in front of you for breaking and / or changing lanes with no warning whatsoever . 
  pure bliss .

  if you do n't have much experience with alt-right crowd ( like me ) it 's really worth a watch . 
  it 's well articulated , well made and full of bullshit . 
  it 's pretty much a huge pile of crap packaged nicely . 
  i see this kind of stuff now and then . 
  some guy from bumfuck , iowa or middle of nowhere , eastern europe ( i am from middle of nowhere , eastern europe , born and raised ) shouting loud how conpletely fucked the `` western world '' is . 
  i live in this `` western world '' for a few years now . 
  when it comes to europe , it 's never been better . 
  never . 
  saying the the western civilization is destroyed is one huge lie . 
  this video just shows how painfully full of shit these people are .

  i do n't remember if they stated it clearly in the series , but epstein never stopped and never will . 
  the shop goes on and on , probably for ever . 
  he did have all his plans and designs saved locally , so all the information needed on how to build an epstein drive was available after everyone realised what he discovered .

  nowadays a thinker 's judgement is restricted by no tether ;, 
  he projects it in a moment over centuries together . 
  to his eye the sun all-glorious is a red orb wrapt in shrouds ,, 
  closing like a bleeding ulcer among all-darkening clouds ,, 
  he sees how the heavenly bodies in vast spaces freeze and run ,, 
  rebels that have torn the fetters of the dazzling light and sun ;, 
  and , behold , the world 's foundation is now blackened to the core ,, 
  and the stars , like leaves in autumn , flicker out and are no more ,, 
  lifeless time distends his body and becomes endless duration ,, 
  because nothing ever happens in the boundless desolation ;, 
  in the night of non-existence all is crumbled , all are slain ,, 
  and , in keeping with its nature , peace eternal reigns again .

  hello , i want to install debian testing , but the official images apparently lack some non-free firmware which allows me to use my keyboard during the install . 
  basically , when i hit install from the live usb my keyboard stops working . 
  do you guys have any idea where from i can get an image ( be it unofficial ) with the non-free firmware loaded ? 
  ok , i have [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/ubb37wm ) pop up when i want to update wow via battle.net . 
  this is installed via playonlinux , have tried several wine versions so far , same thing over and over again . 
  any suggestions ? 
  i am not running the game from a ntfs partition . 
  i have downloaded and installed hearthstone without any issue , same was with wow , just the updates seem to be affected . 
  edit : solved . 
  apparently a file in the wow folder was on `` read only '' permission for other users apart from root . 
  to solve that either change permissions for the folder as `` read and write '' from your file manager as root or just, 
   sudo chmod 777 [ full path to your wow folder ], 
  so , i want an upgrade from my currend evod setup , and i 'm not sure about these two . 
  i will probably get myself an mvp 2 , and i 'm currently looking for a tank which will go well with my needs . 
  i want a hassle free , easy to maintain tank . 
  from what i understand , they both have great vape quality , but i keep hearing that kanger tends to have some gurgling issues . 
  does that apply to aspire as well ? 
  i 'm also interested in the aspire nautilus and aspire vivi nova . 
  would those be wider than the mvp ? 
  also , a friend of mine just got the kanger aerotank and that started to gurgle the second day of use . 
  is there a chance for that to happen with the mini version as well ? 
  hello / r/trees !,

  can some of you please suggest a pipe , wooden or glass ?

  i 'd like to see a few links of european websites which sell pipes appropriate for ents and their magic consuming needs . 
  please help and thank you !, 
  hello , i 'm looking for something under $ 300 and so far i 'm looking at the 32 gb 5x and at the p9 lite . 
  5x is looking much better for me at this moment , but does anyone know if the p9 lite is the same performance wise as the 5x or is there a noticeable difference ? 
  any pros / cons from a user perspective for any of them ? 
  i 'm familiar with their specs as i have done my research , but i 'm not aware of any issues they might have . 
  also , any other recommendations ? 
  just not moto , i 've just had my second moto phone failing on me . 
  thank you !,
