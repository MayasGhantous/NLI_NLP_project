  well , what about the situation when the vassals are still my vassals and i can raise their levies vs situation where they part from me but still participate in war as my allies ? 
  what influences these mechanics ? 
  thanks for the spoilers , or my history books would be ruined . 
  i 've heard that sometimes they give you the wrong directions so you actually fail the test when you try to follow their suggestions . 
  so do n't blindly obey them during the test . 
  no , it 's completely wrong . 
  nuking the commonwealth does n't even make sense : how are you going to continue playing after ? 
  guys , how old and socially competent are you ? 
  i just kinda do n't want to come and be the only guy of my group age and sit in awkward silence cuz everyone is too shy to talk . 
  basically developers way to represent dornish ways to defend against dragons . 
  basically i was playing as king of jerusalem and then things got messy and bam , i reformed the roman empire . 
  conquered pretty much all the sunni land , byzantine land , iberian peninsula , british isles , french lands , italy and hre lands . 
  got bored , switch to russian guys and here are the results when ai tries to manage an empire . 
  oh , and also the bubonic plague which killed 3 emperors in a row . 
  cs : go is like faramir , only when it nearly dies , valve will understand . 
  thanks !, 
  so , after reading your comments , i decicded to play as usa on my next playthrough just for fun . 
  things are going well enough , but i 've a problem : i 'm seriously behind in my industrial level as i do n't have enough factories . 
  the problem is that i ca n't build more factories because of my gov. 
  what should i do ? 
  nah , i know , but i switched to the usa which does n't allow me to change parties . 
  how can i create a lot of factories without the ability to make them by myself ? 
  why do some people suggest to send in some stacks separately to fight ? 
  i 've read something like `` send in x and y and then send in e as reinforcements '', 
  is it actually beneficial for you or was i reading it wrong ? 
  also a 75 % sale for the game and all the dlcs . 
  how do you beat this unholy force ? 
  i do n't want to become weimar republic and micromanage my industry manually :(, 
  also , infamy is just a number . 
  hpm 's sanctions suck , though . 
  well , apparently berlin has already been occupied and they are just sitting there . 
  however , i easily crushed them with 180 brigades since they were so low on morale . 
  i rejoiced and left the game to automatically crush the remains of the revolution . 
  however , the communists reinforced in just a month , with 300 - 400 brigades , some of them spawned right in the berlin . 
  my troops were scattered all over the country and berlin itself was surrounded by rebels and my main armies could n't make it to berlin in time since it has level 0 fort ... 
  i think severe sanctions make sense : look how deeply russia 's economy plunged because of sanctions and they only annexed one state , imagine what would happen if germany anchlussed switzerland , which is something that happened in my game . 
  however , do you mind sharing your edits ? 
  i could use them in my games . 
  thanks !, 
  lazarev served in great britain during his early career , which explains his fluency in english . 
  occitania independent ? 
  how did it happen ? 
  ` from my point of view , the westerosi are evil ! ', 
  are you sure with your information ? 
  in-game tab says complete opposite of what you are saying . 
  took the screenshot 2 minutes ago . 
  edit : toned down the comment, 
  well , then what 's the problem ? 
  the author accepted and fixed his mistake , why so suddenly aggressive about something he did a year ago or so ? 
  i do n't think mobilising demolishes your population * that * much . 
  if you are not behind military tech and you know how to war and if you mobilise , you 'll have no problem fighting germans and ottomans . 
  uk and italy wo n't matter anyway . 
  ally france so germany will devote some of their troops to the west . 
  well , it 's a bit stretch to compare bill gates with neo-nazis . 
  reminds me how yanokivch forgot ` tree ' in ukranian and had to use russian word . 
  wow , in my playthroughs ussr collapses in sixties or seventies , never saw it survive up to the 21st century . 
  to be honest i sometimes find the mod boring after a couple of decades , mainly because everything 's good : you are always in profit , your army maintenance is non-existent , there are no rebellions and there are no wars unless you initiate them . 
  still , the mod 's really awesome and i loved your descriptions !, 
  interested to see an actual aar . 
  has isis happened in your playthrough yet ? 
  it will provide something to do , but disappointingly enough , they are very weak and if syria has any allies , is dies out in 3 months or so . 
  i also want to thank you this mod for introducing me to the wonderful mod of global strategy games from paradox !, 
  before i discovered ck2 mod through / r/asoiaf subreddit , i honestly thought that civ 5 was the best historical global strategy game there is . 
  oh boy , how my world has changed since i discovered ck2 . 
  now i have over 150 hours in ck2 and victoria 2 and i 've learned about medieval and victorian age history more than from 10 years of school , plus i became really proficient at asoiaf lore . 
  thank you , developers of this mod and thank you paradox developers . 
  `` nazi crimes against the polish nation claimed the lives of ** 2.77 ** ** million ** ethnic poles , [ 1 ] and ** 2.7 ** to ** 2.9 ** ** million ** polish jews , according to estimates of the polish government-affiliated institute of national remembrance ( ipn ) . 
  [ 1 ] historians outside poland put the number of jewish victims of the holocaust in occupied poland at ** 3.0 million ** . '', 
  soviet union of course was n't the knight in shining armour , but to say that they were worse than nazis ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_repressions_of_polish_citizens_ ( 1939 % e2 % 80 % 9346 ), 
  it is estimated that some ** 150,000 ** polish citizens died during the soviet occupation . 
  you know , just for the sake of experiment , try to over-saturate some of these pictures just how they usually do in promos and ads for the cities . 
  i did already . 
  to be honest , it 's not that hard to not get banned there . 
  just do n't push your opinions too hard and be honest about the problems in russia and surprisingly , people would upvote you . 
  / r/europe is not that xenophobic , excluding some of the more extremist users . 
  this is a legit strat , that 's how i won as a republic . 
  it took me like 5 restarts to get it right , but the strategy is what the op described : swiftly eliminate the 2 stacks and establish superiority because aside from the event troops , prc is going to get manchuria from soviets which gives them more mobilised units . 
  if they kick you out of their territories - you lose ; if you go bankrupt - you lose . 
  however , when you win , you get a really really satisfying feeling . 
  scripted events after that suck though , because the game thinks that you are prc , not republic . 
  he is 53 mil $ in debt, 
  i guess hes getting desperate, 
  it will be also really interesting to see him die from some really simple or even stupid cause , rather than from elaborate plot or some fight . 
  the greatest plotter and the catalyst of the war dies from climbing accident , dunno, 
  put a tape on my laptop webcam as soon as i watched the episode, 
  there are , check google . 
  brand new chronics , it 's going to progress from c1 to modern times via constant updates ; however , they are going to implement things better and more differently this time . 
  economical crisis in russia means that conversion rate to rouble is really really high . 
  no idea tbh, 
  thank you very much , it 's really helpful , really appreciate you writing all this stuff for me . 
  oh , i nearly forgot : what are attributes ? 
  how do they work ? 
  is it like enchanting but for elements ? 
  is there a limit ? 
  is there a ` failing ' chance ? 
  what is the best attribute to enchant ? 
  really enjoyed the caretaker actor . 
  and ffs , liz , stop being so annoying . 
  tagged to germany during its seventh year of war and found this .
