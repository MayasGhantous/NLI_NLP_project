  it might be rude and unpleasent of coarse .

  welcome to the jungle . 
  it 's so much easier here in low elo . 
  3 lowest picks are obliged by the bronze gentlemen code to fight over going mid , firstpick instalocks shaco , takes tp and ignite and says nothing , and the 2nd pick just flames the rest of the team . 
  no problems with that pickorder though . 
  you 've missed the part about selling your soul , dude .

  alex ross is a beast . 
  i love his works so much . 
  dyrus should feel like darien now . 
  camped 24/7 . 
  losing streaks sometimes made me consider quiting life , sure . 
  never considered leaving the league . 
  you should start with a champion pool . 
  usually you achive it by buying one top tier champion for every role and playing a lot of normals . 
  till you are confident that you can perform on wvwry possition . 
  after that you repeat this two more times , till you get 3 strong picks for every role . 
  by that time you usualy improve your understanding of the game and understanding of every role . 
  only then you should start thinking about what you want to main . 
  take first tower . 
  rotate mid for global gold . 
  make sure to control dragon and vision . 
  group up early . 
  also : laneganks . 
  no one ever expects you to come through lane bushes . 
  tbh darien is still a pretty solid player . 
  i strongly recommend you watching his streams when some new champion that can be played top comes out . 
  he adapts faster than most pros . 
  oddone and alex in one team ?
