  there was one bard that stated that he 's trolling in chat at the start of the game , proceeded to helping the enemy team with his ulti and laughted about it in chat , was reported and never got banned . 
  so many strong teams . 
  gon na be fun . 
  typical first week gambit . 
  i hope we wo n't have another 0-5 this time . 
  yeah . 
  spain is that funny little town in that strange `` europe '' country . 
  am i right ? 
  that is not the case but it is pretty ironic that in russia bad players are still called `` crawfish '' ( i think because `` cancer '' ( as a disease ) and `` crawfish '' ( as a biological term ) are both denoted by the same word `` pa\u043a '' ) . 
  so that is pretty much my last few teams that are drawn there . 
  also that would be harder to explain using word `` cancer '' both times . 
  i 've promissed myself not to get hyped after the last few years of dissappointment . 
  but crowfall sounds so cool . 
  given does n't deserve to have such a shitty defence . 
  it hurts to see him like that . 
  great goal though . 
  forgive me teammates . 
  time to fail insecs , die to camps , smite viciously and feed like hell . 
  but all that with a cool skin . 
  it is a bit annoying how people call anything that appears on pbe gp update just because some dude that leaked ekko has also mentioned it . 
  now it 's some half life 3 level paranoia . 
  water involved ? 
  it 's gp !, 
  booming sound ? 
  it 's gp !, 
  i bet if the teaser for whtever it is would be a little girl in a pink dress people would still find the way to explain how it is gp-related . 
  two times in my life i went from 85kgs to 60kgs in a couple of month both times . 
  very strict diet , lots of exercises . 
  as simple as that . 
  ellis was by far the best thing that have ever happend to moonknight in my opinion . 
  i would havr paid any money and probably part of my internal orhans for it to be made . 
  typing from my phone makes me spanish . 
  who would have thought . 
  i prefer quality over quantity . 
  riot make a skin when they have an idea that they think is worth it . 
  kinda like it this way . 
  and my axe !, 
  it 's pretty obvious that gmb will win today . 
  those darien photos t _____ t, 
  can someone please explain me all that hate to the telegraph ? 
  how do we stop it ? 
  well , for exaple by adding an option to report someone for the things said in lobby . 
  so that people could report easily not by uploading lobby screenshot somewhere . 
  and after adding this option by banning the living shit of those fuckers . 
  two week ban for treatning to troll in the lobby and the problem will be solved . 
  and then there is the russian half ... 
  oh , come on . 
  at least one of those voices is ukranian !, 
  incarnati0n gon na have one hell of a split . 
  unlike incarnation , yeah ? 
  all for one mirror ziggs on the aram was one of the most horrible things that have ever happened to me in league . 
  now i 'm happy . 
  while there is a lot of work that has been put into this skin its theme just repeats pentakill one . 
  if someone needs guitar based skin - it is ekko . 
  for the flcl reference . 
  [ there is no such thing as rooting too hard ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dxhhqtx.jpg?1 ), 
  [ oops i did again ( max voice ) . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/ffbq3bnnwhs ), 
  ftfy, 
  while rush is perfoming better atm , meteos is still liked more . 
  and with all-stars being a vanity contest i guess it will be meteos . 
  find out on the next episode, 
  it 's the only riven skin that i like . 
  kinda sad . 
  the last time when someone took over germany it ended up with the third reich . 
  i 'm officialy worried . 
  that music is beyond awesome . 
  cabo is such a beast !, 
  it 's nice to see gambit back to their old style and not trying to play around forgiven . 
  shurima needs your votes !, 
  most important question : how many points did you bring to earn us that pool party mundo skin ? 
  nice one . 
  it 's a shame that you are only repeating someone else 's joke . 
  thank you for reminding me why i hate this champion so much . 
  oh , come on !, 
  we still have gambit !, 
  you 'll pay with blood for giving up first blood !, 
  and that is why we need 1v1 mode on a regular basis . 
  [ or garen ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd4uitqsrjg ), 
  [ i think vtm has nailed bloodboil perfectly . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zwabkabmag ) might as well use their experience . 
  did n't include ru and oce . 
  what a coward !, 
  read it like `` blowing malphite '' . 
  felt strange . 
  [ nicolas cage did it first though ] ( https://youtu.be/kknxbbnppza ), 
  and the next week faker plays zed and everyone 's like `` wow !, 
  zed is op . 
  nerf plz ! '', 
  i still think alex would be perfect for c9 . 
  when he 's in form he is a same level/a better player than bjerg , rarely tilts , he has tons of experience and he can do shotcalling . 
  obviously ori just dodging all of kata 's skillshots . 
  tbh , `` discussing life issues '' usualy means hours of nonstop whine irl . 
  and no one is interested in that . 
  it 's a common mistake when you are 17-20 though . 
  dude , i 'm buying three skins for champions i do n't even play . 
  on the other hand if you are interested in a girl you should shut the fuck up abut your `` life issues '' till you are already married for about three years . 
  i do n't think that i 'm in condition to explain or anybody will be interested to listen so just believe me . 
  or i can be entirely wrong . 
  that is also possible .
