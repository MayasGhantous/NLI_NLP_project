  report top and jungle for feeding , gg . 
  yeah , that is not exactly `` silver of the moon '' but will also do , i guess . 
  dude . 
  that bronze guy from my team is the real riven master . 
  he has managed to cancel his damage and my lp . 
  how many hands do you need to beat froggen ? 
  choose wisely . 
  [ totaly made it in excel by myself .

  oh , come on !, 
  of coarse it 's salty . 
  this fucks the team pretty much and they are obviously disappointed . 
  as for unprofessional part have you lately checked jose mourinho 's postgame interviews ? 
  also at the same time i want to become a rock star and fly to the moon . 
  yeah , after a thorough analysis i can confirm : it 's the same man . 
  and that is how i will remember dyrus this split : running from a giant dragon trying to bite his ass off . 
  na'vi is a ukranian team though . 
  sadly not russian . 
  the new hud is not something heavily sci-fi themed though . 
  that hero minion . 
  you will be missed , little friend . 
  missed but not passed . 
  kassadin 's daughter teaser . 
  that 's the point of uniform , i guess . 
  you saw the video . 
  he got karma for watching it . 
  i liked secret world and champions online systems pretty much . 
  gear for stats , costumes for looks . 
  i hate wearing some shitty designer 's fuck-up just because it gives 10 more strength than anything else in the game . 
  for human brain it 's pretty much nothing . 
  welp . 
  i ca n't play more than 2 games a day . 
  it will take me a whole week with 50 % winrate to win those 8 i guess . 
  dude , my club has a negative budget . 
  you guys are fucking rich !, 
  back in the 15th century in wallachia guys were n't even allowed to sit on the ground . 
  that was considered too comfotable so they were impaled . 
  they won the league against ottaman team fenerbah\u00e7e that year , so i think you 're onto something . 
  when do they play , again ? 
  thanks, 
  classic overagression, 
  just arcade veigar recolours . 
  it is pretty inaccurate though . 
  person/organisation doing something = / = person/organisation doing everything wrong . 
  yeah twitch should do something with the issue but how the fuck does that mean they should n't have done something about trick ? 
  is it now that police are n't allowed to arrest thieves while there are murderers unpunished ? 
  that is just highly illogical . 
  santa 's elves held a referendum . 
  128 % has voted to join russia . 
  no love for xan ? 
  [ he 's got like best lines in both games !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=la6toxpghca ), 
  every time i play coop i tend to quote : `` we delude ourselves to think our pitiable band will stand up to our enemies . '', 
  you ca n't see them because it pretty much the point of been a secret fangay . 
  riot disable junglers it 's early season 5 again . 
  basically better olaf than dyrus . 
  dude , i play 2 games a day . 
  job , life , etc. 
  i ca n't grind so much . 
  too old for that shit . 
  you can barely imagine how much i hated riot . 
  not that they did something wrong . 
  but from pure emotional perspective ( i 'm not talking weather it 's logical or not ) it was a very doubtfull decision . 
  the effort to get something is usualy equal to the value of reward . 
  8 wins is too much for an icon . 
  i wo n't go further in details because i 'm not fully qualified and that would be a long post for nothing , but should riot do it 3 wins for an icon or 8 wins for icon + ward people would n't have complaned that much . 
  darien already did it . 
  ap lizard 100 % winrate at lcs . 
  [ are you saying that fiora-players gon na be too depressed to kill you after this ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1qpnszdraq ), 
  yeah . 
  too bad this never happens on ru server . 
  shut the fuck up . 
  it like a tradition . 
  every year roskomnadzor finds something wrong with wiki and threatens to ban it . 
  it 's never gon na be done for more than few days though . 
  lived in moscow for 26 years . 
  was n't expecting that . 
  yorick disabled till rework . 
  mods deleting this tread . 
  calling it bow . 
  i 'm not sure about moscow . 
  you see chinese culture has a certain charm . 
  also hk is ` bout perfect cyberpunk setting . 
  that 's why that works so well . 
  moscow on the other hand is as far from being cyber or punk as it can be . 
  russian culture and history while being rich are also far from being easy to convey through simple visual images and are difficult to put into cyberpunk setting . 
  without spoiling anything i want to warn you though that if a certain mission has an objective to capture certain someone without killing them - subdue is a no-go . 
  in that case game would qualify that as killing your target . 
  split personality ao shin for sure . 
  knowing yasuo mains he was probably blaming his team for not helping , riot for making bard op and his mother for telling him to start doing his homework . 
  please no . 
  they have tried that once . 
  did n't end well . 
  i was joking apparently . 
  but for the sake of it the reign of terror was a bloodbath . 
  and after that napoleon took over . 
  and like did to europe the same very thing that hitler did years later minus holocaust . 
  i think you are taught history backwards . 
  the values were spreading through society long before the french revolution .
