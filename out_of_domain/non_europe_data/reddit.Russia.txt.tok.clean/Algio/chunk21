  putin is one of the most powerful political figures of the last few decades . 
  that does n't make him good or something but got ta admit : he 's not a brainless megalomaniac that some papers are trying to make out of him . 
  maybe the only other thing he read today was a toaster manual . 
  only if they have oil . 
  r is n't a skillshot though . 
  tbh that 's about the best hype video i 've seen yet this year . 
  [ ] ( #face - fabulous ), 
  is it eu lcs ? 
  `` the knack of flying is learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss '', 
  was n't that a joke about incarnation playing zed game without using ult even once ? 
  dude , they ca n't carry . 
  [ you are lazy ] ( https://www.peekvids.com/watch?v=qxc7y2usayx ), 
  huni thought he was playing dyrus not darius . 
  common mistake . 
  guys , i 'm a bit confused . 
  i 'm not from a western country and my country 's culture is a little bit different . 
  is been lgbt character really that much of a deal for people here to inclued it to 4 reasons to read a comic book ? 
  tbh i wanted fnatic to lose after yesterday 's fail . 
  huni needs to get his head fixed and the cold shower of defeat is the best and the fastest way . 
  article ? 
  you mean it 's not only the title ? 
  as a guy , straight git could sneak it . 
  but in the end my team just got demoted . 
  one can dream . 
  yes , you 'll miss part of the story but should n't have major problems with that . 
  and people downvoted me for saying that clg might lose to pain, 
  it 's not a shitty day . 
  it 's an inability to keep fucking calm in decisive matches . 
  they have overcome that in na this year , but worlds seem to be still far too scary . 
  stanislav lem had a very similar aproach . 
  hated tarkovsky 's solaris . 
  did n't ever bother to watch hollywood shit . 
  that approach is highly understandable . 
  they have already tried that in russia . 
  team sucked like all cis teams . 
  it 's reddit . 
  but i can totally see his w cooldown been nerfed or his e shield . 
  i just hope that riot would resist its usual habbit and nerf champion instead of killing him . 
  noob . 
  message myself to make others think that i recieve messages .

  and that 's why you should get this shit settled before starting any kind of relationship . 
  no need to get another person into it , just make sure eveyone understands that it is a part of your life just like football or other more traditional sport . 
  otherwise you 'll find yourself in a rather complicated situation . 
  at least that is how that works for me . 
  there are so many places you can shove them . 
  for those that say that it is a mistake and it will be impossible to find adc of the same level - please remember that it 's not soloq . 
  while forg1ven is one of the most skilled european adcs you must consider many other things . 
  sinergy with team and team 's playstyle , mood and williness to play , champion pool , his communication with coach etc. 
  this been said i hope for the best for forg1ven . 
  it 's really sad to see him benched . 
  i 'll have to find a better job if you continue . 
  most arsenal fans are too young to remeber that in the first place . 
  oh well , here come the downvotes . 
  that is beyond lazy . 
  generic phrases , pretty generic `` epic music '' and 1 minute of nothingness . 
  that is basically shiny `` oh , look !, 
  quarterfinals '' card . 
  comparing this year 's videos to last year 's `` warriors '' makes me sad . 
  because they have no idea behind them . 
  take generic shit - blend together . 
  from a creative point of view they are worth nothing at all . 
  [ actually , it was really just the worst of times ] ( http://40.media.tumblr.com/1183cd731cc638719c3d08a0d26609b1/tumblr_mpzs8bonqk1szor52o1_1280.jpg ), 
  god . 
  i hate preseasons . 
  `` maybe some terrorist -- ? '', 
  aziraphale began . 
  `` not one of ours , '' said crowley . 
  `` or ours , '' said aziraphale . 
  `` although ours are freedom fighters , of course . '', 
   hermione freaks out , and she tells them to try and find some stuff to build a fire . 
  ron says `` are you a witch '', 
  was expecting some kind of monty python joke here . 
  that is not mine but art is pretty cool there and i have never seen it posted on this subreddit before :, 
  [ some illustrations to lol noir au story . 
  ] ( http://rikki-fanart.tumblr.com/post/131573276722/i-draw-this-for-bnbc-noir-story-piltovers ), 
  as `` wash '' since guns of icarus beta surronded by guys with most random igns , i feel your pain . 
  nice . 
  but you are still missing [ the sexiest one . 
  some anime level determination there . 
  i accidentally got paul anthony romero 's music playing while i was reading it . 
  that was surprisingly epic . 
  so voodoo-themed champion at last ? 
  yes , riot ? 
  can it please be `` yes '' ? 
  darien , of coarse !, 
  the closest that we 've got . 
  does nite owl still kick guys so hard that they fly several meters before hitting the ground in the ultimate cut ? 
  that kind of 300 shit bothered me quite a bit . 
   as a russian fan, 
  chelsea flair . 
  seam, 
  0 chances , 0 take-ons , 0 crosses , 0 shots . 
  poor aliens . 
  do n't know why are you getting downvoted . 
  character is bland . 
  the yellow one is pikachu or something , i guess . 
  i 'm just so frustraited with clg fans ' reaction to this one . 
  like `` whatever , guys . 
  just a jersey '' .
