  that makes me sad 'cause i do n't use facebook . 
  we are mainstream , bois !, 
  pffff ... no lcl hype video . 
  that what everyone should be concerned with !, 
  remember kog before adc update ? 
  i still fail to see why riot had to change him . 
  better buff irelia, 
  and now i want a banshee champion . 
  now go read the comics to see how much the movie sucks in comparison . 
   you hit the nail on the head there . 
  pushed the nail in the neck/chest area there . 
  and still no one suspects that all tahm 's skins match nami 's . 
  if you look closely chef tahm is also based on koi fish . 
   in all seriousness tho , just nerf the fu $ $ $ $ ng rageblade before you manage to gut all the champions in lol that have any potential of using it effectively . 
  rip kogmaw . 
  anyone else here who does n't give a fuck about solo queue ? 
  i still sit at like 30 % winrate due my refusal to play meta pokemons . 
  i regret nothing . 
  they should get ellis as a story advisor though . 
  as a devoted perish song user i can confirm . 
  oddish can hear for sure . 
  tbh i ca n't care less about it `` sounding boring '' . 
  i liked about 80 % of what i 've heard so it 's pretty much instabuy for me . 
  that xin has some liefeld-esque legs . 
  it is funny that in russia we call zenit `` racist cunts '' . 
  this . 
  their mid is ok-ish , but the rest of the team are good cis lvl . 
  and that is worse than brazil . 
  we are talking about worlds . 
  i doubt that fomko stands a chance against any na , eu or kr top tier midlaner . 
  makes me kinda sad that riot have chosen the most bland approach . 
  anything can annoy / r/gunners when the team is n't winning . 
  it does n't take much effort . 
  i find it kinda ironic . 
  when he was first released reddit quickly proclaimed him `` the new bard '' and predicted that no one will play him beacuse of how `` weak '' he was . 
  after a few patches riot buffed him so he became one of the fotms . 
  at that point he was overpowered because of great survivability , strong utility and good damages . 
  riot nerfed all three of these aspects so now tahm is weaker than the time he was released . 
  and no one on reddit still says that he is underpowered . 
  reddit knows balance , i guess . 
  blocked in russia . 
  what is it ? 
  [ and here is the voice over artist . 
  have a good fap , bois . 
   that 's why empty stomachs and a ruined economy for part of a generation, 
  dude , we had that for last 100 years at least . 
  no one gives a shit at this point besides the small minority of politically active liberals . 
  at some age every russian starts considering a fucked up state of the country an inevitable evil . 
  plague doctor singed and no plague doctor swain . 
   just admit you done goofed and stop trying to be fancy with the changes, 
  meanwhile kog . 
  i mean rito , really , you 've changed him once again and he is still unbalanced instead of reversing the changes that made no sence even with the adc update . 
  we 've got [ these ] ( http://ivan-da-maria.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/xanons_visotki_31.jpg.pagespeed.ic.b0wdea6e2d.jpg ) beauties instead . 
  [ somebody said `` spoon '' ? 
  ] ( http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/spoon2.jpg ), 
  too inconsistent allegedly . 
  sometimes godlike , sometimes utter shit . 
  and no one knows what performance to expect . 
  at this point , i think , a whole lot of people want to see a new protagonist . 
  ash was never a strong character to begin with but after all these years he have n't developed one bit . 
  sanogo to arsenal . 
  you have strange fetishes , dude . 
  `` someone remembered yorick mori '' - yorick 2016, 
   since 1999, 
  the irony is that he have never seen arsenal other than ars\u00e8ne 's arsenal . 
  during the 90s the mob could easly break into your house and tell you to get the fuck out ( if they were in a kind mood ) . 
  and police if you went there would probably take your money and do nothing . 
  that was considered to be normal . 
  so putin or not today it is much safer in russia . 
  mysterious monkeys ? 
  that 's hove you name the team !, 
  so you are saying i will win after 50 games ? 
  seems like a huge improvement for me . 
  20 years ago i did . 
  wow . 
  someone still remembers him . 
  gibson stories were heavily influenced by noir fiction . 
  so you should probably look for a clues to female character representation there . 
  ex-hooker archetype feets noir setting pretty well for example . 
  so it also feets gibson 's cyberpunk . 
  so it ends . 
  now i 'm happy . 
  upd and people downvote me because how dare i to have my own opinion that is different from their 's . 
  50 % of tahm players are dostoyevskys . 
  makes sense . 
  i always compare starters to gen1 . 
  none have been as good . 
  sometimes there 1 or 2 good ones . 
  but still not good enough . 
  that 's of coarse is only how i see things . 
  chikorita is nice but nowhere near gen1 . 
  the problem is that some people tend to mark everything that is n't as cool as gen1 was as `` sucks '' . 
   vietnamese jungle god, 
  something something na tilted . 
  well , as a russian i like to see that ak-47 is still there . 
  alan tudyk is there . 
  so you are probably right . 
  chelsea fun ? 
  tell him to go fuck himself .
