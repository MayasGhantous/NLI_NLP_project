  so , are you in agreement with me ? 
  i 've met no one who believes this . 
  theres shit tons of people playing it . 
  this is pathetic propaganda trying to paint us as paranoid religious freaks or something . 
  one of our silly politicians ( we have quite a few clowns ) said something obviously stupid . 
  there are politicians and tv show hosts in america that claim video games is a form of satanic worship , but you never see russian media painting you all as batshit crazy retards . 
  yes , many of the caucasus republics have large indigenous christian populations . 
  stavropol krai and ossetia is majority christian ( ossetia has a large pagan minority . ), 
  should be safe , and the culture is awesome . 
  most of the western part of the north caucasus is pretty safe . 
  dagestan is something you might have to worry about because in the mountains there are still some ct ops going on there . 
  however , its really not as bad as it used to be . 
  terrorists in chechnya , ingushetia , and balkaria have been more or less defeated btw . 
  well russian census records everyone by ethnicity because russia is a multinational federation . 
  however , in the last census around 5 million people could not state it because they were counted through federal databases . 
  i was wondering if it was the same situation with the last hungarian census . 
  trump - incomprehensible orange faced fat fuck ; meme president, 
  clinton - ** kill it with fire **, 
  i know you have n't asked but i will answer for all the other candidates, 
  rubio - crimson chin, 
  ted cruz - pedophile, 
  nvidia cards use gpu boost technology . 
  the card overclocks itself and sets a maximum temp ( which is 80c ), 
  theres three, 
  wow , i totally did n't see that coming . 
  fuck you , op . 
  americans are definitely not the only ones who do this , but for fucks sake . 
  end the conflation between russia and the soviet union . 
  just because we are the legal successor state ( for political and nuclear reasons ) does n't mean we are the same entity or were . 
  stop using `` putin 's russia '' or `` russia 's putin '' . 
  its just retarded . 
  educate yourself in the politics or just general facts of other countries . 
  please take a look at all your countries actions in the last 20-30 years , especially when it comes to treaties and nato . 
  did the aliens who abducted and probed you tell you this shit ? 
  pyatt looks like he wants to get stumped . 
  you really have nothing better to do huh ? 
  there are some large cities like vladivostok , yakutsk , kharabovsk , ussuriysk . 
  its not very populated . 
  there is also the island of sakhalin which is very beautiful and many people live there as well . 
  to be entirely honest , the region is very underdeveloped . 
  the government is trying to change that by attempt to get people to move from the west of the country out to the east . 
  however , at the moment it is just a backwater region of the country . 
  oh come on , you guys are such teases . 
   what 's on the **     far eastern < < < < / asian ** side of russia ? 
   there are some large cities like ** vladivostok , yakutsk , kharabovsk , ussuriysk . 
  yes , some people practice slavic native faith however some of them are neo-nazis and are monitored by the state . 
  going on a hunger strike this time is going to be pretty easy for her in ukraine . 
  is that a ben `` straight outta auschwitz '' garrison cartoon ? 
  i say the americans should elect trump because memes, 
  happens to me every goddamn time and i fucking hate it with a fire of ten thousand suns . 
  and you get killed by some invisible shooter . 
  id really rather be playing the new version, 
  so this is how they spin things for americans, 
  lol no wonder they are so delusional . 
  i thought it was just something they ate , like big macs , that made them stupid . 
  guess i was wrong . 
   going on 9gag or pikabu, 
  whats . . whats wrong with you ? 
  i came, 
  the issues of weapon station stabilization was fixed with the btr-80a variant , which includes a new 30mm gun . 
  btr-80 is a very flawed apc , stabilization is just a little detail . 
  the entrance/exit for troops have proven to be so deadly that many troops just ride on top instead . 
  ( the side doors in that position and not in the back because of the placement of the engine ), 
  the army is replacing it with the bumerang . 
  btr-80a armor is the same as btr-80 . 
  the only thing that changed is the weapon station . 
  the armor 's thinness is a common feature in all soviet-era vehicles . 
  ( like the bmp ) and its role is comparable to the role of the american m113 or stryker series , has nothing to do with cargo . 
  the vehicle is a deathtrap like the bmp that is going to be replaced . 
  the btr-80a / 82a are stop-gaps that changed only firepower . 
  so i 'd say they are pretty lenient when it comes to hp for the btr . 
  the 2a72 ( bppu ) is the one used on the 80a and it is based off of the 2a42 which has a stabilizer . 
  82a def does have it and better protection against at mines . 
  sv-98 pls, 
  never ask a question you already know the answer to . 
  thats just pretentious and patronizing lol . 
  thanks for the info either way . 
   my point being , this guy has always had a shit attitude towards his fans ( read snob ) , bans people from commenting on his channel, 
  i do n't think you get his/his community 's insult-based humor . 
  most of his comments are filled with insults like `` you should kill yourself bb i < 3 u bluecunt6969 '', 
   ca n't formulate a coherent thought and is overall just childish as you can guess by his thumbnails and titles . 
  actually , he is a pretty well-spoken person . 
  he does n't speak elliptically as you claim . 
  ( he does n't talk like donald trump ) he just laughs way too much while hes talking , sometimes at his own jokes . 
  his thumbnails and titles poke fun at clickbait and youtube drama . 
  i do n't like the guy either - i just ca n't relate to his sense of humor , but i definitely do n't think he is a snob or a pos like a lot of people imply . 
  just some dude with a different perspective and way of going about things . 
  who the hell puts an unwritten nda on early access updates , especially after a preview has already been shown . 
  its cancer . 
  wtf does this have to do with anything . 
   bluedrake promised not to show any videos or upload any content before he got the key, 
  do you mean after he got the key ? 
  is there a source ( soundcloud/yt/vocaroo ) that proves that he said that ? 
  edit : a promise is n't legally binding either . 
  there really should have been an nda agreement , papers , etc. 
  although , it seems very stupid to have ndas for early access updates in the first place . 
  we paid for the game , we should be able to know about the development process and whats going on . 
  people showing new content being added to the game is n't going to make you lose potential customers or give an edge to a competitor . 
  i do n't understand why they want to keep a tight lid on updates that they themselves give previews and hints to . 
   bluedrake promised not to show any videos or upload any content before he got the key,
