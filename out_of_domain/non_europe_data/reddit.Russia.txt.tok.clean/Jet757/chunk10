  that means that if shit starts getting bad , you have options to escape the ice . 
  let 's see in da40 here are your options, 
  * wait it out, 
  * avoid it, 
  * climb out, 
  * descend through, 
  have somewhere either above or below to go if ice starts accumulating rapidly . 
  if you choose above , then how powerful is your plane and will it last if you experience severe icing all through the climb out ? 
  how big is the layer on top ? 
  how long will it take you to get there ? 
  in a single engine piston most of the time climbing out is n't an option because you do n't have the muscle for it . 
  so your best option is to get below it . 
  so if was to fly that flight , i 'd just bear the turbulence . 
  ice is way worse, 
  the guy who lives next to me has a black c3 corvette that thing sounds mean , but he barely drives . 
  i think it just ca n't pass inspection so he just does a spin around the block every now and then . 
  there 's also a guy with a 2016 mustang gt350 somewhere nearby , i see him all the time but i do n't know where he lives . 
  the guy living two houses over has red e46 m3 , he also rarely drives though . 
  that 's really cool man , i love new edge stangs . 
  i thought about throwing a supercharger on it , but i 'm afraid to blow up the engine as i 'm using it as a fun daily . 
  i 'm running a stock block with a cai , flowmasters , 3.73 gears , bama tune & a short throw shifter . 
  how many miles does your engine have on it ? 
  and did you do any pre-supercharger mods to it ? 
  well first of all :, 
  one of us, 
  one of us, 
  one of us, 
  one of us, 
  one of us, 
  but aside from that in the words of great red foreman : ** do n't be a dumbass ** and you should be fine . 
  you 'll want to do a lot of things , so ask yourself . 
  `` would a dumbass do this ? '', 
  and if the answer is yes , do n't do it . 
  keep in mind that some people may envy you and there 's nothing you can do about it . 
  so just avoid conflict with those people . 
  welcome to the club kid . 
  [ give these a try , they rarely run out of batteries ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=terminal+approach+procedures&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjcsvwcquzmahvdthokhwuqayeq_auiccgc&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=809#tbm=isch&amp;q=us+terminal+procedures+publication&amp;imgrc=thxqtyyunwsgsm%3a ) jk i use the mini . 
  i found that there are n't that many phases of flights when i use it . 
  maybe if i get a dp or on approach or if some weather pops up out of nowhere , but aside from that i never touch it . 
  that 's why i went with the smallest/cheapest option mini 1 . 
  we have 2 cars with us . 
  we 're going to be coming from all ford nationals in carlisle, 
  thank you !, 
  thanks a lot, 
  yeah i figured hahaha . 
  i 've fit 2 foldable bikes into a 152 . 
  now that was fun , had to fly 3hrs with a bike tire to the back of my head, 
  i second that . 
  me ride was a joke compared to the single engine commercial . 
  those maneuvers can be a real pain . 
  to this day i never believe anyone who says they can do a good lazy 8 . 
  i do n't , i do n't have anything outstanding done to the car , if somebody asks i 'll show them , but otherwise it seems tacky to me with a fairly stock engine . 
   they 're interested in stability , of which there has not been a lot in russia over the last century or so . 
  as long as putin can provide the country with a satisfactory level of stability , he will be in power , whether or not the elections are rigged . 
  whether this is a good thing or a bad thing is another long and complicated discussion , however . 
  this . 
  so much this . 
  another russian here and this is the part that most foreigners do n't understand about russian politics . 
  i 'm almost tired of explaining this phenomena to my american friends who frequently ask about putin . 
  i might just print this comment out as a pamphlet and hand it out to people whenever i get asked this question .

  your neckbeard is showing, 
  making fun of him would be like shooting a puppy in the head with a .50 cal . 
  i do n't want to sink that low . 
  he 's just a kid . 
  honestly , me too, 
  yeah , he was really good , but the stadium was only half full when he started playing . 
  and it was gnr ` so show so a lot of people were n't really there to see him, 
  yeah , he was really good , but the stadium was only half full when he started playing .

  people like you diminish my desire to go to burning man .

  well , if you 're in vmc or encounter vmc and it 's prevailing you have to remain vmc and land as soon as practical . 
  if not then :, 
  it 's assigned , vectored , expected and then filed . 
  as far as altitude it 's the highest of mea , expected or assigned, 
  once you get to your destination , you have to hold until you reach your eta . 
  once you reach your eta at the airport you can start an approach . 
  and if it is n't you should probably delete it from here . 
  you never know who 's looking . 
  that 's why you do n't let student pilots tell you the airplane is good to fly . 
   it 's all set we 're good to go . 
   * looks to the oil dipstick sitting on the wing *, 
   uh-huh yeah , right, 
  * explain seatbelts, 
  * tell them to stfu until we 're safely at our destination . 
  i 'm a real joy to fly with . 
  have n't had a passenger in years now . 
  unfortunately there is a lot of scum out there in the world and aviation is no exception . 
  they 're just harder to spot in this industry because aviation is very good at keeping up clean appearances . 
  i hope everything goes well for you, 
  cheers !, 
  examiners are discouraged from acting as a pic on checkrides . 
  it 's a test of your judgement and abilities , not theirs . 
  you must act pic . 
  as a non ir pilot you ca n't act pic under real ifr because you do n't hold an ir . 
  ( this is where the important difference where logging vs. acting pic is crucial ) so the only ir rated pilot becomes the dpe , so therefore he must act pic . 
  some dpes do that , but very few . 
  their ass is on the line if you fuck up .
