  most of the time they are flying with you for the first time . 
  think of it like this :, 
  not to undermine your piloting skills , but if i was offered to get into a plane and sit right seat with a guy i never met with a wet ir , fly in 700/1 , and be the one legally responsible for the flight , i would n't do it . 
  so i 'm sure that came into play too . 
  absolutely normal , especially if you 're in a dead airport with nothing going on , also you 're not clogging up approach if they 're busy . 
  getting you ff might be the most exciting thing they do that day jk . 
  never used jep charts , but i ca n't seem to find the faf on there . 
  would n't there still be a gs intercept altitude that would serve as your faf ? 
  you got it dude . 
  best of luck on your ride . 
  remember that you do n't have to date someone just for the sake of not being alone . 
  there is real love out there . 
  you will find it . 
  god bless you sir . 
  if you got ta shoot an approach behind a jet , stay one dot above on the glide slope to remain clear of the wake . 
  [ how about this ?

  smoke vape everyday brah, 
  hey man you 're 4 hours away , you can knock that out in less than a week including the check ride . 
  but only you know your own priorities , so make sure you have them set straight . 
  cheers,

  so better hit the gym . 
  but no you do n't need to be that strong . 
  i fly aerial survey . 
  quite often there 're as many as 4 company airplanes over the same small area all at pretty much the same altitude . 
  a lot of sites also lay over airports . 
  we all talk to each other over company but we are also on flight following . 
  there 's quite a bit of planning that goes into it , but sometimes we get some pissy controllers . 
  usually we get a `` do n't they have satellites for this ? '', 
  but some guys act like you 're a thorn in their side . 
  then you just kill them with kindness . 
  on some very rare occasions if it 's not too busy , we 'll all just cancel advisories and monitor the frequency . 
  that 's because he flew two airliners into the wtc .

  ask away !, 
  * if you 're running low on fuel and do n't want to buy gas you can dilute 100ll with water to increase your range . 
  * when shooting an ils in heavy precipitation be very careful because the glideslope gets very slippery and you can fall and lose your medical, 
  i know right . 
  how is a1 ? 
  i have n't been there in a while, 
  thats good to hear man . 
  tell everyone i say hi . 
  yeah i 'm surveying all over the place until june or so . 
  it 's weather dependent but on a good day it 's at least 5 + hours . 
  currently working the hudson river . 
  thx dude , you 're still flying helis for the army ? 
  and no , i realized that i just do n't want to work there . 
  it 's been a good place for a while , but it 's not the right move right now . 
  that 30k contract is no bueno . 
  yeah that was my reasoning . 
  the regionals will hire anyone with the mins and a pulse right now . 
  got ta seize the moment while it 's here . 
  sucks to hear that man , cause that 's a cool gig . 
  are you planning to stick with the army or gon na try to hop into an rj at some point ? 
  the real question you wan na answer is how sure you are that you want to go into the industry . 
  a lot of people wash out - it 's a reality . 
  that business degree with chem minor will give you a viable back up plan . 
  you could get your first real taste of the industry by getting your ppl while in college . 
  it 's doable . 
  you could do it in a summer if you play your cards right . 
  you could also go to atp flight school after college . 
  for 60k they 'll get you all of your ratings from ppl to cpl me & cfi in under a year . 
  from there you could work as a cfi and get your hours . 
  i never went to atp but i know people who did who were pretty happy with it . 
  professional survey [ c17dash2 ] ( http://sportysnetwork.com/airfacts/wp-content/blogs.dir/13/files/2012/05/new-172-2.jpg ) driver here . 
  for ipad i do n't use it that much , it 's a bit of a distraction tbh , you 'll be flying in some airspaces with tons of yahoos so i only use it for taxi/appchs . 
  i leave mine on the co pilot seat . 
  gatorade bottles are a must dude . 
  no coffee or tea in the morning , even a little bit will go through you mad quick . 
  keep a liter of water in the plane but never drink more than half of it . 
  you know what 's worse than having to piss in a plane ? 
  having to shit in a plane , so avoid foods that you know will give you the shits . 
  snacks are important too for inflight meals . 
  overall just keep busy , it can get really lonely . 
  so remember to go out and have fun . 
  even the most podonk towns have something interesting in them . 
  books/kindle are a must so is netflix . 
  overpacking is better than under packing , you can always send things home , but it will be hard to get things shipped out to you . 
  i started writing letters and picked up my journal again , keeps me busy . 
  i also haul an electric guitar and a small amp around . 
  i carry a survival bag with me just in case as well . 
  you should be safer in the aztank , but it 's still a good idea . 
  i got some flint/steel , tarp , rope , canned food and other miscellaneous goodies , people may make fun of you , but i 'm not about to fly a chickenhawk across the u.s. without a plan b. 
  a personal gps is a good idea too , a few guys have them , i have n't gotten one yet though . 
  edit : a headset with mp3 capability is a big plus, 
  well , i make sure to crap before i go out for a flight so that usually eliminates the problem , but if you do you land . 
  it just makes for an awkward phone call to headquarters . 
  and an awkward radio call .
