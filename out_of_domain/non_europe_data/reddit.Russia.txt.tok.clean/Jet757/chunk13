  ask for a different instructor and see if anything will change , keep in mind though that will set you back a few hours because no cfi will sign off a student pilot that they never flew with before on a solo xc without personally flying with him to verify his capability . 
   amateur aviation community, 
  oh this is going to be fun to watch * grabs popcorn *, 
   pilots looove to complain, 
  this . 
  if i logged all the hours that i bitch about shit , i 'd have an atp in being a dick, 
  well it already is , its called dic , dick in command . 
  when you fly solo you 're single pilot dic, 
  [ that 's about a gram of yayo , i 'd get that .

  juts flew 350 miles today in a chickenhawk 2hrs of which were in imc . 
  no stormscope , but there was n't any precip forecast . 
  just look at the forecasts , use good judgement and leave yourself an out . 
  i was never a crewmemeber , but i 've def used my airline i.d. 
  to cut the line . 
  only on a few occasions though , i do n't like to abuse it , but it does come in handy . 
  you got ta take advantage every so often . 
  when life gives you oranges , make a screwdriver . 
  [ you need this ] ( http://cdn-www.airliners.net/photos/airliners/9/9/2/0552299.jpg?v=v40 ), 
  i highly second this . 
  except aztanks are pigs , so fuel would be $ $ $ . 
  but it 's a highly under-rated twin . 
  has more muscle than most light twins of the same caliber too . 
  this is my fav youtube pilot . 
  most other aviation channels just annoy me for some reason . 
  but this guy is a boss . 
  just flying no other bs, 
  if you want to go to the airlines most require a degree . 
  does n't matter in what , but you got ta have a bachelor 's . 
  have you thought about studying and flying at the same time ? 
  i do n't mean to rain on your parade , but i 'd leave her on the ground man . 
  it almost sounds like some sort of a date , and if i guessed right , i 'll tell you to never take a girl up for a first date . 
  not until you 're a handful of dates in or you 're already dating her . 
  here 's why :, 
  * she 's already a bit nervous going on a first date , do n't throw a small airplane into it, 
  * a lot of things can go wrong mx/wx that can screw up the night and then you 're scrambling for plan b, 
  * it 's really hard to follow that up , the bar is set pretty high, 
  * you do n't use your trump cards early in the game, 
  * and last but not least , that shit gets expensive , do n't throw your hard earned $ $ $ just at any girl,

  [ you 're ennnn guardeee , terminal d as in dog ] ( https://youtu.be/yoze0ne60sk?t=4m2s ), 
  looks like a graveyard spiral to me, 
  [ these are pretty good , they do tend to get lost though ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/lockheed_10a_electra_excc.jpg ), 
  does that come with a blowjob and some yayo ? 
  if sully watched mr.aviation101 , then us1549 would 've made teb . 
  aopa renters insurance will run you about $ 250 if you have about 50hrs . 
  it will go down with additional ratings , recency and flight time . 
  it 's a good thing to have overall . 
  my place did n't require it , but i still got it just in case while i was working on my ir and cpl, 
  higher end headsets have built in bluetooth . 
  [ these ] ( http://www.lightspeedaviation.com/sierra_series/subgrouping.htm?cat=32798 ) are the most affordable ones on the market . 
  just something to look at . 
  ** provincetown ma ** is great if you like shooting the back course ( giggity ) perfect place for an overnight trip , good night life . 
  the water is cold though even in summer . 
  ** there 're many bars in town . 
  ** block island ri ** - the bike ride to the beach is 10 min , hotels are expensive , ** bars are far away ** . 
  ** lawrence , new bedford , plymouth , beverly ma ** all have decent cafes . 
  new bedford has a ** bar ** , other do not . 
  ** portsmith nh ** - cheap fuel , the town is meh . 
  the restaurant at the golf course is ok and ** has a bar ** . 
  ** portland me ** - expensive ramp fees , but a great city to visit . 
  ** lots of bars ** and restaurants downtown . 
  ** hartford ct ** - ** has a bar **, 
  ** groton ct ** has a submarine museum if you 're into that . 
  ** there 's also a bar ** not too far away from the airport . 
  do n't go to ack or the vine , both are overrated . 
  the bars are expensive . 
  in new bedford do n't go into the town if you do n't want to get shot . 
  taunton , mansfield and norwood are all really boring - ** no bars ** . 
  is there a bar ? 
  sold leaving the bar in rsw right now omw to the airport, 
  # #thingsilearnedfromsloan #dontdrinkandfly #youmightspillsomething, 
  very true . 
  the best instructors i 've ever met however , were trying to get hours for the airlines , but i feel like they have agreed with themselves that it will take a while so they provided some of the best instruction because they were n't rushing to right seat of the e170 , which in turn allowed them to put their students first . 
  i 'd love to have become an instructor , and maybe eventually i will , but right now i 'm just too selfish in getting flight time to instruct . 
  i think you meant to post that here --  / r/shittyaskflying, 
  man that 's a real piece of history . 
  congrats on the solo . 
  i flew a harambe for survey , even got approach to say it back to me a few times most notably :, 
  * 36harambe has the field *, 
  * 36harambe cleared visual 28l at cmh keep the speed up *, 
  * 36harambe will be coming in swinging , cleared for the visual 28l *, 
  i had a lot of fun with that tail sign, 
  i ca n't wait for this episode of forensic files, 
  * `` she took his dignity , so he took her life '' *, 
  this was awesome , really cool stuff . 
  would n't it be kinda hard to hear the guy over the sound of the accordion anyway ? 
  there was once a man from nantucket ... 
  who only flew vfr and said f *** it, 
  he cruised with a mile, 
  until he touched down at the vine, 
  that 's when the faa came around to f *** him, 
  ^ whoops ^ wrong ^ subreddit ^ never ^ mind . 
  i completely agree with you . 
  covering your ass is vital . 
  from the pilot perspective , you can always just get a pop up . 
  if the field went to shit , i 'm sure atc wo n't mind . 
  or you can just call up an rco if it 's like ny bravo or something . 
  if you 're departing , you can just take the extra 2mins to file , there 's an app for that and once you reach vfr conditions you can always cancel . 
  that makes everyone 's life easier , the pilot has an ifr clearance and atc does n't have to worry about that oddball vfr that is flying into less than marginal conditions .
