  all hail cutiee hazloaddz, 
  [ it 's real ] ( http://www.shinyjetsyndrome.com/images/gojetwatchdog/freekandy2.jpg ), 
  using up all my vape juice . 
  i ca n't fly and not look fly while i fly . 
  because nixon, 
  that 's more like an emergency checklist . 
  everybody knows eaa young eagles do n't get laid . 
  i do n't fly with a crew , but i 've been sharing hotels , rental cars , ate breakfast , lunch , dinner and hung out with the same co-workers for weeks and some times months at a time . 
  just fyi i 'm not much of a people person . 
  so this is what works for me :, 
  * jokes . 
  i try to make fun out of everything that happens to me . 
  kinda like a bill burr / louis ck type of routine . 
  when i get stuck on an assignment with someone who 's not my cup of tea , i just think about how comedic the situation is and laugh about it to myself . 
  * i try to vent the shit out . 
  not necessarily to another person , but in a physical sense . 
  sometimes it 's cursing something or someone out once i 'm in my hotel room where no one is listening . 
  sometimes i use the frustration on a punching bag at the gym or while exercising . 
  i know that when i snap , it usually happens because of something small finally lands on top of a mountain of shit that 's already pissing me off . 
  so i attempt to prevent this mountain from accumulating . 
  * i try to remind myself that everyone got their own fucking cockroaches inside their head . 
  people i work with all have their own lives and i 'm pretty sure they 're not always happy either . 
  i 'm sure i do plenty of shit that annoys them too . 
  so i know i 'm no where close to a little bundle of joy . 
  * after hours i avoid talking about work . 
  i love my job and i 'm very excited about it , but i do n't want it to wear out on me . 
  music , hobbies , sports , politics , aspirations , your mother 's cooking , whatever but not work . 
  * while i know small things can really piss me off , there are a lot of small things i enjoy so i try to notice more enjoyable small things and disregard the annoying small things . 
  * oh also i 'm a raging alcoholic , so that helps too ^ justkidding ^ ami ? ^ plzhelp, 
  idk if this helps in anyway , but here ya go man . 
  edit : grammar, 
  safe crash landing without da chute ??? 
  what kind of magic is this ? 
  you mean like tinderbook developed by screw sched ? 
  i can picture it now :,

  it 's just some headsets that people like . 
  they preach them religiously and wont stfu about how if you got a different headset you 're really missing out . 
  well there was sort of mx . 
  they did change oil on the plane and some other minor stuff . 
  i called dibs on harambe420 a loooooong time ago , so do n't even think about that one .

  put your foot down . 
  if your wife 's friends get offended about the question , they can go to a fucking tiki bar , while you go flying on your own with your wife . 
  you 're spending your own time and money trying to take them on a fun trip this is already really nice of you . 
  they are your wife 's friends , not yours . 
  you do n't owe them shit . 
  and of course if a fight does erupt you can throw in the :, 
   get hotter friends, 
  just for shits and giggles . 
  that should make for an entertaining drive home . ^ thisiswhyimnotmarried, 
  check the side bar .

  soooo ... out of all characters on the show you find her the most hateful one ? 
  claire is lightyears ahead of her in that department . 
  also reasons people respect others vary greatly from person to person . 
  zoie 's no angel , but i liked her character . 
  she was smart , ambitious and resourceful . 
  yes she got in way to deep , but she also had no idea what frank had in plans .
