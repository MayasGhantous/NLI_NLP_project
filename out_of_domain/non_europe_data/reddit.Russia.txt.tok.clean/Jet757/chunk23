  we experience all of that on a daily basis . 
  and it 's easy to forget how exciting and mysterious the world of professional flying was to me when i was in flight school . 
  we 're both getting older . 
  i believe that his primary audience does n't fly regularly for hire , nor do they fly a hp tbm . 
  if his videos keep people inspired then more power to him . 
  seems like the old guy was one of those airport folks who ran out of people that 'd listen to his stories . 
  they 'll never raise a caravan sic job to that though . 
  most likely it 's an insurance thing that 's why they have an sic . 
  those pilots have a choice too . 
  they can instruct/do whatever other cpl flying get 600-800hrs tt and hop on some 135 pc12/beech 99/brazilia as an sic and get payed more than 18k . 
  it 's a matter of choice . 
  in the end of the day nobody is holding a gun to their head making them accept that job . 
  some cfi jobs pay damn well nowadays . 
  well that 's the problem my friend . 
  ignorance and desperation for a job . 
  nobody is forcing anyone to go work there . 
  the real wake up call for mokulele will be inability to crew their planes . 
  but as long as there are youtube channels bragging about how cool it is to live hawaii & make 18k flying a caravan it 's not going to happen . 
  and they themselves would never raise the wage , because it 's not in the interest of the business . 
  this youtube guy is being played by them really hard . 
  edit : spelling, 
  well , idk if he is oblivious to the effects of his actions ( i think he very well maybe , he seems like the cool air drinker type ) , but he does give off an `` i 'm better than you '' vibe . 
  oh heeesa not the president , meesa the president . 
  meesa darth tom yates, 
  pull that big red lever all the way towards yourself in cruise . 
  wakes you right up . 
  but it could be from mental exhaustion too . 
  ( i 'm not implying that you 're stupid just to be clear ) mentally challenging work load can lead to tiredness just as much as physical exhaustion . 
  i slept through most of physics courses in college for that very reason . 
  it looks like they made a sitcom out of that `` drunk on a plane '' music video . 
  ehhh this show 's gon na suck . 
  where that flight dvd at ? 
  the fo is wearing the stripes backwards too , just noticed, 
  check out mraviation420 . 
  i want to be like him when i grow up . 
  but seriously flight chops has some great stuff . 
  his bits on mountain flying and tailwheel vids were my favorite ones . 
  and my personal favorite is guido warnecke that guy makes flying a jet solo look easy . 
  i never knew that a caravan is an airliner until he explained it to me . 
  what a nice guy . 
  um ... anything over 8000ft is definitely harder in a 152 . 
  enjoy it !, 
  i 'm a watch guy and i often pick whatever one i 'm in the mood for , but at work i usually pick [ this seiko ] ( http://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server3500/a8756/products/2803/images/6269/seiko_prospex_ssc425__18128.1453149052.600.600.jpg?c=2 ) i 've only used the dial twice but i just think it 's cool . 
  that hamilton looks fantastic my friend, 
  i just got an automatic the other day . 
  but i 'll def check it out, 
  this should be higher . 
  you got ta pay yourself first . 
  i do n't see anything wrong with calling back and turning down a job offer if it 's done in a respectful and timely manner . 
  it 's a free country , you do n't owe them shit . 
  also good strategy i learned about if you 're interviewing with airlines for the first time was to interview at the places you do n't want to work first . 
  so you 're better prepped for the interview at the company where you actually want to work . 
  git outta here you loch ness monstah , i aint givin you no tree fiddy, 
  neither matches the sleek lines of a boeing 757, 
  i 'm a freight dog . 
  lol the shorts did n't get voted the prom king haha . 
  they used to be small regional airliners in the 80s , but since they 're not pressurized they were quickly passed over in favor of the dash and the atr . 
  but the shape of it made it an excellent freighter . 
  fed ex/ups/dhl love us cause we can haul a lot of bulk . 
  do n't forget [ the hat ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/tin_foil_hat_2.jpg ), 
  this should be posted in the sidebar .

  you also declare at some point and figure out where you 're gon na go and what you 're gon na do, 
  he just may be shy . 
  or he could be one of those people that do n't ask a lot of questions . 
  my ex gf used to give me crap for that a lot haha . 
  did he talk a lot about himself ? 
  cause that can be a fine line between him being just shy and self centered . 
  did he ask anything about you ? 
  at all ? 
  if not then that 's weird . 
  my reason for not asking a lot of questions is that i personally do n't enjoy when people dig into my background deep right away ( now i know that that 's the whole point of a date , and i 've gotten better at it ) so i do n't really dig too deep into other people . 
  your hometown ? 
  education ? 
  movies ? 
  books ? 
  sure , but i 'm not gon na sit there on the second date and ask `` so how was your relationship with your father ? '', 
  i think when she 's comfortable enough with me she 'll tell my what she wants/needs to tell . 
  actions speak louder than words . 
  tl ; dr no it 's not weird . 
  well i 'll say it . 
  dude you 're overthinking it . 
  you 're setting these superficial parameters for yourself , and that 's holding you back .
