  the winds were light . 
  we took off out kpym rwy 24 simulating the first leg of our xc . 
  he told me to maintain 4500 . 
  my first take off was a soft field . 
  i intercepted the gps course to kwbw and we went on our way . 
  he asked to demonstrate how would i know where i was if my gps failed . 
  i used pvd and mvy vors to get my position . 
  he asked how i 'd do it in an unknown location without any navs , i stated that i 'd circle , climb , contact approach ask for my position and ask for vectors to land and comply with their instructions . 
  by that time we were over ktan and he instructed me to do a steep spiral to a short field landing in ktan , my point was the very beginning of the rwy ( the real deal ) . 
  i said that in the flying brick we would n't have enough alt . 
  to do 3 360 degree turns so we climbed to 6500 . 
  i used this time to set up the freq . 
  and get the wx . 
  i came down at about 45 degree bank and 125mph , gear and flaps up . 
  i set up for left downwind for rwy30 . 
  i entered downwind about 700ft high , so i left the power out and lowered the gear and 10 flaps while also extending the downwind leg . 
  the landing was to the pts , a bit rough but safe , but we made the first taxiway easily . 
  we taxied back and stayed in the pattern for a landing to a go around , and went for another lap for a power off 180 . 
  after we departed the area back towards kpym , i leveled out at 3000 . 
  we started with steep turns , then did a 1 chandelle and finished with a 3 lazy eights . 
  after that was done he told me to descend back down to 3000 and fly a heading of 030 . 
  i realized that he was going to pull the engine so i started looking for a landing spot early . 
  i picked a cranberry bog and advised that i was going to do a gear up landing to avoid the wheels digging in . 
  we broke off about 600agl . 
  the approach was good . 
  we climbed to 1100 for 8s on pylons . 
  after those we returned to pym and performed a soft field landing . 
  that was the end of the checkride . 
  just passed the commercial multi ride , wanted to share for anyone who is interested . 
  ** oral **, 
  he started out by quizzing me on the pts standards . 
  that was a bit unexpected but i remembered them from my initial commercial ride . 
  he then explained all the possible outcomes of the test . 
  pass , letter of discontinuance and the letter of disapproval . 
  he also pointed out the special emphasis areas to me and pretty much told me that it 's in my best interest not to fuck any of them up . 
  this dpe was a no bullshit type guy , out of the 4 guys that i did my rides with , he was the toughest one . 
  he straight up told me what he 'd fail me on . 
  and that was anything that was n't to the pts . 
  a lot of dpes have their own `` preferences '' for how they want you to do things so i prefer to go up with a `` by the book '' guys as i feel more at ease since i know what to expect . 
  he gave me some performance problems first . 
  accelerate stop and distance over a 50ft obstacle . 
  i cranked those out and he was happy with them . 
  he then asked about factors to consider when flying a multi . 
  i fired back with all the usual pre flight action and made special emphasis on accelerate go and stop distances , da , w&b & cg as well as single engine service ceiling . 
  i related a lot of it to the departure airport elevation and runway available and how i 'd go about experiencing an engine out after t/o . 
  he was content with that . 
  he asked what would i do if i took off at max t/o weight from a short field and had an engine out . 
  i said that i 'd find a nearby longer field and land at over max landing weight i reasoned that trying to burn off 200lbs of fuel on one engine at full power is too risky and i want to get on the ground asap . 
  i 'd declare and have an ap examine the gear after the landing . 
  he was happy with the answer . 
  we talked about the fuel and the landing gear systems , we also touched on the power plant and the props . 
  i explained the feathering lock as well as hartzell harmonic dampeners that eliminated the caution range on the rpm . 
  he gave me some scenarios about landing gear malfunctions and how i would handle them . 
  the final part of the oral was a discussion about vmc . 
  i explained what it is and why it happens . 
  he asked how it changes with da & why . 
  i mentioned air density and reduced engine efficiency at high altitudes are the main contributing factors , i also made sure to relate it to stall speed . 
  because with the seneca 1 , stall speed and vmc are the same at a certain altitude and the pilot has to be aware of that because a stalling an a/c on one engine can make for a very shitty afternoon . 
  ** the flight **, 
  on the take off roll he yelled `` fuck , there 's a cow on the runway ! '', 
  and i aborted the take off , we continued as a short field take off after that . 
  vr , + rate , gear up . 
  flaps up at 100agl . 
  at 500agl he failed an engine with the throttle . 
  i pitched over to maintaine vyse and ran through the flows . 
  he gave the engine back at 1200agl . 
  after leveling off at 3000 we cleared the area and did slow flight . 
  after the first turn in slow flight he prompted me to execute a power off stall with a turn . 
  upon recovery he asked for a power on one . 
  no biggie . 
  steep turns were next . 
  in the middle of the second turn he failed an engine with the fuel selector . 
  i ran through the flows and got it back . 
  then he asked for a vmc demo . 
  no surprises there either . 
  he then warned me that my left engine oil temperature was high and the oil pressure was rapidly dropping . 
  i reasoned that the engine was gon na quit/catch fire soon and opted to shut it down . 
  after the engine was completely shut down he let me unfeather it and restart it . 
  he put me under the hood and gave me vectors for the ils back to the airport . 
  i set up the radios , got the weather and was expecting a circling approach . 
  when the locolizer came alive he failed the left engine . 
  i attempted a restart - unseccesful , and told him that which engine i 'd feather . 
  he set 0 thrust to it . 
  shot the ils and circled to land on one engine . 
  approach and landing were uneventful . 
  and there you have it . 
  hope this was useful/entertaining . 
  - cheers, 
  hello / r/mustang, 
  i 'm looking to buy a 2001 gt vert . 
  it has 103k and the asking price is 8000 . 
  i 'm going to take it to a pre buy inspection . 
  what are some items to watch out for for this car as far as maintenance goes . 
  and is 8000 a fair deal ? 
  the car is the deluxe package so it comes with all the bells and whistles . 
  i read some mixed reviews about the dealership and i want to be prepared when i get there . 
  thanks, 
  hello / r/cars i have question for you guys, 
  i 'm looking into buying a car of craigslist and i ran the vin and got [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/ieoxqmu ) carfax report . 
  it shows that there 's possible odometer roll back .
