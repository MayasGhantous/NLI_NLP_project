  edit : formatting, 
  that 's a good topic . 
  my main axe is a les paul copy that i got for $ 200 . 
  it sounds and plays phenomenal and i recorded two albums with it . 
  but beyond anything your skill level will be the biggest factor . 
  you could give an ibanez evo jem to a beginner and it will suck , and you can give a $ 100 squier to steve vai and it will rock . 
  with that said here 's what i know makes a difference . 
  * ** keeping your instrument clean ** this is a huge one and one of the most under rated . 
  how you do it is a whole separate conversation . 
  * fresh strings before big/important shows & before recording anything, 
  * adjusting the action & intonation, 
  * swapping out the pick-ups, 
  * sanding down the high gloss neck for increased speed ( it works but i personally have n't done it to any of my instruments ), 
  * installing new springs for a tremolo tailpiece, 
  * installing a bigger block for the tremolo, 
  this is just stuff from the top of my head , but i hope it helps, 
  - cheers,

  thanks man , i appreciate it . 
  not a silly question at all . 
  he failed the one outside the turn . 
  and yes i immediately rolled out and started fixing it . 
  i just saw it last night , i think it felt short for me a little bit , maybe i hyped it up for myself too much . 
  it 's a good film do n't get me wrong , but it 's not his best . 
  middle of the line as far as tarantino films go . 
  i think my main problem with it was for a 3hr run time there was a lack of diversity in settings . 
  it 's the same idea that made rd so great - confined spaces and slowly brewing tension as well as multiple unanswered questions . 
  it made for excellent opportunities for character development . 
  however a lot of this screen time is used more for instilling a sense of atmosphere , which was the best aspect of the film for me , but leaves some characters underdeveloped . 
  rd was a lot shorter which worked better with the confined space . 
  however in h8 the runtime is too long for this to work as effectively . 
  jackson 's character was the best written one easily , but i ca n't say the same thing for j. leigh 's . 
  she 's wanted for murder . 
  i 'd loved to get some insight into why she did it . 
  instead it 's just a slapstick answer along the lines of `` because she 's in a gang and she 's bad '' as opposed to the antagonist in ib , where we understand that despite being the jew hunter landa is a man who has understanding on how the world works and slithers his way into comfortable positions . 
  i 'll have to watch it again in , i 'm def going to buy it . 
  maybe i 'll like it more second time around . 
  it 's taking off - flaps are at a smaller setting than they would be for a landing, 
  source - i 'm a pilot, 
  as low as you can get it . 
  and do n't forget the shades , bitches dig that . 
  you 'll be the top daug at the fbo, 
  in my non a&p opinion it 's less about the cooling but more about rapid addition of power . 
  just like after starting an engine on a cold day most manufacturers do not recommend high power settings immediately without letting the engine warm up . 
  let 's say you re flying in winter and you 're in a long descent . 
  if you get down to your initial approach altitude and level off some may stipulate that the rapid power addition could be harmful because the engine cooled down . 
  which it would be if you were a flying a piece of shit plane , in a descent your engine temperature should still be in the normal operating range so that really should n't be a concern . 
  but if you were in a twin and shut down an engine completely and then restarted it . 
  setting a higher power setting emmidiately can cause damage . 
  thanks man . 
  the kbb shows it high too . 
  but the reason i 'm considering it , it 's because there 's only like 3 other manual convertibles within 100 miles of me and this one has the lowest miles and i really want a vert . 
  it 's a car lot dealership , i 'm definitely going to have a mechanic look at it first . 
  i checked the carfax and it seems to be ok . 
  thanks man, 
  good call thank you, 
  you 're the kind of the guy that reports low flying airplanes as they 're doing ground reference maneuvers are n't you ? 
  is it legal ? 
  well sorta . 
  according to [ 91.21 ] ( http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?node=14:2.0.1.3.10.1.4.11 ) it 's ok if you 're operating under part 91 , not under ifr and the pic has determined that the equipment you 're using does not interfere with nav and comm capabilities of the aircraft . 
  if you fuck up , well there 's [ 91.13 ] ( http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div8&amp;node=14:2.0.1.3.10.1.4.7 ) for that, 
  is it dangerous ? 
  sometimes . 
  definitely in the pattern . 
  will people do it ? 
  absolutely . 
  what can you do about it ? 
  see and avoid . 
  aside from that nothing . 
  so honestly focus on what you 're doing in the plane to avoid dangerous situations as opposed to what other people are doing in their planes to create them . 
  cheers mate, 
  edit : spelling, 
  [ lol ok guy ] ( http://gph.is/1ehn35v ), 
  i agree with you 100 % . 
  i 'm not a cfi , and i probably wo n't become one , but i would n't approve of that if i was . 
  because before he has a ppl he 's riding on my ticket and it 's my ass on the line if the student fucks up . 
  if i saw my student have a picture on his fb or ig in the pattern we 'd have a nice talk about adm & risk management . 
  [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/bqluivg ) is def not safe . 
  with that said i hate seeing this * vigilantism * in flying . 
  and op 's post is a pretty good example of that . 
  exactly : my friend took that picture while i was flying . 
  people just do n't always know what 's going on board and love to jump down someone 's throat under the pretext of safety . 
  dude i think i may know that type of cheif . 
  i flew under a guy that sounds just like that . 
  found a picture of [ you ] ( http://imgur.com/loysnkg ), 
  yeah that 's what i 'm thinking . 
  i 'm going to take a close look at the condition of it . 
  60k do n't go without other traces . 
  thanks a lot . 
  lol . 
  that 's a good way to put it . 
  yeah it 's a more expensive model , it looks like it was a summer car for some rich dude on long island for a few months and then he got rid of it . 
  then it went through a few owners after and everything there checks out . 
  go back to cali hippie . 
  jk welcome to ma . 
  it 's just as beautiful to fly here as in cali . 
  the snow 's been picking up a bit lately . 
  and the next few days are going to be cold , so you 're here just in time . 
  here are some things to look out for . 
  * preheat your plane if you keep it outside .
