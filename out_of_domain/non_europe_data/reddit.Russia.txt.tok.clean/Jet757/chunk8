  go worry about your wallet , not someone else 's . 
  op is excited about his new car , and i bet you your $ 13 x 45hr per week that he does n't want to hear your backhanded financial advice . 
  he 's an adult and can make his own decisions . 
  the starter issue is less serious than the leaking gasket imo . 
  if anything replacing that would cost a lot less than replacing a head gasket ( if you 're not doing it yourself ) . 
  i 'd say have plus the vert has 70k more miles on it , that 's a lot man . 
  verts are also heavier and overall require more maintenance i really wanted a vert , but i live in the northeast and decided against it last moment . 
  my 03 gt has a short shifter and a flowmaster and those are a blast . 
  the nice thing about the flowmaster is that it has a beautiful sound , but you 're not ruining anyone 's day if you shift at or below 3000 . 
  however you can really let it roar at higher rpms . 
  these are just my $ .02 hope it helps . 
  how heavy are we talking ? 
  because a lot of muscle cars have a fairly heavy clutch , but if it 's too heavy it may indicate a worn out clutch . 
  yeah do n't go for a salvage car , that 's usually way more pain in the ass than it 's worth . 
  hm , that 's not normal then . 
  if anything take the car to a trusted mechanic to check it out , or give him a call and explain your experience with it .

  good luck . 
  great call man , i 'll def read your stuff .

  it 's actually spelled * trash 8 *, 
  or just the srv version, 
  we see explozion on daily commute to airport, 
  in a sense it is , unless he 's looking to mod it . 
  you can pump a lot of power out of a stock gt after a few mods . 
  but the 302 ang 500 are usually quite a bit pricier . 
  at least in my area,

  vroom vroom ** ugh displacement **, 
  i 've had weird experiences with revving , i try to rev at other stangs , but it 's tough to gauge the owner , because a lot of them do n't seem to be into stangs or cars at all . 
  just the other day i revved at a nice fifth gen vert and i just got a terrified stare from the driver . 
  i rarely see cobras in ma where i live , but every other gt gives me a rev , so i appreciate that .

  usually , it 's just a friendly gesture . 
  you know that they want to race you when they pull up next to you head to head and match your speed for a while . 
  and if you speed up they 'll pass you like it 's the fucking indinapolis speedway . 
  there are way less of these guys but sometimes you run into one . 
  the worst is when you 're not trying to race them . 
  it 's like fuck off dude i 'm just going to work,

  my ** ball sack **, 
  man , those terminators are the prime of the new edge stangs . 
  i really want one, 
  you said it . 
  people mod them to put our ridicoulous power , it 's very hard to find untouched ones, 
  there 's no way , and if there was , i still would n't help you . 
  it 's a fucking mustang of course it 's vulgar . 
  what did you expect a db9 aston martin ? 
  you 'll be good a lot of mustang guys do that, 
  dust n bones would be an awesome tune to hear with izzy, 
  that 's also my favorite track off `` incident '', 
  i though axl was the only gnr member that was allowed to play in his underwear . 
  lol you say corvettes and camaros suck and praise a brz ? 
  lol ok guy . 
  it 's just a more expensive miata , nothing more . 
  under powered but fun to drive . 
  hm , i agree about the suspension . 
  gon na need sauce about the `` professional car testers '' part, 
  it 's easy to shit on the vette and american muscle in general , but those cars withstood the test of time and i do n't think the gt86 will . 
  i had higher expectations for it .
