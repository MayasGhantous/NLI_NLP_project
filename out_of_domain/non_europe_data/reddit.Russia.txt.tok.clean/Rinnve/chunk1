first version is completely correct . 
  you should check for nil pointer only when dereferencing it . 
  unnecessary conditionals reduce readability of code . 
  taking advantage ? 
  do n't think so , at least not in case of russian girls . 
  may be there is other things in work here . 
  different ... dunno how to put it ... mindset ? 
  that can be quite appealing . 
  patriarchal house-wife that keeps hearth warm , something like that . 
  ( not to say that all russian girls are like that , but in general us/eu girls seem to be more feministic and independent . ), 
  why human body ca n't cure itself of cancer or replace damaged limb ? 
  because there are limits to adaptability and self-preservation . 
  human body is not perfect and so is human brain and human psyche . 
  as i understand it , depression ( in medical sense , not your usual angst ) is based on natural psychic mechanism related to sorrow . 
  normally you experience different emotions and ca n't experience one for too long because it 's bad for you . 
  but if you are sick with depression , your brain is stuck in one position , so to say , it 's concentrated on one emotion and descends deeper and deeper into it . 
  after some moment it can became so overwhelming that you just want it to stop ( and you do n't care if your life stops with it , and you ca n't see any other way because your brain is sick and ca n't switch to other emotion ) . 
  that 's common misunderstanding , and rather dangerous one . 
  there is depression as ( normal ) emotion , and there is sickness . 
  if someone is sick with depression , he can not cure himself . 
  it 's not unlike obesity in a sense : someone can cure himself with proper food and workouts , but someone has damaged metabolism and requires medical attention . 
  similar appearance , completely different cause . 
  it shows how well you solve certain problems compared to statistically big sample . 
  in statistics there is thing called [ normal distribution ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/normal_distribution ) . 
  basically , if your iq is 100 , you perform just like most others ** on the same problem set ** ( that 's very important !, 
  ) , if your iq is 130 then you perform better than about 98 % others ** on the same problem set ** , if your iq is 70 then you perform worse than about 98 % others ** on the same problem set ** , and so on . 
  modern iq tests are similar to each other but generally it 's incorrect to talk about iq as something objective like height or weight . 
  two different iq tests will most certainly give you different results , and that does not mean that you suddenly became smarter or dumber ; it only shows different statistical sample of those tests . 
  no , your endorphin receptors will burn out . 
  that 's basically what happens with heroin addicts : it inducts so much chemical happiness that brain just ca n't bear it . 
  sorrow and happiness are not like -1 and +1 in math , it 's more like salt and sugar : completely different things , not a linear dial from one extreme to other . 
  drjava is probably most lightweight ide that is ide and not just text editor . 
  russia is the name of the country , not the region . 
  russia is the name of the country . 
  to be completely correct , it 's the name for several different countries , historically evolved from one to another : from kievlan rus to duchy of moscow to tsardom of russia to imperial russia to russian republic , which became a part of ussr ( = soviet union ) . 
  russian part of ussr became modern russian federation , other parts became independent countries again ( although they were and are historically tied with russia in one form or another ) . 
  this is also incorrect . 
  russia was a part of soviet union . 
  some other parts of ussr were tightly tied to russian history ( like ukraine and belarus ) , some were more or less independent states with their own history and culture ( i.e. 
  as a russian myself , i could n't care less . 
  they wanted independence , they got it . 
  i 'm afraid that this idea just ca n't be adequately translated in russian . 
  the core of the joke is that if you do n't gave something , it is not there . 
  we russians just do n't say it this way . 
  ( and because of that reason those jokes are extremely funny for those of us who get it , it 's like they tickle unused part of language-brain or something like that ), 
  basically , russian imperial army crumbled down even * before * the ceasefire , just like the russian empire itself . 
  bolsheviks sure had their part in this process , but they were not the only reason ( and , i 'd say , far from most important one ) . 
  after that , bolsheviks started to build their own red army . 
  some officers were killed by deserters , many officers joined red army to be known as '' \u0432\u043e\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u044b '' later ( `` voenspetsy '' , short for `` military experts '' ) . 
  other officers formed white army ( there was no strong unity between them though ) . 
  and so , civil war ensued . 
  you must keep in mind that russian revolutions ( yes , all two of them , not one ) were quite complicated . 
  it was not like some military coup suddenly came to power . 
  those events affected and were affected by all layers of russian society , military included . 
  it is impossible to understand what happened to russian military without considering the whole picture ( and it is * big * picture ) . 
  not for witchcraft . 
  she attacked camera operator and broke his camera . 
  this `` witchcraft '' bullshit is just ntv being ntv . 
  it 's basically drunk complaining about fate and life . 
  a man was in hospital ( or even in several hospitals ) for some time , and while he was where , his girlfriend married another man and had a baby ( not from the man in story 'cause he did n't see her for a year or more ) . 
  in the end he apologizes about telling all this to a stranger . 
  you ca n't really comprehend what 's going on from this message ; i usually call it `` 1/3 drunken '' : for every spoken ( or written ) word two are unspoken . 
  so either you can into telepathy or you just sit there and smile understandingly : `` yeah , life sucks '' . 
  that 's not me you 're asking , but i can answer ( or so i think ) . 
  you do n't learn foreign language by reading some training books . 
  you learn it by using it . 
  read a lot , for starters . 
  i mean , a lot . 
  like , several hours a day . 
  that 'll give some material for your brain to work on . 
  just keep doing it and eventually you 'll notice that you do n't need dictionaries anymore . 
  same goes with speech . 
  ( that 's from my experience of learning english ... or , not learning - because it was never the goal , only the means . ), 
  it was a small part of some new year show .

  how comes then that i and my brother and most of my friends were baptized without any problems and were ( are ) as christian as it comes ? 
  197x russia was n't communist enough ? 
  religion was looked upon , that 's true , but pretty much only anti-communist propaganda/preaching would lead to serious trouble . 
  so the goverment forced churches to follow the law and punished those who did n't . 
  makes perfect sense by me . 
  also , i 'm pretty sure you are wrong about rules . 
  it actually had nothing to do with the belief system , it was all about politics and power ( mostly because in pre-ussr russia church was ** not ** separated from state ; old habits die hard and all that ) . 
  actually , it 's far from this . 
  usually . 
  but all you need is just one retarded or self-important driver with zero attention to surroundings . 
  bribing police can be actually a very bad idea . 
  especially with just a couple hundreds . 
  it 's a criminal offence , you know . 
  and with a couple hundreds it 's not only a criminal offence , it 's also an insult . 
  \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c is used to denote possession ? 
  how so ? 
  that 's just wrong . 
  \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c means ( 1 ) to eat , ( 2 ) to be , depending on context . 
  = `` i eat pancakes . '', 
  = `` i am russian . '', 
  ( very unnatural but formally correct ) . 
  \u0418\u043c\u0435\u0442\u044c means `` to have [ something ] '' or `` to own something '', 
  = `` i own an auto . '', 
  = `` i have eyes . '', 
  ( quite unnatural but formally correct . ),
