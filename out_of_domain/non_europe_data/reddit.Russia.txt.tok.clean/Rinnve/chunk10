  some isps ( not all ! ), 
  got lazy though and started to block by domain names or even ip addresses . 
   blocking sites . 
  nothing wrong with it , not all information is harmless . 
   very flawed implementation of blocking sites - blocking wrong ones ,, 
  that 's mostly isps fault . 
   confusion over processes , doing it outside the law etc. 
  clarify , please . 
   requiring all sites that have comments/interactivity to be reported to the government for monitoring, 
   overuse of extremism laws to close sites, 
   overreach of the law , e.g. 
  finding one `` extremist '' comment on a forum and seizing all of the forum 's servers, 
  source ? 
   illegal , pro-state attacks such as ddos , data breaches , spam , etc to take down/obscure sensitive sites , esp . 
  at critical times, 
  source ? 
   protecting cyber criminals . 
  source ? 
  not all information is harmless . 
  yeah , you 're right , the law itself does not enforces url block . 
  constitution does . 
   angry mobs beating and harassing gays, 
  those were in existence long before this law , therefore it can not be a consequence of this law . 
  angry mob taking protesting gay people to police instead of just beating them can be a consequence , though . 
  prosecuted how , exactly ? 
  by being put `` on a special list '' so the commission on affairs of minors can * control * what happens to her ? 
  that 's not a prosecution , more like protection . 
  well , let 's see . 
  here is a list of currently blocked sites : http://antizapret.info/, 
  starting from the top :, 
  * more neo-nazi shit, 
  * removed content with redirect to `` anonymous political forum '', 
  * info on marijuana growing, 
  * `` smoking mixes '' for `` relaxation '', 
  * `` smoking mixes '' for `` relaxation '', 
  * `` legal '' `` smoking mixes '' for `` relaxation '', 
  * and some more `` smoking mixes '' ... ( i guess i 'd skip down to more interesting stuff ), 
  * some hashish/marijuana advertises, 
  * teen porn site ( which was later * removed * from this list ), 
  * gay porn site with really young looking models, 
  * some hentai links with drawn child porn, 
  * and , dammit , * real * child porn . 
  i guess i will stop on this one , do n't want to unsee something . 
  so yeah , really poor evidence . 
  edit : typos, 
  and this law legitimizes it how , exactly ? 
  did i miss something , or they failed to mention that this '' \u041e\u043a\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0439 \u043f\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0444\u0438\u043b\u044f\u0439 '' ( occupy pedophilia ) group is illegal , and that their leader tesak is wanted criminal ? 
  oh , and those guys hunted pedophiles . 
  it just so happens that there are gay pedophiles too . 
  not to justify it , of course , but it kind of smells when reporters use videos of one illegal activity and claim that it was different illegal activity . 
  criminals how ? 
  criminals why ? 
  being gay is in now way criminal in russia , it is in the law and it was stated so by the officials . 
  school and parents afaik were informed by those vigilantes , not the police . 
  this `` special police list '' only means that the police is to watch what 's going on with her . 
  it was clearly stated that it is more for her protection , and that she can not be prosecuted . 
  oh , and this infamous law is administrative . 
  that means that the worst you can get for it is fine or detainment for several days . 
  jail is completely out of question . 
  yeah , my bad . 
  but still the focus was on pedophiles first and gays second , as goes this common misconception that mixes pedos and gays . 
  multiple real life examples of older perverts messing with young boys probably are the source . 
  nyt video authors somehow forgot to mention this . 
  what i mean is that deliberate homophobia and homophobia that stems from poor education and fear of unknown are two * completely * different things . 
  he does not . 
  why do you think so ? 
  vigilantes , yes . 
  real dicks . 
  police , im not so sure . 
  i did . 
  police can not find someone guilty , that 's what judges are for . 
  and those basically have found that there was no law violation . 
  it would n't be possible if vigilantes were ignored ( that would silently promote further harassment escalation ) . 
  dont be afraid to state your own opinion and view of the matters . 
  it is not criminal as long as gays do n't start making out in front of children . 
   out of how many ? 
  i just took the top of the list . 
  quickly skimming though it , i failed to find something different from narco/cp/nazi theme . 
  as for legal process , it is stated in the law . 
  basically , authorities warn site owner/hoster to remove illicit page , if it is not removed within 24 hours , then page goes to the list . 
  if illicit info is removed , then entry is removed from the list within 3 days . 
  if the procedures are n't followed , that would be unlawful -  take it to the court . 
  criteria for site block are quite clearly defined , * and * unblock procedure is clearly defined too . 
  i see no problem here . 
   no it is n't . 
  they are also partly to blame , but when they get an order block ip address `` x '' they do it , even if that ip address is say , all of live journal and the requesting politicians did n't understand how live journal ips work when they asked . 
  yes it is . 
  according to the law , blacklist must contain * both * domain name or specific url * and * ip address . 
  this case with live journal has nothing to do with `` black list '' law , it was local court decision that can be appealed against . 
  some isps though decided to play lazy and block ip . 
  for example , rostelekom now blocks entire dreamwidth.org , even if only one page of one blog on this site is in the list . 
  it seems that nobody cares enough to do something with it ( including me , sadly : rt fails on so many levels that it was easier just to switch to another isp ) . 
   there are some sites blocked , particularly at the regional level , at the request of an authority , even if there has been no finding that it breaks the law in a way that would get it blocked . 
  such a block would be completely unlawful . 
  it would be nice to see some examples . 
   some sites are also blocked despite being on the registry . 
  lj-rossia for example . 
  blocked , but not on the list . 
  http://www.nr2.ru/ekb/423623.html http://eais.rkn.gov.ru/, 
  lj.rossia.org is * not * blocked now , even by rostelekom .
