  several pages were on black list some time ago , not entire site . 
  rt of course blocked ip . 
     requiring all sites that have comments/interactivity to be reported to the government for monitoring, 
    source ? 
   http://lenta.ru/news/2014/01/15/duma/ http://itar-tass.com/politika/887451 http://www.newsru.com/russia/20dec2013/informlaw.html, 
  so it is not in the law yet , and any details are unknown . 
  but as i understand it main point is to force owners of forum/blog/other social sites to keep db even if they shut down the site , to prevent `` it never happened ! '', 
  situations . 
  i found no `` reporting for monitoring '' . 
   the jehovah 's witnesses are wacky , but their online posts about their beliefs are n't `` extremist '' as defined by russian law . 
  they were found extremist by a local court . 
  if somebody thinks that it was an unlawful decision , then said somebody can appeal against the court 's decision . 
  and they do it : http://www.jw-russia.org/news/news.htm ( it is about another court decision in another city ) . 
     illegal , pro-state attacks such as ddos , data breaches , spam , etc to take down/obscure sensitive sites , esp . 
  at critical times, 
    source ? 
   so many !, 
  nonono , i 'm perfectly aware about the facts . 
  but i 've yet to see some serous proof that links those to russian government . 
   despite being internationally known and wanted for thefts of hundreds of millions of dollars , the indicted russians who have n't left russia are still there and doing well . 
  so fbi ca n't arrest russian people in russia . 
  big deal . 
  that 's not `` protecting cyber criminals '' , that 's `` absence of extradition treaty between usa and russia '' . 
  it seems to me that this case is more about ingushetia than * russian * government , and the site was only a relatively small part of it . 
  it was chosen as the test ? 
  what ? 
  she was n't . 
  being registered by the commission on affairs of minors is hardly a prosecution . 
  this is good news though , it means that she did * nothing * wrong and that it is kind of official that this law can not be applied to minors . 
  the title is * wrong * . 
  registering by the commission on affairs of minors ( that 's what happened ) is not a prosecution in any sense . 
  it 's just police saying `` we 're watching you now , behave yourself '' . 
  observation bias . 
  there will be fuckups in any major undertaking , it is inevitable . 
  if somebody shows you 1 % that was fucked up and do n't shows other 99 % that was good , what would be your opinion on what you saw ? 
  oh , and this bullshit about cellphone hacking is just that : bullshit . 
  brand new samsung phone running android with default security setting that downloads and installs software all by itself ? 
  really ? 
   anyone know how they 're doing it ? 
  they are not doing it . 
  `` hacks '' in this video are fake . 
  they are pretty expensive for locals . 
  not so much for you wealthy muricans  one room apt in my city costs about 50 $ a day ( + - 20 $ , i dont exactly follow theirs price ), 
  it is a common misconception that flushing toilet paper along with ... ah ... other shit can cause serious troubles with plumbing . 
  it was true long ago , but old habits die hard . 
  ( it is true though if plumbing is something 50 years old . ), 
  michurinsk . 
  there is no such thing as `` russian juvenile court '' . 
  it is `` commission on affairs of minors '' . 
  it ca n't find guilty or prosecute anybody , it 's main function is preventing minors from doing actual crime . 
  the verdict in your link translates as :, 
  warn minor [ jane doe ] . 
  put said minor on the list for further control . 
  oh , and somehow you forgot to mention that said commission later decided that even warning and control are not necessary and that minors can not be prosecuted at all under the law in question because it is meant for their protection . 
  and this is related because ? . . 
   but i 'm still outraged , mostly because this ( and other ) recent laws are showing the direction in which russia is going . 
  watch the video again , this time more carefully . 
  there were anti-propaganda laws in several regions , and this federal law is actually an * improvement * over them . 
  people in russia are generally still quite conservative , i would n't expect progressive laws coming from regions . 
  this video is less about the law itself and more about western media ~ ~ shitstorm ~ ~ reaction . 
  check your facts , please . 
  there is a plenty of life outside mkad . 
  corruption issues are quite exaggerated ( especially outside mkad , hehe ) . 
  people in regions may have lesser salaries than in moscow , but the expenses are far lower too . 
  it is not all roses of course , but it is vary far from your apocalyptic description . 
  oh , and internet here is fast and cheap . 
  i pay $ 15 monthly for 30mbit/s fiber , beat that , 
  i 'm saying that you should not expect progressive laws from regions where many people are still conservative . 
  i did not said anything about attacks on russia . 
  ( although i do n't think that those are good thing for one obvious reason : attacks do n't change people , only make them angry . 
  it is stupid tactic if the change is what you want . 
  nice move for massive media distraction , though . ), 
  the art of reading goes further than just combining letters in words . 
  tambov region . 
  one of poorer regions compared to neighbors , actually . 
  things change quite fast today , your description would be quite accurate only ten or so years ago , and in nineties it was even worse . 
  being conservative and being bad are two completely different things . 
  on the accusation that broad , russian people are no worse than any other in the world . 
  but to return on the topic , discriminating gays by not allowing pro-gay propaganda ( whatever it means ) is quite different from discriminating them by beheading . 
  and somehow it happens that good usa people commit hate crimes against gays quite more often than those oh so bad russian bigots . 
  there is nothing wrong with * criticising * goverment or even people . 
  there are tons of wrong with western media starting this antirussian shitstorm . 
  do you need a thorough explanation of why it is wrong , or may be you will try and think with your own brain for a change ? 
   we were talking about the law and the bigotry behind it, 
  what ? 
  you did n't even cared to actually * watch * the video we discuss here ? 
  big surprise , the video is less about the law itself and more about western media reaction . 
  i already told you so . 
  wow , that 's niiiice speed . 
  a bit of overkill may be , but still . 
  what isp is it ? 
  that 's wrong . 
  vkontakte ( russian facebook ) is full with jokes on it , other social networks are too . 
  my point is that, 
  a ) media attack russia for supposedly anti-gay law ( `` all gays in russia go to jail '' ) , and, 
  b ) at the same time media are oblivious to gay problems in other countries including their own ,, 
  c ) therefore , they do n't really care about gay problems and are doing it for some other reason ;, 
  d ) and last but not least , media are completely missing that this `` anti-gay law '' is not crackdown on gays really , it is crackdown on the free speech . 
  gays are not target , free speech is . 
  simple , is n't it ?
