  as for argumentum ad hominem , it will not be answered . 
  no , because when discussion is degrading to argumentum ad hominem , taking words out of context and direct insults it 's not discussion anymore , and i 'm not going to come down to your level . 
  more petty insults , just as expected . 
  grow up , man . 
  here are two different translations . 
  bear in mind that english lyrics ca n't be translated word-to-word to russian and remain , well , lyrics , so it is more like written anew in the spirit of the original . 
  big surprise : there are radicals in russia , and some of them are neo-nazis !, 
  it is sad though that the article failed to follow the title after the awful word . 
  how is xenophobia uniting russians ? 
  why it is only force doing it , and is it ? 
  one can only wonder . 
  continuation of the story : http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/2014/02/07/lgbt-aktivisty-otpushcheny-iz-ovd-kitay-gorod, 
  tl ; dr : they were all released . 
  very embarrassing , but expected . 
  one ca n't force their world view , however righteous it is , down onto others and expect gratitude . 
   i personally do n't see how this could be worth 51bn . 
  well , i do . 
  they build anew entire freaking city !, 
  it could be worth well over 51bn . 
  and yes , there are always better ways to spent money . 
  starting from taking those 51bn and spreading them evenly among all russians , making all millionaires . 
  ( yeah , i 've heard this several times already , and not as a joke . 
  some people just ca n't into economics . ), 
  damn , that 's sad . 
  vpn is the only choice then . 
  no , in sochi and around it . 
  or are you suggesting that all of these marvels are , i dunno , holographic stunts or something ? 
  batmom, 
   no one seems to leave our secret services and blab about it, 
  and this is not scary because ... ? 
   mr. bean , james bond and her majesty jumping out of a helicopter . 
  yeah . 
  much fun . 
  very entertainment . 
  * facepalm *, 
  u mad ? 
   the costs have already been analysed by many others . 
  could you please provide a link to accounting data so i can humbly analyse it itself ? 
   we are aware, 
  and could you please specify who would be ` we ' here ? 
  it is not related to russia ... or is it ? 
  navalny and his friends published exactly * fuck * . 
  dont get me wrong , im not pro putin in any way , but this opposition `` analysis '' is laughable . 
  sochi is an unique undertaking , and it is impossible to judge it without * fucking detailed * economical data . 
  why oh why wouldnt they stop al-fucking-ready ? 
  it is sickening . 
  part lies , part sheer incompetecy of reporters who are too lasy to look up freaking facts . 
  elon musk is right , its damn time to move on to mars . 
  oh damn im goin to suffer for it, 
  whole damn half of the europe contains vodka . 
  i did . 
  it misses the point , or , more specifically , fails to define it . 
  xenophobia is in here , but one must be at least specific about it . 
  i am sorry . 
  do n't bullshit about sochi olympics being more expensive than all the other winter olympics ever combined . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  i do n't think it 's possible to be significantly more venomous than * that * . 
   russia today under career president vladimir putin is an example to us of how the end product of communism can look -- a dysfunctional society struggling to find its economic footing , politically strangled by its megalomaniac leader and his gangster regime and threatened by extremists in its midst . 
   no other country in recent memory has produced such tragicomedy for international media consumption as russia 's succession of poisonings , assassinations , homophobia and narcissistic , self-styled pinup hunk for a president . 
  well , may be it 's just me . 
  may be it 's enough internet for today , i 'm starting to see anti-russian propaganda everywhere . 
  quick google for '' \u043e\u043a\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0439 \u043f\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0444\u0438\u043b\u044f\u0439 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 '' reveals that not only russian media does not ignores this group ( yeah , it 's singular ) , but that russian police does not ignores it too : http://www.ura.ru/content/svrd/25-12-2013/news/1052171915.html, 
  it is indeed censored , but it is not . 
  domain name `` justinkripps.ca '' is not on the black list , but ip address is on it . 
  ip address is shared with http://bitnest.ca/rhodium/chemistry/catsynth.notes.html , which was added to the black list on 10.12.2013 according to [ this ] ( http://antizapret.info/site.php?id=1745 ) . 
  some russian isps chose to play lazy and block ip addresses , not domain names . 
  that 's exactly what [ happened ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1xcqn6/censored_russia_blocks_website_of_olympic/cfau36f ) . 
  it 's not roskomnadszor 's fault , though . 
  it 's rostelekom . 
  transtelekom and other isps somehow manage to ban urls and domain names , but no , it 's too hard for rostelekom . 
   in russia if you go entrap a gay person and beat them up in a gang you wo n't even get arrested !, 
  [ wrong . 
  ] ( http://www.ura.ru/content/svrd/25-12-2013/news/1052171915.html ), 
  tl ; dr : the group impacted most if found to be in violation of the law : multinational corporations . 
  media shitstorm ensues . 
   roads cost average about $ 2m/km of paved highway in the eu . 
  ctrl-f rail : found 0, 
   and nemtsov ? 
  navalny actually tried to do some calculations . 
  nemtsov 's work is just sensationalist bullshit . 
  `` oh , you can build quality road for tenth of this sum !, 
  oh , mars rover was 1/3 of this sum !, 
  winter olympics in subtropics !, 
  sochi is a ghost town !, 
  chaos is imminent !, 
   so the facts on the ground are as i describe , and the laws/regulations are not being followed to the letter . 
  well , go sue rostelekom . 
  i do n't care enough to do it . 
  do you ? 
   e.g on sept 27 it was announced that beeline would block access to sites that posted the innocence of muslims video in chechnya , dagestan , karabino-balkaria , ingushetia , karachai-cherkessia , norther oessetia and stavropol . 
  yeah , i remember this one . 
  prosecutors * recommended * to block this video , isp did it without objections . 
  no one of their customers cared enough to do something about it . 
   go to uinc.ru and search the archives for more . 
  i do n't trust site that reposts sensationalist news without any sanity checks ( i 'm talking about [ this one ] ( http://uinc.ru/news/sn21294.html ) . ), 
   as for the `` report '' question , the law says that `` website `` organizers '' must also `` notify '' ( \u0443\u0432\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u044c ) russian security services when users first begin using their sites , and whenever users `` exchange information . '', 
  no it does not . 
  website owner must notify roscomnadzor ( not security services ) when said website starts providing communication services . 
  pretty reasonable idea . 
   well there is the data breach that i mentioned above that found a budget line item for `` hacker '' in federal youth agency documents .
