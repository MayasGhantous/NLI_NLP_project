  there is also the question of who else would have launched them ? 
  main questions is did novaya gazeta ( or other sites allegedly suffered ddos ) taken any legal moves ? 
  ddos is kind of illegal in russia , you know . 
   they sat in russia and stole from russian victims and hundreds of thousands of people worldwide . 
  they did this in russia , in violation of russian law . 
  source ? 
  hola extension for google chrome seems to work ( it 's basically user-friendly vpn with exit points all around the world ) . 
  why not 40 % ? 
  why not 150 % ? 
  those `` estimates '' have no sense whatsoever . 
  in one of ted talks there was an interesting idea : they used voice recognition to improve pronunciation . 
  google voice recognition technology works quite good for russian language , so you can just take some text , read it to android smartphone or computer with chrome and see what comes out of it . 
  ( i did not tried myself chrome voice recognition though , but i doubt that it would be different from android . ), 
  haters gon na hate . 
   putin however is . 
  it 's his responsibillity to make sure that gays in russia are n't treated like second class citizens . 
  i 'd say it more like police responsibility . 
  and of course they do not ignore such criminal actions . 
  for some reason though news about ` good ' russian police actions do n't get translated . 
  there was ( probably still is ) a myth that seatbelts do more harm than good , something like breaking your neck instead of stopping you from hitting windshield . 
  oh , and a half-assed macho move too ( not macho enough to drive without a seatbelt near police cams ) . 
   uinc.ru is a perfectly respectable news aggregator and a great source of events . 
  news ? 
  how come that lame antirussian propaganda obvious for everyone with a hint of a tech background is news ? 
  how many other similar `` news '' are there ? 
   see two comments above . 
  i included links to descriptions of their crimes . 
  they committed their crimes while in russia . 
  russia has jurisdiction . 
  have you even read the article you 've linked ? 
  it only states a citizenship of those criminals . 
   it 's not lame antirussian propaganda . 
  i 'm talking about particular ` news ' item that this aggregator reposted without any checks . 
  that says about aggregator 's quality . 
   no one disputes that the identified russian citizens who have russian names and live in russia are russian . 
  but you state not only this but also that they committed their crime while being in russia and against other russians . 
   soviet union was waaaaay more progressive regarding women 's rights , gays, 
  except being gay was criminal offence back then . 
   in russia , this type of behavior is promoted and sanctioned by the state . 
  yeah , promoted and sanctioned by arresting those thugs and putting them into jail ? 
  check your facts before jumping the bandwagon of antirussian media shitstorm . 
  it would be nice to see only one project of similar scale that was not significantly affected by corruption . 
  for starters , those ` complaints ' do n't look very legit . 
  check your facts next time before posting bullshit . 
  from my experience ( cs teacher in middle and high school ) python is a very good choice . 
  it is basically executable pseudocode , very clean language and easy to grasp . 
  prog language is secondary though . 
  main thing is to teach them to stop and think , to do n't rush , to step away from computer and write down ideas with pen and paper . 
  i 've learned it from ... ` thinking forth ' , i believe : that you should only code when the solution is crystal clear in your head . 
  great book , by the way . 
  learn python the hard way by zed shaw is extremely good , and it 's not really about python , more like about programming in general . 
  afrer that , i 'd do sicp for blowing your mind completely and rearranging it in a new way . 
  both a correct , but by using plural you are giving trees too much credit of independent action . 
   who are you to say that homosexuality is n't normal or a model ? 
  who are you to say that it is on both accounts ? 
  gay couples ca n't have children naturally . 
  is there a scientific proof that there is no difference between raising adopted children by hetero couples and gay ones ? 
  is there a scientific proof that it will cause no harm to children * and * to society ? 
  this is called avoiding the question . 
   you could actually bother using your own initiative to learn something about this particular topic for once, 
  thing is , i did . 
  [ just published in the journal social science research , [ 1 ] the most careful , rigorous , and methodologically sound study ever conducted on this issue found numerous and significant differences between these groups -- with the outcomes for children of homosexuals rated `` suboptimal '' ( regnerus ' word ) in almost every category . 
  ] ( http://www.frc.org/issuebrief/new-study-on-homosexual-parents-tops-all-previous-research ), 
  [ children living with gay and lesbian families in 2006 were about 65 % as likely to graduate compared to children living in opposite sex marriage families . 
  daughters of same-sex parents do considerably worse than sons . 
  ] ( http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-013-9220-y ), 
  [ `` what the social science makes clear , and it has for several decades , is that children tend to do best when they 're raised by their married biological parents , '' said jennifer marshall , director of domestic policy studies for the conservative heritage foundation . 
  `` in the case of same-sex households , there is not yet evidence that [ children ] are going to be the same . 
  there 's every reason to believe that different family structures will have different outcomes . '' ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/social-science-struggles-with-the-effects-of-same-sex-parenting-on-children/2013/03/26/a6fa50ca-9655-11e2-8b4e-0b56f26f28de_story.html ), 
   burden of proof is on you the asker, 
  burden of proof is on the ones who propose changes to society . 
  as i 've shown [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1xtlea/russia_expands_adoption_ban_russia_is_now/cff1gzl ) , it is not as simple as it looks . 
  do n't pretend that you did not understood the message . 
   1st link is to `` family research council '', 
  this research was published in social science research journal by elsevier inc. . as far as i know , elsevier is not a platform for parasciece freaks . 
   3rd is one quote ( an `` opposing view '' ) from a right wing activist, 
  so it is automatically wrong , because only left is right , yes ? 
   please try again , with an pro-gay mind this time . 
  fixed it for you . 
  the thing is , all this gay stuff is kind of new even for western culture . 
  it is totally possible that * in ideal world * gay couples are just as good at raising children . 
  but now it still is a kind of a freak circus . 
  even if there are no other factors at play , this one is enough . 
  vdv ( paratrooper ) day is professional holiday for ( former ) paratroopers , well known for short temper , at least on that particular day : it is * their * day . 
  battle glory , remembering the fallen and all that . 
  `` pro-lgbt activist '' provoked them , reporters reported , police contained the situation . 
  seems planned from start to finish , if you ask me . 
  first , many of those crimes were committed in ukraine , moldova , belarus and kazakhstan . 
  second , why do you think that russian police is doing nothing ? 
  it is not so : http://www.1sn.ru/83373.html, 
   rus ' does not mean russian, 
  rus ' means russia . 
  literally . 
  kiev was part of russia from the start . 
  historical ties here are millennium old . 
  seriously , learn history before discussing it . 
   and what happens to russian journalists who ` misrepresent putin ' ? 
  they die . 
  care to provide some examples ? 
  pussy riot and greenpeace are political prisoners now ?
