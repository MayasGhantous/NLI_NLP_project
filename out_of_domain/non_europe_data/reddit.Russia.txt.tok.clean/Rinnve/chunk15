  you are putting in one pot completely different things . 
  protectionist economic strategy has nothing to do with `` demonizing '' anybody , it is strictly about economics . 
  war in chechnya has nothing to do with foreigners , this is our land ; there were abuses and slaughter from both sides , but they were in no way a state policy , it 's a reaction to chechen wild brutality . 
  in fact , abuses were ( mostly ) prosecuted ( look up budanov 's case , for example ) . 
   there is frequently arbitrary and illegal detention and expulsion of ethnic georgians, 
  arbitrary and illegal ? 
  hardly . 
  the thing is that georgians and other southern people tend to form closely knit communities ( that would be ok ) that mostly ignore any laws except for their own ( and that is totally * not * ok ) . 
  not all of them behave like that , but a very significant part do . 
   hundreds of innocent people from the street were arbitrary arrested , beaten , tortured , and raped by special police forces . 
  what ? 
  source , please . 
   this law has since been used to justify the entrapment , detention , and torture of innocent young men . 
  it was * not * . 
  not on one single account . 
  said criminal activity has indeed happened , though , and not only in russia : occupy pedophilia vigilantes have branches in ukraine , belarus , moldova and kazakhstan . 
  do n't know about other countries , but in russia there is ongoing investigation , and as far as i can tell , most of those vigilantes are arrested . 
  so much for government endorsement . 
  as for reasons for intolerance , gypsies in russia are deeply involved in illegal drug markets ( heroin mostly ) . 
  more than 60 % of all crimes in moscow alone are committed by illegal central asia immigrants . 
  ... and did not cared enough to abide the law . 
   in truth , however , only one of the persons involved in the occupy pedophaelia gang has been arrested, 
  [ occupy pedophilia activists arrested in nizhny novgorod ] ( http://www.pro-goroda.ru/sobytiya/aktivisty-okkupay-pedofilyay-zaderzhany-za-grabezhfoto-video-22435 ), 
   but not by russian authorities, 
  [ moscow court issues arrest order for tesak ] ( http://lifenews.ru/news/124003 ), 
   was arrested for demonstrating `` skinhead ideology '' and not his well-known and video-taped homophobic torture of men as young as 15, 
  so court decided to pursue what is unambiguously identifies as crime . 
  because , you know , some of those oh-so-tortured-gays where later [ arrested for pedophilia ] ( http://www.gazeta.ru/social/news/2013/09/03/n_3156701.shtml ) . 
   in truth his lawyer says he will be seeking asylum in cuba to avoid russian authorities !, 
  [ tesak arrested and moved to moscow . 
  ] ( http://www.newsru.com/russia/27jan2014/tesak.html ), 
   this is racist bullshit . 
  so statistics are only true when they are fitting in your ideology ? 
  how convenient . 
  and no , those statistics are not affected by ` xenophobic policy ' . 
  the crimes in question are good old theft , robbery , rape and murder . 
   it is all too easy to defend intolerant policies ... as long as they do not affect you directly . 
  same for tolerant policies . 
   and take some comfort from the fact that resources , like / reddit , would not be tolerated in russia . 
  you know what is not tolerated in russia , according to official black list ? 
  illegal drug marketing , nazism and racism , child pornography . 
  reddit is perfectly tolerated . 
  russia is big . 
  i mean , really big . 
  it 's like asking `` how life in europe is '' or `` how life in america is '' . 
  prince ivan iii introduced renaissance architecture to russia by inviting a number of architects from italy , who brought new construction techniques and some renaissance style elements with them , while in general following the traditional designs of the russian architecture . 
  ** in 1475 ** the bolognese architect aristotele fioravanti came to rebuild the cathedral of the dormition in the moscow kremlin , damaged in an earthquake . 
  fioravanti was given the 12th-century vladimir cathedral as a model , and ** produced a design combining traditional russian style with a renaissance sense of spaciousness , proportion and symmetry . 
  ** in 1495 the italian renaissance arrived in france , ** imported by king charles viii after his invasion of italy . 
  from the same article . 
   not a single one was in english, 
  google translate is your friend . 
   i took a look at pravda.ru ( pro-government news site . ), 
  so english.pravda.ru is conservative ( and yellowish if you ask me ) news site that fancies sensationalist titles . 
  big deal . 
  the question is , why cite pravda.ru and not ria novosti , * the * russian news agency ? 
  not so convenient ? 
  the part you 've cited is wrong on two accounts , not one . 
  putin is not a dictator . 
  far from it . 
  not total , but yeah , kind of shitty . 
   '' \u0421\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0439 '' is a slang term for `` highly drunk '' . 
  bull . 
  i mean , it is , but it 's highly context dependent . 
  some russians are rapists and murderers . 
  let 's label entire nation after them , what do you think about it ? 
  there are issues , nobody is arguing with it . 
  but it is very wrong to label all russians as lgbt-hating bigots . 
  how so ? 
  pronunciation differs slightly , there can be some local words that are not used elsewhere , but nothing major . 
  english differ much more . 
  two men or women kissing can be just a little bit over top for average russian , but the worst you can expect is a $ 100 fine if children see you ( and i dont think that police would bother themselves with such petty misdemenea ... not exactly crime ) . 
  anti gay laws do not exist in russia . 
   however , to have a law mandating it is reprehensible . 
  it 's probably good then that russia does not have such a law . 
  russia does not exactly have a sane and healthy society , that you 've got right . 
  it ca n't be , considering all that was going on in last thirty years . 
  it is healing now , though , slowly but steady . 
  but the thing is , you ca n't heal anything by poking at sore spots . 
  wounds are not healed by salting them . 
   art and social progress . 
  i do not want to live in a world where this is `` art and social progress '' . 
  just sayin ', 
  this , thousand times this . 
  and i 'm an atheist . 
  barely . 
  they are extremely proud of themselves , though , and therefore are extremely intolerant to everything that does not fit in their mindset . 
  think `` keepers of old sacred traditions and knowledge '' . 
  a curiosity , mostly , but i 'd strongly recommend against crossing paths with them . 
  the same nyt that lied about russian `` anti-gay law '' for `` putting gays in jail '' ? 
  it figures . 
   they knew this was going to happen , and still they went ahead and did it anyway . 
  are you admiring breivik as well ? 
  he surely knew what is going to happen , he went ahead and did it . 
  in your dreams , darling , in your dreams . 
  well , compared to chechens with their thousand-old tribal laws and this pretty grim blood feud thing , cossacks are actually rather tame fossils . 
  honestly , you do not know what really is violent repression of free speech . 
   skinhead groups take it upon themselves to lure gay men and beat and humiliate them on camera, 
  if you 're talking about occupy pedophilia , they work by luring gays with * underage * boy , if i 'm not mistaken . 
   these same people find and rape lesbians in order to `` cure '' them .
