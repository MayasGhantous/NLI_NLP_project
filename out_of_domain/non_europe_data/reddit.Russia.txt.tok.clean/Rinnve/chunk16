  what ? 
   even today , many ( not all ) russians regard ukrainians about the same as the whites in the usa regarded blacks in the mid to late 1800 's . 
  what ? 
  where the hell did you get this ? 
   ukraine is russia 's bitch , russia 's nig * er . 
  that 's the way russia has always looked at them , and they probably always will . 
  they think of ukrainians as second-class citizens , and they always will . 
  this is blatant lie . 
  as a state , russia can sometimes consider ukraine like a smaller relative ( may be because it is smaller relative ) . 
  but second-class citizens ? 
  what the actual hell ?

  * edit : links . 
   i do n't like it , but i see it everywhere i go . 
  well , i live in russia , know several families with ukrainian relatives and several ukrainians who moved here . 
  russians do not , i repeat it , do not consider ukrainians as second-class citizens or something like that . 
  it is simply unthinkable . 
   russia has cut off the gas pipeline and threatened to cut it off several times . 
  well , what do you do when customer does not pays for your product ? 
  also i do n't really know why you mentioned holodomor . 
   i mentioned holodomor because it happened . 
  why not mention other famines then ? 
  there were plenty . 
   i have met far too many russians who talk down to ukrainians . 
  and i did n't . 
   the gas pipeline ploy is not simply about not paying . 
  first and foremost it is about not paying . 
  all the politics stem from that simple fact . 
  if the ukrainian state was able to pay gas debts , there would be no politics at all . 
   i would think the riots that are happening right now would be proof enough of that . 
  or maybe it is a proof that ukraine is inherently split in two , eastern being historically a part of orthodox russia ( hell , until recently ukrainians where considered as russian sub-ethnicy and ukraininan language as a russian dialect ) , western historically leaning to ( and historically being a part of ) catholic poland . 
  are there any proofs to that , or it 's simply , you know , because russia ? 
  wtf did i read right now and how can i un-read it ? 
  i see no need for sarcasm . 
  yes , there is income inequality in russia to some extent . 
  yes , there is corruption . 
  there are issues in eu countries as well . 
  what i 'm asking is this : do you have any data on comparing said economical issues in eu countries and russia , or eu is in better situation just because it is always better than russia ? 
   let 's start with gdp per capita at purchasing power parity , which is around $ 31,000 for eu while $ 17,000 for russia . 
  russians have a saying : `` average temperature in the hospital '' , meaning that when you are over-averaging , results mean nothing . 
  eu is not all france and germany . 
  it is also bulgaria and romania . 
  it is also greece . 
   actual corruption is hard to measure since , it does n't really go punished,

   russian news currently are primarily showing riot police getting hurt , not the protesters, 
  wrong . 
  russian news do n't show violent radicals as `` peaceful protesters '' , though . 
   and the 110 billionaires in russia vs 58 in germany do n't lead to over averaging ? 
  you are missing the point . 
  there is no united economy in eu . 
  economy in germany can be pretty stable and well . 
  economy in greece , on the other hand ... 
  so , * average * eu gpd shows exactly nothing . 
  gpd by country shows that there are wealthy countries and then there are poor ones that probably contribute cheap labor force . 
  gini coefficients by themselves also mean little . 
  equality or inequality by itself is not good or bad ; people can be equally poor , or there may be a majority doing ok with insanely wealthy minority ( usa case ) . 
  for example , take romania that joined eu quite recently . 
  according to [ index mundi ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/factbook/compare/romania.russia/economy ) , it has 22 % of population below poverty line ( vs 12 % in russia ) while having gini coefficient significantly lower . 
  same for greece , bulgaria , even portugal and spain . 
  did life improve after ~ 1917 ? 
  people never learn . 
  my personal favorite . 
  there were two revolutions in russia in 1917 and 6 years of civil war after that . 
  so yeah , when revolution goes wrong , it totally does not proves that revolutions can go wrong . 
  i like it !, 
  revolution is always violence , that 's bad enough . 
  what 's worse , it is often extreme and uncontrollable violence that can go in completely unpredictable way . 
  and by the way : communist state in ussr dissolved more than twenty years ago . 
  / r/conspiracy / much ? 
  rt * is * a mass media organization . 
  yeah , russian government-controlled , western-targeted , but it would be wrong to consider it as a pure propaganda machine . 
  there is not such thing . 
  but rest assured that comment sections of russian-speaking media are even worse . 
  sometimes i even think that mandatory internet unanonymisation can be a good thing . 
  yeah , it 's that bad . 
  yeah . 
  that 's when it gets scary . 
  on that you are right . 
  they do show though police guys being put on fire , and they report death threats not only to berkut guys , but to their families and relatives . 
  they also report suspicious bullet wounds on killed rioters , as if somebody shot them from the back to add some martyrs to the case . 
  i honestly do not know who to believe . 
  both sides are lying to some extent or at least twist the truth , that 's for sure . 
  i 'm not implying that revolutions are always wrong , only that they can go wrong way too easily . 
  and honestly , if you dont care about stuff , you shouldnt discuss it . 
  they do show dead protesters . 
  at least 1st channel in russia does , dont know about whatever your mom is watching . 
  may be not ? 
  may be fucking not ? 
  are you weak in the head or something ? 
  because most of those ` sochi ' photos are year old or more , and if you 're implying that russians have a time machine ... well ... 
  so yeah , spreading the truth that somehow cleans russia is certainly a work of putin agents and not just somebody who noticed lies and wants to warn people about it . 
   because the discussion at hand is pertinent to ukraine, 
  because focusing on holodomor and not mentioning other famines of the time creates an impression that holodomor was something unique . 
  it was not . 
   the ukrainian ssr that was targeted by the russian-led government of the soviet union . 
  yeah , that 's precisely what i mean .
