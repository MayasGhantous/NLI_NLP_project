  probably the confusion stems from using \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c as a form of \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0442\u044c . 
  latter is much more natural in contemporal russian , but former is still correct ( bar connotations conserning \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0442\u044c as ` polite ' `` to f-k '' ; '' \u044f \u0438\u043c\u0435\u044e \u0434\u0435\u0432\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0443 '' - `` i 'm f-king a girl '' ; so if you say '' \u044f \u0438\u043c\u0435\u044e \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0437\u0430 '' to your average russian , hilarity can and will ensue . 
  but you can '' \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0442\u044c \u043c\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 '' - `` to have an opinion '' , that 's perfectly correct . 
  and you can say '' \u0423 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0434\u0435\u0432\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430 '' = `` i have a girlfriend '' . ), 
  hope that helps . 
  it 's not , if you 're meaning these scary dashcams videos on youtube . 
  i 'm yet to see something at least close to major crush in real life , and i 'm 30 + and have seen my share of shit . 
  but . 
  there two things . 
  first , the road rule : three `` d '' or '' \u0414\u0430\u0439 \u0414\u0443\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0443 \u0414\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0443 '' ( `` give the road to retard . '' ), 
  i do n't know about western drivers , but among our fellow russian people population of retards with cars is quite big . 
  worst thing is that completely sane citizen can suffer major retardation when driving ; i dunno what causes it but it is as it is . 
  second thing is drivers from big cities like moscow or stpt ( mostly moscow ) . 
  it 's just that annoying self-important attidude that can lead to serious harm , like `` why those peasants wo n't free road for me ... let 's drive even faster then thoh shi ... '', 
  ( i 'm not saying that all moscow/stpt drivers are assholes , but percentage is certainly bigger than in other cities . ), 
  that 's my error , i sometimes forget that ` russian ' and ` russian ' are different things ( as are ` english ' and ` english ' , for example ) . 
  ofc it must be `` i am russian . '', 
  why the hell do you learn russian cursive ? 
  complete waste of time imho unless you 're planning to relocate to russia ( and even then it 's not amongst most required skills ) . 
  if you 're unsure about your vocabulary/grammar/whatever , start with books and internet pages . 
  they do n't get bored and can get you quite far . 
  most do n't print ? 
  wherever you 're taking your info on russia , it 's wrong . 
  printing to writing is about 50/50 now , and that 's rapidly changing . 
  about reinforcing vocabulary , nothing is better than a good book ( non-simplified one , of course ) . 
  do n't take me wrong , perfecting your cursive is a good hobby , but there are far more efficient ways to learn a language . 
  this article is so full of bullshit that i do n't even know were to start . 
  it 's just plain wrong . 
  every single word of it . 
  it is very uncommon where i live . 
  it can be common though in this particular cafe . 
  some places tend to attract specific kind of people ... 
  why the hell did i followed that link . 
  main reasons are dissolution of ussr in 1991 and events that followed . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_russia_ ( 1992 % e2 % 80 % 93present ) # .22 shock_therapy .22, 
  this is no theory , this is a hypothesis , and it 's wrong . 
  literature and history were pretty big in ussr , if biased . 
  ( although that bias did n't help it in a long run . ), 
  also , chinese students are so able for completely different reason : much more harsh upraising . 
  ( harsh in a good sence ... kind of . 
  google for `` tiger mother '' if interested . ), 
  that 's not a tank , that 's an apc if i 'm not mistaken . 
  and yes , you can buy one ( demilitarized of course ) : http://atvbtr.ru/, 
  it 's `` no exit '' that was put on the image of ded moroz ( = russian santa ) . 
  santa smiles to you and then says it . 
  some of these `` photos '' are actually snapshots from soviet movies . 
  edit, 
  source ( with comments about each picture ) : http://visualhistory.livejournal.com/401253.html, 
  most negative opinion of usa i 've ever heard is about it delivering `` democracy '' around the world , and that on some strange coincidence it is delivered to petroleum-rich places . 
  that of course is mostly about usa government , not usa people . 
  that 's because you are watching depressing photos , underexposed and shot in bad weather conditions . 
  here are some not so depressing photos :, 
  it turns out that swiss alps can be pretty russian . 
  a scanner darkly is very good . 
  heavy like hell and quite disturbing , but good . 
  movie is just as good , it 's a very accurate adaptation and wonderfully complements the book . 
  that 's closing song from famous late soviet movie : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guest_from_the_future, 
  very , very nostalgic for some . 
  some stresses and some syllables are slightly off ( e.g. 
  although , besides those very minor mistakes , prononciation is almost perfect , so it does n't really matters . 
   they can be any movie dubbed over with russian, 
  do n't do this unless you are absolutely sure that translation is good . 
  because it often is not . 
   it says that instead of having your voice rise at the end of a sentence , it rises at certain parts . 
  well , it says wrong . 
  it can rise at certain parts if these parts are of main importance , it can rise at the end if there are no distinct important part . 
  rising at '' \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c '' and lowering after it . 
  this way you ask someone `` are you busy today ? '' . 
  rising at the end , this way you express not a general question , but surprise ( `` i am surprised that you are busy today . '' ), 
  pay more attention to words . 
  right words and right word order can at least partly compensate for misused intonation . 
  taking the example above , if you say '' \u0415\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043b\u0438 \u0443 \u0442\u0435\u0431\u044f \u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044f \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430 '' , you can use no intonation at all and it 'll still be perfectly clear that it 's a question . 
  yep , it 's real . 
  without weapons and fancy military equipment it 's just a car . 
  pretty big , armored , very expensive on gas . 
  sturdy , too , or so they say . 
  dedicated ( and wealthy ) hunters do like those , i 've heard . 
  you 're getting it right , it 's exactly like that . 
  look up interrogative particles : http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/category:russian_interrogative_particles, 
  ( and particle words in general ) . 
  they are specifically meant to reduce ambiguity . 
  '' \u0412\u044b \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0435 '' without any additional info ( punctuation/intonation ) is ambiguous , just like in your example . 
  '' \u0417\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u043b\u0438 \u0432\u044b '' is always a question , even without question mark or proper intonation . 
  wtf is this shit, 
  done for teh lulz , obviously . 
   guess what happens after this ? 
  all media outlets raise hell about gay rights and no one hears about the rest of the stuff . 
  except that did n't happen . 
  russian media and russian people in general just do n't really care about it . 
  both , definitely . 
  programming is a practical skill , you do n't learn it just by reading a book . 
  do n't get me wrong , books help a lot , you 'll need them , but you 're getting nowhere without doing things on your own . 
  they do n't . 
  at least not en masse . 
  it 's just easier for bilingual russians to use english words instead of searching for a precise enough russian equivalent . 
  it ** is ** spring on photo . 
  \u041c\u043e\u0434\u0430 is acceptable , \u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430 is too ( \u043f\u0430\u0442\u0438 is a bit shorter though ) . 
  i ca n't find words for \u043f\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043f or \u0444\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0437\u043e\u043d\u0430 ( it * can * be said in pure russian , but it would be longer ) . 
  i 'm not sure ) . 
   these words are being used to show off one 's education/coolness/hipness,
