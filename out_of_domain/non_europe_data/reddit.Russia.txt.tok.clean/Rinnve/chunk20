  and his vision is to confront what he sees as an assault on the privacy of americans . '', 
  now wheeler has her answer -- that , yes , the revolutionary groups were part-funded by uncle sam , but also by her boss -- one assumes awkward follow up questions will be asked on that first look internal messaging system . 
  whether wheeler , scahill and their colleagues go on to share their concerns publicly will speak volumes about first look 's much-trumpeted independence , both from omidyar 's other business interests and from omidyar 's co-investors in ukraine : the us government . 
  editor 's note : pando contacted omidyar networks for comment prior to publication but had not received a response by press time . 
  we will update this post if they do respond . 
  update : first look staffer , glenn greenwald , has responded to pando 's report here . 
  paul carr , the editor of the above report , has written a follow-up here .

  i think that it would be just enough not to support parties that , you know , wander around shouting `` knife all russians '' . 
   how about actually putting it up to a referendum . 
  it 's on the way . 
  it 's just that crimean parlieament decided to voice their position ( not a very clean move if you ask me ) . 
  crimea is historically russian ( and tatar , yes , but going * that * back you must first gather all americans and send them back ) . 
  according to ukrainian constitution , current kiev `` government '' is nothing more than a bunch of thugs . 
  and it is owned by ukraine because ... ? 
  no , that 's according to ukrainian constitution . 
  so basically crimea is owned by ukraine because ukraine wants to own crimea . 
  oh really ? 
  `` on 17 march 1995 , the parliament of ukraine intervened , scrapping the crimean constitution and removing yuriy meshkov ( the president of crimea ) along with his office for his actions against the state and promoting integration with russia '', 
   it 's common belief , for example , that the us somehow `` creates '' gay people to invade russia with . 
  it 's common belief that the us poisons vodka to make it more dangerous . 
  it 's common belief that american spies are responsible for all manner of mishaps , including traffic accidents , plane crashes , and terrorist attacks . 
   access to healthcare or education for instance , both those things are visibly objects of bribery now, 
  what ? 
  are you sure you 're talking about modern russia ? 
  because that could be true in nineties , but not today . 
   a big reason why crimea is largely russian ethnicity today is because in 1944, 
  that 's wrong . 
  tatars were a minority there long before that . 
  also , please do n't forget to mention a reason for deportation : collaboration with nazis . 
   java has similar syntax to the c language which means that once you know how it works , you 're well on your way to c++ and c # . 
  common misconception . 
  syntax can be similar , but ideas behind it are completely different in c/c + + and java/c # . 
  c++ : multiple inheritance , no automatic memory management by default and several approaches to it ( gc , smart pointers , etc ) , outdated module system , turing-complete template system , syntax overloading , multiple-paradigm language through syntax overloading and templates . 
  java : single inheritance , ( almost ) everything is an object , mandatory gc , half-decent module system , no syntax overloading , no templates ( java generics look similar but actually are a completely different thing ) , oo is kind of forced . 
  yeah , totally familiar . 
  but , but !, 
  curly brackets are used in both languages to , uh , structure things !, 
  and that 's about it . 
  python has batteries . 
  seriously , name a thing , there is a python library for it or even several ( some can be outdated or not finished , though ) . 
  python is also rather slow , but that can be mitigated by re-writing `` bottleneck '' parts of your program into c ( python-c interaction is good ) . 
  if you 're serious about programming , i 'd start with some c. not c++ , mind me , but pure c. it 's a lingua franca of programming , you * will * need some knowledge of it . 
  according to knuth , that 's actually not a bad idea at all . 
  but from practical point of view , c is enough . 
  it 's not . 
  low-level , yes , complicated , not really . 
  come again ? 
  as far as i know , sevastopol is the only port capable of hosting russian navy as for now . 
  go learn some history , dude . 
  you are wrong . 
  there are no german nazi forces there to collaborate with , so crimean tatars are most certainly will not be deported this time . 
  hmm , photo evidence in this article is pretty convincing ... oh wait . 
  do you even read ? 
  historical population statistics [ edit ], 
  first quarter of 18th century -- 467,000 total inhabitants ( 95.1 % crimean tatars , 2.6 % greeks , 2.1 % armenians , 0.2 % krymchaks and karaites ), 
  1760s and 1770s -- 454,700 ( 92.6 % crimean tatars , 4 % greeks , 3.1 % armenians , 0.3 % krymchaks and karaites ), 
  1795 -- 156,400 ( 87.6 % crimean tatars , 4.3 % russians , 1.9 % greeks , 1.7 % gypsies , 1.5 % karaites , 1.3 % ukrainians , 0.8 % jews , 0.6 % armenians , 0.1 % germans , 0.1 % bulgarians ),

  1858 -- 331,300 ( 73 % crimean tatars , 12.6 % russians , 4 % ukrainians , 2.4 % greeks , 2 % gypsies , 1.8 % jews , 1.5 % germans , 1.3 % armenians , 0.8 % karaites , 0.6 % bulgarians ), 
  1864 -- 198,700 ( 50.3 % crimean tatars , 28.5 % russians and ukrainians , 6.5 % greeks , 5.3 % jews , 2.9 % armenians , 2.7 % germans , 1.7 % karaites , 1.6 % bulgarians ), 
  1897 -- 546,700 ( 35.6 % crimean tatars , 33.1 % russians , 11.8 % ukrainians , 5.8 % germans , 4.4 % jews , 3.1 % greeks , 1.5 % armenians , 1.3 % bulgarians , 1.2 % poles , 0.3 % turks ), 
  1917 -- 749,800 ( 41.2 % russians , 28.7 % crimean tatars , 8.6 % ukrainians , 6.4 % jews , 4.9 % germans , 2.9 % greeks , 1.6 % armenians , 1.4 % bulgarians , 0.8 % poles , 0.7 % turks ), 
  1920 -- 718,900 ( 44.1 % russians , 26 % crimean tatars , 7.4 % ukrainians , 6.7 % jews , 5.9 % germans , 3.3 % greeks , 1.7 % armenians , 1.5 % bulgarians , 0.8 % karaites , 0.8 % poles ), 
  1926 -- 713,800 ( 42.2 % russians , 25.1 % crimean tatars , 10.9 % ukrainians , 6.1 % germans , 5.5 % jews , 2.2 % greeks , 1.6 % armenians , 1.6 % bulgarians , 0.6 % karaites ), 
  1934 -- 832,000 ( 44 % russians , 23.8 % crimean tatars , 10.9 % ukrainians , 8.1 % jews , 6.1 % germans , 1.7 % armenians , 1.4 % bulgarians ), 
  1937 -- 996,800 ( 47.7 % russians , 20.7 % crimean tatars , 12.9 % ukrainians , 5.5 % jews , 5.1 % germans , 2. ,2 % greeks , 1,5 % bulgarians , 0,3 % karaites ), 
  1939 -- 1,123,800 ( 49.6 % russians , 19.4 % crimean tatars , 13.7 % ukrainians , 5.8 % jews , 4.5 % germans , 1.8 % greeks , 1.4 % bulgarians , 1.1 % armenians , 0.5 % poles ), 
  since mid-xix there is a clear trend , and since end of xix crimean tatars became a minority . 
  of course , deportation affected demography even further , but to word it so that tatars were a majority before stalin is to lie . 
  collaborating on state level in one thing , every country in europe did it ( munich agreement , for example ) . 
  personal collaboration after nazis showed their true face is completely another thing . 
  it 's not completely false , it 's just that * some * tatars collaborated , but * all * were deported . 
  stalin was n't known for subtlety or discretion . 
  manstein wrote about it in his `` verlorene siege '' . 
  strangely , english translation i 've managed to find in the net lacks about 3/4 of the source , including all info about tatar collaborators . 
  there is another source : http://www.iccrimea.org/scholarly/jopohl.html, 
  `` the germans formed six battalions and 14 companies of crimean tatars with 1,632 men by 15 february 1942 . 
  [ 13 ] in total , close to 20,000 crimean tatars served in german organized self-defense battalions during wwii . 
  [ 14 ] fighting against the nazis were an equally large number of crimean tatars in the red army . '', 
  the point is , it was not an ethnical cleansing for the sake of ethnical cleansing . 
  what 's 4chan ? 
   i said that the russians were n't a majority before the 20th century, 
   they were n't a majority until the 1944, 
  huh ? 
   you , however , did say, 
  not me , of course . 
   if you 're planning to invade a nation with the nazis , they 've already shown their true colors . 
  you 're trying to redirect discussion , that 's not good . 
  according to paul robert magocsi ( `` history of ukraine - 2nd , revised edition '' ) , `` many crimean tatars greeted the arrival of the germans as `` liberators '' from soviet rule . 
  [ ... ] german military in the crimea , in cooperation with crimean tatar leaders from the exile community in turkey ... organized among captured soviet soldiers several self-defence battalions . 
  these included nearly 20,000 crimean tatars who assisted germans in hunting down soviet partisans and other real or suspected anti-nazi elements . '', 
  my thoughts exactly . 
  it 's was n't 4chan who invented factual proof . 
  you 're comparing state-level agreement to people-level agreement . 
  apples to oranges , in other words .
