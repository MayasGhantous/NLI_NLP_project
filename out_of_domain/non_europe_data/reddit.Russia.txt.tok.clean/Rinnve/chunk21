  also , i did n't said that molotov-ribbentrop pact was ok . 
  those people started their `` western style democracy '' by installing oligarchs in positions of power . 
  til that photo evidence is n't a factual proof . 
  you should put `` interim '' in quites , this way you will look more aware of local traditions . 
  there is a russian saying : `` there is nothing more permanent than the interim . '', 
  i * attack * nobody . 
  and i repeat , political collaboration on government level and personal collaboration where one 's gladly greets invaders and offers them help - those two are comlpetely different things . 
   you keep trying to excuse collaboration with the nazis by one grou, 
  exactly how i 'm trying to excuse ussr government for molotov-ribbentrop pact ? 
   the crimeans, 
  crimean tatars . 
  crimean russians and crimean ukrainians did n't greet nazis and did n't willingly helped them to hunt down anti-nazi elements , as far as i know . 
   between 1917 and 1933 , 150,000 tatars -- about 50 % of the population at the time -- either were killed or forced out of crimea . 
  1917 -- 749,800 ( 41.2 % russians , * 28.7 % crimean tatars * [ ... ], 
  1934 -- 832,000 ( 44 % russians , * 23.8 % crimean tatars , * [ ... ], 
  something just does n't add up here . 
   stalin achieved his goal of expanding the russian population further south . 
  more like `` stalin achieved his goal of removing potentially unstable population that ca n't be trusted because , you know , may be not all but certainly a significant part of crimean tatars greeted nazi invaders and helped them to hunt down soviets . '', 
   you keep saying it 's different , to try to make it seem less bad . 
  it ca n't be less bad or more bad . 
  you ca n't compare government politics and actions of individual people . 
   i 'm pretty sure not every single crimean tatar collaborated with the nazis . 
  of course not . 
   you are so biased it 's ridiculous , there were ukrainians and russians who collaborated with the nazis as well . 
  how many of ** crimean ** ukrainian and russians helped nazis ? 
   because you 're a russian shill . 
  you 're seeing things . 
  percentages , man , percentages . 
  german generals did n't wrote about georgians or ukrainians in their memoirs that `` they were generally friendly and welcoming , and helped to hunt down anti-nazi elements '' . 
  i 'd start from * reading * sources for such programs . 
  there are open source spreadsheets and word processors , and some gui libraries has toy ones as examples ( ca n't quite remember , but quick googling for `` spreadsheet application example '' gave me [ this ] ( http://booksites.artima.com/programming_in_scala_2ed/examples/html/ch35.html ) ), 
   individuals who were crimean tatars collaborated with the nazis , stalin a georgian collaborated with the nazis . 
  are you high or what ? 
   you justify the deportation of tatars, 
  where exactly i * justify * it ? 
   so now it only matters if the collaborators were in the crimea, 
  we 're discussing crimea , not siberia or other region . 
   there 's no ethnic group such as crimean russians or crimean ukrainians , so there 's no way to know how many were in the crimea . 
  there is no way to know how many russians who lived in crimea collaborated with nazis ? 
  you * are * high . 
   once again you lie . 
  where exactly did i lie ? 
   i added up 46,000 russian collaborators, 
  compare that to 20,000 crimean tatars who served in `` self-defence '' battalions ; then compare total population of crimean tatars to total population of russians . 
  there * was * a reason for that relocation . 
  it is an error to consider it as an ethnical cleansing . 
  first , there are simpler open source apps . 
  second , it would put things in perspective . 
  real-world apps * are * big , there is no workaround for that . 
  first , i 'm hardly a `` putinite '' . 
  second , if i 'm supporting and defending anything , it 's historical facts . 
  identifiable photo * is * proof . 
  so you 're just dumb . 
  understandable . 
   we 're discussing collaborating with the nazis and it turns out more russians did it than tatars . 
  educate yourself . 
  start with concept of percentage , then read about what 's `` government '' is and how it is different from `` people '' . 
  then we can talk . 
   do you know how many russians from crimea collaborated with the nazis ? 
  in fact i do . 
  there was no organized collaboration . 
   defending russia 's anti-gay laws passed by putin, 
  defending ? 
   the tatars collaborated with the nazis and so did every other group in the occuppied territories, 
  46000 russians in nazi units all around ussr , out of about twenty millions or so russians who were living in the occupied territories . 
  20000 crimean tatars in nazi units in crimea alone , considering that they were a minority even there . 
  and 6 ( six ! ), 
  crimean tatars fighting against nazis in crimea . 
  that 's completely different level of collaboration . 
   i 'm dumb because i know that stalin was a georgian and that he collaborated with nazi germany in their invasion of poland . 
  no , because you do n't get the difference between government politics and personal actions . 
  what other kind of proof would work in this case ? 
  empty words ? 
  i 'm supporting the genocide in 1917-1933 by stating that there was no genocide according to historical facts ? 
  how nice . 
   did you know most tatars did not collaborate ? 
  do you have any historical proof to that ? 
   you posted a video to r/russia defending putin 's perdecution of homosexuals, 
  there is no law persecuting homosexuals in russia . 
  that 's the point of that video . 
  there is though continuing assault on free speech , and the law in question is a part of it . 
  somehow almost everybody miss that detail , focusing instead on non-existing problem . 
   failing to provide a source for crimeans . 
  sources are very easy to find , if someone wants to . 
  you 've managed to find sources on russians collaborating , i think your google skills will help you here too . 
   seems like the propaganda works pretty well . 
  next time try to actually watch the video before discussing it . 
   so you 're refusing to provide a source, 
  suddenly feel a little too lazy to find a source that may not quite fit in your world view ? 
  very well .
