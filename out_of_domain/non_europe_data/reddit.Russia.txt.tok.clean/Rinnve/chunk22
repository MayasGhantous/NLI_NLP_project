  putting aside nazi radical ideology , the german military in the crimea , in cooperation with crimean tatar leaders from the exile community in turkey ( cafer seydahmet and edige kirimal ) and in romania ( mustecip ulkusal ) , organized among captured soviet soldiers several self-defense battalions . 
  these included nearly 20,000 crimean tatars who assisted germans in hunting down soviet partisans and other real or suspected anti-nazi elements . '', 
  seriously ? 
  1897 -- 546,700 ( 35.6 % crimean tatars , 33.1 % russians , 11.8 % ukrainians ,, 
  1917 -- 749,800 ( 41.2 % russians , 28.7 % crimean tatars , 8.6 % ukrainians ,, 
  1920 -- 718,900 ( 44.1 % russians , 26 % crimean tatars , 7.4 % ukrainians ,, 
  1926 -- 713,800 ( 42.2 % russians , 25.1 % crimean tatars , 10.9 % ukrainians ,, 
  * ( here was the famine ) *, 
  1934 -- 832,000 ( 44 % russians , 23.8 % crimean tatars , 10.9 % ukrainians ,, 
  next time check your facts before posting bullshit . 
   not a real choice - the options boil down to `` becoming part of russia now '' or `` becoming part of russia later '' . 
  this is a lie . 
  options are `` becaming part of russia now '' or `` remaining part of ukraine on 1992 terms , that is before ukrainian government took away crimean autonomy '' . 
   so why should we disregard how the entire rest of ukraine 's population feels about the future of the region, 
  that 's why the referendum is hold in crimea , and not in ukraine or russia . 
  it is for crimean people to decide , not for outsiders , and the rest of ukraine are kind of outsiders because crimea was an autonomous republic from the start ; much of that autonomy was stripped by ukrainian government later though . 
  under * protection * of russian military forces . 
  it 's either that or under ukrainian guns : ukrainian goverment already decided for crimeans that they do n't want them to go . 
   minister that is a well known criminal from ( \u043b\u0438\u0445\u0438\u0435 ) 90s . 
  it would be nice to see some sources on that . 
   under guns they installed puppet minister, 
   under guns they made decision about referendum, 
  on that too . 
  as far as i know , armed men guarded government building , but there were no armed men in there . 
   people with intelligence and achievements, 
  achievements , may be . 
  intelligence , that can be argued . 
   that 's interesting yanukovich told that ukraine pays 529 usd, 
  what ? 
  that 's impossible price . 
  could you provide a source for that ? 
   the point is that ukrainians were forced to give up all their food . 
  not just to the soviet functionaries to meet quotas but also they were being hunted down to ensure they do n't have any food . 
  that 's actually not quite true . 
  `` do n't have any food hidden and not accounted for '' is closer to reality . 
   did that happen to russians living on the other side of the border ? 
  if so , i 'd be interesting in reading the evidence . 
  more that 1 mil russians died in `` ukrainian holodomor '' . 
  kazakhs suffered too . 
  so yes , that did happen to russians too . 
   it was n't by mistake and it was n't a consequence of a natural disaster . 
  that 's oversimplification . 
  there * were * mistakes , and there * was * natural disaster of sorts . 
  according to [ davis and wheatcroft ] ( http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/academic/harrison/reviews/davies-wheatcroft2004.pdf ) , ` we, 
  do not at all absolve stalin from responsibility for the famine . 
  his policies, 
  towards the peasants were ruthless and brutal . 
  but [ our ] story ... is of a soviet, 
  leadership which was struggling with a famine crisis which had been caused, 
  partly by their wrongheaded policies , but was unexpected and undesirable ... 
  above all [ these policies ] were a consequence of the decision to industrialise, 
  this peasant country at breakneck speed ' . 
   ukrainians were largely not allowed to cross the border into russia , and russian soldiers enforced the famine in ukraine , taking all food . 
  ukraine was unique in that it had confiscation not of just the harvest , but of food in general . 
  aid was also not allowed . 
  some were allowed to leave to russia to work , but they were not allowed to bring food back home when they done their labor placement . 
  where the hell did you get this bullshit ? 
   acclaimed historians ? 
  liiiiike ? . . 
   you should try reading a book , it 's an experience, 
  i 've read a plenty . 
   singled out ukraine by not giving it the same humanitarian aid given to regions outside it, 
  sorry it is in russian , use google translator . 
  somehow english version of wikipedia article on holodomor omits some facts that do n't quite fit in `` genocide '' model . 
  adamo jones who , sorry ? 
  yes . 
  some shit . 
  it could be a fake , of course , but there is one thing : google-verified dkim signatures . 
  so at least * some * of those emails are not fake , or it seems so ( i 'm not exactly good at crypto , sorry ) . 
   but what does that prove ? 
  it proves that there * was * humanitarian aid to ukraine . 
  well , kind of proves : wikipedia article is hardly a proof to anything . 
  you missed the point  adam jones popular science books just ca n't be compared to actual scientific studies . 
  it 's just on a completely different level . 
  the worst thing you can do is concentrate on your problems . 
  it makes them seemengly big and therefore hard to solve . 
  do n't be afraid to change your life , both in small and in big . 
  getting a girlfriend can be part of it or not . 
  yes , that one . 
  where are his , you know , scientific papers ? 
  not a compilation , but actual research ? 
  there are tons of documents , of course mainly in russian , some in ukrainian . 
  [ here is a good compilation . 
  ] ( http://mikle1.livejournal.com/3111743.html ), 
  not a fake , of course , but most of his writings look like popular science and/or compilations . 
  i can be wrong , but what i 'm certain of is that he is clearly not a historian . 
  compare that to [ wheatcroft ] ( http://shaps.unimelb.edu.au/about/staff/professor-stephen-wheatcroft ) , who is clearly focused on one historical episode of one certain country . 
  edit : added a source on wheatcroft . 
  elaborate , please ? 
  ( 1 ) [ here you are ] ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/0b59jez0xo88xthvcrmvyeuu3uwc/edit?usp=sharing ), 
  ( 2 ) of course not . 
  thing is , there are scientists who do research , and then there are scientists who do compilations ( `` research on research '' , basically ) . 
  that 's not a bad thing at all , but you just ca n't expect good in-depth view from the latter kind , that 's not what they do . 
  not sci fi . 
  less precise , more prone to errors , missing small but significant details . 
  it 's [ python dkim library ] ( https://github.com/ghewgill/pydkim ) , i think . 
  a little bit outdated , so additional check is required . 
   well known criminal, 
   alleged links, 
  does not compute .
