   with video, 
  this video does not shows that `` puppet minister '' was installed `` under guns '' . 
  were there reports of actual threats ? 
   well , whoever wrote this is not a native english speaker . 
  why so ? 
  thanks . 
  that 's interesting . 
  could you provide a source on that ? 
  kasparov.ru opens just fine right now . 
  til that rostelekom is `` most isps '' . 
  ca n't find anything on it , am i doing something wrong ? 
  til that navalny 's blog and kasparov.ru are major independent news sites . 
   there are plenty of people prepared to lead a country to a proper federal structure and a constitutional reform, 
  name one . 
   what astounds me about russians is how much shit they take and still support putin . 
  most russians do n't really care about opposition sites . 
  they care for salaries that are at least half-decent now and come without month long delays , for increasing quality of life , for crime and corruption that is kept in check . 
  on a lower level , it is kept in check . 
  arson is not considered an acceptable business practice anymore , for example . 
  you do n't need to bribe your way just to get something completely legal . 
  on a higher level , it is inevitable . 
  45000 rubles is quite a lot , but not unrealistic . 
  20000 is much more common . 
  renting decent 1-room apartment is about 7000-10000 rubles ( with all necessities like electricity , hot water and internet ) . 
  food can take 3000-4000 rubles/month . 
  those are approximate figures in central region ( voronezh , tambov , lipetsk ) . 
  no it was n't . 
  omg, 
  why food is so expensive in moscow ? 
  cost of living there is much higher too . 
   bunch of peaceful ukrainian protesters were killed in crimea, 
  that 's new . 
  source ? 
   lenin , who was a mass murderer, 
  so you do n't know history , like , at all .

  russian federation was multinational from the start and going to be that way till the end .

  your name is of welsh origin ; russian names are mostly slavic or greek . 
  so no , there is no local equivalent . 
  russian roulette dispatch 8 is on donetsk events . 
  donetsk is n't crimea , it 's mainland ukraine ; and no , there were no peaceful ukrainian protesters killed there . 
   hold a ` referendum ' on crimean independence under the watch of russian kalashnikovs, 
  [ relevant video showing people in bakhchysarai forced to vote under watch of russian kalashnikovs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htmoyx4_akg&amp;feature=youtu.be ), 
  no , not really . 
  at least i do n't see any particular `` collectivism '' or `` spirituality '' around ; pragmatic individualism , on other hand , is very noticeable . 
  crimeans do n't look like they are forced to vote . 
  bolsheviks were a minority once . 
  one can only wonder why history is forgotten so easily . 
  i believe it 's as close as it gets . 
  that 's a substitute . 
  `` butterflies in my stomach '' is about certain bodily feeling , it is not about general excitement or uneasiness . 
  why not ? 
  ask that to current ukrainian government , 'cause they already decided that crimean independence is out of question and threatened to enforce that . 
  ukrainian governments already proved themselves on failing to account to will of crimean people . 
  first one was back in ninetees when crimean autonomy was stripped off . 
  second one was just days ago . 
  that 's irrelevant . 
  point is , there are historical examples ( edit : derp ) of minor extremist parties suddenly gaining major power . 
  that was an error , obviously . 
  i know that . 
   trample on the rights of the crimean tartars ? 
  and rights of crimean tatars are restricted how , exactly ? 
   remember that stalin forcibly relocated the tartars once, 
  ok , let 's then start with remembering american natives . 
   the joke is that the gang running crimea are doing everything that they criticize the government in kiev of doing . 
  it 's not `` gang '' , it 's `` government '' . 
  they got all deported for collaborating with nazi . 
  crimea was n't mainly tatar before deportation . 
   to be fair , the only people who were n't transported were ethnic russians . 
  this is not true . 
  crimean tatars and germans ( crimean and otherwise ) were relocated . 
  besides ethnic russians , there also lived ukrainians , poles , jews , greeks and others . 
  in 2003 , mr. ignorant guy . 
  that was done in 2003 . 
  welcome to xxi century !, 
  i literally laughed out loud . 
  so usa waging war and bringing chaos on a whim is `` stable geopolitical situation '' ? 
  thing is , ukraine do n't want to let crimea go . 
  crimeans already tried to get an autonomy in ninetees . 
  crimea was part of russia for centuries , and part of ukraine for like twenty years . 
  haha no . 
  small city near tambov . 
  of course it is an invasion , so what ? 
  crimean russians live there for centuries , and you 're suggesting them to move to russia just because crimea recently became a part of ukraine almost by accident ? 
  that 's ridiculous . 
   while a typical american residence is a house ( with or without the white picket fence :-) , a typical russian residence is an apartment . 
  there is a reason for that , and it 's not a lack of income . 
  due to weather conditions , house would require more maintenance . 
  actually , houses are cheaper than apartments for that reason . 
   inability to purchase real estate due to lack of income and unfavorable lending terms results in parents sharing their quarters with children for quite some time . 
  income is all right now ( on a lowish side ) , but people in general just are n't used to having decent sum of money . 
  mortgage system is also still very new to us , very idea of being in debt for prolonged period of time feels just not right .
