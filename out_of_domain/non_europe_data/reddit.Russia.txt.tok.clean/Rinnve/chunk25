   if poland had a good idea for a car company russia would quickly dismantle it so they did n't have to deal with the competition . 
  i sense bullshit right here . 
  do n't know about polish cars , but hungarian-made buses ( `` ikarus '' ) were everywhere in ussr . 
  checz-made jawa motorcycles were also extremely popular . 
  polish hate for russians is much , much older than ussr . 
  edit : spelling . 
  thanks . 
  simplified procedure is in plans . 
  although , according to [ the law ] ( http://base.garant.ru/184539/2/ ) ( article 15.1 ) , it is required to live in russia for 3 years instead of 5 if person is former russian citizen . 
  i 'm no lawyer though , and i suggest you to find one if you 're serious about that . 
   because thats not what putin said . 
  november , 2013 : [ eu cold shoulders three-way talks with russia , ukraine ] ( http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/ukraine-diplomacy.rmn ), 
  further search showed [ this law project ] ( http://asozd2.duma.gov.ru/main.nsf/%28spravkanew%29?openagent&amp;rn=205755-6&amp;02 ) that was mentioned in ria article . 
  it was later rejected . 
  so it 's not even in plans . 
  of course it 's possible , why not ? 
   in the end everybody will lose, 
  usa gained quite a lot back then , if you know what i mean . 
  mad russophobe is mad . 
  it is already being done . 
  funny thing is that now visa and mastercard clearly showed the need for national ( or at least usa-independent ) card system , and by doing so cut their own profit . 
  yep . 
  ncr-made atms that are installed in russia are specifically tailored to be sluggish and glitchy . 
  sure . 
  and just so you know , there are several perfectly functional payment systems in russia . 
  not nearly as popular as visa or mc , but they do work just fine since the early nineties . 
  not exactly like that . 
  * may be * treated as fraud or money laundering . 
  it was merely a warning . 
   the problem is that there are almost no goods of any scale produced in russia . 
  one local journalist tried to live a month buying only russia-produced or at least branded products , and failed . 
   for example , farming is nonexistent in russia, 
   if you go to a russian supermarket ( almost no independent grocery stores , they are taxed with high state-controlled rent or raided with police ) , 80 % chance you buy meat , fruits or vegetables that were imported . 
  tl ; dr : industrial-scale bullshit that can be extremely easily debunked . 
  yeah , because you 've cited so many sources and facts ... oh wait , you did n't . 
   russia got the belgorod region from the ukraine . 
  source , please ? 
  as far as i know , belgorod region became part of rsfsr in 1918 . 
  `` on a turnout of 92 % , an overwhelming 99.8 % voted to remain a british territory , with only three votes against . '', 
  sure . 
  continuous form , = `` i 'm studying russian for two years . '', 
   the scary part is that propaganda machine is rampant in russia and it 's making people hate ukrainians . 
  what ? 
  nobody 's hating ukrainians here , except may be neonazi nutjobs . 
  they are not . 
  it is easy for native russian speaker to grasp ukrainian , those languages are very close , but they are still different . 
  ukrainian and russian were official languages in ukrainian ssr from the start to the end . 
  only russian was ussr-wide official language , though . 
  given two similar dialects , but one vastly more useful than another , the reason for speaking russian is obvious . 
  that 's because it is . 
  search for '' \u041f\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d '' in odnoklassniki ( russian social network popular amongst older people ) reveals about six thousand people with that name ( family name , to be precise ) . 
  `` * the western media * has underscored that both the crimean tatars as well as the ukrainian population of crimea were against joining the russian federation . 
  [ ... ] contrary to the reports of 135 international observers from 23 countries , * the western media in chorus has suggested without a shred of evidence that the elections were rigged * and that crimea was under russian military occupation . '', 
  it is sad to see sub-par reading skills in xxi century . 
  functional programming is still kind of bleeding edge , at least in production . 
  look up erlang , haskell , o'caml , f # , clojure and scala . 
  this paradigm makes concurrent programming much easier , so it inevitably will be used more and more . 
  tl ; dr : win + shift + s or change the shortcut in windows registry . 
   if us being wrong , people vote out the president and its party . 
  given insane amount of usa meddling with independent states for , like , last fifty years or so , voting out president and party changes nothing at all . 
  or , usa citizens do n't find it wrong . 
  do n't know which one is worse . 
  well , it is , but it is more than that . 
  erlang , for example , was completely pragmatic from the start ( ericsson invented it for programming their telecom hardware ) . 
  you can capture win8 app with share charm , at least if you have win8 version of onenote installed . 
  i ca n't find how to set screen capturing as default sharing option , though . 
  you 've completely missed the point . 
   if us being wrong , people vote out the president and its party . 
  if russia being wrong , nothing changes . 
   but knowing what we know about the russian government, 
  please share . 
  i know nothing that can suggest that `` it is far more plausible that he gave them access to everything than he gave them access to nothing '', 
  bull . 
  poland is just too far to the south , they ca n't into vodka . 
  finland , on the other hand ... 
  you heard wrong . 
  for example , there is this [ cathedral built in 1050 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cathedral_of_st._sophia,_novgorod ) . 
  ( although , to be fair , that 's an exception ; most landmarks that still stand are no older than about 400-500 years . ), 
  you miss one thing . 
  [ snowden did not had any documents with him . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/18/edward-snowden-no-leaked-nsa-documents-russia ), 
  edit : added link . 
  it is unclear whether those notebooks and thumbdrives had any ( leaked ) info . 
  imo , it would be very stupid of him . 
  either way , my [ question ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/218k2t/russias_new_ability_to_evade_nsa_surveillance_is/cgawk21 ) was not about snowden , it was about russian government . 
  source , please ? 
  so there is no law specifically aimed at crimea or , as it was stated , `` banning any discussion of returning crimea to ukraine '' . 
  i do n't think that there will be any future annexations . 
  it is pointless on many levels . 
  simple example . 
  image an article captioned `` millions of ukrainians are going to die '' . 
  article is about , say , car pollution in ukrainians cities and is not even related to the crisis . 
  is it technically correct ? 
  why , of course !, 
  everyone is going to die sooner or later . 
  is it sensationalist and misleading , while ( i repeat it ) being factually correct ? 
  yep , about 1.5 bln rubles ( about $ 43 mil by current exchange rate ) according to kozak . 
  just to compare , moscow city yearly income is about 1.5 trillion rubles ( about $ 43 billion ) . 
  it 's not like sochi was a serious strain for russian economy . 
  already done .
