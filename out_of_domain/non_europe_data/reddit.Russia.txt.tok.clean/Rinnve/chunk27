  i strongly disagree with you based on ( a ) statistical data i 've posted and ( b ) things that i see every day around myself . 
  it ca n't be compared precisely , of course . 
  but it can be used for rough estimates . 
  and it 's certainly much better than vague words about how `` poverty is quite big in russia '' . 
  also , [ there are other indicators ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/facts/topics/poverty ) , if you feel the need to go deeper . 
  for example , we can compare [ russia , poland and india poverty headcount ratio at $ 1.25 a day ( ppp ) ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/facts/indicators/si.pov.dday/compare?country=ru#country=in:pl:ru ) , so we can see what real poverty is . 
  could you please provide some examples on that ? 
  national poverty lines are not arbitrary , they are based on internal situation and living conditions . 
  this indicator can be read as `` how many people are living in bad conditions according to local criteria '' . 
  headcount ratio at $ x a day ppp is better indicator , but there is no data on most european countries . 
  i do n't remember putin claiming crimea as `` ancient russian land '' . 
  find `` always been russian '' here . 
  context clearly shows that it 's about `` gifting '' crimea to ukraininan ssr . 
  nowhere does putin state that crimea is/was `` ancient russian land '' . 
  more like 250 . 
  not exactly ancient , but you know , there are countries younger than that , and nobody discusses their legitimacy . 
   just for your information : crimea was forcefully russified only after wwii . 
  before that it was full of people who were n't in any way russian . 
  just for your information : this is wrong . 
  i mean , of course there was larger % of russians after tatars were relocated , but even before ( since the conquest of crimea ) there were many russians ( from ~ 30 to ~ 50 % in different periods ) . 
  that 's even before counting how many of other people were of russian culture ( like nikolai gogol who was ukrainian by birth and russian by everything else ) . 
   the ukrainian people didnt agree with their prime ministers descision to choose russia over their wishes . 
  some of ukrainian people . 
  some . 
  and those some people now decide for all ukraine . 
   the u.s didnt organize or fund protests . 
   you forgot to mention that non-crimean russians stole a lot of houses that crimean tatars used to live in before they were forced elsewhere . 
  stole ? 
  how one can steal something that is not owned anymore ? 
   russians only became a majority in crimea a few decades ago . 
  hell , russians are n't a majority in some parts of russian federation . 
  does it means that , for example , tatarstan is n't russian ? 
  no way . 
  if you state that russia has no business in crimea whatsoever , you just do n't know history . 
  plain and simple . 
  second one is more precise ( less ambiguous ) . 
  for example :, 
  but, 
  if you use '' \u0438\u0437\u0443\u0447\u0430\u044e '' , there is no ambiguity , you clearly are studying something . 
  but it 's longer , so it sounds a little bit more formal . 
  reporting done right . 
  there may be discrimination against asians . 
  it 's not that common and it 's depends on a region . 
  one of great things about classic kettlebells is that they are solid , they just ca n't fall apart somehow no matter what are you doing with them . 
  for example , you might be forced to drop it if the exercise goes wrong somehow . 
  i personally just do n't trust those fillable things . 
  simply put : it 's better than it was ten years ago , and it 's much , much better than it was twelve years ago . 
  of course , some people suffer , there is some corruption ( more on higher levels , less on lower ) , putin is kind of authoritarian . 
  nobody 's perfect , especially in a country that big . 
   from my perspective , life is tough there , especially outside of the major cities . 
  corruption is ridiculous , even on the most minor levels . 
  law enforcement is n't respected , and laws apply only to the poor . 
  may i ask you what cities did you visit , and are there some examples of this ridiculous corruption and other things you 've mentioned ? 
  i 'm not calling you liar or something , it 's just that what you 're telling here strongly contradicts with my experience and knowledge . 
   other minorities ** stalin ** murdered and deported . 
  he killed way more people than hitler . 
  i do n't undestand how people can defend ** russia ** in this case . 
  stalin was georgian , by the way . 
  and , more importantly , besides `` other minorities '' there were , you know , millions of actual russians who were murdered and deported too . 
  i do n't see how one can blame russia for stalin 's atrocities . 
   i think your perception is colored by the fact that you 're so used to it . 
  the thing is , i do n't remember a single account of corruption in last , say , ten years . 
  in nineties yes , it was unusual to get something without some * negotiations * . 
   last i heard , you could get out having to serve in the military or get into universities by paying ? 
  is that still happening ? 
  there is no real need to pay to get into university nowadays with current demographic situation and unified state exams . 
  may be it 's still happening sometimes , but it 's not common anymore as far as i know . 
  as for the military ... it 's lot better now , so most people just do n't see a point in evading it . 
  hell , half of boys in last year 's class actually * chose * military in one form or another ( i 'm a teacher in a school ) . 
  oh , it 's still possible to * negotiate * about it , it 's just ... not needed anymore . 
  it 's actually considered a bad thing now , not one that real man should do !, 
  ask anybody just fifteen years ago , and the answer would be that only losers serve in the army . 
  well , there were two cases ? 
  i did n't followed that , but yeah , russian tv is n't exactly known for neutrality . 
  that one thing did n't really improved . 
  there are , of course , other sources of info ; quick digging suggests that this whole thing is rather ... shady . 
  for example , an article on anton salonen case : `` anton was smuggled to finland in the closed trunk of a diplomatic car by the legal consul at the saint petersburg consulate , simo pietil\u00e4inen . '' other article on robert rantala case : `` according to finnish social authorities , it is unusual for foreign officials to intervene '' . 
  may be it 's just me , but i smell something a little bit contradictory there . 
  is something wrong with my eyes , or there is no `` photographic evidence '' in this article , like , at all ? 
   they 're members of anti-terrorist unit known as the alfa team, 
  i do n't see that written on their uniforms . 
  i do n't see any photos confirming that those guys are alfa team , or are even somehow connected to maidan snipers . 
  is n't it the other way around ? 
   i spent a lot of time in kirov . 
   if you get caught breaking the law , and your fine is 300 rubles , you can just bribe a cop with 150 rubles and he 'll take it . 
  just do n't try this shit if you * actually * go to russia because , you know , there could be one very happy cop and one very sad you serving some time for attempted bribe . 
  150 rubles , seriously ? 
  that 's not just a crime , that 's also an insult . 
  about that `` girl '' , first , let 's not pretend that shit like this happens only in russia . 
  second , on [ the case ] ( http://rusdtp.ru/page,1,6,11661-otec-otmstil-za-syna.html ) . 
  it was a boy , not a girl . 
  and father did n't wait for the investigation , he stabbed alleged culprit right on the spot . 
  so no , i do n't think that you `` spent a lot of time in kirov '' . 
  try harder next time . 
  post a link to your story . 
  i tried to find it in the news , but it just isnt there . 
  i 've posted the closest i could find that fits your description at least partly . 
  oh , and hearsay isnt truth . 
  onenote installs ie add-on that does exactly that . 
  there are also third-party chrome add-ons for that .
