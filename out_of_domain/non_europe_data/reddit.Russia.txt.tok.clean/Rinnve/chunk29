  lion 's share my ass . 
   just because russian 's shared in this tragedy does n't mean that we ca n't emphasize its impact on ukraine, 
  let me rephrase it : just because russians suffered too , we ca n't stop telling that it was russians who starved ukrainians to death . 
   people were prevented , because of their ethnicity , to move . 
  yes . 
  but it was not focused on ukrainians . 
  that 's my entire point . 
   the degree to which stalin used armed force to make sure that ukrainians especially had no food, 
  yep . 
  millions killed by stalin personally . 
  local ukrainian communists with their personal grudges against wealthy peasants ( `` kulaks '' ) were totally not involved in it at all . 
  local ukrainian peasants , who preferred to burn their crops and slaughter their cattle so it ca n't be taken away , were totally not involved too . 
  the thing is that there is no documental proof whatsoever that ukraine was targeted specifically , that there was some intent in starving them to death . 
  help that was sent to ukraine to stop famine is , on the other hand , very well documented . 
   but , of course , the claim that `` kulaks '' were actually `` wealthy farmers '' was basically just propaganda . 
  incorrect . 
  all wealthy farmers were `` kulaks '' , but not all `` kulaks '' were wealthy . 
  those who simply resisted collectivization where also treated as `` kulaks '' ( or , to be more precise , as `` podkulachniki '' ~ `` kulak cronies '' ) . 
   if you look at what they actually did , though , or at how ukrainians were treated compared to others , there is n't much doubt that they were being singled out . 
  i 'm very sorry , but in matters of history i trust only serious scientists ( specifically , stephen wheatcroft ) , and they did not found any proof to that claim . 
   if they were so `` oppressed '', 
  millions of russians died in gulag , millions starved to death during `` ukrainian '' holodomor . 
  do n't you dare , do n't you fucking dare to mock this history !, 
  yeah , so ? 
  that does n't means that there were no wealthy farmers . 
  communists invented the idea that wealthy somehow oppress or use their not-so-wealthy neighbours , they did not invent disparity in wealth . 
  it was used and translated as `` certainly '' . 
  nowadays it 's closer to `` maybe '' or `` probably '' . 
  it is usually `` more certain '' that '' \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c '' , but not by much ( at least in my perception ) . 
  it 's when big spoon is n't actually big enough to be , well , big spoon . 
  i though that something like [ this ] ( http://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/c9/a7/64/c9a7648d0f0f67d1028f3bfe09cb9d93.jpg ) is the source for this word . 
  wuala is pretty secure , as far as i know . 
  still do n't really trust anything close-sourced . 
  truecrypt containers ftw . 
  were there cases of google doing it ? 
  i mean , closing or freezing accounts for `` suspicious activity '' ? 
  til that ukrainian flag [ has stars on it ] ( http://ru.tsn.ua/politika/yevromaydani-v-ukraine-zaporozhe-porazhalo-kolichestvom-a-v-odesse-pamyatnik-dyuku-odeli-v-flag-es-335427.html ) . 
   the ukrainian government has reporting indicating that russian intelligence officers are directly involved in orchestrating the activities of pro-russian armed resistance groups in eastern ukraine . 
  in addition , the ukrainian government detained an individual who said that he was recruited by the russian security services and instructed to carry out subversive operations in eastern and southern ukraine , including seizing administrative buildings . 
  much evidence . 
  very legit . 
   whats so screwed up is the love russians have for a government who lies to them , kills their reporters and is dangerously close to a world war . 
  its sick . 
  so basically you know nothing about russia and it 's government except western propaganda . 
   we see, 
  if you see things , you should go to doctor . 
  seeing things is not good . 
   i know damn well that reporters were dropping like flies when putin was pm . 
  care to name a few ? 
   you do understand that we in the west havnt seen you guys as a threat since the cold war right ? 
  of course you did n't , our economy was in ruins . 
   we didnt really care to tell you the truth until russia started invading sovereign nations . 
  crimea is historically russian . 
  hundreds of years under russian control , several wars fought for that , and after twenty years it 's suddenly `` a sovereign nation '' ? 
  not bloody likely . 
  btw , somehow the west did n't pay notice to ukraine land-grabbing sevastopol in early nineties ( surprise surprise , crimea was transferred to ukrainian ssr but sevastopol * was n't * , it remained in rsfsr and answered directly to moscow as a strategically important military base ) . 
  if you think that the west ( or should i say those two letters again ? ), 
  could play good old bring-some-democracy games in ukraine like it 's just another not-really-significant country like syria , well , think again . 
  putin offered trilateral discussion on ukraine in iirc november 2013 , the west decided that ukraine should choose either west or russia . 
  well , that was a mistake . 
  transmission for windows ?!, 
  and here i 've almost lost all hope for humanity . 
  crap delivered is still crap . 
  had no luck whatsoever with those releases since teh beginning . 
  you do realize that they * already had it * , but then eu started to push this agreement of theirs * and * denied possibility of trilateral discussion offered by russian government back then in late 2013 . 
  oh , and then euromaidan events and coup fucked up it all . 
   the ccc had calculated that interception and storage of all of germany phone conversations would cost only 30m $ / year, 
  interception and storage is * not * data mining . 
  data mining is analyzing all that stored information . 
  without it , intercepted info is completely useless : finding proverbial needle in a hay stack would be child 's play compared to finding `` interesting '' data in terabytes of phone conversations . 
   their deal was n't as good as the one offered by the eu, 
  do you even read ? 
  too bad that iss is not autonomous . 
  there is no escape, 
   got bullied by an ethnic , ** opressed , ** minority . 
  something does n't sound right . 
  yep . 
  that word . 
  you do n't deserve one . 
   i know damn well that reporters were dropping like flies when putin was pm . 
  some samples :, 
  1993 ( yeltsin ) - 10 deaths, 
  1996 ( yeltsin ) - 18 deaths, 
  1999 ( putin ) - 11 deaths, 
  2002 ( putin ) - 22 deaths ( war reporting is dangerous business , duh ), 
  2009 ( ** putin was pm ** ) - 6 deaths . 
  there is no correlation whatsoever between journalist death rate and president 's name . 
  so it is confirmed that you see things . 
  i care about that word , fuck the spelling . 
  ukrainians were hardly oppressed , no more than russians . 
  it is wiser to shut up when you have nothing to say . 
  you should educate yourself . 
  it was not a genocide , and it was not aimed at ukrainians ( death rates in that famine were about 3 mil ukrainians , 1.5 mil russians , 1 mil kazakhs ) . 
  i 'd recommend stephen wheatcroft 's works , namely `` years of hunger '' . 
   i read him only in russian and i loved it . 
  which translation , may i ask ? 
  i 've always wanted to read that book , but i do n't know spanish and i 'm very wary of translations . 
  english pronunciation varies wildly from place to place , to the extent that some dialects sound almost like completely different language . 
  it is not so with russian and ukrainian . 
  ( there are regional accents , of course , but they are much less obvious . ),
