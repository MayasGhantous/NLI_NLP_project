  this too , yes . 
  but in my opinion linguistic purism is just as bad as overuse of loan words . 
  language must evolve . 
  they do n't do music . 
  they are not a punk rock band . 
  they just do stunts and pranks to gather publicity and then to use this publicity . 
  look up their other doings , it 's quite disgusting actually . 
  also \u042f\u043d\u043a\u0430 \u0414\u044f\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430 was not murdered by the kgb , her death just was n't investigated properly ( and i seriously doubt that kgb would care enough to set up murder ) . 
  ok , imagine that they were not sent into prison for ... `` disorderly conduct '' , as it , if i 'm not mistaken , is called in us . 
  not only random disorderly conduct , but one done in a place of a great religious importance . 
  ok , no prison , just some reasonable fine or public service . 
  next week we would have a ton of wannabes and attention whores in churches across all the russia . 
  religious tension is the last thing russia needs . 
  and mind me , prison for this kind of criminal offence is completely lawful , at least in a sense that you can expect prosecution for some deeds . 
  it 's not that you do some seemingly minor thing and then suddenly find yourself cut off for two years . 
  it 's all in the law . 
  ok , not all , it 's russia after all , but still . 
  it has nothing to do with rebellion of any sort , but yes , as i see it , it was mainly a discouragement . 
  a cathedral is different from other public place because people that gather there belong to a certain social group . 
  hooliganism that is aimed at certain social group ( vs. general hooliganism like bar brawl ) is prosecuted more seriously . 
  well , that particular stunt was not precisely aimed at orthodox christians , but judge decided that it sort of was . 
  quite reasonably , i think : many christians took that stunt quite personally and were deeply insulted . 
  it 's not just a cathedral , you know . 
  it is the cathedral . 
  most important one for all orthodox christians in all russia . 
  there is nothing to translate . 
  they failed . 
   would you basically just pronounce the original word without the \u044f ? 
  definitely not . 
  second '' \u0438 '' reads just like any other '' \u0438 '' ( as in `` see '' ) , it is slightly accented , just so one can distinguish between two '' \u0438\u0438 '' and a bit too long '' \u0438 '' . 
  russian pronunciation is mostly close to writing . 
  ( well , not always , but you ca n't get really wrong with overly careful pronunciation ; it can sound funny , but that 's it . ), 
  split word into syllables , pronounce syllable by syllable . 
  for each syllable pronunciation is fixed . 
  - \u0438 is always pronounced like - \u0438 ( sound like in `` see '' ) , - \u043b\u0438 - is always - \u043b\u0438 - and so on . 
  ( that 's actually how russians learn to read : syllable by syllable . 
  fluid reading comes later . ), 
  edit : i 'd like to clarify that in contrast to english , there is no such thing as several letters combining to produce different sounds ( '' - ee '' in `` see '' , '' - ugh '' in `` laugh '' , `` th - '' in `` then '' and so on ) . 
  if there are two letters , there must be two distinct sounds , even if it 's the same letter repeated twice . 
  ( in fact , `` reading by letters '' is a step before `` reading by syllables '' ; this step is often overlooked because reading by letters is unnatural and syllables start to form almost immediately . ), 
  start with / r/russian wiki ( get started learning russian , it 's right here --  ), 
  russia is big . 
  i mean , really , really big . 
  in some places you 'll be perfectly safe , even more so as you 're foreigner . 
  in other places you can be in danger , even more so as you 're foreigner . 
  as far as i can tell , do n't come close to caucasian regions . 
  people can be very , very hospitable there , but on the other hand there still is some uneasiness , nationalism and religious zealotry , and there is non-zero probability of serious trouble ( `` serious '' as in `` taken hostage for money '' or `` beaten to death for lulz '' ) . 
  european core - moscow and surrounding regions - is mostly safe , on par with your general european or us cities . 
  as for ural regions and further to east , i do not know personally . 
   as a general rule , raw tap water in russia is considered not suitable for drinking, 
  i do n't know where did you get this `` general rule '' , but it 's not correct . 
  tap water is mostly okay here . 
  it can be unbalanced on some minerals , but it in no way is contaminated or something . 
  well , i live in russia too ( tambov region ) , and i use tap water quite often . 
  we usually filter and boil it just in case , but honestly it 's overkill . 
  you definitely should learn c. it 'll make lower-level things much more clear . 
  as for c++ , i would n't touch it with three feet long stick . 
  it is so ugly and so wrong on so many levels , and ( more important ) it will not teach you anything new . 
  why ? 
  that 's disgusting . 
  i take it you ca n't imagine yourself in the middle of that pic . 
  or , even worse , do imagine it not in the middle . 
  we had no liberty nor security worth mentioning , so please kindly fuck off . 
  i get it . 
  it 's not a picture that is disgusting , but a comment . 
  two proofreaders are better than one , i guess . 
  message it . 
  it can sound a bit off , but still . 
  dont focus on that . 
  proper rolling r is not that important . 
  it even can be kind of cute if you cant do it - but only if you get it right on other aspects . 
  what ? 
  nonsense . 
  it 's a custom , nothing more . 
  ( well , in * certain * families it * can * be considered as necessary . 
  in other families though it can be viewed as a nuisance , especially if gifts are not well-thought . ), 
   also what should i be mindful of when i am there ? 
  do your research . 
  i do n't know how much you know about russia , but the thing is that general outside view is kind of skewed . 
  be open minded and curious ( in a polite form ) , keep in mind that anything that you know about russia can be false , and you will be all right . 
  \u0419 is not a sound by itself ( well , it kind of is , but it is never or almost never used by itself ) . 
  it mostly combines with other vowels to change them . 
  take your example - yoga . 
  it 's '' \u0439\u043e\u0433\u0430 '' in russian , but it 's pronounced as '' \u0451\u0433\u0430 '' . 
  if you know how to pronounce '' \u0451 '' , '' \u044e '' , '' \u044f '' , then just analyze those vowels . 
  first short part of the sound is '' \u0439 '' . 
  not exactly . 
  it is a * song * `` vdv '' , performed by alexander buinov ( \u0411\u0443\u0439\u043d\u043e\u0432 ) . 
  and you are right : `` zapoi '' is one of most important symptoms of alcoholism in it 's clinical stage . 
  that 's actually pretty sad that we have a special word for such thing . 
  you got it wrong . 
  withdrawal from society is not really important part of `` zapoi '' . 
  the most important , most dangerous and saddest part is that you ca n't stop . 
  it 's a downward spiral leading to self-destruction . 
  that 's when society must step in . 
  no , i 'm not speaking about forcing down the price tag ; i 'm speaking about help . 
  if society cares , $ 300 price tag is not really a problem . 
  all those foundations do exist for this , at least in theory . 
  edit : it seems that those are not policemen , but a students . 
  well , students are being students : shrugs :,
