   nazi insignias, 
  as i said , wheatcroft works are quite good ( soviet history of that period is his specialty after all ) . 
  you can start with that paper : http://www.melgrosh.unimelb.edu.au/documents/davies_wheatcroft_ch.4_famine.pdf, 
  those armbands sport [ wolfsangel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wolfsangel#nazi_symbolism ) . 
  error 403 . 
  since when suggestion to get more informed is ad hominem ? 
   around the time that the soviet union emerged , so did a new band of criminals known as vor v zakone, 
  so the author has no idea what he is talking about . 
   you have no clue how well informed i am on the subject . 
   their deal was n't as good as the one offered by the eu, 
  apparently i have . 
  you 're consuming too much propaganda and too little factual information . 
  you should look up definition of `` ad hominem '' . 
   dissenting russian journalists getting killed, 
  not true . 
  name one journlalist killed for just `` dissenting '' , and not crossing some criminal . 
   russian musicians being receiving hard jail time for trivial offenses, 
  not true . 
  pussy riot girls are not musicians , and what they did was not a trivial offense . 
   annexation of crimea, 
  not true . 
  crimean people voted for that . 
  they were not forced to do it . 
   anna politivskaya leaps immediately to mind . 
  aaaand her death was ordered by boris berezovsky , who actually * opposed * putin . 
   dismissing 300 murders over the past 20 years as `` propaganda '' is just ... 
  you have some trouble with text comprehension ? 
  nobody is dismissing those murders . 
  somebody though is incorrectly claiming that those were done by russian government ( for dissenting against it ) . 
   just because you do n't like or agree with their music, 
  they do n't make music . 
  that 's why they are not musicians . 
  they make public stunts . 
  it is not important for what they did and what they got for it ; but naming them `` musicians '' is a cheap propaganda move . 
  `` oh look , innocent musicians got jailed for petty crime ! '', 
   non-violent political speech, 
  what they did was not `` non-violent political speech '' . 
   all outside election observers banned, 
  yet another lie . 
  there were outside observers . 
  osce refused to send their observers . 
  you said you do n't have time for this shit . 
  anyways . 
   yes , many investigators are claiming that journalists and human rights activists are being killed by the russian government . 
  yep . 
  example from the article on markelov . 
  `` according to russian military analyst pavel felgenhauer , the details of the murder indicate the involvement of russian state security services . '' which details , one can ask ? 
  `` the use of a gun with a silencer '' . 
   explain how pussy riot putting on an unscheduled , unapproved musical performance in a church is more than a petty annoyance ? 
  many of russian people are quite religious . 
  it 's not `` a church '' , it 's * the * church . 
  it was not just neutral `` musical performance '' : their `` lyrics '' were pretty offensive . 
  to provide you with an analogy , let 's imagine similar `` musicians '' in , say , germany . 
  they put similar `` uscheduled musical performance '' in some relatively important building - say , reichstag . 
  will they be prosecuted ? 
   a church in russia is the same as the german parliament building ? 
  i already told you , it 's not just `` a church '' . 
  but okay , let 's find better analogy . 
  will those imaginary `` musicians '' - or , better , performers - will they be prosecuted for their unapproved musical performance in ged\u00e4chtniskirche ? 
   the new ( ish ) law requiring all communications to be recorded for until six months after last use, 
  not correct . 
  all * information about * communications . 
  in other words , who called who at what time , not actual call . 
  rutracker.org has tons of scans , especially of older books . 
   if only crimea was asserting independence . 
  are you talking about the referendum of 1991 , which was basically ignored by ukraine ? 
  i seriously hope that not all of americans are that stupid . 
   and russia 's slogan is `` russia for russians, 
  no , that 's slogan that is used by dumbass neo-nazis who do n't even know russian history . 
  dude , romainians and romani are two completely different people . 
  who told about human right activists ? 
  pussy riot are not human right activists , they are radicals . 
  and it seems so that radical musicians can be jailed in germany all right : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/landser_ ( band ) #legal _ action . 
  so much for the freedom of speech . 
  you see , speech is either free or not . 
  speech ca n't be partially free . 
  eu jails neo-nazis just for their ideas , russia goes a little bit further , but there is no practical difference . 
  also , i still do n't get how public swearing and verbal offence can count as `` human rights activism '' . 
   eu offers a far better deal than russia, 
  state of human freedoms is irrelevant when we speak economy and trade . 
  all that eu offers is to turn ukraine into a pool of cheap labor force . 
  snowden asked about global surveillance , sorm is targeted surveillance ( some metadata is gathered indiscriminately though , but is stored only for half a year ) . 
   as for mere swearing and verbal offense , there 's a saying : `` sticks and stones may break my bones , but words can never hurt me . '', 
  words either can hurt , or they ca n't . 
  it 's for you to choose , but you ca n't say that words ( not actions ! ), 
  can be dangerous and in the very next sentence say that they ca n't hurt . 
  it is still very popular , but more so amongst adults who ca n't into computers ( mostly 40 + ) vkontakte is more popular amongst socially and politically active youngsters . 
  well , typical vk user is `` progressive '' `` youngster '' compared to typical ok user , or at least it appears so . 
   i know damn well that reporters were dropping like flies when putin was pm . 
   1996 ( yeltsin ) - 18 deaths, 
   2009 ( putin was pm ) - 6 deaths . 
  i have nothing else to say to you . 
  ukraine was never called novorossia . 
  however , there was a region in russian empire that was called novorossia . 
  this region now is part ukrainian , part russian . 
   cops are paid very little . 
  it is n't really a living wage . 
  are you sure about that ? 
  how little is it ? 
   actual facebook withdrew from russia,
