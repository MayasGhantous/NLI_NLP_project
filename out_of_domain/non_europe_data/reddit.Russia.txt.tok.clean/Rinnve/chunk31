  aaaand another delirious redditor goes to the list of , you know , delirious redditors . 
  vk is hardly a facebook clone . 
  was one , not anymore . 
  usability is on a completely different level . 
  next time do n't forget to mention cost of living . 
  i bet they 'll be shocked too . 
  moscow wages are n't exactly low too . 
  according to my sources , police officer in moscow makes at least 40000 rub . 
  somewhat low compared to hitech jobs , but certainly not below the cost of living . 
  you should start with another question : what for ? 
  in other words , sensationalist title . 
  never did . 
  it is , dummy . 
   i know damn well that reporters were dropping like flies when putin was pm . 
   ** 1996 ( yeltsin ) - 18 deaths **, 
   ** 2009 ( putin was pm ) - 6 deaths . 
  i have nothing else to say to you . 
   i know damn well that reporters were dropping like flies ** when putin was pm . 
  from what i can see , it 's not really a problem . 
  there is * some * influence like people sometimes saying '' \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435\u0441\u044c '' instead of '' \u0441\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0441\u044c '' ( both words have basic meaning `` to sit down '' or `` to get a seat '' , but latter also have slang meaning `` to go to jail '' ) or '' \u043f\u0435\u0442\u0443\u0445 '' used as an insult ( `` cock '' , prison slang for passive homosexual men , basically lowest caste , untouchables ) . 
  but to say that the prison culture has became dominant ? 
  no , that 's total b.s. 
  well , may be that 's your experience . 
  not mine . 
  ever heard of not going circles around your point ? 
   the prison culture is so ingrained in russian culture nowadays, 
  care to provide some support for that statement ? 
  do n't know about `` most respects '' , but prison and gang culture is certainly much less visible now . 
   a true hope of genuine democracy - \u00e0 la arab spring / egypt, 
  is there one case of said `` true hope '' becoming reality ? 
   let me say you probably do n't watch a lot of russian movies . 
  name then a couple of russian movies that use obscene lexicon . 
   obscene lexicon is integral to the portrait of russia . 
  no it is not . 
  that 's an exception , like \u0414\u041c\u0411 ( '' \u0431\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 , \u0438\u0445\u0442\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u044b \u0445\u0443\u0435\u0432\u044b '' never fails to crack me up ) . 
  most films do n't use `` hard '' swearing ( \u043c\u0430\u0442 ) . 
   do you really not understand that the only thing ban achieves is a distortion of reality ? 
  distortion ? 
  no , not really . 
  using \u043c\u0430\u0442 in public performance is not unlike using explicit sexual scenes ( read : porn ) . 
  there 's a reason for porn being restricted , and there 's a reason for \u043c\u0430\u0442 being restricted too . 
   except stalin is still a national hero, 
  wrong . 
  strong leader , may be , who did many things right , but just as many things he did were wrong . 
  so a leader can be either a national hero or a horrible tyrant , amirite ? 
   but for some reason , stalin still gets sooo much love in russia . 
  it would be interesting to see some factual proof for that statement . 
  internet poll ? 
  seriously ? 
  second link is more legit , but does n't actually proves your point : `` in the carnegie poll last year , 42 percent of russian respondents named stalin as ** the most influential historical figure . 
  ** '' not a national hero . 
  those eyes ... 
  it 's beyond beautiful . 
  it 's 150 years , actually . 
  dunno about putin bots , but i do like the truth . 
  too bad that you 're lying scum . 
  but `` at least 15 years in prison for separatism '' is a lie . 
   wizard of earthsea followed by tombs of atuan and the farthest shore, 
  i ca n't second this enough . 
  honestly , i love those much more than left hand of darkness . 
  aaaaand downvotes for only reasonable answer . 
  / r/worldnews is being itself . 
  computer games , it reference materials . 
  that 's where it started . 
  next i 've noticed that translations ca n't quite translate it all . 
  then it all kind of snowballed, 
  mobile device `` manufacturer '' , that would be more precise . 
  had a horrible experience with a tablet of their `` making '' : the firmware was sluggish as hell , and they stopped updating it after less than a year after releasing that tablet . 
  ended up downloading the firmware from another `` manufacturer '' ( apparently they used the same hardware , but at least that another `` manufacturer '' managed to build a usable firmware ) . 
  totally would not recommend . 
   and an economy that produces basically nothing beyond energy and raw materials . 
  very common mistake . 
  russia produces basically everything , may be not quite on par with external alternatives , but russian cars are good enough to drive you from point a to point b and russian computers are good enough to run modern linux ( chips are overpriced though , so they are used only in extra sensitive areas like military ) . 
  all this is just barely visible compared to absolutely massive energy and raw materials exports , but it 's still there . 
  who do you think buys all that is produced by russian factories and farms ? 
  some russian products are indeed 3rd rate , but not all , and they are often way cheaper than imports . 
  one of the reasons why russia exports little besides energy and raw materials is that many of other products are consumed by russians themselves . 
  surprisingly sane and well thought article . 
  well done , washington post . 
  yep , russian computer chips industry lags like about ten years behind , but let 's not forget that it 's self-sufficient . 
  this is important when we 're talking about nsa and similar shit . 
  do n't know about nuclear rockets , but `` in 2013 , russia carried out 32 of the 82 space launches completed worldwide , only one of which failed . '', 
  it is often good to actually read an article before discussing it . 
  `` proton '' rocket , it 's just how it 's named . 
  `` proton-m '' , to be precise ( `` m '' stands for `` modernized '' ) . 
  bombing civilians is a very ... interesting way of respecting sovereignty . 
   great purge of the crimean tatars by russians in the 19th century, 
   they even do n't allow double citizenship and foreign banks accounts for example . 
  thank you for demonstrating that you do n't know shit about russia . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/buran_ ( spacecraft ), 
  buran was the first space shuttle to perform an unmanned flight , including landing in fully automatic mode . 
  us recently : fuck the eu . 
  damn , never knew it was this many . 
  still , buran did managed to land on full auto . 
  who knows what would grow out of it . 
  '' \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 '' ( `` commander 's '' ) clock series was well known for precision and durability . 
  sadly , nowadays their quality is much lower . 
  '' \u042d\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 '' ( `` electronics '' ) digital watches where also pretty good , my father had one for about twenty years ; it was hit by a sledgehammer once seriously damaging my father 's arm but leaving only minor scratch on the clock . 
  sadly , after twenty years capacitors started to leak and the clock stopped working . 
  where exactly did you grew up ?
