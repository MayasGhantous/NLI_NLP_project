  `` north korea 's new leader , kim jong un , supports an agreement to build a natural-gas pipeline from russia to south korea via his communist state , the russian envoy in pyongyang said . 
  sometimes it is good to actually follow provided link and , you know , read stuff . 
  tl ; dr : you 're wrong . 
   did the ~ 20m deaths caused by collectivization, 
  you 're exaggerating it by almost three times . 
  source ? 
  that depends on the size of the map . 
  on my 720 here works just fine for my city , but in moscow it crashes almost immediately . 
  it 's `` semyon '' . 
   having those troops vote in a rigged `` election '', 
   and never was . 
  do you have some proof to that ? 
   they are lying because it 's not a screen from a site , but their own picture they 've written . 
  oh really ? 
  provide some proof to that . 
   what are they trying to say by that picture is obvious, 
  yes , and it is `` wtf is happening right now '' . 
  anything besides it is your fantasy and nothing more . 
   cvk.gov.ua is not even a source of the fucking picture it does n't even look like that . 
  are you aware that an owner of a website can , you know , * change * pages on it ? 
   also those retards do n't know that tigipko 's father 's name is leonid which starts with ` l' and not with ` a ' as in their picture . 
  or , you know , those people who actually changed web page did n't knew that or made a typo . 
   loosk like fasctist are back in business hide yo kids , hide yo wife , hide yo husband cus they are comming for ya, 
  as i 've already said , that 's your fantasy and nothing more . 
   there is no page with that design . 
  there is no page with that design * at this moment * . 
  this proves absolutely nothing . 
  acceptable proof would be , i do n't know , may be video of that site that shows periodically updated page . 
   you are saying that automated site while refreshing the numbers somehow changed the name and made a typo ? 
  people who had access to site 's db made a typo . 
   common sense is something that you lose after watching too much russian news . 
  so that fantasizing of yours is common sense now ? 
  it is absolutely clear what tv reporters said . 
   maybe you will get one that proves their fake is n't one ? 
  you 're stating that it is fake , the burden of proof is on you . 
   yeah i give you a picture of a site, 
  this picture of yours proves absolutely nothing . 
  such minor change in appearance can be done in several minutes . 
   because clearly they changed design in the process of the voting, 
  because clearly they changed design * after * the process of the voting , adding the side bar . 
   because no one changes design for no reason moreover so dramatically, 
  there was no ` dramatic ' change of design . 
   find me one picture of it without a panel . 
  there is a certain youtube video with that picture . 
   also it seems that you do n't know much about web development , this change can not be done in few minutes , nor it may be done in few hours . 
  i know all about web development . 
  and yes , it can be done in few minutes . 
  there is no redesign , only some blocks were moved around . 
   it was n't changed it 's just fake, 
  you still did not provided proof that it was not changed . 
   those blocks that are present on the left panel just do n't exist on the picture . 
  there is nothing simpler than to enable or disable a block on a web page . 
   you still have n't provided proof that it was ever changed . 
  it is you who state that that tv reporter had lied , the burden of proof is on you . 
  ( yeah , it is hard to proof correctly , but this does not matters . ), 
  there are serious problems with novorossiysk ( something to do with nasty strong wind from local mountains ) . 
  what 's worse , the interim government said that it plans to stop hosting russian fleet in sevastopol by 2017 ( the leasing contract was to be prolonged by that date ) . 
  i 'm not sure , most probably it was discussed somewhere on / r/russia back then when crimea was a thing . 
   the butthurter, 
  probably the best translation . 
   thirteen countries, 
  i hope that you 're aware that there are much more countries in the world . 
  hence , ` most ' . 
   the holodomor was deliberate and malicious, 
  there is no proof to that . 
  more important , there is proof to the contrary ( for example , historical documents about help that was sent to suffering regions ) . 
  for more info , read up ` years of hunger ' by davies and wheatcroft . 
  kulaks were not ` ukrainian speaking farmer ' . 
  by definition , a kulak is wealthy farmer who uses hired force ( poor neighbor peasants ) , forcing said hired force in an endless circle of debt and servitude ( working on kulak 's fields , people do n't have enough time to work on their own fields , do n't have enough food to survive winter and do n't have enough money to buy food , take a loan from kulak : food for work next season ; hence the name : kulak literally means `` fist '' in russian ) . 
  that part about circle of debt was ignored in practice though , so any farmer or peasant with a bit of wealth was labeled as `` kulak '' . 
   if you cross reference it with map of areas which suffered the most from holodomor it is easy to draw conclusion that holodomor was an act of genocide against ukrainians, 
  are you aware that about half of red part of this map ( part that suffered the most ) is not ukraine ? 
  rostov , stavropol , krasnodar , crimea - that 's all russia . 
  yep , and more that on lower levels ( like low level party officers reporting unrealistic numbers and then squeezing those numbers out of peasants , although that 's not the only reason of that famine ) . 
   the holodomor was more targeted than the holocaust . 
  you forgot to quote `` according to one estimate '' . 
  even then , according to the same author ( sergei maksudov ) :, 
  ( `` but we can not agree with the fact that their victims were people of only one nationality or citizens of one country . 
  ukraine under their action is equal to all the villagers got : ukrainians , russian , jews and bulgarians . 
  large losses suffered population of crimea , is not included then in ukraine . 
  a ukrainian donetsk region opposite was in the highest category of supply , where , except it included only moscow and leningrad . 
  in 1933 there by rail was imported 1263 tons of grain , about 300 pounds per person per year , 62,000 tons of meat and 73,000 tons of fish - huge numbers for the hungry time . 
  in the 1933 importation was higher than in 1932 and 1934 adjacent years , ie the government , apparently compensated donbas reduction in local production . 
  seven other regions of ukraine , whose population is 15 times larger than the number of inhabitants of donetsk region got together only 20,000 tons of meat and 130,000 tons of fish . 
  kiiv 1935 . 
  suffered greatly from hunger rostov region , stavropol and krasnodar region , middle and lower volga and kazakhstan ; bread for sale in the markets in these regions have not been resolved . 
  at the same time , january 23 , 1933 the ban was lifted with farm trade in grain in kiev and vinnitsa regions fulfilled the plan of grain . 
  thus , neither ukraine nor ukrainians can not separate itself as a group of people deliberately exposed to destruction by famine . 
  they suffered just like many other rural and urban residents of the ussr , in some cases much more , in others - less .
