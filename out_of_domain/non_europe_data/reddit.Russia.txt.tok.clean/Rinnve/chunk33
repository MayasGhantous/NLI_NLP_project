  guess what slot machine clubs did ? 
  they renamed themselves as `` gaming clubs '' and when you buy credits , they name it `` a membership fee '' . 
  problem solved . 
  well , do n't know about other cities , but in my city this trick worked for a year or two . 
  as of today , no slot machine clubs or ` gaming clubs ' or ` internet clubs ' ( yep , they tried that too : touch-screen terminals with some slot machine emulator masked as ` just another internet site ' ) . 
  local anti-alcohol law is working just fine as well ( you ca n't buy any alcohol after 21:00 or before 8:00 ) . 
  compared to what was just a few years ago , the difference is very visible . 
   not having any water supply, 
  that 's not a correct description of current situation in crimea . 
  they have enough drinking water . 
  problem with water for agricultural needs is being resolved , as far as i know . 
  that depends on where are you living , i guess . 
  `` ordering civilian vessels off lithuania to change course twice this week and once in april , referring to safety concerns due to military exercises '', 
  how 's that a harassing ? 
  aaaand downvotes incoming . 
  how dare you to actually read the article !, 
  could n't find it in the article . 
  am i blind or ... ? 
  `` the ministry of foreign affairs expressed concern due to recurring russian military fleet actions in the lithuanian ** exclusive economic zone ** '', 
  this is very different from `` luthuanian waters '' . 
  according to wikipedia : `` the difference between the territorial sea and the exclusive economic zone is that the first confers full sovereignty over the waters , whereas the second is merely a `` sovereign right '' which refers to the coastal state 's rights below the surface of the sea . 
  ** the surface waters , as can be seen in the map , are international waters . 
   given that the building was an administrative center for the self declared lpr , and that an elimination of the lpr leadership would bring a definite military advantage, 
  by the same logic , it is very simple to justify almost anything . 
  for example , razing an entire city with all civilians in it , if there is enemy 's leader among them . 
   the law does n't say what `` promoting '' homosexuality means, 
  it does , actually . 
  \u0418\u0410 '' \u0413\u0410\u0420\u0410\u041d\u0422 '' : http://www.garant.ru/hotlaw/federal/481408/#ixzz33f3pkw1z, 
  why so butthurt ? 
  considering how many very well fit people i see daily , healthy food in russia is not hard to get at all . 
  of course that 's in heavily agricultural region ( tambov oblast ) , but still . 
  from the great patriotic war ( a.k.a. 
  wwii , eastern front ) . 
  literally it 's `` for the motherland ! '', 
  ( althouth i dislike this last one , '' \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f '' sounds official for me , this word feels better in law or science books , not battlecries ) . 
  that part about life is skipped because it is kind of assumed . 
  oh damn not that again . 
  it was not purposeful , and it was not limited to ukraine . 
  read up some good historical book on the topic like `` years of hunger '' by davies and wheatcroft and stop spreading bullshit . 
  yes , but it was not `` purposefully starving a country to death '' , that is , there where no intent to kill all those people . 
  another fun fact is that in some languages the ` sh ' sound is one letter . 
  so much this . 
  very fun and satisfying hero to play , and not that difficult ( albeit rather squishy ) . 
  switching places with the hero trying to escape , or even better luring farmed hero into a trap ... priceless . 
  it was debunked on the same day iirc . 
  well , as for my city , most restaurants banned smoking for several years already . 
  i kind of like it , actually , i do n't mind going out for a smoke . 
   they want to re-establish the soviet empire , especially in places where people speak russian . 
  so when some ukrainians take power and align with the west , it 's completely legit ` protest ' or ` revolution ' , but when some other ukrainians do n't agree with that and align with russia , it is certainly russian-planned and russian-led operation . 
  because no sane ukrainians would align with russia , especially those who speak russian and were born in times when russia and ukraine were single state . 
   if the russians are n't in eastern ukraine , my question is , `` who is killing all these ukrainian soldiers ? '', 
  another ukrainians ? 
   `` we will not subsidize russian gazprom , '' ukrainian prime minister arseniy yatsenyuk said monday . 
  `` ukrainians will not take out of their pockets $ 5 billion annually for russia to use this money to buy weapons , tanks and ** jets and bomb ukrainian territories . 
  that 's him too . 
  pure gold . 
  edit : gold indeed . 
  wow . 
  thank you kind stranger !, 
  you forgot to mention that litvinenko worked for mi6 . 
   he was n't a double agent , as you are inferring through ommission . 
  and you 're certain about it because ... ? 
   they did n't exactly steal gas for the first 15 years . 
  to be accurate , they did had a history of gas stealing in nineties . 
  it was later resolved with gasprom , though . 
  any former intelligence agent working with another country 's intelligence service is , by default , a double agent until that proven wrong . 
  google do wonders with advanced search tools . 
  for example ( article published in 2000 ) : http://korrespondent.net/ukraine/politics/7362-kuchma-zapretil-vorovat-rossijskij-gaz, 
   you arrested him twice on fake charges, 
  i ca n't arrest anybody : i 'm a teacher , not a police officer . 
   he had n't been working for fsb for several years by the point he began working as a consultant . 
  there is a well known saying about kgb agents : there are no ` former ' kgb agents . 
  debate ? 
  in the / r/worldnews ? 
  that would be a waste of effort . 
   litvinenko fled to the uk and later became a consultant for their intelligence services , but he was actually a kgb agent all along and still working for the kremlin , assumedly feeding the uk false information while posing as a double agent and stealing all the info he could for his true bosses . 
  or , being a former kgb agent but knowing things that would know only a kgb agent ( that 's why there are no former kgb agents , or any intelligence agents for that matter ) he starts working with mi6 , and who knows what info he gave them . 
  or any other scenario . 
  anyways , working with the intelligence service of other country being a former kgb agent is a really bad idea . 
  yes , small city in tambov oblast . 
  none . 
  why should i ? 
   no takesies backsies ** russia **, 
  well , duh !, 
   we earn a lot on those deaths . 
  this is how i misread it . 
  `` there would be , by morning , guts strung along the fence and men with their throats slashed ragged and girl children carried off . 
  not here , not where it was being told , but always somewhere else . 
  and the people would believe . 
  they 'd believe everything they heard . '', 
  simak was a wise , wise man . 
  well , you just dress up according to weather . 
  it 's that simple . 
  if you ca n't withstand -25 for like an hour , you 're doing it wrong . 
  though if you smoke often , going outside for it can be a nuisance . 
  it 's more like ` write once run badly everywhere ' . 
  at least for desktop applications . 
  they look and feel very out of place without additional effort ( and even with it ) . 
  as for web programming , well , java applets are just out of place . 
  they run in browser but do n't integrate at all in web pages that contain them .
