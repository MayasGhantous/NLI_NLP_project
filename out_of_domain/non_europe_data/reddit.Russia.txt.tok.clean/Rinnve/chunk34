  well , applets are not quite dead , they are still used here and there . 
  server-side java and other jvm-based languages are of course very much alive and well and are n't going anywhere in like 50 years ; but i was not talking about them , obviously . 
  well , and here i get downvotes for not suggesting this . 
  it 's that language shootout thing . 
  does n't have anything with real life apps , of course , but it still shows that java is n't that slow-ass interpreter anymore . 
  also , my friend that works in science ( got a phd about something with fullerenes ) says that they now had switched from fortran to java for their computations ( dunno how supercomputer-ish , but i 'm pretty sure that they use some kind of a computer cluster ) . 
  ofc that 's just hearsay , but still . 
   java is n't interpreted . 
  it was . 
  it did leave a stain . 
   but , in the real world java blows c++ out of the water . 
  it 's all about proper applications . 
  c++ is much better for low-level things that still need some level of abstraction . 
  high-level c++ is also going better with new standards . 
  java is , of course , almost unmatched in the areas where pure performance is n't of top priority , compared to building enormous structures and hierarchies of data and procedures ( = where the big money go ) . 
   yeah , pravda , russia 's state news service, 
  pravda is n't russia 's state news service . 
  itar-tass is . 
   how much of russia has a decent internet connection ? 
  edit : about 25 % , so i 'd imagine that their news sources would be limited . 
  that 's old data . 
  there are government programs in action to improve connectivity with the emphasis on provincial cities and towns . 
  just to compare : in 2007 , in my city ( small city in mostly agricultural region , one of the less industrially advanced regions of russia ) the best internet option was 128 kbit/s adsl for a hefty price ( 30 $ / month iirc ) , and it was available only in some parts of the city . 
  only other options were 2 $ / hour dial-up and gprs so expensive i ca n't even recall the price for nobody used it . 
  in 2012 , about 50 % of the city had access to at least 20 mbit/s fiber for $ 10/month ; and now , in 2014 , it 's about 75 % of the city . 
  oh , i think remember this one . 
  could n't provide links out of my head right now , but basically it was a bit different : the same guy in a hospital was interviewed three times by different tv channels and he gave different answers ( basically what you 've cited ) . 
  anti-russian circlejerk caught that immediately and turned that in a way that this was a paid actor and those tv channels failed to come up with consistent propaganda . 
  the possibility of that guy being simply not right in the head after all that shock was , of course , completely ignored . 
  pretty straight-forward but strong support/pusher . 
  just do n't forget that his golem ( s ) can be controlled even after his death . 
  you can farm , push or even go for a kill even when resting without corporeal form . 
  manta is harder to farm in difficult games and is n't that awesome in easier ones . 
  maim is also very good complement for tb skill set . 
  may be that 's my newb mmr , but i 've had some fun with terrorblade . 
  his e is like having ult from level one , that damage buff just melts people down , throw in some disable from a support and it 's a easy kill . 
  and since he 's proper carry , he 's just getting stronger and stronger . 
   boycott by the opposition ** ( who had been previously deported/killed by the armed soldiers ) **, 
  what ? 
  sources , please . 
  i do n't quite get how 's that relevant to the current situation . 
  first , they where not ` surrounded by russian soldiers ' . 
  second , and more important , russians somehow managed to forget how crimean tatars welcomed nazis and how tens of thousands of criman tatars fought on nazi side , brutally killing russian soldiers . 
  russians also managed to forget hundred of thousands enslaved by crimean tatars back then when crimea was n't russian . 
  tatars were n't angels , you know , quite the opposite . 
   heavy government crackdowns on opposition parties and leaders, 
  please provide sources for that . 
  i ca n't recall any ` crackdowns ' on , say , yabloko or communists . 
  the forest is mine . 
  not really a response , but it 's hilarious . 
  red is just out of place honestly . 
   the polling stations had armed soldiers , either russian or on their behalf . 
  i failed to find any armed soldiers at the polling stations . 
   you can not have a fair election when the largest minority in an area is surrounded by armed representatives of the government that killed and deported them en masse . 
  there were no soviet soldiers in crimea this year . 
  only russian ones . 
  oh , and stalin is long dead , as is ussr . 
   youth yabloko had a dozen arrests as well back in 2013 during an anti-united russia party as well . 
  could you provide more info on that ? 
   navalny is widely seen as the only potential challenger to president vladimir putin after he garnered an unexpected 27 per cent in last year 's moscow mayoral election . 
  oh please . 
   the police cracked down heavily on people protesting in solidarity outside a courthouse there , as well as in moscow . 
  what kind of force did they use , and how many people were sentenced after that ? 
   p.s. 
  i am russian speaking native ukrainain . 
   but the amount of bullshit i tell about russia is really annoying, 
  ftfy, 
   why not just have higher ratings , such as eighteen or the like , for content with swearing ? 
  ** `` books with swear words will have to be sold in sealed packages with obscenity warnings '' **, 
  here you are . 
  and , according to [ the law ] ( http://pravo.gov.ru:8080/page.aspx?101052 ) , it 's not only books , but also videos and music recordings too . 
  films with swearing are banned from cinemas , though . 
   i think , for some people , swearing has become too casual and people use words without thinking . 
  precisely . 
  and if it 's both . . ? 
  i do n't doubt your words , kiev propaganda is bat-shit crazy those days , but providing fellow redditors with some relevant links would be very nice . 
  ... and now russian gays must prove that they are not all anti-russian . 
  stupid move if you care about gay rights . 
  pretty good move if you care about profit , though . 
  hating putin is a trend now , it 's not surprising to see people jump this bandwagon . 
  i think you 're seriously confused here . 
  thieves in law means thieves ' ` law ' , not actual law ; and there are many prisons in russia where it 's not tolerated at all . 
  oh , and it 's not a ` gang ' , it 's criminal tradition and code of conduct . 
  actually it 's not unlike some kind of criminal state-within-state , with several warring factions and all that . 
  yes . 
  and it 'll be on your team . 
  every fucking time . 
  actually that 's a gross exaggeration aimed to those who do n't know anything about russian . 
  thing is , word morphing and glueing is very common in russian , so basically you glue up any word with ` dick ' and here you are : new swearing . 
   they have a ** state policy ** of portraying homosexuals as `` lesser '' than heterosexuals , and ** some laws which discriminate against them ** ( not to mention the violent attacks ), 
  links , please . 
   except it 's not . 
  except it is . 
   there are gay organizations and bars in every country . 
  it would be nice to hear about gay organizations and bars in , for example , saudi arabia . 
  not ` mistake ' . 
  ` catastrophe ' . 
  and yes , it was . 
   whats wrong is that the law is vague and personal data can mean any site that requires registration . 
  i could n't find any links to the text of the law .
