  did you read it , or simply trust the article ? 
  roskomnadzor already [ stated ] ( http://www.rg.ru/2013/11/07/personaldata-site.html ) that logins/passwords will not be considered as personal data . 
   that requires personal information to logon, 
  roskomnadzor previously stated that logins and passwords are not considered ` personal information ' . 
  ukrainian army bases . 
  yes . 
   the molotovs and rocks came after the govermente made protests illegal, 
  correct . 
   and the police started shooting people on the streets . 
  incorrect . 
  except they did . 
   how much information can a website collect to create an account before it is considered `` personal information '' and subject to this stupid law ? 
  it is not yet clear , because this ` stupid law ' is still a work in progress and , actually , is not passed ( not finally ) . 
  in current version , ` personal information ' is defined as any information that can be immediately linked to actual person ( can be used to identify actual person ) . 
  first . 
  are you aware that ` kulak ' is russian word for * russian * wealthy farmer ? 
  second . 
  ` tens of millions ' is gross exaggeration . 
  third . 
  many ethnicities suffered under stalin rule . 
  russians suffered as well . 
  for example , [ this table ] ( http://magadanjew.berlev.info/history/gulag/stat_jews.htm ) shows that more than 50 % of executed in magadan prison camps were russian . 
   the 1932/3 famine , hitting places with non-russian the hardest, 
  actually nearby russian regions were hit just almost as hard . 
  twisting that famine as something aimed at ukrainians is disrespect to millions of russians and kazakhs who suffered it too . 
  also , it is interesting that nobody ever mentions previous famine of povolzhye that took place just ten years before holodomor and was just as bad - but only russians died then . 
   find me a deportations centred on ethnically russian regions or deportation of people specifically of russian ethnicity, 
  you already mentioned that . 
  most deported ` kulaks ' were russian . 
   your third point is limited prison numbers , numbers of no relevance when we compare to say priboi . 
  according to wikipedia , about 90 000 people suffered to that operation . 
  victims of gulag are counted in millions . 
  about half of that are russians . 
  so much for ` no relevance ' . 
   of course , this all ties in in the eternal russian policy of russification . 
  tell me please , how comes then that there are about 180 ethnicities in russian federation , with their own language and culture ? 
   again , kulaks are not of russian ethnicity and was not centered around an area with mostly people of russian ethnicity ( or culture ) . 
  kulak is , basically , a wealthy farmer . 
  it says nothing about ethnicity . 
  however , considering that ( 1 ) anti-kulak policies were the same in all the ussr and ( 2 ) there were more russians than anybody else in the ussr ... well . 
  for example , [ here is ] ( http://lomonosov-msu.ru/archive/lomonosov_2007/12/his/rakov.pdf ) statistical analysis of anti-kulak policy in south ural . 
  85 % of ` kulaks ' were russian , 12 % ukrainian and 2 % tatar . 
   in fact i 'd bet ethnic russians were not a plurality at the time . 
  you do n't ` bet ' when discussing history . 
  according to my data , povolzhye was about 3/4 russian at that time . 
   holodomor in contrast was a consequence of a policy decision by the nomenklatura . 
  holodomor , as well as povolzhye famine , was a consequence of both human and natural factors . 
  by the way , war was not the only human factor that caused the povolzhye famine . 
  peasants and farmers who fought collectivization and collectivization policy by itself were important factors as well , not unlike holodomor . 
   if quoting wikipedia is allowable , can we also conclude this section on gulag :, 
  very well . 
  [ this is ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ru/2/22/%d0%9d%d0%b0%d1%86%d0%b8%d0%be%d0%bd%d0%b0%d0%bb%d1%8c%d0%bd%d1%8b%d0%b9%d0%a1%d0%be%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b0%d0%b2%d0%93%d0%a3%d0%9b%d0%90%d0%931939.png ) the chart ( taken for russian article on gulag ) that shows ethnicities of gulag prisoners on 01.01.1939 . 
   oh man , sounds like ethnic-specific deportations to me !, 
  so what ? 
  there were ethnic-specific deportations . 
  nobody argues with that . 
   ethnicity is still an important subject today -- the kremlin claims to speak for people of russian ethnicity . 
  and now outright lie . 
  the kremlin claims to speak for people * who speak russian * ( '' \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u044f\u0437\u044b\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 '' ) . 
  in other words , for people who are culturally aligned with russia . 
   we can see in crimea the russification is in full process to , with how the crimean tatars are treated . 
  ** they are being forced out now **, 
  what ? 
  links , please . 
  and , please , do answer my question . 
  how comes that , contrary to alleged ` eternal russification policy ' , there are about 180 ethnicities in russian federation , with their own languages and cultures ? 
  how comes that [ there are 40 official languages ] ( http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%93%d0%be%d1%81%d1%83%d0%b4%d0%b0%d1%80%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b2%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%bd%d1%8b%d0%b5_%d0%b8_%d0%be%d1%84%d0%b8%d1%86%d0%b8%d0%b0%d0%bb%d1%8c%d0%bd%d1%8b%d0%b5_%d1%8f%d0%b7%d1%8b%d0%ba%d0%b8_%d0%b2_%d1%81%d1%83%d0%b1%d1%8a%d0%b5%d0%ba%d1%82%d0%b0%d1%85_%d0%a0%d0%be%d1%81%d1%81%d0%b8%d0%b9%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%b9_%d0%a4%d0%b5%d0%b4%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%b0%d1%86%d0%b8%d0%b8 ) in russian federation , besides russian ? 
  * edit : link *, 
   does nobody quality-check their shit anymore ? 
  it 's about russia , why bother ? 
  you obviously are not aware how much the life of the average russian had changed during putin 's rule . 
  the bullshit is strong in you . 
   it is worse than most places in russia, 
  ` most places ' being half a dozen european countries ? 
   however , trolleys by definition are outdated . 
  yes , if the city is planned for car traffic ( which is the case in many us cities as i get it ) . 
  no , if the city is planned for people ( like many european cities ) . 
  i 'm not sure about ` the best ' , but [ fiction book reader ] ( http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/fiction-book-reader/c5306975-0b96-439a-8826-b2518cef81f7 ) does the trick for me . 
  i 've tried some others ( including tucan reader ) , for actual book reading they 're inferior imho . 
  there is win rt version of it , but i have n't used it , so ca n't say anything ( i use fbreader for desktop windows ) . 
  if your phone is locked to your carrier , you ca n't use the sim card that belongs to another carrier . 
  locked phones are , of course , significantly cheaper than unlocked ones . 
  dat kda ratio though . 
  invokergame really helps in that department . 
   we do n't have `` professional troops '' in russia . 
  why do you lie ? 
   the military ** here **, 
  why the fuck are you still in russia if you hate it so much ? 
  except it 's not . 
  well , unless you 're targeting a first world country , but hey , even ukraine must be much better than russia . 
  low level people play much worse than bots , you wo n't learn anything from those matches . 
   rolling your hero , using your abilities , buying items , using courier , getting to know the map , killing heroes , avoiding getting killed . . ? 
  yes , low level players generally lack many traits from this list . 
  it is also quite important that you do n't get yelled at while getting accustomed with the interface , the map , abilities of different heroes etc. 
   you mean bots have much deeper strategic insight, 
  i 'm talking about those levels where simply controlling your hero , farming and buying right items can be serious challenge . 
  strategy is out of question there . 
  there are different kinds of supports , you know . 
  some can be actually pretty fun to play ( lion or warlock , for example ) . 
  the trick is not to play support with newbies the same way support is played by pros ( no farm , ward bitching etc.
