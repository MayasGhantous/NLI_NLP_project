  to be precise , expenses in the us are also a bit higher . 
  well , i can give you some data . 
  it 's not exactly an average , just one sample , but on the other hand i live in a relatively small city ( about 100k ) in mostly agricultural region ( salaries tend to be smaller than in industrial regions ) . 
  all prices are in rubles . 
  housing : decent 1 [ living ] room apartment in a decent neighborhood is about 7000 rubles ; this is only rent itself , so with all necessities like electricity , water and heating it is about 8500 . 
  that 's probably the main reason people live with parents : it is wiser to save up and buy your own apartment or house ( it takes about 5-7 years with average salary , if you do n't have kids ) . 
  1 room apartment can be bought for about 1 mil . 
  rubles ( used ) or 1.5 mil ( new ) . 
  houses are cheaper , but need more maintenance ( climate is quite harsh , it varies from -30 c in winter to +30 c in summer , so it puts serious stress on constructions ) . 
  salary : average local salary is about 15k , but that 's including low level ` do nothing ' positions ( some people willingly choose that , do n't know why ) . 
  expected salary for people who actually work is about 20k , may be a bit more . 
  please note that this is not statistical average , it 's perceived ` average ' ( in other words , amount which starts to be considered ` decent ' ) . 
  experienced specialists can ask for 30k and more ( that 's when it gets too specific for averages ) . 
  food : you can get by with about 5k/month for one person ( no trash food , but no extra niceties either , just your usual meat/fruits/vegetables / etc. ) . 
  what 's nice about small cities , you do n't need a car here ( at least if you do n't have kids ) , so ca n't help with that . 
   russia is doing to these satellite vassal states by feeding their leader olygarhy with power and money, 
  could you please provide some examples of said ` feeding ' ? 
  it is not clear that grad launchers are inside russia . 
  this location is very close to border , which is basically non-existent so rebels can accidentally cross it . 
  or even intentionally , to provoke counter-strike that hits russian territory . 
  looks like [ volcanic pipe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volcanic_pipe ) . 
  looks like [ volcanic pipe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volcanic_pipe ) . 
  nothing really important . 
  basically , `` we now have those buks and sky over donetsk will be clear '' and `` separatists have captured buks , electronic parts are broken but they think they are able to find specialists to fix it '' . 
  a wild guess : electronic parts were rigged to home on high-flying civilian aircrafts . 
  or , of course , it most probably is that those how fired it were not competent enough . 
  this is actually very disturbing thought . 
  there were two world wars already , was n't that enough ? 
  and , of course , you have some proof to this statement , which we can see any moment now . 
  am i right ? 
  all that is ` well-known publicly available information ' is that girgin is a * former * ~ ~ * low-rank * ~ ~ gru officer . 
  also ,, 
   most of the `` rebels '', 
  edit : no , colonel is n't exactly ` low-rank ' . 
  what i do n't quite get is why everybody calls those rebels ` pro-russians ' while they are , actually , ` anti-kiev ' . 
  `` this would n't be the first time the ukrainians have shot down a civilian airliner . '', 
  just using your logic . 
  or , ` logic ' . 
   my understanding is that the ukrainian accent in russian is markedly different from the accent of those who were born , bred , and groomed in russia proper . 
  your understanding is wrong . 
  ` ukrainian ' accent is actually more like southern countryside accent . 
  many russians ( especially in the regions close to ukraine ) speak with it ; on the other hand , many educated ukrainians ( at least those who i can see on ukrainian tv ) speak clear ` proper ' russian . 
   most of the `` rebels '', 
  so apparently ukrainians are tools enough to blindly follow russian overlord ? 
  source ? 
  it seems that you 're confusing gru with fsb . 
  more important , if you call [ this ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/11/world/europe/russian-seizes-authority-over-ukraine-rebels.html?_r=1 ) a source ... well . 
  it 's then not ` he was something something ' , it 's ` he * says * he was something something ' . 
  also , please less focus on one man , more focus on, 
   most of the `` rebels '', 
  should we also recall , say , usa shooting down iran airliner ? 
  oh wait , nobody cares about those filthy iranians . 
  the man responsible even got a medal for it . 
   fascist rebels, 
  words should be used for their intended purpose , not as scary labels . 
   so russia will be allowed to shoot down civilian airliners at will ? 
  usa is apparently allowed . 
  ukraine is too . 
  why not russia ? 
   the worst part of this whole situation is that no one will be held responsible . 
  yep . 
  there is quite a history of military shooting down civilian aircrafts , both accidentally and intentionally . 
  as far as i know , no one was held responsible . 
  not once . 
  and at least one man was rewarded with a medal for it . 
   i do n't understand why anyone would even downvote this question . 
  because there is no place for serious discussion on / r/worldnews . 
  it 's all huge circlejerk for what 's in trend today , nothing more . 
   why does putin imply that it 's ok to fire on any plane that is in international airspace ? 
  in fact , he does n't . 
  he just knows that shit happens . 
  accidents happen . 
  sometimes terrible accidents . 
  not restricting civilian airliners from entering to a zone of conflict where are anti-aircraft systems in action was invitation for a tragedy . 
   no aircraft had been used to try and subdue the separatists , at any point . 
  wait , are you saying that those air strikes performed by ukrainian military were not even aimed at separatists ? 
  except they are not . 
  ( also please notice that i provided as much source for my words as you did . 
  if you know what i mean . ), 
  why ? 
  ah , please forgive me , i totally forgot . 
  * because russia . 
   russians hate muslims more than anything, 
  this is actually wrong . 
  there are millions of tatar muslims living peacefully in russia for centuries . 
  * radical jihadist muslims * , on the other hand ... 
   hating on/attempting to provide a decent viewpoint based on/because of a country that intentionally starts shit with its neighbours , runs black flag operations to discredit their enemies , seizes territory of said enemies for blatantly obvious militaristic reasons , constantly cracks down and controls their population while letting officials and the rich do literally whatever they want in public , hires a large group of people for the purposes of distributing misinformation and pretends they are not responsible for killing hundreds of civilians ? 
  wait , i 'm a little confused here . 
  were you talking about russia or usa ? 
   ukrainian air forces have been used amazingly sparingly , and to little effect . 
  yep . 
  who cares about a dozen dead civilians , after all ? 
   the air strikes have been the separatists taking down cargo planes, 
  * military * cargo planes . 
  just like you , mate , just like you . 
  afaik those elections were confirmed as legitimate by eu observers . 
  am i wrong ? 
  source ? 
  there is one thing that almost everybody is not considering . 
  buk is called an anti-aircraft * complex * for a reason : it 's actually several vehicles that work together .
