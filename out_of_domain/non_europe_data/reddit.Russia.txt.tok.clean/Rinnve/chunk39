  ministry of defense do n't claim that course of events , as far as i know . 
  they just point at facts that there were ukrainian buks operating in that area and that there was some military aircraft , probably su-25 , near mh17 . 
  may be it was that su-25 that rebels claim they have , and ukrainians tried to shoot it but missed . 
  hopefully the investigations will dig up the truth . 
  pilots of siberia airlines 1812 ( that was shot by ukrainian c-200 missile , which is much more powerful that buk missiles ) were able to talk with ground control for 45 seconds after the impact . 
  so there 's that . 
  russia 's ministry of defence published satellite images that depict both buk launchers and buk target acquisition radars in the area . 
  also , buk launchers can be seen on the photos of ukrainian forces after they took slavyansk ( ca n't find those photos right now though ) . 
  edit : [ found it ] ( http://www.cbc.ca/m/touch/news/story/1.2697356 ) . 
  you should initialize array before using it . 
  like this :, 
  blanks = new string [ wordbank [ randomword ] . length ] ;, 
  for ( int i = 0 ; i < wordbank [ randomword ] . length ; i + + ), 
  blanks [ i ] = '' _ '' ;, 
  what about * your * law on illegal protests , eh ? 
  ah , western media at its finest , omitting all ` unimportant ' bits . 
  how cares that this is not actually a ` law against protests ' ? 
  that little stunt by nyt about ` gays to jails ' was swallowed without questions , this one will be too . 
  try to actually read the article . 
   putin will be death, 
  this is actually a pretty scary thought . 
  russian federation exists for less than thirty years , what are you talking about ? 
   funny given that quite a few of them a from central asia , and many from russia ( with a good number of ex and current fsb and gru forces ) . 
  you seem to be well informed . 
  care to provide some numbers ? 
   there 's a big distinction between that and `` you ca n't protest - fuck you '' . 
  yes . 
  there is also big distinction between honest reporting and dishonest propaganda which apparently what have wp became . 
  because the law you 've cited is actually very similar to the law passed in russia . 
  that is , it is not a ` law against protests ' . 
  it is a law against unlawful assembly . 
  lawful assembly and lawful protest is still completely legal in russia . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  dude , try and actually read it . 
  it 's not about adding 1 % to 13 % , it 's about taxing the richest 1 % of russians . 
  i prefer honest reporting on what is actually happening , thank you very much . 
  now it seems that there is no such thing left in the world . 
  one word . 
  ` unlawful ' . 
  there is a law in russia that defines the rules of public assembly and protest ( no violence , you must declare the place of the protest , etc. , not unlike your average western law that regulates protests ) . 
  article is talking about the new law that harshens ( is that the word ) punishment for unlawful protests , especially when it is done repeatedly . 
  article somehow failed to mention that it is still completely legal to protest if you follow the law . 
  edit : i 've missed that the new law is only about repeated unlawful protest ( more that two times in 6 months ) . 
  that 's another question . 
  i 've just pointed at your error . 
   cia shot the plane down in an elaborate ruse to get russia in trouble ... which is what the bulk of what russian media has been reporting . 
  care to provide some proof to your words ? 
  please , do not repost wp 's lies . 
   accurate reporting from an american source on russia , is about as accurate as the reverse, 
  there is no ( yet ) accurate source in english , all i 've managed to find are repeating wp 's propaganda . 
  here is [ accurate report in russian ] ( http://itar-tass.com/politika/1334205 ) and here is [ google translation ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ru&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fitar-tass.com%2fpolitika%2f1334205&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) of it . 
  nonexistent law . 
  the real law is [ quite a bit different ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ru&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fitar-tass.com%2fpolitika%2f1334205&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) . 
  first , please point to where i did defend rt. 
  ( hint : i was n't not talking about rt or any other russian agency . ), 
  second , if you have troubles with understanding of the word ` honest ' , there are free dictionaries on the internets . 
  i think this is related to how accurate and unbiased western media report russian events . 
   the message you get every day is : look how strong putin is !, 
  look how big russia is !, 
  only strong putin can keep big russia together !, 
  many enemies of russia around the world !, 
  strong putin - enemies stay away !, 
  etc , etc. 
  care to provide an example or two ? 
   most of the news episodes are usually filled with putin 's having a press conference , stating that russia will not bend under [ insert your favorite : western evil , corruption , heretics , etc. ] . 
  another common one is putin at a factory , being shown how prosperous it become since his last visit . 
  putin at international summit , putin underwater , putin in space . 
  ` most ' . 
  what 's better than a small exaggeration ? 
  putin is on the news quite frequently , he is the president of the rf after all . 
  but to say that news are filled with putin is just plain wrong . 
   i dont the black boxes will be of much use , it may be a case that the data just flatlines when the missile hit . 
  missiles do n't disintegrate aircrafts , you know . 
  pilots of siberia airlines 1812 were able to talk ( actually scream , i guess ) to ground control for 45 seconds after c-200 missile hit ( and this missile is about 3 times more powerful than buk ) . 
  so there could be some interesting data . 
  btw , is n't it suspicious that ground control recordings are being kept secret ? 
  records were available for general public the next day that polish presidential plane hit the ground , for example . 
  those strange % symbols % are hex codes for russian letters . 
  we are pretty used to them , i did n't even though about it , 
  yes , in the address bar . 
  i guess browser converts letters to hex codes for better compatibility . 
  on my 720 here maps ca n't handle big cities ( i mean really big , like moscow ) . 
  ie also crashes on some really big pages . 
  i 'm not 100 % sure of course , but it seems that it is because of low ram amount . 
   what makes that 1 pilot so much more newsworthy than the other thousands dying each month ? 
  supply and demand ? 
  i mean , supply and demand of hot news . 
  may be newspapers sell better this way . 
  look up definition of the word ` terrorist ' . 
  this is the evidence ? 
  unreadable satellite photo that shows nothing ( compared to russian satellite photos with very distinct shadows from buk target acquisition radars ) and three photos that were on teh interwebs for weeks and , frankly speaking , prove jack shit ? 
  where is satellite image of the actual launch that they told they have ? 
  because ukrainian government needs every moneyz they can get . 
  they get money for every airliner traveling through their airspace ( ground control and all that ) . 
   shooting down a civilian plane with 300 people is not good enough definition ? 
  no , unless it is proven that it was ( a ) intentional and ( b ) done by rebels . 
   well then add torture , kidnappings , indiscriminate killings , holding population hostage, 
  holding population hostage ? 
  you mean , like that time rebels helped to evacuate donetsk ?
