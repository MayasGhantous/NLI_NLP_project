  persistence , hands down . 
  with that , you can have everything you want . 
  eventually . 
  ah , and a good sense of direction , so you do n't bash head-to-wall with all this persistence . 
  yeah ... that 's a bit more tricky , 
  in those cases , \u0439 works more like a normal consonant letter/sound . 
  if you 're native english , the best example i 'd recall is military `` aye aye , sir '' . 
  `` aye '' sounds very , very close to russian '' \u0430\u0439 '' . 
  try to analyze it and dissect it to '' \u0430 - '' and '' - \u0439 '' . 
  reading and writing skills can be fixed only by reading a lot and writing a lot . 
  expose yourself to the language and let your brain do the thing it does best : adapt .

  any facts , please ? 
   crushed russia 's democracy . 
  also ruling the nation via mafia ( kgb ) as he always has, 
  any facts , please ? 
   since his comeback , has institutionalized an unprecedented fear tactic against his own population, 
  any facts , please ? 
  especially for this one : `` against his own population '' . 
  as far as i know , putin is ... 
  i would n't say `` admired '' , but very well `` welcome '' amongst general russian population . 
   his brutal measures against homosexuals is pretty dangerous . 
  any examples of those `` brutal measures '' against gays , please ? 
   murdered alexander litwnienko, 
  any facts , please ? 
  you know , even * if * it was done by fsb , fsb is not putin 's left hand . 
  or right hand , for that matter . 
  it is so full of bullshit i 've even wrote a comment ( i may be new to reddit but i 'm far from being new to net-based discussions , starting from fidonet and usenet ... and i 've learned to stay back from politics . 
  but this is too much even for me . ), 
  at least one thing must be here on the right ----- , 
  ** `` russia is big . 
  questions like `` does anyone have any experience doing anything in russia '' have no practical meaning . 
  even kazan itself ( `` smaller city '' my ass ) is big enough to have different 3g/4g signal levels in different parts of the city . 
  big cellular operators like megafon and mts have coverage maps ( http://lc.megafon.ru/help/coverage/ ) , check them out . 
  also , check out for arranging internet access in your apartments ; it is generally possible if it is not an hotel/hostel . 
  3g access is generally quite good , but fiber/wifi is always better . 
  now that 's more like it . 
  free wifi is not ubiquitous in `` larger cities '' , and it is certainly not ubiquitous in `` smaller cities '' . 
  most fastfood/cafes have one , but it can be overloaded/out of order/paranoid filtered , so i 'd not count on that . 
  ( free wifi is free for all , so passing by teenagers theoretically can see some xxx action or drug selling sites , which is a no-no . ), 
  but . 
  there will be neighbours , and some of those most certainly will have a slightly underused fiber/wifi . 
  i 'd not count on that too , but i 'd ask about ; it generally can be negotiated ( may be for a price ) if you 're being nice . 
  do your research though ; $ 100 for 1 mbit/s is waaaay overpriced even on north pole . 
  as for cellular , there is no real prepaid as far as i know , only contracts and more contracts ( not really expensive , but passport is absolutely required ) . 
  finding a store with usb dongles is n't a problem even in smaller `` smaller '' cities , and of course is not a problem in kazan . 
  buying one is whole another story . 
  generally you ca n't get a cellular service contract without a passport . 
  i 'd ask local contacts for buying you a dongle with a contract ; it 's not a big deal unless you forget to cancel it when it is not needed anymore . 
  or you can go full official . 
  as far as i know , megafon deals with foreign citizens , it just needs a shitload of legal papers . 
  do n't know about other operators ( but pretty sure if megafon does it , so does mts , those guys just wo n't miss it ) . 
   what 's with police and champagne bottles ? 
  do n't listen to that . 
  there was this case ... outrageous brutal torture carried out by ( former ) policemen . 
  it is in no way normal or ok or anything like that ; you 'd get in some trouble though if you mention that in some awkard way ( like , `` i heard you police boys here do like champagne bottles '' ) . 
   as well as give me something to talk about with any russian person, 
  that can be a problem . 
  russian culture is kind of diverse . 
  for example some people ( like me , yeah ) would very much like to talk about strugatsky sci-fi novels , some would detest those and some just do n't give a nothing . 
  same goes for most recent writers , and the same goes for `` real classics '' like dostoevsky and tolstoy which are must read in schools and for that reason are disliked by many . 
  ( and there was this thing called ussr that changed our culture in too many ways , so turgenev 's and dostoyevsky 's russia was a very , very different country in the same geographical borders . ), 
  do n't expect that after reading some book you 'll be able to discuss it ( or related material ) with * any * russian . 
  read something that you enjoy . 
  as for suggestions , it depends on what do you prefer ; but if you 're interested with modern russian culture , i 'd start with 20th century literature . 
  strugatsky brothers for real deep sci-fi ( though more social than pure scientific ) . 
  victor pelevin for really mind-bending postmodern fiction that is also deeply connected with recent russian history . 
  also , my personal suggestion would be valentin kataev 's '' \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441 \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043a\u0438\u0439 '' ( basically early 20th century events in teenager 's eyes ) . 
  and if you want `` real classics '' , avoid dostoevsky and tolstoy . 
  this shit is too deep and ... well ... too shit . 
  gogol , turgenev , paustovsky and chekhov are the way to go . 
  quality ... no , wrong word , ca n't be applied to this shit . 
  level of modern translations was one of main reasons for me to learn english . 
  you know , they do n't write such walls of text on books without any depth . 
  what 's the point then ? 
  i do n't think it 's wise to use bad translation for language practice . 
  and that 's counter example how ? 
  `` d\u00fchring 's ideas were . '', 
  that 's enough . 
  books without depth do n't have any ideas worth mentioning . 
  mature animation is something specific to japanese culture . 
  russian language can be complex if you 're trying to analyse it , to learn it analytically . 
  imho this is very wrong way to learn a language . 
  learning languages is something our brain hardwired to , you must only give it enough material to work upon . 
  i 'm sorry , but this is not exactly an opinion , it is more of an observation . 
  i know many people who picked up foreign language just because they needed to use it - and they just did it . 
  rp games , tv shows , rare fiction books , whatever . 
  book in one hand , dictionary in other .
