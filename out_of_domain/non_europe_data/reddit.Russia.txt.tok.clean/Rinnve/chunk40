  it is , of course not a law against protests , but a law against illegal protests . 
  and yes , many other countries have similar laws . 
  [ this is actually false ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ru&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fitar-tass.com%2fpolitika%2f1334205&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) . 
  by the way , you do n't need a permit for a legal protest in russia , but you must declare it beforehand ( iirc in two days ) . 
  it is legal if you declare it beforehand , as it is written in the law . 
  ( and it is declaration , not asking for a permit . ), 
  there is nothing funny about it . 
  plenty of completely peaceful civilians where shot down by ukrainian jets . 
  su25 actually has a pretty big ceiling for it 's purpose as an ground attack craft ( i 've read pilots saying that the problem is with leacking cockpit and the effects of low air pressure on human body ) . 
  but as a ground attack craft , it has to fly pretty low , and you have only so much time to climb before missile hits you 'cause missiles fly much faster . 
   cia shot the plane down in an elaborate ruse to get russia in trouble ... which is what the bulk of what russian media has been reporting . 
  do you even read ? 
  i 've asked some proof to that ` the bulk of russian media reporting ' is that ` cia shot the plane down ' . 
  they are lies in the form wp presented they . 
  at least that ` anti-protest law ' . 
  this is what wp wrote :, 
  `` found guilty of `` holding meetings , rallies , demonstrations , marches and pickets '''', 
  this is what the law says : `` minimum punishment for ** violating the laws on demonstrations ** more than twice during a six-month period will be a fine of between 600,000 rubles and 1 million rubles ( $ 17,000 and $ 28,400 ) . 
  `` 000 rubles and 1 million rubles ( $ 17,000 and $ 28,400 ) '', 
  of course , but flares do n't have 100 % efficiency , far from it . 
  yep , it 's bloated . 
  it is also one of the very few map applications that have accurate and detailed maps of russian cities with correct street names , house numbers etc. 
  and with offline mode that actually works . 
  short answer : it depends . 
  long answer : personal names of actual persons are never translated . 
  personal names of fictional persons can be translated , but that 's depends on how clear is the original meaning . 
  for example , dragon deathwing from world of warcraft is translated as ' \u0421\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u043e\u043a\u0440\u044b\u043b ' ( ' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442 ' from ' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u044c ' - death , and ' \u043a\u0440\u044b\u043b ' from ' \u043a\u0440\u044b\u043b\u043e ' - wing ) . 
  baggins from lotr in some translations is \u0411\u044d\u0433\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0441 ( transliteration ) or \u0421\u0443\u043c\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441 ( translated imitation ) . 
  usernames or nicknames are usually transliterated or not changed at all ( for example , one can say that ' \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c thehockeyist \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0430\u043b \u0432\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441 \u043d\u0430 \u0444\u043e\u0440\u0443\u043c\u0435 / r/russian ' ) . 
  as for other words , many advanced terms are copied ` as is ' . 
  for example , hedge ( finance ) = '' \u0445\u0435\u0434\u0436\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 '' , futures ( contract ) = '' \u0444\u044c\u044e\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0441 '' . 
  there are no strict rules , however , for example closure ( programming ) is ~ ~ ' \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u0438\u0435 ' ~ ~ ' \u0437\u0430\u043c\u044b\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 ' ( translated ) . 
  it depends on how easy is to translate a term and on how easy original can be pronounced by russian . 
  great review of the situation . 
  nothing really new , but still very interesting . 
  thanks , that 's correct . 
   sometimes i have americans asking me if i am `` grateful '', 
  grateful for what ? 
  i do n't quite get it . 
  til that answering lost and found phone is immoral . 
  because bloodless annexation is the worst thing that could happen ? 
  those ` people who take parts of the plane ' have ukrainian emergency service uniforms on them . 
  in other words , that 's local investigation team ( which , by the way , answers to ukrainian government and not the rebels ) . 
   was shot down because it was mistaken for vladimir putin 's personal jet ( as if anti-aircraft missiles were n't aimed with radar but with a really large pair of binoculars ), 
  from now on the only proper response to adomanis articles should be ` lel ' . 
  this level of ` arguing ' is unacceptable . 
  ukrainian government seems to give all sorts of statements those days . 
  i do n't know what those workers were doing , but i do know [ who you should ask ] ( http://www.mns.gov.ua/ ) . 
  well , there is [ this ] ( http://interfax.com.ua/news/general/214387.html ) . 
  this part :, 
  basically , ukrainian emergency service noticed that ` dnr guys ' interfere with the work of government service for emergency situations ( it 's official name for their emergency service ) . 
  on the other hand , there is no relevant info on [ the official site of gses ] ( http://www.mns.gov.ua/ ) , it 's like it never happened at all . 
  ( i must notice however that i do n't know ukrainian , and it 's not close enough to russian for 100 % understanding . ), 
  crash site is fucking kilometers in radius . 
  things are all over that region . 
  what should you do if you live there and find a cell phone in your backyard ? 
  i know one thing that no one half-sane * looter * would do . 
  it 's answering a call . 
  `` oh look i found a phone after that plane crash , should turn it over to authorities ... oh look , somebody 's calling '', 
  something something benefit of the doubt ? 
  ah , how can i forget . 
  those are filthy ukrainians who a basically russians who are the evil personified . 
   why would you leave a place with an earning potential 10-20 times higher, 
  hmm . 
  i 'm a computer science teacher with some minor systems administration on the side . 
  i make $ 800/month in russia . 
  will i make $ 8k/month in canada ? 
   last time i checked he ordered the police and military to open fire onto protesters in kiev, 
  you checked wrong . 
  there are no documents confirming such an order . 
  it is not even clear who did the sniping that lead to that mess . 
  max hourly is about $ 20 . 
  with 8 hour/day 5 days/week 4 weeks/month it is about $ 3k , i.e. 
  less than half of what you 've stated . 
  am i missing something ? 
   not considering they work 8 months of the year . 
  wait . 
  here in russia it 's either work months or paid vacation months , so income is + / - constant all over the year . 
  are the rules different over there ? 
  well , that depends on a subject . 
  my fellow english teachers easily pull over $ 50/hr * here in russia * and have a long queue of kids willing to pay . 
  not so much . 
  high school level cs is n't exactly in high demand . 
  is the situation different there ? 
  you appear to be very well informed . 
  care to share your source ? 
   if you can program in c++ / c # and you are not making 100k a year , you are doing something very wrong . 
  i can make a ton of money here in russia doing some coding in c++ . 
  thing is , i hate coding ( well , large scale coding at least ) . 
  i love teaching kids how computers actually work , however . 
  lol no , high end private school teachers in moscow easily make like $ 3000/month . 
  ( tricky thing is getting there , though . 
  no , it does n't involve bribing , more like exceptionally high skills . ), 
   he wants to move away from russia to escape oppression and international isolation . 
  if you 're talking about me , there is virtually no oppression here and i could n't care less about international isolation unless it involves second iron curtain ( which is highly unlikely for many reasons ) . 
  however , i do somewhat care about moneyz . 
  technically , i could . 
  at least according to the law . 
  i do n't really know how it works in practice however , at least not first-hand experience . 
  people somehow managed to pull some [ serious protest ] ( http://pano.1drey.com/various/protest6.html ) on bolotnaya square , so it 's possible .
