   there are multiple possibilities for why 2 +2 = 4 , yet somehow most people who know math choose only one . 
  2 + 2 = 10 , actually . 
  sometimes things are more complex than it seems . 
  change what stance ? 
  putin called for de-escalation and negotiations more than month ago . 
   would you like soviet union to be reincarnated, 
  it is amusing how almost everybody associate russia with soviet union , while it was like 5 % of russia 's history . 
  for example : http://ria.ru/world/20140621/1013023669.html, 
  at this point i can only hope that putin knows what he 's doing . 
  this whole thing is a goddamn mess . 
  russian empire was quite recent too on historical scale . 
   i wonder what should we do in west part of russia in 4400 miles away from china ? 
  i do n't know , consume local-made products ? 
  your link redirects to http://abcnews.go.com/international for some reason . 
  it is good then that turkey and egypt are not sanctioned . 
  competition with eu , probably . 
  do n't know about other products , but polish imports are ( well , were ) pretty cheap . 
  it is a sign of uneducated ( or undereducated ) person . 
  like pronounsing ' \u0447\u0442\u043e ' as ' \u0447\u0451 ' ( correct is ' \u0448\u0442\u043e ' ) . 
  sadly , many russians have little respect for our own language . 
   well , russia openly admitted to sending aid back in june . 
  ```` we are trying to provide humanitarian aid to those who have not left the conflict zone yet , '' [ ... ] eastern ukrainians had requested `` humanitarian aid , primarily medicine . '''', 
  russia never admitted providing military aid . 
   it 's ridiculous to think that russia could n't at least close the borders against them . 
  how exactly do you imagine it ? 
  russian-ukrainian border is mostly unguarded and it is more than thousand kilometers long . 
   i know the populations are pretty intermingled, 
  it is not ` intermingled ' . 
  russians and eastern ukrainians are indistinguishable , and those who are older than 30 still remember living in the same state . 
  thank you . 
  added it on top of my reading list . 
  orcs changed history by refusing to drink demon blood ( that 's what originally made them green-skinned meat fodder of the burning legion and led to the events of warcraft games ) . 
   by removing ukrainian as the official language of crimea, 
  official languages of crimea are russian , ukrainian and tatar . 
  he tells about ten million * ukrainians * died during holodomor - wide-spread exaggeration ; serious historians think that it was about 6 million * total * , including about 2 million russians and 1 million kazakhs . 
  he tells how it was unbelievable that there was ` wide-spread starvation ' in a country that is famous for exporting grain - while wide-spread starvations were in fact not uncommon at all in russia . 
  povolzhye starved just 10 years before holodomor , and it was just as awful . 
  he then tells about how stalin deported ` entire indigenous population of crimea ' and sent russians to live there , while in fact crimea was more than 50 % russian long before stalin and ussr . 
  and he fails to tell that there was no country named ukraine before ussr . 
  there were malorossia and novorossia , regions of russian empire . 
  all of that in a first minute or two . 
  and then he transitions to recent history and current situation . 
  amount of bullshit there is absolutely unbelievable . 
  you can take any phrase there , any sentence , and it will be either biased , incomplete or just plain wrong . 
  agreement between yanukovich and opposition , which opposition breaks the next day ? 
  never happened . 
  any evidence that it was yanukovich who ordered infamous snipers to , ah , snipe people ( both opposition and police ) ? 
  who needs evidence and investigation !, 
  any context to eu agreement , how it would be disastrous for ukrainian economy ? 
  too complex . 
  0:33 of your video . 
  just the same ` falling fireworks ' . 
  10 million dead ukrainians is one event . 
  6 million dead citizens of different ethnicity is completely different event . 
  10 million dead ukrainians in a ` world 's greatest grain exporter ' is one event . 
  6 million dead citizens of different ethnicity in a country where great famines are not unheard of and where such a famine took place just 10 years ago is completely different event . 
  people take awful disaster , exaggerate one facts , throw away another , and instead of a complex historical event we see history painted black and white . 
  russians are , of course , on the black side of it . 
  does [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnw-t5ocbaw ) looks more like it ? 
  looks like random cyrillic letters . 
  not russian , not any other cyrillic language . 
  believe me , the actual content of the book is even stranger . 
  refugees who fled into russia are well-fed , believe me . 
  source : works in school that temporarily hosts 60 refugees . 
  according to [ rt ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2dr4k0/ukraine_recognizes_russian_humanitarian_convoy/ ) , ukraine already officially recognized convoy as humanitarian . 
  according to them , they do n't plan on returning . 
  as they say , there is nothing to return to . 
  they are now working on official refugee status and then expect to get russian citizenship . 
  regional authorities now are looking for more permanent place for them to live , there are already some volunteers who offer to host families . 
  i hope it will turn out good for them , they lived through tough time . 
  thank you . 
  i think that all food there is conserved , like army rations ( mre and such ) . 
  edit : considering army involvement , it could be actual army rations . 
   the trucks were n't even `` half empty '' btw they only contained a bunch of stuff , more than half empty . 
  and you know that from what source ? 
  on [ these pictures ] ( http://rt.com/news/180844-ukraine-recognizes-russia-humanitarian-aid/ ) trucks look pretty filled . 
  so we see full trucks on one photos and nearly empty on others , from which you deduce that all trucks in the convoy are nearly empty . 
  am i correct ? 
  you actually provided an example of fully loaded truck , are you aware of it ? 
  second link , third and fourth photos . 
   since this conversation has started , we 've had shaun walker from the guardian and roland oliphant from the telegraph documenting russian armor crossing ukrainian border . 
  oh really ? 
  were are those documents , then ? 
  photos , videos , something ? 
  if not of armor itself , maybe photos of that ` gap in barbed wire ' with , i do n't know , some tracks on the earth ? 
   strangest thing i 've heard . 
  please confirm . 
   it is n't a good argument for why a lone telar could not acquire and shoot down a random passing civilian airplane . 
  it 's not like there were thousands of planes over that region . 
  what is the probability of a plane flying in the sector scanned by telar ( 60 degrees horizontally , 7 degrees vertically ) ? 
  keep in mind that telar ca n't just sit there and scan the skies for hours . 
  first , it eats a lot of fuel in this mode ; second , due to massive radio signature it is easily detected and targeted . 
  it is possible though if someone told that in this sector in this time a military plane will fly . 
  google for ` unicode fonts in wow ' . 
  there also was guide somewhere on official forums ( in eu pvp section most probably ) . 
  i believe [ this is it ] ( http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7339955422?page=1 ) . 
  even basic su25 can fly this high , the problem is not with engine or other metal , but with insulation of the cockpit ( human factor ) . 
  from what i 've gathered , it is possible to fly 10km high for several minutes before effects of exposure to low pressure starts to kick in . 
  russian soviet federative socialist respublic was part of ussr . 
  well , i work in a boarding school in a small city in tambov oblast .
