  corrective labor does not involves incarceration in any form , but you 're not allowed to evade it . 
  shipilov was arrested because he chose to evade corrective labor . 
  here 's what mine looks like : http://imgur.com/iswue15, 
  it 's pretty bad because i rarely write those days , but also because i 've changed writing of some letters ( underlined on photo ) when i was about 16 . 
  because , well , 16 . 
  so edgy , much unique . 
  i sometimes try to change it back ( it really slows down writing ) , but apparently am too lazy to exercise it properly . 
   it 's on the chart genius, 
  where exactly it is on this chart ? 
  i ca n't find it , point to it , please . 
  i ca n't find this 44 % inflation rate anywhere on this page , actually . 
  how did you get this number ? 
  yeah , that 's pretty decent handwriting . 
  however , there are things to work upon . 
  not all letters are ` canon ' , but that is not a problem , i would n't say it makes them worse ( imho you should totally keep that flag on your [ \u0431 ] ) . 
  i think you should work on a more constant slant of the letters . 
  also , some letters are not distinct enough from their neighbors , like that [ \u043c ] in ' \u0432\u0430\u043c ' in the last line or [ \u043b ] in ' \u043f\u0435\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0442\u044c ' in the middle , or basically the entire ' \u0442\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043c ' in the 3rd line from the bottom ( it should look more like [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/puokoou ) ) . 
  your [ \u0432 ] can be fixed pretty easily : your mistake is that you just write it smaller than it should be ; its lower circle ( unlike the circle in [ \u044c ] ) should be the same size with [ \u043e ] or [ \u0430 ] and its upper part should stick out more . 
  that 's not that bad , actually . 
  at least i can understand it without any effort , it is not so for infamous [ ` medical cursive ' ] ( http://bygaga.com.ua/pictures/cool-pictures/7253-surovyy-pocherk-vrachey-3-foto.html ) . 
  just practice it , and it will improve ; may be get some ' \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0438 ' or just paper lined for handwriting ( like [ this ] ( http://static4.read.ru/images/booksillustrations/16311.jpg ) \\ ) . 
  if you manage to get more constant slant of the letters , it will be a significant improvement . 
   russian and ukrainian are so close together one can speak ukraine and a russian can understand . 
  no , this is incorrect . 
  russian and ukrainian are close but distinct languages , they have pretty much the same rules but many words that are used in ukrainian are not used in russian and vice versa . 
  russian can probably understand surjik - kind of a mix between russian and ukrainian spoken in eastern and central ukraine ( mostly in rural areas ) . 
   there was n't any forcing of language on them, 
  except there was . 
  each year there were less and less schools that teach in russian , for example . 
   russian language originates from the ukranian language in the first place, 
  nope , they both originate from old slavic dialects but then they went different ways . 
  may be it is not very hard for russian to learn ukrainian , but it seems wrong to me to force a language on people who never spoke it historically . 
  many european countries ( russia included ) provide language rights for their minorities , why not ukraine and baltics ? 
   putin began talking of reclaiming lands lost in the collapse of the soviet union, 
  please provide a quote of putin saying that . 
   i see no reason why they should have to cater to russians by having segregated schooling, 
  dunno , may be because forcing another language on people is generally considered a bad thing ? 
  and yes , it is forcing when people speak one language for centuries but their children are required to learn in other language . 
   but that does n't mean you should n't respect the people of the country you live in . 
  this goes both ways . 
  eastern ukraine was historically populated by russian people , they historically speak russian language and have russian culture . 
  why ukrainian government does n't respect them ? 
  same with baltics . 
  it is not the fault of russians who live there that their ancestors were sent there almost a century ago by the government of the country which does n't even exist today . 
  and while ukrainian is close to russian , estonian belongs to completely different language family and is a very difficult language to learn . 
  their neibour , finland , keeps swedish as a second official language for a minority of what , 5 % people or so ? 
  swedes are like 5 % of finland 's population , but swedish is second official language in finland . 
   nobody is being forced to use any language - they can speak russian just fine . 
  there is a difference between just being able to speak any language and being able to * keep * language and culture . 
  i actually do n't understand it . 
  forcible russification in soviet times is generally considered as a bad thing now , because attempt at destroying people 's languages and cultures blah blah blah , but somehow just the same process in reverse is not bad ? 
  that 's nice hypocrisy going on . 
   maybe for the last 100 years . 
  there 's been constant genocide and expulsion of native populations in the crimea/eastern ukraine region by russians for over 500 years . 
  so you do n't know the history of this region . 
  shame . 
  just so you know , most of the cities in eastern ukraine are historically russian . 
  and it is not very important for exactly how long they live there , one century or three . 
  they are not guests on that land , this is their home too . 
  my personal point of view is that all this non-citizen crap has no place in proper country respecting democracy and freedom . 
  finland keeps swedish as a second official language for a minority of what , 5 % of population ? 
  yet for balts it is apparently either ` get assimilated ' or ` get out ' . 
  first , it 's not 50 % , lets not exaggerate things out of proportion . 
  second , either you consider rights of minorities important , or not . 
  when you consider rights important only when it 's convenient for you , it 's just hypocrisy and nothing more . 
  what word in `` putin began talking '' you do n't understand ? 
  there is no cult of personality in modern russia . 
  because if one states `` putin began talking about something '' when in fact putin spoke nothing about it , it is a lie . 
  refuse to speak ? 
  you fucking wot mate ? 
  do you know how hard is to learn foreign language in 40 + , when you wake up one morning and suddenly you no longer live in ussr with russian as a lingua franca ? 
  estonian is even in completely different language family , it is fucking hard to learn . 
  wait wait wait . 
  you think it 's okay to bully and beat up and abuse people just because they speak not your language ? 
  that 's a page straight out from nazi book , you know . 
  are you aware that you are not making any sense ? 
  first , some people are more language-proficient that others . 
  second , it is one thing to learn some english and completely another to learn one of the most difficult languages in the world ( all finno-ugri\u0441 languages are very difficult to learn ) on a level acceptable for day-to-day conversation ( it is no good when you 're stumbling after each other word ) . 
  there is a reason for minority language rights in most civilized countries , you know . 
  ( and btw , there is no such thing as ` belgium language ' , so i dunno what the hell your ` mom ' did ` learned ' lol . ), 
  official language is not about ` saying simple things ' . 
  it is mostly about the language in which all the papers are written/printed/whatever . 
  requests , complains , contracts etc. 
  it is a bit harder than learning how to say ` what time is it ' . 
  this is the reason for having minority language rights : to not make life harder than it should be . 
  tatar guy moves to moscow from kazan , he expected to know russian ; but when in kazan , tatar language is official and can be used for all official things ( and is used widely ) . 
  same in many other countries . 
  balts just do n't want russians on their soil , they consider them as occupants , and making russian official even on regional level is kind of admitting that russians live there too . 
  there are about 30 official regional languages in russia . 
  what were you saying again ? 
   how big is russia and how big is each baltic state and its regions , how can you compare russia to baltics so easly ? 
  finland is small , their sweden minority is small too . 
  yet they keep swedish as a second official language ( and it 's not some ` brother ' language like russian/ukrainian ; swedish belongs to german family , whereas finnish belongs to finno-ugric family ) . 
  so no , size is not the reason for not providing a minority with language rights . 
   russian percentage who do n't want to know the culture or language and hence they ca n't do the basic exam to get the citizenship , instead they complain about rights, 
  official language means all official papers , requests , complaints , contracts etc. 
  must be in that language . 
  if i 've lived all my life in one country and one day woke up in another with different language that i now must learn or i would n't be able to do anything without a translator ... yeah , i 'd call that violation of my rights . 
   that 's the problem , they ca n't even to that . 
  may be because there is no reason for it ?
