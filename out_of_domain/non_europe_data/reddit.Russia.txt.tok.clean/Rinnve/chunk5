  i know exactly * nobody * who learned foreign language by memorising words and rules . 
  in russia , they do n't use the word `` frost '' - mostly because they speak russian language and not english . 
  on a more serious note , this is a mild word misuse/misunderstanding . 
  you see , russian language have different words for weather . 
  for example , there is '' \u0438\u043d\u0435\u0439 '' - that 's what you 're speaking of , if i 'm not mistaken . 
  ( here is a picture of '' \u0438\u043d\u0435\u0439 '' : http://900igr.net/photo/priroda/5-javlenija-1.files/026-inej.html ) according to dictionaries , '' \u0438\u043d\u0435\u0439 '' is translated as `` hoarfrost '' , `` rime '' , or ( most common ) just `` frost '' . 
  there is another word , '' \u043c\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0437 '' , designating freezing weather well below 0c . 
  ( it is harder to depict '' \u043c\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0437 '' , but this 'll do i think : http://hiblogger.net/img/articles_img/0/5/f/1111111-8473s.jpg ) . 
  and guess what ? 
  according to dictionaries , '' \u043c\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0437 '' should be translated as `` frost '' . 
  as such weather is less common for english-speaking countries , i 'd guess it is properly designated with some expression , not just a word . 
  but most people tend to use 1-to-1 translations which can be rather imprecise . 
  these sings mean that somebody in the neighbourhood ( a ) have an air gun and ( b ) is making fun shooting at random moving objects , preferably with lot of wonderfully breakable glass . 
  too bad you do n't have to prove that you 're not a retard in order to buy an air gun . 
  it 's an * average 24-hour * temperature , chill night hours included . 
  during day it 's about +35 c , which is pretty damn high . 
  that 's actually not a very good idea . 
  those expressions are mostly specific to certain dialect or context , and can sound funny at best if not used properly . 
  some of those expressions are outdated , some change meaning from time to time and from place to place . 
  is completely correct and * can * be used . 
  yes , it sounds funny , overly precise/bookish when spoken , but it 's totally ok in a book . 
  russian can be hard even for a native when you 're high . 
  the only use of `` ii ? '', 
  i can imagine is '' \u0418 ? '', 
  ( usually pronounced `` long '' : '' \u0438-\u0438-\u0438 '' ) . 
  it literally means `` and ? '', 
  and is used just like in english ( `` and [ what ] ? 
  '' , `` and [ what next ] ? 
  '' , something like that ) . 
  that 's basically russian variant of the urbandictionary.com . 
  try hola or tor . 
  ( tried it right now with tor , amsterdam exit relay ; site works just fine . ), 
  why do you think that `` ginger '' here means color ? 
  i 'd think a taste . 
  letters are ok , may be a little strange , but i 'd guess a painter or a designer , not a foreigner . 
  writing is consistent . 
  and , of course , high or drunk . 
  very possibly both , 
  100 days of 40c weather ? 
  shit . 
  and i though that texas is were people live . 
  no offence . 
  i just cant imagine that . 
  i guess it makes sense that chuck norris is a texas ranger , 
  at a risk of being a native , saying '' \u042f \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f '' is completely ok . 
  or for more extreme example ( imagine nazi chavs ) :, 
  ( well , that 's a very shameful exchange , if an imaginary one . ), 
  damn parrots , stealing our women . 
  please , speak for yourself . 
  not all russians believe in that crap . 
   russians also believe that women should not sit on cold pavements or stones ( ie outside ) , or they will never have children . 
  that 's not a belief , that 's a medical warning . 
  cold stones here tend to be really cold ( more than expected , that 's where danger is ) even in warmer seasons , so sitting here unprotected can really do some harm . 
  grammatica is quite unique , i honestly doubt that there are alternatives . 
  your best bet is wine , second one is virtualbox with windows . 
  that 's a good example that illustrates my point ^ ^ ^ up there ( if it is still up , hehe ) . 
  it is rather ... `` weak '' , so to say , but safe - both to use those words and to actually '' \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0431\u043b\u044f\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f '' - in contrast to '' \u0442\u0443\u0441\u0438\u0442\u044c '' , which can involve abusing all kinds of drugs . 
  are all specific to certain subcultures and/or age groups . 
  for example , amongs my friends ( not `` friends '' really , i mean '' \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043c\u044b\u0435 '' , acquaintances ) words like '' \u0442\u0443\u0441\u0438\u0442\u044c '' or '' \u0437\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0442\u044c '' are considered more like a `` gopnik style '' ( lowlife , basically ) . 
  it was different just two or three years ago , it will be different in two or three years . 
  whoa , it is now unclear even to myself  still , i hope that this helps a little . 
  if you 're serious , and if you can read at least something , then read books . 
  yeah , just like that . 
  child books for starters , '' \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u043a\u0438 '' are quite simple and can provide some insight and background on russian culture . 
  then not-so-hard classics like pushkin and gogol . 
  your main task is reading as much as you can take . 
  ( i 'd add `` and then some '' , but that takes some dedication and can do more harm than good . ), 
  i 'm afraid not . 
  it is all about subcultures of some sort , about local dialects and slang . 
  i do n't hang out with native english speakers , so no examples for you , 
   but let 's just come up with the most likely language that people in moscow would switch to talk about someone unsatisfactorily like spanish speakers could and do in america . 
  it just does n't work this way . 
  chechen people will switch to chechen language , georgian - to , well , georgian , armenian to armenian and so on . 
  there is no universal language besides russian in our vicinity . 
  in moscow as a whole - no . 
  some specific regions of moscow can be possibly dominated , but i live too far from it to be sure . 
  you do n't . 
  it 's just quicker this way . 
  but after you have some basis , the first thing you need is immersion . 
  rules do not define a natural language . 
  this sometimes is overlooked in `` pro '' courses . 
  i think i get it : if one is going for * full * immersion , there are too many people in m. / stp . 
  who can understand at least basic english . 
  in regions , you 're basically forced to speak russian . 
  fedorov 's clinic in tambov is doing very high quality eye work including lasik ( afaik it 's one of the best clinics in the country ) . 
  prices are here : http://www.mntk.ru/patients/prices/, 
  it seems that 12k rub is indeed very low , especially considering that vladivostok 's prices are generally about 1.5 times higher compared to central russia . 
  sorry for misguiding you , that 's actually moscow prices i 've linked . 
  here are tambov prices : http://www.mntk-tambov.ru/patients/prices/refractive_surgery/, 
  far more specific , and all prices are for one eye . 
  so i 'd guess that moscow prices are for one eye too . 
   if complications arise i can probably just visit any other clinic anyway and it wo n't cost too much, 
  dealing with complications on any complex medical procedure is always better in the same clinic ( except this one situation where clinic was shit and done more harm than good ) . 
  as far as i know , russian neo nazi are more concerned about people from caucasian republics ( chechnya and dagestan mostly ) and middle east ( especially tajikistan ) , mostly because those people cause trouble . 
  ca n't say much about st.p . 
  or moscow , but there is a bunch of african and chinese students in my city ; i have not even heard about any troubles . 
  '' \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0301\u0301 '' is always about time . 
  think of a schedule or something like that when choosing between '' \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430 '' / '' \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0443\u0436\u043d\u043e '' . 
  if unsure , '' \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0443\u0436\u043d\u043e '' is safer to use as it has broader meaning . 
  you 're late for like two years .
