  it kind of nice , yes , but it is not like this level of language knowledge will help to understand a contract or write a request to some official . 
   estonia , latvia and lithuania , baltic states are too damn small to be divided into regions with different languages . 
  finland is small too . 
  how comes that it is not small enough ` to be divided into regions with different languages ' ? 
   what do you mean there is no reason for it ? 
  `` it kind of nice , yes , but it is not like this level of language knowledge will help to understand a contract or write a request to some official . '', 
  i mean exactly this . 
   if you are a citizen of a country and you live there you better know the fucking language . 
  let 's not pretend that those people just appeared there out of thin air . 
  they lived there when russian was state-wise language , there was no need to learn local language . 
  be it their choice , may be some of them did n't moved to estonia/latvia/lithuania because learning another language for some people can be very hard . 
  but it was not their choice , the situation was different back then . 
  baltic states are apparently too self-important and too nationalistic to even attempt to integrate russian minority in their society as russian minority , not as assimilated pseudo-estonians/latvians/lithuanians . 
  are you trying to derail this discussion with irrelevant questions ? 
  no , i do n't live in baltics . 
   russians in estonia need to realize that they live in estonia and need to obey estonian laws ( language laws included ) or find a place that suites their views better and go there, 
  in proper countries this is called ` oppression of minorities ' and generally considered as a bad thing to do . 
  but that said , celebrating ss veterans is also considered as a bad thing to do . 
  hail estonia !, 
   the fact that we 're already seeing headlines of russia being `` concerned '' about the russian speakers in nato countries in the baltics is kind of foreshadowing . 
  official russia was concerned with the baltics for a long , long time . 
  because , you know , all this non-citizen crap and celebrating ss veterans smell kinda fishy . 
   general feeling coming from the kremlin , saying kazakhstan is not a real country , saying kiev is a russian city, 
  from the kremlin , eh ? 
  putin never said that kazakhstan is ` not a real country ' ; he praised nazarbayev for creating a real country . 
  about kiev , putin called it ` mother of all russian cities ' , it is [ a historical quote originating from konung oleg of novgorod ] ( http://www.russia-ic.com/people/general/o/791/ ) with a rather deep meaning , it can not be interpreted like ` calling kiev a russian city ' . 
   the baltic states need to respect russian minority and russia is concerned about it, 
  read up about non-citizen crap that goes on in the baltics . 
  that 's pretty much the definition of lack of respect to local minority . 
  heck , some authorities there strait out [ talk about rooting out russian language ] ( http://voiceofrussia.com/news/2014_02_06/rigas-anti-russian-policy-must-get-international-response-ministry-3753/ ) . 
   actions like violating air space and such, 
  ah , that game goes on for a long time , and it 's not like only russian forces play it . 
  edit : replaced a source on konung oleg with english one . 
  it 's not like the internetz are freely available in russia ... oh wait . 
  what i do know , it 's when there are numerous people that tell things like [ `` my ancestors live in `` latvia '' ( this land ) for 300 + years and they managed to live pretty well without russia . 
  but sad thing is - latvians still hate me for i am `` russian language bearer '' or `` occupant \\ invader '' . '' ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2ggtf7/russia_concerned_about_rights_of_russian_speakers/ckjlhn0 ) , there * are * some issues . 
   if you decide to go live in france, 
  but it is not the case . 
  ancestors of those people decided to live in a region where russian was one of official languages . 
  may be it was decided for them , it was ussr after all . 
   it 's like 7-8 old veterans, 
  that 's like 7-8 people more than it 's needed . 
  it 's fucking * ss * , after all . 
  part of the force that tried to exterminate russians . 
   i do n't see that the estonians who live in russia on the old first republics land ( since the 20 's ) get any estonian languages rights . 
  well , may be they should do something about it ? 
  i do n't know about any estonians asking for that . 
  other ethnicities in russia do get their language rights , i do n't think that 's impossible for estonians . 
   now i wonder if any baltic state language is official language of region of siberia . 
  as far as i know , there is no significant baltic minority living in siberia . 
   but when official stuff , that should be official language only . 
  if there is significant minorities , most of the civilized countries allow them to use their language for official stuff . 
  apparently , baltics are not civilized enough . 
  you should learn from your neighbors from both west and east . 
   while they ca n't even bother to learn the first one, 
  tell me , how many languages do you know ? 
  i mean , on a level that is enough for day-to-day use , including reading and writing fairly complex documents , like bank contract ? 
   why would you respect someone who hates you and your country , tell me ? 
  should n't respect be mutual ? 
  yes it should . 
  every time baltic-russian issues are discussed , all i hear is ` russians must russians must russians must ' . 
  russians must learn our language , russians must respect our culture , russians must do this or that . 
  may be i missing something , but rarely i encounter something about what latvian/estonian/lithuanian government/people do to better integrate russian minority in their society . 
   are you telling me russian people are incapable of learning a language of the country they are living in ? 
  why would n't they be capable of learning the language ? 
  may be because all people are different ? 
  for some learning different language can be serious trouble . 
   why can german , chinese or other people come to our country, 
  exactly . 
  they come to your country knowing that they come to a different country that speaks different language . 
  russians came/were transferred to baltics knowing that this is bilingual region and they will be perfectly fine knowing only russian which was state-wise official anyways . 
   who dont want to put an effort to integrate, 
  may be , just may be it has something to do with * how exactly * do you want them to integrate . 
  you want them to scrap their language and their culture , to became pseudo-latvians of sorts . 
  not all are ready to do this even if they have the capability for learning another language . 
  you are equaling foreigners that moved to your country for a year and people who are living there for generations . 
  this is problematic way to integrate a minority . 
  i actually lol ` ed irl while listening to pretty grim doom metal . 
  thanks for ruining the mood . 
  146 % was was russia-24 fuckup , not some ` rigged elections ' , and it was about duma ( parliament ) elections , not putin . 
  get your facts straight and stop spreading bullshit . 
   there a difference in the letters, 
  nope . 
  all the letters that are shared between latin and cyrillic look * exactly * the same ( some lower-case letters look different , but it is not something subtle : k / \u043a , b / \u0432 etc. ), 
  eh , try some ? 
  lost it at this . 
  yep . 
  other one such sort sold in russia is brynza ( \u0431\u0440\u044b\u043d\u0437\u0430 ) , that one is a tad more salty . 
  i use it in greek salad , it 's delicious . 
  depends on the store , more often it 's prepackaged but some stores sell it by weight ( depends on supplier i think ) . 
  my my , we have a gourmet here  thanks by the way , i 'm not a cheese person but i 'm always in for a something new . 
  you 're right of course , but those days i came to a conclusion about general reddit political discourse : hurr hurr durr durr . 
  in other words , discussing politics on reddit is only meaningful for practicing english . 
  protests are not illegal in russia , that 's western media bullshit . 
  there are some rules for protesters ( just like in any other civilized country ) , recent law introduced criminal charges for those who repeatedly break said rules . 
  western media reported it as ` all protesting made illegal ' . 
  [ washington post ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/07/22/meanwhile-in-russia-putin-passes-law-against-protests/ ), 
  `` russian president vladimir putin on tuesday signed a law into effect criminalizing repeated street protests '', 
  this article says nothing about that this law is about * illegal * protesting and that there is a way to hold a completely legal protest in russia . 
   the fact that you think that the west thinks it 's illegal,
