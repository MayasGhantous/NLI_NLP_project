  also , i 've never said ' a lot ' . 
  it 's not like we can dismiss neo-nazi rise as insignificant because it 's ` not a lot of them ' , because when it 's a lot , it would be far too late . 
  two threads about azov during last 30 days . 
  `` all you report on '' my ass . 
  i want you to show one example of / r/russia thread calling ukrainians nazis not because they are members of neo-nazi group , but because they are ukrainians . 
  in other words , an example of `` decrying the ukranians as nazis '' . 
  it is not me who needs to defend that thread and that video . 
  it is you who must prove it an example of `` decrying the ukranians as nazis '' and not a legitimate concern at neo-nazism rising . 
  you 're going to write off a man concerned at ultranationalism and neo-nazism rising in neighbor country * as `` an apologist for a bunch of ultranationalist wankers '' ? 
  * are you for real ? 
  this is a whole new level of double think . 
   ultranationalist fascistic state that 's invading a peaceful neighbour, 
  you 're dangerously high on anti-russian propaganda . 
  honestly , calling russia an ` ultranationalist state ' just shows how little you know about actual russia . 
  it 's oxymoron . 
   peaceful neighbor, 
  this `` peaceful neighbor '' was shelling its own citizens with imprecise mrls and issuing air strikes in the middle of the city , amongst other nice peaceful things . 
  this was well documented too , contrary to ` russian invasion ' which was ` proven ' only by inconsistent social media posts and unintelligible satellite images . 
   and do n't quote orwell, 
  i will quote whoever and whatever i see fit , mister ` there are no nazis in ukraine ' . 
  til that russian troops are so hardcore that couple dozen of them can invade neighbor state and hold off its entire army . 
   putin refusing to acknowledge the sovereign right of a former soviet republic to make deals with whomever the hell they want ? 
  russia has trade agreement with moldova . 
  moldova-eu agreement most probably would affect moldova 's trade with russia , may be hurting russian economic in process . 
  it 's that simple . 
  it is related to the gender of words that designate objects . 
  '' \u041e\u0431\u0430 '' used with masculine/neuter words , '' \u043e\u0431\u0435 '' used with feminine ones . 
  for example :, 
  ` holy farts ' ( or ` holy farters ' , meaning a man who farts , in plurar ) . 
  now * that 's * some serious spin . 
  i ca n't say that they outright lie , at least not yet , but the bias is oh so obvious here . 
  take 2nd chechen war , for example . 
  it was somehow about `` russia 's territorial integrity '' and `` prestige '' , not about crime and terrorism and invasion to dagestan led by chechen-based radical islamists . 
  the phrase about disintegration of ussr being a geopolitical catastrophe is presented as if putin somehow believes that it was ... 
  i do n't know , orchestrated by the west or something . 
  it is very interesting though that they did n't cite another putin 's phrase : `` whoever does not miss the soviet union has no heart . 
  whoever wants it back has no brain . '' i dunno , may be because it kind of contradicts the whole article . 
  have a downvote for `` not slavs '' . 
  do you really believe that you are any better for being not slavs ? 
  because i 'm pretty sure it came out just like that . 
  chernobyl and fukushima are * nothing * compared to what burning hydrocarbons is doing to the environment on the daily basis , including radiation poisoning . 
  except previous poster said nothing about slavs . 
  there is no direct equivalent . 
  i mean , direct translation would be something like '' \u0441\u0440\u0430\u043d\u044c \u0433\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044f '' , it is correct and perfectly understandable by russians , it 's just that we do n't use that phrase . 
  religion-based invectives are n't native to russian language . 
  casus belli for second chechen war was chechen 's invasion to dagestan in 1999 . 
   foreign armed personnel at the polling stations and only 2 options , neither of them in support of staying with the ukraine . 
  first , there were no armed personnel at the polling station . 
  at least i failed to find any evidence ( photos/videos ) for that . 
  second , one of the options said literally `` return to 1992 year constitution of crimea and * remain as a part of ukraine * '' . 
  vodka thing is a stereotype . 
  sure thing , many russians prefer vodka to other alcoholic beverages , but it is still reserved for some kind of celebration , not daily use ( which is generally considered unhealthy , at least amongst more or less educated people ; actually , many youngsters i know are very pro health and may not drink at all , this is a very visible change from when i was youngster myself in nineties ) . 
  [ corruption in eu is breathtaking ] ( http://m.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26014387 ), 
  edit : forgot how to make links on mobile reddit . 
  anyways , hope you get the point . 
  for moscow , you need a knowing native to guide you to interesting historical places of sight . 
  without that , yes , enormous bland city . 
  eh , men shake hands with women , but it is considered something very business-like , at least in my circle . 
  quite appropriate at business meeting , but not in the every day life . 
  or , one can go after some nice expensive sort of vodka , but those are surprisingly hard to find in a general stores ( but if you manage to find it , you can present yourself on a ` knowledgable ' side ; the trick is to know which sort is actually nice , the price very often does n't correspond with quality ), 
   because eu is against corruption, 
  `` the extent of corruption in europe is `` breathtaking '' and it costs the eu economy at least 120bn euros ( # 99bn ) annually , the european commission says . 
  it seems that it is against corruption on the words mostly . 
   in russia it 's straight up courruption from the head and the complete and only system, 
  something tells me that you have no idea on the extent of corruption in russia . 
  because it * was separate country * before , an autonomous republic . 
  states in the usa also have their own governments and laws . 
  you can get cortana if you switch your phone to us locale . 
  of course , this way you 'll be using english menus and us units , but if you want to try it , it 's possible . 
  i 'm not sure why are you downvoted , but the inability to remove contact picture is pretty retarded indeed . 
  sip is quite specific , but since ms owns skype ... not going to happen . 
  read - write - listen - speak , that 's the priority for all foreign languages i believe ( at least if you 're serious about it ) . 
  it is a priority though , not a strict order , you should learn it all more or less simultaneously . 
  and yes , watching tv shows with subs ( preferably in russian too ) would help tremendously after you 'll learn basics ( but not if chosen tv show is boring or meh , it should be fascinating , that 's the whole point ) . 
  not sure why you was downvoted , but you 're completely correct . 
  yes , ' \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043c\u044f ' is more often translated as a ` banner ' ( flag that has some emblems or symbols , basically ) . 
  you should learn first the meaning of the word ` kulak ' and educate yourself in the history of that period which is so complex there are books written on it that are so thick that they can be used for clearing the world of dumb shit like you . 
  an example of political hypocrisy . 
  georgia got their freedom from the ussr all right , but somehow abkhazian nation ca n't get its freedom from georgia . 
   so there was no mass deportation in ukraine to siberia ? 
  there was n't . 
  there was mass deportation of kulaks and all accused of being kulak , though . 
  ethnicity played no role there . 
   the majority of deaths were n't ukrainian ? 
  ~ 3 mil ukrainians , ~ 2 mil russians , ~ 1 mil kazakhs . 
  technically a majority , but not really . 
  please explain ` ethnical cleansing ' in the context of hundreds of thousands of grain and other food sent to starving regions when the central soviet government realized the situation . 
  please explain in the context of the ` ethnical cleansing ' the fact that the most brutal actions were committed by local party authorities who were ethnically ukrainian . 
  nuke is easily controlled , as is chemical charge . 
  biological , on the other hand , is fucking unpredictable . 
  not even terrorists are mad enough to use it . 
  yet . 
  eh , not really , tactical nuke is called tactical for a reason . 
  it 's just a shell with a really big boom . 
  not nearly enough to wipe out a city . 
  fallout sucks , though , but tactical nuke is still on completely different scale level . 
  ` destroying battalions ' vs ` destroying nations ' . 
  not deserving mad response . 
   moscow crushed local dissent in ukraine by accusing anyone that could be considered leadership of revolt of being a kulak . 
  it was * not * specific for ukraine .
