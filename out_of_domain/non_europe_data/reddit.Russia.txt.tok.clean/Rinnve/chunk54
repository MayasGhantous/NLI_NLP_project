  anti-kulak policy was applied ( and heavily abused by local authorities ) among all the ussr . 
  as i said , ethnicity played no role there , but some people still try to twist history and present it as an ` anti-ukrainian ' or ` anti-kazakh ' or basically anti any ethnicity except russian , conveniently forgetting the fact that most ` kulaks ' were russian . 
   ussr was run from the top down . 
  no , it was not . 
  it is impossible to ` run from the top down ' a country this big and diverse . 
   stalin also was from georgia but it did n't stop him from a policy of russification throughout ussr either . 
  of course it did n't , ethnicity was meaningless for the communists , this ideology is above ethnicity . 
  they thought that russian language and culture is most fitting as an inter-ethnic glue , so they pushed for russification . 
   also at a bare minimum 4.5 million ukrainians died . 
  that is the vast majority of deaths . 
  even citing your own source ( which is heavily biased and imprecise because many important historical documents were declassified in nineties , after the fall of ussr ) :, 
  `` the commission stated that a minimum of 4.5 million victims ( ** while assumed ukrainians as sole nation and inhabitants of the ukrainian ssr [ 9 ] ** ) perished ** with an additional three million outside the ukrainian ssr . 
  they ignored the fact that many inhabitants of the ukrainian ssr were russian , and they state that some three million died outside , so no for your ` the vast majority of deaths ' . 
  presenting the great famine of 1932 as the genocide of ukrainians is disrespectful to history and to those russians and kazakhs ( and people of other ethnicities ) who died there too . 
  actually , the article says that rebels captured and used ukrainian buk . 
   pro-russian rebels are likely under command of russia, 
   likely, 
  yeah . 
   despite every single piece of evidence ( and there is a lot to go around ), 
  except this ` evidence ' wo n't hold in any court . 
  except strelkov do n't have twitter account ( or any other social media account for that matter ) . 
   or any other social media account for that matter, 
  strelkov tells about his new ` official ' information resource ( icorpus.ru ) : http://youtube.com/watch?v=5nn4kwqsmfe, 
  strelkov answers the question about accounts in social media : http://icorpus.ru/strelkova-akkaunty-socialnyx-setyax/ ( ` no , i do n't have social media accounts ' ) . 
  vk group that bragged about downed ` an-26 ' ( mh-17 ) is not related to strelkov in any matter and is run by unknown persons . 
   it 's not like \u0421\u0432\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0438 \u0421\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430 were considered to be fake until the downing of the plane . 
  it 's not like there was an important reason to consider it fake or not fake . 
  it is a post in a social network which sports a photo of strelkov and is titled `` summaries from strelkov igor ivanovich '' . 
  i can go and make a vk news group with , say , angela merkel photo and `` summaries from german chancellor '' title , and then post said summaries . 
  will it be an official page of angela merkel ? 
  should we hold merkel responsible for what is posted on that page if i go and post unchecked information ? 
  of course no . 
  why the fuck same rules are not applied to strelkov ?

  of course no . 
  why the fuck same rules are not applied to strelkov ? 
  yeah , i got several silent downvotes for a completely reasonable comment seconds after pressing the `` save '' button , and it is * me * who is called a bot . 
  here , take a downvote too , dumbass . 
  so , like any other civilian plane mistakenly destroyed by the military . 
  there were no photographs or website updates that would hold up in court . 
  that is , photographs or website updates that clearly link the events to rebels ( or to anybody at all , for that matter ) . 
   those same `` rules '' are completely stupid . 
  yeah , because it is oh so very convenient to link social media group made by unknown people to the rebels , and then use posts in said group as an evidence . 
  `` rebels said this '' , `` rebels said that '' , `` rebels boasted on the social media '' whereas rebels did n't use social media at all and * said so months ago * . 
  i said * nothing * about the west . 
  forbes wrote in that article about a social media site belonging to strelkov whereas strelkov said that he does n't uses social media at all . 
  in other words , forbes outright lied . 
  what is so hard to get about it ? 
   russia literally has over half the world 's population of neo nazis though . 
  this myth about ` half the world 's population of neo nazis ' originates from [ singe abc news article ] ( http://abcnews.go.com/nightline/story?id=3718255&amp;page=1#.ucdbiaa4sui ) which , quite unsurprisingly , just pulls the number out of the thin air . 
  it is interesting how this ... ` information ' had spread this quick and this far without any attempts at checking the facts . 
   then someone had posted on social media admitting it , you would guarantee that people like you , rt etc. 
  no , not me . 
  that 's irrelevant though . 
  what is relevant is that using unknown social media sources that could be made by anybody as an evidence is wrong , in any context . 
  it is a lie , a propaganda and nothing more . 
  and you 're justifying it !, 
   so if anyone in the west `` says '' anything its a lie . 
  nope . 
  i repeat : forbes wrote in that article about a social media site belonging to strelkov whereas strelkov said that he does n't uses social media at all . 
  he said so * a month before * mh17 tragedy . 
  so they stated something that is not true . 
  it is called a lie . 
  owners of that social media page clarified an hour later that message was * not * from strelkov . 
  yet forbes uses one message that suits their narrative ( `` strelkov '' bragging about downed airplane ) and ignores other message * from the same source * that does not suit their narrative ( that previous message was * not * from strelkov ) . 
  if this is not propaganda , i do n't know what is . 
   the rebels were bringing down planes before mh17 was brought down . 
  then mh17 was brought down above the rebel controlled area . 
  the rebels brought down more planes after mh17 was brought down . 
  there is big difference between downing a low flying fighter jet with a manpad and using complex hi-tech sam system that requires months of training at the very least . 
  so that argument about previously downed planes does n't work ( at least if there were no other high altitude kills , and afaik there were none ) . 
  and no , i have no intent to whitewash strelkov or something . 
  it is quite possible that the plane was indeed killed by separatists . 
  it is also possible that somebody other did it . 
  instead of proper investigation , though , the world is fed with lies and propaganda pieces like that forbes article . 
  so it is now ok to outright lie because kremlin likes to create doubt about everything ? 
  it very convenient , because one can mark anybody who questions lies as a kremlin apologist . 
  but it is not even ` not a 100 % evidence ' . 
  it is a social media page * that clearly states that it is not directly linked to strelkov * , and forbes ( and others ) says that it is , without any evidence , just because we 're all supposed to believe . 
  it is that simple . 
  yeah , that 's it . 
  you can also add ' \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u044b\u0439 ' to intensify it . 
   total nonsense , the evidence points towards the rebels , it 's overwhelming . 
  we are not discussing the evidence in general , we are discussing this specific piece of ` evidence ' , namely a social media post where ` separatists ' and strelkov personally boast about downed ukrainian military plane ( while in fact that social media group was * not * run by strelkov or men under his command , and guys who run that group * clearly specified that the message was from not a repost from strelkov , but local observers * ) . 
   you obviously prefer the closed and entirely state controlled media landscape in russia ? 
  i obviously prefer an open and pluralistic media that the west is supposed to have . 
  instead , i too often get crude lies that abuse the fact that most of the readers do n't speak russian and ca n't do fact checking . 
   that 's probably because acts of homophobia are n't legal in many western countries . 
  are you aware that acts of homophobia are n't legal in russia either ? 
  it is somewhat exaggerated , but there is serious drinking problem , mostly amongst lower-skilled or unlucky people who start drinking instead of trying to change something in their life ( which , i admit , can be sometimes almost impossible ) - and from that point , it is self-fulfilling prophecy . 
  source : am russian . 
   in russia it is illegal to even say `` homosexuality is normal '', 
  nope . 
  it is illegal to promote the idea of equality of homo - and hetero-relationships to minors ( and for a reason : because homo - and hetero-relationships are not equal ) . 
   the acts of violence shown in that film frequently go unpunished, 
  nope , they do n't . 
   gays are routinely attacked , tortured , humiliated and murdered with no repercussions, 
  one or two cases in an year is ` routinely ' ?
