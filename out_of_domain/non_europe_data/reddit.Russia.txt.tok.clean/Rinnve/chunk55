  and nope , there are repercussions . 
  and before you ask for sources , look how many sources are in your comment . 
  ( btw , i * can * provide sources . 
  but its late and i 'm tired after work and want to finally transfer my system to that new shiny ssd , so google yourself . ), 
  eh , it 's one thing to ` lubricate ' a deal with a shot or two of high-quality vodka , and quite another to drink some vodka-resembling shit on the daily basis . 
  drinking becomes a really serious problem when it is constant , it then starts affecting social life and health leading to eventual self-destruction . 
  ( business drinking is a problem too , of course , but not on the same level ... most of the times . ), 
   sources , and most of the high profile ones are just a minority of the actual crimes occurring, 
  do you have some * data * to back this statement ? 
   now show me your sources of how it is n't so bad in russia . 
  especially page 46 , which shows that from 2011 to 2013 there were total 40 anti-gay hate crimes in russia and 4476 such crimes in usa . 
  but somehow usa is working on lgbt rights , but russia is having a huge lgbt issue and is literally the gay hell . 
  why not renault duster ? 
  x-ray is basically restyled duster , as i understand it . 
   they have ? 
  nope . 
  there was a warning that since bitcoin can be used for illicit activities , any users of bitcoin can be subject for investigation . 
  but that 's it . 
  if only you could back your words with a link or two ... sadly , you ca n't , since you 're talking out of your ass . 
  of their * foreign currency income * , which was mostly irrelevant for self-sustaining ussr economy ( just look up foreign trade balance of the ussr compared to internal production , it is kind of obvious ) . 
  insane economic change named ` perestroika ' was what ruined the ussr economy , not oil prices . 
  chechen islamists were largely backed by saudis . 
  guess who is saudis ' best friend ? 
   in russia , probably , yea, 
  nope , not automatically . 
  but anonymous currency that was indeed used for drug trade and other shit like that ? 
  i can see their point . 
  ( one can argue that cash is anonymous too , but cash ca n't be easily transferred . ), 
  first , ` brian m. heiss ' does n't sound like a russian name to me . 
  that 's because it is n't . 
  second , and more importantly , this research has links to other sources , including official fbi reports . 
  it is sad that you chose to run circles with fingers in your ears , oblivious to any information that contradicts your image of the world . 
  suit yourself . 
  drunken driving is n't a thing in russia . 
  sure , it happens from time to time , but most people do understand that it 's a really bad idea . 
  drinking at work , on the other hand ... well , this accident speaks for itself . 
   it 's figures from `` the fbi '' are n't even correct, 
  what exactly is incorrect ? 
  all the numbers are sourced . 
  please point to incorrectly cited or interpreted numbers . 
   half of the citations are moscow times or opinion pieces from us papers . 
  there are like four or five short citations from the moscow times , all factual reports . 
  as for opinion pieces , are they important for the point of this work ? 
   1 ) deny there is a problem, 
  please cite where this work denies that there is a problem with gay acceptance in russia . 
   2 ) blame the us and pretend things are worse there, 
  that may have something to do with how us is portrayed like progressive country that moves forward * and * russia is portrayed like some horribly backwards gay hell , whereas both statements are actually false . 
  also , ` pretend ' ? 
  bigotry of some ... beings from the usa 's bible belt is top notch , it is exceptionally hard to find something like that in russia . 
   3 ) call all negative comments about russia `` us propaganda '', 
  please cite where this paper calls * all * negative comments ` us propaganda ' , not only those that ignore facts or are not based on the facts at all . 
   4 ) use lies and double speak to blindly support russia . 
  please cite said lies and double speak . 
   i gave you international sources that contradict your ridiculous piece of propaganda, 
  you gave me opinion pieces that press on emotions , but have almost zero numbers and statistics , so they do not show real situation at all . 
  ` oh look , that guy lost an eye and investigators refuse to work !, 
  ' , ` oh look , two gays got seriously beaten up !, 
  ' , ` oh look , 25 shocking stories ' , and so on and on and on . 
  and you compare this shit to cold numbers and statistics ? 
   4 ) use lies and double speak to blindly support russia . 
  please cite said lies . 
  see , i made it easier for you . 
  there is no need to write a wall of text that pretends to contain some grain of sense , just fucking ** cite ** . 
  yes , you 're using it wrong . 
  see , when the user enters ` quit ' , the cycle continues because while, 
  is false , the other clause is still true because `` quit '' ! = `` done '' , and false or true is true . 
  you should use and ( & & ) instead . 
  or , even better , use a bit more complex but more intuitive expression :, 
  while ( !, 
  ( shape = = `` quit '' | | shape = = `` done '' ) ), 
  which reads as ` do things while shape is not equals either to `` quit '' or `` done '' ' . 
  nope , there must be a parameter . 
  for an infinite loop it 's while ( 1 ) or while ( true ) . 
  eh , that 's exactly what they did . 
  no the whole website , but [ specific pages ] ( https://antizapret.info/index.php?search=archive.org ) . 
  edit : silent downvotes for pointing to a fact ? 
   they could n't . 
  they ask the site owners to block specific pages and if that is n't done - they block the site . 
  bullshit , roskomnadzor 's list contains urls of blocked pages , not just domain names / ip addresses . 
  it is not quite easy to block urls . 
  small providers can do it through transparent proxy , but large ones must use dpi hardware to cope with enormous traffic , and that hardware is n't cheap . 
  so what ? 
  this registry basically contains ip addresses , domain names and urls , so if some provider ca n't block url , it still could block by domain name or ip . 
  i understand that this ` temporary regulation ' is written quite badly , but no , ip block it 's not like that law works . 
  it was explained by roskomnadzor itself : http://rkn.gov.ru/press/conference/conf8.htm, 
  you 're confusing hosting providers and internet access providers . 
  the hosting provider ( or the site owner ) must remove unlawful resources ( pages/sites ) , and if they fail , internet access providers must use the registry to restrict access to said resources . 
  roskomnadzor itself ca n't block anything , they can only require internet access providers to do so , and the explanation i 've linked earlier was intended for internet access providers . 
  they ( internet access providers , ' \u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0437\u0438 ' ) can indeed choose to block resources by ip , the law allows it , and some providers do so . 
  the law does not requires to block by ip , and major providers ( well , at least rostelekom and transtelekom ) do n't block by ip , they block precisely listed urls and nothing more . 
   unless the op article is completely wrong on a key listed fact, 
  it kind of is . 
  antizapret.info is run by one of internet access providers and its info is what access providers receive from roskomnadzor , so it 's pretty accurate . 
  edit : newsru.com later clarified that part about individual pages , but first sentence still talks about archive.org in general . 
  in this particular case it does n't matters . 
  honestly , the distinction between while and do-while loops is miniscule most of the times ; some algorithms can be made a bit more readable by using appropriate kind of cycle , but that 's it . 
   however , isps are not likely to muck about with domains and urls when the ip is in the registry . 
  by acting this way , they piss off clients . 
  seems like rostelekom is back to bad old ways . 
   you are essentially hoping that all involved parties will `` behave responsibly '' .
