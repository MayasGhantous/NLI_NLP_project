  i am not `` hoping '' . 
  transtelekom was acting responsibly ( by blocking specific urls only ) from the start . 
  rostelekom sometimes acts responsibly , sometimes ( more often ) not , they are assholes in more ways than one . 
  sadly , it is a bit more complicated . 
  they do n't * require * to block by ip/domain name , but if some access provider is too lazy to block urls , it is allowed to block entire ip . 
  too bad that one of the biggest russian providers ( rostelekom ) is used to act in asshole ways . 
  isp : telemir68 ( small local provider working in lipetsk and michurinsk ) , 100 mbps fiber ; megafon 3g service for smartphone . 
  hardware : nokia lumia 720 , ipad mini , somewhat outdated custom computer rig running windows 8.1 pro . 
  there are no photos with over-applied/pseudo hdr in this article, 
  [ the moscow times is full of shit . 
  the archive.org was n't blacklisted , of course . 
  only pages that contain illicit info were . 
  the article on your link never says that archive.org ( or any other * site * ) was banned . 
  it also correctly says that blocked are `` 32 \u0441\u0441\u044b\u043b\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e '' ( 32 links to the illicit video ) . 
  it is very well integrated in yandex services and has some nice features that are hardly useful outside russia . 
  basically its chrome + better interface/usability + some preinstalled yandex-specific addons . 
  if you do n't find yandex services useful , yandex.browser would n't be useful too . 
  edit : oh , and it 's hardly new , i 've been installing it as a default browser to less computer-friendly people for about two years already ( it has nice antimalware features ) . 
  nothing interesting , it 's just a presentation about [ alexander blok ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_blok ) made by some student who apparently did n't knew how to convert it from openoffice to ms office or something ( i ca n't quite recall the details ) . 
  forgot to delete it after helping . 
  translation : about 70 sites did n't did anything about illicit video , 32 links to it will be blocked starting [ this ] friday , ** and the rest after weekend . 
  see ? 
  nothing vague about it . 
  on my windows 8.1 it 's on the apostrophe , not semicolon . 
  yeah , it 's good . 
  but it 's not free . 
  many people here are not yet used to the idea of buying software too , not just computer . 
  well , in my city i would n't say there are significant changes . 
  yet . 
  prices are somewhat higher , for example i bought a pair of german-made winter shoes today for 5k roubles which would 've cost me about 4.5 k a year ago . 
  all in all i 'd say prices are +10 -15 % to what was in august . 
  compared to the nineties it 's nothing . 
   do you all suppose that russia might resort again to the y.e. ? 
  it 's a loooong way down to that . 
  there is a plenty of time for damage control . 
  - \u0443\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 ( `` conventional unit '' or something like that ) . 
  using dollars for trade was and is illegal in russia , but since ruble was not worth the paper it was printed on , everything was priced in dollars , except those dollars were under the guise of `` conventional unit '' . 
  basically it 's that simple , $ 1 = 1 \u0443.\u0435 . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , \u0443.\u0435 . 
  was outlawed too in late nineties or early ... how do you say it ? 
  `` twenties '' ? 
  when in europe , behave yourself and call football as it should be called . 
  just a friendly tip , sorry . 
  it was outlawed . 
  well , [ not exactly outlawed ] ( http://www.utro.ru/articles/2007/03/21/634669.shtml ) , one can still use \u0443.\u0435. , but since there is this requirement about stating all prices in rubles too , why bother ? 
  they were made impractical both by the economics and the law , and successful businesses are ones that adapt quickly . 
  sure , things can change back , but i doubt that it would take any less of another hyperinflation for \u0443.\u0435 . 
  to return . 
  teh internetz are international , buddy . 
  at least for now . 
  ( aaaaand here goes another shot of white horse : for free internet ! ), 
   he is introduced to a caged bear in a national park that has become an alcoholic ( because visitors think it 's amusing to pour vodka in its water trough ) and to a renowned prostate specialist in a st petersburg clinic , who paid $ 8,000 for what might ( or might not ) be the penis of the grubby monk who hypnotised a tsar -- rasputin . 
  you what about what ? 
  i mean , it 's serioius what about what in what is what . 
  on a completely serious note , wha ? 
  on a really serious note , i ca n't even comprehend amount of bullshit that is flowing around the world about russia , and it 's not really about this piece . 
  it 's not even malicious or something , just ridiculous to the ridiculous points of , ah , scientific proven equivalent of 100 % ridiculoulty . 
  exactly my thoughts after reading this article . 
  aaaand we 're back to my initial response to that article . 
  because , you know , i can understand some phrases , some words in it , but when i try to get it all together , i fail completely . 
  there is supposed to be some meaning to it , no ? 
  some central idea , you know , about what exactly this article is ? 
   177 acts of violence against blacks have been reported in russia since 2010, 
  [ according to fbi ] ( http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-crime/2011/tables/table-1 ) , in 2011 alone there were reported more than 2,000 anti-black hate crime incidents . 
  but yeah , russia is ` hell on earth ' . 
  universal recipe for demonizing a country :, 
  1 ) find several serious incidents on chosen topic ( people of color , lgbt , women , whatever ) . 
  two or three will be enough , and in a big country there are all kinds of incidents . 
  2 ) describe those incidents in all horrible details . 
  3 ) important : do not provide proper statistics !, 
  individual incidents is all that matters . 
  it is not important at all that probability of being struck by lightning is way higher than whatever you 're presenting . 
  after all , journalism is about planting the right ideas in the minds of your readers . 
  there are too few black people living here compared to the usa , that 's the main reason . 
  also , there is no big history with them like , you know , slavery and racial inequality . 
  ( guys from caucasus , on the other hand , are often disliked and outright hated , and not without a reason . ), 
   i also notice it says this is the number of acts reported , and not necessarily the number of acts that occur . 
  yes , most probably that is true . 
  russian police tend to not register hard to solve cases that also are not dangerous ( like , for example , petty theft when there were no security cameras ) . 
  natives can press on and force police to register it anyways , but that would be impossible for guys that have problems speaking russian , let alone illegal immigrants . 
  but ` hell on earth ' ? 
  only because of the weather . 
   and what % of the population in russia is of african descent versus the united states ? 
  how does this affect the frequency of crime related to race in both areas ? 
  and what is the severity of the cases in question ? 
  who are you to subjectively call 177 crimes the same as 2,000 with complete disregard to the specific cases in question ? 
  and what % of these crimes are reported in both countries ? 
  is this an incidence of how in the united states we have a higher than normal infant mortality rate because of how we count `` infants '' , for instance ? 
  yes , those are legitimate questions . 
  you should ask them to la-times journalists , though . 
  if they label russia as ` hell on earth ' for african migrants , they must 've proper answers , no ? 
   the fact you think your leading questioning did anything whatsoever by saying `` it 's not really a problem because it 's more of a problem somewhere else '', 
  do not put words in my mouth . 
  ever . 
  nowhere did i say that it is not a problem in russia . 
  what i did said is if it is ` hell on earth ' with 177 reported crimes of unknown severity , what it must be in usa , a go-to example of the first world country , a beacon of freedom and democracy ? 
   correct the error that is you . 
  you have serious psychological issues , dude . 
  i 'd recommend you to go and see a doctor . 
  you 're kind of missing my point here .
