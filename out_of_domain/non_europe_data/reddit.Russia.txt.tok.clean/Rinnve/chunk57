  rate of 1/904 can seem ` far worse ' that 1/22500 , but this article has nothing to do with analyzing the situation ( because there was no analysis at all ! ), 
  and everything to do with demonizing russia ( the title itself kind of suggests it ) . 
  you can remove that sentence about usa , and my point still holds . 
  it is not about usa at all . 
  it is about shitty journalism . 
  if only there could exist a worldwide network of computing devices that can be used for communication between people amongst the world ... oh wait . 
  no , because they promoted unlawful protests . 
  but if one wanted to read those ( i really do n't know what for , authors on those sites do n't have a slightest idea of quality journalism ) , it 's super easy to bypass any blocks . 
  and there are many other sites in the internet that contain ` real facts ' ( that is , facts presented without pro-russian bias ) that are not blocked . 
   i hate them for tearing down the statue of a gay man, 
  what, 
   and you wo n't be persecuted for being gay in any state . 
  you wo n't be in russia either . 
  try and read the article . 
  your code only works with existing files , because it 's impossible to open non-existing file in ios : : in mode for obvious reasons . 
  flush file after writing . 
  there should be file < < flush ; right before file.seekg ( 0 , ios : : beg ) ;, 
  your reading loop is a bit incorrect , it reads the last character twice ( not sure why though , c++ streams still confuse me sometimes ) . 
  it can be corrected like this :, 
  while ( file.get ( ch ) ) {, 
  [ working code ] ( https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8bac1df5875eaaed3264 ), 
  ( at least it seems to work ), 
  what kind of budget are we talking about ? 
  try and look up courses offered by universities in smaller cities : voronezh , tambov , lipetsk , saratov , penza to name a few . 
  they tend to be much cheaper than moscow or peter ( although it still probably going to cost $ 1-2k ) . 
  [ apparently ] ( http://slovari.yandex.ru/~%d0%ba%d0%bd%d0%b8%d0%b3%d0%b8/%d0%ad%d1%82%d0%b8%d0%bc%d0%be%d0%bb%d0%be%d0%b3%d0%b8%d1%87%d0%b5%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b8%d0%b9%20%d1%81%d0%bb%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%b0%d1%80%d1%8c/%d0%a4%d1%83%d1%84%d0%b0%d0%b9%d0%ba%d0%b0/ ) it stems from italian ` fofa ' . 
  it seems interesting to me that i failed to find any actual sources on that . 
  in which contest she was chosen , and by whom ? 
  there is no information at all about this event in russian . 
  this is incorrect . 
  many russians use facebook and google ( especially google via android , which is the most popular smartphone platform in russia by far ) . 
  12 mil dead in stalin 's purges ? 
  where the fuck did you got this number ? 
  no , they are not . 
  they are similar , but they are different languages . 
  many words are completely different , some rules are different too . 
  ukrainian and russian may be more similar than , say , english and dutch , but not by much . 
  so , this time they do n't even bother with usual unintelligible satellite photos ? 
  62 % lexical similarity is even lower than i 've expected . 
  some degree of intelligibility remains because of closer grammar rules and writing system , but that 's it . 
  it may be not hard to switch when you know both languages , but you still need to actually learn ukrainian . 
   perhaps op isnt aware that even two rt journalists resigned ( within 2 weeks of each other ) live on air because of the absolute lies that rt insists on spreading ? 
  it is interesting that in both cases there were presented no examples of such ` lies ' . 
  what can be easier than to say something like `` i 'm resigning because they wanted me to told * this * and * this * , which would be a lie because * this * '' ? 
  but no , there were no examples . 
  and i can explain why . 
  there was another similar case , not on air , but still . 
  [ here it is . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jul/18/mh17-russia-today-reporter-resigns-sara-firth-kremlin-malaysia ) what we see here ? 
  a journo resigns because she was prohibited to report that mh17 was `` shot down by a suspected russian-made missile '' like `` most media organisations have said '' . 
  i must remind you that `` most media organisations '' reported that literally hours after the crash . 
  it was very well put by rt itself : `` we believe that the truth is what our reporters see on the ground , with their own eyes and not what 's printed in the morning london newspaper . '', 
  blah blah blah . 
  where are examples of `` being white washed '' or `` different versions of the truth '' ? 
  where are examples of `` made up stories '' ? 
  without facts , your words , and words of those ~ ~ drama queens ~ ~ resigned journos are worthless . 
   so the evidence, 
  sorry , what ? 
  you provided no facts , and still speak of evidence ? 
   i wont be replying again as ive made my point . 
  you understand that your position is weak and your words hold no truth , so you chose an easy exit . 
  baseless accusations about `` russian-made missile '' or `` russian-provided sam system '' or `` putin 's missile that killed hundreds '' instead of actual honest reporting on * facts * ca n't be better than anything . 
  it is not reporting , it is propaganda . 
   the news i saw made references to rebels bragging about shooting down the plane on social media, 
  to be more precise , rebels ` leader ' , strelkov . 
  yes , they made references , they just forgot to report one small fact : strelkov previously ( about a month before incidend ) told that he does not own any social media account . 
  so , media made references to social media account run by uknown persons , and this is evidence because ... ? 
  because it fits in your world view ? 
  i see no other reason . 
   russian government still peddling ukraine jet bullshit, 
  ` russian government ' ? 
   so ... you think it is a coincidence of bragging about a plane being shot down when the only plane that is shot down is mh17 ? 
  no , of course not . 
  and it was explained by owners of cited social media account , only the explanation was never reported . 
  locals saw a plane crash , assumed that it was ukrainian army transport like those that were shot down previously , and that got into social media . 
  rebels did have an official web page , why it was n't in news instead of some social media ? 
  because it does n't fit in the story , that 's why . 
   and let 's forget that there are no rebel planes to shoot down so ukraine has zero reason to be shooting down anything from the sky, 
  yeah , except ukraine army said before the catastrophe that any military plane or heli coming from russia [ will be shot ] ( http://euroradio.fm/ru/ukraincy-ugrozhayut-chto-budut-sbivat-rossiyskie-samolety-i-vertolety ) . 
  obviously there is no reason whatsoever to deploy sam systems after such statements , am i right ? 
   let 's also forget that it happened over territory that was occupied by rebels . 
  yeah , so ? 
  buk-1m has about 35km effective distance . 
   let 's also conveniently forget that rebels did a nice job of respecting bodies by stealing from the dead to add insult/disrespect to tragedy . 
  except that was outright lie invented by ukraine and spread by totally unbiased and independent western media . 
  ( to be fair , not all western media fell so low , [ some still hold their standards . 
  ] ( http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-07-21/flight-mh17-victims-bodies-were-looted-or-maybe-not ) ), 
   they are censored and directed by russian government . 
  you are incorrect , they are literally putin who in turn is literally hitler . 
  every rt journalist is mind-controlled directly from moscow . 
   there were reporters on the scene that saw emptied purses and wallets etc. 
  `` foreign media picked up the thread . 
  the wire 's item , headlined `` looters stole cash , credit cards , and jewelry from flight mh17 crash victims , '' quoted gerashchenko along with a second-hand account `` from a photojournalist at the site '' and a story in the new york daily news . 
  that story , in turn , cited a usa today story written by a reporter at the site . 
  ** the usa today article , the only first-hand report in this chain of insinuation , did n't claim that bodies had been looted . 
  in fact , it described `` credit cards and photographs carefully lined up next to each other on the wet grass . 
   ukrainian military is far more professional than rebels and would have no reason to shoot down an airliner . 
  first , the statement about ukrainian military 's professionalism is questionable at best . 
  uneducated conscripts vs battle-hardened ex-soviet military afganistan veterans and ex-berkut special forces ? 
  second , this ` far more professional army ' already has history of shooting down an airliner without any reason .
