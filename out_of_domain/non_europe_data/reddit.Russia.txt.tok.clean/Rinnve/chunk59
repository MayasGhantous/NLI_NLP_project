  this nonsense conspiracy of a ukraine fighter jet gunning it down up close is absurd . 
  so let me rephrase it . 
  investigators tell that they do n't know yet what exactly happened , they figured out two versions ( plane malfunction and onboard explosion ) but two versions remain ( ground-to-air and air-to-air missile ) . 
  how comes that not figuring out a2a theory is ` being diplomatic ' ? 
  how comes that the investigators do n't know , yet everybody else already knows ? 
  may be you should share your information with those sorry ignorant investigators ? 
   ukraine would be in such a heap of shit if they shot down that plane . 
  the whole world would turn on it . 
  yes , of course . 
  unless it will be swept under the rug with the help of other interested parties . 
  after all , they was n't ` in a heap of shit ' after 1812 incident , why should they be this time ? 
   he actually any good at judo, 
  putin got his black belt long before he became president . 
  he became `` master of sport '' ( soviet title ) in sambo in 1973 and in judo in 1975 . 
  nowhere in this video it shows that those guys are military . 
  that is assuming the video is n't fake . 
  `` a programming club '' is too weak a definition . 
  you must clarify what do you want to do . 
  introduce people to programming ? 
  that 's fine , plan basic teaching course using your preferred language ( i 'd suggest python , there are great courses ready in teh internetz ) . 
  unite guys who already know something about coding ? 
  that 's fine too , but if you define it too broad ( like , i dunno , something in line with ` come around anybody who knows coding ' ) , this thing is n't going to fly . 
  my bet would be ( 1 ) web development ( html5/css + javascript + some server-side tech like ror or asp.net ) , ( 2 ) mobile development ( basics of ios/android/wp development , probably using html5 ) , ( 3 ) game development for ( 3a ) mobile ( see ( 2 ) ) or ( 3b ) desktop ( using some free engine like unity ) . 
  ( possible ( 3c ) games for consoles is too complicated for a high school club ) . 
  i 'd advice against choosing one direction and sticking with it , though , choose a general direction and just let it grow for a while . 
  you 'll see what is interesting for most people and what is n't , push gently in that direction ( s ) . 
  nope . 
  us said that they have the data , but it can not be published because reasons . 
  sorry , i was on mobile and replied to wrong message . 
  what a load of bull . 
  i did n't checked other parts of your code , but your implementation of printstring is wrong . 
  what this part of code is supposed to do ? 
  if ( j < counter ), 
  std : : cout < < ' \\ 0 ' ;, 
  also , for c-style string the buffer must be always size +1 bytes to hold stop byte ( zero ) . 
  it 's russian thing . 
  your usual smile with teeth is often considered a bit too big there . 
  ah , you can always count on a pole to be butthurt about russia . 
  nah , not really . 
  just different standards . 
  null terminator is for storage only . 
  you should n't print it . 
  people are dying there because kiev decided that only they have the right to self-determination . 
  had they tried to argue with federalists in novorossia ? 
  nope , kiev started military operation . 
  they are trying to scare the population to submission . 
  russia has nothing to do with kiev 's decisions . 
   democratic means, 
   just because you do n't like the current government does n't mean you get to decide the fate of your nations borders . 
  sorry dude , you ca n't into democracy . 
  [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/domesticated_silver_fox ) may be interesting for you . 
   thats actually a very good article . 
  that 's actually a very bad article , starting from the very first sentence . 
  i myself grew up in the soviet union , and i do n't remember * anybody * hating usa . 
  there was a certain degree of dislike for their wrong ways , but * hate * ? 
  nope . 
  not even in soviet propaganda ( well , unless you equal america with american oligarchs ) . 
  and when the article moves to the main part , why the hell choose pravda of all things ? 
  somebody 's stuck in last century . 
  current pravda is long since irrelevant , nobody 's reading it except old farts . 
  how about taking into consideration my * arguments * ? 
  the author pretends that pravda is something relevant , something that can give accurate image of russian media space . 
  this is just untrue . 
  it 's like taking fox news as something that can give accurate image of usa 's media space . 
  what is actually interesting in this report ( at least for me ) , is that there is non-zero number of slaves in scandinavian countries . 
  and iceland ? 
  23 slaves , as if they know exact number . 
  but if they know exact number ... 
  i 'm pretty sure slavery is illegal in iceland , what is being done about that ? 
   all sorts of other fables that were shot down ( no pun intended ) by the preliminary findings . 
  the investigators had four major versions : internal explosion ( on-board bomb ) , aircraft malfunction , surface-to-air missile and attack by another aircraft . 
  [ only two versions were figured out by the investigators yet , ` fighter jet ' version still holds , although it 's considered less likely . 
  ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/mh17-ermittler-westerbeke-ueber-den-absturz-in-der-ukraine-a-999193.html ) so i do n't quite understand what the fuck are you talking about . 
  yeah , they did reported it ` look , that 's * something that looks like satellite photo * ' . 
  they never reported it as a fact . 
   they want to be part of the federation anyways, 
  they do n't , actually . 
  that 's how much you know about the situation . 
  yeah , except it was n't twitter but vk , and not rebels but their fanboys , that pissed their pants after some local told them that another plane went down . 
  so , you 're almost correct . 
   the part where people in the area you grew up, 
  i was n't talking about any ` area ' . 
  i was talking about all people known to me directly and indirectly , including through media of all sorts , and about soviet propaganda too . 
   or perhaps where you attack one of the choices of media ignoring the fact he was clear that it was only a small part of the wide number of sources he watched ? 
  `` one of the choices '' ? 
  pravda is the only newspaper he mentions , 1st channel was the only tv channel he watched . 
  that 's very far from being wide . 
   you completely ignored his wider points about the lack of freedom in russia 's media or the wider issues with putins actions and leadership . 
  you mean , his attempts at propaganda ? 
  yes , that i did at first . 
  [ see below .

  key phrases :, 
  `` allegedly made by foreign spy satellite '', 
  `` in august russian union of engineers had published a report [ on mh17 ] '' , later this ` union ' is referenced as ` experts ' . 
  `` we analyzed that photo and did n't found any signs of forgery '' , said ivan andrievsky , vice-president of russian union of engineers . 
  it 's not some unnamed ` experts ' , it 's real man whom you can ask real questions . 
  so , let me sum it up : rue makes a report on mh17 , later receives ( or forges ) that photo , channel 1 report facts about that * in an opinion piece * ( not even actual news reporting ) . 
   it was their whole reason for rebelling !, 
  no , it was n't .
