  could you please provide the source for that ? 
  in eve , you do n't work towards the current endgame . 
  you 're living an alternate life of an immortal space being , and you have many options of how to do it to your liking . 
  in the process , you will make some friends and enemies , and the most fun thing is that they 're also living that double life , and it 's global . 
  having one huge world is really a game changer , and having harsh punishing ( but also rewarding ) mechanics is making it even better . 
  1998 situation was much worse . 
  still survived it , will survive this too . 
  sanctions = / = oil price, 
   and yet the education system is getting worse , and health care is getting worse . 
  but are they ? 
  what are the numbers ? 
  but that question is kind of , ah , awkward . 
  too personal . 
  if you 're interested in a general direction , not an exact address , it would be better to ast '' \u0422\u044b \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0443\u0434\u0430 ? '', 
  '' , the difference is so slight i ca n't even explain it properly , but the former order feels more natural to me ) . 
  a bit more formal and totally acceptable in any circumstances would be '' \u041e\u0442\u043a\u0443\u0434\u0430 \u0442\u044b \u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043c ? '', 
  '' ; if you ca n't grasp the difference between '' \u0442\u044b '' and '' \u0432\u044b '' , that 's completely different topic ) . 
   does anybody here know good mythical morning ? 
  well , i do now , thanks by the way , 
  i 'm not a youtube lurker , so i have n't heard of something like that in russian . 
  there are quite popular `` review '' channels though ( think `` ray johnson '' ) , like http://100500.tv/ or http://www.youtube.com/user/thisishorosho, 
  backup scanner . 
  not that it is something needed , i 've never felt the need for one , yet . 
  considering that i often wonder deep into wholes though , an outside scanner is a boon . 
  yeah , i tend to agree with that . 
  may be , although i do n't know personally anybody who is `` getting angry '' . 
  most people realise that the current slide is mostly because of oil prices and russia 's dependence on oil exports . 
  it is kind of hard to be angry at economics . 
  unlikely . 
  i like how you forgot about russian and kazakh farmers ( and other ethnicities too , of course ) , to whom stalin did exactly the same . 
  kind of ruins the anti-russian message here when you learn that about 2 million russians and 1 million kazakhs died in the holodomor too . 
  also , what about thousands tons of food and grain that was sent to starving regions by central government ? 
  [ `` however , the first food aid sent by central soviet authorities for the odessa and dnepropetrovsk regions 400 thousand poods ( 6600 tonnes , 200 thousand poods or 3300 tonnes for each ) appeared as early as february 7 , 1933 . '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/causes_of_the_holodomor#refusal_to_provide_aid_for_starving ), 
  however most russian deny or are unaware it ever happened . 
   stalin was a crime against all humanity , yet i do n't see them taking his statues down, 
  they were took down way back in the ussr during [ de-stalinization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/de-stalinization ) . 
  there are may be two or three remains in some backward corner . 
  your ignorance makes me sad . 
   it was made worse by the government as a tool to crush dissent against collectivization, 
  there are no any historical documents that prove this . 
  on the other hand , there are many proofs that the government tried their best to fight the famine . 
   they were notorious for straight lying about literally everything . 
  except they are not , if we 're talking about internal documents , not reports for people outside the system . 
  you 're arguing with the wrong person here . 
  go argue with prof. r.w. 
  davies and prof. s.g. wheatcroft . 
  please explain to them that they were very wrong when they analyzed soviet documents . 
  oh , and by the way : downvote button is n't disagree button . 
   does the construction ( i.e. 
  exactly . 
  i 'm not 100 % , but i think that it is formed by dropping a word :, 
  how many people were killed during crimean events ? 
   the average russian is n't go to see much of this money , in fact they 're suffering now, 
  suffering ? 
  what ? 
  suspected jihadists in russia can at least expect proper juridical process and have a chance of acquittal . 
  some of fancy electronics and other expensive imports , may be , but latest iphone is hardly an everyday item . 
  real everyday items are like 10-15 % more expensive tops compared to start of the year . 
  real estate did n't changed price either ( and why should it ? ), 
  so , some degree of inconvenience ? 
  certainly . 
  suffering ? 
  not so much . 
  lookie here , we found a proper lawyer how went through navalny case and proved that `` leader of the opposition '' was convicted unlawfully !, 
  care to share the information , write an article , perhaps ? 
  not where i live . 
  well , * some * prices are , some are not though . 
  well , at least we did n't killed tens of thousands civililians across the world to punish them for imaginary wmds . 
  what slaughters ? 
  you said yourself , it was punishment . 
  since it went just nice for usa , it must be a right thing to do , no ? 
   if it was so democratic why did n't they just do it without a military force ? 
  they did , in early nineties . 
  mainland ukraine said `` fuck it '' . 
  nobody outside cared about failed democracy in crimea , though . 
  sure , why not ? 
  thouhg banks often take `` tax '' for taking out cash in atms not belonging to them ; at least this is the case with russian banks . 
   branded by moscow as a nazi collaborator, 
  i like that part in particular . 
  somebody has missed his history classes . 
  and that 's relevant because ? 
   so very few reliable stores, 
  huh ? 
  since i live in a small city , i often buy stuff online , things that are not avaiable locally . 
  sure , russian post is slow as hell ( average 2 weeks from stp to michurinsk ) , but otherwise i had no problems at all . 
  ~ ~ let me guess , you 're from baltics , right ? ~ ~, 
  disregard this , i read your post history . 
  eh , your graph shows just the opposite : that their economies collectively dropped quite a bit after they `` joined the west '' , and it took more than ten years to recover . 
  if you 're going to judge entire nation by one psycho creep , the only correct response you should get is `` fuck you '' . 
  well , i think ... 
  \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435 = excuse me / sorry / forgive me ( depends on context ), 
  \u0418\u0437\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 = excuse me / * sometimes * sorry ( when apologising for something insignificant ), 
  in your usual daily use those words are virtually identical . 
  generally it is safe bet to use '' \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435 '' like `` sorry '' and '' \u0438\u0437\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 '' like `` excuse me '' . 
  i 'm sorry , but your comment do n't make any sense . 
  ~ ~ `` on december 29 , the russian government reportedly adopted an updated list of medical contraindications to driving which includes `` personality disorders '' as listed by the international classification of diseases number 10 ( icd-10 ) ** including being transgender , bigender , asexual , and cross dressing . 
  ** '' ( your link ) . ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ this is outright lie because [ the law ] ( http://government.ru/media/files/a5x9gsayrpa.pdf ) specifically ** excludes ** f50-f59 . 
  moreover , f52 ( `` sexual dysfunction , not caused by organic disorder or disease '' ) does not include `` being transgender , bigender , asexual , and cross dressing '' ( f52 .0 and f52 .1 can be called `` being asexual '' ) . ~ ~, 
  reading is hard apparently .
