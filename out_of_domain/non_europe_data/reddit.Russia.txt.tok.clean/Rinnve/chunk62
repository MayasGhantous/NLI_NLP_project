  yeah , you 're right on that , the regulation ( it is n't the law , strictly speaking , it 's '' \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0430\u043a\u0442 '' , by-law in english ) seems to be very broad and ill-conceived . 
  hopefully after getting in spot light it will be fixed . 
  superheroes or comics are n't really a part of russian culture ( except for [ \u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u043a ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%cb%f3%e1%ee%ea ) , but i guess that 's not what you 're looking for ) . 
  there are though some interesting comics in russian , i 'd recommend [ '' \u041e\u0440\u0434\u0430 '' ( the horde ) ] ( http://www.fright.com/edge/horde.htm ) by baranko , it was in english originally , but it 's very well translated to russian and actually is very russian in spirit . 
  eh , actual satanists are very respective of children as beings not yet strangled by society rules . 
  just sayin ', 
  vk is vastly more popular in russia , but odnoklassniki is even more popular , especially among 30 + people . 
  also , current facebook user interface is just horrible , both usability and aesthetics are nonexistent ( do n't know about mobile apps though ) . 
  vk is much better in that regard . 
  yeah , odnoklassniki looks awful , it also shows really annoying ads . 
  i really do n't know why it is so immensely popular among adults . 
  part paid shills and bots , part retards . 
  that 's political reddit for you . 
  it 's even more visible in / r/europe . 
  some neutral topic like `` let 's compare our idioms '' ? 
  nice , possibly quite interesting discussion . 
  politics ? 
  hurr durr system : retard mode 80 % power activate . 
  it 's quite sad , actually , because i for one ca n't even remotely see what can be done to fix it . 
  please list all prominent opposition figures , and please list what they 're charged with . 
  also please state why do you omit a visible opposition figure that is n't persecuted in any way . 
  probably it is just social thing , like why i ( or somebody else ) should use socialnetwork1 when all my buddies are in socialnetwork2 . 
  compared to other easily available on the net images of vehicles struck by grad , this bus does n't look even nearly similar : small holes , no burns . 
  my personal hypothesis is that after or during artillery strike one or two mines on the minefield near the road ( warning signs are clearly visible on many sources ) had detonated and hit the bus . 
  it literally means '' \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0435\u0432 \u041f\u043e\u0441\u0430\u0434 '' ( russian city ) , and bottom reads like '' \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441 '' ( not a russian word or name , may be a nickname or some obscure reference ) . 
  all grad warheads are quite powerful . 
  damage on the bus does n't look like what 20 kg warhead can do . 
  execution is wrong , no matter what . 
  have a downvote . 
  the driver asks `` what just happened there on the road block ? '', 
  the man outside answers something , but it 's just too unintelligible , car noise blocks it out ( may be with some audio processing it could be made better , but i personally do n't know how to do it ) . 
  he 's talking about [ original dashcam video ] ( http://youtu.be/notvmmuu71k?t=1m17s ) . 
  according to the international laws , usage of imprecise weapons in heavily populated areas is a war crime . 
  also , according to the same laws , one side of the conflict committing war crimes ( in that case firing from positions in populated areas ) does not justifies other side for committing war crimes ( using imprecise high power weapons in the general direction of the enemy hiding among civilians ) . 
  for fun ? 
  no , i do n't think so . 
  but there are multiple reports of ukrainian army shelling civilian areas with imprecise weapons ( grad , uragan etc. ), 
  which are * not * intended for use in civilian areas ; and there are multiple reports of ukrainian army shelling civilian areas * where were no enemy forces * . 
  so , at the very least they act very irresponsible . 
   there 's a very good chance that it was set off from the concussion of the grads hitting , especially if the ukrainians altered the triggering mechanism/pressure plate, 
  grad missiles fell at the distance of several hundred meters . 
  i do n't think that land mines are that easily triggered . 
  also , it is visible on the video that mine was triggered by somebody running into minefield . 
   please , tell me how this nullifies the fact that separatist rockets are landing 100 meters from civilian vehicles ? 
  it does not . 
  it nullifies the accusation of separatists actually killing civilians . 
  also , according to this video , those were not separatist rockets ( i did n't check direction myself though ) . 
  eh , human head remains consciousness for some time after beheading ( google it ) , so i would n't compare one inhumane method of dealing with undesirables with another seriously . 
  execution is evil . 
  all methods of execution are equally evil . 
  i will not discuss which is less painful , because there is no point in that . 
  know the best way to relieve suffering ? 
  * do n't execute people . 
  no , lets make life in prison reasonably acceptable . 
  many countries in the world already do this , so it 's possible . 
  execution is evil because it leaves no chance for people to overcome what they 've done . 
  and , of course , it leaves no chance to wrongly convicted . 
  i see no point in discussing different methods of execution because in the end they do the same , they end human life . 
   you 've made it clear the amount of suffering does n't matter to you, 
  by stating that instead of thinking about `` humane '' execution methods people should think about betterment of prison conditions ? 
  that 's interesting path of thinking . 
  that 's the only difference that matters in the modern world , apparently . 
  and to think that saudis are not ostracized and sanctioned to hell , but * welcomed * ... 
  it 's sickening . 
  guilty or not , execution is just plain wrong and evil . 
  if she was indeed guilty , life in prison is n't that better than death , maybe even worse , but it also gives a chance to reform , to overcome the crime , may be even do some good ( even in prison , yes ) . 
  and if she was n't guilty ... well , there is no way to unexecute her now . 
  hey , you dropped something . 
  here you are : / s, 
   murdering a child does n't deserve time behind bars . 
  why not ? 
  yeah , and an income inequality index larger than freakin corrupt oligarchic russia ( on mobile right now , google up gini index ) . 
  that massive gdp goes all way up to the rich 1 % . 
  that 's nothing to brag about . 
  that was done with definitely-not-russian armed men standing by the voting booths . 
  i 've been asking for photo proofs of this `` vote under the gunpoint '' for better half an year since , and tried to find ones myself . 
  so far , i did n't saw any gunmen that `` stood near the voting booths '' in crimea . 
  do you have any different info on that ? 
  thanks . 
  ever heard of electronic money transfer ? 
  they say it 's the shit those days . 
  visa cards or something like that . 
  russia lost about 20 millions in the wwii casualties ( military and civilian ) . 
  stalin 's purges killed about 1 million , that 's estimate on larger side . 
  [ citation needed ], 
   you 're wasting tax dollars on someone who committed a heinous crime , just end the persons life . 
  nope . 
  you 're wasting tax dollars on a slim chance that this person was wrongly convicted . 
  how many `` obvious murderers '' were found to be innocent years or decades after they were executed ? 
   is that a type of bread or a type of cake, 
  looks like rye bread to me . 
   and what kind of mushrooms are those in the last picture , if anyone knows . 
   in the usa , i bet it is less than .1 % . 
  even one man wrongly executed is one man too much . 
  that is , of course , if you see people as people , not some ... resource . 
   you 're 100 % certain, 
  there is no way to be 100 % certain . 
  yeah , and since there are many photos and videos of the voting booths in crimea * without * gunmen around , they apparently reacted to photo/video attempts by becoming invisible .
