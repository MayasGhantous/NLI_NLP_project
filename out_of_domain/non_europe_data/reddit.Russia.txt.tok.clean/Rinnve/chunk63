  so , stalin `` starves ukraine to death '' , but then bandera thugs horribly execute * poles * and * jews * * civilians * . 
  that you 're calling a nasty way to wage a war ? 
  war against whom ? 
  could you provide some examples , please ? 
  last time i checked it is still a war crime to use imprecise high power weapons ( like , you know , grad ) against civilian territories . 
  yes , even if the enemy is hiding right there . 
  i do n't think that 's really comparable . 
   it was not the ukraine that started this . 
  i do n't agree with that , but it 's not really important . 
  international war laws do n't care about who started what , they only care about actions . 
  ukrainian methods are wrong . 
  may be separatist methods are wrong too , but that does n't make ukrainian government less guilty . 
   the area was peaceful before the shelling , little reason for the rebels to start, 
  there are some sources that state it was n't rebels who shelled it . 
  there are n't any trustful sources yet though , so i see little point in discussing this , for now . 
  may be , but [ usa was successful in that .

  since when spotify became free ? 
  last time i checked it still wants money for decent quality sound . 
   that 's why they turned it into a `` with us or against us '' thing in the negotiations with the previous president . 
  it was eu , actually , who turned down the very idea of trilateral discussion . 
  it is very amusing to observe history being rewritten almost immediately after it happens . 
   simple tasks, 
   recognizing people 's faces, 
  choose one . 
  opencv is drowning you in complexness because computer vision is very complex itself . 
  perhaps start with a book on opencv or an online course ? 
  lineage ii elven village theme iirc . 
   do n't expect to see your kids taught in russian unless it 's a private school, 
  if there is a significant minority that pays taxes , why not ? 
  and there are examples of that working just fine . 
  finns teach their kids swedish for their sweden minority , russians teach various local minority languages in regions where said minorities live , etc. 
   they are trying to slowly undo the damage done, 
  actually , they are pushing for ukrainization of historically russian-speaking regions . 
  eastern ukraine and crimea where never `` russified '' , they were russian from the start . 
  that 's basically the same policy that ( as you say ) russia had . 
   google already said `` fuck it '', 
  except they did n't . 
  they closed development office , yes , but it is unrelated to that law : earlier they also closed development offices in sweden , finland and norway . 
   what the fuck is '' personal data '', 
  it is generally a good idea to read the law before discussing it . 
   i 'd say nearly half of the hackers and cyber criminals originate in russia . 
  and , of course , you can back this statement with some , i dunno , * facts * ? 
   um , that means they want to be part of russia . 
  except they do n't . 
  federalisation , autonomy or sovereignty ? 
  yes , and they do have their own reasons for that . 
  but i do n't remember a single word about novorossia joining russia . 
  when ? 
  referendum of 11.05.2014 was about independence , iirc . 
  you 're right , kind of . 
  there were not any requests to join , at least i failed to find one ( and failed to find putin `` denying their request to join '' , it would be very nice if you could provide a link to that ) ; however , there indeed where some , ah , talks about novorossia joining russia . 
  boroday , for one , did talk about that . 
  somehow i 've missed it . 
   funny how georgia bombed a militant outpost in south ossetia , a georgian territory , and hit russian troops . 
  from your source : `` a ceasefire is agreed upon and signed between the georgian government and abkhaz separatists . 
  russian peacekeeping forces are deployed to the area . '' i see nothing funny about georgia bombing peacekeeping forces . 
  op says that of all people living in estonia 25 % are russian-speaking . 
  do i understand you correctly : the only things those people are doing now is `` terrorize , kill and loot '' ? 
  as for now , putin is putting the bread on my table , figuratively speaking . 
  in the soviet union , the smell of oranges was closely associated with the celebration of new year 's eve - because that was the only chance to taste this precious fruit for us , kids . 
  our family , and families of my friends were n't even particulary poor . 
  by some magic , my father got me a bicycle . 
  i spent days and days driving it on the streets of our city ; my parents were n't particulary worried about that , though : streets were mostly empty , devoid of cars . 
  those were the eighties , last decade of the soviet union . 
  looking around me at contemporary russia , i call this article and this research complete and utter bullshit . 
  who cares about the elite with their fancy cars , dachas and what not ? 
  ordinary people are better off now , way better . 
  between first and second chechen wars chechnya was de-facto independent . 
  it became terrorist training ground , and main businesses there were slave trade and kidnapping ; basically they became what isis is now . 
  when they went overhead by kidnapping major russian official and attacking dagestan , started second chechen war . 
  also , there are many ethnicities in russia besides russians . 
  for example , i do n't think a tatar or bashkir would be very happy if you call him a russian . 
  actually , some pages of archive.org were blocked a while ago . 
  if any of those guys becomes extremely unlucky during assault on debaltsevo , then it 's volunteer who became unlucky , totally not related to their former military unit . '' - translation mine ; i 'm no translator , but i did my best to keep the message intact ), 
  also the article says : `` the author of the report , ilya barabanov , also said that he spoke with a russian soldier on the ground in east ukraine , who claimed that his superiors predicted that russia would go to war with ukraine eventually . '' original article ( link above ) says nothing about that . 
  edit : possibly incorrect translation about `` reports of dismissal '' ; originally it means that they 've quit their army jobs , or at least i understood it so . 
   but you knew that of course, 
  actually , i did n't . 
  thanks for correction . 
  yeah , it was unblocked like after a day or two . 
  could you elaborate that , please ? 
  aaand you 're delivering the sources behind your statements any second now . 
  [ what were you telling about inflation ?

  uh , there are some dating sites , like missingheart.ru or damochka.ru , but nothing like tinder i think . 
  ( on the side note , i really do n't get this mobile-only approach of tinder ; i mean , what 's the point of not having web-based option ? ), 
  edit : actually , tinder works in russia and it 's official android app is translated to russian ( ios , on the other hand , does n't show it in app store for some reason on my ipad ) . 
   meanwhile most americans do n't even realize they are being hated so much and do n't really care about russia one way or the other . 
  [ i would n't be so sure about that .

  you should write an address in english , like this :, 
  123456 tambov oblast , morshansk , sovetskaya str. , 10-30, 
  as for machete , that 's a tricky question . 
  depends on delivery company . 
  i 've ordered knives several times , but from other cities within russia ; russian post delivers just fine , but only if the knife is certified as an utility knife ( '' \u043d\u043e\u0436 \u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e-\u0431\u044b\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f , \u043d\u0435 \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0439\u0441\u044f \u0445\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0435\u043c '' , a knife that does n't fall under the definition of cold weapon in russian law ) . 
  as far as i know , amazon uses dhl for deliveries in russia , you should ask them before ordering . 
   shock therapy worked perfectly in the rest of the warsaw pact . 
  yes , because it was implemented there properly . 
  it was n't done so in russia , in no small part thanks to the west .
