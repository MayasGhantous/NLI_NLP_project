  a traitor , from fsb point of view . 
  i 'm not saying that it is good to kill traitors without proper trial , but this death is perfectly explainable without any putin involved : an intelligence agency dealing with a traitor ( litvinenko was working with mi6 ) . 
  again , not a politician , hence , not a political opponent . 
  yes , he allegedly exposed massive corruption . 
  no , it was not related to putin . 
  and , of course , not a political opponent . 
  `` had represented [ ... ] anti-chechen-war dissidents . 
  a russian nationalist extremist was sentenced to life in prison for the killings . '' now linking * that * murder to putin is like linking breivik 's massacre to norvegian ~ ~ president ~ ~ pm or whoever governs them . 
  it 's outright retarded . 
  chechen human right activist , kidnapped in chechnya , executed in chechnya by chechens , allegedly kadyrov 's thugs . 
  how 's that related to putin ? 
  chechnya is still largely medieval , blood feuds are still a thing there . 
  oh , and almost forgot : not a political opponent to putin . 
  devotchenko . 
  `` they found he cut his hand and hit his head after drinking too much , and bled out '' . 
  is there a reason to link this death to putin , besides severe retardation ? 
  one * could * call nemtsov a political opponent , yes , but nobody from this list was a politician and a political opponent to putin . 
  so i 'm still waiting for the `` long list of putin 's political opponents he ordered to kill '' . 
  and also please explain how comes that one of the most visible and vocal opposition leaders , navalny , is alive and well . 
   change in power or organizational structures, 
  there was almost no change in power or organizational structures in ukraine . 
  revolution changes all power structures , or at least significant parts . 
  there were calls for that , for `` lustration '' , but those calls were , of course , ignored by `` new '' government . 
  same here : https://yadi.sk/i/aalihcwyf5yna ( `` site blah-blah-blah can threaten the security of your computer , its pages most probably contain malicious code andr/spyagent-t . '' ), 
  most people in russia are smart enough to differentiate the country ( people ) and its government . 
   it was a revolution, 
  it was n't . 
  by definition : [ `` a revolution ( from the latin revolutio , `` a turn around '' ) is a fundamental change in power or organizational structures that takes place in a relatively short period of time . '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolution ) . 
  as far as i know , nothing fundamental was changed in ukraine after maidan . 
  coup , on the other hand : [ `` ... is the sudden and illegal seizure of a government , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] usually instigated by a small group of the existing state establishment to depose the established government and replace it with a new ruling body . '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coup_d%27\u00e9tat ) sounds pretty much like what happened in ukraine , does n't it ? 
   besides a total government collapse, 
  it was n't total . 
  far from it . 
   punish the organizations, 
  how exactly listing an organization in the `` foreign agents '' list is punishing ? 
   like how those organizations labeled as foreign agents can be treated ? 
  care to elaborate , with some examples ? 
  i have to ask because , according to the law , not much can be done to the organizations in the foreign agent list . 
  unless , of course , they fail or refuse to follow the law ( which many did ) . 
   the ussr was a multi-ethnic empire . 
  putin wants to build a russian empire, 
  let me ask you , how many ethnicities and official languages are in russia ? 
   do these exist in higher res ? 
  i want to hang them in my office :-), 
  yes , the author [ sells them . 
  ] ( https://prime.500px.com/photos/81031539/-by-elena-shumilova ), 
   additional mandatory audits and additional powers to the government to suspend you, 
  ... that are limited and regulated by the law ... 
   the label is used as justification for searches and general harassment, 
  ... and the article for some reason does n't mention if raided ngos failed to comply to the law ( i do n't know if they did , actually , but most probably they did : the law was demonstratively ignored by most ngos ) . 
   the us embassy in moscow said via its twitter feed : `` it is with great concern that we are following reports of unprecedented inspections of ngos across russia . '', 
  oh sweet , sweet [ hypocrisy ] ( http://www.fara.gov ) . 
  and yet nobody had a camera to photograph massive smoke trail that [ buk missile produces ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgxpa3ubkwq ) . 
  in xxi century , where cameraphones are literally everywhere . 
   the zones of thought books ( a fire upon the deep / a deepness in the sky / the children of the sky ) by vernor vinge, 
  ftfy . 
  it 's three-book series now . 
  ( i have n't read `` the children '' yet , though . ), 
  what the hell ? 
  the video they say is `` the same '' shows putin and lebedev in entirely different room , with different walls , different table etc. 
  is it another case of `` white and gold/blue and black dress '' , when some see room with dark walls , while others see light-colored walls ? 
   page not found, 
  wrong link ? 
   culturally not that far from chechen, 
  you 're wrong on that one . 
  georgians are probably much closer to russians than to chechens , starting with traditional religion ( orthodox christianity ) . 
  `` the company 's press office in russia stressed that ikea had not received any official warnings in russia related to the `` gay propaganda '' law , the afp news agency reports . '', 
   but there 's a law that police can detain you up to 24 hours to check your identity if you are paperless, 
  only in the case of administrative or criminal offence . 
  policemen sometimes abuse lack of knowledge of the laws , though . 
  did you even read the law ? 
  bbc outright lies on that one . 
  the law is not about `` providing information about homosexuality to people under 18 '' , you know , it is more specific . 
   was forced, 
  [ citation needed ], 
  i do n't like assumptions and speculations . 
  do you * know * that they were forced , or it 's just your assumption ? 
   nobody was trying to take sevastopol away from russian navy use, 
  yatsenyuk 's position on sevastopol [ was pretty clear ] ( http://novocrimea.ru/sevas/404197.html ) : `` russian fleet has no place in sevastopol '' . 
   `` the atmosphere right now in ~ ~ our country ~ ~ moscow is very dangerous , very threatening , '', 
  if you phrase it this way , well , may be yes , may be no ; nobody here in tambov region gives a shit about what 's happening in moscow . 
  as they say , `` there are two russias : one inside and one outside the mkad '' ( mkad - russian name for moscow ring road ) . 
  basically the first relevant google search result on '' \u042f\u0446\u0435\u043d\u044e\u043a \u0421\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c '' . 
  [ here ] ( http://pol-video.ru/c--z6mf-la4/yatsenyuk_v_sevastopole_nechego_delat_russkim_voennym.html ) is the video where he says it , and [ here ] ( http://rian.com.ua/politics/20130728/338108109.html ) is a better source . 
   as far as i understood , russia had a 30 year lease on the base . 
  yes , and yatsenyuk was against it . 
  if russia did n't act in crimea , most probably that lease would be deemed unlawful because , you know , `` yanukovich was putin 's puppet '' or something like that . 
  there are no `` true '' crimeans . 
  crimean tatars conquered this land just a couple centuries before russian empire had to deal with their constant slave raids . 
  and before that crimea was conquered by ( surprise surprise ) kievan rus , who then lost it due to mongol invasion . 
  speaking of more modern times , crimean tatars were about 30 % of crimea 's population in late xix century , well before stalin . 
  tl ; dr : if you own an apartment for a certain period ( was 3 years , now 5 years ) , no tax at all , otherwise 13 % tax . 
  [ but that 's only for tax residents , for non-residents its 30 % . 
   according to constitution the status of crimea can only be decided by a ukraine-wide referendum . 
  yes , according to ukrainian constitution that was forced upon crimea . 
  when crimea tried to uphold its autonomy in early nineties , ukraine basically went `` fuck that '' , illegally scrapped crimean constitution and removed crimean president . 
  and because the government need this land , fuck people who live there , right ? 
  by that logic , you can no longer take crimea from russia , because russia already invested a shit ton of money . 
  thing is , nobody cared about international laws , democracy and what not when ukraine annexed crimea in nineties . 
  nobody cared about creeping ukrainization of historically russian-speaking region , because , you know , it 's only bad when russian language is forced upon people .
