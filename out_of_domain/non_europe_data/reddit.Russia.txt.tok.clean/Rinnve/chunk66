  why people suddenly started to care ? 
  because this time not ukraine , but russia did a move ? 
   actually all rusia did now was steal gold from ukrainian banks on that territory , resell property owned in crime by ukrainians to russians , steal military equipment etc. 
  aaand we 're seeing proofs any second now . 
   nobody asked her to `` invest money '', 
  nobody asked ukraine too . 
   since never even for a second was crimea legally a part of russia, 
  since ukraine did n't cared about any laws in the nineties , i do n't see why should russia care about anything except the will of the people . 
   ukraine gave the status of an autonomous region to crimea in 1991 , and then revised that to not have a seperate president there in 1994 . 
  you say it `` annexed '' crimea as if it was a separate country before that . 
  ukraine , as a part of ussr , was in no position to give anything . 
  according to ussr laws , there was a possibility for an ssr to secede after referendum , but with one note : any autonomous region within that ssr should have their own referendum on their own status ( including complete independence from seceding ssr ) . 
  that referendum was held in crimea , and ukraine illegally ( you seem to like this word , do n't you ? ), 
  ignored it . 
  ukraine also besieged and then land-grabbed sevastopol , a city of state importance which in ussr never answered to ukraine , being under direct control of moscow . 
  ukraine then claimed their right for many battleships stationed there , selling them for scrap metal . 
  i 'd call that annexation . 
   in 1991 ukraine wasnt part of ussr anymore . 
  and that gives it right to force its will upon crimea and crimea 's people ? 
  just imagine that you woke up one day , and your home is suddenly in a different state now , and nobody 's asking your opinion on it . 
  and when you voice your opinion , the new state basically says `` fuck your opinion and your democracy '' . 
  do n't know about you , but i would 've been seriously pissed about something like that . 
   a constitution is a fundemental law , not ad-hoc referendums, 
  crimea had their constitution . 
  when it was deemed as inconvenient , it was just scrapped away by ukraine . 
  not so fundamental after all . 
  [ something something international laws . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-determination ) if it was legal enough for kosovo , it is legal enough for crimea . 
   crimea still has its constitution, 
  yep , changed by ukraine without asking crimea . 
  new constitution made crimea autonomous only on paper . 
   to make crimea a separate state would require an amendment to that constitution , which is indeed only possible with a referendum , but there referendum can not just be had ad-hoc , there is a complex procedure on how it has to be held and who has to monitor it . 
  there is also a procedure on how to replace the president of ukraine , and it was not followed . 
  why should crimea follow ukraine 's constitution when ukraine itself fails to do it ? 
  first , `` 15 % '' [ is a myth ] ( http://humanrightsinvestigations.org/2014/05/06/the-crimea-referendum-15-percent-for-myth/ ) . 
  second , there were no soldiers at the voting booths . 
  this is another myth . 
  and it is legal for crimea because the president crimeans ( among other eastern ukrainians ) democratically voted for was illegally ousted by a coup , and because mainland ukraine has a history of illegally forcing its will upon crimea to the point of sending ~ ~ neo-nazi ~ ~ far-right nationalist thugs and army . 
  you forgot to mention that this democratically elected parliament was encircled by not-so-democratic armed thugs , and that legal procedure was * not * followed . 
   old constitution was also placed there by ukraine . 
  just so you know . 
  i giveth , and i taketh away ? 
  by that logic , russia taking away crimea is perfectly okay . 
   first he fled himself, 
  yes , he fled to save his life because of coup , so ? 
   parlament voted for his impeachment, 
  without following the legal procedure . 
  so , nope , not legal . 
   syop watching russian tv, 
  i do n't watch tv , russian or otherwise . 
   so just like in crimean parliament when armed terrorist occupied it , and forced people to vote on referendum , and legal procedure was not followed . 
  yes , you are correct on that one . 
  however , crimean events happened after the coup in kiev , and because of it . 
  symmetric response . 
   yeah and we know that because russia was counting the votes . 
  no , we know that because of numerous independent polls . 
  [ well done . 
  ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/orson_wells_slow-clap.gif ), 
   you forget about the huge population of crimean tatars living there , which are actually aboriginal to the territory . 
  they are not . 
  they conquered crimea just a couple centuries before russian empire reconquered it . 
  got 4 % support when ukraine was stable and the president crimeans voted for was n't ousted by a coup . 
  reconquered as in `` conquered after another entity conquered it '' . 
  there was also [ tmutarakan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tmutarakan ) . 
  grand duchy of moscow existed since xiii century , and is direct successor to rurik 's dinasty of kievan rus which existed since iirc ix century . 
   if it 's such a `` direct successor '' why did n't it remain in kyiv then ? 
  because of mongolian threat , of course . 
   what it actually is is just another case of `` separatism '' that now wants to cash in on it ; s parent name . 
  you obviously have no clue about medieval politics , yet still discuss it . 
  this is sad . 
   and 21-13 = 8 centuries , it is n't that much more than the time crimea was tatars, 
  that does not changes the fact that crimean tatars are anything but `` aborigenial '' to that territory . 
   lol , who are aboriginal then ? 
  no one , of course . 
  crimea was conquered , and conquered , and conquered again in different times by different nations . 
  may be tauri can be called aboriginal to crimea , but they are long since extinct . 
  that does n't mean that crimean tatars have no place in crimea , of course . 
  crimea was and is home to many ethnicities . 
  but that does mean that crimean tatars do n't have any `` special '' rights as `` aboriginal people '' . 
   that 's how `` democracy '' works, 
  ftfy . 
  except may be small countries like switzerland . 
  well , unless you 're a former fsb agent defected to nato country to work with this country 's intelligence service , i 'd think you have nothing to worry about . 
  eh , there is nothing `` ai '' about that design . 
  i 've read that as a stupid pre-programmed machine carrying out some battle plan on and on and on , bombing the same areas without realising that any signs of human life are long since gone . 
   i blurred the same image with each setting ( making sure to quit photoshop after changing the setting each time to make sure the setting is applied properly ) and the two images are identical . 
  i do n't get it . 
  older photoshop versions used `` incorrect '' color blending when this setting is n't checked . 
  gimp and paint.net still use `` incorrect '' color blending . 
  [ here ] ( https://yadi.sk/i/r5pxfd5efqkcd ) you can see it : top part was blurred in latest photoshop cc , bottom in paint.net , both using gaussian blur , 50px radius . 
  update : and [ here ] ( https://yadi.sk/i/o-vbsv5ufqkwa ) you can see what photoshop does in 32-bit mode . 
  imho that 's the best result . 
  unfortunately , i 'm photoshop newbie and do n't know how to convert it back to 8-bit correctly , so i just made a screenshot . 
  update 2 : apparently photoshop just uses different blur algorithm . 
  the checkbox in question affects only painting tools like brush . 
  to make `` correct '' blur or image resize ( or any other full-image operation ) , [ you must convert image to a color space with 1.0 gamma ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/2zqglp/computer_color_is_broken_and_the_way_to_fix_it/cplidt7 ) . 
  here is how i write my address ( name and address are changed of course ) :,
