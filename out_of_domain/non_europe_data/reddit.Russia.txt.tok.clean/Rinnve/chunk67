   russians simply do n't go to church at all, 
  it is extremely amusing to read things russians do and do n't , especially from those who know jack shit about russians . 
  why are you spreading bullshit then ? 
  photoshop out big reflection with table texture and highlight pattern this complex ? 
  nope , not gon na fly . 
  angles can be manipulated , but this particular angle inpic 6 with a blurred reflection of the opposite wall but without any hint of the photographer or the camera just is n't possible . 
  laws of optics are pretty simple . 
  edit : a redditor in another thread pointed that all safety belts are identical . 
  it is very visible in pic . 
  those are not your observations , those are baseless generalisations . 
  '' ** i ** do n't see many russians ** around me ** going to church '' - that would be your opinion . 
  `` russians simply do n't go to church at all '' - that 's baseless generalisation , unless , of course , it is based on statistics ( which then should be linked ) . 
  so , it 's not a prosecution when it 's carried out by private entity and not the government itself ? 
  because , you know , losing a job over beliefs or a political stance looks helluva lot like a prosecution . 
  ( and please , do n't reduce freedom of speech to hate speech . 
  there is a difference between saying , i dunno , `` gays should have rights '' or `` crimean referendum was legitimate '' , and dumb hate speech that contains no message except , well , hate . ), 
   do you really think that they should be legally protected from being fired by the employer ? 
  yes . 
  this is a complex problem , but basically there are two choices : 1 ) all kinds of speech are protected , except may be * obvious * hate speech/insults ; 2 ) no speech is protected , and in that case there is no free speech any more . 
   stalin murdered around 40 million people, 
  it was 40 trillion , actually . 
  stalin was brutal , yes , but 40 million ? 
  really ? 
  that 's not even funny . 
  you 're focusing on wrong things . 
  camera with its settings is just a tool . 
  benefit of a dslr camera is not that it has a lot of settings to fiddle with , it 's that all those settings make it simpler to achieve your goal . 
  there are no right or wrong modes as long as they are useful . 
  `` one of the girls in our group had a strong background in painting and that was about it . 
  she would ask questions like what is an f-stop , or what do you mean wide angle lens ? 
  we all thought her photos would turn out poorly done and overexposed or out of focus . 
  the last night of the trip was show and tell night . 
  we all got together and showed off our past work and newly developed images from the trip . 
  everyone 's was good ; some were great . 
  for the group i was sub-par , but i was young and did n't have much time behind the lens . 
  soon it was that poor confused painter 's turn . 
  you could tell most of us in the room thought her images would be a waste of time . 
  we were wrong . 
  her photos were stunning . 
  her composition , weight and balance , use of color , line , and shape were all without match for the room . 
  the girl who knew almost nothing about cameras ( nothing about chapters 2 , 3 , & 4 ) took us all to school . 
  all she did was turn her camera dial to landscape mode for landscape and portrait mode for people . 
  for the landscape shots she used a tripod , and she used her carefully honed knowledge of composition and art ; the camera did the rest . 
  [ ... ] the girl with no clue how to use her camera had a background in painting ; she knew how to compose an image . 
  while the rest of us were taking photographs and snapshots , she was painting with light . '' ( from `` mastering digital photography '' by jason youn ), 
   45ish minute exposure, 
  that 's the problem . 
  matrix builds up static , so very long exposures are n't generally a good idea . 
  better to take several shorter exposures ( each for a minute or two , may be a bit longer or shorter , that depends on your matrix ) and then combine them in your photo editor of choice as a multiexposure . 
  having [ an intervalometer ] ( http://www.blogarithms.com/2014/08/04/sony-a7a6000-intervalometer-hack/ ) helps greatly ( so you do n't touch the camera or tripod ) . 
  one way to fix it is to repeat calculating sum of digits recursively if it 's larger than 9 . 
  in digit_sum ( ) :, 
  return total if total < 10 else digit_sum ( total ), 
  also , you should learn how to use string format method , it 's really easy , like this :, 
  print ( `` fibbonacci number { 0 } = { 1 } : the reduced number is { 2 } '' . 
  / u/trollabot rinnve, 
   for a conscript, 
  he was n't a conscript , the guardian is wrong here ( intentionally or accidentally ) . 
  original article in [ novaya gazeta ] ( http://www.novayagazeta.ru/society/67490.html ) states that after serving his duty , he signed three year army service contract in june 2014 . 
   a high-speed rail might be a better idea . 
  `` new cities and industries could be created from construction of high-speed railway and motorway routes spanning whole of country .

  cnn reporting is subpar lately . 
  late to the party , but whatever . 
  [ pretty minimal edit , and i like it a bit colder . 
  shoot in raw and correct exposition in the raw editor of your choice . 
  the dynamic range of raw is enough for about + / - 2 stop correction , and any decent raw editor allows to correct shadows/highlights selectively . 
  are you going to make very large prints ? 
  like larger than 20 `` x13 '' ? 
  if yes , i do n't believe any inexpensive ( < $ 1k ) lens has enough resolution to make razor-sharp images on that 24mp matrix . 
  if no , you 're asking the wrong question . 
  use your kit lens for starters , it 's actually quite good and zoom lenses under $ 200 are n't any better in the terms of image quality . 
  then buy the lens that adds what lacks * for you * in the 18-55 , be it longer focal length , larger aperture for low-light performance and shallow dof , or whatever . 
  well , there are : if you do n't want to post process , you 'll need fill light . 
  which kind , that depends on the situation : built-in flash , mounted flash , external flash , may be a reflector . 
  jason youn 's `` mastering digital photography '' has a nice chapter on different methods of setting up required light ( but i must warn that this is `` an overview '' kind of book , you wo n't find there deep detailed explanation or step-by-step tutorial ) . 
  if you want to play with older lenses or lenses from other systems , canon wins here because it 's possible to mount almost everything on it ( using appropriate adapter of course and in manual mode only ; exposure meter will work though ) . 
  if not , difference between those cameras is rather small , try both and buy what fits your hand better . 
  second light on the left edge seems really unnecessary to me . 
  there is a link between the central figure and the light on the right , but they are too close , i think , i 'd add some space there , may be like placing the guy on the left third vertical and the light close to the right third but not exactly on it , closer to the right edge . 
  hope that helps , you 've got a nice concept here . 
  where i live , you can go to a chain-restaurant and eat a main dish , drink , and dessert for $ 20-25 . 
  `` restaurant '' is a very broad word . 
  when russian talks about restaurant , he thinks about [ this ] ( http://yagurme.com/data/sites/1/sharedfiles/restcard/\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430_\u0411\u041e\u041d\u041e__mg_9546_1.jpg ) , not [ this ] ( http://static.ngs.ru/news/preview/f5f75810e4f3711b69f284a12c9992171f58143c_900.jpg ) . 
  if you just want to eat something , you go to '' \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f '' ( `` stolovaya '' , cafeteria ) or '' \u043a\u0430\u0444\u0435 '' ( caf\u00e9 ) . 
  standard meal there can be had for about $ 5-20 ( really depends on the city ; in my region it 's about $ 10 ) . 
  looks * very * shady to me . 
  there is no official address , no names , no info on payment and delivery options , no nothing . 
  i would n't buy anything there except may be with payment on delivery ( and i doubt this option is available there ) . 
   lot of corruption , crime , and hardship, 
  pretty much this .
