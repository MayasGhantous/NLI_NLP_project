  it was very dangerous to go out after dark , robberies and murders were pretty common , showing up in certain parts of the city was death wish . 
  tool of choice in business talks was arson , i remember one shop which was burned down almost like on the schedule . 
  my father and mother were teachers , that pretty much put us on the bottom of food chain . 
  salary was n't paid for months , though we still managed to survive somehow . 
  opportunities for money were everywhere , but most where different kinds of shady or at least involved dealing with very shady people who had money to spend . 
  my dad and i were into computers , so when it became prestigious to have a computer , we taught rich guys what to buy and how to use it . 
  your picture lacks idea . 
  what 's the main object of it ? 
  there is none . 
  i think you should read about composition , [ reddit photoclass ] ( http://www.r-photoclass.com/ ) is a great starting point . 
   living standards . 
  which basically go up each year putin is in power ( except , of course , current crisis ) . 
   after ussr baltic states have left russia , ukraine and belarus far behind . 
  [ citation needed . ], 
   when a government stops listening to the people, 
  you mean , like when yanukovich came to agreement with the opposition , a day before ultraradicals forced him out ? 
   a young moldovan woman has been living the high-life in london, 
  and that 's related to russia how , exactly ? . . 
  gdp has nothing to do with living standards . 
  at least , not directly , not even in close correlation . 
  quatar has gpd per capita ( ppp ) 5 times greater than finland , but i 'm pretty sure that between those two you 'll choose finland any day ; norway has gdp p/c twice than findland , but i very much doubt that their living standards are that diffirent . 
   baltic states have no oil and gas . 
  you know what else they do n't have ? 
  they do n't have enormous area , vast infrastructure , harsh continental climate , islamist terrorists sponsored by saudis , and ussr debts . 
  imo best edit by far . 
  very nice colors , but that slanted horizon line is oh so annoying !, 
  small hint : buy a remote . 
  it may or may not help you with this exact problem of yours ( whatever it is , where are the photos ? 
  ) , but ( a ) it is oh so much more convenient than setting up timer , and ( b ) with it you 'll be able to go longer than 30 seconds if need be . 
  there are cheap chinese ones out there , just one button but this is all that needed . 
  ( i use dicom tx 1006 with my d5100 , should work with all ir-remote capable nikons , d3200 included . ), 
  nope . 
  also , set the shutter release to series mode , this way you just press the shutter button and wait until camera stops shooting , d5100 stops automatically after each bracketing cycle . 
  stick with kit lens for a while and notice what you lack in it . 
  may be wider angle , may be larger aperture for better low light performance or dat bokeh . 
  make your decision based on those observations . 
  keep in mind that there are no universal lenses , and all lenses have some kind of a downside to them that you may or may not ignore depending on what you like to shoot . 
  modern kits are not that bad and they can get you pretty far to the point of making rational choice without wasting money on the lens you do n't really need . 
  oh , and do n't do pixel hunting , your photos will not be crystal sharp at 100 % , but with modern enormous sensors that matters only if you 're going to do large prints ( like , 50 '' wide ) . 
  really ? 
  did rt reported something not right in this video , did they `` invented '' something or `` forgot '' to mention something ? 
  it seems you forgot your links . 
  great colors . 
  however , messy lower third kind of ruins it . 
  may be crop it out ? 
  cheap dac is enough only for cheap headphones . 
  hifi dac can be pretty expensive , about $ 50 or even more . 
  most probably that 's snow illuminated by incandescent lamp . 
  it 's light is very yellow compared to whatever was used to illuminate the entire scene . 
  i 'd guess the scene is illuminated by the moon , and the lamp that is the source of yellow light is actually * inside * the house and is only seen because of very long exposure ; bright dot on the door is probably the keyhole or something like that . 
   thoughts ? 
  sorry , no thoughts . 
  too busy enjoying your photo . 
  looks very static . 
  may be consider some motion blur or less stable composition ? 
  no , technically your photo is very good , on the contrasty side of b/w , but not going overboard . 
  nice work !, 
  i especially like the b/w version , you got it just right . 
   racist implies a person hates a certain race . 
  actually , no . 
  [ `` the term `` racial discrimination '' shall mean any distinction , exclusion , restriction , or preference based on race , colour , descent , or ** national or ethnic origin ** that has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition , enjoyment or exercise , on an equal footing , of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural or any other field of public life '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/racism#definitions ), 
  nazism is short for national socialism , it 's a bit different thing . 
  `` director says '' . 
  somehow * real * [ gulag museum ] ( http://www.gmig.ru/ ) that hides nothing is alive and well . 
  you 're delusional . 
   last time i checked russians were people . 
  this guy is just an asshole who somehow got a job in space . 
  he 's saying that being an asshole is n't unknown or even rare for humans , and since russians are human ... 
  not gon na fly . 
  cheap means mass production , elbrus cpus are n't there , not even near . 
  it is good for sensitive data , but that 's it . 
  russia is very big and very diverse . 
  there is no single answer to any of your questions except may be first ( and it 's `` nope '' ) . 
  define `` best '' . 
  me , i do n't like big cities , a week in moscow was easily the worst week in my life . 
  i prefer something quiet , tambov is fine . 
  there are no big money here ( nothing on moscow scale at least ) , nothing big and important happens , it 's a bit backwards , but i like it that way . 
   evidences of crimes are removed, 
  and we know this because one pissed off guy told so ? 
   murderer is celebrated by state, 
  what . 
   owner of museum is accused of treason, 
  first , he 's not `` owner of museum '' . 
  second , he is n't `` accused of treason '' . 
  yes . 
  but it 's not really a * museum * , more like an ideological platform . 
  it is * opinionated * , and real museum ( as well as real history science ) should be neutral . 
  `` it 's the place were during soviet regime were imprisoned in hardest conditions , suffered and died dissidents , the human rights activists , opponents of the soviet regime , advocates of national independence of the oppressed peoples '' . 
  first , about `` hardest conditions '' : perm-36 was used for `` politicals '' after 1972 , well after the prime time of gulag horrors . 
  that 's why former guards who live nearby are angry , because this `` museum '' blacksmears the history , makes it even worse than it really was . 
  second , and more important : do you know who are those `` advocates of national independence of the oppressed peoples '' ? 
  [ those guys . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_insurgent_army ) and [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_poles_in_volhynia_and_eastern_galicia ) are some examples of their methods of `` advocating for national independence '' . 
  gulag was terrible horror . 
  but that does n't automatically makes innocent angels out of all the inmates , as this `` museum '' tries to paint them . 
  world of warcraft is * very * well translated , including voice acting . 
  some boss fights in pandaria i actually liked more in russian translation , for instance sha of fear : i almost crapped my pants when it yelled '' \u0411\u0415\u0413\u0418\u0418\u0418\u0418\u0422\u0415 ! '', 
  in that terribly low , almost infrasound voice . 
  \u0410\u043b\u043b\u043e\u0434\u044b \u041e\u043d\u043b\u0430\u0439\u043d was quite good during beta , but when it went the pay2win way , so i did n't follow it past that point ; they say there is now subscription option ( without p2w ) , but i do n't really know anything about it . 
  eve online is translated okay-ish ( 4/5 i 'd say ) , but many russian players prefer english interface ( more out of custom , and because of peculiar lingo of that game ) .
