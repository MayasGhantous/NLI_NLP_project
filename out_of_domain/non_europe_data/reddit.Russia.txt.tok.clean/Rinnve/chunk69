  so may be ban stalinism instead , and any cults of personality for that matter ? 
  since both are weather sealed , buy whatever system your friends have , or what better fits your hand , or flip a coin . 
  both cameras are good , both systems have nice lenses . 
  if video is important , buy canon . 
   it 's you who choses to read `` hardest it ever was in soviet history '' into that . 
  eh , i actually understood it as `` extremely hard '' , thanks for correction , my english is far from being perfect . 
  but thing is , they were n't `` extremely hard '' . 
  i mean , yes , of course , it 's a freaking labor camp after all , but this `` museum '' tried to paint it as it was something like nazi death camp !, 
   have you been there ? 
  or did tv tell you that ? 
  [ 1 ] [ 2 ] '' ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%cf%e5%f0%ec%fc-36 ) `` largest group were lithuanian , latvian , estonian ` forest brothers ' and west ukrainian resistance , so called ` banderovtsy ' '', 
   even if you disagree with the museum focusing on the gulag conditions , it 's still a gulag museum . 
  it * can be * a gulag museum . 
   i might just play \u0410\u043b\u043b\u043e\u0434\u044b for like , story and stuff , 'cause the p2w part probably starts end game/pvp right ? 
  eh , not sure about that , really . 
  there was this crazy period when not buying premium stuff made the game virtually unplayable ( like , killing one basic monster for a minute ) . 
  they tuned the balance many times since then , but i do n't know its current state . 
  worth a shot , i think , at least it 's free to try lol . 
  before i started to actually read and watch the western media , i always had thought that it is better than russian , more neutral and unbiased . 
  sadly , i was wrong . 
  that was hilarious !, 
  doubly so because of scottish accent , i always find it fascinating that english can sound so different . 
  one of my favorite comedy clips is [ eleven ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r48ka2x2rb4 ) . 
  do you know any other good comedy shows/clips about scottish or may be other english accents ? 
   do you really dislike gay people as much as our western media would have us believe ? 
  is is blown so much out of proportion it 's not even funny . 
  thanks !, 
  thank you !, 
  nongovernment censorship is still censorship . 
  imagine a government that does n't censor anybody officially ... but has a habit of making strictly unofficial private calls to certain individuals and bam !, 
  nobody hires you , nobody talks to you , nobody wants to hear you . 
  according to your logic , such situation would n't be censorship . 
  thing is , there is no way to be sure that the government is n't doing it behind the scene . 
  so unless somebody is n't talking their own ideas on behalf of the employer , firing somebody or otherwise limiting somebody 's options is certainly censorship . 
  if you do n't follow this principle , sooner or later exactly what you 're calling crazy will happen , because no government is 100 % protected from corruption . 
  except ( 1 ) it is n't closed and ( 2 ) it 's not `` the only gulag museum '' . 
  but somehow [ gulag museum in moscow ] ( http://www.gmig.ru/ ) being alive and well is n't news-worthy . 
  try to reread my message . 
  you failed to understand it . 
  hint : i 'm * not * accusing anybody of * anything * . 
   only after proof of stalin crimes were removed . 
  thus says former director of this museum . 
  there are literally no other proofs besides his own words . 
  considering that former policy of this museum was to paint [ those guys ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_insurgent_army ) as `` fighters for the freedom of enslaved nation '' , i find it hard to believe him . 
  they relocated , so ? 
   and yeah , nazi is used as a specifically derogatory term against ukrainians . 
  could you cite that , please ? 
  i failed to find where valentina called ukrainians ( in general ) `` nazi '' . 
   plus the only reason russians were there was because of ethnic cleansing . 
  have a downvote for not knowing what are you talking about . 
  because it was n't made up story ? 
  i mean , not * intentionally * made up ? 
  look at this from another viewpoint : on russian tv there were shown many reports about civilians killed in ukraine , and they were n't news-worthy enough to show on bbc or other western channel ; but the moment russian tv makes a mistake ( and i believe it was a mistake ) , they rush ahead like blood hungry sharks . 
  something to think about , eh ? 
   the shelling was confirmed by osce, 
  nope . 
  titular paragraph is about shelling of petrovsk region of donetsk ( during which allegedly 10 yo girl was killed ) . 
  second paragraph is about other shellings in other regions of donbass , and only the third paragraph is about osce mission confirming `` the shellings '' ( in general , not this specific shelling ) . 
  yes . 
  just reverse the situation : suppose your employer-to-be is backward conservative from the bible belt , and finds out that you 're an atheist and strongly pro-lgbt . 
  now find bbc ( or other western channel ) reporting about civilians killed after ukrainian army 's assaults . 
  it is always either `` civilians killed after separatists attack '' or just `` civilisans killed '' . 
  [ this blog post ] ( http://alandix.com/blog/2015/02/13/lies-damned-lies-and-the-bbc/ ) ( from your search request , btw ) is spot on . 
  windows 8 has built-in metro-style ( full-screen ) photos app [ which can open raw files and supports all basic edits . 
  ] ( http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/photos-app-faq ), 
  it matters not what she speaks , unless she speaks on behalf of her employer . 
  i told you already , reverse the situation , imagine that she posts something very progressive ( pro-lgbt , for instance ) and conservative employer wants to fire her for that . 
  i 'm pretty sure it would be called oppressive censorship the second she 's fired . 
  and if it is censorship in one case , it is censorship in another , because it 's not free speech when it 's not free in some cases . 
  even if you do n't like it . 
  * especially * if you do n't like it . 
  not being allowed to work is still punishment , milder than jail or death sentence , but punishment nevertheless . 
  and it is does n't matter who punishes , government or non-governmental structure . 
  it is still about free speech . 
  if some country does n't protect the right to speak freely without being punished * in any form * by * anyone * , then there is no true freedom of speech in said country . 
  yes , if by `` ignoring '' you mean `` not punishing in some form '' . 
  if there 's actual hate speech , there is criminal code and court . 
  besides that , people should n't get to decide what is allowed to say and what is n't . 
  if in some society it is okay to fire ( or otherwise punish ) for ugly ideas ( assuming those ideas are still legal ) , then it is okay to fire ( or otherwise punish ) for * any * ideas , because what one considers ugly , other considers beautiful or useful - but the concept of punishing for ideas , the concept of mind crime remains . 
  oh really ? 
  `` everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression ; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek , receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers . '', 
  ( article 19 of the universal declaration of human rights ) . 
  punishment for expressing an opinion certainly * is * interference , is n't it ? 
  yes , it is . 
  again , reverse the situation . 
  imagine that this team is in russia , and one of its players is very vocal pro-lgbt . 
  by your logic , it is okay that this player is fired for his views . 
  is it okay to fire people for criticizing putin ? 
   you should be free to run your company as you see fit . 
  and people should be free to express their opinions without being punished , be it execution , prison or `` merely '' employment termination . 
  i kind of agree with employer 's right to fire people for speaking on behalf of the employer . 
  but employer should n't control what people say and do outside of work . 
  and this is not some idealism , there is one practical reason for it : there is no way at all to be sure that employer fires people without being `` hinted '' by the government to do so . 
  otherwise , there would n't be real freedom of speech : sure , you 're not jailed for what you say , you 're just unable to find work and left without money . 
   do you think rt would keep someone on their staff who was bashing putin on twitter outside of work ? 
  and it makes it * right * how , exactly ? 
   the employer has absolutely no control on what she can say outside of work . 
  the only thing the employer controls is wether or not she is employed . 
  this * is * control . 
  what is the difference between not saying something because you will be jailed , and because you will be fired ?
