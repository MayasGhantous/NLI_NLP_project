  first self-loathing and now being nice to complete stranger . 
  how typical . 
  i 'm a hypocrite now ? 
  how so ? 
  i know that this video says nothing about this particular girl . 
  news reports before and after are not related . 
  accounting rarely needs complex math . 
  complex dbs , on the other hand ... 
  i 'd suggest some python . 
  it has a very good ratio of effectiveness/complexity , vast libraries for near any task and at very least could be a nice and educating perspective shift from more traditional ms languages . 
  avoiding questions is not a good thing , believe me . 
  you are my hero , man . 
  just like that . 
  well , duh . 
  insulting is one way to avoid a question . 
  one that says more about you than about person you 're trying to insult . 
  ah , * those * numerical methods ... yeah , that is must-know . 
  128 bit floating or not . 
  its more ... technical though . 
  \u0417\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f is a good wide known slang . 
  literally . 
  this summer i 've tried to move to yandex completely ( 10 year google user ) . 
  yandex search is in fact just as good for russian sites . 
  slightly worse for english . 
  in the end , google won as a whole , mainly because of android . 
  i 'm still using ya.market and ya.map . 
  you should start as soon as you can . 
  programming itself is not that difficult , it is mostly about practice and experience . 
  as for other things to learn , discrete math is at foundations of all things computer . 
  but even considering this , the best thing you can do is start coding right away . 
  learn it by doing it . 
  you are wrong . 
  permafrost will sink into them . 
   it is fiction, 
  it actually is based on a real story : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danguol%c4%97_rasalait%c4%97, 
   those statements that imply that sexual orientation can be influenced by propaganda are such bullshit . 
  it has nothing to do with influencing sexual orientation in minors , it is about influencing their minds , so you ca n't teach them that homosexual relationships are normal . 
  funny thing is that this law is actually quite democratic : very significant part of russia population is anti-gay ( in a sense that it 's some kind of perversion that can be tolerated if kept private ) . 
   but why the fuck would n't you teach them that any relationship that make people happy is normal ? 
  there are different reasons , but as i see it , main reason is that society is not ready for this . 
   do you prefer people being miserable after being forced into a `` traditional '' relationships ? 
  what , what ? 
  nobody * forces * anybody in any kind of relationship . 
  homo relationships are in no way forbidden in russia . 
  not equal to hetero , yes , but not forbidden . 
   it does n't even define what constitues the `` propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships '', 
  it kind of does , actually . 
  now * that 's * interesting . 
   that law is quite vague , it has been used to justify arresting , * torturing and killing homosexuals . 
  wait what ? 
  source please . 
  other than vice . 
  those links do not show how `` that law ... has been used to justify arresting , torturing and killing homosexuals . '', 
  as for vice ... http://lmgtfy.com/?q=vice+journalism+criticism, 
  what, 
   fact that the vague laws in russia allow the arresting , torturing , and killing of homosexuals, 
  it is not a fact . 
  no it 's not . 
  it is rather common , but it 's not a norm . 
   i 'm jealous of native russians for just having this feel natural to them . 
  1 month old native russian usually speaks rather ... basic form of russian . 
  according to this , bac was not specified before 2003 . 
  in 2003 it was set at 0.5 ; in 2007 , lowered to 0.3 ; in 2010 lowered to 0.0 then raised to 0.35 in 2013 ( i am not sure about last one though , it 's 0.16 in other sources . ), 
  link the source please , i 'll look into it . 
  c++ is a very , very deep language with a shitload of quirks . 
  i 'd strongly recommend against using it as a first language . 
  code reuse is a common practice , just make sure that you do understand ( at least vaguely ) what are you using . 
  reading other 's code is also a great learning tool by itself . 
  so keep at it , just do n't forget to use brain in addition to code copying . 
  all this shit is based on a blog post with rather suspicious ( read : photoshopped ) document . 
  even if this document is real , it says that this woman left dagestan in general sochi direction . 
  so all this `` she may have been able to get to sochi despite the so-called `` ring of steel '' of security forces '' smells like bullshit . 
  i second this . 
  ( `` how are you doing '' ) is not very common where i live ( tambov region ) , but it is normally recognized as a greeting to be answered with something like `` i 'm ok '' or `` so-so '' . 
   `` the most basic , most rudimentary spiritual need of the russian people is the need for suffering , ever-present and unquenchable , everywhere and in everything . '', 
  and that is why i detest dostoevsky . 
  the worst is that this saying is not even completely false ; it 's ... truth twisted to suit author . 
  it is good then that i do n't particularly care about your friendliness . 
  start small , learn one thing a time , try to separate mixed concepts like networked databases or web user interface . 
  programming is a very large field , your first goal is to learn to navigate it . 
  \u041c\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430\u044f is most precisely translated as car is silvery , not silver . 
  krasnodar definitely . 
  much larger city wich has some regional influence . 
  keep searching . 
  if you have any local acquaintances ( of a good kind ) or , better , friends - explain the situation and ask them to help , to ask around . 
  contact owners directly , without agents . 
  75000 rubles now and a chance that this filthy foreigner will ruin a 4 mil worth apartment ? 
  no way . 
  hmm . 
  what 's hilarious about a good vodka ? 
  dunno why , but nemiroff became hard to get here in russia . 
  something about customs i think . 
  but yeah , nemiroff is really good ( and i do n't really like vodka ! ), 
  \u0412\u043e\u043b\u044f is the willpower itself , a will to do something and a possibility ( maybe freedom ) to do something . 
  most broad word of a three . 
  it is a closest translation i can think of , not precise but adequate . 
  comp science teacher here . 
  my work is like 40 mins lecture , 10 mins rest , so i have some time here and there . 
  i had that girl ... 
  almost like it but not quite , as i 've thought .
