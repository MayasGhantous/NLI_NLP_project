  eu parliament can recognize whatever they want , but leading historians who dedicated their lives to the study of soviet history of this time disagree with the idea of holodomor being orchestrated by soviet government and stalin .

   just like that sweet museum in moscow i believe that had to get rid of its gulag and soviet union exhibit displaying the atrocities committed, 
  [ gulag museum in moscow ] ( http://www.gmig.ru/ ) is fine , and nothing had changed there ( well , except of them finally getting new building 4 times larger ) . 
  you 're talking about perm-36 museum , and , well , the whole `` erasing history '' thing is based solely on the words of its ex-director . 
   when the government has more control , it tends to use that control badly . 
  so , ideally there should n't be any laws at all ? 
  somehow i do n't like this idea . 
  another example : germany also regulates employment termination [ quite strictly ] ( http://www.nrwinvest.com/business_guide_englisch/employees_and_social_security/termination_of_employment1/index.php ) . 
  but somehow germany manages to be an economical powerhouse of europe . 
  logical conclusion would be that the fact of business regulation has nothing to do with economical success . 
   suffice to say , it 's one of the major contributors to the culture of corruption that surrounds businesses and governments in russia , and helps to keep the rich rich , and the poor poor .

   with regards to your out of date stats on us foreign media,

  do i understand it wrong ? 
  what to look for when buying used tripod ? 
  currently i use cheap chinese one borrowed from a friend , but it is really wobbly . 
  i found manfrotto 055xdb tripod with manfrotto 496rc2 head for $ 200 in nearby city , but i since i never used `` serious '' tripods with ball head , i simply do n't know what to look for , how to determine is it good or not . 
  thanks in advance for any suggestions . 
  i think you should 've either keep the tower in focus or recompose the photo and put it even more out of focus to make it less pronounced . 
  this photo is kind of undecided , in-between . 
  humorous ? 
  i do n't get it , then .

  my father had serious ulcer ~ ~ proliferation ~ ~ perforation ( he stupidly ignored the issue until it finally became deadly serious ) . 
  medical emergency car arrived shortly , and night shift surgeon managed to save him . 
  up to this day hardly anybody believes that , especially the part that we did n't pay any bribes . 
  it is free , as in its sustained by taxes . 
  in that sense , there is no truly free healthcare . 
  you 've essentially described one of main reasons why russia is n't one of the best countries on earth . 
  we give too much shit about what 's happening out there and what outsiders think of us , all while ignoring real internal issues .

  both brands are very common , local made . 
  do n't have any candy around here . 
   i 'm also interested if your countries have any local businesses , that have been in business for 80-100 years, 
  that 's kind of hard to find in russia , considering the revolution of 1917 and what happened after it . 
  still , there are some . 
  [ babayevsky company ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/babayevsky_ ( company \\ ) ) makes sweets since 1804 ( it was called `` abrikosov and sons '' before the revolution ) . 
  it seem that it is enough to not be rabidly anti-russian to be named `` pro-russian '' or `` putin shill '' . 
  eh , i 'm talking about ukraine ( well , mostly ) . 
  i 'm not sure , but it seems that buzina was kind of like shariy , who is also being called `` putin agent '' and what not for his attacks on ukrainian media ( without actually saying * anything * pro-russian or pro-putin ) . 
  talking out of your ass much ?

  nope , sorry . 
  not in this case , at least .

  you just broke my bullshit ` o'meter . 
  i 'm pretty sure that your screen is n't [ color calibrated ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/color_calibration ) , this results in slightly ( or sometimes not so slightly ) wrong colors on print . 
  also , your devices use light emitting screens , they are way brighter and have more contrast that light-reflecting prints . 
  there is autofocus functionality , just not on your body . 
  this lens requires external autofocus motor ( so-called `` screwdriver '' ) that nikon d3xxx and d5xxx do n't have . 
  higher level nikon bodies ( d7xxx for instance ) will autofocus this lens . 
  since this is pretty mediocre zoom lens ( if i 'm not mistaken ) , i 'd suggest to not bother with it . 
  d3100 focusing screen just is n't good enough for manual lenses . 
   another question i have is how do i focus to infinity when i want to capture photos of the stars ? 
  that depends on the lens . 
  some lenses have hard stop for infinity ( the focus ring stops at infinity ) , some require you to use autofocus on stars ( or another `` infinity '' object ) or focus manually . 
  i 'd suggest using manual focus in liveview mode with max magnification . 
   mirrorless cameras are generally cheaper and have the same performance as dslr 's ( is that correct ? ), 
  wrong on both accounts . 
  cheaper mirrorless cameras ca n't be really compared to dslrs ( too small and uncomfortable , even lowest level dslrs have way more controls , and this does matter ) . 
  performance can be quite close , but it 's still not there , unless you 're talking about something like sony a7 ( $ 1200 without any lenses ) . 
  unless size is absolutely critical , go for low-end dslr . 
  even 5 years old d3100 with 18-55 vr kit lens will run circles around any mirrorless camera with comparable price tag . 
  sure , if it costs you nothing , then why not ? 
  this lens is n't anything spectacular , but it 's not bad either . 
  of course . 
  but having to fiddle with the menu each time one wants to change basic settings is pretty uncomfortable , objectively . 
  lack of proper grip is also objectively worse , it heightens lowest acceptable shutter speed when shooting without a tripod . 
  you 're right , i was thinking about mirrorless in general and lumix in particular , and overall usability of dslrs . 
  i 'm sorry , but this isnt a source . 
  just some random numbers in a random article of questionable quality . 
  proper source would be a scientific research backed up by verifiable data . 
  what 's the point of starting with p & s cameras , unless you 're seriously limited on the budget and do n't plan to get at least somewhat serious ? 
  small size is a plus , definitely , but lack of control and unresponsiveness can be very frustrating . 
  in theory , yes . 
  in practice , only if you use the software that was created by your camera maker . 
  third party software uses different algorithms and settings for pretty much anything . 
  for instance , while lightroom has camera profiles that imitate different picture settings for any popular dslr , they are still off by very visible margin ( at least it 's true for nikon d5100 , canon 550d and canon 1100d ; may be it gets better for higher level cameras ) . 
  i still use lightroom for its unmatched controls and quality , but inability to easily match out of camera jpegs bugs me a bit .
