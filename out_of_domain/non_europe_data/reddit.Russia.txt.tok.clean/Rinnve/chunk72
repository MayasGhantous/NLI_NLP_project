  your fuji also costs 1.5 of nikon d3200 kit , if i 'm not mistaken . 
  cant argue on the interface since i 've only tried samsung , olympus and panasonic mirrorless . 
  ( dont get me wrong here , their higher models are superb , apart of samsung , but they also cost on par with semi-pro dslrs ) . 
  but if you can manage to do 1/f shutter speed on small mirrorless body , i 'm pretty sure you can get at least a stop or two slower than that with proper grip ( which mirrorless do have , just not the cheap ones ), 
  get nikon l830 then , nice compact camera with impressive image stabilization for its price . 
  dont chase megapixels , 10 mp is well enough . 
  compact lenses are more or less the same quality those days . 
  any compact with good manual control will cost close to outdated/used dslr , so just buy something under $ 200 and save up for more serious camera . 
  it has nothing to do with personal preferences . 
  it is about the possibility to position both hands in firm tripod-like position to reduce camera shake . 
  too small camera body simply makes it harder to do , unless one has also very small hands . 
  i think that vertical lines not being vertical is extremely annoying . 
  the building lines , of course . 
  [ here it is ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bscjxcq.jpg ) rotated and with some vertical perspective correction . 
  you certainly have a point here . 
  i think that if you want to keep the perspective , then it would be good at least to straighten the lines closer to the center of the picture , [ like this . 
   i think this article is the first i 've heard in the news about them and it 's bad news . . 
  there is nothing bad about closing `` graduation paper factories '' , which many of those `` universities '' are . 
  there is literally no other info about this yet , we have to wait . 
  ( i must add that none of russian universities worth mentioning are private owned . 
  yes , it is that bad . ), 
   80 % of russia 's gdp come from exporting natural gas , oil etc. . 
  [ more like 15 % . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_russia ), 
  i like the first one more . 
  compositionally , this photo is undecided between the stars and the old truck , there is nothing that unites those parts . 
  you can remove either , and the photo will get better . 
  so you do n't have any source for your 80 % claim , do you ? 
  holodomor being genocide is very controversial point of view , historically . 
  there are no archive documents that prove intention of soviet government to exterminate ukrainians ; there * are * archive documents proving that soviet government tried to contain the situation ( they sent food and grain to starving regions , for example ) , and , finally , other regions besides ukraine were affected just as severely . 
  source : [ science . 
  ] ( http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/mharrison/archive/hunger/ ), 
  got ta disagree with you . 
  without lamp it looks too monotone and dull , lifeless . 
  [ quick edit , far from perfect but enough to check it . 
  it is perfect . 
   most historians agree it 's a genocide, 
  `` most '' meaning `` historians i like '' ? 
  i * already * did this . 
  `` genocide scholars '' tend to oversimplify and even ignore `` inconvenient '' facts . 
  it seems that those times anybody literate can name himself `` a scholar '' , and people will believe him . 
  i only trust real historians who work with facts first-hand . 
  davies and s.g. wheatcroft ( linked above ) dedicated their lives to the study of soviet history , and they did n't find anything supporting the idea of holodomor being genocide . 
   is the first character in the cyrillic form of russia ? 
  yes . 
  not at all . 
  for instance , teachers use this word very often when discuss their professional teachy matters . 
  source : am teacher . 
  it is also least formal of all three to the point it can be found in some russian ... idioms ( ? ), 
  '' \u041e\u0431\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c '' is more precise , it is always translates as `` to teach '' . 
  because of precision , it is often seen in professional talk . 
  '' \u041f\u0440\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c '' is also precise and has somewhat different meaning , it is about teaching some subject . 
  ( sounds quite formal , though . ), 
  why this man has his head impaled by a pole ? 
  double the sansa advice . 
  got myself a sansa clip + , it 's a great little thing that plays lossless , can be rockboxed for more features and has great audio quality . 
  oh , and it has microsd slot . 
  there are options for paid education ( for instance , if one failed to get enough entrance exam scores , and those differ from uni to uni , so you 'll need to be pretty smart to get to the best ones for free ) , and it is always paid if it 's second or third degree . 
  but first degree is free . 
  [ biggest nope of all moscow ] ( http://img0.liveinternet.ru/images/foto/b/2/apps/1/821/1821470_57.jpg ) ( at least it was for me , and i 'm pretty sure it will be for anybody with the fear of heights ) . 
  yeah , i know it is pretty safe . 
  sadly , the fear of heights is n't rational . 
  it pretty much ruined my visit to moscow . 
   militants wanting to separate from the ukraine and join russia occupied a building , and were attacking others from it with firebombs and rocks . 
  [ you 're a fucking liar . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ddedpyg3es ), 
   you invade, 
  are you aware that most people who were burned alive in odessa were locals ? 
  it 's the same in the book too . 
  strugatsky 's fiction is social/psychological first , scifi second . 
  they do it `` just in case '' , so they wo n't be needed to prove in court that it is n't nazi propaganda . 
  symbian phones were pretty smart way before iphone . 
   no , like with most bans, 
  except nothing was banned . 
  from the article : `` it was selling very well ** and nobody had ever sent us any official complaints . 
  i was in your situation a while ago , went nikon because of larger lens choice ( vs. olympus pen though , never liked sony products much for some reason ) . 
  both nikon and canon are established systems , you simply ca n't go wrong with either . 
  i 'd recommend to go mirrorless only if you clearly understand it 's what you need and why you need it ( for example , `` because dslr is too big to carry every day '' or `` because mirrorless is silent and it is critical for me '' ) . 
   the sensor is more or less the same sony one in both cameras . 
  are you sure ? 
  nikon d5200 uses toshiba sensor . 
  the only full frame mirrorless in the world are the sony a7 series . 
  you must keep in mind though that there are only 5 lenses for it , since most sony e lenses were n't made for full frame . 
  there are adapters , some even support auto focus ... to some extent . 
  d5500 is n't full frame . 
  nikon does have good full frame cameras , both semi-pro and pro ; they also have very good semi-pro crop cameras . 
  all compatible with all nikon lenses ( not all 100 % compatible , like not working af without screwdriver on older fx lenses , but still ) . 
  this is exactly the reason i went nikon : if in some point in the future i will want something more professional than my d5100 , i would n't need to switch entire system or hunt for some rare and expensive piece of equipment . 
  yeah , it does seems that d5500 and a6000 have same or very similar sensors . 
  thanks for the info !, 
  well , it 's so much out of my price range that i just forgot about its existence . 
  very good !, 
  it may be not exactly `` proper '' portrait , but it got a lot of life . 
   it was banned, 
  it was n't . 
   russia could pay teachers and doctors, 
  eh , it pays . 
  sure , it 's nothing to brag about , but it is enough for me and my colleagues . 
   russia could build infrastructure, 
  russia builds infrastructure .
