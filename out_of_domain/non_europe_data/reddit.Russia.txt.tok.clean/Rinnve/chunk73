  again , anecdotal example : highway from michurinsk to tambov ( part of federal highway m6 kaspiy ) is now actually highway in most parts , not that ass-destroying washboard it was ten years ago . 
  local rail stations and trains are all renovated too . 
   russia could invest into future by investing in health and education, 
  russia invests in health and education . 
  there are new stadiums and sport arenas , there are new clinics , existing clinics are reconstructed and re-equipped , schools get some new shiny high-tech toys . 
  sure , it may be not everywhere and not fast enough to notice , but it happens ( and something tells me that rather poor agrarian tambov region is n't something unique ) . 
  vangers . 
  lulz and ( semi ) serious scifi combined in one fun package . 
   russia is whitewashing the gulag history and stalin-glorification is reaching unprecedented heights, 
  bullshit on both accounts . 
  first : `` the director of a russian museum at a stalin-era prison camp says '' . 
  is there any other evidence besides the words of the * former * director ? 
  second : there is n't a word in that article showing `` stalin-glorification '' . 
  your photos are saved with adobe rgb color profile . 
  devices and software that does n't support color profiles will render your photos incorrectly . 
  [ this is what happens , am i right ? 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bpo3fjw.jpg ) just tell your software to save images in srgb , in photoshop it 's edit -  convert to profile . 
  i am okay with any articles that present facts as they are . 
  so let me get this straight : you 're saying it 's okay to burn people alive as long as they are pro-russian ? 
  there is a wide range of use for assault rifles - anywhere from defending your march / camp on one side to massacring people with rain of lead like i suggested . 
  it appears that i 've concluded that those girls who were preparing lethal weapons intended to kill people . 
  personally , i do n't find this view extreme . 
   best case scenario : from beneath mushrooms, 
  sounds like you need [ endoscope adapter ] ( http://www.lockmaster-benelux.eu/contents/en-us/d125_kamera-und-kameraadapter.html ) ( and endoscope itself , of course ) . 
   native tatars, 
  found the ignorant one . 
  first , tatars lived in crimea , not in donetsk region ( which was largely uninhabited before it was settled by russians ) . 
  second , tatars are n't native to crimea , they just conquered it a couple of centuries before russian conquered it ( mostly to get rid of constant slave raids committed by crimean tatars ) . 
  the descriptions on [ the official images ] ( http://rusvesna.su/news/1430750005 ) are a bit disturbing . 
  `` designed for warfare under conditions of use of nuclear weapons and other wmds '' . 
  and the koalitsia-sv self-propelled gun : `` designed for destruction of tactical nuclear weapons '' . 
  this . 
  there are some similar idioms like / u/dalnore wrote , but in everyday life they are used far less than their one-word equivalents ( of course , that 's only what i observe , it may be a bit different in other parts of russia ) . 
  `` the reason in part is to keep the ruble from rising too quickly in value , which would make russian exports -- notably oil and gas -- more expensive on the world market . '', 
  last time i checked , russian oil and gas still trades in dollars . 
  it has nothing to do with rub/usd ratio . 
  this is perfect . 
   he 's fostered a culture of injustice and corruption, 
  i ca n't laugh hard enough to do justice to this bullshit . 
  i mean , have you been in russia in the nineties ? 
  yes i did . 
  that 's why what you wrote is incredibly funny . 
  if anything , putin * fought * corruption . 
  it was n't exceptionally successful , of course , you do n't erase in years what was grown for centuries ( `` fostered '' , ha ) . 
  but at least corruption on lower levels is very visibly lower . 
   he 's fostered a culture of injustice and corruption, 
  why that 's funny ? 
  a culture of injustice and corruption was `` fostered '' way before putin , not without the help of the west ( in the form of dismal economic policies offered by us and imf advisers ) . 
  you ca n't get more wrong with the statement quoted above . 
   but then , the fact that the russian people on average have a positive opinion of putin betrays a certain twisted standard of civility and justice in that culture . 
  or , that your view on russia and russian people and events in russia is seriously distorted . 
   putin 's crimes, 
   putin is a thug , a murderer, 
  this kind of accusations ca n't go without evidence . 
  do you have one ? 
  ( by evidence i mean something that has a chance of standing in a court for more than a second , not baseless bullshit that can be found in typical western press . ), 
  so let me get this straight : you accuse a man of being a murderer , and say that asking for evidence is ridiculous ? 
  making baseless accusations is a child thing , they do n't know yet about proper argument process and verification of facts .

  ivi.ru for movies ( not sure if accessible from us , though ) . 
  same here . 
   not always foreign is bad . 
  but registering as a foreign agent is n't about being good or bad . 
  it 's just about not hiding the fact of the foreign funding , that 's it . 
  please show some examples of what you see as being `` demonized and marginalised '' . 
  [ do you know that usa had essentialy the same law since 1930s ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_agents_registration_act ), 
  also , enemies of the state ? 
  `` a handful of groups , including for human rights , have refused to follow the law on principle . '', 
  what you expect to get for breaking a law ? 
   on the night before the `` foreign agents '' law came into force , unknown individuals sprayed graffiti reading , `` foreign agent !, 
  \u2665 usa '' on the buildings hosting the offices of three prominent ngos in moscow , including memorial . 
  so some russians do n't like organizations being funded ( and arguably controlled ) by usa . 
  does this mean that funding source must be hid ? 
   state-controlled ntv report `` fifth column '' on the gulag museum as us-controlled fascist supporters, 
  is anything in this report incorrect , false , a lie ? 
  like , you know , presenting [ upa scum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_poles_in_volhynia_and_eastern_galicia ) ( they were inmates of perm-36 ) as `` fighters for the freedom of enslaved nation '' ? 
  your knowledge of russia is a bit outdated . 
   you think that upa fighters were the only ukrainians sent to the camps ? 
  no , of course not . 
  that 's not my point . 
  my point is that perm-36 whitewashed upa , presenting them as a noble fighters for nation 's freedom , whereas in fact they were no better than nazis and started to fight them too only after they realised that ukrainians are considered the same untermensch just like poles and jews . 
   you think that the people persecuting these organisations are just `` some russians ? '', 
  spraying graffiti on the walls is now `` persecuting '' ? 
  so officials that check organizations that demonstratively do n't follow the law are `` thugs '' now ? 
  pointless and derivative ? 
  could you elaborate on this , please ? 
  many russians do n't even * know * about rt , just because it is aimed at the outside world , not at russia . 
  about credibility , i 've seen `` independent '' media presenting facts with visible bias just as well . 
  i do n't think it has something to do with the source of funding . 
  internal journalism standards matter way more . 
  pick one . 
  why the chinese just ca n't use something not so ugly ? 
  not russian . 
  sorry for not being clear , i had nothing against all those dishes ( and i * love * plov and borsch ) , but it is n't traditional russian cuisine . 
  rule 5 . 
  if you are replacing the title of the original link , make the new title objective . 
  nothing wrong , i was talking about four dishes i cited . 
  plov , shuarma , manti are all not even of slavic origin . 
  borsch is traditional ukrainian dish ( although it is extremely popular in russia too ) .
