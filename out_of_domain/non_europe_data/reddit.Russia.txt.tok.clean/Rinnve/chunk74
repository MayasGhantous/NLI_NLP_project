  original article tells nothing about `` pirating '' , for starters . 
  [ there are neo-nazis even in israel . 
  ] ( http://salda.ws/video.php?id=ezxm9jkukbo ) jewish neo-nazis in israel . 
  some people are just stupid . 
  what is true ? 
  does vk pirate those movies themselves , since it 's their `` business '' ? 
   go ask some people in eastern europe how they liked being part of the soviet union . 
  given that no countries in eastern europe were in fact parts of the soviet union ( except for baltic states ) , i really doubt you know a thing about what you say . 
  edit : a letter . 
   so either your title is misleading, 
  it * is * misleading and has completely nothing to do with the contents of the article ( except some words like `` tv '' and `` vk '' ) . 
  not bad , apparently . 
  its native instruction set is proprietary ( some kind of [ vliw ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/vliw ) ) , but it has binary-to-binary code translation for intel x86 instruction set . 
   interesting that russia chose sparc . 
  it 's not sparc . 
  some other elbrus processors are indeed sparc , but elbrus-4c is based on domestic [ elbrus 2000 technology ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elbrus_2000 ) . 
   i 'm having trouble finding an equivalent , if any , for a minor designation . 
  apparently it 's '' \u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c '' : [ example ] ( http://rosnou.ru/useful/msu_diplom/ ), 
  it 's very uncommon , though . 
  yeah , bloodless `` annexation '' of crimea is so much worse than what us did in the middle east and in ( former ) yugoslavia .

   sputnik news, 
   this is the government telling their people, 
  it 's not even in russian . 
  also , link ? 
  [ quick search ] ( http://sputniknews.com/search/?query=nuclear ) found nothing similar to `` do n't worry we would survive if we did a nuclear exchange with the us '' . 
   oh so its ok to take land because nobody was killed ? 
  may be , if it 's what the people of that land wanted for twenty years . 
  democracy in action , you know . 
  after all , many of crimeans fell asleep in the ussr one day , but woke up in ukraine - and nobody even * asked * them do they want it this way . 
   and georgia ? 
  georgia is left alone . 
  russia just makes sure that georgia in turn lefts alone abkhazia and south ossetia , and will not try and repeat bloodbath of the nineties ( when apparently it was ok for georgia to left ussr , but it was n't for those autonomous regions to left georgia in turn ) . 
   and chechnya ? 
  chechnya was left alone after 1st chechen war ( which russia * lost * ) . 
  it turned into another isis , complete with terrorism export , slave trade and beheadings . 
  2nd chechen war was started by chechnya attacking dagestan , not by russia . 
   also what is this whataboutism with america . 
  there is no `` whataboutism '' . 
  there is pointing at hypocrisy and double standards . 
   how many russian and ukrainians have died for crimea . 
  one , by accident . 
  do n't remember russian or ukrainian . 
   lets not forget the commercial airliner shot down . 
  may be you should n't even discuss events in that region if you ca n't tell crimea from mainland ukraine ? 
  you 're delusional . 
  eh , try exposure bracketing next time ? 
  why not ? 
  freight trains are n't heated . 
  that presents a big problem in most parts of russia for about 9 out of 12 months . 
  hell , in 2005 i almost froze to death in * passenger * train due to unusually cold winter ( about -40 c ) and faulty heating system . 
  jumped freight trains for short rides couple of times when was piss poor student though , and knew a guy how did it regularly ( for short rides too , like 10-20km ) . 
  observer bias . 
  colorful pictures of russia and polite driving are n't presented in the media proportionally because in the first case it is n't distinct enough ( `` just another east european country '' ) and in the second it 's mostly boring . 
  is [ this ] ( https://www.flickr.com/search/?q=tambov ) `` gray skied cement field of a country '' ? 
  summer of course , and thanks to continental climate it can get pretty damn hot here too ( +30 c is normal , +35 c not unseen ) , especially in july and august . 
  hottest , yes . 
  best ... may be not . 
  actually , i do n't know much about siberian climate except it is more extreme than in european russia ; but i think late august/september or late april/may/early june may be better : sure , it can be rather chilly sometimes , especially during nights , but not really winter-cold - and one thing guaranteed not to be is extreme heat . 
  nothing is worse than 35c heat with broken ( or nonexistent ) air conditioner . 
  awesome !, 
  i do n't agree that there is too much black , i think you 've got the balance just right . 
  for me , it 's eye-catching and living . 
  it 's completely correct . 
   dunno about now , but back in my time , there used to be a subject called `` common life security '', 
  \u041e\u0411\u0416 ( \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b \u0431\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 , basics of life security ) is still a thing , and now it 's crossed with soviet 's \u041e\u0412\u041f ( \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0430\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430\u044f , general military preparation ) , basically how to shoot pistol and rifle , how to march properly , things like that . 
  it 's also linked with shooting sport ( airguns mostly though ) . 
  it 's their own most probably , not schools . 
  it evolves every year . 
  since i 'm comp science teacher , i 'm not really interested in other subjects , but tests on computer science get better and better , it 's not a guessing game when you can check random answers and get something by chance . 
  it 's actually a bunch of tests on different subjects . 
  mandatory ones are russian language and maths ( which had been divided into two levels starting this year , you can choose basic or advanced math depending on what university you want to get in ) . 
  you also must choose several other subjects , like physics , sociology or computer science . 
  unified state exam is both graduation and entrance test for universities , so you choose university ( or even universities ) , look up which subjects you need and what are required scores , and get prepared . 
  starting this year , there is also an essay test , which must be done before use ( in december in most schools ) ; it is n't graded but it 's required to pass it to get to use . 
  i work as a computer science teacher , so ask away . 
  ( my school is kind of advanced though , so some things can be different from other schools . ), 
  `` robert richards iv , an heir to the du pont family fortune , served no jail time even though he plead guilty to the fourth-degree rape of his 3-year-old daughter in 2008 , according to court documents . '', 
  they ca n't be serious . 
  never trust lcd displays for evaluating exposure . 
  check histograms . 
   oh , and you guys hate ukrainians , even prior to the recent . 
  is that true ? 
  ca n't be further from truth . 
  '' \u0420\u0430\u043a \u043d\u0435 \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u044c '' sounds a bit off , because \u043f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u044c may mean both memory ( the storage , part of human brain ) and memories ( the data in memory ) . 
  it can be interpreted like `` cancer does n't damages your brain '' or something medical like that . 
  what / u/mymra suggested sounds way better to me . 
   a ukranian news website has photos of their passports ( or something like it ), 
  yeah , except those id have lnr written in it ( luganskaya narodnaya respublika , people 's republic of lugansk ) . 
  ukrainian media , of course , dismiss those ids as fake . 
  the amount of bullshit in you is frightening . 
  the occident .
