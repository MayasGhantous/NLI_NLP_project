  source ? 
  well , that 's bad . 
  i do n't know finnish , but i hope that there is also a list of all russians who died in finnish concentration camps , and a list of people punished for that war crime . 
  what is their business model ? 
  it was n't , though . 
  dresden , hiroshima and nagasaki can testify for this . 
  hate to be that guy , but it 's dash , not hyphen . 
  this is hyphen : - , it 's used for hyphenation and as a minus sign outside of proper typography ( proper minus sign is a bit wider and can be drawn at slightly different height : \u2212 ) . 
  yandex dictionary uses abbyy lingvo and promt dictionaries ; both have versions optimised for different industries ( aviation , oil and gas , computers etc. ), 
  means that this word was found in the dictionary for oil & gas industry . 
  tl ; dr : your brain creates illusion of single stable image from multiple snapshots taken while your eyes move rapidly around the scene , and you actually do n't see anything while your eyes are moving ( `` saccading '' ) . 
  btw this was a major plot point in `` blindsight '' by peter watts ( very mind-blowing sci-fi novel , totally recommend ) . 
  it 's not like you are going blind for a noticeable period of time , just for a very brief moment , and brain compensates for that . 
  it 's still enough to miss something small , though . 
  i 'd get closer . 
  way closer . 
  no , i mean using second version , like this :, 
  print ( '' { green } { olive } { lime } '' . format ( green = greens.green , olive = greens.olive , lime = greens.lime ) ), 
  in other words , using dict keys as if they were attribute names . 
  i know it is possible to make dictionaries behaving like this with some python magick , but summerfield states that it 's a built-in dict feature ( `` here , using mapping unpacking ( ** ) has exactly the same effect as writing . format ( green = greens.green , olive = greens.olive , lime = greens.lime ) '' ) . 
  eh , i do understand how to use \\*\\* . 
  my question is about this part : `` here , using mapping unpacking ( ** ) has exactly the same effect as writing . format ( green = greens.green , olive = greens.olive , lime = greens.lime ) '' . 
  i do n't understand why summerfield wrote this since apparently it just does n't work this way . 
  and this is the question !, 
  re-read my citation from summerfield 's book about ** being exactly the same as using dict keys as attribute names . 
  i do n't understand what he means here since apparently it just does n't work this way . 
   i 'd have to see the quote from the book itself to really make sense of it . 
  you 've already seen it , between `` '' quotation marks . 
  i found the errata for this book , it is indeed the author 's error . 
   ( they still do i presume ? ), 
  nope . 
  tried all three . 
  capture one pro renders really weird colors for my camera ( nikon d5100 ) , further investigation confirmed that it is n't just my eyes seeing things , it 's phase one not caring about providing correct camera profile . 
  uninstalled immediately . 
  dxo was okay as a raw processor , but it 's inferior for photo management compared to lightroom . 
  i also keep nikon 's own capture nx-d just in case : lightroom camera profiles are close , but not 100 % equal to nikon algorithms . 
  never felt like using it , though . 
  i 've read all those blog posts and comparisons , but i failed to notice significant difference for my photos . 
   also see : zack arias on sensor size . 
  this is both educating and hilarious . 
  thanks for the find !, 
  let 's take a view on openstore :, 
  if userchoice = = `` 1 '' :, 
  you call openweaponstore function here which returns some value , but then you just throw this value out . 
  if you want to pass it on , you should use return statement here too :, 
  if userchoice = = `` 1 '' :, 
  return openweaponstore ( myhero , myinventory ), 
   at the same time , we have a whole ministry of defence of one of the world nuclear powers , creating versions in defence of seemingly independent group of ` rebels ' . 
  except russian mod never stated that it was su-25 , or mig , or whatever . 
   the problem with that is that there were 9m38m1 missiles on buks at the moscow wwii victory parade this past may . 
  if you 're talking about [ this twitter post ] ( https://twitter.com/noclador/status/605706828345974784/photo/1 ) , it 's fake : [ the picture is 7 years old . 
  ] ( http://www.lentatv.ru/50890 ), 
  yeah , that 's about 5000 km from moscow or ukrainian border . 
  that 's longer that the distance from eastern ukrainian border to western coastline in spain . 
  they said that their radars spotted something like jet fighter , probably su-25 , near mh-17 . 
  that 's pretty far from stating that su-25 downed it . 
  yeah , `` fake '' . 
  since when amateur `` analysis '' made up by anonymous nobody on teh internets started to carry any credibility , at least without being double-checked by actual , you know , * experts * ? 
   you can go over the reports of bellingcat and others yourself . 
  i 'm no expert at photo forensic . 
  nor are you , or bellingcat guys for that matter . 
  i have no reason to trust this report until some respectable expert in that field checks it . 
   so , how could the ministry have satellite images of plane taking down mh, 
  they never had . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  i never hid that . 
  you have a problem with it ? 
  you must not forget one thing : russia is big and diverse . 
  do n't over-generalise . 
   it 's actually pretty hard to come across a truly religious person in russia, 
  not at all , i know several personally , and i do n't think that 's because i 'm in some strange rare social circle . 
   the kind that enthusiastically talks about jesus and various bible passages, 
  ah , but that 's not the definition of `` a truly religious person '' . 
  it 's about rituals and things like this . 
  obedience in the monastery , for instance . 
  do n't know how to translate properly ; basically , you travel to and live in a monastery for some time , and do some work for that monastery , usually something dull . 
  there is some religious meaning to that , self-restrain and purification of soul , or something . 
  religious persons i know do n't really talk about that with `` outsiders '' ; i only learnt about their seriousness by chance , when they were discussing religious things . 
  and those persons are n't old at all , they are somewhere in 30-40 . 
   people will be genuinely surprised and bewildered if a slavic russian says he 's atheist . 
  `` are n't you russian ? 
  do n't you love the motherland ? '', 
  are the general reactions in such a situation . 
  well , sometimes i discuss all kinds of things with my students when we have some free time ( i 'm a high school teacher ) , and yes , they are often surprised when they learn that i 'm atheist . 
  that said , i never heard something like `` are n't you russian ? '', 
  in response . 
   stalinist apologies in recent years, 
  and by `` apology '' you mean that episode when putin says `` stalin 's regime was criminal and ugly , but it ca n't be compared with hitler '' , right ? 
   i mean when putin speaks in russia and calls him a tough leader and polls show stalin gaining in popularity among the russian people . 
  lots of blah blah blah and not a single quote . 
  when exactly putin `` calls him a tough leader '' ? 
   keep in mind that leaders say different things to their own people , and to the outside world , and also that russians may interpret the same statement in a different way than you or i would . 
  i am russian , and i am talking about what putin says in russian for russians . 
  believe me , while there are people here who are willing to ignore `` criminal and ugly '' part ( or even outright * adore * stalin ) , they are minority . 
  that 's crazy . 
  how easy it is to end up in prison for not paying child support in the us ? 
  is that sudden inability to converse intelligently caused by me telling you my nationality ? 
  may be do n't act xenophobic next time ? 
  you know , i 'm just a little bit tired of the media image of average russian seeing `` cia propaganda '' everywhere . 
   you came at me with `` bla bla bla '' and claiming the article i linked was false .
