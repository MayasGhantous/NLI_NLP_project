  claiming ? 
  this article contains * zero * putin words , yet you tell that , according to it , putin `` calls him [ stalin ] a tough leader '' . 
  how is this not false ? 
  this is actually pretty great . 
   russia 's economy was gone, 
  may be it 's just a glitch . 
  my nikon charger never signals that battery is fully charged unless i remove the battery from it and insert it again . 
   can people who ca n't afford a good camera still be good photographers if they use a point and shoot ? 
  absolutely . 
  however , it 's a lot harder to * learn * how to be a good photographer with a camera that always thinks for you . 
  used old dslr can be had for pretty low price , and you 'll learn a lot faster with it than with a point and shoot . 
  ( and , unlike most p&s cameras , dslr are usually made to last , so it 's much easier to find old used one that still works just fine . ),

   i 've heard racism against non-whites is a problem in russia , what can i do to avoid unsafe situations ? 
   will the police expect bribes from me ? 
  it would be an extremely bad idea to try to bribe the police ( or anyone for that matter , unless you really know what you 're doing , and i 'm pretty sure you do n't ) . 
   i 've heard that once a bottle of vodka is opened , it must be finished regardless . 
  is it alright to decline alcohol or have only a little bit of alcohol in social gatherings with friends , or do i have to drink just as much as them to avoid offending their culture ? 
  it is completely alright to not drink at all , or to drink just a bit . 
  well , unless you 're hanging out with some low life junkies . 
   whats the best/quickest/easiest way to learn a little bit of russian ? 
  there is / r/russian for that . 
  you mean [ this one ] ( http://rt.com/op-edge/240021-mh17-investigation-su25-ukraine/ ) ? 
  [ this guy uses m4/3 for professional wedding photography . 
  ] ( http://www.mu-43.com/threads/61628/ ), 
  i think he means that it 's nudging chances in one case , and piling up massive bribes to go from `` no chance in hell '' to actually winning in another . 
  aaand we 're seeing a credible source on this any time now , right ? 
  right ? 
  are you aware that there are about 120 ethnicities in russia , besides russians ? 
  russian nationalism my ass . 
  russia 's probably most multicultural country in the world , those ideas not gon na fly here . 
  most professionals ? 
  do n't think so . 
  however , composing in b/w is easier because you do n't worry about color harmony and contrast . 
  there is also this `` classy old school '' feel about b/w . 
  yeah , and 19 % that are not . 
  we are talking about millions of people here , not spread out here and there , but living in ethnic communities , keeping their language and culture . 
   that place is a lot smaller than russian . 
  exactly . 
  when we 're talking about country as big as russia , even 19 % is still millions and millions of people . 
  tatar `` minority '' is half the ireland in size , and that 's only one minority . 
  yeah , `` credible '' . 
  [ the one with door knob is 100 % fake ] ( http://deadspin.com/how-i-accidentally-became-part-of-the-anti-russia-consp-1520035331 ) . 
  i see no reason to trust this source . 
  do you understand what `` credible source '' means ? 
  i 'm sorry , but i see no reason to trust your words , or anybody else for that matter . 
  there was powerful anti-russian media campaign , with many fakes and exaggerations ( which , of course , remained virtually unreported later ) . 
  yes , tatars are the largest minority in russia , well integrated and equally treated . 
  they also have nothing to do with crimean tatars : that 's different ethnicity with different language , culture and history . 
  [ mipt ] ( http://mipt.ru/en/ ) , [ bauman university ] ( http://www.bmstu.ru/en/ ) , [ itmo ] ( http://en.ifmo.ru/ ), 
  you are n't very bright , are you ? 
  do some research about gear availability in your area . 
  for example , when i was choosing my camera , i first went for olympus m43 system , but it turned out that where i live 1 ) new bodies/kits are quite a bit overpriced , 2 ) lenses are all to be ordered ( and also very overpriced ) , 3 ) used market is nonexistent . 
  so it became good old nikon vs canon , and nikon feels a bit better for me usability-wise . 
  there is also this : if your sister specifically wants dslr , mirrorless might not do : it feels different , mirrorless cameras are smaller , and cheaper mirrorless feel like point and shoot . 
  dslr is safer choice . 
   and if you do n't , they 'll overthrow your ~ ~ democratically elected government ~ ~ dictatorship and install ~ ~ their own people ~ ~ freedom \u00a9 and democracy \u2122 .

  * woosh *, 
  but but yanukovich was corrupt oligarch !, 
  do n't read comments there . 
  please . 
  it may be contagious . 
  there is nothing arbitrary about considering russia or any other country diverse if `` minorities '' are as large as many `` stand alone '' european nations . 
  nationalism not gon na fly if you offend with it millions of people who are n't actually quite russian , who have their own identity as a part of multinational , multicultural federation . 
  it is a recipe for civil war , it 's that simple . 
  eh , i know . 
  my comment was mostly childish satire . 
  jpeg format , certainly . 
  jpeg camera mode ? 
  lots of shitty automatic processing more often than not . 
  flash with some kind of flash gel and/or reflector to `` smooth '' the light . 
  best thing would be external flash directed to the walls or the ceiling , i think . 
  tripod would n't help because it just makes possible long shutter speed ( = really blurred moving objects ) . 
  sensor size has nothing to do with print size , at all . 
  what matters there is sensor resolution ( megapixels ) and lens resolution ( because , for instance , 24mp would n't be worth anything with shitty lens that makes smallest details five pixels wide ) . 
  ff generally performs better in low light , so you will see difference if many of your shots are at a iso 1600 + , although that really depends on particular sensor performance , modern crops can be way better than older ffs . 
  totally , absolutely this . 
  i was asked to shoot some events recently , which i did for experience ... which was shit . 
  it is taxing , it is generally unrewarding , it has nothing to do with that feeling when i 'm free to shoot what i want the way i want , however freakish or unprofessional it would be . 
  never again . 
   well rounded in both video and photo, 
   nikon, 
  pick one . 
  sony or canon . 
  both know a thing or two about the right way to shoot video . 
  i 'm not into that field , but i heard a ton of good things about how recent sony mirrorless perform for videography , canon is more of old dull safe bet around here ( it is used a lot , just not `` hip '' enough or something ) . 
  the author showed that raw images can be processed to look way better than jpegs , and that 's true , thanks to greater dynamic range and lack of stupid in-camera/in-phone processing which ca n't hold a candle to what modern raw editors are capable of . 
  that 's actually an okay-ish battle tag , which it is . 
  the difference is that it would be harder to compose the picture : in aps-c viewfinder you view end result , but in ff viewfinder you must account for further cropping . 
  also , for quality to be the the same , ff sensor must have about twice more pixels . 
  for instance , nikon d600 in full-frame mode gives you 6,016 \u00d7 4,016 pixels ( 24 megapixels ) . 
  but in dx mode ( auto crop for aps-c lenses , dx in nikon-speak ) pictures are only 3,936 \u00d7 2,624 pixels , that 's about 10 megapixels . 
  i 'd recommend one of those new mirrorless cameras with phase-detection focus sensors ( phase-detection focusing is way faster than contrast focus traditional for point and shoot cameras ) . 
  one of sony nexes , may be . 
  stay away from super zooms if you are n't ready to accept significantly lower optical quality . 
  55-200 , 70-200 or 70-300 are all noticeable better .
