  most differences are really negligible for general customer without specific needs , so in your place i 'd just ( 1 ) put a strict limit on budget and ( 2 ) just go to the store of choice and try out any sony , olympus , fujifilm and panasonic mirrorless cameras they have . 
  add nikon 1 and canon m to that list if you 're limited on the budget ( those are cheaper but somewhat inferior ) . 
  if the usability and speed suits you , go for it . 
  all those cameras are great , thanks to the competition . 
  if video is priority i 'd go with canon or sony system . 
  nikon * can * shoot videos , but they are lagging behind somewhat feature wise in that department . 
  megapixels are n't better quality after some margin which lies about ten mp unless you 're printing really big prints ( like 1 meter wide ) . 
  you will not see the difference unless you 're pixel peeping ( which you should not do anyways ) . 
  think about future lenses you want to use . 
  both systems generally have all , but , say , there is n't anything in nikon-land compared to 24 and 40 canon walk-around pancakes , and otherwise , no cheap and great nikon 35 for canon . 
  `` programming in python 3 '' by mark summerfield is much better as an `` introduction to python '' book , although it assumes some basic knowledge of programming concepts . 
   and in my opinion is just natural that they return . 
  aslo thr majority of them chose to reside in the area closest to russia, 
  return ? 
  chose to reside ? 
  i 'm sorry , but being born and raised in certain area is n't `` choosing to reside '' there . 
  15 % of ukraine 's population moved there from russia as teens or adults ? 
  nonsense . 
  \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u043e 5 : if you are replacing the title of the original link , make the new title objective . 
  for me , there is no such thing as an `` average month '' . 
  if mood hits , i can go out several times a day and take hundreds of photos each time ( how much keepers out of that is different question ) . 
  for the last two months though ... 
  zero photos . 
  busy with other hobbies . 
  ( i still read about photography , mostly composition ; also think about what pictures i 'd want to take and how to do it . 
  may be call that planning ahead ? . . ), 
  there is no way to turn white or gray into this kind of blue with white balance . 
  it is perfect . 
  i literally can not find anything in this picture that works against other details . 
  composition , light , color , processing , even noise . 
  matplotlib plot is essentially an array of x , y dots . 
  what you are actually doing here is changing y-coordinates of those dots without changing x-coordinates . 
  one possible solution is to generate new sets of coordinates for each animation frame , like this :, 
  x = np.arange ( 0 , 1 , 0.01 ) # x-array, 
  line , = ax.plot ( x , 2 * x ), 
  line.set _ xdata ( x ), 
  line.set _ ydata ( 2 * x ) # update the data, 
  return line ,, 
  send it to service . 
  same happened to my lumia 720 , service ended up replacing half the phone internals . 
  after repair , no problems whatsoever . 
  may be something like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3zl6hft.jpg ) ? 
  do n't think so . 
  in my country , free service is only for year after purchase ( for smartphones at least ) . 
  better check with your retailer . 
  russia has its own cpus and software without nsa backdoors ( ridiculously expensive for general customer , though ) . 
  print [ test chart ] ( http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/~westin/misc/iso_12233-reschart.pdf ) and find it out by yourself . 
  none of the lenses you listed require af motor in the body . 
  also , d5x00 series has swivel screen that can come in handy ( it allows me to easily take photos from [ very low ] ( http://cs622119.vk.me/v622119121/2e7d0/ch4kuxme7da.jpg ) or [ very high ] ( http://cs622422.vk.me/v622422121/2ea46/rp5iyhmcs_w.jpg ) points ) . 
  that said , d7100 is weather-protected and has more controls and accessories like battery grip . 
  auto and scene modes seem to be similar , at least on paper ( i never used them myself ) . 
  also , do n't buy telephoto lenses without image stabiliser , unless you have super steady hands . 
  i tried pretty much everything paid and free . 
  for me , nothing beats lightroom + photoshop for $ 10/month , although nikon 's own capture nx-d is n't very bad . 
  it 's just slow and does n't have any local adjustment tools ; but color rendition is identical to camera 's own processing , this ca n't be said about other tools , so i keep it just in case . 
  it is incredibly hard to crack properly implemented crypto without having some kind of backdoor . 
  this polarr is n't raw editor , though . 
  it imports raw , but further editing is apparently in 8 bit , so you can forget about correcting under - or overexposed images . 
  [ this is +2 exposure in lightroom ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qqgbhvu.png ) , and [ this is the same raw processed in polarr ] ( http://i.imgur.com/i38luxp.png ) . 
  why not ? 
  it 's not something complicated , and it 's great safety net for possible exposure mistakes . 
   there is nothing offensive about `` labus '', 
  there is nothing offensive about '' \u0445\u043e\u0445\u043e\u043b '' too . 
  '' \u041a\u0430\u0446\u0430\u043f '' is offensive though . 
   the final step is to return line , which i think does something called tuple unpacking . 
  actually a reverse : tuple packing ( creating a 1-tuple in this case ) . 
  it is required since you 've set blit parameter of funcanimate to true . 
  in this case , according to docs , both animate ( ) and init ( ) functions are required to return an iterable container with objects to clear before drawing next frame . 
  you 're not getting anything useful with printing line object because it has only very basic string representation , it just not meant to be printed . 
  using an ide with debugger is more useful in such cases ( i 'd suggest either eclipse + pydev or pycharm community edition ) . 
  also , you can safely remove blit = true altogether with both return line , statements . 
  this way you will modify existing line object , which automatically redraws upon any change . 
  exactly . 
  to grow line how op wanted , it is required to update both x - and y-values . 
  that lens for $ 16 ? 
  ca n't be real . 
  this is basic crappy all-around kit lens . 
  well , not that crappy , optical quality is okayish , but build quality is very cheap . 
  newer 18-55mm vr ii is noticeably better . 
  this is not lens , this is addon for macro photography . 
  [ this is ] ( http://www.amazon.com/nikon-18-55mm-3-5-5-6g-nikkor-model/dp/b000lwj1es/ref=pd_sim_sbs_421_3/185-6231428-2395353?ie=utf8&amp;refrid=0pp6e4gm9q3y3qjbq6zm ) nikon 18-55mm f/3 .5 -5.6 g ed ii af-s dx . 
   when using photoshop instead of lightroom , with things like dodge/burn or hue/saturation and shadows/highlights layers , am i working with the same level of detail or recovery that i am in a purely lightroom workflow ? 
  if you 're working in 16-bit mode , probably yes . 
  however , [ lightroom uses specific color profile tuned for photo processing ] ( http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/imprint_downloads/peachpit/peachpit/lightroom4/pdf_files/lightroomrgb_space.pdf ) , which is rather hard to imitate in photoshop ( profile per se is easy , but all operations are still working differently ) . 
  for $ 200 you are n't going to get even used entry level dslr with anything besides kit lens . 
  higher level camera is out of question unless it 's like 10 years old ( and you are n't going to get any lens worth talking of , because lenses age well and do n't sell much cheaper than new ) . 
  do n't ruin your experience , save up some money , about $ 400-500 at least . 
   i want a camera with a lot of options/possibility . 
  not gon na happen unless you consider used 35mm film slr camera . 
   but seriously learning a language is rather pointless unless you are going to interact with people who speak it . 
  each language is a certain way of thinking . 
  * different * way of thinking . 
  heck , i 'm seriously considering learning finnish just to experience how it is to think in a language without genders and future tense ( it also sounds very beatiful to me ) . 
   and if you understand russian you understand at least partly other slavic languages which is especially useful in germany with polish, 
  nope . 
  i ( native russian speaker ) can kind of understand ukrainian if it is n't spoken too fast , but polish is completely unintelligible to me . 
  written polish can be figured out , though . 
  '' \u0448\u0443\u043c\u043b\u0438\u0432\u044b\u0439 '' is n't really a word . 
  also , '' \u0432\u044b \u0437\u0430\u0431\u044b\u043b\u0438 '' ( even if talking to one person ) . 
  huh .
