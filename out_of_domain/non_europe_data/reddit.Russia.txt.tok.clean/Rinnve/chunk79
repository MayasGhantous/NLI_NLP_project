   but nowadays do russians learn about it in school ? 
  yes we do . 
  depending on the course though it can be displayed differently . 
  in most basic course , it is just a small episode of wwii , there is about 1/4 of page about it , without even mentioning katyn massacre ( just `` many captive polish officers were subject to repressions '' ) . 
  there are in-depth courses , but even there katyn may be glossed over . 
  it may sound as somewhat cold , but history lessons in russia are more about why thing did happen in the way they did happen , and katyn is just another episode of stalin 's brutality , hardly noticeable in the shadow of purges of the thirties . 
   you 'll understand why the war is only taught in positive light in russian highschools, 
  actually , it is not the case . 
  proof : any official-approved history schoolbook of your choice . 
   there is no single standard history text book, 
  ftfy . 
  [ here ] ( http://sh65.ru/sites/default/files/upload/prikazn253-ot%2031.03.2014g.pdf ) is one for 2014-2015 academic year . 
  yes , more or less objectively ; every single schoolbook , even most basic one , tells about his repressions . 
  generally , he is portrayed as effective ( not without serious mistakes though ) , but extremely brutal dictator that built quite inhumane regime , capable of great achievements but without caring about individual human lives . 
  hence the mixed feelings about him : on one hand , he and his government were responsible for great suffering ; on the other , if not for his brutal push to industrialisation of the ussr , the outcome of the ww ii would 've been radically different ( think `` holocaust '' only for slavs and other `` subhumans '' ) . 
   do you have an online example of negative portrayal of rkka in school books ? 
  negative portrayal of rkka , or not teaching the war only in positive light , like molotov-ribbentrop pact and soviet aggression on poland ? 
  anyways , you can find some schoolbooks on alleng.ru , and [ here ] ( http://sh65.ru/sites/default/files/upload/prikazn253-ot%2031.03.2014g.pdf ) is the list of approved schoolbooks for 2014/2015 year . 
   but so is fighting with an unmarked uniform . 
  actually , that 's not true . 
  the only requirement in geneva conventions is that a soldier can be distinguished from a civilian . 
   i 'm not sure exactly , but i was under the impression that it was illegal in general to display the flag . 
  it was , before 2008 . 
  it is n't now , but there are still [ some rules ] ( http://www.garant.ru/article/516320/ ) . 
  well , i 'm russian , and have lived in russia for all of my life . 
  '' \u041e\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0430 '' is more ... military , if that makes sense . 
  if that 's the case , putin then failed miserably : nobody here in russia cares much about `` the conflic with the west '' . 
  well , except may be edgy teenagers in teh internetz with all those dank memes about obama and merkel and what not . 
  why do you think putin has so much support ? 
  corruption in contemporary russia is nothing compared to russia of nineties . 
  i mean , yes , russia is still very corrupt , but at least it 's not like you are literally bribing your way through life as it was during yeltsin 's rule . 
  you know , i do n't care much about elite power play . 
  what i care about is that i do n't have to bribe a doctor , or a teacher , or a policeman to do his job . 
  i do n't have to go to crumbling clinic , because the money for its renovation were n't stolen completely ; i do n't have to drive over potholes because at least main roads are fixed . 
   all those endless ` non-tax budget fees ' that businesses have to pay to sundry governmental agencies . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  some of my acquaintance run businesses ( nothing big , well under $ 1 mil . 
  ) , and that 's the first time i hear about some ` non-tax budget fees ' . 
  how it is called in russian ? 
   sure if you are in moscow or st. petersburg potholes will be filled but not 99 % of russia . 
  the thing is , i do n't live in moscow , nor do i live in st. petersburg . 
  i live in mostly agrarian region about 400 km south-south-east from moscow , called tambov region . 
  it is n't extremely wealthy , far from it ( it is basically in the middle of any random economic rating of russian regions ) , and i do n't think that tambov region is some magical island , and everywhere else things are as they were in the nineties . 
   actually you live in one of the better off areas in russia . 
  cold hard numbers begs to disagree . 
   you dont know how lucky you are and how shitty much of russia has become . 
  facts or gtfo . 
  i 'm not blind , you know , and i do n't sit in some kind of a shell oblivious to what happens around . 
   you also seemed to ignore 99 % of my comment, 
  i tend to ignore empty words , yeah . 
  why do you call that world-wide common practice `` legal corruption '' ? 
  it probably would be faster and cheaper to order it printed from svg file ( since it 's vector , it can be resized without loss of quality ) . 
  www.the-flag-makers.com , for instance . 
  mostly it 's `` the great patriotic war '' , but any mention of `` war '' is defaulted to gpw , like in `` my granddad was wounded in the war '' ( nobody will ask which war it was ) . 
   speaking clean russian accents, 
  there is no such thing . 
  you ca n't tell educated ukrainian speaking russian from educated russian speaking russian . 
  russian language 's pronunciation is much more uniform , compared to english . 
   imagine that vladimir putin flees russia , is he still the president of russia months later ? 
  we have no need for imagination . 
  president of yemen fleed from his country months ago , but the situation is basically a reverse of what happened in ukraine : ousted president is supported by outside parties . 
  you 'll need either pop3 or imap library to connect to your mailbox and do whatever you need with the emails . 
  do n't forget to enable pop3/imap in mailbox settings , iirc google mail has it disabled by default . 
   has anyone read the article ? 
  that 's / r/worldnews , what do you expect ? 
  it 's mostly ignored . 
  big celebrations are 1st and 9th may , and the new year ( not christmas , it 's celebrated but it 's strictly religious ) . 
  try to use '' \\ \\ \\ \\ u000a \\ \\ \\ \\ u000a '' instead of '' \\ \\ u000a \\ \\ u000a '' . 
  does it help ? 
  actually , no . 
  do n't trust random websites . 
  i 'm russian myself , tekla is n't russian name at all . 
  actually , after some research , i found it . 
  it 's of greek origin , but russian variant would be `` fyokla '' , not `` tekla '' , that 's why i did n't recognized it . 
  search in vkontakte found 18 teklas , 17 of them georgians and 1 latvian . 
  still , i do n't know any sane russian who would call their daughter `` fyokla '' , it 's so xix century . 
  i find it hard to believe you . 
  it 's not retarded at all if you think about it this way : ukrainians ( at least government ) do n't fight for their people . 
  they fight for territory , and they do n't give a shit about people who happen to live there . 
  small correction : ` int ( 5.6 ) ` and ` int ( 5.9 ) ` are both 5 in this case . 
  ` int ( ) ` truncates numbers , ` round ( ) ` rounds them . 
   marius yanukonis [ lithuania 's ambassador to ukraine ] told ukraine 's channel 5 that lithuania wanted to be the first country to openly arm ukraine, 
  it 's right there . 
  exactly . 
  it 's `` lithuania 's ambassador told that lithuania wanted to supply arms '' , not `` lithuania to became ... '' . 
  in other words , wishful thinking on the side of ukrainian media . 
  hated by whom , buddy ? 
  provide some data examples then , i 'll try to figure it out . 
  would your response have been the same if some scientific facts were presented incorrectly ? 
  well , you can simply register in vkontakte and search for teklas . 
  i found 18 , 17 of them georgian , 1 latvian , none russian . 
  just to compare , a couple of actually common russian female names : tatyana and anastasia . 
  there are 2 536 073 tatyans there and 2 699 074 anastasias . 
  both poplib and imaplib are in the standard library of python 3 , not sure about 2 but i believe it 's there too ( working with mailboxes is fairly common problem ) . 
  thanks for saved time , i guess . 
  reamde was on my reading list for some reason ; i 'll give it lower priority . 
   internet . 
  i believe your internet is cheaper and faster ( but this is coming from someone who lived in one of the places with the worst internet in se asia ) but are there any blocked websites/apps ? 
  i use viber , skype , and facebook to communicate .
