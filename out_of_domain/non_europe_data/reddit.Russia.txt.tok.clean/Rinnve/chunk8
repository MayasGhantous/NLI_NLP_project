  simply put , i was dumb . 
  i 'm not sure that there are proper words for that kind of regret . 
  of course not . 
  but that 's how russian old lady would think . 
  what 's so ` must-read ' about a comments there ? 
  interview itself is much more amusing . 
  self-importance of this man is so overwhelming i did n't thought that it is even possible . 
  this article is full of bullshit , nothing sensible is in it . 
  you can take any random part of this article and it will be a lie , an overstatement , or author 's name . 
  typed it with mnemonic ( phonetic ) layout in win8 . 
  it uses combined keys for some letters : jo -  \u0451 , je -  \u044d , ja -  \u044f , ju -  \u044e , sc -  \u0449 , ch -  \u0447 ( you can also use ` y ' instead of ` j' : yo -  \u0451 etc ) . 
  there are also third-party solutions , like this : http://winrus.com/kbd_r.htm#files, 
  it 's not about conditioning really . 
  as common saying goes , a real siberian man is not one who can withstand harsh weather , it 's one who clothes up properly . 
  really cold weather like -30 and below can though be extra tricky and dangerous and counterintuitive ( like protecting face with a scarf to warm up can actually lead to some breath subsystem damage ) . 
  it would need balls of steel even to imagine oneself doing it . 
  i guess it will be balls of ice if actually done . 
  * shrugs *, 
  it 's all the same except for some minor nuances . 
  if you can provide some background , it would be easier . 
   so is smiling really special , reserved only for intimate times ? 
  not really special , more like informal . 
  so , you usually do n't smile when dealing with some serious business ( or just day-to-day business for that matter ) , but most of the time it 's not very different from western . 
   they smile when they are genuinely amused/happy . 
  this is incorrect . 
  we smile whenever we want to . 
  when i smile to saleslady or cashier , it 's just me being nice and polite . 
  or playing nice and polite . 
  or it 's just silly grin because i 've remembered a good joke . 
  and no , the whole smile-smile exchange is kind of custom here too . 
  it may be less common , but it is certainly quite impolite not to answer nice smile ( ` i 'm being polite ' kind of smile ) ; may be with one exception that you ca n't continue the conversation , like :, 
  - ( polite smile ) excuse me , where i can find ... 
  - ( no smile ) i 'm sorry , but i 'm very busy right now . 
   the unspoken but pretty obvious assumption in all of the lectures demanding gay rights now , is about producing , amending or abolishing written laws enforced by the state . 
  somehow , some convince themselves that a de jure transformation will be sufficient , and helpful to those directly benefitting from the law ( even though it may provoke resentment and aggression ) . 
  it thus ignores long-term de facto realities of custom and convention . 
  voice of reason . 
  finally . 
  smiling without starting a conversation is a bit weird , yes . 
  another difference is probably that * not smiling * is totally ok and most of the time means exactly nothing . 
  this new russian law has nothing to do with being gay . 
  it is against shit like this : http://www.queerty.com/photos-fckh8s-pro-gay-olympic-coloring-book-being-sent-to-10000-russian-kids-20131119/, 
  we may have different definitions of ` polite smile ' . 
  also , people in big cities tend to be more ... reserved . 
   i was taught in michel thomas there is no `` is '' in russian, 
  what . 
  there is `` is '' in russian . 
  '' \u0411\u044b\u0442\u044c '' and all its forms . 
  it is very often omitted , but it 's still here , hidden . 
  yeah . 
  and `` is '' in english is a form of `` to be '' . 
  there is one thing though . 
  word '' \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c '' have two meanings : 1 ) a form of '' \u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c '' ( = '' \u0441\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c '' ) ; 2 ) completely unrelated verb translated as `` to eat '' . 
  criminal world ? 
  it 's about intelligence work . 
  there are no battles here , but ww2 was not only about battles . 
  by the way , the book is even better , and it 's only one part of the entire series about maxim maximovich isaev aka max stierlitz . 
  navitel makes the best maps for russia . 
  not exactly cheap , but it 's worth it . 
   remember that time russia burned moscow to the ground instead of letting it napoleon take it ? 
  tl ; dr : napoleon soldiers started fire accidentally while looting , without fire fighters it went out of hand . 
  you are missing the point . 
  napoleon did take moscow , and only then it went in flames . 
  it is not as it is romanized ( and i have no idea why someone would romanize russian \u0449 like that ) . 
  it 's soft \u0448 . 
  you just ca n't pronounce \u0448 and then \u0438 , it comes out like \u0449 . 
  it 's more about vowel after \u0448 / \u0449 rather than about the consonant itself . 
  learning a language and learning rules of a language are two very different things . 
  as for your question ... what they wanted to say is, 
  a ) you must add specific endings to some russian words that depend on circumstances to `` connect '' words in a sentence , and, 
  b ) some words in their basic form end on soft consonant , some on hard , and, 
  c ) when you add an ending that starts with a vowel , you change the type of that vowel according to ( b ) . 
  for example , let 's take two words : '' \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u044c\u044e\u0442\u0435\u0440 '' ( computer ) and '' \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c '' ( user ) . 
  take a sentence , say `` this problem is on computer 's side '' / '' ... user 's side '' . 
  i added ending to '' \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u044c\u044e\u0442\u0435\u0440 '' to connect this word to others . 
  i then added essentially the same ending to '' \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c '' , but because '' \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c '' end with soft consonant , vowel in the ending becomes soft too . 
  there is one problem though . 
  this alphadictionary page oversimplifies things so much that i do n't think that you ( or anybody ) can learn something useful from it . 
  more like love/hate . 
  it 's extremely fun and fulfilling when most of the class pays attention and actually * learn * things - either because they find it useful , fun , or just why not . 
  on the other hand , it becomes quite annoying and tiring when they just do n't care - because computerz internetz dota dota dota ( i 'm computer science teacher by the way ) . 
  grade does n't matters very much , it is this ... feeling . 
  like they have some kind of hive mind , and it either works with you , or do n't even consider you worth the attention . 
  upper grades , when they generally become more mature and serious , are usually better in that aspect , so i tend to work mostly with 14-18 y.o. 
   although i do n't know how it should sound like with such transliteration . 
  yeah , that 's what i was trying to say . 
  although looking at this table , i think other transliteration attempts are just as bad at it . 
  wow . 
  that 's some serious stuff . 
  synthetic , i 'd say . 
  no weed can get you that high . 
  the thing is that vodka is most effective way to get drunk . 
  anything else is irrelevant . 
  ( btw , there * is * good and inexpensive wine , and i do n't honestly know what do you mean with beer . ), 
  extremely tasty ? 
  vodka ? 
  hardly . 
  i find it too bland ( expensive sorts ) or just plain revolting ( < $ 50 ) . 
  to each his own . 
  but when russians discuss the taste of vodka , they usually call good vodka `` soft '' , so `` you drink it like water '' .
