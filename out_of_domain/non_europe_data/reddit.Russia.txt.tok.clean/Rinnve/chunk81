  people believe crazy things everywhere . 
  the only source of this claim is this article itself . 
  please , stop spreading this bullshit . 
  du-uh !, 
  that 's true for basically every foreign language . 
  great tips nethertheless , even if somewhat obvious . 
  read [ reed ] ( verb ) rhymes with lead [ leed ] ( verb ) , read [ red ] ( adjective or past form of the verb ) rhymes with lead [ led ] ( noun ) . 
  look the words up on the dictionary.com for further details . 
  not the same . 
  i mean , same letters , but not the same pronunciation and not the same meaning . 
  `` read '' can be read as [ reed ] ( or `` rid '' in finnish orthography if i 'm not mistaken ) , meaning `` read '' the verb ; or it can be read as [ red ] , meaning `` read '' the verb in past tense . 
  same with `` lead '' : same letters , two pronunciations and several different meanings . 
  so it would read like '' [ rid ] and [ lid ] rhyme and [ red ] and [ led ] rhyme but [ rid ] and [ led ] do n't rhyme , and neither do [ red ] and [ lid ] '' . 
  or , for instance , '' [ red ] and [ led ] rhyme and [ rid ] and [ lid ] rhyme but [ red ] and [ lid ] do n't rhyme , and neither do [ rid ] and [ led ] '' ; there is no way to determine correct pronunciation here because there is no context for those words . 
  that 's english for you  finnish is much more straightforward language regarding pronunciation rules . 
   the orthodoxy is an official and traditional religion in russia, 
  fuck right off . 
  by the constitution , russia is a secular state , and no religion in russia is official or `` traditional '' . 
  as a staunch atheist , i am not going to tolerate this bullshit of yours . 
  i 'm sorry if i 've offended you , may be i just got you mistaken with guys like that ... sorry , could n't find the link right now , but basically it 's a pr agency which 's claiming that it 's pro-putin and state-sponsored ( i found it by one of those recent propaganda clips ) , and one of their points was that there are only four `` official '' religions in russia and any others are not going to be tolerated . 
  this kind of bullshit i just ca n't stand , because just about a century ago the likes of me were prosecuted heavily , and i do n't want it repeating . 
  so please , please , do n't call any religion `` official '' no matter how many top officials follow it , and do n't call any religion `` traditional '' if you mean that this historical fact somehow gives them more rights than any other religion . 
  just do n't . 
   the ukrainians overthrew their own criminal government . 
  please . 
  the crowd in kiev does n't talk for all ukraine , even if it 's really big crowd . 
  that 's what referendums and president votes are for . 
  you know , like the one yanukovich promised to held , just a day before violent neo-nazis stormed government buildings . 
  ( i am * not * saying that it was neo-nazi coup , but some certain parties sure used neo-nazis as storm troops . 
  that ca n't be good . ), 
   of course , i do n't know what do you mean and what happened a century ago, 
  a century ago , you 'd get 8 to 10 years of * katorga * ( penal colony , usually in a place with harsh living conditions ) for leaving orthodoxy . 
  do n't know about you , but i do n't want this repeating . 
  it 's just two mps being asshats . 
  prosecutor 's office [ response  ( http://ria.ru/politics/20150701/1107397194.html ) `` by law , we are obliged to consider all requests that we receive , regardless of their content . 
  it happens that some of them are deprived of common sense . 
  in this case , it is clear that this story does n't have any legal prospects . '', 
  for me , it was simpler . 
  one works , other does n't . 
  sync on mobile onenote is a joke , and after the certain amount of notes it just became too slow , to the point of unusable . 
  looks like a crude attempt at kobza or [ domra ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/domra ) . 
  as long as you speak reasonably good russian and do n't look like central asian , hardly anybody would give a shit . 
  try to wrap your head around the fact that python is much more dynamic than any `` traditional '' compiled language can ever be . 
  that every single statement is executable ( no , ` def ` s and ` class ` es are * not * `` passive '' declarations ) . 
  that python is all about hash tables . 
  namespaces ? 
  hash tables . 
  objects ? 
  hash tables again . 
  all operations are just syntax sugar for special methods dwelling in this or that object 's hash table . 
  ( actually , it 's a little more complicated than that , but that 's a start . ), 
  try tinkering with the internals of python 's object system , read about special methods , define some simple classes that emulate container or function behaviour , read about decorators and imitate them `` by hand '' . 
  maybe that helps . 
  amount of bullshit in you is not healthy . 
  seriously . 
  spotted a couple of typos/mistakes :, 
  there is no way to report content on this site ( even in the full version , which you can open if you remove the `` wap . '', 
  part from the domain name ) . 
  i only managed to find admin email and name : admay@sasisa.ru, maya sanikidze . 
  you should write to her and explain the issue . 
  most probably it 's an abbreviation from '' \u043a \u0432\u0437\u043b\u0451\u0442\u0443 \u043d\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432 '' . 
  meaning `` not ready for takeoff '' . 
   if its not a massacre where armed men murdered thousands of unarmed civilian, 
  what makes you think so ? 
  what exactly ms has to do with b&n 's decision ? 
  no , what makes you think that * anybody * says it was not a massacre ? 
  that 's a great resource i somehow did n't knew about . 
  thanks for the find !, 
   that said , javascript is worse than c++ :-), 
  you obviously did n't saw enough weird template code . 
  but true being an alias for 1 does n't makes sense at all . 
  it 's just legacy thing . 
   well reasoned arguments, 
   bottom line : if god does n't give someone a child , he surely does that for a certain and significant reason . 
  it is a sin to revolt against god 's will , whether a person agrees with it or not . 
  when a creature revolts against the creator it is not only a sin but a sign of insanity and spiritual death . 
  i ca n't even . 
  how about religious people abstain from forcing their beliefs on the society ? 
  name one . 
   nobody is forcing on you anything, 
  `` orthodox church says surrogacy is ` mutiny against god ' , seeks legal ban '', 
  if seeking legal ban for something is n't forcing , i do n't know what is . 
  religious people do n't like surrogate birth , okay , nobody is forcing it on them . 
  but no , they ( some of them at least ) want to force their dislike on the entire society . 
  this is not good and this should not happen in a proper secular state . 
   probably you are obsessed by the idea that non-believers somehow are `` smarter '' and more `` rightful '' than the religious people . 
  and probably your attempts at reading my mind are bound to fail . 
  i 'm pretty sure those were good people , but how exactly are they relevant in this context ? 
  the context is somebody with solutions on the big scale . 
  president-sized . 
  alternative to putin . 
  i 'm not sure how the fact that political activists sometimes can get themselves dangerous enemies ( which is not russia-exclusive , mind you ) is relevant here . 
   if people are being shot for small-scale political activism, 
  they are not . 
  not all , not even a significant percentage . 
  [ it 's not like it is something unique to russia . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_assassinations_in_europe ), 
  [ does n't stop people in other countries , why should it in russia ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_assassinations_in_europe ), 
   it does n't matter if it 's not enough to completely stop the process , it 's hindering it and that is problem that should be addressed .
