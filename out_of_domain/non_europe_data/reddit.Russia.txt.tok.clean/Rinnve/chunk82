  what makes you think that crime is n't being addressed in russia ? 
  [ murder rate is going down , not up . 
  ] ( http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2012/0535/analit09.php ), 
   also in that link , russia has ~ 4x more entries from the 2000s than any other country in that list . 
  oh , this list is anything but precise ; for instance , there are only two journalists mentioned there who were killed in the nineties , and there were way more , as you can check [ here ] ( https://cpj.org/killed/europe/russia/ ) . 
  also , you should account for the size of the country . 
   i heard navalny loves his house so much he wo n't leave it, 
  [ you obviously heard wrong . 
   khodorkovsky prefers switzerland while the chess guy seems to prefer the u.s. 
   opposition leaders . 
  does not compute . 
  toyotas and nissans are everywhere . 
  subaru are quite rare , though . 
   forcible invention of homosexual relationships, 
  * allowing * some people to do something if they want it is in no way forcible . 
   forbid another group ( the believers ) to live according their beliefs, 
  nobody is forbidding `` the believers '' to live as they want . 
  except that 's what `` the believers '' want : they are not okay with the fact that not everyone agrees with their beliefs , so they want to force them on all . 
   in this case it can be either \u0438 or \u043d\u043e . 
   native, 
  not sure if serious . 
  in the first case , some sort of contradiction is implied , unlike the second one . 
   he has assassinated defectors abroad, 
  well , if the cia assassinated some defector , would you say that us president did this ? 
   this is whatoaboutism ( which means that `` yeah , there is stuff wrong at our house but so is in the us so you should direct this discussion to that '' ), 
  no , this is not whataboutism , this is pointing at double standards . 
  you do n't see newspapers around the world holding us president ( or any other leader of a `` good '' country ) personally responsible when some us ( or other country 's ) agency does something shady , yet when it comes to russia , suddenly all becomes very clear : putin is behind everything . 
   why do russian people always try to compare russia to us when they do things wrong ? 
  because the us made them a go-to example of a `` good '' country ; at least in russia . 
  this makes their hypocrisy all more insulting . 
   i 'm not talking about addressing national crime rates , i do n't think that really factor into the issue we 're talking about . 
  you do n't ? 
  well , you should . 
  `` conservativeness '' and `` traditionalism '' has nothing to do with this ; us conservators can teach russians a bit or two about those traits , yet somehow they do n't go out and assassinate their opponents last time i checked . 
  but the legacy of the criminal chaos of the nineties ? 
  the time where assassination was a tool of choice at dealing with competitors , business and politics alike ? 
  now this i think may have something to do with the fact that being opposition politician or a journalist is n't particularly safe occupancy in russia . 
  band of neo-nazi terrorists , business-related assassination , corrupt oligarch 's puppet removing competition ? 
  that 's not `` conservativeness '' and `` traditionalism '' . 
  that 's not russian people writing off some of their own as a `` fifth column '' . 
  that 's just crime . 
   going by that list you provided , germany has the next closet population to russia ( 80million compared to 140million ) , yet germany does n't have anything listed there since 1992 . 
  france has a population of 66million but has only had 4 political murders since the 90s . 
  ukraine has a population of 45million but only has 6 over this time . 
  compared to russia , which has 29 on that list and 140million people . 
  of all those countries , only ukraine shares pretty much the same history . 
  i think that list is so short only because nobody was motivated enough to dig up dirt on ukraine and put it in english-language part of the wikipedia . 
   hmm . . didnt know snowden was already poisoned with polonium or was usa above that kind of evil ? 
  of course they are not above , they just failed to get to him in time . 
  usa 's black sites around the earth , extra-juridical prisons and torture are quite well known . 
  about better ... not sure . 
  in the usa , [ asking police officer `` what is the problem ? '', 
  is apparently a felony . 
  ] ( http://io9.com/5497556/sf-author-peter-watts-found-guilty-of-felony-resistance-against-border-guard ) and this is not an isolated case , there are thousands of cases of similar kind of abuse . 
  i do n't think that a police state is that better than a country slowly crawling out of a dark age of corruption and widespread crime . 
  thank you for proving yet another time that there is no point in arguing with religious persons . 
  you just ca n't think logically . 
  i [ heart ] [ urfu ] ( http://urfu.ru/en/ ), 
  maybe , i was talking about where i live ( tambov region ) , it 's not particularly snowy here . 
  that 's semantics . 
  to find errors like those , you need something on the level of grammarly ( which costs $ 30/month ) . 
  except `` there is no god '' * is * a belief , since it just ca n't be proven or disproven . 
   russian propaganda has built a modern russian identity that revolves around them being the heavenly soviet liberators that freed europe from nazism and they must fight back the demons that try to undo their forefathers ' work, 
  that 's soviet propaganda , actually , there is nothing particularly modern about it . 
  current russian government capitalizes on it , yes , but baltic countries could undermine that pretty easily : by * not * doing what 's expected of them . 
  after all , those monuments do n't do much besides standing there . 
   when some polish folks try to remove the statue of someone , who was responsible for death of polish soldiers, 
  wait , there are stalin statues in poland ? 
  i do n't really think that those monuments are the reason behind the existence of soviet nostalgists . 
  removing the symptoms of the disease never cured the disease itself . 
   what are y' alls thoughts on evernote vs. one note ? 
  onenote mobile ( on windows phone and ipad ) failed me after just about a hundred or so notes : sync just takes ages even on wifi ( and by ages i mean like 30 minutes each time i open the app ) . 
  so for me , there is no choice . 
  just continue practicing it , and do n't let it stop your progress . 
  actually , even if you pronounce '' \u0440 '' as an american english `` r '' , you will be understood perfectly , it 's not a very big deal ( it could sound funny though ) . 
   do you watch movies where the bad guys are russians ? 
  are you offended ? 
  are those movies censored or subtitled differently ? 
  i watch movies and tv shows with english subs without translation for the last several years , so i do n't know . 
  i do n't think so , though . 
  personally , i 'm not offended , since it is true that * some * russians are bad irl . 
  it would be good to see more good russians , but that 's not particularly important for me . 
  a dangerously high amount of [ * klyukva * ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/gloriousmotherrussia ) is what bothers me . 
  sometimes it 's so cringeworthy that i just ca n't continue watching . 
  yes , it is possible , as far as it 's not a weapon . 
  i 'm not sure about laws , apart from that it 's illegal to use military insignias for civilians , but it 's legal to buy and use unmarked uniforms ( actually , it 's pretty common since it 's cheap and durable ) . 
  do n't know about international shipping though . 
  both sites you named look legit . 
  soviet-propaganda is quite overpriced though ; for instance , noch-91m suit costs $ 109 which is about 6100 rubles while in a random russian online store it costs 2600 rubles . 
  [ sure . 
  ] ( http://www.army-store.ru/product/kostyum-noch-91m ), 
  python is turing-complete language that can fully interact with the underlying operating system . 
  theoretically , there are no things that ca n't be done with python . 
  there are things , however , that could be impractical to do ; for instance , doing heavy math lifting in python itself , without using appropriate c libraries ( or python-to-native code compilers ) for doing actual calculations . 
  there are also things that could be impossible due to technical restrictions of the platform , like programming microcontrollers or writing kernel-mode device drivers ( although [ there is at least one board programmed in python ] ( https://micropython.org/ ) , and i think that it could be possible to embed python interpreter into a kernel-mode driver ; for what reason , that 's whole different question ) . 
  for me , yes . 
  i 'm a bit of an information hoarder , so this way i do n't worry about any limits and just clip any interesting info i encounter . 
  offline mobile access is also a must-have for me , although i think it 's available with just plus . 
   or ngos that are helping eradicate aids, 
  '' \u0417 '' confused with '' \u042d '' .
