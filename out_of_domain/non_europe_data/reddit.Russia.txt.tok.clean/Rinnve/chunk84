  read it . 
   i am really interested in taking my notepad + + text files and turning them into executables, 
  python is an interpreted language , so source code remains source code . 
  on windows , python source files ( * . py / * . pyw ) are associated with the python interpreter , so they can be executed by double clicking just like `` real '' programs . 
  anaconda python distribution currently has a bug in the installer so you must associate * . py and * . pyw files yourself ( just google for `` fixing python associations in windows '' ) . 
  if you really want to make . exe files with python , you 'll need additional tools like py2exe . 
  do n't bother with that until you need to distribute your programs . 
  yep . 
  used to fight with my brother over who gets to play first . 
  we also had a zx spectrum clone called [ robik ] ( http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=776 ) , but nobody wanted to wait half an hour while it loads a game from tape recorder . 
  or rather , tries to load a game : robik was extremely buggy . 
  during one fight dad decided that enough is enough and just smashed dendy with a hammer . 
  surprisingly , that helped : my brother and i never fought over anything after that . 
  the key part is paragraph 2 : `` to establish that for the purposes of the procurement of certain types of medical devices included in the list , the customer rejects all requests to participate in the competitive methods of determining the suppliers ( contractors , performers ) containing proposals for the supply of medical products originating from foreign countries , with the exception of the republic of armenia , republic of belarus and the republic of kazakhstan , provided that participation in the definition of the supplier filed not less than 2 satisfying the requirements of the documentation for the purchase of applications that are both :, 
  contain proposals for the supply of one or more types of medical devices included in the list , the country of origin of which is the russian federation , the republic of armenia , the republic of belarus and the republic of kazakhstan ;, 
  does not contain proposals for the supply of the same type of medical device manufacturer . '' ( google translate ) . 
  in simpler terms , when `` the customer '' ( say , a hospital ) calls for bids for some equipment which is on that list , * and * if there are at least two offers from different manufacturers from rusfed/armenia/belarus / kazakhstan , then and only then any offers from other foreign suppliers are rejected . 
  this limit does n't prohibit `` the customer '' from buying any equipment if this requirement for at least two different local offers is not met . 
   the `` limit '' will be reached quickly, 
  it 's a different kind of limit , it can not be `` reached '' . 
  it prohibits buying some kinds of foreign medical equipment if ( and only if ) there are at least two offers from two different local manufacturers that meet required specifications . 
   cant they just . . make their own medicine ? 
  actually , we can and we do . 
  not everything , but still . 
  that 's the reasoning behind the proposed restriction . 
  it basically states that if ( and only if ) there are at least two different local manufacturers who produce stuff that meets required specifications , then foreign offers must be rejected . 
  * edit : a word *, 
  this restriction is for govermental and municipal organizations only . 
  none of those bothered to buy special bandages before that proposal ( since the condition is extremely rare ) , so nothing will change . 
  yulia koptseva bought those by herself in germany . 
  either her words were twisted , or she misunderstood something , or she ( and/or b.i. ), 
  intentionally lied . 
  i hate to admit that , but i think it 's that third ugly option . 
  here are two citations . 
  endangered are patients whose treatment is state-sponcored . '' ) so the treatment is not state-sponsored and state-sponsored at the same time . 
  if you 're willing to play `` russia is corrupt '' card , play it to full extent : bribery wins the bidding battle , so the law will not change anything . 
   he took control of russia 's economy and made it dependent on oil prices . 
  could you please provide some details on how exactly he did it ? 
  it 's not quite clear for me . 
  they are not , because specifications . 
  if the `` strong foreign offer '' can not be specified strictly enough , is it really strong enough ? 
  for instance , it is very easy to call for bids for `` specialty bandages for ` butterfly kids ' '' which do n't peel their skin off . 
  just , you know , list what is expected of the product . 
  what errors do you get ? 
  i installed x64 jdk without any problems , without using compatibility mode . 
  if the train is quiet and you spend there like  2 hours/day , why not ? 
  afaik there are custom on-screen keyboards for android which make typing all those special symbols much less painful , and of course there are external keyboards . 
  qpython looks promising , i think it is quite enough for learning the basics . 
  the only reason i can think of is that you 're trying to run x64 installer on x32 windows . 
  can you post a screenshot of the error message ? 
   but if a lot of some of the russian civilians know of this , do you or the russian people wonder ? 
  the `` what if '' ? . 
  well , there is a plenty of alternative history fiction in russia , so i guess at least some russians do wonder about `` what if '' . 
   do you consider yourselves russians or europeans ? . 
  and why ? 
  both , obviously . 
  russian culture is a part of european culture , russian history is a part of european history , there is little to argue about here . 
   was ukraine ever its own entity ? 
  as in . 
  dating very far back in the past . 
  was there ever ukraine people who spoke its own language and had its own culture and such as opposed to its russian neighbor ? 
  eh , it kinda was , but we have the same roots and lots of shared history . 
  it really ca n't be explained in couple of sentences , you should look up the history of kievan rus ( precursor state for both russia and ukraine ) . 
  as for culture , you have to look real close to find differences between russian and ukrainian cultures . 
  i 'd guess the differences are no larger than between different russian regions ( and i 'm talking about historically russian regions , not tatarstan or bashkortostan ) . 
  languages are different , obviously , though some say that many of the differences were artificial , to invent `` real '' language distinct enough from russian . 
  i 'm no expert in languages , so i have no opinion on that . 
  yes , that 's the error windows shows when you 're trying to run a x64 app on a x86 windows . 
  please make yourself 110 % sure that you 're actually running x64 system ( i myself was in similar situation couple of times , thinking that it 's x64 when it was actually x86 ) . 
  if windows is absolutely , 110 % x64 , then try to re-download the installers . 
  windows can show this error message if the . exe is corrupt for some reason . 
  if you 're using 3rd party antivirus , disable it : it can make windows `` think '' that the . exe file is corrupt . 
  lastly , there may be something wrong with the system itself , in that case you 'll need to reinstall it ( although i 'd bet on corrupt . exe or misbehaving av ) . 
  java itself is 100 % compatible with both x86 and x64 versions of windows . 
  i do n't think this is the reason , at least the main reason . 
  russians also start to study english pretty early , but most of us do n't understand it on the level where subs are n't required . 
  certainly , part of it is that both norwegian and english are in the same language family . 
  but the main reason , i think , is that norwegians have many more chances to practice their english in everyday life . 
  i do n't know if they subtitle films/tv shows instead of dubbing them , but if they do , this also helps immensely . 
  ( hell , i went from zero level of understanding spoken english to somewhere between b2 and c1 just by binge watching some tv series with english subs . ), 
  usually , not very much . 
  it 's pretty `` yellow '' .

  [ nope . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_the_soviet_union ) there is one flag with ussr state emblem ( 5th photo ) , but i think it 's a flag of some organization ( local communist party ? ), 
  there are some nice photos [ here ] ( http://strana.ru/places ) . 
  russian inmate-talk , or rather inmate `` game '' or test . 
  you 're asked if there are two stools , one filled with lances and another with hard cocks , on which do you sit and on what do you seat your mother ( mother theme is pretty big with typical russian inmates ) . 
  the proper answer is `` out of the box '' : take the lances and cut down the cocks . 
  / r/russian, 
   is this the right path for education ? 
  of course it is not . 
   should schools be responsible for making patriots out of children ? 
  `` patriot '' is a loaded word . 
  mindless zombies shouting `` glory to the heroes ! '', 
  are patriots too , but i , for one , do n't want our schools to produce something like that . 
   or should they simply be responsible for providing knowledge and nothing beyond that ? 
  of course not . 
  knowledge is the least important thing school can give . 
  social skills and adaptation ( especially for disabled kids ) , critical thinking , correct self-evaluation , maybe , * maybe * healthy patriotism .
