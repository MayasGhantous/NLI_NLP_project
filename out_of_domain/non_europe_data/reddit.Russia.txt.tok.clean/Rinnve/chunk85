  although i think healthy patriotism is too hard to define correctly for it to be in schools . 
  oh , this is cool . 
  27 days, 
  dial the power down ffs . 
  300-something for about a minute and a half is a sweet spot for neatly warmed up food for one person . 
   the fact that in russian culture its a perfectly normal thing, 
  it 's not perfectly normal . 
  it 's not exactly a red flag , but it 's certainly quite a bit strange , especially being single at that age . 
  could you provide links to those `` many memoirs '' ? 
  not `` citations '' by some other people , but the actual sources ? 
  why i ask ? 
  [ that 's ] ( https://yadi.sk/d/t0a3wmttirg7t ) why . 
  it is a book referenced by that wikipedia article , `` war 's unwomanly face '' by svetlana alexievich . 
  it was published on the author 's site ; it is removed now , but archive.org remembers everything . 
  the article tells that `` it includes memories by soviet veterans '' , but for some unknown reason they forgot to clarify : * female * veterans . 
  `` citation '' about rape is made up . 
  fake . 
  open the book and find the word `` rape '' there . 
  first link : not about alleged `` mass rape '' . 
  second link : by anonymous author . 
  seriously ? 
   you do know wikipedia has this lovely thing called references, 
  svetlana alexievich published a book , war 's unwomanly face that includes memories by soviet veterans about their experience in germany . 
  according to a former army officer ,, 
  `` we were young , strong , and four years without women . 
  so we tried to catch german women and ... 
  ten men raped one girl . 
  there were not enough women ; the entire population run from the soviet army . 
  so we had to take young , twelve or thirteen year-old . 
  if she cried , we put something into her mouth . 
  we thought it was fun . 
  now i can not understand how i did it . 
  a boy from a good family ... 
  but that was me . 
  here is the book in russian on the author 's site : http://www.alexievich.info/knigi/u_voiny.pdf, 
  here is the link to the book in english : http://www.alexievich.info/knigi/thewaren.pdf, 
  ( 404 , but archive.org has several copies of it ) . 
  please , find there this `` reference '' . 
  ` itertools ` module has ` islice ` function which is basically slicing but for any iterable . 
  so your second example becomes :, 
  from itertools import islice, 
  for thing in islice ( bunch_of_things , 4 ) :, 
  print ( thing ), 
  ... who moved to the us when he was 5 . 
  that 's more like russian-born us citizen . 
  ( yes , i think that ethnicity is a cultural thing , not genetic . ), 
  i very much doubt that the parents of sergey brin isolated him from us culture in which he grew up , got an education and so on . 
  i would be very much surprised if he still self-identifies as a russian . 
   greek did have a lot more influence to russian ( thru church slavonic ) than to the other slavic, 
  how exactly it would be possible for greek to influence russian through church slavonic , considering that church slavonic is no more related to greek than russian itself ? 
  ( it is basically an old bulgarian dialect . ), 
  well , it 's a loaded term , but usually [ ethnicity ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ethnicity ) has nothing to do with genetics , it 's about how people self-identify and identify with each other . 
  it quite often coincides with genetic similarity , but it is coincidence ; the us are a great example of single super-ethnicity ( not homogeneous , of course , hence `` super '' ) with multiple genetic backgrounds . 
   oil, 
  butter . 
   sour cream, 
  originally it was '' \u0441\u043b\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u0441\u043b\u043e '' , that 's `` butter '' . 
  caviar with sour cream is a classic , but sour cream ( well , the closest thing ) is '' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430 '' . 
  never . 
  it 's not quite `` rampant '' . 
  thing is , simple averages ca n't into diversity . 
  there is plenty of ( relatively ) healthy old grandpas here , but there is also a significant amount of hardcore alcoholics who die not in their sixties , not even in the fifties , but often in the forties , ruining not only their own lives , but also the statistics . 
   odd is for happy events , even is for sad ones . 
  not exactly . 
  even is for dead people ( funerals ) , odd for living . 
  so it 's not `` if you can '' , it 's a must . 
  tl ; dr : while technically you can have dual citizenship in russia , legally you 're just russian citizen and citizenship of other country means exactly nothing ( except being limitation in some cases like being prohibited from working in government ) . 
  huh . 
  til . 
  [rutracker.org ] ( http://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=465157 ) is your friend . 
  ( there are other similar topics there , use the search . ), 
  `` programming in python 3 '' by mark summerfield is a very good in-depth introduction for people who already know another language . 
  i use the free version and find it pretty useful since it catches common ( for me ) problems like missing articles and commas in wrong places . 
  of course , it 's not perfect , but still it 's far better than ms office ( which is not useful at all ) . 
  even if you pronounce r like l , it 's not a very big problem . 
  sure thing , you 'll get some giggles since mispronouncing r 's is a quite common childish problem ( fixed by \u043b\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434 , speech-problem specialist ) , but in most situations you 'll be understood . 
  simply put , this is a no-problem . 
  proper declensions and conjugations are far , far more important than rolling your r 's . 
  `` it 's an excellent course . 
  henceforth i 'm very lucky to get a place on it . '', 
  really ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  : from this time forward : starting now, 
  synonyms and antonyms of henceforth :, 
  from this point on < henceforth , there will be no more prolonged coffee breaks , 
  synonyms henceforward , hereafter, 
  related words afterward ( or afterwards ) , later , subsequently ; hereupon , thereupon, 
  all religious choices should be respected equally , including atheism , which is choosing to not believe . 
  does it sound better this way ? 
   tldr : funsy anti-oo pro-fp article . 
  did n't read indeed . 
  it 's not `` anti-oo pro-fp '' , it 's pro data oriented design ( and not anti anything particular ) . 
  edit : title is retarded though , in that i agree . 
   what are the hacker news, 
  probably habrahabr.ru and geektimes.ru, 
  yes , it 's quite common . 
  it 's just a gesture to show that she cares about your parents . 
  according to [ wikipedia ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%90%d0%b2%d0%b8%d0%b0%d1%86%d0%b8%d0%be%d0%bd%d0%bd%d1%8b%d0%b9_%d1%88%d0%bb%d0%b5%d0%bc ) , they are for `` reducing the effect of aerodynamic forces during [ emergency ] ejection '' . 
  small correction : it 's not about russian christmas , it 's about russian new year celebrations . 
  christmas in russia is almost strictly a religious holiday , it 's not celebrated nearly as widely , and grandfather frost is n't related to it .
