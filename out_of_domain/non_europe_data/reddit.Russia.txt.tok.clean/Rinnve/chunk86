  eh , why not ? 
  on a more serious note , being motivated to get fit is so good on so many levels . 
  it 's great news . 
  because people are irrational . 
  tl ; dr : `` trapeznik '' is a monk in a monastery whose duties include supervising meals ( so everything is in order ) . 
  also , it could mean a church ... servitor ( ? ), 
  who works as a bell-ringer and a watchman . 
  edit : quick vkontakte search shows that it is n't very common : there are about 3500 vk users with this surname , compared to ~ 200 000 users with `` smirnov '' surname ( one of the most common ) . 
  well , i took [ this photo ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vkx9pjx.jpg ) on 1 may 2015 ( international workers ' day , one of the most important holidays for communists ) . 
   also , do you know what kind of social and cultural standing trapezniks had ? 
  were they part of a local middle class ? 
  uh , i think pretty low standing , so no , not middle class . 
  however , this word is pretty rare and its meaning depends on a local dialect ; in some , it could also mean `` a trader '' ( at least according to [ this book ] ( https://slovari.yandex.ru/~%d0%ba%d0%bd%d0%b8%d0%b3%d0%b8/%d0%a4%d0%b0%d0%bc%d0%b8%d0%bb%d0%b8%d0%b8.%20%d0%9d%d0%b8%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%bd%d0%be%d0%b2/ ) ) . 
  let it evolve . 
  evernote is n't some elite club you must enter . 
  if notability and/or google docs are better for your specific use case , there is no point to force yourself on en . 
  for me , the killer app is web clipper . 
  it 's simply unmatched , and i love the possibility to save an interesting page or a fragment for later use without worrying about website going out of service or a page being removed ( happened multiple times before with bookmarks and diigo ) . 
  what everyone forgets is that strelkov never had any social media accounts and he specifically told months before mh17 that the only legit source of information is icorpus.ru . 
  [ here is one example ] ( http://icorpus.ru/zayavlenie-strelkova-bespoletnuyu-zonu/ ) of separatist leaders claiming this vk group is used to spread false information . 
  about drinking , exposure and culture . 
  simply put , dont drink vodka when there 's nothing to eat , it is supported to be drank with some substantial meals . 
  and , of course , each man has his own limits . 
  not going past them is an important part of the drinking culture ( ofc some people will try to push you through , those are n't good people and you should stay clear of them ) . 
  kind of proud , yeah . 
  kind of ashamed too , we could achieve so much more if not for obvious stupid reasons like corruption , backwardness and , uh , being much bigger than it is optimal for effective human development . 
  sadly , an average russian is terrible with foreign languages . 
  there is very little exposure in everyday life , and languages are nigh impossible to learn without exposure , so any english or german learnt in the school dies out pretty quickly . 
  actually , that was harder to understand than random bulgarian site/forum . 
  latin script with all those funny letters is hard , apparently . 
  it is understandable , but no way in hell it is easily understandable . 
  kind of another foreign slavic language , and we have quite a few already . 
  huh ? 
  do n't overgeneralize . 
  obviously , not all russians are corrupt ; that does n't mean that corruption is n't a major problem in russia . 
  just the same , not all russians are backward , but it is quite visible , especially in smaller cities . 
  ca n't stand it . 
  some say there is tasty vodka ( like beluga ) , but i 'm not willing to experiment when i can buy decent scotch or rum for the same price . 
  old monk is the shit . 
  there is / r/russian for questions about russian language . 
  anyways , yes , it is slang curse word ( not on the f-bomb level , though ) . 
  it means that you have very low skills in something ( computer games , usually ) . 
  you should not . 
  well , not unless you see it for yourself . 
  yup , it 's annual [ bison track show ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce5wdl_ynbu ) , rostov-on-don , russia . 
  nope they do n't . 
  this article is bullshit : since 2014 , math exam is split to basic and advanced levels . 
  basic is a sanity check for people who do n't need advanced math in the university . 
  advanced level is actually [ quite hard ] ( http://math.reshuege.ru/test?id=8488709 ) . 
   then russia is discriminating all minorities as well . 
  wrong . 
  minority languages have the status of second official language in the regions where said minorities live . 
  any official business in tatarstan can be conducted in tatar language . 
  same in the baltic 's neighbour , finland , that have swedish as the second official language for a tiny minority . 
  the other difference is that russian minority in baltic states is anything but tiny . 
  baltic position is this : `` we do n't want to have russian latvians/lithuanians/estonians , either you become us , or gtfo '' . 
  this position is understandable , it is also as unproductive as it gets . 
  russians lived in estonia long before ussr became a thing , although in smaller numbers . 
  if there is enough vertical space for two lines , it would be the best option . 
  you should use a hyphen , though , like this :, 
  nope . 
  they can own [ premium ( award ? ), 
  weapon ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9d%d0%b0%d0%b3%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%b4%d0%bd%d0%be%d0%b5_%d0%be%d1%80%d1%83%d0%b6%d0%b8%d0%b5 ) if they were awarded with it , though , but only handguns can be awarded ( at least according to the current laws ) . 
  challenges :, 
  nothing particularly finance-related , though . 
  \u042f \u0432\u044b\u0438\u0433\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e is a continuous form ( i am winning ) . 
  in some kind of competition , you can say \u042f \u0432\u044b\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b after winning . 
  i 'm not sure how to express `` but also that i will ultimately be victorious in the future '' bit ( although i 'm not sure `` i win '' could mean that too ) . 
  i think you could say \u042f \u043f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c ( i 'm [ a/the ] winner/victor ) , this probably would be the closest one to what you want . 
  pls no . 
  it could be contagious . 
  this looks amazing . 
  could you tell how it was configured , please ? 
  you should read [ this book ] ( http://www.amazon.com/code-language-computer-hardware-software/dp/0735611319 ) . 
  the best explanation of how computers work i know of . 
  the ones that are interesting for you . 
  i went from `` can only read subtitles '' to `` do n't really need subs at all '' with the help of `` buffy the vampire slayer '' and `` angel '' ; your mileage may vary . 
  / u/igorfazlyev is right , though , there is no point in watching tv series if you ca n't , at least , understand the subtitles . 
  in russia . 
  in moscow [ it 's about 60k rubles ] ( http://www.dni.ru/economy/2015/7/21/309811.html ) , or about 850 $ . 
   the ban on underwear with less than 6 % cotton was put in effect in february 2014 . 
  [ except there is no such ban . 
  ] ( http://www.rg.ru/2014/02/17/gigroskopichost-site-anons.html ) i guess the word `` hygroscopicity '' is too complex for the modern media , it is easier to invent things instead . 
  do you honestly see no difference between `` the ban on underwear with less than 6 % cotton '' and `` the ban on underwear with less than 6 % hygroscopicity '' ? 
   you claim that the statement about `` underwear with less than 6 % cotton has been banned in russia '' is a lie . 
  it is not . 
  it is a lie because there is n't even the word `` cotton '' in the text of the ban , it is not about cotton at all . 
  for instance , the video op posted makes a conclusion that the ban actually is a ban on western-made underwear ( because they do n't use cotton ) , so russian will be able to buy only un-sexy cotton-made underwear ; but in reality ( as the article in rg explains ) most manufacturers make underwear that complies with this new standard , except very cheap models which are basically plastic . 
   when western liberals hear something like this , then they cringe for a very simple reason ; it limits personal freedom . 
  the basic freedom to choose which kind of underwear is best for you . 
  there are quality standards in all countries , and for a very simple reason : so the people wo n't harm themselves . 
   the law implies that the citizen is unable to make the right decision by themselves, 
  that 's because they * are * unable . 
  this is the very same reason why all other standards of quality exist . 
  also , a lot of russians objected against this law because many media outlets invented the news from a non-event . 
   clothes are only made of a select few fabrics ( underwear of even fewer for reasons related to comfort ) . 
  so when you ban underwear incapable of soaking up liquids , then it also implies that other materials ( capable of doing so ) has to be in the product . 
  this is becoming ridiculous . 
  first , it 's not `` on/off '' , there are different levels of hygroscopicity . 
  second , it 's not only polyester and cotton but also nylon , elastane and polyamide .
