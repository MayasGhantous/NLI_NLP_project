  third , even those synthetic materials have non-zero hygroscopicity , so cotton is not required : 6 % hygroscopicity is pretty low , only very cheap polyester-based fabrics fall below that . 
  you 're oversimplifying things to make it easier to push your point . 
  this is bad . 
   quality regulation is something the company does itself to ensure that the quality of all it 's products are of equal standard - not something a country does . 
  you 're lying again , why ? 
  there are all kinds of quality standards in the eu and the us , not all are mandatory , but still . 
   making laws to prevent harmful products is also something else , as there 's no major health concerns when it comes to underwear unable to soak up liquid . 
  there * are * health concerns . 
  or do you think the ban was put just for shit and giggles ? 
   the opinion you express that people are unable to make the right choice themselves , is one that 's been defined as the definitive ideological difference between `` the west and east '', 
  there is nothing ideological in this opinion . 
  people ca n't be experts in everything , it 's that simple . 
   but i 'll leave you with this one thing ; if you knew one apple was sprayed with harmful bug poison , and another was pure . 
  would you knowingly pick the `` poisoned apple '' ? 
  thanks for demonstrating my point about people not being experts in everything : it so happens that i know that many bug poisons are harmless for mammals , humans included . 
  ( not all such poisons are harmless , though , so some further investigation would be required , of course . ), 
  other people could be easily scared off by `` poison '' . 
   the general conception in most western countries is that information is key to make people make the right decision, 
  yes , it is . 
  thing is , there is too much information in the modern world , and most people are simply incapable of processing it all in order to make an educated choice . 
   and tell me , are cigarettes or alcohol banned in russia ? 
  i dare say both are significantly more harmful than wet panties . 
  they are also significantly harder to ban . 
  we 're working on it , though .

   the first thing we end up doing everytime someone has some weird bug is telling them to get sublime or pycharm . 
  eh , idle is n't quite as feature-loaded as , say , pycharm , but i ca n't remember any `` weird bugs '' caused by it . 
  could you give an example or two ? 
  anyways , there is no alternative to it which is just as lightweight and dependence-less . 
  works fine for me ( windows 10.0.10586 ) . 
  not russia , only the free port of vladivostok ( whatever that could mean , the city itself or nearby regions too ) . 
  i second the advice about turtle . 
  concentrate on basic algorithmic structures and integer math ( mostly for loop counters : i firmly believe that while loop should be taught before for , it is easier to explain and to understand what exactly happens there ) . 
  also you should teach basics of functions rather early ; parametrized drawing would fit rather well here . 
  teach them how to draw a tree , say , and then wrap it in a function that draws trees of different size , then throw in a loop and some random may be ( kids love random for some reason ) and make a forest grow . 
  source : i 'm a comp sci teacher in mid and high school . 
  lpthw is very , very opinionated and also not that useful , honestly . 
  i 'd recommend automate the boring stuff instead , or if you 're feeling serious , programming in python 3 by summerfield . 
  actually , i do n't think that the udemy course is worth it . 
  well , unless it 's much easier for someone to watch the video vs. reading the book . 
  there are no exercises in the course ( there are in the book ) , and the videos basically repeat material in the book . 
   it 's still one of the best python books ever written, 
  it 's decent , maybe , but one of the best ? 
   c # is explicitly an iso standard, 
  c # 2.0 is an iso standard , later versions are not . 
  you are not correct . 
  ukrainian is close to russian , but it 's still too different to be considered `` a form of russian '' , just a slang . 
  ( it was considered as such during imperial times , though , if i 'm not mistaken , but the reason was clearly political , not scientific . ), 
   what other bussiness venture or technology has russia created in the last decade besides its oil exports, 
  flip a coin , really . 
  both books are quite good ( i ca n't stand lpthw style , though , and it 's teaches python 2 ) . 
  the most important thing is to practice . 
  do exercises from the book , make your own toy projects , start learning flask or django as soon as you can read [ tutorials ] ( http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world ) and understand what 's happening there . 
  well , the op stated that web development is a priority for him , and those two frameworks are most common . 
  [ this is a good article . 
  ] ( https://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/03/03/what-is-a-web-framework/ ) in a few words , web frameworks automate routine things : structuring the site , generating html code from content in a database , etc. 
   stalin was a socialist-nationalist, 
  come again ? 
  how exactly stalin was a nationalist ? 
   russians do n't like english in everyday conversations, 
  not exactly , no . 
  most russians just do n't know english that good . 
  as for racism , watch [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wni6jux3krg ) . 
  first-hand experience . 
  i teach this way , because for beginners ( i mean * real * beginners , with no background in programming ) it is hard enough to wrap their heads around the idea of iterating over a sequence of numbers . 
  it may be not very pythonic , but this way of iteration is simple * and * flexible enough so they do n't anything else for a quite long time . 
  i do n't train python programmers , though , i teach computer science in a high school . 
  and yes , i tried more pythonic approach . 
  it is just a bit too much . 
  the only law about encryption in russia is about certification of encryption tools used for sensitive data ( government , banks , etc. ), 
  nobody cares about your encrypted smartphone or notebook . 
  there are rules for importing devices that have cryptographic capabilities , though . 
  they are not applied for personal belongings when entering the country , but some people did experience problems when ordering smartphones from abroad . 
  you can right-click this and copy the selector .

  as of 2014 :, 
  - gdp - 1860 billion dollars ( [ source ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/russia/gdp ) ), 
  - crude oil exports - 153887 million dollars ( [ source ] ( http://www.cbr.ru/statistics/print.aspx?file=credit_statistics/crude_oil.htm ) ), 
  - oil products - 115874 million dollars ( [ source ] ( http://www.cbr.ru/statistics/print.aspx?file=credit_statistics/oil_products.htm ) ), 
  - natural gas exports - 55240 million dollars ( [ source ] ( http://www.cbr.ru/statistics/credit_statistics/print.aspx?file=gas.htm ) ), 
  17 % it is . 
   never mind the countless people who have gone months without their wages and pensions being paid . 
  it 's 2016 out there , not 1996 . 
  as i said , it 's 2016 , not 1996 . 
  second article somehow failed to mention that those teacher started to protest after two or three * weeks * without payment , not months ( [ source ] ( http://flashsiberia.com/news/k-zabastovke-zabaykalskih-uchiteley-gotovy-prisoedinitsya-ih-kollegi ) ) . 
  i ca n't find the source for the first case right now , but i 'm pretty sure it 's similar situations . 
  there were a couple of regions which experienced problems in last two months of 2015 , but `` countless people without wages and pensions for months '' ? 
  nonsense . 
  i have n't worked with opencv , but after quick skim through the tutorials it seems that they utilize numpy arrays ( scipy also is based upon numpy ) , so that should n't be a problem . 
  basically , numpy arrays are very efficient for number crunching , much more so than standard python lists or arrays ; they are also more complex to use , though . 
   the matlab code i have checks to make sure the correct number of inputs to the function and takes action . 
  do i have to do something similar in python ? 
  or will it just throw an error ? 
  how does function overloading work in python in general ? 
  there is no function overloading in python . 
  however , there could be any number of optional arguments accessible through \\* args and \\*\\* kwargs ( for unnamed and named arguments respectively ) . 
  there are plenty of tutorials out there , but basically you do it like this :,
