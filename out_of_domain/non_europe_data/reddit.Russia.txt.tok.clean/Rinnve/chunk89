  as of [ 05.11.2014 ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%98%d0%bc%d0%bc%d0%b8%d0%b3%d1%80%d0%b0%d1%86%d0%b8%d1%8f_%d0%b2_%d0%a0%d0%be%d1%81%d1%81%d0%b8%d1%8e#.d0.a2.d0.b5.d0.ba.d1.83.d1.89.d0.b0.d1.8f_.d1.81.d1.82.d0.b0.d1.82.d0.b8.d1.81.d1.82.d0.b8.d0.ba.d0.b0 ) . 
  basically , that 's because second person in modern english is plural only . 
  `` you '' could refer to a person you 're talking with , or to a group of persons ; all the grammatical constructions would be exactly the same . 
  english used to have singular form , [ `` thou '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thou#comparison ) . 
   but the reason you 're poor is because people who have no right to your money nevertheless claim it for themselves and funnel it to their personal offshore accounts . 
  what a load of bull . 
  the reason you 're poor now is that you do n't know how to adapt and self-educate . 
  i do n't know about ukraine , but in russia there are plenty of possibilities to get ... well , maybe not exactly rich , but at least not poor . 
   text is data is bytes is a string . 
  except that 's just plain wrong . 
  the world is n't limited to english-speaking countries . 
   the 30-40 million people killed, 
   logic matters, 
  i ca n't even . 
  it is n't really surprising . 
  hint : ussr demography data is openly available . 
  1 ) [ poverty is n't that common in russia . 
  ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/g/r.aspx?c=rs&amp;v=69 ), 
  2 ) education in russia is free ( unless you already have been graduated and want to get another degree ) . 
  one still needs to pass the entry exams , though . 
  3 ) being drafted at 23 is quite a bit different from being drafted at 18 . 
  that said , from what i know , not many people now bother with the whole `` avoiding the draft '' business . 
  quite a few guys actually choose a military career ( that is , they go to military colleges ) . 
  / r/exposureporn, 
  python does n't support multiple threads ( at least the default implementation of it ) . 
  it is , though , very well engineered language with little ambiguity , great infrastructure and vast high-quality libraries . 
  that said , it 's not very fair to compare python with js . 
  for example , the go-to method of solving performance problems of python ( rewriting bottleneck code in c ) is simply unavailable for js for obvious reasons . 
  i believe selenium is what you need . 
  automate the boring stuff book has a chapter on it . 
  selenium certainly can open a gui ( a real browser , actually ) and let user interact with it . 
  though i have that feeling that the op needs also to programmatically control pages too ; that would be quite tricky with usual embeddable web browser widgets . 
  it is worth buying only if you 're more comfortable watching video lectures than reading the book . 
  it 's pretty much the same material ; actually , i believe that the book covers a bit more than the udemy course . 
  [ about that class example ... ] ( http://dirtsimple.org/2004/12/python-is-not-java.html ), 
  extorted ? 
  evernote is a business , they are not obliged to provide * any * free service . 
  or any support to potential customers . 
  yes , you read that right : unless you 're paying , you 're not a customer . 
   you have also given users no reasonable incentive whatsoever to pay for your service . 
  except being the only cloud information organizer that actually works ? 
  it does n't work , unless all you have there is a couple of notes . 
  i have about a thousand webclips , pdfs and whatnot now in my evernote , and it works perfectly . 
  i used onenote , and was forced to migrate to evernote after ~ 400 notes because the former just does n't work . 
  sync takes ages , it crashes constantly , it is simply unusable . 
  one year `` evernote is dead , or is it ? '', 
   i have temporarily tried out a myriad of alternatives with much better features for a much better price, 
  name a couple , please , that have working mobile sync ( as in `` not having to wait a couple of hours each time i open the app '' ) and usable web clipping tool . 
  have you ever used evernote web clipper ? 
  last time i checked , google keep 's clipper was nowhere near . 
  do you pay for all three ? 
  why ? 
  [ still saves only text for me for some reason . 
  there were/are ads in the free desktop client ? 
  i must 've missed that . 
   it 's performance can be slow, 
  that 's deal breaker , for me anyway . 
  i simply ca n't use a note taking software that ca n't be used almost immediately after opening . 
  sync takes forever ( couple of hours easily when i have n't touched a device for a week ) . 
  and yes , it crashes from time to time at least on my windows phone and old ipad mini when opening large notes . 
  onenote is great * potential * competitor ( again , in my use case ) . 
  they do improve it , and i still try it from time to time ; it 's still not there , though . 
   the entire point of evernote is to sync notes across multiple devices, 
  i 'm sorry , but the entire point of evernote is and always was superb information management and organization . 
  you can throw anything into it : pdf , web clip , typed note , a photo ; and it never gets lost with minimum amount of effort . 
  there are tons of simple and free ( or cheap ) note-taking apps with sync capability . 
  evernote is on a whole different level . 
   i can not trust evernote with my data, 
   i will be switching to onenote and keep, 
  please do explain your exit strategy if one of those gets discontinued or otherwise unavailable . 
  enex file format is clearly defined ; working with it is could be complicated , but it 's doable , proven by the existence of open source tools . 
  onenote file format is incredibly complicated , the latest definition is 110 pages long , and no open source client is in sight . 
  taking out keep data gives you a bunch of offline web pages . 
  i have n't worked with keep extensively , but i do n't see how any semblance of structure could be exported this way . 
  in other words , you should always have a backup and an exit strategy for every conceivable outcome , no matter how paranoid it could sound . 
  or , at least , for most obvious negative outcomes , like having your favorite online service being discontinued by `` effective managers '' , or being banned for no reason . 
   evernote ? 
  not so sure . 
  [ evernote has clearly documented export file format . 
  ] ( https://blog.evernote.com/tech/2013/08/08/evernote-export-format-enex/ ), 
  [ onenote 's file format is also documented ] ( https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd924743\\ ( v = office .12 \\ ) . aspx ) , but it 's much more complex . 
  i 've been looking for alternatives for years now . 
  i hate for my knowledge base to be locked in a proprietary solution ( even considering that there are exit strategies ) , but evernote web clipper is simply unmatched . 
  do n't underestimate yourself , try it . 
  i 'd bet you 'll be surprised . 
  one less freeloader . 
  good . 
  read his comments . 
  loudest complainers are the people who would never pay for evernote , yet they somehow feel that evernote owes them something . 
  `` if i paid for every online tool i ever used i 'd be joke broke . 
  esp when there 's competitive products out there . '' so yeah , good riddance . 
   while not being obviously better . 
  it is obvious for anyone who tried to use evernote to the full , and then tried to find an alternative . 
  the only app that comes * somewhere * near is onenote , and it has a lot of problems of its own . 
  look up other parts also ; there were five in total . 
  tl ; dw : yes , there is racism in russia , but it usually is not what you would think of , and most targets are not `` people of color '' , but people from caucasus region and from central asian countries . 
  what exactly is `` bullshit '' in my previous comment ? 
  what you need is [ this ] ( https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter11/ ) . 
  specifically , the part about controlling the browser with the selenium module . 
   hidden , implicit conversions in scripted languages,
