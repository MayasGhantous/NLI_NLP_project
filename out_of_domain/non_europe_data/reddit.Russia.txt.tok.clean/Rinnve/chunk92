  for destro , immolate is not only a source of damage but also the main resource generator . 
  in aoe situations , for example , keeping immolations rolling is required for steady stream of soulshards for rain of fire . 
  if trash dies so fast dots do n't even tick couple of times , you can just faceroll , it would n't affect your performance . 
  party up or roll a soloing class ? 
  this is multiplayer game , after all . 
  as a warlock , i 'm glad there is a zone that presents at least * some * challenge . 
  esdf keybind , maybe ? 
  there is the `` unlearned recipes '' tab in the crafting window , you can check there what you miss . 
  there is a potion for running on water from draenor alchemy , that 's it as far as i know . 
  tempest keep main boss can drop a pretty cool mount ( phoenix ) . 
  drop rate is low , about 1 % per kill ( once in a week ) , but at least it takes like 5 mins flying there , hearing out overly talkative kael ` thas and oneshotting him . 
  you can also do `` glory of *** raider '' achievements for guaranteed mounts , check wowhead for which ones are soloable ( from the top of my head there is a nice dragon for the cata achievement which can be done in like a couple hours ) . 
  there is the order hall upgrade that enables manufacturing upgrades for order resources . 
  i 've been enjoying affliction immensely so far . 
  it 's not ability-heavy , but it requires some finesse to deal respectable dps ( not wasting cooldowns refreshing dots too soon , appropriate usage of compounding horror , planning ahead soul spending , little things like that ) . 
  if you like to have gazillion button to press , go demo : it 's so ridiculous in that sense you literally ca n't do proper rotation without at least 25 % haste ( well , 20 % if you have godlike reaction and latency ) . 
  not my cup of tea though . 
  sadly , engi is gutted . 
  the only unique thing is dat rocket boost you put on boots , and it 's like three expansions old . 
  legion toys are extremely expensive and unrewarding . 
  i ditched it after all in favor of money making professions ( depends on your server , tailoring for mine before undercutting bots took over , herbalism now ) . 
  toys or no toys , sitting on top of piles of gold without even trying feels good . 
  messed up stats would be my first guess . 
  check respectable sites like icy veins for what is good for your spec . 
  more often than not getting that thing just because it has higher ilvl is not wise . 
  you can gather legion herbs from level 1 , after some gathering time ( random ) you 'll get quests to make legion gathering more efficient . 
  do n't bother with pre-legion herbs . 
  alchemy profitability depends on the server , often it 's bad and you 'll make more money just selling herbs . 
  just check the auction for what herbs are most valued on your server . 
  if sow the seeds is chosen , spread agony to 3-4 targets for ss generation and spam seed . 
  otherwise just multidot , with one seed thrown in to spread corruption . 
  evernote bugridden ? 
  say what again ? 
  i mean sure there are little bugs here and there , but at least it works as intended most of the time and is actually usable . 
  this much ca n't be said about any alternatives i 've tried . 
  those were either too primitive and lacking , super buggy , or onenote ( which is actually fine if you 're okay with mobile syncing taking half an hour each time ) . 
  i 'm sorry , but any `` quicksort '' that copies parts of the array is not a quicksort , it 's a strange hybrid of qucksort and mergesort combining the worst of both and throwing out best parts . 
  here 's my ( limited ) experience as a smoker ( 15 years 0,3 to 1 pack a day ) . 
  i went for ego aio as it 's praised as a go to device for quitting smoking . 
  it is true , am vaping for a week already , no need to return to analog whatsoever . 
  do n't go for big clouds , what you need is tight mouth to lung inhale . 
  i 've tried 0.5 , 0.6 and 1.0 coils on my device , 1.0 works much better , 0.5 is just way too much vapor ( surprisingly , 0.6 is closer to 1.0 than to 0.5 , so it 's not linear ) . 
  juice matters too , go for something tobacco-like . 
  joyetech usa tobacco works for me . 
  personally , i 'd recommend buying an aio since it 's cheap , it just works , it can be used for both mtl and ( with 0.5 coil ) direct lung , so you can experiment and decide what you want . 
  horribly inefficient compared to what ? 
   unicode and utf-8 just do n't make anything simple, 
  that 's because human languages are n't simple . 
  pretending the whole world speaks english or at least uses latin-based alphabets is just silly . 
  say what again ? 
  do n't know about . net , but python 3 and java support utf-8 pretty well , afaik . 
  so , `` horribly inefficient for some latin-based scripts '' . 
  that 's not even all european countries . 
  ever heard of cyrillic or greek ? 
  what would be a right decision , assuming all the different writing system people use around the world ? 
  cyrillic has less characters than latin one , but they are all different . 
  they woud n't fit together in a simplistic 8-bit encoding table . 
  then comes greek , hebrew , arabic and whatnot . 
  so , huge encoding table where most latin letters are encoded multiple times for each latin-based alphabet and the word `` information '' would be encoded differently depending on the language of the text ? 
   compared to any encoding that is context-aware . 
  like ? 
  except the word `` information '' means exactly the same in english and in french . 
  and if you need to encode not a meaningful word , but just a bunch of latin letters , there could be huge problems . 
  like , i dunno , user failing to enter the password correctly because while the physical keyboard was the same , and the letters were the same , but the language was selected wrongly . 
  this idea probably would remove a bunch of unicode difficulties , but it would create a lot of other difficulties of its own . 
  if you 're motivated enough to quit smoking , vaping certainly helps . 
  some tips from a vaping newbie ( i 've done pretty extensive research before though ) . 
  been smoking for 15 years , dropped it after started vaping and only touched cig once - and threw the whole pack away after couple inhales , the taste was unbearably bad . 
  what you need is so-called mtl ( mouth to lung ) setup that imitates analog cig . 
  ego aio is made exactly for that , nice cheap little thing , dead simple to use , just follow the instructions precisely . 
  there are other models too , just search for mtl . 
  you will also need liquid with nicotine at 6 or 12 mg/ml depending on how much you smoke . 
  i use joyetech usa mix , it 's kind of tobacco flavor ( not really there though , there are no flavors that imitate analog cigs completely , so just go for something you like ) . 
  do it gradually . 
  first , try to substitute smoking with vaping completely , do n't try to limit nicotine intake ( watch it though , 10 puffs equals about 1 cig ) . 
  vape whenever you feel the need to smoke . 
  after you do n't need cigs anymore , start using liquids with lower nicotine . 
  it would take months , but people do quit this way . 
  mtl inhale , pretty close to a cig , dead easy in use , small . 
  refill the liquid as required , replace coil once a couple weeks , that 's it . 
  no control whatsoever though , amount of vapor follows battery . 
  bit more expensive alternative could be cubis pro with whatever box mod ; aio is pretty much cheapish cubis from what i gather ( i did n't use it myself , but vaping gear is n't rocket science ; aio uses the same principle as cubis and the same coils , so it must be pretty close ) . 
  i think you burned the head . 
  the proper procedure is [ shown here ] ( https://youtu.be/t0wppunvxz4?t=46 ) . 
  did you follow it ? 
  another reason for bad taste might be bad liquid . 
  i 've found the hard way that some flavours that try to imitate tobacco fail at it . 
  horribly . 
  about heating , this device is n't really meant to be used for 5 + mins non-stop . 
  you can buy longer drip tip , i do n't think anything else could be done about it . 
  just change the head . 
  you ca n't fix burned head . 
  ( well , some wash it with alcohol , sometimes it helps . ), 
  it is actually more ukrainian than belarusian ( well , it is now at least ; there are more vk users in ukraine with that surname ) . 
  this does n't means much though , because people moved a lot between ukraine , belarus and russia ; the idea of those being completely different countries is very new . 
  it does n't have any specific meaning ; from what i gather , it is related to the christian name '' \u0418\u043e\u0430\u043d\u043d '' and it 's slavic variant '' \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d '' . 
  according to [ the wikipedia ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%98%d0%b2%d0%b0%d0%bd ) , '' \u042f\u0441\u044c '' is a diminutive form of that name used in belarus . 
  '' \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d '' is the modern version of '' \u0418\u043e\u0430\u043d\u043d '' , the latter sounds `` medieval '' . 
  do you mean something like [ this ] ( https://i.github-camo.com/050c10a10dd7f4783afcc5ceecfa08040b6515f9/68747470733a2f2f6769746875622e636f6d2f6d61726b2d6861686e2f6c6976652d617263686976652f626c6f622f6d61737465722f73637265656e73686f74732f6c6976652d617263686976652e6769663f7261773d74727565 ) ? 
  ( that 's atom , if you 're interested . ),
