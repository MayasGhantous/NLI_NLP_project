  ijust 2 / ijust s. subohm direct to lung . 
  ego aio with 0.5 ohm coils can do dtl too , although its 2ml built-in tank could be a bit too small . 
  on a plus side , aio is really small and leak-proof . 
   somehow water vapor feels like smoke from notebook paper, 
  vapor could be harsh with high nic level , but it certainly should n't taste like real smoke , like something burnt . 
  maybe you 've burned the the wick and did n't notice it . 
  thing is , you do n't just fill the device with liquid and start vaping immediately . 
  this way the coil heats up too much and burns the wick , hence the horrible burnt taste . 
  you should put several drops on the wick ( how much and where exactly depends on the device ) and preferably wait for several minutes so the wick is soaked properly . 
  ( this concerns only new coils which were never used . ), 
  mixing different flavours probably would be not the best idea . 
  even changing liquid without cleaning the tank sometimes creates strange flavour combinations . 
  mixing with flavourless base liquid is safe . 
  ( base liquids are pv/vg/nicotine mixes intended for diy ) . 
  there are many kits that are cheap , require little to no knowledge , and work . 
   are these books easily available in putin 's russia ? 
  not only easily available , but some of them actually are in the mandatory reading list in the high school program . 
  [ gulag archipelago was included there by putin 's order . 
   r. w. davies and stephen g. wheatcroft, 
   these westerners claimed it was a genocide, 
  i do n't think davies and wheatcroft actually claimed that . 
  their main work on this topic ( `` the years of hunger '' ) is not even remotely in that area . 
   with no way to alter voltage or anything, 
  i think your problem is right there . 
  you should get a proper box mod with the ability to control wattage . 
  then you will see if you need a new tank too . 
  joyetech vtwo mini ( replaceable battery ) , eleaf ipower ( built-in 5000 mah battery ) , something like that . 
  pre-built coil heads usually have it written on them , like [ this ] ( https://www.misthub.com/products/eleaf-ijust-2-replacment-coil-head ) . 
  you should n't start from the maximum setting , though , it may be too hot . 
  oh , and it seems that tfv8 is a high-powered tank , you would want appropriately high-powered mod ( 150 + ) . 
  the mods i 've listed are 75-80 watt . 
  [ here is a discussion ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/4pv42b/best_mod_to_use_the_new_smok_tfv8/ ) for you to read . 
  i 've been using aio for about a month , it got me off the cigs after 15 years of smoking . 
  0.6 ohm coils are perfectly fine for that . 
  the air intake in these coils is thin enough for mtl ( ciga-like ) inhale . 
  1.0 / 1.5 ohm coils could produce too little vapor , especially if the device is n't fully charged . 
  that depends on the smoker , though ; i 've tried all types of coils , 0.6 work the best for me , othe people like 1.5 , 1.0 or even 0.5 ohm coils . 
  it is the problem with the tank . 
  cubis pro and cubis have some issues with spitting and dry hits . 
  spitting issue can be solved by using spiral mouthpiece like [ this ] ( https://www.totallywicked-eliquid.co.uk/tw-ego-aio-mouthpiece.html ) . 
  on my ego aio ( which is basically cubis with built-in battery ) i 've found that 0.6 ohm coils spit a lot less than 0.5 ohm . 
  random dry hits though ... 
  personally , i 've had enough of that shit and bought ijust 2 . 
  no dry hits whatsoever , almost no spitting , all in all much better experience . 
  ( since you already have regulated battery , you would n't need ijust 2 kit , only the tank . ), 
   manage means '' man of age '', 
   does this mean the title manager is sexist in nature ? 
  no , that just means that your granpda likes to spread some bullshit from time to time . 
  words `` manager '' , `` to manage '' etc. 
  originate from italian word `` maneggiare '' , which ( then ) meant handling a horse . 
  watch closely .

   the number of bits in the numbers you are sorting , which is proportional to log ( n ), 
  the length of numbers to sort is not related at all to the amount of numbers to sort . 
  in fact , in most cases it is fixed . 
   some quicksort variations are o ( n2 ) worst, 
  some ? 
  i thought it is the case with all quicksort variations , and the best one could achieve is to make degeneration to n ^ 2 highly unlikely . 
  huh , til . 
  thanks . 
  i 'm not sure , but it very well could be . 
  i have n't used p900 , but i 've used b700 , and its image stabilization is absolutely mind-blowing . 
  just compare those : `` completed task '' vs `` complete task '' . 
  `` i 've completed the task '' vs. . . 
  i do n't even know , `` the task i 've had is now complete '' ? 
  unnatural and artificial . 
  so the former , certainly . 
  evernote ( at least windows and os x versions ) keep all notes in the local database too , so you can just schedule a backup with the backup tool of your choice . 
  i use simple file-based backup tool called create synchronicity which copies evernote database to another local drive on a daily schedule . 
  both folders are also watched by crashplan which copies them ( with a bunch of other important stuff ) to the crashplan cloud storage . 
  you know who else was an avid reader well known for his enormous library ? 
  [ stalin . 
  ] ( https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/joseph-stalin-bloody-tyrant-and-bookworm-1.2798051 ), 
  no you did n't . 
  the proper conclusion would be that amount of reading has no correlation at all to , ah , humanly qualities of the reader whatsoever . 
  propaganda is not another word for fake news . 
  not any fake news is intended as propaganda ( for instance , some may be invented just for generating ad clicks ) ; and also there are other methods of propaganda besides fake news ( bias , lying by omission , unproportional exposure , etc. ), 
  please show one single russian military book on this `` maskirovka '' which is not on using camo or some such , but is about `` spreading misinformation is such big quantities that it makes the general public believe that everyone lies '' . 
  i know you ca n't , though . 
  just show any credible enough source on how this `` maskirovka '' is so different from the common military deceit used by everybody that it requires a special word for it . 
  '' russia , however , has a history of operating with a more complete inclusion of elements of political power and influence as well as operational art that ties combined arms to campaign objectives . 
  it is so important to russian doctrine , they have used and continue to use the term , maskirovka -- the art of deception -- to elevate the complete set of actions and conditions that fall short of war that enables battlefield victories to be decided before tanks and infantry close in battle . '', 
  please be more careful next time when checking your sources , i almost killed myself with facepalm . 
  this is bullshit , every word of it . 
  russian word `` maskirovka '' means usage of camouflage , sometimes more generally usage of any form of deceit , and that 's it . 
  not an `` art of deception '' , most certainly . 
  and , of course , you should look up the word `` credible '' in a good dictionary . 
  your article is anything but . 
  it makes it look like this maskirovka thing is something on its own level - while providing exactly zero sources to support this claim . 
  i do n't believe that `` maskirovka '' is something more that just usage of camo or other forms of deceit . 
  facts ? 
  you have presented exactly zero facts , i 'm afraid . 
  look up `` the dresden files '' . 
  it 's an urban fantasy series so the language is modern . 
  and it 's a pretty good series . 
  although ... 
  i do n't think reading fiction books would do much to your grammar . 
  dedicated grammar book or course will be much more efficient . 
  boring , but efficient . 
  there are courses specifically aimed at reducing the accent ( or rather , at acquiring some common accent that is considered native ) ; udemy.com has several , for instance .
