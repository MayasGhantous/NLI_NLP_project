  i have n't yet tried any myself , though . 
  videos from engvid.com also have a lot of tips on how to improve your pronunciation . 
  i 've used amazon.co.uk to buy a couple of `` real '' ( paper ) books in english , also for some consumer electronics which is way overpriced in russia ( yes , even with the delivery cost it turned up to be cheaper ) . 
  works okayish . 
  delivery is not free , and you have to wait for a week or so . 
  no , i prefer to use other stores which have more local presence and not just a delivery service . 
  ulmart.ru , citilink.ru , dns-shop . ru . 
  the prices there are usually okay , it 's just that particular thing that i wanted was for some reason massively overpriced . 
  by the way that first one , ulmart , is not just for electronics , it has pretty much everything . 
  and then people wonder why there are so few good books being written . 
  it 's oktyabryonok ( 1-4 grades ) and pioneer ( 5-11 grades ) . 
  komsomol i do n't remember , the ussr dissolved while i was in mid school , but those two i did wear . 
  you 're right , though , they are very common . 
  both are correct , but they have a slightly different meaning . 
  if you split the sentences in two , it could be easier to understand . 
  `` what , are you crazy ? '', 
  =  `` what ? 
  are you crazy ? '', 
  `` what '' here is about something the other person said or did , and `` are you crazy '' is your reaction to it . 
  `` what are you , crazy ? '', 
  =  `` what are you ? 
  crazy ? '', 
  here you are unsure if the other person is crazy or not ( again , probably because of something he/she said or did ) . 
  well , because ` readline.question ` is in all the examples i 've managed to find . 
  thanks for the example , i understand it a bit better now . 
  still ca n't get why the behaviour is different when stdin is redirected , but i can live with it . 
  there is one thing , though . 
  it is often needed to do different things with different lines ( e.g. 
  first line contains n which is graph size , and next n lines contain adjacency list for each vertex ) . 
  obviously i can use a global line counter and switch on it inside the ` line ' callback , but is there a less awkard way ? 
  javascript has one important advantage over python in the context of an introductory course . 
  it is trivial to do something `` flashy '' in js to show your friends ( like canvas animation ) . 
  python would require not only installation of python interpreter itself , but also whatever graphic library you chose . 
  not having all those concepts . 
  they do not belong in an intro course for people who do n't know what a variable or a loop is ( source : am a cs teacher in a highschool ; yes , people really struggle with those concepts ) . 
  also , js is ubiqutous , it 's rather easy to write something meaningful ( libraries ! ), 
  * and * ( ubiqutous ! ), 
  to show it other people . 
  read [ this ] ( http://eloquentjavascript.net/15_game.html ) and imagine writing something similar in another language of your choice . 
  thanks , it was really helpful !, 
  no , it 's not .

  [ anki ] ( https://apps.ankiweb.net ) is a great tool for expanding vocabulary . 
  other than that , you should just practice your english a lot . 
  read , listen , watch movies . 
  learning a language is a natural function of the human brain , but you have to supply data . 
  optimal function length is anything but bikeshedding . 
  it is critical for readability .

  those i store in a veracrypt container someplace safe , backed up to crashplan . 
  because i do n't like the idea of a random evernote employee reading it . 
  i know that probability of this is absolutely minimal , but i still do n't like it . 
  yes , i think crashplan is more secure , they advertise end-to-end encryption after all . 
  but the main thing here is veracrypt . 
  it 's a way to create strongly encrypted virtual hdd where you can store any files just as usual , in a container file you can store anywhere you like . 
  mounting and unmounting could be rather bothersome ( though there are ways to make it easier , simultaniously lowering the security a little bit ) , but i trust it very much , it 's a good time-tested and community-tested encryption tool . 
  not military grade of course , but if you do n't have possible adversaries with a top-notch supercomputer to hack your encryption , you will be safe . 
  [ they are working on a native compiler that does n't need jvm .

   if you think having a corrupt , unaccountable dictatorship that can murder/jail opposition and journalists is `` just fine '' , sure . 
  funniest thing here is that death rate of opposition and journalists is considerably lower now than before putin . 
  ( not to mention that vast majority , if not all , of journalist deaths is n't related to some anti-putin investigations . 
  north caucasus and especially chechnya basically live under their own , medieval law . ), 
  i like how you completely ignored my note that most , if not all , deaths in question have to do with north caucasus being an extremely dangerous place , and nothing to do with putin being ( or not being ) a dictator .

  this `` critics of putin '' theme is simplifying reality .

  one of the best for soloing stuff . 
  two of the three specs have dots and massive burst ( though demonology requires quite a bit of a setup ... but when it 's all in line , thal ` kiel is probably the biggest nuke there is ) .
