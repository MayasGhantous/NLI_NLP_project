  unfortunately if mods here will not start to be more pro-active - r/geopolitics slowly will be turned into r/worldnews . 
  same people create threads here and in r/worldnews , same comments , brigading , no fact-checking . 
  if you 're not interested in opinions from russians which can be very contradictory for your picture of world so just ban us and it 's done . 
  just put udon bowl here or pork ribs and fuck gravity !, 
  not `` crashed '' , but `` overload '' . 
  my reaction was like - `` wtf ?!, 
  half of brooklyn population is ex-soviets , ca n't they just find a someone who 's speak russian properly ? '', 
  yup , waiting for sfex2 chars, 
  `` spire on fire ! '', 
  garuda is next one, 
  garuda will be tomorrow and then ex2 chars . 
  only unsc can impose no-fly zone . 
  us jurisdiction can not overlap syrian one . 
  this is not scrapmetal . 
  maybe outdated but not scrapmetal . 
  omsk city have no vaults because our metro is n't finished =(, 
  dear enemy plz no attacks on omsk . 
  nothing interesting here . 
  can approve . 
  every russian citizen when his conscription military service ends receive '' \u0412\u0423\u0421 '' - \u0412\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e-\u0423\u0447\u0451\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0421\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c . 
  ( military speciality ) . 
  and few years after the state recruit them for training . 
  upvote for username . 
  and this is why russian economics is doomed ? 
  right ? 
  seriously guys , russians here and reading all your bullshit ( sorry for such strong word ) and trying not to laugh . 
  after crisis of 1998 ( that was a nightmare ) current exchange rate of rouble is okay . 
  so only v.rosso , area , sharon , shadow geist and hayate left . 
  ( probably ace from ex3 too ) . 
  artworks looks really great . 
  unfortunately this is the last tune from solar bears project because it disbanded now . 
  =( great guys and great music . 
  nope , bryan mcadam do not participate . 
  i 'd reccomend you to try sf ex2 + instead ex3 . 
  my main character from ex2 + . 
  good old times ... 
  not colder but snow is too early this year . 
  today omsk t \u00b0 was +1 for example . 
  everything melts . 
  yup . 
  hope you too  ) ), 
  also he was raised in russia so big props to him from rus community !, 
  this city is ekaterinburg , so-called capital of russia 's ural region , also heroin and your lovely krokodil drug capital of russia . 
  what is really bad that situation in other russian cities is not the same as critical as in ekb , but hiv is on the rise . 
  regional officials across the russia do not want to send bad statistics ( this is biggest problem in russia more than corruption itself ) to moscow to not be punished so affilated gov-t head structures do not recieving that information . 
  efficiency . 
  because mostly everyone here tried to kill a messenger instead of respect such effort from someone 's side . 
  so this is a predictable action from haunts . 
  russian here . 
  you can answer on your own question just by asking yourself - which goals russia can achieve by invading poland or at least baltics ? 
  how russia will protect that new land ? 
  answers will be - nothing and absolutely impossible . 
  try the same scheme with crimea or eastern ukraine and you will see different answers . 
  yeah , but russia still not recovered from ww2 in terms of population . 
  infexious . 
  because that poker face and very positive attitude . 
  he is not complained about his character ( zangief ) like other 9-1 match-up guys do . 
  once again . 
  guys , this is not r/worldnews - i saw no lines about angry putin in article 's body and there 's no need to editorialize headline . 
  downvoted . 
  just k.o. 
  your opponent with ca in 3rd round at kanzuki estate, 
  it 's not about intentions - it 's about possibilities . 
  u.s. control nato - so we can not be relaxed with us military bases near our border . 
  not because we ( russians ) hate americans or european neighbours but to maintain strategic balance and our own safety . 
  i remember that i saw video with putin and western journslists about this exact topic . 
  try to google it . 
  staying awake whole night in siberian gmt +3 even more hard . 
  also there was russian unofficial restream so numbers will be around 300 from russia, 
  except ripped pants and spike at shoulder, 
  / u/thinkofthecosts can you plz check line at https://youtu.be/y8wwoadwa9e?t=80 - does it say something about `` completely new characters '' ? 
  lend-lease program also was not benevolent act and us got something in return but thousands hundreds lives of soviet citizens were saved because of american vehicles and stuff . 
  so why these talks about benevolence . 
  if it 's can help people in their hard times it 's okay . 
  well , finals starts at 5am moscow time and 219 viewers is not really bad at all for our russian sfv community . 
  one of those characters generated by this bot =d, 
  you 're count part of background as part of character 's silhouette - this is a flipped car . 
  capcom seriously need some community managers . 
  there 's no adequate interactions between players and sfv team . 
  i just cropped lower part of screen - it 's still in menu , 
  do not worry , 
  itt - russians hacked sfv jokes, 
  sf ex series sountrack quality . 
  russians do not play with childrens because there 's no catholic priests . 
  stage was great - but not very suitable for fights, 
  no , behind akuma, 
  try to move to omsk , south-west siberia . 
  sunny and continental climate . 
  hot summers and cold winters and mud inbetween . 
  please can you send me a link about jailing gay people in russia ? 
  that 's true that majority of russians in homophobic but let 's be fair - gays are not imprisoned here due to their sexual orientation . 
  that article was about law about `` lgbt-propaganda to minors '' which is shitty but not working . 
  but you 're talking about that russia is already jailing people because their sexual orientation . 
  i will ask you again - please provide a link about `` lgbt-jailings in russia '' . 
  i have a lesbian friends here who 's not very happy with current situation in our society but fucking no one put them into jail because they are lesbians . 
  no one . 
  i 'm adult russian citizen and i have full picture of events in my homeland . 
  that 's a great thing that you 're more informed than russians itself of what happens here . 
  fyi - there 's still exists media who is directly oppose to kremlin 's narrative - tvrain.ru or '' \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0413\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0442\u0430 '' is most notable examples and bloody evil putin do not kill their journalists by polonium . 
  just want to point you that pussy riot is wrong example in my eyes - they do very contradictory shit in that moscow church and even liberal community here admits it .
