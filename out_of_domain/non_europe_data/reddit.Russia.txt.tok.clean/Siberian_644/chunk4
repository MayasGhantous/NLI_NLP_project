  not on ground , but concrete and stone and part about fertility is false but part about catching cold while sitting in our sometimes harshier climate is true, 
  that superstition comes from times of roman empire and called '' \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u044f\u0440\u043c\u043e\u043c '' ( walk under the yoke ) and this is sign of huge humilation because poles symbolize spears,

  wtf with author of this article ??? 
  we have military drills that lasts from saturday and these one was planned, 
  main difference between russian and american war games is that we are playing at our own territory and america not, 
  kizhi for sure, 
  3rd largest is novosibirsk, 
  just deal with it , middle-of-nowhere-yankee-ball, 
  each 3rd car or 33 %, 
  well , in general there 's two notable dialects in russian , but these spreaded only in central european russia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/okanye, 
  and each region have their own local neologisms, 
  yes , we are do not lie . 
  we just speak what we actually think and what we want or do not want - look at our actions from this position and you will be surprised how it 's perfectly describes our ( russian ) actions . 
  you know , it 's just a law and this one somehow represents what our majority actually think - yes , our state is strongly homophobic , but roots of this homophobia generally comes not from church , but our penal system and starts from gulag colonies - not criminal-minded majority was mixed with blatnyak and other thugs and as result non-criminal people adopt criminal code of law and their ideology - and homosexual in their eyes was dirty passive animal who have no will to fight for his own rights and life conditions and people call them `` petukh '' ( rooster ) and ignore them - they have separate table for daily food e.t.c, 
  and these views travel with people when they was released from gulag system and widely spreaded thru whole nation , and exist today but in much weaker form than in 90 's - now openly lgbt person in harder case just can get some punches from local or humilating eye-sight , but in 90 's when there was `` democracy '' in rf , gay can easily catch some stabs, 
  there 's a thread in / r/russia about homophobia in our state - feel free to read it, 
  hi , we are russian team working to restore a cold war rocket with rare type nuclear warhead , please tell to us your coordinates , guys !, 
  mp elena mizulina and saint-peterburg mp milonov, 
  also it 's our government and president is not anti-gay in general but portrayed in that way by western and lgbt media in panic and irrational way , and there can be more reasons for this :, 
  outrage and fight for rights of lgbt community in russia, 
  another possibility to attack russia , no matter how, 
  destroy putin reputation in eyes of western people to recover western incompetence because of snowden/syria/lybia case e.t.c, 
  destroy obama reputation - blame him that he can not do anything with russians, 
  russophobia ( sad , but true ), 
  try to use lgbt situation to suspend games in sochi and use vancouver again, 
  also all actions of russian government was caused by russian lgbt community because they are do not want to be patient - it 's russia , it 's big and everything here developed in very slow way even adoption of someone 's views and majority of population is mildly aggresive towards gays and pride parades can cause havoc and outrage , so our govt try to settle down these things, 
  i do not separate people to straight or not straight , we are all russian citizens - but it 's matter of time when majority can adopt minority . 
  revolution in october 1917 chain of events was triggered by bloody sunday 22 january of 1905, 
  [ fyi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolution_of_1905 ), 
  same was with collapse of ussr, 
  it 's not minority fault - main reason is conservativism and prejudice of majority , so breaking this barrier can take some time, 
  i 'm ordinary russian citizen and my state do not give a fuck what i say and what i do until i 'm break the law because our state is reactive - it made response to any threat or case or event but can not prevent them . 
  i 'm free person and live in a free state - but anyway russia is not paradise and there 's also lot of shit happens here but it 's not about spying on it 's own citizens, 
  excuse is of me , but this is example of lgbt-propaganda to children and it 's is of banned in / r/russia, 
  south ossetia and abkhazia inhabited by ossetians and abkhazians and some of them have russian passports . 
  anyway , conflict starts when georgians kill our peacekeepers at border and then start bomb tskhinval at night and kill civilians - and we can not tolerate this, 
  you mix up chechens and circassians, 
  after khasavurt accord chechens have their independence then regroup their forces and attack dagestan republic and after that was second chechen campaign and wahhabi scum was annihilated, 
  your trolling is too fat , sir, 
  eimic - everything is made in china, 
  imagine that there 's no putin in russia do you think that our population instantly become pro-lgbt ? 
  so just blaming putin as dictator is not enough and now he is nazi ? 
  please decide what you want - find a solution how to make people less conservative or just try to demonise our prez without any positive effect for lgbt-community, 
  there 's no law that says that our state will arrest gay athletes - solid source please, 
  winter olympic games 2014 will be in russia - just deal with it . 
  i do not think that our government start witch hunt for gays on this games, 
  us pretends to be transparent and free , but it 's not - so your idealists start to flee soon as it was in ussr , when soviet idealists started to flee when they realised that su is not about equality and communistic paradise, 
  at least in this aspect we looks like as mother europe, 
  you should try to yakutia her size is of scary, 
  not today , us is should be strong and be more responsible for their actions and how it 's affect whole world now - us have a lot of power but lack of responsibility, 
  edit ( add text and photo ) : wow !, 
  much obliged , sir !, 
  can you provide me text of these laws ? 
  oops !, 
  it 's even 3 times !, 
  litper - read that stupid law , if can not read ask friend that he read this for you . 
  if you try to discuss or promote your views to children you will be punished . 
  but if you holding hands or interact with adults no one can not legally punish you . 
  is that clear or i should repeat ? 
  that law is stupid , and mp mizulina is controversial figure in russian politics but stop that hysteria, 
  poland not russia, 
  read / r/russia for answer, 
  source please, 
  can you clarify for which one kremlin 's group of influence rt is mouthpiece - former medvedev team , siloviki , lib-dems , or putin team ? 
  main problem of western media that they do not see whole complex picture and must repeat endless sequence as weird anglo-saxon musicbox - putin . 
  kremlin . 
  dictatorship . 
  you are free to be openly gay in russia , but you are not free `` according to muzulina 's law '' to `` promote non-traditional sexuality to children '', 
  acknowledge !, 
  there was no crisis - there was a catastrophe,
