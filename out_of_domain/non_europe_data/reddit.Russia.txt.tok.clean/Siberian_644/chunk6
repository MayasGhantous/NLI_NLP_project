  it seems that / r/worldnews need `` russia guilty !!! '', 
  button in comments, 
  omsk here , 2500 km from moscow - have no problems with shelves in supermarkets , even camembert is still available, 
  my first `` aww '' comment, 
  omskinform is well known in omsk for their hilarious headlines but that headline is misleading and incorrect, 
  internal vatnik inside tells me that this is ukraine 's future winter =(, 
  furry dome, 
  now it 's will be property of / r/omsk, 
  i do n't make fun of them - living in starvational conditions and under totalitarian regime is utter hell , so there 's no fun about nk population . 
  as for regime they looks like tiny soviet union with traditional korean society traditions - every wrong move and you 're dead, 
  much worse - dead sex lizards,

  do not try to visit omsk . 
  try to avoid us . 
  river, 
  very glad that i 'm backup my copy of simcity deluxe before game was removed from store, 
  decide to delete previous comment after receiving some russophobic bullshit messages in pm , not your response / u/highdagger - my username is not provocative in any case it ` sjust tells that i 'm from siberia ( south-west ) and digits is my city postal code . 
  and about `` yankees '' it 's my response to `` russkies '' . 
  whataboutism as it is, 
  video from omsk news channel http://gtrk-omsk.ru/news/detail.php?id=121158, 
  also , that armour was discovered in 2013 not 2014, 
  [ also , view at `` voskhod '' sanatorium , where 's digging site located ] ( https://www.google.ru/maps/@54.9710801,73.3695958,3a,75y,326.2h,74.13t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sk2c8yxq_vrfih-8vawfwhg!2e0?hl=ru ), 
  we will be prepared , do n't worry for us !, 
  can you made rivers a little bit thinny - it 's uncomfortable to see splitted ukraine, 
  iturup , beatch , not etorofu, 
  what : `` russia ? '', 
  use cheap russian bluetooth [ controller ] ( http://www.defender.ru/products/game/gamepad/mobile-master/ ) in general for snes games and right now i 'm thinking about to purchase wayward souls after news about latest patch with controller support, 
  snes emulator, 
  russian here , we also have settled around 40 % of our territory and most populated is european part - 80 % ( ~ ~ 146 % ~ ~ ) and asian is close to 30 %, 
  [ very serious picture ] ( http://school.xvatit.com/images/2/23/29.08-19.jpg ), 
  living conditions beyond purple line is harsh and above is fucking harsh, 
  last summer very drunk woman falls down from blockhouse eight floor 's window and meet the surface . 
  i have enjoyed sunset from my balcony when something moans next to me and i heard squishy slap after that . 
  i was shocked probably for next two days ( as worker at that video ) - never , remember this - never try to fall down from eight floor 's window . 
  hi there , dear romanian - can you tell me what romanians think about moldova annexation ? 
  you know soviet also was `` union '' but ends as `` these commies occupy us '' - so it 's interesting for me what actual romanians think about this union/whatever - will it be federation or just annexation moldovan territory, 
  it seems that valve 's dota 2 need special `` kompot button '' , 
  a wild omich appears ... catch them all !, 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfjzxw4lyks - that 's how we deal with dota2 kids in russia, 
  but it 's perfectly describes whole situation during 90 's, 
  it seems that you prefer info that american submarine rammed russian one in russian territorial waters and we try do not start 3rd ww ? 
  i also believe that our guys suffocated in that iron barrel in next few days when our state fails to save them - but what answer do you expect ? 
  and classical comments in review section from russian speaking community in every english-speaking game - please add `` russian '' language , 
  feel free to send me some basic text lines - i can translate them and probably ru community calm down a little , 
  su-su-su-summertime sadness ... 
  ... but your face is too intellegent for that outfit . 
  unfortunately he appeared in kremlin only at the dusk of so-called `` wild 90 's '' , when grozniy city was already `` butchered '' and oligarchs and gangsters controlled whole state here , in russia, 
  australian wild nature versus russian warships . 
  round one . 
  fight !, 
  as a russian i want to present to my aussie friends a new word - `` ship-front '' , 
  bogan in internets , just wow !, 
  multitask drill - shoot `` 2 '' while surplus 25 and 17, 
  as a ordinary omsk city citizen just want to deliver these coordinates for proper drift-spot observance - [ enjoy ! ],

  -28 \u0421 today , very chilly but here , in south-west siberia everything is okay =p, 
  chelyabinsk it 's a ural region not siberia , 
  that 's my words ... 
  soundtrack for end titles https://soundcloud.com/dumbshitthatjakazidmade/get-clucky, 
  feel free to do it , 
  very interesting in eu league, 
  are we related to baltics , comrade ? 
  why would anyone attack metro or theatre ? 
  or school ? 
  only iron curtain, 
  me is of can not in english , comrade !, 
  sorry send money - send back leopard rug !, 
  deal is a deal !, 
  or tomsk * ftfy, 
  you know , siberia is too big to talk about our terrible winters - in south-west siberia it 's much comfortable than in far north or eastern regions . 
  also little note for you : chilly day = sunny day , so there 's no snow . 
  warm day = snowy day . 
  so - chilly day =| snowy day . 
  fallen body can not resist , you know ;-), 
  we try but / r/worldnews dislike to hear whole bunch of russian opinions and downvote them six feet under . 
  as for me my views is too pro-russian for / r/worldnews but strongly pro-western for / r/russia, 
  [ zetman ] ( https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=42 ) love developing of the story and grim athmosphere, 
  [ sunabozu ] ( https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=5526 ) great post-apocalyptic story with un-ordinary protagonist, 
  [ nana to kaoru ] ( https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=22343 ) start reading as ecchi but then fall in love in characters and their depth, 
  tower wars, 
  [ steam id ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/id/teacwr/ ), 
  germany is of so cute !, 
  goodbite , comrade !, 
  nobody understand that event as it should be - russia need strong economic partnership with south korea to boost development of russian far east . 
  both sides have one problem between south korea and russia - the best korea . 
  was twice at boiler room in russia and everything was ok - op is a troll , 
  already stolen , ez bro , there 's no need to visit russia this time ;-), 
  romance of the three kingdoms xi, 
  too addicting and easiest way into `` no life '', 
  just try to download puk for rotk xi and patch to translate it - difficulty is much higher and cpu ( vs you ) acting great, 
  this is not a problem - if lithuania decide to close movement between mainland russia and kaliningrad region it will be more serious than current event . 
  also , baltic states , unfortunately for us , russians , and for them will be suffer economically, 
  well done , dahlia ... 
  it 's +35 c in ufa , russia - city where that video was filmed so asphalt starts to melt . 
  also shit quality of work, 
  generation ( 65-75 ) that comes to power after putin 's generation ( 1955-1965 ) is more hot tempered and less educated and these actions can ignite some real shit .
