  pr bonuses is always cool , but russia in general solves our own problems with radical muslim militants on syrian soil instead of russian, 
  there 's no need to calculate russian actions because we announce all our concerns and you 're only need to listen properly, 
  syria can be stable without assad , but now only him can control saa which is strongly needed for ground operations vs isis, 
  al-shishani is georgian citizen from pankissi valley not rf citizen,

  well , tbh omsk oblast is not having troubles with krokodil due to heroin and cannabis transfered via border with kazakhstan, 
  russian here . 
  can you tell me notable soviet oligarchs please ? 
  well , i can only to express my condolences to citizens of turkey , i 'm disagree with some aspects of your state 's foreign policy but fuck terrorism , seriously, 
  i 'm still think that soundtrack from sf ex series best ever , then comes sf iii and only then sf v, 
  nothing about cancelling weapon deal with iran in article . 
  headline is misleading, 
  so if west is not controlling them , why senator mccain made a photos with them after providing them with weapons ? 
  not controlling ? 
  so do not support 'em if you can not control . 
  well , from russian perspective japan is not even worthy to discuss about according to topic because it 's not considered here in russia as solid solo-player but us proxy so it have no weight in eyes of russian military strategists . 
  probably only as `` unsinkable aircarrier '' . 
  main reason for that base at kurils is to counter ttp and solidify russian military presense in pacific region, 
  russians is absolutely predictable . 
  annoyingly straight-forward predictable but everyone love try to find something under the carpet and to not pay attention at person who 's standing on it . 
  and nuclear weapons is defensive weapon not offensive . 
  if threat will be serious enough to be finish existance of russia as state it will be used for sure .

  masterpiece event - well developed in all possible aspects and hype as fuck as a result !,

  you 're just confirm my answer tbh , 
  brackets update team commits suicide at next hour after beginning, 
  well , soviets handle nuclear plants operations from ministry of nuclear industry to ministry of energy right before 1986 and new guys do not take it seriously . 
  we all know the result of fuck-up that follows next . 
  russia still looks friendly at turkey not erdogan and i strongly doubt that we even can attack turkey in future . 
  at least i 'm even do not want to thinking about, 
  no , we do . 
  there 's a lot of incredible good land at far east region , but not enough people to use it .
