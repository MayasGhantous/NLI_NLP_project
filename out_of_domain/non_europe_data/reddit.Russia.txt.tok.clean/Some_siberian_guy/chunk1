as for internal tourism much people in siberia prefer altai and baikal to black sea . 
  theese are a way closer areas of interest, 
  does software developer count as engineer ? 
  same story here . 
  as for my observation , the most suffered of losing job or salary decreasment are managers of any sort and people involved in `` buy-something-sell-it-by-triple-price-business '' . 
  have n't noticed someone involved in production/creation/developing of something to be hit by crisis . 
  sure , that 's just my pov . 
  most people here who have some care about world 's politics kinda irrationally like him . 
  ofc he 's not a `` russian friend '' , as well as leader of any country is for sure caring about his country interests at first . 
  but the thing is - russia do n't really need states-friends . 
  it need states-parntners instead . 
  for last 15 years ( may be more , have n't noticed it due to my age xd ) russian foreign policy is like `` hey guys !, 
  let 's do something together !, 
  trading stuff ? 
  common science researces ? 
  maybe common industry projects ? 
  do n't you want us to build something big in your country ? 
  investments ? 
  guys ? 
  anyone ? '' . 
  so , trump , as businessman , fits to the role of someone who might work at developing equal partner relationships much more than another hypocrite who 's organizing witch hunt for the sake of % any_beautiful_word_like_democracy_or_human_rights_here % by one hand and sending troops to do something opposite of % same_beautiful_word_here % somewhere by another hand at the same time . 
  we 've seen such a lot . 
  so , may be that 's the reason of that irrational attractiveness of him as president . 
  i prefer to think so . 
  they mostly do n't . 
  but as close relationships as they are now seems fine too . 
  when i was about 12 me and my friends wrote a simple script that emulates novell login program for ms dos ( except it does n't actually do anything except of saving typed login-password into some hidden file , saying something like `` wrong password '' and terminated self ) and inserted call of that script in boot.ini ( do n't remember actual boot file name in dos , let it be boot.ini ) just before actual novell login form at several school computers . 
  it looked perfectly like people always mistyped their passwords for first attempt to login . 
  soon we got credential info for plenty students and some teachers . 
  we had no idea how to use it in good way and we definitely did n't want to do any harm and so we did nothing with that credentials . 
  does such fishing count as malicious software ? 
   if so , it was just `` well , because we can '' . 
  some game for children who only started programming and began to realize that their code may do something real . 
  indeed . 
  most people can understand the general meaning but many details are lost, 
  welcome !, 
  i see you already found [ / r/russian ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/russian ) - it 's better place for questions about language . 
  still , this [ / r/russia ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/russia ) subreddit is a good place for anything beside language : from news and weather to music and life in general . 
  some russian words indeed may be hard to pronounce at first ( i suppose , those are the ones with some hard consonants and sibilants ) , but everything comes with experience . 
  good luck !, 
  hold my excel disk , i 'm going in, 
  ah , nothing to be nervous about . 
  do you know that story ? 
  when alexander the great was marching his way to rule-the-whole-world-thing it appeared that it 's very hard to pronounce `` alexander '' to arab people . 
  so , in that area he became known as iskandar . 
  and now it 's common middle east name . 
  just think about it : such easy sounds as `` ks '' are almost unpronouncable sequence of sounds for so much people , who instead have no problems with `` sk '' at all . 
  it does really show that it 's totally normal to have difficulties with some unfamiliar sequences of sounds , as i think  i can assure you most russians have problems with pronunciation all that english `` th '' and `` w '' stuff for example . 
  it 's something just to get used to , 
  i might be a bit off topic , but have to say that . 
  in russia night-day watches movie dilogy is considered as failed attempt to screen amazing novel franchise `` world of watches '' authored by sergei lukyanenko . 
  two movies are covering about 2/3 of a alternate ( and considered as pretty dumb ) version of first book of six at least . 
  even author had some mocking to that movies in latter books ( like '' - egor , i had a dream you were my son - lol '' ) . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_of_watches is definitely a novel serie to be advised to any fiction-lover , but not that two movies please, 
  personal insult ? 
  really ? 
  is that a way to deliver your thoughts here ? 
  it 's a bit hard to advice . 
  sadly , but russian filmmaking industry is not at it 's best times now and really good movies are more like exception than a rule . 
  i 'll give it a try :, 
  [ what men talk about ] ( http://m.imdb.com/title/tt1595366/ ) - a good comedy with calm and lambent humor . 
  [ legend no . 
  17 ] ( http://m.imdb.com/title/tt2182001/ ) - biopic of kharlamov , outstanding hockey player . 
  that movie is russian-patriotic as hell , if it 's important . 
  anyway it 's like a gem in russian filmmaking nowadays . 
  [ hardcore henry ] ( http://m.imdb.com/title/tt3072482/ ) - badass action movie filmed like some first person shooter videogame . 
  just wow . 
  it 's a must-see for gamers . 
  still , it 's partly russian partly american movie so it might be not what you are looking for . 
  ca n't give you some advice about legal channels though : i just never was looking for russian dub with english subs ( usually its vice versa for me ) , so idk such, 
  lol sorry . 
  did n't understand it was asking for advice . 
  will transcriptions do some help ? 
  what even happened here, 
  you may train at simpler words at first :, 
  then slowly combine, 
  hope some day the guy will be able to return to his homeland . 
  that one is n't even hollywood 's , it 's russian movie . 
  not like anyone taking it seriously, 
  i may be innacurate but have to notice that total tax counted includes contributions to pension fund . 
  long story short , after hyperinflation in 90s caused by collapse of the soviet union all people 's pension capital turned to nothing , and that 's a huge lack of money we 're still trying to compensate . 
  so , today 's workers mostly pool pension money for today 's pensioner 's instead of savings for own future pension , and that works just as tax . 
  anyone please feel free to correct me if i am wrong in that . 
  as for anti-corruption i would n't say that there is some conspiracy : it works , but much slower than it should be to give some good results due to it 's just so common pattern in people 's mind that it may take couple of generations to get rid of soviet heritage way of thinking like `` why should i pay taxes when i may hide my income instead '' and `` this person looks kinda important so i will not judge him by the law properly just in case '' . 
  it 's a sort of hanlon 's razor : do n't assume bad intentions over neglect and misunderstanding . 
  in the rest it sounds right to me . 
  sorry , i just came from / r/europe and need to recalibrate my wierdometer, 
  why was it removed ? 
  [ here ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/russian/comments/5o8cli/hello_my_russian_friends/dcj4dtt ) i mentioned some modern russian movies some time ago . 
  it may appear useful for you, 
  nothing new here, 
  not like i 'm somehow homophobic or violent towards some minority but what about freedom of will ? 
  should n't be one person who 's views are even destructing people 's safety let have his own mind ? 
  i mean , it 's his right to dislike something , and it 's other 's right to dislike him for his views . 
  but forcing others to have the same state of mind as you have is neobarbaric . 
  discussion and persuasion , not forcing . 
  such news make me feel a bit overpatriotic . 
  here is the international trade , here is the ability to build technical advanced product ( one of the best in kind as i know ) , here are jobs and income for our country . 
  just yaaaaay, 
  as i heard , it 's illegal in israel .
