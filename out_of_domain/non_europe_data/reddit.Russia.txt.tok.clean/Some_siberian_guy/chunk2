  correct me if i 'm wrong please, 
  as for me , the whole soviet union existence was an experiment that failed : people apparently are much worse than ideal beings able to work together for a common goal but not for themselves . 
  but that 's not a popular view . 
  answering the question , it 's really too diverse to get a single view of so much things . 
  `` eventful '' may be right answer though . 
  you see , `` light '' may mean something like `` easy '' or something like `` fragile '' . 
  and here comes the source of this oppositeness . 
  when someone 's sleep is not `` fragile '' , it 's `` easy '' for him to sleep . 
  so , when you say '' \u044f \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043a\u043e \u0441\u043f\u043b\u044e '' , it means something like `` it 's easy for me to sleep '' , so it means your sleep is solid/unbreakable/deep . 
  btw , using right case in '' \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437 1-2 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 '' is a hard thing for non-native . 
  well done !, 
  as russian native watching `` arrow '' in english i 'm so glad that russian speaking in that series goes with english subtitles . 
  often i just ca n't understand a thing without them . 
  i do n't even think it will look weird cause i often see natives who prefer writing by block letters . 
  cursive is easier for writing something long enough ( more than two or three sentences ) by hand , but does it really happen nowadays ? 
  in everyday life writing by hand is usually used for making notes , lists and filling in some blanks : block letters fit for that just fine . 
  if cursive is really hard for you it 's not worth time spending on learning it . 
  edit : still , reading cursive remains important, 
  also please do n't rely on some songs or music . 
  poetry in general have a bit non-natural structure of sentences . 
  really ? 
  why ? 
  i 've always thought it 's all gray and gloomy here . 
  it does n't commemorate 50 year of volga factory . 
  in 1972 volga automobile plant got name v. . a. . p. . of 50 years of ussr - so here is written just the factory 's full name . 
  formally it still carries that name afaik, 
  hi from [ 2005 ] ( https://youtu.be/6y2dmi0tanm ) ( 2nd verse ), 
  '' , but that 's definitely a vulgar language . 
  same scale of vulgarity as ` holy shit ' , though, 
  may be it 's better to start with non-offensive slang . 
  it 's very hard to measure `` level of agression '' in foreign language and using offensive slang may give you thousand and one ways to mess things up . 
  you may try theese :, 
  - literally `` fire ! '', 
  - `` hot ! '', 
  \u0434\u0438\u043a\u043e - literally `` wildly '' - adverb used to express unnormaly high level of something . 
  '' \u042d\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u0434\u0438\u043a\u043e \u0432\u044b\u0431\u0435\u0441\u0438\u043b\u043e '' - `` it enraged me '' ( another slang word : '' \u0431\u0435\u0441\u0438\u0442\u044c '' - to annoy , to drive wild ), 
  \u041a\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c - literally `` to roll '' - to fit , to serve the purpose . 
  '' \u0414\u0443\u043c\u0430\u044e , \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0442 \u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043a '' - `` i suppose it will do a job [ and there is no necessity to continue working on it ] '', 
  \u041f\u0435\u0447\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0430 - literally something like `` a small sorrow '' - sarcastic `` it 's a pity '' used to express that even if there is a problem it does not touch you at all . 
  - \u041f\u0435\u0447\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0430 '' - '' - i missed a sale in shoes shop !, 
  - what a pity ( not ) '', 
  all about `` excessive force '' . 
  by law you can not defend yourself even with a rock when someone attacks you with bare hands . 
  you ca n't legally defend with a knife when attacker has a rock and you ca n't use firearms when attacker has a knife . 
  still , there is tricky part : you may do almost anything if you have clear information about attacker 's intention to kill you ( much more complex when it 's not you but your family ) . 
  so if your dogs would kill a thief armed with even an automatic rifle ( ! ), 
  pointed at you ( ! ), 
  your only way to escape prison would be to provide evidence that burglar was going to kill you , not just scare you . 
  do i need to mention unarmed thieves ? 
  it does suck . 
  we even have a saying here : '' \u041b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435 \u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u0443\u0434\u044f\u0442 \u0447\u0435\u043c \u0447\u0435\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0441\u0443\u0442 '' - `` it 's better to be judged by three people than to be carried by four [ in a coffin ] '' . 
  the most legally safe to protect yourself would be using loud signaling with automatic call to security agency . 
  if you are going to live far from any cities . . 
  damn . 
  better to bury the body . 
  any color you want , no one cares indeed . 
  but in general style it 's better to use running shorts for running or rest on a beach and wear something longer in everyday life . 
  you wo n't receive any agression , you will just look a bit weird . 
  edit : ah , looking weird was the point , i see, 
  it 's very hard to live in your reality i think, 
  i do n't think there is something to worry about in cultural terms . 
  think of stereotypes just like of stereotypes but not facts , try not to abuse people , do n't be a jerk unless it 's appropriate ( for starters - just do n't be a jerk in general ) . 
  i think it 's just as anywhere . 
  some things may be useful , may be not so :, 
  - st. petersburg is a city of a bit unexpected weather . 
  check weather forecast and prepare for anything . 
  - russia has a right-hand traffic . 
  i never thought about it , but it may affect road crossing and orienting for british . 
  idk if it 's any important, 
  - try to learn something about rules of paying for public transport in st. petersburg . 
  it varies from city to city . 
  - also some religious places may have some requirements to outfits for visitors , it 's better to know beforehand . 
  - st. petersburg has really many places to visit and many sights to see . 
  please have fun , 
  oh , ok . that was something we were teached in school and some years have passed , did n't know it have changed, 
  everyone understands it for sure . 
  as for using . . it varies . 
  varies , 
  personally i prefer thinking of strong language as of strong language : the more you use it the weaker it becomes . 
  ca n't say for others . 
  case solved !, 
  why would you even want to have such conversations ? 
  you see , it 's something like weird kind of negative religion , with existing devil in flesh , but with no god provided to oppose . 
  you do have things to spend your life on instead of religious arguing . 
  it 's basically a [ cantor 's paradox ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cantor%27s_paradox ) - `` set of all sets is impossible '' . 
  you know , in beginning of 20th century that paradox have wrecked the naive set theory and have caused some kind of revolution in mathematics . 
  it 's something like `` as opposed to '' . 
  when you say `` unlike a , b is c '' you mean `` a is not c , but b is c '' . 
  in addition it may mean that one may had some expectations about b. 
  as example : `` unlike his father , jack was n't very fit '' . 
  it means that jack 's father is fit and you may be expecting jack to be fit too , but he 's not . 
  more like any transgender in russia would be banned from any sport competition where men and women perform separate . 
  probably raising a lot of noise and complaining in media . 
  most likely not giving a fuck about it . 
  '' \u0444\u0430\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430 '' is mostly used for factories involved in light industry ; '' \u0437\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434 '' is mostly for heavy industry . 
  some things like '' \u0445\u043b\u0435\u0431\u043e\u0437\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434 '' ( bread factory ) hardly fit that explanation , but i think it 's more like exception than a rule . 
  you may try to use our national tree - the birch . 
  russian firebird ( google pictures of it , just do n't confuse it with phoenix ) may also be a very nice option . 
  sign me up, 
  they should wear metal-cage-backpack for delivering junks to police station .
