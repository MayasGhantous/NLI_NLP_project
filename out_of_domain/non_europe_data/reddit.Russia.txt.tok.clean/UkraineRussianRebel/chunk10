  cnn : trump supporters want to physically eliminate political opponents !, 
  democrats :, 
  unpresidented, 
  unhoused, 
  unsenated, 
  [ build the wall ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjezbqecihy ), 
  [ you ca n't always get what you want ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql4ydkakqva ), 
  the harambe though ... 
  ( i know it 's not harambe ), 
  so that 's why they 're saying carson is n't `` really black '' and does n't `` really '' know their struggles ? 
  `` there is no need to be unkind '', 
  even better, 
  they appointed a muslim to protect literally geert wilders ? 
  what ? 
  well , it makes roughly as much sense as putting muslims and christians next to each other in refugee camps . 
   moscow funded or equipped, 
  so milo does not speak in the end ? 
  i kind of missed the news lately . 
   most of the world is against america . 
  most of the ( left-wing ) * western world ( politicians ), 
  most of the world , be it britain , israel , india ( modi ) , russia , japan , or china i 'd say prefer current america with a straightforward president who is , as said in the victory speech , `` tough negotiator but fair to everyone '' , to duplicitious hillary or obama . 
  trump represents the real , honest america to me . 
  not the liberals and their overly sensitive , anti-microffensive talk and hypocrytical , deceptive , hateful behavior . 
  no one looks to germany or the eu as an example of rational and patriotic decisions . 
  more like the opposite . 
   policy that trump has implemented that they disagree with, 
  sounds like `` true principled '' conservatives ^ ^ tm nevertrumpers than liberals and `` progressive '' democrats to me . 
  democrats would have plenty to disagree with : he 's taking away their illegals , muslim rapefugees , unisex bathrooms and cheap labor force . 
  basically , he 's taking away their opportunities to virtue signal . 
  conservative nevertrumpers , on the other hand , believe ( except foreign policy neocons like mccain-graham-rubio triple ) almost the same things : against illegal immigration , honest about islam etc. 
  but trump is just not from `` their establishment camp '' he did what they would never achieve : became an actually popular president . 
  easy to say that for him when he 's a member of the privileged majority that benefited and still benefits from the slaver -- oh wait, 
  i hear mexico city has many * bad hombres * there . 
   trump the progressive implements late term abortions and turns completely pro-choice feminist, 
  liberals : wtf trump hates babies !, 
  i did n't write the comment , it 's from politico . 
  ( i do n't know if you 're supposed to still remove the names on here ( rule iv ) if it 's a publicly available comment , but i erased them anyway . ), 
  always wondering if radical sjws would like their ideas implemented in practice . 
  like , okay , you 're a sjw feminist girl who believes in everyone `` choosing their gender '' , most people will likely never meet a `` transgendered '' person in their lives so it 's `` but they 're such a tiny minority -- who could be hurt by it ? 
  you wo n't meet them anyway '' , but imagine it was * your highschool * , and you were one of the people who were , well , `` lucky enough '' to have such a minority person there . 
  do n't tell me you would feel fine and comfortable with a guy who claims/believes he 's a girl being in your locker rooms during pe , or in the showers , or in the bathroom on a regular basis . 
  i just refuse to believe that . 
  yes , you should `` support '' minorities but `` choosing '' gender is just plain bizarre . 
  do n't accomodate rules for majority to those with crazy mental problems . 
  it 's just useless . 
  disorders should not be normalized . 
  yes , thinking you 're a different gender , not mentally matching your body , is a disorder . 
  jew goldstein ... [ where have i seen that ... ? 
  ] ( https://pics.onsizzle.com/kurt-eichenwald-kurteichenwald-ajew-goldstein-this-is-his-wife-you-9362263.png ), 
   realizes she fucked up when the muslim explodes during lunch, 
  kek, 
  if you 're talking about jews , israel is just as bad with their muslim problem and immigrant no-go zones . 
  great many jews in europe are opposed to rapefugees coming in , and get treated just like trump supporters , and not just because synagogues are among primary targets , too . 
  the sjw come in all ethnicities . 
  georgia is [ not a muslim ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/georgian_orthodox_church ) country . 
  ( if that 's what you meant ) she was born in russia but she 's ethnic georgian , surnames ending on [ - adze ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eduard_shevardnadze ) , [ - shvili ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oleg_basilashvili ) , [ - kidze ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sergo_ordzhonikidze ) , etc. 
  are typically georgian , also frequent among russians with georgian origin . 
  bonus : the most famous guy [ with the surname - shvili ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joseph_stalin ), 
   evolution 's pretty sexist i guess . 
  wtf i love creationism now !, 
  ben carson is n't really black . 
  you 're only black if you 're democrat . 
  if you 're not , it means you 're already privileged and can be treated with hostility liberals reserve for the `` unprotected '' , `` oppressive '' classes of people . 
  also , the german imperial government . 
  they could n't defeat us militarily so they tried to at least support some kind of unrest , they probably did n't even think the bolsheviks could be successful . 
  lenin then ended up signing the brest-litovsk treaty . 
  but germany did n't benefit from that for too long as they lost the war shortly afterwards . 
  what is them wearing white supposed to symbolize ? 
  is it just that , look , everyone has a formal black suit on , we 'll wear the `` inverse '' for protest ? 
  edit :, 
   * women 's working group wore white clothing , dubbed `` suffragette white '' in a nod to the women 's rights movement in the early 1900s , *, 
  what , women still ca n't vote in the us ?!, 
  remember : women who voted for trump are misogynist and want to take away women 's right to vote , work , and even drive and walk out of the house without a man ( at least after dark ) !, 
  just kidding , that 's literally what progressive sharia supporters want . 
  breaking news : trump is doing exactly what he said he would do . 
  merkel btfo, 
  #charisma of a damp rag, 
  #appearance of a low rank bank clerk, 
  we have the best marines . 
  i was reading through the article complaining about introducing conscription and was a bit surprised that it was written by a girl , saying she would be drafted . 
  then i remembered that sweden is feminist so they have to draft women , too , because equality , lol . 
  b-b-but you have an implicit bias and you imagine all muslims as middle eastern arabs , so , in fact , you 're prejudiced against arabs and are concealing that as a criticism of islam !, 
  ( paraphrased real quote ), 
  quad bricks, 
  [ the tallest !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjezbqecihy ), 
  laws are for little people !, 
  ( i do n't know if that 's a real hillary quote but i remember seeing something like that here . ), 
  not to mention one of the last things he approved , hours before leaving office , was $ 200 million aid to palestina . 
  the girl next to her looks like an identical twin of my friend . 
  i was like `` what is she doing in america right now ? '', 
  lol, 
  please help spread this important humanitarian message !, 
  support us in ending the oppression of [ ethnic kekistani people ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv2hkioi9ce ) . 
  #freekekistan #keklivesmatter #pepeofpeace, 
   unhappy with politics since i realized politics was a thing . 
  almost like everyone in the last several thousand years in almost every country there was and is . 
  #for kek so loved the world that he gave his rarest pepe so those who believe in him do not perish but live forever,
