  must have missed this one . 
  i find it funny they thought the `` russia connection '' accusation would work every time . 
  especially when they accused a senator of meeting an ambassador which is kind of ... a part of the job of a senator ?

  band actually ? 
  i have been looking for information , including the `` point emerging probably entering '' name , but never found anything except the shadilay song and people asking the same question . 
  needs more jpeg, 
  yes . 
  not to disrespect the op , but as a russian i can tell that the comment , and the reasoning of bill mitchell in this particular tweet , did not nail much . 
  russians did overwhelmingly [ prefer ] ( http://publikatsii.ru/uploads/posts/2016-07/1469720612_jytu6575967857u6uytuiy.jpg ) trump to clinton , citing your reason . 
  it 's real that russia did want trump -- but that does not mean that the election was `` hacked '' . 
  it 's like democrats would prefer left wing to right wing politicians in other countries -- does n't mean they 're hacking everyone 's elections . 
  when the results came in , the russian parliament celebrated and there were [ literally parties to celebrate american election ] ( http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/19/moscow-nightclub-hosts-early-inauguration-party-for-trump.html ) . 
  the reason cited was this : *** a war was averted *** . 
  clinton openly said she would go into war over syria , called putin the [ `` godfather of european extreme nationalism '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpvg2djthg4 ) ( meaning le pen and farage , of course ... ) , and what scared people was the way she reacted to the [ war in libya ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmiryvjqehm ) , which convinced many she was a geunine psychopath . 
  meanwhile trump was saying all along he is willing to cooperate with everyone against terrorism . 
  regarding the `` strengthening of the us military '' : it 's not something russia would be afraid of . 
  the us already spends more on the military than five or six next countries combined , what does some increase matter ? 
  [ no one 's really crazy about it ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-putin-trump-iduskbn14c0we ) . 
   `` in the course of his election campaign he ( trump ) spoke about the necessity of strengthening the u.s. nuclear arsenal , and strengthening the armed forces . 
  there 's nothing unusual here , '' said putin . 
  it 's who will be in charge , and how that military power would be used , that mattered . 
  fortunately it 's not clinton in charge . 
  united we kek , divided we reeeee, 
  pre-january 20th, 
  `` hahaha you really think he 's gon na enforce immigration laws and build the wall ? 
  dumb lown information trump voters you got scammed you deserve this hahaha rednecks '', 
  post-january 20th, 
  `` trump is doing exactly what he said he would do !!!, 
  this is terrible !!!, 
  we need resistance !!! '', 
  counterindoctrination unit deployed, 
   nasty woman, 
  he did n't say `` women are nasty '' , he said `` hillary is a nasty woman '' . 
  why do those pussyhat protesters have such a hard time comprehending sentences ? 
  `` and now , kids , we will sing a song as a class '', 
  `` which song ? '', 
  `` not the false song of globalism '', 
  chapter 10 : last night in sweden, 
  rhetorical question , of course . 
   the cia plants false flag fingerprints, 
  interestingly , just today i was reading an interview with a russian cybersecurity official ( fairly trivial stuff , `` be careful with credit cards , do n't download suspicious apps on your phone '' etc ) but there was a link to an article about how hackers around the world increasingly began planting `` fake russian trails '' on their activities because of how the `` russian hacker '' stereotype spread and thus people and investigators are likely to be led on by that false trail because it 's believable . 
  it might actually be plausible . 
   the gulag archipelago, 
  some russian radical leftists claim that the gulag archipelago is made up and solzhenitsyn wrote that because he 'd never become a famous writer in russia but the west welcomed , embraced him and even gave him a nobel prize . 
  they call him sol [ lzhe ] ( https://translate.google.com/#ru/en/lzhet ) nitsyn . 
  i wonder if some american leftists would already be ready to make that claim , that solzhenitsyn is slandering socialism so the `` unjust '' capitalism system is `` holding people in chains '' ? 
  i was facepalming internally when i heard that . 
  exactly , that 's , like , the entire point of that document . 
  they droned this guy, 
  is it bad that i do n't know who reddit 's most famous user is ? 
  there 's actually an article on forbes about him, 
  hijacking , sorry . 
  i have a theoretical question ( mostly for libertarians ) . 
  as rand paul said, 
   those unable to work have to rely on voluntary charity, 
  how does one then justify the state taking care of veterans no longer able to work , that is , to serve the state and its military ? 
  would that be `` a claim to slave labor '' ? 
  sometimes i see paul 's declarations as tiny bit extreme . 
  a column on the nation and commenters there likened the immigration laws enforcement to ethnic cleansing ( yes , they used that phrase . ), 
  also , african americans and old people are `` unable to cope with republicans ' ridiculous voter id laws . '', 
  ( again it 's a quote ), 
  illegal immigrants are threatening traditional america and benefit liberals and democratic party so that 's why `` republicans want to enforce immigration laws . '', 
  the `` threatening traditional america '' is presumably a good thing to them . 
  like , `` enhanced affirmative action '' ? 
  they 're progressing very fast and accelerating . 
  a few years ago , it was just enough to be a feminist woman to claim the oppressed minority status .
