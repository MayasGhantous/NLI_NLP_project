  then you became oppressive , and you also needed to be lesbian or other kind of sexuality to qualify . 
  at some point , all women who are caucasian/of european descent became oppressive and now you also need to be black and lesbian . 
  no , that 's not enough , too oppressive , too mainstream , you need to be a trans black muslim lesbian non-conforming intersectional woman to be able to participate in the women 's march and not oppress everyone else there . 
   we are committed to dismantling the patriarchal practice that requires mothers to work `` double shifts '' that require them to mother in private even as they participate in justice work . 
   we are committed to disrupting the western-prescribed nuclear family structure requirement by supporting each other as extended families and `` villages '' that collectively care for one another , and especially `` our '' children to the degree that mothers , parents and children are comfortable . 
  who are the anti-semites again ? 
  they came to a conclusion that traditionalism , conservatism and any kind of national identity , or respect for traditional family ( = need for an authoritarian mussolini-like figure according to the `` critical theorists '' ) are signs of `` authoritarian personality '' that inevitably leads to `` fascism '' . 
  today 's liberals and leftists are spreading that . 
   it should n't be unnecessarily stressed . 
  i agree with this . 
  most people have n't had `` sex education '' as a separate class and still `` knew '' , without someone specially explaining things to them . 
  in many countries in europe there is no `` sex education '' as separate subject outside of a brief mention during some social science . 
  and it 's not taught to children but to 15-16 year old teenagers . 
  the problem is how a sex ed subject could very easily be abused to push the `` innovations in sexuality '' engineered by various `` gender experts '' . 
  why would children in kindergartens need to know about anything sexual ? 
  i am a true american . 
  ( i 'm not american lol ), 
  is the forum `` offmychest '' by chance ? 
  i heard people on here saying they were autobanned from there , subscribed to see what it looks like and got that exact message minutes after , with a link to an article how t_d is about `` resentment '' , something like that . 
  conservative democrats used to be a thing . 
  some are social conservatives economically more liberals ( not in classical liberalism sense ), 
  i am a [ terrible person ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cynophobia ), 
  the best are the dog owners who say `` oh , he just wants to play , he does n't hurt anyone '' as the dog is rushing at you , growling , gnashing teeth , trying to grab you . 
  and you 're the bad person if you yell at the owner to put their dog on the leash . 
  especially when you just calmly walk over to the other side of the street to avoid the dog , but it still notices you and you get yelled at by the owner for `` provoking the poor innocent animal '' ... by just walking to theother side of the street . 
  i have an albanian friend who claimed that islam is peaceful and not oppressive at all , that she could n't understand why people criticize islam . 
  i asked her why she was drinking ( she had a bottle of water , it was during ramadan , around noon ) . 
  she was pretty perplexed at the question , like that it 's a weird question to ask . 
  she learned what ramadan is from me that day . 
  yes , vast majority of albanians are `` fake muslims '' . 
  they only call themselves `` muslim '' because the country , a long time ago , due to having converted to islam from christianity as it was more advantageous under the ottoman empire , was `` muslim '' but they do n't really even observe anything or know much about the religion in general . 
  no albanian i know ever observed anything muslim . 
  every dog owner always tells you their dog is nice . 
  until `` oh he just snapped , i do n't know what happened , he never did that before , always so nice to people ! '', 
  sucks to be the one percent . 
  when you tell the dog owner to put their dog on the leash , they 're * mad at you * for `` provoking the dog '' . 
  yeah , i definitely caused their growling , barking and trying to grab people . 
  no , i believe i am not an inherently a bad person because i do n't like aggressive dogs . 
  hey its me im from russian internet, 
   can sense your nervousness . 
  that 's what i am always told but trying not to be anxious makes one * more anxious * haha . 
  but i do n't know to which extent that is actually true : some dogs are `` scary '' but just ignore me . 
  they 're fairly unpredictable . 
  not every dog behaves that way ( growling and so on ) , but the ones that are actually actually dangerous ( like various large hunting dogs etc ) , small otherwise harmless dogs ( golden retrievers , and the like ) are fine . 
   how great burkas are, 
  well the awareness of how they treat homosexuals does n't help ... ? 
  funny thing , where i live one guy organizes an annual event `` dog walking in front of the mosque '', 
  by the way , what we suspected is confirmed :, 
  [ trump 's campaign staffers were actually lurking on the donald ] ( http://algonjaner.000webhostapp.com/wwmeme.jpg ), 
   but it was n't until the arrival months later of steve bannon , who brought with him an in-depth knowledge of the internet 's underbelly acquired while growing the anti-establishment breitbart news , that the campaign 's engagement with the fever swamps reached its apogee . 
  by the fall , *** a team in the war room at trump tower was monitoring social media trends , including the_donald subreddit *** -- a message board that acted as a conduit between 4chan and the mainstream web and refers to its users as `` centipedes '' in honor of the aforementioned video -- and privately communicating with the most active users to seed new trends , according to two former trump campaign officials . 
  the team would bump up anything particularly catchy to social media director dan scavino . 
  ( trump spokeswoman hope hicks said there were no staffers dedicated full-time to monitoring social media trends , and that bannon was not involved in social media strategy . ), 
  but one former campaign official said the goal was to relentlessly tilt the prevailing sentiment on social media in favor of trump : `` he clearly won that war against hillary clinton day after day after day . '', 
  never saw this before . 
  this is incredible . 
  they realize this , too . 
  commenters on one popular liberal website were discussing how republicans and conservatives are `` harrassing latinos on the basis of their lack of legal status '' and want to enforce `` ridiculous voter id laws that african americans and old people would be unable to cope with and understand '' , thus `` trying to suppress voter turnout '' because the `` forces of cultural change and immigration '' are `` threatening them '' ( therefore , benefiting democrats ) . 
  their opposition to ( illegal ) immigration is `` akin to ethnic cleansing '' intended to `` keep america western and christian '' . 
  those are all real quotes or very close paraphrases . 
  democrats support illegal immigration -  democrats get more votes -  democrats in power support illegal immigration -  democrats get more votes -  ... 
  if if if if if you 're listening obama ... !, 
  i lean left economically and conservative socially but leftwingers tend to treat their opinions as the ones towards which the `` arc of history is inevitably bending , however long it may be '' so answering a serious question with some version of `` are you kidding me '' could definitely be attributed as a liberal debating style . 
  conservatives have to defend their opinions because they 're not considered `` mainstream '' in many cases but left does not as liberalism ( progressivism ) is the default ideology among western `` intellectuals '' ( sorry about the scare quotes ) and many politicians . 
  i decided to look out of curiousity how many african americans and other `` marginalized minorities '' would be `` further disenfranchised '' when there was a texas voter id thread before the election here . 
  91 % of african americans have voter ids and photo ids . 
  so maybe the solution would be to somehow convince/require the remaining 9 % to get them , too , instead of risking the potentially immense amount of voting fraud ? 
  ( but that 's of course not what they care about and why they 're opposing the voter id laws . ), 
  autocorrect or is it an english word i apparently do n't know ? 
  what 's with the flag ? 
  i missed this .

  just looked at the stream and there 's only the empty pole there lol . 
  one has to get to a ticket to go to a church ? 
  so i actually qualify as z ? 
  i thought i was millenial the whole time !, 
  i used to say stuff like `` my generation is lost '' but it turned out i am actually a z as well after reading this comment , by one year haha . 
  i honestly ca n't imagine lil marco as president . 
  he just appeared as an annoying kid throughout the debates to me . 
  trump made a fitting nickname again .

  [ end the oppression of ethnic kekistani people ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv2hkioi9ce ),

  what 's with all this hate on people who do n't absolutely love dogs ? 
  i do n't like dogs . 
  i am neither insane or anything else . 
  not liking dogs = not liking dogs , not being `` untrustworthy '' or `` deplorable '' ( in the actual sense of this word ) . 
  unclean animal , like pigs . 
  that 's why people put pork on mosque door handles or walk dogs in the parks in front of mosques ( in non-muslim countries , obviously ) . 
  [ okay , maybe i do have mental issues after all ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cynophobia ) . 
  i do n't dislike or am anxious about all dogs so not sure if it 's a real phobia , only the potentially dangerous ones ( like various aggressive breeds , [ this does n't scare me ] ( https://www.pets4homes.co.uk/images/articles/2916/large/five-universal-personality-traits-of-the-golden-retriever-556d979a5dbc8.jpg ) ) . 
  they are completely unpredictable . 
  my ultimate fear is that kind of a dog that runs at you , growling , gnashing teeth , snapping , and the owner is calling it back but the dog does n't listen , obviously . 
  in my college ( in europe ) , there recently began a massive propaganda for accepting refugees and multiculturalism . 
  posters , movies about the plight of the poor `` refugees '' and `` intolerant , unaccepting , bigoted '' europeans . 
  they even have videos of some ukrainian , vietnamese and russian foreigners ( the largest foreign communities in the country ) talking about how they 're `` oppressed '' by the majority ( we 're not -- but some cucked immigrants were willing to read the script and get paid for that , apparently ) .
