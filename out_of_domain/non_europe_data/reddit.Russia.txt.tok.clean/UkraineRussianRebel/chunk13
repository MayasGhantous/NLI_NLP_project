  thread on askreddit ( like i did ) ? 
  and if he knew who george soros is , he 'd say that it 's just a philantropist . 
  that 's why they 're trying to portray just being normal as some kind of unearned `` privilege '' . 
  sorry , but being a heterosexual with my gender matching my body is not a `` heteronormativistic cisgender privilege '' , it 's how  95 % of people are . 
  do n't forget that indians like trump , are islamophobic and based sikhs are from india . 
  definitely bigots !, 
  trigglypuff just got 10 pounds heavier !, 
  ( i miss that bot ), 
  yeah , they would n't have renovated the old hospital , now they have an incentive to build a brand new one !, 
  you are now banned from r/pyongyang, 
  #obama is a fake president, 
  the joke has a different context but ... 
  a crowd of liberals are protesting youth unemployment in front of a government building , chanting `` we want jobs !, 
  we want jobs ! '', 
  a businessman is driving by , steps out of his car and picks a random guy who is chanting the loudest , telling him : `` hey !, 
  i will give you a job , right now ! '', 
  `` but ... but why me ? 
  their leader has a phd in * islamic studies * from university of baghdad . 
  obviously isis misrepresents the quran and has nothing nothing to do with islam !, 
  it 's like spelling bees . 
   400 years later, 
  from what i read , quran was written and arranged in its current form by abu bakr as early as 632 ( the mecca-medina pilgrimage was 622 ) . 
  it 's the currently accepted arrangement . 
   two british terrorists who fled the uk to fight in syria ordered books islam for dummies , the koran for dummies and arabic for dummies from amazon ahead of their trip . 
   online messages sent before they left uk showed they planned to fight * ' i can not tell anyone i 'm going to jihad . 
  lol . 
  i 'll get arrested ' * , one said, 
   they all had an extremely minimal knowledge of the quran, 
  refugees just need to be given better driving lessons so they do n't crash their cars . 
  or are you implying it was not an accident ? 
  because that 's islamophobic !, 
  i 'm on mobile , ca n't link . 
  google washington post article `` western islamophobia causes terrorism '' ( not an exact title but like that ), 
  he retweeted rt though . 
  wilders is a russian shill russia is hacking dutch election confirmed !, 
  insisting that we defend human rights while saying islam is tolerant . 
  they can because they 're `` woke '' ( in the bad sense of the word ) and need to get around somehow to lecture the common people . 
  unfortunately , no renewable-energy transportation that is efficient and could readily replace the regular one exists . 
  obviously / s for the first sentence . 
  when there are too many people of certain ethnicity somewhere , it 's not diverse anymore . 
  therefore , you can not ever satisfy liberal/progressive demands for diversity . 
  it used to be `` too many europeans '' , now that asians are making up 40-50 % of tech companies and scientists in the us , it 's `` too many europeans * and * asians , we need * different * diversity . '', 
   do you worry when someone has a knife and is walking around ? 
  yes . 
  actually , now that i think of it , knife actually weirds me out more than a gun would . 
  to have a gun ( at least where i live ) , you need a license and undergo a months-long training under an instructor and do an exam , which all requires dedication and is costly in addition . 
  carrying a knife , you do n't need any of that . 
  knife is more suspicious than a gun , probably . 
  not that i regularly see people with knives or guns anyway . 
  is it surprising that amsterdam voted left ? 
  amsterdam is kind of like dutch california . 
  [ election 2012 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/tweede_kamerverkiezingen_2012.png/1200px-tweede_kamerverkiezingen_2012.png ) ( the red dots left of the island in the center ), 
  [ current year-2 ] +2, 
  all countries in the eu ( as far as i know ) have voter ids . 
  you ca n't vote without them . 
  no exceptions . 
  west europe is `` super-cucked '' but voting procedures are one thing i will give to them . 
  plot twist : your name is ahmed and geert wilders is the pm . 
  they are mega liberal . 
  i ca n't understand that . 
  my german friend told me he 's afraid germany will soon become islamic . 
  will vote for merkel because everyone else is a `` left wing or right wing extremist '' and she 's `` the choice without an alternative '' . 
  check post history . 
  `` you guys '' probably means non-dutch , which is basically everyone here . 
  not a shill but i 'd just like to say, 
  wtf i do n't want first woman president now !, 
  i do n't think you should vote for someone just because they 're a woman !, 
  you should vote for the abilities and experience , not gender !, 
  how much worse is the green party ? 
  lol, 
  showerthought : if woman and man are now just labels and state of mind , not your body , what do they say when they want to say what someone is biologically ? 
  i 'm disappointed , too , but they would n't have been a part of the government anyway based on how wilders is treated by other parties . 
  so being 2nd is still not bad . 
  everything is problematic !, 
  hahaha trump is so dumb , he said hillary deleted 39,000 emails , it was just 33,000 !, 
  hahaha , the bowling green massacre never happened , it was just al-quaeda supporting iraqi immigrants planning a terror attack arrested !, 
  my favorite one ( from europe ) : it 's not the refugees who came this summer doing the terror attacks and [ the raping ] ( https://youtu.be/2o6nmx_kzmq?t=1m21s ) , it 's the ( children of ) muslim immigrants who came decades ago !, 
  ( that 's so much better . 
  they 've been in europe for decades , were born there , lived there , and still are not integrated , that 's definitely an argument supporting that the millions coming now will become integrated , peaceful , assimilated shortly ! ), 
  tfw i have a samsung laptop with a built-in webcam staring at me . 
  need to get some tape like [ this guy ] ( http://republicbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160622/473027_3587856000000578-0-image-a-7_1466548290768.jpg ) !, 
   delet yourself is the only way, 
  i choose to follow your and * her * advice . 
  delete your account, 
   couldnt find it anywhere, 
  not a coincidence . 
  we need to investigate ties between lenovo and soros !, 
  i am russian and have an old fridge from the 80s . 
  maybe only some now discontinued kgb departments could spy through it back then though lol . 
  i deny that ww1 happened . 
  ww1 had more victims than holocaust . 
  should i be arrested ? 
  * approving * holocaust or * inciting * violence is , rightfully , in most countries a criminal act . 
  denying a certain historical event did n't happen ? 
  how should that be illegal ? 
  and why ? 
  some time ago , there was a post by authors of http://thebeltwaytimes.com, 
  adoradeplorable, 
  i like cats and am based . 
  never heard the `` cats are for girls '' stereotype haha .
