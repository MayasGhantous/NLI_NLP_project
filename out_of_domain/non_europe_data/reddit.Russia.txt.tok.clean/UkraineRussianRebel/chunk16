  can confirm . 
  we made  62m americans to vote for trump but only after we took britain out of the eu as a test whether such large-scale operations are feasible . 
  use of external media is manipulating elections ? 
  the thing is , you do n't have to read rt. 
  just like you do n't have to listen to anti-putin radio free europe/radio liberty in russia , but saying that exposing people to certain opinions is election manipulation is weird . 
  but in fact , it 's [ the trump dimension ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oueeazl9weo ) . 
  it 's not a ben !, 
  stop fooling us you fake carson !, 
  posted this in another comment :, 
  crimean government ( the one elected under ukraine , not the later one ) first declared independence from ukraine after yanukovich was overthrown as  80 % of people in crimea voted for him .

  we stole britain from the eu and next we 're stealing france from them .

  i do n't think this is worth watching anymore because no one can comment on anything and they 're constantly off-topic , trying to link things which have nothing to do with each other , and they 're just wasting time . 
  wow if she had blue hair i 'd think she 's a gender studies professor !, 
  side of beef !, 
  we need a rescue team to bring the whale back to the ocean !, 
  is it bad i do n't understand anymore what they 're talking anymore ? 
  russia made people `` freak out '' because democrats are `` freaking out '' themselves ? 
  is this real ? 
  trump was elected . 
  he was not appointed by anyone . 
  so when americans elect a candidate , it means the democratic elections ... were not undermined , right ? 
  candidate we do n't like wins = russia did it, 
  candidate we like wins = democracy and liberty wins over populism !!, 
  but did they buy you the ticket ... ? 
  #sorry ca n't comment do n't remember, 
  he ca n't even, 
  ca n't tell if ca n't comment or ca n't remember, 
  i wo n't tell you how i know that but i know because it 's classified information i know but ca n't remember sorry i ca n't comment on that, 
  fortunately trump banned lobbying so it wo n't happen again . 
  guccifer 2.0 says he is romanian . 
  the fact he 's saying he 's not russian is the proof he 's russian . 
  lol comey literally says nothing each time . 
  this is a hilarious hearing . 
  but what does this all say about the connection with specifically * russian government * ? 
  people have different opinions on issues . 
  that 's * not surprising or suspicious . 
  * it does n't mean you can only disagree with an official position because you 're a part of a massive secret conspiracy . 
  nasa is an un-american agency !, 
  they think they have the best words but they really do n't . 
  democrats : americans are intelligent enough to understand the emails but not intelligent enough to decide whether they want to vote for trump or clinton unless russia tells them how to vote . 
  c y b e r, 
  islamic terrorism is a made up right-wing conspiracy . 
  russian election manipulation for which there is no proof because they ca n't comment is real . 
  russians strike back, 
  lol they ca n't be serious, 
  common military excercises ? 
  i think obama may have abused his position of commander-in-chief to collude with russia militarily . 
  lock him up, 
  your professor was the one who told you to vote for trump and showed you r/the _ donald , was n't he ?!, 
  and this is why universities have safe spaces !, 
  it 's different for hillary clinton . 
  what 's the truth about her alleged drinking issues ? 
  they think americans are too stupid to decide whom to vote for . 
  they want a monarchy ? 
  like , you ca n't let the plebs vote , can you ? 
  stewart  mcmuffin, 
  he was in moscow ?!, 
  ah , russian spy denies russian involvement . 
  nothing to see here . 
  mr. commie, 
  [ schiff 's look like ] ( http://i2.wp.com/www.towleroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/smithdinner.jpeg?resize=250%2c284 ), 
  we never looked at that, 
  what, 
  what were they talking about the whole time then ? 
  mr. commie & mr. castro, 
  does he think all well-off people and entrepreneurs in russia are putin agents ? 
  the problem is they 're making assumptions without having actual information . 
  what knowledge does this person have to make such conclusions -- i would n't be surprised if all info they got was from wapo and nyt . 
  it 's people who confuse crimea with korea and baltics with balkans , after all . 
  it was published on buzzfeed . 
  it was debunked countless times . 
  buzzfeed got into media ethics dispute over that . 
  why does anyone still think it 's true ? 
  it is one of the biggest accusations . 
  because it 's made up . 
  it 's sensationalism . 
  it was debunked ( the '' '' `` dossier '' '' '' ) . 
  julian assange is a kgb agent but we ca n't get him out of that embassy for years . 
  why penetrate voter registration when ... 
  ... california does n't even have voter ids ? 
  does intelligence exist ? 
  it does , but too many democrats lack it !, 
  offensive weapons, 
  offensive, 
  reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee,
