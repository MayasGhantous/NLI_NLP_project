  the elections are only free and fair if we win !, 
  -- leftists, 
  yeah because only russians have offshore companies and their only purpose is to confuse you . 
  what the heck ? 
  session know trump . 
  trump know some russians . 
  okay guys we lost ... the evidence is damning . 
  if he thinks some articles on rt ( the `` russian disinformation '' ) are `` destabilizing '' the us democracy then he does n't believe in stability of the us state and democracy too much . 
  he 's crying because russia is destabilizing the us democracy . 
  is it some kind of a leppo ? 
  the firm was pizza related . 
  their evidence is 0/10 would * not comment * again . 
  he should probably just say he ca n't comment on that . 
  i agree with you and am not disputing this , that he 's trying to make turkey an islamist state again . 
  what i mean is that his outward behavior appears impulsive and unstable . 
  like when he almost declared war on russia one day because of an incident in syria , then came apologizing and saying how `` russia and turkey are allies forever '' , or praising merkel for being `` turkey 's strongest supporter in europe '' , then calling her `` nazi '' and comparing germany to a fascist regime the next day . 
  this kind of thing . 
  i still do n't know why the west backed the muslims . 
  countires like bosnia and kosovo are , despite being mostly `` moderate '' or non-practicing `` muslims '' are unable to control their territories , kosovo and bosnia are becoming european bases for isis and saudi wahabbis because the governments there do no have the resources to prevent them from being there . 
   at most 20k people nationwide ... by god , we 'd have ourselves a hunting day . 
  you 'd at first have to find them with those quantities haha . 
  enjoy your easter egg searching , or looking for a needle in a haystack , or whichever equivalent idiom you prefer . 
  slovenians are also christians , orthodox christians , and slavs , and have the `` same letters '' . 
  it 's the same to them . 
  they do n't discriminate among the people they hate . 
  albanians are fine in my experience and are not too muslim in general . 
  probably some of those religious sunnis , could be bosniaks or arabs . 
  is it taking them two days to confirm ? 
  there was a hearing yesterday , too , was n't it ? 
  or am i just time zone confused ? 
  they 're talking about triggered sjws !, 
  you neiled it, 
  his voice is so soothing, 
  bill * of rights * is great, 
  bill * clinton * is a rapist, 
  got confused . 
   ask a good question , get a good answer . 
  ca n't comment on that . 
  what is `` the greens '' ? 
  the green party ? 
  edit : okay , this is my a leppo moment, 
  you also have no right to a cake being baked for you . 
  kek, 
  marijuana sincere belief, 
  were those rastafarians ? 
  lol i assumed their alphabet . 
  the fun part is i 've been to slovenia but somehow remembered this , maybe i just confused it with serbians . 
  i remember they were saying `` oriental '' , maybe that term has been rendered un-pc recently . 
  `` obviously someone with mental illness '' * ( in paul joseph watson voice ) *, 
  one of those jewish radical zealots for sure !, 
  asian is pakistani , indian etc. , that region in britain . 
  no , time for a \\ #muslimban . 
  * muslim * . 
  not jamaican or british . 
  hey hey hey ... 
  this is library !, 
  this might actually be the case . 
  however , would anyone believe that a `` radical japanese shinto terrorist '' decided to fight against the british all of a sudden ? 
  decided to look it up, 
   they are called `` east asian '' or `` oriental '' , although -- dependent upon the context -- the use of the term `` oriental '' might be considered by some to be derogatory or offensive . 
  [ 11 ] [ 12 ] in the 2001 british census , the term *** chinese or other *** is used . 
  `` chinese or other '' is just so much more accurate a description lol, 
  take doctors from philippines if you need foreign doctors . 
  there are plenty of doctors who do n't come with terror risks attached !, 
  #never untangled, 
  it 's just a kaffir so what , right ... might as well walk past . 
  i heard it means peace or something . 
  look , i found all the pictures below where it 's purely in the context of peace and tolerance :, 
  europe is between a rock and a hard place : brussels extreme leftists incl . 
  merkel and schulz if he wins , and turkey ( as well as other islamists ) . 
  this picture is forever becoming a symbol . 
  it 's going to be the equivalent of [ * migrant mother * ] ( http://dujye7n3e5wjl.cloudfront.net/photographs/1080-tall/time-100-influential-photos-dorothea-lange-migrant-mother-23.jpg ) or that [ afghan girl ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b4/sharbat_gula.jpg ) . 
  terrifying indifference . 
  she did n't terrorize anyone though . 
  she 's a moderate muslim . 
  a radical muslim wants to behead you , a moderate muslim wants a radical to behead you . 
  [ illustration ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/c4fm7rsw8aandyr.jpg ), 
   give people a false sense of security, 
  worse yet , they 're giving the terrorists , radicals and those who wish to impose islam on europe a sense of security . 
  they know they will not be the target of investigations , they will not be restricted , put under scrutiny , or even criticized . 
  instead , the european governments will be immediately giving reassurances about how `` it has nothing to do with islam '' and deploying campaigns claiming that `` islamophobia '' is the real issue , and criticizing their own citizens for being `` intolerant '' and `` apprehensive '' of islam . 
  of course , they will get the feeling that whatever happens , they will be protected , while it 's europeans who will be the targets of the government . 
  they must be laughing at the ridiculousness of this . 
  europe -- and broader west -- is literally the enemy that is n't even defending itself , but attacking its own people . 
  bricks, 
  #ira is back !!,

  this [ revelation will shock you ] ( http://freethinker.co.uk/images/uploads/2015/04/prophetmuhammad-shiarepresentation-630x487.jpg ) !, 
   they do n't need to be veiled anymore . 
  true . 
  they just want [ everyone else be to veiled ] ( http://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/main_image_article_page/public/main-images/000_nic6492262.jpg ), 
  i sense a meme coming out of this girl 's photo . 
  kind of like the [ \\ #shariaforamerica ] ( https://i.redd.it/1mfnx3hetbby.jpg ) two months ago . 
  but probably still better than ranting about `` rampant islamophobia '' and `` nothing to do with islam '' tbh . 
  it 's easier to red pill the uninformed and ignorant than ideological leftists and liberals who refuse to see reality . 
  i n v a d i n g k o r e a, 
  i live in eastern europe . 
  wanted to travel to paris , london , stockholm , munich , that kind of bucket list . 
   any european country, 
  anything east of germany and south of sweden ( finland included ) is very safe .
