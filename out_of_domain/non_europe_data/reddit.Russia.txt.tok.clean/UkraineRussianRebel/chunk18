  all very safe and beautiful . 
  oh yes , forgot dubrovnik . 
  i 've only been to north croatia so far though . 
  asians do you mean british asians ( pakistani , bangladeshi etc. ), 
  or asians in the `` regular '' sense ? 
  if the first , not surprised . 
  if second , it 's quite surprising to me . 
  also , by multicultural , do you mean homogenous but with ( third-world primarily ) immigrant dominated or actually with many different cultures ? 
  just like liberals do . 
  muslims are poor , oppressed , socially disadvantaged . 
  somehow there are no gypsy terrorists , or christian terrorists , so i failed . 
  islam is the only cause of islamic terrorism . 
  anyone saying otherwise should remove their pink glasses . 
  irish does not mean ira supporter . 
  ira supporter means ira supporter . 
  muslim literally means a follower of islam , does n't it ? 
   it gets clicks and ratings, 
  not on reddit , here you get downvoted for that . 
  also , terrorism in the west would not exist without muslims and people primarily care about the place where they live , so that 's why people care about muslim terrorism more than about ... well , there is no other terrorism than muslim one . 
  nigeria , syria , iraq , afghanistan , pakistan , india , russia , china , yemen ... 
  it 's all only muslims . 
  also , wearing black is a totally spurious connection . 
  almost everyone wears black . 
  wearing a hijab implies you follow the islamic ideology so that is a different thing . 
  color of the hijab does n't matter . 
  are all ira supporters terrorists ? 
  so why do you think all ira supporters are * potential * terrorists ? 
  you are unironically accusing me of being a russian shill because of my username ? 
  i am indeed russian , but do you seriously think that the millions of people who voted for trump , are going to vote for le pen , supported brexit , geert wilders , almost elected norbert hofer and the freedom party in austria , i 'm not even talking about people in poland , hungary , slovakia , romania and other deeply islamphobic countries are all russian shills if they share my sentiment ? 
  i was talking primarily about france , germany , belgium and other countries that would be 100 % violence-free without ( sunni ) muslims . 
  talking about american terrorists : you ca n't avoid having crazy people in your country . 
  you can avoid * importing * them though . 
  trump 's travel ban is a good beginning but the leftist people in your government ( and islamic-collaborating courts ) are working hard to prevent its enforcement and are trying to [ sabotage trump 's presidency ] ( http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/chuck-schumer-neil-gorsuch-filibuster-scotus-nomination-236441 ) !, 
  i was not talking about america but primarily about europe , the formerly peaceful and safe countries like france , germany , belgium , netherlands and britain where you can barely go outside anymore because of the terrifying carnage going on there . 
  america has it 's own problems with chicago , st. louis , detroid and i totally recognize that . 
  i 'm talking about islamic terrorism , you bring me a list of separatists fighting their governments in the 1960s . 
  * okay * today , however , those separatists are mostly irrelevant . 
  islam is more relevant than before . 
  separatists are fighting on mostly on small territories against their national governments , islamists are in almost every country in europe , there are millions of them ( ~ 8 % in france and germany alone ) , and they do n't have a narrowly defined aim of reaching a certain concession ( territorial independence/federalization ) of the country , but general , though probably unattainable goal of `` bringing down the infidel '' and `` bringing terror to the hearts of unbelievers '' . 
  they will never achieve that and their terror will thus be perpetual , only increasing with more `` refugees '' being brought to europe . 
  yes , the [ afd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alternative_for_germany ) but there is a chance that martin schulz may win and that 's even worse than merkel . 
  merkel 's party is at least called the christian union , he 's from spd , a socialist party . 
  doctors lol, 
  that 's what i saw , then i realized it was `` my son '' after looking more carefully . 
  do n't forget the soros 60 minutes interview . 
  crazy . 
  i live in europe and we did study christianity , islam , buddhism , shintoism etc. 
  in high school ( with special emphasis on bible in historical literature classes ) -- it was a regular school . 
  what is in the picture on this post would not be so bad - as part of general education - if it were n't for the part that christianity is excluded , in a historically christian country . 
  like that guy on tucker carlson . 
  `` what are the countries ? '', 
  `` there 's seven of them . '', 
  `` yes , but what are they ? '', 
  `` there 's iraq ... and ... 
  turkey ? '', 
  what class is this test supposed to be from , actually ? 
  we also studied ( in a european hs ) christianity , islam and other religions in geography classes , then had bible , the torah , five books of moses , gospels etc. 
  in literature classes during the `` christian literary roots '' part of the class or it was named something like that . 
   i still do n't have a phone that can do that . 
  i do but i never bothered to install the app or have an internet connection there . 
  yeah , it 's pretty ... exclusionary , to use the sjw term ? 
  maybe if they were told to look it up on the internet , i 'd understand that . 
   word processor app and then you have to make it a pdf , send it to a computer , print it out ,, 
  and for all the tech fanfare , you still need to do this in the current year . 
  i got redpilled about hajj when i was around 10 reading some geography magazine , about how hajj is not just a trip to mecca , not just praying , but having to sit in the heat for 12 + hours without water , on top of a hill in desert to `` show your dedication to allah '' ( do n't remember exact specifics ) . 
  i remember thinking `` wow that religion sounds like torture . '', 
  then years later islam sadly became more relevant than before ... 
   `` jack has a new dress '' book that just got pushed out of north carolina schools, 
  what the ... 
  they seriously are pushing any propaganda immediately after it comes from the gender studies `` r&d '' departments . 
  we went to a movie about iran and women talking about sharia law , being forced to wear the headscarf and dress `` modestly '' , how women have 1/2 worth of a man under it , the islamic punishments still applied and so on . 
  but that was in europe . 
  the 5 second rule is real, 
  but it 's on left so it 's okay, 
  wait wait this is a legit , actual address , with the images and all ? 
  i thought it was a pede doing a video and at the end there would be something about going to mars . 
  the date confused me a lot but now it makes sense . 
  why explore space when we have not explored all genders yet . 
  we need ludicrous bricks and a ludicrous speed for that, 
  i assume the `` reds '' are not an equivalent of republicans in canada , right ?
