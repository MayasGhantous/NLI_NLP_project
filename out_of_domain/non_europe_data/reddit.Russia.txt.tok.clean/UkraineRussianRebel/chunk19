  singapore is one of world 's most developed countries ( though it 's basically a city-state ) . 
  there is no need to measure everything in terms of `` liberal '' or not `` liberal '' . 
  or does visiting sweden make you a terrible `` cuck '' liberal , even though , objectively , it 's a very nice country despite their massive islamic problem ? 
   he 's out of that shithole singapore . 
  one of the most developed countries in the world with higher living standards than most of europe but ok . 
   sadly , this is 100 % real lmao, 
  i refuse to believe the first comment was not a centipede infiltrator lol, 
  there is a misunderstanding of dimensions in this comment thread . 
  singapore is city state , and not a big one at that . 
  it has an area of 719.1 km ^ 2 ( 277.6 sq mi ) , for comparison , nyc has 28,052.5 sq mi . 
  it has world 's 5th highest hdi . 
  crime - violent crime - is essentially nonexistent . 
  there is no need for guns . 
  they simply do n't need them , for defense or otherwise . 
  they have virtually no wild nature there , the largest forests they have are city parks , so not even hunting . 
  buying a car is also a very big problem , and one needs very expensive licences , due to the lack of space . 
  i pay $ 1100 a year in `` socialist '' europe to the repressive state that is forcing healthcare on me . 
  jokes aside , $ 10,000 really is insane probably even for america with higher incomes . 
  it 's also an anti-semitic hand signal and i 'm sure that as a muslim he hates jews , too . 
  it 's because jihadis are mostly traumatized children who need understanding and love after what they have seen being members of isis . 
  / s obviously, 
   everyone is born muslim, 
  the reason why islam is not christianity , judaism or any other religion . 
  you can be a christian or a jew in whichever state because state and your religion are separate . 
  for a muslim - including the one not actively fighting for fusion of islam and the state - the ultimate correct way of life is to merge the state and islam . 
  secular , european , western , any other states are only a temporary glitch , `` corrupted '' by being non-islamic , which , in the end , has to change . 
   well it does protect women from rape by muslims ... 
  form an askreddit thread a few days ago :, 
   i would be sitting in a rickshaw with my aunt , both of us wearing a hijab and abaya , yet these disgusting men would keep staring at us . 
  i had one unknown guy follow me and my female friend all the way home in broad day light , and that was in downtown dhaka ( gulshan ) . 
   when i was 14 , some dude groped me in a busy bazaar market , while my family was right next to me , but they did n't see it due to the sheer amount of people . 
  the staring got so bad that my mom *** told me to wear a niqab , but that did n't make any difference . 
  *** these disgusting excuses of men still stared at me . 
  as [ this comment ] ( http://archive.is/pmvjc ) reflects . 
  #muhammad was a rapist, 
  even in places like jordan ? 
  always thought jordan was fairly civilized , like , one of those arab countries i would not be apprehensive of visiting . 
  strong independent * from the eu * woman . 
  was about to say poland is awesome in part also because it 's much cheaper but you 're right !, 
  tourists will redirect themselves there from places like paris and london . 
   free rape, 
  so they do n't even have to pay the rape fees ?!, 
  insane !, 
  that 's in slovakia . 
  nah , looked at the map , i 'm going to portugal . 
  my friend wanted to go to london in summer to which i responded it 's a very bad idea , it 's the next target , especially in summer , and only a matter of time , with the mi5 terror threat set to severe . 
  sadly i was wrong and it started much earlier . 
  i am not planning to go to germany anymore in the foreseeable future so at least one tourist they lost . 
  french countryside is nice . 
  i 've never been to any big french city myself , only crossed border from switzerland to france for a short visit . 
  berlin is franchising their kebab . 
  there are `` genuine berlin-style durum kebab '' stands in central and eastern europe . 
  progressives mostly do n't make money from tourism but importing migrants and `` working '' in ngos . 
  how come you 're not banned from that sub ? 
  they auto-banned me :d, 
   no politicians in the u.k. who stand up for what the people actually want, 
  which , in a democratic system where politics should work as a market -- offering goods on demand and discontinuing those that are not -- is genuinely puzzling . 
  trump 's victory , despite people even in california mostly believing they 'd be better off without mass/illegal immigration ( opinion polls ) , came with an immense resistance . 
  same with afd in germany , most germans disagree with mass muslim immigration ( opinion polls again ) but will vote for merkel , or worse , spd and schulz . 
  one would expect the change to happen very quickly , but it 's as if people had a delay in judgment or some kind of intertia . 
  one of my dreams ever since i saw [ this picture ] ( http://ihg.scene7.com/is/image/ihg/intercontinental-porto-4164645857-2x1?wid=1440&amp;fit=fit,1 ) . 
   with fines from the eu at 250k per migrant, 
  the eu is a bureaucracy superimposed on nation states . 
  if they try to somehow enforce that , i am sure that the eu will just collapse as the states begin leaving or simply ignoring brussels . 
  some us universities offer a degree in border studies . 
  would n't be surprised if it turned out the guy was making that point . 
  [ madeleine albright says she 's ` ready to register as muslim ' to protest president trump ] ( http://time.com/4649987/madeleine-albright-donald-trump-muslim/ ), 
  the us in chaos because mexican cartel members will not be able to get in when the wall is built as they implied in the picture ? 
  yes , that makes no sense . 
  they 're not strong on logic . 
   so a plumber would n't touch this place with a 10 ' pole . 
  this is the one that intrigued me in your comment . 
  plumbers do n't go to old houses ? 
  why ? 
   who graduated cum laude from harvard law school, 
  after reading this , i was curious what education or qualifications al franken has . 
   alan stuart `` al '' franken ( born may 21 , 1951 ) is an american politician , comedian, 
  yep, 
  i do n't understand , what is that candlejack you 're talki -, 
  so basically [ germany ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/technology/germany-hate-speech-facebook-tech.html?_r=0 ) . 
  i am surprised russian sauce is a thing in america . 
  tried google translate but it really did n't help much . 
  bricks, 
  ban the russian hacked game now !!, 
   `` uday and qusay working for saddam hussein : you could n't go into a restaurant and have eye contact with those guys without getting killed , '' matthews said on `` hardball . '', 
   `` imagine getting into a fight in the office with jared or ivanka -- they have enormous power and they 're always going to be there , '' he said . 
  the trump family is literally kim dynasty !!!, 
  is this real world ? 
  smh, 
  clinton called millions of people ` deplorables ' and ` irredeemables ' and it backfired, 
  on her campaign immediately, 
  it was hard to * apprehend * my feelings as i was watching the election coverage live from beginning to end , because the media were arduously claiming that hillary clinton , a radical who caused great adversity among americans , was the certain winner , but i was afraid no more when trump went over 270 . 
  seriously , i only saw that one sentence at first as it was marked with red , thought they were trying to slip that one bit into the test , then i looked through the whole paper ... and it 's * all * about trump !, 
  `` does not comply with necessary educational standards '', 
  to be fair , the poster wrote `` unexceptable . '', 
  but that may have been a result of the grammar education , as you say . 
  writing your name on the cup in caligraphy ... 
   soldier would be violent, 
  that would end very badly for [ those people ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hlgxi3mf9wo/maxresdefault.jpg ) i believe . 
  i 've never seen a muslim bakery .
