  maybe muslim kebab stand ? 
  i was accused of being a russian troll . 
  reason : my username . 
  definitely , putin orders all russian shills to have obvious usernames so they can be easily recognized and put on payroll . 
  black uniform + black turban looks super cool . 
   very prominent nigerian, 
  it 's something along the lines of the [ ugandan tracking implant ] ( http://archive.is/po2tr ) , right ?

  gypsies are living in terrible conditions , poverty , little access to education ( or desire for it - dropping out of schools at high rates ) , unemployment , secluded ghetto areas , in many countries . 
  yet the worst misdemeanors they do is pickpocketing , begging and often speaking too loud and there are no gypsy terrorists . 
  i wonder why if it 's `` bad living conditions '' causing muslim terrorism and not islam ? 
  jews have been persecuted for a long time in europe , so were christians in muslim countries . 
  the repression christians have to endure even today is totally anachronistic by most non-muslim societies ' standards , but christians are n't turning into terrorists , attacking muslims in the countries where they live as a minority . 
  i wonder why is it only muslims in countries like britain , france , germany , belgium behaving that way when the governments there are going to great lengths , as far as trying to censor the media and threatening social media companies with fines if they report on immigrant crime , to accomodate them ? 
  and why has a millionaire , osama bin laden , decided to live in a cave , running an islamic terror group , when he could have comfortably lived in saudi arabia and run his family 's construction company instead ? 
  i thought islam had nothing to do with that but his story is that of someone who is willing to sacrifice a lot for ideology , does n't it sound like one ? 
  and i thought isis was ignorant about islam , but abu bakr al baghdadi has a phd in islamic studies from the prominent baghdad university so i do n't know anymore ... 
  it 's not like the media and governments would be saying something untrue or trying cover something up , they ca n't , they wo n't , they would n't do that , right ... 
  right ? 
  is that where clinton walked under sniper fire ? 
  i 've never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting matter !, 
  my son said to me : daddy , look !,

  #never untagled,

  the framed pictures of soros , rompuy , marx and merkel , the crossed out britain with farage as a target , islamic rage boy ... this is ben garrison level symbolism . 
  notice how he has a `` refugees welcome '' t-shirt but the window is still closed for peaceful islamic visitors !, 
  it 's because the mom did n't come into the room yet .

  please also give them crayons and coloring books , i heard that works . 
  but frequently the person in question is not trolling , reddit then just `` hides '' opinions outside of the `` center '' unfortunately . 
  i remember that exact article you probably mean !, 
  he 's building a house without any construction permits on the plot of land neighboring ours . 
  his wall fell several time as he 's just randomly putting bricks on each other , without much system and no professional knowledge . 
  they have no fence , so their goat sometimes ventures into our garden , they also are raising pigs . 
  the town administration prohibited them from living there as the house is dangerous but they simply ignore the orders . 
  also , we suspect they stole our tomatoes once . 
  yeah but also you 're being environmentally inconsiderate , showers are saving water resources . 
  honestly , i believe personal baths , as in , those in houses , should not be manufactured anymore . 
  with the current situation , only corner showers should be permitted . 
  russian dressing !, 
   the profile of which closely mirrors the strategic interests of the russian government . 
  so basically it says it could be china , it could be a 400 lb guy in the basement , it could be anybody ?

  i do n't understand why you 're getting downvoted . 
  i just got downvoted to -2 for a comment about a german guy who claimed that europe has `` no refugee crisis '' . 
  not sure why that is an `` offense '' of any kind .

  the idea of mccain just babbling random nonsense is much funnier than trying to figure out the meaning of this . 
  true , fascism had aspects of both right and left . 
  it was nationalist , conservative and reactionary ( in mussolini 's words ) but at the same time had left wing aspects of `` commune '' , but based on national rather than class grounds . 
  just wanted to ask , thanks for the proof ( that it 's not ) . 
  cia did the shortages, 
  they certainly have something to do with mccain .

  i travel to st. petersburg every summer , and while i considered this possibility and was as paranoid in subway and buses there as i was in berlin and other european cities , somehow there was a sense of security , this kind of `` delusion '' that `` it ca n't happen here '' , `` what 's the chance of it happening here '' , `` if something like this happens , it will be in moscow , not here .

  he said it about [ wahhabis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arab_mujahideen_in_chechnya ) , who were the prime source of terrorism in russia in 1990s . 
  they were funded by [ saudi arabia ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/saudis-russia-sochi-olympics-terrorism-syria-2013-8 ) , among them were many mercenaries and former mujahideen from afghanistan , as well as local chechen militia . 
  the thing is that russian native `` muslims '' are mostly secular and `` muslims in name only '' ( like albanians or bosnians ) outside of [ chechnya and dagestan ] ( https://news.vice.com/article/chechen-militants-pledge-allegiance-to-the-islamic-state-in-new-video ) , where they do take islamism seriously , so it was either chechens or dagestanis , many of whom pledged allegiance to isis , or - due to our absurdly lax visa requirements for syrians - it was some sunni from there . 
  meanwhile the administration was forced into dropping iraq , a country with active operating isis where 90 % of people believe in sharia law , from the list : /, 
  i want it to be a \\ #muslimban . 
  not `` travel ban '' , not `` it does n't discriminate against any religions '' , it should discriminate against islamic ~ ~ religion ~ ~ political hate-ideology with religious aspects , because that 's the root cause . 
  bush did 9/11 to make a patriot act , right ? 
  that line of thought .
