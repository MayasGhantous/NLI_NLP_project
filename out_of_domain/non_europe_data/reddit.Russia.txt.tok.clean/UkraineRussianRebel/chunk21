  committing a false-flag terror attack to blame it on ~ 2000 protesters supporting a guy who got 2 % of the vote in the last election , especially considering there are tens of such protests accross russia every year , is a very rational policy , in one of our most important cities , a seat of courts , government offices , tourist magnet , unesco site , and a home city of 1/2 of our government including putin . 
  and reddit thinks / pol / are conspiracy theorists . 
  basically . 
  to explain this on an example of my albanian friend saying `` i 'm from a muslim country , i have no idea why people dislike muslims '', 
  she has no idea what ramadan is , wears a skirt , no-sleeves t-shirt , goes to parties , drinks , dates guys but is `` from a muslim country '' . 
  that kind of thing . 
  this was a cia revenge for the election hacking . 
  mark my word !, 
  i do n't think anyone mentioned obama or hillary in relation to the attack . 
  i posted a photo of the suspected attacker , from a russian news site , and i 'm russian myself so i 'm hardly being `` disrespectful '' . 
  works for me on desktop .

  found article on telegraph : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/03/saintpetersburg-bombing-casualties-explosion-metro-train/, 
  the protests had 2000 people , there were protests with over 100,000 participants in moscow a few years ago and nothing happened , but islamic terror attacks have been a constant a decade before putin became relevant . 
  there are a few of them apparently , all in those black clothes . 
  but it seems like it was not a suicide attack . 
  the other one :, 
  it 's apparently one of those instances like when you have an askreddit question `` what is something you 've always wanted to say but there was never an appropriate thread for it ? '', 
  op was banned ( it seems ) . 
  what i meant is that he just apparently wanted to say that about obama and hillary on here , but could n't find an appropriate thread , so he just commented in this one . 
  bill clinton est un violador, 
  bill clinton is verkrachter, 
  bill clinton on v\u00e4gistaja, 
  estonian . 
  though the `` is '' is in english , it translated incorrectly . 
  that 's almost like living in mosul with all those amish there :(, 
  unreal . 
  impossibly clueless . 
  i do n't even understand why they are defending islam at this point , there 's no benefit to be derived from that . 
  ukrainian orthodox ... wtf . 
   did everyone see r/all today ? 
  what the hell is r/bluemidterm2018 ? 
  there 's a new left-wing sub every fucking day now . 
  where are all these subscribers coming from ? 
  beautiful, 
  an apparent muslim arguing * against * hijab , saying it 's oppressive . 
  now * that 's * something they ca n't argue against , just simply because they claim everyone is ignorant about islam , but ca n't say that to a muslim . 
  i 'm russian in europe and i can get away with having conservative opinions when talking to liberals because we slavic `` asiatic barbarians '' are just not yet enlightened enough to understand the virtues and truthfulness of progressivism . 
  the fact i 'm actually from asia ( siberia ) helps a bit as well lol . 
  the equivalent of famous for being famous . 
  the was economic leftism/marxism/socialism / social democracy , now it 's cultural marxism , leftism , `` progressivism '' , and you need powerful elites to push that one because most working class , rural , `` uneducated '' and just generally non - `` progressive '' people have a lot of common sense . 
  i asked a mormon whether he 's from utah . 
  `` no , not every mormon is from utah !, 
  i 'm from idaho ! '', 
  `` but that borders utah ? '', 
  `` umm ... yes ? '', 
  i thought most of new england is deeply liberal ? 
  both american shores , actually . 
  that 's one of the first things i asked a dutch person . 
  `` do you smoke weed ? '', 
  also , [ gaddafi ] ( https://ccmscurrentevents.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/obama-gaddafi-handshake-091709-lg.jpg ) . 
  i want to see this . 
  i want more awesome nicknames , i want more pleaseclapping , guacbowls , lyin teds , lil marcos , nasty women , low energy ijeb!s , people i 've never seen eat in such a disgusting manner and people who have never been insulted for their appearance , but there is a lot to improve in that department ( believe me ) . 
  any chance this schiff is some kind of a relative of jacob schiff , who [ financed lev trotsky and the bolshevik revolution ] ( http://www.timesofisrael.com/trotskys-day-out-how-a-visit-to-nyc-influenced-the-bolshevik-revolution/ ) ? 
  i doubt this would be upvoted if it were an actual i 'm done with trump post , so seeing this on a frontpage , it did n't get me , either . 
  still upvoted though lol, 
  i really ca n't . 
  he 's ... not suited for that kind of position . 
  i seriously ca n't imagine bernie meeting with putin , jinping , abe , anyone of that sort . 
  sometimes it 's / pol / leaking too much . 
   intellectually or morally capable of self-governance, 
  they surely are . 
  just not the way the west is used to self-governing . 
  their self-governance is , literally , `` peace through strength '' , strength of a centralized , uncompromising government keeping terrorists and various kinds of insurgents in check . 
  pjw was a surprising one for me . 
  they want people to fall in line as well , just * their * line . 
  such is freeze peach . 
  nice . 
  i like this way of thinking . 
  but seriously , why are we supposed to so viciously attack someone the moment they slightly disagree ? 
  that 's what libs do . 
  calling him a `` cuck '' right away after such a long time on the train is a bit too hasty . 
   not inclined to answer his question, 
  ahaha , the question sounds kind of like after you have an argument with someone , so you ask an awkward question to test the waters afterwards , to see if they 're still offended . 
  was n't it bush who started the `` islam is the religion of peace '' phrase ? 
  context . 
  [ students freak out because someone chalked trump slogans on campus : emory university president says students are scared and ` in pain ' ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3506491/emory-president-students-scared-trump-2016-chalk-signs.html ), 
  officials arranged a meeting for those offended to address concerns, 
  university organizations also offered counselling to those affected, 
  the editor of the student newspaper said some students ` felt victimized ', 
  a freshman said she ` feared for life ' and thought it was a ` kkk rally ', 
  [ relevant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavery_in_mauritania ), 
  a system exists now by which arab muslims -- the bidanes -- own black slaves , the haratines . 
  an estimated 90,000 mauritanians remain essentially enslaved . 
  [ 26 ] the ruling ** bidanes ** ( the name means literally ** white-skinned people ** ) are descendants of the sanhaja berbers and beni hassan arab tribes who emigrated to northwest africa and present-day western sahara and mauritania during the middle ages . 
  the descendants of black africans captured during historical slave raids now live in mauritania as `` black moors '' or haratin , some of them still serve as slaves to the ** lighter-skinned `` white '' ** or ** beydan ( `` whites '' ) **, 
  today , it 's more like there are quite a lot that are [ pro-isis ] ( http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chechnyas-isis-problem ) , and others are super [ pro-russian ] ( https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2156944/who-is-ramzan-kadyrov-and-why-is-the-leader-of-chechnya-so-close-to-vladimir-putin/ ) . 
  interestingly , chechens are some of the most eager soldiers fighting on the russian side in syria . 
  the things is , many do n't see the war in chechnya as an invasion because chechnya itself was invaded by mujahideen , former afghan fighters , ruled by terrorists from the islamic brigades or those who wanted to build an [ `` emirate '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caucasus_emirate ) there , and many chechens were on the russian side during the time . 
  edit : you actually said that in your comment . 
  sorry , it 's the `` reading only headlines '' effect haha, 
  once in a subway , a group of young arabs rushed in . 
  everyone looked distraught , suspiciously at them . 
  then they started speaking spanish . 
  some europeans look like arabs lol, 
  somehow this does n't sound real to me . 
  did they have newspapers and sweaters at the time when quran was written ? 
  edit : apparently it ... is real ? 
  but i only found one source which sounds like an actual [ islamic website ] ( http://www.myreligionislam.com/detail.asp?aid=6096 ) .
