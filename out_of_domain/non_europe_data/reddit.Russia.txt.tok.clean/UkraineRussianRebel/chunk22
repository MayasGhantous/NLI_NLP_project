   question : what is the sunnat method of squatting in the toilet ? 
  should one put both hands or one hand one one 's cheek ? 
  answer, 
  the right hand is placed on the right cheek and the left hand is placed on the left one . 
  this is the sunnat method . 
  when there is the need to use a hand , the right hand should remain on the right cheek and the left hand should be used . 
  this is the proper way . 
  wtf, 
  do you mean the daughter of soros ' friend whose husband is a rapist ? 
  nyc , probably . 
  well if he 's like rockefeller , he has at least 15 years still , that 's four presidential elections .

  france lit up eiffel tower in russian colors , but briefly , they had to turn it off after the swedish attack a few days later . 
  was it at night or is the camera just black and white ? 
  you win . 
  allahu akbar , indeed . 
  i am not american and am quite intrigued by the idea of term limits . 
  many ( most ) countries have them for directly elected executive positions , but not for legislatures . 
  the question is , if people keep electing the same person for the house/senate for several decades , as is the case with mccain , what are the arguments for preventing them from doing so , except for `` he 's been there for too long , we need new people there '' ? 
  and i 'm saying this as someone who ca n't stand mccain , specifically . 
  they 're not usurping the position by power , they keep being voted for in primaries and winning general elections . 
  that said , voters do n't seem to mind in many cases that their candidate is a career politician . 
  should the will of voters be trumped by an objective to eliminate career politicians ?

   what the fuck has happened ( ... ) that child marriage and child rape is a debatable issue ? 
  [ this happened ] ( https://youtu.be/cyoua2lmypm?t=1m8s ) .

  #muhammad was a rapist, 
  you got me . 
  i entered the address , page not found . 
   they saw the police as their enemy rather than the bank robber , and that they had positive feelings toward the criminal, 
  in response to the hoards of ` vikings ' roaming stockholm 's streets to protect their ` women ' from ` muslim rapists ' , the women of sweden have spoken up . 
  in a social media campaign called ` inteerkvinna ' -- ` not your woman ' -- they are fighting back . 
  their ` protection ' is in actual fact a desire to dominate , control , imprison and possess women . 
  at the same time , they try to scare , abuse and exterminate other people . 
  they do not speak for me . 
  international solidarity is the basis of equality , justice and peace . 
  i am not your woman . 
  that was long before islam . 
   xerxes i ( ruled 486-465 bce ) , also known as xerxes the great , was the king of the persian achaemenid empire, 
  was up the whole night on november 8/9 until 7 am , when pennsylvania was announced , then went to uni that same day . 
  good times . 
  i knew i just * could n't * miss trump winning , and being here on the election night . 
  there were a few askreddit threads with people who had the `` trump regret '' , and were not `` shills '' , but it was mostly people whose first choice was kasich , cruz , rubio and they voted for trump because they were against hillary or because he was the republican candidate . 
  so not core supporters or people who actually wanted trump , and not just a republican or not-hillary as president . 
  til bill o'reilly writes books including internet phenomenons . 
  always saw him as , well , * old school * tv host . 
  maybe it 's a bit cynical to ask such a technical question like this , but from the article it 's apparent that the rapefugee was there alone . 
  how could he threaten the boyfriend with the machete * while * raping his girlfriend , you usually ca n't do ... much ... when you 're doing * it * with someone . 
  so it seems that the boyfriend is just some kind of cowardly uber-cuck . 
  wtf germany . 
  this is how we deal with it in the east : [ china ] ( http://www.americanow.com/story/crime/2017/04/03/muslim-refugee-attempts-rape-woman-video ) , when a muslim `` refugee '' tries to rape a chinese girl . 
  [ russia ] ( http://dailycaller.com/2016/02/04/refugees-go-clubbing-in-russia-harass-girls-wake-up-in-hospital-the-next-morning/ ) , when a muslim `` refugee '' en route to norway decides to stop in a russian club and touch some girls . 
  but she did n't !, 
  oh no , that sucks !, 
  [ i present to you ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_xvi_gustaf_of_sweden ), 
  i recalled reading an article some time ago about swedish feminists starting a campaign \\ #notyourwoman after some conservatives , i believe it was the sverigedemokraterna , said that they need to protect `` their women against muslim migrant violence '' . 
  could n't find the exact article but found this . 
   call to prayer from the local minaret, 
  have you noticed that if you switch the letters * h * and * j * in the word `` hijab '' , and turn the letter * b * 180 degrees around the vertical axis , you will get `` jihad '' . 
  i think not !, 
  is it ~ ~ possibly ~ ~ totally sarcasm ~ ~ ( though sadly does n't look like it ) ~ ~ ? 
  if they put this as the first result and this is really sarcasm , would n't that make google based , pointing out the feminist craziness ?

   if it 's too late to abort him ( post-birth abortions are n't allowed yet in this patriarchal society ), 
   make sure he never watches anything that does n't have at least one gay or lesbian couple in it . 
  use a gender-neutral pronoun on him -- just make one up , it 's super-fun . 
  come on , this supports my theory google is actually based . 
   a surefire way to do this is to accuse the man of pedophilia ; this will result in a swift removal of the toxic influence . 
  kek, 
   make him wear dresses to challenge gender norms ; all the other kids will totally love him for it . 
   he must realize that everyone is equal , but that women are more equal . 
  many shills do n't put in the effort and you can tell right away that they are russian bots , shills , trolls . 
  that 's why i 'm , and i 'm saying this not in a `` braggadocious '' way , the highest paid in my department and receive praise from the top-secret russian troll campaign administrators , and once putin himself congratulated me on my success . 
  you want to know how ? 
  read on . 
  i put in the effort . 
  you can achieve anything with dedication , hard work and diligence , and i dedicated myself to becoming one of the best . 
  i learned english grammar , american idioms and phrases so i blend in , and infiltrated the_donald completely . 
  everyone thinks i 'm just a russian guy posting here , this sub is for everyone who supports trump , after all , right ? 
  so while your typical russian bot/shill goes `` what a glorious day to be a us-american my fellow caterpillar . 
  praise be to our divinity-king trump '', 
  i go full, 
  #bill clinton is a rapist, 
  that is my secret . 
  that 's all . 
  anyone can be a russian troll . 
  ^ f * ck ^ putin ^ fired ^ me ^ help ^ me ^ i 'm ^ going ^ to ^ gulag ^ i ^ violated ^ the ^ national ^ shill ^ secrecy ^ act, 
  sure . 
  it 's okay , we just call them chechnya and dagestan , too , lol , even though they 're a part of russia . 
  the federal relationships within russia are not as formalized as relationships between states in the us where it 's clearly defined by the constitution , because in russia there are [ many different kinds of regions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_subjects_of_russia#terminology ) with different responsibilities and privileges , historically with different cultures and native ethnicities , at some point they could negotiate some special rules for themselves ( tatarstan ) , merge ( yamal-nenets district ) , separate ( chechnya was a union of [ chechnya and ingushetia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chechen-ingush_autonomous_soviet_socialist_republic ) , when the civil war started in the 1990s , ingushetia separated and declared itself a part of russia ) etc. 
  i find it funny they are using lenin 's example as one of the few true socialists as ... something positive ? 
   what is it with these people, 
  the question i 've been asking too . 
  pedophilia seems like a quite rare perversion , if we suppose that pizzagate and stuff are not exaggerations or conspiracy theories , what would cause * so many * people in power to actually be attracted to children ? 
  if they were involved in trafficking of adults , okay , perverse , abusive , but understandable from the point of view that most people are attracted to sexually mature people , but what causes there to be such a high concentration of apparent pedophiles ? 
  dr. ben carson is that you ? 
  instructions unclear , have no holiday cookie tin , donated $ 777 to trump 's 2020 re-election campaign . 
   it 's an art form to tell some to f-off eloquently .
