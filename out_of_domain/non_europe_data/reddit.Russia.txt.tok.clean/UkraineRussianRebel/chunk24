  only bush somehow managed to convince people it 's not the case . 
  the `` dictators '' are far less dangerous than they 're made out to be , after all , the us cooperated with saddam hussein against iran ( was he not a dictator back then ) without fearing how `` threatening '' he is . 
  are saudi family not dicators ? 
  absolute monarchy means just that . 
  this is turning into a rant , but how about somalia ? 
  is having not a unified somalia under some dictator but today 's somalia a benefit that makes one safer ? 
  it definitely does n't make international maritime trade safer . 
  the routes are longer as the ships avoid the horn of africa , the defense is more costly as there is no one to suppress the pirates . 
  a dictator would definitely find it more beneficial to open and operate a port in mogadishu and collect fees for its usage than to pirate . 
  trump ~ ~ has ~ ~ sells ties ~ ~ in ~ ~ to russia !, 
  i believe china abstained most of the time but they [ did vote veto ] ( http://algonjaner.000webhostapp.com/abstain.jpg ) a few times . 
  did n't really find total statistics on how much they abstained or vetoed though . 
  for the kind of organization it is , their website is pretty bad . 
  you have to dig through resolutions and and articles just to find the voting record instead of there just being a list of votes . 
  * wrong . 
  * we cared . 
   according to south korean media , residents in the kingdom, 
  did they intentionally call north korea a kingdom ? 
  ( i mean it is in practice , but still it kind of decreases `` credibility '' by inaccuracy ), 
  they did n't make sense even before . 
  it 's as if the fact they did n't * yet * attack a city specifically in sweden at the point when they posted it the first time somehow invalidated the argument , or proved that `` islamic terrorism does n't exist '' , just substitute a `` city in sweden '' for paris , nice , berlin , brussels , london , new york , boston , mumbai , istanbul , munich , moscow , st. petersburg , volgograd , tel aviv , jerusalem , madrid ... 
  also : `` haha , the bowling green massacre did n't happen , it was just two iraqis planning a terror attack arrested ! '', 
  i know people doing this 100 % for free . 
  they do n't see patterns , they do n't see the forest , they only see many , many trees but never draw conclusion that they 're , in fact , in a forest . 
  it 's just many trees . 
  it 's just many islamic terror attacks , muslims explicitly saying they believe islam is superior to any other culture and should be adopted by everyone , everywhere , but all of those people are just individual trees that never make a forest . 
  t h o u g h t c r i m e, 
  a forest consists of lone trees . 
  [ russia , putin , the russians . 
  putin , kremlin , and the russian government ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljuolelv7ck ), 
  caucasus emirate and vilayat dagestan ( pledged allegiance to isis , operates in southern russia -,

  0.1 % of the us population would be 300,000 i believe , but still wtf,

  [ relevant : hollande is a misogynist ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-12/hollande-says-in-video-he-would-prefer-that-a-man-succeed-him ), 
   if you look at it wrong it will detonate, 
  so you used a muslim/sjw bomb against muslims ? 
  i had no idea i had this phobia until reading op 's comment on how the bomb works . 
  fortunately i 'm not isis digging tunnels . 
  they think it went like this , probably : of course , trump ordered the bomb yesterday , they even offered that he could instead send the money somewhere else , but he insisted : no , i wo n't help flint . 
  i wo n't help school districts . 
  i want to drop bombs on afghanistan , i wo n't send that money anywhere other than afghanistan bomb . 
  really , is this how they on r/redacted think it works ? 
  never mind [ this ] ( http://thehill.com/policy/international/315782-obama-administration-released-221-million-in-aid-money-to-palestinians ) was one of the last things obama did as president . 
   knew about them, 
  but maybe they were n't used by terrorist groups at the time ( when the us was in the area ) , so it was not a concern ? 
  i do n't know , just a version . 
  that would be saudi arabia . 
  most muslim terrorism is committed by sunnis , and especially the radical wahhabi sect which supplies the formal ideology . 
  and here is what wikipedia has to say about the [ sides in the syrian civil war ] ( https://i.redd.it/jh13tts08cqy.jpg ) . 
  assad himself is a shia alawite , a very moderate muslim group - who some say are n't even muslims as the have many traditions from christianity and greek philosophy . 
  notice how [ his wife ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/c3drtz1ucaatrof.jpg ) is dressed . 
  even around [ `` other men '' ] ( http://images2.fanpop.com/image/photos/12100000/asma-al-assad-first-lady-asma-12159375-500-340.jpg ) , which is impermissible in islam . 
  ~ ~ why is trump in hijab ? 
  nevermind , it 's supposed to be medieval europe . 
  just saw the splash screen . 
  i 'm tiny but upset , after the `` bill clinton is a rapist '' i expected infowars.com to be written on a wall somewhere . 
  remember * these * 3 words , too :, 
  #lock her up, 
  #in a van, 
  no , please do n't bomb any country with a muslim , germany can still be saved ... 
  on a serious note , i think trump has better information sources than nbc . 
  they make fun of him that `` he gets all his info from fox news '' , but i seriously doubt that . 
  the whole situation around north korea now is quite disturbing , though . 
  any side can `` miscalculate '' . 
  i researched it yesterday a bit , many people on t_d , as well as news sites , said it was thermobaric but apparently it 's not . 
   this bomb , which has a relatively thin casing , is not a penetrator , but a `` demolition bomb '' designed for a surface burst . 
   contrary to some published claims , it most certainly is not an ethylene-oxide fuel-air explosive ( fae ) . 
  some initial reports had stated that this replacement for the blu-82 bomb uses more of the slurry of ammonium nitrate and powdered aluminum used in the blu-82 . 
  other reports indicated that the moab might use tritonal explosive as opposed to the gelled slurry explosive of the blu-82 . 
  contrary to some reports , it is not capable of deep ground penetration . 
  they hired the russian hackers . 
  [ let 's say chyna ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdrfe9i8_hs ),

  it 's ... very distrubing . 
  operation fat man : [ little boy ] ( http://i.magaimg.net/img/d12.jpg ), 
  wants to make peaces of salami out of you . 
  you ca n't stop progress you bigot . 
  that would be cnn , [ clinton ] ( https://youtu.be/ljuolelv7ck?t=2s ) and the `` election hacking '' . 
  have been looking for [ this book ] ( https://www.amazon.com/xi-jinping-governance-english-language/dp/160220408x ) by him in libraries . 
  i 've read a few pages in a bookstore and kind of came to a similar conclusion that he seems to be a pretty good/reasonable leader . 
  i do n't care enough to actually buy the book but i 'm interested enough to look if i can find it somewhere lol .

   when i saw some bad hombre beating an innocent man, 
  [ battlehymn of the reeeeeeeeeepublic ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jm_euqsyak ), 
  nothing annoys me more than the privileged normies saying that kekistanis are n't oppressed instead of checking their privilege and acknowledging the inherent anti-kekistani bigotry that exists in our society . 
  cnn denies taqqiya exists , and if it does , it 's for `` muslims to protect themselves against prejudiced islamophobes '', 
  the afghan government spokesman and police commander are a trump shill and a russian bot , respectively . 
  is it bad i 'm fine with the jews winning against isis ? 
  moderate islamists . 
  yes , islamist used to imply radical by definition , but [ no more ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/3d37fe9a-8d68-11e6-8df8-d3778b55a923 ) !, 
  i met people like that irl . 
  one told me that wahhabis are actually a jewish sect ( that controls islam ) . 
  america is a puppet of israel .
