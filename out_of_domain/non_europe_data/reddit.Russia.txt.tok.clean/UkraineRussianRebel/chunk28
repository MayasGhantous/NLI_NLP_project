  however , i somehow do n't trust the `` classic '' conservatives . 
  they are never doing what they promise to do , and they never promise actual , concrete , non-rhetorical solutions ( we will be `` tough on terror '' - fillon instead of `` we will close the borders and deport terrorists '' - le pen ) , they 're scared of being no longer called `` conservative '' but going into the `` far-right '' or `` alt-right '' or `` islamophobic sexist bigots '' category . 
  le pen , trump , wilders and other real conservatives are not scared of that . 
  you are being downvoted . 
  shills do n't want law and order . 
  in a law and order society , you ca n't attack people with bikelocks on a chain . 
  it 's the antithesis of anarchy and antifa-archy . 
  there is a special place in hell for women who do n't vote for women -- madeline albright, 
  well madeline , you must love le pen , right ... 
  right ? 
   but how can we take care of them, 
  i may sound selfish and cruel but we have no obligation to care for them . 
  i am a foreigner in europe myself , it baffles me that those newcoming muslims - and those living in europe for generations - believe they are absolutely entitled to getting stuff from europeans , housing included . 
  that getting government handouts is not an extreme short-term help you get if you are unemployed and at risk of , say , falling to the bottom , but a constant mode of life and a source of additional income . 
  it 's crazy . 
  no one who has not contributed to the social system - by working and paying taxes - is entitled to free education , healthcare , housing help and other benefits of living in europe . 
  it 's not a charity . 
  i would be sad but not angry if it were exclusively liberals , multiculturalists and others who vote for that becoming victims of terror attacks , mass rapes and migrant violence -- they were advised against that but chose it anyway , it 's like someone destroying themselves with drugs : sad , but their choice . 
  you were constantly being told since elementary : drugs are bad , do n't do drugs , but you did n't believe . 
  but in reality it 's liberals getting their open borders , cultural enrichment , `` terrorism is a small price to pay for all these great benefits of muslim immigration '' - and everyone becomes a victim , because the terrorist does not ask whom you voted for before detonating a bomb in a subway or shooting with a rifle . 
  leftists may think `` the risk is worth it '' , but i , and millions of other people , do n't . 
  security issues should be non-negotiable . 
  you ca n't let delusional hippies decide that terrorism `` is fine to some degree . '', 
  some kind of impossibility of deliberately introducing threat to your country should be enshrined into european countries ' constitutions , somehow . 
  maybe le pen and other rational leaders will achieve something like that . 
  `` we need to really have a nationawide conversation of what the proper place for islam should be '' -- leftists,

  they think that they will stop the nationalist/patriotic/conservative tide if le pen loses this particular election . 
  as if people would just say `` okay , i guess they won and we really have to learn to live with terrorism and give up our countries '' . 
  they are just pressing the snooze button . 
  it 's a [ hillary pepe ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/od4zby8hlna/maxresdefault.jpg ) !, 
  who 's the third one ? 
   `` we need this food for russians '', 
  lol . 
  you do realize that the holodomor , which is almost exclusively referred to as `` ukrainian '' in the west for political reasons , was also taking place in southern russia , northern caucasus , volga , south siberia , north kazakhstan and other agricultural areas all over russia/ussr , and had millions of victims there as well ? 
  it was inteded to destroy the independent farmer class by the bolsheviks . 
   the soviet famine of 1932 -- 33 affected the major grain-producing areas of the soviet union , leading to millions of deaths in those areas and severe food shortage throughout the ussr . 
  these areas included ukraine , northern caucasus , volga region and kazakhstan , [ 2 ] the south urals , and west siberia . 
  edit : addes some sources, 
  not too many that i found in english but here are some . 
  i will keep looking . 
  english wikipedia :, 
   severe food shortage throughout the ussr . 
  these areas included ukraine , northern caucasus , volga region and kazakhstan , [ 2 ] the south urals , and west siberia . 
  [ 3 ] [ 4 ] gareth jones was the first western journalist to report the inhumane devastation . 
  [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ a ] the subset of the famine within the ukrainian soviet socialist republic and the kuban , all of which were heavily populated by ukrainians , is referred to as holodomor . 
  russian wikipedia has a more detailed victims count ( 3.2 million ukraine , 2.74 million volga region , 2.61 northern caucasus , 1.1 million siberia ), 
  europe-asia studies , stalin and the soviet famine revisited http://paulbogdanor.com/left/soviet/famine/ellman1933.pdf, 
   the three ethnic groups that suffered the most from the famine of 1931 -- 34 were the, 
  ukrainians , kazakhs and russians . 
   between 1929 and 1932 the soviet communist party struck a double blow at the russian peasantry : dekulakization , the dispossession and deportation of millions of peasant families , and collectivization , the abolition of private ownership of land and the concentration of the remaining peasants in party-controlled `` collective '' farms . 
  globalsecurity : 1928-1933 collectivization and dekulakization ( removal of the `` capitalist element from soviet agriculture '' ) http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/stalin-collectivization.htm, 
  famine in the volga region ( 1932-1933 ) - memories ( scepsis journal - blank pages of russian history - collecitivization and stalinism period ), 
  pointing out that someone is simply wrong is not really all that pretentious . 
  but i 'm not going to argue , if you think that pointing that out is pretentious , so be it . 
  but yeah i do find it pretty wrong how many politicians are always trying to spin holodomor into some kind of `` russian genocide against ukrainians '' , deliberately omitting the millions of russian/kazakh/caucasian / central asian victims of the very same famine . 
  it 's even a bit creepy tbh . 
  kinda [ reminds me of ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/6e/1d/c7/6e1dc715a4be9a675a8811ee38af0ee1.jpg ) haha, 
  well , it 's the end of the world as we know it now . 
  you know , the one where politicians are telling you that you should learn to live with terrorism , that your country is n't really your country , that france does n't have culture ( france . 
  france !!!, 
  effing france does n't have culture , says a french presidential candidate ... smh ) , that illegals can vote , men can be women if they really , really want to and so on . 
   this image taken by the moscow canal was taken when nikolai yezhov was water commissar . 
  his time in office is known as the `` yezhovshchina '' ( russian : \u0415\u0436\u043e\u0432\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430 ) , [ 3 ] a term coined during the de-stalinization campaign of the 1950s . 
  [ note 1 ] after presiding over mass arrests and executions during the great purge , yezhov became a victim of it himself . 
  he was arrested , confessed under torture to a range of anti-soviet activity , and was executed in 1940 . 
  bonus : holy f * ck i did n't see [ this one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/soviet_censorship_with_stalin2.jpg/800px-soviet_censorship_with_stalin2.jpg ) before ( do n't know who those people are though ), 
  they have several papers with candidate names , one goes to the ballot box , the other to the bin .
