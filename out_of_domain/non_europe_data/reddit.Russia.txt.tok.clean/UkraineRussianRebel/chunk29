  the biggest disappointment so far was when austria had a third round , and hofer/ofp still lost by a few percent . 
  however , if the us had the same electoral system as european countries do , you would 've possibly had a clinton president . 
  someone tried to drive a car into the polling place in some town , they later found a rifle in there , the drivers run away ( according to bbc ) . 
  they deployed 50,000 soldiers and police to protect polling places - it 's kind of like in those countries like iraq when they hold elections for the first time after a war ( or ever ) and terrorists keep trying to disrupt . 
  le pen needs to win . 
  it 's ridiculous to need an army in a european country to protect a polling place . 
  voting was temporarily suspended at the pierre-et-marie-curie school in the eastern town of besan\u00e7on after a car was driven at speed towards the polling station by two occupants who fled , leaving the engine running . 
  de-miners from strasbourg were called in and gave the all-clear not long afterwards . 
  l'est r\u00e9publicain newspaper said a rifle had been found in the peugeot 308 . 
  it is unclear who the occupants were . 
  voting has now resumed . 
  voting is not compulsory in france , so that 's weird . 
  [ it was always too late ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jxkn53l.jpg ), 
  i love diversity !, 
  i do n't want the world and europe to be [ like this on the left ] ( https://images-cdn.9gag.com/photo/axjzx4d_700b.jpg ) !, 
  sure , you 're right . 
  that 's what he said after the election when clinton started whining that `` it does n't count '' because `` electoral college is injustice '' . 
  does n't look good , images of [ crowds of macron supporters at polling places ] ( http://www.recommendeddaily.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/natashas-macarons-091714.jpg ) keep pouring in :(, 
  le pen took a loan in a russian bank because all other banks refused . 
  she then made an argument when the media started going on about `` russian interference '' : when you take a mortgage or a loan , is the bank then controlling what you are doing and following your every step , or do they only want you to pay the installment ? 
  * point fr, 
  it 's on [ live coverage ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-39683594 ) at 13:25 ( ca n't link exact section because they only allow facebook/twitter , not direct link ), 
  i just want to remind everyone what happens if le pen does n't win . 
  i urge you to boycott france ( especially macarons ) in that case . 
  we ca n't support a country with so many sexist misogynist bigots who do n't want a woman president , do n't want to break the glass ceiling and allow young girls to dream big and know they can too be presidents and prime ministers !, 
  / s -- maybe, 
  only if they 're citizens . 
  they all vote socialist ( obviously ) . 
  this is the music of the people, 
  who will not be slaves again, 
  [ vote ] ( https://www.penchalet.com/images/products/countries/7.jpg ), 
  1 % chance of winning !, 
  he will never take texas !, 
  georgia is in play !, 
  mississippi leaning clinton !, 
  damn , i read that as `` convinced '' ... 
  little bites mittens, 
  `` globalists are scared of people around the globe uniting '', 
  this question is 0 % retarded . 
  been looking for a politico/nyt style map like there were for the us election . 
  noooo !, 
  it 's teh russians hacking elections in favor of le pen , you got it all wrong !!! 1 ! 111 !!!, 
  literally rothschild , not just some bank , rothschild ... anyone has a better conspiracy material ? 
  we need to protect the traditional * family ( socialists ), 
  * muslim , not french traditional family, 
  possible dystopian future : president macron [ makes a gift to his most loyal supporters ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/a2vigq9cyaa8tlo.jpg ), 
  if we ca n't integrate muslims into france , we will integrate the french into islam !, 
  not french algeria , algerian france !, 
  it 's the only leftist plan for peace . 
  i want to challege liberal values !, 
  please someone challenge liberal values !, 
  macron is an outsider ? 
  lmao, 
  macaron voters celebrating with their [ battle cry high energy song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l12csc_lw0q ) !, 
  more people voting for a crazy literal communist ( melenchon ) than fillon is still disturbing though . 
  i thought it was the rushens ? 
  `` will probably win '', 
  collapse of `` two mainstream parties '' ? 
  socialists have a near-majority in the parliament . 
  ( 280 seats ) definitely a mainstream party . 
  ( he 's not a member but still supported by them ), 
  did he say `` fukdemal '' ? 
  where is le pen ? 
  what is this fake reporting ? 
  some guy who got 7 % of the vote has whole speech broadcasted but not her and fn ? 
  yeah , that guy is hollande . 
  he 's worse than hollande . 
  so was hillary ( compare to bernie , the equivalent of melencommie ) . 
  tied 23 % le pen , 23 % macron . 
  #ijeb !, 
  oh look , a probable clinton shill . 
  may end up like [ austria ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-austria-election-iduskbn13s0w0 ) :(, 
  this is not fair , russians hacked macaroni and now he 's losing :( they also hacked muslims to help le pen !!!, 
  he 's not a real socialist . 
  no one is a real socialist . 
  nothing is ever real socialism !, 
  hey guys macaron is not a real socialist , no one is a real socialist , nothing is real socialism , venezuela is not socialism and the ussr was not socialism , north korea is a state-controlled capitalism and mao zedong was not a real socialist , lenin was a fake socialist and stalin was a non-socialist , trotsky was an anti-socialist and bernie was a socialist but then he lost the election and is no longer a socialist , guevara wanted to be a socialist but he failed at being a socialist , and cuba is almost never socialist because castro is not a socialist . 
  it 's no longer france . 
  i 'd go to poland . 
  or hungary . 
  watch bloomberg , they 're interviewing le pen 's strategist . 
  bloomberg is interviewing le pen 's strategist . 
  students protesting against le pen outside her headquarters . 
  would n't be surprised if french expats in the us voted macron . 
  expats are ... like that , in my experience . 
  even american expats are mostly pro-clinton `` cosmopolites '' . 
  `` probability of le pen winning is in single digits according to our models '', 
  haha, 
  `` le pen has a history of violence , she is a danger to our country . 
  my dream is a free country '' ... wtf . 
  cretin . 
  fillon : `` i 'll be tough on terrorism ! '', 
  also fillon : `` vote for the guy who wants terrorism and more multiculturalism , people who are tough on terrorism are dangerous ! '', 
  literally bernie ... oh i lost , vote for the establishment and banks , i guess . 
  thanks no refunds . 
  this got a large part of bernie people vote for trump . 
  hard to say but i 'll just take a bet on [ the russians !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljuolelv7ck ), 
  there are two kinds of people : those voting for le pen and [ the other kind ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26-vzfbzg1w ),
