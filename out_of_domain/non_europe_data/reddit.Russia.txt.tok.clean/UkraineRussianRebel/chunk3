  but ... but they type the numbers into the computer . 
  i did not understand what change was , because i was convinced that everyone pays exactly the amount they made purchases for , so when the cashier was giving some money back , i thought that the shop was doing it out of generosity and was saying `` thank you for shopping at our shop '' that way . 
  i do n't get it . 
  how old were you that you were old enough to drive and thought a non-alcoholic drink is was not allowed on the car ? 
  google maps link , please ? 
  is there a street view ? 
  i was creepy . 
  it was in high school and i wrote that i loved her on a table where she used to sit . 
  she told her bodybuilder classmate who then threatened me . 
  also , i got her number from her friend without her knowing and sent her a text . 
  i later tried to conceal who sent the text because i understood it crossed the ultimate creepiness threshold ; once , i was in a class where she went , chatting to my friend and was showing her something on my phone , when the girl decided to make a test and called me . 
  my friend then exclaimed : `` oh , someone 's calling you ! '', 
  `` no , no one '' , i said ( my ringing tone was turned off , so no one could hear , but everyone looked at us ) . 
  my friend sort of did n't get the hint ( or she was negotiated with the girl ? ), 
  and said : `` oh , no , someone is . 
  look at the number , it 's 732 ... '', 
  i then turned it off quickly and went away . 
  i was then getting threatening texts from all her friends . 
  it was last year . 
  well , but it was n't her who gave me the number . 
  i am , in addition , not sure she would have . 
  oh , i imagined some special structure looming over the fence there . 
  there are two kinds of people , those who get upvoted and those who do n't . 
  one day , suddenly , chrome stopped loading anything . 
  water ? 
  so if i post a comment , can i ban myself ? 
  people were talking about it , but it 's actually an interesting question . 
  i 've always assumed that the rule is `` must be born in the us '' but does `` natural born citizen '' imply being born on the us territory , or just being a citizen by birth and not naturalization ? 
  isis ? 
  what isis ? 
  are you implying the motives have been untangled ? 
  this rampant gif violence needs to stop . 
  no way ... `` wee fuk dup '', 
  i ca n't seem to find one type of male there ... 
  i know we 're not allowed to refer to subs , but just in a hint , where is this from ? 
  hillary will not start ww3 . 
  she , fortunately , will never ever have the chance or possibility . 
  can you imagine the darkness of a timeline where trump would * not * be president ? 
  the frog of peace, 
  there is no reddit . 
  * the site is just called the_donald now . 
  funny how some have the `` relevant xkcd '' and we have the relevant trump tweet every time . 
  too bad it 's not the same author , that would 've been even better . 
  on the other hand , hillary was just like the first one when trump just suggested the possibility of a voter fraud , and then turned into the bottom one immediately on nov 9th . 
  the most offensive thing in your comment is the * _ sub _ * . 
   he 's the real soros puppet . 
  are they implying he 's a soros puppet because his son-in-law is jewish , and there is this massive jewish conspiracy thing going on ? 
   which they know will lead people to hit the share button as quickly as possible , often without reading the article . 
  to be fair , such headlines are not just the mainstream media problem . 
  it 's a regular tactics employed by all kinds of writers and media . 
  but yes , the amount of people who comment without reading the articles is very high . 
  sorry , until i got to the last line , 2.016 seconds elapsed . 
  thanks , obama !, 
  [ i kept a christmas tree from the last year ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/5iwkt8/i_kept_a_christmas_tree_from_the_last_year/ ), 
  the flag [ beginning with a white stripe ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=american+flag&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=638&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjpxucolpzqahxdcfakhbpxb5kq_auibigb ) is unsettling to me , for some reason .

  this note is a legal [ tender ] ( http://assets.culvers.com/menu-item-images/800/web-buffalo-chicken-tenders.jpg ), 
  hahaha , they tried to sue him for this , alongside trump and all the other florida electors . 
  the plaintiffs ' argument includes that `` the election was hacked . '', 
  i think we now have another musician to add to our rsbn playlist . 
   washington , d.c. , ** public ** school marching band, 
  i mean , given the news about the teachers ' reactions and all , is there a chance maybe it was softly suggested to them that they not apply ? 
  haha , i unwittingly quoted this saying to my school teacher once . 
  she just said : well , * thanks * . 
  like mormon tabernacle ? 
  trump did win utah , after all . 
  i know they 've probably never heard of him , but saul alinsky , rule 8 :, 
   `` keep the pressure on . 
  never let up . '' keep trying new things to keep the opposition off balance . 
  as the opposition masters one approach , hit them from the flank with something new . 
  where is the trigglypuff bot when you need it ? 
  they do n't need to worry about this one too much . 
  the global warming will take care . 
  i never thought salon was actually perceived as `` media '' by someone . 
  always saw it as an opinion blog , with all opinions being the same . 
  also :, 
   impossible to pick a side in @slate & @salon 's race to the bottom . 
  remember how the tolerant left reacted to milo ? 
  funny how the west appropriated words like political correctness , class warfare , capitalist exploitation from us , lol . 
  not in the western from of being it presented as `` enforced politeness . '', 
  what i meant is that it resembles just the form of censorship that existed throughout all forms of authoritarian/communist governments -- an analogy , the postulate of which thinking is `` politically correct '' and which is not , determined by the government . 
  but when you read the old books printed during communism ( in russia and other socialist countries ) , the ones that deal with politics , western philosophy and similar topics , in the beginning they almost always have a clause like `` marxism-leninism has shown us the correct path '' , sort of like the modern `` diversity & inclusion correct thinking '' classes that the us apparently makes mandatory . 
  like i was reading this book from 1970s on aesthetics in western philosophy out of curiosity , the entire introduction was basically a trigger warning on how `` what you are about to read is not what the marxist theory and the cpsu think is correct so take it with a grain of salt . '', 
  this is his wife .

  i remember reading about this on some russian site . 
  it 's on some obscure shore area in nyc , and supposedly most new yorkers even do n't know about this . 
  good luck , ** comrade ** . 
  and the eu says their government is becoming `` dangerously illiberal '' and `` defies common european values '' ... coincidence ? 
  it 's sad when saying merry christmas makes one a counterculture-rebel . 
  this should be a sticky . 
  it wo n't reach the reddit frontpage then , but it 's more important here . 
  what do you mean ? 
  it 's not donald trump themed yet ? 
  from the vanity fair article . 
  she 's a clinton insider , but even so this is nasty :, 
   abedin appeared within the rope line while clinton greeted her morose and woebegone supporters .
