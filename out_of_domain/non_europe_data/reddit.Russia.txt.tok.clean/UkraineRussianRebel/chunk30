  is she saying ... 
  she does not want to surrender france to the false song of globalism ? 
  is paris basically the sf and bay area , without the bay ? 
  de gaulle is the honest abe of france . 
  no one can blame the onest abe ` incoln !!, 
  '' '' `` center '' '' '', 
  lol right, 
  they think they will change reality through label , but reality is changing the label . 
  when they say `` far-right '' , i no longer imagine some feebleminded neo-nazi skinheads but le pen , trump , orban etc. 
  like `` deplorables '' . 
  `` extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice . 
  and moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue . '', 
  who else is proud to be a far-right deplorable trumpist-lepenist centipede ? 
  but it 's rt , the russians paid them to : /, 
  but paris is , presumably , the french california . 
  are they seriously comparing macron to trump on france24 ? 
  macron is `` addressing real problems '' and is `` pragmatic '' and `` populist '' ? 
  hahahahahahahaha are you kidding me ? 
  do n't insult trump like that, 
  continental europe also has the east side !, 
  ( enough of a reason ) . 
  portugal and spain are fine , too !, 
  it 's the media . 
  does france have something like breitbart ? 
  wrong kind of a woman !, 
  they want a [ submissive ] ( http://time.com/4649987/madeleine-albright-donald-trump-muslim/ ) woman , not a strong independent one who knows what she wants . 
  remember r/deutschlandistan, 
  this is what happens if macron wins, 
  do n't be like r/deutschlandistan, 
  do n't be frenchistan, 
  do n't be r/swedistan, 
  oh wow her dad insulted `` de dzhuvish pipul '' a decade ago once , that makes her terrible because there 's a succession guilt for three generations like in nk , right ? 
  i like their accents , can they stop saying stupid propaganda stuff ? 
  conflating europe with the eu . 
  anti eu people are not anti-europe , they 're pro-europe . 
  eu is anti-europe . 
  no , she thinks europeans are offended . 
  eu is not europe !, 
  uh well i guess that proves it was a fn-russia false flag / s, 
  is the guy a sharia surpemacist ? 
  but she `` authoritarian '' and wants to deport terrorists , that 's very un-republican and un-democratic , the proper democratic way is to cry for a while , turn off some lights and warn against islamophobia . 
  winning , 25.8 to 21.5, 
  wow they 're quick . 
  paristan votes coming in soon . 
  i 'd go further and say that pro-eu is anti-european these days . 
  suburbs of paris ( hauts-de-seine ) 43 % fillon , what, 
  the best one !, 
  please clap, 
  please i want to see this, 
  islam is n't really hostile, 
  they do n't really believe islam is superior to christianity or any other culture, 
  they do n't really behead people and do n't really form their parties , do n't really have sharia courts, 
  there 's no mass immigration crisis and mass violence and rapes, 
  it 's a paranoia, 
  it 's made up, 
  it 's not happening, 
  tfw you like a communist more than a `` cuckservative '' `` catholic '' `` christian '' `` patriot '', 
  it gained traction and a grass-roots support with a small loan of a billion dollars from george soros and baron rothschild . 
  but in fact , the anti-feminism women voted for le pen . 
  ( that 's a good thing , feminism is destructive and irrational these days ), 
  well but americans still landed in normandy, 
  benoit [ hamon ] ( http://www.espanarusa.com/files/autoupload/77/70/36/qjjdzomr364891.jpg ), 
  anti-eu = pro-europe, 
  anti-europe = pro-eu, 
  republic is in danger if people vote the wrong way . 
  you can vote but you have to choose from the list of people we approve for you . 
  why do they sound like literal bolsheviks ? 
  lenin said that he will respect the [ russian election in 1917 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_constituent_assembly_election,_1917 ) if bolsheviks win and people do n't make `` the mistake of not voting for us '' , they only got 24 % so he started a violent revolution to `` save the republic '' . 
  hahahaha [ saint-denis ] ( http://www.neveragaincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/0e9e37683b13459db25cbdbda5c3e0d6_18-e1471894642128.jpg ) is only 12 % marine . 
  [ saint denis ] ( http://www.catholic.org/files/images/media/2015/01/09/14208481844686_700.jpg ) . 
  [ saint-denis ] ( http://www.limitstogrowth.org/web-graphics/sharia4franceburqas.jpg ) !, 
  lmao, 
  extreme left is `` estrema sinistra '' in italian, 
  yeah , it 's very sinister, 
  i like the flag but not what it stands for, 
  i 'd like to remind you of this , french [ liberals singing `` oh happy days '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eszyhcp0yqc ) right after the november 2015 terror attack in paris . 
  these people are now protesting in paris against le pen and the `` threat of nationalism and populism '' . 
  the new face of french socialist politics , cucky mccuckface, 
  the poverty of leftism and multiculturalism . 
  they ca n't say anything of substance . 
  it could be offensive to at least someone . 
  they 're shilling for [ him ] ( http://www.seriouseats.com/assets_c/2014/02/20140214-macaroni-and-cheese-baked-potato-broccoli-cheese-nacho-01-thumb-625xauto-383784.jpg ) so hard , trying to make him seem exciting somehow lol, 
  macron is not so new in politics as they 're trying to present him , i found an [ early 2000s ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l12csc_lw0q ) speech by him and nothing changed much . 
  `` macron is against the system . '', 
  stop culturally appropriating populism it 's a kekistani national value reeeeeeeeeeeee, 
  i think he 's actually pretty surprising . 
  i did n't expect that . 
  i expected something like `` we have to integrate them more '' , classic leftist naivety , but 500 euro culture pass ... that 's a plot twist, 
  edit : did n't he say france has no culture before ?!, 
  what culture does he want them to know , they already have muslim culture which he apparently thinks is better ? 
  the left in 2008 - fuck christianity , fuck the west, 
  the left in 2017 - fuck christianity , fuck the west, 
  `` you have a right to my own opinion . '', 
  i have only been there once ( in a village near swiss border ) but am scared of going to a place like paris :( it sounds like chiraq but chiraq has less terrorism i think, 
  yes , this election is about marine le pen . 
  just like the only really relevant person in the us election was trump . 
  idk , the numbers are the same on repubblica ? 
  the socialist party can still win, 
  match me !, 
  * wrong *,
