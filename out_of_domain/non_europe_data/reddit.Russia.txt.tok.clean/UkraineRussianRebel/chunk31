  you have a month old account with one comment , did you make it for your great debut here on t_d ? 
  lol, 
  is she not running in paris or are the votes so low they 're just not showing her ? 
  ( the italian site only shows first three it seems ), 
  whom would soros support ? 
  once you have the answer , do not under any circumstances vote for that person . 
  remember when leftists believed in [ this ] ( http://www.joemygod.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bushtrumphillary-660x330.jpg ) ? 
  look at the r/neoliberal sub , saying that macron makes people question their patritotism and is `` the worst thing to happen to populism '', 
  ha ha, 
  they are . 
  election counting , bangladesh style . 
  `` i do n't like that candidate so i will toss some of those out , ok ? '', 
  islam does n't exist . 
  it 's not real islam . 
  can we try islam one more time , this time it will be peaceful , i promise . 
  but prophet muhammad was not a * real * muslim . 
  you can only understand quran if you read it in arabic . 
  * isis does not understand the quran . 
  * i promise democratic islamism , it 's different from regular islamism . 
  due to overpopulation in africa ? 
  it 's like he thinks france has more space than africa to store those people on ? 
  i mean , i am no geography expert , but i think that africa 's territory of 30,700,000 km ^ 2 is larger than france 's ~ 640,000 km ^ 2, 
   understand that their entire culture is falling apart, 
  your culture ca n't be falling apart if you do n't have one . 
  french art ? 
  i have never seen any . 
  -- macron, 
  weaponized citroens . 
  no , that 's a muslim thing . 
  the two most successful candidates will go to the second round on may 7th , currently it 's macron ( 23.4 % ) and le pen ( 22.3 % ) . 
  then whoever gains the majority wins . 
  those were n't my * real * policies !, 
  yes . 
  the results in the first round have no relevance for the second . 
  i might as well start identifying as far-right the way we appropriated `` deplorable '' . 
  i mean , if far-right now means trump , le pen , farage and wilders , what 's bad about being far-right ? 
  the label is not changing reality , reality is changing the meaning of the label . 
  nah , ~ ~ trump wo n't even get the nomination ~ ~ , ~ ~ i do n't think they 'll actually let him get the nomination at the convention ~ ~ , ~ ~ the first debate will destroy him ~ ~ , ~ ~ clinton has a 97 % chance of winning ~ ~ , if we scream loudly enough and wear pussyhats , he will be impeached , right , that 's how it works , does n't it ? 
  beep blop, 
   did you know that twitter now has a new feature ? 
  you can vote for emanuel macron from the comfort of your home !, 
  just type 1-100-macron with the hashtag #president on may 7th any time between 8:00 and 20:00 when the polls are open . 
  fake news !, 
  antifa does n't assault people , they always protest peacefully and it 's those trump supporters who attack themselves with bike locks and chains and then blame antifa !, 
  policies ? 
  what policies ? 
  all you need to know is that macaroni is awesome and le pen is a `` threat to the republic '' . 
  today we found out that france24 is basically cnn . 
  obama ca n't rig elections , rigging = hacking + russia !, 
  `` safe '', 
  that 's the greatest irony of this all . 
  someone thinking that option could ever be `` safe '' . 
  electric boogaloo ? 
  this this this . 
  the election , it 's not really le pen vs macron , or trump vs hillary , or hofer vs van der bellen , or merkel vs petry ... sure , there is possibly , likely , some vote manipulation , austria after all had to have a third round due to vote manipulations - but it 's still a democratic election . 
  the people running will only get to power if they 're elected : it 's people who want to save their country against the ones who do n't . 
  how does the former even happen ? 
  normally i 'd have no problem with someone caring for children from a former marriage , all kind of stuff happens , people divorce , custody etc. , but this guy is a dangerous politician who will possibly destroy his country ( and due to france 's influence in the eu , he may start some kind of `` we need more europe , not less '' kind of thing ) , him being a literal cuck and a pervert ( who marries their high school teacher , really ? ), 
  is definitely something that needs to be used politically against him . 
  well , 15 is age of consent there , i 'm not aware if they have any other restrictions ( like that the partners must not have more than 10 years difference if one of them is under 18 etc. 
  like some countries do ) so possibly it 's not illegal there . 
  they have a legislative election in june , currently front national has 2 seats ( they have a majoritarian system : one representative per constituency/district ) out of 577 but based on the fact le pen only won one county in 2012 presidential election , the fn will be really strong in the national assembly i believe . 
  the fact remains that if america did n't have the electoral college ( which , i agree , is a part of the uniqueness ) , clinton would 've been president now . 
  ( all other things equal : that is , supposing the campaigning strategy would 've remained the same -- but other things are never equal in practice , as others have pointed out , so *** possibly/likely he would 've won under simple majority of votes system , so can le pen *** ) so i think europe could possibly do that , i am not losing hope . 
  it could be very narrow , by less than 1 % maybe , but entirely possible . 
  it 's the advance towards free slaves . 
  slave-sharing economy . 
  communism . 
  ~ ~ meuga - make eu great again . ~ ~, 
  jk , eu was never great . 
  it stopped being great ( or at least useful ) when they made the whole parliament , commission and tons of other confusing , unelected bureaucracy superimposed on nation states ( ironically , violating the [ subsidiarity principle ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/atyourservice/en/displayftu.html?ftuid=ftu_1.2.2.html ) ), 
   that got it 's ass kicked twice in the last century in major wars . 
  i think that was germany and france was actually on the winning side each time ? 
  but yeah they had to be liberated by others , that 's true . 
  that was [ cruz at the convention ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cxrw3yzh3a&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3m16s ) . 
  fillon said [ `` le pen is a danger to the republic , vote macron '' ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/videos/2017-04-23/fillon-endorses-macron-after-conceding-defeat-video ), 
  they still counted it though : / but yes , she won in states that do n't even have voter id requirements and give driving licenses to illegals . 
  and , somehow , that 's legal for them to do . 
  funnily , liberals are now saying that the `` 3 million illegals voted '' is [ `` made up '' ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/18/us/voter-fraud-fort-worth-trial-rosa-marie-ortega.html?_r=0 ) but the supposed `` voter suppression '' and `` intimidation '' is real . 
  what is more likely , an illegal with a driving license voting , especially in conditions and states where asking about immigration status/citizenship is `` discrimination '' and `` dignity offense '' by default , or voters actually being denied entering the polling place ? 
  how come the latter allegation only made it to obscure fake-newsy liberal blogs , and was not picked up by major liberal newspapers like wapo or nyt ? 
  that would 've been a great scandal to use against trump , but was only featured on daily kos , boingboing , huffpo and similar leftist blogs presenting themselves as news . 
  true . 
  `` girl 's right to education '', 
  why do they have all these non-issues ? 
  almost every single person in the west is getting education . 
  they 're making it seem as if america were afghanistan where you get attacked if you 're a girl going to school . 
  i agree with you . 
  i mean eu post-1993 when the actual economic community started gradually turning into this bureaucracy and attempt at supra-state government . 
  it 's funny how all these obamas and other islamispeacers do n't even bother to check the word origin . 
  because something sounds similar , it does n't mean the origin or the root is the same ( especially in a foreign language like arabic ) . 
  did you [ try pork ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/678ou3/based_exmuslim_denounces_islam_for_pork_tweets/ ) ? 
  i live in europe and when the `` refugee '' crisis started , there was an anti-islam protest which was met by liberals / `` multicultural activists '' on the other side who protested `` fortress europe '' ( one of the many great words and phrases that were used by leftists to criticize us but we appropriated them and made them positive ) . 
  a discussion broke out ( yes , discussion , it was not antifa but more like college hippies ) , the anti-islamists started talking about jihad and how it never ends until everyone submits . 
  the activist responded that `` there is not just one kind of jihad , there is a jihad by sword and jihad through propagation of islam and trying to expand its influence '', 
  `` and why is that any better , it is still a desire to submit everyone through islam , subvert european civilization to 7th century customs , and it devolves to violent jihad if peace and `` convincing '' does n't work '', 
  `` aaaah but everyone has a right to compete on the marketplace of ideas !!!, 
  they have right to promote islam through jihad like everyone has with their ideas !!!, 
  muh tolerance and acceptance '', 
  oh , so now marketplace of ideas is a great thing .
