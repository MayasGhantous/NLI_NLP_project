  especially when one of those ideas wants to destroy the marketplace and become a monopoly . 
  barry hussein soetoro , my muslim faith, 
   new fights start over accusations of people not submitting enough, 
  so basically muslims are sjws in their own way ? 
  i imagined chuck schumer crying how trump 's travel ban is * sniff * mean spirited * whine * and un-american . 
  good book on the topic by an actual refugee who tried to teach about real islam and its roots , had to leave his country ( egypt ) because of threats from clerics . 
  then he had to leave germany as well , he was accused of `` sedition '' . 
  is this the beginning of the end for the democrat party ? 
   poor * uneducated islamophobic sexist bigoted xenophobic nativist patriarchal behind-the-times anti-progressive anti-intellectual * farmers ( gross ) . 
  ftfy, 
  i started identifying as a cultural orthodox christian when i found out about the bolshevik revolution and [ what they did to our temples ] ( http://s7.drugiegoroda.ru/4/369/36857-christ_saviour_explosion-1024x781.jpg ) . 
  ( i 'm not even talking what they did to christians ) . 
  now [ it 's back ] ( http://c1038.r38.cf3.rackcdn.com/group1/building2807/media/media_6.jpg ) though !, 
  they also [ demolished this ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/c3/1c/a4/c31ca4fdc4fa04dd986996f3cebb8ee0.jpg ) and built an unbearably ugly [ kgb building ] ( http://s5.drugiegoroda.ru/5/479/47935-lubyanka_cdm_view_from_panoramic_view_point_05-2015_img01.jpg ) ( left ) on that place . 
   slowly opening my eyes to the possibility of religion . 
  be a cultural christian . 
  it 's the best option for those not entirely `` into it '' ( agnostics , perhaps ? ), 
  but not atheists either . 
  i was looking for a video and only found him arguing about climate change . 
  i thought t_d was overreacting ( i mean liberals always argue about that stuff , why pay so much attention ? ), 
  but apparently i have to watch further . 
  that is horrifying . 
  ten feet higher . 
  bricks . 
  it 's okay , i 'll keep drinking that garbage ( i wo n't ), 
  the word is derived from ` liberty ' . 
  among the notable ( actual ) liberals were john locke , john stuart mill , james madison , t. jefferson , c. l de montesquieu , f. a. hayek , milton friedman , ludwig von mises ... now these ctrl-leftists are using the label , how pathetic . 
  i endorse you . 
  it 's berlusconi . 
  i believe this . 
  would you want to have anything in common with [ these guys ? 
  ] ( http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/nnils/29013737/1297241/1297241_original.jpg ), 
  there would be no problem with the eu ( in my view ) if brussels were less authoritarian , and if the most powerful countries there ( france , germany ) were not ruled by extreme liberals and leftists who are trying to force stuff like the `` refugee quotas '' on safe , independent countries , essentially telling them , like macron did to the french , that they are obliged to expose their countries to terrorism because `` that 's the right thing to do '' , and threaten sanctions if they refuse to compromise their security and sovereignty over such fundamental things like whom you let into your home . 
  *** warning : rant ahead ***, 
  oh , look , the eu is `` worried about the terrible conditions of refugees in hungarian detention camps '' . 
  what , are they supposed to live in a 5 star hotel at the expense of hungarians ? 
  and where are illegal , aggressive border ~ ~ crossers ~ ~ invaders , about whom there is known pretty much nothing ( you can hardly ask a government in syria , iraq , or somalia who those people are when they do n't even have access to records in many cities where the archives were either destroyed or held by rebels or isis ) , supposed to be if not in a detention camp ? 
  are they supposed to run freely on the streets ? 
  where is that happening , which country would allow that ? 
  where can you just go in without any passport , verified documents , security check ? 
  it takes weeks/months to get a eu visa depending on where outside eu you are from , but these people are supposed to be let in because they want to ? 
  oh wait , germany does that ... 
  but that 's merkel and i 'm getting back to extreme leftism ... 
  #can ' t ban the orban, 
  been watching orban and fidesz for a long time now . 
  he 's one of the model european conservatives . 
  extremely based . 
  i agree , i do n't use liberal in the `` original '' sense anymore , just like one can hardly use feminist unironically or positively these days . 
  just point out the irony of the word root and practice . 
  [ herman van rompuy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herman_van_rompuy ) and [ catherine ashton ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catherine_ashton ), 
  ** anti ** ** f ** irst ** a ** mendment, 
  they 're deliberately conflating `` eu '' and `` europe '' . 
  le pen is , therefore , `` anti-european '' . 
  i 'd actually say the pro-eu people are , at this point , anti-european . 
  stalinism is the true democracy !, 
  [ 99.7 % voter turnout !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_union_legislative_election,_1946 ) / s, 
  alt-right can mean whatever we want it to mean . 
  why would n't we be able to change the meaning of `` alt-right '' ( the one the media are tainting it with ) ? 
  it actually sounds pretty good , an alternative to the regular right and left that no longer fulfills the needs and expectations of the people . 
  consider `` alternative for germany '' or the `` freedom parties '' ( austrian freedom party ) . 
  alt-right is a very expressive label . 
  be tolerant !, 
  do you think christians were civilized in [ 1438 ] ( http://timesprayer.com/en/hijri-date-in-saudi-arabia.html ) ? 
  give muslims some time to adjust !, 
  yeah , i 'm quite upset , too . 
  i considered vast majority of asians to be above this . 
  they probably are , but it 's still sad some are jumping on the microaggression train . 
  plot twist : the girls had a quarrel , the `` victim '' tried to abuse the insane microaggression reporting program as a revenge on the girl . 
  what a fascist , trying to make them shut up and deny them their 1a rights ... / s, 
   the thousand days ' war ( 1899 -- 1902 ) ... during 1899 the ruling conservatives were accused of maintaining power by fraudulent elections . 
  did n't know tsar nicholas ii had hackers !, 
  so he thinks the amount of available police scanners is equal to amount of crime going on at the time ? 
  wow , that 's pretty bigoted and billionophobic of them to just assume that every billionaire is a globalist . 
  you can do business on a global scale and be a patriot . 
  this is what they got when they did n't elect norbert hofer . 
  #and because of this , all speech must be assumed to be hate speech unless verified and approved as non-hate speech, 
  * western europe, 
  ironically , eastern europe was saved from liberalism , multiculturalism , mass islamic immigration and cultural marxism by having 40 years of economic marxism , communism and absolutely closed borders . 
  it 's like you spend 40 years in a closed room , bahind a fence , echo chamber , then walk out hoping to see light and a few years later you 're like `` wow , they 're all went insane over there '', 
  do n't know what the situation is in iberia and italy , i heard they 're based . 
  uk , france , benelux , not even talking about germany and sweden , not so much . 
  [ switzerland banned minarets ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/29/switzerland-bans-mosque-minarets ) , while their `` establishment '' was instantly afraid `` what the muslims might say to that '' , so i assume at least 50 % of people there are based . 
  yes . 
  in high school , in my english rhetorics class , we were asked whom we found to be a great , inspirational public speaker . 
  i do n't remember whom i said , but if trump were running back then ( it was 2014 ) , i would 've said trump . 
  based poland, 
  i posted this yesterday , new york times :, 
  there are many pranks like bait car , bait electrict bike etc. 
  why would that be actually illegal ? 
  would it count as a `` booby trap '' ? 
  just some i remember i saw :, 
  [ electric bait car ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icsucvhrewa ), 
  [ bait phone gives thief electric shock ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4irjg2ld3u ), 
  [ moped seat explodes under thief ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyb5kt1cm0w ), 
  [ bait bike connected to a rope ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hemdulbaiee ), 
  [ electric bike bait ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bn76tvjspy ), 
  i hope someone in the trump administration reads t_d because this is awesome . 
  but the left would be talking about `` aaah it 's hunger games !!! '', 
  if clinton were president , she would have declared nra a terrorist organization and been now speaking at a joint conference of antifa , blm and cair .
