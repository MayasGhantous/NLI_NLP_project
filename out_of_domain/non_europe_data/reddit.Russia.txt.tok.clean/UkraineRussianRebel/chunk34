  i sense subtle sexism in doubling the amount of deleted emails . 
  it 's because if she were a man , no one would criticize her for that . 
  ( we would ) you know , just like we do n't criticize schumer , mccain , ryan , soros , macron and others . 
  why is this all working out so nice , the world and reality bending to fit our completely fake unrealistic impossible paranoid conspiracy theories ? 
  no no , i do n't recognize that it could be not conspiracy theories , of course trumpists ca n't be right , we 're rigging and hacking reality to fit our theories , not vice versa . 
  he 's not russian but i can assert with high confidence that he is a north korean or kazakhstani hacker hired by the russians to conceal the russian trace . 
  our theory is bending towards kazakhstani , because kazakhstan uses cyrillic and we were unable to decipher whether \u041f\u0423\u0422\u0418\u041d \u0421\u0414\u0415\u041b\u0410\u041b \u042d\u0422\u041e \u0414\u041b\u042f \u0422\u0420\u0423\u041c\u041f\u0410 is written in kazakhstani or russian version of cyrillic . 
  our agents are still investigating to establish the fact with certainty . 
  marine le pen gets 17 % of the vote in 2012 , not getting into 2nd round, 
  marine le pen gets 22 % of the vote in 2017 but narrowly loses first round to macron , having a chance to win in the 2nd, 
  austrian freedom party ( front national-style right wing populist ) gets 15 % in 2010 presidential election,

  does that make the millions of american children adding milk to their cereal every morning neo-nazis ? 
  of course not . 
  nor do white sheets in the closet make one racist . 
  the meaning for all of these things -- ok hand symbol possibly included -- depend entirely on how they are employed . 
  no , no . 
  this guy is acting as if he gets it . 
  he 's actually making fun of the media for getting trolled . 
  but no . 
  he does n't get it . 
  he still thinks milk is a neo-nazi symbol . 
  the possibility for that is still open in his mind . 
  he got trolled by 4chan , even though he thinks that 's not the case .

  i am upset that muslims are portrayed as violent dangerous terrorists , so i will attack people with a knife for their offensiveness of thinking that muslims are violent dangerous terrorists .

  the entire establishment had no problem supporting him in an instant , but he 's still a `` populist '' and `` anti-establishment '' , as if they could fool anyone . 
  the atlantic :, 
   but what unites macron and le pen , who will face off in a second round on may 7 , is that they each represent a backlash against the political movements that have dominated modern france . 
  washington post :, 
   sunday 's election shows just how completely french voters have rejected the establishment . 
  marine le pen and emmanuel macron both represent outsider movements . 
  the guardian :, 
   the historic first-round result marked the rejection of the ruling political class -- it was the first time since the postwar period that the traditional left and right ruling parties were both ejected from the race in the first round .
