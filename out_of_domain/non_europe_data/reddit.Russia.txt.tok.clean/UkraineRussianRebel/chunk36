  before `` we need to learn to live with terrorism '', 
  wow , macron hates emerging countries , what a fascist developmentalophobe, 
  he does n't have any specifics . 
  he 's just rambling . 
  wow !, 
  i found [ an old speech ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l12csc_lw0q ) by macron !!!, 
  just as terrible as today . 
  he literally said france is nazi , of course usa is n't civil by his standards . 
  did putin just hack her ????!!!, 
  you had 30 years !!!, 
  30 years !!, 
  lol , he believes `` international media '' to give an accurate image ... now it makes sense . 
  they will have to learn arabic under you macron . 
  latin will be banned as heresy . 
  french failed so let 's try something else ? 
  lmao, 
  literally kim il sung, 
  ~ ~ orange is the new black ~ ~ macron is new bernie, 
  #le revival\u00c9, 
  he an unweaponized autist . 
  the thing is that in europe it 's not a very controversial thing to say , it 's a regular term . 
  the problem is that he is unwilling to say he would be deporting illegals , terrorists and so on , and keeps saying we need to tiptoe around muslims unless we want them to start a regular war on us -- that proves he 's a `` cuck '' ( as if we needed a proof though ), 
  vicious bite, 
  `` i grew up with a french language '', 
  you do n't say , what an achievement , you 're a patriot now !, 
  france24 = cnn, 
  factchecking on hillaryclinton.com : is pepe a hate symbol ? 
  - yes, 
  - that 's horrible !, 
  - yes it is, 
  - what can we do about it, 
  so , le ' t recap :, 
  `` france is guilty of nazi war crimes , you ca n't say france was not rounding up jews ms le pen , that 's a lie , we are nazis and we should be ashamed . 
  it 's not like france was occupied , no no , we 're literally nazis '', 
  `` i reject nationalism . 
  i grew up here , and i am scared of nationalism and patriotism , i do n't want any nationalism here '', 
  `` if you keep criticizing muslims , you will cause a civil war . 
  do n't criticize muslims or islam !, 
  opposing certain religions is dangerous ! '', 
  `` french people are radicilizing . 
  they 're mentally ill '' = it 's not islam , it 's mental illness , but all mentally ill people just happen to be muslims, 
  `` terrorism is like shoplifting '', 
  `` i will import more muslims and open the borders while deploying more police '' = i am willing to put law enforcement - not even talking about regular people - in danger because of `` muh tolerance '' . 
  i do n't understand that i can never deploy a police officer for every refugeee/muslim illegal , that there are literally tens of thousands of terrorists with fake passports , and i ca n't ever have enough police force to control for every of them , it 's impossible, 
  [ `` french culture ca n't collapse if france has no culture '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/k0kpgis.jpg ), 
  paraphrases . 
  1 is basically what he said , france was n't occupied by nazis , it * was nazis * . 
  2 is real - he literally said he `` rejects nationalism '' and finds it `` scary '' , 4 is real - he said terrorism and muslim radicalization is caused by `` mental illness '' , 6 is real , he said he wants open borders and will counter the danger with `` more law enforcement '',

  place de la republique, 
  want more ? 
  wrong . 
  le pen would 've never raised something like macron . 
  i thought this was photoshopped but i looked at the channel and wtf . 
  this is a [ much more accurate ] ( http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/files/2011/01/paris-street-prayers.jpg ) representation of france . 
  based witchcraft, 
  macron : [ french culture ca n't be destroyed if france has no culture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/k0kpgis.jpg ), 
  petit macaroni the teacher 's pet !,

  has anyone opened the scan of his degree in photoshop yet ? 
  you know , to check if the layers match and stuff ... 
  why does anyone think it really is [ ok ] ( https://previews.123rf.com/images/sergofoto/sergofoto1305/sergofoto130500065/19874708-human-hand-gesture-is-all-right-everything-is-ok-isolated-stock-photo.jpg ) to physically attack or threaten to kill people you simply disagree with and demonise them , all while claiming * they 're * the violent and hateful ones ? 
  do n't criticize muslims or be ready for terrorism !, 
  we have to stop the potential future conservative violence with actual violence and hatred . 
  i mean , if you kill them all , they ca n't get violent in the future , right ? 
  it 's their logic . 
  obama : you ca n't say that , because * you 'd be in jail *, 
  messfeed, 
  * orange, 
  as they would say, 
  they hate orange people . 
  it 's literally bigotry . 
  those misandric christophobes !, 
   feminist authors christina hoff sommers and naomi wolf write that women 's sexual liberation led women to a role reversal , *** whereby they viewed men as sex objects *** , [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] in a manner similar to what they criticize about men 's treatment of women . 
   instances where men may be viewed as sex objects by women include advertisements , music videos , films , television shows , beefcake calendars , women 's magazines , male strip shows , and clothed female/nude male ( cfnm ) events, 
  is this another 4chan project , after milk and project o-kkk ? 
  hey , / pol / should stop , i do n't want antifa to stalk me and attack me for working out lol, 
  but if i get fat i will get weight and volume privilege, 
  includes tumble after every squat, 
   seen as `` too christian '' in the south, 
  sounds like an ad to me . 
  i am torn between `` scientists are saying that gmo is just making the crops more resistant to diseases and resilient , no different than other fertilizers '' and `` gmo is a ton of hormones that are pumped into crops to foster their growth , have proven negative long term consequences on helath of those who consume them , cause diseases in humans and animals , and it 's just a massive monsanto conspiracy lobby '', 
  would they bother to find anonymous people from reddit , though ? 
  and also - just a technical question - could it be considered a `` threat '' if what they said is that they 'd `` support '' assasination , assuming that someone else would do it and they 'd approve of it , rather than implying they 'd assassinate someone ? 
  when dealing with a `` class enemy '' , their age , gender , or relations do n't play any role . 
  how many people were killed by their relatives in spanish , russian and other civil wars for joining the republicans instead of the falangists , or the white army instead of bolsheviks etc. 
  it 's the same cultist thinking , treating people on their relation to you is something those reactionary conservatives are doing anyway : it 's the value of family , tribe , nation , heritage when in reality there 's only enemies and not-enemies for them . 
  them being related to you does n't make them any less of an `` enemy '' . 
  history ? 
  you mean `` herstory '' , right ?!!!, 
  europe is diverse, 
  it is arguably one of the most ethnically diverse and culturally vibrant areas in the world . 
  161 % lmao, 
  it 's funny that i 've heard the name but do n't think ever saw her picture or listened to any songs lol, 
  i mean , [ this happened in spain once ] ( https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-hcsntay1uovzb5czhxpqco9tpprdagr7tcrxzsd2touq1hwoltjta8zuep6fc10gpv1yfjct3azzfxpuh24te4garl9qvrtuys3r3gcf0otfdqdqa ) , so maybe even if macron wins they still have a chance , spain still exists today . 
  in his defense , he did not really vandalize anything and writing stuff in dust on cars is n't really all that uncommon . 
  but i agree that to a possibly paranoid leftie who believes in scary alt-right trump supporters out to get him , this might actually be terrifying and cause a long-lasting psychological trauma , kind of like seeing [ this ] ( http://www.ceji.org/sites/default/files/68edff1e-d0c9-11e5-bd7b-806ea8f395ab_original_0.jpg ) on his car :p, 
  if le pen wins , there will be a shortage of kebab, 
  if macron wins , there will be a shortage of croissant, 
  if melenchon won , there would 've been a shortage of everything,
