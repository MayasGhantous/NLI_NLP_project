  \\* blame the driving instructor , he clearly failed at his job . 
  he should go to jail for giving such a bad student who ca n't keep his car on the road a certificate . 
  definitely the muslim bribed him , so that should be investigated , too . 
  this is france under macaroni . 
  you can recover from a few years of crisis as the eu will be trying to sink the newly independent france to try to keep others in through fear . 
  they wo n't recover from millions of muslims and replacement of their native population with immigrants , because there will be nothing to recover , they will be forced to live as an actually oppressed minority in their own former country . 
  why would anyone think that could n't happen ? 
  [ this ] ( http://islamiccoins.ancients.info/umayyads/umayyads.jpg ) happened a few decades after islam was established , but they only managed to occupy spain , france defeated them in 732 ( which led to a change of dynasty and the carolingians came to power , thus creating a strong , stable impearial dynasty which protected europe for quite a long time after that ) , now they 're letting them inside of those countries . 
  remember the thing from armageddon movie , when they were talking about exploding the meteor ? 
  if your hand gets hit with a firework , you will be just burnt . 
  if you wrap your hand around the firework , you will have no hand . 
  it 's the same thing . 
   misinformation campaign, 
  implying voice of america , radio liberty and radio free europe/asia do not operate in other countries . 
  ( russia included . ), 
  or that al-jazeera has `` no agenda '' . 
  the defense against misinformation is not to read media you believe are misinforming -- that 's the accusation against rt and other `` russian propaganda sources '' . 
  breitbart was also accused of spreading `` russian misinformation '' , as was virtually every conservative/non-liberal website or news source . 
  one of the lists , i believe , included the nation and daily kos , and you almost ca n't go further left and anti-trump than that . 
  one can hardly prevent people from accessing information that may be untrue , or just non-conforming to the accepted opinions so they do n't get influenced and vote for the `` correct candidate '' . 
  somehow they believe `` you 're all stupid uneducated rednecks and trump is an incompetent idiot and you all suck '' is an opinion , not a string of insults . 
  because this is the `` opinions '' they get banned for here . 
  as far as i saw it , almost no one gets banned for disagreeing , even if they openly proclaim being a liberal , leftwinger , bernie/hillary voter etc. 
  if you dig a hole for pepe ...

  his looks ? 
  lol , looks like a tan spanish guy to me , not even a `` traditional '' muslim looks , anything . 
  he should look more muslim to pander to sjws :p, 
  * especially * in a muslim only world . 
  #your ideas are twice your age, 
  tfw liberals are `` warning '' netanyahu about being `` naive about trump '' because `` trump is an anti-semite '' yeah , you random twitter person surely have a better judgment and experience in politics and in general than israeli prime minister . 
  lel , when i started reading the title i thought it would be an example of classic antifa logic .

  we have the best oil , folks !, 
  no one has better oil than us . 
  believe me !, 
  sounded like navy seals 2.0, 
  anyway , i am surprised the username is blurred . 
  he is threatening doxxing and physical assault , yet still is `` protected '' by having his username blurred . 
  there is no kek but top kek and trump is the prophet of kek . 
  he paid the jizya . 
  no need for separation , he 'd submitted to the caliphate . 
  honestly , i think the french want to learn arabic instead of english because me and my wife take very good care of our pooch but if it means we can keep our muslim neighbors happy then i would be the first to ship them off . 
  in the future they will be the majority and if you did n't act or behave a certain way then its off with you . 
  so it will be a civil war against muslims in europe + war of muslims in europe against the usa ? 
  yes, 
   the goal of the euro-mediterranean cooperation is to create a new greater european union encompassing both europe and north africa , with the mediterranean sea becoming a domestic eurabian sea . 
  the goal is to establish a `` comprehensive political partnership , '' including a `` free trade area and economic integration '' ; `` considerably more money for the partners '' ( that is , more european money flowing into north africa ) ; and `` cultural partnership '' -- that is , importation of islamic culture into post-christian europe . 
   according to the sioe , in the euro-med plan `` europe is to be islamized . 
  democracy , christianity , european culture and europeans are to be driven out of europe . 
  fifty million north africans from muslim countries are to be imported into the eu . '', 
   skeptical ? 
  it 's already happening . 
  the british newspaper the daily express reported in october 2008 on `` a controversial taxpayer-funded ` job centre ' '' that opened in mali at that time as `` just the first step towards promoting ` free movement of people in africa and the eu . ' brussels economists claim britain and other eu states will ` need ' 56 million immigrant workers between them by 2050 to make up for the ` demographic decline ', 
  he even went deliberately cucky , alibistic and non-offensive to say christianity is a problem ( very offensive to christians ) but islam is a * bigger * problem , implying that christianity is a problem , but still got banned . 
  wow . 
  is france training for having muslim government already ? 
  father , son and mary ? 
  weird , never heard of this , but a bunch korean girls from an obscure church tried to convert me to this version of christianity a few weeks ago . 
  thought it was some new interpretation they made up , but apparently it 's really old but not practiced today . 
  had no idea it was coptic . 
  he wanted a political ideology with bits of divinity and make people afraid of leaving . 
  he was successful in this respect . 
  i used to be `` sad '' about what 's going on there . 
  now , after learning a lot and researching , i realized that it 's pointless . 
  they 're attacking each other , and this was going on , and will go on , in perpetuity . 
  if we bring them here , they will just continue their wars on european soil , adding us as another part to the conflict . 
  likely uniting against us as the `` crusaders '' for a while , then just continuing their own wars over minor differences in islam . 
  right , f * ck them all . 
  it 's their war . 
  we 've worked long and hard for our continents and countries to become peaceful and stable . 
   so before i was nine i had learned the basic canon of arab life . 
   it was me against my brother ;, 
   me and my brother against our father ;, 
   my family against my cousins and the clan ;, 
   the clan against the tribe ; and the tribe against the world . 
   and all of us against the infidel . 
  leon uris , `` the haj '', 
  wait wait , i thought we were the uneducated low-information redneck bigots , now we are the elitist ones ? 
  he was sex positive regardless of age . 
  are you implying he is the snek ? 
  i agree . 
  muslims , whatever they may be , have never compromised on fundamental values like family and their own tradition like the west did on its own values and traditions . 
  one of the reasons why they are `` winning '' against us currently . 
  and before we 're beheaded , we can look at them and smugly say : * i told you so *, 
   maybe we should have anarchy for a year just to remind these kids what they actually are . 
  ~ ~ hunger ~ ~ anarchy games . 
  with the rest of us watching them on live stream and sending gifts to our favored teams .
