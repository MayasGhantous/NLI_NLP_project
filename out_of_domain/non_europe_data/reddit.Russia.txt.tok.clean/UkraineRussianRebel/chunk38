  macron said he admired merkel 's immigration policy and believes all those illiterates will prove beneficial for french economy . 
  good bye ... but at least france will stay in the eu and have a common currency , that makes up for having your country literally conquered and destroyed . 
  732 battle of tours . 
  all have fallen for vain . 
  in the relatively most peaceful time in history , when they could have saved their country by nothing but putting a paper into a box , they chose not to . 
  no , i believe it is real . 
  i live in europe and know people who are afraid their country will be islamized in a decade but are still scared of the `` far-right fascist radicals like afd '' , and people who after a terror attack get mad at those who criticize muslims , wearing a `` refugees welcome '' pin after november 2015 - as offensive as wearing a swastika pin at audchwitz if you ask me . 
  i am having a fucking breakdown . 
  why the fuck is she losing , i wanted madame le pen to be president and save her cucked country , i wanted to see louvre and mona lisa but now it will be destroyed by islamists like monuments in palmyra !, 
  this is so fucked , i thought she was polling well in nice ... 
  *** on a serious note , i absolutely agree with you . 
  this is the real reason i am mad and sad . 
  i do n't want terror and islamism in europe -- not just because a favorite candidate lost the election ***, 
  looks like they 'll have to go without electricity for a while , look up their energy production stats :p but seriously , they have muslims working at nuclear power plants in france and belgium , and germany is now reviewing `` radicalization in their army '' -- it 's the trojan horse and roman empire using teutonic mercenaries in their army and giving them citizen rights all over again . 
   if it makes women ( ... ) look bad, 
  honestly , i do n't see much content that would make `` women '' as a whole demographic look bad anyway . 
  who even thinks in such ways ? 
  seriously , it seems like this whole misogyny thing people are perpetually being accused of does n't even exist . 
  point to a man who genuinely `` hates '' women , no , show me a man who at least * dislikes * women . 
  ironically , we , the conservatives , patriots etc. 
  are * the * most pro-women people out there , and our women are the most `` pro-themselves '' people , just we have n't adopted any labels to show how much we 're `` pro-women '' , we 're showing that by deeds , like opposing importation of real rape cultures into our countries . 
  but they have the feminist label , so anything they do is not `` misogynistic '' by definition even if it 's literally telling women they should n't report rape if it makes illegals look bad . 
  age is just a number , and you can assign any number you want to yourself . 
  he 's fucking unborn yet you ageist, 
  liberals supporting abortions are islamophobic , want less muslim babies, 
  what was she trying to do there ? 
  trying to get them to be quiet ? 
  disgusting assault . 
  he said to those who voted le pen . 
  hardly `` destruction '' . 
  but 1 % still  3 000 000 :(, 
  that kind of relative/absolute number thing is what liberals frequently do . 
  `` but only 15 % of muslims are radicals '', 
  and they say you ca n't make real-world 1:1 scale experiments in social science !, 
  not, 
  real, 
  socialism, 
  how can socialism be real if socialism is not real ? 
   ~ ~ conventionally ~ ~ bombing civilian targets, 
  intentionally , because it 's fun , because it shows power and sows fear . 
  that 's how muslims do it . 
  and i 'd say it 'd be close to 0 % . 
  i agree 100 % . 
  #i would n't go to france, 
  isis may sadly do to louvre what they did to monuments in palmyra and ancient cities of iraq . 
  evacuate art now !,

  just kidding , it does n't work like it does n't in egypt , the men will just get used to it .

  she did actually say that the front national will be a force of resistance to macron . 
  nothing wrong with that , she did not instruct her supporters to wear pussyhats and yell . 
  it 's all civil .

   relief , relief , relief !, 
  there was a *** fear that the french would choose nationalism . 
  *** it 's been a difficult moment - the country is so divided . 
  the atmosphere of the election - *** while not exactly civil war *** - was of a deep clash of ideas , '' 20-year-old student alice whitehead said as she partied at the louvre . 
  so delusional . 
  they believe that the next civil war will be left vs. right , and they just avoided it by voting for macron . 
  wrong . 
  it will be what is left of western europe and islam . 
  people are scared of the supposed `` fascism '' of le pen and the patriotic right more than they 're about actual terrorists and people promising to take over their nations . 
  macron is literally merkel, 
  i 'm not kidding , he says he wants to shorten the admission time for refugees and take in more of them . 
  i 'd rather go to spain or portugal . 
  no muslims there and spain is currently led by conservatives from a formerly francoist party . 
  one can be fairly certain that those people will not tolerate any islamic terrorism or mass migration . 
  more jew-conspiracy than outright `` jew hate '' . 
  jew hate really is a thing on the left , and it really is associated with the palestine .

  electric fence . 
  sadly austria is not very based , such a great place . 
  but the fpo ratings are still growing and hofer was * almost * president ( better result than le pen 's 35 % ) , so they may have a chance . 
  also their immigration is not so high , muslims around 1 % and most of them turks , ~ 100,000 , so not the worst stats in europe certainly . 
  quite a few states have age of consent at 16 and 17 in the us , ironically hyper-liberal california has it at 18 while a bunch of conservative states at 16 . 
  but 16-17 is regular in europe ... 
  but germany , austria , italy , portugal , bosnia and albania have it at 14 ... crazy . 
  russia , ukraine , belarus , the uk , norway and finland have 16 . 
  it 's 18 in thailand .
