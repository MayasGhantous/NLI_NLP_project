   ash khare came to america from india with two bachelor 's degrees , $ 8 in his pocket and a dream -- the american dream .

  anjem choudary , three years ago :, 
   anjem choudary was secretly filmed mocking non-muslims for working in 9-5 jobs their whole lives , and told followers that some revered islamic figures had only ever worked one or two days a year . 
   `` the rest of the year they were busy with jihad [ holy war ] and things like that , '' he said . 
  `` people will say , ` ah , but you are not working ' . 
   `` but the normal situation is for you to take money from the kuffar [ non-believers ] . 
  `` so we take jihad seeker 's allowance . 
  you need to get support . '', 
   he went on to tell a 30-strong crowd : `` we are going to take england -- the muslims are coming . '',

  why do you assume that a bad driver who plows through a christmas market and happens to be a muslim while yelling ` allahu akbar ' must necessarily be a terrorist ? 
  would n't you also scream something like ` oh my god ' if you lost control over the vehicle , rammed it into a market full of people and your polish driving instructor shot himself ?

  wtf, 
  i do n't really think most people would see that as offensive , but in this case it 's coming from people who complain about `` objectification '' all the time , so it 's just weird to hear it from someone who apparently subscribes to those ideas . 
  restricting muslims immigration `` threatens the *** sovereignty *** '' of islam . 
  really , what is that even supposed to mean ? 
  i am not sure she understands what the word sovereignty means . 
  honestly , i did n't even make that connection . 
  i thought ` vanilla ' was just the generic `` cute '' smell . 
  did n't make any connection to ethnicity at all .

  the art of the deal cover is gradually becoming a new copy-pasta . 
  there was a cover by obama , too . 
  ( when referring to obama i , of course , mean the best obama , the malik obama ), 
  i am not american and have no idea why obamacare is a bad thing , but if the americans who voted for trump like it getting repealed , and the donald likes it getting repealed , then i am , too , happy it 's getting repealed !,

  also he supposedly once referred to an african american lawyer as `` boy . '', 
  that 's , as far as i know , is all they have , none of which is really that `` offensive . '', 
  does n't mean the `` religious stuff '' needs to stop , though . 
  the_donald respects the right to freedom of religion or not following any religion . 
  ( i am not extremely religious , fyi ), 
  this . 
  t_d follows the classical religious freedom : you have the right to follow religion and have the right to not follow any . 
  saying `` get that religious stuff off here '' is akin to college progressives ' `` get that milo out of here '', 
   they would disrupt him even though he did n't disagree with them . 
  hahaha, 
  ben `` uncle tom '' carson . 
  read today 's op-ed in ny times . 
  he does n't like how muslims treat other cultures and religions . 
  he 's discriminating against their right to throw people from buildings . 
  he 's bigoted against stoning and lashing women , which is an important part of their culture . 
  also , he 's jewish , and probably does n't support palestine . 
  not supporting a `` state '' that terrorizes you is prejudiced . 
  it 's funny but some russians refer to anyone with african ancestry as `` african-american . '', 
  through the influence of american culture , it just seems the `` correct term to use '' , so many people just do n't think about what it actually means . 
  read that in a journalist report on paris : `` there are areas with plenty of african-americans . '', 
  til african american is apparently offensive ... sounds much better than `` black '' american though . 
  no one calls asian americans `` yellow '' !,

  i 'd call it progressive , even .
