  `` the mind of the cuck will find a way to lose even in a sum-sum situation '', 
  oh , i was there when the comment was posted !, 
  not such a long time ago but now that it has a post of its own , i feel like a part of history . 
  but if everyone can improve themselves how do you shame people for being unfairly privileged ? 
  cnn reports that trump meeting with lavrov and kislyak ( russian ambassador to the us ) was very inappropriate , but especially kislyak given that he stands `` at the center of russia scandal and controversy '' because he was meeting with sessions when the latter was senator . 
  i may have a conflict of interest as a russian in saying this but i do n't think kislyak or sessions are at fault , they met before the democrats invented the whole sudden '' [ russia deciding us elections and making us lose ] ( https://i.redd.it/p99s1sk8uwwy.jpg ) '' thing , when senators and other officials meeting with ambassadors was not controversial or conspirational at all , just a norm like everywhere . 
  twitter reply system is confusing and annoying . 
  it 's enough for a few people to spam actively and you wo n't see any other responses . 
  and it 's always the same people on top of every trump tweet , almost like they 're stalking him or just waiting for any time he tweets . 
  [ not in a braggadocious way ] ( https://www.merriam-webster.com/news-trend-watch/trump-i-wrote-the-art-of-the-deal-i-say-not-in-a-braggadocious-way-20160926 ), 
  there is this guy on a lawn and some car . 
  also asians . 
  is there any truth to the [ `` white house officials outraged that russia published the photos from the meetings '' ] ( http://www.mediaite.com/online/they-tricked-us-president-trump-reportedly-unhappy-about-lavrov-meeting-photos/ ) ? 
  this is what some us media say , while the kremlin representatives and the russian foreign ministry says that it 's a nonsense , the photos were never intended to be secret and that 's why there were photographers , that it 's `` fake news '' . 
  i do n't know . 
  [ kekistan is in somalia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvjiszumnwg ), 
  they 're acting as if `` build that wall '' were `` arbeit macht frei '' . 
  so trump is wrong again . 
  it means only 1 500 000 , not 3 000 000 million illegals voted if every one had 2 votes each . 
  checkmate drumpf !, 
  hillary deleted 33 000 , not 39 000 e-mails . 
  checkmate ^ 2 drumpf !, 
  70 years, 
  7 months, 
  7 days, 
  trump was born 700 days before israel, 
  this means , 777 days after his birth was july 30 , 1948 , 77 days after israel became a nation . 
  70 years , 7 months , 7 weeks and 7 days from trump 's birth is march 11 , 2017 . 
  this is 119 days from putin 's 777 month of life on 7/7/17 . 
  putin turns 777 months on 7/7/17 which is year 5777 on the hebrew calendar .

  * get off my lawn *, 
  too old to fly a helicopter :(, 
  they would call him a self-hating nazi if they found out he voted trump . 
  i went till the last one :( supposedly it 's `` scary '' that some people think that the `` russia accusations are fabricated '' . 
  it 's an elaborate plan, 
  first there needs to be a wwiii so all evidence of collusion is destroyed, 
  then we can easily use trump as a russian plant puppet president in the desertified world, 
  no one will know because very few people will be alive, 
  there will be literally no one to investigate, 
  300 people will be in the world, 
  we will start new united states, 
  funded entirely by the 150 people who stayed alive in russia, 
  with trump as the first president, 
  the new capital city will be `` trump , d.c. '', 
  win win comrade, 
   let 's not forget putin 's master stroke , upgrading america 's nuclear arsenal !, 
   putin today appeared to reject the notion of a potential arms race with the united states , saying that `` in the course of his election campaign trump spoke about the necessity of strengthening the u.s. nuclear arsenal , and strengthening the armed forces . 
  there 's nothing unusual here . '', 
  you know why he 's so relaxed about it ? 
  because he already has the launch codes !!!, 
  trump gave them to putin !!!, 
  hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha , that must be it !, 
  they are saying `` republicans are not people '' so you did n't say anything offensive at all , just reciprocation . 
  russian pin ? 
  wtf is wrong with these people . 
  i 'm literally offended !, 
  lol , i 'm not sure if / s or i 'm actually offended, 
  perfect analogy .

  it 's only 15 % of kekists and none of the kekistani refugees are radical !, 
  they will integrate and stop believing in the fundamental tenets of kekism if we give them enough integration courses ( like if they watch cnn for an hour every day ) , you 'll see .

   all religions, 
  but islam is the only real and true religion with the true god / s, 
   flee to prosperous secular capitalist country, 
   that was n't true islam/communism guyz , let 's try it again it will totally work this time, 
  also :, 
   `` marxism is a religion . 
  to an orthodox marxist , an opponent is not merely in error but in sin '' . 
  communism can only work in a developed capitalist country because you first need to be `` ready '' . 
  marx and lenin believed that the world is developing in stages and you ca n't skip any -- so it obviously would n't work in russia , which was only starting to be free market capitalist in 1917 , but it would work greatly in britain or the usa . 
  trotsky was really upset the revolution happened in russia and was trying to bring it to the west , but stalin decided for the `` socialism in one country '' path as opposed to trotskyist internationalism . 
  soooo ... it does n't work in venezuela , or cambodia , or maoist china , or north korea , or romania , but in a developed country like the us it totally will , let us try guys !!, 
  real indian  fake indian, 
   shares a skin color, 
  no one shares a skin color with anyone , everyone 's skin color is a * tiiiiny * bit different shade , so you 'd better provide a rgb color shade classification of the precise people who owned slaves before just lumping people together like that !,
