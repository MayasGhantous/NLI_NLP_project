  allusion to, 
  and also full autism spectrum , from highly functioning to absolutely weaponized !, 
  no offense but wtf is wrong with this ? 
  it 's france . 
  this is what french people look like . 
  does it need more muslims and `` diversity '' according to you ? 
  based e-mail merchant, 
  i was about to say `` california '' , looked up at the photo again and realized she 's not on a beach with a white sand against a dark blue sky o_o, 
  it is already misogynistic according to feminists . 
  what are women , incubators ???!!, 
  they would n't have jobs if universities only had to teach things that are reality-based ... most of the `` new '' social fields would fall off , like `` gender studies '' , most of the things with the adjective `` critical '' as well ; sociology , real philosophy , history etc. 
  would stay as the real humanities . 
  it is kind of funny but when you realize this is considered `` higher level '' education , yeah , it 's really sad . 
  is inglewood some kind of a horrible violent ghetto ? 
  just asking , i heard about compton and inglewood being mentioned as the worst neighborhoods in la but on the photo it does n't look really bad . 
  tucker needs to start his own channel . 
  tuck news or something . 
   there is no compromise to be had with the liberals . 
  any time that anyone attempts to reach a compromise with the liberals , they win and we lose . 
  because :, 
   the religious quality of marxism also explains a characteristic attitude of the orthodox marxist toward opponents . 
  to him , as to any believer in a faith , the opponent is not merely in error but in sin . 
  dissent is unapproved of not only intellectually but also morally . 
   curly hair , receding hairline or a large nose count as `` diverse '' ? 
  sounds like a stereotypical jewish person ? 
  if so , macron gets -1 diversity point and +1 oppressiveness point for letting a fascist settlement-building peaceful palestinians oppressor on his staff . 
  tbh it does n't change my opinion of him but it would 've been very disturbing if he had a staff full of muslims instead of french people . 
  i hope she would 've been a based maga-hat wearing grandma had she been alive ... just to spite this guy . 
  such sick people ... 
  possibly it 's random picture found on the internet ? 
  i mean idk of course but it really is weird lol, 
  russia is no longer soviet or communist but mostly socially conservative nation so it does n't have to be contradictory . 
  if the ussr had stayed in its form i assume they would 've been taking the accusations of `` election hacking '' as an attempt to `` liberate '' the us from the `` oppressive capitalism '' and `` right-wing fascism '' and cheering . 
  i hate the fact i am russian but americans ( indonesians ? ), 
  get paid for shilling by russian billionaires and i get nothing . 
  * russia first !, 
  hire russian , shill russian *, 
  nooo ... it 's the republican patriarchal males that told women to vote for trump , do n't you know that only democrat women are the ones who think independently and do n't need no man , why would any sane woman not vote for hillary the great ? 
  it 's hard to live when you believe you 're systematically oppressed with everything and the system is rigged against you . 
  if you are a woman or an african american and you fail at something ( according to feminists and blmists ) , it 's patriarchy/systemic slavery oppression , if you 're not , only * then * the idea of your personal fault comes to be plausible . 
  after all , you have a privilege , and it still did n't help you , so you 're a complete loser . 
  honestly , how do they even think about their lives ? 
   i failed , it 's because of oppression . 
  no , no , i was n't really oppressed , as in someone physically interfered with me , or i was prevented by unjust law , it 's that i *** think *** the society is rigged against me that causes me to fail and underachieve , and the fact that i *** think *** so is * your * fault . 
  you are responsible for how i feel . 
  look at all these sjw people saying they 're traumatized by greek philosophy like plato because it 's `` history by the winners '' . 
  how pathetic does one have to be to be traumatized by 2000 + years old greek guy who did n't have an idea about existence of africa and africans , let alone could `` oppress '' them . 
  all those people opposing western civilization classes in colleges . 
  if you believe that everything is rigged and everything is privilege you do n't have , then any argument against will be seen as an attempt to `` preserve '' that privilege anyway . 
  it 's self-reinforcing loathing . 
  sportspersonship / sportspeopleship, 
  and you 're not even a contrarian, 
  is that an israeli oppressor before massacring innocent palestinian children , as the media would have you believe ? 
  greeks had slaves . 
  athens need to go . 
  also , pueblos . 
  native americans had slaves . 
  african slaves . 
  great wall of china . 
  did you know chinese were buying african slaves from arabs in 13th century ? 
  mecca needs to go . 
  arabs did slave trade , a lot of it . 
  what stays ? 
  the great zimbabwe . 
  just kidding . 
  africans had slaves . 
  they were the ones selling them to the british . 
  or ~ ~ argentina ~ ~ chile ( but argentina too ) . 
  remember , pinochet was just a good guy offering free helicopter rides to communists but people hate on him . 
  if he were with us today , he would 've offered the same to muslims , he 's not an islamophobe after all . 
  i remember egypt being a fine tourist country . 
  but then the islamic revolution happened . 
  if egypt had never gone islamic , they would 've abolished slavery long time ago and possibly would 've been an advanced society . 
  provided they would n't have collapsed in some way . 
  you 're right lol , confused countries . 
  egyptian medicaid lmao, 
  it 's obvious sarcasm . 
  ( i hope ), 
  fine then , i 'll give it [ to myself myself ] ( http://www.govmint.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/1800x/040ec09b1e35df139433887a97daa66f/3/0/301870_2_1.jpg ), 
  undocumented bank account owner . 
  you really do own it , you just do n't have the documents to prove it . 
  also : are illegal immigrants really undocumented if it is known ( documented ) how many there are ? 
   do n't criticize our masks , we need them to protect our families . 
  protect our identities from the alt-right intelligence agency known as / pol / . 
  osu , never forget, 
   i do n't want muslims to be stereotyped as terrorists, 
  * proceeds to stab random people with a knife in an act of terrorism *, 
  `` if there is no evidence of russian election hacking , it means russians are really good at hiding it . '', 
  we can say whatever we want , centipedes, 
  but we will convince no one , because everyone knows this has, 
  #to do, 
  why specifically latinos ? 
  are they more likely to become victims of terror attacks ? 
  just asking , but as far as i know those happen much more frequently in europe , middle east , israel etc. , but almost not at all in south america and so far not on a large scale in the usa to target specifically latinos .
