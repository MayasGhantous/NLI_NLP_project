  are you implying sjws are filthy ? 
   laughing to the point of being unable to breathe . 
  this is how they get you, 
  we need to apply kekiyya on all those who persecute us for our faith . 
  wiped , like , with a cloth . 
  somehow i believed most americans saw a lack of accessible/affordable healthcare for many people as a bad thing but most thought that `` market-based healthcare '' is the best solution , you actually think that people not being able to get treatment and it should just be a `` natural selection '' in a civilized country like the us is a good thing ? 
  no offense , just a serious question . 
  everyone has a right to a * free * uptrump on t_d , it 's the only socialism we have on here . 
  the biggest, 
  the idea is ( from nyt ) that he `` shared intelligence from a middle eastern ally , who will now be reluctant to share it again with the us '', 
  all in really vague terms , which leads me to believe , as mcmaster confirmed , that nothing really happened . 
  i am a trump supporter and the russia investigation is an attempt to delegitimize the president . 
  it is immediately obvious that while there are democratic elections , if the `` wrong person wins '' , they will try to remove him from office . 
  it is nonsensical to assume that trump was running for president `` for russians '' . 
  which country ? 
  russia is n't really europe but everything is 24/7 here . 
  in most of countries in central europe ( where i live currently ) most of restaurants and shops are open till 10-11 pm . 
  what the fuck did you say about me you little navy seal bitch ? 
  i 'll have you know i graduated top of my class in the journalism school , and i 've been involved in numerous smear campaigns against trump , and i have over 300 confirmed fake news articles . 
  i am trained in character assassination and i 'm the top reporter in the entire cnn . 
  you are nothing to me but just another russian shill . 
  think again , fucker . 
  as we speak i am contacting my secret network of anonymous officials across the usa and your administration is being traced right now so you better prepare for the false accusations , drumpfkin . 
  you 're fucking impeached , kid . 
  i can be anywhere , anytime , and i can find your bogus russian connections and people who will accuse you of sexual attack and then disappear minutes before election in over seven hundred ways . 
  not only am i extensively trained in information combat , but i have access to the entire classified information archives of the united states congress . 
  i actually like tiny trumps and [ the word of kek ] ( http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/251/146/d40.jpg ) . 
  they have convinced themselves that we have a nk-style cult of trump and therefore anything they would say to make fun of trump is borderline `` blasphemous to us '' . 
   if i make them tiny , would they hurt your feelings, 
  no , i can assure you there 's no problem there . 
  make them tiny if you want lol, 
  so they think cuck is just a regular insult without implications and real meaning behind it , like calling someone a `` moron '' ? 
  it 's not really an insult , it 's a reference to a particular state of mind which most of us do n't have , so it 's not really insulting . 
  their reasoning :, 
   `` trump supporters are so dangerous , they want to put people in concentration camps , assassinate and physically attack people for their opinions , and are generally super violent , hateful and intolerant -- quick , put them in concentration camps and exterminate , or at least beat them up , assault , threaten , look up their home addresses and spray threats on their garden fences , do n't let the dangerous fascists win , we need to physically remove all trump supporters ! '', 
   all the ones with any hope left have already defected to the `` i 'm neutral ( ... ) or the `` trump '' camps . 
  the_donald trump subbreddit reveals information about apparent existence of concentration camps for trump opponents on the us territory -- cnn, 
  thought it was blood on the wall at first where the ripped american flag is . 
  #he was trying to save hillary 's e-mails and warn dnc against russian hacking , the fsb , putin and the russian embassy did it !, 
  i 'm not kidding - some people actually believe that :, 
   a longtime gop operative is asking congress to investigate whether or not russia is behind the murder of a young democratic national committee staffer . 
   now , gop lobbyist and dc lawyer jack burkman has formally appealed to congress to investigate following new evidence he says he 's obtained that russia may be behind rich 's murder . 
   ` now i think we have our first big news in the case -- we have leads and evidence of russian involvement . ', 
  i was reading from the very beginning but putin never implied he 'd stop paying me for posting on here / s, 
  the funniest , most ironic and cynical thing ever would be if wapo tasked podesta with covering the seth rich investigation . 
  not a shill , just nytimes / the guardian marketing department in a desperate attempt to stop their failing publications from losing more readers !, 
  lol, 
  proud vikings !, 
  damn , when you think about that vikings actually founded russia when they conquered the slavic tribes living there ( our first [ ruling dynasty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rurik_dynasty ) were swedish vikings ) , conquered most of northern europe and even got to america in 10th century ( but did n't stay ) and what they 're now doing to their original countries : / sweden is called the `` ground zero of political correctness '' . 
  hrc is secretly reading the_donald and getting redpilled on herself . 
  `` damn , what a b * tch that hillary is ... oh wait , they 're talking about me '', 
  is fox news better ? 
  wow instant -3 votes for fox news , who would think t_d hates fox news this much :p, 
  hi , i want a downvote , can i get a downvote please ? 
  [ get them now ] ( http://img.ifcdn.com/images/a2ee3024869a413d44e29bca15ef1fccb2a0ca3174c084dec3362d2231d5c63f_1.jpg ), 
  edit : the shilling is over ? 
  #love of a goat, 
  like by other chinese ( i know tibetians had slavery until basically 1950s ) or by someone else ? 
  because if the latter that 's a new info for me . 
  can i consider myself safe-spaced when i do n't really want to read twitter responses to trump 's tweets as i know it 's going to be the same verified people being outraged all the time ? 
  not democrats with small d. democrats with big d. democrats the party , not people who support democracy :p sorry for `` nitpicking '' haha, 
  that guy really hates germans lmao, 
  all the money the eu will potentially deny to poland will be the money it will save on not having to pay for the `` refugees '' , their housing , food , '' '' `` integration '' '' '' into society etc. 
  + no terror and mass rapes , no permanent demographic change , so it is definitely a winning situation . 
  i demand, 
  #reparayshuns for poland now, 
  do n't share classified info with ~ ~ the russians ~ ~ normies, 
  thank you for your sacrifices . 
  \\ + no rapefugees and terrorists, 
  100 rub , or $ 1.74123 , was deposited to your account , fellow caterpillar . 
  have a glorious day .

  the accusation is that trump campaign people were meeting `` with representatives of foreign governments '' , specifically russia , while campaigning or * before * , like when sessions met with the russian ambassador being a senator . 
  but what about hillary clinton `` colluding with foreign governments '' and `` meeting their representatives '' while being a candidate ? 
  you know , the truth is , we were `` hacking for trump '' , while ukraine was `` hacking for clinton '' , we [ just had better hackers ] ( http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/petro-poroshenko-zustrivsya-z-gillari-klinton-38211 ) , apparently , if you follow the logic that meeting someone from a foreign government being a candidate is collusion and means you 're a `` puppet '' . 
  r/t _ d2, 
  wait so we do n't actually hate immigrants , jews , homosexuals , do n't want to put anyone in concentration camps and are n't misogynistic ? 
  what am i even doing here then ?!, 
  kek, 
  the * subscribed * refers that you ( who views the profile ) is subscribed to the community , not him . 
  it does n't mean he is subscribed but that he goes here . 
  anyway he does lurk a lot lol, 
  did assange insult muslims ? 
  i think assange insulted muslims , that 's why sweden wants him back , so he can apologize to swedistani natives . 
  saying we wish they were killed as well , i think . 
  i just did n't upvote . 
  this is what putin would like you to believe !, 
  i was reading newsweek magazine ( do n't do that often since they are pro-islamic and in general not really good `` news '' outlet ) but a full-page picture of putin with a caption '' [ inside putin 's war on us democracy . 
  the russian plot against america !, 
  ] ( http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/embed-sm/public/2017/05/16/20170526cover1800-x-2400.jpg ) '' compelled me to do it as i was too interested . 
  supposedly it 's a world `` controlled by putin now and the west is merely trying to survive in it '' , essentially painting every country in the west as being basically powerless against the `` russian spymaster ( that 's the word they used ) '' and `` his armies of hacking millenials ( again a quote ) '' . 
  these are totally 100 % phrases that conspiracy theorists use . 
  i mean , * spymaster * , really lol . 
  but then it 's many in the us congress and government trying to remove a president from office on the basis on some unproven allegations , thus ignoring over 60 million voters -- that is somehow not a real threat to democracy and setting a , as they like to say with anything trump does , `` dangerous precedent '' that a president can be just removed if he 's politically uncomfortable . 
  so it could be liberal/left-wing fake news countered by conservative/right-wing fake news ? 
  i think the stare would n't have been so creepy if we never knew who this person is , what he did or what he believed . 
  it does n't look really `` evil '' if one tries to dissociate it from history , rather really annoyed . 
   but the first one , you see him as a human , having a good laugh with friends and colleagues , probably a bit excited or anxious, 
  look at this footage , same effect as you 're talking about :, 
  agreed .
