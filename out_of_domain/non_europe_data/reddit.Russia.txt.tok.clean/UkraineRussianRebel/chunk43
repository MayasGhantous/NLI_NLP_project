  what i meant is that if you saw some regular ( non-nazis or anything similar related ) person doing that look it would n't look `` evil '' or really `` creepy '' . 
  of course in this particular instance it * is * evil and creepy because we know what it means and why he had that look .

  ben garrison is compromised, 
  don ' trust him, 
  no shoe missing = fake ben, 
  it was a password so we know it 's really him, 
  we need proof of life, 
  this 100 % makes sense and it 's something i did n't think of . 
  russia could n't know at all how americans would react to the e-mails if at all ( russian media speculated before the election that a lot of americans will just think it 's a conspiracy or be fearmongered by the msm by `` russians supporting trump '' stories or painting trump as `` irresponsible , irrational , unstable '' enough not to vote for him ) , but if those e-mails did contain something blackmail-worthy , surely the `` russian hackers '' would n't have released them just like that . 
  i do n't like tyt but they [ noticed as well ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xssmg0maenq ), 
  not a nation but ideology . 
  this is neither soviet nor chinese nor any other communist country 's flag . 
   pierson students became aware of chu 's sordid yelp past after she sent out a *** college-wide email bragging about becoming `` yelp elite '' *** from writing so many reviews . 
  i am struggling to understand how this is relevant to anything college . 
  i know american universities emphasize this `` personal approach '' and `` student-staff friendly communication '' but it would feel supremely weird receiving a letter from my university with ... this ? 
  `` why should i tolerate and be respectful to someone who is not a sjw ? 
  checkmate . '', 
  #it 's a russian conspiracy, 
  let me provide [ an explanation ] ( https://i.redd.it/cxqvnduovaxy.jpg ) from an original source . 
  not me though , i was a russian trump supporter from the very beginning . 
  ( i swear i 'm not in on the hacking conspiracy nor am i being paid for commenting here ! ), 
  you might have just convinced me to give it a try because i listened a while ago and it seemed as mostly crazy stuff ... maybe i 'm just not redpilled enough . 
  i found this sub while browsing askreddit when it was fairly new and everyone was beginning to hate on it . 
  i knew who trump was and was a supporter back then so i decided to check out this absolutely abhorrent terrible sub no one on reddit could tell if it 's a joke or serious , and loved it . 
   where can i get summa dat russian flair ?

  yeah , i applied for my cnn permission before the election and got it last week . 
  i looked at wikileaks anyway as i wanted to know what it was so bad that it made hillary `` 99 % chance of winning '' clinton lose . 
  really , nothing , just regular emails . 
  now i believe russians hacked the elections because wikileaks is fake news !!, 
   `` video unavailable in your country '', 
  damn , i ca n't listen to my own president 's speech now ?!, 
  haha , i know which one it is though . 
  liberals mocked it at the time that `` no one is legalizing pedophilia what is that crazy homophobic guy talking about '' , and look at them now , pedosexuals and trangenderists and other `` sexual progressives '' wanting to let adult men into girls ' bathrooms . 
   not actual aliens, 
  just * illegal * ones, 
  i only puch women if they 're nazis . 
  it did n't . 
  ( i 'm russian ) well maybe not directly as i was a little when it happened , i do n't know how much airport/railway/subway security there was , now there are security scanners and armed guards everywhere but i 'd say that has more to do with our terror attacks in the 90s than 9/11 specifically . 
  r/t _ d2, 
   separate is not equal . 
  sooo ... are we saying women are not equal if we want separate bathrooms for girls and for boys ? 
  everyone on reddit is banned from r/offmychest, 
  anyone who 's not banned there apparently did n't post anywhere else ever . 
  #make carlos slim again, 
  okay :, 
  travel ban ( getting blocked though ), 
  ban on lobbying for several years ( did n't really follow that one though ), 
  cutting funding for sanctuary cities, 
  improving relationships with russia ( even though he 's constantly getting attacked for even talking to any russian i still appreciate the effort and ca n't even imagine what it would be like under hillary presidency ), 
  in general being himself rather than a scripted speech . 
  you kind of seem to know the person , not a role they 're playing . 
  that 's why i like trump tweets . 
  actually blames islamists for terrorism instead of blaming victims of terrorism for being `` islamophobic '' , thus `` creating terrorists '' and did n't call islam a `` religion of peace '' even once -- i 'm actually curious what he 's going to say in saudi arabia , probably some `` regular diplomacy '' rather than honesty i assume, 
  why ca n't we just drone biology and be any gender we want and drone medicine and be healthy at any size ? 
  it is a completely serious question * ( it is n't ) * , i think any progressive person should see by now that science is holding us back from social progress as a humanity and scientists , logicians , conservatives , medical professionals who are dividing humanity into genders are nothing but republican conservative backward shills probably paid by russians ( they tend to believe in the two genders conspiracy ) , trump and other regressives . 
  ** it sooo divisive and offensive !!!, 
  ** i ca n't believe we allow those people to operate under the guise of `` academic freedom '' when the freedom is directly working against our interests as people to be tolerant , accepting and non-judgmental , the divisive , restrictive barriers between the male and female bathrooms , that segregationist repressive straightjacket of a sexist patriarchal society need to be torn down if we are to advance as a people .

   the environment of threats and harrassment towards users , and antagonism towards other communities, 
  this is the absolutely the most hypocritical thing in that message . 
  just look at the pms our mods and just regular posters are receiving . 
  but * we * are the harrassing ones ...

  we have [ an account on twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/thedonaldreddit ) . 
  if the worst happens and they close it down here we know where and how to organize . 
  a centipede is a 3/5 of all other redditors . 
  i wanted to message mods but think it 's pointless at this time . 
  they wrote we should look back at 12am , apparently they wo n't be letting anyone in . 
  but yeah it 's weird , i was there for over a year , that subscribed posters still have to be `` invited '' . 
  #wrong . 
  do n't we have a discord or something ? 
  do n't have the link . 
  set to private until 12am . 
   calls for violence , are not allowed . 
  r/anarchism was not banned , weird, 
   doxxing , is not allowed . 
  who was being doxxed by us ? 
  any post revealing anyone 's info was instantly deleted . 
  even those where usernames were not blurred out . 
   circumventing systems of reddit to promote content that people do n't generally want to see ( and for good reason ) , is not allowed . 
  is upvoting posts in a subreddit `` circumventing '' ? 
  reddit censored us from r/all and made r/popular specifically so we do n't appear there . 
   spamming low quality content day in day out , is not allowed . 
  is it not allowed in our own sub ? 
   hate speech , not allowed . 
  that is subjective and many subreddits engage in what i 'd call hate speech ( is hating on trump supporters hate speech ? ) . 
  i do n't think we engaged in hate speech unless criticizing terrorists , illegal immigrants and islam is `` hateful '' . 
  t_d is * not * leaving , actually . 
  which is great .

  this . 
  i live in a country with virtually no africans but once i went to the west of europe and it 's crazy .
