   riyadh , saudi arabia -- president donald trump had to travel to someone else 's kingdom to get the respect he has always craved . 
   ** from his airport greeting by king salman of saudi arabia -- a courtesy that was never extended to his predecessor , president barack obama ** -- to the military flyover and cannons that accompanied his descent from air force one , to a lavish cardamon coffee ceremony and medal presentation at the royal court , the american president on saturday was treated like a real-life king . 
  yes . 
  obama never got that . 
  the king did n't even meet him at the airport . 
  i mean , why would you treat someone literally bowing to you as equal , right ?

  it ' literally ok, 
   `` i think the core policy of trump is focusing on eliminating terrorism and drying out its financial sources in the world and curbing the terror-supporting states , especially those neighboring iraq . 
  the impact of trump 's policy on the future of the middle east will hold positive elements .

  they do n't shake hands with women and it 's caused multiple `` scandals '' in europe :, 
   it 's widespread practice for schoolchildren in switzerland to shake the hands of their teacher at the beginning and end of each day . 
  now , one school 's decision to exempt two children from this tradition -- because the children are muslim and their teacher is a woman -- has caused a storm of controversy across the european state .

   this memory from a few decades ago came flooding back to sue this week , after it was revealed a sydney school allows muslim schoolboys to refuse to shake hands with women . 
   sue -- who as a teacher of indonesian has an excellent understanding of islam -- says : `` by the time some of these boys got to high school , their perception of women as inferior was deeply ingrained .

  to be fair , not infrequently jewish ghettos are very nice architecture-wise and many were n't really `` ghettos '' , they were just jews living in secluded areas to avoid pogroms ( but they frequently did get to ghettos , too ) . 
  basically , no-go zones ... but instead of no-go zones where you get raped for going in , they were in no-go zones to avoid being pogromed by those outside . 
  does n't change the fact that bernie is a complete , absolute hypocrite and a peddler of fake alternative facts . 
  the best was a twitter comment by an african american girl i saw once . 
  `` of course europeans can pride themselves on their inventions and civilizations when they had entire africa enslaved and working for them '', 
  haha , do they really think europeans , at any time in history , were like those greeks slowly [ promenading around the academy ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/sanzio_01.jpg ) , dressed in silk tunicas , discussing complex philosophical ideas all day , everyone having an african slave to do everything for them , and not , in the vast majority , serfs and peasants , or workers in manufactures for 15-16 hours daily , spending all day on the field , living in a small hut with straw roof ? 
  rachel dolezal is that you, 
  first jewish presidential nominee ( barry goldwater ) was a republican . 
  first asian american senator ( representing hawaii ) was republican . 
  what is it with those republicans and their ethnic diversity , unbelievable !, 
   there are no russians, 
  wrong . 
  i have a definitive proof that russians do , in fact , exist . 
  trump criticizes islam in america : islam is progressive !, 
  how dare he say it 's not a religion of peace !, 
  it 's bigotry and islamophobia !, 
  trump welcomed by muslims in saudi arabia and treated like a friend : is trump colluding with an oppresive islamic regime , trying to normalize the restrictive norms of islam and unfair treatment of religious minorities ? 
  can we expect that trump , in fact , travelled to saudi arabia to get inspired on how to effectivelly eliminate free press , silence political opponents , and become an unrestricted dictatorial monarch , seeking advice from saudi monarchy on those matters ? 
  is there a possibility that trump may be attempting to hijack the us constitution with sharia law to declare himself a caliph at some point in the future ? 
  the jews are just scared he will send them all to a concentration camp and bomb israel if he does n't like the welcoming ceremony . 
  do you think they do n't read the huffington post and salon in israel ? 
  trump will be a laughtingstock no one will be taking the us seriously why ca n't we have madame president reeeeeeeeeeeeee, 
  not op but there are some radical christian groups in africa that behave basically like isis . 
  but the point is , no one is justifying them the way people immediately jump to defend muslims . 
  and another point : i do n't want these christians in europe or anywhere in the civilized world , either , just like i do n't want islamic refugees , but only the latter are being forced on people . 
  any links ? 
  i know germans were committing genocide of those people among others during the occupation ( 1941-1944 ) but never heard of anything related to stalin . 
  i obviously know about that but i was asking about the romani as i never heard anything about that .

  it 's formerly a military estate which has `` ethnicized '' itself throughout history and now they 're kind of an ethnicity/cultural group within russia . 
  they were very pro-monarchy and are very conservative today so it makes sense communists were trying to get rid of them as they were among the most loyal tsarists . 
  they 're kind of an analogy to samurais . 
  they were patriotic muggers concerned about seth rich sharing the emails with rushens . 
  also they were strong supporters of hillary clinton .
