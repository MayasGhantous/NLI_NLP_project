   drive them out, 
  this is right , but somehow i really do n't have faith in saudis being the people interested in that . 
  sure , shaking hands , making deals ... at the end of the day it 's still one of the most oppressive islamist regimes that keeps funding sunni mosques and wahhabis throughout the world . 
  it is still super ironic to me when saudis were nodding to tillerson 's speech about being concerned about `` iran 's network of terror '' while their network of terror is far , far more extensive . 
  do n't teach them how to live . 
  this is absolutely correct . 
  do n't let them impose * their * way of life outside of muslim countries , either . 
  there is no contradiction in trump wanting to cooperate with muslim countries while being realistic and criticial about islam . 
  it 's a false dilemma that only liberals/msm dealing in absolutes are making . 
  the world is not black and white and there is no such contrast or a trade-off . 
  but imagine what the msm would be saying if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if he did !, 
  let 's just hope there will be fair historians and not cucks that the `` social studies '' programs at universities are churning out these days . 
   trump is an agent of god to protect israel . 
  do you realize how many / pol/acks you just triggered, 
  true , i meant the house of saud/current leadership specifically . 
  i do understand that great many arabs and muslims do n't think this way anymore . 
  what trump is doing is a forward-looking strategy . 
   low-key crushing on one my saudi female friends , she 's a babe . 
  good luck :p, 
  i really [ hope so ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/79/a3/a2/79a3a20cd327359682f07259b67b7608.jpg ), 
  right , but also many people conspiring about `` out greatest ally '' etc. 
  i did n't say `` all of / pol / '' but a lot . 
   the house of saud ( arabic : \u0622\u0644 \u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f \u0100l sa\u02bb\u016bd ipa : [ \u0294\u00e6\u02d0l sa\u0295u\u02d0d ] ) is the ruling royal family of saudi arabia . 
  ** the family has thousands of members . 
  yeah , a lot of deep state potential . 
  i think our subscription counter was broken . 
  the easiest way to repair it was to turn it off and then turn it back on . 
   women 's bodies are policed, 
  doctors advising women not to drink alcohol during pregnancy because it might endanger the child , [ oh god how oppressive and sexist . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/17/telling-women-not-drink-pregnancy-sexist/ ), 
  also putting `` developed countries '' in quotes kind of explains how the so-called feminists can claim that developed countries and those where sharia law rules are basically equal , just a different kind of `` oppression '' . 
  they throw stones at women for not conforming , while we have `` objectifying '' naked ads , who are we to judge , right ? 
  i am wondering if they actually understand they 're doing political propaganda or believe what they 're saying is real , and just neutral . 
  it 's like at those addresses they 're always saying stuff like `` prepare for the challenges of your life '' etc. , so now `` preparing for trump presidency '' is an another challenge , that to those people it is something just natural , neutral and common sense to believe this . 
  i do n't know anymore . 
  are you a journalism major or something and they 're trying to give you the last biased journalism lecture ? 
  lol, 
  like when a prof in a class about fascism in 1930s i was in said that she thinks her class `` is becoming relevant these days again '' . 
  we all know what 's code for . 
  are they at that place in afghanistan [ where moab was dropped ] ( https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/13578/production/_95642297_038992193-1.jpg ) ? 
  * local * bikers for trump , or american ? 
   other ministers told braverman they did not feel the need to come , because trump - unlike his predecessor barack obama - was not planning on shaking hands with the ministers at the airport . 
  ** obama even prepared notes for small talk with each minister ** as part of his so-called `` charm offensive '' for winning over israelis when he arrived in march 2013 . 
  could n't bring a telepromter lol, 
  i know , i was asking whether they 're local or americans who came to israel ... okay it 's a weird question , people are usually not renting harleys but having bikers for trump in israel is strange a bit . 
  edit : nevermind i 'm dumb . 
  it 's not bikers for trump as the official group , just israeli bikers supporting trump haha, 
  ~ ~ side of beef ~ ~ steak with ketchup !, 
  the news just came that the girl is actually russian , it 's definitely a part of the campaign ( also known as the vast alt-right conspiracy ) to smear clinton and her associates . 
  here is [ more information ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/katerina_tikhonova ) about her . 
  this applies to women , too . 
  * looking at you macaroni *, 
  pls no one blame muslims or they will feel bad . 
  we will radicalize them if we say islam is terrorist , this is my biggest fear . 
  i always make sure i am nice to muslims . 
  the more you talk about islam , the more terrorists you create . 
  some people say `` it 's because the west is bombing their countries '' , but then why are they massacring people who do n't attack muslim countries like , for example , christians in syria , or non-muslims in india ? 
  or muslims they deem less `` pious '' or `` too westernized '' ? 
  islam is indeed not compatible with western , and any civilized/secular/non-muslim people 's values . 
   they ~ ~ hate ~ ~ love multiculturalism, 
  without multiculturalism , muslims would n't have been in the west and were not tolerated there in the first place . 
  multiculturalism is the only thing that protect terrorists because it is based on `` tolerance '' to all cultures , including the violent , hateful and destructive ones ( islam ) . 
  who does that ? 
  it 's not free . 
  it 's paid by taxes/state insurance ( which is still basically taxes ) . 
  i think we 're doing the `` his name was seth rich '' well enough ourselves , so we do n't need a bot for that ... oh wait , we 're all russian bots . 
  or they have spies in the white house . 
  who was the last person not from the administration or close staff to visit the oval office , the white house ? 
  the russian photographer who came with lavrov and the ambassador . 
  he planted the listening devides all over there . 
  wapo colludes with russia confirmed . 
  it does . 
  oh god i hope it 's north korea !!!!!!!!!!, 
  i had a blog which was fairly popular . 
  it was a bit niche and i started it first so some people referred to me as `` legendary '' in that area . 
  it 's been long since abandoned . 
  alaska and canada . 
  why are they killing people in their own countries under the same premises as in the west then ? 
   protecting empire, 
    imperialism, 
     capitalism, 
  it was westerners protecting their oppressive imperialist empires !, 
  go muslims !, 
  -- sjws, 
  man , good times , good times , when will we go crusading again ? 
  progressively muslim crusade, 
   they were completely justified . 
  one prof in my college called them `` islamophobic wars '', 
  african person sells slaves on a market in africa . 
  african people are buying them . 
  then british people come on boats . 
  want to buy slaves . 
  the african person , not being a discriminating bigot and wanting a good deal like every merchant , sells slaves to the british . 
   woooow the british were so oppressive they had slaves !!!, 
  reparayshuns now !!, 
  russian prince vladimir was deciding whether to accept orthodox christianity from the byzantine empire or islam from the arabs in 988 . 
  thanks god he chose the former . 
   by the mid 980s vladimir realized the need to adopt the true religion . 
  in 987 , as reported in the primary chronicle , and after consulting with his boyars ( knights ) , vladimir dispatched envoys to study the religions of neighboring nations . 
  upon returning , the envoys reported their impressions , noting their objections to the religions of the muslims , jews , and german christianity , while expressing the joy of the festive ritual in the cathedral hagia sophia in constantinople .
