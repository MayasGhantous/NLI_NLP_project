  every terrorist is a * beautiful , diverse , multifaceted * individual with their own * challenges and difficulties in life * and should be treated accordingly !, 
  do n't judge , we are all different and have our own struggles . 
  what we need to fight terrorism is to love one another , like , no borders , no prejudice , just embracing the differences and diversity . 
  remember , we 're all * just human * , no ban , no wall , no hate . 
  this is what terrorists want , they want us to build walls and close our borders , then they win !, 
  he does look a * tiny * bit african though . 
  just very little . 
  piecekeeper, 
  possibly both . 
  at the beginning , they 're scared of the latter , then the former becomes a real possibility and you ca n't turn it back . 
  #for suicide bombing job openings , please call [ jihad suicide hotline ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qedsueq6xoy ), 
  i heard he was also trying to body slam trump but there 's only audio recording so i do n't know . 
  i am following cnn closely . 
  it was just a transition to a different state of alpha . 
  but the guy is a `` muslim '' ( to leftists anyone who is an arab/pakistani etc. 
  is a muslim , regardless of whether they actually practice the religion ) so he can say that , right , and it 's not islamophobic ? 
  i really want europe to culturally appropriate the first amendment . 
  carry pride nation wide, 
  `` those homos are very offensive to muslim culture . 
  should 've thought before going to a bar like that . 
  it 's their fault that they offended muhammad . '', 
  i thought macaroni won the handshake , which makes him the supreme leader ???!!, 
  the thing is that ukraine is [ very divided ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/ukraine_electionsmap_nov2004.png ) , the western part is ukrainian nationalist , catholic , speaks mostly ukrainian , while the east is very pro-russian , orthodox . 
  speaks russian . 
  the yanukovich government won the elections * very narrowly * , it was razor thin , but then the revolt which eventually turned into the maidan revolution began in the west and yanukovich was overthrown . 
  looking at the election results ( 90 + and 80 + % yanukovich in some regions , while 90 + nationalists in others ) , it is not surprising that crimea separated , and the eastern regions started an uprising : it is a symmetric response to what happened in the west of the country ( the local governments were overthrown there in a similar way like those in the east ) . 
  look at us, 
  we 're the untermenschen now, 
   they are n't going left or right anymore ... they 're going up, 
  great description, 
  is n't it funny how something absolutely real , undoubted since the beginning of humanity is now met with either a smug smirk or total hate by liberals ? 
  it 's like anything they decide is true comes into existence , anyone who opposes it is ignorant by definition . 
  according to the article , madeline albright . 
  easter is not important , [ muslims will soon be the majority and if you did n't behave in a certain way then it 's off with you ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/679wu9/me_and_my_wife_take_very_good_care_of_our_pooch/ ), 
  know nothing party supporter here , hillary is the crazy one . 
  no , the less libtarded one of them becomes a trump apologetic sexist bigoted neofascist in the eyes of the other . 
  but that is in the real world , for what would happen in a hypothetical case where the libtardism of both in the room would be exactly identical and equal , i have no answers . 
  o f, 
  deport muslims `` refugees '' from europe, 
  for every deported muslim take in a christian ( who is willing/wants ) to come . 
  if they * really * want refugees , at least take the real victims . 
  take that for crusades , copts !, 
  people with infinitely small weight are the most based ones . 
  it makes 100 % sense because people living in a certain region tend to look similar , so logically chinese dictators were killing chinese-looking people , russian/soviet were tyrannizing russian-looking people etc. 
  i was recently called a `` bigot '' for stating that the us founded by europeans , it 's apparently an inappropriate thing to state because europeans tend to have a skin color the leftists now do n't like . 
  the left is obsessed with what people look like for whatever reason . 
  also , `` all wars in all times '' is a ridiculous thing to say . 
  does he think there were literally * no wars * outside of europe ? 
  the reason why european wars had more victims , were more global , was the fact we were more powerful , had more advanced weapons , and greater global reach . 
  while it has an adverse effect on how much people were victims of the wars , as such it 's nothing to be ashamed of . 
  rather , we should be glad that we were on `` the top of the food chain '' . 
  nothing prevented other people from doing so , too , but they did n't . 
  it 's nothing to be ashamed of . 
   persians, 
  the problem is that many [ persian people ] ( https://i.imgur.com/evnrovg.png ) look [ very european ] ( http://www.worldstopmost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ali-khamenei-the-supreme-leader-of-iran-top-famous-persian-people-of-the-21st-century-2019.jpg ) . 
  like [ south europeans ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/e2/0b/ab/e20bab095353bf1bf1a56690fcbb235d.jpg ) . 
  the greeks , who fought persians , looked very similar . 
  so this just makes [ persians ] ( https://www.ivpn.net/blog/wp-content/img/iranian_protesters.jpg ) evil , too !, 
  am historian . 
  can confirm , while to an untrained eye and right wing ignoramuses it might seems that not all wars were , in fact , started by europeans , this is wrong . 
  in cooperation with advanced gender research we could determine that all the people who were not europeans in fact * identified as them . 
  imagine hillary being there . 
  please no . 
  thank you america for not electing her . 
  right , it includes even stuff like `` throwing rocks at a police car during demonstration '' , not exactly things we perceive as an outright terror attack . 
  yeah , i am not at all scared of germany tbh . 
  i do n't even believe this `` the eu is germany 's project to `` peacefully '' take over europe '' , historically , apparently , it was france 's project to keep germany [ down and under surveillance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robert_schuman ) . 
  germany is not a threat as such , as a nation , it is under ( existential , perhaps ? ), 
  threat from inside , and the leftist liberal multicultural pro-muslim-immigrant ideology just seems like something they feel they need to * force * on the rest of europe but see it as being `` morally superior '' this time , while viewing themselves as `` still guilty '' so they need to `` make up for it '' by `` helping '' `` refugees '' , rather than as an assertion of power . 
   directly in the western world . 
  but manchester is not the first time , nor is it the incident with highest victim count , when this happened . 
  probably we 're reaching the `` critical mass '' . 
  they are very possibly ovewhelmed by reality as well . 
  to the point where they ca n't face it , so they 're making up an illusion where the terrorism , violence and hatred is somehow something they caused by their behavior ( `` islamophobia '' ) , and thus maintain another illusion that they may have some control over it ( `` being nice to muslims will prevent terrorism '' ) . 
  facing the fact that that terrorism has nothing to do with their islamophobia and will not be prevented by `` being nice to them '' is too much to handle , apparently , and it shatters their narrative and worldview . 
  wtf, 
  hahah sure , i did n't mean this post to be completely serious , just that merkel talking as if she 's `` in charge of europe '' is pretty distressing . 
  exactly . 
  but i do n't think austria is destroyed , they have virtually no immigrants there and have quite a strong populist movements there . 
  hopefully austria will be fine , it 's a great country . 
  of course women are free in islam , and have more rights than women anywhere else !, 
  do n't forget that this is the_donald , the bastion of right-wing conspiracies and redneckery . 
  women do have rights in islam , they have the best rights , the sexists bigots on here just do n't know anything better than the us constitution , various european declarations of rights , the ten commandments , because they never bother to learn about the beauty of the quran and sharia law !, 
  * that is real freedom * !, 
  i parsed this as patriarchal infantilizing objectification . 
  there is russia among them . 
  i think this proves the collusion !, 
   silent majority, 
  but ... california !, 
  but hillary won the popular vote, 
  he 's an illegitimate president !!!!, 
  guy does n't really look middle eastern, 
  did the french already start the conversion ? 
  lol, 
  / pol / was looking for her when she was first noticed , no idea what happened to that investigation . 
  old people should not be allowed to vote !!!, 
  they wo n't have to live here , but how will we live without the eu ????!!!!!, 
  they are destroying the future for us young generations !!! 1 !!!, 
  ! 1 i want a second referendum , this time without anyone older than 19 !!!, 
  ( all young conservatives exluded ! ),
