  * remainiacs, 
  still has a beard . 
  masculinity . 
  male supremacy . 
  facial hair is a symbol of male supremacy . 
  persian , assyrian and greek warriors were famed for their beards , they had a massive toxis masculinity problem . 
  or is that an islamic mujahideen beard ? 
  in that case it 's ok , do n't want to be islamophobic here !, 
   you ca n't solve anything with violence . 
  unless it 's, 
  b i k e, 
  but is n't sunday a free day by standard ? 
  as in , it 's assumed people do n't work on weekends ? 
  that it 's not a special holiday of any kind , but a regular weekend . 
  missed it . 
   president donald trump paid tribute on memorial day to the men and women who have died in combat , saying they `` all share one title in common and that is the title of *** ` hero . 
  seems like they quoted trump , it just looks very unfortunate in the headline . 
  how many people actually * did * own slaves ? 
  it 's not like everyone could afford a personal slave . 
  it 's not like everyone in europe was a feudal lord with a castle just because there was a feudalism as a social system at one point , a similar situation was with slavery in america . 
  i think it was the tiny trumps that did it in the end . 
  r/redacted won , it 's over centipedes . 
  i agree . 
  alt-right is primarily a label , meaning an alternative to the mainstream `` conservatism '' of parties both in the us and europe which do n't want to deal with any real issues . 
  it does n't mean , it does n't have to mean a `` scary hate-fascist '' as the media are trying to portray it . 
  just like pepe is not a `` nazi frog '' but can be used in any context , alternative to fake conservatism is not `` nazism '' or `` fascism '' or anything similar . 
   `` matt rinaldi looked into the gallery and saw hispanic people and automatically assumed they were undocumented . 
  he racial profiled every single person that was in the gallery today . 
  he created the scenario that so many of us fear , '' [ romero added .

  hahah , what do you expect if they 're protesting for illegal immigration and some are even holding signs that they 're illegal ? 
  it 's normal to assume and profile that they 're , in fact , illegals . 
  also , what 's with this democrats/liberals/lefties constantly saying they 're `` feeling unsafe '' ?

  i am not a socialist but still skinny . 
  in my case , what makes me a conservative and not a multicultural leftie is probably the thought that i wo n't be able to defeat a gang of muslims :p, 
  no , they 're not . 
  the interest of the question is whether they 're going to start a family . 
  how it 's done is implied but it 's not the subject . 
  i also do n't accept trannies and pedos . 
  i am not very progressive . 
  and piranhas !, 
  i second this . 
  hillary voters , for most part , have no table manners . 
  it is . 
  it 's not normal to believe you are physically not something what you actually are , and it 's pretty nasty to expect and demand -- even as far as the state enforcing it -- that other people play along you perceptions . 
  the so-called `` transgender '' people describe feelings of not being able to `` look in the mirror '' and being `` disgusted '' with their bodies , which is definitely not what a healthy person should or would feel . 
  nothing . 
   however , given the similarities between far-right and islamic radicalization , it 's worth examining the efforts by political scientists and counterterrorism experts to combat the latter . 
   they recommend staying away from heavy content moderation ( which fuels accusations of censorship ) , and instead crafting and spreading messages that speak to *** young men 's alienation and disenfranchisement *** , without using scapegoats . 
  since criticism from the mainstream media -- or worse , the left -- is easy to dismiss out of hand , *** former far-right extremists *** who 've since rejected the red pill can be enlisted to provide counterexamples and point out inconsistencies in extremist worldviews . 
  one can apprently only be opposed to terrorism and islamism if they 're an alienated , disenfranchised male . 
  substituting `` red pilled '' , `` right-winger '' , `` trump supporter '' , `` patriot '' for `` right-wing extermist '' , does a thing like a `` former far right extermist '' even exist ? 
  lol, 
  anyway , if they consider us extremists in the likes of isis , and believe they can convince us to stop believing what we believe by `` giving us advice '' and `` spreading messages '' , it explains everything about why none of the `` counter-terrorism '' strategies work . 
  i know i would n't stop thinking the way i do because someone tells me `` it 's wrong '' , and i am no `` radicalized extemist '' . 
  good luck convincing islamists they should be `` good guys and just cut it out '', 
  liberals/liberal democrats ? 
  i like him more than macron because he kind of resembles an old-style hippie communist , while macron is pure mindless `` globalism '' and following the eu , but they 're equally bad . 
  maybe corbyn is a bit worse as he 's even more leftist . 
  a single transcriptome of a green toad, 
  i am a cuck . 
  phuc me right ? 
  a small group of people know what covfefe means . 
  that 's enough . 
  what the actual f are those linked videos . 
  not that i am especially paranoid , perhaps someone is trying to appear `` creepy '' and `` mysterious '' , kind of like subreddits with random codes and numbers that one point just go silent and do n't post anything anymore ? 
  it 's super weird anyway . 
  i could n't watch it , makes me feel sick -- or maybe just the way / pol / presented it makes it far more disturbing . 
  0/10 would not watch again, 
  i 'd like to know , too , but i 'm not going back there ... 
  especially that it 's around 2 am here lol, 
  yes . 
  it actually is even possible to get banned from there , i originally thought 4chan was completely uncontrolled and unsupervised . 
  no , it 's not the video , probably . 
  it 's the fact everyone is talking about how weirded out they felt after it that makes it creepy . 
  honestly i turned it off after 5 seconds lol .

  #yes we can, 
  do we know if it was a terror attack yet though ? 
  the news so far is fire . 
  well the news is 5 minutes old , are there limits when the coulter law sets in or is it counted immediately ? 
  i think it was de rushns diverting attention from the hacking . 
  global warming overheating muslim heads , turning them into terrorists . 
  russian bank ? 
  everyone knows all russian banks are owned by putin personally so this is something !, 
  catholic false flag, 
  if there was no global warming and the us stayed in the paris agreement , enough heat would 've never accumulated to cause this fire . 
  you 're not yourself when you 're thirsty . 
  have some \\ #covfefe, 
  manila , the capital of the philippines ? 
  they were screaming * god is great in arabic * [ not allahu akbar , that 's too terrorist ], 
  kek, 
  4d confederate underwater slavery chess, 
  it is comments like this when i am reminded that ngos can not solve any issues by definition because for far too many people being a ngo activist has become a career path . 
  if you deal with your issue , you have no job . 
  reparations not jobs !, 
  we worked as slaves long enough !, 
  impeach drumpf !, 
  he does n't care about black people !,
