  we need to keep blaming the russians !, 
  low information voters , they got conned !, 
  it 's what they 're already saying actually . 
  i think i understand how means it . 
  russians hacked the election , did n't they ? 
  i am on desktop , have 0 votes , too . 
  it shows 0 votes . 
  they downvote so much ? 
  i initially thought it was an error . 
   hillary : i 'm with her, 
   trump : i 'm with you , the american people . 
  why wear american pin if one is supposed `` to be with her '' , and she is , presumably , with herself only . 
  am torn . 
  as someone who lives in europe , should i upvote ? 
  i clicked . 
  we 're both now . 
  serious discussion and fun . 
  it will continue . 
  it 's going to be the first american inauguration i 'm going to watch . 
  the first energy peak on this sub was the election night, 
  the second is now, 
  great atmosphere there, 
  ca n't verify it 's not u / s p e z !, 
  72 % upvoted, 
  brigaders have no respect,

  anyone watching fox ? 
  my broadcast just fell , switched to rsbn,

  or did this sub turn to gold like a second ago ? 
  #congratulations mr. president, 
  just tell me ... can bernie still win ? 
  liberals ' `` it 's all just a campaign speech , he 'll be just like establishment '' btfo, 
  has n't tweetet yet . 
  curious , how long after the inauguration there 'll be the first tweet ? 
  radical, 
  islamic, 
  terrorism, 
  finally , someone who says it, 
  is that a compliment by tucker ? 
  since we appropriated the word ` populist ' to mean a good thing , like we did with ` deplorable ' , i assume it is . 
  found it on a thread that unfortunately did n't make it near the top . 
  this has to be shared , for sure . 
   we developed for a long time and produced something we could naturally handle . 
  which is why trump said in his inauguration speech that america ( and the west ) will no longer be trying to force its way of life on other cultures . 
  conservatives understand this , our convictions are based around the gradual development of society ( not `` stagnation '' or `` resistance to change '' , as the left would like people to believe . ), 
  it is impossible to `` force '' `` democracy '' on countries that have no philosophical basis for it , most of the muslim middle east being an example . 
  it 's not terrorism if it 's against israel , it 's `` palestinian liberation . '', 
  a muslim fighting for `` women 's rights '' is one of the most contradictory , ridiculous things ever . 
  she owes her `` rights '' to the fact she lives in a country where her religion has no relevance ( and will not have ) . 
  some feminists still do . 
  the thing about feminism and other ideological names is that women being opposed to islam is not `` feminism '' , it does n't have to be called some ideological term , it 's just common sense . 
  oh , they 're still walking . 
  i love it how he did n't change . 
  `` you will be saying : mr. president , we do n't need so much backing , but you 'll gon na get that backing . '', 
  president hillary clinton, 
  secretary of state john podesta, 
  * shudder *, 
  do n't like to be the `` looks through post history '' person but, 
   bernie has made his money trying to help those who have been disenfranchised by the corporate influence on american politics . 
  mike pence , a governor, 
   inexperienced, 
  michael flynn , three star general , former director of national intelligence, 
   inexperienced, 
  donald trump , a graduate of university of pennsylvania, 
   uneducated, 
  rex tillerson , ceo of exxon mobil, 
   slacker, 
  it probably is not serious but then it 's jezebel , so i do n't know . 
  i live in a european country , here liberal commentators accused trump of sounding `` communist '' and `` almost bolshevik '' , that his speech would be more fitting for `` a castro , che guevara or chavez of some kind . '', 
  point : he said that `` power goes from the elites to the people . '', 
  communists said something along the lines , too , thus trump = communist . 
  it was a channel under obama , too . 
  it 's been there since 2006 . 
  all the videos just got deleted , like the @potus tweets etc. 
  what resolution is that photo ? 
  sorry , but the title is inaccurate . 
  in this case it was n't rapefugees , and not muslims . 
  it was a fight over drugs in this case . 
  liveleak commenter pointed this out . 
  stay vigilant centipedes !, 
  translation :, 
  further investigation : the girl promised the guy a dose of pervitin over chat , when they met , she gave him soda powder . 
  he wanted his $ 15 back , she refused , a fight ensued . 
  my favorite of their quotes is `` trump 's election proves america hates women . '', 
  women are not a part of america . 
  they 're something separate that just exists in america , and `` america '' hates it . 
  so , only those who participated in the march , and did not vote for trump , are `` real '' women , and the other women are the `` america that hates women '' ? 
  i am confused ( a bit ) . 
  organized by a muslim who supports hezbollah and says sharia law is `` misunderstood '' . 
  more women are pro-life than men are .
