  is it really bad or just expensive ? 
  i know a guy from pittsburgh , he likes it lol . 
  i am moving to [ chyna ] ( https://sociorocketnewsen.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/china-pollution.jpg ) so drumpf does n't have his way !!, 
  your biological instincts are broken , go check yourself , especially if you are a woman . 
  i am not a trump voter ( not an american ) but i support trump and his ideas , if this counts . 
  i am not sure , i definitely do n't think `` climate change is a hoax '' , or a secret plot to `` decrease productivity '' , nor do i know if it is really caused by humans or the theory about solar activity has a greater influence is correct ( in that case our attempts to avert it are stupid and futile , we are not `` saving '' nature but trying to fight it ) ... what i hear the treaty has some hidden caveats there , like tpp . 
  i think the best thing would be to keep decreasing co2 output , which is the direction most developed countries are going in anyway : new hybrid cars , cleaner power plants and renewable energy , it is simple necessity because the non-renewable resources will at one point be very low . 
  i do n't think specific treaty will be of much use . 
  its what you can express with freeze peach, 
  i wanted to say something about africa , desertification , droughts etc. 
  but they were talking about the us specifically it seems . 
  i 'm at loss . 
  i ca n't explain their logic . 
  i did n't know you are a girl , but i would n't marry you . 
  you sound like a bitter childfree feminist . 
  if you are young , you will grow out of that `` edginess '' and will have a happy family , but if you are older ... 
  based on your karma it will take you 10 minutes to post a reply , so we 'll have to wait for an answer . 
  ok , but this is not the case for the vast majority of people . 
  over 80 % of women will have children and this is how society naturally functions and continues . 
  i have cynophobia btw , so as i said , you do sound like a bitter anti-women gender studies person . 
  my assessment was correct . 
  the fact you need to spew hate on women proves it !, 
  reddit is fairly anonymous , it 's not like anyone can find out anything . 
  i am a creep , hence i stalk . 
   we are ~ ~ woman ~ ~ women . 
  i do n't consider arguments from people to people who make typos . 
   you 're not even an american . 
  go away . 
   forms an opinion based on what he 's heard, 
  do n't you form your opinion based on news and reports as well , or do you always have access to classified info and primary sources ? 
  do you read thousands of pages of the actual treaties , and it 's very often literally many thousands of pages ? 
  i rate this as fake news that only a cuck would believe . 
  the paris treaty is a blatant globalist trap based on a hoax engineered by george soros and his liberal puppets known as the eu bureaucracy !, 
  yes . 
  i am a theoretical physicist . 
  i agree . 
  the west/developed world in general should do stuff in those countries the chinese way . 
  the people there ( in the third world and africa in particular ) get treated like everyone else instead of having humanitarian aid and gifts thrown at them . 
  they get paid for working for chinese companies , it 's beneficial for both parties instead of us just giving them stuff and not wanting anything in return . 
   the share of american women in their mid-40s who are childless appears to be at its lowest point in 20 years . 
  in 2014 , 15 % of women ages 40 to 44 had not given birth to any children . 
  this is down from 20 % in 2005 and similar to the rate of childlessness in 1994 . 
  http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/05/07/childlessness/ ( usa ), 
  oecd countries :, 
  this is true , isis just claims anything violent these days . 
  but if the `` lone gunman '' is a muslim , it is terrorism . 
  do you think the us would be upholding it if everyone else is cheating ? 
  cnn said it was sold to russia . 
  weird . 
  so whose puppet is drumpf after all , xi 's or putins ' ? 
   migrants, 
  wtf, 
  this is [ `` emerging economies '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emerging_markets#/media/file:developing_countries.png ) + china and india ( not marked in blue as they 're `` newly industrialized '' ) . 
  they 're setting the standard of emerging/developed based on the gdp per capita standards ... so yeah , if they 're basing it on per capita pollution , then china can have 2 times more pollution and russia 1.5 times more pollution , india about 10 times more , until they reach the us level . 
  crazy . 
  so you want [ muslims to take over ???!!!, 
  ] ( http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/patrick-goodenough/turkeys-erdogan-urges-turks-europe-procreate-you-are-future-europe ) they have plenty of kids !, 
  even here in europe , we will have to pray five times a day and starve a whole month in a few years ( maybe in a decade at best ) if we do n't have more kids now !, 
  there is a muslim woman in my neighborhood who has two small kids and a teenage one , so living standards are clearly not a problem , she lives in the same country , why ca n't we have as many kids as they do ? 
  the answer : feminism destroyed our women 's desire to have a family !, 
  muslims ( and many christians and jews ) did n't fall for it , but many gullible women did !, 
  it is our duty as men and defenders of our christian and european heritage to prevent the saracens from conquering us `` by the wombs of their women '' , as gaddafi famously said !, 
   if i decide it 's not for me, 
  it 's extremely egoistic . 
  it is called the [ tyranny of small decisions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tyranny_of_small_decisions ) . 
  putting your narrow `` interests '' and superficial `` enjoyment '' above everything else that in aggregate have disastrous consequences for societies if the same is done by a large amount of people . 
  childfreeism is a disturbing cultural phenomenon in the west and japan , and korea , singapore , even formally conservative ( ! ), 
  iran and many christian countries , basically everywhere in the developed world because feminism destroyed the women 's ( and mens ' ) sense of real values and puts `` enjoyment '' , defined as shallow spoils and lack of responsibility as the highest aim in life , it infanitilizes people ( both men and women ) , creates a false sense of peace and security , it 's an inherently anti-women and anti-human ideology that i believe may cause a downfall of humanity , or at least will damage it for a long time in the future . 
   ( political ) world burn, 
  it 's because the heat will drain the swamp and then america will be great again . 
  or `` for poor kids '' , `` animals '' , `` unfortunate women-and-children refugees from war-torn countries '' ( who have thousands of $ to pay to smugglers ) , or `` human rights advances '' ... 
   1 prevent extremist threats from taking root, 
  europe is ( still ) very stable politically and socially , somehow there are ( islamic ) extremist threats of such magnitude that the security services are admitting there is nothing to be done . 
   2 gain preferential access to booming markets in expanding economies, 
  this is what one can accomplish by offering good , mutually advantageous deals , you do n't need to just throw aid and money at them first . 
  see : china, 
   3 gain valuable diplomatic points as a world leader in human rights, 
  the west has adopted an image of `` fighter for human rights '' for decades . 
  it does n't help anything , many of the `` developing countries '' are not all that enthusiastic about being told what to do , so being a `` defender of human rights '' wins no points , rather it 's seen as condescending `` moral superiority '' . 
  getting rid of `` uncomfortable '' governments ( like gaddafi ) directly contradicts point 1 and precludes point 2 . 
  so the liberal speak , in my view , does n't even have any good ideas . 
  sadly we can not go there without cnn 's permission . 
  if they stopped funding millions of illegals and various `` diversity programs '' , covering imaginary gender therapies , i think that with the californian taxation levels and economy size single-payer public healthcare which covers actual health could 've been wholly feasible , but unfortunately modern liberals/leftists can not separate important things from nonsense . 
  well the eu is a as big an economy as the us but the idea of eu `` sanctioning '' the us over a `` climate agreement '' , given the economic ties of europe with the us , is completely ridiculous . 
  what exactly would the sactions look like in their mind ? 
  lol, 
   can you give me ( in your opinion ) some of the things that trump has tried to do that benefit the american people, 
  sanctions on sanctuary cities, 
  wrong . 
  there are a few answers already . 
  no politician in american history has been treated as unfairly as trump . 
  wrong . 
  anything one does n't have evidence for does n't exist . 
  your sentence only applies to stuff like `` god '' where you ca n't have a definite proof . 
  the russians !,
