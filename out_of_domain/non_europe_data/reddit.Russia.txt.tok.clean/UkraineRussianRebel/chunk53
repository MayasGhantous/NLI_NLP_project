  some have said that we do n't have a feel for immediately realizing what is sarcasm and what is not because of all the brigading . 
  i once posted a bit longer sarcastic comment without / s at the end on t_d and got banned , as the punchline was at the end and someone apparently did n't bother to finish reading ... 
  this is why they 're on the left . 
  it would be funny if they were just starving for a month and praying five times a day and that was it , then i 'd look at them funny . 
  but islam is not just that , it 's not funny , it 's terrifying . 
  ftfy, 
  they 're completely wrong because everyone knows that non-muslims ca n't be terrorists . 
  terrorism requires control of institutions , terrorist institutions . 
  ** terrorism is defined as violence + islam . 
  the government-controlled centralized organization for muslims is actually an interesting idea ... russia has had that [ since 18th century ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ru&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fru.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2f%25d0%25a6%25d0%25b5%25d0%25bd%25d1%2582%25d1%2580%25d0%25b0%25d0%25bb%25d1%258c%25d0%25bd%25d0%25be%25d0%25b5_%25d0%25b4%25d1%2583%25d1%2585%25d0%25be%25d0%25b2%25d0%25bd%25d0%25be%25d0%25b5_%25d1%2583%25d0%25bf%25d1%2580%25d0%25b0%25d0%25b2%25d0%25bb%25d0%25b5%25d0%25bd%25d0%25b8%25d0%25b5_%25d0%25bc%25d1%2583%25d1%2581%25d1%2583%25d0%25bb%25d1%258c%25d0%25bc%25d0%25b0%25d0%25bd_%25d0%25a0%25d0%25be%25d1%2581%25d1%2581%25d0%25b8%25d0%25b8&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) ( sorry , google translate , no english page ) , it controls mosques and imams , elects chief imam ( `` muftis '' ) , reports on potential radicalism ( mainly an issue on the caucasus and chechnya , not in other areas ) , unifies muslims in russia under an official structure .

  you 're right , i agree , this is the correct assessment . 
  most of them are just extremely naive , and aggressive when you point that out . 
  they know it . 
  i know a few people like this who legitimately believe stuff like `` we 're helping refugees '' and `` it has nothing to do with islam '' . 
  it 's just that the results of that are terrible . 
  it was more of `` tongue-in-cheek '' on my part : if they 're calling us `` evil '' and whetever names they can invent , why we ca n't sometimes retaliate ?

  m&m s being occassionaly poisoned is a part and parcel of buying in a large hypermarket . 
  this is not a reason not to consume m&m s. just remember that not only m&m s are poisoned , but there are sometimes needles found in bread , though very rarely . 
  so it 's unfair to say that only m&m s are to blame when you sometimes have bad bread , too , and other products . 
  it is also not true that being m&m s is the sole cause , plenty of m&m s are , after all , irrefutably unpoisoned . 
  it is simply a fact of life that the more m&m s there are , the more of them are going to be poisoned . 
  we should just carry on as before and keep eating m&m s.

  the sad part is that if you read responses to nbc publishing the video on twitter , most liberals are outraged : `` i will not watch this , nbc is giving a platform for propaganda to a brutal russian tyrannical dictator who influenced our election and made trump president , and now will try to deceive us into believing he did n't , shame on you nbc , why would you do that ? '', 
  i mean , if you actually believe this , it may be actually worth listening to what a guy you believe `` appointed '' your country 's president is saying , at least to know what kind of `` deceptions '' he is using so you can better refute those arguments ... thair minds are far too closed and work in a circular argument . 
  trump is a `` russian puppet '' .

  why ? 
  because anyone who believes something that i do n't was influenced by russian propaganda . 
  we should not underestimate the analog memes . 
  in case of a natural disaster ( like in consequence of the withdrawal from the paris accord ) , if the entire internet infrastructure goes down , power goes out , these memes will still be there .

  anyone investing in analog memes now will be a billionaire in the postapocalyptic memeconomy . 
  antifa in paris , i heard and saw , is insane .

  someone tried to debunk this by saying that `` japan does n't have terrorism because it does n't bomb the middle east '' and the terrorists are attacking in london and paris `` in revenge '' , so , obviously , it has `` nothingtodowithislam '' . 
  but if japan had bombed the middle east , they still would n't have muslims to carry out terror attacks `` in revenge '' , right ?
