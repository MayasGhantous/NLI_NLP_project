  it 's easier to blame yourself ( unless you can blame trump supporters , rednecks and toxic masculinity ) for what happens . 
  withdraw the military from the middle east and the terrorism will end instantly -- but it wo n't , should iraq , afghanistan , pakistan `` withdraw from muslim countries '' , too , to stop terrorism ? 
  ~ ~ top ~ ~ sadkek, 
  most iranians ( persians ) are secular , they do n't really like living under the mandates of sharia law ( google `` my elusive freedom '' in iran ) . 
  it is actually one of the few middle eastern countries where i do care about terrorism because their population are not mostly radical sunnis justifying terror attacks -- and pretty much no terror attacks happen in iran . 
  if they adopted sharia into their legal system , criminalized critizing prophet and obliged women to wear hijabs , it would n't have happened ... oh wait, 
  have a math prof from iran ( sample size : 1 ) , can confirm , persian ( s ) are based :p, 
  do i understand it correctly that the recipient of this letter has to pay $ 1.872 every month ? 
  what happens if you do n't ? 
  i do n't live in america and i assume ( know ) incomes are higher there , but $ 1.872 is * more * than my current monthly salary ( i work part-time and freelance a bit ) . 
  it 's actually a fairly decent salary in central europe . 
  a different kind of blast than what you 'd get in paris , but not bad either !, 
  if `` good muslim '' means following everything in quran , literally , taking it as the absolute `` word of god '' , then it is possible to be a good person -- but only from the point of view of other muslims with the same ideology , apparently . 
  i agree . 
  it 's not like we ( or anyone ) - sorry for godwin 's law - differentiates among moderate and radical nazis ... why be any kind of a nazi if there is an option not to have such an ideology ? 
  how many % agree that `` terrorism and suicide bombing is sometimes justified '' , 20 ? 
  i read this article but still ca n't tell what this has to with islam . 
  i seriously ca n't even understand why anyone would think that chanting koran and yelling `` this is for allah '' makes it somehow connected to islam . 
  the girls were `` asian '' , after all !!!!, 
  it 's an issue of radicalized asian female engineering student terrorism , not islam !,

  we need to investigate what role chinese hackers played in him getting elected governor . 
  the calexit guy is a troll imho . 
  maybe he is n't but living in russia while being a * progressive leftwinger * and organizing calexit is just top kek .

  #breaking news : pence resigns , will not run for president in 2020, 
  after massive reddit backlash , the rnc announces there will be no nomination for the 2020 election . 
  `` i think that after what we saw with donald trump , this is a disaster , this should n't have happened . 
  proposing any nominations and holding a convention would just be a waste of money and time . 
  it would be worse than goldwater-johnson , '' quoted sen. john mccain ( r-az ) this story is developing . 
  are you telling me hillary * is not * the president ? 
  is that why we have the russian puppet in the white house for nearly five months ? 
  i 'm sorry i did n't watch the election and i did n't vote but wtf how could that happen . 
  i did n't even bother because i just assumed she won !!, 
  \\ + 1 rapist, 
  trump is not a billionaire because he only makes $ 100 million a year , which is less than a billion . 
   show me a young republican and i 'll show you a man with no heart, 
  i am a man with no heart :(, 
  what i 'm wondering about more is how exactly does trump being president affect their life ? 
  outside of not importing terrorists and deporting illegals , which objectively makes them safer ( which city after , perhaps even before dc , would be the primary target if islamic terror takes place in the us , hmm ? 
  ) , how are they negatively affected by anything he does ? 
  why so much hate ? 
  they should start really investigating why they feel the way the do because they 're overreacting about everything . 
  nyc has committed to following the terms of paris agreement on its own if federal government does not , so they even get that . 
  the right is anti-rationalist and their beliefs can not be discussed because they believe in them dogmatically , say the same people . 
  right wingers are religious and christian for most part but it 's the leftists who are * really * strongly religious . 
  you see no testosterone , while i see the defeat of toxic masculinity . 
   lynching things said or done when obama was elected . 
  i think the difference there is that was mostly random people making comments like this on the internet , which is kind of to be expected , but i do n't remember famous people imitating obama being lynched or stuff like that , and it being published on the media as `` provocative art '' . 
  maybe i just did n't follow the news enough . 
  also few people speculated on prominent newspapers whether obama 's children were psychopathic , will turn out to be `` school shooters '' or are autistic like now with barron . 
  why does no one talk about tiffany ?

  europe getting invaded by muslims is not `` dumb '' . 
  it 's horrifying and it can only be countered by silly and cringy humor at this point . 
  did n't even bother reading after `` christian '' `` genocide '' . 
  did you forget the crusades already ? 
  we do it , too !, 
  yes , this guy totally deserves the darwin award . 
  we had to choose a company and do a presentation of their `` business culture '' in high school , everyone chose apple , google , facebook , spacex etc. 
  and went on on how great their `` corporate culture '' is and how awesome it is to work there . 
  i chose foxconn ... 
  is that a positive thing to you or do you mean more `` cut-throat competitive '' than the us , like , excess of capitalism ? 
  i live in a eu country with very few muslims ( ignore the flag ; but they 're not very observant in russia where i 'm from anyway ) . 
  never saw a single one in a regular supermarket as the supermarkets abandoned halal weeks after it first appeared there because of the massive public backlash about `` creeping and normalizing muslim culture '' , so they only go to halal momo businesses , have their own shops , restaurants etc. 
  wondering if they 'd move out if that was simply made illegal and banned . 
  how exactly do royal dynasties change , other than violent overthrow ? 
  is it possible to promote farage in royalty ? 
  lol, 
  he 's banned ? 
  like , you ca n't post his videos ? 
  or how is he banned ? 
  how does everyone know it ? 
  i only found out about it yesterday due to reddit , and now i suddenly see so many references to it !, 
  1945 will commence again !, 
  and laptops . 
  we need to ban laptops on all airlines . 
  it 's a laptop and electronics and large drink bottles problems , not anything else . 
   six imams removed from a us airways flight from minneapolis to phoenix are calling on muslims to boycott the airline . 
  if only we could get muslims to boycott all airlines , we could dispense with airport security altogether .
