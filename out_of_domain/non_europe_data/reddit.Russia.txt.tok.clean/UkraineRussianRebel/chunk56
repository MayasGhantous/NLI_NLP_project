  hillary clinton is reponsible for killing tens of thousands of libyans . 
  it 's less people than bush killed but it still makes her and obama a criminal and they should be prosecuted under the international court . 
  sadly , all the `` international '' organizations are just american puppets so we wo n't see an american president on trial , ever . 
  so you believe the russia conspiracy ? 
  really , trump needed `` de rushens '' to win the election , and being influenced by them is the reason people voted for him according to you ? 
   pretends everyone , or even the majority of people , coming to europe are syrians . 
  if it 's infinitely rapid then probably anything is dangerous at those speeds .

  but people are still supposed to vote for her ? 
  what is updog ? 
  is n't puerto rico basically mexico ? 
  i would n't let them in . 
  that 's fake news . 
  i do n't really understand why anyone should be proud of being a homosexual . 
  what is there to be proud of ? 
  it 's so weird that years ago this was something to be ashamed of , now you 're supposed be ashamed of being normal ( heterosexual ) ... 
  there is a safety issue . 
  homosexuals who support trump tend to be , despite their sexual orientation , cultural conservatives , realizing that their sexuality is an exception , not the norm , and not trying to force it upon other people in the form of gay marriage or gay adoption ( sorry for all the children who had the misfortune of being victims of this involuntarily ) , so the issue is that they mostly do n't care about changing culture but about not being killed by the actual `` homophobes '' ( muslim `` refugees '' and immigrants ) , like in orlando . 
  that 's why they support trump . 
   regarding transgender students, 
  no one is entitled to have everyone play along with their imaginary self-image . 
  no one wants boys in their daughters ' changing rooms and showers . 
  laws should not be made to accomodate a microscopic minority at the expense of vast majority . 
  like acknowledging that a bakery does have a right to refuse to make a cake for homosexual wedding because they disagree with gay marriage . 
  this kind of policies . 
   also not mentioned is his advocacy for conversion therapy . 
  this sounds medieval , like people being scared of antibiotics and vaccines . 
  maybe it would actually work if people did n't insist that homosexuality is normal and should not be cured , like anti-vaxxers are insisting that `` vaccines are unnatural '' so they should not be tried . 
  did you vote for trump or clinton ? 
  i will gladly become a non-black professor there and then get fired for $ 4.9 m. 
  also , can we deport muslims from historically non-muslim european countries to make them more european ? 
  i could n't care less if some degenerate thinks he is a girl and wears dresses , but no one should be forced to call them their `` preferred pronouns '' or [ allow them to use facilities for women ] ( http://www.thegetrealmom.com/blog/womensrestroom ) .

  even in north korea there are men and women . 
   loving homes, 
  definitely , they 're not missing the fact that a majority of people will grow up in normal families ( with both a mother and a father , not `` two mommies '' or `` two daddies '' ) and they will not at all , it 's totally ok and not child abuse . 
  did n't hear that for over half a decade . 
  accepting `` alternative sexualities '' ( not that homosexuality is especially harmful but it should n't be normalized ) is not in the realm of tolerance of disagreements . 
  it also leads to slippery slope , last time i heard liberals are big on the concept of `` pedophobia '' and pedophilia acceptance , western europe already has it .

  who says they 'd do it with a gun ? 
  is that why norway is stealing ( kidnapping ) indian , russian , romanian and polish children and putting them into homosexual families , to support this weird social experiment of what will happen with the children 's minds and perceptions ? 
  also it 's crazy anyone would think that the conclusions that homosexual `` families '' have no negative impact ( in the sense that children lose the sense of what a family and in general human life should look like ) are not politically motivated . 
   that is n't happening .

   norwegian child protection service barnevernet is known for taking children away for no reason for years at a time and there is one significant reason behind this : this is indeed a profitable business . 
  the norwegian government offered their services in 2008 for 1.2 billion krone ( approximately $ 144 million ) on the stock exchange market . 
  the discussions about the controversy of the state being allowed to make money out of children welfare arose significantly .

   in october 2014 , the barnevernet snatched the young son of a russian couple after the child told classmates that his mother had pulled out a loose tooth . 
   according to natalya and sergey shianok , their son oskar , who was five at the time , had told fellow kids at his school that his mother had accidently yanked out one of his baby teeth . 
  natalya explained that she was helping him to pull a t-shirt over his head and knocked out a tooth that was already loose .

   weeks passed with no answers about sunil 's disappearance , but the family remained determined to use every means possible to get his name and face out to as many people as possible . 
  it was n't until the days following the boston marathon bombing on april 15 that sunil 's name went viral , after users on twitter and reddit began suggesting sunil bore a strong similarity to one of the bombing suspects . 
  some even suggested sunil 's ethnicity pointed to a `` religiously motivated attack . '', 
  i think it 's because trump is a failed billionaire so maybe they ca n't afford more ?
