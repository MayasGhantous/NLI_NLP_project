  the perception that something * will * happen to you unless you submit is enough to enforce that . 
  they need , unfortunately , far less than a majority to change european culture and way of life , but yes , they do need a majority to codify it . 
  he was forced to tell that apparently . 
  in the meantime , i love trump 's hat !, 
  omitted is great [ in arabic ], 
  `` ivan , why are you reading the washington post ? 
  do n't you know it 's an enemy american newspaper ? 
  what good can you learn out of it ? '', 
  `` you know , boris , when i read the russian newspaper , all there is is another politician being convicted in a corruption case , the eu considering new sanctions and belarus smuggling polish apples over the russian border , but when i read american newspaper , i realize we are still a superpower : we decide who will be the next american president , our media like rt are influencing americans and telling them whom to vote for , and the cia will open investigation into any candidate we do n't like to ruin their chances of winning . 
  is n't it uplifting ? '', 
  # \\ #czechout, 
  eu is like that guy who has aids and decides to spread it on others so he does n't feel so bad about it . 
  `` i have invited millions of muslim terrorists into my country , now i want you to share the burden '' ( which no one even asked me to take but i did ), 
  was n't the guy who got shot a republican ? 
  then it 's offtopic for mods in r/redacted , it belongs to r/upliftingnews / s, 
  it actually works that way on all of reddit . 
  you first need to make some comments that fit the narrative to get karma so when you post something `` controversial '' it does n't go into total negative for the sub you 're posting in when you 're downvoted , then there 's no time limit . 
  yes . 
  basically if you post something and get , say , 600 upvotes ( and that 's your total karma on that sub ) , then you can get ~ 600 downvotes ( on that sub ) without time limit . 
   syringes in ball pits, 
  funny coincidence to see it on an askreddit comment , but just a few days back i happened to be at an exhibition dedicated to the history of police in my town , and there was a section about a special unit deployed to look for syringes in children 's playing places . 
  apparently that was a big issue in 1990s and there were photos of police with bags of syringes they collected during the day in sand pits on playgrounds . 
  they made a play with trump in the role of caesar . 
  maybe i 'm ignorant of history but was n't julius caesar actually a great leader who wanted to make rome great again ? 
  ny post was fairly pro-trump so this surprises me . 
  their criticism of the clintons was pretty fierce . 
  but then neocons from the national review also hate the clintons , they 're just a different political clan from the different side of `` the swamp '' , so that may have been the reason . 
  a lone wolf . 
  \\ #nothingtodowithnewyorkpost, 
  also , good housekeeping , christian science monitor , forbes , new scientist and national geographic haha . 
  but yes , i know op did n't make the infographic . 
  breitbart is responsible for the shooting . 
  if they were n't criticizing the left ( engaging in leftistophobia ) they would n't have radicalized that bernie supporter / s, 
  stop the radicalization !, 
  this is an example of police brutality against a bernie supporter . 
  this is what intolerance and incendiary rhetoric brings you trumpkins / s, 
  #anonymous officials familiar with the situation offer unassailable proof of collusion with russia , china , saudi arabia , india , bhutan and mexico . 
  do we have some journalism majors here ? 
  we need to make a definitive , authoritative study on the prevalence of fake news . 
  ms. clinton , can we please stop losing ? 
  we are tired of losing . 
  no , we will keep losing . 
  we will lose so much you wo n't believe , and you will beg me : can we stop losing ? 
  and i will say : no , we will continue losing . 
  very likely . 
  supposedly that 's why he 's been trying to eliminate , shun and assassinate some high-ranking government officials , including in his family , the `` deep state '' ( worker 's party bureaucrats , politburo officials , many generals etc ) may not be entirely satisfied with him . 
  and regarding no evidence , north korea is very closed but this is how one-party systems frequently operate : see the conspiracy around khruschev 's removal from power in the ussr when the communist party elites basically decided he 's inconvenient and he was forced to resign . 
  they disconnected his phone when he was on vacation and elected new government during the few weeks . 
  election denial is not a crime , but belief in it is generally regarded as being a crazy conspiracy theorist . 
  let 's make leftists look like crazy conspiracy theorists . 
  russia elected trump is now bush did 9/11 . 
  liberal arts colleges full of electoral college bigots !, 
  idk , but i think that person 's husband is a rapist . 
  i heard that on infowars.com, 
  [ ugandan tracking implant ] ( http://archive.is/po2tr ), 
  he 's a senior official in the department for police brutality and minority oppression ( according to blm ), 
  he did n't say black he said dark skinned , it could 've been a tan indian engineering student what do you know !, 
  yeah , just a few days ago i saw headlines where the us claimed they got him . 
  who knows . 
  he 's like bin laden , everyone claims they got him and some say he is * still * alive . 
  83 % of those 76 % are made up on the spot . 
  in soviet russia , it is 81 % , while in the us the average is 75 % , except for cnn , where this reaches 100 % , 100 % of the time . 
  [ marijuana is a bigoted word !, 
  ] ( http://www.thestranger.com/news/2016/04/13/23948555/the-word-marijuana-versus-the-word-cannabis ) it 's offensive !, 
  ( according to sjw ~ ~ marijuana ~ ~ cannabis , sorry , i meant * cannabis * users ), 
   `` the word ` marijuana ' or ` marihuana ' is an emotional , pejorative term that has played a key role in creating the negative stigma that still tragically clings to this holistic , herbal medicine , '' it reads . 
  `` most cannabis users recognize the 'm word ' as offensive , once they learn its history . 
  we prefer to use the word cannabis , because it is a respectful , scientific term that encompasses all the many different uses of the plant . '', 
   no matter how you slice it , the rise of the term marijuana is suspiciously contemporaneous with its popularity in racist screeds . 
  to that end , i 'm going to stop using the word `` marijuana '' in this column , except in proper names , quotations , or where it is part of the seemingly inseparable alliterative pairing `` medical marijuana '' ( after all , `` medical marijuana '' has specific regulatory policy attached to it ) . 
  yes , even this is offensive these days :(, 
  i used to be super anti-weed ( it 's a drug !, 
  that by definition makes it bad !, 
  ) , but these days as a non-drinker , non-smoker , non-stoner i still think it 's a drug and should n't be legalized but treating it like one would heroin or perviting seems crazy to me now . 
  edit : apparently plenty of weed smokers here, 
  i have been a conservative before i learned what the word `` politics '' even means . 
  it seems to be more of a mindset than a political persuasion . 
  almost all the kids in elementary school whom i regarded as weird and `` frivolous '' / `` rebellious '' grew up to be sjws or other kind of liberal , or some type of `` anarchist hippie '' , weird . 
  peace through a lack of islam = poland and finland . 
  it 's a return to the pure , literal form of islam . 
  this is right . 
  i never understood the preoccupation with how other people rule their country unless they 're a threat ( like north korea ) . 
  severing ties with cuba will hurt only the `` oppressed cubans '' , it 's not like castro will step down because there will be less american tourists . 
  and cuba can hardly be perceived as a threat to anyone , plus they get tons of tourists from basically everywhere , especially europe ... if anything russia is reopening a military base there soon , so you 're right china will come next probably . 
  i 'm russian but from american point of view it does n't make much sense to be hostile with cuba imho . 
   ` strategic patience ', 
  how is cuba a threat to america or anyone really ? 
  all gone :'(, 
  theoretical idea of communism does n't sound that great to me , either . 
  common ownership of everything ( means of production ) seems very restrictive and inefficient . 
  you were only allowed to own one car in the ussr because if you had more than one it was no longer personal property ( legal ) but private property ( illegal ) and you could potentially turn into a capitalist by using the other car as means of production ( taxi service , delivery service etc. ), 
  there is a communist party usa . 
  they supported hillary clinton . 
  do they at least get to be real americans or does that put them into the category of russians ? 
  ironically , the republic will not survive if they keep believing they can retrospectively abolish the election results because they do n't like them . 
  seeing dems crying on tv after being fired is so funny !, 
  just in `` castro '' castreau, 
  little havann * aaaa *, 
  lmao, 
   fascism has no place in america , but the `` democratic '' left has embraced it,
