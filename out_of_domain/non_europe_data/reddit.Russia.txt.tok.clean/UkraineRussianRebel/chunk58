  we really need to bash some fash . 
  but we need to do it * legally * and * peacefully * . 
  we will be facing a twitter riot . 
  i live in one of the former eastern bloc countries now in the eu . 
  while having been member of that had no economic upsides whatsoever and people rightfully disliked the system , in retrospect , most realize and notice one thing : them being a part of former eastern bloc and having communism , ironically , while being terrible for economy ( central planning just does n't work ) insulated them from ideologies of liberalism and multiculturalism , while allowing them to preserve their culture : communism and marxism was imposed on top of national cultures , they essentially existed in parallel despite certain aspects of national cultures being repressed ( you could n't write novel about anything you wanted - censorship , for example ) , rather than inside of them , supplanting their values and redefining them , as it happened in for example germany ( the country does n't exist to be a home for germans , but serve everyone except for them ) . 
  so the west had normal economic development and reached unprecedented heights there , while the east got to preserve their national identities . 
  is n't it crazy ? 
  germany used to invade people to settle their captured territories with germans , now they 'd invade countries to settle them with muslims . 
  which one is the safest ? 
  monaco , andorra , so micro-country like that ? 
   hitler later on realized his mistake ,, 
  how ? 
  you mean that he got defeated or he actually realized some mistake before that ? 
  obligatory `` those who do know history will be watching is despair as others are repeating it '', 
  was she shocked or just surprised ? 
  you will not bribe me with an upvote !,

  the only useful thing to keep is the security council . 
  but then everyone ignores its decisions when it does n't suit their interests , usa , russia , china , do anything they want , france and the uk always vote as the us doies . 
  un is useless in general . 
  any decent country has a constitutional provision that national law takes primacy over international , so that makes the un powerless . 
  he does behave like some ak-47 wielding rebel in uganda or eritrea would talk . 
  indeed , he would fit into `` africa '' more than `` america '' . 
  time to recolonize minnessota . 
  but [ trump is mafia ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wgswzutzsqk/maxresdefault.jpg ) !, 
   and even hillary . 
  kek, 
  i started reading the art of the deal today . 
  yes , we 're the [ no-no-no-no-no ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qniuh4fpgs ) subreddit . 
  terrorism has nothing to do with islam but criticizing islam will turn muslims into terrorists . 
  it 's still not because of islam , they attack you to * defend the honorable name of islam * . 
  what scares me the most is that we might cease to be an open society . 
  you know , we did so much progress , we are almost close to normalizing pedophilia , and now these conservatives come with their walls and barbed wires and anti-terrorism , really , drumpf and his supporters are so terrifying . 
  islamophilia is irrational . 
  ~ ~ violence ~ ~ talking about violence breeds more violence !, 
   everything is meaningless below that . 
  allah defies your [ stupid science and what you think is impossible ] ( https://youtu.be/ijahw7_tvqq?t=22s ) !, 
  but then also thomas mann , albert einstein and winston churchill supported pan-europe . 
  have you read/found the book ? 
  this is one problem with the calergi theory : i have heard about the sinister aspects of pan-europa but the only quotes purporting his plans originate from this book which is n't available anywhere , and in general biographies and statements you ca n't really find a proof he wanted more than to create a european union , so i do n't know , do n't want to dismiss that as a conspiracy theory , but possibly it 's today 's leaders in europe going crazy , rather than the original ideas . 
  what 's wrong with colonialism ? 
  it made the world more stable . 
  no wars in africa , all africans nicely living under european control without any access to weapons , could n't genocideize each other . 
  those are n't a part of political correctness but just basic decency . 
  also were the terms really that offensive before they were declared offensive ? 
  i mean , not that long ago , african americans referred to themselves as * negro * , now no one does that anymore . 
  are they yelling `` christ is great '' , have massive support networks all over the world , starting wars and overthrowing governments in multiple countries ? 
  stop equating christians with muslims . 
  it 's disgusting towards those christians in syria , iraq , egypt and general north africa , the philippines getting slaughtered by muslims , and then those muslims being offered `` refuge '' in europe as if they were victims of anything . 
  also most of those `` christian terrorists '' have mental issues , while most muslims terrorists are perfectly sane , they just have a violent ideology of hate . 
  instincts and intuition . 
  i went to school with a daughter of a future president . 
  ended up voting for her dad . 
  planning to vote for him once more next year . 
  ( wo n't say the country though because then it 'd be very easy to find the school and stuff in general ), 
  ** muslim commits a terror attack : ** not all muslims are terrorists !, 
  islam is peaceful people are just using islam to excuse their acts of terrorism , we should not tell muslims to denounce it , vast majority are not like that !, 
  the main thing to do now is not to be prejudiced and criticize islam !, 
  \\ #notallmuslims \\ #religionofpeace !!!, 
  ** a british person commits a terror attack : ** omg when will we finally acknowledge that all british people are evil islamophic terrorism sympathizers , they should apologize and be held accountable !, 
  this is the result of british/western/european culture !, 
  how about some * british men ban * ?!, 
  have you noticed that in fact most brits do n't support the finsbury park terrorist and do n't follow his ideology , and all sane people do n't think this is a good way to fight muslims/muslim terrorism ? 
  it 's not your ethnicity but your beliefs that make you act . 
  most brits and europeans are not neo-nazis , therefore we do not have to apologize or be held accountable for an act of such a radical , unless we share his ideology , then we have a duty to explain it . 
  i am russian , but do n't have to apologize for bolshevism or stalinism , since i am neither a bolshevik nor a stalinist . 
  but if i were , the burden of justifying why i believe in these ideologies would be on me . 
  but i am sure that most muslims do in fact believe in islam and its tenets . 
  therefore they have an explanation to do about islamic terrorism . 
  you ** can ** give up islam like you can give up any other political ideology if you do n't want to be associated with it . 
   crusades were the islamophobic wars, 
  -- my college prof, 
  go on twitter , search \\ #finsburypark hashtag . 
  this may be the new ca n't stump the trump since he does n't make videos anymore . 
  i started reading the art of the deal yesterday . 
  already feel a bit stumped . 
   as for those among you who do have the genes , who do have the instincts , and who could be highly successful , well , i still hope you wo n't follow my advice . 
  because that would just make it a much tougher world for me . 
  manchester was already way too high , but if you 're a tolerant liberal you can still point to a muslim who did n't commit and act of terror and say : see , he 's not a terrorist , there 's nothing to be afraid of here , it 's just lone wolves !, 
   to detroit, 
  maybe i 'm stereotyping but is n't detroit already bad enough ? 
  1,400 per day is more than 65,000 per year . 
   inva ... immigrate, 
  vicious snake, 
  i want that t-shirt . 
   she is threatening kill me unless i move back in, 
  do n't move back in , it 's a trap !, 
  there is anti the_donald graffiti . 
  not anti-trump , but anti r/the _ donald . 
  these people are really triggered . 
  i vote democrat because i believe that no gynecologist is illegal and all should have a chance , we need to have amnesty for all illegal , undocumented gynecology practices . 
  it 's eu headquarters . 
  eu needs to do a better job being less islamophobic . 
  how about importing a syrian village to brussels ? 
  #the eu should stop being so islamophobic, 
  #then no one would target brussels, 
  #when will they learn ? 
  rebuild the iron curtain . 
  build the berlin-wall style barrier with guards and electricity along germany 's eastern border .
