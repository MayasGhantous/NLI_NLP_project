  btw i hope you 're a woman , that would 've been even funnier . 
  #did you just assume that * zhis * is [ idk which possessive pronoun to use ] preferred pronoun ? 
  wait why did they delete the `` 50k strong anti-government march in moscow '' thing ? 
  i mean , liberals over at r/europe are n't particularly fond of russia and putin . 
  of course , there was no 50k strong anti-government march today , but still . 
  [ #islammisunderstood ] ( https://twitter.com/lsarsour/status/719301817771892737 ), 
  okay guys , this one might be a coincidence but there 's more , i do n't think you can just brush this off like that, 
  let 's give bernie a coat . 
  #but he must disavow bernie !!, 
  my vietnamese friend was regularly wondering `` why those chinese people speak russian '' ( kazakhs ) and could n't wrap her head around a [ mongolian from russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalmyks ) because `` why would a mongol be from russia . '', 
  me being from siberia but indigenous siberians `` looking like japanese '' did n't make much sense to her , either . 
  who cares about perception in moscow , beijing and tokyo . 
  it 's cnn 's ability to influence perception in pyongyang and baghdad that could really hurt him !, 
   what if those people do n't vote for him in the next election ? 
  [ spicy ] ( https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/802972944532209664 ), 
  it 's crazy , but trump is the `` sick , vulgar , offensive '' one . 
  like how does anyone think this could be in any circumstances acceptable ? 
  no verified account , either . 
  i 'd never think i 'd be ever watching press briefings with such an interest, 
  i want a pepe too reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, 
  it does n't .

  ca n't really test it on a frontpage post as dozens of people upvote in the meantime , but it can be seen on a small post . 
   there is no political agenda pushed in the class, 
  proceeds to push political agenda, 
  curious where and which year is that . 
  early 90s ? 
  weird . 
  my other posts and some comments do n't show up . 
  weird some of my comments do n't show up . 
  yeah , while their `` right '' ( merkel ) just wants to import more muslims , german leftists want to give them a birthright citizenship . 
  it 's kelly no more kerry, 
  pick one, 
  based [ ice ] ( https://www.mwrbrandcentral.com/images/uploads/icelogo.png ) officers . 
  i am dreaming that one day , america and europe will be enforcing their immigration laws again . 
  yeah , he did n't even mention americans are lazy and forgot to apologize for pearl harbor to japan . 
  `` we are a country that builds bridges , not walls . 
  due to how close we were to electing a * fa *** c *** ist * drumpf , all ~ ~ illegals ~ ~ undocumenteds are citizens effective immediately !!! '', 
  ... and the chinese will come , look at the wall , and say , astnohished `` now that 's a wall '', 
  that 's what r/ets thinks putin is doing . 
  neither do i. i think we are cultured enough to not behave like the brigaders do , but also our sub is ( was ? ), 
  under pressure from reddit admins ( would we have reminders like the stickied post in this thread otherwise ? ), 
  which also adds to our good behavior . 
  if we brigade , the entire sub is banned . 
  they 'd be waiting for opportunity . 
  did he already speak ? 
  or not yet ? 
  i just came in here . 
  leftists really like words like orwellian , dystopian , scary , troubling , problematic , junta ( = trump appointed three generals to security and military related positions ) . 
  but if her ethnicity is mexican ( if that 's an ethnicity , sure they have many ethnicities within mexico ) , they still can call themselves mexican american ? 
  kind of like there 's jewish americans , russian americans , german americans etc. 
  by ancestry even if they 're just americans without dual citizenship . 
  i saw the headlines that `` 1984 is a 2017 must-read '' because of the `` parallels '' , did n't read it ( the article ) though . 
  i think today 's world , at least outside of places like north korea , is for most part so removed from the `` 1984 '' picture that you could look for any parallels you want -- and find them -- but they wo n't be any actual parallels , just something they want to see , an extreme exaggeration . 
  with the `` alternative facts '' quote they 're acting as though they did n't apply `` post-truth '' to clinton 's administration , and curiously they never looked for `` orwellianism '' in the justifications for the war in iraq etc. 
  regardless , this map explains very well what happened afterwards , after yanukovich was overthrown . 
  it 's not from the 2010 election , it 's from 2004 , but in the other years the votes distribution was similar . 
  i 've been to / pol a few times and yes , it 's in part the technical side of it . 
  4chan is very confusing ( for me ) . 
  also , little feedback ( no upvotes , no usernames , you do n't know when someone replies and so on ) , and posts disappearing almost immediately . 
  but ... what about ciudad juarez ? 
  been to / pol and found it quite funny , it really is `` politically incorrect '' , i guess plenty of liberals would get unironically triggered and horrified , but yeah , plenty of crazy conspiracy theories , but i am convinced most of the people are n't really all that serious . 
  ironically , i noticed , while complaining about leftists buzzwords , we have a penchant for calling people totalitarian communists way too quickly . 
  enjoy, 
   by recognizing whole words, 
  why would you even need that ? 
  i remember that in grade school ( this was not in america ) we learned letters , then reading . 
  recognizing words as a method of reading seems like learning pictograms to me . 
  considering that the 1990 nationality act dropped the requirement to learn english for naturalization ... 
  china is not `` communist '' . 
  they only have a party which calls itself communist in charge , but they have fully transitioned to market economy . 
  it 's a regular market economy country , just with one party government . 
   i felt like i had escaped from an al qaeda terrorist camp, 
  from twitter responses :, 
  liberal head just exploded . 
  is netanyahu alt-right ? 
  is he not jewish ? 
  does that mean that netanyahu is anti-semitic , or that trump supporters are not anti-semitic ? 
  is netanyahu a nazi supporter ? 
  it 's like those `` yeah so he builds a wall , but they will just dig a tunnel under it ! '', 
  `` there 's a concrete foundation , so it 's unlikely they 'll dig so deep '', 
  `` have you heard about ladders ? '', 
  `` the wall is going to be too tall for most ladders '', 
  `` whatever , most of them fly in and overstay visas anyway '', 
  `` that 's why there 's the extreme vetting thing '', 
  `` but that 's discrimination ! '', 
  why , just how , do you get -51 on this comment on r/the _ donald ? 
  i agree . 
  it definitely is . 
  just found the downvotes interesting . 
  a top post with 0 upvotes . 
  we did it again !, 
  most of the sub . 
  ( surely no one will downvote america , right ? ), 
  undocumented tenants . 
  hello ,, 
  can i get some downvotes please ? 
  thank you, 
  but was it stickied when it was being downvoted ?
