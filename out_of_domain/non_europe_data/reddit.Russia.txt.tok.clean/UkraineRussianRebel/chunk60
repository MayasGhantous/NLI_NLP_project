  they now know they can dream big and their dreams are not limited by their gender , and they can be elected to congress and achieve anything else they want in their life . 
  i certainly am . 
  this is a great day for all girls in america . 
  they now know they can dream big and their dreams are not be limited by their gender . 
  only 99.5 % of precincts are counted , it 's not 100 % , he can still pull it off . 
  any refunds ? 
  chill everyone , all votes are n't even counted yet . 
  why do we call pro-trump posters on here trolls if they 're being completely serious ? 
  i could n't handle the sexism myself . 
  glad to see i 'm not alone . 
  finally , republicans are leading the progress towards gender equality , like republicans ended slavery despite democrat protests .

  i am a little russian troll trolling on r/politics lalalala, 
  just 99.5 % of the votes are counted , ossoff can still win . 
  yes !, 
  drumpf just ca n't keep getting away with this !, 
  ossoff we have your emails !, 
  i think we are winning california in 2020 . 
  i might as wll move to russia if canada does n't take me , america is turning into a russian colony under trump anyway . 
  17 intelligence agencies came to a conclusion that the 2016 election was hacked . 
  hillary clinton won the popular vote but was denied the presidency . 
  russian intelligence hacked her emails and then gave them to wikileaks . 
  this is all very serious . 
  the british secret services dossier on trump published on buzzfeed . 
  exactly . 
  you 're not that far from truth , it 's a historical fact . 
  i think they need to be looked at from a different perspective . 
   even before american independence , russia under its great monarch , catherine the great , defied britain by trading directly with the american colonies , in violation of the mercantile system britain then imposed . 
  during the american war of independence , russia -- which had been an ally of britain 's -- refused british requests of military aid , choosing instead to finance the colonies through continued trade , to keep sea lanes open for navigation and to use its diplomatic leverage to help the colonies obtain a favourable peace . 
  it does n't matter . 
  drumpf is done . 
  it 's over for him . 
  he 'll be impeached any day now . 
  he will live the rest of his life in exile in russia . 
  mueller is coming . 
  he is not my president . 
  seth rich a conspiracy theory invented by alex jones . 
  it 's a vast right wing conspiracy because sexists did n't want hillary to be president . 
  i have a phd in trumpology , glad to see a fellow scholar . 
  just got banned from r/redacted for this a minute ago lmao, 
  yes , it is from the georgia election thread yesterday . 
  i ca n't tell if the original poster was a pede troll or a real redacter though . 
  this is one of the responses i got yesterday to posting about 17 intelligence agencies and buzzfeed trump dossier , it explains the state of r/redacted perfectly : https://i.redd.it/lw1h6qh2405z.jpg, 
  they were economic leftists ( like fascists ) but extreme nationalists and socially conservative , which is are right-wing tenets . 
  it 's difficult to classify fascism or nazism as right or left purely , hence the `` horseshoe theorem '' . 
  personally i still think the extreme nationalism was the most defining aspect , while for bolshevism it was collective ownership and total domination of state , so i 'd say the extreme left/extreme right still stands . 
  but the fact is that even hitler and mussolini rejected those labels , they called it a completely new `` social paradigm '' which is neither left nor right . 
  germany used to threaten countries if they do n't provide lebensraum for germans , now they 're threatening them if they do n't provide lebensraum for muslims . 
  this is ridiculous . 
  i 'd never think i 'd have more respect for nazi germany than for contemporary germany but even being russian , it 's happening . 
  i right now literally respect hitler more than i do merkel because while hitler was a brutal genocidal monster , he was at least advancing his nation 's interest , merkel is doing self-genocide while also genociding other europeans . 
   o_o whut ? 
  some people seriously never bothered to find out what the acronym nsdap stands for . 
  i read it as `` we are through the russians '' , missing the dot , the first time . 
  what ? 
  haha, 
  does this mean the a right-wing dictatorship can not exist by definition ? 
  but why are then nazis against bolsheviks , should n't they be allied ? 
  and i do n't mean the pragmatic `` non-aggression pact '' but actual political alliance . 
  happy ramadan !, 
  let 's honor our heroes who landed in normandy !, 
   conservative values we would embrace here in the usa . 
  american `` conservative values '' - of most `` republican principled ^ tm conservatives '' these days are pretty much limited to low taxes , low government spending , no public healthcare and a nebulous concept of `` small government '' . 
  or as patrick buchanan calls it the `` think-tank conservatism '' . 
  the conservatism i was talking about is more * national conservatism * , social ( family values etc. ), 
  and national ( traditions , heritage ) values rather than purely economic values of establishment conservatives ( all i care about is `` low taxes '' but millions of illegals and open borders are totally fine kind of thinking ), 
  this excerpt from * [ the battle for france ] ( http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-battle-for-france-french-elections-eric-zemmour/ ) * describes what i mean almost perfectly :, 
   but today , france 's most read and most discussed popular writers -- novelists and political essayists -- are conservatives of one stripe or another . 
  *** they are not concerned , even slightly , with the issues that animate american `` mainstream '' think-tank conservatism -- lowering taxes , cutting federal programs , or maintaining some kind of global military hegemony . 
  their focus is france 's national culture and its survival . 
  when they raise , as they do , the subjects embraced by american paleoconservatives and the so-called alt-right *** , that does n't mean the french debate has been taken over by extremists . 
  the authors driving the french conversation are in almost every instance prominent figures whose views would have put them in the gaullist middle or somewhat left of center at any time in the 1960s or \u201970s . 
  but france has changed , and what national review in the 1990s called `` the national question '' has been brought to the very heart of the country 's national debate . 
   all the time, 
  i live in europe and once saw a guy in a red hat on subway and thought `` haha it 'd be funny if it was a maga hat '' . 
  no way , it was actually a maga hat . 
  cnn is making me suffer every day . 
  my eyes are literally bloodshot and red from all the crying . 
  if he 's latino he may be literally pinochet . 
  in that case , we may make him remover-in-chief of the_donald . 
  is that a gender studies degree loan ad ? 
  lmao, 
  it 's over for him . 
  impeached any day now . 
  he will spend the rest of his life in exile in russia . 
  deal with it . 
  putin will not save him this time . 
  drumpf is not my president !!!!, 
  i think he 's possibly not a cuck but trolling cucks . 
  covfefe = coverage, 
  resist coverage, 
  they do n't want fair ( press ) coverage of what trump is doing because that would make attacking him and us harder . 
  i 'm with her, 
  i mean karen handel, 
  stop saying ~ ~ woke ~ ~ texas !, 
  is he actually campaigning for 2020 ? 
  i read that hillary won the county he 's going to be in . 
  it 's 2 am,
