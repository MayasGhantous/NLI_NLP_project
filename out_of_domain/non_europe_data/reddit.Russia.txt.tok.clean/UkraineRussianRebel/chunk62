  no it was a hologram . 
  no it never happened at all . 
  but the jews did it . 
  fish-eye lenses are a conspiracy to push the round earth . 
  gravity is a theory too . 
  i am a t_d poster and never saw these two there . 
  but it 's undeniable that there * is * some conspiracy , we just do n't know which one yet . 
  unless you 're trolling , i live in europe and my american english teacher in high school did n't believe me when i told her i saw african americans ( tourists ) with a confederate flag on their backpacks . 
  edit : apparently you 're a troll but a good one, 
   european bastardization, 
  the entire `` social justice warriorship '' , `` critical feminism theory '' and other positive discrimination and `` privilegeism '' thing was invented in america and has spread to europe from there . 
  that 's one thing you just ca n't blame europeans for , sorry . 
  the classical critical theory was indeed invented by frankfurt school in europe but american universities and `` scholars '' have made that into an influential , worldwide thing that is increasingly spilling into other western countries . 
   every person can be guilty of the same thing . 
  i disagree . 
  non-muslims ca n't be terrorist . 
  terrorism is defined as violence plus islam and requires a historical control of terrorist organizations , institutions of quranic power and oppression against kaffirts . 
  true but us universities made it popular . 
  they have been leading the `` social justice '' and `` inclusion '' efforts since 1960s , the `` sexual liberalition '' and `` cultural '' revolution originated among the us youth , and inspired the 1968 movement in europe . 
  europe was looking to young us generations at the time as an example and an ideal . 
  i mean , ok , it 's just stupid to blame each other for the problems both areas are facing now . 
  it 's just annoying how `` blame europe for everything ! '', 
  seems to be the default thing to do for many . 
  maybe she thinks that she inferior and that 's why she ca n't be hateful and discriminatory even when she is ? 
  well , that just falls into their `` perpetual victim '' view of themselves . 
  i am not a cuck and therefore i did not ingore this . 
  in a chinese restaurant ( owned by a chinese family ) in my neighborhood there is a blonde ukrainian girl working there and she wears traditional chinese clothes and uses chopsticks . 
  should i report them to @metpoliceuk for being accomplices in the thoughtcrime of cultural appropriation ? 
  i mean , i like the restaurant and do n't want them to close down but i am afraid that my social justice duty of remedying historical oppression is more important !, 
   you did n't build that !, 
  i like it how he used that to imply that `` the government '' made the internet and the roads and everyone should thus be incredibly grateful , as if `` the government '' did that for free out of compassion and not because it is a common effort at building infrastructure paid from taxes . 
  right , but russia should have done the right thing ^ tm and shilled for hillary . 
  kind of like all the undecided voters who should n't have voted for trump because voting for the madame president is the only moral decision that does n't make you an immoral unacceptable fascist !, 
  my comment about buzzfeed dossier and 17 intelligence agencies was heavily upvoted on r/redacted . 
  not sure if it was pede trolls upvoting though lol . 
  disclaimer : [ possibly absolutely fake ] ( http://www.hoax-slayer.com/images/london-muslim-protest-1.jpg ), 
  no no , this is fake news , she 's a clean-shaven british man / s, 
  obama , get off my lawn . 
  elon `` feels guy '' musk lol, 
  i was about to object but then i saw you specified it 's * western * europe , not just europe . 
  the east/center needs to reject the eu refugee quotas , where will we put all the western european refugees running away from the caliphate if we make caliphate on our own territory ? 
  you see downfall , all i see is beautiful diversity . 
  ** i will continue saying it and i wo n't stop saying , folks **, 
  #france is no longer france, 
  no , the antifa guy is privileged , he 's not black , police only ever shoots black people . 
  let 's distribute this video with that narrative to cause antifa and blm destroy each other . 
  the eu needs to be stomped out and be forgotten . 
  i hope macaroni and merkel will be there alone soon . 
  scary, 
  the social justice , leftism and liberalism is even more extreme in america than in europe among leftists ( they 're not physically taking over universities and forcing out people they do n't like without being expelled yet here ) but the 1a and 2a does n't allow them to take over the country and establish penalties for `` offensive speech '' and `` intolerance '' as they 're doing in europe . 
  we had literally hundreds of years to adopt something like 1a into european countries ' constitutions but no one has ever done that . 
  even after ww2 they opted for `` constitutions of tolerance '' . 
  pathetic . 
  what i just do n't get is how can one be a president of , say , evergreen college or lead a department of a prestigious , world-famous university like harvard/yale and let themselves be yelled at by thugs and kids offended by halloween constumes . 
  this is just one aspect i do n't understand at all . 
  it would just feel so weird and out of place to stand up during a class and just start yelling that plato is offensive like students in some american/british universities do . 
  but it seems to have become acceptable for the professors there . 
  wtf . 
  how are they not expelled ? 
   i would work for 10 years, 
  failing cnn would n't last that long . 
  the framers put it there so they could shoot at their slaves . 
  apparently mexico needs the the wall as much as the us does . 
  my skin is too pale for me to get raped . 
  my privilege protects me from that . 
  however , i feel slighted a little bit . 
  i 've never heard about the privilege card she 's talking about . 
  where can i get it ? 
  yes . 
  i think we could name it the firing line !, 
  two muslims and a truck ... 
  i find it `` sweet '' he 's acknowledging the victims of the holy month of bombathan . 
  trump 's statement is as `` uncucked '' as it gets without crossing the line of `` generally accepted decency '' and calling islam a violent ideology it is . 
  but this way it 's actually * more * powerful , because there 's the implication rather than just bluntness . 
  obama should have ended his letter with `` allahu akbar ! '', 
  it 's about dedication , work and education . 
  these cultures are known for their work ethnic and valuing education , especially israeli ( jewish ) and indians , in this list . 
  if you drop out of school you ca n't expect to be as successful as those who worked their way , but those who failed are trying to find some `` privilege '' they do n't have to justify themselves . 
  so this is where the phrase `` uppity negro '' originates from ? 
  also , ptsd , depression , oppression , genocide , ethnic cleansing , violence , `` feeling unsafe '' , these words have come to mean nothing when they 're using them . 
  they 're just randomly throwing `` very serious '' words around to try to give weight to their petty , imaginary non-issues . 
  that programs their students to hate themselves and their country , culture , roots and even their family and frieds from which they need to separate themselves if they happen to be ideologically impure . 
  how many online now are actually americans ? 
  it 's around noon in most of europe but night ( early morning ) in most of america . 
  you know who else hated jewish gays ? 
  on a serious note , wtf is wrong with these people . 
  so star of david makes them feel unsafe but palestinian muslims terrorizing israel and jews are making them feel safer ? 
  not all `` liberation movements '' are about `` freedom and tolerance '' as liberals tend to apparently believe . 
  plo certainly is not . 
  i like that you did n't put islamophobic in there . 
  i 'm a proud islamophobe . 
  it 's actually better without the * let 's *, 
  che wing soap, 
   the whole village came out to watch these three people be hung, 
  pretty medieval . 
  are you a muslim ? 
  if not then your equating of the west with islam is pretty naive . 
  if you are then you 're engaging in a taqiyya , trying to portray islam as peaceful and tolerant so westerners can let their guard down . 
  uae is not an `` asian '' country . 
  the natives are arabs , one usually does not associate oneself with people of different ethnicities/cultures/nationalities solely because they live on the same continent .
