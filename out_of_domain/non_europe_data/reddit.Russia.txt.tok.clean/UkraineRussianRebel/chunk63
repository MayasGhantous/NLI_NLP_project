  like for example british and norwegians are not the same people even though they both live in europe . 
  so i think the same logic operates there . 
  i 'm russian . 
  i know that the british refer to indians , pakistanis etc. 
  as asian , what i meant is that people in uae probably do n't consider themselves asian , even though the country is formally a part of asia . 
  national review still going about `` trump being russia 's biggest asset '' , not because the election was hacked ( it was n't ) , but because he 's `` disorganized and ignorant '' . 
  but he should still pretend the election hacking took place because it would be `` too embarrassing for america just to admit it was made up now '' . 
  i was in tears over the georgia 6th district election . 
  my eyes were literally red and bloodshot from all the crying . 
  i was so happy . 
  karen handel winning allows all girls in america to dream big and know that nothing is beyond their reach if they try , that they 're deserving of every opportunity there is . 
  did n't even think about it this way before . 
  makes sense . 
  democrats and liberals have this idea of turning texas blue as a great symbolic victory that will make their `` march '' irreversible . 
  russia is [ pro-trump ] ( http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/russians-drink-champagne-celebrate-trump-inauguration-article-1.2951674 ) , most russians hate hillary because she was explicit about being [ more hostile to russia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id5enp6dtek ) , trying to attack our military in syria , accusing us of supporting [ `` extreme nationalism in europe '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpvg2djthg4 ) ( of course meaning patriotic people like farage and le pen ) and also the fact how she [ reacted to the news of gaddaffi getting killed ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmiryvjqehm ) , like a crazy psychopath . 
  trump was roughly the exact opposite of hillary and the democrats . 
  the general belief is that america will not be seeking conflict with russia under trump ( `` we will get along with everyone vs. bring them to heel '' ) unlike under obama , which so far is true . 
   we are building our military back up, 
  the `` military buildup '' is n't really [ all that thrilling ] ( http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/12/23/putin-dismisses-trump-nuclear-plans/ ) , rather who is in charge of that military is seen as important . 
  also there is a cultural factor : republicans are conservative so additional thing is that unlike democrats they 're not trying to force `` progressive liberal '' culture on other countries . 
  what i am disputing as nonsense is that we somehow caused trump to be elected . 
  source : i 'm russian, 
  who is us ambassador to estonia and why does he still have a job ? 
  estonia was a part of the ussr . 
  this ideology is being forced on them * now * , not in the postwar time . 
  that must feel even worse : okay , so you 're now not a part of the ussr anymore , here , take some refugees and third world migrants so you 'll have diversity and can be a part of the * good , tolerant , european society * !, 
  the comment, 
   when did you last have a black person in your home ? 
  lol , like that is some kind of an obligation and unless you find a random black person to invite to your home you 're a hateful bigot !, 
  when did she last have a mormon or hassidic person in her home ? 
  on the other hand , it would be more scary knowing that every muslim/african gangster can just a get a gun without significant obstacles if europe had 2a . 
  what i mean is that a gun wo n't save you against a terror attack ( bomb , truck , ak-47 shooting ) but every petty criminal being able to become immensely more powerful by getting a firearm as opposed to a knife does n't really sound all that great either . 
  edit : i was specifically talking about europe , not taking away 2a from americans lol, 
  is it unacceptable ? 
  is the c-word `` cracker '' ? 
  i just always imagine [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/saltine-crackers.jpg ) . 
  `` is that how you treat other cultures here in germany , with such a lack of tolerance and understanding ? 
  you know , this is a part of my culture . 
  she should have been wearing a hijab and not be outside alone . 
  i find it absolutely unacceptable that you 're telling me this is a wrong thing to do . '', 
  unlikely . 
  most people will be running away in panic rather than trying to aim at a guy with ak-47 in a crowded place like bataclan or a hypothetical subway station . 
  gun will not stop a bomb explosion or a truck either . 
  if one has a professional training ( and is able to stay calm and `` fight back '' ) like police or military then it 's possible , otherwise , i do n't think so . 
  they 're not . 
  it 's patronizing , sexist and patriarchal , an intersectional oppressive system devised by intolerant western societies to marginalize women and deny them their perception of financial independence . 
  nothing similar exists in progressive societies and social systems like islam , so i think this idea that `` men need to pay '' must be abolished . 
  voted for hillary , hence giving her the popular vote . 
  your media is fake news and your diversity is a conspiracy by liberals because immigrants vote always democrat , the only reason why hillary clinton won the popular vote is because california is full of illegals and cucks , but mostly cucks . 
  found the triggered sjw . 
  the money he spent on his presidential campaign . 
  i shoot them guns . 
  because they want to get into the us illegally . 
  russians made it appear like they colluded with trump so they create an internal conflict in the us and decrease trust in the president and the cabinet . 
  in fact , they colluded with hillary clinton as well but she lost , then the same scenario would have been taking place with clinton .

   it would be like dropping crates of rpg 's into the favelas in rio . 
  this was exactly my point . 
  and also it 's not like americans do n't have these problems ( enough to look at the various sprawling ghettos ) , which is part of the reason why every decent person needs a gun : every thug already has it . 
  wow , you 're a bigot if you think all republicans are like that !, 
  also i hate poor people because i ca n't make profit off them ( i work in banking and stock trading ) but they take welfare and want tax increases and are a general nuisance . 
  i am a free market socially conservative libertartarian minarchist and believe that there should be no taxation at all , the only function of the state is to provide military and police force . 
  i do n't like gays because i believe in traditional forms of life , a traditional natural heterosexual family composed of man , woman and children ( in that order ) , which is a guarantor of social peace and stability , not sexual degeneracies . 
  i strongly oppose feminism , social liberalism , immigration . 
  also gays have aids . 
  this really struck so i will mention this one first even though it 's last :, 
   implement suppressive voting laws, 
  voter id is not suppressive at all and vast majority of countires around the world do have it , us is a very rare exception . 
  is most of europe `` oppressive '' ? 
  no , and virtually everywhere you need an id . 
   but do prevent the poor and people of color from voting . 
  are `` poor people '' and `` people of color '' too stupid or incapable of getting an id ? 
  vast majority , over 90 % , already have it . 
  the remaining ones can get it too . 
   scores of academic studies, 
  liberal trump hating professors using their position of `` authority '' to make claims that there was no voter fraud , got it !, 
   but now says he will never publish his proof . 
  it would be `` casting pearls before the swine '' - cnn would say it 's fake anyway !, 
   i prefer to base my opinions on facts, 
  those so-called facts have origins rooted in fake news . 
   this study , this study , this study , this study , this study, 
  one of those studies says that `` no photo id is needed '' . 
  how would they know there is no voter fraud if they oppose the means that would allow to identify voter fraud ? 
  fishy !, 
   there is no in-person voter fraud in this country . 
  that 's a very categorical statement . 
  very partisan . 
  i work for gru . 
  i found [ this one ] ( https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/802972944532209664?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw ) . 
  it 's city-dwelling liberals who do n't want kids and stay `` childfree '' to pursue `` career attainment '' and living life `` for themselves , not for others '' , we republicans , christians and conservatives breed a lot . 
  which is why they want to import illegals and muslims : who will be voting democrat if liberals do n't have any children ? 
  there are plenty of people from all over the world on t_d , not just americans . 
  that 's why we have flairs for pretty much every country . 
   and if i am wrong , prove it . 
  tell me about the local restaurants and stores in your town that only people who live around you would know . 
  but when you can google anything in an instant how does that prove anything ? 
  i could google some obscure restaurant in fort worth or rome and say i am form there and am italian or american . 
   all you talk about is american things . 
  you have n't written in russian at all . 
  well i am interested in america including ( especially ) the government .
