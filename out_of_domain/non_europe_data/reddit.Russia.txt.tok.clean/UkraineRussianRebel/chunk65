  that 's it 's really annoying when it 's hot , especially if you 're in a city .

   american flags also were reportedly not welcome at the event , although it is n't clear whether anyone was kicked out for having one . 
  flags from other nations appears to have been allowed . 
  they 're getting more radical every year :, 
   they were telling me to leave because my flag was a trigger to people that they found offensive , '' laurel grauer said . 
  `` prior to this [ march ] i had never been harassed or asked to leave and i had always carried the flag with me . '', 
  it 's seems like this was not the main `` parade '' , just the * more inclusive * one :, 
   the annual dyke march is billed as a *** more inclusive *** event that has a stronger focus on social justice issues than the massive chicago pride parade on sunday . 
  some 1,500 people took part in the dyke march this year . 
  ** the comments are priceless ** :, 
   i wonder if those rainbow confederate flags would be allowed ? 
  this is probably sarcasm but still :, 
   why is everyone outraged over this very minor act of much-needed exclusivity ? 
  you people may call it discrimination , but i call it safe-space creation .

   it 's not a positive for gay rights . 
  your first clue should be that none of the gays see it that way . 
  macho america-as-fetish violence worshipping thugs are not going to be good for the gays and it 's absurd on it 's face that we should be expected to take the argument that they could be seriously . 
  homosexuals falling off roofs makes me feel gay inside .

  why is dc so consistently democratic ? 
  people say it 's because the government is close and most people there are government workers/bureaucrats , but should n't it be in that case roughly 50/50 if more than half of the `` government people '' are republicans ?

  indonesians are n't really the dangerous muslims . 
  it 's the fact that saudi , uae and qatar are n't banned is what makes it a not-muslim-ban .

  they only support ( certain classes of ) immigrants ( not asians and indians who can stand on their own , those are considered privileged ) and illegals that keep voting for them . 
  that 's why they oppose the travel ( muslim ) ban and deportation of illegals , no one will vote democrat anymore !, 
  i know people who were diagnosed with autism after getting vaccinated . 
  i do n't even think that north korea would invade them . 
  south korea still has a more powerful military . 
   the constitution actually guarantees the rights of the minority, 
  the will of the majority does n't deny rights to the minority precisely because it can demand only as much as the constitution ( in any country that abides by those principles ) does n't prohibit . 
  if the constitution guarantees rights to the minority , it means that no will of the majority actually threatens the minority rights .
