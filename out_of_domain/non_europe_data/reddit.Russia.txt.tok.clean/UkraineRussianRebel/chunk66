  stupid example : vast majority of people want to drive on the right , a 10 % minority wants to drive on the left . 
  a law is passed that the country drives on the right -- no minority rights violated because there is no right to drive on the site you want to drive on . 
  now , if the right-drivers wanted to prevent the minority from advocating for their position , which is guaranteed to everyone by some `` freedom of expression '' clause , that would be an actual denial of rights by a majority to the minority . 
  so that a majority wants a law that is not unconstitutional or illegal but the minority does n't want it does n't mean the minority is denied its rights , the minority simply does not have the right to have all laws tailored to its demands as long as they do n't violate the guaranteed rights . 
  social anxiety disorder, 
  not american but studying american history quite a bit i 'm not sure if this was always the case . 
  it seems to be a modern phenomenon that america is n't * really * america but just a place for everyone , a multicultural global `` melting pot '' . 
   it was always meant to be an amalgamation of different cultures, 
  early presidents and governments were thinking about proposing something akin to trump 's travel ban but on non-english people and early on it was thought that america should always stay only british . 
  the process of making it an `` amalgamation '' was very slow and each new immigrant wave was taken with distrust : [ germans ] ( http://www.dialoginternational.com/dialog_international/2008/02/ben-franklin-on.html ) ( not exactly a scholarly website , i remember reading it in some book but that 's what i found quickly ) , jews , italians from europe , and then the non-european different immigrants from asia ( yellow peril ) ... pre-1965 immigration law emphasized immigration from the west while now it supports `` diversity immigration '' . 
  i 'd say as someone living in europe , not really talking about america now but about the west in general , that the african/muslim wave right now is where the analogy with `` but we did n't like italians and chinese in the past , we 'll get used to these too '' just stops working . 
  their culture is not just different , it 's opposite of the west . 
  they will * not * assimilate . 
  losing the game, 
  being somewhere near sea . 
  when people disagree with me about politics . 
  i always assault them . 
  [ star spangled banner ] ( http://www.npr.org/2014/09/12/348010268/star-spangled-banner-born-from-a-drinking-song-200-years-ago ), 
  [ india makes software , pakistan makes terrorism ] ( http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/we-export-software-pakistan-exports-terror-prime-minister-narendra-modis-top-quotes/articleshow/54498872.cms ), 
  only europeans and asians , provided that they have education and skills , should be allowed to immigrate . 
  diversity migration from africa and the middle east is a destructive nonsense . 
  winning the right to immigrate based on a lottery is even bigger one . 
  not even talking about how 1990 immigration act removed the requirement for immigrants to learn english . 
  trump , unlike barack hussein obama , is a full-blooded american with german ancestry ( drumpf ) , who was not born in kenya , raised in indonesia , and had to hide being a muslim his whole life ( even liberals would n't vote for an open , out-of-the-closet observant muslim , let 's not kid ourselves ) . 
  i do n't think he 'd object . 
  i used to think anti-vaxxers are just dumb and ignorant ( i 'm vaccinated myself ) but i know a person who got diagnosed with autism just a week after they got vaccinated . 
  i do n't know what type of a vaccine that was though , so possibly it 's just certain types that cause autism . 
  you are my god emperor . 
  everyone likes trump . 
  india , china , israel , russia , argentina , central europe ( not macaroni and merkel - but they do n't represent their own people ) , even the mexican guy , and even the arabs . 
  the only people who think trump will be `` embarrassing '' and a `` laughingstock '' to `` the world '' are american liberals , but the perception is exact opposite from the outside world . 
  i 'd say most were relieved that trump , someone who is genuine and has actual relationships with people . 
  saying what he thinks , is president , and not someone with scripted , rehearsed speeches and `` public and private opinions '' like clinton . 
  mr. gorbachev , tear down this fucking wall . 
  is this the beginning of the end for cnn ? 
  it 's all still just a conspiracy and alt-right controversy !, 
  ( the independent ) :, 
   jack posobiec , an alt-right activist and *** conspiracy theorist *** who was *** controversially *** given white house press accreditation last month , responded by calling on the administration to revoke cnn 's access . 
  so is this a positive news for libtards or negative ? 
  i thought they hated trump because he was a `` putin-lite '' for them but now they think putin is actually better than trump ? 
  now that the russia collution conspiracy did n't work out , are they just trying to say that trump is actually just * worse * than `` the russians '' and that will `` finally impeach drumpf because he did n't collude with the russian baddies but is even badder than the baddies ? '', 
  you can still get fairly real news from kcna about what the north korean government thinks . 
  all you ever get from cnn is fake news . 
  i 've been milkin ' and plowin ' so long that, 
  even ezekiel thinks that my mind is gone, 
  i was about to make a `` with rice '' joke , but i do n't want to go to hell for that . 
  this is absolutely horrifying . 
  i knew they were barbaric , but literal cannibalism ? 
  hopefully they wo n't ban you for anti-semitism lol . 
  i agree that rothschilds are involved in a lot of shady stuff , but whether isis is globalist , idk , maybe islam-globalist , likely not `` jewish-globalist '' . 
   muslims will treat us great when we 're minorities in our homelands . 
  related from ~ ~ r/circlebroke ~ ~ r/openbroke , a self-designated sjw subreddit when i stumbled upon it somehow :, 
   the right-wingers do n't think that minorities are * not * oppressed , they think minorities are no more oppressed than they should be as minorities , * that 's * why they 're so scared of becoming minorities - they believe they will be repressed and disadvantaged , like minorities are now in the west !, 
  these people apparently seriously believe that being a minority in your own country will be a great , noble thing . 
  that the west is * actually * oppressing ethnic minorities , but the rest of the world , muslims , africans especially , are ahead-of-the-time tolerant , accepting and civilized , and when they 're the majority , fear-not , europeans , americans , etc. , we will be trated with dignity and respect , and our ability to oppress anyone will just be taken away !, 
  edit : confused the `` broke '' subreddit, 
  chinese are not a disadvantaged minority , and your country is on a track to become a superpower very soon , if it 's not aleady . 
  therefore you ca n't expect the same amount of deference that is afforded to actual systematically oppressed people . 
  quite to the contrary , chinese , indians and jews are very successful and overrepresented in universities and high-level jobs . 
  which i think is a good thing : the moment people are not afraid to criticize you and make fun of you , it means they do n't feel like they 're attacking someone who `` ca n't defend themselves '', 
  i 'm russian and we 're being made fun of all the time by americans and other westerners , i used to think of it as insulting , demeaning , `` xenophobia '' , etc. 
  until i realized it 's actually better than being coddled and treated as a `` protected class '' . 
  she 's the weakest european politician there is when it comes to her own country . 
  but i agree that she 's a `` strong personality '' when it comes to attacking central europe and trying to force those countries to take the immigrants which germany invited and now is trying to throw away elsewhere via eu `` refugee '' quotas . 
  hey look u/presidentobama, 
  hey look u/the-realdonaldtrump, 
  i 'd rather go far , far away on the trump train, 
  ~ ~ r/successfulblackman ~ ~ happy trump supporter ? 
  people who complained about volkswagen were not the same ones who decided to leave the paris agreement . 
  ( i assume ) . 
  no , what i meant is that it 's quite sad that even people who normally have dignity and self-esteem ( like asians ) are falling for this whining about `` bigotry '' now . 
  especially considering that they 're the most successful population in the us financially , by educational attainment etc. 
  so it 's just seems inappropriate to be upset about this . 
  i am surprised a place like arkansas has antifa . 
  i thought it was a christian , conservative , common sense state without radicals . 
  however , the fact people are destroying things like ten commandments monument is really alarming . 
  that someone is bothered by traditional morality so much that it 's worth for them go out of their way to vandalize it . 
  spez : oh , there was even a lawsuit over it :, 
   `` at a time when we do not need any more religious conflict and divisiveness in the world and in this country , it violates the first amendment promise of religious liberty to all , '' rita sklar , the group 's executive director , told npr . 
  `` by placing a monument to a particular set of religious beliefs , it appears that the state enforces one particular set of beliefs over others and over no religion . 
  and it makes people who fall into those categories -- no religion or other religion -- feel like second-class citizens in the state of arkansas , which they are not . '', 
   one religious cult to do this, 
  christianity, 
  religious cult, 
  really ... ? 
   because other christians were persecuting other christians . 
  that 's why it 's a monument to the ten commandments , a common , recognized traditional morality of most christian nations , and not to a specific chuch . 
  it 's a monument to tradition , rather than religion . 
   a precedence that muslims will exploit . 
  let 's just not pretend muslims and christianity are equally important to european/western/christian societies . 
  i will object to a crescent being displayed in public school as an obvious instance of pandering to muslims . 
  i will never object to a christian cross , ten commandments or quotes from bible being displayed there , despite me not being especially religious in any way . 
  france and germany are removing crosses from their schools because it 's offensive to newcomers , despite no one ever objecting to christian symbols even in the years of `` counterculture '' in 1960s . 
  i get it , but cult has a very negative connotation these days . 
  i understand some people are atheists , anti-theists , ( i 'm agnostic ) and so on , but it 's not like a majority of christian churches , definitely not the large , mainstream ones , are cults as it is commonly used . 
   you wo n't have a leg to stand on when muslims want to do it, 
  maybe when they have sufficient power for that . 
  as bannon said , country is more than just an economy , in the same way , law is a * minimum * ethics and tradition , not its entirety . 
  there 's more to culture than just formal law . 
  this `` we have to let muslims do it '' is entirely self-imposed .
