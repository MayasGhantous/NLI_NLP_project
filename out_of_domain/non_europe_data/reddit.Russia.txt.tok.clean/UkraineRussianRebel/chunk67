  how many muslims are there in arkansas , or muslim-free european countries ? 
  how long a tradition does islam have in these areas for them to have this allowed ? 
  it produced bill clinton . 
  so i believe you there are `` heavily liberal towns '' . 
  the guy in `` so sorry pardon '' t-shirt smiling haha . 
  my american teacher in high school ( she had a degree in feminism and complained that she could n't find a job in the us so she moved to europe to teach english ) told us that the confederate flag is a horrible symbol of bigotry and prejudice . 
  she was baffled when i told her that i saw african americans in croatia , in a car with alabama license plates , the car adorned with confederate flags , confederate towels , when they moved into the hotel the hung the confederate flag on the windows . 
  i never thought about it as being anything more than a symbol of just the southern region of the us before ( i did n't really know that it 's controversial in some way back then ) , so it did n't surprise me at all . 
   as if some sort of widespread manchurian candidate-style operation was devised within the halls of the kremlin . 
  there is no evidence of collusion between the trump campaign and the russians . 
  that 's what we want you americans to believe . 
  likely not , too many issues to solve at any given time . 
  if by direct democracy we mean making decisions on laws and so on , consider how many laws there are in congresses and other legislatures every single day . 
  how many regulations and statutes . 
  that 's why societies have politicians and bureaucrats : people specializing in that , and doing their job . 
  if one wanted to keep up with all the issues , you 'd simply not have time to get acquainted with all that is being voted on . 
  but i definitely think there should be more referendums on landmark issues . 
  my local newspaper once published an interview with a pedophile who admitted he has a problem . 
  his mistake was that at the end he started saying how pedophilia is just a part of the range of sexual preferences people have and it 's not at all scary , that people just have a `` prejudiced '' view towards pedophiles . 
  the readers ' letters section a few days later was brutal . 
  everything trump does is either harrassment or bigotry . 
  ( cnn ), 
  that 's an info war declared on the honorable clinton family by the russians , i do n't believe it !, 
  where did these people exist before and why have their started crawling out of their caves in the last few months ? 
  i wrote about making fun ( `` mockery '' ) as well . 
  making fun of someone or some culture/country is common and not as horrible as people are making it out to be . 
  it 's not like everyone is super polite and looking out not to offend all the time , * especially * outside of western countries . 
  it 's just weird to be offended by it , for the reasons i stated above . 
  [ time ] ( http://archive.is/61qso ), 
  with a side of ketchup . 
  is n't that a swastika down there in the right corner ? 
  i hate open borders tbh . 
  it 's very triggering . 
  there should be no borders at all . 
  i 'm an [ ecosexual ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sexecology ) and [ green anarchist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/green_anarchism ) . 
  i do n't see any sarcasm here . 
   arm bears, 
  [ bears must be armed !,

   can restrict as they see fit , we know how that will end eventually . 
  there is a restriction now , and the stipulation as it exists currently is that in order to get a weapon ( firearm ) , one needs a licence , which can be obtained after undergoing training , medical and psychological examination , and under condition of having no criminal record . 
  it exists so that every petty criminal or a thug ca n't get a gun . 
  it is usually on a shall-issue basis , but on the level of `` literally everyone can get armed without any guarantees or questions asked '' . 
  yeah , the hypocrisy is staggering . 
  we should never assume that someone is dangerous , and we should never make fun of people with mental issues . 
  * barron is a future school shooter !, 
  he 's totally autistic !, 
  we should not require immigrants to assimilate and speak english , this is a multicultural society and everyone is welcome . 
  * look at melania , she ca n't even speak proper english , dumb slavic bitch !, 
  trump is making fun of rand paul 's looks , how immature !, 
  * haha he is orange !, 
  your so-called facts come from the `` respectable media '' , which is widely recognized to be fake news and new facts of that are surfacing every day . 
  if you believe the `` russia hacking '' and similar conspiracies , you 're the wrong side of history , as obama would say . 
  because conservative women tend to respect traditional values , which include honestly and faithfulness , while liberals emphasize `` social and sexual liberation '' , faithfulness in relationships is defined as sexist , patriarchal , obsolete social rule which has no value . 
  thus cheating shows that they 're `` independent '' women who do n't need to be `` comitted '' in a relationship . 
  any objection to that would , in their view , mean that you 're arachaic and un-progressive , or , worse , patriarchal and patronizing . 
  it 's a serbian name , also widely used in other slavic balkan countries . 
  example : moran graci\u0107, 
  more like whatever is the norm . 
  heterosexuality is now offensive and oppressive , as is having your gender match your body . 
  the fact you are talking about the debunked `` 17 intelligence agencies '' is exactly what my point was . 
  do you believe the buzzfeed dossier and `` pissgate '' as well ? 
  really , that \u042f there ? 
  w\u043da\u0442 nex\u0442 , \u0430r\u044d you pos\u0442i\u0438g ra\u0438do\u043c chin\u044dse cha\u044fac\u0442ers ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  outing in what sense ? 
  do you think every russian on reddit or the internet in general is a paid putin agent employed by kremlin ? 
  but yeah the `` right wing '' are conspiracy theorists . 
  here is a [ verified proof ] ( https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/835916511944523777 ) . 
  the board was / pol / , not / b / . 
   globalism is not going away and our grandchildren will see you as the odd swell of hatred that happens when the world progresses, 
  most of the world is nationalist . 
  global trade , cultural contacts , `` diversificiation '' and globalism are not the same thing . 
  giving up your culture to , in many cases illegal , mass immigration , giving up your countries for the sake of artificial `` diversity '' and islamification , replacing your values with those of the imported people and actually celebrating losing your heritage , is far from any global ideal , or anything that is even remotely happening anywhere outside of the west . 
  artificual diversity * within * , not * among * nations - forced multiculturalism - is a purely western , liberal , `` progressive '' ideology which has no analogy anywhere else . 
  lol , i am not actually american . 
  left-wing americans have this weird persecution complex , seeing everyone as enemy without any nuance , that we want to `` take over '' and `` putin wants to see something happen to you '' . 
  most russians do n't even care or know what alt-right is . 
  there 's like one article i 've read in the entire russian coverage of american election which [ was devoted to the alt-right phenomenon at all ] ( https://lenta.ru/articles/2016/12/09/hail_trump/ ) . 
  but in the liberal circles of the west , when people make a choice that does n't align with the `` correct progressive course of history '' , it 's almost by definition a `` russian conspiracy '' undermining the '' global liberal order '' ( no such thing exists ) . 
  obviously we prefer nationalist trump who said he 'd `` get along with russia '' over rabid clinton who thinks we 're [ `` literally hitler '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpvg2djthg4 ) and conspiracy left , but that does n't mean there are n't enough americans or europeans who are concerned about the main issues trump has raised : illegal immigration and terrorism , primarily , enough to elect him . 
  not everything you disagree with is a `` russian conspiracy '' . 
  you 're just wrong . 
  simply * wrong * . 
  you 're so wrong you do n't even see it . 
  you will though one day . 
  when america is made great and safe again and you will be the guy who was hating on trump all along . 
  very polite !, 
  you 're starting to be hateful and insulting here . 
  i suggest that you calm down , people disagreeing on the internet does happen , there is no need to escalate . 
  the problem is that you ca n't order that i get `` out of a fucking comment tree '' . 
  i am afraid to ask what will happen if i do n't . 
  also if you can do this all day that 's pretty upsetting . 
  are you one of the [ basement dwellers ] ( http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-supporters-audio-leak-228997 ) ? 
  motherhood is more stressful than a career . 
  liberals are pathetic if they believe that it is not , but it is a common belief among them , sadly . 
  i ca n't prove or disprove that , but you do n't talk like a scientist would . 
  i assume you are trolling me . 
  but if not , i work at spacex and am advancing the american mission to mars . 
  anyway it 's surprising that a scientist with excellent productivity would have time to get mad at random people on reddit over alt-right .
