   you 're a non-american the_donald poster, 
  i am a non-american the_donald poster, 
   i can do this all day , troll . 
   i 'm at work . 
  i work in a below-ground lab . 
  and my productivity is doing excellent . 
  does not compute . 
  but then i never worked at an underground lab . 
  lol what . 
  i do n't want to kill any civilians anywhere . 
  this is a dishonest bait and i 'm not going to get baited . 
  if you think right wingers , be it regular right or the `` alt-right '' , or `` the russians '' , are `` out to get civilians in america '' , it 's just media hysteria from the left which lost the election and now are coping the best way they can . 
  as for this republican healthcare bill that some claim will be `` literally killing people '' , i do n't know anything about that , it 's a specifically american issue . 
   european `` heritage '' makes you this `` imported persons '' that you rally against ? 
  i 'm not american but i disagree with this even when it comes to america . 
  europeans are n't `` imported people '' because they actually founded the united states of america as a country where there was none . 
  so , they `` self-imported '' on the american continent and established a nation and a government , taking the territory from the population which previously inhabited it . 
  thus , they now have a sovereign right to decide whom to allow into their country , the `` native '' `` first americans '' have virtually no power . 
  native americans * do * have a sovereignty , but only as part ( citizens ) of the united states . 
  surely the us government would not allow them to create some kind of native american independent country these days . 
  they were even denied citizenship of the united states until 1920s , which kind of proves that this idea of the land not belonging to europeans * at all * is a modern , retrospective concept . 
  now if native americans founded the american state ( republic ) and someone tried to invade it , as muslims are now invading europe , it would be a whole different matter because they would have a complete sovereignty over their territory . 
  but they lost it in the war against europeans , so they do n't have it now -- except as american citizens . 
  this is the case in europe as well and most territories , in fact . 
  china did not own the entirety of its current territory and ( han ) chinese are `` imported people '' to a large part of what is today china , but no one would deny their sovereignty over the entire territory . 
   values are always changing and adapting to the exposure of new people . 
  the french , belgians , the dutch should have just adapted to being ruled by new people and conforming to new values they brought in early 1940s . 
  the intolerant americans decided this is just not the case . 
  but you 're totally right , societies are adapting to `` new people '' , in many areas of france women forced to change their clothes to conform to the customs of the `` new people '' . 
  not conforming is far too dangerous . 
  i do n't even know, 
  you 're not bad driver , * for a woman * . 
  donald j. trump to make america great again . 
  i agree , * who are you ? 
  * is a much better way to phrase it . 
  b , like * bitch * ? 
  i thought that 's fairly acceptable . 
  and the c-word is * cracker * ? 
  anything involving soros . 
  i called my friend a slut once and she did n't talk to me for a week . 
  never tried the c-word or the b-word ( and probably wo n't ) . 
  i 'm not american , is there some specific cultural reason for this or did it just somehow happen that one kind of women does n't like `` c '' , and another kind `` b '' ? 
  i do n't want to educate people on the russia conspiracy for a third or fourth time this day , so unfortunately you will stay unenlightened and will keep believing that the russia conspiracy has any factual basis . 
  ah , * bloods * and * crips * , it all makes sense now . 
  where i am a ruthless dictator sending people i do n't like to gulags and torturing them . 
  not every candidate you do n't like is conspired with `` the russians '' . 
  that would be too big a coincidence . 
  people can vote for trump without being russian agents and vote to leave the eu without being influenced by the russians . 
  also , 17 intelligence agencies are fake news . 
  if he wins in 2020 , he 's right !, 
  i wanted to upvote you but as soon as you said you 're green ... go back to greenland you filth !,

  somalia is probably skinny , poor family , victim of child abuse . 
  sometimes goes all `` pirate '' stealing stuff from other kids ' desks . 
  gets free lunches , always runs first to the cafeteria . 
  just today i thought about what would happen if one were reading a nsfw thread ( while reading the glory-hole thread lol ) at work , and to which extent `` not safe '' those threads actually hare . 
  hopefully nothing will happen haha . 
  is trump somehow preventing car companies from making electric cars ? 
  oil is still by far the most used fuel . 
  but the us is not `` going back to oil '' because no one stopped using it yet . 
  maybe you mean the fracking thing ? 
  turning away from fossil fuels in the future does n't really prevent elon musk or anyone else from developing renewable energy now . 
  the us still has agencies devoted to this . 
   cheney profited with haliburton during iraq war and, 
   america economy and housing market crashed . 
  maybe i just missed it but what is the link there ? 
  i thought the housing market crashed because the banks were giving out loans to unreliable debtors . 
  * ignore , i 'm giving up *, 
   no flag no country, 
  anarchism confirmed . 
  haha lol, 
  slightly relevant, 
  nothing . 
  i want something similar for europe but eu is cucked !, 
  is n't there a record for every congress vote ? 
  [ found it ] ( https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/115-2017/h344 ), 
  amash , justin ( r-mi , 3rd ) voted against . 
  ** abstained : **, 
  gosar , paul ( az-4th ), 
  * scalise , steve * ( la-1st ) - well , we ca n't really blame him , right ? 
  long , billy ( mo - 7 ),

  * warning : i 'm `` eurocuck '' when it comes to `` free '' education and healthcare-as-a-right *, 
  having `` free '' college will definitely help people not acquire massive student debt , but it should n't apply to useless programs like `` gender/criticial/culture ___ studies '' and so on . 
  but i hear that americans have scholarship for pretty much everyone and everything , so the student debt situation is not all that acute for many .
