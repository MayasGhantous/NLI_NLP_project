  weird question : do they usually use staff translators from the visiting president/government , or did they just happen to find someone who does not speak both korean and english as first languages ? 
  failed to determine whether you 're now banned from r/pyongyang or not . 
  yeah , simultaneous translation on news is usually unbearable . 
  notice me trump senpai - cnn, 
  isis is losing territory . 
  so is cnn . 
  bleeding badly, 
  from the facelift, 
  low iq !, 
  `` clovergender '' is just too unbelievable not to be a troll . 
  at least something she does right . 
  i thought that maybe like ~ 50 % of germans support gay marriage , nope , it 's 75 % . 
  wonder if there 's any country where it would be higher , maybe somewhere like netherlands . 
  the theory is the she allowed the vote so that this way liberals and `` progressives '' will not have to vote for spd ( socialists ) , die linke ( more to the left ) and greens ( extreme left ) , because one of their main `` causes '' is now settled to leftists who disagreed with cdu now can vote for them `` with clear conscience '' . 
  despite the fact that she was against , as was most of her party . 
  i 'm confused about america . 
  on one hand , you have based people like trump , and then on the other you get bill clinton . 
  ( is a rapist ; infowars.com ), 
  it 's because germany and france will no longer exist . 
  hungary will be sorting out the refugees from those countries who will be allowed to come to hungary , with the people who caused the emergence of the islamic regime in western europe ( sjws , liberals , progressives , antifa , other leftists ) being denied entry because letting those people in would be just way too dangerous . 
  russian hackers, 
  by the comments , i 'm a bit surprised that looking out of the window is not interesting enough for many people . 
  pizza , probably . 
  you can make it with different toppings so it would be different food each time . 
  or salads , the same thing . 
  stalinism was named after stalin , maoism after mao , bolivarianism after simon bolivar , leninism after lenin , marxism after marx . 
  also nazism was called hitlerism for some time . 
   liberal ~ ~ women ~ ~ wymyn, 
  that person may have been a [ solipsist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solipsism ) . 
  he was trolling the msm , but naive fake-newsy reporters believe anything regardless of plausibility , like that p.j.watson literally eats books !, 
  me : ww1 ended in 1918, 
  my friend : wait that was ww2, 
  `` no , ww1 was 1914-1918 . 
  ww2 was 1939-1945 '', 
  her : `` oh , i thought 1914-1918 was ww2 , and ww1 was like , 1840s , like 1848 '' ( confusing it either with the european revolutions year or napoleonic wars ) `` ah , it was the hitler guy . 
  i remember now . '', 
  the serpent of the garden of eden , obviously . 
  [ joke 's on you ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/italy+texas ), 
  i hope this question gets there so we know the answer . 
  you 're empathizing with the slave . 
  i assume he was talking about why it 's economically a bad idea . 
  does it mean we 're deporting ? 
  marriage is patriarchal oppression anyway . 
  someone told me somewhere on reddit that `` all civilized nations '' are turning more liberal and progressive and `` my kind will soon have to go into hiding '' . 
  i responded that they will be getting more `` progressive '' , but then will take a sharp turn towards a caliphate with their liberal immigration policy . 
   so all these countries : sweden , denmark , germany , uk , poland , norway , the netherlands , belgium , france will be taken over by radical islam ? 
  poland ? 
  progressive ? 
  ignorance proven lol . 
  i crossed the border to france from switzerland once . 
  the village was nice . 
  but i have no idea what it 's like in paris haha . 
  this image never stops triggering me no matter how many times i see . 
  one would think i 'd develop tolerance already but i do n't . 
  must be the vaccines , or the water . 
   americans typically would say july 27th . 
  damn . 
  the russian collusion was true all along . 
  op 's mom jokes is not a part of r/the _ donald culture , sorry . 
  will the alt-right ever stop ???!!, 
  did you just say hysterical you anti-semite ? 
  it 's not hysterical to be hysterical when 93 million americans are shot every day due to gun violence you transphobe . 
   he has tourettes, 
  lmao, 
  i love it when someone [ whispers this ] ( https://youtu.be/26-vzfbzg1w?t=24s ) gently into my ear . 
  panda ? 
  we should not forget that, 
  his name was seth rich, 
  b-but trolling is not presidential , why ca n't drumpf be more like osama i mean obama ? 
  #keep america great ? 
  i never looked but she 's a relative of * that guy * brzezinski ? 
  it all makes sense now . 
  she 's just a nasty woman . 
  the claim was that he was not born in the us , not that 's not actually a citizen , if i remember correctly . 
  however it 's surprising that so many people think that not being born on the us territory actually prevents you from being president , they constitution does n't actually state you have to be born in the us . 
  but i have no doubt that obama was a muslim and not actually american in his beliefs , but i 'm not denying that he was a legitimate president . 
  cnn is fake news . 
  white house was built by slaves !, 
  it 's a monument to slavery !, 
  -- obama , probably, 
   most diplomats in brussels dismiss the importance of the three seas project , co-hosted by croatia , but are wary over trump 's high-profile visit to participate in a project one senior eu official called poland 's push towards *** `` self-ghettoisation '' . 
  ahahaha , poland is one of the last countries to be worried about `` ghettoisation '' . 
   `` we encourage mr trump to get out and travel as much as he can . 
  he needs to understand europe and he can do that by getting out and speaking to people , *** to european leaders *** , '' said one european official , who declined to be named . 
   '' ( but ) *** he ca n't do deals with individual countries over the head of the european union , '' *** he said . 
  `` in hamburg , he will hear different arguments , we can clear up anything that has been misconstrued . '', 
  precisely , the european '' '' `` leaders '' '' '' are opposed to the european ~ ~ union ~ ~ people . 
  and this `` he ca n't do that without our permission '' is just further proof that the eu is turning into an authoritarian organization that does n't see the member states as sovereign and independent anymore . 
  lol , that 's actually a hilarious paradox . 
  eu army occupying a nato territory , despite - and at the same time because - these countries being in both nato and the eu army . 
  well the us tried that stuff in afghanistan with the taliban if i remember correctly , and before , rome tried that with teutons/germans/gals , conscripting barbarians to their military . 
  did n't work . 
  yes , i meant european people , not union . 
  corrected . 
  it 's literally algeria over there . 
  the point is that it wo n't be getting better if they keep bringing more , it will be getting worse . 
  the ability to control their behavior and ensure security decreases exponentionally because you ca n't appoint a new police officer per every new migrant you import . 
  also , because not every christian woman is dressed as a nun . 
  if this were the case , christians would be annoying af . 
  christian orthodox/nun dress is not all that different from what muslims wear but the difference is that christians do n't wear that as permanent barrier that prevents any social interaction with non-muslims , and they do n't want to force everyone to be `` modest '' and be `` dressed properly '' ( hijab ) through violence or government regulation .
