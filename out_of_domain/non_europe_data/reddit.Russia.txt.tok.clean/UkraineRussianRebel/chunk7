  `` did you hear about the new twitter feature ? 
  you do n't have to show up at the polling place on nov. 8 to vote for hillary , now you can vote for hillary by tweeting #imwithher '', 
  right when i looked at the cuckcam , there was a guy talking about how he did n't ban those countries like egypt , saudi arabia and turkey because `` he has businesses there . '', 
  egypt is ruled by a secular government , saudi arabia has plenty of american soldiers there ( even though they 're basically a wahhabi state ) and turkey is a nato member . 
  but they 're looking into explanations they like . 
  i think they 're just downvoting everything on here . 
  kind of like we 're upvoting when there 's a brigade . 
  no more latinos, 
  no more latinas, 
  latinx is the word, 
  so we now have a separate thread for watching and one for commenting ? 
  great innovation . 
  me too . 
  i am not american . 
  i would n't watch merkel press conference . 
  i watch these . 
  nyt : trump hates muslims , why is he condemning attack on a mosque ? 
  reeeeeee, 
  draining the swamp !, 
  #u t t e r, 
  unbelievably qualified !, 
  ( democrats know , they 're jealous ! ), 
  nice first question . 
  trump agreed with the king of saudi arabia on safe zones . 
  when can syrians expect to get the support and the safe zones ? 
  are the new comments showing up ? 
  somehow i do n't see them . 
  mine , too . 
  you did n't get banned . 
  my comments do n't show up on the press briefing thread . 
  comments are back !, 
  it fits into their `` trump the anti-semite '' narrative . 
  as if the phrase `` suffering people '' does n't imply jews and everyone else who was the victim of holocaust . 
  #hold on hold on, 
  liberals : america is so terrible , the refugees are doing america a service by willing to come there and culturally enrich it !, 
  haha his accent is so cool, 
  modi spoke with trump to make america great again :d, 
  #fake tears, 
  #fake news, 
  is n't there an exception for christians and jews ? 
  guys ... 
  i am really scared ... what if somalia cancels the relations with the us ? 
  media : are you afraid of the kickback from the banned countries ? 
  `` travel ban makes us less safe '', 
  if you lock your door , you are making yourself less safe at night !, 
  `` if you do n't let those people in , they will join isis ! '', 
  so if you do let them in , they wo n't join isis ? 
  like those paris attackers , right ? 
  they were already in !, 
  `` with the refugee ban , america loses its moral leadership '', 
  because people anywhere look at germany and say `` they 're so moral '' instead of `` they 're insane '', 
  i tried to look but basically it 's hard to find anything that gives information and not bashing . 
  i only learned spanish for a short time , but as far as i know , the first `` a '' in the word latina has nothing to do with gender ? 
  i liked donald trump 's , orban 's , netanyahu 's , le pen 's page on facebook and follow a pegida group . 
  i 'll never get a job with facebook or grubhub , * sigh * : /, 
  you look so upset haha, 
  yes . 
  i am going to try now and see what happens . 
  til mccain and graham are bots . 
  it all makes sense now . 
  i got a little bit sick . 
  like a caleidoscope . 
  yeah , mccain 's grammar is worse but he got more likes . 
  tds is a very serious diagnosis . 
  should n't underestimate it . 
  and he did n't take anyone 's citizenship away ... and he made an exception for those with approved green cards ... why are we even playing that game ? 
  the comparison is so asinine and provocative we should just treat those who bring it up like they lost the debate . 
  have you seen r/the _ schulz ? 
  i am not sure if that 's a parody on the_donald , or are they just eu/leftwingers trying to emulate our style , or is it someone from t_d making a double-satire , applying t_d style and memes on one of the most pro-eu leftists ? 
   checkmate drumpf, 
  ftfy, 
  did n't notice this , thanks . 
  it 's actually quite interesting . 
  especially the part about `` weird german humor '' lol . 
  j'ai l'impression d'exploser . 
  j'ai une putain de panne . 
  we english badly, 
  sory for that, 
  we make our english gooder , promise, 
   worst age group is by far the 16-22 group while the older ones tend to be much more interested in working and making a life . 
  there 's one [ very based somali ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ayaan_hirsi_ali ) . 
  obligatory r/ooerintensifies, 
  is that a new version of niqab ? 
   a guard will quiz you on the koran, 
  challenge accepted, 
  from quora :, 
   they 'll check for your identity that since how long you 're living in saudi arabia , they 'll contact your sponsor and they may ask your sponsor to come to the place and pick you up and make sure that this should not be repeated . 
  otherwise , if you have no `` sponsor '' and just came as a visitor , they will escort you to the nearest airport and deport you . 
  pretty certain muslims can go there . 
  it 's a \\ #nonmuslimsban . 
  two presumed finalists, 
  trump just raped gorsuch 's wife again, 
  reeeeeeeeeeeeeee, 
  was r/redacted overrun by centipedes ? 
  the comments now are praising . 
   redditor for 1 month, 
  i meant that the u/john __ podesta accout is apparently not a novelty one , which makes it funnier . 
  [ if i 'm president , we will attack iran , and we will totally obliterate them ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htbdfccqdns ), 
  population of iran : 77.5 million, 
  is this going to be our well-hidden , very secret subreddit if they come for us at r/the _ donald ?
