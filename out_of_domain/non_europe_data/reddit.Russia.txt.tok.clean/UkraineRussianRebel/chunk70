  hey now , the not shaking hands was because of sexism , not because he does n't like her / s, 
  * especially * hitler . 
  it 's terrible how social democrats in all countries became such awful trash . 
  when i hear `` social democrat '' i just shudder , these people are disgusting . 
  even literal communists often have more common sense than the `` moderate '' social dems . 
  also , it has a limited amount of energy and if you exercise , you are draining it , like battery . 
  yeah , but the also lose $ 719k worth of cultural enrichment and diversity with every deported illegal , we should consider that , too . 
  no speak americano, 
  i would n't go to sweden . 
  california-cucks : better ded than red !, 
  make mexico great ~ ~ again ~ ~ for the first time, 
   people do n't ever put on a false face to prove their not insane, 
  whom ~ ~ god ~ ~ american government wants to ~ ~ destroy ~ ~ depose it first ~ ~ makes ~ ~ declares insanse nutjob dictator . 
   will be blamed on assad, 
  thanks for informing who will be blamed in advance , lol . 
  lately i kind of have this feeling that syria wo n't go back together . 
  assad ( and russia , iran ) probably need to come to terms with the fact it will probably be unstable east syria in a state of constant islamist civil war , while the coastal areas and parts of the western syria will be controlled by assad/some stable government like it was before the war . 
  considering history :, 
   during french rule , the people today known as alawites -- and who today rule syria -- begged the french to allow them to set up their own state in their ancient homeland along the mediterranean coast between today 's lebanon and turkey . 
  one of those who most passionately supported this option was the grandfather of the ruler of syria today : suleyman al-assad . 
   this is because syrian sunnis have historically referred to individual alawites as `` abid '' [ slave ] , and treated the alawites as such . 
  the alawites were servants in sunni households . 
  alawite tradition is filled with horror stories of sunni abuse , both working in sunni households and in other areas of as well . 
  alawism is basically not islam :, 
   the alawites hold ali to be the *** ( jesus-like ) incarnation of divinity . 
  *** while mainstream muslims ( both sunni and shi'ite ) proclaim their faith with the phrase `` there is no deity but god and muhammad is his prophet , '' alawites assert , `` there is no deity but ali , no veil but muhammad , and no bab but salman . '', 
   alawites , furthermore , *** ignore islamic sanitary practices , dietary restrictions , and religious rituals . 
  *** the syncretistic nature of the alawite belief is further evident in its calendar , which is replete with festivals of christian , persian , and muslim origin . 
   giving ali primacy over the muhammad , a feature shared by various ghul\u0101t ( shi\u2019ite extremist ) sects , *** permitting wine drinking , not requiring women to be veiled , holding ceremonies at night , *** and several pagan practices have led mainstream muslims to label alawites to be often singled out as heretics or extremists . 
  she 's so smug . 
  omg it 's russophobic and prejudiced against the russians , only a bigot would assume that all russians are hackers . 
  they 're standards-fluid . 
  global warming is a chinese hoax . 
  if you 're going through people 's post history , you 're a libtard kenyan born muslim manchurian benito osama bin lyin saddam hussein teleprompter \u00d8bama-soros supporter !, 
  i always make sure i post some serious comments to get a few hundred karma so i can then troll freely , the waiting time limit when you have negative karma is really annoying . 
   regardless of the content of the speech . 
  absolutely agree . 
   do not believe in any form of gun control whatsoever . 
  this is fairly risky imho . 
   i hate universal health care , as it forces doctors to treat people without pay !, 
  that 's not how universal healthcare works , the doctors are employed , no one forces them to work for free , or forces them to be employed . 
  despite what rand paul says about `` right to healthcare means doctors being in slavery '' , that 's not true , because it 's not a `` literal right '' , it 's a right to get treatment from doctors who are employed by state-financed institutions ( or institutions that accept state-financed insurance ) . 
  that 's how it works in most countries with public healthcare . 
   i hate kenyan born muslim manchurian benito osama bin lyin saddam hussein teleprompter \u00d8bama-soros, 
  me too . 
   bush also committed terrible war crimes like 9/11, 
  finally someone who does n't believe the bin laden deep state conspiracy . 
  you must be a soros-funded democrat . 
  obama is just osama in disguise . 
  but i am also a constitution supporting republican who always gets downvoted . 
  it does n't because sexism is defined as femininity plus power , men have neither . 
  he is just red pilled unlike you . 
  you will get there , too . 
  it just seems weird to me to be certain that there is god or certain there is n't . 
  i love it , it 's the best progress , we 're winning again . 
  we 've never been winning so much , maybe during the normady campaign but that was nothing compared to how much we will be winning now . 
  china has nothing on us , we will get along with china , we will get along with russia and india , we will be great with mexico , after they pay for the wall , i love mexican people , we will have a great relationship with mexico . 
  i think we did a tremendous progress so far , it 's great , i love it . 
  if these internet points are fake , what are the real internet points ? 
  i 'm russian and somehow this happened to me . 
  i mostly think and write in english . 
  yes . 
  make america mexico again !, 
   after all , they 're americans too . 
  i 'm done, 
  it 's not really illegal . 
  what i mean is that the constitution does n't say you ca n't run if you have relatives/spouses who were in politics , or even impeached . 
  you 're representing yourself and running for president individually , not as a part of a family or other relation . 
   literally considering his surgeon general pick 2 days ago, 
  but having black friend does n't make you not a bigot !, 
  having a female wife does n't make you not a misogynist !, 
  talking to a gay does n't make you not a `` homophobe '' !, 
  having a co-worker from another country does n't make you not a xenophobe !, 
  if you think illegal immigrants should get to vote , you are an illegal immigrant and should move to canada . 
   she should have sad she carries fried chicken and watermelon . 
  kek, 
  how many times does jewish , immigrant , transgender , homosexual , african american , italian american , mormon and muslim appear there ? 
  hmm , i think this healthcare bill is very bigoted , anti-semitic , homophobic and islamophobic and problematic . 
  also , why does she think `` woman '' should appear there , how about the 93 million other genders ? 
   germistan, 
  i too am a white knight , no time for sluts , have to deus vult, 
  i 'm wondering if lovlena is amernian or from some other country around there . 
  it sounds like one of those pseudo-russian names like vilena etc. 
  that people used to give children in 70s , some still do in russia and former ussr . 
  they always provide `` deep psychological analysis '' of trump 's tweets , as if what the post says was not self-contained and you could find in it more than what the tweet is actually saying . 
  basically , those were not `` real '' , historical russian names , but made up ones that sound `` russian '' . 
  they were n't very frequent but there are a few people who were named like that . 
  some examples :, 
  elina , a fairly popular russian name , in fact , is an abbreviation of [ ** el ** ektrifikacia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/goelro_plan ) and [ ** in ** dustrializaci * a * ] ( http://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/industrialization-soviet ), 
  renat - ** r ** evolutsia , ** na ** uka i ** trud ** - revolution , science , labor, 
  or named after some important cultural events that communism cherished , like olympics . 
  there are people [ named olympics - olympiada ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olimpiada_ivanova ), 
  germany ? 
  muslims hate just about everyone who is not a muslim . 
  more specifically , sunni muslims hate everyone , shia muslims , like those from iran , do n't really do much terrorism at all , it 's all sunnis . 
  i do n't know what 's wrong with those people , but they 're taking the commands to destroy `` infidels '' very literally and seriously . 
  it 's a hate-cult , a totalitarian , destructive ideology . 
  why are we pretending there is such a thing as `` moderate '' sunni muslim ? 
  we are n't talking about moderate fascists , nazis or bolsheviks , so why do they get away and are protected under tolerance doctrine ? 
  they should be shamed like other hateful cults are .
