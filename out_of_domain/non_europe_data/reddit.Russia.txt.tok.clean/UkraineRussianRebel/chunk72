  the impact decreases with increasing distance . 
   china has a `` what can you do for me '', 
  that 's why they 're helping africa develop through building industry there , mining and employing the actual native population much more than any western humanitarian help ever will . 
  what can you do for me ? 
  vs. omg we 're so sorry for colonialism , let 's just throw food and humanitarian aid on them and expect nothing . 
  why is skin color of the terrorist relevant ? 
  you 're conflating muslim with arab/middle eastern if you are convinced that muslim = `` brown '' person . 
  [ these people ] ( http://helpster.ru/pic/beauty/pic/91337/1.jpg ) are muslim , as are many asians . 
  neither christianity nor a particular skin color causes terrorism , it 's not done in the name of christianity but by people who happen to possibly be `` christian '' ( which is usually just an assumption ) , while muslim terrorism is done by adherents of islam and they 're open about it . 
  so you have to screen people for mental issues and extremist beliefs , but liberals are somehow making it an ethnicity issue and cheering whenever the terrorist is not a muslim . 
  they may not mind saying their opinion on reddit , but there 's [ goldwater rule ] ( https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/apa-blogs/apa-blog/2016/08/the-goldwater-rule ) . 
  you are absolutely wrong and believe fake news . 
  there will be no democratic party in 2022 . 
  i used to make fun of america having a `` fake democracy '' where a person can win even if they have a minority of the vote . 
  then i felt like a hypocrite rationalizing to myself that electoral college is actually great and explaining to american liberals that it 's `` to represent the states and because america is federation '' lol, 
  i 'm wondering if a personification of cnn would be attractive . 
  maybe it would be that kind of nasty gossiping girl that is lying all the time but is still hot ? 
  are you kidding . 
  i want this to be true so badly . 
  the fun part ? 
  he is russian . 
  an anti-trump russian . 
  how much does that break the narrative ? 
  how ? 
  i probably missed something . 
  the suki lol, 
  i 'm wondering how much the production of the meme cost ... r/the _ donald r&d does n't work for free , we 're no slaves here , but it could n't have been * that * expensive . 
  my salt mines are making enough , i have dedicated myself to the service to the people for free . 
  #w i n n i n g, 
  we love it !, 
  obama visited and remember all 57 states . 
  must be troll . 
  the real vikings were black but there 's still blonde girl standing next to him ? 
  or does she think vikings were n't a status but , like they believe muslims are an ethnicity , vikins were an ethnicity as well ? 
  how does one get a centipede flair ? 
  answering late , but i 'm not hired by china to post , i 'm not even chinese , but building railways , mines , roads and hospitals , despite the fact that obviously chinese are doing that for their own benefit , does help africa , it 's mutually useful .

  so are we trying to make her lock it , or are we just informing ourselves on who that verified person is ? 
  exactly . 
  i think telling a kid `` you have no friends '' is very offensive and abusive , you never know , he might be suicidal , it 's cyberbullying !, 
  reported instantly . 
  let her be locked . 
  already over 700 when i subbed . 
   guys who can swing a fucking hammer and hit a nail wo n't lift a finger for less than $ 25/hr . 
  not disputing anything but what actually prevents americans from offering themselves to do these jobs ? 
  why do they apply for the $ 11.50 per hour jobs , instead of the $ 25 which illegals are doing ? 
  is there some kind of protection or `` mafia '' - like structure protecting illegals and preventing others from going in ? 
  germany ? 
  the [ historical maps ] ( http://www.270towin.com/historical-presidential-elections/ ) are n't really indicating any big switch but it 's true that the southern states voted democrat consistently , except for that moment when goldwater was running as a republican . 
  it 's the similar thing to people looking back at history and being outraged they did n't have the same rights from the very foundation of the country . 
  one can argue that it * was * wrong there was separation after the slavery was abolished , but the `` they should have been given the same rights '' is ahistorical , because in that case africans would n't have been brought to america in the first place . 
  the original purpose was not to have a `` diverse citizenry '' , but to have slaves ... 
  `` my muslim faith '', 
  it 's a globalist jew conspiracy . 
  is n't there quite a big overlap in t_d and / pol / posters ? 
  i have n't ever seen `` stats '' though , it 's what some are saying . 
  are the parentheses actually bannable ? 
  have n't seen them in a while . 
   if there is a giant jew conspiracy to take over the world , i 'm not in on it !, 
  that 's what all of them say . 
  evereyone is in on the globalist conspiracy except you . 
  is he the second amendment person trump was talking about ? 
  it totally sounds like it 's two trolls talking . 
  i ca n't believe this is real . 
  edit : yes , it 's a repost from a [ few months back ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/duplicates/64y7ya/rredacted_are_now_openly_discussing_divide/ ), 
   will call him a good president while asking for hillary and obama to be jailed, 
   to be very pro-drumpf, 
   will start voting dems just to spite each other, 
   win over the fake subscribers, 
  how can you win over `` fake '' subscribers ? 
   attributing it to putin personally , people are getting baited, 
  i think i 've seen this already . 
  is n't it a pasta from a few months ago ? 
  no one is getting baited . 
  never even seen anything getting attributed to anyone . 
   rape their whores even if we have to join forces with isis, 
  definitely seen it here . 
  it 's trolling for sure . 
  it 's a [ repost from a few months ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/duplicates/64y7ya/rredacted_are_now_openly_discussing_divide/ ) , i think we did n't determine if they 're trolls . 
  but the `` join forces with isis '' , `` pro-drumpf '' , `` think trump is a good president and want hillary jailed '' -- it definitely sounds like trolling , no one in politics believes that someone who is not a conspiracy theorist thinks hillary did anything wrong . 
  i ca n't even imagine what is it like to be a woman wearing a tight hijab that has to cover * all * of your hair , covering your entire body except hands , because of irrational ingrained belief that you 're not allowed to leave home without this ( also possibly fear ) , when it 's over 30 \u00b0 c outside , like i have seen a few muslim women today , including an around ten years old girl . 
  that sounds like masochism . 
  sarcasm or confusion ? 
  i mean , i 'm pretty sure muslims did n't sent anyone into space . 
  that 's why the arab socialists and nationalists were mostly anti-islamic or non-religious , they believed in arab unification on national , not religious grounds , and thought islam was only hindering them . 
  not that they were wrong . 
  oh it makes sense now , i got confused . 
  it seemed weird to me you 'd call `` communism '' worse because they sent people to space , because that 's , unlike islam , a beneficial thing to do . 
  * it is certain that the_donald would run out of steam *, 
  * the trumpgret , among supporters who bought into his unrealizable promises , will set in soon *, 
  * what , does he have a magic wand ? 
  * trumpkins , prepare for the democratic landslide !, 
  * i think the republican party will never recover from this . 
  * after trump nomination , and his defeat in a democratic landslide , your kind will have to go into hiding because of the shame .
