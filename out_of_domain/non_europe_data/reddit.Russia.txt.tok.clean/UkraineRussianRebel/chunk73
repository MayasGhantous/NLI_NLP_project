  * this is the beginning of the end of the trump campaign . 
  they have no obligation to pay for experimental treatment in another country ( it 's not funded from their budget ) , but this situation is completely crazy . 
   i think it 's a little more nuanced than ` muh socialism ' . 
  it is much more nuanced but weirdly most people on here apparently think that public healthcare funded by the state excludes existence private healthcare , which is n't the case in any european country , britain , germany , france , all other countries have plenty of public hospitals and practices that are sometimes not even part of the state insurance system . 
  it 's a decision by the hospital that goes against the rights of parents and takes life of the child into its own hands that is the problem , not `` totalitarian socialistic healthcare . '', 
  but sometimes , you [ yell allahu akbar and get shot ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/10134553/jewish-man-shouting-allahu-akbar-shot-dead-at-jerusalems-western-wall.html ) . 
  edit : yeah ok this was intended to be a joke about that crazy guy , not to say that jews are somehow terrorists .

  no illegal is illegal , no undocumented is undocumented !, 
   what do we know about trump supporters online ? 
  *** they 're all men *** , they all wish they had huge dicks and more power , and they love the feeling of losing themselves within the mob . 
  therefore , i chose `` magatheroosterking . '' *** maga to show that i 'm fully in the tribe *** , rooster for the virile association with `` cock , '' and king to *** signal that i am a powerful alpha male *** with whom one should not trifle . 
  oh , if this is not an attempt at humor and hyperbole , they understand so , so little and are controlled by their unrealistic , manufactured stereotypes so much ... 
  edit : wait what , this was 13th of june and there are none of their posts in the `` day 1 '' , `` day 2 '' etc. 
  section , did they just give up writing and published a half-baked unifished article like that ? 
  i 'm wondering if that 's some kind of attempt at humor . 
  like , you know , when you hyperbolically try to portray some people as scary , horrible and make this kind of witty sarcastic mockery of them . 
  if not , i 'm sorry for the authors . 
  it 's still cringey anyway , but if they 're serious , it 's no wonder these people need safe spaces in real life . 
  they have been fearmongered so much . 
   this is classic msm spin . 
  trump does n't trust anyone but his longtime ally kasowitz, 
  oh well , infiltration failed , the `` trump does n't trust anybody but [ someone ] '' is a liberal trope , usually to make it seem like trump is a paranoid dictatorial type with his carefully selected confidant . 
   cucks gon na cuck . 
  not bad . 
  i 'd believe this was a pede . 
   due to our degeneracy , this would be impossible today . 
  it 's not * our * degeneracy , it 's * their * degenracy . 
  you get an f. 
   ** pc ** sarequitegood, 
  i know you are subtly trying to convert us to your pc culture , saying that it 's not * great * , that would be suspicious , but in this * it 's quite good , you should try * way , but we 're used and immune to this already . 
  this is why people do n't like feminists . 
  she thinks she is edgy , powerful and stronk , but in fact , going out of their way to prove how `` independent '' and `` creative '' they are , they 're just making other people shake their heads and roll their eyes in embarrassment and disbelief . 
  they can write a real article but it still contains fake news . 
  modern day presidential, 
  i thought so too , maybe they made it in a video that did n't display in the archive or something , nope , they just did n't write anything . 
  possible ~ ~ bernie ~ ~ trudeau fan !, 
  we believe obama is a muslim and not american , as true islamophobes and xenophobes it was our duty . 
  it 's just a part of our culture , they should learn to tolerate it and live with it . 
  charleston , sc, 
  we need to ban malls , the chance of being shot there is too big .

  \\ #resistcapitalism, 
   brick thrown through the front window , too, 
  instantly thought of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anyvpfbnbik ), 
  leftist epithets and labels they 're calling us are just a big non sequitur all the time now . 
  must be the intersectionality . 
  everything intersects with everything so they ca n't really tell what is what anymore . 
  [ relevant ] ( https://pics.me.me/the-modern-leftists-political-compass-authoritarian-left-right-libertarian-thoughts-13434902.png ), 
  the ~ ~ blackshirts ~ ~ trumpshirts are coming !, 
  guys at * the nation * are saying that the best way to celebrate 4th in a truly american way is to resist trump , saying that the society now is `` just like feudalism '' , the neo-feudalist congress and its leaders are acting like lackeys to the new self-proclaimed monarchy which has gained support among the people who `` believe in the natural order of the rulers and the rest , and trump gladly sees himself in the role of the emperor '', 
  i 'm not even kidding , they are saying that it 's `` elected monarchy , a democratically sanctioned authoritarianism '', 
  will someone think of the muslims ? 
  that 's why sky light pollution is a thing around the world , they 're trying to make it less black , it 's a systemic oppression around the world . 
  the only countries not giving in are north korea and [ most of africa ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/67/7e/6a/677e6aeb7504d29f1529aa56194c05a3.jpg ) . 
  notice how all the bright spots on the northern coast of africa are the cities where all the arab slave owners live !, 
  i believe that 's why hillary cancelled her fireworks before november 8 ? 
  336 people per square km , their birthrates are really low but it 's higher density than vast majority of countries , but someone people are already pushing the `` japan needs migrants '' line . 
  reminded me of [ * sit down ... go back to univision !,

  i fully expected a woman in hijab before expanding the picture . 
  #my eyes have seen the glory of the draining of the swamp, 
  it 's not if you 're blue pilled . 
  in fact , you see winning as losing in that instance , it warps your whole perception . 
  i do n't think i 've ever seen anyone being rude to children in my life , and i 'm honest . 
  there are a few people who disagree with this , but it 's mostly self-proclaimed progressives who want to force their kinks ( like `` trans '' thing ) on other people , and even if it 's really fringe , if you do n't like it , you 're a something - phobe . 
  but dark hair and dark eyes people are not all `` black '' ( in the sense of african ) . 
  there 's a ton of dark-haired , dark-eyed and even dark-skinned people who are not `` black people '' , europeans , indians , arabs , many hispanics etc. 
   because reasons, 
  because if you do n't get that trump is a dictator i do n't even have time to explain this to you !, 
  go back to the_donald !!!, 
  reeeeee, 
  that makes sense . 
  extremist feminists hate children . 
  i dread the day when the * gender * preference , sexual orientation , will be deemed bigotry . 
  the author 's name is adam gopnik, 
   adam gopnik , a staff writer , has been contributing to the new yorker since 1986 . 
  he is the author of `` the table comes first . '', 
  [ gopnik ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gopnik ) lol, 
  also , history books . 
  history books from [ 1930s and 1950s ] ( http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ncr.4110290523/abstract ) are absolutely different from the `` critical , unvarnishing '' history written by `` scholars '' today . 
  `` there was a demand for killing jews and hitler provided the supply . 
  this proves that capitalism and free market economy inevitably leads to genocide . '', 
  changed rus flair to 1776 for testing . 
  it 's glorious fellow caterpillars , now i feel like a true american comrade , blending in . 
  it 's because the russia thing is a nothingburger . 
  you can click edit flair on the sidebar ( next to username - edit ) , it 's like selecting a regular flair . 
  i just changed my russia flair to 1776 so i become a true caterpillar , did n't think of this option lol, 
  the answer to current year is 1776, 
  i 'm wondering what would happen if the white house channel allowed comments on their videos . 
   [ we have coast guard ] ( https://youtu.be/xbb9amgymos?t=40m55s ) * hehe *, 
  lmao, 
  i 've never been to the uk but this is my answer too . 
  there are a few `` fake '' fish and chips over here ( which i have n't tried either ) , would be interesting to taste if there 's a big difference from the original . 
  i am not upset even at the genocides . 
  in russia , it 's the same without the happy birthday song . 
  at least i hope , the last time someone tried singing it tome , it was super-cringe . 
  drumpf is done . 
  it 's over for him .
