  he is getting impeached any day now . 
  my eyes are literally bloodshot red from crying for the last hour , and i just threw up from the stress . 
  i ca n't believe we lost again . 
  the president sexually assaults people , the republican in montana bodyslams people , and this bitch in georgia refuses to let women with breast cancer get treatment . 
  and the worst part is people still vote for them !, 
  it 's happening . 
  we are in 1930s nazi germany . 
  we must resist . 
  what he is basically saying is that all that matters in a woman is what she looks like !, 
  typical condescending product of the patriarchy !, 
  this is why whenver i want to say stuff like , `` i live in city [ something ] and went to school near [ something ] '' on reddit , i just stop myself halfway and delete the comment before posting it . 
  it is absolutely not worth it because of people like those working at cnn . 
  they got a coerced apology from u/hanassholesolo . 
  they said he `` included anti-semitic and bigoted content '' among his posts , but knowing that anything is these days portrayed as `` bigoted and hateful '' by the left-wing media , i doubt he posted anything like that . 
  cnn is misinformation and propaganda . 
  unfortunately i 'm not american , but i will keep posting about \\ #cnnblackmail on twitter !, 
  there is a war on for your mind !, 
  it 's the reason why i never post anything that could hint at my location or identity on reddit , nothing more than country . 
  whenever i want to say something like `` oh , i live in [ some city ] '' , i just slap myself on the wrist and delete the comment . 
  u/hanassholesolo is now deleted , and i have no idea what he posted , but given what / pol / can find out , i just do n't risk it . 
  ( just in case trump retweets some of my posts and cnn starts tracking me down :p ), 
  [ another absolutely sincere , uncoerced , genuine apology and pledge not to ever repeat your `` high crimes ''  ( https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/01/world/01nkorea-web1/01nkorea-web1-master768.jpg ), 
  ah , so cnn surely does not bother to find out what r/imgoingtohellforthis is . 
  if he posted that stuff on t_d , that could have damaged our reputation ( of which we have none and are * the * worst place on the internet , if you read liberal media ) , but imgoingtohellforthis is specifically intended for terrible stuff , it 's not like people posting there are some kind of pariahs lol, 
  on the other side , it 's not like north koreans are hateful muslim terrorists , so while perhaps not cultural enrichment , it probably would n't be a big security threat - but definitely a strain on the economy and society . 
   rape-happy refugees, 
  idk , are north koreans rape happy ? 
  they seem to be a civilized ( in the sense of culture - high literacy and so on ) nation , but under a terrible , destructive leadership . 
  they still should n't threaten him `` unless he changes his behavior '' , it 's not like they 're his parents . 
  in general , being a vigilante `` morals-enforcer '' and tracking down people on a deliberately anonymous board like reddit is not a good thing to do . 
   i suppose you do n't agree with the criminal justice system then, 
  i do . 
  but cnn does n't have any of the powers of the criminal justice system , nor does it have any `` vigilante right '' of punishing someone . 
  i hope that by punishment you do n't mean a gang attack from someone like antifa . 
  now , i understand what you 're saying . 
  but all of the `` horrible offensive comments '' he posted were posted to subs like r/imgoingtohellforthis , `` edginess sub '' , not t_d , a political sub , which is apparently what many people assumed when reading about what he was posting . 
   trolls will have to be accountable for the bullshit they spew online, 
  yes , and this is what scares me . 
  the `` one correct worldview you are allowed to have '' , tracking down and publicly shaming people for expressing views that will already have you fired , from your job or from school . 
  uk is coming close to this , germany is already there with their `` offensive speech laws '' . 
  that 's why i am protesting what cnn is doing . 
  it could happen to anyone , if you ever find yourself on the side which is not at the moment `` popular '' or `` accepted '' . 
   eye bleeding , uncontrollable crying ,, 
  is that why my eyes are literally bloodshot red from crying for the last hour , and i just threw up from the stress . 
  i ca n't believe we lost again . 
  the president sexually assaults people , the republican in montana bodyslams people , and this bitch in georgia refuses to let women with breast cancer get treatment . 
  and the worst part is people still vote for them !, 
  it 's happening . 
  we are in 1930s nazi germany . 
  we must resist . 
  not modern liberal . 
  conservatives have just adopted most from that . 
  i do n't know if people are paying for transportation or not , but anyway , it 's not uncommon for governments to provide free transport for important nation events , and visit of an american president definitely is an important event . 
  but surely i ca n't vouch that they would do the same if clinton were president , but clinton would likely not even go to poland . 
  yeah , it 's just a translation from arabic . 
  found one of their [ other logos ] ( https://i.redd.it/ng5l0wuttt7z.png ) . 
  this is basically the case all over europe where university education is state-provided . 
  the more you pay , the more likely you will get a low-quality education ( and it 's pretty much impossible not to graduate ) intended for those who did not manage to get into competitive state schools . 
  any time , i 'm going next week lol, 
  actually , the us has a priority program for high-level professionals and `` accomplished artists '' , so , someone probably thinks art is useful . 
  now the condition is `` accomplished '' , so probably someone already well-known . 
  exactly . 
  but instead , it is treated that the `` worst off '' people should have the priority , not the ones with best capabilities and accomplishments , because the immigration system is being treated inherently as a charity for those who are `` not doing well '' , from all over the world . 
  is it not already waived for the entire eu ? 
  i thought it was . 
  la i do n't know , but as a non-american , i 'd definitely go to california , despite the extreme liberal leaning . 
  nice picture you have there , wan na bring it to the white house ? 
  lol , so these are actual words in poland ? 
  haha, 
  ready to deus vult . 
  are your eyes literally red and bloodshot from all the crying for the last hour ? 
  as a ( very moderate ) coffee drinker but no drugs and alcohol , i 'd like to believe that coffee is compatible with health , but i do n't know . 
  i did n't understand until i remembered about michael . 
  africans from deeply uncivilized countries are n't all that great either tbh . 
  but many of those are muslim as well , right . 
  poland is fairly different from western europe ( as is most of the central , eastern and the balkans ) , the western kind will be lost anyway . 
  but turks have always been independent in their own way , so they are apparently not under a big risk of `` cucking '' their own culture like western europe did . 
  this whole american designation , categorization and reduction of people into `` colors '' is pretty weird in general imho . 
  it does n't even really work in europe or asia , because each nation there is very diverse and different culturally and ethnically from one another . 
  saying europeans or east asians etc. 
  would be more correct than stuff like `` browns '' ( what is `` brown people culture '' liberals are talking about ? 
  is it india ? 
  or mexico ? 
  or pakistan ? 
  what if a light-skinned person gets tan lol ? ), 
  or `` yellows '' ( no one really uses that anymore ) or `` blacks '' when talking about africa etc. 
  they 're not pure nordic aryans that slavic filth !! 11 ! 1 !!!!!, 
  deep ~ ~ sea ~ ~ state forms of life, 
  cnn is not publishing u/psychoticgiraffe 's name because he is a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology , showed his remorse by saying he has taken down all his offending posts , and because he said he is not going to repeat this ugly behavior on social media again . 
  in addition , he said his statement could serve as an example to others not to do the same . 
  cnn reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change . 
  #the floor is salt, 
  before , not many were born to be warriors . 
  but internet made us all equal . 
  now , all of us can fight the meme wars . 
  if you touch t_d you become right-wing extremist by definition . 
  it all makes sense now . 
  i bet the deranged bernie suporter who stabbed the two guys in portland , and the other one , who shot scalise , were just a vast-right wing false flag conspiracy . 
  right now , it is cnn against the world !, 
  we stopped posting memes about cnn being fake news since they have begun reporting factual news .
