  we reserve the right to resume should any of that change . 
  there has never been something like the community of our two boards . 
  the world has never seen anything like that , and if do not prevail , there will never be something like that again . 
  we are a testimony to our commitment to the great alliance between the_donald and / pol / . 
  i think the 4chan logo is supposed to resemble a clover , because 4chan sounds a bit like `` fortune '' . 
  it 's a coincidence because `` clover '' , apparently , stands for ** c ** hild - ** lover ** in that other terminology . 
  i looked it up and the hearts do n't seem all that similar . 
  what i liked the most about his speech was the ( i assume , maybe i see just what i want to see ) is how he gradually unfolded that poland was defending its independence throughout history , is defending it today , and should serve as an example to those who want to start defending theirs now . 
  i see it as an endorsement of the polish resistance against the eu and their directions , criticism of and attempts to interfere with polish government which was elected by polish people specifically because it is patriotic and supports national sovereignty , attempts to force the refugees , immigrants and muslim terrorism on them . 
  i think and hope this may be the case : he went to poland , not to germany or france first , after all . 
  i ca n't even imagine what `` regular '' politicians would have been saying ? 
  like obama or clinton . 
  probably the classic `` poland is resurrecting the wave of dangerous populism and nationalism on a continent , we need to defend the liberal world order ! '', 
  like macaroni and merkel will be saying today at g20 meetings i am sure . 
  they were chanting both . 
  liberals keep talking about how `` the people were being bussed and paid for chanting and cheering '' on twitter . 
  unsrurprisingly , all of those people are american liberals , who clearly have no idea about central and eastern europe . 
  i thought he said patriots ? 
  someone like that could n't have come from the left . 
  it 's just * too offensive !, 
  * humor must be consored and approved first !, 
  better than being spiciness intolerant . 
   they do n't love our families as much as we love our families , they do n't love their religious institutions as much as we love ours, 
  oh , like flogging , wife-beating and honor executions ? 
  like terrorizing non-belivers for not being muslim ? 
  we * are * morally superior to you . 
  and obama . 
  but it 's not like we 're going to build roads just for obama when there are millions of oppressive men using roads along with him . 
  it 's just not worth it . 
  welfare recipients do n't need to go anywhere , welfare will be delivered to them , so they do n't need roads . 
  supposedly , the government did [ provide buses ] ( http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/welcome-trump-poland-taps-old-communist-party-playbook-n776186 ) for people to come to warsaw , but it 's not like they were paid , organized crowds that were brought in to make a fake perception , they were actual supporters . 
  i would n't go to pola ... 
  wait !, 
  i would go to poland . 
  because poland is still poland . 
  poland * is still poland . 
   plant playing the long con, 
  how would they know that trump would ever retweet a gif like that ? 
   hoping president trump would tweet it, 
  this is the most illogical thing about the whole theory for me . 
  even if we take the fairly outlandish possibility they somehow expected he could post it , why would he post an altered version , not the original gif , if that was the intention ? 
  could they know he would be looking for the original one with audio ? 
  there was quite a lot of jew-conspiracy from / pol / people and other stuff before , it seems the mods started enforcing rules more strictly , probably to avoid the fate of r/european and r/altright , when the whole thing with spez and other reddit admins threatening us with ban took place . 
  in addition , he posted in in r/imgoingtohellforthis , not on t_d -- i doubt cnn would have such a great interest in `` making us look bad '' , they hardly manage to tell the difference between reddit and a subreddit . 
   t_d is full of, 
  these guys ca n't tell the difference between reddit and subreddit , and until recently thought that 4chan is a hacker . 
  i do n't think they 're that interested in bringing a random ( to them ) board on the internet down . 
  and the account was , coincidentally , full of / pol / - like comments ? 
  too much coincidence , at least for me . 
  unless ... the white house already has meme r&d department / s, 
   i ca n't ( wo n't ) work, 
  i do n't want to !, 
  i am an agnostic ( but baptized russian orthodox ) and the same . 
  i think it 's impossible to * know * whether there is god ( but nothing wrong with believing ) , but i consider myself culturally christian . 
  also as others have said , christian values , the ten commandments in particular , are great guide of moral values for life . 
  i will just start calling myself alt-right and far-right , i guess . 
  they 're not making people look bad by calling them these labels as they 're hoping , but making those labels lose their `` negative power '' , they 're no longer smears but simply neutral descriptions : they now include people i support like orban , le pen , trump , farage , netanyahu , the polish patriots , and so on . 
  the regular , acceptable right , in the meantime ? 
  no one really to admire . 
  i used to be a normal person but now i am a terrible bigot . 
  it 's like i 'm standing in one place and these people are moving left on a moving walkway . 
  or floating away on those packs of ice . 
  really ? 
  mine increase 1776 %, 
  [ meanwhile in germany ] ( http://ukbuzz.wordpress.eurosport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/08/cnp3zvqwgaafxw6-1170x658.jpg ), 
  not polish but from experience ( travelled there a few times ) most do . 
  i believe that like in most of europe , they 're learning that in school , so among young people it 's ubiquitous . 
   students in polish schools typically learn one or two foreign languages . 
  generally , in 2005/06 the most popular obligatory foreign languages in polish schools were : english -- 67.9 % , german -- 33.3 % , french -- 13.3 % , spanish -- 10.2 % , russian -- 6.1 % , italian -- 4.3 % , latin -- 0.6 % , and others -- 0.1 % . 
   due to the education reform introduced by polish education minister -- katarzyna hall , students of polish lower secondary schools must learn two different foreign languages . 
  the first foreign language ( usually english ) is taught three times a week . 
  the second foreign language is taught two times a week and it is additional . 
  `` we need to recruit more muslims for our masjid . '', 
  someone still thinking muslims are going to integrate and not establish a parallel society with the ultimate aim of establishing their superior , divine , as they believe religion and law ? 
  what 's the verification process for twitter ? 
  you request it yourself or do they identify accounts that could possibly be faked ? 
  if the former it 's possible he just did n't request verification . 
  putin [ is not verified as well ] ( https://twitter.com/putinrf_eng ) despite over 600k followers , nor the [ russian account ] ( https://twitter.com/putinrf ) with over 2 million . 
  the second is an official account of the presidential office ( kind of like the white house account ) , while the first one is the personal one . 
  but it 's still weird it 's not verified . 
  following advice from comments below :, 
  #linda sarsour is a terrorist, 
  she is a, 
  #sharia law supporter, 
  #sharia law is [ misunderstood ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/c2wiwxmukaaui7v.jpg:large ), 
  edit : [ * wait what ? 
  * ] ( http://archive.is/ve9e4 ) she would n't like poland so much these days , they 're standing up to islamic invasion !, 
   she also urged them to donate to dr. abdul el-sayed , a democrat who is running for governor in michigan , and would be that state 's * first muslim governor * . 
  she attacked `` establishment democrats '' who , she said , had blocked muslims from * succeeding within the democratic party in the past * , and said that el-sayed would change that . 
  they really want an islamic front inside the us . 
  ca n't do violent jihad now , so they will try `` we are peaceful , for now '' kind of expansion .

  high energy, 
  we all know polish people supported german nazis all the way , so now they 're doing the same with another - you guessed it - descendant of germans , drumpf !, 
  is la safer than english countryside ? 
  add some cnn and cash in your $ 20 000 . 
  and you would still have voted for collusion , here is putin [ giving her instructions ] ( https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2016_30/1639641/160726-putin-hrc-apec-mbe-422p_76560162e30c1c7d83c6e89a8c8508e3.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg ) !!!!!,
