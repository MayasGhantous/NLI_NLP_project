  antifa , after all , originated in germany . 
  of course they 're the best at disruptive , violent protests . 
  it 's west berlin culture . 
  but they 're doing it for climate justice . 
  you can destroy a little bit of climate in the name of progress , no ? 
  al-hamburgad , one of the largest cities of bundeskhalifat deutschlandistan . 
  high quality . 
  j'ai l'impression d'exploser . 
  one scoop . 
  little bites !, 
  every russian is working for putin , except me . 
  i 'm russian , no , we do n't . 
  but [ this ] ( https://antimaidan.ru/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/news/713315928_18394_3265768844716507581.jpg?itok=5m5nujwi ) was done to a car of a guy who was running for mayor in one town , who is very anti-putin and some are accusing him of `` working for the department of state '' and being an `` american plant . '', 
   kids bum rushed me for an autograph ( ... ), 
  * is this guy famous ? 
   and i am a nobody construction worker . 
   then later confessed it had been rat . 
  ick . 
  she thought she was doing me a great favor . 
  to be fair to me , i had no idea rats could get that big, 
  i 'm not disputing your stories but this is so weird . 
  where did you go in russia and how did you get invited to schools etc. ? 
  i somehow ca n't imagine having such a reaction to just an `` ordinary '' person visiting my school and it being like that just because he 's foreign lol . 
  also i do n't think i 've ever heard of people eating rats in russia ( except for the theoretical possibility of the person in question being homeless ), 
  it 's not that surprising from the likes of mccain , graham , rubio , sasse etc. 
  it seems to me ( just observing from outside ) that many american politicians * really * enjoy this tough-guy image posturing . 
  like the bomb-bomb-bomb iran thing from mccain . 
  it 's kind of difficult to take the so-called neocons ( neo-neocons ? ), 
  seriously these days because it just appears to be a race of who says the more `` though/edgy '' thing , be it `` le ` ts just end assad '' or `` it 's time to end iranians right now '' . 
  trump is one of the most famous businessmen in america , kind of an american business and success icon , who has writen several well-accepted and praised books , now he 's treated as if he were feebleminded and insane by liberals , and the politicians with whom he was in contact throught all the time before he actually went into politics . 
  it 's weird that she would be a democratic `` informant in russia '' , as the screenshot in this post suggests , because she is a legit , registered lawyer . 
  i wish i could to research on this level , and connect the dots like this . 
  it 's interesting how just hours after the veselnitskaya news broke , the people around t_d have already found info that * possibly * implicates her as a democrat `` operative '' ( though for me it 's kind of hard to imagine since she 's a legit lawyer in russia , and connections to foreign governments and political parties on this level usually raise suspicious here quickly enough . ), 
  and dug up the connection to fusion gps etc. 
  impressive . 
   had to sign in, 
  hahaha , i 'm always irrationally irritated at when i click upvote but i 'm not signed in and the reddit pop-up appears asking you to log in . 
  politico reported that the white house has a `` media team '' and staffers some of whom are known to have browsed ( and probably still are ) on t_d . 
  the article is called `` world war meme '' . 
  will find link . 
   installed by the russians, 
  as a russian , it is weirdly flattering that many americans , including those in positions of power and the guys with phds who should probably know better , believe our secret services , `` propaganda and disinformation '' and `` fake news spread via facebook '' are so sophisticated we can just `` install '' a president to our liking and `` hack elections '' , but at the same time , wtf . 
  i now know how jews feel being accused of a global conspiracy and controlling everything lol . 
  it 's really insult to american voters if they 're being told by their representatives they 're incapable of choosing a candidate unless told by some `` russians '' whom to vote for , but really they 're just saying americans supposed to choose from the `` correct '' candidates on a list they approve , not people `` like trump '' . 
  i did n't believe you at first but he actually [ appeared on isis video giving them an interview ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/videos/politics/2017/04/30/john-mccain-full-sotu-intv.cnn ) , wtf, 
  and the russian `` kremlin lawyer '' actually does n't work for the russian government . 
  `` sorry i got caught ! '', 
  if you were n't a conservative , you would n't get shot . 
  if you were n't a jew , you would n't go to a concentration camp . 
  if you did n't own private property , you would n't have had it confiscated by the maoist/stalinist government . 
  if you were n't christian , you would n't be beheaded by isis . 
  if you did n't insult prophet muhammand , you would n't have gotten attack by an islamic terrorist . 
  easy . 
  do n't represenatives ( do n't know about state ones ) have an immunity against prosecution for what they 're saying ( and things otherwise criminal , misdemeanors etc. 
  as well ) ? 
  i thought americans ( politicians and experts , to be more precise ) do n't really like china all the much and see it as an `` emerging threat '' ? 
  do n't get me wrong , china i think is an awesome country culturally but my belief was there was kind of an [ `` unspoken '' ] ( http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/congage-china/ ) low-intensity cold-warish rivalry between us and china , like the disputes in the [ south china sea ] ( http://www.news.com.au/world/asia/china-warns-of-devastating-consequences-if-us-blocks-its-plans-for-artificial-islands/news-story/2e2680d5b156cca148a5634a18354989 ) , attempts to make blocks of southeast asian countries that are perceived as `` containment '' of china etc. 
   filter the internet, 
  on a related note , just to vent my frustration , i 'm russian living in europe but i 'm in russia right now . 
  archive.is is blocked and banned here for whatever reason . 
  dafuuuq , i ca n't read the spiciest news on t_d now , must figure out how that vpn thing chinese are using works lol, 
  probably something about china oppressing dalai-lama and the falun gong guys , so by association , trump is china-style dictatorial wannabe communist emperor . 
   every time mccain visits syria there is a chemical attack, 
  damn assad , ca n't get him any time he 's there !, 
  it 's the white stripes on pavement ones . 
  majority of crosswalks all over the world are like that . 
  that 's a testimony to the oppressive omnipresence of heteronormativity and oppression of sexual minorities . 
  `` the floor is sodomy ! '', 
  * muslims, 
  what 's crazy is that `` identity politics '' is a legitimate reason for spending $ 200,000 , from public funds . 
  it 's part of the reason why american colleges are so extremely expensive : there is no limit to `` bloating '' with useless `` diversity , tolerance , acceptance '' programs and offices , instead of just keeping staff that is essential for actual learning , teaching and research , there are `` diversity officers '' paid $ 400k a year . 
  was hernandez paint `` documented '' or `` sanctuary '' ? 
  #kek lives matter, 
  \\ #freekekistan, 
  no subreddit has ever been treated worse or more unfairly as the_donald . 
  what 's actually bad about net neutrality ? 
  does a lack of net neutrality really mean a `` several speed lanes '' internet where providers can set how quickly websites are loading - and which ones at which speed - instead of all being given the same speed ? 
  based on certain companies being able to pay to isps to make their sites load faster . 
  `` if someone banned the nsdap before they came to power , there would have been no ww2 , holocaust and nazism , and the_donald is basically extremist right and drumpf is literally hitler so we have to punch them and bash the fash '', 
  * redacted and spez, 
  russia can still win if trump is not in-peached now !, 
  in-peach , in-peach , in-peach !, 
  we do n't talk about that one here . 
  never . 
  chew soap !, 
  b-b-ut spez is just censoring the dangerous trumpist radical right !!!, 
  but he 's censoring reddit and it 's a private company , but you are obliged to bake the cake or you 're intolerant , it 's different for us on the left because donald trump is a threat to our democracy ( reeeee ) and tolerance in america but america is oppressive to immigrants , it 's terrible if immigrants ca n't come illegally because no person is illegal and it 's not who we are we ca n't just ban people but america has never been great for anyone and it 's not great now but how can we ban muslims muslims will make america great again not trump but trump 's wife is slovenian , she has to go , she 's an immigrant , it does n't matter if they do n't speak english you bigot ... haha melania barely speaks english , why is she even in america , and his son met the russian lawyer from the kremlin . 
  yes , i know , the cnn guy did say the whole russia thing is a nothingburger but it 's only because the trump family utilized the connections in russia and cnn is now being threatened by the russians !!, 
  [ well ... ] ( https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/54122/orthodox-cathedral.jpg?w=760&amp;h=507&amp;l=50&amp;t=40 ), 
  maybe . 
  what kind of uniforms are those ? 
  that might suggest something . 
  comments below they say that 's american families of diplomats . 
  but no reports of paris being burned down and looted by antifa and muslims , unlike g20 hamburg , so it could be called a success for france already lol, 
  this is what they cook in isis land . 
  it 's a local culinary speciality . 
  my public speaking teacher once asked in high school : `` what makes obama a great , inspirational speaker ? '', 
  i said `` teleprompter '' lol, 
  fortunately she was not an obama-fanatic haha, 
  as a russian , i was very worried clinton might win in the end , because she seemed like a real , unstable lunatic .
