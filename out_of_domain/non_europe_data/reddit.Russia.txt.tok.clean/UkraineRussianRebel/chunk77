  but then i remembered how corrupt she is , so there maybe was n't a reason to be afraid , she 'd just sell us some more uranium . 
  but what if you 're non-binary , what now ? 
  a friend of my family lives in germany , refugees get subsidized ( = completely free for them ) housing in good areas , large flats , everything free , get food , stuff like fridges provided by the government and furniture . 
  meanwhile most germans have no chance of getting their own house because of the insane property prices . 
  cities like munich are slowly becoming unlivable . 
  germany has one of the lowest homeownership rates in europe . 
  `` i ca n't afford kids '' must be one of the saddest things i have heard . 
  having a family and your own posterity of one of the fundamental things in life . 
  looks like you 've had too much to think !, 
  even if the wall is inclined there is no need for it to be a `` ramp '' . 
  this guy should try better imagination of what the structure may look like to be both a wall and serve the second purpose . 
  choosing between illegals being able to come and getting one of the largest renewable energy programs ? 
  tough choice for them . 
  10 feet higher, 
  everyone is supposedly originally from africa ( though there are different theories too ) , so we are all kangz who have ever lived , we 're all african , our lives matter , it 's ancestry of all of us !, 
  we write symphonies !, 
  * akchually ... *, 
  most iranians are pretty based . 
  definitely more than pro-hijab , pro-islam , pro-oppression western feminists . 
  i 've read this but the un fortunately does not have any power to enforce or impose this , since it 's composed of the member countries . 
  it 's a theory . 
  the un in general has a tendency to disregard anything related to national cultures , they only care about `` transactions '' regardless of context : population is decreasing in japan , so let 's put some several million muslims there . 
  they formally ca n't care about differences among people . 
  only insane countries like germany , france and uk are apparently following this plan , it 's not happening in the us , russia or japan . 
  ( actually both the us and russia currently have a naturally growing population , and japan is fairly overpopulated , and russia and japan have programs for increasing domestic birthrates . ), 
  addition : of the listed countries only the european ones ( germany is missing from the list , but they are totally following the plan ) are doing that . 
  so europeans are self-genociding and cheering that as tolerance . 
  whenever there are suggestions to make programs to increase european birthrates , feminists start yelling that it 's `` incubatorizing women '' , for whatever reasons , european elites agree with them and quickly shut up . 
  why someone is letting leftist ideologues define `` increasing birthrates '' and purely a `` sexual '' thing and frame it in a feminist context is beyond me - when in fact it means supporting traditional family ( which feminists also hate though ) . 
  vast majority of population growth will take place in undeveloped , third world countries in africa . 
  civilized countries ( on the `` high-end '' of civilized ) like western europe , japan , korea are a tiny minority in the sea of `` not so advanced '' people . 
  fortress europe is absolutely necessary unless one wants to drown in the coming `` scramble for prosperity '' as millions of migrants from these countries keep coming . 
  contrary to what liberals believe about apparently miraculous source of prosperity in europe , it only exists because europeans created it . 
  bring too many migrants and it 's over . 
  it will be just like the places they left . 
  this is priceless . 
  yeah , why would we think macron is suddenly `` based '' because he is trying very hard to `` suck up '' to trump ( remember g20 family photo ) ? 
  it 's just the kind of personality he has . 
  and as you said - chips , still condescending . 
  or possibly it 's like : oh , american , come to mcdonald 's , i hear you love mcdonald 's over there lol, 
  this is a great irony of people with phds living in the midst of their `` economic and social models '' and `` robust research '' , probably having forgotten what the words `` model '' and `` theory '' mean - by definition and imprecise , generalized assumption about the real world . 
  i was using the definition of theory from kenneth waltz 's [ theory of international politics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/theory_of_international_politics ) he may be wrong of course , theory there is explained as necessarily having non-factual assumptions which are filling the `` blank spaces '' as a complement to empirical facts . 
  people are thus often confusing theory ( assumption + facts ) for simply accumulation of facts . 
  if theory is `` absolutely correct '' , why do economists still disagree about different theories ? 
  this suggests that theory is more than just facts , it 's about what those facts are explaining . 
  can confrim , an colluding with russia . 
  it 's interesting that many people apparently think that being a `` billionaire '' or `` millionaire '' means having that amount in cash , not vested in the property one owns . 
  it would be quite silly to keep that amount of money non-invested . 
  on another site they were discussing the meeting between don jr. and the russian property developer agalarov , after which don jr. said russians bought a lot of property from trump 's companies in the us . 
  supposedly it now `` all makes sense '' and trump is `` beholden to putin '' because `` russians bought his property ! '', 
  and `` he made a lot of money on that '' . 
  do they think russians ca n't buy houses without putin 's personal permission ? 
  lol apparently trump is not a puppet of just russia , but almost every government of every country in the world if they think business works like this : he has hotels and projects virtually everywhere . 
  why is swedish government infested with islamophobic xenophobes ? 
  will post a picture here if i go to nyc lol, 
  back when iran and afghanistan were nice countries with girls on the beach [ wearing bikini ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/7e/96/00/7e9600655c085d942c632072637b3f9f--iran-today-iranian-women.jpg ) ( not burkini ) . 
  [ limpopo ] ( https://www.knigosvet.com/img/w800/312155.jpg ) is a fictional country ( name probably taken from that river ) from a russian fairy tale , and [ aibolito ] ( http://ejka.ru/uploads/images/3/c/e/2/8/badc502262.jpg ) is a doctor who was healing animals there . 
  also : [ this appeared in a newspaper ] ( https://cdn1.img.ria.ru/images/148796/92/1487969287.jpg ) after the prank lmao, 
   they 've never heard this message before which blows my mind . 
  seriously , this does sound crazy . 
  how can you never hear this `` message '' - or think about it yourself ? 
  it 's not like i 've been specifically told `` you can be what you want to be and be a productive member of society '' because this sounds like common sense kind of implicitly understood by everyone . 
  ahaha , i 'm not american and sometimes the beliefs , reactions and arguments of people even on places like askreddit just seem so otherwordly to me . 
  it 's a double culture shock , but then reddit is one of the most leftist , `` progressive '' forums out there so it 's something we have to deal with . 
  the non-the_donald redditors apparently seems to believe they are some kind of intellectual vanguard of science and socially `` correct '' beliefs . 
   betanomics, 
  kek, 
  pics , or it did n't happen !, 
  b-b-but the south still loves confederacy and trump has awoken the tradition of slave-owning and nazis and fascists so amendment is within realm of possibility and do n't forget that drumpf is literally dictator so he will bypass congress and make the amendment in the form of executive order , everyone is itching to have a slave do n't forget !!!, 
  it 's funny because they 're probably serious about it , yet it 's just so ridiculous . 
  democrats did n't invent slavery . 
  it has existed ( in america ) long before democrats were a thing . 
  but they fought against abolishing it . 
  what is happening to american prestigious media ? 
  i used to read nyt , wapo , time a lot , now breitbart seems more reputable and much more reasonable , with less propaganda and bias , than the `` reputable '' news sources . 
  one liberal has made the argument that `` tokyo does n't have terrorism because japan did not invade the middle east , so no muslims are carrying out terror attacks there . '', 
  but if they did invade the me , there would still be no muslims to terrorize tokyo `` in revenge '' , right ? 
  it 's like the the gaussian distribution . 
  no terror in small cities , no terror in the huge cities , it 's all cumulating in `` big cities '' in the middle of the curve . 
  tokyo had a sarin attack in 1995 , this proves that it 's absolutely incorrect to say that muslims are terrorists or are a greater threat because so far 100 % of terror attacks in japan were perpetrated by non-muslims . 
  we should not profile . 
  by worse , he probably means that if they make us mad , we can defend ourselves . 
  we can be as strong and violent as muslims in self-defense , while in western europe they just bend in front of them . 
  it 's about cumulation . 
  if you have a tiny amount of muslims in your country , it 's usually not a threat . 
  they work , they have kebab stands and so on . 
  when it reaches a `` critical mass '' , beyond control , it 's where it gets dangerous . 
  yes . 
  it 's the non-muslim terrorist coefficient . 
  it 's a liberal-multiculturalist invention . 
  `` badness '' of a terror attack commited by a non-muslim is multiplied by the coefficient , the magnitude of which depends on the amount of muslims in your country and the amount of non-muslim attacks . 
  so if you have hundreds of muslim attacks and one non-muslim , then obviously the coefficient is massive so liberals can say that it 's `` just as bad '' and `` islam is not a problem '' . 
  me too !, 
  i see an obvious pattern , it obviously has nothing to do with muslims and islam !, 
  london - english people, 
  paris - le pen nationalists, 
  rome - ??? 
  cairo - tourists , probably, 
  damascus - assad, 
  jerusalem - radical jewish zealots,
