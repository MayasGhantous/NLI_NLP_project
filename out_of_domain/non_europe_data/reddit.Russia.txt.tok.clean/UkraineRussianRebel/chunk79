  my eyes are literally red and bloodshot from crying for the last hour . 
  i ca n't handle all this . 
  i 'm done . 
  we are in 1930s nazi germany . 
  we must resist .

  [ receiving instrucions from putin ] ( https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/washingtonpost/2016/07/05/national-security/images/aptopix_russia_apec_0cd1b-qreg-0469.jpg?t=20170517 ), 
  collusion !, 
  lock her up !, 
  proponents of the russia theory have a convoluted theory that there was a `` treasonous american '' who was approached by russians , who have obtained the emails from hacking , since they do not have a `` sophisticated knowledge of the american political system '' , to learn how to use those emails and when to give them to wikileaks to cause `` maximum damage to hillary '' from him . 
  why do you need `` russia '' in that theory , it 's redundant , when you may explain by an insider american , who has worked for the democrats , had access to the mail , knew the american system intimately , and what would do maximum damage . 
  and his name was ... 
  totalitarianism without it being formally established . 
  people voluntarily use all those services , and unfortunately there are hardly any alternatives of equal quality . 
  it wo n't work . 
  you need a muslim ban . 
  most muslims do n't come in through the southern border . 
  the wall is against cartels and illegals . 
  could n't they somehow build it inside of a country ? 
  like , if they win elections in france ? 
  and that 's in kansas !, 
  are there no sane places in the us , even the conservative ones sounds `` cucked '' sometimes . 
   i have a hard time with inviting anyone who would support such an anti-feminist ( ... ) anti-immigrant , and *** anti-climate change *** fascist such as trump . '', 
  i thought liberals were against climate change ? 
  what is distrubring is that they * still * did n't stop . 
  it 's just getting more intense . 
  while at the same time , trump supporters ( those who drink ) probably celebrated , and some have certainly used smirnoff !, 
  it 's a win-win . 
  i was reading a lot about companies like google , facebook etc. 
  and thought it would be great to work there , but then you realize that their `` culture '' is just as repressive as the one prevalent in colleges . 
  corporate political correctness and `` ethics '' is no different , they just have a greater discretion in firing you for disagreeing than a college would . 
  in theory , this is what private companies should be able to do , since free market etc. , you have freedom of expression , not obliging others not to react to it , but how do you reconcile those principles with the fact that the company culture has now become extremely discriminatory and totalitarian ? 
  it was n't supposed to be this way . 
  russia - 4 % chance of being toxic ,, 
  russians - 34 % , china and chinese - both 6 % ,, 
  seems like americans do n't dislike us all that much lol, 
  meanwhile , `` republican '' is five times more likely to be `` toxic '' than `` democrat '' - 5 % and 1 % respectively . 
  trump is 17 times more likely than hillary - 17 against 1 . 
  really , just 17 % ? 
  when has talking about trump outside of pro-trump sites not been incendiary ? 
  fascist has a 95 % chance , while communist is just 44 % ? 
  does that mean liberals are more incendiary in calling us fascists than we are when we call them communists ? 
  are they not complicit to the left-wing culture of their company ? 
  i do n't know , just assuming . 
  could it really happen independently ? 
  consider the starbucks ceo and his beliefs and campaigns . 
  `` thoughting as a way of trolling people has been on the rise lately . 
  is the teen culture becoming more intolerant ? '', 
  -- media in near future, 
  but he 's russian !, 
  that proves islam has nothing to do with terror , other people are terrorists too !, 
  ( ignore the fact he is muslim and it is islam , not his russian ethnicity or nationality , that led him to consider that ), 
  kim jong-un has threatened to strike american islands and territory , what 's the problem with responding with similar threats ? 
  he has not said that america will invade north korea as the first party , but as a response to further threats and aggression . 
  i 'm russian , sure , he does have a caucasian islamic name . 
  what i meant is that in descriptions they will possibly disregard the fact he is islamic for the fact he is russian . 
  people from those areas do look quite different from slavic russians but in general there is a great variance in complexions , and some chechens look [ like this ] ( http://u.foto.radikal.ru/0704/1e/f95e467a16bd.jpg ) ( as is among slavic russians , those in the south look quite different from those in the northwest etc. , some look more `` asian '' ), 
  it 's on the first pages of russian msm right now but sure , it 's not an important enough incident to be reported internationally ( now if he succeed though - hopefully nothing like that will happen though lol , they would need a * very * different kind of a drone ), 
  pizza related handkerchiefs and yoga related emails . 
  i do n't know , why would anyone think there 's something suspicious ? 
  funny , i actually like it . 
  kind of like `` tiny trumps '' . 
  do they still do n't understand these things are n't actually offensive ? 
  commenting to bring attention to the fact that the oppressed people of kekistan * still * do not have a country of their own , a place they could call home , and their culture is being repressed . 
  \\ #freekekistan \\ #keklivesmatter, 
  my personal opinion is that out of all kinds of violence , not using `` preferred pronouns '' is most similar to rape and genocide . 
  it 's literally a genocide against people of non-binary identities , it is a repression of their individuality and denial of their objective existence by the systems of heteronormative hierarchies of supermacy and standardization , which are further reinforced by intersectional narratives of patronymic defaultization through transnational representative nuances of capitalist exploitative practices of neocolonialist post-normative pseudo-oligarchies via the patterns of social stratification , which eventually lead to problematization of feminist theories in the general society . 
  ~ ~ under budget , ~ ~ ahead of schedule . 
  if john ossoff loses , he wins !, 
   if we cut off funding to sanctuary cities and states . 
  enough for them to fund free college and public healthcare for themselves ? 
  they keep voting `` against their interest '' , as they say , without spending on illegals , `` diversity programs '' , other useless stuff , and used welfare carefully only on those who actually need it , they could 've actually had the social systems they desire . 
   rude to us when we took a child into restaurants, 
  very sad . 
  `` do it !, 
  i 'll write a you a check right now . 
  look at me , do it ! '', 
  never argue with a pede , they will fool you into trying to meme and then beat you by their experience . 
  trump has been an embarrassment , now way he will win a second term . 
  * wins second term *, 
  it 's funny that russian msm ( not the news , which was just covering what happened , but the opinion part ) was saying that either trump or bernie would be the `` winning candidate '' because americans are `` tired of established politicians with unoriginal rhetorics and will opt for something new '' , and when it was clearly trump vs. clinton , they were less certain but still regarded trump as the `` more likely to win since clinton has tainted herself enough , while trump is politically incorrect , authentic and spontaneous , which is what americans love , and he is also an icon of american business success '', 
  it seemed like a bit simplistic view to me since they did n't account for and write about the immense amount of pro-clinton liberals all that much , but it turned out to be correct . 
  `` it 's not rigged , you just lost ! '', 
  -- when they say it 's because `` russia hacked the election '' and muh popular vote, 
  from what i understood it measures what comments are likely to make a discussion toxic . 
  in this sense , they 're not wrong . 
  posting something like this will get a crowd of sjws instantly attacking you for being a `` transphobic heteronormative bigot '' , making the thread toxic . 
  the psychopath part is absolutely on point . 
  that video of her laughing about it is one of the most horrifying things . 
  she is unstable , imagine a person like that having us military at her disposal . 
  but someone says that trump is the dangerous one , because he goes off script in speeches and says unorthodox things , which is apparently a sign of a `` mental illness '' , while hillary is capable of reading what she has written on paper , which apparently proves that she 's not `` mentally ill '' or dangerous . 
  even if the paper said said '' [ we will obliterate iran ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htbdfccqdns ) '', 
  do you ever feel , feel so paper thin, 
  like a house of cards, 
  one blow from caving in, 
  it 's almost like they do n't know what the words mean anymore . 
  like they do n't have any definitions or meanings , no word is too strong , too weak , inappropriate , not fitting the situation or just not making any sense in the context ? 
  it 's literally genocide , denial of existence , violence , fearing for safety . 
  what did he say that would make anyone `` fear for their safety '' ?
