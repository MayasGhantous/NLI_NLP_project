  it 's the [ current month ] of the [ current year ] , and they 're * still * following the same story . 
  sadly people need to prove themselves that they 're `` championing diversity '' . 
  * no , no , i 'm not a traitor , or a thought criminal , i am a loyal supporter of the party , really !, 
  i 'd still call them ctrl-left . 
  you do n't become citizen or a national of a country just because you moved there or came to visit . 
  just wait till western europe gets taken over by muslims and will have similar laws to saudi arabia and a society like algeria . 
  not great if you 're a woman , or someone not willing to ajdust to islamic laws . 
  hope you 're somewhere in poland or the baltics , it will be fine over there . 
  other than that i agree , as someone living in europe i think it 's preferable to america especially due to healthcare and education costs . 
  [ paris suburbs ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jun/01/calais-paris-france-street-harassment-women-migrants-la-chapelle-refugees ) are a testimony to what [ could happen ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/759995/north-african-youth-gangs-chinese-migrants-paris ) on a larger scale . 
  the immigration rates from mostly muslim societies are staggering ( hundreds of thousands per year ) . 
  no assimilation is taking place , as they 're merging into their already established communities , not into our society . 
  it is . 
  europe is great . 
  it 's what most rioters do . 
  looting stores ? 
  `` uuuuh you benefited from slaveryyy evil capitalist !!!, 
  i have a right to that stuff you exploited meee , g20 is an evil oppressive organization '', 
  * antifa guy or blm protester who never created anything in their life or really worked at all, 
  extreme left and the neo-nazis have been clashing for decades in the us and western europe , look at the extreme left destruction and looting at g20 in hamburg , it is only given so much attention now because it is politically expedient against trump , they 're continuing the campaign against trump and trump supporters like they did before the election . 
  these counter-protesters also riot standalone , it 's also a violent radical group , they just had an opposing side this time , so there was a fight . 
  antifa is a disease as well . 
  they do not belong into normal society , in absence of `` nazis '' they 're behaving even worse , attacking people , looting stores , destroying buildings , in general being anti-social . 
  it 's a bad argument . 
  we should ban the religion of peace as well if this is a criterion ... in fact , it should have been banned long ago , like antifa and the nazis . 
   antifa are anarchists, 
  why is that any better ? 
  their methods are just like the `` fascism '' : attacking people , making threads and intimidating , but they do it more often and are more relevant and powerful . 
  also , their definition of `` fascist '' is extremely nebulous , everyone standing up to them becomes a `` fascist '' . 
  that 's a common perception if you stand at an extreme : everyone else looks like an extermist . 
  at least the `` fascists '' do not justify looting with `` fighting against injustice '' and `` exploitative capitalism '' . 
  unlike antifa . 
  from post history :, 
   serving with the syrian army, 
   not offended by `` radical islamic terrorism '' at all . 
  if anything , i think it 's something that needs to be recognized and exterminated . 
  apparently she supports the side of the syrian regular military and government , not the muslim terrorists and `` pro-democracy insurgents '' , as the west calls them ( = islamists ) , so this does not disprove my argument . 
  she is not siding with the violent islam . 
  why do you think i have nazi friends lol ? 
  you 're right , i have not , but antifa is definitely more destructive in practice . 
  places do n't look like warzones after neo-nazi gatherings . 
  both groups are fringe and extreme . 
  finally someone who gets it . 
  because palestinians are attacking innocent jews in terror attacks and israel is defending itself , i 'd say that 's why it 's not accurate . 
   ( id like evidence ), 
  [ hamburg g20 ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2017/07/07/europe/g20-hamburg-protests/index.html ) , berkeley riots , may day riots in paris every year, 
   want to bring back the third reich, 
  sure . 
  it 's a ridiculous fringe group that can want anything they wish . 
  they ca n't really * achieve * what they want . 
  it 's not like the bolsheviks did n't have labor camps for perceived capitalists and class enemies ( extreme left ) , both nazis and antifa are complete trash . 
  but antifa is more frequently visible and more normalized . 
  i have no more a reason to justify a violent anti-social `` anarchist '' group than neo-nazis . 
   this does not include shields and helmets . 
  does it include baseball bats and stones ? 
  to every `` assembly '' where two radical groups meet , both sides usually come armed in expectation that the other side will start an attack ( or to gain an edge , but no one really expects the other side to be peaceful ) , eventually , this is what happens : they see each other armed , and they hate and despise each other . 
  that 's why deconfliction teams from the police are always present , even at `` peaceful '' assemblies - it can very easily turn violent . 
   antifas end goal is basically being a swedish socialist society, 
  their actual behavior is not at all conductive to this goal . 
  perhaps joining some left-wing but non-fringe , non-radical political party , not rioting , not hating `` exploitative capitalist pigs '' , yelling that `` all cops are bastards '' and `` f * ck the system '' and despising everything normal , ordered society stands for , would be better . 
  same must be done with radical left . 
  if all bolsheviks had been defeated at the very beginning no terror of bolshevism would have happened . 
  i am talking about the neo-nazis , not the actual historical nazis in germany . 
  of course , antifa is utterly insignificant compared to literal hitler and the nsdap ... 
  it 's because people are well-aware of the existence of neo-nazis but neobolsheviks are rarely ever spoken about . 
  this issue needs to be brought to light more often . 
  i am against nazis but not with antifa . 
  i prefer they keep destroying each other . 
  i want to save europe . 
  possibly we may have it a bit easier doing here because they ca n't really go `` uhhh but you stole the land from native ___ , it 's not your land , you do n't decide who comes in '' hah , we 're the natives here , we can decide that we want to keep the land not taken over by islam , a religious ideology that has taken over christian north africa , islamized the ancient cultures in the middle east , and has been assaulting europe since 721 . 
  hopefully americans will be able to save america , american culture and way of life . 
  okay , i am an immigrant myself , but i am absolutely pro-europe and pro-europeans ... liberals here are telling i should n't feel this way because `` i 'm a foreigner '', 
  i am a russian student in europe and i have signed up for an `` american history '' class ... the american prof teaching it is a literal communist , says that `` americans have a deep seated hatred and to this day want to enslave and oppress african americans '' ( quote ) , that `` america has no left and democrats are a `` far right party '', 
  a great glimpse into american academia , i finally understand what * real * cuckery means . 
  he also teaches `` feminist and african american literature '' , so maybe not a typical person in american universities . 
  pepe so sad :(, 
   no tolerance for ( ... ) students engaging in hate speech . 
  should this occur , it will be dealt with according to california educational code or penal code as appropriate . 
  also , how * low * are the thresholds for `` hate speech '' ? 
  deal with them according to the penal code - it 's hate speech !, 
  the video exists , it 's just not hateful , it 's advocating for the rights of the oppressed , downtrodden and `` underprivileged '' . 
  if these are considered the modern equivalent of ww2 veterans , it is only a futher proof that the society has degenerated since those times . 
  but in fact , these are not at all equal : the antifa are mere thugs and extremists . 
  people are saying they exist only `` in response to fascism '' , ignoring that far left is not just a response , they have a positive ( and very destructive , at that ) , agenda of their own . 
  neo-nazis , for last several decades , have been virtually limited to drawing swastikas on random walls ; antifa and other leftist groups , which have been normalized and accepted , are the ones who are ruining and burning down streets , shops , beating up random people they deem `` fascist '' -- and acknowledging that does not make you a `` nazi apologetic '' . 
  as netanyahu 's son said it in response to charlottesville : `` neo-nazis are a thing from the past , while far left is a growing threat in the present . '', 
  who needs government checks , you just loot the stores like they do already .

  my german teacher has told me he is going to vote for merkel because everyone else is a `` far left or far right radical , while she is the reasonable center '' . 
  he followed that by `` maybe we will be islamic in ten years , who knows '', 
  germans are part of the plan . 
  they 're executing the plan themselves . 
  just read their media , and the comments on their media ... 
  i do n't know what could change them back .
