  i stopped long ago . 
  as trump said , coke is garbage . 
  the totems must go, 
  the worldnews sub welcomes [ any suggestions ] ( https://i.redd.it/xwrddpyoobgz.jpg ) as to who could have been the perpetrator . 
  plance incident, 
  by lone wolves, 
  statues of hernando cortes must go, 
  they 're provoking the radical inca nationalists, 
  ironically , islamists are n't nationalists ... they want everyone to submit to islam , in this way , they 're absolute globalists . 
  see how ethnically diverse isis is , welcoming fighters from all over the world !, 
  [ radical tourists ] ( http://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/25/590x/spain-tourism-sign-tourist-are-the-terrorist-705870.jpg ), 
  capitalist skyscraper . 
  the skyscraper was a symbol of capitalist exploitation . 
  \\ #occupywtc, 
  the [ real cause revealed ] ( http://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/25/590x/spain-tourism-sign-tourist-are-the-terrorist-705870.jpg ) . 
  no , peace and tolerance attacks are normal occurence for them now , it 's a part of `` their culture '' , why would you be mad at that , they `` know no better '' . 
  i want those symbols gone . 
  if we can ban nazi flags , we * need * to ban the current source of hate - mosques !, 
  hernando cortes statues need to be removed because they provoke the inca nationalists . 
  religion of peace , most likely . 
  hijacking top comment , spanish newspaper publishes photo of alleged driver : driss oukabir . 
  what name is that ? 
  sounds north african/arab . 
  he fueled the hateful rhetoric against muslims . 
  this is a self-defense attack , they are scared . 
  you can only understand quran if you speak arabic . 
  we have to presume the terrorist was not an arab speaker . 
  [ oh nom this just came in actually ... ] ( https://twitter.com/el_pais/status/898232262592004096/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw&amp;ref_url=https%3a%2f%2fnews.mail.ru%2fincident%2f30717358%2f ), 
  it sounds so much cooler than just `` reconquista '' with the spanish article ... * la reconquista *, 
  spanish newspaper shows photo of [ alleged van driver ] ( https://twitter.com/el_pais/status/898232262592004096/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw&amp;ref_url=https%3a%2f%2fnews.mail.ru%2fincident%2f30717358%2f ) . 
  i mean , sure , he is possibly not muslim , or a basque nationalist terrorist with arab roots , or an arab christian , or an arab trump supporter alt-righter , but but ... 
  i just still , in my bigoted mind , am assuming that it was the religion of peace after all . 
  reconquista for europe now, 
  poland from the east, 
  spain from the west, 
  liberating germany and france, 
  el pais [ has his photo ] ( https://twitter.com/el_pais/status/898232262592004096/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw&amp;ref_url=https%3a%2f%2fnews.mail.ru%2fincident%2f30717358%2f ) , definitely could be algerian . 
  there has been this phrase about cops sprayed all over my city in europe in the language here , i assumed it was just some idiot doing this , now that i saw this , i realize it was probably antifa doing this . 
  alt-left is isis, 
  cnn is amaq news agency, 
  reading a book about franco , i was thinking this exact same thing lol, 
  this . 
  remember the picture of the drowned kid that was circulated around during the immigration crisis ? 
  it only happened because his father wanted desperately to get them to europe illegaly instead of staying in ( safe ) turkey . 
  this one from barcelona is extremely disturbing , because it was uncaused by any of the victims , they had no control . 
  this is what european liberal tolerant politics that cares about `` acceptance '' and `` multiculture '' more than about its own citizens brought us . 
  these people always look so smug in these photos though . 
  incredible . 
  you can feel so much disdain from looking at their expressions . 
  this is a real argument . 
  `` if we do n't let them in , we are making ourselves enemies . '', 
  this is a real thing a liberal politician ( who fortunately lost in a crushing defeat ) said in a live interview in the eu country i live in . 
  will trump condemn the barcelona terrorist or is he accepting that he is responsible for the terrible attack ? 
  the silence is deafening . 
  ( cnn , also known as the amaq news agency ), 
  tremendous, 
  down the memory hole with it !, 
  i am paris, 
  i am orlando, 
  i am brussels, 
  i am nice, 
  i am berlin, 
  i am westminster, 
  i am manchester, 
  i am st. petersburg, 
  i am munich, 
  i am charlottesville, 
  i am tired, 
  so sad when monarchs are politically correct . 
  so sad . 
  i love kebab but ca n't stand islam . 
  what do i do ? 
  i am buying kebab from the serbians who used to live in bosnia . 
  i live in central/eastern europe, 
  most politicians here just say that islam is basically fascism and that they wo n't take a single rapefugee merkel is trying to send over here . 
  `` well if germany wants to take eu funds from us if we do n't take the refugees according to the quota it 's fine , life is more precious '', 
  well , to the people west of the border , former iron curtain ... 
  i am sorry :( hopefully you will come to a point where survival will start mattering more to you than `` political correctness '' and `` political professionalism '' . 
  trump is no professional politician as well . 
  it did n't matter in the slightest . 
  i made a bold prediction on worldnews before it was revealed who did the attack , [ you wo n't believe what happened next !, 
  ] ( https://i.redd.it/xwrddpyoobgz.jpg ), 
  guys it 's not islamic terrorism , the driver was from morocco , it 's radical moroccan terrorism , nothing to do with islam / s, 
   throw em back in the desert where they came from to embrace their great god, 
  this has to be the first step . 
  then the `` burning holy places and books '' is unnecessary - i could n't care less what they do over there in their lands . 
  google 's self driving vehicles development program did this !, 
  do n't want to gloat but just ca n't resist pointing out the folly, 
  [ barcelona city hall ] ( http://www.barcelona-metropolitan.com/downloads/22144/download/barcelona%20-%20refugee%20city%3f.jpg?cb=78ced3547ed5aca2b5463b524f90a1bb ),

  [ clear idea on who is the problem ] ( http://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/590x/secondary/spain-558538.jpg ), 
  i have nothing to say . 
  really , who is still going to claim that `` islam is a religion of peace '' , not seeing the threat it poses , needs to be ignored and made irrelevant . 
  they will not be convinced , ever . 
  [ barcelona city hall though ... ] ( http://www.barcelona-metropolitan.com/downloads/22144/download/barcelona%20-%20refugee%20city%3f.jpg?cb=78ced3547ed5aca2b5463b524f90a1bb ), 
  clearly unclear . 
   hired, 
  we need trumps ' tax records now !, 
  i mean , who else could have paid for the van ? 
  they 're anti-hispanic .
