  very sad . 
  no one needs a car that goes over 20 mph . 
  haha , no , it wo n't . 
  were * all * muslims involved in the attack ? 
  therefore , notallmuslims . 
  * welcomes a few thousand more refugees on boat *, 
  i am russian and i know english . 
  but all russians who speak english are specially trained trolls paid by putin to post on reddit :(, 
  first i wanted to go to germany , after all , they did n't have as many attacks as france . 
  then i thought britain might be safe . 
  well , alright , but nothing will certainly happen in spain , it 's a saf ... 
  i will just go to croatia . 
  \\ - who has committed this heinous act of terror ? 
  \\ - not all muslims, 
  * sadly this is some people 's real reaction *, 
  he was a slave-owning fascist . 
  it did , then they let muslims back in . 
  so , anti-soros coup is needed . 
  `` the floor is right-wing '', 
   it 's like calling a shovel right wing, 
  do you know [ who else used shovels ... ? 
  ] ( https://bethelatwar.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/6993d-nazishovelreadyjobs.jpg ), 
   libraries are right wing, 
  burn those symbols of oppression down . 
  the article [ is still there ] ( https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9kkkby/lets-get-rid-of-mount-rushmore ), 
   c. instead , rushmore is a testament to the human ability to conquer nature in our own image . 
  standing in front of it conjured feelings of both wonder and disgust in me . 
  obviously , washington and thomas jefferson were remarkable individuals who helped usurp british rule in america and , eventually , establish a new empire . 
  but they also enslaved their fellow man , committing special kinds of inhumane acts that should never be confined to footnotes . 
  no actual neo-nazi is going to answer this post . 
  also because they would likely get banned . 
  sounds normal in russian : \u0432\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0430 . 
  double consonants are nothing special in this language , * gryadka * , * ukladka * etc. 
  they get all the `` moral victories '' though !, 
  blacks will still be just 13 % ... not so much power on their part . 
  so will america be some kind of a hispanic state where everyone needs to know how to speak spanish ? 
  i thought the rebel was like infowars . 
  what is going on there ? 
  i could stop `` approving of '' or start criticizing , but the problem with that is that we are not in a time of a reasoned discussion , but basically a ( culture ) war . 
  you disagreeing with someone you normally support would not be taken as one aspect , but as a capitulation , a concession , an invitation to further attack . 
  no nuance is expected . 
  therefore , i will not criticize what the `` right wing populists do '' , even if i disagree with some , because the alternatives are worse . 
  of course it depends on a person : if they have nuance and understanding , you could have a honest discussion with them . 
  if he opens those concentration camps the left is promising he will any time now , i will stop supporting him , but there is no indication anything they 're saying the `` will do as we were saying all along '' is going to take place . 
  they did it for equality . 
  fortunately i 'm learning spanish in europe so if i go to the us i wo n't have a problem ... thinking about it , i should probably start learning arabic too and learn some more about islam lol, 
  but there 's still time, 
  my friend thought that hitler 's first name was `` heil '' . 
  but that was in primary school . 
  i am not american but have been following it closely and am interested in american politics , and consider myself a `` right wing populist '' . 
  personally i have expected that trump will bring the `` non-traditional '' team , and bannon , flynn etc. 
  were fulfilling my expectations ( was especially glad bannon got there as i read breitbart ) . 
  then flynn went and was replaced by the `` conventional general '' mcmaster , then spicer , and now bannon ... 
  i think we 're getting a more traditional presidency , perhaps trump is crumbling under the pressure and making concessions ? 
  who is left from the original team as it was after the election ? 
  basically almost no one . 
  sad . 
  more `` establishment '' every day . 
  who is going to be the chief anti-globalist now in there ? 
  well , at least i hope bannon will go back to running breitbart . 
  something is suggesting that perhaps we will need the reinvigorated `` populist-conservative '' publication again as the presidential team is gradually , it appears , becoming more `` establishment '' by the day . 
  especially mcmaster in there annoys me , kind of . 
   turnover worry you, 
  yes . 
  in particular , the people replacing those gone are worrying me . 
   if this were a business ( and trump is a businessman ) , it would be a huge red flag . 
  nothing to disagree with on this one . 
  wondering what 's * really * going on behind the scenes there ... 
  thanks for this . 
  finland . 
  damn . 
  i am in st. petersburg ( russia ) right now and reading the news from europe i 'm like , hey , what about a short trip to finland , just a few hours away , a safe paradise , totally calm boring place . 
  now this . 
  is there , like , any place where muslims are n't going insane ? 
  i do n't want to jinx but just yesterday there were news that a group of terrorists making bombs was arrested in moscow . 
  they were planning to blow up a subway car . 
  really , did n't they get the memo that cars are the way to go these days ? 
  no risk of the guy you 're buying bomb components from is secretly an fsb agent , no one will know what purpose you 're renting the car for ... and a bomb blows up only once and can fail , while a car will keep going until physically stopped or destroyed . 
  i feel really bad but this is why we will see a rise in car terrorism , the classic terrorist with a bomb terror will be on decline , maybe except chaotic places without law enforcement like the middle east or west africa . 
  but then you 'd be as hated as narendra modi was by obama administration for letting the hindus deal with muslims as they see fit . 
  nothing , the terrorists wo n't blend in with the refugees , they will just stay where they are and only good people will come , i was told by pro-refugee liberals . 
  he will be outsourcing bannon from now on . 
  please, 
   huffpost splash headlines have always been edgy and playful, 
  `` edgy '', 
  lol, 
   forcing you to respond to their playbook . 
  this . 
  it 's the difference between the mainstream `` right '' and the populist , conservative , patriotic nationalist right , the real right does not act according to their playbook . 
  i believe it was murmansk , not st. petersburg ( 800 miles north of st. petersburg ) . 
  it 's where the rapefugees are crossing into norway . 
  am not finnish but can clearly hear the `` varooo '' ( watching the video for the first time ) . 
  they usually do n't shout allahu akbar for such a long time . 
  yeah this guy has no idea what he is talking about . 
  it 's not like isis cares about `` undermining democracy '' and has some elaborate democratic government theory ... they want to get rid of more infidels . 
  why would they kill people in iraq , afghanistan etc. , so much democracy there , right ? 
  source : live in one of those `` undemocratic '' eastern europe countries in the eu, 
  well probably if we these countries upholding the eu law and took tens of thousands of refugees as per quotas , there would be terrorism , mass rape and a rise in crime like they have in `` progressive '' western europe . 
  the fact that the west eu is committing suicide does n't mean everyone has to follow them . 
  and as he said , there are no people to be radicalized here : guess why ?
