  it looks strange when they 're all smiling . 
  yes , eastern europe is very poor , we sold all of our vans and sharp stones so we can afford food lol . 
  the idea that their goal is the very secular `` undermining democracy '' is one of the weakest arguments for why muslims are supposedly harmless i have heard so far , sounded like a true eu politician talking about how poland is violating `` rights of refugees '' , something he referred to in other comments . 
   people that share our values and are good for our country can come from anywhere , be of any faith, 
  some liberal has said that the muslim-free parts of the eu ( center and east ) do n't have terrorism because they `` do n't have second generation immigrants who are most prone radicalization '' . 
  actually , there are second generation immigrants here : from vietnam , ukraine , russia , china , serbia , mongolia , macedonia ... no radicalization at all , in any sense . 
  why are liberals so vague about stating what they mean ? 
  in a similar vein : conservatives do n't want to `` get rid of all immigrants '' , making it deliberately sound like we are some irrationally hateful xenophobes , while , in fact , we are strongly discriminating ( reeee ) among the kind of immigrants who will be beneficial and who will be detrimental and threatening , on the basis of vast experience , allowing to determine which immigrants will fall into which category . 
  exactly . 
  some people are fooling themselves with the belief that there can be a `` moderate muslim culture '' . 
  there can be a moderate culture in a formerly muslim country , where absolute majority of people does n't follow islam at all . 
  ( but even so they can relapse . ), 
  this is not turkey 's case . 
  it 's like different rails going in parallel : any moderate muslim culture will be getting constantly more radical , unless they are willing to jump on that other rail of becoming fully non-islamic . 
  as leon uris described it in one of his books in a quote from a muslim character :, 
  so before i was nine i had learned the basic canon of arab life . 
  it was me against my brother ; me and my brother against our father ; my family against my cousins and the clan ; the clan against the tribe ; and the tribe against the world . 
  *** and all of us against the infidel . 
   warshington, 
  when i first read this i though it would be some anti-war pun lol, 
  it 's heroic , brave young protesters standing up to the oppressive system . 
  patton must have been a right-wing nazi , he was one of the people who would have attended a right-wing `` free speech rally '' / s, 
  she had criminal charges brought against her after this ( `` hate incitement '' or something similar ) . 
  did n't follow the story , but i believe she was acquitted afterwards . 
  they always drop the `` illegal '' from that . 
  right , it 's not so much about being offended , it 's that it 's just comical to make such a comparison . 
  the reaction is more like : `` so , these are today 's `` heroes '' , really ? '', 
   blatant mockery reduces their ideology to its rightful place , a joke . 
  use their alinsky on them !, 
  t_d has mostly been both . 
  the thing this that most twitter posts were also meme-style short sentences and jokes , rarely actual `` profound '' news . 
  and merkel does nothing about this . 
  look at all these assault weapons factories in germany , they have become world-famous for their production of assault cars , and their government , instead of doing something finally , is just cheering it , not even trying to curtail the production or at least prevent use !, 
   present homosexuality , degeneracy and promiscuity as `` normal , natural , healthy . '', 
   discredit the family as an institution . 
  encourage promiscuity and easy divorce . 
  i agree with the list in general but this in particular is not something russia or the ussr has ever supported or promoted , at home or abroad , let alone in the 1960s , so this is more an american left wing aim rather than an actual thing the real communists promoted . 
  edit : *** homosexuality was illegal in russia until 1993 , so it 's strange to blame sexual degradation on us , in 1960s . 
  *** the `` hippie generation '' was something that influencing russian youth and culture at the time , not vice versa . 
  while heterosexuality is increasingly said to be a `` learned behavior '' , not a `` natural one '' . 
  i do believe a fraction of population is born homosexual , but it 's ludicrous to claim that heterosexuality is not * the * natural , normal behavior . 
  one can only claim this if they believe that sexual intercourse is not intended for reproduction ( but is just an aim in itself ) -- and feminists obviously do n't think in this logical way . 
  `` words i disagree with are violence and genocide '' - antifa, 
   i give them a warning that reading it makes you dumber . 
  thanks , was about to read it , but after i saw people on woman march dressed as `` handmaid 's tale '' characters , it appeared to me that it might not be as great and postponed it . 
  it 's always darkest ~ ~ before ~ ~ after the don !, 
  i study in europe and i submitted a paper on the same topic , got also around 95 % , even though i used phrases like `` cultural incompatibility '' , `` no-go zones '' , `` immigrants being undapted to life in europe '' . 
  graded by a prof who has said that `` islamophobia is very sad '' and called the crusades `` islamophobic wars '' . 
  apparently there still are people who are capable of separating themselves from their ideology and see the merit of arguments ( and statistics ) , rather than just seeking agreement and approval of their own beliefs . 
  yeah , google is pretty much a part of infrastructure now , not just `` some company '' . 
  as is microsoft with operating systems ( unless one is willing to use linux ) . 
  it is , but it 's not hostility towards muslims . 
  they said hostility towards muslims is bad , not hostility in general . 
  hate facts, 
  trump did this . 
  truly america first lol . 
  * is this a discrimination of foreign astronomers ? 
  * ( cnn ), 
  when will we just start deporting them already ? 
  primarily those who have a proven/suspected link to or sympathize with terrorist causes , post radical stuff on fb , are known to have talked in a hateful way about infidels , or are known to have been members of isis ... these need to go asap . 
  we ca n't pretend `` innocent until proven guilty '' anymore , if it is virtually certain that a muslim * talking * about terror and hate * will * carry out terror and hate at some point in the future . 
  this is an inexorable pattern . 
  innocent until proven guilty is for one-time criminals , not for followers of a vast , adverse , political ideology : based on experience , suspicion ( `` he was known to police long time ago '' ) is a precursor to deeds . 
  `` why is india exporting software while pakistan is exporting terrorism ? '', 
   does she actually do any work or is she a pro shill for islam ? 
  it 's a part of her `` legislative agenda '' . 
  you know how every politician has some `` pet agenda '' of their own , like some decide they primarily care about `` safer streets '' , someone else wants to `` stop cyberbullying '' , or to make sure children have `` access to new books at school '' ... so her `` pet issue '' is being a shill for islam . 
   zero respect for anyone else 's property , the time and work they dedicate to it , or the sentimental value it may have to that person . 
  on a related note , on a tv debate here in europe , some liberal guy claimed that we `` should take all the refugees '' because `` we have resources to host them and as we should share with the less fortunate and poorer people what we have in developed countries '' . 
  oh yes , are those * your * resources or * collective * resources , paid for by everyone through taxes , to which you personally contributed only a tiny , tiny part ? 
  and why should europe spend those resources on `` refugees '' instead of people who need them here ? 
  you are 100 % correct . 
  in europe , liberals always bring kids to pro-rapefugee protests , equipping them with cringy posters like `` i do n't want to live in a world of xenophobia '' or `` i love everyone ! '' . 
  they almost never turn violent so there is not much danger involved for the kids , but in general , using children in a political conflict whose real implications they can not yet understand ( or are explained , as i imagine , in extremely biased ways : `` see these bad people over there do n't want to help poor refugees in trouble '' ) is wrong . 
  but what are they actually funding for antifa ? 
  it does n't take much money to just take baseball bats , stones , black clothes and go beat someone up , assault police or loot stores `` to fight capitalism '' . 
  [ soros with former russian president ] ( http://expert.ru/data/public/512321/512394/071_rr10_1.jpg ) in 1990s , shortly after he opened the `` open society fund '' branch in russia . 
  he is definitely one of the less popular figures here these days haha, 
  i am like this person except i think islam and it 's followers do kind of suck . 
  why are you assuming most redditors are well-educated ? 
  the fact you believe russian bots are sent to downvote stuff on reddit alone is downvotable . 
   the person who discovers the 74th gender, 
  are you saying it 's not discovered yet ? 
  i originally did n't want to go into gender studies but now you completely changed my mind , i want to be the one who gets the nobel prize for this discovery !, 
  unexpected . 
  i assumed it was a reference to the `` i identify as an attack helicopter '' , but this is better . 
   african american studies , latino studies, 
  funny how these things could have been regular subjects , like `` japan studies '' , or `` turkish culture studies '' , or whatever , but instead they are producing extreme liberal , and , as you say , divisive , destructive activists bent on subverting and destroying the culture . 
  another , [ spiegel before the election ] ( http://www.turi2.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/sp_38_2016_mca_turi_600x400.gif ) . 
  it says `` five minutes before trump : clinton 's weakness is a danger for the world '', 
  they were the real nazis , so now they can spot who is a nazi with 100 % accuracy , and trump is definitely a nazi , trust them !, 
  or maybe to a town populated by alloha snackbar people ... 
   i know she 's a weirdo who pisses in the street ( for muh empowerment or something ), 
  i looked that up, 
  wtf spain ( or more correctly , wtf barcelona - spain is ruled by a right wing party ), 
  but is it not possible though ? 
  let 's say i 'm russian but if i believed that jews or japanese people were intellectually superior , more beautiful , advanced etc. 
  than everyone else , would n't i be a `` russian japanese supremacist '' ? 
  sure , it 's a really weird thing to be , but you theoretically could be an african american , but a supremacist for european-descended americans , as in , believing they are superior to everyone else . 
  very precise .
