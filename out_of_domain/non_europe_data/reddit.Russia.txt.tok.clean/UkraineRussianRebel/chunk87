  do you mean that blonde women are better than asian women you supremacist ? 
  israel is already doing this , time to begin in europe . 
  are you implying the holocaust actually happened ? 
  it 's a jewish conspiracy . 
  - palestinian , saudi etc. 
   ( famous economic migrant ), 
  kek, 
   make it a wall with electricity all around , at least 750v, 
  i am really surprised why this is not a thing still . 
  `` the wall will cost a lot ! '', 
  great , we can have an expensive wall , or we can have expensive refugees and terrorism . 
  so basically we spend that amount anyway , but with an expensive wall we wo n't have terror and violence , so it 's absolutely worth it . 
  thank you for this defense . 
  very beautiful !, 
  leave the gender creative kids alone !, 
  when i was in kindergarten , i had a brief period when i announced that i am a girl now ( i am guy ) , made up a girl 's name and asked people to call me that . 
  it lasted two days . 
  this was over a decade ago , i 'm wondering what would happen if i were in a `` progressive '' kindergarten these days . 
  modern liberalism is based on self-loathing and `` acknowledgment of your privilege '' . 
  while they 're already calling it that in the us , in europe they 're saying we `` need to share more '' because we are `` well-off '' ( = accept any and all economic migrants from africa , kosovo etc. 
  and islamists from the me ) ... other way of saying `` realize you have a privilege and diminish it by making your life more dangerous , less prosperous and your country worse than it used to be '', 
  estonia is the best baltic country , and i believe the home of skype . 
   that does n't mean i 'm smarter than you, 
  exactly this . 
  the distribution is the famous `` bell curve '' . 
  it does n't mean that * every single * member of one group is less or more intelligent or capable than a every single member of another group . 
  also , honest discussion about this would n't lead to discrimination of a group which scores lower , it would lead to abandoning discrimination of * others * with the purpose of propping up the less successful group ( like various affirmative actions ) , and adoption of equal standards for everyone . 
  usually it 's the patriotic people who go to serve in the military , patriotism usually implies a preference and support for your own country and your own people , which means other countries and people will probably get less of that from you . 
  but that does n't at all mean that you * hate * them . 
  does every american/russian/indian / french etc. 
  soldier hate everyone who is not from their country ? 
  probably absolutely not . 
  they are coming to this conclusion , not us and other patriots , and then pretending as if others were thinking this way , too . 
  the lgbtqq12saa makes it look like a satire . 
  i hope it is . 
  `` maybe * even * community colleges '' lol, 
  news came recently that libya 's coast guard has resumed activities , catching migrants boats and scaring the ngo `` refugee taxis '' away from their territory , while putting the migrants crossing libyan border into their own `` migrant camps '' . 
  good beginning . 
  now the ones already in europe should start getting deported over there , this is a good way to invest : not into the useless refugees who bring no benefit to the host country , but into supporting libyan camps and government so they can cooperate on protecting europe from the invasion . 
   `` europe runs the risk of turning black from illegal immigration , '' gaddafi warned . 
  `` it could turn into africa . '', 
  [ how right he was !, 
  no one needs a machete that long !, 
  europeans and all civilized people generally tend to have a higher level of tolerance and reluctance before doing to savages the same the savages do to them . 
  so , unfortunately , it will take some time before we finally say `` enough is enough '' . 
  the aim is to be a martyr , possibly . 
  rooftop koreans at it again !, 
   stream it on cable and online . 
  happy hunger games !, 
  [ yes ] ( https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hd-graph-acid-attacks-in-london.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=750 ), 
  they will have to deal with islamophobia , so terrible . 
  they are the real victims indeed !, 
  definitely . 
  there 's millions of muslims . 
  entire areas populated entirely by muslims , what are the chances that two of them exploded at roughly the same time . 
  and how many more terror attacks are happening at this very moment in other parts of the world we wo n't know about unless we look at local news from , say , south asia or me ? 
  at least sadiq khan is assimilated into knowing british phrases !, 
   on every bus and tube ride i went on , as well as in the crowds . 
  ahahaha , i 'd like to visit london but this is the reason i wo n't go . 
  airport ? 
  risky , but with security . 
  tube ? 
  bus ? 
  no no no . 
  bridge , sidewalk ? 
  well are there bollards ? 
  i 'd go to british countryside and smaller cities though , hopefully there are ways not to go through london . 
  same with paris , i just wo n't go into there . 
  i 'm russian living in the eu but not western europe , so not many immigrants here , mostly from ukraine , vietnam , russia , china etc. , almost no muslims and africans , people based and against taking in `` refugees '' per eu quotas . 
  once i went to switzerland and decided to go on a walk through the city at 11 pm . 
  holy f \\* ck . 
  literally everyone was african or muslim , groups of africans on corners , every cafe was muslims and africans . 
  i was with my friend ( a girl ) and one of those guys ^ ( edit : * standing on the street as we walked past them , did n't go into any cafes haha , to clarify * ) just started yelling something at us in french really loudly and angrily , then started running and pursuing us , only stopped when a nearby police car turned on the lights . 
  wtf . 
  it was a true culture shock . 
  ca n't make good memes if they need to conform to the ever-expanding standards of non-offensiveness . 
  this is a great example of why overregulation often hurts quality . 
  it 's a practical class , a part of the islamic studies program curriculum . 
  my thoughts and prayers are with all the people affected by this terror !, 
  love and tolerance is what we need !, 
  \\ #prayforbrussels \\ #prayforlondon, 
  she would have probably said `` trans-black '' or `` trans-african '' or something . 
   sign me on ~ ~ dog ~ ~, 
  * dawg, 
  that 's borderline impossible - unless you are a `` diversity migrant '' , or a doctor . 
  fortunately trump is changing that now and making emphasis on abilities , not `` family status '' ( one in , can bring their entire family ) and being low-quality cheap workforce or a future welfare dependent . 
  people yes . 
  but this is the government . 
  police deals with muslim migrants directly , but this is police administration , and i assume there 's more politics involved on that level . 
  appropriate enrichment level is 100 % compliance to islam . 
  anything else is oppression and persecution of muslims . 
  why would one , being a pious muslim , tolerate some english or any secular non-islamic law , or settle down for partial recognition of islam , if it is the absolute , complete , god-given religion and system for everyone ? 
  islam , unlike christianity , is not a religion that can co-exist with a secular state , it will be ultimately seeking to replace it . 
  some police may be giving preference to spanish speakers in some areas , who knows ... 
  it 's actually not on the rise , but given the same evidence , two sides arrive at different conclusions and assign different importance to different factors - one side of the dispute regards it as `` anti-intellectualism '' if the conclusion is one they find unacceptable . 
  this is a common tactic . 
  frequently the disagreement is not about one side being `` ignorant '' , but about them ascribing different values to the same evidence . 
  i do n't remember what it 's called but it 's a well known phenomenon in pscyhology : presented with the same facts , two disagreeing sides will interpret them as further supporting their beliefs , not disproving them . 
  this annoys me so much . 
  if the video is so `` controversial '' , `` offensive '' and `` inappropriate '' , why not let the viewers tear it to shreds in the comments ?
