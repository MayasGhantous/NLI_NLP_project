  same goes for articles in online newspapers when they turn off the comment section in anticipation of a `` heated debate '' . 
  what 's the problem with a `` heated debate '' ? 
  i was about to start learning angular but [ this ] ( https://medium.com/@mnemon1ck/why-you-should-not-use-angularjs-1df5ddf6fc99 ) scared me away a bit lol . 
   because being a productive decent human being is hard, 
  joke 's on the people who think communist system does n't entail working and believe it would be/was a system where you just live off the confiscated wealth the 1 % used to have . 
  it is illegal * not * to work in a communist country . 
  it was considered ( a legal term ) `` freeloaderism '' in the ussr and the eastern bloc , and likely was too in maoist china and other communist countries . 
  read `` in defense of looting '' , it 's an actual college class . 
  i have relatives living in germany and they confirm this . 
  refugees do indeed get stuff , like furniture , appliances , cell phones for free in their state-provided apartments . 
  germany also has a law ( a part of the grundgesetz , the constitution ) that `` in times of emergency '' , empty spaces , regardless of who owns them , can be used to host people . 
  the law has however not been invoked and probably will not be , but there was a discussion of this when the `` refugee '' crisis started . 
  also relevant :, 
   65.6 % of germans consider muslim immigrants `` badly integrated '' . 
  this is voters of * all * parties except for the green party , where a rougly equal amount of people ( 65.4 % ) believe muslims are `` well integrated '' .

  i would n't even call this `` the left '' is promoting . 
  who is even this guy lol . 
  some dude with a twitter account . 
  he probably is n't even `` left or right '' , just a loon . 
  it 's interesting but in high school ( in europe ) we were told that these books are not as popular and propagated , and are considered way more controversial , in the us than they are in europe and the rest of the world due to `` offensiveness '' , wondering if there 's a degree of truth to this . 
   \\ #blacklivesmatter, 
  it 's just social activism guys , no violent , terrorist or hate group , stop pushing the conspiracy theories trumpists / s, 
  encouraged to learn arabic ? 
  that 's okay , if it does n't get in the way of learning english . 
  but all other things ? 
  terrible . 
  i 'm wondering what the motivation was on the part of the foster family to take her : to try an experiment of how they can `` convert '' europeans , or just to abuse her ? 
  ruptly is a russian channel , this is 100 % fake / s, 
  even columbus , the guy who discovered america ... oh wait , saying `` discovered '' is bigotry because there were people before !, 
  ped xing , the most famous chinese immigrant to the us . 
  houston is 43 % hispanic and 25 % african-american . 
  non-hispanics are just 25 % in the city lol . 
  i was about to ask `` which country 's flag is antifa '' and then i realized it has originated in germany as well . 
  google frequently disregards prepositions and searches for keywords , usually not phrases . 
  not to defend google 's company politics , but i think in this case this is how search engines just work . 
  washington post is broken ? 
  some say it 's photoshopped , i have [ found this ] ( http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/american-anarchists-ypg-kurdish-militia-syria-isis-islamic-state-w466069 ) . 
  supposedly there are some antifa volunteers ( as there are volunteers from all over the world ) fighting alongside the kurds . 
  so possibly this could be real . 
  if some are fighting actual terrorists , it 's okay , but you 're right : we should n't give them ammunition and a chance to associate themselves with `` see , we 're actually fighting even isis '' , as a justification for the antifa in the west , which will never volunteer to go to syria or anywhere with real danger , to assault people . 
  climate change ... could sink helsinki !!, 
  it 's already sinking !, 
  helsinki is literally sinking.soon , finland will cease to exist , and it will be just a lake ... if we do n't stop climate change now !!!!, 
  basically nothing . 
  source : was there a few weeks ago and am there now ( but on the russian side ), 
  `` you 've heard the word leaker ? '', 
  lol, 
  is `` trans man '' a man pretending to be a woman or a woman pretending to be a man ? 
  is `` trans woman '' a woman pretending to be a man or a man pretending to be a woman ? 
  it 's used very inconsistently . 
  oh i love finnish accent . 
  if i did n't see the guy i 'd think it 's japanese . 
  `` if finland could have a sheriff , he would be like joe arpaio . '', 
  ilegals from sweden wo n't go to finland because sweden is way more cucked . 
  their cuckness is a magnet that protects finland . 
  `` tremendous drugs are flowing in from mexico . 
  * the best * drugs , believe me ! '', 
  it 's not losing , it 's sharing . 
  it 's not being ripped off , it 's reparations . 
  remember , california and texas are really mexico . 
  just one thing i do n't get is why do the national parks shut down . 
  like , why does a national park need government to be operational at any given moment ? 
  even nytimes hired a conservative commentator in order to `` diversify their viewpoints '' . 
  it resulted in mass [ cancellations of subscriptions ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/bret-stephens-new-york-times-climate-change-article-subscriptions-canceled-op-ed-2017-4 ) from liberal readers, 
   by simply saying this, 
  would they believe him or declare him a `` sellout traitor '' or a `` supremacist '' of some kind ? 
  what is their reaction to carson , clarke etc. 
  it 's very logical , indeed , not a conspiracy . 
  they are responsible for a much higher rate of ( violent ) crime than other populations . 
  criminals are more likely to be engaged by police , and these criminals tend to be predominantly african american . 
  criminals are more likely to confront and threaten police , hence they are more likely to be killed than other people . 
  there were theories that he is carrying his wife , but this is far better . 
   that 's why you stay in shape, 
  upon seeing the picture , i thought ... well with me she 'd probably have to walk , but i could at least carry the baby lol . 
  but then he would n't be able to touch her , it would be un-islamic haha, 
  ah , germany , the home of antifa . 
  but she 's not really small , she 's average size . 
  kek, 
  conservative , these days , just means normal . 
  consider that `` there are two genders '' is not a statement of fact but a * radical * political position nowadays . 
  edit :, 
  feminists are implying they 're speaking for all women , rather than being just a political ideology . 
  back when they fought for voting rights , they were fighting for actual rights . 
  now they 're trying to destroy traditional , spontaneous culture of romantic relationships by making everything about `` power '' , politics and `` misogyny '' . 
  saying that anti-feminist means anti-women is like saying that anti-communist means anti-worker - they also claimed communists are the one and only true representative authorized to speak for the working class and the proletariat . 
  the indian madman, 
  delivery always on time, 
  i like it how i do n't live in the us but know which states/cities i would n't like to end up in culturally if i did haha, 
  edit :, 
  okay , i do n't have personal experience , but mass. 
  is just usually said to be one of the most consistently `` progressive '' / dem states in the us . 
  no county there has voted for trump ( and boston is a completely different story ) , and the representation is thoroughly leftist , with people like warren etc. 
  sorry for ignorance and if any pedes from there are offended haha . 
  feminists act really tough * while * having their thinking built upon the conviction that they 're powerless , victimized , weak , downtrodden , oppressed . 
  it 's a really unbalanced way of thinking and living . 
  most people just do n't enter the realm of thinking of themselves as `` poor victims '' of whatever . 
  they claim to be victims of . 
  i used to like it because they showed the unusual and weird side of things , but they were gradually becoming more and more ideological and sjw with basically everything . 
   binary,
