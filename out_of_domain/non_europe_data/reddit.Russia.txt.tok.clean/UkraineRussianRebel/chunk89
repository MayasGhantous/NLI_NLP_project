  hey now !, 
  think of all the non-binary people bigot !, 
  is jezebel even redpillable , considering that it is a deliberately feminist site , unlike vice which is supposed to be documentaries and interesting stuff ? 
  by my experience there are no regular people on there , only feminists . 
   tendies, 
  have n't seen this word for such a long time on here ... 
  or , you become a diversity officer at someplace like google , and fire people who do n't fit the ideological profile !, 
  kek, 
  he should have said he lived under fascists in spain , it sucked , so he refugeed himself to the ussr , and it was n't much better . 
  would have been more believable ( and there are stories of former spanish communists/republicans doing that ) . 
  correct , japanese wanted to take over asia and use the non-japanese as slaves . 
   `` to the king !, 
  to the duce !, 
  to us ! '' . 
  he does n't have to ask !, 
  it 's a timeless btfo . 
  gender studies major : there are not enough women in stem !, 
  then why did you not go to stem ? 
  `` damn , that 's a [ cold ass donkey !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9s9spxxkqw ) '', 
  correct , the map should look [ more like this ] ( https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/553a66a5ed915d15d8000028/150217_south-west_russia_jpeg.jpg ) . 
  vast majority of terror attacks here is taking place in chechnya and north caucasus - the groups that were trying to take over there during 1990s , like the caucasus emirate and islamic brigades - are still trying through terror . 
  i do n't get why slovakia is orange though . 
  it 's absolutely perfectly safe , unless you count bears as a `` terrorist threat '' . 
  so is belarus , what surprises me really a lot is luxemburg there though . 
   drug testing is routine for many a white collar worker, 
  what , so wolf of wall street lied to me ? 
  he is also supposedly a rapist , sources say . 
   whole neighborhoods built with debris and sheet metal . 
  so basically slums . 
  `` crabs in a bucket '' mentality . 
  what did they look like , kind of like arabs did n't they ? 
  so yeah , they were n't black africans . 
  he could be adopted by people similar to these ... 
  what 's crazy is that they were putting `` muh diversity '' into things made today , like ads , movies , almost as a rule , but now they 're trying to recast history as if it had fit their idea of `` proper '' diversity and the accurate representation was , in fact , inaccurate , not `` diverse enough '' . 
  i do n't want to sound as a / pol/ack , just giving an example of something similar , i took a class on european history in 1930s and the teacher was showing how the plaques on memorial sites of genocides ( in poland , in particular ) were gradually changed from `` here many people were killed in the name of terrible ideology of nazism '' to `` here many * jews * , and also some other people , were killed ... '' so , basically , the other victims of holocaust are kind of made sound like less important than others . 
  this sort of thing is what liberals doing with recasting history to fit their ideas of a `` proper world '' . 
  they do lol . 
  but there are some african people in the uk these days , they ca n't be left out of the ancient british history . 
   diversity-specific classes, 
  hahaha , i am studying in europe but i was looking at the curricula of american universities out of curiosity , and the columbia university program in architecture requires you to take `` at least one non-western class '' . 
  under normal circumstances , this would have sounded like just regular `` broadening perspectives '' , but everyone understands why they 're doing that and make such a requirement . 
  it 's not `` learning also about other non-western cultures '' , it 's resentment towards what they call `` western dominance '' in learning and arts ... in a * western * country ( what culture should that country have , if not a western one ? 
  ) , if it 's still okay to call america that , because after trump 's speech in poland , it seems they 're really offended at that term . 
  `` black people are rude and useless '', 
  `` rude and useless people are usually , but not always , black '', 
  `` useless black people are rude '', 
  i almost see this on huffington post !, 
  nasty guy , believe me . 
  in this case they were probably mocking libertarians who constantly go on about `` less government '' and `` government is useless '' , but in this instance , it 's absolutely tasteless . 
  and also , people are probably not protesting against the existence of coast guard or police force when talking about `` less government '' . 
  would we even do that though ? 
  siberian safe spaces * with * snowflakes, 
  communist party of russia , circa 2017 :, 
  `` what do you mean it did n't work ? 
  why would you think that ? '', 
  real story lol, 
  b-b-but texas voted trump !, 
  from the article :, 
   many have posited that she is a closeted conservative , privately harboring the desire to make america great again . 
  swastikas are red ? 
  i usually saw them in black . 
   why denounce trump when his followers are paying customers like everyone else ? 
  and why distance yourself from hate groups when they stream your songs too ? 
  their swastikas may be red but their money is still green . 
  post-election stress disorder, 
   ( ... ) we 're now stuck with a trump presidency where each day americans wake to a hellscape more nightmarish and embarassing than the day before . 
  levels of post-election stress and anxiety have spiked dramatically across the country, 
  fortunately lefties do n't have the capabilities of / pol / intelligence agency , they would have found out which floor you 're on based on some light and shadow angle , distance from the roof , and called your employer to report that you 're a `` fascist '' and `` xenophobic bigot '' *, 
  \\* does n't work if your employer is based, 
  i 'm already banned from there , without ever having posted or commented , because i post to t_d . 
  but it 's okay , they would n't want me over there anyway . 
  perhaps it was more a case of `` sociologysplaining '' , but a woman once kept telling me how i am ignorant about reality and `` social dynamics '' , otherwise i would have clearly seen that women are repressed and heavily disadvantaged and that she , as a sociology major , clearly sees that -- a person like me who has no clue about social sciences and is probably not even at a uni has no business arguing with her . 
  i am pol sci major . 
  he did n't release his tax returns because it 's full of russian money reeeeeeeeeeeeeee, 
  * failed billionaire *, 
   not a 20 percent traitor . 
  it 's an ctrl-left , and totalitarian in general , thing . 
  divert on one thing , become a xenophobic , misogynistic , fascist bigot and a social outcast . 
  ahahaha , i ca n't believe this , once i posted it as a joke that `` next they will say ben carson is not * actually * black '' , and now this , things you believe to be completely absurd are becoming real things someone actually believes -- how do you make parodies , hyperboles and sarcastic comments in this situation ? 
  fortunately i 'm backing up my pepes in cloud . 
  the fact you still need a thing like gender shows you how oppressive this society is . 
  we need a [ junior anti-sex league ] ( https://pjmedia.com/drhelen/2015/4/13/its-as-if-george-orwells-junior-anti-sex-league-has-occupied-feminism/ ) asap, 
  germany, 
  sweden, 
  probably italy , but they 're wrapping that up, 
  good , now we need to achieve that more muslims become ex-muslims in the west post comments like this ex-liberal . 
  something tells that cult will be a bit harder to dismantle . 
  they ca n't sustain themselves because they 're glorifying dissolution of the family , `` independent career-oriented women '' , single motherhood etc. 
  so they bring in the new mass of immigrants . 
   in oakland , the required reading is a book about a boy wearing a dress . 
  tfw people were saying a few years ago that this is just a crazy right wing conspiracy of conservative bigots and no one is actually going to force lgbt and sexual deviancies on children , that they just want rights , they want to be respected and tolerated , * pffft stop this you conspiratard , they do n't want to destroy your little bigoted world *, 
  one communist ( actual communist according to her profile ) girl has said that ayaan hirsi ali is a `` neocon right wing tool '' . 
  i responded with `` correct , she 's a true fascist , deport her back to somalia '' . 
  instant block lol . 
  charlie hebdo is totally crazy . 
  when isis blew up the russian plane over egypt , their picture was people falling down on isis territory from that plane with a caption `` russian bombing campaign finally working out . '', 
  they 're better to just ignore , they 're thriving on provoking people in extreme , distasteful ways . 
  and half of that 49 % is hispanics . 
  non-hispanics just 25 % .
