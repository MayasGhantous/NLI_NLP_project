  asian americans , lee says , are penalized by 50 points -- in other words , they had to do that much better to win admission . '', 
  oh , they think they can achieve the mtv effect , 
  the article is about 16 year-olds planning an attack , you 're upset about a hashtag . 
  priorities . 
  so did the mayor of london sadiq khan . 
   when they stated that their actions had been politically motivated . 
  the equivalent of `` it 's ok to punch `` those nazis '', 
  you 're being sarcastic but in my pol sci debate class a girl was saying that `` without multiculturalism you would n't have kebab '' as an argument for taking in refugees . 
  literally . 
  since the truck apparently got stuck somewhere , here i am sending one :, 
  quadruple bricks, 
  [ look at us , we the vikings now ] ( http://dailycaller.com/2016/02/04/refugees-go-clubbing-in-russia-harass-girls-wake-up-in-hospital-the-next-morning/ ), 
  i am quite certain he meant not letting anyone from those places in . 
  our memes are spilling into reality . 
  why are you getting downvoted, 
  i agree with your comment, 
  i do n't want you to be downvoted, 
  com, 
  a fake news website . 
  i read harry potter as an assignment in grade school . 
  it 's a fairy tale for children , why does an author like that think she 's more qualified than anyone else to judge politics ? 
  it 's one thing to be a historian who thinks they have some educational authority and a fairy tales writer . 
  has someone found the pizza ? 
  the reality is , there is no pizza . 
  i was just wondering . 
  i thought maybe i did n't see it lol . 
   * research shows no russian involvement, 
   it 's the russians, 
  see how good the russians are at concealing their activities ? 
  maybe it 's a brigade ? 
  they 're here all the time . 
  or visitors from r/sweden, 
  and this time , it will finally be a statue of a muslim woman . 
  when you 're destroying neighborhoods in california because trump won , you are destroying houses and businesses of clinton voters . 
  obama [ forgets he 's not on the internet ] ( http://i.imgur.com/m4jno.png ), 
  `` could care less '' and `` could n't care less '' mean the same thing now . 
  kind of like `` literally '' means both [ literally and not literally ] ( https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/literally ) . 
  the people at women 's march were dressed as vaginas and yelling about their menstrual blood . 
  somehow that adds to their dignity , and while trump was talking specifically about clinton and her actions being nasty , they 're being `` nasty women '' in a literal sense . 
   merkel never uses the words `` nation '' or `` german people '', 
  [ triggered ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/reichstag_inschrift.jpg/440px-reichstag_inschrift.jpg ), 
  does n't check out . 
  which one of you [ is right ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/5uf50h/poll_64_of_germans_want_to_replace_merkel/ddu1iyd/ ), 
   because afd has zero fucking chance of winning, 
  so does trump !, 
  hillary has 99.9 % chance of winning in a lands -- oh wait, 
  and neocons like kristol admit it in fact exists , and confirm the conspiracy theory that they , in fact , prefer it to elected leaders that do n't suit them . 
  but then , garrison ( as far as i know ) is n't exactly mainstream so liberals and other `` unaware and compliant '' would probably still say this is tinfoil and soros is just a well-meaning filanthropist . 
  but they have a terribly wrong idea of what alt-right is . 
  i am glad that mainstream media like politico now refer to breitbart as a conservative website instead of `` bigoted hypernationalist conspiracy blog '' as they did upon learning bannon was appointed though . 
  haha yes . 
  i did n't know what flag this was but blue saudi ( shariablue ) would look like it !, 
  he probably calculates it from the % upvoted . 
  that 's why he appointed elon musk to ... some position lol , i do n't remember what it was exactly . 
  technology advisor ? 
  i thought you were talking about youtube but i only see 10 dislikes there . 
  edit : nevermind , i see , the white house official stream . 
  i was looking at the one in this post . 
  ~ ~ rape ~ ~ consent-free intercourse culture, 
   infowars came to my campus, 
  i thought this was a version of tendies . 
   you 'd take russian spies over saudis ? 
  okay, 
  i 'd take russian spies over saudis !, 
  i like how he continues to ask milo if he 's american , implying a `` real american '' would choose saudis . 
  i mean , as a russian , an american should not have to choose either , but the implication of being in favor of saudi islamists as being some litmus test for being a real american is ridiculous . 
  yes , it will be the only man-made wall visible from the iss , as the myth that the wall of china is visible had been repeadetly debunked . 
  i suspected something like that , but decided to post anyway lol against my better judgment . 
  but do they refer to themselves like that , too ? 
  because , say , bush has `` former governor of texas . '', 
  the refugee suspension . 
  you know , the constitution applies to somalians , yemenis and iraqis who are not citizens and have never been to america , too !, 
  but what difference , at this point , does it make ? 
  should have added / s at the end . 
   all the streams, 
  i think not . 
  bill clinton is a rapist, 
  gim me a brick, 
  my eyes have seen the glory of the draining of the swamp, 
  quad brick, 
  the guy on the right smiling lol, 
  this is suspicious . 
  do the shills and ctr not know about this ? 
  where are they ? 
  fox is a total potato stream . 
  they will say he put a few self-hating uncle tom black people to stand there right behind the podium so they are seen in the camera . 
  quad bricks, 
  and, 
  a brick, 
  how many bricks is ludicrous bricks ? 
  the guy says second best things !, 
  trump says the best things !, 
  hey chicago, 
  get your stuff together, 
  or i 'll send the feds !, 
  all you learn about this you learn from us !, 
  forgot [ berlin ] ( http://toleranceinmotion.org/images/tim_truck.jpg ), 
  nice try russian spy !, 
  ( i hope le pen wins , please france ),
