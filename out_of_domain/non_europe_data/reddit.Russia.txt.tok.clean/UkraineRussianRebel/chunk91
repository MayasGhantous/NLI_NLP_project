   gravity is just a social construct, 
  `` it 's just a theory . '', 
  religion of peas, 
  this is why guns should be banned . 
  lol haha drumpf is orange , why is he so orange lol, 
  imagine another version :, 
  lol haha obama is black , why is he so black lol, 
  she 's a thin person drinking diet coke . 
  a president proven wrong in such a distastrous way has no other option than to resign . 
  i wish we had a trump tower in russia ... but he 's not colluding with us at all : / haha, 
  they 're all independent-minded freelance artists , performers , poetry writers , pundits and cultural critics , not everyone works 9-5 as a dumb pro-trump redneck !, 
  great, 
  gaddafi did nothing wrong . 
  he was protecting europe against immigration , now we have to find a new dictator for libya to stop these africans from coming again ... 
  canadians = `` first nations '', 
  everyone else is just a migrant . 
  why does it matter what kind of migrant they are ? 
  on a serious not , what do the `` first nations '' think about this all lol, 
  he 's likely not wrong . 
  why would kim jong un give up the weapons making sure that no one will invade nk . 
  china will probably not stop trading with them . 
  yes , is that not obvious ? 
  * the dreamer 's ballad *, 
  yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away . 
  now it looks as though they 're here to stay . 
  oh , i believe in yesterday . 
  suddenly i 'm not half the man i used to be . 
  there 's a shadow hanging over me . 
  oh , yesterday came suddenly . 
  yesterday love was such an easy game to play . 
  now i need a place to hide away . 
  oh , i believe in yesterday . 
  self-awareness : 0, 
  unlike the babies , no one is going to kill the daca migrants . 
  lol, 
  i want to see that train in blue with big golden letters trump haha, 
  they already called him sen. , as for senator . 
  so r - unambiguously means republican ( it 's a convention , like r-al , d-ny etc. ), 
  one one side it is amazing that american laws/constitution are 200 + years old and still functioning virtually unchanged , on the other hand , there needs to be some modernization : like that number of citizens should be relevant for the representation , not just inhabitants in the state regardless of citizenship . 
  unless one takes representation to mean that non-citizens are also represented . 
  utterly offtopic ( related to tattoos ) , but [ this guy ] ( http://img.radio.cz/pictures/politik/franz_vladimir1.jpg ) , vladimir franz , was running for president in the czech republic in 2013 . 
  too expensive , too technologically impossible , too much resources , terrain too difficult , we still do n't have the knowledge to make the border wall feasible ( ignore the fact there has been a vehicle remote-controlled from earth on mars for like a decade ) . 
  this is the irony of the eu threatening to sanction the countries that refuse to take the refugees according to quotas by withdrawing funding from them : the money they wo n't get from the eu is what they will save on not having to host and feed the refugees for indefinite amount of time , so there is no loss , and they wo n't get all the threats associated with it like terrorism , criminality , social conflict , etc. , which is a benefit . 
  that is , you lose more by avoiding eu sanctions than by avoiding to meet the eu demands . 
  but the previous trudeau was fine or was he like this one ? 
  `` and the chinese will come and say : now * that 's * a wall ! '', 
  supposedly romans also believed they could integrate the teuton and other barbarian `` refugees '' and `` immigrants '' ... 
  we were talking about that other guy , genghis khan . 
  he was less destructive than islam . 
  is this one of the good arab guys ? 
  what would happen if podesta came to the press conference and started asking questions , since he is employed at the washington post as an `` expert '' ? 
  kek, 
  #no one needs so many tears, 
  i love lindsey graham !!!, 
  graham for geotus , stop the division , 40 rinos  trump ^ ^ said ^ ^ no ^ ^ one ^ ^ ever, 
   they should never have given instant citizenship, 
  umm , no one is actually giving the refugees citizenship , instant or otherwise . 
  now that would have been the real disaster , currently we can still deport them . 
  but if ( when ) it really gets bad , we will just be stripping muslims already here of citizenship , i am fairly certaint that this will happen , and perhaps it will be soon . 
  there was a research somewhere posted on t_d recently : 67 % of liberals have said they 'd stop being friends with someone over supporting trump , but only 12 or 13 % of conservatives have said they 'd cut someone off over supporting hillary . 
  i thought universities are mostly liberal , and penn state would be no exception . 
  i live in a european country and there was a presidential election , where one candidate was a `` populist '' and the other one was the preferred guy of the `` intellectual elite '' . 
  i asked my art teacher , who supported the latter and went on the tirade about the former , what would she do if her brother voted for the populist . 
  her answer ? 
  `` well then i would n't have a brother anymore . 
  people like that would n't exist in my life . '', 
  `` i hope you will see the light one day and vote for the party i support . 
  i love you . 
  good luck on your journey towards enlightenment , but right now i can not associate with tainted people like yourself , my cult would n't understand . '', 
  -- likely interpretation, 
   2020 will be so sweet !, 
  i hope this will be one of the campaign slogans . 
  ama when ? 
  it 's interesting that 8 years old kids these days already know what `` social justice warrior '' is ( or they just found it funny ? ), 
  when i was that age i had no idea about politics or `` social movements '' at all , and it was n't * that * long ago . 
  did she have to look three years back into his feed to find this and then post her outrage , hoping no one will notice ? 
  `` even a broken clock is right twice a day '' will likely be their response . 
  there 's no trump brand on the cup ? 
  haha, 
  he 's trans . 
  who says being trans is just for genders ? 
   i 'm enrolled in my tribe and 2/3 native, 
  so your cheekbones are 2/3 the height of elizabeth warren 's cheekbones ? 
  it is a great way of punishing america , too !, 
  now instead of the us , mexico will be reaping all the benefits of having these great dreamers in their country !, 
  as a non-binary person , i find your comment extremely violent and genocidal . 
  i am looking out of my peephole every three or four minutes to see if the right wing execution squads i 've read about on cnn that trump deployed to hunt down transgenders , homosexuals , dreamers and mexicans are already coming for me . 
  but as long as i am free , i will keep resisting . 
  you can send me to the secret concentration camp , but you will never take my freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeedom !, 
  i think he criticized islam , but for the left , atheism is supposed to mean just anti-christianity . 
  definitely discrimination . 
  does religion destroy morals ? 
  i 'd say christian churches ( those which still resist the `` tolerance and inclusion '' culture ) are among the few institutions guarding morals and tradition . 
  reeeeeeeeeeee trump supporters politicizing a disaster to make themselves look like good people !!, 
   enjoy your job as a `` forecaster '', 
  there 's an old soviet joke from 1970s about this ... 
  `` we can do weather forecast , but it 's only 40 % correct most of the time . '', 
  `` i have an idea how to increase accuracy by 20 % instantly . '', 
  `` how ? '', 
  `` very easy , just say the exact opposite of what you 're usually saying . '',
