  it 's a 98 % `` muslim country '' but they 're very secular . 
  it 's like people who check off `` christian '' on a census but never go to church , or have ever read bible , it 's just what they call themselves . 
  that 's a part of why it is interesting : the government is trying to prevent the country from becoming * actually * muslim . 
  really ? 
  as someone living in europe , it 's no go zones for us . 
  for liberals , it should be go-zones , but for whatever reason , they 're underutilized by them . 
  do they not like the results of their beliefs about multiculturalism , diversity , peacefulness of islam , integration of african migrants , beauty of me/north african cultures , as opposed to primitiviness and backwardness of the west ? 
  i , for one , would welcome american liberals , for whom chicago , detroit , camden , dearborn are not enough of an experience , to visit european no-go zones . 
  it 's a whole new kind of cultural experience , immersion into diversity , and the inhabitants there will certainly love these visitors . 
   if he speaks out about it , he will get arrested and sent to jail, 
  hahah , they wo n't speak out about it . 
  it could damage reputation of muslims and cause some more xenophobia . 
  they will advocate sending those who do speak out to jail , though . 
  perhaps it 's some people from israeli politics ? 
  collect them all !, 
  as in , native american or an ashkenazi trans-jew from india ? 
  punch her !, 
  * undocumentedly, 
  really ? 
  i thought all jews were rothschilds / s, 
  london is leading the world in the number of acid attacks . 
  it began with muslims ( pakistanis ) but other kinds of criminals and gangs got inspired by that since , i read some time ago on the telegraph i think . 
  [ no , it 's muslims ] ( https://www.rt.com/usa/402581-isis-hails-hurricane-irma-soldier-of-allah/ ) !, 
  islam is a religion of climate change !, 
  it 's a screenshot of a comment posted by someone else . 
  several days ago it was here with the name and a photo uncensored . 
  first pages of top israeli newspapers, 
   there will neither be sufficient resources for moscow to sustain the region , nor an effective security apparatus to compel unity . 
  as a russian , this is a ridiculous assumption . 
  it is based on the belief that the `` unity '' is compelled , rather than that russia is a country linked by more than some kind of violent power and that it will dissolve the moment there is not `` sufficient tyranny '' . 
  it did not dissolve after it was literally divided and separated in 13th-15th century , operating as , as the author says , `` a confederation at best '' . 
  the country is not controlled by one city , the `` security apparatus '' exists in the whole country . 
   russian military might will increase in the early phases of its terminal crisis causing tensions with poland , but will fade as its core economic and political problems become less manageable, 
  american dream , but since we survived 1990s when there were actual `` core economic and political problems '' , and actual separatism , i doubt it will be getting worse , as the country is becoming more consolidated . 
   they will go home, 
  i know a woman who lived in new orleans but moved to a different state after katrina . 
  reeeee you 're wrong bigot , we need to keep all the illegals !!, 
  poor muslims in myanmar !, 
  [ catchy accordion music starts playing ], 
  they 're not , but without them there 'd be no need for looting , because there 'd be eqwuality and everyone would be living in peace and plenty !, 
  you and your slavery did this , it 's just called income redistribution and it 's for progress !, 
   women like to be gang-raped . 
  yeah reading his `` literature '' it was surprising he 'd be the one outraged about the `` grab her by the p * ssy '' tape lol, 
  this is what social justice looks like !, 
  it 's the continuation of the relentless attacks on hispanics . 
  gave a million to texas , took a million from florida ... 
  here have a turtle . 
  why is it okay to kill a child in a womb , but not when it leaves the womb ? 
  it 's the same child . 
  yet everyone would be appaled at the latter , while the former is a `` women 's right '' . 
  nsfl for some perhaps . 
   i 'm not religious, 
  and it 's crazy how many people assume to you need to be in order to be pro-life , and there 's no argument for it except for being some kind of `` extreme christian '' . 
   accepted , but commonplace, 
  and `` progressive '', 
   i was shocked to see that title, 
  i was n't really shocked because i expected it would either be a meme or mocking someone using words like `` supremacist '' inappropriately . 
  an actual nazi thing would n't make it to the top here . 
  i 'd agree , it 's more like india and pakistan , as indians are saying . 
  india is a secular and tolerant country because it 's 80 % hindu , not 80 % muslim ... while pakistan is reverse . 
  it is , we 're just pretending we 're not until we can come out / s, 
  supposedly the one in the hospital is fake . 
  ( http://www.snopes.com/photos/medical/klaner.asp ), 
  i am russian and i 'd dare say you 're utterly ignorant about russian attitudes - quoting kasparov quite proves that , since he 's a fringe minority of pro-western liberals in russia , not a mainstream politician . 
  no , it was not `` proven '' that putin `` false-flagged '' chechen islamic terrorism , it is nothing more than a version , and no more probable than `` bush did 9/11 '' . 
  most of the terrorist groups that have operated in chechnya are recognized as terrorist by the us as well ( like caucasus emirate and the islamic bridages ) . 
  i am russian and you 're correct . 
  there will be commemorations but it will mostly be communists/nostalgia people , it 's not really a `` national holiday '' , but it 's a very important historical date in general . 
  as for the lenin statues , they 're just there . 
  they do n't carry much significant meaning , it 's just that no one bothers to remove them or sees a reason why it should be made ( i am fine with them personally ) , it 's just a historical personality and a part of heritage from the past , they 're not really controversial . 
  if we had flightradar24 back then ... 
  you make 100 % sense . 
  islam apologetics are forgetting how many people , at any moment , are suffering under that ideology right now , but they keep defending it because it makes them feel righteous and tolerant , instead of defending those who are fighting against it . 
  [ there really are people who hate ex-muslims . 
  why are any immigrants entitled to paid anything by the state ? 
  how did it come so far that they 're talking about `` immigration status : none '' as a normal , regular thing ? 
  also , you 're correct , undocumented and illegal is not the same thing , it does not carry the equal meaning . 
  if you record the number and data about `` undocumented '' immigrants , they 're no longer undocumented -- but they 're still * illegal * . 
  just because you document a crime taking place does n't make it any less of a crime . 
  based ... microsoft ? 
  innocent arab pilots lost their lives !, 
   islam is used as a tool to create terrorism so our military can go solve it . 
  but islam had been radicalizing people since long before the us even existed . 
  i would take greater israel over what 's going on in the middle east now . 
  actually , i 'd just take greater israel instead of muslims . 
  the real privilege ? 
  not having to live in congo . 
  that 's because of discrimination and bigoted cops !,

  it 's in america that this would be branded `` supremacy '' and whatnot . 
  in europe it 's not `` shocking '' , that 's just what native germans look like . 
  no one would be outraged by seeing a chinese poster featuring chinese people , or a turkish poster featuring turks .
