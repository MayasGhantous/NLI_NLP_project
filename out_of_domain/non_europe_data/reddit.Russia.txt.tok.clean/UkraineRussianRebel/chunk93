  i saw it on t_d last year but yesterday it was on top of all in pics sub . 
  are n't those illegals mostly latinos ? 
  hispanic privilege !, 
  `` omg the south is full of inbred rednecks , lol ! '', 
  `` it is discrimination you can not have intercourse with your siblings ! '', 
  -- also them, 
  read lee kuan yew , from third world to first ( former leader of singapore ) . 
  you can keep the theory going : he enjoyed the feeling of dominating her , perpetuating supremacy . 
  do n't be fooled , that 's what he did !, 
   hopefully trump does not agree . 
  do you mean ... that ... trump should stand against gender equality and disrespect women ????!!!, 
  # [ you ca n't be serious !!!!!!!!!!!,

  [ this many ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8lihzdfmfm ), 
  fun fact : eu investment funds ( esf , erdf ) are assessing the `` projected impacts on gender equality '' before approving funding for a project , and those applying for funding have to supply an explanation of how it will `` advance or not harm the gender equality '' . 
  i assume trudeau is getting inspired by that . 
  he may be on par with the honest abe ` incoln . 
  you , know the guy hillary clinton attacked . 
  [ honest abe !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/4chsf_8v0xk?t=27s ), 
  i was guessing . 
  serbia , bosnia , slovenia ? 
  turns out malaysia has names that could as well be slavic haha, 
  albania, 
  uzbekistan ( [ lol ] ( https://www.rt.com/news/383774-uzbek-imam-ban-male-gynecologists/ ) ), 
  i 'd go to riyadh , it 's a safer muslim city than paris . 
  honestly , i refuse to believe this , this sounds like alarmism . 
  on the same day this article was published on the site ( hungarian free press ) , there were other articles - in `` non-vigilante '' media - saying he refused the migrant quotas ( as did slovakia ) , merkel scolded him for `` violating eu law '' , and orban has attacked juncker , saying that `` he notes the decision of the eu court but will not take an take any refugees '', 
  look : ( september 8 ), 
   the stinging rebuke came after the european commission president wrote to mr orb\u00e1n accusing him of turning down help to deal with the country 's migrant crisis . 
  mr juncker accused the country of a lack of solidarity by making demands on funding while rejecting the eu dictat on migrant quotas . 
  but , in response , mr orb\u00e1n declared himself `` stunned and puzzled '' , claiming mr juncker was trying to turn hungary into an `` immigrant country '' using `` violence '' . 
  he wrote in a letter to mr juncker : `` hungary ... is not an immigrant country , *** does not want to become an immigrant country and can not accept being forced to change this . 
  they did not bend . 
  orban will definitely do what you 're saying . 
  i just do n't think on the fact that one of the most prominent european conservatives would , just one month away from achieving his goal and holding the fortress , just give up and give in to the eu . 
  i think this article is wrong , the leftist media would have been celebrating , but there 's basically no mention of this . 
  true . 
  look up the videos of rapefugees arriving at the budapest central station in 2015 , en route to germany . 
  no way hungarians would allow something like this to settle in their country permanently . 
  i live in europe and i took a business class in high school a few years ago , we played [ this coca cola superbowl ad ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rimmpfcy-hu ) . 
  the teacher asked : `` why do you think it 's controversial in america ? 
  what could people find objectionable ? '', 
  i just said : `` well the demographics seem really off , i mean , that 's not really america 's demographic composition . '', 
  yeah . 
  also , the ad is partly in spanish lol, 
  hispanics . 
  many hispanic people look completely european . 
  i mean , look at / ourguy / pinochet haha, 
   tell it to someone who cares , eric . 
  seriously . 
  i guess the tweet first shows up on the pages of those who follow him , and these people presumably care . 
  thus he had to purposely go on eric trump 's page to look what he is posting , and then proclaim he does n't care . 
   `` kill it with fire ! '', 
   said about baby, 
   by a liberal, 
  still stunned about the evolution the word ` liberal ' has gone through to acquire it 's contemporary meaning . 
  and you know what ? 
  trump is actually orange . 
  almost every decent liberal has commented on this . 
  he is a person of color . 
  this ignorant `` jemelle hill '' does n't know what she 's talking about and is just being plainly bigoted . 
  if the president is a neo-nazi , that would probably be the case , but as far as i know none of american presidents were neo-nazis . 
   walls ... unpatriotic with doors and such . 
  it 's a big beautiful door for legal immigrants . 
  `` red state '' is a subtle insult to native americans !, 
  omg republicans , can they ever stop being such bigots ?!, 
  okay , 1984 is not a handy reference to anything you want it to mean , the book has a meaning , you ca n't interpret it to mean just absolutely anything , hillary/leftists/liberals ... just like not everything can be called neo-nazism or fascism , those words have meanings . 
  ( but this also applies to conservatives who call just about anything `` communism '' tbh , that word also has a fairly definite historical meaning , and colluding with massive private corporations is not exactly it ), 
  if they trusted the media , they 'd know the party is right !, 
  haha , i live in europe and one conservative anti-islam politician has organized a `` community dog walking in front of the town mosque '' in the most heavily muslim town lol . 
  the muslims could n't get too violent though because it 's central/eastern europe and everyone ca n't stand them here . 
   paul ryan commits suicide, 
   ... politically, 
  nytimes actually wrote that india has an `` ugly bigotry problem '' not so long time ago ... 
  india has had a problem with muslims for a long time ... long before modern globalism was a thing , but it 's definitely intensifying . 
  during obama 's presidency modi was persona non grata in the us until he became prime minister of india . 
  i was quite surprised that in the us red = conservative , pretty much everywhere in the world red = left wing . 
  now i know why . 
  i think it was n't us downvoting him , and now he 's upvoted , so your comment looks a bit awkward . 
  i am at a fairly cucked social science department in university ( in europe ) and the profs do make jabs at various `` populist parties '' but are never explicit about the names , let alone telling whom to vote for . 
  we do n't have any `` social justice activism '' classes and protesting does not give you any credits in anything , this gives me hope lol . 
  american universities like evergreen or what has happening at yale with the halloween costumes sounds totally insane . 
  i ca n't imagine just standing up during the class a yell at a lecturer or something . 
  americans need to take their education system back . 
   be democrat, 
   say you hate classism, 
   `` but who will be my cheap servant whom i can blackmail into working almost for free or i 'll report them to ice if we deport the illegals ??? '', 
  it 's complete insanity . 
  i am pretty certain all these concepts they are using matter-of-factly , like [ insert skin color ] privilege , are extremely dubious and would not stand to any actual scientific challenge . 
  it 's a made up nonsense , it 's not real , it 's not `` social science '' . 
  science is gathering data . 
  they 're already providing a propagandist explanation for what is happening in society , just blaming one group of people for everything . 
  it 's not because he 's offending him/her . 
  well , it could as well be in law school , who knows . 
  but i assume law school would be more serious than this propaganda . 
  yep , did n't want to sound arrogant but 250 words was minimum essay/prompt length when i was freshman in high school . 
   withdrawing from the class . 
  university response : do n't wan na check your privilege huh, 
  but that 's institutionalized privilege !,
