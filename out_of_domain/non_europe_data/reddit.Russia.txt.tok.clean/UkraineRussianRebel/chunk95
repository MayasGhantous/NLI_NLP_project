  saudi arabia has a [ border fence ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-m1yqml9dzqg/vo-17mhhxbi/aaaaaaaanvc/uqsvw5avcic/s1600/%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b3%d9%8a%d8%a7%d8%ac%2b%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b3%d8%b9%d9%88%d8%af%d9%8a%2b%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b9%d8%b1%d8%a7%d9%82%d9%8a.jpg ) with sensors and quicksand on the border with iraq . 
   rohingya have been saved ( ... ) want to move to eu / us . 
  do n't give merkel any ideas !, 
   nobody will read it, 
  ha ha, 
  but she 's slovenian . 
  still balkans though . 
  but she 's a citizen . 
  michael, 
  can you sue if you 're not satisfied with america and think you 've been scammed ? 
  [ he he ] ( https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2014/01/the_world_s_biggest_tea_drinkers_average_annual_tea_consumption_chartbuilder_1-1/7b49f7ac0.png ), 
  i live in a eastern eu country . 
  a politician has recently said something `` xenophobic . '', 
  publically . 
  some cuck political operative with `` experience working in british and german political campaigns '' was interviewed by the media and he was outraged , saying that `` in the west it would be the instant end of his campaign , even xenophobic ukip would n't allow him to run with their label , here in the uncivilized east the party leadership just shurgs and says ` well that 's his opinion ' '', 
  i 'm here thinking like `` well is n't it good that no one is going to jail , gets fined and that people are not afraid to voice their opinions ? '', 
  people are acting like removing isis , al-quaeda , al-shabab , etc. 
  would just end the islamic problem . 
  it 's not the problem !, 
  it 's a consequence and sympton , organized terror groups are merely crystalized version of the islamic ideology , the fact most of the terrorists `` inspired by isis '' have never had contact with anyone in syria , iraq and so on is the proof of this . 
  we need a separation of employment and politics . 
  they do n't have the persuasion . 
  they always come later with some low-energy conspiracy theory that is way too easy to disprove . 
  point 8 ? 
  this may be a `` privilege '' if you 're asian . 
  asians are known to be hardworking !, 
  the thing is , considering this is an american book , it is obviously way easier to buy `` postcards , books and whatever '' , or open a newspaper , or turn tv , and see `` your people '' instead of `` black people '' , because they 're only 13 % of the population . 
  it would be strange if this were not the case , and then you would know you live in a society that is trying hard to overrepresent a `` minority '' . 
  i clicked and i must say , i do n't know , i 'm really disappointed pedes . 
  there will be no wall , and i would n't be surprised if trump joined the democratic party soon . 
  seems like we have been conned and he 's really been a hillary plant all along !, 
  going for the classic `` we 're all human '' . 
  not seeing the forest for the trees is another way to describe it . 
  you 're right that the hypothetical blocking from a business is a weird example , because this is one thing entirely dependent on behavior of an individual , but when you meet a person from group where hypothetically 99.9 % of people are violent , it is absolutely justified and not `` morally wrong '' to avoid them . 
  why ? 
  it 's interesting . 
  agreed -- like keeping the shops open during a demonstration . 
  not all demonstrators are violent , but people still tend to close their shops . 
  justifiable against every single member of a group it is not . 
  you are still judging the people who do not fall into the `` typical adverse behavior '' group . 
  but we are speaking probabilities . 
  but those africans and muslims running into europe are not our neighbors , and if they were , they would n't be good ones . 
  oh no , they ca n't go home until their countries will be at the level of germany , that would disadvantage them and they would n't have `` equal opportunity '' , they 're staying here in europe !!!, 
  ( obviously they should go home , but they will resist that ... ), 
  and berlin wall worked fairly well , so no objections to the technology . 
  the hungarian fence should be electric , too . 
  it may cost more but it 's still lower cost than letting those migrants in . 
  this is scarier than regular terror attacks with bombs ... you have a very high chance of survival , but you will be , literally , scarred for life . 
  french supremacists . 
  le pen voters . 
  we all know how developed is anti-americanism in france . 
  french are simple people , they hear english , they see americans , they throw acid . 
  there was no blood after the somali policeman of diversity shot the australian woman : /, 
  cool chemistry project ahmed, 
  very likely muslim woman , with the real motivation being concealed as `` psychological problem '' , like all isis terrorists are `` mistreated '' / `` marginalized '' immigrant youth . 
  i am not ruling out it could have been a french/european/whatver non-muslim inspired by islamic attacks , that is entirely possible . 
  ( i did read the article btw ), 
  `` i hate nazis '' omg stop being bigoted against germans !!!, 
  `` i think communism is stupid '' oh here you are , hating russians !, 
  `` mao was n't a good leader '' can you stop being a xenophobe to chinese ? 
  `` fascism is a failed system '' so what , are we hating on italians again ???!!, 
   and msm probably calls them english people . 
  british . 
  because , you know , having a british passport makes you british . 
  there is nothing other than passport to being british or european according to some . 
  i would n't go to france . 
  and juncker proposed that we have a `` single eu president and finance minister '' , so we are `` united states of europe '' . 
  sadly it 's germany and france that are biggest countries . 
  if this happens , their political class will also be our political class in central/eastern eu . 
  and that would be absolutely horrifying . 
  even if there is a direct election of eu president accross all countries , or a parliament that actually has legislative powers , there is nearly 100 % chance of the winner being a leftist ( even if masquerading as a `` right winger '' ) , and parliament controlled by leftists ( germany has plenty of seats there ) . 
  leave eu now . 
  on one side , it would be great if there were a country where `` indecent vocabulary '' would be the biggest problem . 
  but there is no such place in the world ( maybe singapore ? 
  ) , and definitely not america . 
  or possibly an actual psychological problem , inspired by isis/muslims . 
  very unlikely but possible . 
   the worst part is they do n't even realize the race exists . 
  at 2:10 in this video , [ the muslim teacher totally destroys liberal arguments about ` coexistence ' ] ( https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=708_1470922102 ), 
  talking to these multiculturalist people , they sound so extremely ignorant and naive about the reality of the world . 
  even if we `` love everyone '' , muslims will merely use it as a weakness on the part of kaffirs . 
  oppressing muslims in myanmar , yeah , f * ck buddhists / s, 
  because france is no longer france . 
  * france * is no longer * france * . 
  oh , by the way , have you been to brussels ? 
  it was a beautiful city . 
  now it 's a hellhole . 
  these new immigrant people are not paying anything into the social system , they 're completely dependent on it , for generations . 
  it 's a delusion that they will work or pay taxes , or boost economy . 
  do n't fall for that nonsense . 
  we 're feeding them , they 're not feeding us ( native europeans ) . 
  would n't be surprised if not majority , then a large plurality , at least in bigger cities , already knew this well . 
  they have black market , smuggled newspapers , phones from china etc. , access to south korean movies . 
  i agree with you on the middle east ( i 'm russian : admitting bias and conflict of interest ) , but i do n't think this will be the case in north korea . 
  in the middle east , there were countries living in accordance with their culture whose governments were toppled , and then infighting among muslim sects broke out , which was boiling underneath the stability . 
  north korea , on the other hand , is a stable one-party system , would n't be surprised if they eventually turned out the way south korea ( which was conquered by the us ) did some time down the road . 
  are we sure we are dealing with a madman ? 
  he may not `` respect rules of the war '' , but assault on the south would mean his destruction , and the end of the nk regime . 
  i believe that 's what he 's counting on : the possibility that he may destroy the south would prevent the us from attacking nk .
