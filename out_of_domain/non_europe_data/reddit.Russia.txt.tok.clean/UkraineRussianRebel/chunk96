   cucked countries whining about it, 
  like america ever cared about that , lol !, 
  i mean , the us does n't really care about opinion of other nato countries on their actions , the problem would be what it would do with china , russia etc. 
  but the latter two would likely deal with that , no one is going to go to war with the us over nk ( proxy war , perhaps , funding nk weapons etc. , that 's possible ) . 
  can confirm , would add slovakia , slovenia , croatia to that list . 
  me neither . 
  see no flair indicating whether this is real or not , but am leaning towards it 's not . 
  it ca n't be . 
  come on . 
  it 's jokes, 
  not for feminists, 
  everyone is a person of color . 
  show me a transparent colorless person !, 
  i live in europe and it 's astounding how liberals are using children in their politics to give themselves that perception of innocence . 
  children holding `` refugees welcome '' signs or `` i do n't want to live in a country of xenophobia '' . 
  my thought is that his the future the parent ( s ) wish for that child is one with terror , violence and constant cultural conflict . 
  i wo n't deny conservatives do stuff like that , too . 
  but we `` use '' children to convey the message that we need our countries to be safe for their future , while libs are using them purely as `` look at this innocent kid against `` fascism '' '' . 
  fascists were obsessed with order and aesthetics . 
  why do n't you just let the beautiful grass grow , organically ?!!!, 
  omg this is so fascism , i ca n't even . 
   they 're nazis too, 
  [ of course they are ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pjwkxwd7wlo/uhttlsbosvi/aaaaaaaaamo/tkj90xbeuce/s1600/indian+nazi.jpg ) !, 
  [ all of them ] ( https://deliriumclemensdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/hitler-shop.jpg ) !, 
  [ it 's no coincidence trump supporters love sikhs !,

  i am a dreamer , but an asian guy stole my place at mit and now i ca n't study there for freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, 
  they 've bought the whole `` illegals are entitled to everything '' . 
  if they went to high school , it was likely in a `` sanctuary city '' , where they believe this . 
  then they crash into the real world . 
  they use words like ` rape ' and ` genocide ' in the most inappropriate situations . 
  a girl put her hand on my knee and held it there during class . 
  it was extremely nsfw . 
  i did n't use elevator until i was 10 , and walked 8 floors every day . 
  i was really scared of elevators , that it could fail , fall , whatever . 
  especially glass elevators . 
  now i like glass elevators . 
  the doctor is dr. rand paul . 
  not correct . 
  people who dislike muslims are islamophobic . 
  ` racist ' can be used for ethnicities . 
  people who hate arabs for being arab would be that , but disliking muslims is an opposition to an ideology . 
  i 've heard of `` elbridge gerry memorial prize for creative geography '' . 
  ewww, 
  no , it 's a nazi thing . 
  dogs are violent , that 's why i do n't like them . 
  dogs have always disliked me , bark at me etc. , since childhood . 
  ironically , to this explanation , people would say `` it 's because they feel you 're a bad person !!, 
  and bad people do n't like dogs !, 
  '' , that kind of circular explanation . 
  the russian bots, 
  not hotel employee but worst guest , ama . 
  never noticed . 
  i do n't look at colbert all that of then though lol, 
  if they are capable of breaking others down , they 're strong . 
  do n't make all this `` omg if you belittle other people you must be weak '', 
  also i believe in hitler 's germany , people were encouraged to have hunter guns and hunting was quite popular . 
  not sure about stalinist ussr , but it was similar in respect to hunting guns after stalin . 
  these pictures do have some accuracy but they are n't always correct , so i take it with a grain of salt . 
  from `` gun legislation in germany '' article on wikipedia :, 
   gun restriction laws applied only to handguns , not to long guns or ammunition . 
  the 1938 revisions completely deregulated the acquisition and transfer of rifles and shotguns , and the possession of ammunition . 
   the legal age at which guns could be purchased was lowered from 20 to 18 . 
  permits were valid for three years , rather than one year . 
   more classes of user were exempt from the requirement to hold an acquisition permit ; holders of annual hunting permits , government workers , and nsdap ( the national socialist german workers ' party ) members were no longer subject to gun ownership restrictions . 
  prior to the 1938 law , only officials of the central government , the states , and employees of the german reichsbahn railways were exempted . 
  illegals do n't care about being friends with you . 
  their desire is to stay in the us , and continue to reap the benefits they have . 
  if you start compromising with trump , you are no longer useful for them , nor for their supporters . 
  wait , no way do leftists think that muslims are voting liberal because they support `` socially progressive causes '' , and not because `` social progressives '' happen to be pro-muslim ? 
   should be taken with a grain of salt . 
  as a non-sjw , this should be obvious to reader of any newspapers/media . 
  i assume people do n't just believe everything , but if some do , that 's also their problem . 
  so i guess i am a bad person because i happen to have jewish relatives ? 
  shoes . 
  they 're getting so comfortable as they 're getting closer to their falling apart time . 
   mettling, 
  ftfy, 
  plenty of actual anti-hillary accounts were described as `` fake russian accounts '' . 
  that 's why so many hillary voters apparently still believe that trump `` stole '' the election , they ca n't believe there were people on twitter and fb who actually did n't support her . 
  if the voters were influenced , could that really count as `` meddling '' ? 
  i mean , voting is a voluntary decision . 
  one would need to shield their citizens from any kind of `` biased ( foreign ) information '' in order to avoid that . 
  some people may have been swayed by a chinese newspaper global times to having a certain belief etc. , or decided to vote against trump after reading der spiegel and so on . 
  would you really complain though ? 
  my life sucks and i upvoted . 
  pillars of peace  religion of `` peace '', 
  did he ? 
  i remember they were attacking him on day 1 . 
  i heard them laughing and clapping ... not gasping ? 
  why go as far as lebanon ... we have balkans in the backyard , and some people still do n't get it . 
   soft-genocide the sami, 
  hehe . 
  what do finns/swedes etc. 
  have against samis ? 
  they 're like a totally benign population lol, 
  it may be the same thing that causes liberals to think that `` no one voted for trump '' - they surround themselves with other liberals . 
  i hope that most swedes are based though . 
  what did he do ? 
  we are n't becoming hardline right .
