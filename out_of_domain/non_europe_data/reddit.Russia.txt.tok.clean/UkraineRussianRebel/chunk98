   he is a nerd, 
  hahaha , that 's totally my impression of him as well . 
  i came from a family of three brothers , my name is muhammad , this is my younger brother mohamed and this is my older brother , muhamet , and a fourth one is on the way , we will name him mehmet . 
  read through the other posts on this thread . 
  there 's plenty of cases where doctors did n't listen to their patients listed here alone . 
  it did n't even cross my mind someone would make this a `` not listening to women issue '' , but everything can be interpreted in this way if you really want it . 
  trump is not just `` some american president '' , like brexit was not just a british thing . 
  it 's a global patriotic movement , and people should learn and get inspired by each other . 
  i am not american as well , and i believe it is not only acceptable but good that the patriotic movements in respective countries are inspiring each other and cooperating in this way . 
   trump energy doesnt stop at american borders . 
  the energy is contagious !, 
   western economics with old ussr dictatorship, 
  i am russian and would disagree with this one . 
  there are different opinions , also within russia , not just abroad , on whether we have a `` dictatorship '' ( imposed top-down ) or a `` strong government '' ( supported by most ) , but it 's not related to ussr . 
  unlike in china , vietnam etc. , where there is a `` communist '' party in power which formally still follows the socialist ideology but has in reality abandoned it for a full market/mixed economy , the current government in russia does not reference the ussr , makes links to communism or considers itself a `` reformed socialist '' . 
  it 's more a conservative government than it is `` leftist '' , in a way they see ussr as a part of russian history , not negating it , but at the same time it is not making any special effort to point out communism as the `` best part '' of russian history . 
  so you 're right there 's a `` weird breed '' : on one side , putin considers the failure to reform the ussr the way chinese did with their country a `` tragedy '' , but at the same time has called lenin and the bolsheviks `` terrorists who destroyed russia '' etc. 
  terrible . 
  not sure if total submissive cuck or actual jewish conspiracy, 
  if netanyahu said that , it would 've been hilarious !, 
  and then , in the electoral debate , he tried to attack merkel on `` letting too many migrants in . '', 
  now this is what i call populism !, 
  no one should fall for that . 
  with brexit , they got more powerful . 
  this is why we need a conservative , pro-european germany . 
  not pro-eu , pro-europe . 
   the economist . 
  most renowned economic magazine with the most intelligent and knowledgeable experts !, 
  if i have opinions , i only get them from the economist !, 
   we are continually told that the only way to sustain it is my immigration, 
  this is one of the most ridiculous leftist arguments . 
  the immigrants - at least those europe is getting these days and has been getting for decades - are not contributors to our social systems in europe , they are dependents . 
  the macron claim that `` they boost our economy '' is nonsense , most of those guys arriving on boats can barely read , in their own languages , at the very best , they will do some low-paid manual labor , but they wo n't because europeans will pay for their welfare , as long as we have these governments that extend it to them . 
  other than that , i do n't see much difference between our healthcare systems and regular insurance . 
  they 're `` universal insurance '' . 
  everyone pays , everyone gets a service . 
  in this i totally disagree with most of t_d that `` socialist '' medicine sucks , it is no better to pay some private insurance company than it is to pay the state for insurance -- the former tends always to be cheaper than private . 
  he is a monster . 
  but that comments like this would be made was sadly so predictable . 
  is that guy an american or european ? 
  because why would a brit [ put this on their backpack ?

  currently i am somewhere between being far right and neo-nazi . 
  i expect that in a week , i will be a literally hitler , then it will decrease to the good old `` chauvinist nationalist '' , fine . 
   julius daugbjerg bjerrek\u00e6r was the man in the maga, 
  i love the fact he 's not american . 
  this is priceless . 
   it was a wrong speech , at the wrong time , for the wrong audience, 
  swedish foreign minister . 
  they 're not doing it right . 
   journalist, 
  predictable personality typology . 
   estrogen filled, 
  he 's gay . 
  i do n't know about `` gay genes '' or if they found what causes it yet , but recently there 's been an article that ai face recognition has been capable of establishing a person 's sexual orientation with high accuracy . 
  i mean , something is causing them to be attracted to the same gender , so perhaps there is some `` femininity '' and abundance of feminine hormones . 
  you 're right , i am one , just that it 's more usual to see people around the world supporting trump than it is to see non-american liberals supporting hillary . 
  maybe it 's perspective bias . 
  but also probably because clinton was never `` as exciting '' as trump was : she was just a regular liberal politician , trump was something new , and a type of politician we do have in europe but who are generally not in power . 
  so while clinton represented the `` liberal standard '' , trump represented a new hope for conservatives and patriots : so conservatives around the world ( europe in particular ) were more active with supporting trump than liberals were with clinton , trump was easier to make into a symbol , while clinton was not . 
  that said , it could as well possibly be `` confirmation bias '' . 
  i am russian and can confirm , i put a free pro-trump ad on facebook in the form of posting some meme . 
  i also liked his page , thus his increasing the number of russians following him by at least one . 
  i sincerely believe i was not influenced by putin or the kremlin to do so , but considering that 3000 `` russian ads '' have tipped the american election in trump 's favor , who knows what mental tricks they can use ... maybe i was n't even aware of receiving subconscious instructions . 
  it does n't matter that you leave the eu if you still keep the borders open . 
  it 's european `` conservatives '' . 
  standard republican politicians would be just as boring and low energy . 
  think bush . 
  british conservative party are the bushes . 
  they do say the iranians , the chinese etc. 
  and so on though . 
  to me it seems that they use `` regime '' in case of countries where they do n't believe the population to have agency of their own : iraqi reqime , north korean government etc. , like they ca n't be aware of what 's going on . 
  another thing is , they did try to separate `` russians the people '' from `` russians the regime '' , john mccain even published an article in a russian newspaper ( pravda ) some 5 years ago saying we `` deserve much better than putin '' . 
  but then it seems they have realized that it 's not really an `` evil regime occupying russia '' , so we are `` complicit '' as a whole . 
  of course , what i meant is that controlling immigration ( which leaving the eu significantly simplifies ) is still very important - once can open the borders regardless of eu . 
  to each their own . 
  to some people , these rights are very important . 
  it 's their culture , we need to respect it !, 
  #fake news !!!, 
  #stop the hammering !!, 
  fotunately it 's a camouflage hat , not the easier to recognize from distance red one . 
  ah , the `` start treating maga hats like swastika '' approach . 
  germany is already a pretty great place tbh . 
  the thing they 're missing is security , healthy patriotism and a government that supports the people . 
  make germany safe again !, 
  there are over 450 acid attacks in london every year . 
  if they can get this as low as 364 , it will be impressive . 
  on average less than one attack per day . 
  those old people were probably bitter trump voters anyway , so this is totally justified !, 
  also remember dylann roof !, 
  i listened to the report on the radio ( in europe ) which cited american newspaper reports ... 
  initially i thought it was either some crazy guy ( like shool shooters ) , someone getting inspired by charleston , or a `` revenge '' shooting . 
  could n't tell who did it from the reports , turned out to be the last one . 
   start behaving already, 
  hopefully i am not violating rule 3 of this subreddit [ but ... ] ( https://static.iq-research.info/20150809/img/iq_by_country.png ), 
   ohsnapyougotserved , wherever you are, 
  she 's actually here , she just has a different username . 
  ca n't remember exactly but it also begins with `` ohsnapyougot ____ something '' , at least that 's what people say that it 's really her actual new account . 
  my american teacher ( i live in europe ) would always correct students who would say `` vietnam war '' , `` iraq war '' , `` afghanistan war '' that `` there is no war after wwii , just ` conflicts ' !, 
  funny but i always remembered that the us really did n't actually declare any wars after that .
