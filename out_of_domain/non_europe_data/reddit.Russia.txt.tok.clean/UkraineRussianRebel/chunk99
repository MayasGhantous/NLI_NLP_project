  is it ? 
  i am not american but standing up to a national anthem sounds like common sense ( at a mass gathering , i do n't stand up when i hear it on the radio for example haha ) . 
   pledge of allegiance is creepy as fuck . 
  i live in europe and while knowing what that is , i believed americans did it only on special or celebratory occassions . 
  i had a teacher from texas in high school and she commented once that `` doing pledge of allegiance every day was getting really , really annoying after some time . '', 
  the entire class was like `` what ?! '' . 
  this was the moment i learned it was an everyday thing , and i kind of agree with your comment that while it 's not `` creepy '' , it seems * really * excessive . 
   most people really do n't care .

  was she banned from entire reddit ? 
  or just forced not to be a mod ? 
  i 'd like to do this but there 's no viable alternative now , and so i am keeping my gmail and searching google . 
  i am aware that by doing this , i am doing a tiny part to prevent a viable alternative from rising up more easily . 
  i always pronounced it like that . 
  but i do n't live there nor do i know anyone from there . 
   so why is he treating the situations so differently ? 
  virtually no one also endorsed those protesters , while a lot of people are calling the football kneeling `` brave '' and `` sending a message '' . 
  also , charlottesville protesters were not protesting against america as a country and the american flag , quite to the contrary . 
  they were protesting real issues ( removal of historical statues ) , not supposed `` police brutality '' against black people ( most killed not by police but in crime ) . 
  they 're explicitly anti-american . 
   unfair treatment of minorities by police in the us is a myth, 
  it is n't . 
  police is afraid of treating certain minorities equally , as that would lead to yelling about `` discrimination '' . 
  so they ignore a large part of crime not to arrest `` too many minorities '' .

  one time it fell into a water tube and got stuck in between the houses . 
  we thought it was gone , came back two days later . 
  no firemen had to be called . 
  i am a very serious moderator, 
  ... the real courage is to vote for trump and not give in to the liberals ' threats , blackmail and violence . 
  it 's our victories now, 
  i noticed comments stopped showing up on multiple threads . 
  on the conference one , it is sorted according to the newest ones . 
  the last comment that showed up is gathering plenty of upvotes ( which generally does n't happen in threads ordered by `` new '' as the comments disappear quickly ) , so i assume new comments do n't show up for others , too . 
  ... meanwhile i am imagining some isis guys in raqqa at the internet propaganda division watching the protests , dumbfounded at liberal americans protesting measures that will make it harder for terrorists to get in and attack them , but still feeling gratitude for those people 's stupidity . 
  i liked donald trump 's page on facebook , thus i 'll fail their employee vetting for dissenting opinions .

  the class is taught by an american visiting professor . 
  i am a regular reader of [ the college fix ] ( http://thecollegefix.com ) and [ fire ] ( http://thefire.org ) so i am aware of what 's going on in american higher education . 
  i have heard stories like george washington university [ dropping u.s. history as a requirement for * history * majors ] ( http://insider.foxnews.com/2016/12/26/george-washington-university-lifts-american-history-requirement-history-majors ) . 
  now i honestly think it , in some situations , can be a good thing , if that 's what 's going on at american universities . 
  learn from old books , learn yourself , from real history and not its `` critical analysis . '', 
  the guy is such a * cuck * , haha , it 's unbelievable . 
  it 's my inaugural use of the word :, 
  * `` there 's no left wing party in america !, 
  democrats are a tiny bit left to the republicans , but they 're still extreme right ! '', 
  * the american religious tradition is very strong . 
  especially among muslims , muslims are the most religious of all americans , muslims are the most believing people of all americans . 
  * dude , muslims are not believing because of `` american christian religious tradition , even if you insist they 're americans . 
  * donald trump is the embodiment of america . 
  he 's a true american . 
  * that 's a good thing , right ? 
  maybe this guy is actually just one of those anti-establishment bernie people ? 
  * oh , no , he actually just hates americans . 
   `` i am not defending socialism . 
  i am not saying socialism is good . '', 
  * goes on to defend socialism * `` americans are unbelievably selfish people by normal people 's standards . 
  you would n't believe how selfish , self-centered they are . 
  they reject even redistribution of property to help the disadvantaged because america is a selfish nation . 
  they only ever care about themselves . '', 
  * we will talk about slavery as a social sickness . 
  america has abolished slavery , but it still *** exists in the minds and hearts *** of all americans . 
  it 's used to rationalize the oppression of marginalized groups that we can not to this eradicate as every civilized country did !, 
  americans still hate everyone who 's not of european origin . 
  minorities have no rights !, 
  ** now this one got me the most **, 
   the american constitution was designed to restrict freedom . 
  the american government is extremely inefficient and this is because the constitution was made to prevent efficient action for the good of the people , for the government to actually do something . 
  instead , it 's all focused on not restricting individual rights , it does n't allow doing anything for the good of community . 
   the us constitution was designed to prevent minorities from participating , it is fundamentally a document that treats the rights of individuals as sacred even in a situation when entire groups of people are entirely marginalized . 
  i am reading the wikileaks vault7 but i am not cnn and i know it 's illegal for me . 
  can the cia get me outside the us ? 
  neocon and nevertrumper [ james kirchick ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/james_kirchick ) writes on [ politico ] ( http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/03/russias-plot-against-the-west-214925 ) :, 
   '' ( ... ) rather something more ethereal and imaginable : the slow , gradual reversion to the european state of nature prior to the postwar integration project , and the *** rise of amoral , prostrate , nationalist governments that no longer project the liberal values *** upon which the euro-atlantic community is grounded , and that are willing to engage in purely transactional relationships with moscow . 
  should this future scenario come to pass , it will be the fault of apathetic europeans , absent americans and aggressive russians . '', 
  we all know why, 
  `` oh i did n't really see the news yesterday , only a glimpse , what actually happened ? '', 
  `` oh idk , some guy stabbed some people in london near parliament ... 
  i think it was something about the scottish referendum , he wanted to prevent it or something '', 
  it 's no longer `` collateral damage '' , `` unintentional strike '' , just `` terrorists using human shields '' , but `` trump 's inexperience and desire to show resolution , to fulfill campaign promises of fighting isis which give military no time to prepare '' , `` failed hastily planned badly administered campaigns '' , `` disregard for human life and cruetly to civilians . '', 
  the us media have regularly reported like this on russian airstrikes : if obama 's bomb hit a hospital , it was a mistake , if a russian bomb did the same , it was a malicious intent , some desire to destroy lives of civilians . 
  now they report the same way on any military action trump takes or orders . 
  consider the yemen mission . 
  would that even be reported ? 
  how many american soldiers have fallen during obama 's administration and hillary clinton 's tenure as the secretary of state ? 
  a lot , probably , but i remember little criticism . 
  and if there was any , it always came with an excuse for `` why it could not be avoided '' .
