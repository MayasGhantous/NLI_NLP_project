  we shared some friends but there was always a cold divide . 
  we could n't share a beer . 
  conflicts create such divides , prejudices , and they are very difficult to mend . 
  again , if this makes you feel like you have to atone for whatever past sins , you 're welcome to it . 
  i have a different perspective on this , and i certainly do n't need atonement for whatever sins other nations have committed against my family . 
  a trite example perhaps , but still , the second world war was very brutal for my family ( as it was for many other families ) . 
  my russian , ukrainian and volga german ancestors of that time suffered greatly due to the invasion . 
  but i sure as hell do n't need any modern german i happen to meet in my life to atone for anything . 
  they are not the people who were responsible for anything . 
  i 've met plenty of germans and got on just fine and had a very nice time with many of them . 
  some of my ancestors were western ukrainians and the people in western ukraine have had to suffer bad treatment from the poles in the past . 
  still , i do n't particularly care about the modern poles and do n't really want anything from them . 
  i 've actually got on pretty well with most poles i have met abroad . 
  if anything it was due to getting more exposure to other cultures that i 've decided that i don \u00b4 t like this grovelling side of our mentality that comes out from time to time . 
  beating ourselves up for being russian is n't going to take us anywhere as a nation , though any individual who feels he must do that is of course welcome to it . 
  i 'm not from moscow or st pete , but i do n't know anybody who really cares about australians one way or the other . 
  personally , even if i might not like the actions of your government , that does n't mean i have any bad feelings about australians . 
  if you act like a normal , decent person , people will treat you accordingly . 
  you 'll be visiting the two biggest cities in russia that see a lot of tourists from all over . 
  do n't worry , you 'll be fine . 
   population is still shrinking though, 
  it 's not , though obviously the gains are there due to migration . 
  what do you mean by influence ? 
  there are indeed a few japanese buildings there , but apart from that , as i understand there 's not much influence . 
  if anything , it 's the korean influence , culturally speaking , that should be more noticeable . 
  since they 're the biggest minority on the island . 
  i like [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igqi8_ya1lo ) . 
  i have n't been to kazan , but i 've heard good things about it . 
  you ca n't say '' \u041e\u043d \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0448\u043d\u043e '' , it 's grammatically incorrect . 
  if you want to say `` he scares me '' it will be '' \u041e\u043d \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u043f\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442 '' . 
  what you can say is '' \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0448\u043d\u043e '' , it means `` i 'm scared '' . 
   i assume you are a white , not black/asian, 
  do n't feel like getting into a debate on exactly how racist the general russian public is , but the guy is in bashkiria of all places . 
  they 've got plenty of asian looking people there . 
  this is quite amusing , but i admit that i could n't place many of these ` stereotypes ' . 
  oh and why is belarus ` frankenstein ' and moldova ` barren ' ? 
  i do n't think that in general we know enough about the irish to have a lot of stereotypes about you . 
  it 's a pity really , i 've really liked the irish people when i 've visited ireland . 
  you 've also got plenty of beautiful scenery in your country , but i really liked your people most of all . 
  well , i can see the reasoning . 
  thanks for the explanation . 
  but i really would n't say that 's a popular stereotype about belarus , rather something about potatoes . 
  what do you think about moldova ? 
  to me as a native speaker the people from belarus , ukraine and russia all sound the same here . 
  there 's a difference in recording quality and i can hear the guy from ukraine most clearly . 
  but they all pronounce it the same to me . 
  recordings in bulgarian and mari kind of have a different sound , but that 's not strange i suppose . 
  the mari girl clearly stresses the ' \u043b\u044f ' and in russian that would be wrong . 
  in russian '' \u0432\u043e\u043b\u044f '' has a somewhat different connotation than '' \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u0430 '' . 
  i find it hard to find a direct translation and i think it 's explained quite well in that pdf about untranslatable words . 
  the word ( \u0432\u043e\u043b\u044f ) implies lack of constraint , natural freedom , even a state close to anarchy . 
  hmm , we do n't really have that expression in russian . 
  well , nowadays some people just use the direct translation from english , so '' \u0442\u044b \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043b \u043c\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c '' , '' \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043b\u0430 '' in my case since i 'm a girl . 
  there are obviously many expressions , somehow it 's quite hard to really give a list . 
  `` that gave me great joy '' , as in you liked it very much , can be '' \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c '' . 
  i found this book online that has [ 800 slang phrases in english and russian ] ( http://www.slideshare.net/larisaschooloflanguage/eight-hundred-english-slang-phrases-with-russian-explanation-larisa-school-of-language-nikolaev-ukraine-free-pdf-download ) . 
  this is actually intended for russian speakers who are learning english , but maybe it can be also helpful the other way around . 
  though i 'm not so sure , if your russian is very basic this will be too difficult for now . 
  but now that i think about it , there should also be similair lists of russian slang phrases if you look for them on the internet . 
  i would n't say that it actually bothers me . 
  often it does become clear from the context that i 'm actually female , then people will use the correct endings , if it 's not clear i 'll usually correct the person who 's ` misgendering ' me . 
  not a big deal . 
   feel free to share any russian music recommendations !!, 
  i 'm butting in , but here are some of the artists i occasionally listen to .

  hey , thanks for the gold !, 
  hope you 'll like some of it at least  i do n't know how familiar you are with russian music in general , or is all this new to you ? 
  i 'm a russian who lives in russia and i feel like people are way exaggerating in this thread . 
  no , most people wo n't think you 're insane if you smile walking around . 
  come on , insane ? 
  really ? 
  i have a pretty neutral resting face myself , but if i see somebody smiling on the street i certainly do n't presume them to be a fool or a psycho , i just do n't care really . 
  on a different note , i 've never been to the us , but from my time spent in various ( western ) european countries , i 've never felt like there was any substantial difference smiling wise . 
   can it be handed over to someone else ? 
  i 'm not sure , but i do n't think so . 
   i 've received one , but it 's hardly useful , except for highlighting new comments . 
  i suppose you could just see it as a sign of appreciation . 
  there might not be much practical use , but there 's a nice idea behind it . 
   actually , as americans , we 're more worried about being judged / ** killed ** just because we 're americans ... 
  i suppose i can kind of understand the ` worried about being judged ' part , but worried about getting killed just because you 're american ? 
  really ? 
  well , unless you actually go to an unstable region where there 's a military conflict going on , but anybody should be worried about getting killed in such places . 
  i have to ask . 
  what do you actually mean by this ? 
  i hope one day you get to visit and it 'll be a nice experience . 
  in general there are very few black people in russia , so you 'll be a very visible foreigner and that does bring extra attention . 
  we have our bigots obviously ( though black people are n't usually the primary focus of their bigotry ) , but there 'll also be people who are just genuinely very curious about somebody from a different background . 
   i 'll be teaching in harbin which is located in a chinese provence that borders russia . 
  i think the closest major russian city would be vladivostok . 
  yes , that should be quite doable from harbin . 
  google says there 's also a train that goes through harbin and vladivostok . 
  you 'll have to get a separate visa for russia though , and as i understand that can be a pain in the ass . 
  it would be very helpful to get at least a basic grasp of russian before you go , i do n't think many people in vladivostok really speak english . 
  i think one year is n't very much if you are n't actually surrounded by the language all the time . 
  do n't worry , you 'll get there eventually .
