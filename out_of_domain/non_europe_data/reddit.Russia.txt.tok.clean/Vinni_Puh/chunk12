  when i was learning english it helped me a great deal to watch movies in english , you get used to the sound of the language and pick up new vocab . 
  about the visa 's , i have no idea if it 's more difficult for americans right now . 
  i would hope not , but who knows . 
  winnie pooh is great , i 'm particularly fond of his singing . 
  maybe you already know this , but there are actually three episodes about winnie . 
  winnie pooh goes visiting is the second one , here 's [ the first one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bewe4wyz00o ) with english subs and [ the third one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_855369&amp;feature=iv&amp;src_vid=bewe4wyz00o&amp;v=svyzp0xks54 ) . 
  i also like some of \u0401\u043b\u043a\u0430 's stuff like [ \u0411\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0430\u0439 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzifxgkrhzi ) and [ \u041e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0431\u044f ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ihqrkbpqsg ) . 
  do n't know anybody who would seriously be in favour of crowning putin as czar . 
  though i imagine i do know some people who would sign this kind of a campaign as a joke . 
  since it 's not something that could ever realistically happen , but for some it 's funny to joke about . 
  i mean , i 'm sure there are * some * people who would be in favour of declaring putin to be our czar , or god , or whatever else . 
  since every place has got to have some crazy people . 
  from the more or less recent stuff i liked [ \u041b\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0430 17/legenda 17 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=my6rkgr4yek ) ( without eng subs ) ,, 
  [ \u041c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e / metro ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puu3rtac_hs ) ( without eng subs ) ,, 
  [ \u0411\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0440\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c / brest fortress ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j_wyxga9dc ) ( with eng subs ) ,, 
  [ \u041f\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440 fm/piter fm ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcztyiwls1e ) ( with eng subs ) ,, 
  [ \u0422\u0443\u0440\u0435\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0433\u0430\u043c\u0431\u0438\u0442 / the turkish gambit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtbyzkuwdxe ) ( without eng subs ) ,, 
   the meeting place can not be changed, 
  all the 5 episodes are on youtube and you can switch on english subtitles ( though the subs are n't perfect ) . 
  here 's [ the first episode ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdlm84gsrv4 ) . 
  what i wonder with this kind of people is how do they behave in real life . 
  it 's the kind if crazy that i occasionally see on the internet , but have never encountered in real life . 
  even among my acquaintances who have some ideas that are definitely out there , they are still much more grounded in reality . 
   does the estonian government provide language courses or support ? 
  that 's a bit of a problem from what i understand . 
  i 'm not from estonia , but one my mom 's cousins lives there , so this is the information i got from her . 
  my relative does speak very good estonian ( and she thinks it 's very important to lean the language ) , though not thanks to her school education . 
  and now they really struggle to teach her 10 year old son the language , she 's mostly frustrated with the fact that estonian is taught in an awful way in the ( russian lang ) schools . 
  she even says that it 's like the government does n't want them to learn the language , or surely they would have done something about the school program by now . 
  i do n't mean that she seriously thinks that it 's some kind of a giant conspiracy , it 's more exasperation at the way the language is currently taught . 
  estonia is a small country with a small population and you would think that integrating more than a quarter of its inhabitants that have a different first language would be extremely important for the country . 
   ethnic cleansings and expulsion of poles and germans, 
  i 'm a bit surprised that some people would not know about expulsions of germans and poles following wwii . 
  after the war the allied leaders agreed to the expulsions of ethnic germans from many territories in eastern and central europe , such as as poland , czechoslovakia , hungary , romania and the former eastern german territories . 
  just as the allied leaders agreed on the expulsion of poles from some territories that are now in western ukraine , belarus and lithuania . 
  but surely we can all agree that 's such things are tragic and not something we would like to repeat now . 
  just as we are n't going to move the poles back to lviv or germans back to gdansk for example . 
   i do n't miss those times . 
  while it is romanticized in russian literature i also understand the profuse inequality between classes back then . 
  agree , the staggering inequality was criminal . 
   however , i consider killing the royal family as one of the most horrific things in russian history . 
  really ? 
  can i ask you why ? 
  many people died during that time , why is the royal family somehow more valuable from a moral point of view than some poor peasant family , or any other family really ? 
  from my point of view , there were too many horrific events , many of them thanks to the royalty , happening in that time that overshadow the murder of one family . 
   i 've always been amazed by the presudo-nostalgic claptrap of the `` rossiya kotoruyu mi poteryali '' kind , that started coming out in the 90s . 
  pseudo , because it turns out to be very easy to convince people who grew up taking for granted privileges that the revolution generation fought and died for , and who dont know their own history , that pre-revolution russia was somehow gloriously wonderful . 
  thank you !, 
  i think you captured the attitude perfectly with this : its like a 3 year old going `` if i lived back then i would have been a princess and had a lot of pretty dresses '' . 
  somehow people are too happy to forget that this imperial fairytale they have in their mind was only available to a very small percentage of the population . 
   sorry is he not russian then ? 
  according to wiki his father was a tbilisi armenian and his mother russian . 
   and yes armenians are great , why do you want them deported ? 
  since he 's armenian himself i 'm guessing it 's for the benefit of armenia . 
  maybe they could use more people and there are more armenians living in the diaspora than in the country itself . 
  well , that was a bit sad to read . 
  i would never have thought there would be such a huge difference . 
  in the picture ? 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's a hobbit . 
  supposedly \u0432 \u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e-\u0424\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0435 , so in the [ ivano-frankivsk region ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ivano-frankivsk_oblast ) . 
   russia also has quite the history with the baltics as well . 
  we 've got a ` history ' with a lot of places , that does not make those places in any way equivalent to each other . 
  crimea not only has an ethnic russian majority , it has an even bigger majority of people who identify with russia . 
  moreover it has had the 90s where it was trying to get closer to russia , while kiev was having none of that and blocking everything they could . 
  this is a totally different situation from the baltics . 
  compare that with estonia for instance , where the russians are about a quarter of the population . 
  i do n't see what kind of a coup those couple of hundred thousands would be staging and why in the world would they do it . 
  besides that , i do n't see any practical reasons for the kremlin to start any ethnic-revolts in the baltics , i can see why having the crimea back is practical for security reasons , but what does starting revolts in the baltics do for us ? 
  again , i 'm talking practical benefits , so ` russia is doing it for the evilz ' is not a real reason . 
   i do n't think ` russia is doing it for the evilz ' is a valid reason either . 
  yeah , but `` putin would like to rebuild the soviet empire '' and `` how far can russia push nato and still get away with it '' basically translates into doing it for the evilz . 
  since if anything it would be detrimental to our security to get into a direct conflict with nato . 
  obviously if a conflict is already there like in south-ossetia & abhazia , transdnistria and well ukraine , russia will be supporting the pro-russian side , a no-brainer really . 
  but actually creating a volatile , dangerous situation on our borders in a place where there is no conflict now and let 's be honest no pressing ` interests ' of ours , just to fuck with the nato ? 
  i do n't see the benefits , if anything that would be a huge threat to our security . 
  kind of like with crimea really ( and ukraine is n't even in the nato ) , if they had n't overthrown yanukovich and just waited a year to vote him out , we would not be having this discussion . 
  ukraine would have swung in the pro-eu direction , kremlin would not be pleased at all , but would have to deal with it . 
   in other words , i 'm tired of typing on the subject right now, 
  hey , i get it . 
  i certainly know the feeling and obviously you 're under no obligation to continue the discussion . 
   maybe some soviet-era pun about having nothing to eat, 
  haha , no . 
  it 's a play on words , since ' \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c ' means both ` there is ' and ` to eat ' . 
  so the party says `` there is contact !, 
  '' , but it sounds the same as an order to eat a contact , since it can be read as `` eat a contact ! '' . 
  that what the joke is about , it 's clear from the context what is meant at first , namely `` there is contact '' , so for the joke 's sake we imagine this misunderstanding . 
  play on the double meaning of words is big in russian jokes . 
  that 's what basically every stirlitz joke is about . 
  and i 'm going totally off topic here , but here 's an example of a stirlitz joke '' \u0428\u0442\u0438\u0440\u043b\u0438\u0446 \u0441\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430\u0434 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0439 . 
  i thought that it was primary about the fact that ` there is contact !, 
  ` and ` eat a contact ! ', 
  sound the same , there would be no joke if they would n't . 
  attitude . 
  i did n't see it as a criticism of the food supply . 
  but i suppose it 's possible to tell this joke with different intentions . 
  i think some people would agree with your interpretation , and some would agree with mine . 
  for what it 's worth , i 've just asked another native ( not a great sample size ) and he agreed with me . 
  '' \u042f \u0446\u0435\u043b\u0443\u044e\u0441\u044c '' means something like `` i 'm making out '' . 
  i think it 's rarely used by itself , as usually it 's specified with whom you 're actually making out .
