  i think i saw the first episode , but it did n't really grab me , so i ca n't say much . 
  on a general note , i can never suspend my disbelief about foreign films that depict russia or russians . 
  it always feels fake and i ca n't get into it . 
  often enough it also gets pretty insulting , so not really enjoyable . 
  this is just a folk song about a young cossack who 's looking at a girl he likes . 
  also , it 's not about * two * cossacks and a girl , there 's no love triangle here . 
  i 'm curious why you would think there would be some racist/otherwise derogatory content in this song . 
  i think nearly all folk songs are about very typical stuff . 
  love , death and that sort of thing , they 're usually quite simple . 
  i might be wrong , but i do n't think we have such a company . 
  occasionally various adaptations are made ( of variable quality ) , but i do n't think there 's just one company that makes them . 
  from this year we have had a mini-series ' \u041a\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d ' ( kuprin ) that combined various works of aleksandr kuprin ( [ here 's the first episode ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gsvt7ol0xu ) ) and a mini-series based on ' \u0411\u0435\u0441\u044b ' ( demons ) by dostoyevsky ( [ here it is ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kikofc-zkdm ) ) . 
  i ca n't say if these are decent adaptations , as i have n't really watched them . 
  you can go if you want to . 
  you 'll need to get a russian visa and you can catch a plane to moscow and from there a plane to simferopol . 
  it 's not closed off for western tourists or anything , there just are n't many of them who would consider spending a vacation in crimea . 
   '' \u0414\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u0431\u044b\u043b \u0432 \u0431\u0438\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0435 '' typically means that someone 's currently is in the library , and been there for a long time . 
  that 's not the way i would interpret the phrase . 
  i do n't see how '' \u0434\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u0431\u044b\u043b '' implies an action that is still going on at the moment . 
  for a different example , if i want to say i 'm at my work right now and i 've been here for a long time , i wo n't be saying '' \u044f \u0434\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0435 '' , that would not be correct . 
  i disagree . 
  to me '' \u0431\u044b\u043b ( \u0430 ) '' indicates past tense and does n't work in the present tense . 
  for example , '' \u042f \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0434\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0435 , \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 ... '' means `` i was at work for a long time when ... '' and works just fine , but it means that something was happening the past and clearly not at this moment . 
  '' \u042f \u0434\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0435 , \u044f \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0443 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0439 '' sounds wrong to me , though the meaning is understood from context . 
  i think it works like that in english , `` i 've been at work for a long time '' means that i 'm currently at work and i 've been here for a long time , but in russian i would say something like '' \u044f \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0434\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0435 '' . 
   i guess we 'll have to agree to disagree for the moment . 
  oh sure . 
  and you 're right that there are different ways of saying things in russian , context is often key . 
  but i feel like we got sidetracked , the context we were discussing at first was the use of '' \u0434\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u0431\u044b\u043b ( \u0430 ) '' and how it translates . 
  you ca n't use '' \u042f \u0434\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0435 '' to mean that you 're still currently at work . 
  in the same way you just ca n't translate '' \u042f \u0434\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u0432 \u0431\u0438\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0435 '' to `` i 'm currently at the library '' , it means `` i was at the library a long time ago '' . 
  '' \u0414\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e '' + past tense means `` a long time ago '' , it means `` for a long time '' when used with the present tense . 
  i could n't care less about being the last bastion of morality , i care about much more practical things . 
  we do n't live in a fairy tale where there are shiny , morally spotless heroes and evil to the core villains , politics are much more nuanced and down to earth . 
  this sub has a variety of people , some are reasonable and some are either overly zealous morale crusaders coming to enlighten those barbaric russians , or overly zealous russian `` patriots '' who often prefer to support ` mother-russia ' from abroad . 
  i find both types somewhat annoying . 
  still , i see no reason why we have to hang our heads in shame whenever some enlightened individual decides to grace us with his presence and lecture us about our evil ways . 
  i happen to like my country , that does n't mean i think it 's perfect , far from it , i just do n't see things in black and white . 
  there are policies i agree with and policies i disagree with , sometimes i get frustrated with our government and sometimes i 'm pleasantly surprised , that 's life . 
  i 've spent a couple of years abroad ( in western europe ) and there are things i definitely like better over there and things i like better here in russia , no place is perfect . 
  i also do n't think i act all self important about a country that ceased to exist 23 years ago ( i hope not ) , i was a baby when su broke up , what i care about is the country we have now , the country i grew up in . 
  for me it 's not about past glories , it 's about what 's happening now . 
  and as much as i think we have a lot to improve in our country , i see no reason for ( excessive ) self-castigation , it wo n't get us anywhere . 
   i believe that the way some people conduct themselves here paints every russian as a brainwashed cretin . 
  surely you can see the contradiction when you say that the actions of ** some ** people paint ** every ** russian as a brainwashed cretin . 
  it 's reddit , i 've observed plenty of dumb and bigoted remarks made by americans , am i supposed to say that the actions of some of them paint every american as a brainwashed cretin ? 
  i 'm not sure you would be that happy to be called a brainwashed cretin for that reason . 
  this is about relatives and how they 're called . 
  for example , in the first example you should complete the sentence with ` aunt ' , since it says `` the sister of your mother is your ... '' . 
  it 's the nominative case . 
  i think it 's called a predicative expression when you want to say that something is equal to the subject of your sentence . 
  for example , ` olya is my aunt ' ( olya = aunt ) and both ` olya ' and ` aunt ' are placed in the nominative . 
  volgagrad was basically reduced to rubble in the war . 
  i 'm not sure how interesting it was before the war , but whatever they had was destroyed due to the heavy bombardment and fighting . 
  obviously that was not the case in st petersburg . 
  i 've never been to volgograd , but i think that nowadays those tourists who choose to visit the city do it specifically for the ww ii history and sights . 
  i 'm not an expert on prison culture , but no , i would n't say this has anything to do with prison specifically . 
  if anything i 'd think it 's somebody who 's profession is somehow connected to the sea , like a sailor for example ( though not necessarily ) . 
  as somebody else said it 's a play on words , `` sea cat '' means seal in russian , but instead here the term is ` interpreted ' literally . 
  it 's a joke and it 's pretty adorable really . 
  i think that \u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0435\u0445\u043e\u0434 is used here in a joking way to refer to the american dollar , which you can use anywhere in the world and not to a literal off-road car ( in russian an off-road car is called ' \u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0435\u0445\u043e\u0434 ' and a literal translation is something like ` he who goes everywhere ' ) . 
  are you familiar with stirlitz jokes ? 
  they often rely on a play of words , so you ca n't translate them literally . 
  [ stierlitz ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stierlitz ) is the lead character in a book series about a soviet spy working undercover in berlin during ww ii , it was adopted into a very popular tv-series [ ` seventeen moments of spring ' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seventeen_moments_of_spring ) . 
  he 's a very-well known character and has become one of the archetypes of russian anecdotes . 
  i 'll just copy the explanation from the wiki on russian jokes `` in the jokes , stierlitz interacts with various characters , most prominently his nemesis m\u00fcller . 
  usually two-liners spoofing the solemn style of the original voice-overs , the plot is resolved in grotesque plays on words or in parodies of the trains of thought and narrow escapes of the `` original '' stierlitz '' . 
  now i 'll try to translate the jokes . 
  the joke is that ' \u0415\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0438\u043c\u043e \u0440\u0432\u0430\u043b\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0443 ' can be translated in two ways , either ` he was uncontrollably * longing * for the motherland ' or ` he was uncontrollably * puking * all over the motherland ' . 
  the second one is more difficult for me to translate . 
  - slightly drunk stirliz and muller exit a bar , '' \u0414\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043c \u0434\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043a '' suggests stierliz . 
  now here 's the joke , ' \u0414\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043c \u0434\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043a ' is a colloquial way of saying `` let 's pull some girls/hire some prostitutes '' ( and this is what you expect it would mean in this situation ) but if interpreted literally it can also mean ` let 's take down the girls ' ( as if they 're literally hanging ) . 
  and then muller replies `` you 're a kind soul stirliz , but let 's let them hang till the morning '' . 
  - stirliz was walking through a forest and saw blue fir trees ( \u0433\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u044b\u0435 \u0435\u043b\u0438 ) . 
  when he was walking back the gays were already drinking . 
  ' \u0413\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u044b\u0435 \u0435\u043b\u0438 ' means ' ( light ) blue fir trees ' , but ' \u0433\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u044b\u0435 ' ( the color light blue ) can also mean gay people , so ' \u0433\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u044b\u0435 \u0435\u043b\u0438 ' can be translated as ` the gays were eating ' , though obviously that 's not the meaning you would first assume in this context . 
  - shtirliz walked cat ( another character from the series ) to her doorstep . 
  shtirliz looked up and saw the light in the window , the freak was indeed at home ( ** \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0434 ** \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0431\u044b\u043b ** \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430 ** ) . 
  the joke is in the difference between ' \u0443 \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430 ' and ' \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0434 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430 ' . 
  the first means ` near a maternity house ' and second one means ` the freak is at home ' . 
  - stirliz and muller were taking turns shooting ( from a pistol ) . 
  the queue was quickly diminishing . 
  this was quite hard to translate , but i hope i could explain the meaning . 
  i know that many circassians were forced to relocate to the ottoman empire after the caucasian war . 
  that was obviously very tragic for the people involved . 
  i 'll be honest , this is not a topic i 'm very knowledgeable about . 
  i live far away from the caucasus and i think that most people that i know do n't really have a particular opinion about the circassians , people probably just see them as caucasians . 
  i actually have some family members who live in nalchik , capital of the kabardino-balkar republic ( kabardians are also circassian ) , my family are ethnically slavic though . 
  i myself have only been there once in my childhood when we were visiting my great-grandfather , but my father has been there multiple times visiting family and i do n't think he ever had any particularly negative experiences . 
  personally , i would love to visit the region once again in the future . 
   i want to visit adigea one day . 
  do you think it is possible ? 
  sure , if you are a turkish citizen you can actually travel to russia without visa for 30 days as a tourist . 
  there are three republics where circassian is one of the official languages , but all three have a very mixed ethnic composition with different caucasian ethnicities as well as ethnic russians living there , so i have my doubts whether you could get by speaking solely adigean there . 
   do you think they would be able to understand my pathetic adigean ? 
  as i understand circassian has various dialects and of course languages tend to change over time , though i have no idea how much circassian has actually changed . 
  keep in mind that the language is now written in a form of cyrillic . 
  here are some news fragments , these should be decent examples of how the language is spoken now . 
  this is from [ kabardino-balkaria ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmxpoflyfc8&amp;index=80&amp;list=uuigemrmuxb3i_kgjjyobcbw ) . 
  this is from [ adygea ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imof5orybx0 ) .
