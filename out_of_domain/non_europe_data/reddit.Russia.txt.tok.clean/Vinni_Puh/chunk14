  any sort of historical claims mean nothing when the majority of people do n't identify with them . 
  most people in russia or eastern europe do n't identify with mongolia or kazakhstan , so this point is going nowhere . 
  it 's really not that hard , for example , the majority in gibraltar identify with britain , so it 's not going back to spain , no matter what the history is . 
  the majority of people in lviv identify with ukraine , so it 's not going back to poland , again , no matter what the history is . 
  if the majority of people living in russia now would identify as mongolian , would be connected with mongolia culturally and speak mongolian language , then who knows , perhaps one day some kind of ` greater mongolia ' could be established here . 
  that 's not the way history went though , so it 's not happening . 
  ukrainian, 
   i guessing that 's where you got your name ? 
  yes , as i really like both the cartoon and the actor who voiced winnie pooh . 
   have n't seen the others though , i 'll be sure to check them out !, 
  if you 'll like them , you should know that they have sequels . 
  you can find them all on youtube , though without subtitles . 
   would you say our generation in russia would support siding wit the west to combat the existing and arising challenges of the 3rd millenium ( terrorism , resource scarcity , further globalization , ... ) ? 
  i suppose i 'm also a part of the ` younger generation ' and my question is , what would ` siding wit the west ' exactly mean for us ? 
  i would certainly never be against a mutually beneficial relationship . 
  i do n't have anything against the west on principle , so if we could achieve some kind of cooperation , then great , i would n't complain . 
  but we live in a practical world , the west is looking out for itself and we should do the same . 
   i kinda like lukashenko - nazarbayev way, 
  lukashenko has belarus , a small ethnically homogeneous country with less than 10 mil inhabitants and an economy that is heavily supported by russia . 
  i just do n't think it 's comparable with russia and the challenges that we have as a country . 
  i 'm less familiar with kazakhstan , mostly through some russian repatriates from there that i know . 
  it 's probably the most successful country in central asia , sure , but from what i 've been told i 'm not sure that we have something to envy there . 
   sigh, 
  yeah , i kinda feel the same . 
  i 'm not an expert , but i wonder what benefits we 'll get from this that are n't already on the table . 
  and on a personal note , i 'm not crazy about the fact that we 're extending eeu to a country that is , at best , ambivalent towards us . 
  a good portion of armenia will probably see this as us forcing some kind of an imperialist expansion on you and , again , i do n't really see what 's in it for us . 
  yes , i fully agree . 
  in my case , i was born just before the collapse of su , so i also never actually got to experience life in the ussr and ca n't miss something i never had . 
  i also consider the ussr to be a better state than czarist russia and the criminal russia of the 90s . 
   why restore something that could n't keep itself from collapsing ? 
  i say create a new and better russia , learning from the failings of each previous regime . 
  yep , in my case i also just do n't feel that connected to most people living in the former ussr republics , so the idea of actually restoring the ussr seems strange to me . 
  i do n't see why we should live in one state with moldovans , tajiks , latvians , azerbaijanis , etc. 
  on the other hand , i think we should help those who actually like us and want to be with us . 
  so , i 'm happy enough with crimea , since most crimeans want to be a part of russia . 
  i would also hope that in the future we do n't abandon transnistrians , since those guys are as pro-russian as can be and have wanted to integrate with russia ever since the fall of the ussr . 
  besides what 's already been mentioned i like [ \u0411\u0438-2 ( bi-2 ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tb5w0rtrca&amp;list=plc2d1c5fc9a554f32 ) , [ \u0421\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0438 \u041e\u0440\u043a\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440 ( surganova and orchestra ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks6jq1l0e54&amp;list=pl8de277120b2d07bc ) , [ 5 ` nizza ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjm_l9fbu6g&amp;list=plcc9ea7f4f4a11cca ) , [ 7\u0411 ( 7b ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqb-m0dko-g&amp;list=pln_upwbkdxep7eudzv6y1etsmdflga3yt ) . 
   i 've just finished the first season of \u043d\u044e\u0445\u0430\u0447 and would love some more crime drama , 
  you could check out [ \u041c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0434 \u0424\u0440\u0435\u0439\u0434\u0430 / freud 's method ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hkbdre_zx4 ) ( with eng subtitles ) . 
  it has the same general idea i think . 
   i 'm deaf , and this is a rumor that 's been popping up lately . 
  i wanted to see if i could verify what i had heard . 
  i 'm curious , what was that rumor ? 
  czech republic is your homeland , right ? 
  what do the stripes represent ? 
  also , props for including transnistria , even if you do n't like them much , you 're one of the few people who did n't forget them . 
   i was told that in the soviet union disabled people were marginalized and essentially thrown away . 
  in some cases , executed . 
  it 's obviously not the same as being deaf , but my dad was born with a disability . 
  he was born with a certain genetic syndrome and one his symptoms is extremely poor eyesight . 
  anyway , he was born in mid sixties in the soviet union and i think that the biggest difference from most of his peers while growing up , was that for a big part of his school career he went to a specialized school . 
  i do n't think he was ever marginalized from society . 
  he finished school , got a degree at a university and his life turned out pretty all right i think , 
  you have to understand though , that for most people ( in russia ) what my father has , or being deaf are definitely nowhere near what 's considered the most serious kind of disabilities . 
  i think that having a disability where somebody is not mobile and ca n't take care of themselves is much worse and without a support network definitely not a pretty thing to go through in russia . 
  as in , the institutions responsible for helping such people definitely do n't get enough funding to provide care that is compatible with the care in western countries . 
  out of these 6 , i 've been to moscow , st pete , tver , and also to yaroslavl when i was a kid , but that memory is pretty faded . 
  moscow or st pete are the most accessible to foreigners . 
  chances of finding locals who can speak english are higher than in the rest of russia and there 's more entertainment and touristic stuff that you can do . 
  i would n't recommend tver or petrozavodsk . 
  tver is indeed pretty much a backwater , not interesting enough to spend a whole year there in my opinion . 
  i 'd think the same goes for petrozavodsk , but with a crappier climate . 
  if you do n't want to go to either moscow or st pete you could look into kazan as an option . 
  i have n't been there , but i 've heard some nice things about it . 
  it 's smaller than the other two , but it 's big enough to have plenty interesting stuff . 
  besides , it might be interesting to experience a mix of two cultures , the russian and the tatar one . 
  do n't really know what to say about yaroslavl , it has some very nice historical sights . 
  i definitely think it 's worth a visit , but i 'm not sure about spending a year there . 
   ... really ? 
  why not ? 
  russia has been recognizing the state of palestine since 1988 . 
  i do n't know all that much about our current relationship with palestine , but this does n't seem all that surprising . 
   however , i must clear something up . 
  the reason those people are in israel and not in russia is because they were basically forced out . 
  this is just anecdotal on my part , but my impression was that many left out of practical considerations . 
  granted , most people i know who repatriated to israel did it in the 90s and that was a crazy tough time . 
  so it was a logical decision to seek out a more stable and financially properous country . 
  for other people a strong sense of ethnicity is also a reason to repatriate , why not , if it 's important to them . 
  my grandfather is half-jewish ( via his mother ) , but since he and the rest of the family do n't feel connected to that part of the heritage , moving to israel was not something we considered . 
  but for many other people being ( partially ) jewish * is * very important and they want to live in a jewish country . 
   during the soviet union ( not sure if this is still the case ) your passport had a nationality category . 
  no , it 's not the case anymore . 
  our documents do n't have a nationality category . 
   under this category it said either russian or jew . 
  that 's just not true . 
  it did n't say * either russian or jew * , it said whatever ethnicity that person was supposed to be . 
  it could be russian , ukrainian , tatar , armenian , jewish , chuvash , or any other nationality . 
  from my understanding , in practice you 'd get whatever nationality your parents had and if they were from different nationalities , your parents would pick one or the other . 
   right , but from all those things , jewish is not exactly a nationality . 
  i 'm surprised you would say that . 
  i 'd say that most jewish people consider it to be a nationality , so i think that 's reason enough to see it that way .
