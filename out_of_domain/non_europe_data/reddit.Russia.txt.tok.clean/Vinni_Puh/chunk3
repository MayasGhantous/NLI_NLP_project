  i 'm not sure why you think russians want blood , the whole move with crimea is so wildly popular because it was done without bloodshed . 
  sure , crimea is back home , that 's great , but if that would have actually started a bloody conflict on the peninsula , i do n't think people would be happy . 
  you know , people are n't actually aspiring to be some kind of bloody invaders , if that 's what you think . 
   i do n't see how this is beneficial for russia, 
  i 'm curious , so what do you think russia should do in this case ? 
  nope , we 're not going to throw crimeans under the bus . 
  next option . 
  funny , recently in a different discussion you were lamenting the fact that the `` new generation of russians '' would be wanting blood , after i wrote that it 's not like people here have aspirations to become some kind of bloody invaders , you `` hoped '' that i was right . 
  after that i was surely not expecting this sudden bloodlust from you . 
  taking control `` crimea-style '' was only possible in crimea . 
  it was a unique region in that regard . 
  but the rest of ukraine is very much * not * crimea . 
  if russia intervenes in ukraine , there will be plenty of blood spilled . 
  never have i actually seen anything like this . 
  though i suppose if you have enough drunk people in a room , any kind of confrontation is possible . 
  i think more , you 'd have russian military fighting ukrainian military , sure we 'd win , but there would be dead bodies on both sides . 
  and let 's not forget a big , big factor , there will be plenty of partisans , or some kind of paramilitary troops of enthusiastic patriots . 
  there are many people ( especially in central and western ukraine ) who will naturally absolutely hate any kind of moskal occupation , and they will be in their right to do so . 
  oh , i 'm sure you have , i believe you . 
  but you wrote : `` if you are in a bar situation ** expect ** a group of russian men to interrupt you '' . 
  i 've seen this kind of situation ( foreigners in a bar ) often enough and somehow there were no interruptions by angry russian men . 
  i 'm sure it happens , but based on my experience i just ca n't believe it 's such a normal occurrence . 
  or maybe i 'm just abnormally lucky in this regard . 
  well , i see no point in arguing over this . 
  i just shared my experience ( i 'm a russian woman btw ) , as it just happens to be completely different from yours . 
  as a foreigner i 'm sure it 's always better to be careful . 
  the quote you posted is very famous , kipling in general is very well known in russia . 
  it 's used when talking about the supposedly fundamental differences between east and west . 
  i do n't know , i really would n't say that buying coffee beans/ground coffee is a challenge here in russia . 
  in my family we 're not that particularly fond of coffee , but since my childhood i remember we always had a coffee grinder at home and buying fresh beans when we wanted to was not a problem . 
  also , plenty of people have coffee makers at home . 
  they 're really only as expensive as you want them to be , sure you can buy one for $ 100 or more , but you can buy a more simple one for something like $ 15-25 . 
  sure , we 're definitely more of tea drinking nation , still i would n't really say they are that rare in russian homes . 
  i 'm not really that fond of coffee , but even i have a coffee maker at home . 
  mine was also quite cheap , it 's definitely possible to buy one for far less than $ 100 . 
  it definitely reads like the author has left russia years ago and is writing it like `` you know , my grandma prefers to grind her own meat and does n't drink coffee , well , that must mean there 's no ground meat and coffee makers in russia '' . 
  ah , now i 've noticed that they did leave russia 11 years ago .

  i 've used google translate and it was pretty decent in some parts and very strange in other . 
  so , i 've tried cleaning up the translation , but eh : /, 
  i remember our last night , our last conversation, 
  my last glance slips over your body, 
  your underwear on the floor - you 're absolutely naked, 
  you 're clinging to me - you 're mine for the last time, 
  your shoulders are warm as the wax of hot candles, 
  my lips are covering them with kisses, 
  i dissolve like ice in the sadness in your eyes, 
  and you kiss me for the last time, 
  [ chorus ], 
  last time you 're with me ,, 
  last time i 'm yours ,, 
  last time the tears from the eyes, 
  last time ... 
  sparkles of white hair on the bed of love, 
  spread out like the waves of an impossible dream, 
  in them are all our sorrows , all our joy and pain, 
  and in the quiet whisper of love i distinguish `` wait a minute ... '', 
  you quietly asking me not to leave you alone, 
  but deep in my eyes you see only emptiness, 
  your eyelashes trembling , you quietly pray for us, 
  but i know one thing , it 's all for the last time, 
  [ chorus ], 
  you try to forget about what lies ahead, 
  and you throw all of yourself in the fire of last love, 
  burning up like paper in my gentle hands, 
  beacuse it 's all for the last time and you forget your own fear, 
  just me and you , only the two of us, 
  and then i 'm gone , and only the rain outside, 
  will remind you that i will not come back, 
  but you wo n't be alone , your sadness will come to you, 
  the sadness will tell you that once i will come, 
  and wipe your tears with my hand, 
  you 'll learn about where i was and where i was n't, 
  and i 'll tell you simply : `` i did not forget you . '', 
  all will disappear , dissolve , all will melt to ashes, 
  smiling i 'll see that you 've been waiting for me, 
  in the meantime , i see tears , i hear the whisper of your phrases, 
  i 'm not leaving for always , i 'm leaving for the last time ... 
  [ chorus ], 
  you 're welcome !, 
  i of course do n't know what kind of music you 'll like , but i 'll give you some artists i occasionally listen to .

  you 're welcome of course . 
  hopefully you 'll find some of it interesting , though i wonder how enjoyable it will be if you do n't understand the text . 
  some of those songs probably greatly depend on the text for their charm . 
  i certainly would n't want to discourage you , but you have to understand that some of those texts are quite peculiar , even in russian . 
  i suppose certain things are quite poetic in russian , but if translated literally they are going to sound very strange , the imagery that native speakers get from the original will be lost in translation . 
  i really would n't start by translating zemfira or mumiy troll . 
  i also have to say that before you attempt any translation , you have to at the very least cover the basics of russian grammar . 
  so , for example , before you start translating it 's very important to understand how cases work .
