  in general though , my family has n't been affected by crimea one way or the other , i also ca n't really think of anybody i know who has somehow suffered because of this . 
  this lady though , if we are to believe the article , already had a very shitty life if she had to live on 9k per month . 
  with such a salary , she was screwed no matter what happened with crimea . 
  is that really what therapists make working full-time ? 
  it 's a folk song about a young cossack . 
  he is n't having fun with the rest of the cossacks , instead he 's looking at a girl he likes . 
  he wants this girl named tatiana to be his beloved . 
  interesting . 
  if i may ask , can you give some examples of popular contemporary polish music ? 
  it 's a bit strange to consider that our languages sound the same to non-slavic foreigners . 
  i 'm russian and to me polish sound so very different . 
  i definitely feel like it 's a joke i 'm just not getting :(, 
  i feel that you 're really projecting with the `` white gold '' issue , that name just has no racist connotations in russia . 
  i 'm guessing you 're thinking about something like `` white power '' , but that just does not translate to russian . 
  the same with `` ensemble of national songs '' really , i 'm pretty sure every country has these sorts of ensembles , what it means is that they sing traditional local folk music , nothing else really . 
  the idea of traditional ethnic culture being racist is just mind-boggling to me . 
  there are different ethnicities in russia that have their own ensembles that focus on their own traditional songs or dances . 
  i would find it extremely weird if somebody accused ensembles that sing traditional tatar songs or dance traditional caucasian dances to be nationalistic , i just do n't get this world view at all . 
  well , i always knew that our medical professionals are exceptional people , but apparently the ones on tanganrog deserve to be sainted . 
  i literally ca n't imagine getting by on 6k per month , it would basically be charitable work . 
  i checked the offers for therapists in my city ( tomsk ) and the salaries offered range from [ 20 to 50k ] ( http://rabota.yandex.ru/search.xml/?text=\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043f\u0435\u0432\u0442+\u0422\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f+\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c&amp;rid=&amp;job_industry=134&amp;ncrnd=9612 ) . 
  so why the discrepancy ? 
  even a place like [ novocherkassk ] ( http://rabota.yandex.ru/search.xml/?text=%d1%82%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%bf%d0%b5%d0%b2%d1%82+%d0%9d%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%be%d1%87%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%ba%d0%b0%d1%81%d1%81%d0%ba&amp;rid=&amp;job_industry=134&amp;ncrnd=9612 ) , that 's in the same region , but is a smaller town than taganrog , and even there you 've got an offer for \u0412\u0440\u0430\u0447-\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043f\u0435\u0432\u0442 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 of 20-24k . 
  ah , i think i get what i overlooked , some places only give the basis of your salary and others already mention ' \u0434\u043e\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044b ' that will be added to that . 
  i was really surprised at the salaries offered in taganrog myself . 
  i 've compared it with my city ( siberia , tomsk ) , where the salaries offered for therapists ranged from [ 20k to 50k ] ( http://rabota.yandex.ru/search.xml/?text=\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043f\u0435\u0432\u0442+\u0422\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f+\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c&amp;rid=&amp;job_industry=134&amp;ncrnd=9612 ) . 
  and even if we keep it in the same region and look at a town that 's smaller than taganrog , i 've checked [ novocherkassk ] ( http://rabota.yandex.ru/search.xml/?text=%d1%82%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%bf%d0%b5%d0%b2%d1%82+%d0%9d%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%be%d1%87%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%ba%d0%b0%d1%81%d1%81%d0%ba&amp;rid=&amp;job_industry=134&amp;ncrnd=9612 ) and even there you 've got an offer for \u0412\u0440\u0430\u0447-\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043f\u0435\u0432\u0442 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 of 20-24k . 
  i do n't really get it . 
  ah , now i actually do . 
  i was n't taking into account that some places just give the `` raw '' salary and others , i think , already mention \u0434\u043e\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044b that you 'll get , so that the numbers are closer to what you actually get . 
  so , the information from taganrog is actually a bit misleading . 
  still , our medical professionals do n't get paid enough on average , that 's true enough . 
  ah , yes , i 've been asked if i was polish a couple of times as well , 
   any specific genre ? 
  i recently came across [ dziwny jest ten \u015bwiat ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtjlzwpmufw ) by czes\u0142aw niemen , i really liked it and it made me curious about polish music in general . 
  i think i would be interested in basically anything , but can you recommend some rock music ? 
  and what are the most famous folk songs ? 
  i 'd think mostly the well-know stereotypes : polite people with a sense of humour that drink a lot of tea and live in a rainy country . 
  i do n't know , ca n't think of much else . 
  i would also say that english literature is quite popular in russia , growing up i 've read plenty of english stuff . 
  after actually visiting england i can say that you guys are heavier drinkers than i expected . 
  oh , and that you kind of feel you 're distant and almost superior ( ? ), 
  to the rest of europe . 
  do n't have the information for you , but you should n't forget latin and greek . 
  i think pretty much all the words you 've borrowed from them , we also have in russian . 
  i do n't hate them , why should i ? 
  in fact , i 've visited estonia and latvia a couple of times , never had troubles there , so i do n't see why i should really care one way or the other . 
  the only thing i found surprising , is how so many baltic redditors are convinced that russia is going to try to occupy your countries . 
  honestly a laughable idea , as i see absolutely no reason we would actually want to do that . 
  i do n't know how to really put it in perspective , even if to the baltic states we 're this big , threatening neighbor that you can scare your kids with , you 're not really * that * relevant to most russians . 
  so , coming to reddit and seeing these intense feelings some of your people still have for russia , it 's kind of surprising and amusing at the same time . 
  i 'm not mad that the baltics have chosen eu/nato , i do n't see a particular reason why we should be in the same alliances , so you should definitely do whatever you think is best for your countries . 
  but even after choosing a different block , it would n't hurt you politically to at least pretend to be moderately neutral . 
  i mean , precisely because you 're small countries ( that 's not negative , it 's just a fact ) it would be wise to try and play both sides a bit . 
  so , the fact that your politicians always jump on the nearest anti-russian bandwagon , when you ca n't really do any serious damage , is also a bit amusing . 
  well , i think that to our government all of our neighbors are relevant to a certain degree , it 's part of the job description . 
  but that 's why i said that it would be wise for your politicians to exercise restraint when dealing with russia , no matter what your personal feelings are , it would certainly be better for business to tone down the anti-russian rhetoric . 
  like , only last october your foreign minister basically threatened to cut the supply of goods to kaliningrad : `` as you know , the kaliningrad region is isolated , geographically isolated , so we could apply some measures also to cut something , '' the reuters news agency quoted linas linkevicius as saying on wednesday . 
  `` transport , we could cut off trains , but not only trains , also the supply of goods , whatever . 
  it is theoretically possible , '' the official added . '', 
  ( http://rt.com/politics/lithuania-threats-kaliningrad-road-638/ ), 
  so , what is this kind of shit good for ? 
  with this sort of rhetoric coming from your government , our government ca n't exactly forget you exist . 
  show a bit of political restraint and it would go a long way . 
   by the way , the current ruling party ( social democrats , ex-communists ) is considered to be quite pro-russian . 
  haha , well , if that 's an example of a pro-russian government , i think that says a lot really . 
  i 'm curious , what exactly makes them pro-russian , in comparison with the previous governments ? 
   but to be honest , russia had similar threats to lithuania lots of times . 
  and they actually closed a border for lithuanian goods imports quite a few times . 
  oh sure , our health officials occasionally ban imports based on political motivations i 'm sure . 
  i think they figured that money should do the talking . 
  exerting economic pressure on your political opponents is just a part of the political game . 
  if you feel that you 're playing on an even field with russia , you 're welcome to join the game . 
  still , there 's a difference between banning goods from a particular country and threatening to put a blockade on a region of another country . 
  the appropriate response would probably be to close your own borders for our goods , if you 're so inclined , no to threaten * our * borders . 
  so , do n't be surprised if our government, 
  does n't like it . 
  i also had to think quite hard to come up with an example of american bad guys in our movies . 
  there was an 8-part tv series in 2011 about espionage , double agents and that sort of thing ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1687471/ ) . 
  it 's been awhile , but i think there was a plot about working against american intelligence at some point . 
  it 's on youtube if you speak russian ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyqeungix7s ) . 
  i think this comment is at the top , because for most russians the baltic states are a complete non-issue most of the time . 
  no , we do n't want to annex you or really think about you that much . 
  but occasionally we 're reminded by your politicians or here on reddit that you 're still quite anti-russian . 
  you do n't have to like us or anything like that , but some neutrality could go a long way . 
  i had a small discussion with the op in this thread and it turns out that the current government in lithuania is considered to be pro-russian . 
  apparently , a `` pro-russian '' government can come up with statements threatening to block a russian region like this : `` as you know , the kaliningrad region is isolated , geographically isolated , so we could apply some measures also to cut something , '' the reuters news agency quoted linas linkevicius as saying on wednesday . 
  `` transport , we could cut off trains , but not only trains , also the supply of goods , whatever . 
  it is theoretically possible , '' the official added . '', 
  and this was last october btw . 
   we 're both slavs !, 
  to be fair , that does n't really mean much in our world . 
  i think that any kind of pan-slavic ideas are a bit of a self-delusion really . 
  how much do we actually have in common with western or south-slavic people ? 
  not that much . 
  that does not negate the laws of basic decency though , i think we as people should of course be cordial with each other . 
  you assume that imperialism is based on some kind of hate or any other strong feelings besides a quest for power . 
  it was all quite pragmatic really . 
  the reason you were occupied by the russian empire and then by the ussr is not because there were some special feelings for the baltic people , but because of your geographical position . 
  small nations were often occupied by large nations in the past , were n't you also occupied by sweden before us ?
