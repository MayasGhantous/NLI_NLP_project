   probably a tatar then . 
  what a wild suggestion . 
  why would it be a tatar ? 
   or chechen . 
  yeah , the mastermind behind the attack is a chechen . 
  he has been on the wanted list in russia for years on charges of terrorism , fled to europe and received refugee status in austria . 
  russia has tried to extradite him in the past , but was blocked by the european court for human rights . 
  but tatars are chill and secular . 
  oh yes , no arguing with that of course . 
  i guess `` tatar terrorists '' just sounds strange to a russian so i was a bit offended on their behalf . 
   if a man has come to bosnia even for the census then he hasnt lived continuously abroad, 
  strange logic , if i go on vacation to a foreign country i no longer continuously live in my country of residence ? 
  sure , i agree with you . 
  obviously the same rules should be applied to all the groups involved . 
  i was merely surprised by your statement that if you travel to bosnia for the census that somehow cancels out the fact that you permanently live abroad . 
   no mention of the russian woman in germany who claimed to be raped , but her story did n't make sense . 
  i forget the details , but i think nobody could even verify she was in germany . 
  you mean the 13 year old girl who in fact * lives * in germany ? 
   back people, 
  this looks like a very obvious typo . 
  what 's your problem ? 
   this is the ethnic cleansing of the circassians, 
  buut , what does this have to do with dagestan ? 
   one search of the term you just quoted would have answered that . 
  if anything , it 's the opposite . 
  [ as you can see circassians are not and were not originally from dagestan . ], 
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/circassia#/media/file:resettlement_of_circassians_into_ottoman_empire.jpg ) so the question `` what does this have to do with dagestan '' still stands . 
  dagestani language does not exist , there is a bunch of different ethnicities there that all have their own languages . 
  dagestan has 14 official languages and apparently over 30 local languages that are commonly spoken . 
  it 's a very mixed region . 
  still , it does seem strange that only azerbaijani , armenian and georgian are official languages . 
  no way would the rest put up with that . 
  but would n't you be outnumbered by the russians in your own country ? 
  does n't seem nice for the finns . 
  though it 's not totally clear which way st petersburg would go . 
  in 2012 apparently the majority of muslims in tatarstan and bashkortostan did not identify as either sunni or shia . 
  bashkortostan : 38 % identified as muslim but not sunni or shia and 1.7 % identified as sunni muslim . 
  tatarstan : 31 % identified as muslim but not sunni or shia and 1 % identified as sunni muslim . 
   in terms of populatin , all of the caucasian republics still on par with moscow alone . 
  moscow has over 12 million people . 
  all of the caucasian republics together have less than 7 million . 
  russian born population in ukraine , belarus and the baltic states is there from the soviet times , back when it was all one country . 
  this has nothing to do with putin . 
   if they gave a shit at all about their living standards and future , they 'd be trying to join the west by liberalizing and democratizing , but they 're not . 
  that 's what people associate the 90s with , trying to join the west . 
  living standards plummeted like a rock in those times . 
   all of the big relevant cities are in europe for the most part . 
  most of them . 
  though the 3rd and 4th largest cities in russia are on the asian side . 
  i 'm pretty out of the loop as far as moldovan politics are concerned . 
  who are you talking about ? 
  i imagine he 'd be a lot like zhirinovsky in his rhetoric . 
  so no , he would n't . 
  he has this overblown populist political persona . 
  chuvash is supposed to be even less understandable to speakers of other turkic languages . 
   translation from the `` the caucasian tales '' ( 1837 ) of the great russian poet a.s.pushkin, 
  care to line the original ? 
  because i ca n't find anything about `` caucasian tales '' by pushkin from 1837 ( he also died fairly early in 1837 ) . 
  that poll had 41 % russian orthodox and 6.5 % muslim ( as well as 4.1 % unaffiliated christian , 1.5 % other orthodox , 1.2 % pagan and 0.5 % buddhist ) . 
  but the kurds have also been colonised and oppressed . 
  that 's the reason they do n't have their own country ... 
   cultures are quite close . 
  this is very debatable . 
  at the very least , i think it 's safe to say that in general we perceive our cultures to be quite different from each other . 
   whether you have much in common with such one , or not - or think being of any of these options - it does n't prevent you ( if you are from russia ) to not only be `` allied '' and \\ or `` trading '' with them , but literally living in one country . 
  there are about half a million lezgins in russia . 
  while there are roughly 80 million iranians and 80 million turks respectively . 
  if russia had 80 million lezgins living here we 'd be a very different country . 
  yes , of course . 
  but we 've lived together for so long that as a result our cultures have been brought much closer to each other . 
  at least speaking about the biggest groups , nowadays tatars , bashkirs , chuvash are not the same as turkish people . 
  i think that was mainly by the poles . 
  does n't mean that 's how they called themselves , or were even necessarily called by others ( for example in a peace treaty of 1494 the lithuanian prince alexander accepted [ ivan iii 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ivan_iii_of_russia ) title as the ` sovereign of all rus ' ) . 
  the title ` grand duke of all rus ' ( velikiy knyaz vseya rusi ) was used by rulers for a couple of centuries . 
  for example you can see the seal of simeon the proud from 1340s that had the inscription [ `` the seal of the grand duke simeon of all rus '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grand_duchy_of_moscow#/media/file:%d0%9f%d0%b5%d1%87%d0%b0%d1%82%d1%8c-%d0%a1%d0%b8%d0%bc%d0%b5%d0%be%d0%bd%d0%b0-%d0%93%d0%be%d1%80%d0%b4%d0%be%d0%b3%d0%be.jpg ) . 
  the seal of aforementioned ivan iii from 1490 's had the inscription [ `` ioan , by god 's grace , the sovereign of all rus ' and the grand duke '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grand_duchy_of_moscow#/media/file:seal_of_ivan_3.png ) . 
  later you also had ivan iv who crowned himself the `` tsar and grand duke of all rus '' in 1547 marking the beginning of the tsardom of russia . 
  what does stalin have to do with this ? 
  russia expanded waay before stalin or soviet union for that matter were in the picture . 
  but it * is * a win for russia . 
  after all she 's a russian citizen who has lived and trained in russia since she was a small child . 
  why would n't she represent russia ? 
  but the original comment was about russia being `` splotched all over like a painting '' ( which is the opposite of total russification ) . 
  then this somehow got tied to stalin despite the fact that russia expanded into those lands centuries before that . 
  um , but what does that have to do with russia being linguistically diverse ? 
  russia is `` splotched all over like a painting '' ( as the original comment puts it ) because there are various unrelated ethnic groups living there . 
  this has nothing to do with stalin . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/russia_ethnic.jpg ) a map from before the first world war ( so before stalin as well ) . 
  you 'll notice how languages are splotched over . 
  and ? 
  she grew up in russia and she seems happy to represent her country . 
   none of them is a slav actually . 
  that 's the joke . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.karaoke.ru/song/9169.htm ) is the text in russian . 
  that 's not really true . 
  russians rarely , if ever , remember about slovaks . 
  yes , the tendency to just quickly forget and forgive is frustrating . 
  like , ffs people , how about having some self-respect !, 
  catholic priests ca n't . 
   it 's higher than in germany , for instance ( 1.6 vs 1.44 ),
