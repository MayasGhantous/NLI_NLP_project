  fertility rate in russia was 1.78 in 2015 and not 1.6 . 
  snegurochka is supposed to be his granddaughter . 
  lol , what is this delusion ? 
   nah , he would get * narrower * slice if he actually asked this on russian site . 
  i 'm also russian , but i do n't really agree . 
  you 're saying that the gap between ethnic russian regions and the caucasus is smaller than between moscow and the rest of the country ? 
  that 's not true at all in my experience . 
  i 'm not from moscow btw . 
  not sure why you 're being downvoted . 
  and that while there 'd be more russians living in this union than estonians or latvians ( lol ) . 
   the czech republic and slovakia do n't have that much in common in the first place . 
  do n't they basically speak the same language ? 
  i always thought that both nations shared the same origins . 
   all call them nemtsy - not local , ne mestnye, 
  lol , no . 
  where are you getting this from ? 
  [ nemets ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/names_of_germany#names_from_nemets ) comes from the word `` mute '' . 
  it was used for foreigners , people who could n't speak the local language . 
   historically inhabited by turks, 
  being turkic is not the same as being a turk ... 
  i guess in the past , nowadays there are in fact separate identities in existence . 
  yakuts are turkic for example , but you would make most of them laugh if you told them they 're literally the same people as turks . 
  oh you know , the fact that when a group separates for long enough the various parts develop their own identities . 
  yakuts and turks have been developing separately for quite a long time now . 
   putin sets up a base in crimea, 
  putin did not set up a base in crimea , it was there long before him . 
   we will ** the next day ** . 
  lol no , you know you wo n't . 
  it 's silly to pretend otherwise . 
  i think the status quo suits us just fine and our government knows that . 
  nothing 's going to change about the status of south ossetia and abkhazia . 
   russia is irrelevant and has zero influence on the world stage . 
  saudis are much more influential . 
  are you just shilling or * really * this delusional ? 
  our migration for the most part consists of migrant workers who come and go ( and some russians who are still repatriating from the former soviet union ) . 
  in 2015 russia had ~ 353,000 migrants going out , with ~ 300,000 going to other cis countries . 
  that would be uzbek , tajik and so on workers going home . 
  at the same time ~ 599,000 migrants came to russia , with a bit under 540,000 coming from other cis countries . 
  the net growth in 2015 being 245,384 migrants . 
   that 's 3m outright takfiris straight away, 
  there are many muslims in russia , particularly tatars and bashkirs , who identify as simply muslim and not sunni or shia . 
  for example , in 2012 there was a big poll on religion in russia where 31 % of the respondents in tatarstan identified as `` muslim , but not sunni or shia '' and 1 % identified as `` sunni muslim '' . 
  plus not all ethnic muslims in russia actually follow islam . 
   i do not wish to serve in any army , especially not in syria , with ww3 being around the corner . 
  are you trolling ? 
  why the fuck would anybody send you to syria ? 
  this is not how any of this works . 
   2015 data is n't unavailable on the official rosstat site . 
  ( not saying that it does n't exist , but i just ca n't find it . ), 
  the 2015 is available : http://www.gks.ru/bgd/regl/b16_107/main.htm . 
  you 'll see the break down by different countries where migrants are going to and coming from . 
  353,233 migrants left russia in 2015 , most of them going to other cis countries of course . 
  598,617 migrants came to russia in 2015 , most of them likewise being from other cis countries . 
   it 's also russia 's only base away from russia, 
  technically there are a couple of bases in some of the former soviet states , like armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , tajikistan and kyrgyzstan . 
  was n't erdogan supposedly part georgian ? 
  yeah , i looked it up and this is what wiki has to say :, 
   erdo\u011fan allegedly said in 2003 , `` i 'm a georgian , my family is a georgian family which migrated from batumi to rize . '', 
  however , in a 2014 televised interview on the ntv news network , he said , `` you would n't believe the things they have said about me . 
  they have said i am georgian ... even with much uglier things , they have called me armenian , but i am turkish . 
  why did you remove the post ? 
  this was a good one . 
  i meant this whole thread actually , `` some of pres. 
  erdo\u011fan 's comments are being lost in translation ... '' . 
  it now says [ removed ] when i open it . 
  according to the primary chronicles the tribes that invited varyags to novgorod were the chud ' , slovene , krivichi and ves ' . 
  a mix of slavic and finnic tribes who lived there . 
   russia 's birth rate is 1.3, 
  you meant to say ` fertility rate ' and you 've got some old data . 
  fertility rate in russia was 1.78 in 2015 and 1.81 after the first half of 2016 . 
  the birth rates are actually pretty decent right now . 
  last year they were the third highest in europe after turkey and ireland . 
  yes , all european states ( besides turkey ? ), 
  are at below replacement fertility levels . 
  that 's what demographic transition does to a country . 
  what ( western ) europe and russia have going for them is an immigration surplus . 
  most people migrating out of russia are going to other [ cis countries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commonwealth_of_independent_states ) . 
  uzbek/tajik/kyrgyz / whatever guest workers returning home can in no way , shape or form be seen as `` russian brain drain to the west '' . 
  it 's cheap propaganda to suggest otherwise . 
  in 2015 russia had ~ 353,000 migrants going out , with ~ 300,000 going to other cis countries . 
  that would be uzbek , tajik and so on workers going home . 
  at the same time ~ 599,000 migrants came to russia , with a bit under 540,000 coming from other cis countries . 
  the net growth in 2015 being 245,384 migrants . 
  the way it works is that a russian citizen can get second citizenship without renouncing the russian one . 
  but if a foreigner is trying to become a russian citizen he 's required to give up his original citizenship . 
  this makes me think of [ '' \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0446\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0432 '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucexc-emeni9lvu5jbtqlekw ) . 
  all the reasonable , ordinary people do n't hate lavrov , unless your definition of `` reasonable , ordinary people '' is extremely narrow . 
  he gets fairly high approval ratings actually . 
  but you 're right that most people do n't necessarily associate lavrov with armenians . 
  and since rt was never a product aimed primarily at the russian audience , simonyan is n't really all that well known among the general audience . 
  personally i do n't care if the majority of moldovans decide they want to reunite with romania as long as they also let transnistria exercise the right to self-determination . 
  also , i wonder what would happen to gagauzia in this case . 
  do n't they have some kind of constitutional safeguards to prevent themselves from being absorbed into romania ? 
  again , he 's fairly well-respected among the * general * public . 
  whatever your opinion of the man is , it 's not shared by the majority of ordinary russians . 
  not that it changes the way russians see armenians one way or the other . 
  this is an argument that leads nowhere basically and is not really relevant to the question of prominent figures of armenian descent who are respected by the people in russia . 
  just because you think that people in russia are brainwashed sheep , which i found is just a tactic westerners use to dismiss dissenting opinion , it does n't change the fact that lavrov is a well-respected public figure . 
   we need more transparency on this sub, 
  what do you mean ?
