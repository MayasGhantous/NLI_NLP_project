  for some reason zabaykalsky krai is pink when it 's around 90 % ethnic russian . 
  and there 's a small ` island ' of different colour inside of it , the agin-buryat autonomous okrug , which seized to exist in 2008 . 
  lol , he 's from mongolia . 
  but [ here 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwuqlkauqdi ) a tatar rapper from russia for example . 
  that 's also a plurality . 
  about 55 % of the population in tatarstan belongs to ethnic groups that have * traditionally * been muslim , like tatars and bashkirs . 
  not all of them identify as muslim nowadays , some of them are also atheists or agnostics for example . 
  the most comprehensive poll i 've seen on the matter had 31 % in tatarstan identify as ` muslim , but not sunni or shia ' and another 1 % identify as ` sunni muslim ' . 
   ah , well russian ethnics are the majority of ... citizens i think , something like 60 %, 
  80 % of russian citizens are ethnic russians . 
   ` we 're the majority , why should n't we ( for example ) teach orthodox christianity in schools ', 
  i think you have some misconceptions on the topic . 
  schools do n't just teach orthodox christianity to all children . 
  it 's up to the parents who get to choose between various religious and secular courses their kids can attend . 
  you can choose between the basics of orthodox christianity , basics of islam , buddhism or judaism as well as secular ethics and basics of world religions . 
  so , there is in fact nothing wrong with teaching orthodox christianity in schools . 
  atheists and people of different faiths also get their own courses . 
  i think it depends on how pushy you are . 
  if you 're the only parent in the class who wants your kid to learn the basics of islam or buddhism or whatever , they 're not going to be happy about that . 
  so it depends on whether you 're going to stand your ground or not . 
  i 've read about cases where you had a child be the only one in the whole school who 's learning about buddhism for example . 
  but most people just go with the flow . 
   some of your allies are our enemies, 
  now i 'm curious who those are ? 
  as long as there are enough post-soviet republics that are doing worse than russia there is n't really a particular reason for migration to dry up . 
  ukraine , central asia , moldova , transcaucasia will continue to supply a migration surplus in the foreseeable future just like they 're doing now . 
  and of course it 's not just ethnic russians migrating to russia , that 's not how it works . 
  migration surplus was about 245,000 in 2015 . 
  have n't seen the final numbers for 2016 yet , in the first 9 months migration surplus increased with about 16 % in comparison with the previous year .

   but also have been led to believe that some people are paid to `` troll '' this subreddit . 
  lol , that would be a stupid waste of money . 
  this seems like a made-up problem . 
  somehow tourists manage to visit other regular orthodox churches just fine , but it 's going be a problem here ? 
   anyone can become a russian, 
  realistically , one has to be raised in the russian culture to ` become ' russian . 
  people are n't going to consider you russian in most cases unless you speak the language on a native level . 
  extremely difficult to achieve that if you 're starting out as an adult . 
  uh , plenty other people speak russian . 
  if x speaks with an accent , people in russia will not assume x is russian . 
   by putting trump in office, 
  you guys voted for him , so it 's you who put trump in office . 
  do n't try to dodge responsibility here , 
  what , russians are responsible for the electoral college now ? 
  it 's all on you guys , all on you . 
  again , let me spell it out for you . 
  your people voted for him , he 's your responsibility . 
  your wacky electoral system is also your own responsibility . 
  it was n't invented by the russians . 
  stop acting like a small child about it . 
  yes , of course . 
  i just find the statement that anyone can become a russian to be somewhat eye-rolling , since we 're not talking about purely formal stuff like getting the russian citizenship here . 
  but being from a different culture does n't preclude you from living in russia or enjoying russian culture , and it does n't stop you from fitting in . 
  i do n't really think they would , i 'm russian btw . 
  one does n't need to `` drop russian habits '' in order not to be a tracksuit wearing/vodka drinking/squatting stereotype of a gopnik . 
  just like one does n't need to drop british habits in order not to be a chav . 
   how many kia have the russians suffered so far ? 
  do we know the circumstances surrounding their deaths ? 
  [ this ] (, 
  http://www.rbc.ru/politics/05/12/2016/58457c589a79473fa152c4a2 ) is a russian article from 7 december 2016 . 
  there 's officially released info about 23 deaths , including a suicide and the two killed nurses ( i 'm not sure if they count as kia ? 
  ) , with some short statements on how they died . 
   are there any polls about russian domestic opinion on russias involvement in syria , and their feelings towards the ypg and sdf ? 
  have n't seen anything about ypg and sdf . 
  but here 's an opinion poll on russia 's involvement in syria from october 2016 : http://wciom.ru/index.php?id=236&amp;uid=115909 . 
  ask away if you need something translated from russian . 
  i think it 's just a google translate fail . 
  no , not really . 
  it 's just the a tired western stereotype * haha , russians are always miserable , haha * . 
  that sort of thing . 
  sure , that 's based on another tired western stereotype . 
  you know , the usual * russian history is uniquely horrible ... and that 's why they 're so miserable * . 
  the quote you gave also fits . 
   they 'd be more than willing to give up territorial claims in ukraine for greater recognition and respect in the world, 
  give up crimea ? 
  that 's not happening . 
  not after russia went all in there . 
  had they intended to play coy about it , they would have not officially recognised crimea as a part of russia ( and even then giving it up would have been tricky ) . 
  separating crimea from russia now would spark a big domestic crisis and that 's certainly not going to happen for such nebulous things like ` greater recognition and respect in the world ' , whatever that actually means . 
  i 'm not sure it 's such an extreme minority . 
  in a recent poll on immigration conducted in november 2016 , 78 % of respondents agreed with the statement ` government should reduce the flow of foreign migrants to russia ' , 14 % agreed with ` government should stimulate the flow of foreign migrants to russia ' and 8 % with ` difficult to say ' . 
   why have n't we yet done the same ? 
  which countries should get a blanket ban in our case ? 
  there are still russians repatriating from uzbekistan and kyrgyzstan , we ca n't shaft them like that . 
  plus kyrgyzstan is in the eeu , so i do n't think we can do that anyway . 
  turkmenistan is a pretty closed off country , there are barely any turkmens coming into russia . 
  neither do i , but russia is n't claiming them anyway . 
  the goal seems to be to shove them back into ukraine on terms that are favourable to russia , like federalisation of ukraine . 
   go to poland and you 'll see russians and ukrainians doing the same thing . 
  ukrainians yes , but there are n't a lot of russians going to poland . 
  belarusians are in fact a distant second to ukrainians in terms of migration to poland . 
  russians are behind moldovans and turks and make up a whopping 0,7 % of immigrants to poland . 
   go to russia and you 'll see tadziks , kazakhs and so on . 
  not so much kazakhs , there are mostly ethnic russians repatriating from kazakhstan . 
  but lots of ukrainians though , who 've got the first place among immigrants now . 
  for some reason i can only find the stats on eu immigration for 2009 and 2013/2014/2015 . 
  there were n't a lot of russians coming to poland in those years . 
  there were also * a lot * less ukrainians coming to poland in 2009 though .
