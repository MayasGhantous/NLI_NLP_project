  \\* tards generating content, 
  i wholly agree but unfortunately i think we 're stuck with it , whether we 're being polite about it or not :(, 
  gon na think about voting with my wallet when my sub is up . 
  unfortunately that wo n't be in a while since i stupidly trusted ccp with buying 2 + years in advance . 
  i really feel betrayed by them because of this . 
  edit : i also agree that majority of players dropped the ball on this as much as ccp did by going * hurrrrrrrrrr free sp drool * . 
  because of this one of the pillars of the game is significantly undermined now . 
  log out of the game for a couple of days you basement dwelling idiot , maybe then you 'll understand . 
  it 's not 10k sp , it 's 20 % training boost . 
  nobody here says they do n't like the game . 
  i think it actually does . 
  yeah , i thought it already did that but does n't . 
  it was a suggestion that i read a while ago . 
  what basis in reality does this have ? 
  are authorities really going to record off every camera available everywhere all the time ? 
  looks really stretched to me without context . 
  disliking a feature ! = disliking the game . 
  i 'm not the only one here saying this too . 
   spitfire has exactly one purpose :, 
  to ruin flanks . 
   and neutralizes flanking classes ( la especially ) . 
  `` i 'll use the balcony and get in through that window , they wo n't be expec - beep beep '', 
  -- me , as la, 
  it 's not like there were hundreds of comments explaining why dailies in general and especially this half-assed implementation are cancer . 
  we 're just throwing a tantrum , right , nbd . 
  maybe the game wants you to play la ? 
  do n't tell me what to do . 
  reaver does more often than other esfs . 
  apparently people can not comprehend that 20 % training speed boost is significant . 
  i 'm not crying , i 'm just not gon na pay anymore . 
  unsuccessfully ( thanks to the omniscient turret ) flanked heavies do anything but tickle . 
  any changes to esf fov ? 
  in my bugreport i reproduced it by going in and out new scanner 's solar system map . 
   edit : it 's also centered on ... 
  nothing ? 
  wow . 
  old camera . 
  new camera . 
  in case you did n't find an option for this yet , yes there is one - dynamic center offset . 
  10 \\* 24 \\* 0.2 = 48 can you even math ? 
  but seriously , you 're a fine example of people who find excuses for these dailies . 
  `` too small reward to care '' , `` vets have no use for this '' ( when in fact they 're getting the same benefit or even bigger one , if you count in skill injectors ) . 
  while turning a blind to lies like [ this ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/4k8l4p/real_talk_about_sp_daily_here/d3d2ni8?context=3 ) and that training uncoupled from login time was one of the main selling points of eve sometime ago and that dailies are considered cancer in many games and are a cheap manipulative trick to inflate some numbers . 
  are you a retard or just * pretending * to be one ? 
   correct use of the overshield, 
  push button - receive hp . 
  wow that was hard . 
  your arguments for 600m default engagement radar can also be applied to motion spotter and we all know how broken it is . 
  bullshit workaround for bullshit bug : never run into tp . 
  always walk or strafe . 
  that always worked for me since i was first given that advice in another thread like this one . 
  in other news , canister is still broken against light armor . 
  chain headshots at range ( i actually fought that guy ) ? 
  definitely not cheating . 
  are you like , 15 ? 
  because you sound like 15 . 
  note how c4 does only 2 % damage on my kill and `` someone '' simultaneously gets multiple headshots on me all in one `` tick '' . 
  for further proof , look there : http://ps2.fisu.pw/killboard/?name=luzyfer&amp;count=1000, 
  previous luzyfer threads :, 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/3x9r1y/can_you_ban_luzyfer_already/ - 5 months ago , and he was already known back then . 
  / u/radar _ x , ? 
  ( not that i expect an answer lol ), 
  `` instant action is currently unavailable , please try again later . '', 
  roof was pretty hostile , did n't know max was on that side until it was too late , went suicide mode . 
  no , it explodes on the first click of `` the button . '', 
  arming time is between drop and first allowed `` button '' click . 
  source : actually tested in vr just in case . 
  clearly that was my problem here , the detonator was pretty visible , 
  looking at that hp bar dancing up and down gave me cancer . 
  that 's the gist of it . 
  reddit is often bad but forums ( any , in general ) are worse . 
  `` good feature '' aka every ship is golden . 
  what ? 
  no i 'm not saying that . 
   this can potentially increase performance , because windows primarily runs on core 0 , and thus when planetside needs to do something it can be stuck in line behind those windows processes . 
  this is bullshit . 
  edit : also another thing : this game has been properly multithreaded for quite a while now . 
  it usually uses 60-65 % of my 4770k @ 4.4 ghz with ht enabled . 
  this roughly means that all `` real '' cores are at 100 % and there 's some load spilling to ht cores . 
  and you 're suggesting to limit available cpus in this situation ? 
  it 's fine as long as components are in a well ventilated case . 
  actually that last % number for gpu is fan speed , it 's controlled by the driver and it apparently targets 80 \u00b0 c as nominal under load . 
  it will reduce fan speed if temps are dropping to low 70s and increase if it goes above 80 so the fan usually hovers around 56 % . 
  i can cool it down to 60 ish degrees if i crank the fan to 85-95 % but i like my ears more , and gpu is fine anyway , 
  windows always tries to spread load evenly across cpus . 
  there is no `` special '' cpu unless you make one by setting affinity for a process . 
  there is no documentation or evidence for any special affinity for any internal windows processes . 
  i 'll say it : fuck the cancer that are dailies , in any shape or form . 
  i actually nearly stopped wanting to play the new league when i remembered about having to re level masters . 
  link me those `` massive '' `` completely altering '' changes . 
  there were a couple of tweaks to entosis mod penalties , interceptors , node count and node passive regen . 
  hardly completely changing . 
  show me on this doll where bad greyscale and fozzie touched you . 
   windows usually only uses the one core . 
  do you have a good source supporting that statement ? 
  what is `` windows '' in that context anyway ? 
  shell ? 
  services ( which ) ? 
  window manager ? 
  kernel/drivers ?
