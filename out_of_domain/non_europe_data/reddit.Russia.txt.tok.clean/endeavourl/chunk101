  do you have a source for your `` specifics '' ? 
  they do n't make sense anyway . 
  you 're referencing windows 7 release in the future , what ? 
  what do you mean by `` proper managed code architecture into the kernel '' ? 
   functionality to start dynamically scheduling tasks across the least utilized cores, 
  again what do you mean by `` tasks '' here ? 
  and why do you think the load is not spread already when a quick look at process explorer suggests otherwise ? 
  unfortunately the game is too intensive . 
  i have to turn shadows off in any big fights to avoid fps dipping into 50s . 
  and i run 4770k on 4.4 ghz . 
  welp, 
   the msw-r is more controllable than the carv because it has biased recoil . 
  i wonder who thought that up . 
  biased recoil generally means more compensation means harder to use .

  i always wonder , why does this sub hate la ? 
  these kind of discussions are always downvoted . 
  meanwhile * jetpack * la duels are mostly a matter of who manages to land first and make cof less than entire screen wide . 
  the irony . 
  brb swapping out a cap transfer for a beam laser or something, 
  \\  someone clicks a smartbomb/fleets are bombed, 
  \\  rip your drone, 
  \\  also rip your only sabre that you previously could n't rep from hull damage because no rep drones, 
  may as well remove la then . 
  if you take away c4 , there 's nothing that la can do better than other classes . 
  except occasional beacon placements i guess . 
  flying is n't really enough . 
  i mean it 's fun and sometimes powerful but ultimately it 's a gimmick and you can always be more efficient by picking another class . 
  especially with spotters all around . 
  this is supported by stats showing that % of la players decreases as br goes up . 
  source : disillusioned la main . 
  this is his new channel : https://www.youtube.com/user/justinmead1205/videos also most/all can be found on eve-files in better quality . 
  the best videos of large scale combat imo . 
  \\* eagerly waits for the new one , it 's been a year it 's almost time ... , 
  when every fight has 10 motion spotters and 50 % of obstacles/elevations can be overcome by jerking off the spacebar key - la is redundant . 
  it can shine sometimes , but if you want to accomplish something in the game you better off spawning any other class . 
  or you can just re-take your portrait leaving some space at the bottom if it bothers you so much . 
  it 's a bug . 
  known bug with a workaround is still a bug . 
  they did that too . 
  why do n't people use ts3 ? 
  i 've been hearing about mumble overlay problems for like 4 years now . 
  idk , there were numerous occasions of 500 clients on our server during big campaigns . 
  it guy said it was pretty strained and asked to keep main channel chatter to a minimun but otherwise it endured well . 
   shit, 
  wow , that 's definitive . 
   expensive to run the server, 
  the server software is free up to 512 clients . 
  well we never did ( unless someone ddos 'd us ) . 
  nope , all automated . 
  i think it 's the same on ts3 . 
  there are access groups that you can be assigned , including based on your api . 
  plenty of action , the system just decides not to spawn you anywhere . 
  i still do n't understand what 's wrong with potentially dying once after ia if it let 's you to get to a fight without redeploy hopping . 
  i 'm starting to get annoyed with stuff that is breaking in my main browser . 
  in addition to this : https://redd.it/4k5122 ( bug report filed ) not being fixed ,, 
  disabling directwrite ( vivaldi : / / flags #disable - direct-write ) now [ breaks ] ( https://vivaldi.net/en-us/teamblog/120-vivaldi-1-2-with-mouse-gestures#!/ccomment-comment=18309 ) ui fonts and font anti-aliasing in tabs that were opened in background . 
  i 've just discovered this directwrite flag and it was a huge relief for my eyes that were straining with previously blurry fonts . 
  and now it 's broken ( but works fine in chrome 51 , mind you ) . 
  are you seriously arguing for roam-less null right now ? 
  this is tracking titans all over again . 
  instalocking tracking titans . 
  it does n't help that there were multiple blogs describing different development revisions . 
  i end up googling most of citadel related stuff , with moderate success :\\, 
   all what you pointed above allow carriers to handle issue of untanked , linked nano ships . 
  that * suddenly * became eve 's biggest problem now and must be dealt with at any cost , amirite ? 
  i do n't know . 
  new sounds sound too mild , really like something watery . 
  but old ones sounded too much like loud static . 
  * all * they had to do was replace the old nc-centric loading screen with something equally epic but neutral . 
  but they went and replaced that * and * old beautiful continent loading screens with creepy drawings of one faction dogpiling on a single member of another . 
  [ citation needed ], 
   it 's obviously not game breaking , it just seems like a grind point for some folks and everyone has them . 
  we 'll respect that . 
  point-and-click user calls someone a shitter . 
  the irony . 
  go use chrome with that attitude . 
  teach me to evade an instalocking carrier . 
  so make a feature to make another feature optional ? 
  # bringing solo back, 
  well i 'm disabling directwrite so i expect that that file is not used ? 
  it did n't help . 
  also the new stable update with new chromium version did n't help too . 
  huh , there 's no chromedwritecache even after enabling and disabling directwrite . 
  the issue persists , [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8hh81zk.png ) is broken ui font and [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xuarldr.png ) is no aa on fonts in tabs loaded in background . 
  i 'm using windows 8.1 , gtx 770 and 64 bit vivaldi ( 32 bit version does n't help though ) . 
   it just bugs out the gui causing it to slow to a crawl or just stop responding , requiring a restart of the browser . 
  yeah , sometimes after doing that it starts eating cpu and hangs for sometime . 
  i have 16gb and do n't crash with ps2 memory usage 5gb + . 
  my friend however has the same amount of ram and it crashes very predictably for him . 
  remove fog everywhere . 
  i wonder whether that change was intentional or not . 
  amerish has shitty fog now , and it was the continent with the most clear air :\\, 
  yeah i know , i deleted it from there and now it does n't get created with either directwrite setting . 
  i wonder whether that change was intentional or not . 
   how many people are inadvertently double clicking on a 2 pixel strip while their cursor is two vertical arrows ? 
  enough , that opera 12 used to have [ this option ] ( http://i.imgur.com/h8pezap.png ) . 
  now , shove that condescending attitude up your ass and go fuck yourself . 
  it 's on their youtube now https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duhfkmadway, 
  they do n't represent the game .
