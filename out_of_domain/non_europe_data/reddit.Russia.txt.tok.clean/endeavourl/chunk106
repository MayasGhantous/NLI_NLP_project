  isk for injectors is a flawed argument because ccp reassured players they wo n't use injectors as an excuse to introduce sp grind when they announced them . 
  just like they said that training would always be * the only * way sp enters the game . 
  anyway , this particular argument is a lot more vague then the one i initially commented about . 
  that is : players doing dailies are at clear sp and/or isk advantage over those who are n't , regardless of reason . 
  i hope we 've figured that out and stopped calling somebody not doing dailies `` not-a-player '' . 
  therefore , the question is stupid and op is pushing his agenda . 
   lmao 20 % ? 
  it 's nowhere near that high . 
  sp/day daily bonus ( 10k / sp/day ), 
  baseline : 1800 * 24 = 43200 23.15 %, 
  avg ( +3 s ) : 2100 * 24 = 50400 19.84 %, 
  theoretical max :2700 * 24 = 64800 15.43 %, 
  just shows how educated an average player is about the issue . 
   should n't people that actually play the game have an advantage over people who does n't play the game ? 
  you can argue that but one of the basic rules of eve has always been no sp/leveling grinds . 
  now with injectors you actually have some sp advantage if you play more but injectors have diminishing returns that clearly mark the intended user group and reduce effectiveness for players that do n't need extra boost . 
  100 % workaround : walk into tp , do not run in . 
  wonder when will this get fixed . 
  probably in a year or something . 
  just get a habit of not running into tps ever . 
  depress shift every time and soon you 'll do it automatically . 
  i 've never dies since i started doing that . 
  meh ... music is not something you can release every 6 weeks and expect to maintain quality . 
  they all became so bland and repetitive . 
  [ that one ] ( https://soundcloud.com/ccpgames/eve-online-apocrypha-2009?in=ccpgames/sets/eve-online-login-screen-music ) still give me chills though . 
  what 's the point now anyway , with laucher replacing login screen ? 
  it does n't play music nor say `` connecting '' :\\, 
   1500 euro pc, 
  actual specs ? 
   big streamers didnt play the league that much because of the performance , when big streamers dont play the game , it affects also the playerbase a bit . 
  any actual footage of big streamers having performance issues ? 
  i 'm on ssd and i never load longer than 5s . 
  that was either a hdd or network lag . 
  he 's not wrong though . 
  * edgy *, 
  this is the actual problem , not the op . 
  and in general , ways to interrupt entosis while not committing to fight . 
  yeah , i 've died exactly same way . 
  the boss shot my golem that was pretty far away but aoe is just too big . 
  i feel bad lmaoing at that micro aux core % ), 
  do you play ps2 in 4k ? 
  with shadows ? 
  what the ... 
  ah , yes i was thinking that might be the reason . 
  it does look better . 
   honestly , how often do you deal with he spamming spawns these days ? 
  literally never . 
  fury buses though ... 
  because making some ( but not all ) landing pads and * some other areas * detonate mines and not mark them appropriately is such good game design . 
  just as good dbg does it . 
  `` as good '' means '' [ worse ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/4rmojq/game_update_77/d52n4xq ) '' in this context . 
  \\  make an artillery range tank, 
  \\  make an actual complementing secondary 3 years later, 
  i 'm russian and my ping is 70 , as it is for most other russians . 
  i do n't even live in big city . 
  it has nothing to do with where you live unless that 's like 1/3 of the globe away . 
  it 's just shitty providers and routing . 
   they said before they 'll never implement any ping caps . 
  ffs at least make it 2-3 seconds so it 's harder to lagswitch . 
   make a tank that encourages aggressive if risky ( but active ) play, 
  is that magrider you 're talking about ? 
  please do n't tell me that the ability to make yourself stationary encourages risky play especially when it 's coupled with projectile speed buff . 
  you can use it aggressively ( if you manage to brake in time first ) but that 's just putting yourself into situations with no exit . 
  so prowler drivers should just forgo es ability benefits and run fs against magburn and shield ? 
  balanced . 
  i 'm also not happy with artillery-prowler but not using the ability advantages is stupid . 
  bear on the horizon represent !, 
  that 's blocking reddit 's income though :\\ usually the ads here are fine so i keep it whitelisted . 
  i 've been reporting those ads for now , they stop popping up after that . 
  edit : am i downvoted for my own choice of whitelisting reddit ads ? 
  i did n't say you should do it . 
  edit : literally downvoted for my own choice . 
  this sub is great . 
  i generally agree that shotguns are unfun to play against and fun/unfun to play with . 
  shotgun max however is stupid broken . 
  all maxs are op but nc one is just stupid . 
  some sort of indication that player is invulnerable would be nice . 
  and you 've wasted a quarter of your magazine , given out your presence all for nothing . 
   also only shitters farm sundies for ez kills . 
  as la i always look for weak sundies to blow up . 
   you can thank the few douchebags for shooting damn good people . 
  this does n't sound racist to me . 
  is that windows xp ? 
  / r/infantryside, 
  how swiss people shower ? 
  very quietly and before sunset . 
  huh , so how do `` private '' beaches where you have to pay entrance fee operate ? 
  could you just swim in there as well ? 
  most people ( not swiss ) i know that know about it call it `` zermatt mountain '' . 
  i get annoyed with this at times :\\, 
  the problem with ah was it a2a efficiency , not a2g capability . 
  any ai gun or rocketpods would 've given same result here ( i.e. 
  killed a clump of infantry really fast ) . 
   pilots 100 times better than you personally worked with wrel to put coyotes into a better roll, 
  because that 's server lag , not network lag . 
  it clearly says so right there . 
  people in comments here have no clue . 
  a good start for me would be pi interface showing up in planet mode . 
  ca n't even restart my extractors now . 
  any solutions ?
