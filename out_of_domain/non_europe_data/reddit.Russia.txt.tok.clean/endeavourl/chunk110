  when you right click an orb and mouse over an item its stats/mods that would be changed by the orb could be highlighted . 
  i wonder what devs think about this . 
   i never played game with so many bugs | issues !, 
  you 're probably going to be downvoted but this is the truth . 
  will you pay us to do qa ? 
  but_why . gif, 
  op playing the long con . 
   and it never is more than 2 ` dots ' in from the edge as well . 
  wait , what ? 
  til . 
  i 'm using [ this 144hz monitor ] ( http://aoc-europe.com/en/products/g2460pqu ) along with some benq model 1080p@60hz and gtx 770 . 
  there are no problems with this setup except you need to run your games in full screen ( real , not windowed ) to make sure stuff on the second screen wo n't affect your game ( this also applies for single-screen systems , just less so ) . 
  something like telegram/other messenger on 2nd screen probably wo n't affect your windowed game on the 1st but watching streams/videos definitely does for me . 
  as others have said , buying 144hz monitor specifically for ps2 is wasteful since the game ca n't achieve such frame rate most of the time . 
  however , after switching to 144hz , even the os became more pleasant to use for me , not to mention other games that can render stable 80 + fps . 
   those assholes went out of business, 
  [ they just changed their name/owner ] ( https://www.daybreakgames.com/home ) . 
  * rocket primary, 
  * skill sticks, 
  * `` tea bag '',

  kill yourself, 
  ( in game ), 
  nice !, 
  another workaround for another bug !, 
  fozzie did n't even create the majority of citadel mechanics . 
  ccp ytterbium did and he 's no longer at ccp . 
  next time you 're about to say something dumb , do some research first . 
  stopped by a pass-through shield , then glitched into solid model . 
  / u/wrel ? 
  this is pretty much the sole reason i 'm disgusted by infantry play right now . 
  well this and nc max , but those are not spammed as much as the spotter is . 
  psa : shared cache ( new ) is not the same as client cache ( old ) . 
  former was introduced ( relatively ) recently and stores on-demand game data used by all clients . 
  latter is the actual cache that stores avatars , icons and other `` dymanic '' stuff ; it is per-client and is stored next to the client 's user settings . 
  it 's safe to entirely delete the latter while it 's better to verify the former using the new laucher ( unless you want to redownload all/majority of game data ) . 
  shared cache is located at ` % programdata % \\ ccp \\ eve \\ sharedcache ` by default . 
  client cache is next to your settings profiles for that client , for example : ` % localappdata % \\ ccp \\ eve \\ c_programdata_ccp_eve_sharedcache_tq_tranquility \\ cache ` . 
  it 's simple . 
  it 's just another broken thing in the game . 
  any shield like that one will likely not let you through if you have some horizontal velocity . 
  kindergarden level insults definitely require their own reddit threads . 
  @devs , maybe `` accent color from page '' setting is buried too deep for such a drastic and experience-defining setting ? 
  just a thought . 
  `` everything that forces me to pay attention to the game and not play on autopilot is bullshit '' -- poe players since 2015 . 
  it 's the game 's problem not your problem . 
  this . 
  there are hundreds of top level comments in this thread and not a single one mentions alternatives ( at least on the first page ) . 
  i thought an open market such as us would heavily employ competition and alternatives to combat such ridiculous markups . 
  and that users of that market would find it obvious to search for an alternative as soon as they smell bullshit pricing . 
  this seems like a simple case where you need to be educated and vote with your wallet . 
  surely you can move a couple for personal use ? 
  how can they tell you did n't buy them before the trip ? 
  i wonder how much do they cost in mexico ? 
  this time it was like those charity supers that get 2.5 k + people on the killmail . 
  no resistance ( actual or possible ) , no relevant ongoing conflict , no fun gameplay . 
  just an expensive thing dying to the pileup . 
  b-r was way more interesting to read about ( even though gameplay quality was just as low ) . 
  this is just ... meh . 
  killing beacons with knives was broken much more recently . 
  spotters yes , beacons - no since a couple of months . 
  broken . 
  well since [ xander ] ( https://twitter.com/xanderclauss ) works on h1z1 now i guess we can say good bye to map design iteration in ps2 . 
  this . 
  `` ccp , give distributed objectives '' - `` omg nodes are cancer '', 
  `` ccp , n +1 sucks '' - `` fuck you ccp , wtf are damage caps and entosis wands '', 
  `` ccp , nerf teleportation '' - `` omg fautigue sucks '', 
  or you could 've gotten 1-2 meters closer and killed the guy with much less risk . 
  never fly when fighting . 
  your cof becomes your entire fucking screen and the only way you can possibly win becomes through rng . 
  you want to be on the ground / * land * before/as soon as you engage someone . 
  also , if the other guy tried to run away shuffling left and right instead of flying in a straight line , you probably would not have killed him . 
  and do n't even start me on medkits . 
  so much for being la and having a jetpack , i know . 
  flash grenades suck . 
  they do n't affect hud , they have bad range and do n't detonate on impact . 
  one starts the engagement by flying up , with icarus too , getting out of his weapon 's effective range . 
  the other ca n't kill the easy flying frag and then tries to ~ ~ run ~ ~ slowly fly away in a straight line . 
  why the fuck does that thing get fury/kobalt ? 
  oh right , cash grab . 
   who the fuck knows anymore . 
  exactly . 
  welcome to ~ ~ soe ~ ~ dbg . 
   the problem is that senators actually passed a law requiring schools to buy these . 
  does the law state that schools are required to buy this exact brand ? 
  hmm ...

  non-authoritative answer :, 
  *** ca n't find 1e100 . net : no answer, 
  do you want some pepper with that salt ? 
  your title implies how good flash grenades are when in fact they are pretty bad . 
  i 've pointed that out and also that you would 've killed the guy easily without relying on flash grenades and doing bad moves like flying mid-engagement . 
  i 've also pointed out that the kill was basically given to you by the other guy who could not hit easy target ( you ) and failed at running away . 
  again , no thanks to flash grenade . 
  just take the advice , or you will continue to bad . 
   the other guy who < ...  and failed at running away . 
   i 've been playing this game for a long time , i know how to play, 
  i hate to turn to stats , [ but no ] ( http://ps2.fisu.pw/player/?name=trashlordprime&amp;show=statistics ) . 
   i enjoy how i play,
