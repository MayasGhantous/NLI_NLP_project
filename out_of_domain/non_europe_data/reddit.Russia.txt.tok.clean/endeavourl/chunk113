  i have n't reinstalled the game since 2013 . 
  this texturing bug did n't happen until the last patch . 
   the obvious thing to do is to incentivize a2a esfs to fly out of reach of g2a launchers , while forcing a2g esfs to fly close to the ground in order to engage ground . 
  no need to make g2a even better at protecting allied a2g . 
  please explain to me , how is it going to do this if i 'm using custom block lists ? 
  i use it too and do n't have any problems clearly related to x64 , besides maybe a crash when dragging page contents . 
  although other people have it too , so it 's not clearly related to x64 . 
  what 's funny though is that i browsed a video sharing site recently , that shows new videos as you scroll , so the browser was n't able to free video resources , in the gpu process in particular . 
  so it grew to 4gb and , despite being 64-bit , crashed/restarted . 
  keep posting in the sub that no dev reads . 
  it sure helps . 
  they wo n't give a fuck , until posts like this one will occupy the top of / r/planetside daily . 
   also esf make no sound while in standstill hovermode . 
  can not hear that lolhammer hovering right next to the building on most occasions . 
  peek-a-fucking-boo , airhammer got you !, 
  this is a problem with sound engine , not esfs . 
  simply make the address bar loading animation start on click , not on first response or something . 
  default squad logistics : good . 
  scout radar : whatever . 
  just kill the valk . 
  wow , nice sarcasm . 
  have you ever been shot by flak from a different base while flying at the flight ceiling ? 
  because pilots deal with this shit regularly . 
  this happened to me once about 1y ago . 
  skyguard definitely needs more range . 
  10/10 suggestion . 
  just use the flask \u2122, 
  just ones that were posted multiple times from the top of my head . 
  keep telling yourself that . 
  i was reddit when h1z1 was released, 
  cheaters everywhere, 
  and you ? 
  expect sub 30-25 fps in any kind of fights . 
  because , judging by how things are , the only way to make vehicles stable with this physics engine is to give them retarded mass . 
  i expected that debris one-shot . 
  so stupid . 
  hey man , your country is awesome !, 
  i keep blowing considerable amounts of money to visit every 2 or 3 years and it just does n't get old . 
  please show me a video of you consistently headshotting through medkit regen/invuln on a spastically warping target . 
   medkits are busted atm because they give near instant 100 % health . 
  they give ** more ** than that . 
  it 's not one time top-off to 100 % hp . 
  they give you insane regen for a second allowing you to regain your * full * hp twice under fire . 
  just remove them . 
  resto kits will do fine . 
  you always have reward gems . 
  mechanically , there are many better games than this one . 
  way less buggy too . 
  consider playing again when you feel like trying an open-world-ish fps . 
  `` 0.75 ads is useless '', 
  `` wait what ? 
  do n't you dare remove it !, 
  please do anything except javascript . 
  poor oop support , a ton of implicit conversions , tricky syntactic `` magic '' , etc etc. 
  plenty of opportunity to get some terrible coding habits . 
  is binding it to space and holding it with your thumb * that * hard ? 
  no they should if they want . 
  i just do n't get why is it a big deal and discussed so much . 
   i mention this as it is my understanding from the lore that a ha is the bread and butter front line soldier and therefore should be a meaty one man fighting machine, 
  haha , the *** lore *** argument !, 
  we play the game , not the lore therefore the latter fits the former , not other way around . 
  and , speaking about the game , some people consider one class having a tremendous * direct * advantage over others at the main game activity a shit mechanic . 
  and no , this does n't have anything to do with skill . 
  light assault is not a support class . 
  infiltrator is partially not a support class . 
  what is a `` front line combatant '' in an fps game with style targeted for younger audiences ? 
  how does the game design of `` front line combatant '' contribute to fun game experience for everyone ? 
  java has nothing to do with javascript . 
  and java browser plugin ( usually implied when talking about vulnerabilities ) is a tiny part of java ecosystem of jre , jdk , java language and many other things . 
  biomass ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ irl, 
   everything is fast except opening a new tab . 
  opening a new tab takes 2-4 seconds and then i have to wait a second or so to start typing or it wo n't register everything, 
  this is one of my main issues right now . 
  i can spam middle click on the ** + ** button in old/new opera and get like 5 + tabs opening and closing per second . 
  whereas in vivaldi it barely manages to do ~ 1 per second . 
  ( i 'm using an oc 'd i7 cpu too ), 
  not saying this is a regular mode of use but it shows how delayed the tab opening is . 
  it 's a small thing but it gets irritating to wait those couple of seconds every time you open a new tab . 
  the other issues are crash on content drag ( x64 related ? ), 
  and lack of google live search suggestions . 
  i will try it again ( probably 32 bit version too ) . 
  can you try spamming middle click as i described ? 
  the expected behaviour is smooth reaction ( tab opening or closing ) to every click ( within reason , of course ) . 
  actually , as the other guy here mentioned , the issue is with the start page background image . 
  without it the tab opens as you show in the gif . 
  i like having the image though , so i guess a bug report is due . 
  i 'm using custom 1080p wallpaper . 
  the `` fix * my * stuff last '' argument . 
  very old . 
  they all were probably res 'd 20s later . 
  * muh elitism *, 
  i did n't refer to op but to all mlgpro has for whom everyone in the game except some 10 players are shitters . 
  the other classes are there just to suck off has by either giving them ez kills or supporting them doing it . 
  as someone , who literally never shook hands with a teacher of either gender , this is so bizarre and out of proportion and for some reason it keeps going . 
  people need narrative i guess . 
  needs to be vector or higher resolution . 
  go see a doctor if you hate people so much over a video game . 
  these non-standard messages make it look like they are so proud of themselves for banning a cheater after months of activity and reports . 
  this is a fucking shame . 
  that would be cancer .
