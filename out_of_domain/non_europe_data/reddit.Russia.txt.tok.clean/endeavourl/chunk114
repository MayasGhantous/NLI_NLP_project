  no build zones , on the other hand , could be interesting . 
   and they are a great way to recover a lot more of life/mana than from a normal flask . 
  since most of the mana is usually reserved , it 's more important to sustain flask mana regen than it is to restore a big chunk at once . 
  and you need saturated to do that , which overrides caustic . 
  so it appears that background file size has a big impact onthe start page open time . 
  i recorded some tests and timed them frame by frame . 
  i measured time between first ** + ** button animation and vivaldi start page favicon appearing for new tab . 
  i also allowed a warmup of ~ 5 clicks . 
  default background , no image : 437 ms. 
  1080p jpg ( 900 kb ) background : 500 ms. 
  1080p bmp ( 5 mb ) background : 855 ms. 
  tbh 450-500 ms still feels sluggish , less responsive than native ui of other browsers . 
  but it is way better than bmp load time i used to have .

   intel tool, 
   looks at kills, 
  / r/nocontext, 
  pls add fragments for more effect . 
  what 's the point of you pumping these out when none of them have or will ever get into the game ? 
  \\  tfw 2/3 hp = barely tickles, 
  idk , both `` whitelisted domains '' and `` exception rules '' ( ` @@ ... ` ) work for me . 
  definitely cert hover 3 ( just in case you did n't ) if you 're not using racer . 
  certing fs/flares improves your uptime ( by reducing cooldown ) so cert those when you feel like need an improvement there . 
  get banshee if you like fast-paced a2g . 
  you can trial it if you 're not sure about that but you 'll have no thermal and mag size which are pretty important . 
  all in all it 's a good gun after the buffs and you will get your certs back using it without too much trouble . 
  you missed the point . 
  * muh immersion *, 
  have n't been killed by he in ages except some odd one-time occurrences . 
  why do people keep going about it ? 
  execute this game is more like it . 
  there are dozens of them on a single server . 
   maxes are pathetically easy to kill, 
  except that oneshot max variety . 
  i just tend not to play aurora materials and octagon , he-wise esamir is ok outside of those bases . 
  just a little bit ( a whole lot ) of a headless chicken behaviour . 
  and that helps me how inside a building ? 
  this kind of change was discussed numerous times in la threads . 
   but saying the ha is overpowered by design is like saying the medic if too good at healing or the la too good at flanking . 
  aaaand you suck at game design as much as the guy who made the `` push button - receive hp '' mechanic . 
  they pop up quite often . 
  the fact that you are clearly not interested in the topic does n't remove its merit . 
   hit reg , pings, 
  wrel certainly has power over those . 
  all the mlg ha mains having a fit itt are hilarious . 
  this is a welcome and a long awaited change . 
  there are flaws and then there are dozens of cheaters on eu servers and very little being done about them, 
  pretty . 
  still no blue flash though . 
  do you guys not like blue flashes ? 
   while watching the video , almost none of the musicians were ever actually looking at the conductor . 
  well this is just wrong . 
  watch again , they 're giving the conductor quick glances every 10-15 seconds , especially soloists , especially in slow parts . 
  and the camera must catch their face of course . 
  also each group of players watches their principal who follows the conductor . 
   note : you can also cloak-trick with a taxi in an afterburner , if you overheat said afterburner , and use a t2 cloak . 
  oh , so i misunderstood that and you can do it in an mwd + t1 cloak and you do n't have to use ab ? 
  incidentally , i 've always fit my taxis with mwd and cloak , so now i actually know when i should use them , thanks , 
   scamming is a bannable offense because it falls under the category of player harassment, 
  that 's not what harassment means . 
  ggg stated , however , that scamming goes on your record and should other issues arise it will be taken against you . 
  fuck off with us politics , it 's not like there 's lack of that on the internet right now . 
  * endeavour *, 
  i was reading your comment like `` yeah . 
  right . 
  makes sense . 
  ok ... wait wth are bloom filters ? '', 
  til . 
  looking at the wiki description it seems not too complicated . 
   improvements of several russian translations to be clear , shorter and closer to the english original , e.g. 
  `` shields '' are not translated as `` \u0449\u0438\u0442\u044b '' instead of `` \u0441\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044f '' , and `` damage '' is now translated as `` \u0443\u0440\u043e\u043d '' instead of `` \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0435\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435 '' . 
  `` xl '' and `` capital '' when referring to a module or charge size are now consistently translated as `` \u0421\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0445\u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0439 '' . 
  we did it reddit !, 
  now to see is they follow through with the rest . 
  it may provide better authority than reddit threads . 
  tbf there are bugs with cloak visibility and levels . 
  i personally am not sure in like 50 % cases whether that guy that killed me in stalker cloak is cheating , saw a bug , or was just lucky . 
   exactly , i 'm seeing way more people complaining about hackers than hackers . 
  check out / r/millerplanetside in that case . 
  actually , firefox does that . 
  i just recently read that it constantly writes into a js file ( ca n't remember the name ) on the order of 10s of gbs per day long session . 
  ( found the article ( in russian ) : https://geektimes.ru/post/280792/ ), 
  i would n't be surprised if chrome/ium does something similar though . 
  also pls fix using hornet optics making them dumbfire . 
  i 'm tired of this bug being brought up against them . 
   they are very good and easy infantry killers . 
   try them , you 'll be surprised . 
  they can be good and effective , but easy ? 
  i would n't call laser-guiding ( almost ) direct hits on infantry by controlling a large inertial airborne vehicle with an intricate control scheme while being exposed to all dumbfires and aps in the hex easy . 
   i 'm actually shocked that someone could play this game for more than a week and not have at least had hornets used against them while they 're infantry to see glimpse of how effortlessly pilots pop infantry with them . 
  so i looked at my fisu kb which shows last 1000 events and there was a single , one , death to hornets as infantry . 
  in my whole playtime i 've been killed 65 times by them , nc and vs combined . 
  i 'm not trying to sound elitist because i 'm certainly not elite , but maybe there 's a problem with people 's playstyle ... 
  edit : this got me kinda interested . 
  meanwhile hacksaws ( l+r ) got 241 kills on me . 
  blueshifts ( l+r ) - 270 . 
  so maybe ( just maybe ) there are bigger balance problems than hornets performance against infantry . 
  [ statistics is fascinating ] ( http://ps2oraclestats.com?stat=kpu&amp;weapon1=7506&amp;weapon2=7528&amp;weapon3=4746 ) , is n't it ?
