  fuck lockons . 
  why does this always come up ? 
  what do latency limits have to do with fixing deliberate lagswitching , which introduces latencies much longer than * any * routing geography would ? 
  it 's just * lazyness * or incompetence , or both . 
  i did implement a latency limiter for a directplay udp based game server once , so there 's that . 
  edit : downvoted for describing a project i worked on ? 
  that 's a first one !, 
  even 1s would be perfectly fine . 
  realistically , even eu/au connections should be below 500ms . 
  i do n't imagine 500ms would be playable anyway . 
  yes , because it is coupled to vehicle movement which is constrained by manoeuvrability and external factors like gravity , terrain and exposure . 
  mana av/ravens are easy . 
  hornets - not so much . 
  chromium has [ a lot ] ( http://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/ ) of command line options . 
  maybe [ this ] ( https://www.chromium.org/user-experience/user-data-directory ) will help . 
  the game allows me like 10-15s of dropped connection when my internet restarts every 24h . 
  then it plays catch-up fast-forwarding everything that i missed but continues to work normally . 
  there 's no reason why this should be allowed . 
   people who write kk instead of m are literally braindead tbh, 
  fyi you 've just called the entire russian community `` braindead '', 
  in addition to all outlined presentation issues . 
  why ca n't you minimize the new map in windowed mode ? 
  i like it too . 
  however , all the issues in op are valid and pressing and were already reported ( some by me ) at least a year ago . 
  they did make more gradations for system stats but still not enough , still using cluttering circles and no further work done since then . 
  might as well apply it to interceptors then which defeats the purpose . 
  the difference is quite big but with regards to fatigue 's purpose ( prohibiting mass `` teleportation '' ) it 's not * that * big . 
  put it this way : the difference between shuttle and interceptor for travel purposes is less than that between shuttle and industrial ( that has fatigue reduction ) . 
  eve uses awesomium which is quite slow on updates i think . 
  actually it seems to be abandoned since 2014 . 
  i 'm not against the new structure prices per se but i sure would love to hear from ccp about reasons for such steep pricing compared to pos . 
   melee definitely should be more powerful than ranged builds, 
  how can you be more powerful than oneshotting 3 screens of mosters in a single attack ? 
  while also being `` melee '' ? 
  i mean ** '' ** melee ** '' ** . 
  / u/bburness, 
   if it ai n't broke do n't fix it, 
  they had to change it to incorporate alphas . 
  so saying that is pretty pointless . 
  hide the vertical text , use the icons , get free screen real estate . 
  nothing to get all noisy about . 
  are gambling sites organized crime though ? 
   or you get called out for hating cancer-ridden crippled orphans with malaria, 
  who gives a shit ? 
  it 's eve , lol . 
  this whole c4k drama is more empty than us presidential race . 
  shut down because of name and/or agenda ? 
  what do you shut down ? 
  an alliance ? 
  what rules are there to shut down an ingame alliance based on its agenda ? 
  how do you prevent it from reforming ? 
  do n't go full nazi pls . 
  this is actually example of good construction usage . 
  not those bases on the edges of the map no one cares to fight for . 
   so lib players get shit on again . 
  sounds similar to the last air patch . 
  you can always adjust resistances . 
  this is the first time someone gave a shit about what happens in cobalt edge . 
  ccp cares about reddit shitposting how they ca n't muster the balls to go and kick over a * wow , charity * sandcastle ? 
  pathetic . 
  so what 's the scam ? 
  being a renter alliance that calls itself charity ? 
  sounds far fetched . 
  the whole `` charity-sov-invulnerability '' thing only exists in the meta-circlejerk 's mind so it has something to shitpost about . 
  go and fuck it up , this a game not a white knight competition . 
  oh wait you ca n't because pl stands behind it so all you can do is shitpost . 
  i was under impression that rmt does n't generate isk for the seller . 
  so `` parking isk '' in a structure would be pointless , unless you want to unanchor a keepstar later and hope to get away with it . 
  edit : could you like say which part i got wrong instead of downvoting silently ? 
  so no one got accused of ruining charity , right ? 
  obviously pl/nc would protect their interests . 
  the skill sheet needs rework because of alpha clones . 
  there 's no list . 
  what the fuck , it was n't supposed to get drop ? 
  / u/wrel ? 
  we had a revenant ? 
  two actual revenants ? 
  what the fuck i do n't even . 
  in some months it solely depends on the amount of traffic through aridia and derelik :\\, 
  killing original nc titans in uemon/o2o felt so epic and now it would be ` meh whatever ' deal . 
  i too would 've liked a name change :(, 
  after flying logi almost exclusively for like 3 + years , i now always fly dps or tackle for fun fleets . 
  it 's such a joy to get a killmail when you get like 5-10 of them a year . 
  ( note : numbers may seem too low , but i 'm simply not very active ), 
   that rmt money is good, 
  because all betting is rmt . 
  bottlenecks , stalemates , zergs = bad , bad , bad . 
   until you have a clue what 's rly going on, 
  it 's not like hornets and esfs have sound and you just lost half your hp to that . 
  let 's wait more and see . 
  good . 
  this face looks like it 's attached to the back of the head . 
  i do n't know why you 're laughing , i 've experienced 0 % tidi during a sisi masstest . 
  and it was showcased back when ccp veritas introduced it . 
  / r/eve, 
   and was then hunted down by his own faction members . 
  proud to tk . 
  this is just backwards . 
  yep . 
  instant turns , spike damage with pods .
