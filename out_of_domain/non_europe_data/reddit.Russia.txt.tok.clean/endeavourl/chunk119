  as a closing note , here 's the most recent example of ** incompetence ** : https://www.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/5dk8g8/ps2live_official_patch_notes_20161118_tomoe/da5aiy4/, 
  not only did they add the change into their patchnotes that wa n't supposed to go there , this happens and is understandable . 
  but the dev that made the change does n't actually know whether if will be pushed on live in a way it is n't supposed to , and he 's keeping `` fingers crossed '' that it wo n't be . 
   lmg, 
  a like how the player class is an auto pick not worth a mention , 
  as many others are saying , overall fps is a bit worse , but it feels a lot smoother due to fewer and more relaxed spikes . 
  what 's bad is that none of my overlays work ( nvidia and msi afterburner/rtss ) , and when ` fullscreen = true ` in the config file the dx11 version can not start with [ this error ] ( https://i.imgsafe.org/f71cc53522.png ) . 
  launching in window and then alt-entering works but takes suspiciously long and causes some screen flickering . 
  specs :, 
  core i7 4770k , gtx 770 , 16gb ram , 1080p@144hz main display , 1080p60hz secondary display . 
  it ca n't launch fullscreen for me , but it is able to alt-enter to fullscreen . 
  or open production_config . ini and disable fullscreen there . 
  you still can alt-enter dx11 client after it 's launched to get fullscreen performance benefits . 
  yeah i know , you just have to alt enter every launch . 
  for me it does n't update the settings , it only makes the game fullscreen for the current session . 
  idk why the link in the op is to vimeo when his main content is on [ youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/justinmead1205/videos ) . 
  \\  small fleet, 
  \\  all capital drops ( except rnk ), 
  so , another league that does n't force you to commit to new content ? 
  ( evidently you have to activate the `` shrines '' yourself , so - optional ), 
  i thought beacons in spawns were fixed ... 
  * and * he calls himself `` scientist '' . 
  \\  caring about starter corp chat, 
  wtf i just wanted to link that sleipnir one to a friend t_t, 
  / u/mcchaverson did some asshole report your channel or something ? 
  what , you do n't like sound of angry toddlers smashing their toy buckets ? 
  well , dbg do n't care , dbg smash !, 
  enemy heeeaveee spaaahhhttteeeedd, 
  how was it worse ? 
  the old one was literally the sound of ammo shells falling , the new one is a fucking plastic toy bucket . 
   literally the sound of ammo shells falling, 
  ammo shells are metallic, 
  how are they so consistent at fucking their store up every time they open a new one ? 
  this is like the 4th one , right ? 
  anyway , definitely looking forward to spend like 12 % of my monthly ( ruble ) income to get a t-shirt that does n't even have the eve map on it . 
  not . 
  or how about they fix their fucking game . 
  rtss overlay works fine for me . 
  errr , now that shit is empty too i am suspecting he quit . 
  pretty childish to take down everything else with you :\\, 
  pretty childish to take down everything else with you when you quit :\\, 
  anyone got anything saved ? 
  i hate losing good youtube content like this , not the first time it happened :\\, 
  what did he gain by taking it all down ( if he did ) ? 
  nothing , he just shat on his fans and viewers ( if he did , i really do n't want to believe it ) . 
  i hate it when youtubers do this petty shit , the content you relied on just disappears . 
  i think about making my own backups of stuff i like every time like this . 
  that is not nerfing meta . 
  that is replacing one op skill by another . 
  the meta has n't changed in 1.5-2 years . 
  i 'm writing this just to say that i use adblock plus and my cat did n't die because of it yet contrary to what internet would tell you . 
  also , stylish , tampermonkey , image size info . 
  my cat is just fine . 
  * and * his twitch , * and * twitter ? 
   why do you use an adblocking application that lets companies pay them to not block their ads, 
  any actual example of that ? 
  what does that even mean for an open source app that uses 3rd party blocking lists ? 
  like , this negative buzz around abp does n't make any sense to me . 
  it works , it hides everything that i need hidden . 
  mfw i can link eve pics in my work slack chat and not look weird, 
  i think eve qualifies for the `` test of time '' more that anything else . 
  because they 're more visible and not fully aoe . 
  \\  accounting for drop, 
   it 's kinda a forum/reddit trope that sundy shield is useless garbage . 
  people seriously think that ? 
  they can be outright unkillable without an overwhelming force like 20 % overpop with maxes . 
   t2 battleships, 
  bo and marauders are t2 bs . 
   i did n't even attempt to get into an esf . 
  even tried to lame it up with my magrider vpc with thermals . 
  right clicked , no thermals . 
  vehicle optics were refunded at some point , it 's possible you need to rebuy them . 
  next level insurance fraud / s, 
   it 'll be setting your health to 500 , instead of healing it up over a short period, 
  please go live , please go live , please go live, 
   with the amerish skybox bug , it was also by far the most beautiful, 
  and now every continent uses indar skybox that looks out of place and has blinding effect when looking slightly up . 
   only if you are a vehicle driver . 
  what a surprise !, 
  what did you expect , seriously ? 
  edit : oh wow a downvote , so much for a conversation, 
  do n't forget getting into csm first . 
  the effect is so cool but sharp transition between 2 static models ( starbase -  wreck ) really grinds my gears . 
  at this point it does n't make sense to continue to use the product which can only be supported by 3rd party hacks . 
  as a long time eft use , it 's time to make the transition . 
  we did n't have an eft update for more than 6 months and 2 major expansions now . 
  it is dead until the updates start again and/or it is open sourced . 
   only bad las carry c4 by default . 
  not abusing broken mechanics = bad -- / r/planetside, 
  mlg opinions differ here , do you just suck it and let them heal , or do you go mlg-mode and get chain headshots on a spastic jumping target to get through regen ? 
  which one is it ? 
  so that guy suggests not shooting . 
  you suggest aiming ( and , presumably , shooting ) . 
  which one is it ? 
  transport counters a mbt that costs more than double ? 
  np , good design !, 
  moar http://eve-gatecheck.space/eve/, 
  what exactly is * broken * with carrying c4 ? 
  you sure that 's the word you wanted to use ? 
  current medkits are broken because they allow the user to tank shots with extremely high regen rate and invulnerability frames .
