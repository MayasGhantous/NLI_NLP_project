  because the game was intended to be like this ? 
  it 's in the first question in [ faq ] ( https://www.planetside2.com/faq ) . 
   q.what is planetside 2 ? 
  planetside 2 is a revolutionary massive scale first-person shooter where soldiers battle as one in strategic , targeted missions against enemy empires in an all-out planetary war . 
  the game challenges the skill and grit of the most seasoned soldier through intense ** infantry , air , and ground vehicle gameplay ** . 
  if you do n't like vehicles , there 's only one option for you - leave , and save your whining . 
  the more snippets of him i watch the more retarded he seems . 
  which word in `` combined arms '' does he not understand ? 
  you hate vehicles ? 
  what the fuck are you doing under the biolab then ?!, 
  it 's literally vehicle playground there . 
  it was nerfed against vehicles , esfs in particular . 
  killing ah reaver with a nosegun is very easy right now , before it was a challenge . 
  if you just `` sit '' in a tank you will pretty soon be killed by another tank or an la. 
  because tank vs tank does n't require skill or is n't an `` even field '' , is that what you 're implying ? 
   most people who whine on reddit, 
  it is right there , in the fucking faq on the fucking official game site . 
  stop eating a cactus and move on , because vehicles are n't going anywhere . 
   you 'd see i never proposed for vehicles to be deleted, 
  well we 're talking about this supposedly godly streamer-guy and how devs should remake the game following his advice by tomorrow , right ? 
  you sure have done extensive surveys to support that claim . 
  most of my friends quit the game at early stages due to `` the guy kills me and receives no damage even though i hit him '' aka ha problem . 
   a wall of text about xvsi, 
   because ** tank vs tank ** does n't require skill or is n't an `` even field '' , is that what you 're implying ? 
  he 's a no-vehicle fps game player . 
  if he 'd given his input about ivi , i 'd totally listen . 
  what happens to those people when there 's a sudden gust of wind ? 
  i 'm sure you have it on your radar , ccp , but just to remind you :, 
  * insurance, 
  we need promised feature parity . 
  my point :, 
   likewise ps2 kiddies will find cs : go too hard because they ca n't sit in a max or a tank but instead actually have to play on an even field with others . 
  you do always play on even field whether as infantry or vehicles . 
  the field just changes from infantry to tanks to air . 
  inter-field relations are not supposed to be `` even '' . 
  because he 's in a wrong game . 
  him shouting `` delete vehicles '' does n't automatically become valid because of his cs or whatever experience . 
  what does this have to do with my point ? 
  you said that `` ps2 kiddies will find cs : go too hard '' implying they do n't have an `` even playing field '' while they are in a tank farming infantry . 
  but they do , and that field is tank vs tank . 
  and it depends on their skill , how well they do in that field , as well as within any other field . 
  since you asked , in your case , i will simply accept a defeat and move on . 
  or pull a mossie and try and take out your force multipliers . 
  i do hate zergs though ( real 96 + vs 40 ppl zerging ) . 
  i 'm not sure whether any kind of incentives will help break that behaviour down though . 
  how many vehicles is enough vehicles ? 
  looking at him , shouting about tanks while sitting under a biolab - the answer seems to be `` none or close to none '' . 
  oh wow my precious kd , whatever will i do about it to make my life complete ? 
  i did answer your question . 
  the `` mechanic '' you pointed out is fine and it 's called `` a defeat . '', 
   having fun kills the game . 
  you heard it here first . 
  that 's fun ? 
  the last time i did that i fell asleep . 
   there is no limit on force multipliers . 
  what should it be is what i 'm asking . 
  and i 'm one of those people . 
  maxes were * broken bullshit though since they have benefits of both infantry and vehicles . 
  \\* -- did n't play against or with maxes after charge removal so ca n't really comment about current situation . 
  dude , you 're on fucking point , every time :d, 
   this is exact type of gameplay ggg should be trying to avoid . 
  running through packs expecting them all the auto-die . 
  stop running into screens of `` can not die '' mobs . 
  well , if you did log out you would n't have to write the comment i 'm replying to , so ... 
  high clock , 4 cores ( not threads ) . 
  mine is 4770k @ 4.4 ghz . 
  i downvoted this post and every other post that refers to this guy as an absolute ps2 truth . 
  and at the same time i think tr is up and is often doubleteamed on my server . 
  infantryside have found their god . 
  wow ur dumb, 
  jita node is n't even unique anymore ( at least according to the tq t3 devblog ) . 
  they replaced the custom built ` everest ' node by 6 nodes using the top server cpus . 
  see [ the mah\u0101lang\u016br him\u0101l ] ( https://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/tranquility-tech-3/ ) section . 
  server hardware does n't get toasty . 
  it 's located in a strictly ventilated and temperature controlled room and has very fast noisy fans to pump cold air though heatsinks that is then immediately taken out of the room to a/c units . 
  edit : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prhd5vtjpz4, 
  edit : that said , it 's always interesting to see utilization and some profiling data from a big fight . 
  i too thought these were not the best but after some compares on ark.intel.com , they do seem the best combination of clock , cores and cache . 
  he is the real one , all of us others are alts . 
  ### [ ** stop killing yourself ** ] ( / intensifies ), 
  remove those values from client files and get them directly from the server via tls or similar mitm protected channel . 
  eve is actually more or less single threaded due to python gil , at least to my knowledge . 
  moral of the story : do n't just introduce your favourite fotm tech ( which python was at the time , i think ) into what can become a high load system ( looking at you , js ) . 
   oh , there 's loads of ways around that limitation . 
  trust me , i break it all the time , often times to detrimental effect !, 
  yeah , i should 've made a note there to not quote me on that since my knowledge is largely based on pretty old ccp presentations . 
  he was n't looking , he readjusted the camera so that he could hide in the container he was sitting in and just poke the camera out . 
  he did take cover .

  wow rude, 
  wow salty, 
  did somebody shit on your sandcastle ? 
  do n't be sad , it happens . 
  but rude :(, 
   i see the new ceo from columbus nova is in full effect . 
  actually ... 
  were n't new `` anime '' ns weapons announced roughly in october , at the same time the new ceo took effect ? 
  this feels really like a tinfoil cashgrab now . 
  cue mlg has telling you this is not a `` legal '' exploit .
