  best diplomacy comes in 1400mm caliber rounds . 
  it 's actually more consistent now , primary - secondary - tool - consumable - deployables , across all classes . 
  you 'll get used to it . 
  also mousewheel for weapons is n't good but whatever . 
  i dislike that guy 's attitude , but he 's right , your carbine and general stats are n't good . 
  i usually mainly look at headshot % since it does n't depend on playstyle and increases your chances in fights dramatically . 
  idk honestly , if you look at [ my stats ] ( http://stats.dasanfall.com/ps2/player/endeavour ) i was pretty atrocious at this until i got and auraxed trac-shot and started playing with smgs . 
  then it kind of `` clicked '' for me . 
  i think i also reduced my sensitivity at that time by like 50 % . 
  and just stated to care more about what i 'm doing , tried no to play while tired , that sort of thing . 
  i 'm always incredulous at comments like these . 
  you 've got an amazingly beautiful country to explore just sitting right there . 
  you can do all sorts of outdoor stuff from casual to dangerous . 
  you have most/all of europe within 4h of train/2h of plane travel . 
  as someone sitting right now in the middle of russian nowhere having nothing but an ugly city surrounded by empty plains i just do n't get how people can complain like that . 
  also your winter comment is cute , 
  on reddit , i always click save and then proofread and edit . 
   you 're literally so arrogant as to assume that loyalty to you the bombers bar should outweigh loyalty to your alliance . 
  did the guy you 're replying to said anything about loyalty though ? 
  he just said the guy should n't 've joined an npsi fleet if he has some kind of family `` code '' . 
  i mean awoxing can be fun and all but your point is kinda weird here , making a martyr or something . 
  sorry to hijack but let me remind everyone :, 
  \\ ^ \\ ^ \\ ^ this is why dailies sucked \\ ^ \\ ^ \\ ^, 
  with this i entirely agree . 
  sc2 hots in which tempest was introduced entered beta in september 2012 . 
  ps2 entered beta in november 2012 . 
  sc2 liberator is n't even anything like ps2 liberator . 
  op is a dumbo . 
  connection quality refers to packet loss , not latency . 
  and packet loss is a lot worse than high latency . 
  just mute aura . 
  * real * aura is dead anyway . 
  i have 75mbps with no limits in central russia and that 's not even the best available option , speed-wise . 
  i find it funny how this is / r/futurology material for some people . 
  `` big country '' my ass . 
  let 's take an arbitrary siberian shithole like [ achinsk ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/achinsk,+krasnoyarsk+krai,+russia/@56.2575442,90.4260531,12z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x5cd4e12fbc6b51cd:0x21ab9d7b6c23edcf!8m2!3d56.2372447!4d90.4888916?shorturl=1 ) : 100k population , deep between urals and lake baikal , 2 + hours of [ driving ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/dir/''/krasnoyarsk+\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u044f\u0440\u0441\u043a/@55.8434755,90.6980993,8z/am=t/data=!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x5cd4e12fbc6b51cd:0x21ab9d7b6c23edcf!2m2!1d90.4903153!2d56.2360841!1m5!1m1!1s0x5cd7afc9a1ff37e3:0xd597e1468fd647ff!2m2!1d92.8932476!2d56.0152834 ) from the regional capital . 
  now let 's look up some internet providers . 
  [ one ] ( http://www.achinsk.net/pages/internet.html ) , seems to be locally based , offers 50mbps ( 100 in night time ) for 900 rub/month ( 15 usd ) . 
  [ another ] ( http://www.ttk.ru/rus/achinsk/customers/105008/105380/ ) , country-wide , offers even more lucrative 50mbps for 390rub/month ( whopping 7 usd ) , although i 'd expect some potential issues with local availability . 
  so you see , big country does n't mean too much , especially when you consider population density . 
  the truth is , america 's isps just suck total ass and milk their customers for every last cent possible while providing shitty services . 
  edit : reposted with unshortened urls because apparently g o o . 
  g l is untrustworthy . 
  report for harassment and move on . 
  why are you literally feeding a troll ? 
  why would i go and look at something disgusting , much less interact with it ? 
  you ca n't take cover from a max . 
  esfs can not go inside buildings . 
  edit : fuck off with your biolab esfs . 
  biolabs are not buildings ( they are structures containing buildings ) and you 're useless in there anyway . 
   dedicated esf pilots in general are cancer, 
  no u, 
   you fail to realize that there is nothing else to do to hornet esfs . 
  av weapon does good at av ? 
  fyi , in your last [ 1000 kills/deaths ] ( http://ps2.fisu.pw/killboard/?name=pcstrat ) you 've been killed by hornets a whopping 3 times . 
  this is your hourly g2a circlejerk thread , stand by for more !, 
  do n't be choked on airpads like a noob . 
  what does that have to do with being in an airpad choke when you can go through a teleporter like a good player ? 
  properly placed sundy spawns you almost into teleporter entrance room . 
  be ready to go full potato mode though , to make the game actually render that much fps . 
  just look into this guy 's threads : / u/ps2stophack, 
  last video showcases autospot and hitbox mods . 
  huh , i always thought apples turning dark is caused by iron going from +2 to +3 oxidation state . 
  is that entirely unrelated and the color change is all due to quinone formation ? 
   a liberator with the tank buster can just sneak up on any tank/ground vehicle, 
  if the game sounds were n't broken this would n't be a thing . 
   the only few different options i see now are `` enable multithreading '' - which the game should do by itself , i do n't know why that 's even an option to turn off, 
  multithreading is optional because it does n't perform well on all configurations . 
  if it did n't turn on for you by default it 's probably because you have a dual core cpu . 
  which says ... * something * . 
  4770k , multithreading is still enabled by default after deleting the setting from the config file . 
  i like it the way it is right now . 
  use a hotkey for something used as often as a fitting window . 
  `` uncontested esf meets an infantry ball . 
  you wo n't believe what happens next ! '', 
  the session change was always there . 
  it was removed for swapping ships in stations and outposts a while ago , but since in citadels , apparently , your ship is still `` in space '' while docked , swapping causes a session change . 
  what you get for this is near-instant undocking from citadels , compared to stations and outposts . 
  now you may ~ ~ disperse ~ ~ ignore this logical explanation and continue to rant as if ccp killed your newborn . 
  c t r l, 
  ctrl-space to stop instead of clicking . 
  may have saved him a second . 
  why should they ? 
  or are you talking about those heavies that choose to whine about vehicles instead of countering them with their own vehicles ? 
   also , composite armor is great , it just depends on circumstances . 
  especially for tanking that one extra ap round . 
  ram filled with crap that an app is too lazy to clean up is wasted in an even worse way . 
  edit : downvoted by clueless who think that any ram consumption is useful . 
  except like ... work ? 
   i miss old opera ... 
  psst !, 
  look at / r/vivaldibrowser . 
  idk , he clicked the '' - '' on his screen though . 
  what teamspeak overlay is that ? 
  i more or less agree with everything except the locking benefit having little influence . 
  i clearly remember how miller zergfits would fight over hossin back when it gave 50 % off maxes . 
  i really hated it back then because zergfits and terrain bottlenecks do n't work together well as you can imagine ... 
   they can just hornet them from an extreme height where the mbt 's ca n't do anything one at a time . 
  spread out a bit , find an incline , oneshot esfs . 
  if tanks are sitting on top of each other then yeah , they probably wo n't have an angle .
