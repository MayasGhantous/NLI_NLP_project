  but it takes just one tank being at a small-ish distance from others for esf 's attacks to become exponentially dangerous . 
  why are you replying to me with this ? 
  of course that 's a valid tactic unless you consider using an easy-oneshot-titan-ap somehow `` invalid '' . 
  in fact , that it is tuned exactly to oneshot esfs suggests that it is one of intended uses . 
  i could also suggest using aa secondaries but people ( including me ) wo n't do that anyway since it 's better to specialize against other tanks . 
  vulnerability to air is the price we pay for that . 
  yet 3 mbts with aa secondaries would be utterly unattackable by 3 esfs . 
   dance around, 
  you mean eat flak , lockons and ap shells . 
  \\  memory management ... c, 
  \\  multiple inheritance, 
  looks like d3 . 
  with my kotor experience that thing probably channels and focuses the force lore-wise . 
  that will get mbt into burning now . 
  it was changed at the same time hornets were buffed because nobody used them . 
   get back into cover, 
  i have a feeling that those mlg guys who rage the most at a2g esfs have no idea that cover is a 100 % counter against one . 
   found the vehicle main . 
  so basically your only `` argument '' is a personal attack ? 
  wow you 're so elite , may i have a privilege of sucking your balls , dude ? 
  but seriously , how much fucking self-importance do you feel because of your elite role in this game ? 
  hornets definitely were buffed at least once . 
  i ca n't remember if that coincided with the pods vs mbt change . 
  [ here , found it ] ( https://forums.daybreakgames.com/ps2/index.php?threads/update-notes-june-19th.190316/ ), 
  ** esf changes **, 
  we are making adjustments to esf rocket pods and hornet missiles to both better define them and allow the liberator to stand out more as anti-vehicle . 
  rocket pods will be receiving a direct hit damage reduction that will lower its effectiveness against vehicles . 
  we are adjusting it so that it will take 1 full volley of rockets ( no misses ) to the rear of an mbt will place it in critical damage instead of destroying it . 
  * * damage decreased from 475 to 400, 
  * reaver, 
  * * damage decreased from 635 to 550, 
  * * damage decreased from 550 to 475, 
  hornet missiles will be receiving a direct damage increase . 
  this increase will make hornet missiles more effective against vehicles than rocket pods in certain situations . 
  * damage increased from 1800 to 2000, 
  as i said , they were buffed at the same time rocket pods were nerfed against tanks because nobody used them ( hornets ) at the time . 
  i thought casinos were now banned by eula . 
  how does this meme-name make sense ? 
  nice infantryside update . 
  lol @ hornets getting their values reduced *** way *** below what they were at release . 
  ... not a single shot was fired while airborn in that clip . 
  of ones that mattered anyway . 
   medkits cut down on the amount of time before you can effectively reengage . 
  a lot of people think that removing them will be good , in reality it 'll just make players play passively and create boring fights . 
  yes , just conveniently forget that resto kits exist and pretend medkids are totally not abused . 
  edit : nice ~ ~ arguments ~ ~ downvotes you got there , really informative . 
  i still do n't understand when and why reddit became buttmad about kitey ships . 
  they were popular and used all the time i played eve , for 7 years now . 
  edit : nice explanation via downvotes , your point is finely conveyed . 
   this a2g player seems like he would argue that it does n't go away at 50m , with video of him using thermals to pick out and massacre planetmans en masse up close as his supporting argument . 
  any kind of g2a would 've shredded him at that distance . 
  if you watch closely his entire esf hp was removed by * uncoordinated * small arms fire . 
  additionally , every moron on the ground there is oblivious to esfs presense , *** even after the banshee 's sound *** . 
  how dumb must you be to not run for cover when hearing that ? 
  how dumb is that guy shooting him with a carbine and going for the door * only when shot at * ? 
  god damn , this made me irrationally angry !, 
  dumb fucks like those , whining their way into vehicle overnerfs . 
  using that video as some kind of proof that a2g is op is retarded . 
  anything and everything is op when it is not opposed in any kind of way . 
   thermals are overperforming, 
  wtf does that even mean ? 
  what kind of inflation are you talking about when there are no real market and no real universal money value ? 
  at least show us an example of those microtransactions being `` injected in your eyeballs '' if that 's your main raging point . 
  `` he mbts are under powered . '', 
  how about this ? 
   so you jump in turn on mwd and cloak, 
  cloak and * then * mwd a second later !, 
  you may stop your ship though !, 
  this post seems to be hidden from the sub now . 
  why , mods ? 
  it 's pretty cool , i liked it . 
  this is the reason i temp unsubbed from this sub again ( too much shit on my frontpage ) . 
  brs , propaganda and chestbeating are good but in moderate quantities . 
  test guys seem to not understand this . 
  would be interesting to see most deadly zones for hc and standard separately ( i assume shown stats are include both ) . 
  claymore 's restricted damage cone can be crossed way faster than other mines that have 360 aoe . 
  a ) is `` solo hike to x '' not enough of a `` statement '' ? 
  because it 's kinda hard to cram more into link-post title . 
  what more do you need to write there anyway ? 
  b ) does me posting my hiking video hosted on ( obviously ) my youtube channel also count as self promotion ? 
  the guy 's channel is just videos of him travelling , he does n't even have monetising ads on them . 
  surely it is allowed to share videos of one 's experiences in switzerland here ? 
  great summary of this abomination of a change . 
  right . 
  you stole from `` xxdeath '' ess but somehow a synergy of steel guy responds to you . 
  just mute her . 
  aura is dead . 
  i wonder what that is . 
  exactly . 
  not `` xxdeath '' . 
   go play bf1 hardcore . 
  i actually will , tyvm . 
  it also runs and looks better then this piece of crap . 
   so rocket pods need to be nerfed . 
  that 's fine . 
  just remove all vehicles now and save everyone the trouble . 
   you ca n't underestimate noseguns on esf 's . 
  you can outrepair them ffs . 
   the ess belongs to xxdeath , xxdeath rat there , go up there and check teh structure yerself if you care so much about semantics . 
  since ratting space is divided between alliances i find it hard to believe that a syn pilot could contribute 23m into xix ess .
