  chromium 's ram consumption is absolutely unacceptable but hey , they 're practically a monopoly so they get away with it . 
  idk , i can see where they are coming from but it seems like another shitty grey area . 
  vector : : operator [ ] is constant time since it 's just a wrapper for [ pointer arithmetic ] ( http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector ) . 
  yeah , in 7 days they 'll probably want to explore the canton and maybe neighbouring ones . 
  module activations seems to be somewhat broken . 
  no way i 've activated cloak ( either t1 or covert ) only 2 times in the whole year , same for sebos . 
  so , did be actually close the browser by itself ? 
  or did it just report blocking something browser-related from accessing the game process ? 
  you can never blame the player for playing within the game rules , really . 
  for instance , i 've never blamed a2a lockon users . 
  i did get sadder and sadder while that thing was allowed by the game rules for years . 
  so , did using an unsupported port of a macos concurrency library pay off in the long run ? 
  it felt like a questionable decision throughout the post . 
  half the world 's backend , including highload systems , is in java ; it 's perfectly acceptable to write a server in it , great even . 
  java has no problems doing all kinds of concurrency and multithreading and it is jit-compiled and optimized very efficiently , often as efficiently as directly-compiled languages ( like c/c + + ) . 
  the reasons minecraft runs badly are : a ) gc pauses b ) inefficient jni calls for opengl access . 
  using namespace std ;, 
  int main ( ) {, 
  string s ;, 
  system ( `` pause '' ) ;, 
  return 0 ;, 
   press any key to continue . 
  sounds like you fucked your hdd using virtual box and ubuntu installer as tools . 
  i 'm regularly using virtual box to test random linux distros on my windows 8.1 machine . 
  regardless , using footprint as a metric like this is pretty stupid since it always will be more for objects than raw pointers . 
  and jdk devs really care about footprint of core classes , see [ this ] ( https://shipilev.net/#string-catechism ) for example . 
  edit : and the [ next one ] ( https://shipilev.net/#lord-of-the-strings ) for more in depth string footprint details . 
  they do n't even have to make the app . 
  there 's a [ standard protocol ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/time-based_one-time_password_algorithm ) for generating one-time passwords on a user device . 
  an app like [ google authenticator ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2 ) can be used to generate them . 
  not even bugs , just delays in command execution . 
  that 's not evolution . 
  that 's illiterates writing sounds into two words that make no sense put together . 
   dynamics of la duels, 
  you mean `` you pressed space - get fucked '' `` dynamics ? '', 
  nice dynamics where a mobility based class gets fucked by random unpredictable players while using its main movement ability . 
  no , i mean how it was before . 
   yeah , pressing f and jumping around pressing 4-click continuously is top tier skill . 
  wow edgy, 
  not really , no . 
  but you 're free to live in your dream world and spout edginess like a true internet hero . 
  i wonder how sad your mom 's basement is for you to keep making these meaningless comments . 
  so wow allows you to record in 1080p@60 now , got it . 
  looks nice but still has some excessive ( imo ) sliding at some points ( like 0:58 -1:04 ) . 
  serious question : are real tanks actually able to slide sideways or drift on non-slippery ( icy ) surfaces ? 
  because i think not but i have no idea really . 
  i know people who would 've bought a name change , if the name they wanted was n't taken by a character last logged in 2013 . 
  it does n't help with 4 cores 8 threads too . 
  the idea is retarded since ps2 easily consumes 60 % of my 4770k@4.6ghz ( that is 60 % of 8 threads ) . 
  if it works then something else is probably broken or outdated on your system ( i 'm running windows 8.1 latest updates ) . 
  yes but green would be misleading imo . 
  a lot of `` simpler '' aromatic compounds like benzene can permeate skin and accumulate in the body . 
  many of them are also strong carcinogens/mutagens . 
  there is probably a whole bunch of them in used motor oil . 
  that 's not how probability and random events work . 
  frequent exposure will increase your chances . 
  so will acute full-body exposure . 
  synthetic oil itself consists mostly of quite stable , chemically unreactive and biologically inert compounds . 
  after use it has all kinds of shit dissolved . 
  fish do n't love . 
   log your internet searchs, 
  encryption ? 
  if the certificate is replaced by a self-signed or otherwise inappropriate certificate your browser will notify you about it with big red letters . 
  if a secret of a certificate was leaked or a wrong certificate was issued by a ca that certificate will be revoked/disabled either by the owner , ca or users who care about their security . 
  i do n't know how you can talk about tls as a broken design when the whole world uses it for private communication channels . 
  first , ssl is outdated and considered insecure by now . 
  properly set up tls has no working attacks against it , as i understand . 
  even though some configurations are susceptible to attacks of varying severity it 's not a reason to call the whole protocol/design broken . 
  yet , anyway . 
  if/when it become broken the world wo n't end and a new technology simply will be invented , just look at how many cipher/hash algorithms we 've went through , it 's just an evolution process . 
  since this whole comment chain is about an isp 's ability to gather data on its users ' searches , i encourage you to show an example of a successful reliable mitm attack on a request to google.com . 
  i do n't know of any such attack so i deem tls secure at least for this purpose . 
  all connections to google are automatically redirected to https , search engines embedded in browsers use https by default . 
  no query data including url parts can be extracted from encrypted stream . 
  why has n't it been embedded into it though ? 
  on linux ( ubuntu 14.04 , mint kde 18.1 ) it works even worse and tries to paste the url of the dragged tab into desktop or the app you 're dragging it into . 
  sometimes i ca n't drag a tab out at all and resort to context menu . 
  not to mention that after a year + the browser still randomly crashes on dragging any content , including tabs . 
  is anyone even working on reproduction and a fix for this ? 
  what 's wrong in shooting targets shooting at you in a pvp game ? 
  / u/bburness, 
  it would be ... good , if tanks would n't be susceptible to bullshit like this with their new handling . 
  is there a source for that ? 
  i was asking about your corruption claim . 
  nice doublethink . 
  it 's not like majority of eve players ( including me ) use inverse of this exact logic when promoting the game . 
  `` we 're really cutthroat in the game but most of us are nice guys . '', 
  `` we only look like sociopaths in the game because that 's what it 's like . '', 
  it 's pretty much in any eve thread for normies . 
  trying to apply someone 's behaviour in game ( on game forums ) to someone 's irl identity is something out of a first-time ganked wow player 's mindset . 
  \\  hit half a map worth of mobs with a single spell, 
  \\  complain about game engine, 
  well , we could go ahead and reduce the amount of targets you can hit at the same time by nerfing the shit out of projectiles , vaalspark etc etc. 
  how would you like that mechanic ? 
  not much ? 
  oh , i 'm sorry , the `` do any user 's demand '' cpus are n't here yet . 
  i used to easily cause d3 instances to lag and dc just by pulling more than 2-3 screens of mobs with a cm wizard . 
  edit : example of what it looked like http://i.imgur.com/uvatbn5.png, 
  `` the game '' is now responsible for your logout macros ? 
  lol,
