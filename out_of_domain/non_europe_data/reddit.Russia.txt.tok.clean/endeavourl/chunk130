  the game has nothing to do with `` kicking in '' your logout macro . 
  current logout macro works by sending tcp disconnect packet . 
  the game client does n't have to be running properly for it to work . 
  i wonder who 's the next guy to shit on will be now that pt has left , because it seems that this community just ca n't go on without one . 
   to prevent impersonation/obfuscation exploits , upwell structure names can no longer include unicode characters.\u02d9s\u0183u\u0131\u0265\u0287 \u01dd\u0254\u0131u \u01dd\u028c\u0250\u0265 \u0287 , u\u0250\u0254 no\u028e \u028e\u0265\u028d s\u0131 s\u0131\u0265 \u22a5, 
  awwww :(, 
  well then hijacking and looting were my main occupations at one point . 
  ( i 'm a peaceful guy who likes classical music and have n't hit anyone in the past 10 years . ), 
  this sub is like a daily reminder of why i do n't want to play this game . 
  \\  new, 
  \\  secret, 
  \\  cool, 
  it is an exploit of their shitty engine . 
  their stance on it stems from their inability to fix it but does n't change its nature : it 's a bug that has an exploit . 
  ... almost 2 years ago . 
  kill the sound or make it less creepy . 
  everything else works fine . 
  or maybe they want feedback from bigger part of community . 
  and giving you a clue that this is a good time to give it before they remove the old system . 
  i want those sounds to remain on though . 
  the dscan one is just too loud , creepy and unnerving . 
  and it happens too often for obvious reasons . 
   unicode characters are `` higher '' characters than alphanumeric ones . 
  that means grandfathered names containing unicode characters first will always appear higher up on the right click menu than alphanumeric . 
  err ... no . 
  [ gcc 5.4.0 20160609 ] on linux, 
  type `` help '' , `` copyright '' , `` credits '' or `` license '' for more information . 
  i just tried , it 's the same story . 
  especially considering they use python as well and probably do n't use custom sort . 
  anyway , just look at the unicode codepoints , latin1 is right at the start . 
  is there a site that shows buy/sell volume separately ? 
  you already can reverse-redeem plex . 
  i did n't use that `` feature '' at all , not a single time , because i do n't need another source of frustration in this game . 
  this . 
  with new postprocessing turning down brightness like a quarter made it look better . 
  that sounds like a dumb fucking rule written in a dumb fucking place . 
  buying just before supply is supposed to go up does sound like a good investment . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ not, 
  i wonder how this is enforced if the person does n't stream themselves doing it . 
  how can they possibly enforce this ? 
  it never makes sense to create rules one can not reliably enforce . 
  how is this `` ea '' ? 
  they 're simply merging currencies one of which should n't 've existed in the first place . 
  * whole thousands of euro !, 
  dozens of thousands even !, 
  `` let 's screw our customers over and gain those juicy thousands of usd !, 
  it 's not like we 're making millions in profit , right ? '', 
  that totally happened . 
  that thread is not tos . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.pathofexile.com/legal/terms-of-use-and-privacy-policy ) is tos . 
  how the fuck is a random thread at the bottom of the forums even legally binding in any way ? 
  some people , including me , were not even aware of this `` rule 's '' existence . 
  who told you they ca n't afford to hire more staff ? 
  are you personally ready to develop a game on a rock in the middle of northern atlantic ? 
  i never saw this amount of dumb baseless accusations , unfounded hearsay and rumours of the end of the word in this sub . 
  \\  not using scanner hotkeys in 2017, 
  i remember how players whined back then , that ccp only made plex movable to cash in on all those killmails with it destroyed . 
  now players whine because plex will no longer be destroyed . 
  / o \\ * this sub and being level-headed * / o \\, 
  i would actually buy that . 
  with the `` old '' voice ofc . 
  same in russia . 
  i guess they 're trying to make it into a kind of trademark . 
  it 's a shame because i love w\u00fcrzig cheese and it seems it does n't exist here :(, 
  ebay ships me most of the stuff for free ffs . 
  mostly from china but i recently ordered from us with $ 1 shipping . 
  edit : i got it , shipping from china is subsidised by their govt . 
  my examples are of orders from us to russia though . 
  you beat me to posting this . 
  it 's also sometimes called `` acetic essence . '', 
  i do n't have a bottle on hand right now but i do n't remember any special warnings listed on it , except maybe about eye danger and undiluted consumption danger . 
  it does stink but i do n't think it 's too bad as long as you do n't try to inhale its mist or something . 
  here in russia it 's sold usually as vinegar substitute that you can use in smaller volumes and/or make solutions with concentration/volume you need for the thing you 're baking or something . 
  it 's almost like you can get this done and enjoy almost-free income for the rest of the year and more . 
  i hated snipers before it was cool . 
  `` hurr i hit you for half your hp with no skill involved while sitting cloaked in the middle of nowhere . '', 
  i do n't have a problem with skilled headshotters but getting 3 random legshots from 3 different skilless snipers is irritating . 
  i decided to be a cool kid and bought [ this mount ] ( https://www.amazon.de/monitor-bildschirm-halterung-philips-panasonic/dp/b00809yexm/ ) . 
  bonus : entire table is free , works well with wireless mouse/kb . 
  i would n't be surprised if ( the first iteration of ) player-made stargates would replace them . 
  who the fuck does n't want to be in a sacrilege/legion fleet ? 
  at least it was n't as ugly and had style . 
  current one is just a gray block : /, 
  holy shit , it actually looks like tank handling . 
  because javascript :(, 
  even on 4.4 ghz i7 some actions like opening a tab/window feel sluggish . 
  worse on the work computer , which is stock 3ghz i5 with integrated video , also running linux which means that gpu acceleration is :, 
  a ) generally pretty slow/sometimes buggy due to intel drivers, 
  b ) entirely unavailable for video decoding ( hardcoded in chromium for all linux with no ability to turn it back on ) . 
  itt , people do n't know what a shockwave may look like . 
  other ui sounds add a feeling of responsiveness to it and are n't too intrusive . 
  these new though ... :(, 
  you can use [ stylish extension ] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish-custom-themes-for/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog ) to enable voting on all subreddits . 
  i personally think it 's stupid that it is allowed to hide the buttons .
