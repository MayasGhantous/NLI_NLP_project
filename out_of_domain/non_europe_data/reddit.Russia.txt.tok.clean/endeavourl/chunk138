  did they move [ those changes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjzfy3p0ahu ) to live or are these some other changes ? 
  burness ' video looked good . 
  where did you people get the idea that sinks were removed ? 
   our secondary goal is that carriers and supercarriers are too effective in pvp , even for the investment it takes to create them . 
  this change will shift the pvp balance , but we 're confident that carriers and supercarriers will remain powerful options for pvp battles . 
  edit : downvoted for providing a word-for-word quote . 
  and that 's different how ? 
  to make this even simpler , as a logi , that 's different how ? 
  entosis is great because it allows systems to change hands quickly in case the owner abandons them . 
  i remember grinding through regions of abandoned dominion sov and that shit was awful . 
  what needs to change about entosis is the vulnerability of the entosing ship . 
  early new-sov devblogs outlined one requirement for it , and it was necessity of grid control to complete the objective . 
  current sov fails this requirement due to entosing ship being vulnerable to griffins , inty fleets etc. 
  go reinforce an entire region of ihubs sprinkled with some outposts , protected by defensive sbus . 
  ehp does n't leave an option for a single person to reinforce a structure , provided no resistance , so that whole constellations could be reinforced simultaneously . 
  with ehp you always need some kind of a fleet to grind the structures one-by-one . 
  you can get fleet combat with entosis even now , and it can be even better with some tweaking and fixing of entosing ship vulnerability issue i mentioned . 
  there is nothing in entosis that restricts fleet combat . 
  entosis solves the problem of huge swaths of abandoned space that is pita to grind through , because every player capable of using entosis can reinforce a whole structure , and that greatly speeds up the process of reclaiming abandoned space . 
  and problem of abandoned space is very real since wars usually end when only several key systems fall . 
  after that its all about reclaiming that space for yourself with little to no resistance . 
  what if entosing ship could n't be jammed/killed by an uncatchable frigate fleet ? 
  thus making control of the grid with a real combat fleet a necessity and forcing those combat fleets to fight for grid control . 
  would you like it then ? 
  because i think this is perfectly achievable with entosis while keeping its advantages over ehp based structures ( see my other comment chain here ) . 
   these fucks can go take a flying leap off a cliff or into eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull, 
  along with fozzie amirite ? 
  i wonder why any ccper still visits this sub when you fuckers post indirect death threats here . 
   but people sure are annoyed by ccp repeatedly telling us that `` they cost so much only because it 's so much effort to make one for a single hull '' . 
  source ? 
  so the `` problem '' exist only in your sick imagination , got it . 
  replacing aurum with plex is what ccp did , thus removing redundant currency . 
  why are you mad about it ? 
  so ... you 're dumb and ca n't divide by 500 i guess ? 
  sorry to break it down for you , but if 3rd grade math like simple division is too hard for you you might actually be retarded . 
   its not a death threat . 
  not even indirect . 
  wow , not a death threat , only telling them to go kill themselves , now that 's subtle !, 
   they are taking steps that are against what the community wants, 
  examples ? 
   they ignore us and bring on people from ea specializing in micro transactions and pr, 
  wow they must be literally hitler then . 
  we have different definitions of being polite . 
  and if you want them to fuck off do n't be surprised when they do so and stop communicating beyond official devblogs . 
  like most gamedev companies do i might add . 
   all it said was shifty words, 
  what he said is called `` acknowledging the issue . '', 
  might be too high level for you though . 
   then you can then manipulate the stats to show whatever you want . 
  maybe it 's time to stop behaving like ccp is out to get you personally and accept the necessity of balance changes ? 
  wow rude, 
   and use the rest to take over the forest encampment, 
  and eramir warns you that this may happen after you helped a bandit . 
  nice touch . 
   you can just form fozzieclaws or svipuls and speed around popping entosis ships, 
   it can be even better with some tweaking and fixing of entosing ship vulnerability issue i mentioned, 
  did you read anything i wrote here ? 
   atm , enforcers are going for 1.5 b per . 
  you think the price will hold ? 
  literally hitler, 
   oh fights over, 
   6h fatigue, 
  that was a terrible fight if you had to jump back immegiately after jumping in . 
  \\  what are isk faucets, 
  about 2 hubs per 6 months . 
  it does for me right now . 
  adjusting volume in skype is the same as adjusting it in system . 
  even with auto-adjustment disabled volume slider in skype acts on system 's volume . 
   unfortunately , there 's no special story behind the $ 40 . 
  just a regular old gank while trying to move 11 skill extractors that 'd i 'd just bought one hop over from jita to perimeter to sell . 
  shit did n't even drop for the ganker . 
  but i 'd just sent $ 40 to ccp for plex , bought the skill extractors with the plex , and then poof they were gone . 
  fuck it . 
  have you tried getting gud ? 
  also , accepting stuff is accepting stuff . 
  use ` javaw ` instead of ` java ` . 
  on windows the latter launches console mode applications .

  idk about osha but here in russia every vehicle like that has multiple [ `` do n't stand under the boom/load '' ] ( https://prv1.lori-images.net/nadpis-na-kabine-krana-ne-stoi-pod-streloi-0003449405-preview.jpg ) labels printed on them . 
  '' \u0421\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u0430 '' usually means `` arrow '' but in construction it means crane arm and stuff like that . 
  machs do n't get bombed ? 
  none of those channels are live i think . 
  just for the fact that iss does n't have a permanent hd video downlink in all areas . 
  their video also repeats after a while . 
  amazingly detailed and accurate !, 
  cashback on themed-purchases does n't sound like rmt to me . 
  people can pay for a sub , you know . 
  it have n't changed in price ever and it 's cheaper than plex . 
  literally anything . 
  cashbacks are offered for purchases in supermarket or gas station chains for example . 
  there 's literally no mention of ingame items anywhere so idk where you get your rmt claim from . 
  balance team : `` nah just slap a ` more effectiveness to linked `` more '' multipliers on it . ' '', 
  tfw majority of your web traffic is encrypted thanks to tls . 
   if you wan na read mods on mobs go play a pen and paper game, 
  if you wan na play a running simulator game go play poe in 2017 . 
  am i correct to assume that virtual photons are used to describe scattering and real ones are for light/electron energy transitions ? 
   [ skillpoints have been reimbursed at the standard rate of 40 skillpoints for every minute ] ( https://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/eve-online-news/skill-queue-issue-reimbursement-complete/ ), 
  also dragging tabs still works pretty badly on linux , and usually just drops tab url/link on desktop/wherever it was dragged to . 
   freaking out is unwarranted,
