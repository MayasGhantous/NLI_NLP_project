  also entire a3 . 
  i wonder how exactly is this a ` bug exploitation ' and not just bad town design , assuming he only dragged mobs from the old road to the town and didnt exploit some real bugs . 
  while it is sad to die this way, 
  a ) the pking is withing game mechanics , and in town too - if those dumb mechanics allow you to pk there . 
  b ) if you see a dumb mechanic in your 1yr old game , you dont ban people for using it and fix it instead . 
  c ) you shouldnt trust anyone on hc, 
  so while you can call him asshole and question his way of having fun he still played withing the game mechanics not breaking anything in any way . 
  again , assuming he didnt exploit a real bug . 
  edit : so if my assumption holds the decision is really a populist one , made to exact revenge for semi-large amount of players at expense of few and doesnt fix anything or make any justice . 
  you actually can , they closed only one doorway of two / o \\, 
  let me tell you about this game called eve online . 
  so amongst other things there 's a space system called jita , which happens to be the universe 's main trade hub . 
  jita is always full of people and having 1.5-2 .5 k people on average in it . 
  also those people share the system 's local chat channel . 
  so here 's the point : * every single message * in that chat is a scam designed to steal your money/assets in some clever way while you 're not paying attention to what you accept . 
  including `` i quit '' messages . 
  moral of the story : dont trust anyone . 
  edit : [ more on the topic ] ( http://massively.joystiq.com/2012/03/04/eve-evolved-five-scams-to-avoid/ ), 
  i dont know what you 're going to do with it but it 's not very useful outside of an alliance . 
  and if you 're gon na use it for alliance why did you bought it fully yourself ( well , probably because you 're spacerich ) . 
  blizzard spawns mobs in a3 town . 
  my friend died to shadown vermin in a3 armory ( part town ) because he forgot about it and went afk . 
  if they wanted a safe zone they should 've made a safe zone . 
  if there 's an open passage from wilderness to the town who decides when it 's legal to retreat to , say , the a1 inn and have the mobs in town , and when does this action become illegal ? 
  it 's very tricky and uncertain and when you make a special case for someone you 're only making the situation worse . 
  the only way is for devs to apologize for lost characters and install a damn door . 
  melee is overpowered and kiting sucks all because of the speed and dynamic-ness of the game ( not that i dont like it but it 's true ) . 
  well i guess you could ` fix ' it by making dh oneshot everything except bosses like archon wizards do . 
  but that 's not really fun without the need to keep archon up . 
  or give it spammable mitigation/control spells - and here you go , another ( melee ) cm wizard . 
  ty for the link :d, 
  kinda stopped playing it since my friends refused self found :(, 
  still plan on finishing inferno and playing once in a while . 
  what ? 
  yes , for one reason : economy reset . 
  * some * may argue that [ ashkenazy 's interpretation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?annotation_id=annotation_627520&amp;feature=iv&amp;p=3d3ab1402eeb1d8c&amp;src_vid=mwowb3xtfge ) is the best one . 
  i know there 's most probably a lot of drama but still all i can care about is ** beautiful laser shininess overload ** !, 
  you online an anchored sbu and it changes ownership . 
  was funny in 2010 , now ... meh . 
  um ... you havent seen shitty networking code then just saying . 
  you lose xp but dont go into previous level . 
  i 'd like this . 
   a flat amount could work , but a percentile loss is just way too much in higher plvls . 
  my monk is plvl 80 and he earns about half a bar a session . 
  even 1 % loss would be huge for me . 
  dont die then ? 
  it 's how it worked in d2 it 's how it works in poe . 
  leveling would require a little more than zero attention . 
  the easiest way to scale xp penalty is by doing - % . 
  otherwise penalty would be nothing or have to be manually adjusted for high plvls . 
  the flight control precision is probably the most fascinating thing to me . 
  [ shadoo rage best rage ] ( https://soundcloud.com/propogandasss/shadoo-fireline-rage ), 
  ctrl-space - stop ship, 
  ctrl-f9 - hide ui , leave graphics to see all beauty around you, 
  in general , ** take your time to look through settings ** people , odds are there 's that hotkey option you always wanted . 
  my d-scan window is set to ctrl-f10 for instance , i 'm very used to it . 
  ctrl-shift-q - i set to logout ( no need to manually restart ) . 
  etc , there 's a lot of useful customizable stuff . 
  should be tagged ` circlejerk ' really . 
  i do n't see a discussion . 
  looking at this i understand how much shit i havent yet done in eve , 
  if he 's still in omist closest npc spaces are curse and stain so ... yeah . 
  they are quite far away too . 
  omist is really one of those ` middle of ass-where ' regions . 
  if the difference between your clone and skillpoints is still small i 'd say self destruct ( also no expensive implants ) . 
  i 've only traveled to omist using jump bridges and/or capitals and cant imagine going from there to empire gate-by-gate in a pod . 
  * shudder * the chance to die this way is pretty high anyway . 
  edit : if you didnt know [ this ] ( http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/skills_guide#skill_points_and_being_podded ) is the way you lose sp when podded . 
  5 % of the sp-clone difference from your highest sp skill . 
  edit2 : great story btw !, 
  i was surprised at the moment you looked for a way out through a wh . 
  oh well , i rarely fly with a probe launcher fitted , not very used to that way of thinking . 
  yeah i think it 's that way and every other source tells it 's that way . 
  cant tell from experience though , i was never actually podded with an insufficient clone although i flew with one couple of times :p, 
  also dont forget to upgrade it if you 'll self destruct !, 
  i always liked them ... especially on capitals . 
   any non-ascii text shows up as blank, 
  i have this same issue . 
  i thought it was windows xp related , but seems like it 's not . 
  fyi , from my ( somewhat small ) experience june usually tends to be a rainy month in switzerland . 
  it 's hard to plan hikes when it rains every other day . 
  please correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  selling for usd ingame he obviously didnt learn some lessons . 
  i dont understand , what guilds are supposed to be in pve small-scale games ? 
  ( small-scale meaning number of people interacting within an instance ), 
  just a custom chat channel ? 
  what the fuck ? 
  i would 've never expected that to work in eve , a gm intervention ? 
  if they actually do it , does n't it kinda break the sandbox ? 
  maybe i should just move my thanatos out of drone regions then if it 's that easy and risk-free :\\, 
  edit : i just want to reiterate that gms moving ships from hostile stations is retarded and does n't fit into eve . 
  i 'm kinda dumbstruck . 
  you should do what you like . 
  try things . 
  pro-tip : do n't speak for everyone . 
  except , farming and getting items * is * the game , for the most part . 
  just `` having fun '' will only last so long . 
  what to play for when you already have insane level of gear ? 
  plus , as you mentioned , the difficulty will become negligible which will make you bored even faster . 
  in my opinion , it 's waste of money any way you look at it .
