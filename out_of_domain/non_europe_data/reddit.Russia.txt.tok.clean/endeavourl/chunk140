  the new `` spreadsheet '' meme :(, 
  dissolution and dissociation definitely can be chemical , like ionic compounds dissolving in water . 
  not sure how to classify metal and no-polar solutions . 
  sodium chlorate is a strong oxidizer and potentially explosive , as opposed to sodium chloride ( table salt ) . 
  yes , that 's his ( ex ) wife . 
  unfortunately , devs said it saves resources since same textures can be applied to both sides of the model . 
  i just hope they 'll keep * some * of the original unsymmetric designs at this point . 
  get your shitty whining and fuck off back to your shitty subreddit . 
  every server has their problems , but you never see eu servers shitting up the main sub with their drama . 
  population imbalance is a core game problem , existing on all servers . 
  recursion is a bunch of tryhard guys that nobody except 50 people on emerald cares about . 
  swt uses native ui library on each supported os . 
  everyone at work switched to idea and i 'm like `` whatever , eclipse works just fine for me '' \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
   null is also 0, 
  ** stop right there !, 
   it should throw an error lol . 
  but * muh coercions !, 
  by that logic i should be able to do ` ( * 0 ) = 1 ; ` since it 's perfectly fine in c. 
  having null castable to non-reference types in anything other than c is pointless , confusing and dangerous . 
  i 'm aware that there is a set of mental gymnastics exercises that js calls a specification that can explain every such example . 
  i just refuse to consider it sane . 
   you can . 
  also , that is n't an assignment operator . 
   var x = { value : 0 } ;, 
   x.value = 1 ;, 
  that is not a null pointer assignment which is what ` ( * 0 ) = 1 ; ` means in c. pointless operation , but at least it has a very clear outcome , unlike casting null to integers in a higher level language . 
   it uses a ` type ' object to do all its typing conversions . 
  some conversions just should n't be done for rules to remain sane . 
  i love to hate on js but this is correct behaviour . 
  what you can blame js for here is having all numbers represented as floats . 
  here 's [ a picture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9np6qpf.jpg ) of mine from a cunill tranquilo ( 60mm ) that has seen ~ 3-4kg of beans so far . 
  i needed to align the burrs ( see the unevenly painted spot ) so i had a picture handy . 
   no access to anti-air, 
  it 's not like a2g has been nerfed into the ground , not at all . 
  cover and movement has been in game since the launch too . 
  `` tranquilo ii '' comes with a doser , `` tranquilo '' with a simple chute , i own the latter . 
  it appears very reliable at its core but looks somewhat ugly with its plastic `` blobby '' casing . 
  also the burrs-to-chute duct retains quite a lot of grounds (  5g i think ) so i use a brush to scoop them out into the filter after every grind . 
  then i run the grinder again to also get out grounds from between the burrs ( i dose my beans every time so it does n't continue to grind more than i need ) . 
  mine came with [ misaligned burrs ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9np6qpf.jpg ) which was puzzling because i did n't know that could be a thing and it ground too coarse on the most fine setting . 
  i have learned about possible burr alignment problems in grinders since then and performed a co-planar alignment procedure using aluminium foil shims . 
  it did n't come out perfect but it finally achieved espresso grind and managed to choke my machine . 
  i 'm also thinking about modding the `` throat '' between burrs and hopper , narrowing it with a piece of silicon . 
  it has a ridge on which some of the dosed beans get stuck and alter the dose ground . 
  all in all , definitely worth it for the price , but you may need to do some mods or add some extra steps to your routine to get 0-retention for home espresso . 
  bug where dragging middle mouse button ( autoscrolling ) selects page contents still persists . 
  same version except 64bit , windows 8.1 . 
  by maximizing i mean clicking on the image to show it in full resolution . 
  when it does n't fit middle-dragging it does nothing now . 
  i have to admit , i was kinda lazy about that . 
  it seems that `` image properties '' blackout activates on some sites where it should n't . 
  tldr : teleporting * through ether * can actually take you through walls now . 
  so i did a few tests and came up with new teleport rules , they 're pretty simple :, 
  * you have to have a walking path to your destination, 
  * your destination must not be blocked ( i.e. 
  inside a wall ), 
  * if destination is too far it tries to teleport you maximum distance along the line between you and destination . 
  i made some graphical explanations too ( mad skillz inside ) :, 
  cases where you ** can ** tp :, 
  http://i.imgur.com/62nvikc.jpg ( works other way too ), 
  cases where you ** can not ** tp :, 
  http://i.imgur.com/5tfnzgg.jpg ( here you can actually tp in case there 's a gap between you and your blocked destination ), 
  i have to say this is one of the most pleasing changes this patch . 
  i do n't know if i enjoy more density changes and id all or actually teleporting through obstacles !, 
  edit : i found [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=lijylepfsbo&hd=1 ) which relays my emotions pretty accurately :d, 
  so there are no 22d and 1m options and replacing them with existing options yields 60 + % more price . 
  is there any way to get unlimited traveling for 22d/1m now ? 
  i 'm aware of half fare cards but constantly buying tickets and counting money thinking whether i can go somewhere will * suck * . 
  [ vent ], 
  goddamn , as if russian economy drowning in shit was n't enough problems for my much anticipated next switzerland visit - this had to happen too . 
  i wan na punch something really hard right now . 
  [ / vent ], 
  this game has 4 * classes that all can have fun in various ways . 
  and then it has a class that shits on people having fun . 
  just thought this was a nice summary . 
  \\* max is not a class , it 's a vehicle with infantry-like mobility . 
  i personally am enjoying watching kripp in poe again . 
  i also enjoy him explaining and guiding a new player ( rania ) into the game . 
  it 's a complex game guys , and you ca n't just get good at it the first playthrough , even with all the help . 
  i personally hope that she gets better and we will see them both play hardcore in not too distant future . 
  so i was reading some answer about workings of a nucleus and it got me thinking . 
  neutrons help to space out and strongly bind repulsing protons inside a massive nucleus . 
  neutrons alone are unstable and decay pretty quickly , i presume this is due to lack of stabilization from strong interaction with other nucleons ? 
  but why ca n't there be ( or can it ? ), 
  a strongly-bound neutron cluster stabilized by that same strong interaction ? 
  is this functionality not yet in or is something wrong on my end ? 
  to be clear , i 'm talking about live search query suggestions as you type it into address/search bar . 
  it does n't work for me and it 's getting kinda annoying . 
  i 'm using vivaldi beta and this search url, 
  deconstructing was ( afaik ) removed because players would deny both the kill and the xp by bailing and deconstructing the vehicle . 
  over the years it was suggested numerous times that deconstructing may be allowed if the player and the vehicle did n't take any damage in a set amount of time ( similar to redeploy ) or at the warpgate . 
  my educated guess is that the warpgate is easier to implement because the game already tracks ( for now * cough * ) player 's invulnerability status and that can be used as a sign to allow deconstructing ( as opposed to tracking damage on both vehicle and player ) . 
  last thing that was opened were bookmarks . 
  i 've also had google translate there as a panel . 
  version 1.1.453.59 ( stable channel ) ( 64-bit ) , windows 8.1, 
  any reason for this ? 
  i know i can install script/extension but i prefer not to bloat my browser with them . 
  as a salty vet i believe this question deserves a separate thread . 
  examples :, 
  very disorienting and really annoying ( seizure-inducing flashy images ) .
