   in d3 i do n't get that option . 
  i 'm forced to play in the same sandbox as everyone else , unless i want to gimp my characters by equipping them only with the garbage i find myself . 
  what ? 
  you want to play single player ? 
  leave all chats , dnd and there you go . 
  oh you want th loot from ah too ? 
  now you just do n't make sense . 
  i 'm sure they really care about your opinion and will just throw away millions of copies they sold . 
  you know that these kinds of generalizations never work , right ? 
  how does one nation feel about the other ? 
  well , with no special circumstances there 's just no general answer , it 's kinda obvious . 
  i knew what the link was before i clicked it . 
  watched it again . 
  the speed , the decision making , the execution are just amazing . 
  yeah , i have a feeling that blizzard should just release a x10 damage multiplier charm and buff all mob hp ten times and call it expansion . 
  it seems this will be enough for most people . 
   gear up to your 100k dps on just the gold you made leveling, 
  aaaaand here 's your problem . 
  you acquire quite rare ( in terms of roll possibility ) items for almost no gold because of economy saturation , and then - surprise - do n't ever find an upgrade because your items are actually quite good , but do n't meet the standards that you should dump couple of billions to get a good character in gear that 's actually * extremely * rare . 
  i will laugh my ass off when i 'll see someone post something like this : `` man this loot 2.0 sucks !, 
  i bought a 5k dps weapon for 1mil gold and now ca n't find an upgrade ! '', 
  60 hours , no ah , tons of fun , going to switch to mp2 soon . 
  no idea what you 're talking about . 
  `` non viable '' , really ? 
   give me a game i can play on my own . 
  go and play it . 
  after more than a year , people still believe that they are forced by someone to use ( rm ) ah . 
  is this a permanent mind disorder or something ? 
  reminds me of almost exatly 2 years ago : http://i.imgur.com/lvt51dp.jpg memories , 
   gm sunshine  you are there figure head and leader, 
  and now you know . 
  sov is shit . 
  my friends stayed in [ weisses kreuz ] ( http://www.booking.com/hotel/ch/weisses-kreuz-st-gallen.en-gb.html ) , i visited them a couple of times and it looked really nice especially for the low price they got . 
  resubbed yesterday , now paying my money for my sub . 
  feels good . 
  i was handicapped in a way that i couldnt play my [ second ] fav class with my friends . 
  people claiming selffound is inherently handicapped to ah just can not logic though . 
   i can tell you my hc chars gear is way inferior even though i 've played hardcore more than softcore . 
  who defines ` inferior ' ? 
  it 's the most bullshit argument against self found . 
  what you mean is that your numbers on items are somewhat smaller and consequently numbers on your screen and mp selector are also smaller . 
  what difference this makes ? 
  none , except mp mf & xp bonuses , which you should work to get , if you really want to . 
  i get it , your numbers are bigger . 
  i dont care for numbers though . 
  and ubers and hellfire rings being a challenge - what a crazy idea , right ? 
  why did you bother to reply to a 13d old post with the same thing i was disagreeing about in the other thread ? 
  dude , stop downvoting everything for no reason lol . 
  i told you i dont care for arbitrary numbers . 
  the fuck dissolution of soviet union has to do with this ? 
  there was no pure `` let 's end this police state right now ! '', 
  idea . 
  the country was bankrupt and lost its power over republics . 
  how is this still gaining upvotes ? 
  the asset loading sucks , i agree . 
  i worked around it with 16gb usb stick though . 
  tldr, 
  game is alright and i 'd say amazing at times . 
  but watching ccp do their pr thing is like watching breaking bad : when you think all is finally well and nothing will go wrong they manage to fuck up in yet another way =\\, 
  if you 're referring to timeouts after a certain telia hop - blizzard servers never reply to icmp . 
  it 's not an indication of a problem when host does not reply to icmp requests . 
  it 's general practice for some companies to drop them . 
  you can see it for yourself , just tracert any . logon.battle.net , be it us or eu - you wo n't get a reply from final destination . 
  ` request timed out ' does not indicate a problem . 
  often it merely says that the host was set up to not respond to icmp requests . 
  all blizzard servers are set up in this way so there 's no problem visible in those traceroutes . 
  none of the servers from [ this page ] ( https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/performing-a-traceroute#addresses ) will respond to a ping command . 
  it does n't mean they 're broken , they are just set up this way . 
  all i want is a `` you are here '' t-shirt :(, 
  what the hell is an `` internet 's security system '' ? 
  my guess is people are downvoting because of eu lags . 
  which is in no way adequate nonetheless . 
  it actually has its use . 
  i turned on passive modules showing after i burned out my lse with mwd and didnt know about it the whole time . 
  and you try to pile them nicely on the hotkeys you dont use . 
  not on topic but dude !, 
  i was always puzzled on how to overwrite output in console and print everything on the same line . 
  turns out its just adding ** \\ r ** without ** \\ n ** % ), 
  i 'm surprised as i was some years ago when i saw truncating a string just by putting a ** \\ 0 ** in the right place ( c string ) . 
   to progress i have had to use the ah for the numerous items to fill in the blank, 
  you had to ? 
  or have you used it at your own will the first time , and could n't find an upgrade ever since ? 
  i recommend reading this : http://dd.reddit.com/r/diablo/comments/1nh52v/p100_100_selffound_player_reflection_xpost_from/, 
   if you 're unusually lucky or spend a thousand hours with your character , maybe you 'll hit mp5 . 
  again , this : http://dd.reddit.com/r/diablo/comments/1nh52v/p100_100_selffound_player_reflection_xpost_from/, 
  i understand reasons for this kind of angry post , but you should also understand that this sounds really like / r/firstworldproblems stuff . 
  i 'm trying not to take it personally , not being an american helps % ), 
  having read immigrant forums in russian and english i 'd say that many of them ended up moving by coincidence , not by working hard to achieve that . 
  some people really dont deserve it . 
  this is not smart nor funny nor interesting , this is disgusting and retarded . 
  downvote , if you must . 
  it is real , i was there . 
  [ son ... 
  yeah , for a second i was like `` wtf is this , i 'm not taking orders from you '' . 
  like 6 months for me . 
  i guess it 's a personal thing . 
  that 's why it 's * really * irritating when people rain shit on this movie x_x, 
  is going overboard with unusual stuff the only way to go with sci-fi worlds ? 
  it is great because every little detail fits perfectly and has a somewhat plausible scientific explanation . 
  and it was a terrestrial planet so why ca n't it be similar to earth overall with many small differences ?
