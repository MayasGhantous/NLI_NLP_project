  hamgu , problem solved . 
  i actually cant get any of my friends to play for that reason and i tried many times . 
  i 'd say limited turnspeed does n't add much or anything to the gameplay , but it alone makes it feel really slow . 
  getting rid of this limit would be an improvement already . 
  i want my hero to move directly to the point i clicked , not make some weird arcs . 
  try stutter stepping at lvl 1 as a wizard in d3 . 
  now try it as a witch in poe . 
  it is * ridiculous * . 
  this was the first thing it reminded me about . 
  for people interested : here 's the full iaea report on the accident http://www-pub.iaea.org/mtcd/publications/pdf/pub815_web.pdf, 
  it is also the main info source of that wiki page . 
  the events description starts at page 22 . 
  most 10/10s are sig-tanked afaik . 
  not battleship-tanked . 
  i did drone 10/10s couple years ago in an abaddon and a logi dominix . 
  one time i accidentally full-aggroed the second pocket and was like ` surely i can tank 3 more bss ' . 
  then i died . 
  in a moderately tanked abaddon under 4 large remote reps. 
  some people just get ` carried into ' the country by their parents , spouses , corporations , not working for it themselves . 
  and then they feel fine not integrating , mocking the country they live in etc. 
  to me it 's infuriating , but it 's reality . 
   some swiss people 's thoughts are on these points, 
  for the record , i 'm not swiss . 
  ^ i 'm ^ tired ^ at ^ work ^ and ^ can not ^ into ^ proper ^ english , ^ sorry . 
  [ russia , how am i not surprised ? 
  i should go to bed but i dont think i can sleep now ... 
  love [ this interpretation ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej5rggthy54 ) . 
  sounds very ... philosophical . 
  this is what 's wrong with much of the classical music related media . 
  everyone wants pieces to set some sort of artificial record , whether in tempo , ` hard ' time signatures , number of tonalities used , some math example as in ops nonsense link , or whatever else . 
  the music remains what it is though : an image of emotions and thoughts that could be conveyed only in the music language . 
  you need to feel and live through it , not try to deconstruct it looking for some unrelated thing . 
  i once went to see a game in my medium sized russian city . 
  i. . . yeah , i will regret that decision forever . 
   or delay ( which is currently only available through twitch * as a partner * ), 
  theoretically , i wonder how much additional load would it be for the streaming client to handle the delay locally ? 
  to promote streaming to people that are n't experienced with it , increase eve twitch numbers , profit . 
  not to re-implement a full-blown broadcasting software inside a game . 
  reading the reactions to the blog i guess this was n't as obvious as i thought . 
  weird ? 
  sounds more like nazi . 
  yeah , i was thinking that a lot like `` why am running around 10 different shops comparing prices when i can just open the market wind ... oh wait :\\ '', 
   wife : can you make popcorn ? 
   me : i 'm in hostile space , i ca n't leave right now . 
   wife : you 're aligned , i 'll warp you to a safe if anything enters local . 
   me : ... ( making popcorn ), 
  that 's almost like [ sudo make me a sandwich ] ( http://xkcd.com/149/ ) :d, 
  i doubt solar reads reddit , it 's not popular here . 
  there go your hts . 
  you know that you can set up bracket profiles , right ? 
  ( i.e. 
  no drones ), 
  typical blizzard reaction time . 
  / sigh, 
  wtf is this downvote squad lol, 
   you do n't have to like something to continue playing it . 
  now this is ... really ... 
   i played through the game twice , with several lower level alts ,, 
  here 's your problem . 
  the story is excellent , it 's just not shoved down your throat as others pointed out . 
  to me it offers the thing i love most in storytelling : a feeling of some `` secret '' that i must research . 
  what is this empire and how has it fallen ? 
  how did they discover gems and how do they work ? 
  who are vaal ? 
  etc etc, 
  the mittani is strong with this one . 
  breaking news : pressing any button with an offensive module bound to it and safety disabled while having a target locked in a highsec cap will lead to ban . 
  there are very few highsec caps and i 'm sure their owners know about this policy regarding their rare toys . 
  same goes for * any * actions leading to aggression . 
  ... and a bag of money , tyvm !, 
   crazy users might overload op , ( ), 
  at this point i said `` fuck crazy users , you can not forsee what else they 'll invent '' , 
  it 's fun and hilarious . 
  no we wo n't . 
  in this game - probably ( it 's really easy to create an alt , no 'em ployment history ' ) . 
  in eve there are no such logs in most places , only audit containers have them . 
   just cause it 's online does n't mean it does n't reflect your dodgy or lack of ethics . 
  i also shoot people in the face online . 
  i guess i must be locked up immediately . 
  also this guy : http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ewx5vk_sl3m/tg8cfwhasyi/aaaaaaaaads/6pfxiy9vzb8/s400/sandcastle_baby.jpg, 
   a real pvp system, 
  this always makes me smile : calling ` hostile ' button a `` pvp system '' . 
  jesus dude take it easy , you 'll have a heart attack . 
  this sub becomes more and more unreadable . 
  i dont know why people think that everyone should plan their gold balance , actively hoard stuff , and generally play an economy simulator . 
  like ever since ros was announced all the talk is about buying/selling/hoarding stuff . 
  i have 50m right now so i will probably have around 50-100 mil at ros release since i do n't play very often and do n't have spendings now that my wizard set is complete . 
  i hoard flawless squares , tears , essences and brimstones - all selffound - even if that dons n't make much sense , i just like doing it . 
  i play the game . 
  here have some more useless charts, 
  executioner and malediction . 
  i probably spent more time traveling/scouting in those ships than flying everything else . 
  not sure if sarcasm , but executioner is a t1 frig , 
   protoss mechanics are gimmicky and currently overpowered . 
  fact . 
  proven by science !, 
   they do n't make a significant amount of money and they never will . 
  7.5 m/month just in sub pays seem significant .

  buffing and nerfing wo n't ` fix ' this game if it 's ` rotten at the core ' .
