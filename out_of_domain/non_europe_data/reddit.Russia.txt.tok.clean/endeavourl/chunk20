  you can get good fps in any tidi . 
  it actually looks pretty cool , like bullet time . 
   i 'm saying it 's old and busted and they need a rewrite . 
  and it will never happen . 
   the combat is incredibly boring . 
  you just activate buttons and kind of sit there . 
  and this is the way to repeatedly lose small scale skirmishes . 
  you can play this game in a lot of different ways . 
   kugu , with that in mind , is much more a cesspool of toxic circlejerking, 
  you mean that for western standards kugu is worse than eve-ru is for russian ? 
  could be true i guess , but then i read kugu all day today ( rip work lol ) and did n't have a slightest wish to open eve-ru . 
  also , what do you think about failheap and the dreaded caod then ? 
  from a business perspective it 's very high risk and moderate far-future reward . 
  i too started in 2009 and took 1.5-2 years to feel fully caught up . 
  and a year later i decided to train logistics ( heal ) and since then i 'm welcome in any large scale fleet format at any time . 
  he does work for ccp . 
  did you see fanfest ? 
  i was thinking about it the whole day . 
  the rush of losing/destroying something is probably ** the ** thing that keeps most of us in the game . 
  such a powerful feeling . 
  eve is real . 
  gameplay-wise it 's quite dull considering tidi and lag . 
  what keeps you going is the feeling of working together with thousand of your space-buddies to incur * real irreversible losses * upon your enemies . 
  losses , as in `` i throw your thousand of man-hour-equivalents into trash '' as well as your field dominance for the near future and morale , which you 'll now have to work for , otherwise your people will leave for good . 
  losses in eve truly hurt your opponent , even if you both had fun - he will have to rebuild from what he has left . 
  and losses of this scale ... i ca n't even comprehend the combined worth of 60 titans . 
  and because of this winning feels like a true accomplishment , work paid off . 
  eve is real . 
  ps i hope i made at least some sense here . 
  it is hard to describe . 
  who the fuck are even ~ top players ~ in an open ended sandbox ? 
  guys doing lvl 4s in 20b vindicators ? 
  the whole concept of `` catching up '' is laughable . 
   can only do that if you know what you 're doing, 
  what a shocker !, 
  really now ... 
  i really think the complete overhaul will never happen . 
  they will continue to gradually improve their systems and getting rid of legacy code . 
  as for competition , i really do n't see it in the near future . 
  of course no one knows what sc will really be like , but all i 'm waiting for as just a dogfighting game because freelancer has gotten really old . 
  at some point , yes . 
  but the community actually wants a sovereignty system that would n't encourage people to pile into one system until it stops . 
  because however good your code is it will stop at some point . 
  for example , before tidi was implemented the system would experience extreme lag at roughly 1.5-2k players . 
  people would black-screen , nothing would respond to commands for 15 + minutes , the node could just crush . 
  now with tidi the * exact same symptoms * occur in 4k + locals , only slowed down to 10 % real time . 
  it does n't matter how good your processing power is , there always will be a cap . 
  and while these large battles are truly epic and make for a lot of public visibility , in the end they are the result of flawed game mechanic that encourages you to get as many people in one place until servers are on fire . 
  you have a misconception about this game at a very basic level . 
  you do n't need to compete with everyone at every level . 
  you pick a direction that feels fun and go with it . 
  be it market manipulation , small or large scale fights , exploring , logistics , leadership , anything . 
  some of those do require a lot in terms of experience , skills , social connections , some do n't . 
  and of course you 'll need to learn , ask , google and generally get experience , how is that unexpected ? 
  it 's not a twitch-shooter game , and even in those there 's some room for learning . 
  i 'd say first months of eve were actually most fun in a way . 
  so much new stuff . 
  do you do any small scale pvp ? 
  do you know about orbit break maneuver ? 
  do you know how to decide when to overheat ? 
  do you know how to set up a favorable engagement ? 
  if not , please stop talking out of your ass . 
   and you 've lost so-damn-much, 
  `` never fly anything you ca n't afford to lose . '', 
  3 esfs beat 3 heavys ? 
  yes , with some work avoiding the lock-ons and how dare they ? 
   tanks, 
   never a distraction from the infantry battle, 
   while in an esf you used to be able to do the same thing solo !, 
  do what ? 
  franticly escaping flak and lock-ons ? 
  brb wasting 100 intys mwding into bombs . 
   everything is basically permanent , too . 
  that 's kind of ** the ** point . 
   no way in hell i was going to allow a group of players not matter how big or small , give prizes for people violating an in game mechanic, 
   if any eve players are hanging around and think its funny that they managed to ruin a game i enjoyed playing , then congratulations , you are all dicks . 
   but , when it was declared as all year round specifically as a way of trying to stop me playing how i wish to play ? 
  that is what annoyed me . 
  adapt or die . 
  you 're neither first or last . 
  in some corners of space you can make 40 jumps without seeing a non-blue . 
  that 's why many alliances make nips ( non-invasion pacts ) within their coalitions and then temp reset standings so they can have some of that volatile pvp fun . 
  judging by downwotes we have a very bad case of ` single-player eve ' here . 
  i see you 've been out of the loop , but fyi eve has come to the point where such major losses are still manageable . 
  i 'm sure that pl are n't going anywhere . 
  but it sure will be a logistical and financial nightmare for them as they scramble to restore their might . 
  we 'll probably see some movement in this stalemate-ish war in the next month . 
  what 's more important is that they were beaten at their best game - supercaps . 
  it will be very interesting to see how they will adapt to this . 
  it may even change the meta entirely . 
  there 's certainly no quick way or a manual for that , just as in real life . 
  i 'm at work . 
  was he actually suicided ? 
  if so why did n't anyone petition it and explain that he 's mostly safe in the starting system ? 
  this game is awesome because nothing except noob system rules and ~ moral grounds ~ prohibits people from doing this . 
  you are free to play * however * you like . 
   that far into the tutorial , 20 minutes , you do n't know what happens when you die . 
  well ** go and find out ** maybe ? 
  make a new char if you break this one ( hint : at this point you ca n't ) . 
  it 's not like you have a single shot at this .
