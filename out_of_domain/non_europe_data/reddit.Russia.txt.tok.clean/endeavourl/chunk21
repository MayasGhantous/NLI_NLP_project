  also this would 've banned that harassing asshole . 
  nync is pretty much assumed to be ( have been , does n't play anymore afaik ) a payroll fc by ru-community . 
  no real proof of course . 
   pastebin linked in the devblog writeup :, 
  so ccp still ca n't let go and start mentioning k.com where appropriate . 
   1.5 million km ( roughly 10au , give or take a couple ), 
  correction : 1.5 billion km, 
  on a related note : use google for au-km conversions . 
  like this : https://www.google.com/search?q=10+au+in+km, 
  it 's really annoying to kill them . 
  good to see him going out of hisec early on . 
  ccp is too busy crossing the rubicon , whatever the hell that supposed to mean . 
  i like how the cursor is on the ` take all ' button . 
  confirms , that i 'll never trust even my corpmates with this , let alone my alliance . 
  what i do wan na bet is that one of those n thousand dudes in my alliance/blues will quietly take my isk and i wo n't even know . 
  or maybe that 'd be me taking . 
  edit : i ca n't read . 
  still though , i wo n't trust anybody with this , notifications of not . 
  dude ... 
  propaganda level : bullshit . 
   what happens when you suffer brain damage ? 
  you cease being you ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alzheimer's_disease i 'd say yes . 
  it is so stupid trying to do something useful in a tank in tawrich canyon area and just be almost instakilled by 3 engineers on the top of the ridge a fucking kilometer away . 
  delayed for how much longer ? 
  / sigh, 
   most instances of abandoning their allies after shit gets tough . 
   most instances, 
  yeah , no . 
  any biolab that we hold is good for three-ways . 
  why does a relatively stationary shooter need an engagement radar ? 
  i use them just because i know the feeling myself . 
  itt : people not knowing about npc space and roaming small-scale pvp corps/alliances . 
  10 ( or whatever ) minute cooldown on flash is literally retarded . 
  nice isk sink . 
  those missiles basically feel like cheating , because instead of flying * to * you , they ** copy your entire trajectory ** . 
  this means that however good piloting you do - it does n't matter , they will copy it , catch up and hit you . 
  you ca n't drive them into terrain , they just go around it or even through it !, 
  and all that is for 250 certs and holding rmb on your target . 
  a week old clueless ha can do this bullshit . 
  it 's infuriating . 
  voting for the most broken dumb weapon in game . 
   if you 're getting three lock-ons then you have either incredibly bad luck ( 3 separate launchers ), 
  um ... er ... that 's not bad luck that 's how things usually go . 
  if you dared to enter the sphere of influence of any serious battle with flares on cooldown ( which is 25-30 fucking seconds ) - 80 % of the time you 're already dead from multiple lock ons + flak . 
  i 'm actually curious , how can radar help you except inform you about your impending death ? 
  it is both my fault and probably a skilled player that killed me . 
  no problem here at all . 
   russia for the most part is a lot of fun, 
  you know nothing . 
  you can get same income for an average grunt about ten other ways and not waste weeks of your life dealing with shit sov mechanics and logistics . 
  now they 'll be able to starve my 16 gigs :d, 
  do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  i press ` windows ' on keyboard , click ps2 tile . 
  done . 
   please , keep in mind that freerunning is potentially dangerous , especially when practiced at heights ,, 
   ** potentially ** dangerous, 
  because alliance income , supercap epeen and hordes of uncreative players easily convinced by propaganda . 
  i remember myself about 2.5 years ago when xix was purged out of drone regions . 
  i was afraid of zero income , no bridges , constant enemy pressure etc. 
  then we moved to venal and i saw that that was just a bunch of leadership bullshit trying to motivate average members to do sov war . 
  venal is to this day the best time i 've had in eve . 
   acquiring sov is fun, 
  depends on scale . 
  one constellation , yeah maybe . 
  2 + regions worth of grinding and tcuing and ihubbing and upgrading . 
  ugh , fuck that . 
  yeah or that for programs that i use less often . 
  i played on 32bit winxp and that was pure hell . 
  crashes every 20-30 minutes due to 2gb virtual address space limit . 
  / 3gb did n't really work , caused bluescreens in nvidia drivers . 
  this is in no way a good experience so i think it 's fine to drop support for that platform . 
  / sigh, 
  people ( new or old to the game ) getting worked up about losing vehicles in this game should go play eve online . 
  when you lose a ship there - you definitely * lost * something that almost felt real to you . 
  after experiencing that in that game , in this game you 'll just say `` well fuck , let 's spawn esfs/tanks/instant action '' and go have some fun instead of engaging in frustrating conversations . 
  yes it 's frustrating , and in this case the guy 's clearly a douche , but it 's literally nothing to worry about . 
  go have fun while your timer ticks down with no effort required for it ( as opposed to eve ) . 
  edit : mind to explain what you do n't agree with in this post ? 
  edit2 : i guess i picked wrong thread to air my thoughts about `` losing '' stuff in this game . 
  i can have that too but i prefer having less than 5 icons on my desktop , otherwise it becomes a pile of shit . 
  i 'm not saying that it 's bad , rather that for me it becomes too crowded and uncategorized . 
  getting tired of people trying to spin this whole ` under the bus ' thing . 
  and where did i say anything about [ not ] being a dick ? 
  yes that guy is an asshole , forget about him and move on . 
  all i wanted to say is just continue having fun because you did n't actually lose shit . 
  i doubt that he somehow deliberately `` teaches '' only new players , that was just bad luck . 
  and i do n't think a new player alone would understand that he was actually deliberately flipped . 
  i think most new players would just say `` wtf '' and instant action ( or close the game , yes , tough shit , they 'd die 2 minutes later anyway ) . 
   hi i use that version , mostly because i did n't want to lose the ability to play old games . 
  how would you lose that ability on x64 ? 
  there should n't be a difference . 
  i do n't really know severity of your situation but did you watch that video entirely ? 
  it gives you like 5 steps to escalate your dispute further and further until you outright tell them that you refuse to comply and to sue you ( which they wo n't do of course ) . 
  i 'm not swiss but i know you should buy your stuff on thursdays :p, 
  i like everything about new warp effect except almost non-existent blue and red shifts :\\, 
  took down a reaver with a heat shell from a lightning , while it ( reaver ) was going at full afterburner perpendicular to direction i was facing some 10m away ( i basically mean that he was at his highest transversal velocity relative to me ) . 
  that was pure luck and instinct ( my hand literally just twitched by itself ) but is really pleasing nonetheless . 
  here , much more noticeable . 
  also any base that is being [ re ] claimed ( has a timer ) must have a spawn point .
