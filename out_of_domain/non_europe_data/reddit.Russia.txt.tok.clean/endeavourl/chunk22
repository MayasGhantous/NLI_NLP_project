  it 's so stupid when you see that your base is being taken by just a couple of enemy dudes , then waste two minutes to redeploy-travel there only to find that the base is already clear/almost taken . 
  it is part of my fucking territory under attack , why ca n't i insta-spawn there ? 
  because cod had it and now kids demand it everywhere . 
  why is n't this at the top ? 
  some my friends look at my screenshots , see the overview and immediately go hurpdurp spreadsheets online wololo . 
  so tiring ... 
  any game is a giant spreadsheet with pretty direct3d ui , if you want to look at it this way . 
  eve online kinda has somewhat of a point . 
  until you burn out and start winning ( i.e. 
  not playing ) . 
   it 's a fucking game based on killing screen fulls of monsters, 
  not screen fulls . 
  that 1.0.8 density was a band aid slapped to give op builds like cm and ww more meat to go through and also to make acts other than 3 viable ( and it actually killed act3 in the end ) . 
  with 1.0.8 density there 's literally * no * room left for ranged builds , you 're required to facetank at all times . 
  i for one hope they can find a balance and scale it properly with difficulty . 
  they will not release the best selling pc game without drm . 
  you 'll have to live through that . 
  surely you 're a specialist on d3 and wow backend architecture . 
  you know i 've seen a lot of fucked up shit here . 
  but this actually made me gag , ugh ... 
   hardly any russians, 
  any it educated person uses google . 
  then they say it 's not ~ actual gameplay ~ . 
  you 're talking about d2 ? 
  there were n't screen fulls and they were easily kiteable . 
  surely every piece of computer software works and scales in exactly same way . 
  different software scales differently , i thought this was an obvious fact . 
  i was asked the same about three fucking pairs of nimh accumulators . 
  like wtf , do n't you see that they 're in my camera case and i 'm going on vacation so i 'd like to take some pictures and for that i need spare batteries ? 
  luckily they did n't ask too much and allowed me to take them . 
  software engineer . 
  i 'm under impressions that majority of players are either in it or management . 
  experience with any of those helps to start in the game tremendously . 
  nice alpha . 
   drone russian federation, 
  nope, 
  i just hope that one day we 'll find the materials to make shuttles work ( or at least make them safe [ r ] ) . 
  it 's called a false positive . 
  just dispute it . 
  why are you taking it this personally ? 
  this initiative does n't target op personally ( as in `` you , % opname % , pack your stuff '' ) . 
  and he talks about it exactly in this way , like he personally was told to get out . 
  servers are overcrowded this weekend . 
  just want to say that i 'm in no way a member of majority here . 
  i know what you mean but please do n't call things that are n't actually isk faucets isk faucets . 
  there 's enough misinformation about it as it is . 
  edit : disregard this , til . 
  [ listen and concentrate , you piece of shit . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zmkxtjl35g ), 
  huh , did n't know about tags , okay then . 
  who the fuck thought bringing a legion was a good idea . 
  this is actually the best advice . 
  instead having it shown to you - find and see it yourself . 
  muta vs muta zvz are terribad too . 
   http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/1xlu20/dev_post_crest_killmails_endpoint_ccp_foxfour/, 
  this needs way more visibility . 
  because durr hurr durr . 
  if you played freelancer you know that it will be a completely different game . 
   the guns of each esf also make distinctive sounds that are audible from much further than the engines are , however it may take you longer to differentiate between them and vehicle/infantry guns . 
  i still mistake one engine sound for another but reaver 's rotary is like an alarm to me . 
  very distinct . 
  vanu lazors are also quite distinctive . 
  some guys at work write that kind of software so i was quite confused as well :d, 
  pl had a station called dicksdicksdicksdicksdicks once . 
  they were * asked * to rename it . 
  e : found it http://evemaps.dotlan.net/outpost/f-d49d, 
  you can also use evemon 's api tester . 
  it told me i have 4.55 k hours logged . 
  i sure had a lot of time couple of years ago . 
  also known as * accidentally double click in space to lose your anchor * . 
  on a serious note : ** hey , ccp ** , why is n't this in the tutorial somewhere ? 
  e : well if it it there then it certainly needs more emphasis . 
   instead of following esfs now like a rocket should, 
  like it should ? 
  ** like it should ?!, 
  it 's not a fucking flying ai , it 's a rocket that 's trying to get as close to the target as possible as fast as possible . 
  thank god for this , now i can actually drive them into terrain using my * flying skills * . 
  gamedev tip : nobody gives a shit about realism as long as fun gameplay is provided . 
   the tr are so ridiculously immature , it 's hilarious . 
   they are so obsessed with feeling sorry, 
  nice generalizations . 
  have a downvote . 
  ps tr is ok , banshee is excellent , vulcan is stupid , striker is retarded , rotary sucks . 
  that is all . 
  please try to comprehend :, 
  i downvoted you solely for your childish generalizations . 
  which in no way proves your `` point '' . 
   so yeah . 
  the tr are still ridiculously immature . 
  in that case , go fuck yourself . 
  i 'm not in a good mood today . 
  e : a little explanation perhaps . 
  it irrirates me greatly when some fucktard calls ** tens of thousands ** of people `` ridiculously immature '' based ** solely ** on a fact that they chose to play a faction * whose best defining element is ... * ** red color ** ( for a new player at least ) . 
  i can not stand such behavior and my faction here does n't even matter here ( although it does n't help either ) . 
  fyi if you say irl : `` people who like x color/dark haired girls/cold weather are ridiculously immature '' you potentially get smacked in the face for having no brain . 
  i hope this sheds some light on how fucking stupid your generalizing statement was . 
   enuff, 
  for some reason every time i go to amerish i get raped . 
  i like esamir very much though .
