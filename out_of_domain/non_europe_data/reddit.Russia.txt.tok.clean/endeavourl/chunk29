  well you could represent that data in some star citizen like ui , but would you really want to ? 
   you can also still hit up `` drei weiher '' which is the local place to go swimming and just chill out, 
  pretty nice view from up there too . 
   the big thing is implants . 
  do n't worry , they 're actually good now . 
  ca n't help but link to [ my comment from a month ago ] ( http://dd.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/25shrp/higby_plz/chkno3x?context=3 ) ... , 
  that thread ( along with other ) is ... something . 
  i recently got ap and like it much better than heat . 
  it does real damage against vehicles solo , has very nice projectile velocity ( do n't know about upcoming patch ) , ohks infantry w / direct hits . 
  heat 's splash damage and radius are not worth it imo . 
  the red ones are just bad texture and lightning . 
  i cringe every time i see them . 
  it 's bad publicity and it 's all over the place already . 
  personally i 'm pretty sick of it . 
  edit : apparently i 'm wrong and aliasing your game `` spreadsheet simulator '' will make it more popular . 
  what do i know . 
  please do n't write false sensationalist psas . 
  second level is only 10 too . 
   i wish to travel around switzerland as well , but i dont have much money to throw around . 
  if you travel enough ( and not even too much ) swiss pass will pay for itself . 
  you can check ticket prices on [ sbb.ch ] ( http://www.sbb.ch/en/home.html ) and compare them to [ swiss pass ] ( http://www.swisstravelsystem.com/en/tickets-en/swiss-pass-en.html#details ), 
  it 's also very cool to just hop on any * train or ship or bus and travel wherever you like . 
  just remember that there are no trains at night , 
  * - with a few exceptions , see validity map, 
  does this bother you ? 
  do you want to talk about it ? 
  edit : whoa easy there , reddit , i just asked why that dude questioned ops privacy . 
  which means it also shocks , freezes and burns you pretty much whenever it wants . 
  meanwhile , in a neighboring thread people scream for * content * . 
  ca n't please everyone . 
  remove thermals and increase infantry-to-vehicle ttk 3 times . 
  give everyone a g2a lockon , halve its damage . 
  you can try http://draw.io , it 's free . 
  what are they there for though , some kind of elitism feeling ? 
  i hate people like these . 
  i wish we did n't . 
  please come evict us . 
  so dex = str except for different classes . 
  diversity in this game ... non-existent . 
  then change their core damage reduction mechanism , not change their stat to strengterity \u2122, 
  so change it so it works on that shit ? 
  what an idea !, 
  they 'll change it in the near future . 
  ( aka after the heat death of the universe ), 
  due to client hit detection , by the time you see lock warning/missiles the hit is imminent or already happened . 
   who cares how `` inspired '' the change is because it is going to be fixed . 
  you mean it will have a * lazy and uninspired * band aid slapped on ? 
  meanwhile in poe-land ~ ~ ~ i 'm trying my n-th build . 
  i did play dh and this change sucks compared to what they could 've done . 
   but it just was n't possible, 
  i 'm pretty sure that if you made * numbers * high enough you could make dodge not only competitive but op too . 
  ( and made everything dodgeable if that 's not obvious ), 
  stat diversity ? 
  in this game ? 
   for all we know , this is a temporary solution until they can come up with something that 's better, 
  in the near future . 
  ( aka the heat death of the universe ), 
   amor and allresist were always the same thing , just clean damage mitigation . 
  we call them different names and we use both , but int and str classes were always the same in that regard . 
  in this case there 's at least a point for int classes ( around 1800 all res ) where stacking armor becomes more efficient than ar . 
  that 's at least * something * . 
  this strengterity \u2122 though ... one step from goodness \u2122 \u2122 . 
   but it did n't feel quite as cancerous as people made it out to be before it went live, 
  because they changed it and removed the dumb projectile velocity nerf in particular ? 
  usually maxes are in low ceiling rooms . 
  that eliminates la threat . 
  with has you often do n't make it to the max . 
   the only complaints about maxes come from solo or small group players . 
  that 's right but it does n't mean it 's not a problem . 
   yes , it does . 
  solo players are irrelevant to the game and should not be taken seriously . 
  you would n't listen to someone complaining that they ca n't win a game of chess with a single paw, 
  something something libop, 
  12-24 fights are always fun until someone pulls a max . 
   ( using any class ), 
  now that 's just gone from opinion to silly . 
   and they call it `` scheduled maintenance '' . 
  `` scheduled '' means `` planned beforehand by devs '' as opposed to `` servers are on fire '' . 
  that was n't even a nerf , just some random tweak in the patch notes . 
  i threw a sticky in there just for shits and giggles, 
  i remember when people on / r/planetside recommended miller for new amerish experience , because we actually had people there . 
  i miss that time ;\\, 
  #lockindar 2014, 
  i think it needs a smaller magazine . 
  it 's fine otherwise though . 
  relevant : harassers should n't be able to get inside infantry bases , e.g. 
  techplant balcony - 2 ppa harassers there is just stupid , you ca n't do shit . 
  i thought alerts are going away with hossin and cont locks ? 
  or is this about those `` adversarial alerts ? '', 
  # 12 is amazing . 
  that must 've been the end of the world for the people witnessing . 
  it is . 
   the problem is that the rest of continents do n't have anything that is better or even different then indar . 
  indar bases are utter shit . 
  recursion + fraps work fine for me . 
  i had to disable msi afterburner for planetside2_x64 . exe though because it crashed on startup . 
  any advice how to get it working ? 
  new shields further encourage spawn warriors . 
  i disapprove . 
  lightning handling is broken including ` invert reverse steering on tanks ' switch .
