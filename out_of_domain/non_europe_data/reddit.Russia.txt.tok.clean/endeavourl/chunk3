  wrong , the only thing that matters is my health ( my palms in this case ), 
  it only updated for me after i posted a comment with my battletag there : http://www.diabloprogress.com/post/94_updating_paragon_level !, 
  and it stopped updating after that again . 
  no matter how many different update buttons i pressed . 
  it looks like it was manually updated by my request , which does n't make any sense ... 
  was farming the a2 key , found an upgrade instead , 
  and what 's the difference between 61armor and 63armor besides 100 more armor value ( 10allres ; practically nothing ) ? 
  i always laugh when people on streams pick up , say , razorspikes and leave armbands that lay right on top of them . 
  i dont understand . 
  it 's either all inferno-dropped belts , chests , pants , w/e , or none except legendary . 
  or would you really skip something like 250vit 150stat 80allres 3sockets life % chest armor if it was ilvl58 and pick up ilvl63 even if they have equal chance of being trash ? 
  just because of inherent armor valuer roll ? 
  any armor will sell with good roll on it . 
  you might wan na drop weapons except 62-63 one handers . 
  pick up only jewelry and gloves then . 
  63 armor is * very marginally * better than < 63armor . 
  no point of picking up only 63s , you can pick up only 62s for that matter . 
   higher ilvl means higher minimum stats, 
  how exactly does that work ? 
  as i understand after the patch with stat roll change , every stat rolls completely independent of ilvl ( i 'm talking 63mlvl here ) . 
  it can roll 25 or 80 allres on any inferno mlvl63 item , ca n't it ? 
  when you play for a while you will memorize the names of items you ( dont ) want . 
  legendaries , all jewelry , all armor , all daggers , 62 + one handers , 63 twohanders . 
  why you sound so bitter ? 
  i agree k.com is kinda elitist but there 're far worse communities in eve , for example eve-ru . com where people cant tell the difference between funny bits of trolling and throwing shit around like senseless monkeys . 
  also i did understand the thread op linked to :p, 
  http://us.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/7392969421 bump this or make your own thread so they see this is still a big problem !, 
  is all i see there . 
  when the game is first started it loads all animations effects etc on the fly . 
  which results in major fps drops and just unresponsive states throughout the first game you play , especially first couple of levels . 
  they acknowledged this problem : http://us.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/5596249920, 
  but did very little if anything to fix it . 
  what 's easier to do ? 
  to play the game - on ssd , to reproduce the problem - on hd . 
  and why you believe he became human and not just turned into a mortal form that happens to look like human ? 
  i play sc2 and never get any disk stuttering during the game itself . 
  the load time for the first game is longer meaning it loads all necessary things then . 
  the unit preloader map is for downloading missing effects to your cache as i understand it . 
   i do not own an ssd and if i do a run once , i never stutter again doing the same run, 
  me too , but in the first couple of minutes i die almost 100 % . 
  while my fps is exactly zero and hdd led is continuously on . 
   i mean , do you really usually play by doing a single run , closing the client completely and restarting it ? 
  sometimes i do this because i need to do something else and dont have enogh memory to leave d3 in background . 
  and actually i dont know why but after d3 was in background for a long time like 30min i get stutters again . 
  and i didnt even mention hardcore . 
  basically you have to preload everything manually playing the game on softcore for 10 minutes . 
  would 've loved to see it done automatically :p, 
  x + 286 + ( x +286 ) * 0.46 = 561, 
  like this . 
  x is minimum damage for white version of that axe . 
  huh that 's weird . 
  it 's too high for my black weapon too . 
  in case you didnt notice , they were asked . 
  try disabling dep ( data execution prevention ) for d2 . 
  edit : yes mr. downvote , this thing helped me once . 
  i always thought that it went right through the glass and whatnot floors and walls and fell . 
  kinda fishy though yes . 
  op , to be short . 
  like complete singletarget stunlock with 45 something cc 1.77 something aps . 
  nerve you say ? 
  what a small and easy thing to wait with friends for a victim in a public game and then remove his control with couple of mouse clicks . 
  go play eve online . 
  if you survive there you 'll never fall for most scams or traps in games because of good sense of paranoia and attention to important details that you 'll get . 
  here 's the proof if someone 's still interested . 
  an ilvl61 item dropped from mlvl63 mob ( mp2 a3 ) having alvl51 affix ( +87 armor ) :, 
  http://d3inferno.com/affixes/dr_13_secondary.html http://www.d3own.com/affix-list/all-slots/generic/level61/1/, 
  idiots ? 
  only enemies with rd are elites . 
  i doubt many people consistently one shot rd elites . 
  and if they do it without serious mitigation they die pretty quickly . 
  you 're describing a very narrow edge case . 
  most of the time you will get same dmg reflected irrelevant of mp . 
  when you 're crafting affixes roll based on ilvl . 
  highest crafted items are 62 . 
  that makes endgame crafting more useless now than ever before . 
  dont know why for some people it 's so hard to understand that only base armor depends on ilvl -_-, 
  and this is a wrong myth . 
  see here : http://dd.reddit.com/r/diablo/comments/164jkz/what_is_the_definitive_truth_with_mp_enabled/c7u5kqv, 
  in short : ilvl doesnt have ** anything ** to do with affix lvl for dropped items . 
  especially in hardcore that can fuck you up . 
  wizard needs a rework , otherwise it will stay the `` stand still do damage '' class with cmww/archon builds . 
  buffs to orb and other ranged are nice , but you cant get enough ap back to effectively use them . 
  also you dont have enough mobility and mitigation to be truly ranged like a dh . 
  the way the current chat system works it 's not going to work . 
  i was ... dumbfounded when i discovered that there 're thousands instances of the same chat channel with only 6-10 players in each . 
  that 's so . 
  bad . 
  at very least they can allow up to 200 ppl in an instance . 
  damn . 
  i 'm not even bashing this game , never do it , but i did some small game design and seriously , this chat system is so bad . 
  afaik this kind of configuration is hard to set up on windows . 
  you need to set routes to different networks through different gateways ( d3 server network in particular ) . 
  here 's the addresses range for this network . 
  you can look up any other there . 
   the itemization is a lot more like the lottery than it is random, 
  what ?
