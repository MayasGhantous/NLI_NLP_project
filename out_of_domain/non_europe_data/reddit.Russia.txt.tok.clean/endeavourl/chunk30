  well , now they can both shoot and see one-way . 
   this encourages pushing out . 
  maybe , but i 'll believe it when i see it . 
  so * that 's * what was causing me to fly below everyone else . 
  lattice ( aka cont locking that makes more sense ), 
  resource system, 
  til there 's a bunch of greedy air polluting swines on reddit . 
  less bitching please . 
  having played eve online i can say that logistics for the most part are certainly a chore , boring , not exciting activity , etc. 
  it 'll have to be implemented and balanced * very * carefully because if people would need to traverse the whole continent on a flash ( say i 'm low on resources ) to find a good fight - they 're just gon na log off . 
  instant action idea in the video is very good i think . 
  1x reflex sight , ext mag . 
   what the hell is being done about air ? 
  well , let 's see ... an hour ago a skyguard brought my comp . 
  armor mossie to 1/4 hp in under a second and only nearby rock has saved me . 
  so this is something . 
  exactly . 
  i did n't have many problems with esfs as infantry before i started flying and after that i realized that * a roof * protects me 100 % against them . 
  also jetpacks . 
  it 's funny when scythes waste a full mag of rocket pods as you fly above their impacts . 
  yep , was fighting at crossroads today , it works this way ( similar to amp stations and tech plants ) . 
  they need to enable locking on hossin after this weekend . 
  is there any progress on this ? 
  i had to go back to true full screen , it wo n't show otherwise, 
  first people ask for more links because bottlenecks and no strategy . 
  now it 's less ? 
  i think i 'd agree with more . 
  that would n't be a problem it the system allowed you to spawn at your attacked base that has no allies . 
  it 's a pain to see a base ticking down to 1-12 with no allies on it and no way to redeploy-hop in time . 
  does it still make you download the game twice ? 
  meanwhile cert tab at soe website is still coming soon ... 
  i 've read it several times and still do n't understand the reason for ap damage changes . 
  not necessarily against it , just do n't understand , why ? 
  ap lightning ca n't on live fyi . 
  it leaves like 5-8 % . 
  wtb map search that can take any amount of characters . 
  having to put 3 characters out of 6 for 0.0 system is stupid . 
  i 'd be borderline `` okay '' if it was only for infantry . 
  but paying to directly upgrade your max 's ability to kill stuff instead of spending 1000 certs ** really stinks ** . 
  what 's next ? 
  max reload speed on your prowler for only $ 24.99 ? 
  because people shoot and kill in the game about shooting and killing ? 
  call it whatever you want . 
  i 'll quote myself and ask : will `` max reload speed on your prowler for only $ 24.99 '' be fine too ? 
  because we 're getting awfully close to this . 
   with little training i was able to get a kill with nearly every single ap shot . 
  i have hours on record farming infantry like this , and i 'm by far not the only one . 
  so yeah , lets nerf killing infantry with ap and bring even more splash damage into this game . 
  more skill , more fun . 
  * cert out your new valkyrie just for $ 59.95 !, 
  members only !, 
  ^ upgrade ^ now !, 
  how about this , point made clear enough ? 
  implants are sidegrades . 
  you can play without them . 
  in fact many people do so . 
  it 's still splash and we 're talking about killing infantry with ap here . 
  anyone is able to sustain running t2 , and the difference between t2 and t3 regen is 1.67 % hp/s . 
  it is irrelevant . 
   so you 're saying it 's more fair that only br 100 's who saved up 10g certs can max it out ? 
  last time i checked 10k certs required months of effort . 
  so yes , i think it 's fair that you 're rewarded for your effort in game and not having a wallet . 
  i ca n't believe that someone in this sub is actually justifying p2w . 
  not years , no . 
  i thought people here tried to remove p2w stigma from ps2 . 
  meanwhile , you 're blatantly suggesting to turn into p2w because people are lazy/don ' t have time . 
  it does n't work like this . 
  it 's a sidegrade in a sense that the difference between running one and not is minuscule . 
  and the difference it makes is very situational rather then directly improving your stats . 
  like , i run mostly regen but in 48 + fights it 's useless for my playstyle , i even take it off when i do n't forget about it . 
  targeting allows me to make better tactical decisions in the air , but in the end i do about as good with it as i do without . 
  the only one that i can think of that is actually more like an upgrade is hold breath for snipers . 
  again call it whatever you want , it wo n't stop being p2w pile of shit . 
   then when this would only help new people , and not hurt anybody in any way , they start to cry about it . 
  with this there * wo n't be new people * !, 
  no sane person would play a f2p game , where everything is purchaseable because it would basically be p2w for new players ( whatever you want to call it ) . 
  tired of dying to br100 has ? 
  no problem , here 's a full nanoweave for $ 12.45 !, 
  etc , do n't you see a problem here ? 
  maybe it 's okay for you to buy everything as a new player but majority would just leave . 
  eli5 : new players come and get rekt -  you make everything available for $ -  they see they could and should pay to improve their performance in every way -  they leave and tell all their friends to never touch this p2w shit -  daed gaem \u2122, 
  i 'm gon na stop talking too , i ca n't get more obvious than this . 
   [ cis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commonwealth_of_independent_states ) death ramp, 
  ftfy, 
  no love for beethoven here ? 
  *** [ revamping intensifies ] ***, 
  honestly , if heat needs to die completely to allow ap and he to function properly - kill it , i do n't care . 
  so yeah , i like this set of changes . 
  the change i did n't like was ap . 
  so this fixes it pretty nicely actually . 
  damage not dps, 
  just make hossin lockable the way others are . 
  i thought it was `` caution emits showers of sparkles '' . 
  like , duh it 's a firework !, 
  it 's a rubber bus , it ca n't flip . 
  do n't see anything great there . 
  just a brainless fucking mob . 
  bring downvotes . 
  why gta3 feature is in this game is beyond me ... 
  it 's my first mlgpro mouse and so far it does great .
