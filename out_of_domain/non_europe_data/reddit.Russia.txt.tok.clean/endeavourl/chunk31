  bought it primarily for dpi settings , extra buttons and the way they are placed . 
  max ? 
  wow . 
  all valid points , 0 points ( 50 % upvoted ) ? 
  infantryside right here . 
  what they have to do is reduce nerfs to ammo cap by 50 % , unfuck duster and the 2 other noseguns , give zepher a purpose ( cause what the fuck is it good at right now ) . 
  maybe give them 30 minutes of uncut footage if they want it ? 
  it wo n't change any opinions of course but might be interesting to watch for other people . 
  and infuriating . 
   does it seem overly light to you, 
  not really , no . 
  about the same as my previous ( microsoft intellimouse 1.1 a ) . 
   i 'm also accidentally pressing mouse4 all the time . 
  yeah , that 's my main issue right now . 
  i got used to dpi and grip but still occasionally knife ( m4 ) air in front of me . 
   so you 're getting a large kill streak ( 12 for you , do n't know how many for your gunner ), 
  libs still counter galaxies ??!, 
  just add a role of beacon holder to the squad . 
  so you can have separate sl and someone else who can put a beacon ( with their own certs , it 's not that much ) . 
  for some reason that was very funny :d, 
  nc no-dot ? 
  you had me scared there for a second . 
  rip servers . 
  do you understand what `` anti-infantry '' and `` specialization '' mean ? 
   you had your fun and then abused it . 
  you got well over the investment in certs and rage so just remember the good old days, 
  that is not the thought process for game design and balance . 
  that 's it , never leaving warpgate ever again . 
  i know , teamwork , specialization , combined arms , i 'm all for it . 
  the point is you should * never * be damaged by a damage source you * can not * see . 
   printing any picture you want on shirts, 
   any picture you want, 
  pretty sure those businesses are already around . 
  \u0412\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0435\u0440 is taken by the russian server . 
  i 'd much rather they updated the chromium backend . 
  i 'd hate to alt tab to look at every linked picture/intel link/reddit thread/etc . 
  now clap . 
  also ,, 
   rt.com, 
  but anything with nsa in the title will get upvoted . 
   even though i do n't use coyotes , they are good and not really broken . 
  ppa + coyotes is definitely not broken . 
  do n't know what `` 2 years '' people here are talking about . 
  i played almost since release and never had any problems except :, 
  * loading stutters ( fixed ), 
  * freezes and ping spikes after density buff ( 100 % expected w / densities we used to have ; does n't happen now ), 
  * frame drops in rakkis ( localized and avoidable ), 
  * frame drops in a4 ( fuck a4 ), 
  * freezes during inventory loads in rifts ( fixed ), 
  these are literally all performance issues i had over 2 + years . 
  most have been fixed or are pretty minor/avoidable . 
  almost . 
  but nope . 
  ( yes i know about performance , i do n't care , i hate fog . 
  also use worse lods . ), 
   on top of that there are people who still use the zephyr after its nerf ? 
  yes . 
  i jump around as infantry and they already ca n't kill me . 
  it 's kind of sad really . 
  duster should be the ai cannon but i have yet to be killed by it . 
  zepher ... i do n't even know what its supposed role is now . 
  it 's kind of all-round but for it to work you must hang on the spot for 5 minutes while unloading all of your ammo on the stationary target . 
  he plays with macro . 
  also bind oos to a mouse button or something . 
  was that guy high or something ? 
  like , if there are ever two police officers aiming and firing warning shots at me -- i 'd think carefully about my every move and probably put my hands behind my head . 
  not throw some shit at them and try to run off . 
  wtf . 
  wtt carv-gauss saw, 
  https://www.google.com/search?q=poe+chicken+script some nice game design right here, 
  ~ balanced ~, 
  implying there are no logout macros . 
  resource boosts do n't allow you to infinitely pull vehicles . 
  this will ( combined with cooldown removal ) . 
  i 'll probably reconsider buying 6 months premium . 
  they 'll have other income sources after all ~ ~ ~, 
  you do n't get resources being inactive . 
  ^ i 'd ^ gladly ^ take ^ those ^ guys ' ^ places ^ in ^ the ^ hell ^ that ^ switzerland ^ is ^ / s, 
   that new players might have a much easier time getting used to the noseguns and hoverfighting if the projectiles would behave more realistically, 
  why do you think accounting for one extra ( or more if strafing ) variable in leading is much easier ? 
   if you chase someone and shoot , you wouldnt have to lead nearly as much as you have to now . 
  buff jumping , you say ? 
   if you move at the same speed as the enemy, 
  what about a proper dogfight ? 
  that 's russia for you . 
  chase them to the ground and kill them if it bothers you so much . 
  nanoweave on everything except av/aa ha and engineer when driving tanks/other explosive situations . 
  so it 's situational , really . 
  i started using suppressor on t5 amc about 3-4 months ago and just ca n't stop using it now on cougar too . 
  it 's such a nice addition to la for stealthy play , sitting somewhere hidden and shooting at mid-longer range . 
  makes it easier to lose chasers too . 
  nerf . 
  `` i got sniped by a tank because i hovered still for too long , tanks op . '', 
  i challenge you to find statements of pilots calling to nerf aa ap . 
  also flak should be nerfed cause that shit can kill you 1.5 hex away . 
  may be buff its damage up close but add falloff . 
  lockons are just a shit boring weapon system . 
  dalton nerf was pretty good imo ( except ammo nerf of course ) . 
  zepher was changed from `` okay everything good ai '' to `` mediocre to bad at everything '' . 
  shredder is in a similar spot where no one really knows what it 's supposed to do .
