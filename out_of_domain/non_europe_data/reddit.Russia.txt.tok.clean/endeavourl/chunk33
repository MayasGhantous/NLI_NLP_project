  lazy because * looking * and pressing buttons are exactly the same thing , right ? 
  also , is the game does n't have a clock you may forget to check it and miss some stuff . 
   like who care, 
   its like the 10th time i seen a thread like this, 
  apparently some people do care . 
  this and previous months like 70 % of the time i opened the sov map it had no changes for that day . 
  i wonder what an 8 minute video might contain ... 
  he survived for another like 30 seconds after taking a lockon after flares . 
  that 's actually wtf . 
  but yes , poor infantry they could n't do anything except being `` cheesed '' . 
  wow . 
  mob mentality sucks . 
   activision-blizzard, 
  so i see reedit still does n't know what a holding company is . 
  i 'm honestly puzzled how could they end up with such picture for the first thing you see when you try the game, 
  i do n't give a shit . 
  and i do n't worship anyone on a fucking website . 
  wow much logic, 
  because gta logic :\\, 
   it 's just a very poor use of screen real estate, 
   plus to search for whatever else you want all you have to do is type what you 're looking for . 
   mit opencourseware is the reason, 
  i love calculus . 
  open explorer and type it there ? 
  win + r ? 
  win + f ? 
  you do n't have to wait for the animation . 
  the logic will react to key presses instantly . 
  i did n't really get what you 're trying to open , but i typed win , `` pri '' , enter and it opened print management for me . 
   you just sneak up and kill the max while he is n't watching . 
  some say good question contains half the answer . 
  this is n't even a question . 
  it needs the same amount of tools as others :p, 
  no , it does . 
  it 's only fair . 
  looks like they could use some of that * zero tolerance * stuff ~ ~ ~, 
  reddit is suddenly all * thuper cereal * . 
  and there are a couple of upvoted comments appreciating the joke followed by a ton of `` creepy '' , `` stupid '' and other judgmental shit . 
  i do n't even . 
  they were made small . 
  too small imo . 
  i suppose that deci is the ap of rocket launchers and it kind of makes sense i guess . 
  walker buff is wat . 
  all great stuff but please reconsider drake and walker buffs , or at least make them more into minor tweaks . 
  otherwise galaxies and sundies will become * really * scary for all air . 
  yeah because its hero galaxies that protect poor peasants from evil esfs . 
  / sigh, 
   i wish the chase was how dogfighting worked, 
  chasing is not fighting . 
  when you chase someone they can not do anything to you and just hope for something else to help them ; they have already lost . 
  e : perhaps downvoters could explain how you kill something that shoots you from behind with a nosegun . 
  so you fly in a circle for 90 seconds and then oneclip a guy who tried to turn differently ? 
  much fun . 
  how do you expect to run away from something that can maintain approximately same speed as you ? 
  so this is downvoted to hell . 
  expect even more farming now-even-more-unkillable galaxies complaints next week . 
   i guess it 's just running away is very hard . 
  so what are you suggesting ? 
  i 'm still trying to grasp hitting anything within vehicle render range in under 1 second . 
  i guess we 'll find out what it 's like today/tomorrow ... 
  you know i can almost believe that this is their perverted sick way of balancing / o \\, 
  tomcats for max cheese . 
  and it should take 12 ap lightnings to take down a full sunderer , right ? 
  they 're fucking transports . 
  you can also buy vanity camos and decals only for $ . 
  such cash grab !, 
  make at least some sense or gtfo . 
  ps if you complained about cert tree without devolving into p2w accusations you would n't have been downvoted , just saying . 
  when people downvote from the profile page it does n't count . 
  my screen randomly froze ( except mouse pointer ) , i killed process , logged in and i 'm not in an outfit , have no friends , have no sc , have the lowest level of premium . 
  fubar, 
  also squad shows people dead/in a vehicle and vice versa when they 're not . 
  miller is up . 
  also https://twitter.com/dcarey7761/status/496742032426008577, 
   next server restarts : mattheson in 15 minutes , then connery in 30 , then briggs in 45 ( all time are estimates ) ; downtime will be minimal, 
  * candy *, 
  i dunno , i personally felt that rocket primaries were considerably less effective against me . 
  it 's not gone but it sure feels good when rocket primary fails to ohk you with splash . 
  alerts are probably only winnable via overpop . 
  not sure whether it 's bad or good . 
  previous version of locking alerts was worse imo . 
  beacon nerf is very stupid even more so as a stealth nerf . 
  did n't really notice that much of vehicle or max spam tbh . 
  again . 
  why the fuck people think it 's fun to be chased getting your ass shot ? 
  excellent summary . 
  saving for future use . 
  good . 
  one word : falloff . 
  i 'm really mediocre but i could chain pull with maxed timer unless i got a streak pd bad luck . 
  resources often were more of a problem . 
  people should n't mess with anyone 's testing , tell them next time . 
  drama/10 would rename again . 
  you sound mad . 
  this sucks because it 's uncontrollable , happens with all vehicles randomly , prevents you from repairing and kills you . 
  one giraffe was harmed in making of this video . 
  only in sundy . 
  if you 're serious , i 've literally `` just strolled '' from switzerland into germany and back numerous times . 
  and i 'm not even a swiss/eu citizen .
