  it seems you hate a lot of stuff . 
  i personally fly as engi . 
  but i enjoy this sorta mini-game `` kill the la with your nosegun '' , 
  + layout, 
  - colors, 
  whitespace is maybe a * bit * excessive . 
  i usually like / r/atheism posts for witty sarcasm but this is not one of those . 
  how is islam a death cult ? 
  how is christianity a death cult ? 
  people said nync was a paid fc for quite a while . 
  there 's a difference between module activation requirements code ( simple range check ) and the whole physics simulation code . 
  people bitching about exploit being fixed . 
  gaming communities ... 
  so you 'd like them to leave all as is for the years in which they 'll rewrite the pos and physics code ( and probably shorten server ticks ) ? 
  this version of exploit * was * fixed using the most efficient means available . 
  mine stopped saying `` welcome to planetside '' and few others for some reason . 
  any info on that ? 
  what 's the point of these kind of shitposts ? 
  i honestly do n't see it . 
  there 's a huge problem in the air game that get bigger every day but it 's like it makes most people happy . 
  so you do n't play air and do n't care for it ? 
  wow i did n't expect that . 
  why should you opinion matter then ? 
  how dare you to kill infantry with an ai weapon ?? 
  i do n't know what timezone you 're living in but rocketpods were nerfed * a long * time ago . 
  he should get better and improve his skills . 
  fuel tanks make you better at evading damage . 
  except you can not evade aimbot missiles . 
  except ai weapons have counters , like * walls and ceiling / gasp *, 
  a2am and coyotes do not . 
  happens regularly ( t_t ), 
  this started happening a lot more in the recent 2 months or so . 
  well then go full retard and make lock-on tank secondaries and sniper rifles . 
  skill is overrated anyway . 
  do you have anything to say on the point ? 
  evebet above zkb/eve-kill ? 
  wow finally a good and obvious explanation buried under a shitton of hate and * ~ opinions ~ * . 
  ramming is less fun than a proper fight , the end . 
  on the other hand getting rammed means that a ) your opponent was afraid of you which is nice b ) you can work more on your maneuvering, 
  it 's just a historical name from early descriptions . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_cancer ( 1st chapter 2nd paragraph ), 
  i re-read the title like 5 times . 
   why should infantry care if their day gets messed up because of coyotes ? 
  nobody asks you anyway , why do you think infantry only players ' opinions matter in a2a balance discussions ? 
  it says something about the product when its community has their own full blown bugtracker ... / o \\, 
  qa 's overrated amiright ? 
  edit : i 'm sorry but i 'm fucking pissed after last weekend where i 've been killed literally tens of times by esf/vehicle `` ejection seat '' bug over a session no longer than 4 hours . 
  please circlejerk more . 
  very nice video . 
  good music , good pacing , interesting footage . 
   `` your analogy was terrible because flying is special and we are special snowflakes . 
  nothing compares , ever . 
  flying is unique and special . '', 
  your analogy was terrible because none of the tanks have aimbot weapons . 
  i personally would like soe to introduce some , because think of the ~ ~ children ~ ~ noobs being farmed by pros !!!, 
  ! 1111 amiright ? 
  how many hits does it take to kill infantry with fuel pods ? 
  hint : it is * impossible * to outrun tomcats if the owner follows you . 
  just remove the fucking annoying crafting animation and sound . 
  trolling will definitely solve the problem , keep at it ^ you ^ retard, 
  in russia we already did this '' \u043e\u0442\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0442\u044c '' ( take away [ from rich ] and share [ between poor ] ) thing . 
  it fucking sucked . 
  just saying . 
  it sucks but at least the zone is n't too large ( i think it 's only the jumppad and the small adjacent square ) . 
  what 's cheesy about c4 ` ing clumps of infantry ? 
  and you still dipped into ~ 38 fps . 
  i sometimes even go below 35 w / 4770k and gtx770 :(, 
   mostly that you 'd have no chance against a better pilot regardless of loadout . 
  but think of the ~ ~ children ~ ~ new pilots !!, 
  soe should make coyotes built-in into esf hull , might as well finish off the airgame , at least noobs will be able to compete , right ? 
   might as well remove ap from tanks as well , because i ca n't fight an ap/halberd mbt without another one . 
  please remind me when were ap/halberd changed to aimbot mechanics of lockons/coyotes ? 
  or are just repeating that bullshit ~ parody ~ post ? 
  you nailed it , it 's lock on mechanics . 
  they all are skilless , boring and overpowered ( i guess av one at least does n't set your tank on fire in 2 hits ) . 
  also , as many pointed out , currently esf secondaries are outdamaging primaries ( with not much skill required ) . 
  they are complete and total joke . 
  i actually mentally shuddered at the image of ihub grinding . 
  it needs to go . 
  why did you even bother anyway ? 
  i 'd upvote but `` nullified dictors '' - lolnope . 
  t2 med armor rep reaches to 55 something km and adds some more rep power . 
  not fully cap stable but works for burst repping . 
  they always get smartbombed/bombed t_t, 
  vanity items ( you only get most of them for sc ) and account wide ( not faction bound ) weapons if you * really * want them now . 
  boosts , maybe , although if you 're buying membership it will give you 50 % xp and something % resources itself . 
  nobody is allowed to use anti-infantry weapons to kill infantry , ever . 
  show me on this doll where evil farmer touched you . 
  i actually thought of putting a gun there but in a proper fight you wo n't have the time to manage it anyway and in other situations drones usually work . 
  pl does n't actually hold space , that blob is their renters . 
  nobody lives there except a few people . 
  on a serious note in these kind of thread i see a lot of people who blame the players when they should blame the game . 
  disable ocsp checks , it 's been said numerous times that it is useless . 
  ex : https://www.reddit.com/r/operabrowser/comments/2gdyo9/opera_1217_how_to_fix_error_1066_ocsp_error/ckjw67b, 
  you can look in the developer tools which css does n't load ( and causes broken page style ) . 
   i did rinse it off with plenty of water , since it does get more concentrated as the water evaporates, 
  errr ... actually hydrogen chloride is a gas which evaporates first from the solution . 
  you should use ventilation while working with concentrated solutions for that reason . 
  the smell alone is bad enough . 
  nah , it was figured out a while ago .
