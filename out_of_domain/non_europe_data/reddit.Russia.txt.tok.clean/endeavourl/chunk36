  i just did like 3 clicks in gimp to see if op bothered to erase it . 
  what is that lumi/armor ? 
  sexy as fuck . 
  performance probably . 
  yep and it 's slightly encrypted too . 
  there 're links to expalation on failheap challenge in this thread , check them out . 
  suddenly eve is interesting as fuck !!!, 
  i 'm excited !, 
  i 've entered into nullsec 2 times as a noob recruit , via m-oe and lxq . 
  i traversed vast null areas ( including entries ) in a fucking executioner . 
   people wont buy cosmetics if other people can toggle them off . 
  that 's arguable at best . 
  i want an actual * cool looking * helmet . 
  is it hard ? 
  wtf is this crying for newbros not been ng able to teleport to home system ? 
  fucking explain them the methods to pass gate capms , burn back to the gate , avoid bubbles . 
  it 's like everyone so fucking lazy . 
  in my time i was relying on videos to go through null for the first time . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's better now than shoot me standing in the open field aiming ha it was . 
  u/thebluedoughnutsucks complains about power projection nerf . 
  the irony . 
  god damn , newbies are spoiled these days . 
  i still do n't see a major problem in learning to enter and navigate nullsec in a fast agility fitted frigate . 
  with some luck/foresight - in an interceptor even . 
  a friend explained to me on skype how buubbles work , and linked a couple of videos of people roaming ( not fight montages , just an unedited video with commentary ) . 
  it should be presented better to new people but calling podex an absolutely mandatory feature for newbies is stupid . 
  have n't been there for ages but if your own entry system is bubbled to hell - it 's your own problem . 
  also in xix , when we lived in 1a8 3 jump bridges deep into drones , we used to personally help and guide new guys from paala - lxq entry . 
   do you see newbies as an advantage of one alliance or another that should be balanced ? 
  what ? 
  no , not at all . 
  it 's just for me personally teleporting new guys deep into safety of your 0.0 space feels like breastfeeding at the age of 8 or something . 
  yep . 
  it finally hit me too . 
  i 'm sure there 's been some coding resources wasted on this pumpkin bullshit . 
  more server merges . 
  briggs on life support/dead . 
  the most fun and rush i had was 3v5 in bcs and shit . 
   we always prioritize fixing major performance bugs , crashes , hitches, 
  well , from an outsider 's / player 's perspective it just is n't working . 
  i upgraded my pc a year ago , and one of the major thoughts behind its spec ( 4770k and gtx770 ) was to play this game lag-free . 
  seeing it ** consistently ** drop to 35 fps regardless of game settings for the ** past 8 + months ** with no improvement in sight is heartbreaking and sad . 
  144hz monitor is pretty useless too because it happens only in empty warpgate . 
  looks like a good ol' reddit witchhunt to me . 
  done that in a thanatos . 
  90 minutes of relaxed scanning guaranteed . 
  so you have a phd in gaming or something ? 
  so is this another one of those `` nerf skill '' threads ? 
  it 's been nerfed already , buy coyotes . 
  that was heavy , heavy sarcasm . 
   reserve maneuvers bring nothing interesting to the game . 
  i feel that you should apply to design position at soe . 
   i actually quite enjoy the battlefield air game . 
  flying in circles for 5 minutes ? 
   easy to track your enemy and keep you gun on target, 
   esf, 
  nothing really * that * good . 
  it 's just fun . 
  meanwhile people are successfully dogfighting in stock ( or close ) esfs . 
  it takes skill . 
  not much . 
  this is a `` parody '' to [ another `` parody '' post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/2hf06m/parody_the_state_of_connerys_tank_game_tank_meta/ ) . 
  wear flak . 
  look around . 
  do n't allow an esf to the range at which it literally ca n't miss you . 
   i 'd love an explanation as to why wasd is preferred aside from `` i 'm just used to it . '', 
  i 'm lazy , 
  i used esdf in [ freelancer ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freelancer_%28video_game%29 ) because i lacked keybinds but when you swap to it you need to reinvent all of your binds from scratch and for most games it 's too much effort . 
  you keep using these words but you do n't know what they mean . 
  there are very few aces and/or skyknights left on miller . 
  what we do have are lock-on ganksquads and coyote users thanks to soes awesome stance on the air balance . 
  when you 're fighting up in the air or running at low hp or trying to get some cover and some skyguard from a hex away decides to shoot you there 's not much time to call for an ap lightning support . 
  and yes , they do kill you from over a hex away . 
  needs falloff . 
  but wo n't get it because soe hates air . 
  not sure if ... 
  did n't work . 
  still 40fps in 96 + on 4770k/770gtx . 
  e : re-read the ops and yeah i guess this addresses hitching not low fps . 
  hitching went back to almost zero for me after the logging patch . 
  no it does n't . 
  it is extremely harder for people not having access to source code/internal tools/docs to find these kind of fixes . 
  in this particular case op was very lucky to look at the right place . 
  source : software developer . 
  yes , it gives it somewhat of a boost . 
  there 's a difference between users reporting/reproducing bugs and a user that finds a thread in a live process ( ! ), 
  that can safely be killed ( !! ), 
  that resolves a major performance bottleneck ( !!!, 
   so what you think at low hp you should be able to kill the aa tank ? 
   skyguard from a hex away decides to shoot you, 
   they do kill you from over a hex away . 
   over a hex away, 
   hex away, 
  i did n't say anything about killing an aa tank . 
  i said that their range and damage at that range are ridiculous . 
  may i suggest to ... 
  #b u f f t h e s a r o n, 
  i will laugh so hard if they 'll get balls to nuke your fucking shield . 
  throw a sticky in there . 
  way to ruin an otherwise entertaining submission .
