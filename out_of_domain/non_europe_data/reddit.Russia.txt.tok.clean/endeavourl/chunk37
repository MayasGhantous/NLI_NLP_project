  can you guys hold your ** grrrrrr coalitions ** just for one more month ? 
  i heard there 's going to be a patch , you know , that may introduce a ~ small change ~ to the way nullsec works . 
  instead of making these pointless threads trying to encourage a big bloc to fight a big bloc . 
  which will * not * happen under current mechanics because of effort , risk and stuff . 
  that 's called feedback . 
  i personally kinda stopped playing after the pumpkin patch . 
  lockons give no warning 50 % of the time after the patch . 
  being spoonfed citizens ... 
  man , fuck this alliance . 
  nah , it totally cleans your soul through reincarnation and stuff / s, 
  [ i guess i should upgrade now ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2tqdl1g.png ), 
  fixes  new stuff for minorities . 
  maybe it 's fine in concept . 
  it 's pretty non-fun though . 
  why are all these threads downvoted ? 
  lol, 
  all right i 'm gon na go to bed and cry now because of how bad i was at this during my childhood . 
  seriously though this is the best video i watched in a long time , 
  no propmod, 
  moving to your target when you do n't have line of sight with a ranged skill is a downright dumb mechanic . 
  not syncing that explicitly is even dumber . 
  ramming would be fine if the rammer always died along with the rammed . 
  this is often not the case though , especially with scythes ( hate their horns ) . 
  every time a see a ` dcu ' mentioned i think of drone control units . 
  that is true for 1v1s . 
  this is getting retarded . 
  and * every * one of these threads was downvoted below 35 % . 
  seriously guys it 's not secret ( as if it ever was after that bot mail ) , you can stop downvoting now . 
  what is there to fix ? 
  edit : i guess we need to fix downvotes because they 're the only answer that was given . 
  ps still do n't see what 's wrong there . 
  this thread tempts me to go and see this `` benchmark '' for myself . 
  any actual systems to check ? 
  / r/connery / ? 
  in our small outfit we often log in to do dailies ( spelling ? ), 
  of stay late to get the next five . 
  so we 're influenced by them . 
  i guess they * can * be communicated better though . 
  nitric acid gets it off quite easily . 
  'em press ' was the title , i think . 
  opera 12 crashes like hell for me on w8 .1 . 
  i tried reinstalling , changins setting , config , nothing helps . 
  it 's even more weird because it works fine for a friend on w8 . 
  actually now that i think of it i may try the usb installation . 
  edit : so after a year of crashes i finally remembered ( thanks to u/drgaz ) that i have had this problem sometime earlier and fixed it by disabling tls 1.1 / 1.2 . 
  it 's sad that i had to endure a year of browser crashes due to my forgetfulness , but hey at least it works again . 
  i personally ca n't stand low scroll-zoom granularity so hold-both-buttons-zoom all the way . 
  # n e r f t h e l i b, 
  new bitching meta : unlimited bubbles on a gate . 
  next up : unlimited number of people in a system ? 
  yay infantryside !, 
   i even wins against a fucking burster max . 
  a bad one , yes . 
  did you account for flak range , splash and the max strafing in your math ? 
  maybe they should n't allow the banshee within 100m when using a weapon with effective range of 500 + ? 
  every time i kill a burster max is when they are oblivious to me until i start shooting . 
   decrease the air damage it does, 
  only bads die to banshee while using a proper nosegun . 
   it can out dps a burster max , its direct counter . 
  burster range is 500 + . 
  banshee effective range is like 100m . 
  also composite armor + banshee esf is a direct counter to your max too . 
  and it sucks against air ( as it should ) . 
  ramming is even faster !, 
  nerf rams !, 
  remove esfs !, 
  delete airgame !, 
   you shoot at it laughing as you 're probably screaming `` die motherfucker ! '', 
  at your monitor . 
  the mossie turns around . 
  `` nope ! '', 
  the mossie says . 
  and the burster max is dead . 
  if a properly equipped max shoots first at a mossie that is not going straight for the max - the mossie either runs or dies . 
  this is a fact . 
  calling it now : ah . 
  in ~ 3 months . 
   the duster, 
  i 've been killed by it like what ... three times since it 's release ? 
  and it 's not like it 's been this way for the past 2 years ~ ~, 
  anything soe just does n't trigger a positive reaction anymore . 
  another case of yellow-brownish flame ( besides solid fuels and kerosene ) would be udmh + n2o4 fuel , e.g. 
  in proton rockets . 
  is it me or is reddit trying to justify mafia harassment , death threats and murder itt ? 
  also this : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heart_of_a_dog, 
   crashes and thrashing of your cpu are not good for it . 
  you 're risking thermal damage and voltage damage by putting high throughput through the electronics . 
  do n't spread nonsense . 
   a light slap on the wrist to one weapon on one vehicle is pitiful . 
  he 's actually talking about the he/heat nerfs . 
  i believe soe counts on that majority of players just forgets about it . 
  `` what do you mean ` reducing lethality across the board ' ? 
  we 've never heard of this . '', 
  yes . 
  more morphine , life support to the full capacity . 
  everything is fine . 
  youtube comments are leaking . 
  now all mbt ai secondaries are terrible . 
  yay , balance !, 
  now we just need to nerf the esf ai and of course the liberator and rocket pods and everything will be great !,
