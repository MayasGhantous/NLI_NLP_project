  i think it 's a feature but the sound is weird . 
  hauled expensive shit in an inty thinking about being smartbombed . 
  i got smartbombed . 
  jumped a titan into lxq and barely made it back . 
   stealth and flares are very good counters . 
  would you people stop being delusional . 
  it 's also funny how every op 's comment itt had downvotes . 
  dunno all i saw was excellent fighting with 5 + reavers consecutively , multiple at times . 
  what . 
  the . 
  i do not understand this . 
  why , why in every fucking discussion about ** air to air mechanics ** there are a bunch of ground players who try to make some point which is ** completely irrelevant to the topic of the discussion ? 
  why ? 
  you described fighting a noob lock-on user . 
  tip : if you want to fine tune your cut point with arrow keys use them with alt - it makes them go over i-frames ( key frames , that 's where the cut is possible without re-encoding the video ) . 
  new goal : keep my current clone until rhea release . 
  how do supers fight subcaps nowadays ? 
  semi-legit question . 
  i run a windows server with uptimes usually going into months . 
  i used to run my pc with week + uptimes until it became too noisy for me to sleep in the same room . 
  my friend still does this . 
  people who claim you need a daily pc restart are either incompetent or have a poorly managed system . 
  better yet , use [ process explorer ] ( http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx ) . 
  is this a one-time occurrence ? 
  then it 's just a runaway memory leak , i 'd forget about it until it shows next time . 
  if it happens regularly then the problem may very well be on your end . 
  that 's actually the number one reason for ~ 1 month uptimes  if i 'm not lazy/forget to approve new updates . 
  haha , nice one !, 
   are n't liberator 's more effective at countering infantry balls ? 
  not after the nerf . 
  air in general ca n't do much against a sufficiently big infantry ball with coordinated aa . 
  is it eve online sov warfare or a fair fight club \u2122 you guys are playing ? 
  i swear if any other alliance would 've whined every week about how they ca n't do anything against pl and how supers are op against them - that alliance would 've already disbanded from pure public humiliation . 
  fucking htfu already , you look like 12yo schoolgirls . 
  edit : basically what this guy said https://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/2lqcnd/sorry_we_blueballed_you_for_an_ihub_shield_timer/clxe9rr, 
  edit 2 : because downvotes will surely change the nature of eve . 
  the sooner you wake up the better for you it will be . 
  you will remember me saying this at some point later * : sov is shit . 
  * provided ccp wo n't fix it by then . 
  p. good analysis and advices for newbros , except one thing : i 'll believe in solar taking catch from bni when i 'll actually see it happening , 
   i was really excited about taking sov at the beginning of the year . 
  now you know . 
  such an awesome video , downvoted ... y u do dis / r/planetside, 
  looks like [ this ] ( http://images.mmorpg.com/images/galleries/full/312008/322c9d29-db56-4f12-8e81-30505459d9c4.jpg ) tbh . 
  then have some dogfighting ? 
  goddamn , this guy draws so much butthurt it 's kinda funny . 
  let me show you something :, 
  this is what supers used to do . 
  comparing that to some supers that did 36 % of the total damage along with a shitton of railgus ** to a bs ** ( the largest subcap hull fyi ) is laughable . 
  edit : fixed some links, 
  it is usually associated with xxxmlg420noscopezxx cod kids . 
  i personally prefer to call us by the ticker name , xix . 
  edit : and pizza 's name is just a good pun i believe , 
  it was even fixed for a brief 2-4 week period after the death screen update or something . 
  and then it broke again . 
  this . 
  this is most puzzling and weird of all things to do with air . 
  all those discussions , videos , opinions and whatnot , and the ** only ** response from devs in 6 + months is a 1 second coyotes reload nerf . 
  no posts , no acknowledgements , no nothing . 
  did n't ask for your shitty opinion . 
  we want an official response to some legit questions . 
  and ( shockingly ) with no response there will only be more `` bitching '' . 
  are zergs teamplay ? 
  all vehicles render at 1km to each other i believe . 
  just imagine like * crazy * powerful vertical thrusters underneath your aircraft ? 
  ( making gas jets there bigger and more `` violent '' might actually help with immersion ), 
  it 's so ironic tbh . 
  tankers and infantry often complain how their tools are similar to those used in wwii , often they 're right . 
  and finally there 's something futuristic , out of the box and fun ( air mechanics ) and it 's suddenly bad for the game , no one can use it , no fun and such and such . 
  since i play eve i 'd actually like that change , but i guess not many others would ... 
  hey , let 's not forget white noise and red alliance oldbros , 
  we used to use the word ` carebear ' and still do , but ` crab ' is shorter and funnier . 
  idgaf about this personally . 
  that header always gets me :d, 
  so i take it he 's not going to play wod ? 
  ( or any other game for that matter ) no point in resubbing or following again then . 
  i used to , then i could n't take it anymore and just unfollowed , unsubbed from youtube and closed the stream . 
  it 's so drawn out , cringe-worthy and just yells sellout at you . 
  just shows you what kripp has become . 
   you have become everything you ridiculed in the past . 
  and this is what really got me . 
  i 'd be fine with brofisting or whatever , but only 2 years ago he would 've laughed at and humiliated the shit out of his today self . 
  unfollowed and unsubbed , that was enough sellout for me . 
  drf ( also called solar legion of red noise after the 4 principal alliances ) times was my most active time in eve and i can say for sure that on average member level all alliances contributed about the same . 
  and wn were leading the coalition in terms of fcing strategic ops . 
  no reverse maneuver . 
  it just needs to remember the * last used * spawn instead of choosing the closest one . 
  how hard can that be , soe ? 
  what ? 
  there 's no reverse maneuver in warthunder is what i meant . 
  tbh i was very wary of her crazy new ideas at first and i still am a bit , but so far - flawless delivery . 
  who decided they needed tengus at 6am msk time / o \\, 
   he will for sure, 
  well , maybe because it 's 0100 ( am ) monday night in rutz ? 
  just saying . 
  1080p gifs are stupid , even with gfycat . 
  use youtube for that shit . 
  it definitely changed the way we move around . 
  no more taking 5 + jump/titan bridges in a row . 
  also some members could n't make jumps and skipped ctas because of accumulated fatigue , and most members prepare in advance for posted ctas .
