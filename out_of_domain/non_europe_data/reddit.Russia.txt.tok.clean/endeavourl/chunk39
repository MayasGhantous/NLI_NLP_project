  this may impact the ability to rage-formup and move out in short timeframe because not everyone may be able to take the necessary jumps . 
  we have yet to see how ability of alliances to deploy for extended periods has changed . 
  is mid-twenties an adult ? 
  gaming , lots of gaming , preferably pvp . 
  also traveling once in a while . 
  this needs more visibility . 
  i feel bad for ticino and graub\u00fcnden . 
  also vanu and nc crosshair and hud colors are n't visible on amerish and indar respectively . 
  with the normal yaw rates how are people convinced that this would be usable ? 
  nobody feels shame dying to mlgyotes . 
  they can be effective in 3rd person ffs . 
   actually all banshee/ah/lppa is cheesy, 
  / r/infantryside, 
  you mean flak and lockons ? 
   what can an infantry do against a banshee , ah or lppa ? 
  not be bad and shoot it . 
  equip flak arm or and bursters . 
  notice a mossie . 
  let it close but not too close . 
  shoot it . 
  if shot at - strafe . 
  proceed to create a hex wide no-fly zone . 
  but of course you can continue saying that poor infantries has no options . 
   ya . . sounds like a ton of fun . 
  getting a couple esfs flying by . . plinking at them and never coming back because they know you 're there . 
  planes * flying away * from their counter , how dare they ?!, 
   not like the ttk of a banshee against a max is less than 1s too . 
  did you actually try it in real environment ? 
  or do you refer to that shitty-ass ` demonstration ' against a stock stationary max that does n't shoot back using a near-stationary esf ? 
  edit : every downvote means `` no i did n't try it i just want to nerf my opponents '', 
  every attempt to kill an aa max with a banshee is a gamble . 
  and before you say that it should n't be so - yes it should , because while that max is a direct counter to an a2g esf the opposite is also true . 
  / r/infantryside, 
  while lppa is up compared to the other two ai cannons , yes , it would 've been even better in this particular situation . 
  but please op , more tears . 
  ai weapon destroying clumped balls of infantry in an open environment with no counters being present . 
  working as intended . 
   you switch back to, 
  ai loadout , farm . 
  suit yourself then . 
  maxes do have this ability nonetheless . 
  if an a2g esf is greeted by flak in every place ( which is a normal thing at prime-time ) you need to either ditch it completely or go yolo and try to get some kills befor getting eventually destroyed . 
  the first part is not necessarily true . 
  the second one is 100 % . 
  if this game is not enough evidence just look at / r/starcraft . 
  standard , b for exit vehicle . 
  maybe because amarr primary weapon systems are of energy type , gallente have plasma , caldari - missiles , and minmatar - projectiles ? 
  gjallarhorn looks exactly like other projectile ( esp . 
  artillery ) weapons in the game with a larger scale . 
  i for one really enjoy this consistency of designs in eve . 
  the sound could use some loudness probably . 
  yeah , always ( almost ) use arrows , the omnidirectional drag box thingy is too unpredictable . 
  also shift . 
  huge part of the game in any fleet fight . 
  also as the guy above said , whs . 
  what really matters is : what shirt did he wear while doing it ? 
  is that a. . . rhea ? 
  too bad most of those will be chat channels . 
  is reddit on power trip or something ? 
   this fee is waived for activation with cd-key , etc , and plex . 
  because plex and etc already have activation fee in their price : they cost $ 20 per month . 
  a bat is a kinetic energy weapon too . 
  from a sci-fi physics pov the only weapons ( in the game ) that does n't hurtle some form of matter at the target are lasers ( hence `` energy weapons '' ) . 
  if only it did n't crash :(, 
  or the starting part on the skyscraper planet ( name ? ), 
  did n't bore me to death after so many times . 
  after playing through dantooine several times i think i 'm prepared for any kind of shitty controls . 
  it had a rendering bug which reduced fps to < 5 in certain locations on geforce fx cards . 
  i actually liked that place exactly for it 's creepiness . 
  and the game as a whole ( even in its unfinished state ) due to this creepy atmosphere of death , deterioration and decay . 
  i , of course , do n't know much of the inner workings , but could you guys just restrict the exit point to the plain of the vehicle wheels ? 
  and possibly to the plain of the roof . 
  like set a check in the algorithm that the exit point ** must ** belong to one of those two planes ? 
  i had a strategy : face a wall as much as possible and make a coffee when running across a field :d, 
   almost , ... loneliness , for some reason . 
  yep , exactly . 
  do n't know if it was intentional or not but it was done well . 
  t1 logis are pretty good but have a hard time surviving ( expectedly ) . 
  needs longer web ( at least ) . 
  i prefer a lockon sniper rifle that has a chance to shoot through walls analogy . 
  * because that 's exactly what a2a lockons are . 
  viper : another shining example of soe overnerf . 
  iirc it was , similar to the lib , nerfed worse than it was before it was buffed . 
  the flash ( a quadricycle ) is now more stable than a cross-terrain reinforced buggy . 
  harasser needs the same or similar treatment . 
  hurr there 's a list of space-objects on your screen game ca n't be good, 
  *** so *** tired of this ... 
  on the eve-kill note : what 's up with this : https://www.facebook.com/evekillkillboard/posts/614450501998536 ? 
   why are so many people proud of not having social skills, 
  because fuck social skills ? 
  i do n't see any point in wasting time at a party or a club instead of doing something more interesting on the internet ( education/games/even reddit ) . 
  i thought higby said it on his stream ? 
  i was too lazy to look through laggy twitch vods . 
  why the fuck do you think you have the right to judge how and with whom it is `` healthy '' for me to spend my free time ? 
  fuck you . 
  so you 're calling a major type of people 's psychology `` bullshit '' ? 
   chance, 
   can meet, 
   can become, 
   take your chance,
