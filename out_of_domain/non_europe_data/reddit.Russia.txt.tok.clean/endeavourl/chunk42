  if i did a low approach it would depend on max 's movement patterns and general reaction time . 
  in the process i could 've taken a dumbfire , a tankshell , a second max , whatever else . 
  what i 'm saying it 's not nearly a guaranteed kill and a shutdown for enemy maxs as people make it out to be . 
  speaking of which , in this thread there 's a hilarious statement about banshee 's effective range of 700m . 
  others have claimed that banshee instagibs from 300m . 
  things are made up on the spot just to fuel the nerf-rage and having claims that banshee always wins against maxs does n't help . 
  on the lumi , that thing has a render range of something like 100m anyway . 
  i like it on so i keep it on . 
  from this webcam : http://zuerichtourismus.roundshot.ch/uetliberg, 
  i thought they capped at 10k ? 
  i 'm sure this is only a part that was intended to be pre-revealed . 
  max : maybe i should move ? 
   use this as reference . 
  it 's even funnier than usual , because if those bursters shot at the attacking esf the ttk on it would be pretty much the same as a reverse one . 
  as someone who just certed into a magrider : this please . 
  people confirmed retards . 
  as if a biolab was n't a bottleneck enough ... they removed the shields from teleporters and also sundies can not be placed under the dome where tps are . 
  lame . 
  is having a job in iceland really that bad ? 
  all these losses ... 
  i miss soundwave :(, 
  you can watch 2013 and ( maybe ) 2012 fanfest keynotes , hilmar talked a bit about their beginnings . 
   but for god 's sake , even i can get away from one dual burster max . 
  so esf flies away , what 's the problem ? 
  drive it away until in does n't have anywhere to go . 
  but if a vanguard has stealth there 's literally no way to not start a fight with 60 % of your hp gone . 
  especially for prowlers since they are often stationary/immovable . 
  this is such bullshit !, 
  i do n't care . 
  it 's annoying as fuck . 
  if anything it shows that it 's even more broken : the tank that feels so unfair to fight in other tanks also performs badly . 
   they nerfed the shield so that a volley into the rear disables the shield from a 2/2 mbt . 
  if you go head to head at 5m with a vanguard and die then you 're an idiot, 
  well what am i supposed to do in a prowler ? 
  play 800m range artillery as others do ? 
  fuck that , that 's the reason i rarely pull a tank i spent 10k certs on . 
   30 seconds, 
   that 's the problem . 
  well that 's your problem . 
  use counters . 
  and no , bursters should n't instagib faster than they already do . 
  plane flies away ? 
  well it 's a fucking plane that 's what it does . 
  if there 's enough antiair it will go another place . 
  if antiair is everywhere - it either leaves or dies in a reckless attack . 
  launched it at work earlier today , it worked fine . 
  ubuntu 12.04 , wine 1.7, 
  oneiros is awesome !, 
   a 2/2 locked prowler and a 2/2 vannie have identical ttk 's on each other so if its a slugfest it 's down to first shot . 
  i know , i actually have had a couple of fights where we and a vanguard killed each other . 
  but there 's most often a delay on the deploy , which is even worse if you 're moving ( basically you lose at that moment ) . 
  last 2 releases before this one downloaded at like 40kb/s , no idea why :(, 
  thankfully this one took like 10 minutes . 
  to ccp : blur should be a slider too . 
  edit : and always keep rendering brackets ( not sure if possible but needed ) . 
   stealth, 
  dat 20k undercut . 
  buuurrrnnnn, 
  then give wallhack . 
  how should i see what is hidden behind a hill ? 
  or be straight up psychic . 
  you 're retarded . 
  so help me . 
  amerish . 
  i 'm trying to flank , driving in low hills . 
  suddenly behind me a vanguard pops from behind a hill and starts the `` fight '' by halving my hp . 
  i 'm dead before i can even lockdown . 
  how do i fix this ? 
  ppa and zoe level of underpowered ? 
  are n't they already ? 
  who would 've thought that an ai gun should be effective against infantry . 
  silly people ! ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ / s / s / s, 
  the most sad thing about all these overnerfs is that soe encourages revenge-based excuses , where players use hate of others factions ' weapons to justify * any * balance changes . 
  * it was too good , so it must be made into shit . 
  * fuck you , % opweapon % users . 
  etc etc etc, 
  this is not balancing , this is fucking monkeys banging their heads against keyboards . 
   alright fucknuts , get in your ships , shut the fuck up , and get your asses over here you and then kill yourselves you fucking retards . 
  did this hurt your feelings ? 
  they 're obviously not serious . 
  it 's just one way of talking in a closed , possibly tight-knit , group . 
  edit : thanks for downvotes guys . 
  i just explained a bit of psychology behind this . 
  mordu 's legion seems to work best for me . 
  your analogy is not even analogous , so do n't even know what to answer . 
  i tested it too . 
  it would n't have been bad if you were n't limited to ** 2 kills per maxed mag ** ( realistic kills , not shove-it-in-your-mouth kills ) . 
  fuck balance , nerf everything into the ground !, 
  hmmm ... maybe it 's that elusive case where the rule that any video that is recorded in a game actually belongs to the devs of that game * will do some good ? 
  * as i understand it is this way , and there was a major concern about a year ago about the ( technical ) ability of game companies to dmca videos of their game . 
  or maybe i 'm full of shit , idk . 
  there 's no `` gtfo v '' ingame . 
  it 's very useful though . 
  wtb ess 'd systems list, 
  ccp , we understand the purpose of nullsec music . 
  dark , ominous etc etc. 
  ** but it still sucks ** , because it 's not , honestly , music . 
  i personally always fly with music muted and i tried otherwise several times . 
  it just irritates . 
   why a futuristic , fantasy engineer would want to create something that like is beyond me .
