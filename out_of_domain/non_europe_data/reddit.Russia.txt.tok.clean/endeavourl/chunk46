  you mean where they made it actually render on low settings ? 
  why do you pull an av tank though ? 
  it 's a slow process , but i already see how he/heat nerfs have reduced overall number of tanks and tank battles and it will continue . 
  yay more matti hate, 
  motion spotters are borderline op, 
  fuck off to / r/infantryside, 
  minmatar frigate v because claw ( and hound ), 
  who are the `` you '' ? 
  because i 'm certainly not fine with ppa or most of soe nerfs . 
  i 'd like to see at least some tank2tank lock ons , they need to threee-shot it and go through cover . 
  you know ... to spread the ~ balance ~, 
  first you need to let go of any sorts of cover , then we 'll talk . 
  lock on sniper rifles : do it . 
  the actual question is how the fuck does these statistics happen ? 
  wow ... :d, 
   go somewhere else, 
  you mean cobalt or emerald ? 
  get that sweet srp . 
  i agree that you should 've killed them in this case ( and improved your virus stats ) . 
  but sometimes it 's just like this : * every * click reveals a 90/20 or 60/40 , leaving you just completely fucked by rng . 
  hate when that happens . 
  why did you have to block his tank 's rear ? 
  needs 10 tabs of dotlan . 
  so you 're saying caps should n't be moved * at all * ? 
  they did n't try to `` be everywhere '' , they had a single move op . 
  should caps be removed from the game or something ? 
  well that 's exactly what i and other people here are saying . 
  there needs to be a balance between `` all of eve in 10 minutes '' and `` complete pita '' . 
  one obvious thing the current system does n't account for is that travelling gates with large fleets is filled with stupid amount of tidi each jump . 
  out of curiosity , did you guys move in one or multiple ( shudder ) runs ? 
  because for one run this mixed route looks pretty good : http://i.imgur.com/reaftry.png, 
  armor ( including esfs ) does n't take splash damage , right ? 
  and that 's what they changed . 
  prism was so good to get value of your assets , grouped by stations , ships , containers etc. 
  i hope someone will pick up maintaining it again . 
  and here i am , 4770k@4.5ghz, 16gb 1600mhz , gtx770 - regularly dipping into 40fps in big fights , cpu bound . 
  out of curiosity , does `` one ship '' include a loaded carrier ? 
   a valkyrie getting constantly and simultaneously repaired by 4 engineers, 
  so engaging and fun !, 
  such gameplay !, 
  very effective against an aa loadout . 
   breaking all laws of physics ... 
   that \u00b4 s why he wrote libs should be a bit stronger again . 
  which will never happen . 
  remind me what year is it in the game ? 
  `` teabagging '' is the most retarded thing you could do in a video game . 
  why people think it 's funny is beyond me . 
  and this will fix the airgame how ? 
  aaaaaand ... he 's got gold . 
  plot twist : op cropped the picture . 
  fyi ( also for newbros ) renaming your ship is done to prevent associating your character name ( and all info that reveals ) with your ship on d-scan . 
  some kind of a teamplay tool . 
  i personally love the old idea of deployable grav lifts or jump pads . 
  lockons need to be nerfed hard but other than that i do n't agree with all those recent talks of overhauls . 
  mainly because they imply changes that will never happen/be completely botched ( like buffing the lib ) . 
  also fuck every shitter in those threads who tries to start this song about removing reverse maneuver again . 
  the only reason that those threads are upvoted is / r/infantryside jumping on the bandwagon of removing ai/a2g from esf ( forgetting about lib buffs/shitty valk ) . 
  because they take 40 % of targets hp in return of you looking in their general direction . 
  because they become an unavoidable one-shot weapons when used in 2-3 + groups . 
  because there 's no working counter . 
  they ~ promised ~ to `` reduce lethality '' across the board , including infantry av when they nerfed the shit out of tank cannons . 
  i do n't believe that will ever happen though . 
  i just want a gd-7f . 
   lifenews, 
   fox news, 
  pretty much . 
  yes please . 
  not everyone has av turrets , they 're pretty expensive and somewhat boring . 
  zepher is fine ? 
  yeah right , i was killed by it like 5 times since the last nerf . 
  about the same amount as duster . 
   yet it is the most essential key in the airgame, 
  it 's a myth . 
  it 's convenient for some but nowhere near `` essential '' . 
  it 's fundamental to the game . 
  i doubt it will ever change . 
  yeah , last time i played on werner it was like 30-50ms higher latency . 
  aka ccp rise, 
  this is the problem , it 's basically shit . 
  edit : http://ps2oraclestats.com/?stat=kpu&amp;weapon1=4906&amp;weapon2=4605&amp;weapon3=4600, 
  its stats are closer to aa weapons instead of ai . 
  the solution is ** not another ** fucking nerf . 
  as a russian ( ! ), 
  who has paid sick leave , this is / r/wtf material for me . 
  serious question : i see a lot of goku flaired people on this sub supporting a2a lockons and generally trolling `` career '' pilots . 
  why ? 
  did some of them touch you inappropriately or something ? 
  this is why you do n't release patches 2 days before christmas holidays . 
  especially if your patches have a tendency to break the most random and unrelated shit like this . 
  more or less fixed it for me . 
  the lesson here is : do n't fuck around concord rules , kids . 
  creepy, 
  [ well i see everything just keeps going in my favor ] ( http://redd.it/2riejw ) ( last part there ) . 
  what are the `` 1-month travelpasses '' they refer to there ? 
  i did n't find the info on those . 
   goku are something awful goons from eve, 
  right , i see . 
  not to ruin the game but to ruin your game , i remember . 
  instead of disabling it they really should just make sure players know about friendly fire when they join/create corp. 
  this is just dumbing down .
