  the ** issue ** is that they are nerfing ( one of ) the most useless class in the game . 
  what the fuck !, 
  do you seriously think this will help ? 
  blocking a few words ? 
  i want a server that works . 
  i want 60 fps . 
  yeah i 'm already communicating with them . 
  thanks for the half fare tip !, 
  i think this thing was bugged every time i logged on to pts to test something air related . 
  lol wtf , and i always orbited gun groups so they ca n't track me because i 'm close . 
  i expected something like this when ccp made all drone mods and skills affect fighters . 
  this is the problem imo , not the assign mechanic which has been in the game since forever . 
  ideally drone fighters should fall back to their basic stats when assigned imo . 
  e : also , fb scan res was lowered not because of fighter assign ( since fb are no assignable ) . 
  it was to close some exploitable loophole ( see patchnotes ) . 
   for example , `` lock ons should be removed ! '', 
  which i 've heard from pilots, 
  please make distinction between a2a and g2a lockons . 
  former are op as fuck and absolutely must be removed ( aka severely nerfed ) . 
  latter are shit boring mechanic ( as are all lockons ) but they need to stay if we do n't want to start serious a2g rebalance . 
  e : other than this ( a2a lockons ) and flak plinking you at the edge of render range i do n't find anything op in all those vehicles/weapons . 
  i do n't rage at ai noseguns/rocketpods while playing infantry , nor hornets/libs while playing tanks . 
  you get countered every hour in this game , it 's normal . 
   imo lib is in a great spot right now . 
  i 'll say it again : i was killed about 5 times total ( infantry only ) by the lib since the last nerf . 
  and i do n't even use flak armor ( although i do play la most of the time ) . 
  do n't forget lockon sniper rifles !, 
   that means no more soloing tanks , lightnings , and sunderers with your nosegun + ab tanks esf . 
  with default nosegun ? 
  something something `` ca n't nerf stupid \u2122 '', 
   montages, 
  yeah , right . 
  other questions ? 
  surely you can retreat to allies/cover . 
  these `` no `` s are funny because : https://adashboard.info/intel, 
  let 's not make a proper interface for what 's already available via igb . 
   what about the term infantry do n't you understand ? 
  ( apart from saf all mentioned solutions are vehicle/big bases only ), 
   g2a lock-on launchers, 
   3 salvos , about 15 seconds, 
  i 'm not sure of the exact ttk but this is most definitely bullshit even for a stock sunderer without shield/blockade/w / e else . 
  also 1 engi outrepairs one esf bombing the sundy . 
  also esf hovering `` at high angle '' starts to fall very quickly . 
  edit : tested it , stock sundy with no reps = 4 mags of hellfire pods . 
  i have n't seen a base camped by tanks since he ( at ) nerf . 
  those guns are useless now except for farming shitters . 
  do i get it right that esfs should be one-shotted by any aa ? 
  because otherwise a * flying * vehicle will * fly * away from the damage source . 
  seriously , every fucking time this is mentioned i do n't understand ** what the fuck is it that you want ? 
  ** it 's a goddamn plane , it 's meant to fly off . 
  basically, 
  i think it should group it into alliances and coalitions . 
  never used it much myself . 
  i wonder how hard is it to restrict your exit coordinates with respect to your vehicle coordinates ... 
  i want anything , this bug is half a year old . 
  i 'd go for a quick fix every day if the code is that shitty that you ca n't find a solution in this much time . 
  especially since this quick fix is very localized ( a lot to assume with soe code , i know ) . 
  i 'll save my judgment until i can spin it . 
  what if they were competent ? 
  you basically described my behavior when solo/duo stealth-tanking . 
  very good guide . 
  it went * poof * . 
  literally new stellar nebula is unfolding before your eyes - * `` an annoying bugsplat on my favorite space screensaver . 
  shield is op . 
  but oh , the ha is the primary class for most players in this game , so do n't expect this to be recognized . 
   you had a beautiful thing . 
  i have this picture saved just for these kind of occasions : http://i.imgur.com/riglmsm.jpg, 
  you should n't judge so much imo . 
   turns out if you run inside the shields after you have shot at them , they keep shooting you regardless . 
  idk whether this is a bug , but i just lost my stilletto to them . 
   you do n't give someone 20b in assets off the start . 
  this . 
  i would n't give op more than 100-200 mil of my assets . 
  only essentials . 
  but then again i would n't be in a corp like that , 
   but then i think , people live a really long time . 
  it 's possible it wo n't stay in the video game forever . 
  oh ... you 're * that * type . 
  some also have said that i must be/will become almost a cold blooded murderer just because i did some unconsented pvp in another game . 
   i 'll go on a limp and say that guys like him do not have too many rl friends . 
  apparently there are * a lot * of you here . 
  seriously , this is retarded . 
  you never mix virtual and rl stuff . 
  i 'm sad that this is so downvoted . 
  people who are making up all kinds psychology diagnoses for op here themselves can not see a border between rl and a game . 
  dr. mcredditor , phd in psychology and medical sciences ( aka nobody ) . 
  i tend to not destroy sundys in < 24 fights but i could n't care less for them in zergs . 
  yelling at someone for that is retarded either way . 
  i started keepeing all modules shown sometime ago to see the heat damage . 
  it sucks to lose an lse and not to know about it . 
  you can also make ~ ~ offline ~ ~ inactive mods into funny figures , 
   if the only thing preventing them from doing harmful things is the threat of punishment, 
  no one said that , stop imagining and assuming . 
  it was so obvious . 
  i really do n't like these `` retcon '' harry & hermione attempts . 
   sniper with lock on mechanics, 
  would buy and harass the shit out of the fight from a nearby hill . 
  kill yourself, 
  this is not a simulator , this is a ( potentially ) fun game . 
  so , fuck off .
