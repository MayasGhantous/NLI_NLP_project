  honestly , as a russian , i did n't think i would ever be so disgusted by my country 's actions . 
  unsubbing because of layoffs is stupid , if anything it will bring us closer to the end . 
  unsub because of actions ( i.e. 
  if service becomes even worse ) , not guesses . 
  yes it was and it is . 
  if you feel you want to unsub because of it - do it , i did it in december . 
  but unsubbing just because of layoffs is stupid . 
  as a line member i used to and still do sometimes , but it is more fun ( and can be equally profitable ) to blitz missions in nullsec ; do exploration ; incursions ; maybe whs if you have infrastructure . 
  line member sov pve ( anoms ) is just a human doing bot 's job . 
  it 's mind-numbing . 
   by reinforcing structures you force someone to show up . 
  in my experience reinforcing structures most often results in an off-tz deep night/early morning timer . 
  people are fucking retarded . 
  `` hey , my favorite game and its devs are under a big scrutiny of their new owner ... * let 's stop paying them , surely it will help the situation !, 
  if you 're uncertain of the game 's future , fine , unsub ( or maybe resub for a smaller period ? ), 
  if you 're tired of bugs , performance , etc - unsub , i know i did . 
  but calling for mass unsubs in the community just because of layoffs will just finish this game off . 
  2 months may be an exaggeration but i 'm expecting a shutdown or a big cutdown anywhere between that and 6 months . 
  just make it slow you down and automatically lock after that . 
  it 's been suggested a thousand times already . 
  w a s t e d, 
  to ex-soe/dbg devs : https://np.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/2vo0b5/in_the_spirit_of_charity_could_ccp_use_the_talent/cojggza, 
  itt : `` hold my beer , i 'll get this economy under control . '', 
  i 'm an irregular visitor here but every time i do look into / new it 's like it is in permanently downvoted state . 
  it 's amusing and sad at the same time . 
   and since putin ochestrated the assassination of my country 's president and dozens of other elite citizens ... ), 
  not a fan of putin , but you 're taking it too far . 
  besides , people here seem to have trouble getting one thing with businesses : dbg is a sub-subsidiary to rennova . 
  they are a drop in a fucking sea . 
  i doubt that rennova could give more than one , maybe two , fucks about ps2 . 
  i do n't like our people tbh . 
  they can be friendly but more often they 're angry at you and everything for no reason . 
  and most importantly for me , they are * untrustworthy * . 
  i 've had so many friends fail me at one point or another that honestly i 'm left with just one real friend who is ( unsurprisingly ) european , not russian . 
  i really hate putin too ( or should i say \u041f\u0443\u0442\u043b\u0435\u0440 ) . 
  this last year i truly felt embarrassed of my country for the first time . 
  it 's gotten to a whole new level of retarded . 
  so i 'd not really say many good things about russia , i really dislike it and i believe it 's mostly a bad place . 
  all that said though , op skipped all reason and went straight to accusations based on conspiracy theory , and really stupid one at that . 
  based on this he refused to work for a company that 's connected to a couple of russian billionaires through a chain of subsidiaries . 
  great fucking logic . 
  last i checked dbg 's flag had 50 stars on it . 
  yes . 
  but holding companies and common sense are too hard hurp durp, 
  pretty much . 
  `` russia against the world '' mentality is running strong here . 
  thanks , putin . 
  i 'm not ukrainian , i live in russia . 
  i am , in fact , several hundreds of kms from the closest state border . 
  thankfully that does n't strip me of common sense . 
  but your assumption tells me everything i need to know about you . 
  the same as the guy above telling me to gtfo to the `` fortress of democracy '' or some shit and wash dishes there . 
  ( if you really need to know , as a programmer , i think i can and will do better than that for myself . ), 
  both of you are just a typical case of \u043f\u043e\u0446\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043e\u0442 , believing that to be russian is to be always right . 
  thank you . 
  title is 10/10 , would read again . 
   profits made from daybreak games are going to russian renova group as they `` own '' them . 
  `` profits '' do n't go anywhere . 
  the return on the investment goes . 
  which also passes through cn before reaching renova . 
  you people are trying way too fucking hard . 
  chances are you have an unknown russian relative that 's more close to you than renova is to dbg . 
  who/what is russian mob and how the fuck do you people draw out these conclusions ? 
  tinfoil indeed, 
  if you 're interested it 's \u0430\u0439\u0441\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0433 in russian too which is pronounced almost exactly like iceberg , 
  you know , as much as this is a terrible shitpost , he has a point does n't he ? 
  was soe a japanese company ? 
  were it 's profits going directly to japan 's economy ? 
  do n't think so . 
  people on this sub should stop flipping out . 
   columbus nova is a us company comprised entirely of us citizens . 
   strange - this says something else : http://www.renova.ru/en/structure/company/, 
  this , however , says :, 
   columbus nova ( cn ) is an investment management firm ... ** has offices in new york , los angeles , and charlotte ( usa ) **, 
  900 third avenue -19 th floor , new york , ny 10022, 
  for some reason people have a really hard time with intercorporate relations ( is that a thing ? 
  well i made it a thing ) . 
  it 's the same with blizzard games : people on reddit & forums ca n't see the difference between blizzard ( making games ) and activision-blizzard ( holding company : managing businesses , interacting with shareholders etc etc ) . 
  maybe it 's lack of education or knowledge or i do n't know . 
  excellent flying ^ and ^ music ^ ^ unlike ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ last ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ vid :p, 
  i 'm aware of corrupt power-hungry russian government and large nationalistic part of russia 's population . 
  i do n't know about any mob though . 
  especially the one who can access any of kind payment data . 
  e : thanks for the downvotes . 
  anything to the point ? 
  so you 're comparing a megacorporation like renova with a criminal gang from the nineties ? 
  bands like those were countless in the 90s during perestroika . 
  some rose to power . 
  in the 00s putin made them either hide their criminal nature and work for him or go to jail . 
  right now those band are mostly a thing of the past . 
  as the time passed the hidden criminal nature transformed into corruption . 
  so to sum it up , your link does n't have any relation to corps like renova . 
  well the op of this thread did talk about his ps2 payment data somehow getting to the mysterious `` russian mob '' . 
  i 've just said that there could n't be such a connection if the mob is leftovers of 90s gangs . 
  can you even quantify the percentage of someone 's sc spendings that eventually will get to renova ? 
  a friend of mine forgot to shut down his client before he went to bed . 
  it consumed all 16g of ram . 
  it 's a memory leak and it can get as high as possible given time . 
  one of the reasons i use [ rsts ] ( https://recursiontracker.com/ ) . 
  you can disable the announces or overlay if you do n't like them .
