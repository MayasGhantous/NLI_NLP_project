  it 's not insignificant , it 's fucking infuriating seeing orions adadad time after time after time , with their overshield too . 
  he said something like `` it does n't fucking matter '' while it does fucking matter . 
  why must i work my ass of with aiming at orion users when they press f adada and mow me down easily with body shots ? 
  way to rip a couple of words out of the context . 
   why must i work my ass of with aiming at orion users ** when they press f adada and mow me down easily with body shots ** ? 
   0.75 ads like ns-15, 
  low ttk . 
  again , the question is , why should ** i ** improve while others play easymode ? 
  thank you for your contribution . 
  jesus , literally everybody is flipping because they read the part where * i * dare not to work , but did n't bother about the part where the other guy kills me effortlessly . 
  half the things i watch i fast forward because of this . 
  another half because of unnecessary horror-style stuff . 
  i knew this was going to be mentioned , but whatever way you look at it it always boils down to 1v1 performance unless the same feature has some significant disadvantage in team play , not only in infantry play but everywhere . 
  let me tell you about tr recoil ... 
  also , scoring headshots on adadad orion does n't constitute just of `` move the mouse marginally faster '' . 
  doing bodyshots while f adadad does . 
  why bother with it though ? ... 
  while going for pretty much only headshots and compensating for adad ? 
  why do * i * have to do this ? 
  right because i dont ( mainly ) play vanu . 
  i learned to read his posts assuming sarcasm by default , 
  i personally do n't but there are rare but persistent reports of it still being present . 
  ctrl+a , right click , reprocess , accept . 
  i turned some of my bigger ships that i wo n't fly anyway into liquidity this way , it felt good and provided a nice chunk of isk . 
  it also made me more mobile in case i need to relocate ( those ships were in null ) . 
  e : obviously does n't apply to faction stuff , 
  e2 : op asked ( even if jokingly ) for help with his pile of ships . 
  let 's downvote the advice of the easiest way to liquify unmovable/bad assets . 
  dear reddit , downvoting these threads wo n't make them or the problem go away . 
  wts capitals, 
  target painter secondary with manual aiming ? 
  that actually may be interesting . 
  why . 
  the . 
  are . 
  you . 
  talking . 
  about . 
  a2g . 
  a. thread . 
  about . 
  a2a . 
  balance . 
  you . 
  dumb . 
  why is there always an idiot like you in these threads ? 
  [ why ? 
  ] ( http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1kzh3haki1qa6lp8.gif ), 
  balance-wise ? 
  for instance ? 
  you mean when ccp went and flipped fighters from absolute shit to assignable borderline op by applying all the skills and mods that previously did n't apply to fighters ? 
  yeah , sounds about right . 
  and now they removed the entire mechanic because they fucked up balance elsewhere . 
  hey , eve is about cruiser size anyways and maybe grinding a station with caps in the middle of fucking nowhere once in a while . 
  maybe we have a fucking aimbot in a competitive fps game . 
  apply them at a % ? 
  or maybe , just maybe , redesign the ever-more-useless `` endgame '' ships that people train for years only to see their last unique abilities stripped away completely . 
  instead of fucking industrial balance or some shit . 
  like they were doing the tiercide for how long ? 
  2 + years now ? 
  maybe it 's time for cap update ? 
  i 'm mad as fuck right now . 
  this is nowhere near good balancing but it will get support of the mob and get implemented anyway . 
  i might have an aneurysm here . 
  also if you could look beyond your butthurt you 'd see that regardless of behaviour , opinions and whatnot mattiace is a very good pilot . 
  that 's a fact . 
  using or not using rocketpods does not make somebody a better pilot . 
  i want to see a video of you effectively using flares against tomcats . 
  right , now , fuck off . 
  what about the time you will be ganked by 5 coyotes ? 
  ( lol do n't even try that one ), 
  why would i put it on the grid ? 
  what are the reasons for me to do it ? 
  also , if you 've actually read and understood what i wrote you 'd see that if they cared to balance stats on assigned fighters properly no good fights would be ruined by them . 
  but what do i know , let 's just remove the whole fucking mechanic . 
  might as well remove titans too , 100b piece of shit mobile jump bridges . 
   until it 's explained to me how to use tomcats effectively enough to justify peoples ' complaints , i ca n't take them seriously . 
  you uuuhhhh ... look uhhh ... at the enemy . 
  and ... uhhh ... they lose 40 % hp uhhh ... no matter what they do ... right uuuhh ... i think that 's it . 
  do you know about such thing as * dodging * , or even not flying in a straight line ? 
  any of these will make an esf not one-clippable . 
  do you know about dodging tomcats ? 
  well , me neither . 
  also , did you even watch the video ? 
  did you also notice how his hp was close to burning in the first fight and went up to almost full in the second ? 
  did you notice the jump he got on his opponent in both fights , that possibly decided the first one and had no effect on the result of the second one ? 
  did you know that keeping close to a less skilled tomcat user will help you since it 's harder to track up close ? 
  did you know that there 's no cover when you 're flying high where a lot of air fights happen ? 
  did you use your brain at all or is the only thing you can do is repeat after the infantry mob who believe it 's right to have an aimbot weapon in a competitive game and have some unhealthy vindicative feeling when they argue for it against pilots that have to actually deal with the damn thing ? 
  patches that claim to do a thing but actually do nothing are definitely my favorite in all games ( mass effect 3 multiplayer comes to mind , they had like 4 patches that had a `` fix '' for the same bug ) . 
  while this is from eve online , a game of much larger scale , it does show how much more powerful ts and other specialized voip is for comms . 
  and those are pretty average numbers for big ops . 
  larger coalitions can pull and coordinate a lot more people . 
  1000 t1 medium beams . 
  new neocom is great . 
  i only have troubles with the assets icon . 
  in a game of skill you press f to gain 900 more skill and thus outskill your opponent . 
   i 'm not surprised that legion of xxdeathxx nullbear does not understand it , nor has the balls to actually do so . 
  nice assumptions . 
   the percentage you were talking about would not work .
