  being based in the region with income heavily dependent on non-renewable fuel is bad too ( even though maybe the city 's income is n't directly tied to it , the entire region 's income is ) . 
  now that i think of it , i remember : i already said the word that describes that place perfectly - artificial . 
  that 's why i dislike it . 
  and i do n't believe we have come to the point where we can make something artificial on that scale that will last . 
  also their artificial islands irritate me a lot . 
  not because i 'm counting someone else 's money . 
  it 's just ... i do n't know , like * extremely * tasteless . 
   that and the constant threads of frothing rage about lock-ons and how they ruin ` muh airgame ! ', 
  `` hey , the airgame has been broken for 2 years . 
  i wonder why these fucking pilots wo n't shut up . '', 
  name the bigger balance issue then . 
  also you 've already been told in a different thread , that it 's not like it takes a week of work to change 2-3 numbers in some table . 
   the medkits not working properly , the client-side explosions of c4 , the lockdown mechanics of the prowler on difficult terrain, 
  not balance , but tech issues, 
   the ttk on shotguns, 
  reducing ttk on something that has < 5m effective range ? 
  i understand that this is controversial but i do n't think that this is the most pressing balance issue right now . 
   rather than the 1v1 jousts in the air . 
  you said you do n't fly , so maybe you can hold on your assumptions on what air fights are like ( and could become if improved ) . 
   they, 
  people keep talking about this `` they '' . 
  we 're not a uniform fucking entity , we 're players each with different opinions . 
  also a2a fights are what removes a2g of opposing factions . 
  a2a fights often happen * not * in 1v1 format . 
  and they could be made more fun and meaningful by fixing a2am . 
   balancing should be happening where it most impacts the game . 
  air is just not that . 
  so you say shotguns define outcomes of battles so they should be changed ? 
  yeah that 's why every server smash has a big focus on air wings . 
  because they are n't relevant . 
   you should see what the one on miller was if you want to learn the definition of elitist . 
  i am in that `` body of pilots '' . 
  and i can say that everyone there has different opinions on different issues . 
  i can also say that i have n't seen any of that `` elitism '' - buzzwords there , they 're a really nice bunch of people . 
  show me on this catch-doll where bad supers touched you . 
   on a side note : controls are much better . 
  its still weird but better than when i flew friday . 
  did they actually change anything ? 
  i did n't see any notices . 
   cheered, 
  yeah right, 
  he was fine . 
  a2g must exist . 
  combined arms etc etc. 
  it wo n't help though . 
  top configurations still dont get even close to 60 in 96 + . 
  i never understood translators changing the original names . 
  that 's one thing you * never * do when translating , unless there 's an existing translations for that particular name . 
  the voice acting sounds awesome though . 
  not that i will play it over original , but seems like they are doing a good job at that . 
  any developer who does this will have his balls shrivel and fall off . 
  looking at you , skype . 
  slow down , reduce turn speed , reduce damage against esfs only by ~ 50-60 % . 
  make them into torpedoes as higby said . 
  same from the attacker 's side : https://gfycat.com/colossalgrimygordonsetter, 
  yeah i know , my aim was non existant , i did n't go for headshots yadayadayada . 
  if you 're really interested , i was nearly passing out after a long day at work . 
  the point is : they should n't survive like this . 
  and they would n't , if not for the shield . 
  i like the 1s `` charge up '' idea . 
  fixes oshit situations , keeps breaching role . 
  with no shield he would 've been dead regardless of my aim . 
  because he was caught off guard from the back with a rl equipped . 
  if that was n't obvious . 
  is it really good game design where the person that failed to be aware of their surroundings can press one button and kill the attacker that caught them off guard ? 
   you as the person walking up behind him should be able to recognize, 
  did you notice how quickly it happened ? 
  i do n't know maybe it 's superbad but i do n't have the power to recognize ha from the back in a split second . 
   you knew it was a ha, 
  i did n't . 
  did you notice how quickly it happened ? 
  i do n't know maybe it 's superbad but i do n't have the power to recognize ha from the back in a split second . 
  did you even read past the first line ? 
  gr8 b8 8/8, 
  i said it before in a different thread and i will continue saying it :, 
  why every class in the game ** must ** play perfectly , and if they make ** any ** mistake they will lose to the class that can pick their nose , press oshit button , yawn , turn around and mow down the guy ? 
  how is that fair ? 
  like how do you justify that ha can rectify their mistakes by pressing one button , and if their opponent made a single mistake - ha wins regardless ? 
  great fucking design . 
  no wonder it 'll never be changed because it 's abused by majority in this game . 
  and do n't try to sell that `` tanky role '' bullcrap . 
  you can still be tanky without the option to instantly fix your mistakes . 
  and i did n't even start on the medkids here ... 
   how about you guys work on tuning back infantry av, 
  shhhhh we were supposed to forget about that . 
  lol, 
  pilots are very visible right now because soe/dbg completely ignored us for more than a year . 
  `` too much say '' my ass . 
  wtb blueshifts for tr max . 
  i hit enough to kill him . 
  but ` f ' is too strong . 
  why must i account for a million things while heavy picks his nose with his back to me ? 
   he had enough reflex, 
  you can train a monkey to do that . 
  no offense meant . 
  it has nothing to do with flying . 
  in the vr there 's some infantry on the rock in the center of the map . 
  you can try killing them with your nosegun while simultaneously dodging imaginary fire . 
  this is pretty good practice . 
  in case you do n't know , dodging is like this random up-down movement that work better while you 're rolled ( this also makes aiming harder ) and occasional reverses while you reload .
