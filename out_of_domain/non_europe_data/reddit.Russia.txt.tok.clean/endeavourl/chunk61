  so less skilled pilot was killed by a more skilled one that allowed the a2g ally of the latter to continue exerting pressure on the ground . 
  what 's the problem here ? 
  mission system phase n was supposed to do that ... so , yeah . 
  it 's sad actually , i was looking forward to that . 
  so many undelivered promises ... 
  did/can you even read the op ? 
  i did n't have any problems with quick-hover with pitch + roll . 
  be sure to check your binds and settings . 
  i personally disabled the joystick checkbox under sensitivity sliders . 
  i do n't use pitch keybinds though . 
  installed it at work recently , 
  this is what it looks like for me with eist and other powersaving stuff enabled in bios and oc 'd to 4.4 ghz . 
  so i do n't know , it should work . 
  maybe you can try to monitor using some graphing tool so you can see history . 
  or put your monitoring tool on a second monitor . 
  here are my overclock settings : http://imgur.com/a/6mqbu, 
  * edge, 
  dey break gaems . 
  seems relevant here . 
  they got the exact same feedback from pts test weeks ago and i 'm talking detailed feedback : acceleration , oversensitive pitch , broken bindings - all the stuff you see itt . 
  after 2 years of this game i sure learned one thing : those people ** suck ** at game development . 
  are you trying to say that pilots ' skills are some kind of god send ? 
  we all learned ourselves and we survived . 
  and before you say it , i started flying about a year ago , far later than the first aces . 
  the next thing is what do you even suggest should be done with player skill ? 
  should i excel at everything 1 day into the game ? 
  because poor new players have a hard time at the start of their game . 
  better make infantry version of coyotes , am i right ? 
  god damn . 
  this is just fucking / facedesk material . 
  so to improve fucked air controls with ** keyboard ** pilots used ** joystick ** options and they caused turrets to go under tanks ? 
  hey dbg , maybe this `` unified controls '' thing is turning out to be more of a hassle ? 
  their code must be so fucking shitty to allow things like this to happen . 
  and then they go and make such huge changes on top of it . 
  what could possibly go wrong . 
  wtf, 
  as a programmer and small scale pm , this dev team fucking sucks ass . 
  there 's a special client with additional 3rd party anti cheat . 
  made by innova iirc . 
  the one where i did n't log in except to test flight and tank controls . 
  dey break gaems . 
  setting joystick sensitivity to 0 in ini causes this . 
  i know right ? 
  that guy thinks he 's a king or something, 
  please tell me if this is too much tinfoil . 
  but imo it is very likely that this was an ( successful ) attempt to slip major controls engine change as `` flight controls change '' given how a lot of people will agree with anything that makes pilots ' gameplay worse . 
  if people were told that the entire controls engine was to be made more `` console-like '' they would n't 've accepted it . 
  divide and conquer . 
  tankers and long range snipers report of smaller projectile drop . 
  `` military airport siren sounds '' ? 
  that 's a fucking locomotive horn . 
  conspiracy theories are retarded . 
  that whole video is retarded . 
  i just watched that video and it 's bullshit . 
   give it a few days . 
  it 'll blow over, 
  it 's a flesh wound . 
  mostly about our part in the war , and we even have a name for that part : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_patriotic_war_ ( term ), 
  it 's pretty skewed on both sides . 
  i still do n't understand why they ca n't just use currency rates , especially since this is a global distribution network . 
  this shit just encourages piracy for prices higher than the baseline ( usd ) . 
  if my underpaid single mom could make that happen for me to see the world - you can too . 
  switzerland is the best thing that happened in my life . 
  currently planning my 6th trip , 
  why are you shooting ( downvoting ) the messenger , guys ? 
  he answered a question . 
  i doubt that nc . 
  leadership did n't think that this would happen given how passive and reactionary cfc is . 
  i mean they were just sitting there in the north bored doing nothing , basically waiting for someone to invade . 
  so his answer makes some sense . 
  something probably did n't go as planned . 
  i remember it being pretty successful when old nc invaded drone regions in 2010 . 
  pl ops in the north really took pressure off of us defending . 
  every time i visited i always lived in the eastern part of the country so ca n't really say much about the french-speaking region . 
  lausanne was nice and i did n't really like geneva , especially in the more recent visit . 
  i can recommend visiting appenzell and surrounding mountains like ebenalp and s\u00e4ntis though . 
  i like that area because mountains are more ... cute ... as opposed to great and intimidating ones like eiger . 
  does that make sense ? 
  if you 're into old towns and churches you can also visit st. gallen on the way . 
  it 's 1h10m train ride from z\u00fcrich , after that it 's 40m to appenzell and another 10m to wasserrauen ( the station below ebenalp ) . 
  s\u00e4ntis takes more time to get to because you need to take a bus but if the weather is good the view is mind blowing . 
  if more questions pop up feel free to ask in / r/askswitzerland or / r/switzerland , 
  this image will haunt my dreams . 
  judging by your downvotes this sub is as powertrippy as usual . 
  she was tased for speeding and speaking on the phone ? 
  wtf, 
  did she refuse it aggressively ? 
  did she refuse it on purpose for a period of time or was she ( maybe , video does n't show her before tumbling out of the car ) in shock because of being threatened ? 
  not defending her actions but ca n't see how that use of force was unavoidable . 
   you ca n't really expect the cop to just tackle her to remove her then , can you ? 
  but he gave her like < 15 seconds there . 
  imo if you 're not a shit human being you can wait * at least * twice that time before starting electrocuting people . 
  i know people that in this kind of situation could have just froze in place thinking `` wtf is happening '' over and over again . 
  i guess just tase them , that 'll teach them to not be human beings with emotions , right ? 
  they have been breaking the game at least since the omfg performance updates . 
  not really a prophecy but an observation . 
  itt : people with no meaningful airgame experience share their `` valuable '' `` opinions '' . 
   if they want developer responses , a bunch of namecalling is n't going to get them . 
  will uninstalling do ? 
   the only people who noticed and got annoyed were the people who put in ~ 50 hours per week into this game .
