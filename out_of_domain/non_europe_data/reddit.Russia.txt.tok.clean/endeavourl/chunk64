   with a single loadout top-skill air players can dominate air , ground and infantry low-skill players . 
  ftfy, 
  fine by me . 
  why does this feel like a twisted donation/investment rally ? 
  * you all just need to adjust , people . 
  on the geneva point : i 'm not swiss but i 'm with a lot of them in thinking that it is pretty ` meh ' . 
  [ this recent thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/switzerland/comments/33t2wn/where_are_switzerlands_biggest_tourist_traps/ ) is pretty telling too . 
  also there 's one thing ... 
  in [ that great shot ] ( http://i1.wp.com/justingoesplaces.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20140801_093546_1.jpg ) i 'm not sure your footwear is adequate for the terrain because it offers no ankle support . 
  i know that my swiss friends would scold me very much if i 'd go hiking in that kinda footwear . 
  i 've used something a bit heavier and with more ankle support ( like [ that ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:karrimor.jpg ) ) and felt very confident in steep and generally rocky sections . 
  now i feel good that i both hiked a bit there ( not all the way though ) * and * the train was covered by the swiss pass . 
  asian tourists though ... yeah . 
  the top was pretty crowded . 
  the view on all the lakes is great though , especially when you can look and remember `` oh i was there ... and there ... oh and there and there '' :d, 
  i think the comments here are in an agreement that the real wtf is the title . 
  i think you 're mistaking tr and nc for infantryside . 
  it 's just as with air handling and everything else : just re-learn all the stuff from your 100s hours of practice , no big deal . 
  you sound salty . 
  also , what does combined arms mean if not vehicle play interacting with infantry play ? 
  is that a surprise ? 
  go die in a fire , op . 
  it 's weird , the first third of it felt drawn out , the rest was exciting . 
  great flying anyway !, 
  they are very intelligent but i do n't think there 's actual evidence and research on their self awareness . 
  that 's ~ 28000 usd at 1b/plex there ... 
  5600 plex * 20 usd/plex = 112000 usd, 
  maths , dude . 
  anyway , the plex reference that i took for simplicity 's sake is closer than yours to the actual price and produces a less inflated result ( also negating a bit the rounding up of initial isk to 1.4 t , again for simplicity ) . 
   `` lock a '' 9/10 times means time to bail . 
  we almost had higby considering doing something about it ... and then he quit/got fired . 
  is n't that some sad , sad irony . 
  the time parameter is in format :, 
  t = xhymzs, 
  the parameters are added to the url after a ' ? ', 
  ( question mark ) . 
  if an url already has a parameter , multiple parameters are joined using ' & ' . 
  so , http://www.twitch.tv/nl_kripp/b/653890249?t=2h58m, 
  the server merges were welcomed due to shrinking population and resulted in a lot of lag and worse problems with zergs . 
  that makes me wonder how gravitational collapse of such amount of fissile material would go ... 
  you do n't make stuff easier with broken weapons . 
  that 's a fallacy that people here love . 
  actually ... when was the last time he played minesweeper ? 
  can anyone except pl do anything in this game by themselves ? 
  i mean we 're pretty bad but still . 
  well we did n't defend etherium reach in the last month since we were cleaning out cache . 
  tri is also working with solar and irc now in er . 
  about co2 , i do n't remember losing to them after we deployed to malpais . 
  eh , anyway , whatever , i do n't even know why i bother writing this . 
   `` legacy code '' is such a fucking copout . 
  wow okay bro . 
  solving world 's problems in software development like it 's nothing . 
  vsync on , 144hz , single gtx 770 . 
  nothing wrong . 
  nothing bad happens to video memory too . 
  i do n't want to see a bunch of gold plated ships at every undock . 
  that guy sounds really arrogant to make calls about somebody else 's product like this . 
  1080p , opsec cut . 
  3840x1080 , still works fine . 
  protoss jokes suck . 
  downvotes to the left . 
  my second monitor is 60hz so i disabled vsync . 
  ca n't increase height because hardware . 
  you 're cool bro i got that . 
  damn it , every video of yours just makes me want to see the next one more :d, 
  thanks for all the stuff ( and music ! ), 
  edit : i 've never seen this before so i 'll ask : what 's the purpose of bombers spamming probes when launching bombs ? 
  wow that edge . 
  i simply stated fact . 
  we were out of er and were elsewhere . 
  as you 've stated it , `` lel nope lock-on op '' . 
  such comment much discussion, 
  i do like amarr but sarum skins applied to , for instance , dominix look awful because gold becomes dominating material with like 80 % of the surface area . 
  it just looks bad and tasteless . 
  launcher started working suprisingly fine for me under ubuntu 12.04 wine 1.7 . 
  it changed from glitchy mess to stable after an update sometime in december ( i think ) . 
  even though you can bypass it right now , you can only log into the game that way . 
  so as i understand it greatly reduces risk of account theft since it protects email , password etc changes . 
  and if someone gets to your account and does something to your stuff - it should be much easier to petition when you still own that account . 
  when people say `` dead game '' they do n't mean it literally but rather they mean [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/poct0ce.png ) . 
  in other news : players were shamed today when complaining to the developer about obvious security holes in their games . 
  it 's not becoming liquid , it 's still metal , but it behaves like liquid when such forces are applied in short timeframes . 
  it 's like water but in reverse : it 's still liquid when you hit it with your belly but it feels like a solid for a second . 
  i do n't know why people say it like resources are infinite now . 
  in a way , they are more scarce than in the previous system . 
  spam some grenades/c4/revive nades and there you go - no vehicles/air for you at least in the next 5 minutes . 
  current system really punishes switching playstyles . 
  all of the above was said with no premium/boosts in mind . 
  throw a sticky at them . 
   we get to use our cap fleets more regularly now , and for that i 'm thankful . 
  that will mostly change with entosis sov . 
  i hope ccp gets capital rebalance/redesign done right . 
  durable ? 
  whatever . 
  this also tricked me several times into thinking that 1st movement is finished ( at 16-16 .5 m ) . 
  the quick spawn system was implemented broken and left like that . 
  your default ( quick ) spawn point should never be overridden and should always be your last used spawn point . 
  control changes did n't do anything to hover meta except breaking pitch binds . 
  they just made aiming unpredictable . 
  racer vs hover is as much of a choice as it 's always been,
