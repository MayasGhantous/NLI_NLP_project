   the air game is full of one trick pony aces who just have good nosegun aim but horrible situational awareness and ability to use terrain, 
  god damn you are so fucking retarded , go fuck yourself . 
   * just have good nosegun aim *, 
  as in , they *** just *** learned how to compensate for aiming inertia , bullet drop , velocity and enemy movement in 3d space . 
  yeah , easy shit . 
   but horrible ability to use terrain, 
  all that terrain at 900m altitude . 
   but horrible situational awareness, 
  this just shows that you have no clue about this . 
  all good pilots have excellent awareness because you can not see everywhere at once thus you need to rely at esf sounds and their slight variations to get the full picture of surroundings . 
  also you 're advocating an aimbot weapon in an fps game , how retarded is that ? 
  i want to see a similar weapon for infantry , that 'd be awesome . 
  how is mouse acceleration and analog emulation in a pc game `` better '' ? 
  realism and lore should not affect game mechanics . 
  what 's more fun and rewarding : looking at a player and letting aimbot do the job ; or actually aiming , compensating and predicting for movement ? 
  well you 've met not so nice pilots . 
  experiences may differ . 
  careful , you 'll have a heart attack this way . 
  i 'm all for adapting . 
  i just can not accept a half-pc half-console control scheme that does n't really feel good on either and nullifies the main point of kb + mouse - precision . 
   there 's no reason to fly at 900 m, 
  because flak and aa vanguards totally do n't exist . 
  i personally have no problems in air . 
  because i 'm bad and because i do n't use pitch binds . 
  you have an impression of `` getting better '' with new controls because there 's very low competition right now since most pilots quit it after continuous insults like this from soe/dbg . 
   why is your flaccid penis unable to get it up ? 
  you got ta try harder than that . 
  highsec pvp is for pros . 
  different things . 
  ** ccp , all you had to do ** was to fix the copyright lawyer shit . 
  ** nobody ** asked you to go and break our current identities with new retarded rules . 
  please think again , ccp , now using an actual brain . 
  path of exile early access was excellent . 
   save your money and enjoy a 15chf big mac meal at mcdonalds, 
  i remember a box of salad being like 6-7 fr . 
  at coop . 
  i 'd go for that and a bun , 
  if you have children , i remember verkehrshaus luzern to be the greatest birthday ever . 
  it 's basically big transport/tech museum in a park . 
  really amazing when you 're 12 y/o :d, 
  boat trips can be amazing and beautiful but can also be long . 
  i think it 's 3.5 h to the south end of the lake ( fl\u00fcelen ) , where you end up in a valley between mountains . 
  you can take shorter ones going not full way south or in the west-east ends of the lake . 
  you get lower mountains though . 
  also definitely visit rigi and/or pilatus and maybe hike a bit . 
  edit : the best thing about luzern though is that it is in the middle on the country and quite close to pretty much everything . 
  cities , mountains , lakes . 
  they probably were more afraid of you accidentally shorting it out than puncturing it . 
  also did $ 100 include the new battery cost ? 
  because after all the news about bad batteries exploding that used to pop up , i 'm not sure i 'll trust anything but the vendor-approved ones . 
  how is holding points and following lattice lines too hard of a system ? 
  take a look at ( soon to be redone and simplified ) [ eve online sovereignty system ] ( http://cdn1.eveonline.com/community/devblog/2009/sov_flowchart.jpg ) . 
  indar is good if you want to fight in three fucking bottlenecks forever . 
  we in my outfit even have a phrase for that . 
  * looking at the map * -- oh , indar is shitting itself as usual . 
   they did however make a small attempt to answer my question which was `` what is the current team 's thoughts on a2a lock-ons '' . 
  burness answered and basically said that a2a lock-ons are there for the new pilots to contend with the experienced pilots . 
  did they really fucking say that ? 
  jesus , after higby 's last posts on a2ams this just hurts ... 
  i wanted to log in today but after this i lost all motivation again . 
  will try that in an [ icn ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sbb-cff-ffs_rabde_500 ) !, 
  do n't worry , i 've got enough downvotes for everyone in these comments . 
  seriously , go to hell you sick fucks . 
  are you that guy from the `` tech '' `` support '' ? 
  for a start , use q spot . 
  use descend ( ctrl ) while landing . 
  after last controls patch , and especially in a scythe , be careful not to bounce and flip your esf against the ground . 
  buy flares 1 . 
  learn reverse maneuver ( search this sub/youtube ) . 
  welcome , although i guess this will be downvoted due to a2g . 
  ( `` take away [ from wealthy ] and redistribute [ between poor ] '' ), 
  as a russian , let me tell you , nothing good has ever come out of that idea . 
  just because fa is now defunct and in bl is grinding their sov it does n't mean you should write the name of the latter instead of the former 's coalition for fun or whatever . 
  if you want to stay objective with this map . 
  let the sov changes and the awesome verite influence renderer do their job . 
  it will also create a dynamic between maps . 
  otherwise you could do this for every disbanded/cascaded/relocated alliance and it would be a shitshow . 
  this map just stuffed now defunct fa into a `` bl coalition '' : http://go-dl1.eve-files.com/media/corp/verite/20150512.png, 
  why did op do that ? 
  i do n't know . 
  try directx 9 ? 
  works on integrated i5 graphics at my workplace . 
  on wine too . 
  it might depend on the cpu since some ( < 3xxx ? ), 
  might not have shader model 3 . 
  i imagine you 'd have much success as the coalition map curator with this attitude . 
  i even linked you the actual map . 
  it does n't care about this `` but we own such and such systems '' . 
  it has algorithms , bias-free , proven by time and community . 
  i could go and render my own version where shadow of xdeath and bot would be some tri + solar coalition , trying to predict the future . 
  it would be worth shit though . 
  op ( and any curator for this map ) should n't mess with this stuff and should just group alliances according to their ( proper ) coalitions . 
  as i said , you should 've just let the renderer and time do their job . 
  bl is already starting to show on the alliance influence map . 
  this wo n't have such dynamic . 
  so ** let it be gone ** . 
  that way there are actual changes on the map . 
  and no unclear rules . 
  well good luck then . 
  it 's an important community project , that op wants to maintain .
