  frequency of supercap deaths has gone up after garage door cynos fix , has n't it ? 
   but what i 'm sick of are all the people , saying `` oh !, 
  do you really believe dbg will deliver '' or `` do you really think they will fix a bug before it goes into the game this time '' etc. 
  you must be new . 
  it is this way because of ** consistent ** fuckups every update over the years . 
  and even before ps2 soe 's reputation was already dirty . 
  aka `` indar is shitting itself '' . 
  i think the crown is the reddest here because of how easily a point is flipped there , not because of how often it 's actually attacked . 
  crown is just an easy point flip , hence the redness on this map . 
  actual big fights are pretty rare there i 'd say . 
   viewing important info such as ship/pod explosion stats takes me less time using the old map . 
  new one saves last stats you used at the top of the list , so i doubt that . 
  i have very few problems with the new map but they are very annoying . 
  * left click-drag rotates flattened star map ( probably just a matter of habit ), 
  the rest is fine after a bit of tuning .

  * miller vs, 
  that fucking intro , it 's 2am here :d, 
  pilots are literally hitler . 
  i can get good fps in empty warpgate on live too . 
  i will see how it improves after they deploy ... 
  they 've done this before and removed my outfit with 5 active ( at the time ) people in it . 
  i liked it more on t5amc than on cougar . 
   esf : wing mount : a2am : utility : lock-on range certification is now functioning, 
  fixing the bugs that * matter * . 
   esf nose-guns, 
  do i need anything specific to enable them ? 
  or maybe i just did n't notice the difference , idk . 
  it 's certainly visible in people 's videos though . 
  a2am , nmg , developers ( aka production quality ) . 
  best ? 
  meh , pretty average , my game only crashed once . 
   do dgc actually use version control ? 
  a while ago i saw a comment saying they do n't . 
  i did n't believe it . 
  i do n't want to believe it . 
  having a high end pc ( 4770k@4.4ghz, gtx 770 ) and using high/ultra settings w / low shadows i 'm ** finally ** no longer bottlenecked on cpu . 
  global cpu load approaches 60 % w / hyperthreading on , a very good value . 
  judging by this multithreading was certainly in the patch . 
  downside : game seems to stutter a bit more . 
  i too had denial . 
   why are you so aggressive ? 
  are consistent fuck ups for more than two years not enough ? 
  yes , multithreading improved load balancing and fps but added more stuttering . 
   he told me to shut the fuck up, 
  i agree . 
   he tried to justify his anger his anger with a `` i was here first '' argument, 
  he told you that people that were here for 2 + years are fucking fed up . 
  cpu performance is now pretty great but stuttering needs a look . 
  it becomes very frequent at times . 
  if you monitor global cpu load now it 's a lot higher and evenly distributed across cores . 
  that 's the primary reason to believe that mt changes made it into the patch from pts . 
  fun game . 
  vertical fov ( ps2 ) is always less than horizontal ( standard for fov setting in games ) . 
  74 hfov means  105 vfov which is actually pretty big and standard for pc games . 
  what needs to be customizable is vehicle and maybe ads fovs . 
  144hz masterrace . 
   remember when new bro 's in t1 tackle were useful ? 
  six years ago ? 
  / r/infantryside, 
  i heard there are no vehicles in cod or some other pr0singleplaystylemlgnoscope game , maybe you should try that . 
  thankfully we are not ( fully ) devolved into that yet ( though your whining does the job ( i.e : said walls ) , so i guess congrats ) . 
  i just closed the video after he took the apple out of hf acid . 
  too much nope . 
  also the way he shows off the nitric acid bottle while wearing bulky gloves and shorts . 
  i partly wanted to see it drop on the floor and shoot million droplets everywhere . 
  to some people itt : call me an elitist all you want but i come to listen to the music . 
  * whole * pieces of music . 
  clapping is a big , at times annoying , distraction and i wish it could 've been done once at the end of the performance . 
  i also dislike coughing , ruffling music sheets and generally too long pauses between movements . 
  they 're supposed to be quick gaps to prepare for a mood change , not noise concertos . 
  it 's a bug where your model kinda bends backwards . 
  edit : that thing https://twitter.com/muldoonx9/status/601896620574179328, 
  such community . 
  he did n't say what you did was wrong . 
  he was saying that video of a mossie swarm focus firing a bunch of slow big targets is pretty boring . 
   well for starters i would say and end to corruption, 
  what does electing leftist party has to do with ending corruption ? 
  op is a retard but eve is not spreadsheets . 
  as a solo/sometimes anchor logi `` eve = spreadsheets '' is an insult . 
  i do n't even use overview as much as tactical overlay . 
  can we make this a `` daily reminder '' thread ? 
  hey ccp , here 's an idea . 
  you update your awesomium browser backend to html5 support and we get both a good browser * and * eve soundrack ingame via soundcloud . 
  sounds like a good deal . 
  just got contacts a month ago . 
  the thing is - you 're touching it not with your wrinkly finger but with a very soft , thin and correctly shaped piece of wet polymer/gel . 
  it 's just a soft cool touch feeling , almost pleasant ( well , not really but it 's surprisingly fine ) . 
  as a programmer i do n't understand why they ca n't update awesomium release they use . 
  igb is very handy . 
  yes , i 'm just aware of general concept . 
  still though , it should be a big improvement over chromium 3.0 base we have now . 
  it 's not funny it 's the damn truth . 
  it 's all on indefinite hold now . 
  stated on the dev stream couple of weeks ago . 
  if it was op with lockons and the other 2 esfs without them , op probably would 've shredded them both . 
  so much for your `` teamwork '' argument . 
  my titan . 
  hostile pos grid . 
  hostile sabre burns at me .
