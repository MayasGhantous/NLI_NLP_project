  with heavy , you press a button and become twice as good at surviving , thus , killing ( main thing to do in this game ) before being killed . 
  so they are both combat classes and not support . 
  why does one have no chances against the other ? 
  ( no , flanking does n't help ), 
  killing stuff is the main thing in this game ( fps ) . 
  flying does n't help me kill enemy has . 
  hey , since we 're reducing effectiveness of spawn beacons can we get back the maneuverability for spawn capsules to how it used to be ? 
  take a look at this [ old classic ] ( http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/major-eve-alliance-disbanded-by-defector ) . 
  what programming experience do you have to say that java is not reliable and efficient ? 
  it 's one of the industry standards for enterprise and server software . 
  it 's such an annoying stereotype when you use/develop using java daily and have good experience with it :\\, 
  java dev for 2 + years . 
  it 's pretty fun . 
  probably not , it seems to purge files that are n't in the current tq build . 
  always said that killing everybody when continent locks is cancer . 
  it will drive newbies out because they already have no clue what 's going on and then they get killed for no reason by some stern voice announcing some capture . 
  another bug that was in since the beta . 
  i wish this meta shit could be kept strictly to the `` meta-shit '' subs . 
  i come to reddit to participate in the communities that interest me and the `` meta-shit '' community is not one of them . 
  super cereal reddit politics are going on . 
  can we go back to whining about balance ? 
  this meta shit is too autistic for my taste . 
  understandable reasons but why hold it off pts though ? 
   why should i come back to planetside ? 
  ( not me personally , i know you all hate me ) . 
  pretty important thing : they 've finally somewhat fixed performance . 
  cpu load is now much more evenly spread across the cores . 
  any windows since xp including 10 has a 32 bit and a 64 bit release . 
  other people here have no clue . 
  this needs to go ... 
  hmm ... what does this mean for bombers ? 
  snipe 0-tank battleships return ? 
  i was never asked about any toolbars or such shit by java installs . 
  i do n't have the option in settings checked either . 
   third party libraries, 
  this really amazed me first . 
  there are * multiple * open source java libraries for anything you can imagine . 
  you mean you clicked ` yes ' in the box that asked you to run an unknown piece of software ? 
  ahhhh , so that 's what it is !, 
  i 'm reading this thread like `` what malware ? 
  what toolbar ? '', 
  because i always use offline installers . 
  man , i just thought how * fun * would that be with an unupgraded banshee nowadays ... 
   90 % of the time lagswitching daltonist, 
  are you serious here ? 
  what server ? 
  installed it last week . 
  i use offline installer , it does n't have ads as someone here pointed out . 
  or just logi . 
  i figured the bit about entering from above after i stopped jumping on my mossie while repairing . 
  the question is : why and how the fuck is the exit point dependent on the way and place that you * entered * the vehicle ? 
  do you try to reuse the point of entry as point of exit ? 
  because i ca n't imagine any other plausible explanation . 
  yeah it 's annoying but i 'm kinda used to it and just do it automatically , look for a place , land , repair . 
  i also often fly with comp . 
  i feel it gives me a moment under flak . 
  for a2g , of course . 
  ship it . 
  i like / r/eve , / r/planetside , / r/schweiz , / r/chemistry to name a few . 
  how do you spin it into them removing those ? 
  for me , nothing changed , and probably nothing will change , except a bunch of `` shithead children '' \u2122 screaming in / r/all . 
  i just woke up and opened reddit for the first time today and you say i 'm some other guy ? 
  had quite a bit of fun with saron yesterday http://i.imgur.com/jq6t0h9.png, 
  did n't use it since mbt secondary changes and cof seems better somehow . 
  maybe i 'm imagining stuff . 
  yeah for a2a i might as well fly as la since i do n't land anyway . 
  but i find that flying as engi lets me concentrate fully on fighting till the end rather than on ejection timing . 
  edit : although there are moments when i want to deny a kill but still it 's too much : effort : for me . 
  huh so other people also use \u0445\u0435\u0432\u0438\u043a-\u0445\u0443\u0435\u0432\u0438\u043a , 
  medics are fine maybe even a tiny bit op ( esp . 
  in balls ) , they 're just overshadowed by heavy 's shield and rl . 
  fuck all automated stuff . 
  mfw 0 comments from dbg itt, 
   oh and who the fuck had the idea of putting a damn av mana turret on a godforsaken esf, 
  it 's not comparable . 
  esf is much more visible and has many more threats ( flak , lockons besides just ap rounds ) . 
  as a pilot , using hornets for their intended purpose is pita ( trying to clear the battlefield ) , since you just invite ap shots to take their aim time and reck you . 
  for hunting lone tanks and infantry they are fun . 
  as a tanker that knows `` the other side '' i just accept them . 
  was there an actual devpost saying that these changes are on hold ? 
  or are vs just wishful ? 
   pounder outperforms all nc max av weapons . 
  say again ? 
  we 're talking about av performance here . 
  ai performance is a separate broken thing that devs do n't care to fix . 
  i have a sad feeling that broken in terms of balance stuff is their primary income . 
  if someone from the team actually reads this : know , that after performance improvements , the only thing i wait for to resub for membership is a good , working balance pass . 
  10/10 would become a billionaire and win eve again, 
  is this the case of so called `` f2p whale '' ? 
   this sub is so cancerous because of it being released f2p people think everything should be and they make it their holy mission in the game to not spend a dime . 
  that 's what all `` i resubbed '' posts were about recently . 
  that 's a weird looking star ( or something ) ... 
  pls . 
  current ones just mock my chem skills and i remember being good at it in high school , 
  can we unnerf drop pods now ? 
  except you 're 10 times as big and limited to 300m while hovering above targets that oneshot you . 
  i would except it 's hard to switch when you have 90k certs in a character . 
   currently 95 % of people use stealth on esfs, 
  [ citation needed ], 
  did i say anything about killing a lone defenseless mbt ?
