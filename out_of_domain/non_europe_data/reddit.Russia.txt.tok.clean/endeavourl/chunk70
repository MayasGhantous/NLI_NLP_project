  another change - another drama that wo n't last a day . 
  font is fine , it 's in line with other modern designs . 
  why would you have 16 personal ( i.e. 
  not alliance management ) accounts ? 
  just to have a fun job of acquiring and dumping an isk equivalent of a mothership every month ? 
  in general , it 's hard to go back to single-player/matchmaking games after you 've tasted something that is sandbox/open-world . 
  agree on most/all points . 
  still waiting on good balance pass until resubbing . 
  first time i see this . 
  how does it relate to the swiss pass for tourists/visitors ? 
  can non-residents get it ? 
  is there a setting to limit my front page to strictly * one * drama per month , please ? 
  thank you . 
  read : no , fuck off . 
  dear reddit users , some of you are a bunch of awful whiny children . 
  [ that shit ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/outoftheloop/comments/39bzdf/why_was_rfatpeoplehate_along_with_several_other/ ? ), 
  happened < a month ago and lasted for a week ( a week too long ) . 
  old ( non-cleartype ) windows font antialiasing to be precise . 
  this thread is fun . 
  as someone who develops an eclipse plugin for a living , this thread is funny . 
  it has it 's `` moments '' , as every other complex piece of software does but people will make anything into `` literally hitler '' . 
   i 'd rather drive eve players to voat.co than support this site under current leadership . 
  right . 
  off . 
  go , do it . 
  unmod ** yourself ** , delete account , biomass . 
  for those who do n't want to download 100mb gif : http://gfycat.com/miniaturesnappyborzoi . 
  in typical russian ghetto there 's no earth pin/wire at all yet microwaves work fine . 
  do you seriously think that every internet petition signature is made by an individual person ? 
  and before they said they 'd reimburse them . 
  and now you need to scoop regions of sbus . 
  in a week . 
  : ccp :, 
  because in reality nobody gives a shit . 
   never disconnect while posting, 
  you heard the order , people !, 
  get on your good connections . 
  i thought this was common knowledge . 
  i guess i read too much ( or just enough ) . 
  so it 's better for a whole class of vehicles to collect dust instead ? 
  retarded rule is retarded . 
  more anoms is good ... 
  on the other hand , fuck anoms , they make me sick in their repetitiveness . 
  i too love bugs that are 3 years old . 
  delete la already . 
  what russian owners ? 
  you mean those guys that have dbg among * an ocean * of other assets held through subsidiaries ? 
  is that like ... the most burning issue with the prowler ? 
  this is my attempt at no caps joke, 
  please rate my performance, 
  you got downvoted but it bothers me too every time . 
  honestly tomcats need a lot more attention than coyotes . 
   you 're basically fuzzying out real hackers, 
  i dunno , to me it looks like they 're just playing the game . 
  i once hit 10k and then i hit 0 after certing an mbt . 
  i was gunning . 
  then i could spare certs for doing a full build . 
  it 's not boring when you 're aware of the multitude of choices behind the scenes , and difficulty . 
  at least for me it 's not only much better than whatever-stone but also very enjoyable in itself . 
  lol . 
  please name * the most powerful * skill in the game ? 
  hint : there 's no such thing in poe, 
  there 's not even `` the most powerful build '' , there are always several . 
  edit : like kripp and rania are playing completely different builds/skills , what `` most powerful skill '' are you talking about ? 
  you might want to visit a doctor . 
  `` controversial '', 
  nice list of unrelated subs bro ( except 2nd and 3rd ) . 
   the first was banned before your time . 
  so do i need to feel oppressed now or something ? 
  same thing here . 
  something broke . 
  clearing cookies helped it but only for 12h . 
  goddamn , it sucks to think that i 'll probably have to stop using opera soon :(, 
  opera 12 same thing . 
  please do n't abandon us , we love that browser too much :(, 
  applies to path of exile as well . 
  while you 're at it could you reduce the shield transfer sound effect volume ? 
  it stands out so much it 's annoying . 
  u w0t m8, 
  `` what ? 
  also , it is not a clone , it is literally * the * spiritual successor of diablo 2 . 
  twitch vods is a laggy piece of shit , at least in eu . 
  a ` clone ' is a derogatory term , really does n't fit with poe . 
  and learning the tree does n't remove the complexity and depth from it or a million of different mechanic combinations in the game . 
  yes i am . 
  nice edge though . 
  i dislike hearthstone as much as anyone here , bet here 's the difference : i do n't hate rania and do n't think it 's acceptable for me to write any opinions on other people 's wives . 
  this sub is cancer for that lately . 
  you mixed your percentages . 
  how is this upvoted ? 
  what did you do to / r/planetside ? 
  3 ) the word ` carebear ' has been pronounced as ` karibas ' for a while which together with 1 and 2 lead to ` krab ' . 
  [ oh and by the way ] ( http://cs.pikabu.ru/images/big_size_comm/2012-11_4/13533512794328.gif ), 
  good cpu allows me to never turn off brackets . 
  absolutely nothing . 
  but pro-vehicle play posts are usually buried here . 
  wtf how did you link to a 3 yo vod ? 
  did n't twitch nuke them all ? 
  while phoebe changes are a bit overtuned ( i agree that the range nerf was too much , i also liked range variety before ) , this eve is dieing is boring to read . 
  ultimately , ccp ( at least they said in phoebe blogs ) does n't want you to travel the whole map with little effort .
