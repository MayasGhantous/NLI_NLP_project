  they want you to participate in local conflicts as smaller entities and i agree with that . 
  and although impenetrable fortresses ( * cough * deklein ) and nerfs to suitcase carriers feel bad i 've yet to see someone propose a good fix for that , not exploitable for big entities to project like they used to . 
  to rephrase ... [ `` we make crutch and then defense it '' ] ( http://www.sc2quoteoftheday.com/?date=04-jan-12 ), 
   because those people have good aim , it 's not the class . 
  or maybe ( just maybe ) it 's both . 
   all frigates tackle, 
   rats from every faction, 
   large weapons deal 50 % less damage, 
   base velocity increased by 50 %, 
  this is honestly the most annoying thing . 
  it 's like they tried to give them better ai but just made them run around non stop . 
  push button , receive cert . 
   i guess if land and air vehicles are also unbalanced , infantry need two unbalanced classes to even things out ,, 
  yep . 
  every area of the game is pretty fun , yet * every one * has that one piece of shit mechanic that makes you want to log out and never return . 
   sub 1 kd, 
  as someone who ( unknowingly ) went on a 3h boat trip on some country-wide school trip-day ( i forgot the name , it 's in june ) , i do n't like kids in switzerland . _ . 
  but seriously , in switzerland it seemed that kids are allowed much more freedom than here in russia , at least from what i 've seen . 
  like running around , talking loudly etc. 
  e : although some people here are saying exactly opposite :d, 
  worthless as in not winning when you were jumped and actually using it to breach ? 
   given that nmg/adrenaline are primarily reactive in their function . 
  but but but i thought ha was the breaching class ? 
  now non-has must not only endure your win-button but * like * too ? 
  itt : out of the classes that should be on equal footing it 's fine when one has 50 % more hp . 
  because we abuse it , so it 's fine . 
  people use that as an excuse to turn on their shield at the start of engagement . 
  enlighten us . 
  edit : inb4 `` aim for the head '', 
  ha ( combination of shield , medkits , 0.75 / non-lmg access , easy rocket primarying ), 
  shotgun/raven max, 
  max in general, 
  vanguard shield, 
  fyi glycerin is alcohol . 
  that ticked me off :p, 
  i 'd like some code examples that work differently under different java releases ( let alone updates ) . 
  in this sub-thread : people talking about stuff they have no idea about . 
  java bad !, 
  me no likey ! '', 
  fyi , java is one of the most used programming languages/technologies in the world . 
  the amount of software made using it is staggering . 
  i liked the power jump that lmp/gmp provided , that was one of the first amazing things i learned about the way the game works in general . 
  also multi proj mobs are kinda `` meh '' now ... 
  so you 'd rather we had 6-12 months more of this ? 
  there were * weeks * of changeless maps like that . 
  you people forget how ** really fucking boring ** eve became before phoebe . 
  phoebe was like an attempt to breathe some air into dead lungs . 
   dominion was better than this shit, 
   but i would rather go back to when n3 + cfc owned the whole cluster than have things stay the way they are . 
  http://go-dl1.eve-files.com/media/corp/verite/20141012.png that ? 
  really ? 
  because nothing was happening . 
  when it stays the same for several months , it is everything in context of sov-talk ( the one that we 're having here ) . 
  edit : you 've downvoted me , must mean that you 're right / s, 
  this post is bad and you should feel bad . 
  if 3 buttons with a track list is too hard to implement - fine . 
  what is not fine , is trying to force feed `` dying whales '' and `` goat rape '' labeling it as `` 0.0 music '' . 
  or just cut the ominous bullshit that 's not even music . 
  well thank you for the soundcloud , but do i really need to launch a separate browser to experience * ingame * music ? 
  what if i do n't have enough memory for a memory hog called chrome ? 
  as a programmer , i just ca n't get this . 
  so we still have ingame music in some form . 
  as in `` we have the ability to play music files from within out software '' , right ? 
  we also have the ability to switch tracks , as shown by jumping between different security levels and missions . 
  what is it that makes it * impossible * to add to that system : a ) a `` next '' button , b ) a list of tracks , c ) ( optional ) a `` previous '' and `` pause '' buttons ? 
  i just do n't get this . 
  now that you said it , the soundtrack was one of the things that kept me coming back as a newbie . 
  it created such great atmosphere while i was exploring stuff in highsec . 
  phoebe was the first in a series of post-dominion changes . 
  the map state that i liked is arguably the apex of dominion sov and it stayed in this state for little less that a year . 
  where can you get id 's of the old streams so you can watch them ? 
  i want to rewatch some races , that was exciting as fuck . 
  you know what 's funny , just a month ago fozzie was literally considered a god here . 
  edit : also i ca n't remember any time where there were literally * no combat changes * on the sov map for 3 + months . 
  do you ? 
  or do you want 8x that size , lagless ? 
  or maybe 16x ? 
  or maybe we 'll admit that we 'll stuff systems full of people until they break . 
   people are upset because they fear the continuation of what they see happening now - corps leaving non-cfc alliances to fold into imperium . 
  so uh ... is it ccp 's fault ? 
  i wanted to write a big post of how players asked and cheered for the changes we see now . 
  but you 've basically just said it . 
   the phoebe changes were a complete blindside and a huge blunder that showed just how out of touch the devs are with the playerbase . 
  and that 's why playerbase cheered ccp greyscale for doing the right thing * for once * with phoebe , right ? 
  maybe if you ca n't respond to an interceptor reinforcing your system you should n't hold it ? 
  like , we ( x.i.x ) are losing mto constellation right now and i do n't see anything wrong with that - it 's not like we live anywhere close ( edit : correction , it seems locals are fighting back , except for mto which we lost since it was under our claim and far away ) . 
  also , if you know it was an inty maybe you should n't do a big formup but just send like 5 people per reinforced structure and take it back in like 15 minutes . 
  reddit hates motherships , it 's official :(, 
  i can see ccp implementing this and half the world drowning in tears . 
  you seem mad, 
   in a way ps2 was not meant to be played ( constant hopping around the map and little to no combined arms gameplay ) . 
  if it 's not meant to , it 's got to be fixed , right ? 
  alkaizer did n't die to hidden monsters . 
  yeah , because attacking in the home region of a small coalition will end well . 
  [ there ] ( https://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/perrigen_falls/mto2-2 ) , on the other hand ... 
  meh , from playing a lot of cm wizard in d3 back in the day , i just hold space automatically when needed , 
  i 'd actually watch him play it for couple of days . 
  it 's a casual game but it can be very fun . 
  and hey , anythingbuthearthstone , right ? 
   if you do fozzie sov in a retarded way it might take that long,
