  i 'm getting close to 100m sp . 
  do n't know what you people are upset about . 
  it was this way for 10 years and it 's fine . 
  +2 imps are dirt cheap . 
   i 've seen null sec bros refuse to jump into a clone because they did n't want to lose sp . 
  lol what a bunch of krabs . 
  not even krabbing isk , krabbing sp . 
  pretty much . 
  i tried to think it through , but it 's much less head cracking to grab 3 leech nodes , a gem and faster attacks/frenzy . 
  it ended up working pretty well if i do n't get bursted and do n't run out of mana . 
   i 'll resub when they do this balance change . 
  me too . 
  skeleton-still-waiting . jpg, 
  i mostly play alone/in a squad of 2-3 . br100 . 
  use instant action to try to find a good fight if there are none close . 
  just make a chaos orb one or something . 
  no way this will pass . 
  or just use a flanking class ( la/inf ) . 
  works more than 50 % of the time . 
  that 's scapegoating for you . 
  lol nice job . 
  you 'd never think salt can be so delicious . 
  i have a simple overview setup made entirely in game like 4 years ago . 
  i do n't want to change because `` worksforme '' . 
  i do n't see anything wrong with needing to use a 3rd party tool to tap into undocumented features like font styles . 
  it always selects it for you and it reduces the cooldown on the pre selected one . 
  tomcats do nothing to help new players . 
  * hurpdurp i have a total of 1.5 hours in an esf and i think tomcats are perfectly fine hurpdurp *, 
  nice brigading, 
  taken with nexus 5 ( 3x3 panorama , hdr + ), 
  the place is near schw\u00e4galp , switzerland , if anyone interested . 
   tell me , how would have your reacted ? 
  i would n't post tirades about giving credits for 80x80 px images in the first place . 
  so where does it fail ? 
  what are better mobile image examples for similar pictures ? 
  why , yes , i would definitely like to keep my money to myself since the devs decided to stop any balancing whatsoever . 
  better make some more ns rls , i 'm sure people will keep buying them . 
  fracture , striker , banshee , you name it . 
  [ i also use this one on my phone ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:2011-06-14_08-28-22_switzerland_kanton_z\u00fcrich_z\u00fcrich_holzwiese.jpg ) . 
  i 'm jealous !, 
  i 've walked/climbed from braunwald to gumen and i 'd very much like to get even higher , but i 'm not exactly experienced enough . 
  maybe one day ... 
  everyone is talking about up/down . 
  here 's the real question : how the fuck do you fall in into a toilet ? 
  yeah , touching it with your ass is not pleasant but actually falling in ? 
  do you people have meter wide toilets ? 
  when putting your credit card image on the internet i 'd personally go for big , solid black rectangles for : opsec : , not for coloring out each number manually . 
  never forget :(, 
  12 , still using it , 'cause the new one is still too `` chromy '' . 
  ctrl tab works as you 'd expect but for the same reason it 's kinda useless when you have a lot of chats/other `` background '' windows open . 
  then it 's just a big list of mostly same icons . 
  they 've made this mistake in the past and it does n't seem to have taught them . 
   ccps pr department, 
  so you ( and many others ) want to hear sweettalks while devs work on their thing without communication ? 
  am i getting these `` better pr '' calls right ? 
  not friday , but i remember one before ny holidays . 
  also the period with bi/weekly thursday updates with patches often slipping to saturdays/mondays . 
  it 's all the same thing really . 
  tuesday should just be the default deploy day for anything semi major . 
   when it 's on the roadmap , it 's going in the game . 
  or into `` archived features '' ... 
  as someone who plays ~ 5h a week i feel like i wo n't sell anything in this game ever . 
  i also got an exalt drop recently and i think i 'll just buy a five-link or something . 
  playing rain of arrows ranger with frenzy . 
  play planetside 2 , soe/dbg will easily beat ccp at being `` worst in the industry '' . 
  i would love to see an actual russian gateway instead of this licensed servers crap . 
  lol soe bans accounts based on stats to counter cheaters and yet they fail to ban cheaters and ban legit players instead . 
  check out planetside 2 speedrunning . 
  everything soe makes can be assumed to be a bug-ridden piece of shit until proven otherwise . 
  ccp have their low moments but at least their product works . 
  thank you for your contribution to the discussion !, 
  -40 and random he hate for the truth . 
  the guy died 4 times to vehicles and 4 times to ivi but according to this thread vehicles literally eat children . 
  never change , / r/planetside . 
   one class gets ars , one gets snipers , one can fly , one automatically wins against all other classes , and engineers to pair with vehicles . 
  ^ basically . 
  i said it a couple of months ago : there 're classes havin fun and there 's a class that shits on those having fun . 
  i 'm expecting la to do so . 
  but as we can see from the stats above , the majority chooses the win button over flying as they progress through the game . 
  your bank probably assumed it was a fraud . 
  maybe they could n't reach you and reverted the transaction . 
  i also paid with debit and it worked fine . 
  for purposes of internet payments credit = debit afaik , with exception of maestro/electron cards which will probably not work ( but may do ) . 
  vs or tr . 
  nc 's is flat , boring and generic electric guitar . 
  this is the second update . 
  first one was 20mb and took 30 minutes . 
  sometimes launcher just does this kind of thing , very slow downloads . 
  oh well , no testing for me today . 
  it 's an architectural change for eve server to calculate and cache all of your skill effects on a separate node ( server ) as opposed to calculating them on a sol ( system ) node every time there 's a session change . 
  it should make mass simultaneous session changes more bearable , e.g. 
  mass jumping . 
  monkeysphere \u2122 , nevarforget !, 
  i 'm 76 and i guess i 'll finish my character in standard . 
  3 months is too little when you 've got a day job and stuff . 
  edit : i also was on vacation during the league . 
  [ sure ] ( http://www.speedtest.net/result/4667292315.png ) , [ sweetheart ] ( http://www.speedtest.net/result/4667294763.png ) . 
  yep , why bother with math when there 's a rating . 
  20 \\* 8/30 \\* 60 = 0.089 mbit/s , a bit different from the 15-20mbit / s i was getting earlier which is not even my top possible download speed . 
  some tool that according to russian forums allowed you to not appear in local , and that allegedly was used by some pl member ( s ) to kill krabs that may or may not have been botting .
