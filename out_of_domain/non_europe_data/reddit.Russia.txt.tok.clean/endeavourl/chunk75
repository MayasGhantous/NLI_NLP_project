  soon \u2122, 
   remove reloads in air, 
  we do have some english speaking guys in geminate and major ops usually have half-english comms . 
  not sure about ustz though . 
  maybe try tri . 
  or something ? 
  these dudes, 
  this might look like a wall of gibberish but it literally takes < 10 minutes . 
  and then you have the same usual eve , but on linux . 
  the launcher just launches eve exefile somewhere from c : \\ program data , so it results in a new settings directory under % appdata % \\ ccp . 
  you just copy the old settings to the new location .

  it 's a lot of money , but honestly , what did you expect from a huge * levitating * model ? 
  what kind of mental gymnastics allow you to justify `` removing reloads in air '' ? 
  when do you think aircraft should reload ? 
  i 'm just interested , it 's fascinating . 
  so ... i fire for 2 seconds , and then fly for a minute to reload at a base ? 
  you might want to get on the lib balancing , that thing still has some ammo capacity . 
  itt : waaaaa why ca n't * i * put the price on the stuff i want !, 
  it 's a unique model with a magnetic levitation system . 
  does anyone even know how much the latter part alone costs ? 
  because i do n't , but i imagine it 's not cheap . 
  add the model , detailing , painting , exclusiveness . 
  if you ca n't afford the result - it might mean just that . 
  wear at night for best effect . 
  the most funny thing is that most people whining about shotguns - pretty situational weapons ( work only in front of your nose ) , will defend overshield abuse - omnipowerful ( works in any situation ) skillless ( push a button , no need to aim or anything ) ability . 
  i guess the ability to kill them through their win-shield does something to their judgment . 
   for infantry play heavy assault until you, 
  get bored to death . 
   1v1 's where only your aim and skill will pull you through, 
  yeah , or the enemy has chosen to not be * default class * this time , meaning an autowin . 
  pushing a button with no other abilities . 
  such fun . 
  operation : make splash screen , phase 2 . 
  a r c h i v e d b o i s, 
  comparing default gun with purchasable lowers relative stats of the former . 
  since when is biased recoil considered a gain ? 
  the only thing that video proves is that many vanguard drivers are too lazy to `` click on the esf '' , if you know what i mean . 
  just to make sure : biased = goes to a side ? 
  how does that equal 100 % controllable ? 
  you have to control 2 lines instead of just up-down one . 
  do n't know why you 're so downvoted . 
  every 17 y/o girl may have her mind on just about anything , be it studies and future career or taking selfies . 
  while every 17 y/o boy is obsessed with either what he 's going to do while at service , or , more often , how he can avoid it , what diagnoses may help , where to get money for possible bribes , etc etc. 
  a jita 4-4 wormhole , even . 
  so i do n't remember last time i needed to visit their site , but out of curiosity i opened it and did n't notice much difference from , say , jquery or github . 
  how did other people learn ? 
  most people who learned 3 years ago have moved on to better games . 
  `` almost '' `` identical '', 
  not really , no , they 're both `` plasma '' , that 's about it for similarities . 
  uncut , supers pov with comms ? 
  why , thank you !, 
  i wanted to make some for a while but : effort :, 
  i rebound unlock to alt-click ( replaced `` look at '' bind ) . 
  very useful as a logi . 
  so i visit like 4 ctas in a row , balls blue , and then i stay late at work and this happens / o \\, 
   deployable by la, 
  yes, 
   pm your email . 
  aaaand i 'm already disinsentivized . 
  irc  all . 
  bold ^ move ^ let 's ^ see ^ if ^ it ^ pays ^ off, 
  shit code is shit . 
  e : downvotes ? 
  do n't tell me this game code quality and development process is not shit , because facts say otherwise . 
  it 's * utterly * bad . 
  nothing ever works as it should . 
  something is always broken . 
  shit code is shit . 
  intelligent routing platform . 
  i came . 
  let me rephrase that : `` something major is always broken '' . 
  case in point : the spawn system . 
  what if i told you that a blown up sunderer ought not to end the fight , but to shift the fight into the field between bases ? 
  so , let me get this straight . 
  vehicle ai capability was nerfed to shit with he/heat changes a year ago . 
  so the only purpose of a tank now is to kill suderers . 
  but you want to restrict that too ? 
  literally, 
  i 'd actually continue membership if the game was n't as bug-ridden and had an actual good no-half-measures balance pass . 
  membership value is fine for me . 
  til kil2 was n't always kil2, 
  e : looking at skills to get rid of on my main as we speak, 
  drag select the text and click reply, 
  there 's a sp issue ? 
   skill trading is a step closer to pay-to-win, 
  until you can buy skills irl there will be no p2w . 
  not in pvp or leadership at least . 
  not helping , but this reminds me . 
  dbg ( then soe ) removed my 1.5 y/o outfit with at least 4 active people along with some others . 
  some were restored . 
  mine was not , even after a pm to dcarey , as he asked . 
  fubar is the permanent state of this game . 
  the points of this comment represent the magnitude of stockholm syndrome this sub has for dbg , times -1 . 
  [ apparently ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/3okmdf/god_fucking_damnit/cvyh6xl?context=3 ) , pointing out continuous fuck ups is a no-no . 
  [ this ] ( https://dgcissuetracker.com/browse/ps-30 ) is not as major of an issue , but the fact that a bug like this can persist since the beta tells you how thing are going here in general .
