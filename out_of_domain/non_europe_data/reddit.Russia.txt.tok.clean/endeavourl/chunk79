  another dbg quality bug . 
  lightning is generally cheaper in certs than an mbt ( which is 10k easily ) . 
  spacebar is bound to `` activate chat '' , fyi . 
  it 's a known issue , i 'd expect a fix tomorrow . 
  i 'm not sure trading real hardware dpi for software sensitivity does any good . 
  software sensitivities work as movement multipliers which means they skip pixels or result in uneven movement . 
  i was actually thinking about halving all my software sensitivities and bumping the mouse up to 3k dpi . 
  yeah i found out that yesterday when i thought it was a good idea to get a new shirt with the particle collision picture . 
  the one that looks like a colorful explosion , 
  try alt + scroll and ctrl + scroll too . 
  wait ... do you mean that when i dock or jump i do n't lose probes ? 
  if you collapse `` scan results '' it goes to normal window color . 
  not sure if it 's intended . 
  with the most recent new scanning system i can finally unbind the old map shortcuts since i do n't really need it . 
  the new systems became almost as functional and more pleasant to use then old ones . 
  but people will wail on any change regardless of how good it actually is . 
  but i do have a small gripe with the new map : the `` blobs of light '' when you look at the `` avg in system '' or especially `` number of pilots docked '' metrics are very dim unless it 's one of the most populated systems . 
  the only way to tell a difference between 10 and 50 players it to hover on individual systems . 
  the star dots on the map could use a brightness increase overall since the new background provides less contrast . 
  / u/ccp _ goliath you seem active here , could you look into these ? 
  yeah , i imagine with rise 's background he has same issues with it . 
  for the `` not enough blobs '' problem , i feel it should behave as a log function , where systems with population of , say , < 500 grow quicker and pass more stages in the visualization giving more differentiation . 
  and high population systems can be visualized almost the same since there are not a lot of them . 
  and for `` invisible systems '' , even though i look at the population statistics it does n't mean that i do n't want to see empty systems , they 're still there !, 
  right now they 're so dim they 're close to invisible . 
  imo a system should n't go ( much ) dimmer than on the `` actual color '' view . 
  vivaldi can access flash from the chrome installation , just be sure to have the same architectures ( 32/64 ) between them . 
   it is n't possible to hit to everyone 's fancy, 
  why do you even bother to say this here when everyone understands that you 're making yet another weapon for the primary class of your game . 
  source ? 
  `` only one faction is allowed an actual * tank * '' . 
  man , i should take a picture of cars standing in the middle of * literally * shit . 
  thick , muddy , autumn shit . 
  that then goes on roads and sidewalks . 
  you 'll probably reconsider then . 
   obviously i do n't know russian law . 
  but in switzerland you definitely ca n't film people on a public space without consent ( german only , sorry ) . 
  well , it 's opposite in russia . 
  streets are public space and you can take pictures , videos and record sound as long as it 's clear to everybody ( i.e. 
  no hidden cameras ) . 
  and it 's good , since in more or less recent years it allowed to gain at least * some * control over bribery of the road inspectors , irresponsible and power abusing law enforcement and generally douchebags like the one in the video . 
  well , since hp can jump 10 % -90 % several times during medkit tanking , it is clearly not instant . 
  28-30 % , not mlg enough ? 
  i 'm sorry , but if in this game i 'm supposed to shoot at targets that are jumping retardedly in front of me while being invulnerable half the time , i choose to find a less retarded game . 
   show me video of you landing headshots on a medkit tanking ha and getting away . 
  show me a video of getting consistent headshots on targets that jump all over the screen . 
  what is has weakness ? 
  assuming the controlling player knows what they 're doing ? 
  show me a video of getting consistent headshots on a jumping medkit tanker . 
  and what if ha also shoots me is the head ? 
  has have 50 % + more hp . 
  oh , so now i need not only to get mlg headshots , but to show wonders of mlg motion forcing a heavy to dump his 100 bullets into anything but me ? 
  got it . 
  assuming he wo n't pull out a medkit or a commissioner . 
  really nice stories , do you have more ? 
   and being shotgun primary player isnt ? 
  a ( presumably ) ha player complaining about shotgun players - the greatest hypocrisy existing in ps2 . 
  [ appropriate music ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddzca3ut5mo ) . 
  http://ps2.fisu.pw/player/?name=phoenix413 try this, 
  +1 to the extend splash radius idea . 
  out of the all ps2oracle graphs you pulled the most meaningless ones , that only show popularity . 
  [ gtfo ] ( http://ps2oraclestats.com/?stat=vkpu&amp;weapon1=802875&amp;weapon2=6126&amp;weapon3=6123 ) . 
  `` hey , a long range tank got a long range secondary !, 
  we can not allow that to happen ! '', 
  the only thing wrong with it is hit rendering and sounds . 
  also i did n't use the harasser one and i think we all learned that its weapons must be balanced separately from mbt 's . 
  on the prowler it 's fine . 
  i dunno , that was pretty fun to me . 
  although nodes regenerating with no delay felt a bit unfair . 
  do n't know how much effect it had on the outcome . 
  are we witchhunting and scapegoating again ? 
  what kind of a reply is this ? 
  those are concrete numbers that tell that a big fight definitely happened in the system . 
  yes , there was a lot of warping but hey , did n't players themselves ask for distributed objectives that do n't depend on a single grid making it laggy ? 
  today was a good day for the new sov , imo . 
  there were fights , skirmishes and most importantly , experience on how to play in the new system . 
  i actually have no idea why tri and nc bros are so angry . 
  our ~ narrative ~ was something like `` it 's fine , we 're learning , made some mistakes '' . 
  i personally had fun . 
  it worked before but they broke it , so they , as any proper company , should fix it . 
  why should we play around bugs and shitty server performance ? 
  edit : downvote ? 
  stockholm syndrome is real . 
  the best is when you throw it out , see it fall on a stationary target , * wait a second more * - and then it explodes in midair right where you 're hanging . 
  source : alt-f4 'd over this shit . 
  we 're more unsatisfied with the management . 
  for example , with how qa is managed , how eu server performance is managed , things like that . 
  biab because awesome . 
  download on demand and new launcher because awesome and easy sisi access . 
  phoebe and aegis because , even though they have their bad moments and more work is required , they manged to break up the great stalemate of 2014 \u2122 . 
   or make the emp unable to go through walls . 
  that 's the only thing that should be changed . 
  unsurprisingly for this game , it 's also the thing that is broken ( i consider it a bug ) . 
  small turd \u2122 . 
  why are you always so salty about has ? 
  are you afraid you might get your button taken away ? 
  so much anger . 
  so many assumptions . 
  never change . 
  kpu is not a popularity metric because it is not an absolute value but a ratio of two .
