  if you know what you 're doing and follow safety rules there 's nothing wrong with having some fun . 
  everybody needs an inspiration source or a hobby . 
  i was talking in general . 
  op 's case has major problems , yes . 
  or it 's probably fake . 
  i 'm not experienced , so i do n't understand what exactly people mean when they talk about oxidizers here . 
  you mean potassium permanganate and bichromate , right ? 
  is the fact of their presence already bad or is it just their location next to organic compounds ? 
  or what ? 
  just want to know more , 
  small off topic psa : if you want to hear moonlight sonata played not by robot but by human being , go there : https://youtu.be/ajqhvm8v2gu?t=25m56s, 
  the third movement especially is so much better . 
   do n't stand still ? 
  do n't adad+ads either . 
  alt-tab gives small dynamic preview too . 
  downvoters apparently do n't like dbg getting money . 
  i remember him fucking around with zombies before a week-league or something . 
  speed zombies were hilarious . 
  and how do they enforce that ? 
  because it 's only capture , you can do the same with obs . 
  there wo n't be any overlays , there will be a capture program capturing and cropping windows , composing them and showing the result . 
  you just went full retard . 
  found the lock on user http://ps2.fisu.pw/player/?name=oscarcar2&amp;show=weapons, 
  in case you 're serious or unaware : this problem has been ignored for 2.5 + years . 
  i want to see lock on halberd for harassers and lock on sniper rifle for ivi . 
  oh , and make them go through cover because there 's no cover in the air . 
  then you fuckers will * finally * get how broken a2ams are . 
  edit : soo seeing the downvotes , people do n't really like the idea of a2am analogues for infantry and ground vehicles . 
  now why is that ? 
  if you ca n't kill a ppa scythe without an aimbot weapon you should uninstall . 
  dbg broke sound levels sometimes in the last 6 months i think . 
  different people have talked about it recently . 
  play with your ` argument ' if you want , it wo n't get any close to reality . 
  wow, 
  excellent post . 
  i especially like your cqc ah-like noseguns ideas . 
  unfortunately we can pretty much expect it to end up in the pile with all other `` tomcat monthly reminders '' you mentioned :(, 
  dbg really hates balancing stuff , air especially , for some reason . 
  wtf that 's the most dust players i 've seen in local ever . 
  like 95 % of swiss i 've been in contact with , either friends , business or passersby , left impressions ranging from `` nice '' to `` best friends forever '' . 
  i 'm gon na cross post this here :, 
   like 95 % of swiss i 've been in contact with , either friends , business or passersby , left impressions ranging from `` nice '' to `` best friends forever '' . 
  and i visited switzerland 7 times , 3-4 weeks each time . 
   is it still not possible to use the mouse for left/right and kb for spinning ? 
  are people still trying to gimp themselves by asking to put two wildly different turn rates on a single analog input ( i.e. 
  mouse ) ? 
  also , do n't use zoom , it only throws off your leading and manoeuvring . 
  i 'm nowhere near the field of physics , let alone having a degree , and i have no problem with terms like `` generations of matter '' or relation between quarks and protons . 
  if someone asks fundamental questions like in op it 's not wrong to expect them to know basics of standard model . 
  and if they do n't know , no one 's saying they ca n't ask another question or do a little research . 
  yep , population of whole siberia is 40m while population of russia is 144m . 
  most of us live in utc +3 - utc +5 zones , closer to cet . 
  on some lore podcast they talked about infinite damage , cap drain and jam strength of concord . 
  they actually have hardware installed in every pod , and they basically tell your ship to self destruct instantly . 
   fun for who ? 
  the select few who can pull off the broken maneuver ? 
  select few ? 
  slow down , press ab , pitch down . 
  if you ca n't do that on a third try in warpgate you 're a fucking retard . 
  yes https://twitter.com/eve_status/status/704609839335534592, 
  wait , i thought this was only a db migration . 
  where 's the big announcement and everything ? 
  edit : nevermind that , the db upgrade was at 24th . 
  yesterday 's dt was `` to perform significant hardware and database configuration changes . '', 
  so yay tq3 i guess !, 
  this is how it should look though, 
  what is tq.eveonline.com then ? 
  there are 3 generations of matter and for a layman such as myself they are vertical columns of fermions ( quarks + leptons ) in [ this table ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/standard_model_of_elementary_particles.svg/375px-standard_model_of_elementary_particles.svg.png ) . 
  there 's probably some deeper meaning to them with a lot of math involved , 
  pitching down is too hard for an average player , i know . 
  tidi is * capped * at 10 % afaik ( at least in most cases ) . 
  after that the * real * lag starts . 
  mods not responding , commands not going through , potential black screens , etc. 
  also remember that this was a lowsec system ( those run additional crimewatch systems ) on a unreinforced node ( probably ? 
  who 'd request to reinforce lowsec ... ) . 
  we 've yet to see the full potential of new hardware but this too is pretty impressive . 
  no , that 's what people who do n't actually fly will tell you because they are a ) butthurt , b ) have n't got a clue . 
  nobody flies to gank newbies . 
  that 's inefficient both in xp and fun . 
  regarding your keybinds , popular choices are binding pitch up/down and throttle analogue to ( mouse ) buttons . 
  these are not requirements but personal preferences . 
  pitch keys allow you to pitch at maximum rate without moving your mouse . 
  throttle analogue stops your esf with a single keystroke ( as opposed to holding s ) . 
  so none of these will improve the actual handling your esf , they 're just different control methods you can choose to use . 
  also move your `` exit air vehicle '' key away from reload and other actively used keys . 
  it is not misinformation , it 's the only real information we have . 
  client can show anything really . 
  mods can be shown as cycling while being off and vice versa . 
  can someone remind me why learning implants are bad and when have we decided that ? 
  something something power creep, 
  itt : people lose their shit because * oh , look , a penny !, 
  no you are n't, 
  what base caps and defences have to do with anything ? 
  unsubbing over 5m/week and some taxes as we speak . 
  since when does a whole mission pay out 5m ? 
  that 's like 7 rats . 
  5 is fine . 
  does your car come with some kind of eternal power source ? 
  where can i get one ? 
  if you want to use that analogy ...
