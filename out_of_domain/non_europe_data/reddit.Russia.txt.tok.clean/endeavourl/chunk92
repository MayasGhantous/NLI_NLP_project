  did you know that when you 're not in ~ 300m radius from the base the capture does n't count for you ? 
  do you know that the whole airgame is roaming around a group of bases finding targets and maintaining air superiority ? 
  do you know that you ca n't play air directly above the front lines because of retarded amount and power of aa ? 
  of course you do n't , it 's obvious that you do n't fly . 
  not gon na believe you until i see some stats . 
  in my experience , the only way you get base caps in esf consistently is by farming spawn rooms . 
  in my , and in general experience , every base has at least one flak source , probably a lockon and maybe some walkers hitscanning you from the next base . 
  you need to be in range of all that to get caps . 
  are you that guy that farms 12-24 fights ? 
  wow , that 's an old one . 
  do n't cut yourself on that edge . 
  i see that [ ground peasant syndrome ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/2x8q20/the_airgame_should_be_one_of_the_first_areas/coy7axc ) is still going strong , including this thread . 
  is it even curable ? 
  actually buffing flares is something actively discussed and supported in those threads . 
  so much for your awareness . 
  i had * very * similar dead end today . 
  same location on global map too , after the first trial . 
  another walled off map earlier : http://i.imgur.com/gxd4g2e.png, 
  i / bug 'd them as you can see but i 'm not sure whether it 's actually a bug . 
  should this be reported ? 
  also 11.72 [ sazhen ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%a1%d0%b0%d0%b6%d0%b5%d0%bd%d1%8c ) and about 0.02 [ versta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/verst ) . 
  just in case , you know . 
  i do n't know where that would be viable except southern indar . 
  everywhere else ceiling seems to be too far from max lock distance to be worth it . 
  `` perfect ample or bust '' flasks . 
  thanks , i 'll look into next snapshots . 
  out of curiosity , why do you need agreements to basically do search requests to a search server ? 
  i get that apis can have restrictions but technically you can just can get search query and response data format from the user either via extension or settings and then browser 's job is just getting and extracting some arbitrary data from arbitrary url . 
  would this still require agreements because that 's kinda bizarre to me ? 
  yeah i realised there were no updates since december , wtf . 
  gripen ( the author ) is an independent developer i think . 
  if you 're getting killed every time while using lockons - git gud . 
  look at all those people claiming that hornets take no/less skill . 
  i bet all of them are experienced in the air . 
  nuking lone risk takers is usually easy , yes . 
  using them against tank columns and not eating shit is very difficult . 
   it 's stupid to think you can or should be able to take on an armor column on your own, 
  why ? 
  take * on * ! = take * out * . 
  the way you speak tank columns should be invincible to solo threats . 
  your e-peen is showing . 
  it 's gross . 
  i 'd like that . 
  the only `` downside '' is that you need to spend a bit more time setting up your effortless kill . 
  harasser people : well , rip . 
  rendering is more important and do n't try to convince anyone otherwise . 
  working game  situational mechanic . 
   i ca n't believe vivaldi released this pos . 
  do you know what a snapshot is ? 
   for absolutely no reason whatsoever, 
  nevermind restricted cone of activation and damage . 
  why , i do like infantry in my tanking game ... 
  same . 
  reducing texture quality helped a bit , but i 'm still crashing 4-6 times a day . 
  i started running process explorer on a second screen and restart the game when it goes over 3.5 gb memory . 
  as someone who does n't know anything about weed stuff : how much is worth a 100 fr ? 
  i 'm imagining you going with overflowing bags full of stuff lol . 
   fucking nothing you goober . 
  the floor in most building has glowing spots among which non-claymores blend very well . 
  you know , there are servers that have metro only 24/7 . 
  many people here would probably like those . 
  win 8.1 too . 
  are you sure it crashes because of standby memory ( which would be obviously weird ) or it just runs into 4gb address space limit ? 
  every time mine crashes it shows 3.7 + memory consumption which means it probably run out of large enough contiguous memory segments to allocate . 
  that does n't mean it 's leaking either , it needs to access and keep in memory a lot of resources simultaneously . 
  i personally hope they are considering going 64 bit client . 
  there are a lot of states memory can be listed as in windows . 
  some memory can be used for non-critical tasks but still be available on demand . 
  task managers can list it as occupied or free and different versions of default windows task manager even count free memory in different ways . 
  for more info , here 's a talk by mark russinovich ( sysinternals tools developer ) : https://channel9.msdn.com/events/teched/northamerica/2011/wcl405, 
  example : http://i.imgur.com/h8w3hlh.png this is all free memory ( afaik ) on my system , even though the actual free pages are close to 0 and the system was restarted recently . 
  it 's physically impossible for poe ( 32 bit process ) to occupy  2 ^ 32 bytes ( 4gb ) . 
  my only complaint is the abrupt live sound cuts . 
  but the video is beautiful , amazing quality . 
  i also have `` very strong '' system ( 4770k and gtx770 ) and it runs 4 player parties fine . 
  there 's some degradation of course ( dipping into 40 fps at times ) , especially when earthquake is on screen but certainly no freezes like you describe . 
  another problem is that it just crashes after running for a while , consuming all 4gb available to the process . 
  yeah , there are some issues , but when some people crash every other map they do - they 're probably playing on toasters . 
   tanked a total of, 
   damage from npcs, 
  checks out . 
  fuck ratting . 
  60 eur for your pc not sucking at everything . 
  i 've had my share of optimizing memory usage by turning off browser and everything else just to have a gaming session and i 'm not going back to doing that again . 
  there 's way too many buttons on that menu , and they all are similar-looking . 
  some context-filtering would be nice . 
  as an eve player , i would prefer proper nested menus interface , but that 's probably too `` spreadsheety '' or something for most people . 
  capital mod volumes are pretty stupid . 
  even if we assume no refitting whatsoever , still , how am i supposed to bring several carrier fits for deployment if i can take no more than 2-3 swap mods with me ? 
  well i 'm running a browser and a work tool right now and i 'm already 7gb in . 
  in demanding games i easily go to 12 . 
  memory is too cheap to save on it and conveniences it brings . 
  lines are helpful but centred labels and decorated buttons make it hard to find what you need instantly . 
   [ i also noticed a ram leak from poe . 
  i have to restart my pc every now and then cus it uses up so much ram ( even when the client is shut down ) ] ( http://e.lvme.me/3risbcx.jpg ), 
  try running process explorer/rammap and see what they tell you . 
  also poe physically can not use more than 4gb of ram . 
  32bit process ( which poe is ) can not use more than 4gb memory . 
  and how does a 32 bit program address memory above 4gb ? 
  i know what a page file is .
