  lockstep does n't cause fps drops . 
  lag in lockstep stops simulation but not rendering . 
   nvidia geforce 720m, 
  96 shader cores ? 
  ddr3 ? 
  what is this , 2007 ? 
  why are you even surprised with your performance ? 
  there are performance issues with perandus and other new effects but many people should stop playing on toasters . 
  so what you 're saying is that your setup grinds to a halt when it encounters anything other than simple open-beta level effects ? 
  well , mine also slows down to 50-60 fps from 140 and i do hope they improve it a bit . 
  but i also appreciate ggg trying to add some graphical candy and modern effects to the game . 
   i understand that for you anything lower than 2 titan x in sli and two i7 from 4700 series with 32gb of ddr4 ram might be toaster but i would keep definition of toaster to the lowest 20 % of user base which this setup does n't qualify to . 
  you 're playing a modern game . 
  simply get a 760/960 and stop wasting dev time . 
  i do n't know what the minimum requirements are since i do n't have access to steam page but i 'm sure it 's easier to update them than to support old junk . 
  also minimal requirements specify a system that is able to launch the game , that 's it . 
   when there are threads full of every version of windows with the same thing . 
  just shows that people do n't understand what memory leak is and lack reading comprehension . 
   a lot of users were conflating regular memory problems with a memory leak . 
  memory leaks and high memory usage are two separate issues . 
  the game absolutely uses too much memory , which we are working on , but was not leaking memory as far as we were aware . 
  chris 's post on w10 leak . 
   how do you not see how that looks ? 
  i do n't care if the two teams are n't the same . 
  seems fine . 
  you seem quite mad though . 
  to me it sounds like your gpu does n't have enough computing power to process a lot of complex gfx * simultaneously * . 
  mine has and drops less fps . 
  you 're right though , i only did some experiments with rendering and writing different kinds of code most of the time . 
  so i mostly go off intuition here that my 1k-something shader cores allow me to compute all perandus mobs effects in parallel giving me less degradation . 
   also how i am supposed to get 760 into a 14 '' notebook ? 
  well idk , but as a developer you should understand demanding reasonably . 
  * tsk tsk *, 
  * lock more broadcasts *, 
  gpu does n't care about fps . 
  as long as you monitor temperature it 's fine . 
  you know that 's a bug right ? 
   esfs should n't be able to hover the way they do, 
  you should n't be able to post the way you do . 
  still had to temp unsub to clear my front page . 
  thanks for the effort though . 
  what should ggg do about player interaction ? 
  last i checked , local n-th generation extremists blew stuff up . 
  and the game is filled with players showing similar behaviour . 
  actually that 's the latest build if you want to use potentially unstable alpha versions . 
  except it 's not an excuse . 
  a2g range limit is 300m due to either render distance or hornet range . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  nobody deserves that for playing a game . 
  are you implying noseguns are a threat to vehicles at ranges of 500m ( or at all lol ) ? 
  because hornets have limited range and pods are slow . 
  it probably could 've outrepaired you . 
  a ) you can repair while running around and taking cover behind a tank, 
  b ) tanks can rotate to face the threat to reduce incoming damage, 
  i 've done this many times . 
  solo esf with a nosegun is a non-threat to a tank . 
  but please continue , this is getting funny . 
  surely you can tank a single esf for 5-7 seconds ? 
   if you do not come out of a repair session ( + cooldown ) with more health than you started with, 
  but you do . 
  so you get to cover/friendly forces/friendly air gets to you/esf makes a mistake/etc . 
  i rdp into my home pc from work and there are only disconnect and sign out when i do that . 
  do n't know why , i did n't configure anything explicitly , but i do have to use process explorer when i actually want to restart . 
  windows 8.1, 
  edit : https://pr.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/4cf4xq/it_guys_will_understand/d1hq1ni take a look, 
  he 's not bad he just forgot his skill-sticks . 
  never traded before , made half of my worth trading this league . 
  loving it . 
  no fun in that though . 
  it 's like catching a fish vs. buying a can of it in supermarket . 
  but apparently [ * some people * ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/4cc5od/psc_new_coins_scammer_umirinbuddy_pic_inside/d1hh4vw?context=3 ) think otherwise . 
  the fact that that comment is marked as `` controversial '' by reddit is pretty sad . 
  did n't you know that accepting a trade without putting in anything of yourself is a bannable offence ? 
  http://www.gggtracker.com/ ca n't see anything there, 
  nothing there explicitly says `` scamming is not allowed '' . 
  itt : people are buttmad because apparently you can shoot at your own stuff . 
  shocking !, 
  i thought this article was a bit over the top and `` trying too hard '' . 
  but then i read the `` not-the-onion '' post and holy shit it 's practically real . 
  i killed that guy many times when i played like 2 months ago . 
  did n't notice anything suspicious . 
  that reloads the content though . 
  hopefully you can fix it . 
  late edit : also thank you guys for reading this sub even though it 's small . 
  can anything be done ? 
  yes . 
  * will * it be done ? 
  nope . 
  it is told to anyone willing to listen and read . 
   whatever podcast/music, 
  do you really want to hear the story then ? 
  next you 're gon na ask for story delivery with - nosound . 
  caching , superfetch , standby memory , google , go . 
   if you alt-tab , it takes even longer, 
  fullscreen windowed ? 
  you can start the game and let it load while alt-tabbed . 
  it * may * run worse windowed but some people said it ran even better for them . 
  just try it i guess . 
  i hate that last screenshot every time it is linked . 
  absolutely misrepresents the way people actually play .
