  now imagine that with the old effect . 
  rip never forget . 
  why they removed it along with the blue flash ship explosion is beyond me . 
  all cheater videos should go into / r/planetside . 
  the only way to make them do something is to continuously shit on them in public . 
  call it not a hackusation but a `` state of the game review '' . 
  bottom line - dbg needs to get dipped into their own shit in public repeatedly for anything to happen . 
  i hate the magrider * and prowler is garbage . 
  \\* not really , i love magrider and vanguard . 
  unfortunately i picked the wrong faction , so i get to dump 10k certs into a garbage tank and drive actual fun ( even undercerted ) tanks once a couple of months . 
  ugh ... not deploying on this one . 
  the xdeath 's `` speech '' today was so much bs . 
  late edit : i remembered one particular detail before going to bed yesterday . 
  is iwi involved in the current war because mittani leaked some kind of `` swinger-party sex tape '' of iwi 's owner/related party ( xdeath referred to them by what sounded like rl name and i do n't remember it ) ? 
  or is it just a cherry on the top of the pile of bs ? 
  i mean wtf is this kind of statement . 
  double edit : the name he uses is `` levy ( lenny ? ), 
  kravitz '' . 
  i 'm not even kidding , you can listen [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/m8jpubcptdc?t=18m40s ) ( 18:45 ish ) or ask your russian speaking friend . 
  i 'm wondering why he 's even decided to say that , wtf is this level of bs . 
  anyone else finds this obsession with number 3 slightly annoying ? 
  anyone ? 
  well , let me take my meds then -_-, 
  can you vaal it to make a rare 1h 6l ? 
  it seems they 're not getting it ... let me try again :, 
  this . 
  this is the only change in 6 + years of playing that actually makes me want to unsub . 
  unfortunately , having good faith , i paid for more than a year in advance . 
  i will * not * get manipulated into doing stupid shit every day for all of my sub 's duration on all of my characters . 
  i will simply log in even less and stop playing . 
  edit : also , is this an insult to our intelligence or what ? 
   so first lets talk a little history . 
  eve had a daily logon incentive for most of it 's existence : the 24 hour skill queue limit . 
  i * definitely * logged in * every day * in the time when i trained jdc , awu , adv spaceship command , logi etc etc. 
  ** not . 
  actually , i will definitely gladly take back the old 24hr skill queue over any fucking sp dailies . 
  edit2 : almost forgot , i do n't have any stuff and you ca n't have it . 
  so i fall behind by 3m + sp per year per character ? 
  should i suck a dick and be happy about it too ? 
  implants are ingame risk management , easily minimized by swapping clones . 
  sp dailies are no-life bullshit management . 
  +5 s are 8 % more effective than +3 s and 2 +3 s are dirt cheap . 
  and on top of this you can use clones , not get podded ( not that hard unless you fly exclusively dictors ) . 
  doing sp dailies is ** 16.6 % ** more effective than not and they 're bullshit boring `` activities '' contributing to burnout and you can not control them , you either do them or suck dick . 
  edit : at max remap the difference is even lower : +5 s are 6 . 
  ( 6 ) % more effective than +3 s. 
  for me it starts eating like half a core after i watch a twitch video . 
  and it does n't stop until restarted . 
  i only ever right click the start button on 8.1 . 
  i always use windows keyboard key since you usually need to type the program name anyway . 
  i thought that was a kugu thing, 
  what the fuck , ads on internal forums ? 
  more like aids . 
  somebody , put that rotten alliance out of its misery . 
  proper anticheat by 2025 . 
  in what way ? 
  maybe i should try 32bit ... 
  i too can blab mindlessly about systems noone here really knows about . 
  just want to say that you 're full of shit . 
  also , stop sucking on dbg 's dick in public , it 's gross . 
  i personally do n't feel like playing a game where cheating scum is removed once a month and then forgotten about and given new accounts . 
  [ told you so ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/millerplanetside/comments/4e5tp1/pasha22russian_still_not_banned/d1xa6bq?context=3 ) . 
  yet another bug that was introduced in a shitty , badly tested patch several months ago and never fixed . 
  this and cheaters is why i do n't play anymore . 
  also , can you still wait out a full redeploy timer during loading screen while using an ssd ? 
  that must be some tasty shit you 're eating if you 're suggesting us to do the same . 
   edit : apparently team did n't know about this bug until yesterday . 
  [ apparently that is a lie ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/4ejxr0/hitbox_hack_was_available_for_more_than_9_months/ ) . 
  or streaming cheats is not a sufficiently `` significant way '' to highlight the fact . 
  one thing i want to know is why [ that fucker ] ( http://ps2.fisu.pw/player/?name=telltruth ) still plays the game after * months * of constant reports for grenade exploits . 
   perfect game right here, 
  were you high for the last three years ? 
  because the game is pretty old and pretty close to dead . 
  wait ... is that a thing ? 
  what a great idea to to that on a writing desk and handle mercury using a metal spoon . 
  * yay , new account to boost with cheats !, 
  wanted to say this . 
  i mean seriously why does he keep doing this ? 
  he only makes himself look bad over and over . 
  he 's starting to looks as if he has a mental condition of some kind . 
  same thing my ass, 
  what happens the next day when you stay late at work and do n't log in ? 
  what happens the day after that , when you do n't feel like playing but you feel forced to ? 
  what happens after a year of periodically forcing yourself to do bullshit ? 
  you say ` fuck it ' and uninstall . 
  so limit it to new pilots , idgaf . 
  there 's too much info in those apologies for them to be generic . 
  idk , population of the game sounds pretty valuable to me, 
  using tab to move between text fields stopped working on linux for some reason . 
  it doest react al all . 
  creating new profile did n't help . 
  all those flavors ... and you know the rest . 
  unnecessary , comma . 
  did i just watch a new eve trailer ? 
  hilmar is his real name . 
  it 's not like different hacks work on different servers ... 
  i 'm not a driver but i 'm genuinely curious : do you people mean that people should n't overtake * at all * in the time span between late october - early april each year ? 
  because that 's not a snow storm but rather usual road conditions for that time of year here in russia . 
  some `` mlg '' people suggest stopping fire and wasting opponent 's medkits . 
  other `` mlg '' people suggest `` just getting '' headshots on a spastic target .
