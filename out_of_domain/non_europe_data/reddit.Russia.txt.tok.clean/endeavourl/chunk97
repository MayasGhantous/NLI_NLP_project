  which one is it ? 
  that means you have to accept death and your mistake . 
  too much for an mlg ha player . 
  slapping some boxes over the image would be more opsec and take less time , fyi . 
  accept invulnerability frames as fun mechanic ? 
  i 'd rather uninstall . 
  get back to us when you have a video of yourself doing hc merciless lab with 3k life . 
  have fun playing in your little mlg game with other 1.5 people in it . 
  reaver is faster on ab and speed does nothing to your hoverfighting ability . 
  prowler needs to fully stop and then become stationary before being able to to its dps . 
  10k certs i will always regret spending . 
  edit : keep downvoting simple facts . 
  well , i want a tank , not a drool-tillery in which you spend more time looking for the `` right spot '' than actually shooting things . 
  and if you 're forced to take a direct fight before finding the right spot - you 've already lost vs. anyone competent , because you need to fully stop the fastest tank before you 're able to apply its full dps . 
  classic pavlov 's dog : push button , receive reward . 
  i think ikanam is on the xander 's list after indar revamp which is 6 months in the making already ( [ if you do n't count warpgate changes before that ] ( https://twitter.com/xanderclauss/status/661648903247278080 ) ) . 
  sucks when there 's a single guy in charge of mapmaking when your game has 4 * continents * for maps , does n't it ? 
   ( 1:40:49 pm ) tinal : i would 've bought a few mercury thermometres, 
   ( 1:40:56 pm ) tinal : and broken them on the tiles, 
  what kind of environmental laws they have in iceland ? 
  any severe punishments ? 
  asking for a friend ... 
  what the fucking fuck is this shitler `` coalition '' . 
  am i the only one thinking it looks like `` bonus-room lite '' except on a coalition scale ? 
  if you want to remove bandolier may as well remove frag grenades , they are pretty useless without it . 
  speaking about that , [ i have a question ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/4e7c74/legion_of_xxdeathxx_declaration_of_war_against/d1xpvky?context=3 ) ( late edit part ) . 
   since the leadership update , i 've had very poor loading times with an ssd . 
  oh , so they still did n't fix it . 
  probably did n't even bother . 
  / u/ps2stophack, 
  itt : people advocating for a wall hack . 
  let me repeat this , let it sink in :, 
  # people . 
  advocating . 
  for . 
  wall . 
  hack . 
   shot in the back by the infil, 
  do you only read parts that suit your opinion ? 
  http://ps2oraclestats.com/?stat=headshot_pct&amp;weapon1=80&amp;weapon2=79&amp;weapon3=78 take a look in a month, 
   very dead horse . 
  does the game have proper anticheat already ? 
  meanwhile in another thread people claim that cheating does n't exist and discussing it is `` beating a dead horse '' after the hitbox patch . 
   tvojamamasha, 
  meaning `` your mother [ rude ] '' in russian . 
  probably wo n't be banned for a long time too . 
  exactly , why fix bugs if your players enjoy eating shit and everybody else left long ago . 
   sometimes you can jump through the floor near the warpgate terminal . 
  only in planetside 2 : use wall climbing exploit to work around a collision/load time bug . 
  tell me what it is if not exploit . 
  so an exploit . 
   in video games , an exploit is the use of a bug or glitches , game system , rates , hit boxes , or speed , etc. 
  by a player to their advantage in a manner not intended by the game 's designers . 
  because wrel was just another player 9 months ago ? 
  are you seriously implying jerking space key while facing a wall and running potato graphics to achieve required fps is an intended game mechanic ? 
  one that reduces value of another class as well ? 
  hint : positive answer here is equal to admitting to be retarded . 
  the devs do n't fix shit in this game , they might as well not exist . 
  the negative impact is that roofs and obstacles that would otherwise usable/passable only by la can be used by anyone with $ 1k pc . 
  there are a lot of really damaged people in these comments . 
  i am disgusted of sharing a community with them . 
  i 'm mad about this game and its shit developers . 
  this is kinda how this sub-thread started . 
  i 'm sure if those skills lose all purpose they 're gon na be removed and reimbursed . 
  are those damage bonuses additive or multiplicative between races ? 
   we are readopting responsible disclosure as our official method for dealing with exploits and bugs . 
  this is how professionals do it irl and we 're gon na do the same . 
  because that worked so well in the past . 
  see : community issue tracker , now abandoned , first by devs then players . 
   if dbg neglects the issue and it is becoming a problem the mods will vote to publicly disclose the information . 
  i somehow doubt that 's going to work . 
  vanguard heat ohks an esf . 
  no it does .

  i ca n't make a vr video since my videocard broke and i also did n't update the client for a while , so you 'll have to check that yourself . 
   lost it all to forgetting to pay the sov bill, 
  the fuck does this have to do with public transport ? 
  radarx embarrassed ? 
  that fucker is too smug for that . 
  tfw ps2 premium in 2016, 
  i honestly regret giving them a token fee of 3 months couple of years ago . 
  the terrain 100 % requires full re download . 
  not sure about bases . 
  who kills the a2g guys ? 
  sometime ago somebody mentioned opening a support ticket instead of reporting . 
  maybe it works better idk . 
  op knows exactly what he 's doing .

  [ descending back from sch\u00e4fler ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oywaj3q.jpg ) last summer . 
  the way up took probably close to all of my physical abilities of a man of flat plains  but was extremely rewarding and the view from the top was [ breathtaking ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hgfz8ho.jpg ) . 
  and of course there are less challenging stuff in the hills and mountains surrounding s\u00e4ntis . 
  the day before ebenalp we hiked from kronberg to schw\u00e4galp . 
  that hike was more relaxed , with flatter terrain , some forests and meadows along the way . 
  there can be no much more `` core '' issue to a competitive fps game than unmanaged cheaters . 
  well , except if the game is totally unplayable like with crashes/hitches . 
  you know , that message would 've actually been funny if you were n't ** killed by the game every goddamn time ** . 
  look guys , someone thinks dbg balances vehicle play !, 
  how cute !,
