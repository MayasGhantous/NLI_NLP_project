  this man is dead . '', 
  - made me chuckle . 
  i generally hate this type of smart-ass characters but for some reason it works for jacob . 
  also , those evie close-ups !, 
  the level of detail and face animations are awesome . 
  fighting animations are shit though . 
  ac atlantis for 2016 confirmed !, 
  ... but the more you think about it , the more it makes sense - a mythical highly developed country buried deep in the ocean - sooner or later it has to be explored . 
  as much as i loved the caribbeean i have to say venice . 
  i guess it was the lighting that captured the real venice so well , even the air feels wet , just like it does irl . 
  god , it is still a pleasure to return to ac2 every now and then . 
  4 different locations seemed to worked the best . 
  we can have a couple of big cities and two smaller towns/groups of villages with little bit ofwildlife just for diversion . 
  i 've been thinking about a game set during thirty years war lately , we could 've had prague and vienna as two major locations ( like florence and venice ) with wurzburg ( witchhunts ) and madgeburg ( sack of magdeburg ) as minor locations ( like san gimingiano and forli ), 
  * [ your uncle ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjcpc6oq384 ), 
  ftfy, 
  ac1 - repetitive missions in the middle of the game, 
  ac2 - those battle of forli and bonfire of vanities missions killed all the pace for me . 
  also , glyphs with those near impossible puzzles . 
  acb - it felt more like a dlc than a separate game . 
  other than that it was just perfect . 
  acre - animus stuff, 
  ac : bf - this is hard one . 
  it feels almost perfect . 
  diving maybe , cause camera controls are a bit off . 
  oh , and the lack of hq upgrades . 
  ac : u - i hate that i have n't even tried it yet . 
  yo dawg , we know you like desmond so we named yo dog desmond , so you can save yo desmond dog after you killed yo desmond , dawg . 
  i 'd go with acii . 
  not necessarily focus on ezio , but whole mediterranean during renaissance . 
  as different members of a brotherhood you could travel all across europe , northern africa and middle east . 
  following a single period of time from different sides and perspectives would be a unique experience . 
  that would be a hell of a twist for ac game . 
  game would be set in california , with la and sf as main locations and based around society manupulation by media ( hollywood ) and internets ( silicon valley ) . 
  steve jobs would be more likely . 
  just mininuke the place to the ground and loot what 's left . 
  it sucks that you ca n't buy vault 81 suit . 
  had to use console to get one for [ curie , so we could wander through wastelands together like 200 years old relics ] ( / spoiler ), 
  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063794/ there you go . 
  skyfall is the biggest one of craig 's bond movies , definetely more popular then casino royale and spectre . 
  it is n't a reboot but it follows the same route as most reboots - take same characters and key elements and add some modern gimmicks . 
  same with frozen , even if snow queen is n't a franchise it is an already existing property that studio wanted to capitalize on and with 1 billion box office it is one of the best examples . 
  well , in my opinion . 
  speaking of gravity , i am well aware about apollo 13 and mission to mars , but it fascinates me not in its financial or critical success , but technological breakthrough , just like avatar . 
  it might not be the greatest movie ( personally i liked martian more ) but it was the first in the bunch . 
  alright , i understand that writing my own list was a mistake , because people on internet ca n't handle different opinions but what would be your answer to the question in title ? 
   you 're obviously quite enthusiastic , and i do n't want to stomp on you for trying to get an interesting-enough discussion going , but you 're making huge claims that are both scattered and simply wrong . 
  it irks me because / r/movies does this a lot : make definitive claims about recent films that show a real ignorance of film history . 
  no problem man . 
  sorry , if you thought i make some definitive claims about movies , because i did not intended to do that and it never was the point of the thread . 
  yes , i am not a hardcore movie fan , thats why i wanted to know your opinions on topic , but i guess and you thought i claim those movies on par with citizen kane or casablanca . 
  no , they are not . 
  and yes , thanks for pointing out the bit about drive , i genuinely thought it was quite popular for an independent movie . 
  but i thought it was interesting how after avengers everyone wanted to establish its own movie universe , so i tried to find any other examples , looked for popular movies , ones , that not only were critically and financially successful , but ones that made a certain impact . 
  decade thing seemed logical , especially how that we are in the middle , so i came up with that . 
  granted , some of them ... most of them are far fetched but my list was never the point of discussion . 
  anyways , thank you guys for opening my eyes on so many things . 
  it would be cool if institute could create a synth copy of your spouse , so you could have her/him as your follower . 
  institute already has a history of switching humans with their almost identical synth copies ( with memories and stuff !, 
  ) , and you have an intact body in cryo-pod in perfect condition ( minus gunshot wound ) . 
  also , you have all those voiced lines for your spouse - this begs for dlc or at least a mod . 
  also , you can finally go to that park and have another baby . 
  ** boston harbor dlc **, 
  * expand map to the east, 
  * add a number of islands with dozen new settlements, 
  * underwater exploration with shipwrecks and sea monsters, 
  * new mods for power armor , weapons and stuff suitable for new locations, 
  * cruise ship like [ this ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/04/ab/5f/04ab5fce65fcb409183a7ae900b54ed4.jpg ) . 
  [ there 's ] ( http://proektvlahte.ru/ru/press/gallery/place/?id=26 ) [ actually ] ( http://proektvlahte.ru/ru/press/gallery/place/?id=28 ) [ a research ] ( http://proektvlahte.ru/ru/press/gallery/place/?id=38 ) on that subject . 
  so , it is the ubisoft `` parity '' all over again . 
  you forgot about crabs with tophats and monocles, 
  just imagine curie in liberty prime ... or should i say le liberte du prime ( i really do suck at french ), 
  edit : [ he sounds interesting in french ] ( https://youtu.be/jtkfultnzl8?t=36m45s ) ( spoilers ), 
  i like the idea , but i 'd rather have it done a bit different . 
  just like in tes you can turn yourself into vampire or werewolf via a certain actions , game should allow you turn yourself into a ghoul , supermutant or a synth . 
  once you become one , most non-agressive npcs will turn hostile ( except if you have high enough charisma , like 8-9 , or mabe a certain perk ) , but this will make your new faction non-hostile . 
  then , have a specific questline for each `` lifeform '' , the same way there were separate questlines for different vampire clans in morrowind . 
  for synths you align yourself with raildoad or maybe create another faction . 
  for ghouls you can have your tensions with children of atom or work with triggermen or hancock . 
  for supermutants you can build your own `` orsinium '' , or find some milk of human kindness , idk . 
  i 'm pretty sure [ arkhangelsk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arkhangelsk ) would be nuked to the ground because of military shipyard and navy base just a couple dozens km from city . 
  fun fact - it was one of the major targets for nuclear attack during the cold war . 
  anyway , even if someone would somehow survive nuclear winter , they would have to deal with lots of mirelurks and yao-guai . 
  [ merchant court ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arkhangelsk_gostiny_dvor ) could be turned into some kind of castle , and even the only [ skyscraper ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/arkhangelsk_tower_at_summer_2013.jpg ) can still be standing 200 years after the war . 
  maybe even a few nuclear submarines and icebreakers can be turned into something like rivet city , cruising around arctic ocean searching for new home . 
  i believe the term is `` yahoo '' ? 
  white background - new tyres , black background - used tyres, 
  if dc really wants to capitalize on their `` darker '' tone , it would be make sense to introduce more anti-heroes , not necessarily villains , but characters with questionable motivations and morale . 
  i 'm not really that familiar with dc universe , but characters like lobo , booster gold and deathstroke might be an interesting foundation for a dark and twisted world . 
  harley quinn standalone movie can work too ( with poison ivy and catwoman ? 
  i struggle to find more famous dc female villain characters ) . 
  now that you mentioned it , i 'd pay to see a supervillain movie , like darkseid , without tons own heroes fighting him , but focusing on his own story and character . 
  i just recently found out that diamond city got its name from [ baseball diamond ] ( https://www.google.ru/search?q=baseball+diamond ) . 
  it always confused me why `` great green jewel of the commonwealth '' was not an emerald but a diamond . 
  so , deathclaw preservation society really exists , huh ... 
  last year mission impossible : rogue nation first moved its release date half a year forward , then released its first trailer 4 months before the movie came out , and a month later went to reshoots and still got a huge box office and raving reviews . 
  i think people are a bit spoiled with recent megablockbusters ( marvel , dc , star wars ) . 
  trailers usually used to release at best half a year before movie premiere , more often - 4 months . 
  and it makes sense - if you release your trailer too early then by the time the full marketing campaing starts people wo n't care about stuff happened couple months earlier . 
  [ so win , much russian ] ( http://vs.hu/i/000-dv2152571-jpg.jpg ),
