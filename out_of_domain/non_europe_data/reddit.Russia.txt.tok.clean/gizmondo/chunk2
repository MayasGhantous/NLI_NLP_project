  it 's a well known fact . 
  where are the sanctions ? 
  except everyone knows they are n't . 
   so censuring out the propaganda is more justified for one side that it is for the other . 
  no it 's not . 
  really ? 
  returned from the moscow concert few hours ago ... 
  they are so much better on tape . 
   this is negative press for the armed forces but folks can talk about it publicly . 
  for now . 
   and calls russian government and putin by their real names : terrorists . 
  what definition of terrorist are you using ? 
  `` a person who i do n't like '' ? 
   events like this and progress m-27m failure underline the importance and difficulty in maintaining an excellent launch record . 
  people who build this rocket earn less than teenagers in macdonalds . 
  it 's not difficult to avert that mistake . 
   a large group of people * does n't want to join us because they feel that they will be excluded . 
  are you sure that this is the case ? 
   all ukraine needs to do is ensure its people lives better than russians . 
  easier said than done . 
   russians ( not just military ) are conditioned into mild form of split personality disorder . 
  it starts at the kindergarten and allows you to function while believing the government propaganda . 
  sure . 
  i think i get one at birth . 
  because he blindly labeled valid technical arguments as black pr ? 
   they are rebuilding the economy, 
  and what exactly have they done already ? 
  unfortunately for you , crimea can produce more gas than it consumes . 
  i 'm `` there '' and i like him . 
  i 'm a bit angry because it 's hard to buy european cheese . 
  who should i blame for this again ? 
  oh yeah , that evil foreign enemy !, 
  sorry , not buying it . 
   read comments anywhere online and you 'll see russians trash talking ukrainian people . 
  read comments anywhere online and you 'll see ukrainians trash talking russian people . 
  but of course now you will say that it 's totally understandable and excusable . 
  oh , i see , no double standards here . 
  ok , i 've checked lviv forum 5 minutes ago . 
  there is almost no russians there , yet people are talking about how stupid and drunk russians are . 
  how is this explained in your world of unicorns , innocent ukrainians and evil russians ? 
  i 'm just curious . 
  but you 've said they just talk back !, 
  obviously both . 
  that 's usual thing here , you know . 
  i 'll give you an example . 
  let 's say i 'm black . 
  i go into my neighbors house . 
  kill his dog . 
  steal his shit . 
  piss on his carpet . 
  then i go outside and start screaming to everyone that drives by `` hey , this guy has a small dick . '', 
  and then that guy says `` wow , i hate all this uneducated pesky negros . 
  i want them dead . '', 
  btw , your arguments are so childish , that 's even funny . 
  but i 'm a bit tired to keep up . 
   4 of 10 in top coder 10 are russian . 
  competitive programming is very different from the industry one though . 
   tell me an open source project that was born in russia that is known and used all around the world ? 
  i like how osce is called shit and useless here when they report something bad about ukrainian side . 
   compiler insists on us providing a lifetime parameter for the other input variable . 
  why ? 
  fn trade_with < ` b  ( & mut self , other : & ' b mut person < ` a  ) {, 
  let tmp = other.car ;, 
  other.car = self.car ;, 
  self.car = tmp ;, 
  this code is really confusing imo . 
  because of the lifetime parameter ' b which is not used anywhere . 
  overall your article gives good explanation , thanks , 
   if russians use '' \u043d\u0430 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0435 '' they are trying to say that it 's near border and '' \u0432 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0435 '' in country ukraine . 
  that 's plain wrong . 
  it 's like saying that the word '' \u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434 '' ( garden ) means a place which is surrounded by something . 
  nobody uses '' \u043d\u0430 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0435 '' as a place near the border , stop that nonsense . 
   also , the `` seps '' were capturing government buildings , it 's law enforcement 's job to prevent and deal with this kind of threats . 
  but it was of course ok for protesters in kiev to do just that . 
   bizarre clause, 
  what 's so bizarre about it ? 
  shows you level of the article . 
  yes , i would say that such loan covenants are pretty common . 
  it 's usually ebitda/debt ratio for commercial companies , gdp/debt ratio is natural for countries . 
   at current burn levels that will happen sometime late 2017 . 
  then it gets interesting . 
  and could you please inform us what the current burn level is ? 
  ok , i can help you - russian central bank has n't been selling reserves since early february . 
  in fact it bought around $ 10b from the market during this period . 
  it 's called victim blaming . 
  you would n't post that if it happened in dnr , would you ? 
  sorry , are they bright ? 
  am i missing something ? 
   the ukrainian hryvnia is looking like a pretty good investment, 
  this is a joke , right ? 
  this is good news for russian aircraft industry as well . 
  ssj is better than an-148 / 158 anyway . 
  the latter is now abandoned , which is good . 
  1 ) i did n't say that ssj is enormously brilliant , i said it 's better than an . 
  and it really is . 
  future will tell if this project is a success ( probably not ) . 
  but an is just doomed from the start . 
  2 ) ssj does n't compete with boeing and airbus , it competes with embraer , bombardier and so on . 
  cooperation reduces profits ? 
  4 ) they made 100 , not 60 , stop lying please .
