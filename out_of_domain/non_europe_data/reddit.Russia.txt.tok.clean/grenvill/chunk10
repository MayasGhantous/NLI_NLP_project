  why i should ask my parents about it ? 
  i dont understand . 
  i remember it quite well . 
  also , what exactly makes you think i believe the propaganda ? 
  and which propaganda exactly ? 
  full package with hotels included will be much cheaper for egypt , i worked in russian tourism agency . 
  kinda funny combination of username and flair . 
  boris rotenberg is currently playing for dinamo moscow and before was in zenit . 
  he ` s uncle is arcady rotenberg , friend of putin and oligarch . 
   not to mention last time russia wanted finland it suffered a stinging defeat . 
  what do you mean ? 
  you get it when hosting non-dedicated server . 
  i was born in ussr and i do not understand what a you talking about . 
  people dissapear ? 
  and especially your comment about dealing with people in uniform is very , very strange.absolutely anybody who were born in ussr will tell you what public opinion on militia and army was much better then now . 
  far cry 3, 
  novorossiysk is not all-season port, 
  its not about freezing , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bora_ ( wind ), 
  its closed every year , from several days to several weeks . 
  this is the thing - whats the point of military installation what cant be used every year for random amount of time . 
   pearl harbor and guam are regularly closed because of typhoons, 
  pearl harbor and guam are not in missile striking range from countries , belonging to hostile military alliance . 
  moreover , in the event of emergency us navy can freely move from one base to another . 
  for black sea fleet closest backup will be at baltiysk , through turkey-controlled bosphorus . 
   it 's admittedly better than novorossiysk , but it closes every once in a while too . 
  do you have any examples ? 
  i couldnt find any . 
  i would say , '' \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c '' here is something you could translate as `` sociality '' ( this word probably dont even exist ) - meaning what power of state is exist as the sum of the will of largest socium circles , which at the time , as you correctly noticed , where poorest and most conservative . 
  this is really depends on your tastes . 
  if you looking for good tv series , 17 \u043c\u0433\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b and \u0428\u0435\u0440\u043b\u043e\u043a \u0425\u043e\u043b\u043c\u0441 are very good choices . 
  oh , of course . 
  if you dig deep , uvarov ` s formula undoubtly contradict itself . 
  one thing i should notice here , russian tsar power were absolute only to a point - look at that happened to pavel i and false dmitry , for example . 
  or how slow and careful was path to 1861 peasant reform . 
  i would say what past petr i ( who were probably most untraditionalist tsar ever and died natural death ) russian rulers were quite aware of unwritten limits of their power . 
  you dont think what without puck-body collision it will turn into `` who have best long shot '' contest ? 
  try from the north side, 
  can you give a link please ? 
  i have same issue . 
  do you have any source for this ? 
  `` foreign international travel companies cant come to crimea due to fear of heavy fines . 
  referendum : by opinion of practically all interviewed experts and citizen - overhelming majority of sevastopol inhabitants voter for joining russia ( turnout 50-80 % ) , in crimea according to various sources for joining russia voted 50-60 % with turnout 30-50 % ; - citizens of crimea voted voted not so much for joining russia , as for the termination , in their words , `` corrupted and lawlessness dominance by donetsk henchmen '', 
  yes , you are correct about report being the result of the survey . 
  another thing what is interesting here is it unclear from wording of the report if 30-50 % turnout in crimea includes sevastopol . 
  in 1939 87,4 % of adult ussr population was literate . 
  in both this and dyalorex debacle what i dont understand is why do you care if all community members are happy with your actions.you are doing your job , if someone doesnt like this , its their problem , not yours . 
  biggest russian torrent trackers is http://rutracker.org/ and http://new-rutor.org/ . 
  why do you think so ? 
  do you know they existed before kerimov ? 
  russia won portugal in qualification , i dont see why usa cant . 
  i would not complain if this game ended same way , 
  what a disgusting finnish thugs . 
  oh well , at least we won in the end . 
  we had better team and we won , no need to be mad , 
  powerplays time was more or less even , i dont know what are you talking about . 
  im proud personally , yes . 
  it feels good not only because we won , but we also denied first place to team consisting of unsportsmanlike thughs . 
  it is, 
  both , of course . 
  as a russian supporter , it was most entertaining match thread i ever saw . 
  it had all : bribes accusations , racism of different undertones , history references to ww2 and cold war times , and , most importanly , delicious losers tears . 
  backlund and salom\u00e4ki, 
  this is because of 2 +10 penalty in the end of game , then it hasnt mattered at all, 
  for both sides, 
  shame it ended that way , americans ruined this final game . 
  thanks , i will look into it . 
  what port supraball is using ? 
  \u043a\u0443\u043b\u0430\u043a\u0438 are not `` ukrainian speaking farmers '', 
  this is not impossible , i played a bit with ukranian tactical gaming guys - they copied modset of shacktac.they typically had 80 + players games at the time . 
  i dont see why you cant do same in europe . 
  just a little remark , bofors is sweden gun , not german . 
  also bofors is 40mm and , if we speaking about winter 1942 , was mostly ineffective in at role . 
  probably it was http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/85_mm_air_defense_gun_m1939_ ( 52-k ), 
  ah , sorry i misunderstood your remark about copied guns . 
  on the other hand , what you saying about effectiveness of 52-k in at role is quite strange . 
  its ap shell were overpenetrating all tanks of first half of the war ( just as german 8-8 for example ) . 
  he is 33 now , lost most of his speed , which was big part of his quality :(, 
  yep , its youtube captions . 
  why do you call them bastards ? 
  im curious myself . 
  i imagine losing dominions4 was a hit for them . 
   i did n't get that `` cuminist '' religion either, 
   mini-refrigirators, 
  this is probably weakest russian national team ever , not much he could do about that . 
  he had really rough season at zenit . 
  hasnt been scoring much , and after winter rondon transfer he got benched . 
  arshavin got old , shirokov is injured and dzagoev started on the bench ( capello dont really believes in him for some reason ) . 
  not much creative spark without these 3 . 
  i hope dzagoev and kerzhakov will be starting in next match at least . 
  different state , different talent pool . 
  minor correction - kirovograd , not kivorograd . 
  as the other guy said , you have no idea what you are talking about in context of russian-georgian war . 
  at least read wikipedia article, 
  i will not say twat , but i dont understand his logic with holding substitutions for so long . 
  what position he is playin in ? 
  problem with difficulty setting in eador is that they mainly affect neutral units hp . 
  which leads new player to using range units and scout and subsequently make harder to play later on expert difficulty , which is game meant to be played . 
  in terms of priorities on first turns : clearing random locations  clearing 1st ring  clearing 2nd ring  exploring . 
  this is of course for beginning when you have 1 hero , as soon as you get 2nd he can start exploring non-stop , while main one is clearing detected locations . 
  importan part is to get to know which locations and provinces are easy and which are hard .
