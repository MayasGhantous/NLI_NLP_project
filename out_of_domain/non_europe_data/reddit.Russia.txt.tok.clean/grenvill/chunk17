  when you talking about dots , you mean [ this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/bivxlyx.jpg ) thing , right ? 
  and another question , what is the purpose of food ? 
  i cant use it when im fighting and my health replenishes instantly when im not fighting . 
  thank you !, 
  it makes sense , thank you, 
  it so interesting to read about gym culture in other countries . 
  in my gym unspoken rule is when you walk out of locker room , first thing you do is you make a circle around gym and give handshake to every male here . 
  nope , handshake with woman is not really a common thing here . 
  i dont think i ever saw it . 
  1 ) russia 2 ) nothing really, 
  can you give a context ? 
   energy ca n't appear out of thin air , so you need these extra calories to build muscle, 
  which you get by burning fat, 
  by ussr laws , state would get 75 %, 
  its not crude , its used quite often in classic literature for example . 
  its called pistol squat , try searching for `` pistol squat progression '' videos on youtube . 
  i liked [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7oj8-8htyw ) one for example, 
   my question is , does '' \u0448\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0443 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b '' have some kind of figurative meaning , or is it literal ? 
  literal, 
   also , what 's a good english translation for '' \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b '', 
  say , you knitted hat or sweater , didnt liked it and decided to `` unknit '' . 
  whateved english word describes this process is a translation for '' \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b '', 
  im russian , living in european part of the country . 
  generally , ground will dry out here only in the second half of april or may . 
  until then , moving big armies by dirt roads is hell . 
  is it confirmed how `` choose one of two effects '' spells like wrath will work ? 
  thanks !, 
  kinda hard to not give in conspiracy theories when you get fucked by rng like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx1eumcypgm ) . 
  i mean , i do not believe in this sort of things myself , but its understandable what some people do . 
  human psychology is not designed to work with rng . 
  oh , sorry i didnt gave full context . 
  mef was saying what `` game is playing against you '' until you get two losses, 
  yeah , old one was much better :(, 
  if a guy who is being spotted is not a complete dumbass , you will have to provide just a few kgs of force on a failed rep. 12 year old girl can do it . 
  any german movies you would recommend ? 
  thanks !, 
   this time it was , `` you need to go away now . '', 
  or what ? 
  if i remember correctly , it has to do with school reform , when they moved from 11 years school education to 10 years . 
  i dont think there is movies similar to come and see , its very unique . 
  check out unreal world, 
  i remember lifecoash said he is counting 1 overload mana cost as ~ 0.6 normal mana . 
   it 's not about being arnold , it 's about being the best you can be at the hobbies you choose . 
  but this is insane , this is absolutely impossible . 
  i cant reach top100 in hearthstone ladder , cook as chief from michelin restaurant , read 5 books per week , spend 20 hours per week at gym while doing online courses at coursera and edx . 
  how you cant see that ? 
  what about having you own goals ? 
  why top 10 % and not top5 % or top2 % ? 
  im certainly able to reach that , its just question of time and efforth . 
  why 1000lb and not 1500 ? 
  etc etc. 
  main line of thought i see being propagated in this thread is what i do not have a moral right to have my own goals , i always should compare myself with my peers and should strive to be above them ( or at least should give 100 % efforth to do so ) . 
  by continuing this logic i should not do things , which i cant or lack passion to be best at . 
  so if im invited for boardgame party next weekend i have only two options : 1 ) spend whole week training and reading tips online to maxmise my chances to win 2 ) decline invitation . 
  and , of course , if im singing in the shower and im not taking private lessons to sing better , im literally untermensch . 
  sorry for errors , im not native speaker . 
  judging by what i read on reddit , americans do not take of shoes . 
  yeah , this is super strange for me either lol, 
   aside from the water , it was a fairly ugly and clunky game even at launch, 
  i do not agree with this at all - how many games was looking better in 2002 ? 
  all these games can be made look ugly by zooming on the face of npc . 
  you probably cant appreciate because you did not played right after release , when it was rpgs crysis .

  week ago guy asked to work in with me in power rack . 
  i told him sure , go ahead . 
  aaaand he ohp my paused squat weight :(, 
  and the worst thing - he wasnt even much bigger than me lol, 
   also how many calories do you burn while lifting, 
  sheyko gives 700-900 calories per training session for intermediate athletes . 
  im not an expert , but i think its because biomechanically , its make sense to have dead weight as close to your centre of gravity as possible . 
  imagine what you take 5 kg of fat from you abs and butt and put it on your arms and shoulders - this would be horrible , right ? 
  you would tire out very quickly doing any physical labour . 
   i look like a kid in hitler 's wet dream . 
  judging by what you described , i dont think you have [ hitlerj\u00fcgend haircut ] ( https://pp.vk.me/c419827/v419827932/7505/mytypkbd42i.jpg ) ... 
  for fat people it is, 
  can you give me an example ? 
  damn , what a shame . 
  i love learning new things about my country on reddit :(, 
   the closer lets in two runs to the heart of the order and is blamed for the loss while all the stranded runners in the early innings are forgotten, 
  i have no idea what any of this means lol, 
  which is why im answered to him ? 
  he was standing . 
  what he was supposed to do ? 
  in football you cant foul someone just by standing in place . 
  its not a defender job to move out the way of forward . 
   he planted himself after he was nutmegged . 
  which he is perfectly fine to do . 
  you have a right to stand still on a football field . 
  if you have dropbox installed , using print screen button will automatically save it to screenshot folder . 
  a bit of stretch , but have you tried ja2 ? 
  battle brothers - mount & blade with turn-based battles . 
  age of fear/age of fear 2 - very indie looking , but interesting combat system . 
  eador - by far best combat in all tbs i have played . 
  second game after brood war , where i specifically took time to watch experienced players tactics . 
  first one , genesis , is better than masters of broken world . 
  you start with small group of mercenaries and begin capturing cities , military installations , raising militia etc. 
  you totally should play it , its a classic , which aged quite well . 
  jagged alliance back in action was okeish , but not quite the same .
