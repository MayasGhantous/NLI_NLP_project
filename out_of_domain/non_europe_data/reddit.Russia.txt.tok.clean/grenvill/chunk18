  wait , what it has to do with ww2 ? 
  what are you trying to say ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx1eumcypgm check this for btg rng, 
  if its true , its has to be some sort of record, 
  i had to help a friend with his shirt after a good back + biceps workout . 
  he was literally unable to take it off by himself . 
  yeah , i was thinking about array , but what type of array we supposed to use then ? 
   but every match he plays they where monkey chants directed at him , even by his own fans . 
  nope, 
  hmm , you got `` lucky '' i guess . 
  i havent heard it personally for at least 3 years . 
  zarya is not a name, 
  hey , i had same problem , my gym some time ago changed their cable machine to a new model with non-adjustable height . 
  just as you described , it goes only to very top or bottom . 
  i discovered what doing it from top position , if i lean back a bit i get same feeling in rear delts as in normal face pulls . 
  how much difference is normal between your squats and paused squats ? 
  i have this feeling what i rely a little bit too much on bounce at the bottom . 
  rutracker is biggest one by far, 
  im really jealous if guys can work out without shirts in your gym , its 32c here :(, 
  thanks !, 
  check russian wiki on this https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9c%d1%83%d1%80%d0%bc%d0%b0%d0%bd%d1%81%d0%ba, 
   does it simply mean ` romanov on the murman coast ', 
  yes , pretty much this, 
  hm , im pretty sure im doing something wrong at very basic level . 
  im completely missed , what in first minute of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tgta4o_am8 ) video david explains what he working inside of localhost directory . 
  but how do i find it in cs50 ide ? 
   apache50 start ~ / workspace/pset7/public, 
  you mean pset6 , right ? 
  im doing week 7 and its has pset6 in it . 
   but seriously what 's with all the pedantic cunts on / fitit that will never lift anything close to this commenting on form . 
  where did you found it ? 
  do these kind of mods work in mp ? 
  thank you !, 
  i started with planks myself . 
  you can do it from knees or on incline in the beginning, 
  shaking in the beginning is absolutely normal . 
  i could barely last 20-30s at first !, 
  thanks , i will try it, 
  okay , so just to verify im doing it right : im creating and editing . php or . html files in text editor , moving it to . . / xamp/htdocs directory and check if it works by going to http://localhost/***.html in browser , correct ? 
  conquest of elysium 4 is on the same engine and probable more suitable for single-player, 
  its 66 on lightforge , above average . 
  same as shatterd sun cleric for example . 
   or maybe the value balances out with the downside of having larger deck with 5 random cards ? 
  yeah , pretty much . 
  it would be much better if its effect was a battlecry, 
  broke my fingers on both hands , any tips for modyfied gym routine ? 
  so if i understand you correctly this should work ? 
  function destroyer ( arr ) {, 
  var farr = arguments [ 0 ] ;, 
  for ( var i = 1 ; i < arguments.length ; i + + ), 
  farr = farr.filter ( function ( number ), 
  return number ! = arguments [ i ] ;, 
  destroyer ( [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 1 , 2 , 3 ] , 2 , 3 ) ;, 
  i think im starting understand now , two questions :, 
  1 ) you are using parseint to make sure what we only filter out arguments which are numbers , correct ? 
  because its supposed to work with strings too ;, 
  2 ) return ( carr.indexof ( val ) ! = -1 ) means what we will filter out elements what are not in arguments array , right ? 
  have you tried eador : genesis ? 
  anybody tried oriental empires ? 
  source ? 
  serve me right lol, 
  are you streaming ? 
  i think reddit is the only place where im reading about `` upcoming war '' , its not a thing in russian media . 
  `` sunday evening '' is on russia 1 , not channel 1 . 
  i dont watch it though . 
  source ? 
  this picture absolutely hillarious, 
  what does `` silver screen '' mean ? 
   what more can a human ask for ? 
  to not be in pain , for example, 
  do not have a money for gym membership atm . 
  its probably first time ever i saw moscow recommended as a cheap city :d, 
  yeah , it makes sense . 
  i ` ve had same problem with planks for the first 4-5 months . 
  its slowly went away after that . 
  i have lost a phalanx on my finder doing weighted back extensions . 
  probably the only such case in the history of fitness :p, 
  we should create a `` dumb injuries club '' lol, 
  name of the drink is `` elite balsam belebey '' . 
  short wiki article about balsams : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balsam_ ( drink ),

  commenting to enter, 
  i was double pyroblasted from 18 hp other day .

  interesting what you went 18-18 against druids . 
  i dont play pirate warrior too much and always thought it supposed to destroy druids . 
  im russian and gym etiquette is same here . 
  is it different in us ? 
  good question - i dont know , to be honest . 
  i live in the small city , and gyms here will have 30-40 people on busiest day . 
  you had shops though, 
  this is really weird , i finished ds1 several times and never had this problem . 
  `` plate '' in this context means standard 20kg plate, 
  why didnt you * tried * reading ? 
   the soviet union and many other copycat small states banned religion,
