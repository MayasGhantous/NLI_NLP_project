  no problem , 
  i really hope to see him more next season . 
  well , i know one example of so called `` caseless bullets '' http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heckler_%26_koch_g11/, 
  cska now need to lose points in 2 games from 4 remaining . 
  match summary http://video.yandex.ru/users/nfz-tv/view/60/# . 
  looks like malafeev could save first one . 
  its not a fuselage , its a wing . 
  they did excellent rts series too ( kohan and kohan2 ) . 
   as one of the three factions has a lot more players on most servers and thus ends up dominating in many fights, 
  is it one particular faction ? 
  or its different on different servers ? 
  http://en.fc-zenit.ru/main/video/gl3433/ excellent performance by hulk - red card + penalty + hat-trick . 
  that being said , its a second very dubious penalty on him in a row , i hope its does n't bite him in the ass later . 
  yes you are . 
  while soldiers are spoke some russian words , their are definitely not ethnic russians . 
  really heavy accent . 
  best game of this year and yet we lost . 
  cska just played 120 minutes in cup match , derby with lokomotiv should be very hard for them . 
  regarding cas , first closed hearing was at 9 may , judging by http://www.gazeta.ru/sport/news/2013/05/09/n_2901025.shtml decision should be not later than 14 may . 
  don t forget what with equal points we still will be 2nd . 
  cska need to lost points in two games . 
  sopcast channel 144379 working for me, 
  there is no such thing as ak-47 . 
  its a very common misconception . 
  proper name is `` ak '' . 
  yep , in standart ussr army nomenclature it goes as `` 7.62 mm avtomat kalashnikova '' . 
  moreover , in absolute majority of games you probable see later ak modifications aks , akm , akms and so on . 
  so , every policeman is a hero ? 
  strange shes known in usa , she was thoroughly examined and debunked in ussr http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u041a\u0443\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0430,_\u041d\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043b\u044c_\u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430, 
  we gave this championship ourselves though :(, 
  http://coub.com/view/bxgiwbe?from_embed=embed amazing team goal, 
  same in russia, 
  somewhat unrelated , but - how do you look at item description with default m+kb layout ? 
  haha , i tried all my keyboard buttons and still could find it , thanks , 
   russians did it to the cossaks, 
  because ? 
  shame he didnt played much as dm in bayern . 
  hmm , i always thought that 109f is best non-jet climber in the game . 
  bargaining chips ? 
  who would they bargain with ? 
  just had exactly this situation in hb and 109f slowly but steadily got me starting from 700m distance ( i have all upgrades etc ) . 
  last couple of days i played with my friends at low-level hb . 
  i must say , matchmaking does n't work there at all . 
  here is our experience : try hurricanes - get killed by 109s 5 times in a row , f2a3 - same , lagg-3 - same.switch to ki-43 and a5m4 - half of enemy team now consist of yak9t . 
  within 3 days i personally made maybe 3 kills in about 20 matches . 
  i mean , i understand about small community etc but i would gladly change bigger waiting time for working matchmaking, 
  i always will remember [ this ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xopfzt_zenit-petersburg-2-1-benfica-fantastic-goal-71-semak_sport#.ua_6lb1va6c ) goal . 
  one of the finest i have ever seen . 
   by the time of the d-day landings , the germans had been fought to a standstill at the battle of kursk in late 1943, 
  summer 1943 , if we want to be precise  . 
   it was n't untill the operation bagration offensive - beginning some 3 weeks after d-day and concluding in august - that the soviets had achieved any `` incredible advances '' . 
  at the time of d-day , axis forces was continuously retreating for a year : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:eastern_front_1943-08_to_1944-12.png . 
  , losing whole south russia , ukraine and half of belorussia . 
  i say , war was definitely lost for them at this point . 
  what the fuck ref, 
  well , temp of retreat was more or less the same through 1943 to 1945 . 
  http://www.hockeyquestionmark.com/ excellent indie sports game, 
  now we have capello though, 
  what strikes me is that it is happening the second time and that it apparently passed open test on dev server . 
  makes me wonder if the whole game user base are malevolent . 
  its certainly doable , our server are hosting for last 2 years games with 130-140 players ( no ai though ) . 
  guys from tushino before split up had games with 180-190 players . 
  i think mig-3 cockpit is not fully finished . 
  yesterday russian community manager did frb stream , where he flied mig-3 as well . 
  he said what some of the stuff in cockpit is not working as it should . 
  i incredibly disappointed with denisov , but if swap with shatow is true its a very good deal . 
  http://www.youtube.com/channel/uc2ppftjbhovogdf1gvejhba his nickname is squier . 
  dont autorepair -  problem solved, 
  weeks ? 
  really ? 
  first good news in this season . 
  i havent payed attention to it lately , but i thought this whole climatgate thing killed it ? 
  yep . 
  always double-check it on replays . 
  i had occasions than shot to the il-2 wing havent done anything , while on the replay it was just a miss . 
  source ? 
   the devs have stated they `` do n't care '' about arcade, 
  source ? 
  i cant see its happening , there is zero information about it on russian sportsites . 
  a-0 is one of the best turnfighters in game, 
  they played in rpl up to 2008, 
  well casualty ratio is not really that high ( if we talking about military casualties ) . 
  axis forces on eastern front lost ~ 5mil . 
  man as kia/mia and ~ 3mil . 
  as prisoners . 
  as kia/mia and ~ 5mil as prisoners . 
  how is it relevant to the level of the plane ? 
  only thing which is historical in wt is planes performance in the air . 
  opponent pairing is not supposed to be historical here . 
  its a game with ww2 planes , not ww2 air warfare sim . 
   they said on mutiple occasions said that they do n't give a shit about aracade, 
  [ citation needed ], 
  cant argue about chaika , its should be higher . 
  these yak-1b are so op - no one , never . 
  leandleased kittyhawk maybe ? 
  or , if you like twin-engine fighters , pe-3bis ( lol ) ? 
  hulk did some brilliant passing today . 
  nice video as always , grmlz . 
  regarding what you said about earlier german tree - have you tried he-112 a0 ? 
  its incredibly fun to fly , at least in frb .
