  in january of 1500 , kniaz vasiliy v signed away pskov 's navy of 3 heavy ships , 2 light ships , 1 galley and transport , to be stored or re-purposed . 
  all ships but the 1 transport a token 1 light ship are to be dismantled ; each cannon ( a total of 142 * according to eu4 * ) to be placed upon the walled city of pskov , the wood and cargo to be re-purposed into building materials ( basically http://i.imgur.com/rwyq1vc.jpg ) and firewood . 
  the remaining transport and trading vessel are to be put into storage , * mothballed * , until a need for them becomes apparent . 
  kniaz vasiliy v , and the boyar council of pskov formally sends an offer of alliance to kniaz ivan fyodorovich and the principality of ryazan . 
  through the signing of this document , each nation pledges to assist one another in wars both defensive and offensive . 
  let our two nations stand tall - together - in the face of danger , and persevere for centuries to come . 
  signed , kniaz vasiliy v of the pskov republic . 
  quick question ; i started the game as an irish minor , and have just finished taking over the british isles ( took a while , but was very fun ) . 
  i 've finally wiped out all of england 's provinces , wiping them out as a nation . 
  i then culture-converted to english , and got the descision to `` form the english nation '' , which i did . 
  i was kinda hoping my government type would switch to that of the ` english monarchy ' , which gets a lot of unique features like the parlaiment , events , etc. 
  is there any way to do that ? 
  i 'd prefer to do it legit , but for the sake of theme , i 'd be willing to use console commands , too . 
  it 's a cold winter morning at the pskov kremlin , with christmas just around the corner . 
  a maid tentatively knocks on the kniaz 's door , bringing in fresh linen for when the kniaz awakens . 
  as she opens the door she is surprised to find vasiliy to be already awake . 
  the sun has just risen , yet it looks as if the kniaz has been at work since its fall . 
  `` gather the council '' he orders , not looking away from his documents . 
  `` this can not wait '' . 
  the kniaz sighs as the maid turns and hastily exits the royal chambers . 
  ` i am doing this for you ' , he thinks , ` for all the people of pskov , so that the common man can sleep without fear of persecution , fear of the seizure of his lands and property by a violent government who cares not for its people . ' ` we will not fall to the beast that is moskva . ', 
  the entirety of the veche sits present when the kniaz arrives . 
  without waiting for their questions , he begins : `` are any of you , present here , that is too young to remember the fall of novgorod ? '' there 's no response `` then you must remember , full-well , its desperate attempts at survival just days before muscovy 's invasion . 
  moscow , much like it has been trying - so far unsuccessfully - to do to us , had greatly limited novgorod 's power , forcing it to sign the treaty of yazhelbitsy , which forbade it from having its own diplomatic ties and legislation . 
  when novgorod began reaching out to its southern neighbors , to poland and lithuania , muscovy declared such actions to be illegal . 
  it invaded , and massacred the republic , before it could even defend its actions . 
  had it completed the process , allied its southern neighbors , perhaps the nation would be alive today . 
  it waited too long , and was punished for its inaction . 
  i will not make that same mistake . '', 
  `` to us , the poles have shown nothing less than outright friendship , guaranteeing our independence while the muscovite leaders threaten it near-daily . 
  those who were supposed to be so close to us , our russian brothers in arms , have threatened us , insulted us , and now attempt to publicly humiliate us , when we refuse to assist them in their aggression against what i have come to see as our true brothers . '', 
  `` after all this , you can not believe that moscow has any affection left towards us . 
  they have disowned us and so we must look to a new motherland . '', 
  to aleksandras jagiellon , king of lithuania, 
  i , kniaz vasiliy v , on behalf of the veche and people of the pskov republic , request entrance - as a member - into the commonwealth of nations between the seas , long may it prosper . 
  [ m / tldr ] do n't feel like writing any in-depth rp ; basically i increase my troop-count , and move them in towards vilnius , lithuania . 
  the pskov republic has received word of muscovy 's ( we do not recognize the title of `` russia '' ) second war of aggression since the start of the 16th century . 
  we will not let this behemoth defeat us . 
  together we stand strong , united . 
  pskov has increased its army size to its full garrison ( 4,532 men ) , and will move them , in their entirety , to protect their brothers of lithuania . 
  the pskov army moves quickly towards vilnius , before the muscovites have time to invade our borders .
