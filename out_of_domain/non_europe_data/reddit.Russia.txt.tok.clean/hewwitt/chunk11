  so i started up a single-player ironman game right after playing a multiplayer session w / the ledger turned off . 
  i - somehow - play the sp game for like 50 years without needing to use the ledger , and do incredibly well ( played as perm and broke free + rekt muscovy [ i 've been trying to do this for weeks ] ) . 
  then , `` oh shit '' , i look at my ledger and that shit 's turned off . 
  i can start a new ironman game with ledger turned on , no prob , but this save 's ledgers stuck turned off . 
  what do ? 
  is there any way to fix this ? 
  i want to be able to fix this save file , not create a new one .
