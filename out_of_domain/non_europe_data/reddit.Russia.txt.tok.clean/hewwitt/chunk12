  based on this youtube clip from / r/videos . 
  hey / r/getmotivated ... i really need some advice here . 
  * quick bio : used to get pretty good grades back in highschool , but ended with a significantly worse gpa in my final term than before due to motivation issues ( got [ conditional ] offer to my university of choice , and felt like i did n't need to work as hard anymore ; ended up almost failing finals , and having my offer pulled ) . 
  currently going to ` second best ' university ( first year , second term ) , with goal to eventually transfer back into my top pick ( but right now , that 's not even close to being able to happen ) . 
  i have adhd , but have been taking pills which help my focus greatly . 
  have social and ` regular ' anxiety problems , but not taking anything for them ; it 's usually manageable . 
  more recently , i 've started seeing a psychiatrist , talking to counselor , and have really been trying to improve myself overall . 
  i 've had this one thought for a while which , though perhaps some might see it as a bit dark , really encourages me ; the fact that i know many people that are my parents age or older that are still struggling to take control of their lives . 
  i myself have been struggling to motivate myself , push myself to grow , over these past few years , but have been making progress . 
  more recently , i 've started eating less , eating healthier , losing weight ( lost 25 pounds these last 3 months ) , and have felt more confident about myself as a result . 
  i 'm trying to get a better sleep schedule , to plan out my day better , organise my work and plans , and -- though this is one i have more trouble with than anything else -- get my work done in advance . 
  if i can manage to do all this , be able to overcome my troubles , and better control my actions , and do all that this early on in life ... i could accomplish so much more with my life . 
  and the thing is i really am making a concerted effort to try and better myself in every way i can . 
  and yet ... there 's one aspect of my life , arguably the most important part ( at least in terms of future ) , that i just can not handle . 
  school , studying , actually doing my damn homework .
