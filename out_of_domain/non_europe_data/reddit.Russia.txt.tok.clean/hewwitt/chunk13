  if anything , i seem to have developed some sort of compulsive fear of working ... i have virtually no ability to follow a work schedule . 
  my brain freaks out whenever homework is mentioned . 
  i lose all reason when studying is involved ; `` i 'll do it tomorrow '' , i tell myself , virtually everyday -- either that or my subconscious omits it entirely -- until whatever assignment i 've been putting off is due the next morning . 
  then , just before i sit down to work or study for this -- often very important test/quiz/assignment -- i think `` oh !, 
  how could i forget ; i have to do my laundry/organise some more files/get some food before the dining hall closes '' . 
  i 'll do this infinitely less-important task , and then , after getting home think `` oh you 're tired , why not browse reddit/watch some youtube videos/lay down for an hour . 
  you 'll recuperate your energy , and be completely ready to start after you 're done '' . 
  this hour will often either find itself stretched longer and longer , or the process repeats after an hour , with me suddenly realising that there was `` just one more thing '' i needed to take care of first . 
  in the end , it 's suddenly 2am , 3am , with the test or assignment due at 10 . 
  i have , in the past , gone into full panic mode at this point , and have ended up pulling an all nighter , and just barely passing the test or handing in the assignment , but more and more , recently , the next and final excuse comes -- '' it 's way too late to do anything now , better just give up '' -- and so i shake my head , and go to sleep . 
  it 's not that i hate being productive , or am scared of work as a concept ; half the time when i make an excuse not to sit down and start studying , do work for a course which i should -- and really , deep down do -- love , i end up spending hours upon hours making `` productivity '' spreadsheets , organising all my pictures , neurotically cleaning my dorm for 3 hours in the middle of the night ( 2am ) or spending a whole evening trying to come up with a ` new and improved ' signature for myself . 
  so it 's not at all that i hate working : many the things above required a lot of thought , took hours of very boring setup , and often turned out to be quite useful ( sleep schedule spreadsheets , gpa calculator , etc ) . 
  that said , however , if i had , instead , spent the time studying , it would have been an infinitely better use of my time . 
  i do n't know what my brain finds so especially terrifying about school-related work , but it really seems as though i 'd rather do ** anything ** other than my fucking homework . 
  and i really do n't know why , or how to solve this problem ... 
  * tl ; dr : i can never actually sit down and work . 
  i will make excuses for not working the entire way there , and feel like my subconscious ' # 1 priority is avoiding school work . 
  any advice ?

  [ x-post from / r/getmotivated ], 
  hey / r/getstudying ... i really need some advice here . 
  * quick bio : used to get pretty good grades back in highschool , but ended with a significantly worse gpa in my final term than before due to motivation issues ( got [ conditional ] offer to my university of choice , and felt like i did n't need to work as hard anymore ; ended up almost failing finals , and having my offer pulled ) . 
  currently going to ` second best ' university ( first year , second term ) , with goal to eventually transfer back into my top pick ( but right now , that 's not even close to being able to happen ) . 
  i have adhd , but have been taking pills which help my focus greatly . 
  have social and ` regular ' anxiety problems , but not taking anything for them ; it 's usually manageable . 
  more recently , i 've started seeing a psychiatrist , talking to counselor , and have really been trying to improve myself overall . 
  i 've had this one thought for a while which , though perhaps some might see it as a bit dark , really encourages me ; the fact that i know many people that are my parents age or older that are still struggling to take control of their lives . 
  i myself have been struggling to motivate myself , push myself to grow , over these past few years , but have been making progress . 
  more recently , i 've started eating less , eating healthier , losing weight ( lost 25 pounds these last 3 months ) , and have felt more confident about myself as a result . 
  i 'm trying to get a better sleep schedule , to plan out my day better , organise my work and plans , and -- though this is one i have more trouble with than anything else -- get my work done in advance . 
  if i can manage to do all this , be able to overcome my troubles , and better control my actions , and do all that this early on in life ... i could accomplish so much more with my life . 
  and the thing is i really am making a concerted effort to try and better myself in every way i can . 
  and yet ... there 's one aspect of my life , arguably the most important part ( at least in terms of future ) , that i just can not handle . 
  school , studying , actually doing my damn homework .

  ( sorry if i went on a bit long ), 
  it was a really funny joke, 
  i 'm wondering if anybody has any suggestions . 
  i 'm looking for a book , or short story perhaps , which takes place during the fall of the ( western ) roman empire . 
  the byzantine / eastern roman empire might be ok too , but would prefer rome * proper * . 
  ( something like a roman version of marco polo ), 
  i 'm really hoping to find something ** from someone 's perspective ** , though . 
  not looking for any sort of * documentary * . 
  can be complete fiction , i 'd be ok with either .
