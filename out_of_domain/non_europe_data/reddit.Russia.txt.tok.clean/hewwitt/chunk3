  regionally , our church ties go back to that of the novgorod republic , which was not in muscovite hands when the church of russia - for its own benefit - separated from the ecumenical patriarchate ( church of constantinople ) in 1448 . 
  * our * loyalty has not faltered ; unchanged since the times of kievan rus ' . 
  we remain devoted to the orthodox church , ** under the ecumenical patriarchate and metropolitan of kiev , galicia and all rus ' . 
  ** the ecumenical patriarchate of kiev is currently established in ruthenia . 
  to put it bluntly ; moscow has no sway in pskov . 
  this fact is righteous in the eyes of the lord , and should be more-than clear to bishops of the republic of pskov . 
  we will not bow to the orders of a nation which demands that all its fellow russian states assist it in its wars of aggression , where not some decades ago muscovy itself disregarded the russian brotherhood and butchered the good peoples of novgorod . 
  we will not suffer the same fate . 
  [ m ] basically your * excommunication * falls on deaf ears . 
  the orthodox religion does not have one ` pope ' , but rather regional metropolitans who have power over nations within their control . 
  while muscovy follows the metropolitan of moscow , we follow the metropolitans of kiev , galicia and all rus ' . 
  neither has jurisdiction in the nations following the other . 
  edit : edited for clarity, 
  refer to the comments of the `` metropolitan excommunicates pskov '' [ event ] . 
  ( https://www.reddit.com/r/empirepowers/3ej4ii/ ) . 
  the metropolitan of moscow has no sway in the pskov republic . 
  `` the orthodox religion does not have one ` pope ' , but rather regional metropolitans who have power over nations within their control . 
  while muscovy follows the metropolitan of moscow , we follow the metropolitan of kiev , galicia and all rus ' . 
  neither has jurisdiction in the nations following the other . '', 
  to put it simply , the moscow metropolitan is in no position to excommunicate a nation which does not follow him .

  the veche of pskov is in favor of such centralization . 
  [ m ] what about pskov ? 
  edit : keep in mind ; i 'm a safe route directly into russia and beyond, 
  would be great if a mod could take a look at these for me :, 
  based on, 
  ( check my comments ), 
  the pskov republic is more-than happy to trade with the dutch people !, 
  yeah i was thinking that this was done before ... but to be fair full-annexing japan is new ( and pretty fucking amazing if all the daimyos do n't revolt immediately ) . 
  i 'm not 100 % sure either way , they seemed to keep their alliances and such but vassals can do that too so idk . 
  ae was terrible though , yeah , one had a -183 opinion mostly due to ae . 
  `` oppression of the mongols ? '', 
  you are the one who has annexed and oppressed the mongol people , when they rose up to help lithuania against the aggression of your nation . 
  your own mad king has declared his second offensive war in little more than 2 years , while the those east of you who have been bullied and bruised are working diligently to prevent such bloodshed . 
  it seems ivan the terrible has come early . 
  pskov will do all within its power to defend its new brothers in the commonwealth . 
  k can i please get some moderation on these posts ? 
  they are clearly invalid .

  thank you . 
  [ m ] fun, 
  novgorod , i love seeing them survive past the 1500s, 
  my top starting pokemon is bulbasaur . 
  i just found out that there are some really ` rare ' nation in eu4 , like york , lancaster , and stuff like the jalayirid horde ( basically a mongol qara qoyunlu ) . 
  a user on https://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/3a4zz7 was nice enough to provide a guide on how to spawn the jalayirids ( though i couldnt get it to work , actually : < ) , and i realised you could do the same for other nations like york/lancaster . 
  guide is as follows ( using console commands ) :, 
  1 . move your capital to normandie/caux ( `` adm '' for more admin points ), 
  2 . release a bunch of vassals like wales and cornwall, 
  3 . sell them all/all but one of your mainland provinces, 
  4 . your primary culture should now be norman ( you might need to release guyenne too ), 
  5 . get 1 stability , and click `` accept cultural shift '', 
  6 . integrate all your vassals ( `` integrate nol '' `` integrate crn '' `` integrate wls '' , etc. ), 
  7 . you might need to get your unrest up ( declare no-cb wars and peace out for money , for instance ), 
  8 . once unrest is up a decent amount , you should have seperatist rebels in your lands which want to create york ,, 
  or lancaster . 
  9 . click `` accept demands '' of rebels , and voila !, 
  york/lancaster should be spawned in the game . 
  ** edit : this only works on patch 1.12 ( the current one ) , and prior . 
  this wo n't work on the 1.13 / beta patch . 
  ` fraid not . 
  i 'm not sure about some of the other ones , but both lancaster and york have national ideas . 
  look for northernsentinel 's comment , he made a huge list of 'em . 
  well , for one , i did n't make the list . 
  but it does note that some of the nations on the list are `` rare '' or `` very rare '' . 
  i obviously have n't tried to create every single nation , but some of these rare or very rare nations seem to be only releasable through the method above ( ex . 
  also the list * was * made 4 months ago ; maybe some of the nations on the list were not normally releasable at the time . 
  hmm , i guess that makes sense ... 
  though if it was just that should n't he have added nations like ireland and great britain ( if sardinia-piedmont is on there ) . 
  i 'm not sure what the list is of then , really . 
  thanks though , 
  not really . 
  that 's how i found out about them too , actually ; if you convert a 1.13 save to 1.12 , the ` new ' nations like florence , the maldives , etc , become rare nations like lancaster and doughlat . 
  sure , but the point to the above guide is that you can do it without console commands too , though you might want to do it a bit differently ( like move to ireland instead of france ) . 
  the console commands are just there to speed up the process . 
  shame : < . 
  that 's alright though , i was having less and less time for this anyways . 
  you guys have fun though , long live the commonwealth !, 
  no hard feelings though russia . 
  you fought well , and deserve the spoils of your labor . 
  did you just get your offer revoked ? 
  i also submitted an appeal , but have not gotten any response besides `` we 've received your appeal , and are reviewing it now '' . 
  anyways , i could n't find any `` form '' online , but i contacted an admissions adviser , and they sent me it :, 
  1 ) 6 hours is a long time , yeah , but you do n't have to come for the whole 6 hours . 
  if you have to leave an hour early or something , go ahead . 
  plus we 'll have breaks every couple of hours . 
  2 ) yep, 
  3 ) i 'm fairly new to the mod , myself , but i would n't say there are many objectively underpowered countries . 
  if you play thule you 're probably fucked tho, 
  sure , you do n't have to stay the full 6 hours . 
  sure , why not, 
  the game 's already started , but you 're welcome to jump in if you want . 
  keep in mind most of the strongest nations are already taken though . 
  we have the savegame file uploaded on the steam group , if you want to check it out for yourself . 
  yep !, 
  ottomans will sometimes ( probably around a third of the time ) start off neutral towards you .
