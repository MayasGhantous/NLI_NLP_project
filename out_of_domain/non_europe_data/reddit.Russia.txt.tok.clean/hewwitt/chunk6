  if there is fresh water inside sothoryos , it is likely they are secluded places , not easily accessible by those who live there . 
  it 's pretty much impossible to know the exact shape of the continent , past the known world , but we can guess at its general shape in many cases . 
  on sothoryos ' north-western coast , we can assume there to be a small gulf , between the larger continent , and the summer islands . 
  if we assume that the summer islands did not form volcanically ( and nothing suggests that they were ) , it 's likely that they split from the sothoryos mainland , many millions of years ago . 
  as such , we 'd expect some sort of indent in its north-western coast , perhaps some small and fractured islands closer to the mainland as well . 
  on the north-eastern side , the coast facing the jade sea , we can do little more than speculate . 
  both ulthos and sothoryos seem to be curving down toward each-other in the maps we have . 
  really all we have to go on is that the body of water is a ** sea ** ; it 's unlikely that the division between sothoryos and ulthos is all that large , or that the jade sea expands * directly * into any ocean past the two continents . 
  ** ulthos : **, 
  * tldr ; based on the saffron straights name , ulthos is likely planetos ' version of india/persia . 
  sothoryos and ulthos are probably separate , but may seem like one large landmass from some perspectives . 
  its geography is likely comprised mainly of forests and plains . 
  when it comes to ulthos , we 're shit out of luck . 
  there 's definitely a distinction , between it and essos/sothoryos , so we can safely make the assumption that it 's its own continent . 
  but as to it 's content ? 
  who knows . 
  based on what we know about the other 3 continents , it seems that each landmass represents a region/continent in real life . 
  westeros is western europe , eastern essos is a mix of balkans/near-east , central essos and the peoples of the dothraki sea are central asian/middle-eastern ( ish ) , and the farther east you go in essos , the farther east you go on earth , with the yi ti being the asoiaf-equivalent of china . 
  the theories on ulthos range from it being everything from arabia or west africa , to australia/new zealand . 
  if i had to guess , however , based on what little contextual clues there are , i 'd say ulthos was india ( or perhaps iran/afganistan ) . 
  the * saffron straits * name gives us a pretty big clue . 
  if we look at [ world-wide saffron production ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/saffron_crocus_sativus_modern_world_production.png ) ( i 'm a nerd , i know ) , the parts of the world not already having made an appearence in got , and being large producers of saffron , are almost exclusive to india . 
  when it comes to geography , i 'm inclined to keep ulthos more grassland/savanna than jungle ; based on india/iran 's biomes . 
  with the shadowlands looming in essos , above the saffron straits , you can bet that all the saffron production is happening south of the crossing . 
  when ulthos is described , it 's never really clear whether it 's entirely separate from sothoryos . 
  the fact that a distinction has been made , however , is telling in and of itself . 
  if i had to guess , based on the region and its similarity to the real world , ulthos is more-or-less like planetos ' arabia ( at least geographically ) . 
  there 's probably some small * suez canal-esque * straight between sothoryos and ulthos , but without more detail , the two could be confused as being one and the same . 
  ** far-east essos : **, 
  * tldr ; mossovy might mean muscovy ( old russia ) . 
  north-eastern essos probably extends upwards . 
  south-eastern essos 's shadow lands continue on for a bit , but i have no clue as to what is past that . 
  if mossovy is at all a step in the direction of medieval russia 's muscovy , the land far north and east of essos is the terrain between the ` steppes ' -- the plains of the jogos nhai , and the forests between the surrounding plains and sands . 
  my guess is that past mossovy , the continent would curve upwards . 
  there 's very little to go off of , besides the name , but it seems logical-enough . 
  i have very little to go in the south as well , except for the abrupt cut-off of the shadow lands . 
  they more-than-likely expand a good-ways east a bit more , but past that it 's pretty much impossible to guess at the terrain apart from the coastline . 
  thanks !, 
  haha , no i 'm a student ; doing a comp sci major . 
  i 've always just liked maps and geography . 
  thanks though !, 
  sure , go ahead !, 
  send me a link when you 're done , too . 
  this map is the result of me deciding to spend the weekend trying to figure out how the got/asoiaf world ( planetos ) might look past the `` known world '' map 's borders . 
  i was originally going to try and guess at the whole rest of the world , but realized that would be way too inaccurate ; based on little more than speculation , and as a result would be worth very little . 
  instead , based on contextual clues ( such as the waters separating essos and ulthos being called the `` saffron straits '' , or off-hand comments made by grrm ( like how the lands of always winter , far above the wall are `` about the size of canada '' . 
  ) , i 've drawn up a reasonable guess as to what the world looks like past the maps we have . 
  * credit goes to the https://atlasoficeandfireblog.wordpress.com guys for the base map . 
  ** lands of always winter : **, 
  * tldr ; based on what we 've seen , the lands far north of the wall are a mix of high snowy mountains , and long expanses of frozen wasteland . 
  if there are forests that far north , they are few in number , and do n't expand past the mountains . 
  its overall geography likely resembles that of greenland . 
  - in an [ old interview ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyg1rk1xgt4#t=1m06s ) that grrm did on hbo , he says that `` there 's actually quite a lot of westeros north of the wall . 
  it 's a large expanse of land , probably as large as canada '' . 
  - from the game of thrones wiki , the geography of this region is said to primarily consist of `` snow , ice mountains '' . 
  if there are any forests this far north , they are sparse , and likely do n't extend far inland . 
  from all the images and scenes we 've seen this far past the wall , the region seems to consist of looming mountains , and long stretches of flat frozen wasteland . 
  based on all the info i could find , i think that the geography of tloaw resembles , if anything , something along the lines of greenland ; high mountains by the coast and frozen expanses of ice if you go at all inland . 
  ** sothoryos : **, 
  * tldr ; sothoryos ' south-western coast is likely fractured and indented , forming a gulf between itself and the summer islands . 
  its south-eastern coast likely curves downwards towards ulthos , a large river or small straight separating the two land-masses . 
  the thick forests seen in the existing maps probably continue down the coast on either direction . 
  past that are the deserts and mountains reported by jaenara belaerys . 
  - the asoiaf wiki , notes that `` according to george r.r. 
  martin , sothoryos is an analogue of africa during the medieval period , except that it is even less well-known and explored . '', 
  - really the only things we know about sothoryos , is from jaenara belaerys ' 3-year long flight over the continent . 
  she reported that sothoryos was a `` land without end '' , finding only ever-expanding jungle , deserts , and mountains . 
  no outside cities have ever been founded deeper than the coast of sothoryos . 
  everything seems to suggest the continent is highly inhospitable the farther in you go . 
  what little native population sothoryos has , seems to be primarily based in the dense forests by the coast . 
  it 's difficult to know what is farther inland , but from belaerys ' descriptions , and the little information we have from previous ( attempted ) colonization , it 's not fit for long-term survival . 
  assuming i 'm right in that the native population lives by the coast , i think that past the dense jungle , we 'd find deserts and mountains . 
  belaerys does n't mention many inland seas or fresh-water lakes , but must have come across some , if she survived her 3-year journey . 
  if there is fresh water inside sothoryos , it is likely they are secluded places , not easily accessible by those who live there . 
  it 's pretty much impossible to know the exact shape of the continent , past the known world , but we can guess at its general shape in many cases . 
  on sothoryos ' north-western coast , we can assume there to be a small gulf , between the larger continent , and the summer islands .

  as such , we 'd expect some sort of indent in its north-western coast , perhaps some small and fractured islands closer to the mainland as well . 
  on the north-eastern side , the coast facing the jade sea , we can do little more than speculate . 
  both ulthos and sothoryos seem to be curving down toward each-other in the maps we have . 
  really all we have to go on is that the body of water is a ** sea ** ; it 's unlikely that the division between sothoryos and ulthos is all that large , or that the jade sea expands * directly * into any ocean past the two continents . 
  ** ulthos : **,
