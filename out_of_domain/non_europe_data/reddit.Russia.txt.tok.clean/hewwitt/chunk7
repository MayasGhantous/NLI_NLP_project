  there 's probably some small * suez canal-esque * straight between sothoryos and ulthos , but without more detail , the two could be confused as being one and the same . 
  ** far-east essos : **, 
  * tldr ; mossovy might mean muscovy ( old russia ) . 
  north-eastern essos probably extends upwards . 
  south-eastern essos 's shadow lands continue on for a bit , but i have no clue as to what is past that . 
  if mossovy is at all a step in the direction of medieval russia 's muscovy , the land far north and east of essos is the terrain between the ` steppes ' -- the plains of the jogos nhai , and the forests between the surrounding plains and sands . 
  my guess is that past mossovy , the continent would curve upwards . 
  there 's very little to go off of , besides the name , but it seems logical-enough . 
  i have very little to go in the south as well , except for the abrupt cut-off of the shadow lands . 
  they more-than-likely expand a good-ways east a bit more , but past that it 's pretty much impossible to guess at the terrain apart from the coastline . 
  lol, 
  the text is not from the game , if you 're wondering . 
  i just really liked the quote , and the background , and put the two together . 
  lol , yeah i could upload a version with different font . 
  what would you prefer ? 
  edit : nevermind , then . 
  i 'm going to bed . 
  yep . 
  decided that the consequences of withdrawing/failing cmpt 125 were too harsh to just give up without really even trying ; and hey , looks like it 's never too late . 
  i ended up studying from about 3pm thursday , right up until 1:30 pm friday , only taking like ~ 1.5 hours to walk/eat/shower with a 2.5-hour nap in the middle . 
  tired as all-hell , but i went from not being able to answer  90 % of the questions on the assignment , to getting like a c + / b on the midterm . 
  thanks , btw ; your comment really helped push me in the right direction . 
  i was in pretty much the same position as you yesterday ; except that i had left everything to the last ** day ** . 
  i had two midterms the next day ( today ) ; but 1 was considerably more important than the other . 
  i ended up studying from around 3pm yesterday , right up until 1:30 pm today , which is when i had my big test . 
  i took a ~ 2 hour nap ( wanted to have 3 hours , but could n't fall asleep for a while ) , and spent a bit of time eating/showering/walking but otherwise spent about 19 hours non-stop studying my fucking ass off ( had 32 pages of notes by the end . ) . 
  i ended up going from not knowing how to answer  90 % of the questions on the easy pre-assignment , to getting a c + / b on the midterm ( which is pretty spectacular , considering ) . 
  the day before , on wednesday , also at a ridiculous time of night ( like yourself ) , i went to bed having given up * completely * on trying to study . 
  i had  a week to study before then , and thought i was completely out of time . 
  i was ready to withdraw from my course ( and its co-requisite ) ; drop down from 13 units to 7 . 
  [ 4 of which was from a course i failed last term ] . 
  i looked for help online too , and had someone tell me the `` midterm is tomorrow ... you still have a lot of time to study . '', 
  -- this was a bit of an optimistic statement , i thought , but hey , it 's certainly not gon na get any easier the longer you put it off ; time does n't run backwards . 
  so instead of continuing to wallow in self-pity , i woke up , ate some breakfast , sat down at my computer , * and just started fucking working * . 
  i did n't really think about it at first ; you need to understand that the consequences of you not studying are big , but do n't focus on that fact to the point where you start panicking . 
  the most important thing for you to do is just sit the fuck down , and start studying . 
  do n't think about the pros and cons , do n't think about how much you have to do , or how you could be watching some videos or playing games right now ... just sit down and start working . 
  do you have a higher resolution version of this gif ? 
  i 'd love to make this my desktop background if you have 1920-1080 and/or 1920-1200 versions . 
  you bastards . 
  yeah , he 's great . 
  more importantly , however : your scoliosis is literally a slice of beef jerky . 
  pls explain, 
  for anyone that 's wondering why my cities are so close together ; i decided to play this current game building only strait-cities . 
  i noticed that there 's a lot of inland lakes and stuff when i loaded in and just though it would be a funny kind of challenge run . 
  i believe i do , yeah . 
  sure , i can send ya a copy in like 9 hours tomorrow morning . 
  ( currently lying in bed about to doze off ), 
  edit : it is a noquitters mod save tho btw . 
  not sure if you can load it up in vanilla , but you can check yourself , later . 
  here ya go : https://uploadfiles.io/86732, 
  have fun !, 
  it 's an archipelago . 
  i just randomed it . 
  mirror ? 
  goodbye, 
  goodbye, 
  nar, 
  this, 
  hey , i just found this post when i was searching for more info on rejection sensitivity on the sub . 
  looks like op 's gone off , but i would definitely be interested in an update . 
  how 's the upped dose ? 
  any more-noticeable improvements/changes ? 
  thanks in advance !, 
  might sound a little counter-intuitive , but try the long dark . 
  it 's a really slow-paced atmospheric survival game . 
  it 's very beautiful and you really get immersed in the game and next thing you know you look up and 3 hours have passed . 
  just a pro-tip tho , if you 're gon na check it out ; find and download a map from google and and keep it handy while playing . 
  it 's easy to lose track of where you are otherwise . 
  currently working on a heart + eagle merge image . 
  should have it done in maybe 15/30 mins . 
  all done !, 
  a user from / r/serbia suggested we set up a heart or eagle between our borders to commemorate our alliance . 
  here 's my shot at it : https://imgur.com/a/opwwx ( full album ), 
  i tried to make it as compact as possible , so-as not to take up too much flag-space . 
  not sure where it 'd go , but i think it 'd turn out pretty great if we coordinated to set it up . 
  why not have a 2x2 south and east ? 
  no one 's building there , from what i can tell . 
  or at least have 1 going south . 
  people might be ok with a small amount of overlap , with the chicken , but another 1 above that would be cutting off expansion a bit too much , i think . 
  i suggest we do this https://imgur.com/a/2s3uw, 
  there 's a 1-tile overlap with leafs , and mcgill loses and `` l '' but this is it . 
  someone should let serbia know about the project before we start up tho . 
  i sent them a message and yeah they say they 're cool with it . 
  we already tried to get it started a couple hours ago , but there 's not a lot of communication , specifically between russia and serbia . 
  a lot of people on both sides thought it was griefing ... 
  that said , the leafs said they wo n't mess with the heart . 
  there 's a post about it on / r/russiaclan , too so most people should know about it . 
  we just need to make sure the other serbians know it 's us , and i think we should be able to get it started . 
  boy do i love politics in my favorite non-political sub !, 
  dude , chill . 
  loving the casual racism . 
  all people should be treated with decency unless their government 's politics do n't align with yours , huh ? 
  ok , right . 
  i 'm not advocating for the russian government here , though . 
  russia = / = putin , in the same way that the us = / = trump . 
  it 's interesting that / u/spiralyst 's last post was about how damaging hyper-partisanship can be , consider his comments here . 
  i do n't really follow politics all that much anymore . 
  but back when i did , the main thing i would hear when talking to some of the russians i knew who viewed americans quite negatively , was that it really was n't a difference in political opinion that made them dislike the us . 
  it was the hostility and ignorance they saw at virtually every single mention of russia in the west .
