  i 'm not saying that there is n't a whole lot to criticize about the way the russian government is run , but when someone 's first reaction is to insult the country as a whole , and respond w / racist remarks to a suggestion to maybetoneitdownalittle , then you have lost the right to complain about partisanship and political polarization . 
  and you 're not so big !, 
  the archbishop-elector of trier will attend , for some time at least . 
  he may not be able to stay for long , however . 
  johann is old , and can not dedicate as much time as he might like to the court . 
  ( ( i 'll be there for maybe half an hour , then i 'll probably have to leave : s . if i 'm not present when a vote needs to be made , the hre mod may act on my behalf . 
  [ i 'll be on ~ 3 hours after the start of the diet too , though , and can continue then , if decisions do n't have to be immediate ] ) ), 
  ( ( edit : i might have misunderstood the format , here . 
  if a literal ` meeting ' is n't taking place , then i have no problem `` attending '' . 
  i 'll look over the issues presented and will have a response later in the evening , today . ) ), 
  my brothers in faith ,, 
  greetings from trier . 
  archbishop-elector johann will make an appearance for the diet , though i fear it may be brief . 
  the archbishop , though we 're confident he shall make a full recovery , has been quite ill these past few days . 
  he 'll try to be present for any major decisions , but will cede his vote to the council ( ( hre mod ) ) , if a vote can not be held rather promptly . 
  in short , the archbishop 's views align with those of cologne 's . 
  he supports , in full , the establishment of reichsregiment , but is , so far , reluctant to support a change regarding the common penny tax . 
  rodrik , the archbishop 's senior scribe, 
  ( ( i 'll be there for like 30 mins , but ca n't stick around for much longer than that , probably . 
  i 'll be back on to review , and get more acquainted with the events of the last few day when i get back , a few hours after the diet . 
  [ had a midterm today and yesterday , but will soon have more than enough free time to start participating in-full . ] ) ), 
  ( ( edit : i might have misunderstood the format , here . 
  if a literal ` meeting ' is n't taking place , then i have no problem `` attending '' . 
  i 'll look over the issues presented and will have a response later in the evening , today . ) ), 
  `` seconded '' , the delegates hear , turning to see johann ii von baden . 
  a man of few words , the venerable archbishop of trier had sat , and had listened . 
  nestled between the elector-states of mainz , trier , and the palatinate , alongside its status as free city , frankfurt would be a natural place for such a council , he thought . 
  `` what use is a council of lords and lawmakers if it lacks the ability to pass laws !? '', 
  exclaims johann . 
  `` the purpose of the reichsregiment should be exactly that ; the regulation and amendment of regional laws and policies . 
  certainly , any decisions above that -- on an imperial level -- would be the emperor 's to decide , but the lower levels of administration , i think , should be handled , by the lower levels of government . '', 
  [ m ] edit : a word, 
  `` the reichsregiment , i think , put simply , entails the creation of a legislative entity , wherein estates will hold * some amount * of direct decision-making authority . '', 
  `` with the idea of ** reichskreis ** brought to the diet , perhaps this is where such regional/lower-level administration could be directed . 
  a compromise , of sorts , perhaps a merger of the two entities ? 
  `` at the very least , it 's something worth discussing . 
  i 'd like to hear from some of the other members of the kurf\u00fcrstenrat , on this matter , if possible . '',

  [ m ] edit : i 'll be offline for the next ~ 8/9 hours . 
  i 'll have my vote in before the diet ends , but wo n't be able to present any new issues . 
  if you want to present something like a merger , yourself , building off of this idea , as a vote , feel free . 
  the archbishop of trier will attend , as well . 
  a couple of gym-rat friends and i are having a bet/competition as to who can be the first to hit 195lbs on bench-press . 
  after a bunch of shit-talking , one guy told everyone to just post a pic of our `` progress '' so far , also * requiring * that we 've got to be in the same ` stance ' in our pictures . 
  cue everyone saying `` lmao fuck off m8 i clearly look bigger in the pic '' , etc , etc. 
  other friend jokes that one of us should photoshop the 3 photos together , make a jokey banner for our group chat . 
  i know photoshop , i crop the 3 pics , put ` em together . 
  do n't have much space to work with so we all end up being really close together in the resulting `` banner '' . 
  couple that with the way everyone 's hands are positioned , in the `` mandatory '' pose ... 
  ends up looking suuuuuuuper gay . 
  ( i 'm not judgin ' ) . 
  friend show the picture to his girlfriend . 
  everyone 's laughing their asses off . 
  we decide just to roll with it , fuck it we 're going full irony . 
  spice it up with some nice vaporwave \uff21 \uff25 \uff33 \uff34 \uff28 \uff25 \uff34 \uff29 \uff23 \uff33 , a favourite among our group of friends , and this is what you end up with . 
  r/mk rekindled my interest in design . 
  i 'm currenlty playing around with the idea of using a cnc machine to make custom keycaps and wrist-rests and stuff . 
  price could well be in another currency . 
  ( i 'm thinking canadian dollars ), 
  i 'm one of those people who make spreadsheets for everything . 
  i needed a new to-do list , and decided to `` digitize '' a great design i found online . 
  ( credit goes to [ `` crossbowprintables '' at etsy.com ] ( https://www.etsy.com/no-en/listing/203482424/weekly-planner-retro-printable-planner?ref=market ) ), 
  i made some minor changes , and designed to fit exactly on half a default 16:9 aspect-ratio screen . 
  i think it turned out quite well , and i just wanted to put it out there !, 
  feel free to use it however you want .

  i made * another * spreadsheet in the morning for my class schedule , and turned on link sharing cuz i needed to send it to someone . 
  before i sent it to anyone tho , like 30 seconds after , it said an anonymous user was currently viewing the file ( like a little blue tab said `` anonymous skunk '' ( lol ) was there . 
  i thought maybe i had another tab open or something but checked everywhere and nope . 
  i asked `` who is this ? '', 
  in the side chat and then they left . 
  i mean theres a decent chance it was just a glitch but the timing on everything was super fishy . 
  what the fuck did you just fucking say about me , you little prospect ? 
  i 'll have you know i graduated top of my class in the combat trials , and i 've been involved in numerous secret raids on jinn mesca , and i have over 300 confirmed kills . 
  i am trained in the khalt method and i 'm the top swordsman in the entire na region . 
  you are nothing to me but just another target . 
  i will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on adal , mark my fucking words . 
  you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the internet ? 
  think again , fucker . 
  as we speak i am contacting my secret network of lost prospects across the adalian columbary and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm , maggot . 
  the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life . 
  you 're fucking dead , kid . 
  i can be anywhere , anytime , and i can kill you in over 96 ( as of the latest patch ) ways , and that 's just with my bare-hands . 
  not only am i extensively trained in unarmed combat , but i have access to the entire arsenal of like 5 swords and war gloves and i will use to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the server , you little shit . 
  if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little `` clever '' comment was about to bring down upon you , maybe you would have held your fucking tongue . 
  but you could n't , you did n't , and now you 're paying the price , you goddamn idiot . 
  i will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it . 
  you 're fucking dead , prospect .
