  get what ? 
  the absolver tunic ? 
  you get it after fighting risryn ( last boss ) for the second time once you hit lvl 30 in combat trials . 
  thanks ... man ... 
  so i wanted to do a meme game where i joined the hre a non-western , non-christian nation . 
  i decided on tunis ; they 're close enough to core an adjacent province and win a day-1 no-cb war ( i chose to war the pope ) . 
  after winning the war , full-annexing the pope ( with the exception of avignon ) , and getting near 200ae with half of europe , i buckled down . 
  i spent the next 30 years improving relations , getting out of like 4 or 5 coalition wars by releasing african minors or paying 100 % warscore worth of gold ( and subsequently going bankrupt twice and boosting my corruption to 30 + ) . 
  eventually i was able to improve relations enough ( and ae died down naturally ) to the point where i was finally able to win a coalition war and start turning things around . 
  austria had rivaled aragon , and was really happy i beat the shit out of him , and went friendly towards me . 
  i had to empty what was left in my pockets , and gift them ~ 200 duckets , but i was finally able to get austria 's opinion high enough to where i could join the hre ( at this point already having converted to catholicism ) . 
  a couple months later i notice that cologne was voting for me ( for some reason ) , and that brandenburg was not too far off too . 
  i thought `` would n't it be funny if i become emperor '' and started improving w / brandenburg , not really expecting anything . 
  i have no clue how i missed it , but cue a couple years pass , and i notice that `` you can demand unlawful territory '' banner pop up at the top of my screen . 
  mfw i memed my way into becoming emperor of the hre as tunis . 
  still having ae problems , from the initial war . 
  have n't really been able to expand into italy/hre , but have taken every opportunity ( such as ottomans crushing mamluks ) to expand down south , where i can . 
  still emperor ( long live muhammad iv ) , but we 've gone through some roooougghhh times . 
  had another huge coalition war . 
  i actually managed to win it though , with the great help of austria and castile , but was full-occupied in the process , and now have accumulated quite a bit of loans . 
  still , all things considered , things have been going pretty damn well for tunis . 
  i think i 'll keep the tag , but switch away from catholic during the religious wars . 
  the negative modifiers from occupation of rome are pretty rough . 
  i do intend to remain emperor , of course , though there may be some brief * transition period * while we convert . 
  this has been a meme game from the start . 
  i do n't think it would be right to switch tags , as tempting as it is . 
  i do n't think allying kebab is super feasible at this point but yeah expanding in balkans and iberia is definitely a good idea . 
  i 'll try and do that when my ae finally dies down .

  the pskov republic was a medieval state centered around the trade-city of pskov . 
  in 1348 , pskov became independent from novgorod and established an aristocratic oligarchy . 
  for europe , pskov was a western outpost of russia , for russia , the pskov republic became the bridge towards europe . 
  its most powerful force was the merchants who brought the town into the hanseatic league . 
  exchange of commodities within the republic itself and its trade with novgorod and other russian cities , the baltic region , and western european cities made pskov one of the biggest handicraft and trade centers of rus ' . 
  importance of the city made it a subject of numerous sieges throughout its history . 
  the pskov kremlin withstood twenty-six sieges in the 15th century alone . 
  at one point , five stone walls ringed it , making the city practically impregnable . 
  following the subjugation of novgorod , the grand prince of moscovy turned his gaze towards pskov . 
  in 1510 , the city fell to muscovite forces , deporting more than 300 families of rich pskovians from the city , and putting an end to its importance as a trade-center . 
  in the short term , my goal will be to avoid the mistakes of the pskovian kniaz , and not let the republic fall into the hands of muscovy . 
  i intend to work with the various members of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth , and ensure the protection of the last russian republic . 
  at one point it seemed as thought pskov 's great navy was a gift from the gods , but its has become more than clear that it is both a costly and unnecessary undertaking .
