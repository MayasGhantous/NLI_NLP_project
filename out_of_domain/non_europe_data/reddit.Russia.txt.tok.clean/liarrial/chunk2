  as for ukranian transport planes , yes they shot them but the altitude was different . 
  us ship shot down airbus because the did not answer to their signals . 
  different situation . 
  everything is possible . 
  but i don ` t think of any single reason for russian military to give such system at all . 
  separatists actually posted about capturing buk , but photos show only loading machine . 
  so for now there are no real proofs , that rebels ever had this system . 
   the official icao report stated that ten attempts were made to contact iran air flight 655 : seven on military frequencies and three on commercial frequencies , addressed to an `` unidentified iranian aircraft '' and giving its speed as 350 knots ( 650 km/h ) , which was the ground speed of the aircraft their radar reported . 
  the crew of the iran air 655 , however , would have seen a speed of 300 knots ( 560 km/h ) on their controls , which was their indicated airspeed , possibly leading them to conclude that the vincennes was talking to another aircraft . 
  both sides and vincennes tried contacting flight 655 on several civilian and military frequencies . 
  in both cases passenger jets did not answer to military and were shot down on purpose . 
  it is a bit different that shooting down a plane at altitude reserved for commercial flights just because you can . 
  aha few nukes in poland would ecsalate this situation even more . 
  it was said on camera . 
  same for eu , actually . 
  putin claims that the deal was that eu and us would stay away from ukraine which russia sees as its own territory , at least half of it . 
  so the question who lies more is not that interesting . 
  well this statistics comes from the fact that german women can only had free abortion if the father was from inferior race , so the real numbers are not really known . 
  if you mean nkvd and later kgb - yes . 
  but considering the fact that majority of woman asked for free abortion claimed they were raped by mongoloid like russians - the number usually mentioned as number of woman raped by red army does not make this figure trustworthy . 
  it does not really proves that they were raped at all actually . 
  plus you shall bear in mind that in red army of that time you can be executed for muc less , that one thing . 
  another thing is ideological background , you may not understand what people who grew up in the 30-es were like . 
  people like to portray 30-es like time of mass executions and zero freedom . 
  but in reality people did not know about it , they saw themselves as the ruling class living in the best country in the world . 
  soviets achieved 99 % literacy and 100 % of children involved in school education which for that time was rather cool . 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anton_makarenko ) guy promoted his democratic ideas in educating street children , indeed with great succes . 
  that generation was raised with high morale standards and strong ideological background , you can call them fanatics or belivers but they were not criminals . 
  i know this because i know these people in person and this is the best generation we ` ve ever had . 
  a threat is a threat even if you make it look nice . 
  if poland chooses to place us missile defence system on its territory it ` s still a threat , no matter how many times they vote for it . 
  actually , if there was a choice crimea would join of their own free will . 
  actually they never really `` fought '' for it , there were number of referendums for independence . 
  interestingly enough majority of russians living in baltic state an others voted for independence of this states . 
  there were no objective information on economy of those states , and people thought they will be economically better without russia . 
  the same thinking prevailed in russia itself . 
  sadly enough russians who voted for independence of litva , latvia , estonia became people of second class in these countries - partly true for ukraine also . 
   also is n't it since they are in ukraine they would be ukrainians just ukrainians that spoke russian . 
  these are 2 different groups of people , russians living in ukraine and ukrainians speaking russian . 
  actually 95 % of ukrainians speak russian and majority as a first language disregard their feelings towards russia . 
   also the gdp growth of the nation of latvia has significantly increased over the years since it 's depart from the ussr . 
  i don ` t know what was gdp growth of latvia as a part of ussr , but if you look at ussr annual growth and latvia it is practically the same . 
   it was the choice of the people at that time and had the support of the majority in the country and most likely still does . 
  if those countries wanted to leave nato they could as long as the majority of the population wanted to . 
  if people wanted to region russia or leave nato they can easily support their local political candidates that support those ideals and put them in power though their local elections , which they goes to the overall country 's governing body where each region gets their say . 
  more or less as it is . 
  well during caribbean chrisis , us said that they would start a nuclear war if ussr did not remove missiles from cuba . 
  the same missiles , but without warhead were planned for poland together with radar systems . 
  is this a threat or not ? 
  then don ` t provoke a schizophrenic with nuclear weapons . 
  pilot batch is already produced . 
  testing starts in february . 
  they are already built . 
  maybe ministry of defence won ` t like it during testing but they are there in flesh . 
  for those who interested . 
  [ leader ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eduard_limonov ) of this party . 
  i do not know great or know , but it is already built and preordered . 
  it is not a prototype . 
  actually they promise to finally show it to the public during victory parade . 
  any source on that ? 
  they are killers , not the ones who paid for it, 
  well there were some solid proof provided, 
  actually two of the four are detained and being questioned . 
  what about brezhnev ? 
  he is ukranian . 
  also , ukranian communist party was most powerful after russian one and closely followed by gerogian one . 
  it is not so black and white . 
  any source on that ? 
  nah it ` s just get more boring after group b was banned, 
  any source ? 
  like 3 times faster ? 
  http://www.juwra.com/portugal_1985.html fastest speed 137 km/h, 
  http://www.juwra.com/portugal_2014.html fastest speed 108.43 km/h, 
  proof or did not happen, 
  [ 1986 total distance : 3,984.00 km ] ( http://www.juwra.com/monte_carlo_1986.html ), 
  [ 2014 total distance : 1,373.36 km ] ( http://www.juwra.com/monte_carlo_2014.html ), 
  so the distance 2,9 shorter . 
  so for the same distance toivonen would win with 3 h 49m . 
  they are faster in a straight line . 
  i agree on technology but they were two times more powerful , so they can be faster even with considerably inferior handling . 
  and of formula 1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_hungarian_grand_prix 1:22.715, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_hungarian_grand_prix 1:19.726, 
  track has not changed much, 
  can somebody explain how f1 car of 1989 can be faster than of 2014 ? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_hungarian_grand_prix 1:22.715, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_hungarian_grand_prix 1:19.726, 
  as far as i know the circuit did not change much . 
  yeah but it is the opposite it was longer in 1989 and still cars were faster . 
  as far as i understand configuration did not change . 
  and it was 1989 when turbomonsters were already banned . 
  i don ` t have alternative . 
  i am just curious if they are faster with all the limitations . 
  and if they are faster , for how much they are faster . 
  could you provide link for pole speed differences . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_hungarian_grand_prix 1:18.258, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_hungarian_grand_prix 1:19.388, 
  with the same length of a track, 
  yeah for desertion , robbery or disobedience you go to the frontline for 2-3 months . 
  it is not like they were taken from prison .
