  this 400 000 is the number of people that went through these battalions during the war . 
  sometimes famous coincides with the best , why not ? 
  i do not really think that most critics of the same era still alive and well never heard of other bands of that era . 
  well , bvr combat is more to do with a missile , than the jet itself . 
  * su-30 's missiles/radar/targeting is inferior to the typhoon 's . 
  typhoon 's engines/aerodynamics are inferior to the su-30s . 
  one 's benefit is for 0-20 miles range , the other is for 20-100 + range . 
  proof please, 
  nobody said that su is inferior in bvr . 
  ** radar ** : the fga-35 featured 688mm antenna and 1016 t/r modules ( originally planned 1064 ) with initial stage performance of a 200 km detection range for 3m2 rcs target . 
  later detection range was raised up to 250 km . 
  ** rcs ** : russian planes have several antiradar systems and nobody knows which is really better . 
  as for bvr missiles nobody knows for sure which one is better . 
  you can read good article [ here ] ( http://www.ausairpower.net/apa-rus-bvr-aam.html ), 
  citation from the article :, 
  * in terms of kinematic performance , a key factor which is almost universally ignored by western planners other than the f-22 and f-111 communities , is the impact of the launch aircraft 's kinematics at the point of missile launch . 
  a supersonic su-35 sitting at mach 1.5 and 45,000 ft will add of the order of 30 percent more range to an r-27 or r-77 missile . 
  low performance fighters like the f/a -18 e/f and f-35 jsf simply do not have this option in the real world , and the reach of their missiles is wholly determined by the parameters of the propellant load inside the missile casing , and the ability of the midcourse guidance algorithms to extract every bit of range from that stored energy . 
  the result of this is that an aim-120c / d which might look better on paper compared to an equivalent r-77 subtype will be outranged decisively in actual combat *, 
  ** radar ** still comparable capabilities . 
  ** rcs ** for sure they have . 
  but they are different systems . 
  without testing in real action nobody can say which concept is better . 
  ** missiles ** if you read the paper i linked , supercruise is not the only concern . 
  for example :, 
  * the performance of the aim-120a / b/c models in combat to date has not been spectacular . 
  test range trials have resulted in stated kill probabilities of 85 percent out of 214 launches for the aim-120c variant . 
  combat statistics for all three variants are less stellar , amounting to , according to us sources , ten kills ( including a friendly fire incident against a uh-60 ) of which six were genuine bvr shots , for the expenditure of just over a dozen aim-120 rounds . 
  the important parameter is that every single target was not equipped with a modern defensive electronic warfare package and therefore not representative of a state-of-the-art flanker in a modern bvr engagement . 
  against such `` soft '' targets the aim-120 has displayed a kill probability of less than 50 percent *, 
  so concept of bvr may not work good with modern jets having number of defensive systems . 
  in the end of the day , you need a missile that kills , not the missile that fly long distances . 
  moreover , if you look at the specs of russian missiles , they just say 130 plus km . 
  more like marketing to me . 
  we can shoot 300km !!!, 
  there is a number of russian missiles with range up to 400km , but i highly dought their effectiveness at this distance . 
  and what we get in the end ? 
  su is 2 times bigger , carries 2 times more ammo and two times cheaper . 
  it has more manouverability - i.e. 
  better at evading missiles and better in dog fight . 
  everything else is of comparable quality . 
  yes but bvr is good with inferior jets , it may not work well with comparable jet . 
  also su 35 has 2 times more missiles of different range . 
  it may not work well with modern jets with number of defensive system . 
  we\u013al russsia has enough oil, 
  well that ` s how it works.and it is sad . 
  it is cossak clothes which in turn originates from caucasus, 
  depends on their budget policy . 
  russian financial policy is very conservative now , with consecutive budget cuts in the following years . 
  why do they need automatic cannon then ? 
  actually price per unit for export model is about 50 -70 million according to sukhoi , the remaining is probably for licensing and facilities . 
  that you can not do a straight face, 
  do we really need so much talent ? 
  more exact translation is non-professional sportsmen . 
  how did they win then ? 
  yeah , some of their territory with the size of france . 
  after operation [ bagration ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_bagration ) germans were doomed regardless of us involvement . 
  * the german army never recovered from the materiel and manpower losses sustained during this time , having lost about a quarter of its eastern front manpower , similar to the percentage of loss at stalingrad ( about 17 full divisions ) . 
  these losses included many experienced soldiers , ncos and commissioned officers , which at this stage of the war the wehrmacht could not replace . 
  an indication of the completeness of the soviet victory is that 31 of the 47 german divisional or corps commanders involved were killed or captured . 
  actually china will benefit from paris agreement , because us and eu economies become less competetive . 
  and there are absolutely no guarantees that china will go green after 2050 whatsoever . 
  true , but china has 30 years of advantage anyway . 
  proof ? 
  without any hegemony will be just fine . 
  and there was almost 50 years without big wars in europe . 
  yeah but lower taxes is significant advantage . 
  moreover , these rankings usually asess amount of paperwork required to start a buisiness , which is not that relevant . 
  what problems could you possibly have in us starting a business except stupid regulation requiring additional papers ? 
  as i said it mostly papers : construction permits , getting electricity , registering property ( from doing business ranking ) . 
  most of these are irrelvant for small businesses . 
  increasing taxes will only slow down economy and cause capital outflow . 
  government revenue will not increase much also . 
  robustness is not really connected with tax system and debt inreased mainly during crisis and not connected with the cuts . 
  we have perfectly good example what would happen if us increases taxes , you gon na have growth like in eu - a little higher than zero . 
  but what the point doing al this in the first place ? 
  it will slow down growth in the long run leading to stagnation of wages . 
  whats wrong with concentration of wealth into the hands of a clever few ? 
  concentration of wealth into hands of the government will be much worse . 
  your society is literally oligarchy and it served you well . 
  russia is no difference . 
  serving youself helps the system too , so i do not see any problems . 
  raising taxes will only give more power to the government it does not need . 
  it was always this way . 
  as for stagnant wages for forty years it is simply not true . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.heritage.org/jobs-and-labor/report/stagnant-wages-fact-or-fiction ), 
  come on , soviet union economy collapsed partly due to lack of these . 
  crisis is good for the economy . 
  whatever , all the first world countries are like this . 
  yep , different parties supported by different businesses . 
  why you assume oligarchy do not require a bit of a competition ? 
  oligarchy literally means power of the few , democracy power of majority . 
  which one better descirbes most of the first world countries ? 
  obviously first one . 
  it is not really different from brick wall . 
  you do not need reinforced concrete for a small house . 
  what about drone strikes ? 
  every president has a kill license , the difference is with procedures to implement it, 
  early heinlein , azimov , bradbury , simak, 
  actually he did warned ukraine , that `` we will support independence of some regions if they ask for it '' in 2008 , nobody took that seriuos for some reasons .
