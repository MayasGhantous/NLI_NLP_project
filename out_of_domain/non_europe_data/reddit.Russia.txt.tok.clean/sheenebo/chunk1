playing only friendlies lowers your ranking , would be in 20 's -30 's if playing in qualifications, 
  joaozinho is not good enough , guilherme is on the bench . 
  not sure about mario . 
  i think he 's injured but maybe he still does n't have his passport . 
  guys do any of you have \u041c\u0430\u0442\u0447 \u0424\u0443\u0442\u0431\u043e\u043b 1 acestream ? 
  1st channel commentators are fucking killing me, 
  thank you, 
  russian taxes beat most big teams in europe . 
  can be done is separate wars . 
  but remember that there is this `` ca n't declare because already in war with emperor '' thing so you have to figure out a perfect alliance chain or beat the emperor several times . 
  i still have ptsd from sieging bohemia 4 times in a row because some opm jumped to friendly attitude and did n't join the war and bohemia added another elector when i was n't looking, 
  at mil tech 3 your combat width is 20 , so almost half of your army is n't doing anything , it 's 20k vs 19k . 
  stars on generals do n't say much , check how much pips they have in each category . 
  the most important at tech 3 is shock ( 2nd category ) . 
  would be nice if you uploaded a screenshot of the battle ( not results ) , it would be easier for us to help . 
  the only advice i can give - rebels would probably move so try to meet them in a defensive terrain, 
  press b to open macro builder , press 9 to go into estates tab , select clergy , click on a province to assign it to them . 
  try to give them land with high autonomy - it would give you more tax money, 
  let 's say you have 4 % ipa ( standard , no modifiers ) . 
  it means that when you take a 100 gold loan you will pay 4 gold every year as interest and when the loan runs out ( 5 years ) you either repay 100 gold or extend the loan for another 5 years of paying interest . 
  if you stack modifiers to get 0.25 % ipa you will only pay 0.25 gold per year or 0.0208 per month . 
  you can use that 100 ducats to build a temple and easily get 0.05 + ducats per month . 
  maximum amount of loans is determined by your income - when your interest per month is equal to your income you ca n't take anymore loans . 
  basically take loans , build mercs , take loans , build buildings to get more possible loans , take more loans , build more mercs , conquer the world, 
  come on anzhi , what the fuck is that pitch , it 's 15th of july, 
  do n't rub salt into our wounds mate :(, 
  started 2 weeks early this year to free some space in the end of the season - it 's supposed to help nt before the world cup , haha, 
  spartak should advance with an okay draw . 
  zenit seems to have a shot in el but it seems so every year and they have n't delivered since 2008, 
  guys have you seen that post on r/soccer that `` proved '' that corners are useless ? 
  yeah ... 
  that 's not how it works . 
  it is an additive modifier that applies to base dev cost ( 50 ) , so you are saving 5 mp per click . 
  based on your table in the best case scenario you save 32 * 5 = 160 mp when developing from 3 to 35 dev ( well , it 's not really best case because base cost developing from 3 to 35 is about 300 mp more expensive than from 16 but whatever ), 
  better than that , he was born in the city where the gun was made, 
  maximum six foreigners on the field simultaneously, 
  maybe they are trying to fill their new stadium ? 
  if they achieve good results and a couple of guys they signed become fan favourites they would get a ton of money from 40-50k tickets sold every match, 
  he said on stream that he does n't have time to edit videos, 
  there is usually club 's name in native language in the first line of it 's wikipedia page . 
  '' \u0424\u0443\u0442\u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043b\u0443\u0431 '' means football club so you should search \u0426\u0421\u041a\u0410 - \u0421\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043a, 
  goncharenko finally checked reddit, 
   plays centre forward for them mainly, 
  he does n't , he plays on the wing . 
  z\u00e9 lu\u00eds plays centre forward for them, 
  that 's unexpected . 
  there were talks about him , merkel and beck maybe 5 or 6 years ago but it stopped and now they suddenly call him up, 
  utrecht asked for it to not play at the same time as ajax , zenit and uefa did n't mind, 
  nice to see cheryshev fit , although no idea how he is going to fit into our 5 ( 3 ) at the back system, 
  has anyone seen rausch lately ? 
  is he good enough to start over schennikov in a serious game ? 
  the magnificent quality of konstantin rausch ? 
  lol, 
  yes , there are a lot but all the good ones would try to get into german team . 
  also some ( most ? ), 
  of them do n't have warm towards russia . 
  for example alexander zverev is # 7 in tennis ratings atm , his parents emigrated from russia and his dad said very early that his sons would only compete for germany, 
  how many zenit players ** will ** have featured in a world cup final ? 
  russia vs argentina 2018 , mark my words, 
  midfield was invisible , no build up . 
  all chances zenit had ( like 2-3 ) were long passes from defenders . 
  mammana-ivanovic pairing was very shaky . 
  only kokorin and lunev were good, 
  it 's their best line-up except poloz and maybe erokhin , no resting, 
  it was fixed, 
   which is the 8th highest european league, 
  yea . 
  well , they are actually 9th atm but they were 8th a year ago when the spots for this season were determined, 
  treated as 2 games but points are halved , so cska got 2 wins but only 2 points were awarded instead of 4, 
  imo the best ideas are religious , influence , admin . 
  religious because holy war cb is just too good in this position . 
  influence would help with liberty desire because of diplo rep , save you a ton of dip with the diplo annex cost reduction ( there is also a admin-infl policy for that ) , ae reduction is great . 
  +1 relations is also useful , especially if you steal norway and sweden from denmark using that `` transfer subject at half cost '' age ability . 
  admin because when you hit tech 10 you get a ton of new states from forming russia , coring all that with a discount feels very good . 
  driussi - kokorin - kuzyaev trio is on fucking fire this season . 
  reminds me of the good old petrzela days of arshavin - kerzhakov - bystrov in 2004-2005 , even positions are the same < 3, 
  he is pretty good . 
  check out his commentary of [ arshavin vs liverpool 4-4 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdxhb9jncoe ) and [ russia vs netherlands 3-1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgljxcatwua ), 
  it was attack on the goalkeeper in the goalkeeper box . 
  or whatever that small box is called in english, 
  we probably hang around in different communities , barely heard any hate on him, 
  young kokorin and smolov in cska would be a disaster . 
  1 angry criticizing shout from ignashevich and they would spend every night crying in a nightclub, 
  i guess i 'm behind a few years . 
  dunno , he is obviously far from the best but imo not shit too . 
  i would probably put at least 8-10 guys from the list behind him . 
  plus another 8 that i just do n't know , lol, 
   dzyuba is a centerpiece of the zenit offense, 
  not anymore , he does n't realy fit into mancini 's system . 
  you missed the biggest `` better form '' player - kokorin . 
  guy turned from a laughing stock into the scariest striker in the league with 6 goals + 3 assists in 8 rpl games and 3 goals in 4 europa league games and pushed dzyuba out of the squad, 
  4-4-1-1 with kokorin as an advanced striker and driussi as sort of a supportive striker is zenit 's most used line-up this sason, 
  there were some experiments in the first few games and he proved to be the best . 
  but he would probably be replaced by rigoni after the international break, 
  giving away free stuff boosts viewership , check out csgo numbers, 
  there is a `` prediction contest '' , you answer 7 questions , 1 correct answer give one 1 key + 1 chest ( or whatever it 's called in english client ) , 4-5 gives you 2 , 7 - 3 . if you watch the stream on a special page on the lolesports.ru you might get drops - red and blue `` buffs '' that boost your reward and give +1 to it . 
  there is another contest that is boosted by these buffs but i do n't know how it works . 
  oh , and getting 1 answer is guaranteed - one of the questions is `` how many nashors would die before 20:00 ? 
  '' , haha, 
  semis had this thing too .
