  no company will hire them because of future repercussions , so they 're fucked . 
  damn son, 
  so i can not complain about game ruiners ? 
  i put effort into every game , that 's why i am complaining . 
  cpy is waiting for dishonored 2 to fix its performance bugs and release more dlcs before spending time on cracking it . 
  i 'd say most pirates are from regions like russia and china , not from `` normal developed nations '' . 
  stop talking out of your ass , i live in eastern europe and here most people pirate because the pricing is not adjusted for the countries ' wages . 
  i always do that when i 'm not certain if a game is worth what it asks for . 
  if denuvo 's servers crash tomorrow , you can not play the game you paid anymore . 
  if you go offline for a while , you can not play the game you paid for anymore . 
  if you want to mod the game you paid for , you can not do that because denuvo stops any kind of tampering with the game 's executable . 
  i could go on and on , sometimes i 'm not sure if i 'm making an argument for people that actually care about others ' opinions , because if so far into this thread you have n't considered any negatives to denuvo then it is a lost cause to argue . 
  since mexican imports will be taxed with 35 % , they 'll pay for it indirectly . 
  native americans were conquered . 
  colonists did n't immigrate , they colonized . 
  is it so hard to understand ? 
  why buy when you can get them for free ?? 
  you just need a press account . 
  theft protection ? 
  are you fucking serious ? 
  good thing corporations have free reign to exploit people so you can feel good about `` helping them '' . 
  can confirm . 
  methylphenidate user . 
  as someone who has near 1000 games on steam i say go fuck yourself to any company that treats me like a criminal by buying the malware called `` denuvo '' as a `` copy theft protection '' . 
  i never bought any denuvo game and i never will . 
  fuck off , communist . 
  i have an i7 7700k , gtx 1060 , 16gb ddr4 3000mhz and a ssd , and online is totally unplayable . 
  loading screens over loading screens , having a 1000 mbps gpon connection does n't help with shit . 
  i 'm 1000/1000 and a lot of what should be my hits are basically hitting the air . 
  good job ubisoft !, 
  duck, 
  you preordered a game that you had issues with from the start ? 
  people like you are the reason they get to pull this anti consumer practice . 
  denuvo on suicide watch . 
  i have been here for almost 6 years , your account is only 2 years . 
  this place has become a desolate one , nothing happens anymore . 
  people with an agenda and astroturfers , with the help of the admins , have destroyed what was left of reddit . 
  i doubt that . 
  every 5 years , this year i get the s8, 
  ubisoft keeps fucking up their releases and you keep buying their games . 
  i have no sympathy for you people anymore . 
  that subreddit is full of idiots , i see one right here linking it . 
  you do n't know shit , my friend . 
  i 'm not skilled enough to have this luck, 
  you have a very narrow view on brazil 's issues . 
  glad i quit hearthstone 1 year ago . 
  it is proven that people with anime avatars and kpop fans have a statistically higher mmr on average than their peasant counterparts .

  i edited . 
  you bring shame to our kind, 
  thanks, 
  awful damage control . 
  enjoy being blacklisted !, 
  i should n't have to put this game as priority with a 7700k , gtx 1060 and 16gb ddr4 3000mhz . 
  i used to play it on steam on my 2500k before i refunded it and now there is n't much improvement still , so i uninstalled it . 
  with this setup it stays around 50-60 fps which is not normal . 
  considering that i paid a lot for my parts , yes i am complaining . 
  does it pay well ? 
  i hope it does because if not then you must be retarded . 
  you dayz sa fanboys are pathetic . 
  you have some mental issues , my friend . 
  i think it was a nightmare level in the manor . 
  is this an uphill battle ? 
  will denuvo stop being used eventually ? 
  it is actually a pretty shitty game , based on what we 've been showed so far . . 
  how long are you going to keep defending it in this thread ? 
  i hope you did n't preorder this crap , because that supports bad games . 
  i agree , look at what the gameplay director tweets towards white people . 
  he 's a despicable racist . 
  fuck you bitch, 
  this one lives up to the name of the subreddit . 
  it is available in japan .

  babyrage, 
  poor guy , sometimes he held these 2-3s pauses waiting for the crowd to clap, 
  stop spreading misconceptions , dota 2 is extremely profitable and valve does n't use it to `` pull players into the steam ecosystem '' . 
  most gamers these days on pc already have a steam account , why would valve pour so much money into dota 2 then ? 
  it 's as smooth as it can be on a 5 year old phone , a few crashes on google apps like calendar whose cause might be the fact that i keep wiping / system and / cache when i have rom installation errors .
