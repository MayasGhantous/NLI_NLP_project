  did n't know europe was a country . 
  way to degrade a justified response from the community , you must feel so superior right now . 
  leave him alone . 
  he 's truly passionate about the game and you want to take it away from him whlist also lying . 
  most of the time he rages he 's not in the team 's voice chat and when he truly rages at someone while being in team chat it 's because those people were clearly boosted and many stream snipe him to throw his games . 
  i 'm not a fan of his , but i hate trying to act as a justicar while destroying a passionate player 's career . 
  i 'd say it 's the pain that 's killing the people in the parent comment , get your reading comprehension up to check . 
  more like slovenian accent , the voice actress is n't russian . 
  yes if you know russian . 
  overbuff rankings do n't mean shit . 
  if you think this is a buff , you can prove it by instapicking dva every competitive match and see if you are still above gold in a week . 
  i 'm a dva main high master and she 's done as a hero , blizzard can not balance . 
  fuck i 'm old . 
  the hell is wrong with you ? 
  you were right , she is n't as bad now . 
  apparently i am top105 dva https://www.overbuff.com/players/pc/virtualghost-2508?mode=competitive so i like the changes after all .

  it seems dated . 
  does anyone want to play half life 2 cooperative through synergy ?

  i had sp today morning and i slept in my room , but in sp i was at the parent 's room.i saw that i am in bed and i could see some dark figures , also i could move weirdly , when i reached the edge of the bed i raised my head and there was a dark figure that was preparing to throw a hammer at my head and then i woke up in my room . 
  was it sp ? 
  also i noticed that you can actually move in a sp without being in obe , if you see that you can not move concentrate on moving and then you can move , but it is n't a high advantage , i mean you ca n't have a fight with the shadow people , i tried . 
  also i have sps once at 2 weeks, 
  how do you stream games ? 
  i tried xsplit or any other but when it is on fullscreen the screen turns black , also i have the free version at the moment . 
  if you know any better programs or know to optimize mine i would be grateful for your help . 
  i have prepared very much for these exams ( it 's called evaluarea nationala in romania ) and them are 2 tests , one for math and one for romanian.the max grade is 10 and i need to take at least 9,50 to both of them .

  what do you think , reddit ? 
  i find myself wanting to learn editing videos in adobe after effects cs6 or learning unity3d to develop games , but after i install the programs and watch a tutorial , my will is totally lost . 
  i can not even play skyrim or finishing a game 's story , and i feel like losing time . 
  do you have any solutions ? 
  i may not call it laziness since i want to work on something , but it 's similar . 
  i got lots of weapons back in time but stopped playing tf2 and gave all my items to a random person.can i win the items that i gave to that person again ?

  i ran superwipe to install android revolution hd and put it on the sdcard , now there is nothing anymore in the sdcard and i can not make android revolution hd to work . . i can not boot too , it stays on the sgs3 boot screen.help, 
  i woke up in my parents ' room one morning and asked my mother how i got in there , and my mother did n't believe that i did not remember anything that happened that night . 
  she told me that i came in their room at 5 am and grabbed some old chinese statues she had on the desk near the bed , and that i hid them somewhere , then i went on my father 's side of the bed and went to sleep , the whole time that happened my father was at the bathroom . 
  i do not remember anything from that night , i always thought that it was my first and only experience of sleep-walking . 
  the statues where never found . 
  this story is real and happened when i was 7 . 
  a lot of other creepy/interesting things have happened during that age . 
  i will post some others later . 
  if you got some please post them , since my childhood when i moved to the new house was really weird and want to find about other peoples ' stories . 
  i was checking out reddit on my phone for 5 mins after getting on a bench.since it was the only bench in that room she stayed next to me , then while i was looking at my phone i noticed she was looking at me for what i would call a long time , but i never did look back.then she went to the bathroom for like 15 minutes and she headed to a gate leading to the plane for a city in a neighboor country ( we speak the same language too ), 
  i feel like i missed an occasion , since she looked at me a long time and she was very beautiful.after i got in the plane heading to my city , the questions started to appear . 
  tl ; dr : there was a girl near me that was watching me for a long time and then we headed for different directions and i feel like i missed something . 
  today i lost a rottweiller.i was gone today at 1 pm and the gate did n't close correctly.my mother called me at 2 pm telling me the gate was not closed and told the neighbor to close it . 
  then she called me and told the dog ran away , so i went with the ones i was at and searched for the dog , i lowered the radius of searching very fast and found from the merchants out there on my street she was following a crazy woman.i found out how she looked and called the police , tomorrow at 9:30 am i have to be there , she is retarded mentally and was telling my dog to get to her and she put him in a dog leash . 
  i know her route everyday and will find her , what should i do when i find her ? 
  i 100 % will find her , but i am not sure of the dog . . i have him since 8 years ago . 
  one of my friends went to a different high school ( mine is number two on the city and the other is number one ), 
  i feel guilty that i did n't reach a good enough grade to go there too , but now i have to live with this . . 
  how can i keep contact with people that went on different roads ? 
  i should mention the highschools are pretty close to each other , but it 's not the same thing . 
  this goes basically for childhood friends too . 
  murika, 
  can anyone give me an advice about it ? 
  i have used www.codecademy.com to learn some java , but i do n't know if i will do something good out of it . 
  i request a programming language for starting game programming , some recomendded c # or c++ and a guide or something . . 
  i am very new to programming world . 
  i feel like that at night , i am even feared to go to the bathroom . 
  i do n't know why this happens only at night . . 
  i start to remember my deceased ones and if i try to sleep i feel that something is watching me and i turn off to see what that is instantly . 
  also , something common is that i hear voices i am not aware of while losing my consciousness and falling asleep . 
  i am affected by sleep paralysis if i try to take naps too .

  i need help with memory , i am tutored at math and i forget very easily , like i had a course last week and this morning i forgot everything i 've done in the last course.same with programming , i forget everything . . i started taking lecithin because it is popular in the country i live in , but it does not help me in any way so far . . whenever i find my brain to be slow i fall in a depression which gets out slowly , but i 'll get into it again if i try learning again .
