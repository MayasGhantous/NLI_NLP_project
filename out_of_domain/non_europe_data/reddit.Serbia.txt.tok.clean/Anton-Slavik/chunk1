   this constant build and rebuild approach meant massive issues in the development process . 
  features that were good enough to retain in one build had to be redesigned from scratch for the next because so many other interconnected parts had changed . 
  even when there was enough to play , internal testing revealed a confused and unfocused experience . 
   most of the sources spoken to for this piece identified the same problematic ccp manager , who had little vision for what the finished game would look like . 
   `` not once could he answer any question about moment-to-moment gameplay or areas of focus , '' says one source . 
  `` instead , he preferred to deliver buzzword-laden rambles ... it was not uncommon for him to communicate in onomatopoeia . 
   `` i once saw him looking over the shoulder of a programmer at some bit of user interface the poor guy had hacked together . 
  he straightened up , put fingers to lips and said , ` no , this is n't it at all . 
  make it more ... psssshhhh ' he hissed on his fucking fingertips , like the air coming out of a bicycle tire , and then just walked away . '',

   most refugees have state provided food and shelter available to them , but many refuse to get into the system and instead choose to wander around abandoned houses and factories , as well as loiter near state borders hoping there will be a good time to cross ( there wo n't ) . 
  do n't forget that they also break into vacant homes and either ramp up the electricity bill or chop up anything made of wood to make a bonfire .

   what motivation is there to keep going ? 
  you 'd get bored -- you 'd want to die . 
  that 's what the average person would be like . 
  delilah is anything but average . 
  or sane . 
  could you post your specs and what kind of settings you 're playing with ? 
  i 've got an average pc ( at best ) and playing the first mission ultra settings netted me around 30-40fps , but when i get to karnaca , actually steep foot in it , the framerate takes a huge dive and the game stutters a lot unless i put it on low or medium . 
   i do n't know about the relations between serbia and montenegro , all i know is they were one whole country until then or so years ago when they fell apart . 
  would be there any problem while we are crossing the border ? 
  we 're both serbs . 
  why would there be any problems ? 
   what is the general opinion about turks ?

  he fucked over serbs in the long run . 
  especially with the autonomy bullshit . 
  i do n't really see the appeal of the man . 
  i get that people might have had a stable job at the time being , social benefits and such , but all that vanished once he was gone , because he was basically a dictator that did n't give a shit about what would happen to a country after he was dead . 
   would you consider albania for your summer holidays ? 
  nope . 
  i just would n't be able to relax or feel comfortable when surrounded by albanians . 
   i 'm not sure why albania and serbia became such enemies when we had one common enemy ( turkey ) , and i wish that had not happened . 
  oe was a long time ago , whereas the issue of kosovo and metohija is very much relevant and present today . 
   what are your thoughts about the albanian-illyrian lineage ? 
  it 's become a meme at this point . 
   would you kill/stone us if we come is better question ? 
  what kind of question is that to begin with ? 
  disregarding our history with albanians , if you ask anyone `` would you kill me if i come to your place '' do you actually expect them to tell you that they would , if that was the truth ? 
  it 's in their own interest that they lie . 
   wow , already 33 minutes and not a single hate comment ,, 
  when you ask pretty safe questions , you ca n't really expect otherwise , can you ? 
   what did you guys first think about when you learned you were gon na do a ce with us ? 
  speaking for myself , that it was pointless and unnecessary .
