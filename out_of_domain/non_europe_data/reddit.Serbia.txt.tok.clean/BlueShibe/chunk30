  usually it can happen if another camera app is running on the background , try to check that . 
  it might be that it 's not well supported on cm13 , because cm nightlies always have something wrong with cameras . 
  maybe wait for some updates . 
  do you have xposed installed ? 
  sometimes when play store updates apps that xposed uses , it leads the phone to shutdown or restart . 
  especially when xstana gets an update . 
  happened to me lots of times . 
  i do n't think that the phone is different by continent , but you will just get the different charging socket based on your [ country ] ( http://www.worldstandards.eu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/electricity-tiles-type-h-200-px.jpg ) 's standards . 
  as long as it 's unlocked i think that you should be fine .

  it 's like the israeli version of kalvin klein . 
  i 'd just like to interject for a moment . 
  what you 're referring to as linux ,, 
  is in fact , gnu/linux , or as i 've recently taken to calling it , gnu plus linux . 
  linux is not an operating system unto itself , but rather another free component, 
  of a fully functioning gnu system made useful by the gnu corelibs , shell, 
  utilities and vital system components comprising a full os as defined by posix . 
  many computer users run a modified version of the gnu system every day ,, 
  without realizing it . 
  through a peculiar turn of events , the version of gnu, 
  which is widely used today is often called `` linux '' , and many of its users are, 
  not aware that it is basically the gnu system , developed by the gnu project . 
  there really is a linux , and these people are using it , but it is just a, 
  part of the system they use .
