  `` wtf xxahm3dxx if u shoot me another tiem i wil votekick you '',

  not such a worst experience , might be because of my body reactions . 
  dentist has put me anesthesia , but it did n't work , so she put another dose , still it did n't work , so the dentist said to come tomorrow . 
  after 40 minutes while eating pizza , the anesthesia finally started to kick in and went back to the dentist .
