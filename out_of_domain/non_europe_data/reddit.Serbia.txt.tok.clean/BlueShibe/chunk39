  well , if your pc becomes dusty like this for 4 months , then there must be some problem with your pc . 
  i built my pc 4 months ago and still looks new inside . 
  i have also a dust filter which prevents dust to not easily enter inside , maybe that 's why . 
  it 's google ultron . 
  that 's why . 
  yeah . 
  i started to hate almost all the indie games on steam ( excluding the good ones ) . 
  there 's millions of them . 
  yes . 
  ssb , super marios , mario kart , and many more best games that were n't on pc .
