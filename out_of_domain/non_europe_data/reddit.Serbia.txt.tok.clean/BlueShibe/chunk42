  try running a scan with ccleaner and malwarebytes and see if it will make a difference . 
  try cheking task manager on each computer you have and click `` network tab '' . 
  if you have got your wireless ssid without password , you must protect it . 
  maybe the monitor cable you were using at home is damaged , while in your office is fine . 
  were you using the same monitor cable ? 
  maybe the heaphone jack in your iphone se is damaged , or maybe you changed some audio settings in iphone options ... 
  have you tried it in other computer or in another usb port ? 
  that 's really weird , i 'm not sure but maybe something with power outlets or bad position of your pc ? 
  try maybe looking inside the headphone jack that there are some dust and maybe try spraying some compressed air inside ... 
  maybe your usb drive has the file system that the windows 7 installation does not support . 
  try changing it from fat32 to ntfs or vice versa . 
  you can do it by connecting your usb to a spare pc and go to my computer/this pc and right click on the usb and choose `` format '' and just change `` file system '' and nothing else ( it will delete all your files ) , the put the windows 7 installation again using rufus . 
  try deleting the ps4 hdd partitions with minitool partition wizard and create a single one by ntfs file system . 
  if there is only a single partition , the try to just format it . 
  yes , you can do it directly in rufus too . 
  are you sure that you are fully shutting down the pc and not just making it go to `` sleep/standby mode '' ? , because that can wake up the pc by any buttons ... 
  i had the same problem with my pc too after upgrading from windows 7 to windows 10 and i got it fixed by changing the graphic card . 
  you can try to re-install gpu/cpu drivers and see if it 'll work . 
  maybe there are processes that are causing problems . 
  check task manager and click cpu , memory and disk to make it descending order to see the processes that take a big load . 
  or maybe there is a malware that causes it . 
  try also to run a scan with malwarebytes . 
  which microsoft visual c++ version did you install because there are 32-bit and 64-bit versions and you maybe did n't notice during download . 
  if you did install the 64-bit version , try running cmd as administrator and type `` sfc / scannow '' to check pc if there are important missing files . 
  that seems likely a driver problem . 
  are you sure that the driver is the correct one for your graphic card ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  only by yourself and the isp . 
  have you tried maybe to remove driver in your laptop and to install directly from nvidia site ? 
  then the chances are that it might be a hardware problem since the gpu is giving the same problem even when formatting . 
  tried checking the laptop temperatures ? 
  might be windows 10 downloading updating itself , so maybe you can wait some time . 
  what is the process that takes most of the disk usage ( click disk in task manager to see in descending order ) ? 
  then it must be updates i think . 
  try going to settings  update & security  check for updates just in case . 
  maybe you can disable this kind of warning by going to monitor settings ( the right lower side of your monitor buttons ) .

  yeah turning on v-sync makes an unplayable input lag for me so i keep it off . 
  screen tearing hurts , but got ta be used to .

  it would be a shame that your boss can read your notes too ! '', 
  but still , it 's never good to run fast on the crosswalk or the driver wo n't notice you . 
  always better wait when there are no cars or if they stop to let you cross . 
  i just checked the task manager and the process `` store '' says 0 mbps . 
  there 's only one process that has just 0,1 mbps which is `` service host : local system ( 20 ) '' .
