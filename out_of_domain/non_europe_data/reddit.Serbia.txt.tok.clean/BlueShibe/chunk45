  assass ' crap, 
  i remember watching this video from like 13 years ago ... 
  did you downsample them or edited them with photoshop to remove the jaggies ? 
  they look very good . 
  all of them are edited with photoshop by adding a bit of vibrance and sharpness . 
  all of them are shot in 4k and resized in 1080p ( it 's a stupid thing to do i know , but it uploads faster on imgur :p ) . 
  probably too much pressure was holding the glass . 
  i nearly wanted to buy this before . 
  thank god i bought better parts . 
  ew no . 
  i built it .

  i survived that war and it was awful . 
  i just stream them on kodi with exodus addon . 
   downsy morpheus, 
  * plaque 1 : freedom . 
  the people never knew how to dream about you , like those who did n't knew for your return , paved the road with hearts, 
  * plaque 2 : serene rose , who grew on the edge of memories , do n't search in the grass , grown among the stars . 
  silent rose of memories , do n't shake [ could n't translate the rest because some letters are not visible ] ... 
  * plaque 3 : fourteen october of 1941 the german fascists in draginac , have shot 2050 patriots . 
  * plaque 4 : savage reprisals carried over you strengthened the resolve of our nation to resolutely to the end fighting for their freedom . 
  i 'm trying to translate others right now and i will update my comment when done .

  all of the photos are edited with photoshop cc where brightness , contrast and sharpness were edited . 
  also the dlc of the game was burial at sea - episode 2 which was a screenshot heaven . 
  on my tv , there was a registered call between a priest and a physician ( not sure ) where they discussed how to make statues to make them tear . 
  we had one in serbia too , but it got probably demolished and closed :(, 
  those doom heads tho, 
  there 's `` halo 5 : forge '' on windows store where you can play it online . 
  it supports controllers . 
  they might make it some day if it gets more successfull i think ... 
   if you really want to see ads , try again later .

  [ are you this guy ? 
  i completed like 50 % return to castle wolfenstein with the touchpad but then i stopped because i got sick of it ( of the touchpad , not the game ) . 
  if he did n't do like that and continued like before , he would n't get popular as much as now . 
  the youtube community apparently like combined videos with `` fun '' which does n't really fit . 
  but that 's something i think , not sure if it 's really like that ... 
  [ i made it to wallpaper , hope you like it [ 1080p ] ] ( https://i.imgur.com/weav7wt.jpg ), 
  i have the same razors . 
  i just hold on the side where you connect it . 
  it gets uncomfortable at first but you get used to it later . 
  oh my god, 
  ah i did n't see it . 
  time to turn up my monitor brightness . 
  resolution is 4k and it 's slightly edited with photoshop cc ( brightness , contrast and sharpness ) . 
  this is a such a beautiful hallway . 
  you feel it too , do n't you ? 
  the reason is simple . 
  i 'm unemployed . 
  `` snake !, 
  what 's your status ? 
  snake ? 
  snakeee !??? '', 
  or this toy is actually normal and the cat is a giant . 
  yes . 
  it 's a screenshot heaven .
