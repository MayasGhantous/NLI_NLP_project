  hey !,

  thanks !, 
  my photoshop skills are shitty but somehow i managed to make the cloudy background colors, 
  increase anti-alias and msaa to the max and screenshot it with super dof . 
  i play gmod since i was 14 . 
  i 'm 19 now .

  my most favorite game . 
  the ending is even more interesting and it uses this track !, 
  where precisely in serbia ? 
  there are cities that are ok and there are some cities that are not good . 
   this is why everyone hates serbia, 
  who ? 
  the ignorants who have seen serbia only on tv and war documentaries ? 
  serbian here , just because these football `` fans '' chanted racist words , does n't mean that the whole country of serbia is completely racist . 
  there are many good people who are not racist and more friendly . 
  we also hate these football fans as much as you all do , but please understand that not all serbians are like this . 
  says the ignorant who probably knows 1/4 of it . 
  the pieces of shit were only those fans . 
  not all of us are shit . 
  10/10 logic , alright kid . 
  i see you only know 1/4 of serbian and european history . 
  the ww1 would be started anyway even if gavrilo princip did n't kill the arch duke , also the ww2 how the hell did we start ? 
  books exist for a reason . 
  why ? 
  because of fear of getting racistly chanted on the street ? 
  do n't confuse serbians as hooligans because they are both different things to each other . 
  winner . 
  search for velosofy on youtube , they make some good templates of intros for vegas pro and after effects.they have a wide list of intro templates . 
  seems everything ok so far . 
  i discovered that you get more views on peoples interests . 
  i once made a video on how to repair a problem where garry 's mod wo n't start with detailed instructions and i got so many views ( about 1500 ) and comments for like 2 weeks and so on , but that was when gmod got screwed with an update and everyone was trying to search for a solution to that problem . 
  [ vomits inside ], 
  really makes you think . 
  this slow camera movement and those soldiers really gives the vibes of mgs5 trailer . 
  sometimes some skins will overwrite the current desktop layout so it 's always better to backup the current layout first .

  * turn off vsync ( unless you have freesync or other special thing ) so you do n't have input lag . 
  * do n't rush to enemy populated zones because you 'll die quickly there . 
  * play together with people in your squad or with your friends even better . 
  * turn off the motion blur so you can notice the enemies better or maybe lower it . 
  * play on servers with lowest ping possible that has players . 
  * try not to get very close to your enemy , killing him in the distance from like 50 metres will make the enemy hard to notice you . 
  i also paid 500 $ for a fiat palio , still going strong 5 years, 
  yeah but on dual boot with windows 10 too , because i do n't get a great performance with games on ubuntu . 
  similar story with a lawn mower . 
  my lawn mower was stolen by burglars while we were away , we called the police , they tried to find traces and such , but no response after a 3 days . 
  next week we decided to go to a street market and we actually found it !, 
  called the cops and they arrested the thieves . 
  the police after decided to give back our lawn mower . 
  why are you using ketchup ? 
  ketchup is not a thermally conductive compound and will burn your processor .
