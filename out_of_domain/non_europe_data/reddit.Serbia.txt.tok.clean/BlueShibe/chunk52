  the keyboard worked fine before i replaced the parts . 
  it also happened again when i upgraded to windows 10 , so i decided to replace the gpu and then it worked fine and now it happens again when i replaced gpu for the third time . 
  might be something with graphic card too . 
  i will try your suggestions . 
  got ta be honest , her eyes are nice . 
  the one with subtitles if funny too . 
  oh i got this too . 
  so i 'm not the only one that i fucking fell for it . 
  if resident evil 7 was based on some crazy weebs , it would look like this . 
  very nice , vr games became popular on steam so i hope it will do this too . 
  unless you want more guns , but still not wort it . 
  to ti je kao overwatch , samo sto je malo shitty .

  6 year old me would want to enter this mcdonalds so badly, 
  a minute of photoshop would fix that . 
  because we believe that vucic has stolen votes from the other candidates which is an unfair thing and also because we did n't want him as a president . 
  i 'm also using this keyboard . 
  did n't know that keyboard is so common, 
  this is why you should use a local account instead of microsoft account to login to pc . 
  does it mean that we ca n't also upload a gameplay of it on youtube ( i 'm a copyright illiterate sorry ) ? 
  client for the 3rd time for me , still trying . 
  btw why the menu is so intensive for my gpu ? 
  my radeon rx460 goes to 76c while waiting the queue ... 
  it may look like a high number , but it goes lower fast for me ... 
  i think it 's normal ( or not ) . 
  i 've waited 40 minutes to load for the first time , then it loaded fine . 
  yep , i 've got it 4 times and still trying to play . 
  they might release on steam too when game releases like they did with fallout shelter . 
  at least you have a job , i 'm unemployed : /, 
  i think it 's `` normal '' for some workplaces to be like that . 
  while the boss ( we hated him ) was away , we used to do whatever we wanted , no wonder why our company nearly collapsed . 
  i downloaded it fine without interruption for 1 hour . 
  restart the game and wait the queue again . 
  sucks , but it 's the only way ... 
  fake . 
  you did n't include the part where they call you cheater in chat ( / s but happens for me everytime  ), 
  yes . 
  unfortunately , i 've seen it happen on more maps . 
  it happens a lot unfortunately , especially in locker . 
  ah , did n't realize you were playing on a ps4 , thought you were playing on a pc .

  4 $ for a water ? 
  what kind of water is that ? 
  does it contain pieces of diamonds inside ? 
  i built my pc a few months ago without a dvd drive and i do n't regret it . 
  if i want to install drivers off a cd , i insert the dvd cd to my other pc that has a dvd drive , and create a network shortcut , so i can remotely access it from my dvdless build , or simply use the usb drive if internet connection does n't work . 
  my specs :, 
  * cpu : i3-6100 3.7 ghz, 
  * os : windows 10 pro, 
  already updated to the newest version 2 days ago . 
  i discovered that setting the options on max fixes the issue . 
  i 'll play on max settings then ... 
  60 fps average , 75 max and 40 minimum, 
  yeah it is , 
  i will try this option too thanks,

  you could make the one with fixed pixels version, 
  if you 've got a pc , you can download kodi and install navix addon and watch sports channels . 
  there are many of them there , you just have to find them . 
  saltiness exists on all popular games , used to get lots of hate messages on fifa 14 . 
  fortunately , the game does n't have the advanced salt levels the same as cs : go and battlefield 4 ... 
  the colorization is so good quality that i thought it was shot with modern day camera . 
  will the extra skin able to recover to its own or some kind of treatment is required ?
