  as others said , with pcs you can easily replace parts . 
  if you 've got used with ios , you can install hackintosh sierra which is a hacked ios to support custom build pcs , but you have to have the supported pc parts because hackintosh does n't support all the components . 
  if you want to play games , it 's recommended to go with windows 10 , can also be done with ios but the performance is n't so great . 
  the more you looks at it , the worse it gets ...

  so i was playing global offensive and my pc suddenly froze with a weird buzzing sound , then i had to long press the power button to turn off the pc . 
  then i tried to play csgo again and it froze again after playing for 10 min . 
  then i downloaded speedfan and it shows that my gpu is 80 c hot . 
  when i leave the pc idle for 10 minutes , the gpu temperature goes at ~ 70 c , but while browsing , the gpu temperature goes up to 90 c !, 
  i already changed the thermal paste a year ago , should i change it again ? 
  here 's my specs . 
  - cpu : i5-2500 3.30 ghz, 
  - gpu : nvidia geforce 405, 
  - os : windows 8.1, 
  the computer was scanned with malwarebytes , avast and cleaned with ccleaner . 
  mb and avast found nothing . 
  edit : i just cleaned out my pc with air compressor , now i need to wait how much up the temperature will go now !, 
  edit2 : problem is still here ... 
  i can hear that my fan is not spinning good . 
  i will check the fan now . 
  edit3 : i toggled my gpu 's little fan and sprayed it with wd-40 lubricant oil . 
  the fan spins better now and the temperature is low now !, 
  hello , so , after 30 minutes or after 1 hour , or more , there 's that `` system interrupts '' process that disables my keyboard and slows the pc too much , so we have to restart the pc .

  * hdd : 50gb, 
  suggestions are welcome . 
  hello , as the title says , how do i make c and d united to one partition ?

  sorry if the question has been already answered , i rarely visit this subreddit . 
  i have a problem in youtube app for android , when every video i watch , it freezes a bit and then the audio goes out of sync . 
  clearing the cache , closing the apps and downgrading to older youtube app does n't work . 
  it work only fine when device is restated , but the problem returns after a couple of hours . 
  device is prestigio multiphone 5504 , which is a chinese phone with mediatek , quad-core and 1gb of ram . 
  android version is kitkat , which is old and the phone 's company does n't plan ( or care ) to release a lollipop version of it ( asked them ) . 
  lots of search i did on google , and the solution was to switch to nuplayer , which is a feature that lollipop only devices have , while my phone does n't . 
  any suggestion on how to resolve this problem is appreciated . 
  so i want to factory reset windows 10 through settings . 
  there are two options which are : to keep files and to remove files . 
  i only want to delete everything from c , but not in d , because i made backups there .

  thanks .
