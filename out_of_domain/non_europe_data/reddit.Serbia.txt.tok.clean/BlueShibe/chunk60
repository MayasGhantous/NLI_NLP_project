  i remember that , when in main menu , there 's a guy with glasses ( ? ), 
  talking , and huge subtitles displaying , while raining in the backround ( ? ) . 
  sadly , i remember only the main menu and some gameplay , but i played it a lot .

  in [ status ] ( http://status.hirezstudios.com/ ) it says operational , but in the launcher it says down . 
  anyone else suffering this problem ? 
  so , i updated insurgency , launched the game , changed the resolution to 720p , then the game crashed and when i launch it every time , it crashed at the loading screen where it says new world interactive . 
  tl ; dr : updated game , resolution was 1080p , changed to 720p , crashed , and now it crashes at the loading screen at beginning . 
  edit : i got it working again by deleting autoexec.cfg !,

  so , i 'm looking to buy a good multiplayer game on pc , but not sure which . 
  fps preferably , i already own cs : go , insurgency , l4d2 , gmod , doom , civ 5 & 6 . 
  it does n't have to be just steam . 
  thanks . 
  edit : what about battlefield 4 ? 
  so , sometimes after i play some videogames , windows 10 becomes unresponsive , by saying unresponsive , i mean it does n't open programs , like chrome , task manager and when i try to turn off/restart/sign out , it goes into infinite loading , so i have press the reset button . 
  what could cause the problem ? 
  i have updated to the latest version , scanned with mbam , avast . 
  thanks . 
  specifications :, 
  i3-6100 3.7 ghz ,, 
  windows 10 pro ,, 
  so , battlefield 4 right now costs 19,99 euros and the price seems very good and cheap , but the thing is that the game is 3 years old ( soon to be 4 ) and i wonder that the multiplayer servers are full of high level only players which make the game hard ( battlefield 3 is in this situation ) . 
  i also like battlefield 1 even more , but costs a lot at the moment . 
  if you do n't recommend me this game , what should i buy instead ? 
  ( already tried squad and r6 siege , but i do n't like them for some reason . ), 
  hello , so i have this problem that happens only on insurgency . 
  after i click exit , the screen becomes black and nothing happens . 
  alt + tab , task manager , alt + f4 and windows button do n't help , so i have to turn it off by holding the power button long . 
  specs : i3-6100 3.7 ghz , rx460 , 8gb ram ddr4 2133 mhz , windows 10 pro . 
  any solution to that ? 
  thanks . 
  hi , are there some links , about intelligence ( like parazite ) or something like wikileaks which publishes some things that are forbidden for public if possible ? 
  thanks . 
  so i have this problem in battlefield 4 where mouse will costantly skip ( only mouse , keyboard controls are fine ) . 
  it happens on any map with both 32 and 64 players , so and i have to rejoin the server for the problem to disappear . 
  i tried to update mouse driver , gpu , unparking cores , switching to mantle which made no difference . 
  sorry if this has been asked more before me , here are my specs . 
  thanks . 
  so , what is the purpose of the created emblems in companion ? 
  when i equip an emblem created on companion , it does n't get equipped in-game , still shows the ones equipped from battlelog . 
  is it only for premium players ? 
  sorry for the somewhat stupid question , i got confused about this  . 
  i 'm new to this game btw . 
  when i turn on my pc from sleep mode ( not affecting hibernating mode ) a silver film grain effect at beginning is produced for 1 second and then it goes normal . 
  the problem was there also before the amd relive update . 
  i tried to re-install the driver with clean install option from the amd relive update installer , but the problem is still here . 
  i do n't know if that 's normal , but i do n't want to risk by ignoring it , i just worry that the problem will get worse and worse . 
  i bought this gpu and the other parts 2 months ago , so it 's not very old . 
  here 's the video . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h55lg5x-v9u&feature=youtu.be . 
  also the specifications . 
  * cpu : intel core i3-6100 3.7 ghz, 
  * os : windows 10 pro updated to the latest version, 
  * hdd : toshiba 1tb + 1tb western digital external hard drive . 
  i have a problem right now where windows store wo n't load a page ( halo forge ) and i receive error 0x80131505 . 
  any solution to this ? 
  i tried wsreset and troubleshooting thing , but no difference . 
  so , i 'm downloading halo 5 : forge and it downloads very very slow , every 10 minutes it downloads like 100mb . 
  it began to download fine , but then it slowed down to oblivion . 
  i tried wsreset , ccleaner cleaning , troubleshooting and pause and resuming the download for a second but nothing fixed it . 
  my internet is fast and fine . 
  any suggestions ? 
  edit : seems to be downloading normal now . 
  hello , i just installed halo 5 : forge and when i start the game , 2 windowed windows appear with logo `` halo '' for a second and disappear , without any errors . 
  also with halo app too . 
  apologizing if it has been asked before , but i did n't found the solution . 
  thanks . 
  system specifications .
