  how do i call for these and what do they do ? 
  does it help to have more people in the siege , assuming i 'm not going to assault ? 
  converted a save with an empire the size of the entire ck2 map . 
  lost some provinces ( which i think i have an idea of how to fix ) and got stupid generic national ideas . 
  how do i change them to serbian ideas ? 
  i understand that i may be mentally retarded for asking this question , but ... how the fuck do you fly a helicopter ? 
  i 'm pressing w and it just keeps going up up and not forward . 
  is there a way to disband multiple armies at once , without having them go into same province , merging and disbanding ? 
  having a ck2 save , i start up the game with about 800 ( k ) men all in different locations , and i do n't think i need that many . 
  i 've been really bored lately , and out of games to play . 
  decided to check out some good ole ' games . 
  this one kept popping up as `` being similar to fallout '' that i loved , and so i decided to play it . 
  before i invest myself in it , i would like to know :, 
  is it worth it playing as a mage ? 
  now , i read that `` you can skip almost all the battles with high enough int/wis/cha '' , but i am not interested in that . 
  i want to blow shit up with my spells . 
  and what 's getting me worried is that apparently this game uses dnd style rest spells , rather than the usual mana . 
  and that seems like it 'd be a pain in the ass . 
  is being a mage still viable ? 
  also , if i do decide to check out this game , i 'd like to be told `` early start tips '' is how i 'd describe it . 
  basically optimal stat composition at character creation , any good reward quests early on i may miss and stuff like that . 
  hello . 
  i got this game with the gameboy emulator and it 's pretty fun . 
  but i 've a few questions for anyone that played it :, 
  1 ) is there any point to visiting areas that have nobody in them ? 
  2 ) how do i view card details when in deck select mode/buying them ? 
  ( again , i 'm on pc ) . 
  3 ) do you have any starter decks that are good?like , really basic , with the cards you can buy at the very start ?

  hey . 
  friend recommended this to me . 
  i 'd like to know , if the game has actual choices ( think of stuff like fallout and planescape torment ) , or is it twd style ( well i guess i wo n't spoil it then , but you know what im talking about ) . 
  i started in 760 or whatever the start year was . 
  conquered the world about 1300 and just waiting for it to end . 
  but time passes by so insanely slow , like on speed 5 1 second is 1 day , and that 's if there 's no important events happening . 
  is there any way to speed this up ? 
  i 'm just waiting doing absolutely nothing . 
  does anyone have a seed with guardian angel ? 
  or a seed with a lot of quick money and the three skull dude ? 
  last 2 items i need . 
  ps : do n't worry about `` seeds do n't unlock achievements '' . 
  yeah , i put `` annihilating '' in the title because this wo n't be conquering . 
  it will literally be annihilation . 
  basically , i have a ck2 convert save with all of ck2 map . 
  what would , in your opinion , be the best way to conquer the shit out of everybody *** as quick as possible *** ?
