  pumping up the meshes to ultra removed the `` hair and beard '' shining , but the faces are still bright as fuck , solas 's head is shinier than the sun , and the blood looks as bright . 
  what settings would remove the shining ? 
  is there any way i can see the choices i made ** in inquisition ** . 
  last time i played was a year ago and i forgot how i settled the `` assassination of the empress '' quest . 
  i think i recall having to judge a box , but i 'm not 100 % sure . 
  edit : also does anyone know of a cheat to raise companion approval ? 
  i 'm generally on good terms with everyone ( except sera , kicked that bitch out of inquisition ) , but i do n't have dorian high enough to get his personal quest . 
  i 'd like to do it . 
  i heard there 's a save editor , maybe that can work ? 
  i was n't really a fan of her at start , because she has the annoying `` punch me '' face , and her jokes are n't funny at all . 
  i may have thought a bit better about her `` helping the little people '' but even that was n't enough to stop me from kicking her out the inquisition after her quest . 
  i mean , we walk up to a guy and she 's instantly all `` kill him '' . 
  not even question him first . 
  i would 've killed him anyway , but i wanted to see reasons . 
  it 's generally not a good idea to kill someone immediately ( see : the witcher 3 murderer quest , and you 'll know what i mean if you played it , and if you have n't it 's not really a spoiler ) , but she 's all `` nah just kill him '' . 
  i was already pissed off at this point , because she 's arguably the weakest member of the inquisition telling me the inquisitor what to do . 
  i ignore her of course , and as i continue asking questions she just shanks the fucker , blatantly ignoring orders . 
  if someone did that irl in an army , i 'm sure they would n't have a good time . 
  `` hey sir we just captured hitler 's right hand man that could give us incredible amounts of information , but i killed him cause he 's a bad man '' . 
  i had it with her , and she did n't even fell sorry afterwards . 
  even if i did n't kick her out for that , i never saw her being important . 
  she was just kind of ... there . 
  anyone figured out how to get the deep roads solas codex after they 're flooded ? 
  i 'm sure some guy that worked on the game said it 's possible even after they flood . 
  so i 'm playing a dwarven noble rogue in origins . 
  i 've never played a rogue before , only mages and warriors . 
  i got momentum and ever since getting it ... it seems useless to use any other skills . 
  if i let my guy just auto attack , he stabs with incredible speed , at no stamina loss . 
  if i actually use any of my damage abilities , he strikes way slower , and it seems that by using skills i actually lose dps . 
  anyone done some momentum calculations ? 
  should i literally just not be using skills at all if i want to maximize my dps ( utility ones aside ) ? 
  so my chat just randomly went ... small and not fixed to the right side , like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/k9buf3a.png ) . 
  i ca n't expand it , and before you ask , there 's no relevant options when i click on the `` gear '' icon . 
  only `` chat sounds , block settings , advanced settings ( which is basically only turn off chat for specific people ) , hide all chat tabs , hide groups , turn off chat , turn off video calls '' . 
  i want it to look like [ this ] ( http://www.breaksec.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/facebook-chat-xss.jpg ) ( rest of the image is irrelevant , this is the first i found on google with what i needed . 
  i want to start off by saying that no , i am not retarded ( at least i hope ) and i know there 's mugenmonkey . 
  the thing is , it only lists the `` royal soldier 's ring +2 '' which i 'm very unsure if i 'll get ( i 'm playing ng , first time ) . 
  and also , it lists the second dragon ring as giving +5 % to equipment load , whereas the wiki lists it at 10 % . 
  so i have a problem that a ) it does n't have the proper ring i have and b ) i 'm not sure of its ' validity . 
  anyway , i want to be sporting full havel 's , with a greatsword and havel 's greatshield ( only thing missing right now ) and fast roll ( below 70 % ) . 
  my vitality is at 50 ( inb4 noob build , this is pve only , i do not intend to pvp so it does n't matter ) , and equipping havel 's shield puts me at 74 % or so . 
  the total weight i wish to carry is 96.1 , with the third dragon ring and the royal soldier 's ring + ** 1 ** . 
  will my current 50 vit be enough when i get the third dragon 's ring ( i have second currently ) or how much more will i have to raise it ? 
  i 'd calculate it myself , but i 'm not sure how the percent increases are applied . 
  do they affect each other or do they increase base carry weight only ? 
  when i got to the shrine of winter/drangleic castle my soul memory was 1.6 million . 
  i was ~ lv140 . 
  i am now just about to go and collect all the giant souls , and am level 170 with about 2.6 million soul memory . 
  i read the `` recommended level '' for the end of the game is around 120 . 
  so i 'm wondering , how am i so high a level ? 
  i have never grinded , and i do n't think i died so much as to inflate my soul memory ( i 'm at 127 deaths at this moment ) . 
  i also do n't use the '' + to souls gained '' ring . 
  i am playing scholar of the first sin , did soul gains get increased in it ? 
  so i expect nl will probably do a ds3 playtrough , but will it finally be a blind one this time ? 
  i 'm sure i 'm not alone in wanting that . 
  he often complains about how he `` does n't want to do a 200 video long series '' , but excessive deaths can be edited out to keep it a bit more reasonable , i just want to see his reactions , and how he thinks about approaching new bosses . 
  is it just a way for multiplayer to still be somehow lore friendly ? 
  or is there a different reason for it . 
  can someone post basically everything that 's known about ds3 , ** mechanic ** wise . 
  i would n't like any plot spoiler ( a general overview is fine if necessary , but do n't go too much into detail ) , but i 'd like to know stuff such as `` will the `` lose hp as you die '' come back ? '', 
  and `` what 's the fast rolling cut off point ? 
  where would i find some sorcerer weapons ? 
  i have the fire longsword from the forest of giants . 
  i heard mlgs is nerfed and bad now . 
  is it worth getting ? 
  any other good ones ? 
  is there a way to set it so my main character always loots stuff ? 
  while everyone is selected that is . 
  oh also : when i try to sell something from stash , then click it back ( to not sell it ) it just disappears . 
  am i being stupid or ? 
  i thought for the longest while i encountered a bug at the start when my weapon disappeared . 
  i 've kinda run out of games to play lately , so i thought i 'd fire up fallout and try a new character . 
  i remember how much fun i had playing different characters in new vegas , from a cynical sarcastic sniper , to the goody two shoes pacifist guy , and the last character i had played : the crazy , evil cannibal that punched everyone to death and ate them all , even if it was n't necessary . 
  so i was excited to try the `` cannibal '' character in f4 . 
  ... and then i realized how...same-y it is . 
  there are very few choices in the quests , the melee gameplay was still pretty clunky , and let 's not even mention the ending , which i was pretty disappointed by even the first time . 
  so , between the new dialogue choices ( i do n't mind the wheel so much , i mind the fact it 's all the same , if it were always 4 choices that differed in something other than `` character responds to you differently then continues the same whether you said yes or no '' , sarcastic and `` the silver shroud '' options were great ) , the disappointing ending , how you can ultimately become the best at everything so the character you created does n't matter , stats not mattering too much ( see luck from new vegas , it was amazing how it affected gambling ) and the `` railroaded into being a caring dad '' story , anyone else disappointed with fallout 4 ? 
  i hope obsidian does fallout : x again . 
  new vegas was great . 
  how exactly do we get to the dlc areas ? 
  is it a teleport ? 
  is it some kind of memory ? 
  old iron king dlc should be in the same place as the iron keep if i understand correctly . 
  why is it so different ? 
  are we in the past ? 
  [ removed ], 
  anyone knows how many invincibility frames each roll provides ? 
  and whether playing at 60 fps makes it so you get twice as little invincibility rolls ? 
  i 've been trying to get ds1 to run on an ancient pc in school . 
  like , at the lowest possible default resolution i get 0.5 fps . 
  so i tried to set the resolution to something like 360x200 ( or possibly even lower , really do n't care too much as long as what 's on the screen is understandable ) but it always crashes whenever a custom resolution is set . 
  the computer also has windows xp installed on it . 
  can someone explain why that is ? 
  i followed all the instructions , setting that other `` render '' resolution or whatever it is , to 1280x900 ( or something like that ) but it still crashes . 
  note : obviously using dsfix . 
  hi , i 'm new , about 1 or 2 hours in , and have unlocked like 6 characters or something . 
  tried them all , and like crystal the most . 
  so what characters do you consider the best ? 
  i assume crystal is like `` maggy '' from binding of isaac , and is secretly terrible . 
  so far i think eyes is the most useless one .
