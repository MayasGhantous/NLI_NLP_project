  i do n't exactly ** need ** them now that i 've beaten her , but i 'd like to know if there was an easier way . 
  i used the northern armor , lloyd 's rings , fire resist ring , and chloranthy ring . 
  it let me survive 1 hit from most of her attacks . 
  also used carthus rouge . 
  ... survive ? 
  i 'm talking about siegward of course . 
  my first playtrough , he just absolutely destroyed yhorm , i did n't even pick up the storm ruler . 
  the fellow soloed him . 
  ever since then i keep trying to have him survive the fight , this time using the storm ruler as well , and not once have i succeeded . 
  any tips to have him live ? 
  would you still consider it a `` worthy '' sl1 run if you save scummed ? 
  i was very very very close to doing it for fucking oceiros and his bullshit no telegraph one hit kill charge . 
  the run up to him was so annoying . 
  to clarify : by save scumming i mean something like copying the save file in front of the boss wall , and then going back to it every time you die . 
  i think i 'll go fucking ~ ~ crazy ~ ~ hollow trying to beat this guy . 
  i 'm at about 75 attempts , got to p2 like 10-15 times . 
  the curved sword fucks me , and the spear i wo n't even mention cause ... man ... 
  straight sword seems pretty fair , and mage phase is by far the easiest . 
  any tips ? 
  edit : [ i think i 'll kill myself . 
  edit2 : [ thank you god . 
  edit3 : [ holy shit i just beat nk first try .

  [ for example this weapon . 
  ] ( http://saltandsanctuary.wiki.fextralife.com/tachi ) says it 's special is a fast hitter . 
  is it something like ds3 with weapon arts , and i just have n't been able to figure out how to trigger them yet ? 
  i remember reading a book a rather long time ago ( close to 10 years ) about a boy that discovers a `` hole '' or something , then proceeds to dig it throughout the book , eventually finding that it leads to an ancient city buried deep underground . 
  the first book ends about there and i am fairly certain there is a sequel . 
  i do n't remember almost any details , but i believe that the boy also had a very good friend , and i believe his father may have had something to do with the whole thing . 
  anyone has any tips for me ? 
  what weapon to use/which infusion ? 
  heard the reinforced club was good , but +15 or fire/lightning ? 
  other tips in general ?

  [ the tune in question . 
  ] ( http://vocaroo.com/i/s1vew2daouqn ) i 'd like to know the name/what game it 's from ( because i 'm 100 % sure it 's a game ) . 
  playing on the pc . 
  whenever i go through the chasm of the abyss ( manus area ) , i have 15 fps max . 
  whenever seath does the crystal attack , my fps goes down to like 1 or 2 . 
  this happened to anyone ? 
  any fixes ? 
  rest of the game can easily handle 60 fps . 
  how should i split int and faith ? 
  i assume that 's kind of the `` soft '' cap , but is there a point to raising them further ? 
  like 40/40 ? 
  also , any good weapon recommendations ? 
  should i infuse them with fire and use flame weapon , or dark and use dark weapon ( so i have something for fire resistant enemies ) ? 
  wan na do a sl1 run , so i need any damage i can get . 
  also , what pyromancy do you consider to give the most bang for your buck ? 
  i have 2 slots , and want to make the most out of them . 
  do n't focus on the burst , rather the overall total damage i 'd get with each one . 
  could someone explain how to actually do this ? 
  as in , do n't just give me a link to something that 's `` install this and poise works '' , i 'm curious in the process itself ( changing that value from 0 to 1 or whatever ) . 
  so i 'm curious . 
  the way to differentiate between regular and `` ascended '' pyromancy flame in ds1 , was that the ascended version had a larger flame in the icon . 
  come ds2 , the dark pyromancy flame looks the same . 
  so , was quelana 's `` ascended '' flame , just a dark version of the regular one ? 
  [ according to this , ] ( http://darksouls2.wikidot.com/moonlight-greatsword ) going enchanted gives me 380 physical damage , and a scaling , while magic would give me 304 magic and s scaling . 
  seems like a pretty clear win for enchanted , except if i was to buff it with crystal magic weapon , in which case i 'd get 354 magic , + s scaling , +30 % more on top of that , which would be 460 before scaling . 
  which one do you think is more worth it ?

  so i like to pvp , and until recently i always ignored any buffs because i 'm a real man that only uses a weapon . 
  then i completed a sl1 playtrough and realized how fucking awesome buffs are . 
  so what buffs would be good for pvp , while requiring next to none investment in magic stats ? 
  carthus flame arc perhaps ? 
  i know i could use resins but i do n't like using consumables , so limit this to actual spells . 
  i 've done 6 playtroughs until now , and this is my 7th . 
  i have , until now , never had a problem with siegward 's quest . 
  i always gave the armor to him , lit the distant manor bonfire , but did n't go further , and he was always waiting for me in the kitchen area . 
  this time however , he did not . 
  literally the only thing i did differently this time compared to the other playtroughs , is that i actually met patches at the cathedral , and instantly killed him ( without triggering the part where he drops me down ) . 
  i actually had to google to find him . 
  all the other times , i had killed him after he traps you in firelink shrine . 
  it seems odd that simply killing him at the cathedral , totally breaks siegward 's quest , and by extension greirat 's . 
  has anyone experienced oddities like this ? 
  anyone looked at the code or whatever to check why siegward would n't show up in the kitchen ?

  i finished a game where at the start i got like 5-6 ancient ruins , all giving me culture or faith , and managed to do a whole lot of missions for 4 city states , which were 2 culture , 1 faith , 1 food . 
  i was allied to them basically the entire game , and the early ruins meant i had my religion up and running before some civs even got a pantheon . 
  now , in another game , half the ruins i found just gave me shitty `` map overview '' and all 3 city states around me are `` hostile '' so i ca n't keep them as allies . 
  my faith generation is just fucked basically , like 3 or 4 civs already `` improved '' their religion , and i need like 50 more faith to do so . 
  basically , how important is getting good ruins/city states ?

  i 'm confused . 
  what are the advantages of making a 1x light tank division 9 times , versus 9x light tank just once ? 
  which is better ? 
  any general guide to making divisions ? 
  it being my first game and all , i started on the easy difficulty . 
  all it said it did was `` less research time , and something else i ca n't remember right now '' . 
  nothing about army strength . 
  so , i 'm playing as yugoslavia . 
  i go full communist ( 100 % ) . 
  i join russia 's commie party . 
  russia and germany sign a non-aggression pact . 
  germany attacks poland , and that brings italy and the other axis in as well .
