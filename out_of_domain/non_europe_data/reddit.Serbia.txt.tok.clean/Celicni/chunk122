  i got the one that was released initially , where would i go about getting the `` updated '' version ? 
  and does it fix isaac 's awakening and bethany unlocks ? 
  i just finished the challenge , yet it 's not crossed out on the list . 
  i killed the witness , or was something else the goal ? 
  [ removed ], 
  anyone has a link to the eternal update of the original binding of isaac , not rebirth/afterbirth ? 
  what 's the consensus ? 
  should i try to get them as soon as possible ( they 're extra consumables ) or try to avoid them ( they replace regular spirit hearts ) ? 
  i had a pretty shit run , but i had the pony since the first floor , leech ( mvp item ) and ludo ( with mouse controls ) . 
  i had only 1 damage upgrade , but turns out when you need to not get hit ludo + hiding over a rock is great . 
  is there a way to do this as of now ? 
  for ab + specifically , for the dedication achievement . 
  eucharist and delirious are what i 'm missing for ab + 's version of 1001 % . 
  what 's the best way to go about obtaining them ? 
  can i make peace with everyone ( to get the defender perk ) , and then destroy acadia and the nucleus ? 
  i obtained the dream nail , and am kinda wondering where to go next . 
  i do n't seem to be able to find a way to the dreamer icon on the map in the city of tears . 
  i remember a path in fog canyon blocked by some dark gates , and i got the dark spell upgrade but it does n't remove them either . 
  i have the crystal heart or whatever is the thing that lets you dash a whole lot . 
  just read a comment on nl 's video how you should never take the wafer as the keeper because it does basically nothing , but reduces your invincibility to half heart damage , instead of full heart damage invincibility . 
  i 've played this game for actually a pretty long time and this is the first time i 'm hearing about this ( this being that there 's a difference in invincibility when you get hit for half a heart vs full heart ) . 
  is this true or not ? 
  i usually spend approximately an hour and a half at the gym , and i heard that 's bad because after 45 minutes your body starts using up muscle or something . 
  the thing is , let 's say i do chest/biceps split . 
  i do 5 exercises each , 3 sets 8-12 reps. let 's say a set is a minute and i rest for a minute ( i usually rest a bit more though ) , that 's 6 min per exercise + warmup time + waiting for a spot = i end up at 45 minutes just from working chest . 
  how do i manage to fit in biceps as well . 
  do i just never rest at all ? 
  if this is n't the right place to ask this i apologize , but it 's not exactly homework . 
  i 'm just curious what the odds of winning a certain game would be . 
  basically , let 's say there 's numbers going from 1 to 36 . 
  you pick 8 numbers . 
  after that , 20 are randomly selected . 
  what are the odds all 8 of your numbers will be in those 20 selected ones ? 
  the ace of cards , while not being bad by themselves , are rarely that useful . 
  i almost never seem to find a good situation to use them . 
  but that does n't make unlocking them that bad . 
  no , the problem is that they have the same background as the much more valuable `` two of '' and `` joker '' cards . 
  in afterbirth , if i saw a red card in the shop , i 'd almost always buy it first because there 'd be a pretty good chance it 'd be a two of diamonds or joker . 
  in ab + , i just quit buying them altogether because they 're almost always `` ace of '' cards . 
  anyone else feel you 'd actually be better off not unlocking the `` ace of '' cards ? 
  so i have a somewhat mild version of pectus excavatum , and it looks really fucking ugly because i have a moderately big chest otherwise , and then there 's a gaping hole in the middle between the two pecs . 
  what is the best way to get some mass in the middle where the hole is ? 
  [ in this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns-s-s0yph0 ) i see the objects you can collect for your inventory flashing , yet in my game they do no such thing . 
  how do i turn this on ? 
  i updated facebook messenger for the first time since downloading it ( been almost 2 years ) so i could have the `` reactions '' and group video chat . 
  aside the fact the whole `` my day '' stuff is absolutely terrible , i can not send pictures directly from messenger . 
  the app either goes back to the conversation without sending anything or even closes completely . 
  i can send pictures from gallery . 
  anyone knows how to fix this ? 
  there 's so many skills i want to obtain , yet they all cost so much . 
  i am at the part where i first enter the crew 's quarters , and i fabricated at least 30 neuromods ( and found like 30 more ) . 
  am i wasting my materials on neuromods ? 
  will there be enough in the game and i should craft ammo instead ? 
  just wondering if there 's a pickups highlighter someone made . 
  i know they glow , but i 'd prefer them to just be a different color altogether . 
  i spent the entire first playtrough in dark vision just scrounging up items , and i 'd like to not do that . 
  i move fast so i usually miss a lot of items . 
  ... duke of serkonos ? 
  i did an absolute butcher playtrough ( like 95 % overall kill ratio ) , and if i save emily all i get is carnaca in chaos . 
  i thought you could rule as corvo the bloody duke if you kill the duke , body double and both paolo and the vice overseer . 
  i know there 's been a ton of these threads , but they were mostly back when the game was just released . 
  now , like 8 months later , which character do you prefer for ghost/clean hands ? 
  i was , and will always be , a corvo fan , but i ca n't help but feel emily wins out on this one . 
  she can pick up the tricky to get runes ( think the rune/bonecharm combo near the overseer building in mission 2 , or the rune on the wall in mission 3 where there 's like 4 guards and 3 cooks ) without any issues while corvo would have to knock out many guards to get it . 
  and domino is just incredibly useful , especially for someone like me that never uses anything but blink/dark vision because `` i do n't wan na waste mana '' . 
  like sure , it uses up , but only a little bit . 
  sure corvo 's got bend time , but it takes a while to get to it , and you 'll probably go for blink and agility first , meaning you wo n't have it until like mission 5 . 
  i 'm planning to start again after a long time , as a mage . 
  what are the best mod ( s ) in your opinion , for that ? 
  i 'm not just asking for mods that add new magic spells , i know there 's tons of those such as apocalypse ( though feel free to recommend some good ones , such as the one i found recently that i love that adds dishonored spells into skyrim ) . 
  and i of course intend to get immersive college of winterhold . 
  no , i 'm asking more about ones that make magic `` balanced '' . 
  so at level 100 destruction it 's not just `` hold button down for no mana cost because of enchanting , but take a hundred years to kill things because magic damage does n't scale nearly as well as smithing a 700 damage weapon '' . 
  i downloaded skyre and following the mod author 's instructions i also downloaded the `` reproccer '' . 
  but when i run it , it stops at like 25 % and says `` cutting room floor is missing master `` unofficial legendary patch '' '' . 
  the thing is , i have the patch downloaded . 
  also , do i even need to run this ? 
  i do n't have any mods that add weapons/armor . 
  i do intend to install falskaar at some point and then i assume i 'll have to run it . 
  [ removed ], 
  i am on a 49 eden streak , and am looking forward to the jubilee 50th win ... so of course i start with yum heart , black bean , ** 2.59 damage ** and ** 16 tears ** . 
  it took me 6 minutes to leave the first floor , 2 of which was spent on the boss ( steven ) . 
  if it had been champion rag-man i think that would have been it right there . 
  the second floor does n't go any better , and of course i take red heart damage because seriously 2.5 damage and 16 tears . 
  also , all tinted rocks paid out with golden chests . 
  i am on the caves 1 13 minutes in , and was stuck in a 4 globin room for about 2 minutes because i could n't kill the dead ones because the live ones would run in front of the shots . 
  but then there 's a light from the sky in the form of a re-roll item room . 
  i reroll some random crappy item into ... dun dun dun ... lazarus ' rags . 
  crappy item right ? 
  except oh wait it 'll lower my tear delay by 6 and increase my damage by like 1.5 when i respawn , as well as give me ** permanent anemic !!!, 
  ** imagine how bad a man must feel to be happy with anemic . 
  it brought a tear to my eye . 
  i 'll let you imagine how the rest of the run went . 
  when i summon a bound longbow , and then switch to a spell or something , because it 's a two handed weapon it just `` disappears '' , but the `` effect '' is still there . 
  so i have to recast the bound longbow to get it again , but when the original one ( one that no longer exists ) expires , the one i currently have does as well . 
  it could be avoided if i do n't switch to a spell immediately and instead first sheath the bow ... except it does n't disappear when i sheath it . 
  anyone know what 's going on/how to fix it/is it a skyre issue ? 
  i do n't have any mods that affect weapons ( except bound weapons fix for skyre ) . 
  how do i do something else while there 's a program that `` takes over '' ? 
  i am probably not explaining myself well , so here 's an example .
