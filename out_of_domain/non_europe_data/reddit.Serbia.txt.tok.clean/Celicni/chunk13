  literally all of them are less than ( or over depending on how you look at it ) -200 , and not planning to come down anytime soon . 
  and all of them are allied with one another ( not all of them , but coalition member 1 is allied with 3 , coalition member 2 is allied with 4 and so on ) . 
   ally france , austria , etc, 
  those poor bastards have died a long long time ago . 
  this is about 15 asian countries , which i could of course beat , but i 'd rather not if you know what i mean . 
  if you 're not above cheating , you can use the alt-f4 exploit for the lost . 
  get your rpg , and if you have to prove it to yourself that you can beat it , you 'll be able to even after getting the achievements . 
  something weird 's happening in my game then , i 'm not getting the `` expands my colonial range as if i owned their provinces '' because i ca n't colonize california as it 's `` too far away '' yet i have a colonial nation like 4 provinces away from it . 
  that might have been it . 
  if this has n't been solved by deleting hidden files and folders , here 's a thing that worked for me when i had the exact same problem :, 
  change how much the `` windows system restore '' thing uses . 
  for me it was at 50 % , so using a shitload of gb . 
  when i brought it down to 1 % , it got me like 60 gb back . 
  if you do n't know how to do that , say so . 
  well , probably , but the thing is that it worked for like 2 months as i said , and now it suddenly wants those permissions . 
  really weird . 
  that 's the last option if nothing else works . 
  of their dead parents . 
  eating with their fucking mouth open . 
  the noises and the occasional spit that gets out in some cases is not nice . 
  the serbian movie . 
  yeah , other programs too , and i do n't know what they are since i ca n't read their names . 
  unicorn stump if orbitals . 
  blank card if jera/perthro ( basically less charge time ) . 
  undefined if chest . 
  tammy 's head if brimstone . 
  10/10 , best , but not the strongest item in the game . 
  mk and epic fetus deal more damage , but come on , you 're spewing a fucking lazor of death at everything on the screen . 
  thanks , that was really helpful ( and to all the other people ) , but i guess nobody knows about the stuttering : /, 
  graphically . 
  possibly have it be guaranteed instead of a chance . 
  nope , i 'm very pedantic about that . 
  i do n't either , but that 's what i thought the op meant . 
  you sound like you 've got a bad sense of humor . 
  you shit on each other for stuff you know wo n't hurt them ( assuming they have a sense of humor ) . 
  it 's not like if someone fails to enter college by 1 point you 'll just laugh and say `` well off to mcdonalds for you '' . 
  you shit on him when he trips and falls or whatever . 
  ideal white , just pumps me up whenever i hear it . 
  i think it 's more the whole `` rin giving her magic crest '' thing . 
  not saying the dude is right , but what you said is said in both a dumb and a very condescending way , aside from probably being incorrect . 
  fate was n't big back then , they had to make it sell somehow . 
  step 1 : convert ck2 game . 
  seriously though , here 's something that worked kinda ok for me : [ germany in the balkans . 
  ] ( http://www.eu4wiki.com/serbia#strategy ), 
  used to be able to . 
  now it does n't work ( or at least a new way has n't been found ) . 
  i know it does . 
  and if i ca n't add it , is there just a way to edit the range on daud 's spell ? 
  so i can see them all at once ? 
  heh , it 's fallout . 
  if it was a 2d isometric game i 'd still play it . 
  graphics do n't matter nearly as much as good story/gameplay . 
  dude i played so much wow , when i was walking down the street i kept thinking `` now i 'll press 1 ( which was my judgement bind ) so that i can run faster '' . 
  obviously that required another person to be somewhat in front of me and me to actually think about using judgement on them . 
  as long as i can actually understand what 's happening on the screen , it does n't matter . 
  which is why i could n't play dwarf fortress ( because i literally could not understand what the fuck was what ) but i 'll gladly play f1/2/tactics any day . 
  nl sucks at the theory crafting stuff . 
  he 's clueless about items/interactions . 
  but boy the man sure knows how to dodge . 
  i 'm way better than him as far as knowledge of isaac goes , but i 'd say he 's at least twice as good overall . 
  the little haunts are the problem with the haunt . 
  haunt        single adversary . 
  and bloat is easy if there 's no rocks . 
  same name i see . 
  i think you ca n't help but have [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqoa_wjme9w ) be it . 
  i think the imgur thing may have been a bit overboard ( the sidebar part with the admins ) but i see no reason for / r/fatpeoplehate to have been banned , and some other shit ( as mentioned tons of times / r/cutefemalecorpses ) to stay . 
  please make this a thing . 
  yo man , i 'll just message you here because i do n't know if you 'll see the youtube comment , but blood bag [ is a speed up . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/bindingofisaac/comments/35e1j5/psablood_bag_has_hidden_speed_up_effect_rebirth/ ), 
  those were individual dumbasses . 
  if you sometimes checked out / r/fatpeoplehate you 'd see that there were some pretty good rules about `` keeping it in the sub '' as you said . 
  hm ... is the last part ( delilah = emily ) confirmed ? 
  well , if she did get possessed , why is she all cute if you play low chaos ( if we assume daud was high chaos ) ? 
  i just think a girl sees her daddy figure has no issues killing people , and so adopts that mentality . 
  if you understand that it 's a joke post , why bother saying this ? 
  i think nobody in their right mind would watch nl for perfect highly optimized min-max playstyle . 
  it never bothered me much to be honest . 
  i get the offhand remark ( you can see it through my clothes even ) but i do n't pay any attention . 
  i go to the pool/the beach . 
  i just say `` it does n't matter '' . 
  people can stare , i just do n't care . 
  it sucks of course , but i ca n't just let it limit my life . 
  having played it today , here 's how i decide to see it :, 
  there is no way that is emily even in the high chaos , just because of the way she dies . 
  she pushes the blade deeper and then scratches the shit out of daud . 
  emily would n't do that . 
  we must be completely opposite . 
  for me , not knowing what shit does and fucking yourself over ruins the game . 
  it 's fun to know what everything does immediately and make optimal plays . 
  that 's why i watch nl , for the fuckups . 
  if ** i ** am playing , i ca n't stand a single thing not being optimal . 
  dayum , i did n't even remember to look there . 
  thanks . 
  this practically doubled my trade income ( though it 's still shit ) . 
  thanks . 
  dishonored 2 ? 
  outsider appears mid-fall . 
  gives emily blink . 
  dishonored 2 emily vs corvo confirmed . 
  well there was pendleton saying that `` everyone knows you were screwing the empress '' in the high chaos ending .
