  anyone else wanted to strangle vechs when he started wasting the pistol ammo ? 
  heh , whenever i played half life , i killed the first dude you encounter for his gun ... does that make me a terrible person ? 
  for justice !, 
  why did you type that ... now i 'm crying like a baby . 
  and i have n't even watched almost any of rob 's videos apart from gmod , but ... just look at guude 's eyes ... so happy . 
  and then i think about this situation ... 
  you 're just being a dick for no reason dude . 
  different stuff affects different people . 
  i could n't drop a tear when my grandpa died and i 'm crying right now . 
  indeed there 's a picture of someone very likely to be etho online . 
  fits the profile and everything . 
  not gon na link it though . 
  well i 'd like to confirm the 3rd one has been answered , i was watching on my health leveling up , and got 8 more max . 
  since i have lifegiver , that 's only 4 , and i should get way more than that with end 10 . 
  i mentioned i reloaded about a thousand times . 
  seems like what was happening to me earlier , but this was different . 
  the game literally locks up , and i ca n't even do anything in task manager ( and you know you 're fucked when that happens ) . 
  except that 2s time span during which everything is possible . 
  and during combat . 
  and i 'm not playing the steam version . 
  i got the trilogy off of gog , and i play with the high res ... patch ? ... high res thingamajig because before that i had really fucked up screen being all purple . 
  i also mentioned it got fixed after i left the 2 maps ( which took a really long ass fucking time with all the freezes ) but i wan na know how/why it happened and if there 's a fix ( because i still have n't repaired the damn purifier at the mines and that 's a decent amount of xp and a combat shotty ) . 
  maybe the one about him and his brother entering each other ? 
  not sure . 
  very unrelated , but can someone link me to that `` incident '' ? 
  better criticals gives me 20 on the dice roll for crit , correct ? 
  and since i have 100 % crit chance , and i always aim for the eyes , according to [ this ] ( http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/critical_hit ) i will always ignore armor ? 
  so finesse is just useless , not negative now ? 
  just a question : what vid is this from ? 
  because i have a feeling it 's the one from like a week ago that etho uploaded , but i know he cut some of the parts out , so wondering if it 's the same thing . 
  armor and c4 . 
  pick people off 1 by 1 with the shotty ( does n't really work that well in an actual server but would work for the mindcrackers who generally do n't do a good detective job ) and in case there 's a lot of people in a location place the c4 . 
  why i sure love answers like yours that help me in no way at all . 
  the thing is i ca n't move the camera around for some reason , it 's just stuck on my character , and moves with him . 
  i am playing on the pc , and i am referring to the tactical view camera being unable to move . 
  no mods . 
  for some reason i started crying from laughter when he said that `` it was a ** steal ** of a deal '' . 
  i am appalled at the amount of people that shot kenny ... i stick with him all the way to the end and it was so worth it . 
  in the end i chose to leave with him . 
  i knew it was the wrong choice for clem , but dude 's been through so much , he does n't deserve to lose another `` kid '' as he apparently views clem and aj . 
  like some dude said below , i wanted so bad to just shoot the fucker . 
  i pulled the gun out immediately ... 
  when that dream sequence came on , at first i thought : well shit i dun fucked up , now she 's dead and this is a version of heaven for her . 
  then i though : yo madafaka this better not all just have been a fucking dream !, 
  and then when she woke up ... shit went down ... 
  i do n't know why so many people did n't understand jane hid the baby , she practically told you that . 
  a baby could 've seen it coming . 
  i 'm surprised they did n't even add a `` kenny , stop , she hid the baby '' as a choice . 
  i did hesitate a little over whether to shoot kenny but decided not to ... and the ending ... oh man the feels ... 
  also , i have finally gotten some feelings for luke in this season , after a lot of switcharoos based on his actions ... and then he dies : ` ( i read that bonny 's a real bitch to you if you do n't go to help him . 
  and i wo n't put a spoiler tag cause the entire thread is a spoiler . 
  why are you reading a thread about the last episode if you did n't play it yet ? 
  upvote text is fitting . 
  i am aware it is kinda random . 
  it 's just fitting . 
  i 'm kinda sad nobody got the ending i got [ spoiler ] ( / s `` the one where you leave wellington with kenny ... i never cried during season 1 but damn man ... them feels '' ), 
  also , is my spoiler looking kinda weird to anyone else ? 
  expected unpopular opinion : i like fma way more than brotherhood . 
  the characters are way better and i did n't like the xing people at all . 
  the story is about ed and al , why would i care about random nobodies from a country in the middle of the boonies ( not really but you get what i mean ) . 
  i 'm not even gon na mention character development , it 's been said so many times . 
  also brotherhood ai n't got anything close to `` bratja '' . 
  yeah the nazi part was a little bit out of place , but that 's about the only thing i can say was bad . 
  ed was way better in 2003 than brotherhood . 
  in brotherhood he 's a crying baby whenever he has to kill someone . 
  ed in 2003 , while still showing his emotions a little bit too much for my taste , ends up killing a number of homunculus and that just made him way better . 
  did n't really like the ending that much in 2003 but it 's still better than what brotherhood did ( deus ex machina power of friendship out of its ' ass ) . 
  it was just way too cliche . 
  a bunch of people team up and fight the bad guy ( who has all the characteristics of a cliche bad guy too , at least dante had an actual human reason for being the villain , though her death was lame ) . 
  also , i never really had a feeling of `` oh shit somebody may die '' in brotherhood . 
  sure , not a lot of people died in the 2003 version either , but it was just way darker and i really felt fear for many of the main characters . 
  they could have died so many times in brotherhood but no , they were `` human sacrifices '' . 
  they do n't get a trump card like that in 2003 . 
  and to finish it off : seriously , fuck those `` silly '' animations . 
  if i wanted to [ see ed look like a dog that lost all but a little bit of its ' hair ] ( http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/125404/3757266-6570036106-24612.jpg ) and then get wrenched to the point of literally dying by winry ( the part where al goes all `` oh no brother 's soul is going out of his body in the part where ed says he 's gon na fight scar ) i would have googled it . 
  the hype 's been proven . 
  it is now :d, 
  you know , i tried practically anything and everything i could find ( from some random editing to running the game in win xp sp2 compatibility mode ) except this simple solution . 
  after i reinstalled it worked marvelously . 
  i think i 'm bugged out somehow , i used the editor to make a somewhat brown-ish color , and then after completing a mission it went black again . 
  weird stuff . 
  this * is * an actual excuse though , i mean 5 hearts is n't little . 
  i think i 'll skip on the isp stuff , but could you possibly explain how to do the other stuff you mentioned ? 
  i 'm kinda not getting stuff right now . 
  if i do something like `` how to get firewall to drop packets '' it lists me arguments over whether reject or drop is better , and if i go `` blacklisting an ip '' it shows a. . . bunch of stuff that 's still not helping me ... 
  i just want to see myself being spoopy . 
  erm ... windows 7 , it 's a desktop ( so not a laptop i guess ) . 
  network setup ? 
  not really sure what 's that . 
  i 'm connected to a router , along with another pc and 1 laptop . 
  the 2nd question is n't what i asked , i understand what they did when they went back , but when he pressed enter ( apparently deleting something from sern 's database , in the future , nothing to do with time , ) something in the past changed without use of the phone microwave . 
  that has me confused as to how deleting something in the future changes the past . 
  yeah figured out the roll part a couple of tries in , but how to deal with the shield dudes ? 
  erm , i 'm kinda new to this game , can someone tell me what this `` puzzle '' is about ? 
  anyone else dies a little bit inside every time guude clicks `` nap '' which only does 1 arrow , instead of `` sleep '' which does 3 ? 
  just me being crazy then ?
