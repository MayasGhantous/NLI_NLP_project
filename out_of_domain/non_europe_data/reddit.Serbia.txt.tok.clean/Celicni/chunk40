  but it also fucks over your devil deals :, 
  basement/cellar/burning basement : does n't fuck over your overall deals but it 's harder because you ca n't get hit until you take a spirit heart , while you would probably get one by floor 2 . 
  any other : literally rips out 1 devil deal out of your possible devil deals . 
  labyrinth is the only actually bad one . 
  takes away a shop , and fucks over your devil deals . 
  probably not going to `` make '' anything but ... 
  better angel rooms mod . 
  better pills mod . 
  remove guaranteed damage rooms mod . 
  the problem with labyrinth as the first floor is you ca n't get hit . 
  you can get hit all you want on floor 1 , and have a reasonable chance of finding a spirit heart . 
  ca n't do that on labyrinth first floor . 
  whether it 's a skill problem is irrelevant , it 's a disadvantage either way . 
  this is way too complicated for an item . 
  and also `` d '' `` a '' buttons ? 
  those are already used for movement unless i 'm not understanding the description . 
  thank you . 
  seemed like i was the only one here that realized that . 
  the curse is deceptively terrible . 
  at a glance you think `` oh it 's not bad '' . 
  but if you think about it you realize it 's the worst one overall , as none of the others literally make your run worse . 
  what i mean by that is that you can affect the other curses . 
  ca n't do shit about labyrinth . 
  i do n't see how losing a shop , and a devil deal chance is good . 
  i do n't get it . 
  there was a post about it . 
  i clearly remember it . 
  very quickly debunked though . 
  scissors + gemini . 
  cuts off the umbilical cord . 
  gemini becomes stronger and attacks at will , like familiars such as leech/dead bird ( though with better ai of course ) . 
  holy fuck . 
  you just blew my mind . 
  i never even thought of this . 
  damn you . 
  i just started the day ... now it 's all going to be gone ... 
  i do n't think you can ** consistently ** move fast enough . 
  the windup is ~ 1 second . 
  and you have to move diagonally because there 's an enemy directly below . 
  maybe possible with insanely high speed ( and add like 0.3 seconds reaction time to realize what room it is ) but imagine it as maggy . 
  what if you have shit dps ? 
  i looked up everything i possibly could without actually spoiling the story for myself . 
  so i knew what stats are important , where you can raise them and how , stuff like that . 
  may i recommend adding in the old `` color coded '' synergies like with vanilla ? 
  for stuff that is detrimental ( triple shot monstro 's lung ) . 
  yeah i know about that . 
  that 's the one i found . 
  need something a bit more specific . 
  while i clearly agree about the game mechanics part , if someone told me how a book ends , i 'd be pretty disappointed . 
  see here 's my problem : in rpg 's , i roleplay my guy as the `` does n't take shit from anybody , and will taunt everyone into attacking him just cause they made a snarky comment '' . 
  and it 's hard to do that if i do n't know shit about the game mechanics , and am therefore weak . 
  hence me looking stuff up . 
  as for min/maxing , i find min/maxing the only way to play . 
  i think that wow has ruined me in that way . 
  i do n't look up the entire guide like `` on level x take ability y '' but i make sure i know every stat in and out , and the requirements for stuff , as well as if you can get missable bonuses that would make putting a stat at 10 `` wasted '' ( see fallout ) . 
  i can see it in the case of mysteries , as you could look for clues of the `` killer '' or whatever the mystery is , but if it 's a drama or something ? 
  well , i do all my min/maxing outside of the game . 
  my new vegas character was all set and done before i even created it . 
  the game to me was basically the same , just without me thinking `` oh should i have made a different build '' . 
  i remember in fallout 2 , i slept with a crimelord 's daughter . 
  he ** demanded ** that my character do a job for him . 
  me , as always , roleplaying the guy that does n't take shit from anyone , shot him and all his mercs dead . 
  and i could do that because i looked up the stats/perks . 
  if i just went along i 'd definitely be too weak for that , and i would n't be able to roleplay as effectively anymore . 
  well , unless i did some glitches/cheats . 
  as far as paradox strategy , i had looked up a fairly sizeable amount of videos before even turning them on . 
  i now consider myself pretty good at ck2 ( conquered the map on my first playtrough thanks to the knowledge i had ) and very good at eu4 . 
  i can see many people getting ruined by wow . 
  i knew all of icc tactics before i even set foot inside of it . 
  finally , i truly do n't believe min/maxing breaks immersion . 
  if anything i think it enhances it ( as seen in my example above ) . 
  video game rules are n't the same as real life rules . 
  in an rpg you do n't know which stat is the `` worst '' . 
  your character would , hence why i find it acceptable to look it up . 
  we must be playing a different game . 
  i would n't exchange d6 for almost anything . 
  there 's 50 items in the devil room pool . 
  some are pretty bad . 
  maybe not 4 , but i 'd say :, 
  2 devil room items . 
  1 red chest contains teleportation to current floor dwtd ( you have to pay for items ) . 
  1 red chest contains 2 spirit hearts . 
  i think that 'd make it a serious contender for the chest . 
  allow me to provide an example . 
  in real life , obviously , the smarter/more charismatic you are , the better you 'll do in conversations . 
  you can not know if that translates into the game 's world . 
  for example , coming from the many rpg 's in which intelligence or charisma do not affect conversations ( charisma part applies to fallout , there 's very few charisma checks in all of the games except 4 , most of it are speech ) i could be thinking : `` oh ps : t will be just like those games , why should i bother leveling wisdom when i 'll be a fighter and not use mana '' ( as i assumed wisdom would have something to do with being a mage ) . 
  nope , in that game mental skills do affect conversations . 
  that 's why i look stuff up , because you ca n't expect the game world to follow the same world as real life . 
  about that , like i said i would play offline . 
  i would very likely not know of even the existence of illusory walls , while if i played online there would be a bunch of messages in front of every single one . 
  so i found that fair . 
  it 's better than his other unlocks for sure , but as a standalone item , i still do n't consider it pretty good . 
  i do n't know if the spawn rate is dependent on luck or whatever , but the eyes never spawn enough for me to consider the item great . 
  crime does n't pay ? 
  are we living in the same world ? 
  why normal mode only ? 
  i thought you meant `` normal '' as in `` normal vs hard '' . 
  i have everything against magneto . 
  not cause it 's bad per se , but because it takes up an item room slot .
