  i 'm from a country in which an aaa game is about ... 1/5th ( maybe a bit less ) of an average citizen 's ** monthly ** payment . 
  my pc is a potato , because i ca n't afford a new one . 
  that 's about the reason why i pirate . 
  makes me feel really bad for some games too ( like the binding of isaac that i 've been playing/watching people play/participating in the subreddit for about 1.5 years now ) , but eh . 
  rib of greed works as well . 
  i had one spawn in the room just next to the shop , went into shop , got greed , beat him , got out and took the trinket , went in and it was a normal shop . 
  mind blown . 
  same . 
  i do the 2 side ones no problem , but something always fucks me up in the center . 
  is ** what ** supposed to happen ? 
  sorry i do n't really understand the question . 
  when you do it enough times yes . 
  most of the items in isaac , once obtained , can not be obtained again . 
  so when you reroll your items , they 're gone forever . 
  the game only has an x amount of items , so if you change them enough times you 'll run out and the game will give you nothing but breakfast . 
  i am still firmly of the opinion labyrinth is the worst curse . 
  all the other curses do n't 100 % fuck your run , you always have some choice ( you can skip the ??? 
  item on blind for example ) . 
  labyrinth is just `` nah fuck you you lose a shop and a devil deal chance , oh and if it 's the first floor you better find a spirit heart fast '' . 
  / u/thesupernaturalist, 
  d4 only rerolls into item room pool , unless you have chaos ( not really sure what happens if you reroll chaos , does the combined item pool stay or not ) . 
  ** [ request ] [ steam ] ** dark souls 3, 
  why do i want dark souls 3 ? 
  there are many reasons . 
  i come from a country in which an aaa game is about 1/5th of an average citizen 's income . 
  not to mention i physically could not buy them even if i had the money , for i have no credit card , and my folk are afraid the `` internet people '' will steal their money . 
  for that reason , i had `` yarr 'd '' dark souls 1 and 2 . 
  and i had fun killing bosses , raging whenever i would die repeatedly , even punching my wall in frustration . 
  and every moment of it was amazing . 
  but ... something was missing . 
  that something was the exciting multiplayer , the fun little messages other players leave , and of course jolly cooperation , which i was hoping to experience . 
  now , my previous experiences behind . 
  even though i had tried to not spoil myself on the game , i had viewed ( a certain amount of ) videos , and it is as amazing as i had hoped for . 
  the gameplay is very similar to the previous games , so obviously i will have tons of fun playing it . 
  there has been some questions concerning the game 's difficulty , but they were all assuaged when it 's revealed the streamers got given an early version of the game , intentionally made easier so everyone could have something to show . 
  so i expect to rage as much as with ds1 and 2 . 
  i 've been replaying the previous games in expectation of it ( as it got released in japan earlier , march 24th ) , and have done a `` no shield '' run in ds1 , and a sorcery only run in ds2 , in order to stave off the urge . 
  finally , i fully intend to fake sick for about a week , in order to play the game and immerse myself into it fully . 
  i realize the chances are small of me receiving it , as the price is pretty steep . 
  but why not attempt ? 
  you miss 100 of the shots you do n't take . 
  thank you for doing this man , even if i do n't win . 
  377 thank you op . 
  because almost none of the items changing your playstyle give a comparable compensation . 
  i always take guillotine because free orbital + damage + tear delay while i wo n't ever take strange attractor because it 's just bad . 
  it 's not bad , but a candle with a 3 room charge would n't be that good either . 
  pre nerf stopwatch worked for me . 
  what the heck ? 
  azazel and isaac are on the top , and i 'd rank eve just below them . 
  it 's amazingly easy to stay in wob with the razor blade , and it gives so much damage . 
  does n't mom automatically give you a cutscene when you kill her the first time ? 
  for new characters , they legitimately may not be worth it . 
  hp is way more valuable when you get hit often . 
  same reason maggy may be top tier for a new player but it 's trash for the experienced ones . 
  marked does n't show up . 
  you should have been more clear on the wording if that is the case , as i had assumed it 's literally a `` who is the best '' kind of dealio . 
  eve is also allowed as much health as she wants , thanks to the razorblade . 
  that 's why i only started considering her good in afterbirth whereas in rebirth i thought her middling and in vanilla she was pretty trash . 
  however she also has good speed and more starting health than judas . 
  comparing her to judas does give a fair argument , and samson is also a fair opponent most of the time , but other characters are n't close to her . 
  cain 's paper clip ca n't make up for that sweet damage , not to mention keys are usually only a problem early on . 
  also for the isaac argument : who would reroll stigmata ? 
  and if you do reroll a shit item into another shit item guess what ... you got unlucky twice in a row . 
  on another character , that would be 2 item rooms lost ( 1 now 1 next floor ) rather than just 1 . 
  so after more than a +1 damage upgrade judas can overtake her . 
  but that 's after the damage ups , and after you get a few , the next one matters less and less . 
  meanwhile eve had 1 more heart to trade for dwtd and had waaay higher speed ( .23 base + 0.3 wob = over 50 % faster ) . 
  i just said the first thing that comes into my mind when i think of marked . 
  that 's what the website is about , to type what you think you see and have it pop . 
  why am i so disappointed with the game ? 
  did i have fun playing it ? 
  sure . 
  so if i had fun it was a decent game no ? 
  again ... sure . 
  but i played fallout , not call of duty . 
  i expected one thing and got a totally different thing . 
  the thing i got was still pretty alright but i am allowed to be unsatisfied . 
  there 's fringe cases of course , i just did n't feel like listing them . 
  and why is he exactly a terrible candidate ? 
  please respond in pm , i do n't want to fill the comments with politics and genuinely want to know , as i am not american . 
  at 1 damage up they 're about the same . 
  at 2 damage up judas starts pulling ahead slowly . 
  but by the time there 's a significant difference , it wo n't matter that much as you got nice damage with either character . 
  i wo n't really comment on the spacebar items , as i basically uses bob only for the boss . 
  too good to use syndrome . 
  speed is n't important for me either , but as eve you can take all the lards , thunder thighs , and speed down pills you want . 
  and also more speed is nice either way , especially 50 % more . 
  and why not ? 
  multi devil deals do happen commonly . 
  i do n't really have much use for filled containers , i tend to go full spirit hearts whenever possible . 
  and people can have subjective opinions over which characters are literally the best , as we 're discussing right now . 
  of course everyone will have their own favorite characters . 
  opening a golden chest others could n't get is a fringe case , like i said , keys are only a problem early on . 
  i do n't know about you , but i very much like even the slightest amount of damage . 
  0.3 is a very decent upgrade imo . 
  i did n't really mean golden chests are rare , more that opening a golden chest others could n't get is rare . 
  first/second floors are about the only times keys are in short supply most of the time . 
  of course , paper clip is awesome , but i 'd take the ** guaranteed ** damage . 
  and 0.3 from one thing , then 0.3 from another ... it stacks up . 
  does n't even have to stack up a whole lot , 1 less hit per enemy is very good .
