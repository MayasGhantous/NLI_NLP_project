  something exactly like that . 
  thank you . 
  not so easy when there 's 2 of them : /, 
  that 's good for items i do n't know , and their use , but definitely not what i 'm looking for . 
  not really lol . 
  will try as soon as i 'm out of the winter palace . 
  now that 's useful . 
  i 'd like a spacebar item called `` clock '' . 
  6 room charge , takes you back to the previous room ** with the amount of hp you had before entering the current one ** . 
  so basically if you fuck up and take a lot of damage on an easy room , you can try again . 
  nope , does not work . 
  it was a resolution problem of some kind indeed . 
  i have to go into windowed mode to fix it . 
  dunno what the issue is . 
  i think zisteau axed vechs . 
  figured as much . 
  do n't really like it : / it just fits to me that mages should buff magic . 
  but whatever . 
  thanks for the answer . 
  can we all just agree that the actual win goes to blue team , and add 3 kills to baj in the uhc most deadliest tracking statistics ( and remove the 6 kills from vechs/btc ) . 
  well after looking up the stats it seems the archon/seer/first enchanter are all pretty much the same except for the other 2 having better utility/offensive/whatever stuff . 
  and that really is n't worth my time . 
  i just wanted the max staff damage , wo n't cry over missing like 10 % more attack ( though i guess it is significant but too much min-maxing ) . 
  guess i 'll do that and maybe hope for a drop from the other 2 ( cause i 'm not letting bull 's men die ) . 
  thanks man . 
  cricket 's a cat . 
  anyone knows why is etho playing in that view mode ? 
  you can only see a little bit of the screen . 
  also they should probably know that yellow biome is the savannah and that 's where they 're gon na want to set up camp . 
  yeah definitely looks more like a dog . 
  could be a weird looking cat though . 
  the actual cricket still is a cat . 
  i started the earliest i could . 
  i guess all i can do is get buttfucked : /, 
  that rotting seems interesting . 
  how should i go about doing that ? 
  could i somehow conquer croatia ? 
  that fly at [ around 13 minutes ] ( http://youtu.be/kuml8gqwxnw?t=12m58s ) is the real mvp of this run . 
  i was in the family man challenge , and decided to go in just to see if i could screw myself over and go to sheol . 
  turns out though i got rewarded ... with 2 hostile spiders , 2 regular troll bombs and 1 homing troll bomb , but still . 
  so , always check your womb 2 devil deal people ... it ** may ** contain something , 
  hm ... i 'm in the `` tutorial island '' of ireland , as it 's my first playtrough . 
  i have only 1 actual vassal ( by actual i mean he has his land , none of that city/church bullcrap ) whose title i have been desperately trying to take but he wo n't die . 
  i actually conquered almost all of ireland and all the counties belong to me ( though i hit the limit now it seems as i have 9/9 ) . 
  and now that you mentioned technology , am i screwing myself over by being the count of everything , or would it count me as a count over and over again for the purpose of technlogy ? 
  aww , i thought i was doing great and you crushed my dreams now :(, 
  i chose primogeniture as inheritance . 
  how would duchies affect it ? 
  gavelkind sucks though : / i 'd just want to conquer it all back . 
  hm , you seem to be thinking about the same way i do :d is there a way to make it so that i can control the church/city while controling a castle at the same time ? 
  because it 's just useless otherwise as it gives me less taxes . 
  i think i 'll stick with primo for now . 
  thanks man you 've been of great help . 
  can you answer just 1 more question : why are most of my techs not advancing in the slightest ? 
  i need more economy levels for higher tax income buildings , but it says 0.00 % per month/year and it keeps advancing the stuff i do n't really need . 
  i know about that , but the research is n't slow . 
  the ones that work are quite fast . 
  but some are just stuck . 
  also i have bigger research than constantinople so that wo n't work . 
  well , the prices are getting pretty insane . 
  850 for a petty kingdom of whothefuckcaresbecauseitsucks . 
  any other way to get claims on that territory ? 
  if i conquer part of a kingdom , do i have a claim on the entire kingdom ? 
  i agree with that `` one route '' choice . 
  it really should n't take that long ( in ks it was ~ 20-25 eps per char ) and we actually get to see the story play out . 
  hm , can you explain how to do that ? 
  the rulers are usually male , so i got ta marry them/their heirs with women , but they do n't accept matrilinieal marriage so i wo n't get claim . 
  and women usually do n't rule so they have no heirs i can marry my males to in order to get a claim . 
  i know about the `` invite to court '' option and i try to do that . 
  wow . 
  that sucks . 
  so i 'm gon na have to spend like a 100 years converting all of my lands ... 
  thanks . 
  what if i 'm 1280 x 1024 : /, 
  i 'm not really using any retinues . 
  i do n't like the cost : /, 
  i do n't know really . 
  all i saw was `` monthly upkeep '' and immediately went nope . 
  what happened to the rebellions ? 
  game was awfully complicated so i looked up an lp by j2jonjeremy and he was able to get rid of annoying vassals by raising their levies and then they 'd rebel . 
  that never happens to my vassals ( and i got like 3 with -100 ) . 
  also if i was to imprison and execute ( which i did once in my first attempt game ) and then put new vassals , would those new vassals still hate me ? 
  and finally , could i just attempt to imprison all the vassals , and if i imprison them , i execute and take titles , if i do n't , i crush their meager forces , then strip titles . 
  would that work ? 
  would that work if he 's the heir though ? 
  because you ca n't normally have him take the vows if he 's the first in line . 
  no mods . 
  only thing is i turned off the sunset invasion . 
  yeah . 
  did n't work . 
  i just console killed the slut : /, 
  peasants trained and equipped vs peasants with pitchforks ? 
  anyway , can someone actually help with the problem rather than discussing whether my army consists of peasants ? 
  i just see people brand rebellions as `` annoying to deal with '' because they `` have to raise 2 counties worth of levies '' . 
  if the peasants scale to my top levy , how would that work ? 
  that wo n't do cause i 'm converting a bunch of pagan lands to orthodoxy ... i need to beat them , not prevent them . 
  no , i 'm a rather decent sized kingdom . 
  but they scale to 100 % of my levies . 
  hm okay . 
  but it 's still confusing me as to why other people say they can `` bring 2 counties worth of soldiers '' if the peasants are 100 % of total ... would that not be too little soldiers ?
