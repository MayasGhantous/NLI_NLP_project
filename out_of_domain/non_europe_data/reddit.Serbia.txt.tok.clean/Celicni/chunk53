  did not at any point feel like i was at a disadvantage because of using m&kb . 
  feel free to continue using them . 
  yep , exactly how much i have . 
  hah , i am not putting this character into ng + . 
  dlc has already been rumored , and based off the previous 3 games ' dlc it will be disadvantageous to start it with ng + . 
  hat wearing skeleton ? 
  i thought you just get it when the ball hits the wall a second time , like it shatters somehow . 
  i do n't really recall him that well but i died like 10 times at this guy . 
  more than any boss in the game bar one ( in an optional area , you 'll know the one if you fought him ) . 
  in the end i just dragged him to the stairs and he does n't attack as he moves down . 
  yeah i felt it was pretty minor . 
  but still used it because memories . 
  you 're in the catacombs/lake area ? 
  yeah you 're way off , the one i 'm thinking about is endgame basically . 
  yeah but she took the tome so , as i do n't want her to read the bad juju , i ca n't give it to karla . 
  she 's in a mid-to late game area , locked in a cell . 
  i can elaborate more if you want . 
  o.o i 'm on my second character and i 'm level 23 when i entered undead settlement . 
  my interpretation as well . 
  however , my undead was the dark lord so ... he 's not there . 
  i do n't think there ** is ** a canon . 
  at least not one that matters . 
  dude i was so sure it was the effect of being inside the `` cursed graveyard '' or something . 
  then i happened to roll at just the right time and thought rolling gets rid of whatever it is . 
  actually had way more problems with this in ds1 . 
  just about every single large enemy could do it , main offenders being titanite demons . 
  i spent a decent amount of time ( 3 years ) on 4chan and still did n't know it . 
  this is a big part of what i dislike about ds lore . 
  not that it 's obscure , but that so much is left unexplained . 
  yeah my hair is terrible with the lightning . 
  it looked black as fuck in the character creator so i increased the `` redness '' of it to make it more brown . 
  now it 's still pitch black in most areas but in some it 's like i have fire on my head . 
  in dark souls ii : scholar of the first sin , it is revealed by aldia that even if the first flame fades entirely , a fragment will always remain waiting to be reignited by an undead , creating a cycle in which the age of fire leads into the age of dark , only to be pulled back from the brink at the very last moment . 
  [ and now it 's like this . 
  yeah . 
  1 ) the purpose of my comment was not at all about that . 
  it was simply stating i do not know what angrydragon is , even though i 've been there a while . 
  2 ) that is your opinion , that is mostly unwelcome . 
  found both of them pretty easy , killed them first try , but [ ] ( / s '' the nameless king '' ) was easily the hardest ( and coolest ) boss in entire dark souls franchise . 
  now go do it solo :d it 's just not the same . 
  i could n't let that fucker win . 
  after like 20 tries i started using consumables/resist gear for the first time ever in any souls game . 
  i feel exactly the opposite . 
  i ** refuse ** to let the game win . 
  i just keep trying and trying until i win . 
  refined halberd . 
  used a halberd in ds1 on my first playtrough , it was amazing . 
  used it now , it was amazing ( and it had pretty decent scaling , like 420 ar at 40 str/30 dex ) . 
  did n't use it in ds2 , they fucked up the moveset . 
  anyone mind explaining this for those uninformed ? 
  pretty close actually . 
  she 's in the next area you can visit ( well one of the 2 since the path splits ) . 
  i fall asleep watching nl basically . 
  never had any isaac related nightmares . 
  so any news about the `` stuck animations and invincible to enemies '' bug ? 
  well ... ornstein and smough also respawned ... but yeah that was a major pain in the ass . 
  or ... you can just let people play however they want ? 
  i looked up basically every single item , the descriptions are mostly terrible or straight up inaccurate in some cases . 
  nah , i was 100 % invincible to 90 % of enemies . 
  and that 's the weirdest part , only a select few enemies could hurt me . 
  i posted one comment . 
  do you consider that `` really caring '' ? 
  also , even if one in a million or less was hermaphrodite , most of the people that say something like that are n't . 
  i dislike it because fighting him is always almost the same , whether you have a shit run , or an op run . 
  dammit if i have epic fetus brimstone polyphemus quad shot i wan na feel op . 
  i liked the keeper way more than rebirth lost . 
  i feel exactly the opposite . 
  isaac 's pretty easy , i can never dodge satan 's phase 2 bullets . 
  i think it 'd be pretty good if there were n't fillers nor the horrible `` recap '' episodes . 
  that trims it down to approximately 200 episodes ( i counted 202 could be wrong though ) . 
  i liked it at the immediate start of afterbirth . 
  rerolling constantly was fun . 
  i feel if he could n't reroll holy mantle i 'd play only the lost . 
  i liked the espada : / aizen revelation hit me so hard , did not see it coming at all . 
  yeah i do n't really like op 's item . 
  the way i play is if i hit item room i 'm all done with the floor . 
  when afterbirth released , i remember there being a bunch of posts complaining about this room . 
  could you kill 2 quick enough ? 
  i very much disagree about ds1 dlc . 
  it was way easier for me as a mage . 
  eh , i 'm not that far into the second playtrough ( reached irithyll ) , and magic was pretty bad at the start , but now that i 've pumped int , i find great heavy soul arrow one shots regular mobs . 
  also makes some annoying encounters impossibly easy ( like some of the knights in the cathedral , or the giants ) . 
  when i try something and it does n't work ... i just keep trying the same thing over and over until it works . 
  i 'm stubborn like that . 
  it can depend on the class . 
  i beat it pretty easily my first time as a knight . 
  tried a second playtrough as a sorcerer and got rekt 3 times . 
  sorcery does n't do jack shit and the pitiful stick you start out with does like 15 damage per hit . 
  last boss is too far . 
  if this was seriously added they 'd be like `` omg cheap game i do n't care i beat it , last boss is bullshit '' . 
  personally i 'd add it in firelink shrine . 
  just have the tutorial section be impossible to lose basically , add walls around gundyr so even if he grabs you he ca n't throw you off . 
  damn , must have missed that . 
  windows troubleshooting is unchecked already for me . 
  heh , the issue is that it happened to me with some other game before , i kept ticking `` do n't ask me again '' yet it always kept popping back up . 
  notice how i said `` annoying '' rather than hard ? 
  because that 's what fighting the 2 giants in the cathedral was . 
  also great heavy soul arrow shat on them , 3 or 4 shot them at no risk to myself . 
  and yeah , you can catch the annoying ranged mobs very fast and easy . 
  against bosses , i find that i am able to pull off a great heavy soul arrow when they finish a combo , and a great soul arrow at other times .
