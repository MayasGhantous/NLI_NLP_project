  that 's a dumb ass argument . 
  first off , you can barely see any ass with the amount of cloaks this game has , and also if you 're just looking at your toon you 're doing it wrong . 
  what 's the song that played when he saw the darksign sun ? 
  also damn i hope he does n't forget about consumed king 's garden like he did with demon ruins . 
  he plays completely opposite to me . 
  always explore side areas first , going main quest first may make you miss some stuff in most games . 
  thanks . 
  that is not a player character . 
  so in the general election , it 'd be only 2 guys one against another ? 
  like trump vs sanders ? 
   stop trying to parry and just fight them normally you died so many times ... 
  anyone else kept thinking this during the entire video ? 
  yeah , seriously . 
  some people fanboy over marcus too much . 
  missing questlines is no big deal , some of them are pretty obscure , but no need to defend every single thing he does . 
  i found pontiff amazingly easy on my first playtrough ( killed first try ) and my third ( second try ) as both of those were melee . 
  he was a big pain in the ass on my sorcerer playtrough . 
  must have died like 5-6 times to him . 
  finding secret rooms is n't exactly something a beginner does often . 
  if you find one , you should be rewarded even the slightest bit imo . 
  damn . 
  i did not expect to see my fav weapon ( halberd ) so high up . 
  i thought it was pretty bad since i do like half the damage everyone else does , with a fully quality build . 
  not really the way i meant it . 
  i thought of it more as `` it 's a semi-advanced skill you have to sacrifice resources for '' . 
  it requires knowing how the secret rooms spawn . 
  and then after that you just get jack shit , not to mention there is often more than one spot where a second secret room can spawn . 
  it 's not an `` always yes '' situation like the other guy seems to imply it is . 
  when there 's 5 potential locations , and you have 2 bombs , it 's not as easy as you make it out to be . 
  it 's already a risk because you 're using up a consumable . 
  no need to toss the reward part out . 
  if it was nl , he 'd just lionstrat \u2122 past all those guys . 
  why do you consider this bad ? 
  it 's great imo . 
  better than just roll roll roll as fast as possible . 
  the combo ? 
  dark souls being hard is a fucking meme . 
  if anything , ds3 is too fucking easy . 
  the way i see it , he 's simply ** a ** knight , not one of the 4 . 
  i replayed ds1 a couple of days ago , died way more than in ds3 . 
  i firmly believe ds3 is way too easy . 
  how is that comment edgy ? 
  bloodborne is so confusing for me . 
  everything looks the same . 
  have no troubles like that in any of the dark souls games though . 
  i can kind of understand him . 
  i get that way as well with games . 
  at the start i 'm insanely thorough and near the end i usually stop caring about minor stuff , and just want it to end . 
  not because i dislike the game , usually quite the opposite . 
  i just want to start replaying it again/playing the sequel as fast as possible . 
  that 's the same exact point i found it as well . 
  i was sitting there for like 30 seconds thinking `` is this going to kill me '' . 
  then i dunked my head in ... and was very confused . 
  on his first try . 
  i 'd be suspicious as well . 
  ... i am wondering so hard right now whether this is b8 or someone is actually this retarded ... 
  what the fuck o.o how do you find something as obscure as that and miss the obvious giant road next to the worm ? 
  i see you 're not a bluebro . 
  except , even if you look everything up , like half the stuff is still missing , left for people to headcanon . 
  which is stupid imo . 
  if you start telling a story , finish it . 
  like , the very core of the game is not explained very well . 
  ok , there will be an age of dark if the first flame fades ... why ? 
  like , will it physically prevent fires from being lit ? 
  is it just a term , to imply that all the non-human beings will lose their powers ? 
  why and how ? 
  not to mention character motivations . 
  it 's amazingly easy to beat him with a strategy i found here on reddit . 
  just stay between his fingers on his back legs . 
  if you do it properly , he always just does a leg stomp , and then you run to the other leg , repeat . 
  i fucked it up like 3-4 times at the start , and he did the fire breath , but then i got into the rhythm , and he never did anything else . 
  pretty easy . 
  others are n't so lucky . 
  sure , but more specifically ? 
  alternatively , is there a character editor ? 
  this war of mine . 
  i 'm mostly looking forward to dishonored 2 . 
  expect it 'll be amazing , like the first game was . 
  number is ... 696 ? 
  why does everyone keep going on about arbitrary quests ? 
  i found them much harder in 1 and 2 . 
  the only ones i dislike are sirris and siegward/patches because they require you to go back to somewhere you have no reason being . 
  `` fallout 3 is a fantastic game '' . 
  no ... 1,2 , and new vegas are fantastic games . 
  3 is merely ok . 
  i just started laughing when i went to loot the chest and saw a barrel moving behind me ... i survived with like 2 % hp . 
  only challenge was nameless king . 
  everything else was pretty easy . 
  game should have been harder . 
  / u/rollme, 
  so basically , he found horace , a pyromancy tome , and killed the worm ... pretty empty episode . 
  next one should be way better though . 
  always hollowed . 
  fun fact : anri clearly did not search for him very well . 
  you can see horace from anri 's second spot in the catacombs ( near the collapsing bridge ) . 
  sorry , i do n't understand your question . 
  not sure of the exact trigger , but if i had to guess i 'd say simply talking to anri near the bonfire ( where you first meet her ) , and then entering the catacombs ( according to the wiki you can kill horace before talking to anri for the first time in the catacombs ) . 
  so if i , a dude , tuck my dick between my legs , dress up as a girl , shave my beard/let hair grow out , and say i identify as a girl , i should be able to go in the woman 's bathroom ? 
  if it has no penis , it 's not a man . 
  let me correct myself then : if it has no penis ** at birth ** it 's not a man .
