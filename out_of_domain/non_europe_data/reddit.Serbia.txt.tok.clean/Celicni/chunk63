  good enough ? 
  you 're putting words in my mouth . 
  assuming you 're not bullshitting about those 2 , i agree . 
  use the bathroom for the thing you have . 
  of course , i also think anyone that would chop their dick off is mentally ill in the first place , but that 's irrelevant . 
  read my above comment . 
  soo ... that 's something i 'm not gon na read . 
  i barely got to the whole `` shared a restroom with trannies '' part ... definitely not ... i live in a country that fortunately is n't so cucked . 
  can confirm . 
  is there a magical forcefield that scans my private parts ? 
  is there a cop inside each bathroom that checks what you 've got down there ? 
  i could basically call myself a tranny , and if anyone calls me a man i will call them a bigot . 
  that is the kind of degeneracy i am most against .

  nice of you to be doing this . 
  the game sounds like everything i ever wanted . 
  may not be `` just you '' but i 'm sure tons of people have troubles with him . 
  he was the second hardest boss for me ( 7 deaths ) , first of course being nk ( around 20 ) . 
  he said the playtrough is ~ ~ 48 ~ ~ 47 episodes long . 
  we 're on 42 . 
  i really can not imagine him doing anything but archdragon peak , in ~ ~ 6 ~ ~ 5 episodes . 
  in the flameless shrine , the first flame was close . 
  i believe that 's what he was talking about . 
  i do n't think you understand just how much of a difference phantoms make . 
  it took me 20 tries to solo nameless king . 
  i did coop on him 10 + times . 
  not a single time has the host been killed . 
  except ... all the walls are incredibly obvious ? 
  oh look , an optional area that only has a gesture at the end ... totally not suspicious at all . 
  furthermore , this place where irina always was that now has a giant ass wall where she was ? 
  again , totally not suspicious . 
  key word right there . 
  consumed king 's easy , but tons of people ( including me ) find champion gundyr hard . 
  second hardest boss in the game ** imo ** . 
  i , for example , find abyss watchers laughably easy . 
  i have not died to them once at any point . 
  i also find pontiff not that hard . 
  but other people do . 
  nothing too important in the gardens left though . 
  just a ring and a shortcut . 
   explore pc, 
  what do you mean by `` pc '' ? 
  i want to see his reaction to the whole `` this guy does n't really stop attacking does he '' . 
  he dedicated a whole episode to pontiff and abyss watchers , is wanting him to at least experience the fight once too much to ask ? 
  he is ? 
  champion just does n't stop attacking . 
  for pus of man , just run into him , circle to right when needed and spam r1 . 
  if you wan na throw it right , press d before throwing it . 
  ditto for other 3 directions . 
  i personally prefer the 2003 version . 
  not a fan of the whole [ ] ( / s `` everything gets solved by friendship '' ) at the end of brotherhood . 
  oh ... so that 's what he says ... i 've been wondering all this time . 
  nuclear throne - 243, 
  thanks . 
  dante dies , as do almost all the homunculi ( and then they all do in the movie ) , and al gets his body back . 
  sucks for ed , but otherwise pretty `` resolved '' imo . 
  beating father ? 
  ed getting al 's body back for a rather cheap price , meaning he could 've done it from the beginning and skip all the stuff in the middle ? 
  everyone living happily ever after ? 
  yeah , dodge is so op in this game . 
  i used a shield in all of ds1 and 2 . 
  barely used it ever in this one . 
  that 's cheating . 
  fallout : 3 and 4 . 
  no i meant , that literally has to be cheating . 
  the guy i was responding to did not mention that in his comment . 
  i assume it was a 1v1 . 
  we seem to disagree again . 
  i think ds2 is as good as the others . 
  i do however agree with the `` they 're still very enjoyable games '' . 
  i enjoyed playing fallout 4 for the 50 hours i played it . 
  the music was very nice . 
  it is not a bad game , but it 's a godawful fallout game . 
  both the illusory walls he hit , he hit other 2 spots first ( the one leading to untended graves , and then the one leading to the serpent ring ) . 
  the `` jump from a tree '' thing is the only one that seems suspicious to me . 
  i loved playing `` arcanum of steamworks and magick obscura '' or , arcanum for short . 
  it 's such a classic rpg , with basically everything you do mattering in some way . 
  it also had the fallout `` dumb characters can not talk normally '' system , and it was just a fun game in general . 
  of course , it has a cult following , because it 's a great game , but so little people have heard of it , and many dislike it because of stuff like `` graphics '' . 
  of course , a valid complaint is the game 's combat system but , like with planescape : torment , combat is very much not the focus of this game .

  thanks . 
  i disagree . 
  i only found 2 to be bullshit ( siegward and sirris ) . 
  all the rest are about right . 
  4 here , still nothing . 
  i found basically everything else ( i watched 3 playtroughs of dark souls as well as me playing ) and i still do n't know where the fuck patches is at the cathedral . 
  not sure if you play extremely slow , or i play fast . 
  most of my runs are done in the 30-35 minute range . 
  `` is n't too far off '' . 
  i only started watching the guy because he was basically the only one with a finished amnesia playtrough . 
  then i watched his other horror videos . 
  it was nice , no editing every 2 seconds , or need to have a joke every 5 . 
  his content has very much changed . 
  following my logic , which may be false :, 
  it does n't work with regular setup . 
  it works if i use another program to switch the input to a keyboard key . 
  i am still clicking the very same mouse . 
  if it was the mouse , i 'd be getting issues even after the auto hotkey script .
