  yes . 
  off topic discussion . 
  as in , something that does n't add to the original topic . 
  i honestly think you 're just trolling at this point . 
  yes . 
  i am 100 % sure you 're trolling at this point . 
  i wo n't bother responding anymore . 
  ps : ds2 was great . 
  i got fucking lost in that place , and when i 'm supposed to get back to the main room it took me a while . 
  i got 5 approval for `` being fashionably late now '' . 
   naked ciri is naked, 
  manus gets killed by us in the `` past '' , when anor londo is still `` mighty '' ( according to gough ) . 
  that said there 's no way that 's true . 
  yeah , if he did n't have that fucking bullshit attack , he 'd be incredibly easy . 
  his melee moves are extremely telegraphed and easy to dodge . 
  same with the `` great big magic attack '' . 
  knowing how to prevent it sure helped on my sl1 run . 
  when he `` disappears '' , stand in the center of the room , but very slightly to one side . 
  he always appears in the spot furthest away from you . 
  so if you 're a bit off the center , he 'll appear in one of the two corners on the other side ( one you 're not on ) . 
  just run to him as fast as you can , he should n't do the arrow attack , and all the other ones are extremely easy . 
  read my reply to 343pls . 
  that people clearly liked . 
  yeah , that works great for phase 1 . 
  but phase 2 is absolute horseshit . 
  that 's not the game glitching out . 
  p2 arrow attack is bullshit . 
  try it out if you do n't believe me . 
  is it not `` doomhammer '' ? 
  heh , i feel exactly the opposite . 
  killed pontiff first try on my first playtrough . 
  aldrich killed me 5 times . 
  halberd was my first playtrough . 
  see now here 's the thing . 
  i never approve of doing something like this to a fellow human being . 
  the issue comes form the fact i do n't consider people like these human beings . 
  there is absolutely ** no censorship ** on ** \\ / r/news **, 
  been a long time since i saw the d threshold mentioned . 
  it 's literally advertised as a trump rally . 
  they have another subreddit for `` discussion '' . 
  meanwhile / r/news , and most definitely / r/politics are supposed to encourage discussion . 
  they literally state it 's a circlejerk/rally sub . 
  there 's a separate one where you can do actual discussion . 
  which is a little bit different than what / r/news is pretending to be . 
  d threshold sounds better to me :(, 
  it 's in the side bar . 
  you 're expected to read it before you post . 
  whether you consider it good or not , it 's their subreddit , is advertised as such , and is not a default one . 
  they ca n't be held up to the same standards as / r/news . 
  i do . 
  6 chars , all the same name ( my rl name ) . 
  tons of wikipedia articles are edited in one way or another , to push propaganda , be it left or right . 
  am on chrome , do n't have the option . 
  ... did you just delete and post the very same comment that was downvoted to hell ? 
  your spoiler is n't working for me . 
  yep , works fine now . 
  removes the `` curse '' of losing out on a devil deal chance and another shop . 
  i 've argued before in this subreddit that labyrinth is the worst curse in the game , simply because you can not do anything about it . 
  when it comes up , you 're fucked . 
  say goodbye to a shop . 
  say goodbye to a devil deal chance . 
  nobody forces you to pick up an item during curse of the blind , you take a risk . 
  you can draw a map for curse of the lost . 
  maze can actually be abused to get into item rooms/shops without giving keys . 
  unknown you can remember/write down your hearts . 
  labyrinth just fucks you . 
  yeah no kidding . 
  had to learn how to parry him and pontiff for my sl1 playtrough . 
  quite easier than i expected . 
  21 minutes for end of caves 2 , damn . 
  i do not envy you . 
  nah , i do n't do dailies . 
  for multiple reasons . 
  if you say `` it 's just chance it does n't matter '' in this game , i ca n't take you seriously . 
  item rooms are also just a matter of chance , you could get mom 's knife , or you could get butterbean . 
  so why bother with them if it 's just chance ? 
  and your second paragraph is literally just saying `` hey this 1 item would totally break everything '' . 
  if we ignore you 're complaining about one item in a very unique circumstance ( dagaz on xl floor ) , how exactly would two shops be somehow worse than one , with restock ? 
  most shops have 2 items , restock is one item , the other is still there . 
  so almost the same as having 2 shops . 
  and you 're highly overvaluing consumables . 
  i basically only care about keys . 
  i did not at all take the suggestion as `` dagaz should act like goathead '' . 
  merely that it gives you a chance at 2 devil deals . 
  meaning you could get 0 , 1 or 2 . 
  haha yeah , that one sucks as well , because i have a shitty monitor that makes everything too dark . 
  i bump the gamma up to 150 and have to pull all the curtains to see anything ... so technically that one is avoidable as well :d, 
  i thought something along the lines of `` make a devil room spawn in boss room # 1 and another in boss room # 2 , assuming you get lucky enough '' . 
  i remember he was hell on my first playtrough . 
  i was just using a shield back then , no rolling . 
  after a couple ds3 playtroughs i went back and replayed ds2 . 
  killed him first try . 
  his attacks are pretty telegraphed . 
  the ring is fucking insane . 
  definitely worth it . 
  thanks for doing this . 
  i 'm aware a start wo n't win or lose the game , but it just seems like such a huge difference in the early game . 
  what 's the point of using sarcasm if you 'll just announce it ? 
  all i saw was `` person x says he was seen in gay bars '' . 
  any actual proof of him kissing a dude or whatever ?
