  i played like 2 hours of the witcher 2 and hated it . 
  i absolutely loved tw3 , my goty 2015 for sure . 
  did not at any point feel like i was missing something major due to not playing the first 2 . 
  i 'm sure i missed a lot of references , but meh . 
  fallout 4 is a bad example ... that game disappointed me in so many ways ... i 'll stick to new vegas . 
  that ... is what i 'm saying ? 
  yeah , this very specific case because it was quite literally the least sarcastic thing i ever read in my life ( that was meant to be sarcastic ) . 
  except if you have chaos i believe . 
  i am almost 100 % certain i got brimstone on a reroll once because i had chaos previously . 
  note the `` almost '' . 
  i could be wrong . 
  good for you / u/trumpsrb , saw you shitposting on / pol / sometimes ( or at least someone pretending to be you ) . 
  as far as i understood , it switches up the pools themselves ? 
  so the item room pool may get devil deal items . 
  i knew it does n't just dump it all in 1 pool , but i thought it simply switched the pools around . 
  that puppet is too pretty for $ hillary . 
  a cumrag woulda been a better choice . 
  oh so that 's what happens ? 
  every time i google something and the result is from forbes , i run into `` quote of the day '' , then i go back a page , and click forbes again . 
  then i can browse freely . 
  person here , your method continues to have 100 % success rates . 
  #praise kek, 
  i. . . changed the flair twice to solved ... it keeps changing back ... 
  ** solution verified **, 
  if you participate in the default subs sure . 
  i have very low karma even though i 've been here for 2 years cause i only participate in niche gaming subs ( mostly binding of isaac ) usually . 
  yo i feel like i may know you from somewhere . 
  what 'd he say ? 
  ... except if you 're on a streak ... 
  hush , ddl/triachnic , isaac , possibly mama gurdy . 
  basically , anything that can not be dodged consistently 100 % of the time . 
  fucking kill yourself op you piece of shit , read the fucking rules . 
  very bad item . 
  you do n't see that many spiders past the basement . 
  are we visiting the same reddit ? 
  everyone puts / s on the most blatantly obvious sarcasm . 
  i. . . am talking about the default subs . 
  and what exactly do you mean by `` newbies '' ? 
  i 'm aware of the term . 
  my question was more `` why are you saying that in a reply to me '' . 
  you say `` many redditors do n't use / s '' . 
  literally everyone everywhere puts a / s on everything , no matter how obvious it is , default subs or not . 
  it most definitely is not . 
  i am actually irrationally annoyed at how common it is for even the most base of sarcasm . 
  and i did n't want to mention it , but i was sure you were downvoting all my shit . 
  erm ... just about everywhere ? 
  both here ( meaning isaac and other niche subs ) and default subs . 
  [ and not that i do n't believe you but ... ] ( http://image.prntscr.com/image/dc857f5e3cb64e10ae74fdf73d513fb8.png ), 
  basically all of my comments are at 0 . 
  i honestly do n't believe someone is actually looking at a conversation this deep . 
  right . 
  someone is taking time out of his day to downvote every single comment of mine in a conversation that is rather long at this point . 
  it was pretty obvious . 
  because i 've never seen literally anybody say pills are too good ( i 've seen people arguing they 're not bad , but never that they 're good ) , and also because the suggestion is ridiculous ( basically because of what you said on your second quote ) . 
  i 've come to the sad realization this is a repost i 've seen 50 fucking times . 
  it does n't work on us , but i really am worried the average voter will be swayed by it , if they were unsure about who to vote for . 
  nah , people were bitching about it ( as they should cause the item is neither good , nor `` zany '' ) . 
  you uh ... really narrowed it down eh ? 
  if you 're not at the tear cap already . 
  which you will be a lot of the time , at which point it 's literally a dps downgrade . 
  also that assumes perfect charging , which wo n't happen . 
  ds is actually really not hard when you `` get it '' . 
  did a sl1 run of ds1 and 3 . 
  nah , never got around to it . 
  i think that one would be the hardest cause of adp ( so rolls have like 0.2 seconds of iframes ) . 
   29 days old account . 
  hello . 
  bullshit , i had an actual fucking potato in my class . 
  she even had a fucking crush on me ... 
  yeah , understood that , but wondering about the odd leveling . 
  3 levels from one game and then none from like 6-7 ? 
  glowing hourglass definitely . 
  such a great and fun item . 
  left mouse button = main button = main action ( stabbing ) . 
  right mouse button = other stuff . 
  but people know who the royal protector is . 
  still waiting on them ps3 and 4 emulators for demon 's souls and bloodborne . 
  corvo first definitely . 
  i guess i 'm biased because i dislike playing as a girl in games , but will definitely be playing emily as well . 
  just after corvo . 
  i 'm not sure i understand what you 're saying . 
  people know who the royal protector is . 
  they may not know who 's the assassin , but the person hired to protect the empress ? 
  everyone knows who that is . 
  we ( eastern europe ) will live . 
  western shits can burn for all i care . 
  they brought it on themselves . 
  rainbow baby was in vanilla though , far far before pride day . 
  # ** the rocket 's red glare **, 
  never said they were n't . 
  but to me it seems more likely ed was inspired by dead babies rather than gays . 
  i thought sas would be a good one as well , but i died way more times due to `` falling down '' than from enemies . 
  definitely not a `` 2d souls '' . 
  very bad , except with some synergies . 
  indeed . 
  shit sucks desu senpai . 
   sworn protector, 
  [ that was my last item as well . 
  good luck .
