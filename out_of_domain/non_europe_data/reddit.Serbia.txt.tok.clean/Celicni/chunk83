  but do n't put us easterners in the same basket with them . 
  if they do it , it 'll be like a crack in the dam . 
  we 'll all come pouring out to everywhere on this site . 
  i am really confused why they always respond to `` what about x from wikileaks '' with `` it was stolen by the russians '' . 
  first off , where 's the proof , and second off , even if it was , how does that make it any less true ? 
  it 's pretty nice tbh . 
  you do n't have to kill a single person . 
  no , not even the targets . 
  i 'd argue the opposite . 
  actually , no . 
  there is not a guaranteed safe spot from his beams of light in p2 . 
  i 'm now expecting a reply saying that there is a guaranteed safe spot . 
  this is false . 
  which i will expand upon after that reply . 
  always been really easy to do that in serbia . 
  but it 's mostly because we hate hillary here . 
  yep . 
  that 's what my second paragraph meant . 
  literally everyone always misunderstands me talking about p3 . 
  it 's quite amusing at this point . 
  read my second paragraph . 
  so many people always assume i 'm talking about p3 ( that you 're referring to ) , rather than p2 ( which the other guy explained ) . 
  phase 2 is pretty coherent , no ? 
  there 's 3 phases , and only 1 type of attack that could be called `` a beam of light '' in phase 2 . 
  very clear explanation . 
  it 's just very amusing to me how everyone 's response is `` lol no those are dodgeable just go to the corner '' , until i remind them there 's a phase 2 in the mix . 
  what if he endorsed hillary ? 
  i 'm sure there 's a minimum amount of ratings required . 
  the most popular game is not necessarily the best . 
  did n't mention it had to be high . 
  probably like 500 + reviews or something . 
  wait , hp numbers on yourself only or on enemies as well ? 
  if second , that seems crazy useful and i ca n't believe i missed that . 
  it also counts bots . 
  i know some people that farmed rampages on bots . 
  i know . 
  did not at all imply that was done on first bloods . 
  just saying that those statistics are extremely irrelevant . 
  of course . 
  just saying that those statistics do n't mean jack shit . 
  i never use it , just like any power that is n't blink or dark vision . 
  i just dislike spending mana at all . 
  positive karma , he 's not doing very well is he ? 
  pull consumes 20 % of daud 's total mana if used on small items like coin , or 40 % if used on a body . 
  seems a waste to get it just to get coins . 
  and he 's back down again . 
  that 's just what i saw posted as an answer in the many threads that were before this one . 
  you 're putting meaning where there was none . 
  yeah , literally never took it in rebirth . 
  afterbirth and vanilla always . 
  i do n't really recall many ( if any ) bethesda games using denuvo . 
  yes , vote for a pathological liar and a criminal instead . 
  well ... why would you just kill random npc 's ? 
  this woulda been useful . 
  i just relied on reflexes to dodge the second i see her . 
  so your first reaction is to kill an npc , rather than leave it as a last resort ? 
  with the joy of mods , that fucking brat will never talk about his fathers ' boots again ... 
  yeah , when i heard a sound i knew she was coming soon . 
  you had me for a moment there . 
  next level shitposting . 
  no one orders me around . 
  curse of the maze can get you into item rooms for free . 
  i actually hate labyrinth , because it 's the only objectively bad curse imo . 
  it removes a shop , and it removes one devil deal chance ( i am aware the floor afterwards counts as if you did two floors , but you still lose one chance at a devil deal ) . 
  because you can avoid their effects . 
  you do n't have to take items on curse of the blind , unknown is solved simply by tracking the hearts yourself , and just up the gamma for darkness . 
  this is weaponized autism in action folks . 
  the success with #draftourdaughters and now the reopening of the investigation ... today was a good day . 
  that ca n't be real ( it is ) . 
  [ reminder that trump is a time traveler . 
  * bumps into trump *, 
  i 'm actually amazed at how well this plan is going . 
  i love this spicy meme . 
  ... but ... but ... 50 points ahead ... guys ... first women president ? 
  look at us , we 're the media now . 
  yeah i hope it 's soon . 
  my internet is n't the best . 
  the one thing i 'd change is being able to take no damage on the way out as well , if you 're flying . 
  i thought it was a fun ** game ** . 
  it was a godawful ** fallout game ** . 
  praise kek !, 
  may our digits forever be repeating . 
  it would be extremely painful . 
  good man . 
  us europeans are kinda fucked when it comes to that i assume . 
  ... for you ... 
   our country, 
  do n't forget us europedes . 
  i finished a run like this on very hard . 
  almost did a `` no knockout '' challenge as well , but i knocked out a total of 6 guards ( 2 in the prison escape since i could n't get ghost while they 're there , 2 daud 's assassins at the very beginning of the flooded district , and 2 guards at the very last level , that bugged out for some reason and i could n't get past them if i did n't knock them out , note that none of these are required , especially not the last 2 ) . 
  no blink used except in the mandatory spots . 
  you should try it , it 's real fun . 
  smoother gameplay ? 
  many qol improvements ? 
  better rolling compared to the horrid 4 way rolling ? 
  i know there 's a circlejerk about ds2 being a piece of trash that should never be spoken about , but give credit where it 's due . 
  like , hitboxes is the one thing i 'll give you , but 4 way rolling is very clunky , not to mention you ca n't roll forward while running cause you jump instead . 
  unpredictable i-frames is a good thing for pvp , and i think it 's the general consensus that the roll and stamina game was one of the reasons ds2 pvp is held to such a high regard . 
  the best out of the 5 moderators . 
  except the i-frames are n't at all unpredictable to you .
