  heh , if i wanted karma , i had plenty of time to earn it . 
  i 've been mostly lurking for the entire time , and we all know there 's some threads that would give you easy karma in here . 
  i am genuinely excited . 
  #president donald j. 
  well , did n't this work out for ya 'll ? 
  kek was with us . 
  i did n't doubt for a second . 
  well you certainly are living up to the sub 's name . 
  '98 on the train !, 
  as a european , i am very glad about trump . 
  i do n't want rapefugees in my country , no thank you . 
  right now . 
  that will change if these dumbfucks keep letting rapefugees in . 
  look at sweden . 
  well , are n't you all ready up to meltdown in / r/the _ meltdown ... 
  no , my friend , i 'm here to point out trump is not literally hitler . 
  everyone i know ( except one girl ) irl would vote for trump ( if they were in usa ) . 
  / u/spez is too busy prepping the bull to ban that cancer . 
  thought you were going for eu4 reference there , but what is it actually about ? 
  eh , my second guess was civ v. did n't play vi yet . 
  and trump 's the fascist ? 
  same here , i 'm of age , fit , and will build the shit out of that wall in exchange for entering the great country . 
  i assume , based on [ this ] ( https://worldwide.vote/hillary-vs-trump/#/results/total ) , and generally knowing a fair amount about russia , that they 're very similar to ours ( also lmao we beat russia in trump support ) . 
  my entire school was hyped up all day about trump . 
  america 's hated , but that 's because of the leadership ( and also the bombing us part did n't help ) . 
  fun ~ ~ fact ~ ~ assumption based on activity : it gives them way more ( indirect ) revenue than any other shitty subreddit . 
  mate , the sub is very clear about what it is ( a 24/7 trump rally ) . 
  you do n't go to a vegetarian reddit and start talking about how good meat is . 
  you do n't go to a football reddit and talk about basketball . 
  use common sense . 
  also ... that 's not considering how many votes were stolen , and how many dead people were resurrected . 
  it 's actually the complete opposite of what you said . 
  careful to not get too redpilled all at once though . 
  see , your first mistake was doubting / pol / . 
  so assuming this is real , would you happen to know the specific link to that video ? 
  because i would definitely want to know what to avoid . 
  i 'm real glad trump won , but it would have been hilarious if this post itself was premature celebration :d, 
  came somewhere before the end of the primaries i believe . 
  no idea how many there were at that point . 
  i 'm pretty sure it was < 100k . 
   milosevite sebian filth, 
  well , here 's the tolerant left at work here ... serbian deplorable here as well , want to hate on me as well ? 
  wew lad , ca n't decide if you 're a troll or whatever . 
  yes indeed . 
  i am the moron here . 
  calling people names works wonders for converting them to your side , just ask killary . 
  unlike you , i ca n't be assed to look through your post history , so i 'll assume you 're a troll and not respond anymore . 
  well ... i do n't have you on -71 score for nothing ... 
  ah yes , truly the greatest topic , the great war of the two of us . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ shitpost ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ whole ^ ^ ^ ^ lot ... 
  edit : seems i 'm not the only one with a tendency to downvote you :(, 
  and hillary 's health was also a vast right wing conspiracy . 
  ctr exists . 
  it 's been doing work . 
  4chan even found its ' headquarters . 
   better candidate, 
  i wo n't list the ton of stuff that explains why this is wrong , but i 'm pretty sure no ww3 with russia ( trump ) is preferable to ww3 with russia ( hillary ) . 
  it would appear i misunderstood you . 
  any links ? 
  i want to stack up on salt . 
  [ enjoy . 
  man ... do n't even start on the fbi not liking her . 
  she 'd be in jail for life if she was an average person . 
   the donald subredit is a fetid pool of hate , but they are also highly organized , which does n't happen naturally . 
  you underestimate our weaponized autists . 
  got a video buddy ? 
  look at the date then read rule # 1 you piece of shit . 
  can someone explain this new `` fake news '' meme ? 
  where 'd it come from ? 
  still a net loss of 1 coin , as you 're trading a 5 cent bomb for 5 cents ( 0 gain ) versus just picking up 1 coin for free ( 1 gain ) . 
  would have preferred if it were sticky dimes instead . 
  heh , took me a while too . 
  he 's implying misteranchors is the devil . 
  same here . 
  not even american . 
  this place is very high energy . 
  i recognize it by the ui . 
  the game is incredibly fair . 
  you just need to git gud if you want to beat it . 
  bed of chaos ? 
  just posting to check . 
  spez : totally does . 
  `` divided states of america '', 
  fucking cucks ... 
  feels like i 'm in the minority that loved 2016 . 
  and why do you think so ? 
  so i take it you 're not pleased with the political events this year ?
