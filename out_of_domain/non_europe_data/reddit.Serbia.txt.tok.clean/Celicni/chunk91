  it 's a cool but mostly useless item . 
  would rather take than reroll unless i am having a real shit run . 
  [ here 's what happens . 
  it 's not that i `` think '' it . 
  i do sets until failure . 
  but it just occurs so suddenly to me . 
  like i 'll do rep # 5 easily and then rep # 6 is just impossible . 
  this happens with basically everything , but most noticeable in bench press . 
  ran it already . 
  keep playing man , you 're not even a quarter of the way there . 
  and start playing on hard mode once you unlock the real end bosses ( hint : it 's when you have 10 floors to beat instead of the 6 you have now ) . 
  [ solved it by deleting the `` cells '' section of usleep , and then reinstalling it . 
  it seems to be an issue where it was too big .

  on my first playtrough i was intending to go non-lethal , but i killed a few people here and there . 
  i was high chaos until the end of the third mission , at which point i went into low chaos , and remained so until the end of the game . 
  hey , if you do n't mind , could you tell me where you found that stuff out ? 
  you 're not forced into combat at all ... 
  depends how i 'm feeling , but usually around 80-90 kg x6 . 
  i 've been training for like 4 months now , but so have my friends and they do n't seem to have the same problems . 
  you never have to kill anyone in either dishonored 1 or 2 . 
  fashion souls is different though . 
  armor basically does n't matter in that game unlike others . 
  funnily enough , that backfired , seeing as now trump will also go down as a president . 
  i like to read as well mate , do n't think i 'm against reading . 
  but i 'm saying , the kids would read it just to read it . 
  they would n't give it a second thought . 
  they would learn nothing from it because they would n't even try to . 
  really not a big deal either way . 
  i prefer keyboard . 
  but then again i also play dark souls with a keyboard ... 
  it 's on one of the chairs in the dining hall . 
  i believe it 's also on one of the guards . 
  that said i do n't think you even need it to complete the mission . 
  can i get an explanation about the french toast and the syrup ? 
  slow the text down . 
  it 's fine otherwise . 
  yeah , you can really see this in the `` perfect hitbox ds3 '' with the dancer grab . 
  holy shit that hitbox pissed me the fuck off on my sl1 run . 
  like i 'm between her fucking legs and i get grabbed . 
  on low chaos he says he made a machine that made everyone cry or something , and on high he says he built a `` toy '' for a princess , that traumatized her forever . 
  nothing about `` the heart '' . 
  you have to collect all in the `` present '' before you knock out stilton unconscious , because the `` present '' changes when you do . 
  i kinda wan na call / r/thathappened on this ... 
  could have played a shitload of pirated isaac before and just bought it . 
  my man , i have no doubts the screenshot is true . 
  but if i was to buy isaac right now , i 'd probably beat mom in under 20 minutes of played time , since i 've played probably about 500 hours and am currently on a 45 eden streak , on pirated isaac . 
  and could post the absolute same . 
  it 's just really odd someone would be that good/lucky to beat mom immediately . 
  nice job . 
  i 'm on a 46 eden streak myself right now . 
  feels pretty good . 
  angel rooms are actually awesome now . 
  i still go for devil deals most of the time cause damage , but i wo n't take shit like betrayal for precedent , or take a curse of the blind devil deal on basement 2 . 
  take it a step further ( like i am at the time ) : no knockouts . 
  no pickups . 
  no using anything from your quickbar . 
  just google `` nihilist run '' . 
  you 've got that anita chick or whatever her name is to thank for that . 
  she criticized arkane for its ' portrayal of women , so d2 panders a lot to sjw 's with an abnormally high amount of women , bi/gay characters , mindy being trans , and possibly the reason there 's so many black dudes ( though i do n't mind that one so much because it 's a different continent , but i think serkonos is akin to spain/portugal , so still odd ) . 
  also probably why in doto we 're playing a bi , black , disabled woman . 
  fills out basically all sjw checklists . 
  inb4 `` sexist racist homophobe '' : i 've got no issue with there being women in games , but where they fit . 
  never have i complained `` why is it an empress and not an emperor '' . 
  but women simply are n't as physically fit as men are for combat . 
  magic 's explained in-universe . 
  women in city watch positions are n't . 
  in a fictional universe , assume everything is as in ours , unless stated different . 
  it 's stated magic exists . 
  i accept that . 
  there 's nothing saying `` women are as fit as men '' . 
  [ the strongest women are just a little bit stronger than the average man . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/4vcxd0/almost_all_men_are_stronger_than_almost_all_women/ ) strength 's not everything but when you 're crossing swords , it 's a big deal no ? 
  and generally , women are n't fit , do n't have fast reflexes , suck at pe etc. 
  ca n't be assed to google for sources right now but it 's pretty self evident . 
  of course , there 's exceptions that you claim to be , that have the technique or whatever . 
  good for you . 
  but half the fucking veterans in the game are female , that 's a very odd distribution . 
  they 're really not though , as i stated in the comment to the dude above . 
  if you were told you 're gon na be assassinated , would you rather have a woman or a man protecting you , and just be honest . 
  how am i not sticking with my own opinions ? 
  d2 is pandering to sjw 's , directly stated by harvey himself . 
  i do indeed have issues with plenty of things , but women in games is not one of those ... except when they do n't fit . 
  i 've got no issue with them being witches , empresses etc , but not guards that need to be physically fit . 
  `` not in any way shoved in our faces '' . 
  let 's take just one example about aramis stilton being gay :, 
  1 ) the heart says it . 
  2 ) a note says it in the 7th level . 
  3 ) audiograph in the same level says it . 
  4 ) in the same level duke luca abele says it . 
  5 ) when you get aboard the dreadful wale he says it . 
  how is that not shoving it in our faces ? 
  [ there 's entirely different standards for women in combat and law enforcement positions . 
  ] ( http://nypost.com/2015/11/22/struggling-firefighter-injured-after-just-10-days-into-new-job/ ), 
  [ it 's ridiculous . 
  ] ( http://nypost.com/2015/12/27/unfireable-female-firefighter-returns-to-the-fdny/ ), 
  ( i 'm aware the examples are not from combat or law enforcement , but it still applies , just cba to go looking for something ) . 
  let me just ask you : if there was an attempt on your life , would you feel safer with 50 % of the `` elite guard '' guarding you being women , or would you rather they all be muscled , fit , well trained men . 
  and also , hey you 're right , female guards exist because there are female guards . 
  i 'm not at all arguing they exist .
