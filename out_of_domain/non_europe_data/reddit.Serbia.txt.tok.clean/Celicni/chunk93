  [ steam . 
  every single one , every single playtrough . 
  never seen anyone care about her too much , at least not as much as daud . 
  it blows my mind why they went with her as the ** only ** protagonist . 
  like , a duo with daud would have been great . 
  define : `` taking your time '' . 
  did you care about stealth ? 
  did you collect all runes and bonecharms ? 
  robbed black markets ? 
  read anything ? 
  i like to consider myself as very good at dishonored ( which meant almost no reloading ) , and also i play very fast , while still doing everything there is to do . 
  my first playtrough ( on which i did basically everything , collected all pickups , did all sidequests ) took me around 12 hours . 
  i have literally no idea how he managed to do it in 6 , if he `` took his time '' . 
  lmao i had the dark master one . 
  i did n't mention the actual words being used in the interview . 
  just that there were some decisions that were clearly made because of sjw criticism . 
  i have nothing against hypatia . 
  she 's injected with a serum so she gets better physical capabilities . 
  ashworth is a witch , no problem with her being good in a fight . 
  i 'm fine with emily being playable . 
  i always play corvo , but really nothing against a second character . 
  delilah same as ashworth . 
  billie lurk i dislike only because for some reason they 're pushing her so hard to be this badass , that she never was ( see doto ) . 
  but regular women simply are n't as capable as men . 
  and putting them on equal footing as men is simply unrealistic . 
  yeah , but unless stated otherwise , everything is the same as in our world . 
  it 's stated magic exists , so i accept witches and powers . 
  it 's not stated women are somehow better than they are in our world . 
  and as i linked somewhere above , female officers/firefighters/soldiers do exist , but they often go through way less strict requirements . 
  this one took me for a loop as well . 
  it 's unclear , that 's not the point of these puzzles . 
  to op : simplest explanation is that that specific sentence only contains 2 people . 
   someone else carried a valuable snuff tin and when she saw it , the visitor from dunwall next to her almost spilled her neighbor 's absinthe, 
  the first one is unrelated . 
  sentence only contains 2 people . 
  it 's arguable about round 2 , but i do n't see any way for geralt to win round 1 . 
  he ca n't do shit before corvo stops time , he just flicks his hand . 
  even if he drinks the potion somehow ( preparation beforehand ) , bend time lasts 10 seconds , and stuff corvo interacts with is moved through time . 
  so corvo chokes him for 2 seconds to run the potion out , then stabs him when he 's unconscious on the ground . 
  literally no way i 'd make the connection without it . 
  i 'd argue x  .5  0  1  2, 
  kerbal space program , because fucking hell rocket science is hard . 
  am i missing fuel ? 
  am i flying wrong ? 
  what 's the matter ? 
  why ca n't i reach orbit . 
  [ steam id ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/id/celicni ), 
  i 'm fine with either , but if i had to pick then i 'll choose hl pack . . 
  a story from my life eh ? 
  well like 6-7 years ago i went sledding with my friend . 
  we did it for like 2-3 hours and i said it 's time to go home . 
  he insisted `` one more time '' , so we did it once more . 
  then he said `` let 's do it one more time '' . 
  really should n't have . 
  we went too fast , hit a tree that fell over , resulting in him breaking his leg , and me flying over completely and hitting my head ( i was told i was unconscious for like 10 minutes , and still have doubts whether this whole world is just me in a coma ) . 
  so how would i go about doing this ?

  i 'd like dishonored definitive edition please . 
  it 's just such a cool game due to all the powers , and also i love stealth games . 
  the 16th ? 
  happy birthday either way ? 
  serious question here , what is the point of that sub ? 
  nihilist run with ultimate difficulty mod . 
  [ steam id ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/id/celicni ), 
  well it 'd be fun to try out ds2 , as `` one of the hardest games ever '' as i generally like difficult games . 
  and the whole `` zombie '' thing seems cool . 
  it 's been that way for a long while . 
  i remember on some days it gets back to normal ( rarely , when something big happens like the election or when hillary clinton got chucked into a van like a side of beef ) when the shills stop receiving instructions . 
  i 've seen headless horseman many a time but the fallen on basement ? 
  not really . 
  i 've done some minor changes to certain stuff in tes5edit though . 
  [ i turned it into jewelry instead in tes5edit . 
  it did n't work at first , but then i ran the re-proccer and now it does . 
  there 's not major difference between it counting as a circlet and as a head item no ? 
  also did that for all the other dragon masks . 
  how would i copy those files into a new mod ( i just edited skyre_main ) so if someone else wants to use this they can ? 
  yeah i got it working now . 
  just wondering how i would make those changes into a `` new mod '' if anyone has this problem again . 
  [ well here it is . 
  i dunno if it 'll actually work , since i edited skyre itself for me , but meh . ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/85097/ ? ), 
  seriously ? 
  politics on the fucking / r/bindingofisaac ? 
  in d1 it was less than 20 % of the enemies in the levels . 
  in d2 it 's a bit more complicated , as each of the guards has one of three moral standings ( evil , good , or between ) . 
  killing good people raises chaos much more than killing evil people . 
  using the heart tells you which one they are ( subtly ) . 
  so you could kill 5 people and if they 're all good you could end with high chaos , or like 10 and still be in low chaos . 
  the awesome thing about d2 compared to d1 is that even if you 're caught , you do n't have to either kill them or run away . 
  you can choke them mid combat by parrying them and then choking , or running into them and using the choke button . 
  wait , the detective was stolen as a kid , and the nurse `` feels lucky for the one stolen because he did n't grow up with lily '' , yet the detective has lily as the mother ? 
  643 - ryse : son of rome, 
  i 'd like dark souls ii : scholar of the first sin . 
  i 'd like just devil daggers . 
  thanks for the giveaway . 
  thanks . 
  space game stories ? 
  well there was that time i shat my pants from dead space ...
