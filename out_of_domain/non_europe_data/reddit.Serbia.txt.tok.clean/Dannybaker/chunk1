  haha sarmale is actually considered the traditional dish in serbia too ( although it 's turkish , they ruled the balkans ), 
  oh fuck you, 
  i 'm sorry but i do n't think i get what in this pic resembles your nation 's greatness ? 
  supra vaider and/or air force 1 's ? 
  are you kidding me, 
  why the hell would you care about his downvotes ? 
  they 're automatic anyways . . 
  yes i too find cumming in girls mouth very cute, 
  that is not a hobby . 
  collecting skat porn is . 
  this is not . 
  yes , we pronounce niger * nigger * , ha ha . 
  just a question : why did you repost it ? 
  what was the exact reason ? 
  i loved this the most . 
  here in serbia we actually go to the grocery daily . 
  i do n't know if that 's just our thing or . . ? 
  please no god please, 
  so ,8 year old me , in a restaurant with my mom and dad , i see 2 people going in , pulling the guns and shooting 3 guys in the head . 
  they proceed to drag them out of the building and drive away . 
  i saw it all as it was 3 tables from us . 
  what fascinated me the most was the reactions of the people that were shot : as they approached the victims , said something and shot one , he just hit the table with his head , and other 2 guys were just motionless , probably in awe , did n't even have time to react . 
  it happened in about 20 seconds , the all three shots . 
  ofcourse all the people in there went panicking and they used the commotion to get the bodies out . 
  wow 500 comments for 2 or 3 games , seriously ? 
  so you 're basically saying `` hey i made a witty post , everyone ! '', 
  it clearly says 2008 not 12, 
  you got me wrong . 
  i said it says in the description `` photo was taken on february 22 , 2008 '', 
  the talban are in the afghanistan , not iraq . 
  ggw rg triko ' ; / p [ p \\ rwq dz safafgew, 
  and jd sports . 
  and footlocker . 
  should have used imgur i guess, 
  i 'm sorry but why the hell do you care about his up/downvotes ? 
  it 's hardly meaning something . 
  it 's kim han-sol , his grandson , who is in mostar . 
  i am faliing to realize why is this important or post worthy at all, 
  if someone is recommending a 400 $ lacoste cardigan , that does n't mean you have to buy the exact one , just find a cheaper version of it , like h&m or such . 
  you can get a general idea what 's good these days and just shop accordingly . 
  aw shit . 
  well its 6:34 am here , i did n't get any sleep at all , if that counts as an excuse, 
  oh my god , please can anyone confirm there is a episode based on this ? 
  yeah probably what happened . 
  minecraft, 
  santa , no , santa !, 
  * haters gon na make some good points *, 
  yes , and it 's always like that with beth games . 
  they just serve as a base for modding community to actually make something out of it . 
  yes thank you for blaming me for the general crap the history chnl produces these days , after all they just make what dumb people want to see , reality shows and mysteries . 
  also thank you for kindly explaining to me what kind of person i am and that i 'm contributing to a dumbing down of our society with one post on a * fucking website *, 
  yes , they clearly got massacred and shit , but what is weird is there is no bodies or any hard evidence of them being killed ( other than them being missing , ceased to exist ), 
  thank you for contributing to the modern society with your well thought comments . 
  well those and majority of todays games ** are ** fucking horrible , and only way they could be explained properly is dumbing down the review . 
  minecraft, 
  while agreeing on some points , i got ta ask am i a video game hipster if i hate on popular games because i think they are geniunely bad ? 
  exactly . 
  i 'm not sure of what fanboyism are you talking about ? 
  we got people saying shit about skyrim fanboys and we got people saying shit about people saying shit about skyrim . 
  ** oh god **, 
  that 's just you being hyped out . 
  atleast i 'm a sir . 
  super mario is a 90 's game ; i was talking about more recent - console port - games . 
  while i do agree with a majority of the content in that screenshot , and i do not like mw3 , skyrim or bf3 , i would n't really call myself a vg hipster . 
  ( but others would probably ? ), 
  i think the proper tl ; dr would be you are easily disturbed by games and emotionally unstable . 
  that 's 6 words man, 
  you should atleast try skyrim , maybe you 'd like it . 
  you know you could just link this to him and he will see it , no need for it to be on front page . 
  and why would you thank reddit ? 
  oh god, 
  did you know that baby cobras can kill a man and carry equal amount of poison as the grown ups ? 
  i 'm from serbia ( ex yugoslavia ) , and they still produce yugo . 
  and yes , it 's still piece of shit it was 30 years ago . 
  it does have . 
  insurance frauds . 
  there were loads of them in russia so they made every car with insurance have a dash camera . 
  guess i did n't know they stopped making yugo in 2008 . 
  thanks, 
  it 's the op 's blog just so you all know . 
  care to explain to me what are you getting out of their tour in afghanistan ? 
  it 's actually because there was some hl2 content on the front page , everyone thought they could get on there too , so they just followed with screenshots . 
  do n't remember when i was that angry at a game . 
  i miss that . 
  i 'm sorry but you are not straight, 
  if you learn it on reddit , does it really count as til because it 's on reddit again ? 
  can anyone explain to me what were the japanese soldiers doing ? 
  i mean out of 100 soldiers no one shot him ? 
  were they carying guns or throwing cake at him ?
