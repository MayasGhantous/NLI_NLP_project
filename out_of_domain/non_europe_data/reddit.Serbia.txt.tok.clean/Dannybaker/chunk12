  arnold wins over zyzz by being alive tho, 
  right click on part1 and choose extract , it will make a folder with all the files necessary,

  no problemo ryan, 
  what ? 
  you 're as retarded as him with your statement, 
  what would you want fifa to do ? 
  but they steal had to splash out major cash for other players before 4-5 seasons , they had the biggest transfers in the 90 's . 
  what science did you acquire ? 
  i do n't think you 're any smarter now having stayed up late and watching this, 
  also , it 's guardian , i doubt it 's true, 
  do you have anything to do with this , or science ? 
  what . . 
  they are excited because other people are excited , and those others are because someone else was , it all goes around , majority of people posting here did n't know about curiosity , or simply didnt give a fuck, 
  how does this have 600 points,

  who is we ? 
  you did n't do shit , it 's all done by nasa, 
  to you, 
  are you fucking stupid, 
  maybe on camp nou, 
  if it 's a honest advice , who cares on what subreddit it 's posted ? 
  after all , you put a picture of you on the internet , you should expect this . 
  it 's silly that you 're not okay with advice just because it 's on different subreddit and you want to put actual rules about advices . 
  also ,, 
   however it got me to thinking if i 'm getting these types of comments other people maybe too . 
  other people may have ** self esteem issues ** . 
  may be ** self conscious ** . 
  may not be able to handling these kind of comments . 
  you mean you ? 
  no ones attacking you . . 
  how can you judge a tone of the text response for fucks sake ? 
  also name calling ? 
  where did the person use name calling ? 
  he just said get a better haircut ? 
  what the fuck is wrong with that ? 
  so they ca n't say that it 's not nice ? 
  you people will not get far in life if you whine about every negative thing someone says to you, 
  attention obviously, 
  but they ca n't ? 
  could you explain why they ca n't joke about it without being racist ? 
  found [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mgefz.png ) ** gem ** in freekarma, 
  the point is they dont give a fuck about gays , they are just cashing in on it , but if that 's okay with gay community then . . 
  `` you guys '' is a 5million people `` community '', 
  i think it 's obvious that / r/trees would advocate weed use , so i do n't see a point in this thread ? 
  that 's what i was thinking but i wont argue , atleast on cb, 
  yes , i noticed exactly that . 
  there 's 2 or 3 posts here saying skyrim and they are downvoted heavily, 
  what ? 
  opinions that differ from the general hivemind here are downvoted just as anywhere on reddit, 
  here 's the picture of the moment he broke the leg ( might be nsfw ` ish ), 
  how familiar with football are you ? 
  / r/soccer is so better than rest of reddit amirite guys check out this fag doesnt know hamburger lol downvote, 
  why is only rangers without a crest ? 
  this question is posted like 3 times a week , you could really search this sub , the answers are always the same, 
  well it was the first time for him, 
  no , you ca n't set the new game to begin in 2012 , the game was made for 2011 season , so there is no option to change that . 
   fuck you all usa baby, 
  what, 
  dat popped collar, 
  if it was in the right subreddit why would you x-post it ? 
  glad you put nbc bad circlejerk in this, 
  why ? 
  because they won ? 
  there 's no conversations , everyone is telling their stories , the op almost always doesnt give a fuck about your story , they just want to share theirs . 
  which can only you see, 
  but what is a dog doing in sauna ? 
  [ this ] ( http://www.topito.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/marseille-ext%c3%87rieur-e1343119451935.jpg ) is a lovely kit , it seems to me some people just hate om , and why is that ? 
  you can add jordi alba too, 
  holy shit , i used fmrte in fm2012 to add money to my team and still did n't spend 382 mill, 
  because you did the same thing, 
  but they did receive , by selling players, 
  caulker a beast on fm , going by logic he 's got ta be good irl, 
  how many diarras there are jesus, 
  5mill is what city wanted iirc, 
  but bassong in there and you got a deal, 
  abramovich spent $ 1.02 billion since he took over , since then you have won uefa champions league , the premier league 3 times , the fa cup 4 times and the league cup twice , you did the same thing , but achieved more . 
  when city win 3 pl 's and cl pretty sure you will be forgotten . 
  no fuck you this is my time for glory, 
  jokes aside , that 's clear 20mill profit , i would be bragging and making threads if i was you,

  i 'm pretty sure you 're horribly wrong, 
  regards, 
  regards, 
  these are not athletic shoes , and i can tell you as a sneakerhead , that about 80 % of current shoes are re-releases from the 80 's and 90 's .

  couple of reeboks in that picture too , still popular today, 
  fifa 12 mate, 
  why should we care about him ? 
  he 's trying hard to get karma/attention or what not . 
  and just because someone does n't like him it means they 're jumping on the bandwagon ? 
  theync, 
  violin !, 
  are you serious ? 
  maybe his comments are , but there 's always guys like the guy above contributing nothing with no body cares apostolate amirite, 
  also suggesting that he contributes more than me and you ? 
  its like people are actually original on reddit, 
  how was this not common knowledge ?
