  are you actually asking what reddit thinks of your ** 2378 $ ** build ? 
  i ca n't possibly imagine any game using the full power of your new pc and you know it yet you just posted it here to brag that you have a 2k $ build that games wont utilize for about 3 more years, 
  compares to what ? 
  you 've got the best components on the market , but if it 's for video rendering then okay . 
  til about live for speed, 
  g620 dual core, 
  h61 motherboard, 
  5670 gpu, 
  you seriously do n't know what the currency is ? 
  the hdd is n't avail anymore , and it was too cheap to be true . 
  why the z68 board when the cpu doesnt support oc-ing ? 
  you funny man . 
  please reply to this comment so i can feel loved, 
  combo breaker motherfucke-all glory to the hypnotoad, 
  it is mentioned twice in the picture . 
  i didnt get any of it, 
  your mother is not a racist, 
  what . . 
  so let me get this straight . 
  you posted this in r/pics but thought you did n't have enough upvotes so you reposted it here ? 
  how would you know ? 
  i love the ww2 and vietnam period but you dont see me with a m16 and a mk2 helmet with `` war is hell '' on it, 
  it was a joke but oh well, 
  not in ministry of silly outfits, 
  why is he suddenly black ? 
  ah , the . . no fuck you, 
  `` great country '', 
  im sorry , i cant hear you over my free healthcare and non retarded politicians, 
  yet it isnt all about you, 
  well thats like your opinion brasil . . 
  pie flavor, 
  and ? 
  i imagined them talking in australian accent, 
  i love how you included skyrim as if that was relevant at all just because it 's a popular game, 
  who said she isnt ? 
  tagging alll the pretty girls with [ reddit enhancement suite ] ( http://redditenhancementsuite.com ) so i can upvote and try to talk to them later, 
  just explain me why you mentioned skyrim and ill be happy, 
  its 33.49 euros here in europe ( that is the price on sale which is 53 $ ) . 
  you surely mean [ reddit enhancement suite ] ( http://redditenhancementsuite.com ) ? 
  price on sale is ** 33,49 euros ** = ** 53usd ** . 
  price on sale in usa is ** 39.99 usd **, 
  should be . 
  fuck you, 
  they thought the pie i baked was delicious, 
  * it was n't pie *, 
  be sure to make a new post with this image and get some karma, 
  ** his point is that you ca n't tell how old your parents are from one picture of their backs **, 
  so is ts3 ? 
  great so i 'll just generalize as you do and call all sa members undeveloped neckbeards incapable of using anything else except for memes in communication . 
  or i could pay 10 $ and get banned for insulting moderators feelings on a very elite forum, 
  we could go visit ron paul after laughing at religious nuts and distributing some cp after eh ? 
  how great, 
  nov 05 , 2009, 
  dear reddit , sorry i got your child porn subreddits shut down , i feel real bad about it and hahahahaha just kidding you suck, 
  he ** paid ** money so he could post this . 
  i may turn this into shit sa retard says ? 
  yes , in the competitive scene the microsoft wmo and intelli mice are highly regarded as the best mice ever, 
  yes because scott is a common serbian name, 
  now give me 100 $, 
  this was posted yesterday . . 
  x-post this to [ / r/creepy ] ( / r/creepy ), 
  * secretly wishes for someone to buy him reddit gold *, 
  i love how i just pointed that he had xd in his post and i got downovted . 
  shouldve had a quote mark eh ? 
  may i ask where are you from ? 
  are you serious ? 
  also , there is a large modding community for coh , so now you have eastern front mod or blitzkrieg that has altered weapon damage ( more realistic ) and lots of balancing done . 
  ** earphone **, 
  dannyb from cadred xoxo, 
  yes , because people who do n't agree with your are cowards, 
  [ gazelles ] ( http://www.eukicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/adidas-gazelle-2.jpg ), 
  might buy both pairs, 
  both, 
  lots of things are and you cant do shit about it, 
  why do you assume nerds downvoted you ? 
  are you implying that only nerds can downvote or what ? 
  wow, 
  you, 
  just no . . 
  are you actually that stupid ? 
  whats the capital of jerusalem again ? 
  you probably are n't stupid , but that comment made you look like you were . 
  read it again and in it lies the reasons why i thought you were . 
  you mentioned karma `` i have no idea why you have been downvoted '', 
  that means you bring it up first . 
  wow please stop you 're really putting too much into winning a internet battle . 
  you stated that he got downvoted because he 's christian and reddit has no tolerance for anyone but atheists . 
  you never thought anyone would disagree with them without religion interfering ? 
  what i am not using any tactic or anything . 
  your comment was stupid because you stated something that is not true ( christians not being tolerated ), 
  now you could stop arguing over useless stuff and accept that you were wrong or we could do this all night, 
  what the fuck am i reading ? 
  i dont really have will to argue with you and thanks for all the advices . 
  ill just point something out . 
  you first mentioned downvoting , and now christians arent tolerated . 
  how is that discussing the topic of french journalists ? 
  also , unprovoked ? 
  you said something that is fucking stupid , and that was not your opinion , but a fact you stated that was completely untrue . 
  if you 're caring so much for opinions , why the fuck did you comment on those downvotes ? 
  people disagree and downvote.it 's their right to do that , who are you to say why did they do it ?
