  did you just discover fight club ? 
  what kind of questions are those , oh god are you 10 ? 
  and he still got the answers . . sigh, 
  in the video he says those are movies made after 1992, 
   tarantino rattled off a list of his 20 favorite films since 1992 -- the year he made his directorial debut with `` reservoir dogs '', 
   playing with friends is the best part about playing * any game *, 
  you might say this subreddit is ... in danger zone ? 
  what sexist crap ? 
  what , but they are mentioned ? 
  i really think there 's nothing sexist in choosing which girl is the hottest . . 
  you 're in a sub about sexy pics of alison brie yet you complain that the site who lists the hot women is sexist by not mentioning their careers ? 
  how is that even logical ? 
   faith in humanity restored, 
  you just linked his whole wikipedia page ? 
  respect to the guy wanting to rescue his comrade , takes balls to do that and i surely would n't dare try it . 
  also worth mentioning is his comrade in black trying to draw fire by coming out of cover . 
  regardless of which side and what ideology they support , that was a brave attempt imo . 
  i do n't get it, 
  oh c'mon , you really cried while playing bastion ? 
  i know right . . i thought it was a cool game with a nice story , certainly not worth crying over it . . 
  also i love silent downvotes, 
  that 's a mustache not a beard ( obviously ), 
  but it does n't really belong here , but seeing it is a popular show on reddit . . sigh, 
  aw shit, 
  what are you trying to make fun of ? 
  he sure did grab those 17 points . . 
  wow you spelled crisis correctly, 
  think of all the karma he 's risking, 
  i do n't think so . . they filmed this in . gif format so we 're all waiting for for some good soul to convert it to video, 
  yes but you probably wouldnt give a shit about family guy, 
  who 's them ? 
  what the fuck is wrong with your screen, 
   then there 's lots of smoke coming from the impact point ... likely from its engine . 
  i believe its using his smoke screen, 
  well thanks for that , if even americans abandon their elderly , i think it 's not of a big deal anymore, 
  but you capitalized we , like `` even we americans do it , it 's really serious then '' , as if you are the bastion of humanity, 
  nope , too late already angry and downvoted you . 
  dont you dare use reason, 
  hard to say . 
  the ** fsa ** or the * free syrian army * are syrian people and foreign terrorist organizations fighting to overthrow ** assad ** ( who is himself a major terrorist and a horrible dictator ) and his ** saa ** ( * syrian arab army * ) . 
  if the fsa wins they will most definitely create a religious tribal country where the assad forces are forbidden to yell religious chants and people are generally not killed for religious reasons , contrary to fsa who has reportedly shot people for not joining them or being non muslims . 
  tl ; dr they are good and bad people on both sides , no one is `` right '' and the civilians as always are getting fucked up by both . 
  i do n't give a fuck, 
  i really remember these vividly , i was 6 during the 1999 nato bombing of yugoslavia , these still scare the shit out of me, 
  edit : check out this creepy siren from israel, 
  yes we can read the youtube comments, 
  i do n't get it , what are haters supposed to hate ? 
  oh god , looking at our defense , i do n't really know how we failed to qualify for euros and not looking good for the next wc either . . 
  probably because we need goals to win ? 
  sigh, 
  lol op you might as well link the whole channel and stop posting the videos individually, 
  why do people on reddit use the - now already generic - `` more than it should have '' thing ? 
  i did n't see it anywhere else, 
  oh god i laughed at your comment probably more than i should have, 
  phaha you seem upset, 
  i 'm not raging or cringing because he 's 15, 
  maybe it 's a dressed.so post and he swirls his face there , but the 2nd pic is only for us ? 
  life is life, 
  no , science fiction, 
  you should, 
  he baught them like a bauss, 
  from the creators of * earth *, 
  no it 's not , it 's white but the pictures are shitty, 
  yep , as mentioned , this is a game and standard rules of physics does n't apply in arma, 
  nice tips , cheers, 
  so edgy, 
  it does n't, 
  comedy gold, 
  you just did, 
  i want cs go and arma co , both are on sale but i got no money . 
  luckily they are on sale till 3rd january so i could probably steal some money by then, 
  ww2 was the last real war , other than that they were all proxy wars vs russia, 
  [ how is babby formed ] ( http://i4.ytimg.com/vi/w_rapoovx1y/hqdefault.jpg ), 
  wow i forgot about her, 
  i do n't remember saying anything about casualties , i was talking about the reasons us is in the war . 
  in ww2 they were helping allies fight off a lunatic with a master plan of exterminating a race, 
  in others on the other hand . . makes it even more sadder that people are dying in wars that are ( for us civilians ) pointless . 
  shit , 1am and didnt read it properly, 
  i did . 
  where are my free games, 
  edit : i 'm kidding wow . . btw user above gifted me a game and i would like to thank him here . 
  you 're the best . 
  hello, 
   the ui almost seems like it was designed for consoles and controllers, 
  it was, 
  what does dishonored have to do with it, 
  i love how you took a screenshot of your whole library to show off your games :d, 
  you again, 
  err i remember playing the game around 2008-2009 and there was a site by thq with all patches listed in the order you need to install them . 
  was n't that hard at all, 
  it 's still june :d, 
  that 's a scripted event, 
  this was cringe gold, 
  thank you for entertainment, 
  i think this is the # 1 generic comment on reddit, 
  are you serious ? 
  in every country i 've been the exit is in english, 
  did he hook up with a girl you like but never asked out and now you 're mad ? 
  sounds like you really have a problem with him . 
  now i 'm not saying that these pictures and memes are not stupid , but you really sound bitter in that first post and that you are just using this to vent .
