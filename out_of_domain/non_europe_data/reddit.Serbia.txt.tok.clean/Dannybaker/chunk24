  it 's about rivaldo ? 
  rpg 's are seriously not the top tier weapons of fsa . 
  have you seen bunch of videos of russian anti tank systems like, 
  they do have all the weapons the army has because they captured a number of their bases , warehouses and weapon storages, 
  because not everyone is american, 
  are n't there rich arabs putting money into clubs and buying everything they can get ? 
  is n't that what is on the banner ?

  what the fuck ? 
  if he 's subbed off 90 % of the time then there 's got to be someone being subbed on 90 % of the time, 
  then who was sub ? 
  i 'm downvoting him and i love it, 
  serbia had a good squad on paper for euros 2012 quali yet we finished 3rd, 
  just look at our defense then, 
  ivanovic , subotic , vidic , kolarov , also nastasic, 
  then we had stankovic , ljajic , sulejmani , tosic , krasic , lazovic . . 
  not all of them were really world class players , but still not to get into euros . . 
  i am sad now great, 
  i was n't serious . . 
  everything is gone, 
  also there 's nothing in this explosion that looks like an atomic one, 
  yes, 
  is joke you laugh yes, 
  yes, 
  and reddit is not like that ? 
  tough crowd, 
  this is a parody , right ? 
  how do you know how much you should laugh ? 
  that 's fake too . .

  i thought that recognizing spanish , french or italian was common knowledge . . 
  it 's probably the swedish lynx, 
  what do you wear then daily ? 
  - so how do you see ? 
  - * i do n't *, 
  did you rob a bank or what, 
  ah , great stuff , what do you do btw ? 
  note to self , finish consulting college and buy everything, 
  so it 's not logical to you that one american , or western european knows a difference between spanish and italian , opposed to knowing a difference between russian and georgian ? 
  haha , no , i 'm actually slavic , from serbia , but i thought that it 's common sense for people to know the differences between french or italian . 
  of course your average westerner is not required to know a difference between latvian or georgian or belorussian, 
  haha , it sure is a greeting, 
  you just said in the title it was a missile, 
  holy fuck the comments here are retarded , what a cesspool of unoriginal allah snackbar jokes,

  so you wo n't feel bad for an syrian army soldier ? 
  he can get so much money out of these transfers it 's amazing, 
  as i see we evolved from the `` i laughed more than i should have '' phrase, 
  what about adidas gazelle 's ? 
  yes , the game is heavily scripted .
