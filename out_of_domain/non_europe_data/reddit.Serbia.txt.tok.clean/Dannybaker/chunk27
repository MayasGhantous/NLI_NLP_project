  have a nice coffee too, 
  wow , nice job comparing trained pmc 's with ordinary people and some militants, 
  your comment made me rage, 
  why are you offended ? 
   the stories and information posted here are artistic works of fiction and falsehood . 
  only a fool would take anything posted here as fact . 
  could you explain your routine a bit ? 
  i 'm at 83kg atm and i would like to lose like 10 or 15kgs max, 
  or mouthinho as intented ? 
  do you actually think people only lie on / b / ? 
   `` the vitality of bad taste should not be underestimated . 
  as an example let me state a personal experience -- a poster for the film ko to tamo peva ( who sings over there ) . 
  in now distant 1980 , i invited a young designer from zagreb , mirko ili\u0107 , to make a poster for the film , which he did -- creating a spare , modern poster , which still appears powerful today . 
  at a screening of this film in france , a year later , the director of the festival excitedly ripped the poster out of my hands , and later sent me a postcard of the poster , framed , hanging on the wall of her living room . 
  however , the film producers have never been satisfied with this modern design solution and , twenty years later , while preparing the dvd release of the same film , they finally imposed their own `` hick '' solution to the cover design . 
  regardless of the fact that the film , wrapped in ili\u0107 's design , earned them an unprecedented amount of money , they could n't sit still until they 'd expressed their kitsch sensibility and shared it with the general audience . 
  yes , the persistence of bad taste and poor design in our surroundings should not be underestimated . '', 
  i `` novi '' poster, 
  it 's not about karma , it 's about attention, 
   zombies everywhere .

  this is a tasty goal, 
  that it 's a deserved red card , even if he did not have the intent , he hit him and it 's a dangerous play, 
  wow you put 2 shitty phrases in 5 words, 
  . . how the fack could i know, 
  why do n't we see guys telling girls to go to gonewild ? 
  in ** my ** honest opinion , i really think that this picture is too personal to be shared with the internet , but it 's yours and you have the right to . 
  i just know ** i ** surely would n't . 
  also sorry for your loss . 
  you did good son, 
  you mean swoosh, 
  how is it possible that almost every one of them have fatal head injuries ? 
  use adblock and block everything cept videos on theync, 
  u pravu si, 
  no i rage more on career , that scripted ai argh, 
  take a fucking break you 're obviously really mad at the game , i would suggest you to stop playing for a while instead of whining here, 
  yes, 
  your mom, 
  the name is probably licensed or something , so they ca n't use real names , although some rifles have real life logos, 
  have you tried stronghold games ? 
  ah try the first one , i have n't tried the latest one , but the general opinion is that it 's shit . 
  in the first one you do everything by yourself iirc, 
  wait you really do n't know or that was rhetorical, 
  thank you for your advice, 
  yes you are the only one in the world with that opinion, 
  are you actually saying that this game is more powerful than apocalypse now ? 
  is there a scale somewhere that shows how much can you laugh, 
  as opposed to figuratively, 
  only 4 french casualties so far , i think they 're doing great out there , fighting al-qaeda, 
  uhm why ? 
  than *, 
  everything here is, 
  is n't that the point of this submission, 
  dal lik ima majicu `` keep calm and seed '' ? 
  that is not how fake accounts work , they try to make it less obvious , and i ca n't find that video of that white rapper kid that had fake comments , but they were vietnamese or something , no one will make fake accounts with name < artist 's  fan, 
  are you a homosexual, 
  gin gwai ( the eye ), 
  hated the us remake with alba, 
  someone is a virgin, 
  so you decided to shame him on the internet , right this makes you better than him . . 
  i love how many posts here are actually personal , which is not really what this sub is all about , and are just seeking acknowledgment that the person posted is a shitty human being . . 
  this is not what this sub is about . . 
  also he 's fat and ugly which makes it easier to hate him, 
  why do n't you then ? 
   i bet these people are way more genuine and interesting and have a much richer life than you can boast of . 
  what a stupid thing to say, 
  you played too much cod, 
  you should move out and your mom is telling you that for the past 30 years ( yes 30 ), 
  why would you jump from your house what is going on, 
   to make a simple analogy , postprocessing effects in enb and sweetfx are like instagram for games . 
  they do nothing to core renderer,
