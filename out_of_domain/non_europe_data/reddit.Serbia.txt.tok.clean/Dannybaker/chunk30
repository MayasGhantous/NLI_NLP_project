  ( not even a comic ), 
  it 's just a often use phrase in polandball form . . 
  so if i did one for allah snackbar and just drew a guy with an ak it 'll be alright ? 
  it 's probably a reddit/internet thing then , because never in my life i have heard anyone call a war `` cringe worthy '', 
  uncheck `` disable scripts '', 
  yes, 
  not anymore , retired from international football after missing a penalty that would lead us to euros 2012, 
  still a good player tho, 
  join us in bashing politicians in / r/serbia, 
  ... i know but this is n't even a comic it 's just a picture of north korea best korea which is getting overused a lot, 
  if people wo n't play sp , why are you complaining ? 
  just do n't play the boring sp campaign and play mp, 
   it 's not about who gets the first shot off like games such as ** cod ** it 's about skill / strafing / burst firing . 
  he compared it to cod , only comparison to cs was the pace, 
  that 's sp , things are different in mp, 
   i 'm sure will keep me entertained for years to come so i no longer have to put up with the pile of shit battlefield 's turned into, 
  wow the shit you put up with . . 
  out of all things in this trailer , including falling from a 5 story building and surviving a burst from a helicopter machinegun , you actually say that ** in a game ** ( which is not real life ) ** they should lose hearing after firing a gun in a car **, 
  ** in a fucking game **, 
  loved the `` girls just wan na have fun '' and `` fortunate son '', 
  so there are differences then lol you just said it, 
  i wonder how many of those in the picture enlisted and survived the war, 
  that 's so cheesy, 
  just stop , what are you even trying to prove, 
  that 's a fucked up thing to say , and you are a horrible person , he has his opinion on abortion and you have yours , no need to wish he was never born . 
  what 's wrong with you people, 
  no you wont, 
  20h on bioshock 1 what ? 
  i remember it being shorter than that, 
  no , you are not some martyr that goes against reddit 's opinion , there 's a reason you 're dowvnoted and that 's because half of your posts are are fucking retarded , starting with you beating your girlfriend if she aborted to some nonsense about that guy dying in a car accident . . 
  yes give or take couple of dollars, 
  how is he a white knight ? 
  who are those people ? 
  i really hate them . 
  ~ so minimalistic ~, 
  it says 2000 on the camera , and they really look well armed in this video , did n't know that they 're so well equipped !, 
  nice video, 
  it is planet, 
  where the fuck did he say all weed smokers ? 
  he talks about / r/trees, 
  what do you mean in fifa 04 ? 
  what the fuck , you came to iraq and you 're on the defensive ? 
  they 're not that stupid , i doubt it can seriously hurt itself, 
  that 's exactly what neckbeard is . . what 's in your opinion a definition of neckbeard ? 
  i would suggest you to delete this comment as there 's just too much ignorance in it and you will just embarrass yourself . . 
  anyway, 
   our mission , whether you like it , whether you believe it , was to break down the taliban, 
  i was talking about iraq , there are no taliban in iraq . . 
   the taliban really hate any form of western progress , which is why 9/11 happened . 
  al qaeda did the 9/11 attacks , not the taliban, 
   they almost never go out to purposely find insurgents . 
  hence , defensive, 
  yes they do , very often too . . 
  there 's even more but it 's 4am here . 
  i wonder where did you get your info ? 
  bro you need to maintain, 
  haha i know , but he 's saying like they only appeared in fifa , not in real world, 
  i agree and do n't you upvote me !, 
  i do n't know what he 's talking about , handballs are still in game, 
  really ? 
  in 2 consecutive careers i had job offers from them . . 
  first one was when i was playing with wfl wolsfburg and i was 2nd in the league and in january window barca offered me a job . 
  i accepted and they were 6th in the league , with muniesa and bartra as starting cb 's , with puyol and pique without a cap ( note it was 1st of february by then ) and mascherano sold . 
  with him gone for 30mill and no spending that season the next season i had a budget of 200mill euros and about 5mill on wages , and by then it become boring because i could get anyone i want . . 
  pinto was the gk and for some reason adriano ( the lb ) had 16 goals and ended up being the top scorer for barca that season . . next window i had about 15 offers for him , all in 2mill range . . 
  on a side note i got a job offer from manchester united at the same time , january 1st , and they had lindegaard as the gk , with de gea in reserves . . 
  one thing i noticed is that when i was doing allright with lower and mid table teams , they would offer me jobs more often compared to when i play with the top 10 teams , in which in my case they do n't offer them at all, 
  ** tl ; dr play with mid and low table teams , if you do well you will get offers from good clubs . 
  why are you so defensive of this ? 
  are you one of those people ? 
  i can hate people even if i do n't know them , you know that right ? 
  it 's my right to and i do n't really need to explain myself to you, 
  personally i feel sad for the people of nk , but not for their leaders . . 
  check the link, 
  tunnel snakes rule, 
  but why are you offended ? 
  i have my right to hate them , and that does n't affect you in any way . . 
  they they get drafted to vietnam, 
  no they 're not , stop . 
  no need to call them ugly just because you disagree, 
  loading character data, 
  '' ... haha '', 
  how is he a model ? 
  are n't models supposed to have like nice facial structures, 
  his face is horrible, 
  well if by anything you mean butter layered popcorn then yes , do n't enjoy anything in life at all, 
  sounds good . 
  :d :d :d :, 
  so far you 're doing good karma wise . . 
  what about pictures of my friends ? 
  everton get your shit together, 
  how is the nk story funnier ? 
  do you know how many people are brainwashed and living in poverty there ? 
  not to mention the death camps, 
  imagine going there after the fire was put out and seeing 31 bodies in that tight space, 
  90 % they 're fakes . . 
   also , when were sneakers regarded high fucking fashion ?!, 
  i take it you 're not into fashion then ? 
  why the fuck did you post it then if you thought it 's funny ? 
  this is not cringe,
