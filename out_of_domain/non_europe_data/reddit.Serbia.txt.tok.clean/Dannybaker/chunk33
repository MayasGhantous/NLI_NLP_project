   more feels are given to the child . 
  ugh what, 
  how does that change his post ? 
  because everyone who ca n't spot a difference between a civilian semi auto and an assault rifle is a moron ? 
  oh wow he 's complaining about downvotes , better show him with this overused image macro, 
  i want to show this to people who comment about allahu ackbars, 
  wait bosingwa is playing for partizan ? 
  guys how much money should i put on roma winning, 
  haha it 's a joke , but glad to see another partizan fan here, 
  cheers, 
  * twix *, 
  indeed, 
  haha that 's just naive, 
  but it was proposed . 
  by people . 
  to kill other people from their country . 
  so there you go people actually wanted to do it . 
  alright , but i could n't live with my government considering killing its civilians for military gains, 
  i guess you 're right about that . . 
  you just repeated what the guy above said before you, 
  like 90 % of the comments on reddit, 
  or fuck zaha and use him as a sub which is what he will be next season obviously, 
  you wot mate, 
  i would rather have 20 goals , that 's his job , other players are there for tactical and defensive work, 
  shame on you !, 
  or awesome if you were a nazi, 
  that looks like an apc round , i really think it 's too small for a tank round, 
  how is there no people now yelling that this is insensitive and `` too soon '' ? 
  some reports say up to 40 people died, 
  a username that will generate comments like yours so he gets attention, 
  so this is okay but joking about boston bombings is n't ? 
  but he is 78 on fifa and has amazing pace ... 
  what are the benefits compared to regular multiplayer ? 
  pump up the bass, 
  if you go to transfers  sell players , in the upper right is a counter of how many players you have and how many in total you can have . 
  you can have 42 iirc, 
  yeah i am aware , and used hamachi for a while , but was asking in this specific game , as he has a steam , and probably sr3 on steam, 
  no but we are on reddit and they are n't . . they are not really that smart . . / s, 
  wow so this sub became a place where you put other people that you do n't like for others to laugh at . . great you succeeded , you 're a nice person and he 's a shitty one . . good fucking job, 
  and this sounds like exactly something i would make up to make reddit hate him, 
  yeah but this `` does n't add anything to the conversation '' . . 
  meanwhile puns and all caps insulting names are the best, 
  jokes on them i was only pretending, 
  and i see your comment everywhere on reddit , too, 
  looks like uefa badge haha, 
   how about letting the community decide what to appear in the subreddit ? 
  no , there are rules for a reason, 
  but that 's not a meme, 
  big whoop , wan na fight about it ? 
  haha i do n't really know the real definition of a meme , but i was under the impression that those image macros that go viral and everyone starts using them are . 
  the pengiun of doom is just a copypasta i suppose ? 
  what why cloak, 
  yep , it 's a meme then !, 
  ^ fuck ^ you, 
  you are always welcome to take it to / r/karmacourt then, 
  because letting people vote on reddit is a horrible idea , and it 's best seen when a post has 2000 + upvotes but all the comments inside the thread are negative and calling out the op . 
  without rules , it will just become a place where people post random images of annoying people , 4pannels and 14 year olds being obnoxious, 
  i see your point but sometimes you have to moderate , and not let the general public decide on their own . . 
  great , you should n't, 
  i think it 's enough, 
  so you put it into a meme form , along with calling it a gem . . 
  is that satire or what, 
  i 'm trying to figure what is it in the op 's profile picture, 
  go ahead and unfriend her, 
  haha this is gold, 
  why do you go on / r/gaming then, 
  so every member of lapd deserves to die or what, 
  yourthirdbestfriend, 
   i get it you are trying to get downvotes , but your jokes are really really bad, 
  then he 's doing it right, 
  dude , how about you stop basing your opinions of users by amount of karma they have, 
  i can see that you have plenty of it and are somewhat obsessed , by the looks of it , but not everyone gives a fuck about link and comment karma, 
  why do you think that ? 
  i think you got the wrong person , i just jumped in because this is the 2nd person you responded to , and your main argument for both is how they do n't have enough link karma . 
  and by looking at your post history , because you did that to the others , you post shit all day to tens of subreddits , and call others out when they criticize because they do n't . . 
  alright but is that really important ? 
  how about we enjoy the tale ? 
  why not ? 
  there 's no danger in a flare . . do you know how a flare looks or behaves ? 
  it 's not really dangerous and it looks good when lit in hundreds, 
  there is not `` that much fire '' they are hand held flares , which are not dangerous at all , unless you stick one in someones mouth . .

  hivemind based ? 
  what the fuck ? 
  maybe if you thought outside of reddit bubble you would see my point . . 
  if used properly and with a bit of common sense it 's not dangerous at all , it 's not fireworks or those mini bombs or whatever they are called . . 
  of course there is smoke and if you stick one in someones face they could get burnt but overall it 's not really that big of a deal, 
   mirror 's edge : everyone else seems to hate it ,, 
  not sure if you 're aware , but it 's really praised here on reddit, 
  and i 'm not really thinking of reddit only , if you look at mirrors edge metacritic score its in the 80 's and user score is 8.3 which is not nearly a bad game , but somehow just did n't sell enough iirc, 
  that 's actually not fake , and there 's some proof, 
  you can find more on it here, 
  oh boy this is golden, 
   lost a ton of respect for europeans hahaha, 
  why would you believe anything he says ? 
  players lie every day, 
  yes you are a great liar, 
  ah alright then , i 'm just a a bit more cynical now , after we had jovetic and ljajic say exactly that and then go at the end of the season . . 
  but villa is not partizan so yeah good luck with him :d, 
  tell me more,
