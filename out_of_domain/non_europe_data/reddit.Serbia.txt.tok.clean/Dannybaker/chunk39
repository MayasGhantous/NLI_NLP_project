  wow i came so funny amirite my 14 year old friends, 
  i do n't see how it 's `` bandwagoning '' ? 
  if a team does good , you would expect its value to rise , and vice versa, 
  so anyone who is n't `` a nerd '' is a jock ? 
  monaco is not a small team, 
  jesus these are some of the worst comments i 've ever seen on here, 
  heh , look whos talking a psg fan !, 
  i only heard of you since those arabs bought you !, 
  i love when people try to act sympathetic over a `` serious '' case like this but then use overused internet memes or phrases or whatnot . . 
  `` right in the feels '', 
  `` onions ', 
  i would understand if you were 12 or 15 and you did n't know any other means to express yourself but trough memes but seriously . . 
  i 'm pretty sure being in ligue 2 had something to do with that, 
  stfu i relegate u, 
  you are complaining about something that did n't even start, 
  are you fucking kidding me ? 
  expressing in yourself in memes should n't be appropriate ever , unless you 're under 12, 
  are there any subs on reddit where i can escape the bullshit that 's spewed in default subs . . 
  i guess not, 
   your opinion of what we say . 
  who 's we ? 
  the folks that use memes to express themselves ? 
  i 'd rather not have anything to do with you, 
  they are now , but they were bought by some sheikh couple of years ago . 
  like a goal line clearance ? 
  i do n't really see a problem in that . . their aim is to increase the popularity of the club and its success . . that obviously means new fans , and nothing wrong in that, 
   ( they do n't need support , they have a russian multibillionaire owner ), 
  chelsea have it too , that means they should n't have supporters either ? 
  stadium did n't sell out because they were in the ligue 2 , and what rich guy from monaco would like to go and watch ligue 2 teams ? 
  how about our back four on paper ? 
  ( serbia ) :(, 
  haha i agree , tried to be cheeky sorry, 
  well i 'll let you know we lost in the finals of 1966 european cup/now champions league !, 
  take that !, 
  he just wanted roses man . . 
  uhm he quit after the loss in the quali for the euro 2012, 
  he is , do n't know why he put bisevac lol, 
  . . to be the best, 
  you ca n't be implying that someone lied ? 
  no way, 
  what . . 
  ** united ** : van der gouw , martin , irwin , johnsen , stam , van nistelrooy , scholes , fortune , blomqvist , cole , yorke, 
  ** madrid ** : sanchez , pavon , helguera , mcmanaman , amavisca , sanz , hierro , vazquez , zidane , morientes , de la red . 
  goal : morientes ( 40 ) de la red ( 84 ), 
  no one will notice hehehheheheheh, 
  they seem to manage well in ukraine tho, 
  where 's the money lebowski, 
  seriously . . barely remembered him playing at united , had to check wiki, 
  uhm , you are talking about site language , not the language people use to communicate here . 
  you can have swahili as your reddit language , because that 's only on your side , but for communicating you should use english , unless on specific country sub ( where many are still using english ), 
  like le sir, 
  does anyone really care, 
  are you ecuadorian, 
   was available one a free transfer earlier in the season, 
  and now he has a contract . . what 's your point there lol, 
  according to fifa 1.5 mill, 
  why not ? 
  journalists use b&w to this day , what 's wrong with it ? 
  i do n't think reddit are the only ones who hate scientology, 
  or a flop . . anything can happen, 
  i do n't know too much about him , but he seems like a good kid who is hated by the internet just for the sake of it . . 
  oh and jealousy, 
  where did you get that from ? 
  you really do care about him huh ? 
  if you read the comments he did n't stand there the whole time, 
  exactly , haha this thread is a joke . 
  bunch of people got together to hate on fucking justin bieber haha , how sad is that, 
  but everybody hates him duur douchebag, 
  i also didnt do my homework yesterday fuck the system, 
  are you kidding me ? 
  4year old me would love seeing donald getting hit by something while the guy yells blam, 
  jesus newcastle what happened, 
  ah then it must be right !, 
  great manager , shame he could n't manage us longer , also did n't get along with the serbian fa , imo much better option than mihajlovic . 
  hope he does well at valencia !, 
  it 's nuu, 
  might want to block out your name and country and ip ( ? ), 
  holy shit are you saying a little kid deserved to die because she did n't watch at the intersection ? 
   i 'm not trying to be overly harsh, 
  well you fucking are , i do n't think anyone deserves to die for a mistake , i know it happens , but really , a little girl ? 
  haha he found a perfect karma formula, 
  haha thought the 3 digits were the ending of the ip for some reason, 
  holy shit denilson is only 25, 
  pretty sure cazorla was 16mill , while arshavin was # 14.5 mill, 
   i do n't see how the ps3 and 360 are n't `` pick up and play '' . 
  i believe he 's talking about the next gen ones , not ps3 or 360, 
  i sense bitterness in your post, 
  in the stekelenburg thread i saw mark schwarzer going by ms , i spent so long figuring that out, 
  that 's exactly how it works, 
  you ca n't even now , its 17.5 mill in the latest patch, 
  on a side note , on like 5 of my saves , berba was the top scored in the epl in the few first seasons, 
  it 's ok he got to be condescending too, 
  no he did n't , read it again , and this time nicely, 
   the fact that we were kind of fighting this thing called a `` war '' with him, 
  in 1937 you did n't, 
  nice try there , but you might took this too seriously, 
  the one near waco is 2013, 
  are you 15 by any means, 
  everything is forgiven my child, 
  could you give me some reasons ?
