  yes that sounded really close , but the delay between the sound and the impact was there so i do n't know what to think haha, 
  google it , a guy ran to her at the match and stabbed her . . 
  oh no , you are really getting tired of listening to it . . then do n't watch the clips , no one is forcing you . . 
  great performance form landreau, 
  what, 
  where in your link do they say anything about people using mp40 's instead of stens ? 
  wha ... are you 12 ? 
  that 's probably because you ca n't showcase gameplay and mechanics with screenshots . . 
  is that an as val ? 
  and why is it so big ? 
  it definitely looks like that 9a-91, 
   circlejerking is the spirit of / r/cringepics [ 1 ], 
  not at all . . 
  jesus where did you get that from ? 
  what, 
  no , that 's just how you interpreted it, 
  i 'm not him , but no , it 's not worth it imo, 
  but still it 's diablo , and if they add free dlc 's and patches , i could see it pay off, 
  i made this, 
  well a lion is a cat . . 
  i need to get on with the times, 
  here 's the full body shot , it 's clearly in the article you fucking retard, 
   you should really not speak on a situation when you obviously have no idea what 's going on , it actually quite sad . 
  jesus i can imagine you all smug trying to act smart haha, 
  she probably passed out out of shock, 
  wait , you think this is a reddit thing ? 
  it 's used as an insult , like retard for example . . 
   literally every time someone says `` autistic '' on this site , you can make a safe bet that the `` autist '' is not autistic at all, 
  ... what , are you telling me if i call someone an autistic cunt , there 's a possibility that he actually is n't autistic ? 
  yeh , it was some random guy , or an mod for some different sub iirc , like askreddit, 
  iirc they use tons of additional technologies for their engine , that are not in-house , so they need to pay licensing for them , and it 's not profitable for them to develop mod tools and pay for licensing, 
  that 's what i remember anyway , could be wrong, 
  haha well portugal is in europe . . 
  fuck you !, 
  and say `` dated lots of guys '', 
  why does it have to be an image macro ? 
  talk about pandering to a crowd, 
  but it did fall to the communists . . 
  is this some joke, 
  at least you spelt gomez right, 
  well carvajal should play at right back , and forrest at the wing, 
  doubt it , they probably displace after shooting, 
  that is a highly unfortunate angle, 
  i do n't get it why he would n't want extra depth in cb position ? 
  then unsuscribe, 
   did you find and shoot the rancher ? 
  i would be paranoid as fuck , in my mind every one of them could pack a suicide vest, 
   januzaj buff, 
  nice to turn this around to anti-america or something . 
  i 'm not even american , in fact they along with other nato countries bombed us in 1999 , but i can acknowledge the constant fear ( mainly in iraq , in major cities ) of suicide bombers, 
  yeah not like you guys have superiority in every aspect of war, 
  edge, 
  the gurkhas ( nepali : \u0917\u094b\u0930\u094d\u0916\u093e ) ( / \u02c8\u0261\u025crk\u0259 / or / \u02c8\u0261\u028a\u0259rk\u0259 / ) are indigenous people mainly from eastern india , mid-western and eastern nepal, 
  same with chelsea iirc, 
  did n't you spend majority of that cash on other players, 
  yeah clearly your joke was too intelligent for the rest of us, 
  that must be the reason right, 
   the ea effect, 
  hahaha, 
  haha ca n't get offended on / r/soccer , sorry :d, 
  * ziveli *, 
  10 's are usually behind-the-striker midfielder , or an playmaker , or both, 
   i remember hearing fragments of his skull hit the ground, 
  nothing like that in the video, 
  yep , watched lp 's of career mode on consoles , and load times are horrible on consoles , and almost non existent on my pc, 
  ye its the general consensus on ll comments that fsa = terrorist , assad = good guy, 
  not the mention the free reign of racism on that site , almost worse than youtube, 
  yes , had cassano with my serie a team in fifa13 and his vision stats are one of the best in the game, 
  are n't those retired ? 
  wow this exact comment is here every time jb is mentioned, 
  also if it were n't for reddit i 'd never hear anything about him, 
  haha it 's ok it 's just a observation , on every thread about him someone is saying `` i used to defend him but now i see what a douche he is '', 
  it 's just funny, 
  here 's some euro ones, 
  * ** gg ** goal goal = btts ( both teams to score ), 
  * ** gg3 + ** btts with 3 and more goals ( 2-1 , 2-2 etc ), 
  most generic islam hating comment if i ever seen one , topped with the majestic `` religion of peace '' remark, 
  you sound just like every other ignorant cunt on the internet, 
   this paper has no idea who he is scouting for god sake , just plucked a name out of thin air in order to give the picture an article . 
  pathetic really . 
  lol not undercover , he had his uniform on, 
  is joke my friend , you laugh, 
  i am too , and i think that all those people who make puns and joke on those threads are fucking retarded , no matter how `` staggeringly wrong '' you think those assumptions are, 
  and i wo n't, 
  glad we agree we are better than them ( ha ), 
  after ambush ? 
  i very much doubt that was an ambush , more like mass murder and they started running after, 
  dude . . he was not serious, 
  yeh yeh i dont blame you , just noticing, 
  how is he circlejerking ? 
  and great job , since you linked it he got 11 downvotes, 
  this comment was brought to you by mt dew, 
  messi 's kid have more chances to play for argentina national team than some random kid you 've decided to place a bet on, 
  where is he playing now , behind the striker , or striker ? 
  this is getting ridiculous, 
  haha, 
  maybe that 's what somme means , but the battle was named by the river somme in france, 
   in a country that most people had never heard of, 
  i 'd argue about this , especially after recent wars . . 
  is n't it a reference to vietnam war ?
