  who the fuck cares what you ctrl + f 'd seriously, 
  then why are you watching this ? 
  yes because only those 2 are the options, 
  its donnie cunt, 
  but there is a option to turn off the cell phone, 
  can this comment be more stereotypical of reddit, 
  please dont text your friend quotes from house, 
  why does everything have to be a meme, 
  same as you , i think it 's just that we 're bored and reddit got really big amount of content to browse . 
  it 's a revolver in the video , unless i missed something here . 
  bet you feel cool now eh ? 
  wow this is not ask science or anything, 
  yeah i agree on that tho . 
  good day to you sir, 
  what is wrong with you ? 
  what the fuck are you retarded ? 
  why n64 ? 
  ** literallyliterallyliterallyliterallyliterallyliterally **, 
  yes take every popular picture on reddit and slam your shitty text on it you are so original haha . 
  let 's not . 
  they are just cashing in the bandwagon . 
  if it was popular opinion to hate gays and disapprove of gay marriage , they would probably have signs saying `` fuck gay marriage '' . 
  it 's just pr . 
  the `` moral '' part of it is questionable . 
  it is n't moral to everyone is n't it ? 
  same thing with the `` unpopular '' stand ; you seriously think that acknowledging gay marriage is an unpopular stand ? 
  just look at recent posts on reddit , it 's far from unpopular , it is in fact popular opinion and people see it as progressive , and think that this firm is really edgy , progressive and liberal . 
  do n't be naive , corporations are doing everything for a profit . 
  ps i do n't give a fuck i 'm not even from us i dont know why i typed this, 
   just finished building my new gaming pc with my friend , thought i should put it on reddit, 
  why ? 
  are you 12 ? 
  who uses `` fuq '' ? 
  do you go to 9gag ? 
  same thing can be said for any topic, 
  well no one is really making you watch them . 
  there are people that love that just as there are people who love watching french movies from the 40 's . 
  it 's not like that it 's on default subredits ( exepct wtf 's occasional gore ), 
  ** sweden **, 
  the reddit folks didnt beat it to the ground yet . 
  soon hopefully . 
  the current hated title is level : level level, 
   / r/loseit , / r/fitness , / r/paleo and / r/keto, 
  ** seems legit level : gem **, 
  i would like to know too , i checked some other pictures and some looked like something out of fallout games . 
  yes we are aware of this , i 'm sure no one missed this being posted to 15000 subredits, 
  are you serious ? 
  shit people do for karma wow . 
  * `` i 'm just a soul whos intentions are good ... '' *, 
  no one likes you, 
   after the first episode, 
  actually, 
   i went back and checked , it was actually season 4 episode 1 , terrorists were trying to `` corrupt '' the internet . 
  not password it , my mistake !, 
  just do n't go to england , it 's really expensive . 
   it took me studying philosophy at a top american college to become an atheist, 
  literally brave, 
  i really thought that comment i quoted was funny , or you were serious ? 
  no just no, 
  pls derp, 
  is this an actual thing or just some / r/circlejerk leakage ?? 
  it ca n't be ? 
  you do n't happen to be a ron paul loving gay atheist ? 
  retro is in, 
  what the fuck does he have to do with anything, 
  pls, 
  he means for masturbation, 
  oh god how sad, 
  just watched it all , and something that eases me a bit is that description says he was a member of a cartel that was brutal ( la barbie ? 
  not that anyone deserves this but who knows what he and his gang did to others ? 
  although they are retards i think that the saddest thing on reddit are people lying or whoring for karma . 
  that 's what really gets me . 
  ** dm ; hs amirite **, 
  ** it 's a chopper **, 
  axeman pls, 
  can you communicate without using meme lines ? 
  well obviously not as i stated the same dislike, 
  they do n't care so much that they are misusing it, 
  wow this is the 115th time someone replied wow bad ass to that comment . 
  seriously people you act like 10 year olds, 
  it 's not a meme its a reaction gif, 
  why are you trying to be funny ? 
  and he calls me a negative person after his comment haha, 
  can i sell it ? 
  whats the point of the first part `` from millions to zero '' ? 
  i mean it 's obvious there is not gon na be visitors , they just banned them, 
  you mean apart all the unfunny jokes , memes and puns ? 
  why ? 
  why would you force your children to watch something that you liked ? 
  what if they dont like pokemon ? 
  better add that he can barely stand up anymore for some more pitty upvotes, 
  / r/gaming has one 1,500,000 subscribers , and it was on e3 , so i 'm sure there was no need to post it here . 
  yes we do , it 's nothing really secret, 
  no memes in general talk, 
  why do you have to use memes everywhere, 
  fucking people, 
  time to dig some heath ledger pictures to reap karma !, 
  btw he was n't that great in dark knight , deal with it people, 
  wow so you watched the movie ? 
  woah,
