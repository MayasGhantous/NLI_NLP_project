  generic reddit comment # 4, 
  we know, 
  w. . . what, 
  ** young , liberal reddit **,

  what 's up with batman circlejerk on this subreddit ? 
  ever thought of answering any questions ? 
  we got a case of [ generic reddit comment # 4 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/uwgd9/a_friend_just_shared_this_wedding_photo_its/c4z892w ), 
  i like to imagine a whole town just sleeping on the streets for 1 hour, 
  i dont go around doing it . 
  this is just a second one i 've found in such a little time span . 
  key to comedy is moderation , and beating something that - used to - being funny to the ground is not funny ;, 
  the poster is not witty and humorous , he even deleted his comment because he could n't bear the downvotes ( how retarded ), 
  i have heard of memes , being on reddit i have might been over exposed to them and you can really see when it 's time to stop using something . 
  some people unfortunately ca n't . 
  that could indeed be a generic faggot comment # 5, 
  we should make a list of those, 
  but it 's too much hassle, 
  i love writing in paragraphs, 
  people expect this to rhyme, 
  but it actually does n't, 
  dear diary , today op was not a faggot, 
  who the fuck cares about cakeday ? 
  are you fucking kidding me, 
  we need some fucking proof seriously, 
  why, 
  haha funny guy, 
  thanks for letting us know why you upvoted ; such a crucial information, 
  are you fucking kidding me, 
  she told you not to upload the photo , yet you did do it on a site frequented by millions of people . 
  and we are morons, 
  no you 're getting negative `` reviews '' ( read insults ) on this one . 
  and you should . 
  what man , why did you need to use pictures for all those ? 
  i mean 2011 ? 
  how unfunny are you, 
  i love how you got mad at this ahahah, 
  he means ram memory not graphic memory ( gddr ) that is used for lod/resolutions, 
  yeah you should totally feel like a dick for having a normal evening, 
  should 've knitted her a mario/pokemon sweater and bought skyrim amirite, 
  ah yes , my bad, 
  fuck your building, 
  so you just said the same thing as him ? 
  just because you do n't know does n't mean that we all do n't, 
  it is estimated that more than one million people are living with hiv in the usa , what makes you any different than them ? 
  yeah sure . 
  do n't get me wrong it 's a horrible thing i just thought i would ask . 
  dont you bring your own opinion here motherfucker, 
  what about subotic ? 
  i 'm pretty sure bvb is fairly popular as it is , regardless this video :d, 
  how is just saying nope chuck testa funnier than anything ? 
  but you ca n't so yeah , fuck you, 
  it 's all for karma , man . 
  alderwield, 
  yes , forgot reus and shaqiri , got them in like 80 % of my teams . 
  do you have a life outside reddit ? 
  just skimmed trough your history and wow you post alot . 
  a genuine karma whore, 
  what 's wrong with ea logo ? 
  but you all play fifa ( majority ) whats the deal with hating the company you use the products of . . 
  i just hate the cheating ai ( they instantly become world class in last 10mins of the game ), 
   ** one word **, 
  this, 
  englan pls, 
  your bench is better, 
  newcastle 2nd season , 5th place, 
  tiote was worth 8mill i think ? 
  but i got an offer for 14mill from real m. so i took it . 
  ba came to me with a transfer request so i sold him to everton for 10mill . 
  sold cabaye for 39mill ( !, 
  ) , would have not sold him if man u didnt offer that much . 
  he 's small but fast , not a good player for epl , but kinda fits the newcastle singings . 
  yeah , he 's kinda opposite of cisse and welbeck , 2 strong and tall strikers so i sometimes play him as a cam or cf behind st. 
  i found myself not buying anyone 3 seasons with united , they have great players , alttho i added powell and kagawa before starting so i had a really great team , used pogba alot , and really had fun with that squad, 
  yes free transfer . 
  ever heard of wages ? 
  that has nothing to do with the transfer price . 
  but technically it 's a free transfer tho :d wage does n't matter in that sense, 
  no it 's winter there in june , dont you know ukraine and poland are like australia with reversed seasons ? 
  so you like attention too huh ? 
  haha , it was a joke tho . 
  we all love each other here, 
  just like every other arabian uprising this and past year ? 
  ** shut up meg haha amirite guys **, 
  my solution is to unsubscribe to / r/adviceanimals and / r/funny, 
  so i just stopped raging at something i did n't see . 
  when will you stop and realize you are not funny ? 
  why did you have to do that ? 
  good you would like the romanian or latvian prisons then, 
  yeah i always did that, 
  i fucking hate all of you . 
  yeah and italy wore blue because of the ruling house , savoia had a blue flag/coat of arms whatever, 
  it 's almost as they are actors who do other roles !, 
  and rich, 
   you do n't really get that with too many other teams . 
  yes you do, 
  shutup meg amirite guys hahah im so funny and original amirite, 
  glad we 're smarter than them,
