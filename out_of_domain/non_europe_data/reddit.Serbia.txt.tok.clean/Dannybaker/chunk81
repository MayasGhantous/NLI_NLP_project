  i 'm afraid he wo n't ever be the same after the injury which ruled him out of the wc, 
   i support free speech, 
  there is no free speech here , it 's a privately owned site , with its own rules, 
  there is no democracy , free speech , or elections here . . 
  when will you figure that out ? 
  haha, 
  do n't worry it was not a sub dedicated to hating you, 
  great job giving money to people you hate morons, 
  yes i 'm sure someone spent money on butthurt idiots lol, 
  this all just reads like a angsty teen rebelling against his mom story, 
  but what about / r/srs, 
  i 'd put voat.co on redditeurs guerilla side , they 're waging a proxy war against reddit, 
  this is cold war 2, 
  switzerland but yeah, 
  given that he 's from sui that 's highly unlikely ;d ;d, 
  it 's for ethics in journalism , censorship etc. . gamergate basically, 
   that was really my intention all along when posting this . 
  to give money to reddit ? 
  nice job then moron, 
  no one gilded you anyway , so you sure showed those * ~ ~ sjw ~ ~ * * jews, 
  chelsea and city have a relatively small squad too, 
  but what about srs, 
  banned sorry, 
  at this point it 's random people prefacing their comments with, 
   `` i did n't like fph , * but . . * '', 
  and then proceed to call her chairman pao and that they 're just advocating free speech and they 're off to voat . 
  it 's like they 're all using the same template comment, 
  hm , did you see / r/all last night ? 
  it was full of `` fuck this cunt '' with pictures of pao , and they all had obvious throwaway account like `` bigpeopledisdain '' etc, 
  total war , creative assembly, 
  it 's hala madrid , and do americans actually say shite ? 
  all the issues you have are fixable with mods , and beth games are really really benefiting from them so if you can by any chance get it on pc you will have a totally different experience, 
  [ shits just in ], 
  huh and he got banned as well, 
  did n't he leave a `` suicide note '' and retire from reddit a while ago ? 
  anyway with his drive for transparency , i can imagine he could n't stay quiet for long, 
  `` yeah fuck reddit lets go to voat !, 
  i mean not now because i 'm on the phone '', 
  lol what, 
  that 's not how history works, 
  if i was new to the sport , reading this i would 've thought nl won the world cup last year lol, 
    cat piss is quite hard to get and hard to maintain, 
   things change, 
  nothing has changed since last time this was posted lol, 
  typical reddit, 
  time to go to voat i think, 
  how are we here if it 's dead, 
  probably because typing does n't require use of mouth, 
  thanks, 
  tl ; dr you 're just jealous ive got more than you, 
  hey we are red and white too, 
  well i was talking about the nt but i get your point haha, 
  no need to be sorry m8, 
  mitrovic just does n't suit our play style , which is a shame, 
  i wonder why djordjevic from lazio is not in the nt, 
  you know nothing , donnie, 
  i laughed so hard at how the guy just lost it , he did n't even get insulted, 
  help i ca n't say racist stuff without being ridiculed, 
  ** i am being oppressed **, 
  ** ^ oppressed !, 
  i also created multiple accounts which got me shadowbanned so admins are in it too for sure, 
  i thought that 's sjw, 
  talk more , i 'm really interested, 
  but how will people know about their struggle against oppression then ? 
  he 's only 18 and i doubt he 'll even go on loan , probably play under 21 for a few years then go to lower league on loan, 
  you have butland m8, 
  tbh lallana plays up front at liverpool too, 
  i 'll try jessica for my male play trough, 
  look at me . 
  i 'm the mod now, 
   raider scum, 
  you might have been tricksted, 
  rused once again, 
  can you please post some more screencaps , i 'm basically in begging more right now , as i ca n't access any video sites ? 
  so voiced protagonist = not rpg now ? 
  is this satire, 
  wow this is wrong on so many levels i do n't know where to start, 
  first , people do n't have a clearly defined line like in fifa , where they start declining immediately after crossing it . 
  it varies greatly from player to player , have you heard of di natale , luca toni , klose ? 
  forlan ? 
  one guy here is comparing him to hitler ffs, 
  you edited the ( on average ) part haha, 
  your whole post just sounds you went on a google spree typing `` striker peak age '' and posted blog posts you found, 
  you even have a guy from washington post agreeing with you ffs lol, 
  is there actually a spanish `` navy seal '' copypasta , or this is some google translate fu ? 
  either way spanish copypastas are hilarious, 
  how 's will hughes doing for you ? 
  him , hendrick and mason bennett were supposed to be good players a few years ago , but never heard of them since then, 
  no it 's not, 
  chelsea does n't have london in its name , united does, 
  lascelles went to newcastle right ? 
  why is there no \u00df in wasser , if \u00df = ss ? 
  it 's adidas gradient ^ tm m8, 
   i do n't think there was a *** carbine *** version of the *** kar *** 98k ,, 
  well cf is behind the striker , like ss in pes ( second striker ), 
  i do n't see the confusion , it 's a legitimate position , of course you would n't call someone who plays in 2 striker formation cf , but they need to make a distinction in games, 
  the facts ? 
  lol he was always like this , not like we are basing it on this particular case, 
  there was a thread a while ago about where the u20 players who won the tournaments are now . 
  surprisingly not a lot of them made it to top level,
