  well it 's dice afterall, 
  there is already 5 explanations wow , also troicki is 34th, 
  edit : this is the best explanation tho . 
  what exactly do you need chief ? 
  but he also threatened to kill cops . . 
  haha no , it means he 's not in first 10 or 15 i think , there 's a certain limit in rank they show on the scoreboard, 
  haha, 
  look at his motherfucking balls, 
  i 'm not really sure that 's true , i never had rooney go to chelsea , actually none of those transfer you listed happened to me . 
  you should have just posted your gf pictures to / r/pics, 
  no need to pretend you care other peoples so 's, 
  shut the, 
  fuck up, 
  no hate towards the people , but the silly act that does n't do shit, 
  if every person who worked at walmart would do an ama . . 
  stop, 
  holy shit this is fucking sad , what is wrong with you people ? 
  this is like , really low, 
  this is just sad, 
  how did you manage to fuck up the punch line quote, 
  word, 
  i wish atheism had it too, 
  that would make him extremely stupid, 
  it 's okay , he had good intentions , i do n't really downvote anyone except morons which he ( i hope so ) is n't . 
  and the cl kit, 
  it 's just the same color, 
  3 months and 12 days im impressed, 
  edited, 
  is there a subreddit for kits ? 
  i love kits, 
  no fuck you, 
  lyon and marseille always get some special kits , as if adidas is giving them extra treatment , and i think i 've read that somewhere . 
  couple of years ago , serbia had a great team too, 
  vidic , subotic , kolarov , krasic , ivanovic , tosic , jovanovic , stankovic , kuzmanovic etc but did poorly . 
  some teams just ca n't do shit together even if they are good individually, 
  it was on the fucking frontpage, 
  ** it was on the frontpage two fucking days ago **, 
  ** seriously **, 
  it 's okay it only got like 46 points now . 
  faith in humanity level gem : restored, 
  loads of money, 
  how exactly did you make tons of money on that ? 
  is it a nicely paid job or ? 
  sorry not from us so ca n't tell, 
  yeah , nothing is black and white like that . 
  they fight for freedom there , but freedom so they can rule the country with their backwards laws . 
  i doubt there is need to xpost , i 'm pretty sure everyone is subscribed to til , and it was on front page, 
  why is in this case wikipedia being questioned as a valid source ? 
  there 's tons of til 's linking wiki and none have this omg its wikipedia, 
  but the op is a faggot originated from / b / . 
  i 'm pretty sure they fucking hate it now and it 's up to you and your kind on reddit to run it to the ground . 
  because he likes humor for 4year olds, 
  well it 's the default subredit but hey , i 'm not complaining , i never had this much downvotes , it 's like i fucking killed someone !, 
   oad means overaly attached girlfriend . 
  how, 
  are you kidding me ? 
  you did n't know lions are big ? 
  how old are you ? 
  i am just going to tell you to stop trying . 
  every subreddit has it circlejerks and you ca n't really expect to change their minds even if you have good points . 
  just leave it alone it 's not worth it . 
  well is it britany or france ? 
  i know . . 
  probly, 
  why would psg need ibra ? 
  with lavezzi menez and gameiro surely they dont need another one ? 
  and do n't call me shirley, 
  hated the striped one , it was just a template design ( ugly one too ) . 
  loved the black one , so sleek and elegant, 
  never thought of searching for our subreddit , oh god, 
  btw great idea, 
  and get sold faster !, 
  you mean ** cock **, 
  third ? 
  does n't look like this year 's nike template, 
  why did i get downvoted again ? 
  it 's not like he 's moving from japan , he was in dortmund after all . 
  a man in white van had a similar idea few years back, 
  why are they even bothering playing football ? 
  oh cmon , how couldnt you remember this ? 
  yeah found the [ thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/snrkg/went_hiking_with_my_girlfriend_in_honor_of_earth/ ) but could n't tineye it too, 
  * i know *, 
  oh fuck you, 
  i know now is what i meant to say . 
  i guess i 'm not that smart anyway, 
  i like to believe that that 's really your father, 
  and then you retreat and retreat to berlin to possibly die by russians, 
  what the fuck, 
  joke would been classier if you left the thanks reddit part imo, 
  it 's not about grammar man , i just do n't understand a single thing in that previous post . 
  you gaylord , i was about to wank, 
  why are you not using a logo pack ? 
  but it is known , it 's not really an unknown event, 
  but also she could n't hurt you iirc . 
  once you got that figured it 's really not scary . 
  it 's just a scripted animation, 
  yes, 
   wikipedia article quote, 
  your name is / r/footballmanagergames ? 
  if you give us back savic , it would work out for both of us,
