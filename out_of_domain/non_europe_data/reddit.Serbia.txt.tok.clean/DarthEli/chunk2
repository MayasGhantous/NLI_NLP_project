  that cat turns like a tiger . 
  i was thinking more like this https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/tiger_i, 
  it 's on [ youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9lehozzbuk ) . 
  happy to help . 
  what are you saying ? 
  7.7 is still max for me . 
  edit : never mind , read the relevant thread,

  how do i penetrate an is3 frontaly with a tiger 2 ( h ) ? 
  honestly , i 'm surprised at the amount of people that are indifferent or even opposed to the concept of live action star wars tv . 
  i think it would be a lot better than the animated shows we have now since it would allow for more mature , complex storytelling . 
  these cartoons are ok , but they are still primarily made for younglings . 
  i guess you did n't have wookiees in mind when you designed her . 
  while i have some minor criticisms , i enjoyed most of the arcs/episodes you mentioned , especially the ashoka framed arc . 
  i liked how they showed some of the coruscant underworld , it scratched that itch that the now canceled star wars 1313 was supposed to . 
  however , these episodes are definitely not in the majority . 
  for every mature , complex episode or arc , there is at least one that is formulaic and kid oriented . 
  rebels tips the scales in favor of kid stuff even more . 
  i still watch and enjoy these shows , buy i just feel that other mediums , such as live action tv , are better suited for intricate and nuanced storytelling that i feel star wars is best served with . 
  i 'm new . 
  if this is n't a dogfight , could you please clarify what is ? 
  obvious edit :, 
   from my point of view the ~ ~ jedi ~ ~ jews are evil . 
  it 's `` krofna '' in serbian , it should be the same in croatian . 
  agreed . 
  sadly , being realistic and sensible does not win you elections in serbia . 
  that 's just spot on . 
  did isis hire american censors ? 
  right , that makes sense . 
  thanks . 
  edgy . 
  could you please post the name of the app ? 
  would like to try it . 
  thanks a bunch , man . 
  upvote text on your comment : `` exactly how many of you are there ? '', 
  priceless . 
  big fan of the hitman as well , and seeing how blood money videos were brilliant , i would be very interested in seeing jon play the rest of the more `` classic '' games in the series . 
  some would say that he 's the reverse . 
  [ jest gone amiss ] [ inquisition called ], 
  please . 
  do n't bother . 
  just zap them with force lightning , trust me , it 's much more effective . 
  war thunder . 
  it 's free , well optimized and very pretty . 
  do n't mind me , just making myself eligible . 
  what an asshole . 
  well , here goes nothing ... 
  and i thought i was safe from/b / on reddit ... 
  he 's p for pretentious . 
  i just wanted to ask , what does `` book ! '', 
  mean ? 
  why the exclamation mark ? 
  thanks !, 
  very informative post . 
  as a serbian , i 'd prefer you never happened . 
  [ here . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/aqxceqf.gif ) use this one next time . 
  nah , but i think i 've seen first either on / r/upvotegifs or / r/highqualitygifs, 
  a big thank you to amd for doing this ama and of course for doing this giveaway !, 
  i do n't know much about gpus , so i wo n't be asking you any questions ; i just hope i 'll be one of the lucky 14 . 
  good luck to everyone who commented !, 
  wow , he walked straight into that one . 
  what is your hardware and how well does this run on it ( fps ) ? 
  nice tune . 
  and not a single person will answer for this war crime . 
  justice . 
  also , those of us who are n't american . 
  yeah , but the parties in 90s yugoslavia were a bit different ... 
  yeah , do they at least do anal ? 
  if only he had listened to his generals ... 
  knights of the old republic is on ios/android and it is just as enjoyable and inexpensive as before . 
  i hope that the same will be true for rome and that it will eventually come out for android as well . 
  well , they could 've fooled me , it looked like a full game [ here ] ( https://www.feralinteractive.com/en/games/rome-ios/ ), 
  [ youtube link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bszyfo0vhxw ), 
  like turbo `` lasers '' from star wars . 
  star trek the next generation , klasika . 
  / r/therewasanattempt, 
  they are not minors , they are pixels . 
  huh , i am surprised that serbia is considered friendly . 
  i thought we would get lumped together with russia . 
  it sounds similar to o brien . 
  it 's a pun . 
  yeah , they also have a bounty hunter in game called `` djenge frett '' . 
  they are maybe too on the nose with their references . 
  totally agree . 
  as an newbie leopard driver , sim is the only game mode i can do well in . 
  talismans drop much more often on low tier vehicles , unfortunately . 
  lucky you !, 
  besides the two from my flair , i also got one for the t-28 . 
  it turns out i 'm just unlucky . 
  but the turret traverse makes me cry . 
  it 's treason , then . 
  evil jon has been gone for way too long , we need her back . 
  #blessed is the mind too small for doubt, 
  well , that sucks . 
  thank you for your answer . 
  good idea with the bluetooth keyboard , it did n't occur to me at all . 
  this is just infuriating .
