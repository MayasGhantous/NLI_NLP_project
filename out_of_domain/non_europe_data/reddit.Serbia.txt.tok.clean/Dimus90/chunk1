do n't be mad germans , but i want to come too . 
  yes , but how many of the have a degree in electrical engineering ( renewable energy ) ? 
  dictatorship , only intelligent people to come to power . 
  i would like that you need to pass the exams in order to vote in elections , like you need to pass exam for a driver licence , same with religion . 
  true , but i still do n't like that everybody has a right to vote . 
  i agree . 
  in serbia as soon as you graduate you move out of serbia , because you need to be in a political party in order to get a job . 
  i want to go to germany , but companies are asking that i know german language level b2 . 
  i 'm starting next year to learn german . 
  watch documentary `` weight of the chains '' , tito wanted albania to join yugoslavia so that 's why he was letting albanians in kosovo , they had everything there on their language . 
  like any muslim they started breeding in large numbers and tito died so his wish to join albania to yugoslavia died and then shit hit the fan . 
  thank you . 
  thank you for the links , do n't worry about it i 'm not offended . 
  i know about cs i 'm showing foreigners around belgrade ( i 'm from serbia , belgrade ) and i posted there already . 
  i just wanted to have all the info before coming since it 's my first time in sweden . 
  thank you . 
  anything that you think it might be relevant , i just do n't like night life or alcohol . 
  thank you . 
  same in serbia , it 's annoying . 
  thank you . 
  thank you . 
  what video ? 
  hvala . 
  similar in serbia , we usually wait for our parents to die and then we inherit the apartment or house . 
  what ? 
  serbia should be red too . 
  they will be on their way north , they will not stay here . 
  we had some group on cs that wanted to help these people that were sleeping in the park and their organisation name was `` openborderserbia '' . 
  i do n't care if they fuck , just do n't breed . 
  it should be raised at 21 . 
  better come to serbia , there is more to see and do . 
  we have a candy that 's called `` negro '' . 
  that 's because you only need to show western passport and girls and women will flock to you . 
  unfortunately, 
  in serbia it 's western men that come for a short term `` relationships '' , just show your passport and you can chose . 
  yea , but unfortunately we do n't have western women coming for those short term `` relationships '' . 
  are we really that noticeable in austria ? 
  those people are the ones who come to serbia for a `` vacation '' and we do n't love them either . 
  they work for western companies making them profit , pay taxes at western countries and build houses here in serbia while telling us how bad it is in the western world . 
  before serbia was put on schengen list and we need it visa to go anywhere in europe all of them would tell us to come over there are jobs , money , everything you ever wanted . 
  as soon s serbia did n't need visa anymore all of those same people started telling us that we should n't come , how everything is bad , we wo n't like it there etc. 
  i think you got uneducated people from balkans , because all of those who spoke english and had some skills or degree went to english speaking countries , you got the rest . 
  i want an option to explain why i chose that answer . 
  we go to other places . 
  i 'm sorry guys , but you received uneducated ones who do n't speak any other language . 
  those who spoke english or were educated went to english speaking countries , nobody here speaks german , let alone any other european language . 
  we also hate those gastarbajtere . 
  da li si bio tamo da ih vidi\u0161 ? 
  they speak serbian , but they are gypsies . 
  english speaking countries got the good ones , europe got the rest , sorry . 
  there should be more requirement to be able to vote , for example :, 
  minimum age : 21 , military service , 1 year of volunteering somewhere ( red cross , etc. ), 
  and then voting should be mandatory for those who qualify . 
  stari grad . 
  i too would like a tall girlfriend . 
  hvala . 
  armed society is a polite society . 
  ( levoruk sam ), 
  triple 9 , the escort , cirkeln , he never died , kill command , john wick , alien nation , dirty grandpa , i am wrath , pandemic , risen ...

  translation :, 
  in the center of subotica , close to the hotel patria , late last week , three migrants physically attacked two 16-year-old boy s.s. and d.s. 
  who were trying to help them find shelter . 
  according to the girls , the same age of one of the boys , who on that day was with him in the company of a group of high school students is around 21:00 h stayed in the park ferenc rajhla when they were approached by three migrant . 
  constantly we gather in the park behind the jadrana . 
  we were not alone , there were a lot of young people , when we arrived three migrant asked us where they could spend the night - said for our site girl m.p. 
  ( 17 ) - two brothers from our company have tried to explain to them , but they did not understand , they went with them to the hotel patria . 
  the girl with the rest of the company remained at the jadrana , and after a few moments , one of the brothers s.s. came slit and bloody head . 
  all distraught he told us that he bent down to tie the laces , and it 's one of the migrants took a scalpel and cut a part of the head and ears . 
  then they ran away . 
  his brother went to fetch water , we tried to stop the bleeding and we called an ambulance - recounts further incident girl - emergency immediately took the injured brother , while another gave a statement to a police officer , who arrived when the ambulance did . 
  he was terrified and in shock and injured brother was immediately taken to the hospital . 
  because of this event , a group of young people no longer meets the culture place at the jadrana , but by the green fountains . 
  the children claim that they no longer feel safe in their city . 
  i think we 've seen yesterday walking around the city center , which means that nobody did nothing . 
  the brothers have recovered , but they do not want to speak publicly because they are afraid , and we are in fear . 
  children in this city are no longer safe , and nobody reacts - adds visibly shaken girl . 
  in subotica pd they have confirmed that the incident in which three migrant assaulted two minors , one of whom is injured has happened . 
  the police immediately went to the scene and informed about all the competent basic public prosecutor . 
  the faces have not yet been identified and taken all the measures and intensive work to shed light on this case - say in pd subotica . 
  an ambulance brought the injured man in the general hospital , where he was admitted to the violation of the right side of the neck and ears , and a minor violation of the knee . 
  head injuries are caused by a sharp instrument , and knee during the crash . 
  after the injury repaired boy was released home and was told to report for a check upl of the ent department , but also a psychiatrist after he suffered an attack - say in the hospital . 
  hvala na odgovoru .
