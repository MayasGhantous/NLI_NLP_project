not seizures . 
  kickass.to was never seized , but the admins do often change domains after all , just to stay safe . 
  jesus christ , it 's not fake ... it 's an old domain , which will redirect you to kat.cr , the current domain . 
  you need to disable an addon you have . 
  it 's called magic player . 
  it really does n't look completely legit , it 's much different than kat . 
  it 's a pretty late response but , ... 
  i do n't know , lol . 
  i have n't come across an explanation for this yet . 
  this is terrifying . 
  why do n't you write that in the cyrillic script ? 
  besides the script change , i 've edited alucardsensei 's translation a little bit . 
  not because it is incorrect , it 's simply how i would write it . 
  though , they 're still very similar . 
  when it comes to the surnames that are derived from first names , they are derived from a variant of their possessive adjectives . 
  it 's very complicated for me to explain to you , because the serbian grammar is much more complicated than the english and pretty much every other one . 
  so , in english , you 've got one variant of every adjective there is . 
  in serbian , there are six . 
  the variant of possessive adjectives used to derive surnames is the one you use when talking about a singular noun of the masculine genus . 
  such a noun would be `` dog '' . 
  so , `` milo\u0161 's dog '' would be `` milo\u0161ev pas '' . 
  to get a surname , you just need to add `` i\u0107 '' to the adjective . 
  and there you have it . 
  but , stefan is a different story because the possessive adjective of the same variant is n't `` stefanev '' , but `` stefanov '' . 
  thus , you get `` stefanovi\u0107 '' and not `` stefanevi\u0107 '' . 
  now , why is it `` zori\u0107 '' and not `` zorovi\u0107 '' or `` zorevi\u0107 '' ? 
  well , because , nouns of the female genus have a different variant of those six variants of possessive adjectives of the masculine genus . 
  this also includes nouns of the masculine genus that end with the letter a. 
  the possessive adjective used to derive a surname is `` zorin '' . 
  remember , not `` zorain '' , but `` zorin '' . 
  the last vowel is always assimilated . 
  then , to create a surname , you need to remove the `` in '' at the end and add `` i\u0107 '' . 
  so , that 's how you get `` zori\u0107 '' . 
  if you really want to learn this , you need to start studying it . 
  as you can conclude from my comment , serbian language is very tough to learn if you are a foreigner , because it 's a lot more complicated and rich than pretty much any other . 
  i hope i 've helped !, 
  edit : check out / u/metalo-strugar / 's comment below for some more info !, 
  right , i forgot to mention that . 
  just like you said , it comes naturally . 
  although , anyone can see that it depends on what the last letter of the name is . 
   asshair, 
  indeed , yes . 
  i should 've mentioned that in my first post , but i forgot , as i said . 
  anyways , now you 've got a full explanation , / u/asshair / . 
  in my opinion , europe 1200 is the best overall because it has the most to do . 
  what i do n't like in europe 1200 is that the world map looks a little poorly done and that there could be more factions . 
  medieval conquests/1257ad on the other hand are beautiful when it comes to graphics and the map stretches all the way to jerusalem , but there simply is n't enough stuff to do . 
  there are more factions , but those factions have much less fiefs than in europe 1200 . 
  as i said , i 'd go with europe 1200 . 
  let 's hope that when bannerlord comes out , someone will make a good combination of these mods . 
  well , it 's just a bit boring to me . 
  i feel like the diversity of quests and missions is greater in europe 1200 . 
  it 's like this all over eastern europe , just watch a few videos online . 
  there 's a really big hooligan problem in many eastern european countries .

  dobro je prosirivati znanje , pa evo izvoli iz [ ovog istrazivanja ] ( http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0105090 ) :, 
   to assess potential admixture between western balkan and middle eastern populations during the ottoman rule ( 15 -- 19cc ad ) we first analyzed the number of ibd segments shared per one pair for western balkan and middle eastern populations ... for longer ibd segments only kosovars have higher ibd relatedness with palestinians ( p = 0.0056 for 4 -- 5 cm ibd segments ) and ** only bosniacs have higher ibd sharing with turks ** ( p = 0.0097 for 5 -- 6 cm ibd segments ) ... 
   ** taken together , analysis of ibd segments reveals similar patterns of ibd sharing for muslim and non-muslim western balkan populations with populations of middle east , providing thereby little support to a gene flow scenario during the conversion to islam ( 15 -- 19 cc ad ) in the balkans .

  not true for serbia . 
  average low in january in belgrade is -1.1 degrees . 
  why does the entirety of reddit hold the view that nationalism is some sort of bogeyman ? 
  why would nationalism be a dangerous idea ? 
  do you even know what nationalism is ? 
  do you realise that greece , for example , along with basically all other balkan countries , would n't exist if it was n't for nationalism ? 
  i 've seen [ this comic ] ( http://www.smbc-comics.com/comics/1476886340-20161019.png ) that tries , and fails , to show the difference between patriotism and nationalism . 
  to me , it seems that reddit agrees with that comic on what nationalism is . 
  to give you a better idea , [ here 's an illustration that i made ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4dqhdke.png ) which depicts the [ balkan wars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balkan_wars ) , more specifically the first balkan war which saw the balkan league at war against the ottoman empire . 
  now , at that point , those four nations were already independent , but there were still lands populated by their peoples which they sought to liberate . 
  what the first comic depicts as `` nationalism '' is some sort of chauvinist expansionism . 
   you say that like it 's a bad thing . 
  of course it 's a bad thing . 
  but i guess that ukraine or the baltic states being under the ussr is waaay worse , right ? 
   in reality , there is n't a difference between nationalism and patriotism . 
  wrong . 
   oh , and if you think there can be no self-determination without rabid nationalism , let me introduce you to a little place called rojava . 
  or chiapas . 
  autonomy does n't always work and there are serious advantages to being a sovereign state over being just an autonomous region . 
  and not all nationalism is `` rabid '' . 
   nationalism is n't just incredibly dangerous ( see : literally every european war of the last 150 years ), 
  literally not . 
  wwi started because of austria-hungary 's imperialism , not nationalism . 
  as for wwii , of course hitler was a nationalist , but that 's like saying that stalin was a `` socialist '' . 
  a bit of an understatement . 
   if you feel a need to attach your identity to some arbitrary and constructed idea of nationhood , then your identity probably needs some reconsidering . 
  `` arbitrary '' . 
  haha . 
  so a large group of people that was forged through thousands of years , and which is determined by common ethnicity , language , religion and traditions is arbitrary ? 
   like , the whole idea of `` rightful [ x ] land '' seems like the kind of thing we should 've thrown out during the enlightenment along with the divine right of kings . 
  does n't seem like that to me . 
   to quote robert anton wilson :, 
  `` every national border in europe mars the place where two gangs of bandits got too exhausted to kill each other anymore and signed a treaty . 
  patriotism is the delusion that one of these gangs of bandits is better than all the others . '', 
  that 's a pretty shitty quote you 've got there . 
  that `` intellectual '' , just like any other every day liberal , also mistakes patriotism for chauvinism . 
  patriotism is literally just an attachment to your homeland . 
  not to mention that he tries draw a connection between gang rivalries and the distinct peoples of europe . 
  do n't know about you pal , but i 've really got to say that i find it hard not to associate with the belief which kept my nation alive for well over a thousand years , and which is the main reason why my nation is alive today .
