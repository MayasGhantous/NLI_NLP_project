  someone does n't agree with me ? 
  must be an evil russian hacker , i need to quickly virtue signal how angry i am despite being dense as a fucking brick and probably underaged . 
  no but i 'm a serb , which means they probably hate me even more than they do russians . 
  ipsos : do 12h izlaznost 20,3 %, 
  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 
  wtf i love mali alek now, 
  ankete . 
  / r/theredpill, 
  sauce pls, 
  edit : https://izbori.live/, 
  lol what, 
  jeremic ? 
  literally the worst , i agree . 
  i hope one day we make all white people get the fuck out of our country . 
  i just want to say that as a long-time trump supporter i absolutely love visiting / r/tinytrumps when i 'm having my morning coffee , and i hope you guys keep making more quality content . 
  memes aside that is an absolutely stunning painting . 
   a radical right wing party, 
  i 'm going to go ahead and guess you 've never lived in a country with an actual radical right wing party government . 
   us republicans are a radical right wing party . 
  no they 're not , you 're fucking embarrassing yourself . 
  see : ww1, 
  why would n't it be ? 
  because teenaged redditors have a hard time grasping that not everyone in their country is a fedora tipping / r/atheism subscriber going through his atheist phase . 
  oh my fucking god this is fantastic . 
  from what i 've heard , the creator got annoyed because people kept pestering him to update it and removed it from the workshop . 
  should be reuploaded when it gets updated for 1.20, 
  you 're a big france !, 
  rep. advisor and ally austria , hungary and most importantly the mamluka . 
  declare a war while the otto army is in asia and let them and mamluks whale on each other while you siege down the balkans . 
  playing byzantium will always be a restart-fest depending on whether the turk feels like beating you up early . 
  that said , i tried this start three times in the last two days and it worked every time . 
  beautiful india , but what the heck is wrong with your font ? 
  all this talk about 0/0/0 , a smart ruler would make this decision . 
  watched in hd and it looks like the fps is dancing around 10-15 . 
  not a fan . 
  who 's downvoting this man for telling the truth ? 
  or are you telling me people play aphrodite because they like her eyes ? 
  from what i can see you conquered good chunks of hre and scandinavia , the weird thing would be if they * did n't * enter a coalition against you . 
  b e l g r a d e, 
   serbia was not the main focus of this patch but together with the addition of the province of belgrade we have added a decision for the serbian state to make belgrade their capital if they are able to retake it from the hungarians . 
  hang on . 
   serbia was not the main focus of this patch, 
  let 's take another look . 
   * this patch *, 
  serbia patch 1.22 confirmed ? 
  1355 best year of my life , remove byzantine filth , c\u0336o\u0336n\u0336s\u0336t\u0336a\u0336n\u0336t\u0336i\u0336n\u0336o\u0336p\u0336l\u0336e\u0336 carigrad belongs to the serbs !, 
  balkans and anatolia are insanely fun to play in , probably my favourite region . 
  once you remove the turk , you have so many different ways to expand that no two games are ever the same , i hope they do end up releasing a patch focused on it . 
  americans on reddit are the only people i 've ever met that defend companies and corporations without being paid to do so . 
  it 's fascinating . 
  byzantium is not even close to being one of the hardest starts , it 's almost a meme how easy it is to do it at this point . 
  pretty meaningless considering 90 % of the ironman posts i see on here do `` mysterious crash/weird crashxdddd '' in the comments along with a hefty number of backup saves . 
  are you having a stroke ? 
  my favourite part of / r/smite is when the staff drops by to insult their players . 
  real nice example you 're setting there , buddy . 
  careful not to go the way of dm , they 'll only tolerate so much . 
  small compared to what ? 
  europe is slightly larger than the u.s. 
  europe is slightly larger than the u.s. , i still do n't understand what you mean . 
  is n't it mandatory lecture in all of europe , if not worldwide ? 
  it 's a true masterpiece . 
  i 'd also like to add that over half of those that post those kinds of posts are closet wehraboos . 
  glad i 'm not the only one who finds `` r8 reich xddd '' shit clogging up the front page annoying . 
   i 'll be targeting `` make america great again '' ball cap wearers . 
  i 'm a pretty good shot too . 
  thank you for giving me a chance to [ make my first report to the fbi ] ( http://i.imgur.com/np1gewy.png ) . 
  holy shit the arrogance . 
  maybe do n't visit this specific subreddit then ? 
  reddit is a website largely populated by fedora tipping , muslim loving , american teenagers who know literally nothing about the world outside of their own country . 
  i would n't bother if i were you , they probably unironically hold up #refugeeswelcome signa . 
   the car should n't have been there in the first place . 
  the people should n't be on a highway . 
  if i was driving that vehicle i 'd sure as hell be panicked when a mob of mentally ill communists start slamming on my windows . 
  he did the best possible thing he could have done , and i respect him for it . 
  i 'm insane because i do n't want to get my vehicle smashed , get dragged outside and beaten/stabbed by violent communists ? 
  what the hell is wrong with you ? 
  so brave . 
  is that really considered a major dlc ? 
  l a z a r u s, 
  serbia next patch confirmed ? 
   might be a good thing considering the future ... 
  what ? 
  [ 0:49 your stability has dropped !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/qdubmenlsxc?t=49 ), 
   the u.s. is less religious overall, 
  the number of atheists worldwide is dropping rapidly . 
  i 'm not saying you 're wrong , but do you have any stats on this ? 
  source ? 
  i 'm not sure what triggered you so hard , but i 've seen [ this ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/07/why-people-with-no-religion-are-projected-to-decline-as-a-share-of-the-worlds-population/ ) article in more than a few news websites i follow and was basing my opinion on those . 
  i used to be an atheist myself while i was a teenager , but like many of my peers i stopped larping as one when i grew up . 
  i hope the same happens to you . 
  slovenia is in central europe , not east , and has probably benefited the most during the golden years of yugoslavia , and has only continued to improve since its break up . 
  mate , he 's from slovenia , not slovakia . 
  come home mountain serb . 
  holy shit , i thought people like you were just a meme but here i am being proven wrong . 
  ** burn it all down !, 
  8 years . 
  give this hardworking centipede a coat !, 
  was n't halo originally developed as a pc specific game ? 
   on july 21 , 1999 , during the macworld conference & expo , steve jobs announced that halo would be released for classic mac os and windows simultaneousl,
