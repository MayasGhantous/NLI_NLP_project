  already participated in the paradigm random tournament and got to the finals . 
  looking for people to queue up with in ranked and fight my way to plat/diamond . 
  add me if you 're interested, 
  installed it a couple of months ago when a friend made me do it , and it worked for a day before deleting itself overnight for some reason . 
  the next day , i 've been getting this lovely message when i try to reinstall it :, 
  i assumed it was an error and we switched to teamspeak as the web version of discord does n't pick up my microphone for some reason , even though every other voice chat does . 
  tried to download it again today because another friend suggested it . 
  i assumed the problem has been fixed , but nope , still the same . 
  what i 've tried :, 
  - deleting discord from % appdata % and local, 
  - deleting the uninstall discord registry key, 
  - updating windows 7 to the latest version, 
  - downloading older versions and public test version, 
  - copying the discordsetup to c : as well as the % appdata % folder itself, 
  none of them did anything . 
  is there someone i can contact regarding this ? 
  any way to completely scrub my system of discord so i can reinstall it ? 
  edit : found the fix !, 
  all credit to very appropriately named / u/ifixedthisshit, 
  look at his thread here https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/4p3glz/discord_installer_workaround/, 
  in case it gets deleted :, 
  have a problem with the damn installer with a fresh download or in general ? 
  constantly getting the `` update has stopped working '' error ? 
  do the following :, 
  1 ) run the damn `` discordsetup.exe '' ... let it run and keep the error message open , ignore it for now, 
  2 ) open up a file browser window and type '' % localappdata % \\ squirreltemp '', 
  3 ) cut and paste the file `` discord-0 .0.291 - full.nupkg '' into whatever directory you want it to be installed in, 
  4 ) open `` discord-0 .0.291 - full.nupkg '' with an archive viewer like izarc, 
  5 ) extract all, 
  6 ) open up the folder `` lib \\ net45 \\ '', 
  7 ) run `` discord.exe '', 
  figured this out after so much damn frustration over the stupid installer . 
  why package the file contents in this manner ?!, 
  i hope this helps anyone trying to just freaking install discord . 
  it should not have required me to even go about installing the software this way .

  obviously not something i 'd try with minors that do n't have a lot of factories , but i tried it with a few medium countries such as yugoslavia , netherlands and iran and it worked surprisingly well . 
  i usually rush to light tank ii and get the art . 
  modification , then add 1-2 to all my divisions instead of the standard 7inf 2art . 
  they do a crapton of damage and the ai ca n't seem to pierce my inf . 
  division 's armor at all until 1940-41 techs start coming along . 
  combined with towed artillery support , the soft attack you get is absolutely insane , and you seem to get a lot more bonuses than you would with your regular art spam . 
  probably going to be using it every game , unless i 'm missing other downsides aside from the obvious production costs . 
  thoughts ? 
  been using another app to browse reddit until it gave up on me completely and stopped registering my votes and subs . 
  i 'm on version 4.1.1 because of my android version . 
  is there a way to upvote/downvote posts by tapping on a post to show the arrows , or do i have to scroll left and right for every one ? 
  is there a way to quickly go to other subreddits ? 
  in the app i was using , you could start typing the name of the sub and it would bring up a list similar to google autosuggest to let you pick . 
  i seem to have to type the full name here unless i 'm doing something wrong . 
  gifv does n't seem to work for me at all , is this because of my version or just a general android thing ? 
  i 've read the sticky but want to make sure . 
  i 'm getting the 301 moved permanently error no matter what i do . 
  it 's a great app otherwise , and i really like the interface . 
  thanks in advance !, 
  i 'd like to preface this by saying that this is my first secret santa exchange , and i was terribly excited for it . 
  i did n't know who i was going to get matched with , so imagine my surprise when it turned out to be a canadian !, 
  you wo n't believe this , but one of his favorite things was hockey . 
  now i would n't necessarily describe this as unusual , except for the fact that * my * secret santa also turned out to be a canadian , or at least that 's what his gift tracking seems to suggest `` canada post : not available will take up to 2 months '', 
  i went to check out / r/serbia a few times , and there were more than a few posts of canadians asking what on earth they 're supposed to get serbs , and how and when to ship it . 
  i 've also talked to a few other serb users on reddit and both of them also seemed to have been matched with canadians . 
  is this some sort of an evil ploy by the admins , or just a coincidence ? 
  my two buddies and i are looking for more people to play the game with . 
  we 've mostly played coop up until now , but we all love playing pvp multiplayer as well . 
  we all have  1000 hours in the game . 
  18 + players are preferred , though we do n't discriminate . 
  we like using shattered europa too ( historical start ) .

  looking for a team or someone to queue up with in ranked . 
  i can play at platinum/low diamond level and have already participated in a tournament last year , getting to the finals . 
  add me ingame or on steam if you 're interested .

  this is my europe in the year of our lord 1585, 
  unable to secure strong alliances early , i was forced to make a powerbase in europe before even attempting to challenge the kebab . 
  the problem i 'm facing is that it has grown so strong i 'm not sure i 'll ever be strong enough to match it with the numbers it currently has . 
  i 've secured a foothold in africa through a series of conquests against the north africans , but the kebab has seen fit to guarantee the ( large ) ethiopia and ally tunis , effectively blocking any further expansion . 
  my coalition consists of the commonwealth , kebab , and some hre minors but it 's dropping pretty fast . 
  spain dropped our alliance rather quickly because they allied themselves to the commonwealth who is my rival , and even after removing france as my rival , france seems reluctant to drop me as theirs . 
  the uk is largely not interested , but they * have * allied austria for some reason only known to the ai . 
  wurzburg is the current hre emperor , so i 'm not too concerned about expanding into hre . 
  what should my strategy be ? 
  try to expand into europe even further ? 
  go into africa ? 
  what would you do in this situation ? 
  hey lads , i 'm having a bit of a problem . 
  long story short , this is my event that i want triggered as soon as my country is formed . 
  the problem i 'm having is that i ca n't seem to get it to trigger in my decision to form the country . 
  i can trigger it manually just fine , and the decision even says that the event `` union of blood will trigger '' in the list of things that will happen if i take it but it simply does n't , even if i let a full year pass . 
  what am i doing wrong ? 
  the command i 'm using to trigger the event in the decision file is :, 
  country_event = { id = flavor_sge .1 }, 
  the event itself :, 
  # dynasty event, 
  country_event = {, 
  picture = good_with_monarch_eventpicture, 
  is_triggered_only = yes, 
  option = { #our current dynasty will suffice . 
  name = `` flavor_sge .1 a '',
