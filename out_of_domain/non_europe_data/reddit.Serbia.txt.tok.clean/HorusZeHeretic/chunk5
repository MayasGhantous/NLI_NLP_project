  none of them . 
  what are some of the skins made specifically for national holidays aside from cringey shit like ramerica ? 
  meaning absolutely nothing - na is just a part of the smite community and adding skins for a national holiday of one country does not make any sense whatsoever . 
  please let me know when you have an actual argument . 
  that skin , and its voicepack , are absolute cringe and get a regular mute from me . 
   that 's your opinion and you 're entitled to it . 
  your opinion is wrong though . 
  if you have no argument , then do n't bother shitposting me . 
  i 'm guessing it has something to do with loki players being the worst cancer in this community . 
  i apologize !, 
  i was laughing so hard after i saw enrique , i just had to get it uploaded as soon as i could . 
   they should either use voice chat or whisper each other instead of talking shit about other players in their language and being like `` hey , they do n't understand us anyway , so we wo n't get banned '' . 
  this is what all spanish players do , every single game i encounter them . 
  i know you 're joking , but i have a russian friend who had to start saying he was from germany when people asked about his accent , because every time he said he was russian the team would start screaming `` cyka blyat '' into their mics and then mute him when he just wants to play the game . 
  i imagine it 's pretty similar to the kind of shit brazilians get when they 're playing . 
  does n't help the community . 
  this . 
  your team not doing any damage ? 
  support 's fault . 
  you did n't rotate for the gold fury fight ? 
  support 's fault . 
  you 're five levels behind the other mid laner because you keep rotating to solo to try to get a kill ? 
  support 's fault . 
  the issue is that they do n't speak english , and they have no desire to . 
  i had a game yesterday where a spanish player instalocked fenrir without saying anything , then proceeded to spam the chat with bm and rotate between lanes while feeding . 
  a couple of games later , i called support and my friend called adc , just for two other spanish players to instalock ymir/skadi and run over to duo lane as soon as the game started , then get first blooded and start bming the entire team in chat in spanish . 
  i 'm utterly sick of them , and it has gotten to the point where i instantly mute them as soon as they start talking . 
  of course . 
  the mods are :,

   do n't be rude . 
  ofcourse getting those types of players is annoying but that has little to do with them being spanish . 
  if they spoke french , german , w/e they would have been just as annoying . 
  i 've never seen a french/german person type their language ingame chat , then refuse to type in english and spam the local equivalent of `` jajajajajaja de puta madre '' . 
   if they are speaking spanish and using the spanish flag it is likely they are well spanish but that 's not even certain . 
  what you typed here is so silly i 'm not even sure how to respond . 
  why would anyone bother to buy the spanish avatar , then type in spanish just so they could `` make spaniards look bad '' when they 're doing such a great job by themselves ? 
   you are being extremely rude right now to spanish people for no reason . 
  i literally gave two reasons in the post you replied to . 
  did you bother reading it , or did me saying your fellow countrymen are the cancer of this community offend you so much you just had to type something ? 
   do n't hate on the country hate on the instalockers , bmers , intentional feeders . 
  since the country is continuing to give me all of the reasons you so conveniently provided above to hate them , i very sincerely doubt my opinion will change . 
  you 're on par with russians , except russians are just silent while they feed - at least i do n't have to listen to russian teenagers call my mother a whore in their language because they gave up first blood after diving a tower as fenrir on level two . 
  sadly , this is a european subreddit . 
  take your shit somewhere else . 
  well this has made my life a lot easier . 
  thanks !, 
  i believe you 're thinking of ranked conquest , in which case , yes , you should pick good gods and try to win . 
  casual conquest is much more relaxed , provided you do n't feed your brains out and/or bm . 
  already have them myself , here 's a code if anyone needs it bmb1f16d37f460317, 
  you are now forced to buy hide/bulwark/breastplate . 
  how is that any better ? 
  at least with sovereignty/heartward you were providing auras for your team . 
  i 'd like having clueless newbies in my conquest matches provided they learn how to play the gamemode and not just pick their diamond x loki and go 0/17/2, 
  panthera with an absolute stomp . 
  glad to see they 're still as strong as ever , hoping they can keep it up throughout the season . 
  awful idea . 
  you should be rewarded for winning games , not for losing and/or afking them . 
   dm is literally hitler though, 
  smite teenagers , everyone . 
   age does n't equate to skill/maturity . 
  yes it does . 
  why do we need a fat goddess ? 
  why ? 
  outside of a very few religions , goddesses were generally depicted as images of human perfection . 
  while i would n't mind having fatter goddesses because of their specific lore , i hope they do n't shoehorn them in for some reason . 
  finally , my time has come . 
  seriously , no adapting on the list already ? 
   be that football , soccer ,, 
  why are you mentioning the same thing twice ? 
   xing is fine, 
  i have 800 worshipers on him . 
  no , he 's not . 
  and this is why reddit should n't balance smite . 
  what would he clear with ? 
  his 3 ? 
  wait , you probably do n't even fucking play him . 
  i 'm getting the feeling you dislike supports ever so slightly . 
  yes he does need a clear , you fucking idiot . 
  every god in the game has some sort of a clear , and removing damage from his 2 is so mind mindbogglingly stupid of a suggestion i 'm not even sure if you 're trolling or not . 
  i have mastery x on khepri , ares , athena , geb , and ymir . 
  my other guardians are v or higher . 
  then again , what the fuck do i know ? 
  i 'm not the one suggesting we remove damage from khepri 's two . 
   id rather remove the damage aspect, 
  fuck off with your trolling . 
  agreed !, 
  i have no idea why smite reddit has such a hardon for artemis .
