  i believe the last country he visited was ukraine . 
  is there any proof that the killers were muslim ? 
  1 ) postanes pausalac . 
  tako je . 
  to je kada postanes pausalac , tj . 
  yeah , it 's much cleaner to put a pot smoker into for-profit prison for decade or more . 
  fuck this , i 'm going back to c. 
  what it could gain ? 
  us healthcare model ? 
  i think us destroys everything it touches , i wish them to keep relations the same . 
  i do n't know . 
  carpenter is not an engineer , but he can still build a house . 
  front-end developer is closer to carpenter than an engineer . 
  why do you think they are not doing that , probably 10 times more often ? 
  who would report such a thing ? 
  ` america ' never existed , it was just an illusion made possible with shit load of money . 
  but people are lacking money now , so everyone started looking from different angle . 
  [ not so bright in the us too i guess ] ( http://theantimedia.org/nypd-to-permanently-patrol-protests-with-machine-guns/ ), 
  [ failling state you say ? 
  ] ( http://theantimedia.org/nypd-to-permanently-patrol-protests-with-machine-guns/ ), 
  so militarization of us police is not true ? 
  okay , i get information from official news too . 
  do you like this news source more ? 
  [ same news ] ( http://nypost.com/2015/01/30/nypd-to-launch-a-beefed-up-counterterrorism-squad/ ), 
  i guess you 're right about that . 
  but the point is the same . 
  under pretext of terrorism , you 're getting more and more prevented from taking a stance at a protest at some future date . 
  it 's same thing you people judge in foreign countries , but when it 's happening on your soil it 's wrapped as a candy bar . 
  i agree , but those really good points stand . 
  they are trying to insert another layer of police , just like they inserted another layer into transport ( tsa ) , that in the end of the day , only serve to control the average citizen . 
  native americans did something similar . 
  so why us does n't attack saudi arabia ? 
  they seem far worse than iraq and syria . 
  oh wait , they are closest allies . 
  nice, 
  yep , it would create another shit-hole , just like with iraq and syria . 
  not really for the death penalty , but for supporting isis .

  also , i did n't realize us conducts death penalty on blasphemers ? 
  iran gained so much positive reviews from the public , that i think it 's a matter of time when iran gets framed by west . 
  at least they agree on something . 
  seems like the system is not working . 
  it 's not about debt anymore . 
  they are not stealing anything . 
  they are ukrainians . 
  besides , why are n't ukrainians defending it properly ? 
  because no one wa n't to join the joke of the government they have , and they know they would just fight for us interest . 
  maybe us could cancel the sanctions which are destroying them . 
  it 's like , `` oh , you are so pooooor , you should n't be socialist , that 's baaad '' while holding a baseball bat over beaten up person . 
  i wish the ukraine government would just leave eastern-ukrainians alone . 
  let them be an independent and self-determined nation . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  syrian rebels live in syria , which is the jurisdiction of the syrian government . 
  from a diplomatic perspective us should have no say or authority over syria 's affairs . 
  that 's what it means to be an independent nation . 
  us support for the rebels is appalling and against international law . 
  us is a state sponsor of terror run by a largest military complex in the world who reeks of corruption and ties to globe wide organized crime . 
  do n't think for one second us cares about liberating anyone . 
  they just want to use syria as a buffer to iran and russia . 
  iraq ( 150.000-1 .000.000 wiki ), 
  libya ( 25.000 ), 
  tunis ( 500-1500 ), 
  those numbers represent civilian deaths .

  i found many issues with responsive using bootstraps modal . 
  i 'm using [ ngdialog ] ( https://github.com/likeastore/ngdialog ) now , and i 'm happy with it . 
  `` on july 7th 2014 , a t-54 from a museum in donetsk was commissioned into the armed forces of novorossiya . '', 
  do n't forget they are closest allies . 
  i think i came up with a solution for world crisis !, 
  give everyone a shit load of money , and there wo n't be any conflicts .

  could you explain me what he did to deserve ` terrible dictator ' ? 
  yeah , shame on them !, 
  us were never involved in any coup whatsoever .

  if he worked with angular for 14 months and needed to ` refresh his mind ' about ` compile ` , ` link ` , ` controller ` , ` = ` , ` @ ` or ` & ` then why in hell would i read his blog ? 
  he just copied the content of some other posts , and promoted it like it 's own . 
  no no no , you 're posting irrelevant stuff . 
  it has to be about russia , and it has to show them in bad light . 
  why are you doing this , are you payed putin-bot ? 
  ha , they 're not in chicago . 
  i worked with angular and haml , and it is annoying to write .
