carcassonne definitely , and arles . 
  marseille is the second biggest city in france . 
  true , i think the same . 
  i have n't signed a non-compete , so i will tell them the name of the company if they ask . 
  thanks !, 
  you 're probably right , and i have n't signed a non-compete . 
  thank you !, 
  i 'd give you a gold for this , but we do n't get paypal where i 'm from . 
  i 'm in the south of france , eating delicious 2-star michelin indian-french fusion cuisine . 
  penises are already pretty great as they are , but if i could choose , then - adjustable length/width with an extra part just for stimulating my g-spot and clit simultaneously . 
  posing for photos . 
  puppets . 
  anything that should n't be moving , but did . 
  strange how much forethought men need to put into fapping . 
  it 's so simple for women , i realise now . 
  your boyfriend might want to visit his dentist as well , to check if any infections in his mouth are transferring to you . 
  body ph gets thrown off balance by sugar , and this opens up possibilities for a number of health issues . 
  candida overgrowth is one , and has a number of side-effects that you could n't imagine come from that . 
  sugar also messes with your appetite , causing cravings and making you feel hungry very often . 
  bad skin is another effect , decreased immunity another . 
  source - my experiences with too much sugar , but you might not develop the same problems i had . 
  i 've cut if from my diet totally , and all the side-effects i mentioned above have disappeared . 
  yes , as i 've said , my own experience with eating too much refined sugar over the years , and subsequently removing it from my diet . 
  you might not develop the same problems i had , but in my case , it all came down to too much refined sugar . 
  edit : you for op, 
  what do you consider a reputable source ? 
  i 'm asking seriously . 
  i wrote down my own experiences with too much refined sugar in my diet , and how it has affected my body , and the benefits i 've had when i cut it out . 
  i have n't bookmarked any of the sources that first made me try out this approach , but i could look back through them , and get back to you . 
  self-facial . 
  see ? 
  i 'd upvote again if i could . 
  the last one with the faux-cats looking into the aquarium is a bit sad . 
  i hope you get to have a live cat of your own one day < 3, 
  was just gon na say the same . 
  great in theory ? 
  i really like this photo . 
  but what happened to you ? 
  it looks like a milk tooth that did n't fall out . 
  how old is your cat ? 
  one of mine also had double canines for a while , before he lost his baby teeth . 
  i think the tooth might just fall out on it 's own then . . 
  this is a wonderful project . 
  let me just express my appreciation , even though you will probably not see this comment . 
  personally , shapeless fat would be a turnoff for me . 
  if you can carry it , then it 's ok . 
  but this is just my point of view , tastes differ , and for every body shape and size , there 's going to be someone out there who likes it . 
  much more important , imo , is keeping healthy , health is attractive . 
  thank you very much . 
  i 'd say healthy as in feels good in his body , has energy , and yes , eats well . 
  this is very much like a situation i found myself in with my mom , some 15 years ago . 
  i 'll give you my take on your situation , and a suggestion , i hope it helps ... 
  i had wanted to do a similar degree to the one your daughter is interested in , but my mother flat out refused to pay for my school . 
  the scholarship was not nearly as much as the one your daughter would need for her schooling , but was still very substantial . 
  i had plans to work my way through college and help in that way . 
  i had talent , as confirmed by my professors at the time , and this was what i wanted to do in my life . 
  ** now the important bit ** - my mother refused to pay for my school because she did not see my interest as something serious and did not believe this was what i should do with my life . 
  she believed i should complete a degree in something sensible , less risky , as a life profession . 
  this lack of belief on her side has damaged our relationship severely . 
  years later , i saw another side to her decision , the lack of money for an expensive school . 
  but the thing that stuck with me was her lack of belief in me . 
  so here 's my suggestion - if you must refuse to pay for your daughter 's schooling , do it for the reason of lack of money . 
  ** do not ** refuse her because you do n't believe she could be good enough to succeed in her chosen profession . 
  saying that paying money for your daughter 's education could be a waste is just about the worst thing you could say to her . 
  have you looked into schools in europe ? 
  there are some excellent film degrees out there that do n't cost nearly as much . 
  offer you daughter some alternatives , a different school , or workshops that give her a taste of what film school would be like . 
  give her an opportunity to change her mind and see the realities of working in film . 
  good luck with your decision !, 
  that 's the creepiest uncanny valley horror i 've ever seen . 
  and it all works on a subliminal level , i actually felt the hair raise on my head . 
  dogs : eating their own poo, 
  cats : jumping off the 3rd floor window, 
  girl too . 
  i find it really annoying and will be interested in guys that speak to me as an equal , not down to me . 
  have your thyroid checked out , problems with it might be causing both your depression and balding . 
  do you have an approximate idea how much the dental work would cost ? 
  dental tourism was exactly what i had in mind . 
  i 'm from europe , where it 's becoming more common for people from western europe to go to eastern europe to get their teeth done . 
  but then you 've probably considered this option already . 
  two novels come to mind - the first andrei makine 's ` the life of an unknown man ' , about the life of an extraordinary man for the time and place he lives in , yet who remains unknown in historical terms . 
  the other is romantic , light reading - ` the time traveller 's wife ' , by audrey niffenegger , where the main character , despite his rough circumstances is gently treated . 
  i 'm also interested in novels with this view of male characters , it 's a really interesting way to frame a book suggestion request . 
  dee brown , bury my heart at wounded knee . 
  she 's not going to be working with op any more , that 's why he wants to ask her out . 
  in recruitment , sifting through applicants is like picking wild mushrooms - if they 're a maybe , they 're a no . 
  e.m. forster , a passage to india, 
  paul scott , the raj quartet, 
  anthony burgess , the long day wanes, 
  hi hostels are usually among the worse accommodation possibilities . 
  from my experience ( i do n't know if this applies to the whole network ) they also have lockout in the middle of the day , which is quite annoying . 
  still , if you have the card , you get a discount . 
  also , some places i 've been to , the only hostel option available was an hi hostel . 
  so i 'd say the decision to get the hi card depends on the cost of the card , and how much you 'll save if you do use it . 
  might be worth to check if the price for getting the card is the same in every country , or cheaper in some , and more expensive in others . 
  if you 're under 26 , it will definitely be worth it to get a european youth card , and student ids help as well - isic , the international student identity card , is also great . 
  source : used them all, 
  i think this might be it - http://www.delanceyplace.com/view-archives.php?p=2137, 
  alright , so here are some things i wish someone had told me before i 'd orgasmed for the first time ( female perspective ) . 
  i know everyone is an individual , but hope this helps !,
