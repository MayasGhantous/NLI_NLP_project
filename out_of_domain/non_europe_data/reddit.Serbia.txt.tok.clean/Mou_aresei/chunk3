  - the news was very hateful . 
  one time there was a passenger train struck by rockets . 
  many people were killed and they showed the footage on the news in the daytime . 
  there were black shapes littering the slopes beneath the train . 
  it was burned corpses of the passengers , completely black . 
  one of them had a cracked skull and cooked brains showing . 
  they looked like scrambled eggs . 
  - even many years after the bombing , i still was n't able to listen to the sound of the alert sirens . 
  - many people got cancer after the bombing , supposedly as a result of the uranium used . 
  my mother as well . 
  - the rockets exploding at night used to look a bit like a weak sunrise on the horizon . 
  - no one i knew got killed . 
   layer cake, 
  great cast , how have i not heard about this one ? 
  also , thought of another one , [ filth ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1450321/ ) , heavy but awesome !, 
  thank you for that , i am , or at least i try to . 
  one upside of going through horrible events , at least to me , is that you get perspective on what matters and what does n't matter much , and you do n't sweat the small stuff . 
  and humor is always important !, 
  you are right , and it 's a very good point , people get used to everything , even very extreme situations and those circumstances are then perceived as normal . 
  i did n't even get to see much conflict , compared to what others went through , i was a child during the break up of yugoslavia . 
  smooth & refreshing \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  a guy had applied with a cv that did n't match his cover letter , or the role he was applying for . 
  we googled some of the sentences from his cover letter and saw that he had lifted the whole thing from a sample cover letter online . 
  a fear that my biggest internal motivator is being loved by someone . 
  i should be self sufficient . 
  the greek version of lms , put me off cigarettes for a while . 
  xenjael thank you . 
  i posted it [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/3ye62r/civilian_accounts_of_strategic_bombing_in/cyd7u1h ), 
  welcome , glad if it did help !, 
  the xx , very chill out , try the intro and go from there . 
  really glad you like them , enjoy !, 
  from a balcony i see some children run by , a boy and a girl of about 8-10 yrs old . 
  she has him on a leash , an actual leash around his neck , and he 's barking . 
  i laughed out loud . 
  absolutely not . 
  i do not have children as yet , but the only situation in which i would see myself hitting a child is if the child is almost fully grown , i.e. 
  a teenager , and attacks me first . 
  i do n't see it as a plausible situation , so no . 
  and i 've had quite enough of being beaten as a child to want to force someone else to go through it as well . 
  putting up with all the beliefs you know will be proven scientifically wrong in the future . 
  i decide to stop procrastinating , get off reddit and get back to what i 'm supposed to be doing now . 
  it 's made all the difference , thank you . 
  you 're right , came back to refresh . 
  ahhh . 
  i see what you did there . 
  yugoslavia - heavy on the russian classics which i detested . 
  the one novel i loved was kafka 's trial , and would recommend to anyone for sure . 
  only this is [ way sexier . 
  ] ( http://blog.stevenwilkin.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/clerksii-screenshot.jpg ), 
  supposedly that 's exactly how it went , [ i found this article really interesting . ], 
  ( http://www.drmomma.org/2010/03/we-came-barefoot-naked-and-covered-in.html ) the relevant bit starts from `` us , once upon a time '' . 
  most certainly . 
  that story about native trackers and the super sensory perceptions they have thanks to their long hair . 
  woman here , grew up with my mother , my parents divorced when i was a few months old . 
  for lack of a father figure , up until some 6-7 years ago i never understood that men had feelings or any emotional depth . 
  they were just two-dimensional beings . 
  that changed with my first serious relationships . 
  i can imagine how bizarre that sounds , but it was exactly like that . 
  the upside is that had my parents stayed together , it would not have been a healthy atmosphere to grow up in , they were not a good match . 
  i felt loved and cared for with a single parent and did n't feel like anything was missing , it was just the normal way of things . 
  that 's awful !, 
  the worst thing i got stuck in my inhaler was a piece of tissue paper that then stuck to the back of my throat . 
  i ca n't imagine the horror !, 
   tldr : ~ ~ it 's five sentences , just read it . ~ ~, 
  check for cockroaches in inhaler before use . 
  take this photo to / r/photoshopbattles, 
  ask reddit to fix it for you, 
  get back to us with the results, 
  not sure if this is what you had in mind , but here 's a list of some festivals in eastern europe :, 
  -- serbia , [ white week ] ( http://kamerades.com/2015/02/22/the-end-of-the-white-week/ ), 
  -- greece , [ bell roads ] ( http://www.lifo.gr/team/omorfia/46401 ), 
  -- bulgaria , [ kukeri ] ( http://www.studyenglishtoday.net/kukeri-festival-pernik.html ), 
  and i 'm going to [ this one ] ( http://www.exploringmacedonia.com/vevcani-carnival.nspx ), 
  in about a week . 
  you mean like [ these ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/b4/d7/e5/b4d7e59b4b12b000ca0817b8d3029cb3.jpg ) ? 
  thanks :-) i think these are all remnants of pagan rituals , mixed in with christianity . 
  are you in romania ? 
  i recently saw a photo series of a kind of bear festival in romania ( i believe ) that looked really interesting . 
  i 've already visited the one i 'll be going to this year as well and loved it !, 
  i do hope you find the one you 're looking for . 
  the historic election in south africa in 1994 , when everyone had a chance to vote for the first time , and nelson mandela was elected for president . 
  haha , no , i meant this [ whole series ] ( http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/02/romanias-dancing-drinking-bears/ ) . 
  i thought it looked really good . 
  but i think i 've also seen the photo of the bear boy , a couple of years back , if we mean the same one . 
  it had no context at all , and looked amazing , very evocative !, 
  no , have n't heard of the martisor , i can imagine what a sweet tradition it would be . 
  it seems people do know and practice these rituals without being aware of it :-), 
  edit : amazing when local traditions become globally known , it gives you a different perspective . 
  you should do an ama on your bear-ing days :-), 
  even funnier would be seeing the cat 's owner trying to squeeze himself through an equally tiny hole . 
  poor cat . 
  shared a dorm room with an aging hippie kind of guy . 
  he `` purified '' the room by burning some kind of wood , slept ( hairy ) butt naked , and finally changed rooms because an indian guy in the same room was giving him bad vibes . 
  he was a nice guy anyway , and right about the indian too , because the indian woke me up in the middle of next night , touching me . 
  i had him thrown out of the room the next day . 
  do n't know if it 's the best , but it 's one story . 
  http, 
  muff cabbage and hayley jetpacking, 
  edit : very cute , mine do something similar :-), 
  a man being helpful and kind in any way - washing the dishes .
