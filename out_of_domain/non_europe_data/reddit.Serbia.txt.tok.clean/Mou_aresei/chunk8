  same here !, 
  why is that ? 
  picture please ? 
  pics ^ or ^ it ^ did n't ^ happen, 
  ok , that 's pretty interesting . 
  the strangest things can turn out to be an advantage . 
  but in my case , i do n't need to be looking at the sun to start sneezing , it 's enough just to be in the sun . 
  any idea why ? 
  pretty cool :-) does it actually bend as well , so you have 3 joints instead of 2 in your finger ? 
  or is it just the line ? 
  so it 's a real super power , funny :-) can you post a picture of the other side , or of the finger bent , where you can see the extra joint in action ? 
  i have that same texture issue , this is the first time i hear someone mention it !, 
  that is the worst feeling . 
  it 's kind of related to another sensory issue i have , i wonder if you have the same - the worst feeling is having my teeth touched by any kind of dry material , like a cloth . 
  it 's pure horror . 
  it does , yes . 
  or from colder to hotter . 
  i was the only idiot sneezing my lungs out on the beach every summer as a child . 
  ali sad je drugo . 
  so i am not alone !, 
  just thinking about it is horrible . 
  i 'd call that a severe case of hypocrisy . 
  do n't feel bad about it , you dodged a bullet . 
  happy to help !, 
  do away with nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction !, 
  for a boy or a girl . 
  it would be even more awesome if i actually had the child with him .

  sweet !, 
  35 , first gray hairs starting to come in . 
  also becoming more horny as the years go by  i 'm turning into a milf . 
  this is fantastic , thanks for the laugh !, 
  also karma . 
  yep , it 's just a regular coffee though . 
  if you get served a third coffee , you know it 's a sikterusa , you 've overstayed and it 's time to leave . 
  unless it 's a reference to swallowing ? 
  are you czech by any chance ? 
  cute dog , 
  woman here . 
  how does it feel ? 
  and does it feel better if someone else does it for you , or when you do you ? 
  scratching an itch . 
  i propose this subreddit changes its name to r/wildlyinteresting . 
  hey there , congratulations on your success , 
  how do you decide on the snacks which you offer ? 
  i 'm from the balkans , came here to also say well done on offering bajadera chocolates , they are awesome . 
  but smoki and prima are really not the best choice for a serbian snack . 
  do you know about [ jaffa cakes ] ( https://shop.maxi.rs/upload/items2016/thumb960/7176157.jpg ) , [ medeno srce ] ( http://www.konzumshop.ba/images/products/041/04140234l.gif ) , and these [ peanut butter filled pretzel sticks ] ( http://online.idea.rs/images/products/446/446104544_1l.gif ) ? 
  also , these are hands down the best chocolate stuffed biscuits i 've ever tried - [ tutky ] ( http://www.oezaltun.de/image/cache/data/eti/eti_tutku-500x500.png ) . 
  i think they are from turkey , not sure . 
  well til too i guess . 
  funny , i thought no one outside the balkans knew about them . 
  wonderful tutku !, 
  we have turkey to thank for many more delicious dishes in the balkans , 
  in the balkans , this is a [ cake ] ( https://coolinarika-cdn.azureedge.net/image/262d54e4301022b16b6805a6badbf548_view_l.jpg?v=1 ) so nope xd . 
  is it really a debate ? 
  edit : oh man , i just realised , they 're called cakes !, 
  here we call them keks , which really means biscuit , even though they are spelled cakes on the box . 
  well til really ahahha . 
  just came here to say this . 
  photoshopped to hell and back . 
  nice photo though . 
  amen , amen !, 
  an app that would translate signs in a foreign language . 
  idk if it already existed when i thought it up , but it sure does exist now . 
  yeah , that 's kind of an obvious app xd, 
  cheddar with cheddar ... and why does the cheese have that unnatural orange colour ? 
  please take a moment to understand that this unfortunate situation you are all in is most difficult on your daughters . 
  they are already being punished by the consequences of their actions . 
  please , please do n't make it any harder on them than it already is . 
  give them your support , as soon as you can . 
  this is really not about you , this is about them . 
  all kids make mistakes , and the main thing is to learn from them . 
  this is the moment when you can present yourself as a parent your daughters can trust . 
  be on their side . 
  cool off , and think about how your present actions can have long-term consequences on your mutual relationships . 
  remember that it will be alright , everyone will be alright . 
  edited to add : you are not a failed father !, 
  your children will make mistakes , you can not live their lives for them . 
  the best you can do is to help them through those mistakes . 
  hi there , welcome to belgrade . 
  try out the grain silos in lower dor\u0107ol , and there should be other abandoned places there as well . 
  i took a look at some of your pictures , cool interests , 
  also , have you been to bigz ? 
  edited to add : check out sinnerman jazz club in trg nikole pa\u0161i\u0107a . 
  ah , ok . do you have a blog or something else where you post ? 
  also the [ belgrade photo month ] ( http://www.belgradephotomonth.org/en/home/ ) is now on . 
  is it the artget gallery by any chance ? 
  that 's a very good one . 
  come to kc grad this evening , there 's an opening at 8 by one of our best photo collectives , [ the kamerades ] ( https://www.facebook.com/events/1866996880252973/ ) . 
  edit : plenty of awesome photographers will be there too !, 
  my ex did . 
  the same ex that complained about me using too much toilet paper . 
  it was a shock when i realised his level of un-hygiene tbh . 
  that is one of the reasons he 's an ex . 
  super cool app , well done !, 
  christian orthodox priests still do n't . 
  i 've got the hate for her :d . 
  but what i do like about her character is that it 's not 2-dimensional . 
  she feels pretty human , even if she has a negative role .
