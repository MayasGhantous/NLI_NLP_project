  i do pirate everything i watch because i do n't have magic internet money . 
  but i would pay if i could ... maybe not , i 'm a selfish jerk . 
  is n't my love enough ? 
  well they do n't have a lot of time and their setup is n't the best, 
  yes !, 
  jorl delivered !, 
  they do gaming news on machinima 's main channel every day . 
  their fanbase is also crazy like this one , i love it, 
  satsui no dreadou, 
  kill 'em before they fly away and have a family . 
  waiting for new naruto episodes . 
  recently finished watching attack on titan , jojo 's bizarre adventure , code geas : lelouch of the rebellion ( started watching the 2nd season ) . 
  started watching jojo stardust crusaders , terraformars , macross frontier . 
  finishing high school of the dead and kill la kill . 
  i saw a couple of sword art online episodes , not sure if i want to continue that tho ... got ta get around to watching ghost in the shell, 
  i do n't read manga and i 'm not really keeping up with stuff they got going on over there . 
  but i love their games . 
  i wish they did more stuff for pc . 
  installing the last remnant right now , wan na see what it 's like . 
  seems kinda cool from screenshots . 
  am also excite for ff xv,

  meanwhile at [ ubisoft ] ( http://www.dealspwn.com/twitter-reacts-ubisoft-abandons-steam-invite-piracy-184804 ), 
  just saw it on n4g . 
  i love when ubisoft shows up in the headlines there . 
  i think they riked it more than dmc 2, 
  todd howard 's voice reminds me of that jazz voodoo guy from mighty boosh, 
  a few weeks ago a guy tried to rob a gas station with a boomerang ( australia ) .

  ok , i 'm off to bed . 
  but ... but ... the french revolution !, 
  everyone wanted ** that ** !, 
  your face reminds me of gaben . 
  that 's as good as a hot girl . 
  upvoted . 
  we should ask the people on hentai foundry to make some ig art, 
  instead of another ps4 vs xboxone podcast , dedicate a whole podcast to this story . 
  this would be a jerk/fun playthrough name : geese howard . 
  just be a jerk , everyone gets bodied . 
  oooh nice,

  we need the livescream fanfiction : 2 scream harder, 
  * chooses renegade option * every man for himself ... 
  burn sure ? 
  i 'd like a dlc or expansion about vampires and stuff , but i doubt they will mention vampires again . 
  the vampires from castlevania lords of shadow look pretty [ monstrous ] ( http://img4.meristation.com/files/imagenes/juegos/pc/action/castlevania_lords_of_shadow_-_ultimate_edition/1370443143-olrox.jpg ) . 
  or do you mean something like [ alucard ] ( http://media.animevice.com/uploads/4/43612/794852-alucard_hellsing_anime_420376.jpg ) from hellsing , he 's fucking op and scary . 
  i wish they never mentioned vampires in that entry . 
  vampires should be cool , not ghosts in shape of rags . 
  i 've never thought about it , but most of the demons in da kinda suck . 
  aleks is best alex, 
  i think that was the point , making alucard so powerful . 
  and the reapers and ghouls from castlevania look really [ similar ] ( http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20101016004043/castlevania/images/e/e3/ghoul.png ), 
  blame abstergo, 
  well this is cool ... 
  the ears look disgusting , i never noticed that . 
  probably because i use hair that 's all over the place, 
  me too .
