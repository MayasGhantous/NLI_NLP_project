  * schhhwp * ** trooper ** : orders sir ? 
  ** nv-15 ** : execute them , soldier . 
  ** jedi ** : wait !, 
  please !, 
  ** nv-15 ** : stand down , soldier ... 
  were you saying something about rebel plans ? 
  ** jedi ** : ... 
  yes ... 
  yes i was ... just ... do n't hurt them , please !, 
  ** nv-15 ** : thank you for your cooperation , jedi . 
  darth rend will be here shortly to assist . 
  currently interrogating him . 
  he is willing to spill some secrets . 
  perfect timing, 
  ** jedi : ** i 've already agreed to tell you !, 
  leave them out of this !, 
  ** nv-15 : ** they became a part of this the moment they decided to help you . 
  please , begin talking . 
  ** jedi : ** my lightsaber ... 
  the frequency of the blade ... 
  there are coordinates in it . 
  listen to it , scan through it with your tech , i do n't know ... 
  i 've been told that a small rebel fleet is stationed there . 
  where ever that is ... 
  i did n't have a chance to decipher it . 
  my mission was to join their ranks . 
  nothing else . 
  ** nv-15 ** : what a creative way of hiding coordinates . 
  orders , my lord ? 
  understood . 
  is this for the record or shall i stop the recording ? 
  * end of recording *, 
  jedi : '' ... 
  they 're just kids who lost their parrents ... and i 'm sure you 'll figure out that the girl is force sensitive sooner or later ... 
  so i 'm asking you ... do n't hurt them ... turn them into sith and soldiers ... forgive me master ... 
  i have failed you ... 
  end me now , sith ... 
  i do not wish to meet these children on the battlefield ... '', 
  here is [ the recording ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/empiredidnothingwrong/comments/45nqtk/cold_hunt_squad_requesting_orders_we_have_located/czz4ax3 ) once again in case the transfer failed . 
  the cold hunt squad will come back online in a few hours . 
  we need to perform maintenance . 
  it is extremly important in our case . 
  we will contact you again if you have further instructions . 
  jedi : `` the fleet i mentioned before ... 
  i believe that there 's a collector or archeologist among them . 
  collects relics from both sides . 
  might be holocrons ... might be just decorations . 
  that 's all i know ... '' * he lowers his head like he 's lost all hope . 
  * the jedi does n't respond . 
  he 's completely broken . 
  he has utterly failed and he knows it . 
  he was responsible for crashing on that asteroid , could n't decipher the code and he did n't have enough to satisfy his captors . 
  all that he can do is simply stare at the floor with a blank face . 
  waiting for his end . 
  we can be deployed again in a few hours . 
  and if you feel the need to dispose of the physical units just in case , do so . 
  new bodies are expensive but always ready . 
  the ai operates from a secret location . 
  * the jedi mind does n't reveal anything useful . 
  self pity and despair are the only thing found in his head now . 
  jedi : `` kill me you ... 
  * he is thrashing his head and body around against the restrainings while spouting and spitting gibberish . 
  it is more like madness than rage . 
  jedi : `` up the emperor 's ass ! '', 
  * he starts laughing like a maniac and ends up crying *, 
  i am sending my secondary units . 
  the prime unit will remain here . 
  i can also take control of your other droids to increase their performance . 
  just give the order . 
  it 's missing some shrek tbh, 
  i love the idea of db retiring and making ads . 
  every inn and store would have `` i 'm the mighty dragonborn and this is my favorite ... '', 
  / r/empiredidnothingwrong, 
  damn dude . 
  is this a pasta pizza ? 
  custom combat droid . 
  leader of cold hunt squad . 
  a squad comprised of droids . 
  what does `` action '' game mean here ? 
  a clicker , full 3d spectacle fighter , fighting game ? 
  ho boy ... if they follow in mts 's footsteps the full album will be the hypest, 
  watching my grandma drink beer at a party, 
  time for some gwent, 
  `` voodoo magic ... fuckin ' voodoo magic , man ! '', 
  [ we removed a lot of vday shitposts from our front page . 
  honestly , we hate the day ], 
  what even is gay ? 
  it 's just atoms getting really close to each other, 
  fucked up subreddits are the best tho . 
  bbq, 
  i 'm always with the `` bad guys '' because they did n't do anything wrong . 
  yes , but you wo n't be working with the original unit . 
  you 'll be working with a few of my nv-15b units . 
  they 'll probably be disposed of after the mission , and i 'd rather keep my primary unit . 
  also ... do we have an eta on the mission start ? 
  i beat dmc3 dante must die difficulty on a broken keyboard . 
  i almost went insane at the arkham fight but it still counts counts, 
  tunngle has a tutorial http://www.tunngle.net/wiki/network:call_of_duty:_black_ops_ii, 
  you ca n't . 
  and the default kb controls are horrible .
