  do a nice thing for a person ? 
  nope, 
  one of these days then, 
  if we cut down the trees and the tree whores wo n't have anywhere else to go . 
  if the game is like this personality test it 'll give me lots of murder boners . 
  not a lot of `` evil '' choices in games these days . 
  a macrophome ?!, 
  not all faggots are homosexuals either, 
  his name is aleks btw . 
  a funny russian boy , he is, 
  what 's he doing these days ? 
  to me it is . 
  i hate being a goody shoes . 
  but when a game does evil correctly it 's like a drug . 
  the 2 new shadowrun games did it really well imo . 
  i think we can trust obsidian with doing it right . 
  i said `` think '' because i did n't really play any of their games to the end . 
  i do n't like fallout , alpha protocol was n't great , i do n't like old school rpgs like pillars and i do n't remember the rest . 
  i made a house in the side of a mountain . 
  the entrance would open up like a mouth and fire flaming arrows . 
  is this a reference or something ? 
  does 98 count as the 90 's ? 
  til, 
  iirc they 're gon na be with m for a long time, 
  puberty is like a buff so it do n't really count imo . 
  skeletor really is the dankest, 
  that which is fred may never stop dursting . 
  maybe she 's having sex with an invisiblessed ghost, 
  they, 
  some of us helped him, 
  now i 'm motivated to watch that even more . 
  during, 
  seems like they thought it would be the definitive version . 
  i kind of did that too in gamedev tycoon . 
  i could n't figure out what the hell i was supossed to do in the game but it worked for me on win10, 
  found this shit too http://geektyper.com/, 
  check these out / r/awwschwitz / r/hitlerinsocks, 
  `` oooh i 'm livin ' in a nightmaaare ... '',

  \\  restoration, 
  \\  perfectly valid school of magic,

  i really like that word tbh, 
  the mask must find a new host, 
  i do n't mod for free , friend . 
  aliens is better than predators . 
  predator is better than everything tho, 
  i loved playing as a dragon priest-ish character too . 
  he was a lich that fought mostly with shouts , conjuration and daedric artifacts . 
  i made my own more powerful copies of the artifacts too . 
  we still are . 
  we just tell ourselves sweet little lies of the `` golden age '' or `` james small age '', 
  they 're too scurred . 
  luckily ustabiaz saved the day with their lp, 
  that was a really cool part of the game, 
  dragon age 2 . 
  people shit on it but i loved it . 
  you 're not the chosen one right away . 
  you have to work for it . 
  literally one of the first actual quests it to get enough money for an expedition to get loot . 
  there needs to be a band named d * something * a * something * e * something *, 
  it actually really complicated , so ... 
  the damage has been done .

  you 're a white male, 
  and, 
  do they actually use exos in real combat ? 
  people act like ms is going to rob you and send hitmen after you,
