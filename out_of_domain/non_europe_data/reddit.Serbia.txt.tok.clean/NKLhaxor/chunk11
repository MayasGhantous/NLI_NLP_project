  kids are monsters . 
  baby food in 60fps glory !, 
  we need a citadel dlc for da, 
  not a theme but a something that some rpgs really need .

  i do n't like being the hero 24/7 . 
  finishing every difficulty in devil may cry 3 on a ** janky ** keyboard .

  i played every bioware game . 
  and nope , not evil enough . 
  barely evil . 
  nope . 
  i love da2 super more than dao . 
  origins reminded me if nwn ... 
  i wanted to like them , but they are too slow for my taste ( combat ) . 
  also , no player voice . 
  i hate that . 
  whatever you say gabe, 
  i got that comment with the sos mod,

  the 1st vid i watched on his channel was the gta4 pedophile video , i did n't even know it was him . 
  but the very 1st was something on machinima respawn i think . 
  i read all that in seamus ' / ssohpkc 's voice, 
  well , panic would be a wast of time for me , so i would do whatever i 'd want to . 
  n [ we 're all the same amount of crazy so everything is going smoothly ! ], 
  g [ are you sure ? ], 
  n [ ye . . yes , right ? 
  right ! ], 
  they do n't have to play it personally , they can give orders to someone else to do it for them , while they do president stuff . 
  i guess it would be a week long match tho . 
  guys , i have n't read much about falskaar . 
  what kind of story am i looking at ( the name does n't sound really exciting it sounds like a name for a deer ) ? 
  is it an epic story or just a bunch of small quests in the new area ? 
  ha ha !, 
  i just finished watching r1 and r2 and holy crap ... 
  i never thought that i would hate so many girls in an anime , especially ** her ** !, 
  what are you waiting for , embrace eternity or whatever ... 
  the classic crew is with garrus in his baller mansion . 
  lelouch/zero from code geass , as the master of strategy . 
  my femhawke from dragon age 2 for jolly murder and humor . 
  vergil from devil may cry ( original series ) for coolness . 
  the guy from rogue warrior for constant nonstop infinite cursing . 
  the classic alien killing machine serious sam . 
  grandma swamp for stealing pies and orbital salt attacks . 
  wish i had enough patience to set up rainmeter on my pc ...

  '' * dao diceroll slugfest * '' thank you so much for saying those words . 
  looks better than the fade . 
  it 's made out of freaking cheese !, 
  man , i ca n't wait for mc railman vs nova in this series !, 
  death is just a number anyway ...

  just drop some food for ubisoft in the hole for the time being , and lets pick up the pitchforks and torches against denuvo . 
  feet are the worst thing ever . 
  wear socks , people . 
  oh look , that is the girl i saved earlier . 
  i 'll just sit right over there by * that fucking window *,

  evil is so much more fun . 
  skyrim for pimps !, 
  crotch guzzler ftw !, 
  the grass looks so nice and soft in anime . 
  irl it 's like ... green things coming out of dirt , ugh ... 
  imagine like in a sports tournament or something , a guy makes a comeback and rules of nature starts blasting around him . 
  what 's different about it except for the animation ? 
  i only saw a bit of the 1st episode of the original and then i watched all of ultimate .
