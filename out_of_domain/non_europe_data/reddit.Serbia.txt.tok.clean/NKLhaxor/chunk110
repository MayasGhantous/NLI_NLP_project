  it 's all just loud noise so call it that, 
  [ the replies are fucking great ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cfffq--w8am_5f2.jpg:large ), 
  wow . 
  the cult has / \\ gents everywhere, 
  his entrance is just a bunch of jojo poses, 
  i read about the organs of a marine . 
  holy shit , i 'm not going any deeper . 
  there 's even a rage mode where you pull out 2 knives and go stab crime . 
  or you can throw them and pull out more knives and throw them again .

  thanks , guy, 
  the donger nose would be right between his eyes, 
  this feels like it should 've been in scary movie, 
  what the fuck was that hell raiser army tho ? 
  late april fools ? 
  `` just kidding guys , mania rematches tonight '', 
  i want to cry in front of vince and yell `` fuck you '' at him, 
  i want to cry in front of vince and yell `` fuck you '' at him, 
  deciding wins with coin tosses would 've been better, 
  i missed a chance to say `` put a noose around my neck '' . 
  i plan on living forever actually . 
  it 's just that wrestlemania was fucking garbage and pissed me off . 
  i thought she was joking, 
  i hope vince gets a fucking stroke , holy shit . 
  save us crossfit jesus . 
  ca n't wait to hear the crowd on raw, 
  that 's really gay , mane, 
  such is life in the wwe, 
  it 'll be hard but you 'll get there vs it 's a long and rocky way down , good fucking luck . 
  well new day came out of a giant cereal box dressed up as saiyans ... 
  and the story is pretty bad too, 
  better than the whole mania, 
  holy smokes, 
  what a hero, 
  the latest raw was good . 
  hope it stays that way, 
  that 's why i think giving paul heyman over to nakamura is a great idea . 
  maybe brock gets rekt , heyman gets a hard on for nakamura and goes to him . 
  i can imagine them developing a game . 
  who can draw in the most elves to a burning tree . 
  this is my first wwe game , but holy shit this game has some bad design choices . 
  crossfit jesus is coming back soon, 
  and excal spilled his milk . 
  the fuck did you just call me ? 
  do n't talk about feet and toes you fucking faggot , eww . 
  [ crossfit jesus is dragged into hell ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6td9btj.gifv ), 
  i still do n't know what death grips is, 
  you 're supposed to be high for this , right ? 
  i do n't shit on any genre but this does n't sound like something you listen to `` normally '' . 
  ah i get it . 
  it 's the similar with me and vildhjarta . 
  i wan na relax and get paranoid about shadows and the elusive flow of time . 
  like ... how do you one up something on such a scale ? 
  this is the only thing we have on the game , right now . 
  if your vocal cords are n't shredded , you 're not doing it correctly : ^ ), 
  i 'm not sure but i do n't think ttg is the dev this time around . 
  looks like a fat guy with long hair and a beard to me . 
  vince does a soul transfer, 
  kind of unrelated but i read that there 's an audible `` snap '' when you break your dick . 
  is that true ? 
  i did the same with da : i. 
  while other people were already talking who they 'll romance . 
  like ... how do you know who you 're gon na bone , the game is n't even out yet ? 
  nene ? 
  welcome to / r/jerktalkdiamond , guy, 
   cow,
