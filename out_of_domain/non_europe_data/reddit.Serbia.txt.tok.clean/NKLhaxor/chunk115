  fuck you , guy . 
  it 's 3:30 am and i 'm super hungry, 
  the enlightened brotherhood rises over the filthy mudmen, 
  leported for being eldritchist, 
  memes are eternal, 
  alderaan shot first , just like that rebel scum solo , so ... 
  why ca n't we have nice things in video games ? 
  and too bad it can actually blue screen your pc . 
  luckily , the sinking city is in development, 
  code geass and death note . 
  i like edgelord bullshit, 
  i played the vn for a bit a while ago * for some reason ( ? ) * . 
  and i watched a few episodes . 
  it did n't hook me . 
  i do n't think it 's bad , i just do n't care . 
  needed more jojo tbh, 
  what 's their problem with hos ? 
  we 've all agreed to not scream at them but it 's just impossible and too fun not to . 
  [ post flair is fucky . 
  i 'm on nightmode so cater to my needs , please ] ( http://i.imgur.com/q2rjasw.png ), 
  [ the human abstract ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwaso1vhgpy ) and [ vildhjarta ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3ib8agrgde ) ? 
  i had some `` fixes '' in the res stylesheet loader . 
  it fixed some stuff but broke other things . 
  i disabled it and it 's not fucky anymore . 
  one of the best memes tbh, 
  i made a comment somewhere where i said i would rather look at rule34 of a girl and a horse than a girl licking another girls butthole . 
  i had that on a french game journalism thing cd . 
  and there were like a hundred other demos and flash games on it . 
  edit : here 's the game actually http://www.dosgamesarchive.com/download/cyberdogs/, 
  cyberdogs, 
  it 's the thing pat mentioned several times . 
  so it 'd be pat + anybody . 
  and there 's coop . 
  and it should probably be like a short quicklook, 
  so the punisher tags on the humvee turrets in american sniper were an actual thing ? 
  sick . 
  you ca n't see him but champ is standing behind you right now, 
  i do n't think we 're seeing the same meme here . 
  maniac . 
  i 've never seen it so i do n't believe you, 
  you did n't win, 
  too much sun in heaven . 
  going with you, 
  they hunt and kill because of their tribal culture . 
  i do n't remember the comic but they have fight clubs on their ships too . 
  it 's all about honor , dominance and all that jazz . 
  i would love gang tags all over the place . 
  `` fingers4ever '', 
  the book could not be real either . 
  have you though about that ? 
  hmm ? 
  i tricked you, 
  / u/user _ history_bot @nklhaxor, 
  what if i told you something about me to bring the points back down into the negative ? 
  you did n't upboat , you lunatic . 
  that is a sacred jtd tradition, 
  swery is taking a break to recover from reactive hypoglycemia . 
  only diamo forgives, 
  i 'm not a nazi but planet hitler would 've been cooler than what we have now . 
  i also have a lot of rare pepes, 
  does this mean that i 'm not a normie in your eyes anymore ? 
  yeah , those motherfuckers . 
  but soon the meme singularity will break their minds and that 'll be over . 
  i 'd really like an aron + james racism combo, 
  loverslab , friendolino . 
  you started this war and plunged skyrim into chaos !, 
  i think it was there to make you feel really cool . 
  then make you fight the nameless king, 
  i loved his bloodborne salt, 
  he was pooping on bloodborne for a while, 
  [ i dunno ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_7vn78zj1c ), 
  [ here every time he mentioned bb .

  [ this one is my favorite ] ( https://twitter.com/plagueofgripes/status/679682559907856384?lang=en ) . 
  ca n't wait for the fuller 's `` the punisher '', 
  ok i got ta get in on this tomorrow, 
  that 's some jojo shit right there, 
  seems pretty obvious to me , brah, 
  \\  mistake, 
  well , i was n't even real back then , so i 'm good . 
  there actually are highlights . 
  [ 2015 charity stream highlights ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=pl5ohtvfausvb5mjjksujivxtms1mv-qxu ), 
  and check out the [ balsamic vinegar beer pong that aleks and james did ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3mtuwc_zag&amp;list=pl5ohtvfausvyzsgci_e4jtxcjtybraohs&amp;index=14 ), 
  abandon all ships is back ? 
  they can still host the videos on youtube . 
  just censor the rough stuff, 
  i wish i could erase that picture from my mind, 
  we come a long way since the fun dip, 
  sounds like some lovecraftian shit . 
  in the dragonborn 's house in whiterun , awake lydia waits in the doorway . 
  i found out about it after i found other 3rd party screenshot apps, 
  such a lust for souls ... 
  whooo ? 
  '' * audible gasp * oh - this guy turned into * wrong info * ! '', 
  lorian 's ugs has the sickest upercut, 
  he 's there to lube you up for namless king, 
  all in on the wall, 
  push chuggaboom for summerslam, 
  [ jared dines ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/th3ycharg3/videos ) does metal parodies . 
  but he does lean towards core a bit more .
