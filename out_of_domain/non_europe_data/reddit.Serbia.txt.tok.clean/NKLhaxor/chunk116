  * shepard ... *, 
  well , that 's your opinion, 
  https://www.captionbot.ai/ it does n't like naughty stuff tho, 
  that 's lewd, 
  how dare you insult my legs you corn-nigger, 
  i meant it in a * `` not all black people are niggers and not all homosexuals are faggots '' * way . 
  i could 've said corn-fucker but it 's not the same power level . 
  `` oh man this guy was probably a cool badass ! '', 
  * looks at pants *, 
  `` oh ... he was actually a huge coward '', 
  if it has a preddie in it it 's a good fucking movie to me . 
  i 'm giggling like a little babby, 
  i think the music will make up for it tho . 
  i did n't play ds1 either and got super hyped . 
  i 've never been excited for a strategy game . 
  stellaris makes me salivate . 
  there 's [ 13 pages ] ( http://www.shutterstock.com/g/volodymyr+baleha/sets/1379708-old-women ? ), 
  of her on shutterstock, 
  radical larry is some fucking top kek shit . 
  any interaction is good interaction , in my opinion . 
  well ... technically, 
  well , you smell, 
  i was n't motivated to watch the streams . 
  i 'll do it for the memes, 
  no source ? 
  i guess i 'll science this shit . 
  hold my breath , i 'll report back, 
  ## do n't, 
  there 's nothing cooler than a huge guy using a toothpick as a weapon . 
  i do n't get lovecraft 's thing with cats and black people . 
  that part in dream quest with the moon cats was weird . 
  stats do n't mean much if you do n't git gud, 
  great salty progenitor , some men call ` im ...

  i really wish the other game that we do n't talk about never happened . 
  ** 10 feet higher **, 
  `` first you get the votes , then you get elected . 
  and then you build the wall '', 
  played it on a 9500 gt a few years ago . 
  i 've seen it hovering over stars too, 
  [ the balloon !, 
  got ta get the balloon !, 
  ] ( https://www.twitch.tv/superbestfriendsplay/v/60994298?t=3h3m53s ), 
  this is the coolest, 
  i do n't really know what 's in their previous games but it really feels bare bones in stellaris imo, 
  i got a disintegrator . 
  i tested it and i slapped people 's shit with it . 
  i love it, 
  it looks like a spore creature . 
  probably takes ages for other empires to receive transmissions too . 
  can the ai use traits from mods ? 
  is dawn of war a good entry into the wh40k super cool bullshit ? 
  i knew the cock-a-roaches were up to something !, 
  it 's bugging me that there 's no way to bark orders at them . 
  at least we can still insult them, 
  i really want to build liquid terminators with it, 
  i want to be able to transform my planet into that techno hell from the game . 
  it 's super good . 
  almost as good as space rangers hd soundtrack . 
  you guys should probably try that game, 
  got that too . 
  he died a year later . 
  skellteons are cool tho, 
  woolie used the borutogan too much . 
  he did see all those items but he got tricked by those `` guys '' on the roof, 
  \\  not replacing her with best waifus, 
  i think putting armies on unruly planets helps . 
  [ it 's the hypest shit !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp1pghae8is ), 
  i never knew how much i wanted to hear his vocals on something like this . 
  here 's another totally not the same [ thing ] ( http://imgur.com/13b8pxk ), 
  for you, 
  the scrolling itself is awful too . 
  feels like the scroll bar is scrolling through mayonnaise, 
  should n't you start as quarians and then rename yourself later ? 
   old , deep , fuckers, 
  those words should n't be mixed, 
  of courshe !, 
  crashing this valley ... with not survivors !, 
  * a wild giant crocodile rat dog appears *, 
  sometimes eating fries with mayo at the pc desk is a not great idea, 
  i took people 's advice and built a corvette swarm . 
  they are still butthurd and are insulting me even tho i vassalised them . 
  also , you 'd think that there 'd be a kerfuffle about an empire wide brain chip implementation . 
  with a deathstar, 
  [ here 's some great space game music while you wait ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj0hdjxtnx0 ), 
  i wish 1c would let them make sr3 ... 
  do you have a timestamp ? 
  i do n't have the time to watch the whole thing but i need the memes, 
  bad to the bone, 
  get this hot head outta here, 
  the darkest timeline, 
  a skeleton president would be so cool, 
  i honestly expected the burning plushy to land inside the house, 
  i just watched the movie . 
  it 's 2am . 
  fuck me sideways, 
  yeah dude , but did you see how much muscle mass was in the first one , tho ?
