  \\  not pressing the renegade prompt at the last moment and pouring it on james ' crotch anyway, 
  they should just make citadel dlcs forever . 
  ho boy , f\u00fcnschwitz sounds like a fun place, 
  you had fucking 5 years, 
  because fuck dogs . 
  every dog i 've met when i was a wee lad attacked me .

  but wild eyes was super good so it gets a pass for being kinda generic, 
  days since last woolie murder : 0000, 
  underground russian cyber-zombie super ai baby ? 
  you tried so hard to banepost but in the end it did n't even matter . 
  makes me sad that he did n't participate smh tbh, 
  playing tall with the ringworld mod on a super ringworld is so cool . 
  you have like 12 perfect habitable sections, 
  did it do weird shit with sectors ? 
  mine did the same thing it does with fleets that ca n't decide where to go . 
  it just redoes sectors and keeps adding and removing sectors forever, 
  there 's a similar video on youtube where a guy puts an invisible grenade in another dude 's pants . 
  they all went flying at the same time moments later,

  bad crops = cancerino, 
  [ it 's still real to me , dammit !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvtnykigxii ),

  `` hmm ...

  edit : mr snip snip to the rescue, 
  where did he say this ? 
  i have n't seen some stick action in years, 
  a `` woolie hole '' ? 
  hmm ... 
  i wonder how that would work in theory . 
  if he can bend the space time between fandoms he could appear virtually anywhere . 
  frightening,

  it should help if your cpu is n't great, 
  that pirate porn movie was pretty good, 
  `` i was gasping for air !,

  any idea where i can find more icebergs ? 
  that means they can go even further now, 
  internet is a fuck, 
  remember me had attacks that regenerated health and their version of `` rage mode '' or whatever it was called . 
  if that 's what they 're going for they could do a lot of neat stuff, 
  please show a little respect for the dead . 
  the term is `` vape escape '',

  i love the harsh hardstyle vibe, 
  row row row your boat gently down the stream, 
  there 's a 12 segment one . 
  you started draining the lifeforce of the universe itself, 
  i love crossfit jesus . 
  his return at extreme rules was great . 
  his arms were huge, 
  be careful tho ... you 'll soon start wishing for the next ~ ~ thall ~ ~ album, 
  edit : just remembered that they did [ this ] ( https://soundcloud.com/ryanbergstrom1998/just-for-fun ) .

  and they posted `` thall '' on their facebook page like 10 days ago i think . 
  only fags link the fire, 
  tayai said nothing wrong, 
  memeocracy should be a government type .
