  i hope pele comes back with another story . 
  also , me andromeda and vampyr . 
  [ already done actually ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmo2dhh9-aq ), 
  this is just pornhub tho . 
  there 's stuff here on leddit and the many chans, 
  shoulda put woolie on the turlet in the background, 
  pat is actually behind the table, 
  save him from the dungeon . 
  the way you get to him is super bullshit tho, 
  even bro team pill censors the word . 
  maybe youtube does n't like it, 
  / r/accidjental, 
  looks like meat 's back on the menu , boys !, 
  my 750ti was like 170 euros . 
  holy smokes why was i born here ? 
  `` jeez , you got a big pussy !, 
  * jeez , you got a big pussy !, 
  big as house, 
  do n't listen to them . 
  he did nothing wrong, 
  [ counterweight ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-btyi1cxrg ) is one of my favorite starts to an album . 
  it just blasts you all over the face with hype, 
  the competition is rough, 
  for you, 
  damn . 
  video games * are * serious business, 
  a pepe on / r/funhaus ?!, 
  this must be the work of an enemy stando !, 
  kojipro is actually a pachinko company, 
  \\  worst, 
  all elves are equally bad . 
  just deny everything and he 'll leave you alone, 
  i just finished tw3 blood and wine . 
  gim me some more of dem vamps baby, 
  can you share your madness with us ? 
  yeah ... 
  stick them polygons down your urethra, 
  i 'm not even reading the words and i hate it, 
  that 's a big tree, 
  and the boss fight is some fucking weapon lord shit !, 
  as i call it `` the dante '', 
  a witcher spinoff about vampires would be sick . 
  thermite ca n't bite steel bemes, 
  just touch everything then . 
  i love these occasional news about the butthurt movie industry, 
  sounds like an ... ambient electro porno grind band . 
  you should watch it . 
  mads kills it as hannibal . 
  and the end of season 3 made a lot of people cry, 
  perfect form, 
  and the peenis, 
  neither actually . 
  too much rule34 of a shitty character from a vidya, 
  coulda happened to anyone, 
  damn bbws ruining video games, 
  he could be bamboozling us ... hmmm, 
  i hope they never fix that, 
  dyes straight up do not work for me, 
  `` shitty '' actually means dank/good, 
  at least we got that cool 11/11/11 release date tho . 
  right ? 
  maybe even start releasing them annually !, 
  does it work for you ? 
  because it does not work for me, 
  i 've been looking for one forever . 
  i think i 'm gon na give up and let my eyes melt . 
  i already have f.lux and other kinds of adjustments . 
  nothing will make the white less jarring . 
  no but i have sensitive eyes . 
  it 's not pain just annoyance . 
  i have dark themes for every site i use because it looks better imo and is easier on the eyes . 
  just a thing for those who do n't know : both mts albums and the demo are part of one story . 
  bassically : the lord of woe ( the guy on neverbloom cover ) is going crazy because morrow ( his lady ) left him . 
  in old souls the lord of woe possessed that soldier from the music video and is destroying his life and driving him insane . 
  the album should be listened in reverse order as well because that 's the chronological order . 
  yeah , my view on mts changed after i learned about this . 
  one of my favorite bands now . 
  poise is turned on and working as intended , ya fuck, 
  and the sale memes . 
  el edito : meant `` stale '' but whatever, 
  i have this image in my head of 2 mushroom people shooting fart gas at each other, 
  now i wan na make sentient cyber zombies just to pacify them again, 
  my endoskeleton 's jimmies are getting rattled . 
  this means war , filthy exoskeltels, 
  i thought i unsubscribed from / r/skyrimdadjokes, 
  science demands to know the name of the artist, 
  [ ** savage ** ] ( https://youtu.be/iorls_rkclw?t=5s ), 
  it 's like a mix of [ celldweller ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6csamjz.jpg ) and [ chris motionless ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3ksrvlx.jpg ), 
  he 'll be trapped in the izanami till he admits that he loves naruto, 
  they use their fingers . 
  you need agile fingers to cast signs, 
  has any of the `` look at this cool ue3/4 remake by one guy '' come out ? 
  a bitch, 
  tony stark was able to build this in a cave !, 
  ... with a box of scraps !, 
  i wonder what their civilization used to look like, 
  skeleton parasites ... that 's some fucking spooky shit, 
  did n't mean that kind of bitch, 
  what 's better : to watch free vids on vessel or on the site ? 
  i get boners from skels because i have skelephilia too,
