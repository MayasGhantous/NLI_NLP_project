  i still wonder [ why ] ( / s `` is n't nina dead '' ), 
  every time i look at archer i see vergil from devil may cry 3, 
  [ this ? 
  ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/article9603983.ece/alternates/w460/newblack.jpg ) it 's like a thing scientists created , fabric so black the eye ca n't see it . 
  you mean like that short nerdy trigger happy guy from highschool of the dead who kills zombies with guns like they 're nothing ? 
  i 'll take it . 
  that and everything else . 
  so , what do you do when you 're not working ? 
  chilling , parties , hobby ? 
  and arkham, 
  [ this ? 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/hiqiwbex-ew?t=2m14s ), 
  people wan na powerbomb my comment cuz i like dragon age 2 more than origins ... 
  woolie 's predator sigh , mostly heard in the ds2 vids, 
  pat still uses boss ? 
  what a scrub . 
  loot is the future . 
  eww , vince looks like he 's made out of wax . 
  poor shipwreck , i 'm gon na miss him . 
  #shipwreck 2k14neverforget, 
  look at aleks ' 15yo facial hair , so manly, 
  the borders are pretty big . 
  they take a bit too much screen space . 
  wtf is this ?!, 
  i ca n't watch this !, 
  fuck you , unsubbed . 
  yea , that 'd be even better . 
  is that food ? 
  well , if it bleeds ... * yea * , it will most likely kill you first . 
  so , what do you guys suggest we call ubisoft ? 
  ubishit sounds great . 
  just dump it into the news dump, 
  that shirt combo tho, 
  the orgy thing ... hmm actually kinda interesting . 
  put one camera in the center and look at whoever you want . 
  king of explosions , robert bay !, 
  does phil even like games anymore ? 
  eeeeh ... it 's ok , 6/9, 
  i thought aleks from the creatures had a hard time growing facial hair, 
  i do n't know what i love more , predator or this song . 
  guys !, 
  someone please make a sam l jackson inquisitor !, 
  i though that was a modded game in the picture ... 
  i used to play the ingame music . 
  but i got bored . 
  then i installed the fantasy music mod , it was pretty good . 
  tried the radio mod , did n't work , scrapped it . 
  now i play with my own music , monstercat and metalcore . 
  do any of you guys know how to do that ? 
  it 's really fun doing the clicking sound . 
  you 're never late fo ' the skeleton war !, 
  well , i think it depends . 
  in a bioware game i want the story 1st , gameplay and graphics and the other stuff after . 
  but in a bethesda game , gameplay . 
  that looks perfect !, 
  robbaz is a litch . . lich ... litererol ... * literal * yenius, 
  and hanging out with the team . 
  fuck the reapers , give me more citadel dlc, 
  yeah , bioware really needs to focus on crew interaction more . 
  i think that mass effect needs briefing before missions , and the briefing ( ? ), 
  after missions . 
  perfect chance to discuss different plans , priorities and dealing assignments to the crew members that are n't going with you on the ground , like scouting or even sending them to do another objective . 
  there is ** so ** much they could do . 
  ahh ... one day there will be a * t * in there . 
  i thought that the whole office saw aot , you got ta get on that train guys . 
  light from death note . 
  he could write the most ridiculous cause of death cuz it 's the mk universe . 
  people here think anime is the same as kid 's cartoons . 
  so you never say anything about it . 
  / r/mildlyinfuriating ? 
  maybe you can use tfc in the console , it should n't rotate with it activated . 
  i was super not prepared for that scene . 
  u lie to us , every1 knows turtels cant fart, 
  he 's a ghost . 
  i miss the akatsuki ... 
  uhh , i clean everything , except for ie . 
  better vampires , because the mod author said that it 's supposed to be dirty . 
  good luck . 
  like the ones from the movie ? 
  mine come with the dvd case , they were made out of cardboard ... 
  why are you so fucking rich ? 
  please be better than naruto uns !, 
  ok i just found out about this . 
  who is cheese-kun ? 
  more than feet ... 
  it 's vince mcmahon , you 'll see ... 
  `` wtf was ... '' ? 
  what ... the ... 
  ** shit ** ?!, 
  well , rip in peace stalker , rip in peace . 
  in strategy games the ai sometimes cheats , because they cant manage their resources . 
  tes skyrim and get mods . 
  dats one pimpin ' controller right there !, 
  so it is like skyrim with guns after all !, 
  i knew kovic was right . 
  the forest ? 
  it 's early acces , bit it seems to be coming along nicely with the updates . 
  you can make shelters , cabins , tree houses and set stakes with heads in front of them . 
  pretty cool . 
  well that kinda makes sense , but not actually ...
