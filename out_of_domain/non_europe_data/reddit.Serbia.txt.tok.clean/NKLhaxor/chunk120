  do you know what i like more than materialistic things ? 
  cartilage, 
  for you, 
  did they at least look better than in engine stuff ? 
  if not , than that 's the worst, 
  same here . 
  messed around a bit with observer mode but had no idea * what * to do or * how * to do stuff . 
  [ scotland forever !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cipu4dnkbum&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player ), 
  wow , you 're a special kind of fag , are n't ya ? 
  getting hype for nothing is bad for you , friend . 
  that 's why we need some super expensive technologies like death stars , star forges and stuff . 
  should be permanent at the bottom imo, 
  `` but muh balance ! '', 
  give me stupid crazy shit, 
  i alt f4 'd out of a game because i could n't keep up with 410 billion mosquito fleets that the ai and his butt buddies threw at me . 
  my one fleet could destroy all of them no problem but they were just buzzing around my space ports destroying stuff and taking war score . 
  fuck the war score system, 
  i do n't like the art style either but the gameplay is fun for a bit and smashing shit into shit is even more fun . 
  like seriously ... how does a giant platypus turn into a black lady ? 
  diplomacy is garbo . 
  player : `` ok , guy ... 
  i 'll give you like 5k of my stuff '', 
  alright , alright keep talkin ' '', 
  player : `` and you give me - '', 
  i tried . 
  but they still had more numbers . 
  they only went to war with me because i 'm ugly and racist . 
  `` i got blood on my dick cuz i fucked a corpse '', 
  i audibly laughed . 
  holy smokes that was great, 
  [ when your bro wants to fite you ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rfs0a2i.png ), 
  did you just laf at my skel bro ? 
  that will be my signature from now on, 
  ~ rawr :3, 
  ok now that someone else did it i can see that it 's pretty retarded, 
  all for revenge ... 
  why are you like this , toast ? 
  holy smokes , time to reinstall . 
  the original controls were not good . 
  that 's it . 
  no more goblin marmalade for your toast, 
  they should get a ringer, 
  to be honest that could be throthgar , son of bothvar , descendant of eggar , brother - in-law of ignar , second cousin of falkmar . 
  a child could rob him . 
  i 'm using the fight for the universe mod by the way . 
  the resource modules that you put on your space ports , like navigators ' guild and composite armor facility . 
  do they give those bonuses to ships empire wide or just to the ones built at that space port ? 
  also , can you make the robots `` grow '' faster ? 
  well i guess that makes sense . 
  it would be too op otherwise, 
  retract those edges , friendo, 
  i thought that cthulhu was the hypest . 
  after reading some lovecraft tho ... how about a chaotic god that 's more vegetable than animal and is surrounded by nightmarish music ? 
  why are the days and months in reverse ? 
  i ** refuse ** to believe, 
  0s3seksy updated ... you know what that means ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  james is so rich they probably do n't even need to worry about diseases . 
  a lot of lovecraftian games coming . 
  i hope they 're all gon na be good, 
  i hope dmc5 is actually real this time http://i.imgur.com/nadxyxc.png, 
  from was pussyfooting too long, 
  my job here is done, 
  you do n't understand !, 
  i ** need ** to hate fat and black people ! '', 
  cs rin ru is a decent source . 
  ugh , i could 've posted it as devil maymay cry . 
  good job , ya fucked it, 
  the eve icon is sitting on my desktop waiting to be clicked . 
  if there 's one creature that needs to be exterminated it 's drowners . 
  why not a threesome ? 
  such a lust for memes ... 
  whoooo ? 
  i 'm not even halfway through the story but the idea of basically indiana jones in an alien dream world gets me hyped for nothing . 
  someone should make a game where you are the cultist . 
  like ... `` yeah , let 's invite cthulhu and start his murder orgy '', 
  it 's actually a gimmick fight and eventually you kill him by dropping steel beams on his head . 
  instead of burning and burying you would have to study crazy stuff and take care of nosy people . 
  i 'm kind of disappointed now actually . 
  `` cool '', 
  shame it 'll probably never happen . 
  that 's 2 niches . 
  `` evil '' protagonists and lovecraft . 
  altered . 
  the whole damn movie is tense from start to finish . 
  some guys find an alien and shit gets spooky, 
  i 've seem a lot of j ??? 
  number-number guys . 
  is this some cult ? 
  cool kids say tbh or tbqh fam, 
  / r/illegaltorrents got sniped , so be careful with links, 
  god dammit, 
  wrong : do not pursue lube bu, 
  ghost sex, 
  just like real sadness ... it never stops, 
  literally r1 spam, 
  when i was a wee lad i thought that the key could open any door in that city . 
  let 's take over a house in soltitude and say we 're skeever exterminators . 
  are you 410 billion years old ? 
  is that supposed to be a dank meme ?
