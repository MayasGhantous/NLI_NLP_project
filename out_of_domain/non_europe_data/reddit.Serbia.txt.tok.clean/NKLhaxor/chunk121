  every actor has a thing that they do, 
  you forgot about devil may cry . 
  capcom better not forget about it too at e3, 
  their synths definitely need some new melodies and `` color '', 
  was he * actually * staggered ? 
  he turned into goo and mist and reapeared like nothing happened . 
  he 's a god , not a monster like wilbur whateley, 
  yes it was a good game but it was n't a good dmc game . 
  it felt like fanfiction honestly . 
  nobody wanted a * new * new dmc . 
  [ todd howard - sweet little lies from the album `` it just works '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvgxcisaar4 ), 
  that 'd be cool, 
  crysis . 
  but it 's really light on story, 
  fight for the universe adds a whole bunch of new buildings that use these resources . 
  there are light versions that you can build anywhere and it will give you a small bonus i.e. 
  +5 % shields . 
  and then there are advanced versions that you put on tiles with rare resources . 
  they give you bigger bonuses . 
  i never used those resources before the mod . 
  yeah some of them are stupid strong . 
  i just wish i had use for them in the vanilla game, 
  you 're using the predator flag . 
  immersion broken, 
  ok ... was it * that bad * ? 
  i remember it being a decent game . 
  all of it . 
  i think if they went full arkham with counters instead of dodging it would 've been better honestly . 
  the remix sequences were the coolest part . 
  * a big wet bionic nose falls out *, 
  dan southworth has been teasing too . 
  come on , capcom, 
  just draw cool masks and give them boobs, 
  this looks dank . 
  saved . 
  should i play dmc2 ? 
  i played 3 and 4 and i 'm planning on doing 1 on pcsx . 
  but i heard about the demon tank so i dunno, 
  is the story important at least ? 
  [ you could see his nipples ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pbrdrqb.png ), 
  go to cs rin ru and look for the hoi4 mod topic . 
  they have an up to date mega folder with mods . 
  same for stellaris, 
  man ... 
  i really do n't care about prey or prey . 
  i just want the 2011 bounty hunter demo, 
  [ sister !, 
  what would guts do ? 
  he would play through the pain, 
  you feel it too , do n't you ? 
  410,757,630,337 horny teenagers dead, 
  i 'm not sure but i think there 's also single player in this one . 
  just one thing , fenz ... 
  this is n't about the past ... we 're fighting for the future, 
  the balloon . 
  got ta get the balloon . 
  cane guy is the fucking hypest , i love him, 
  the combat kind of looked really janky and not great at all . 
  fuck , i hope it was n't that insanity wolf meme, 
  is that why the ais often have the little lightning bolt trait that says they `` sacrificed '' their legacy ? 
  they got rid of all the super good buildings and built hydroponics farms ? 
  aww shit , my dude !, 
  this is what i came here for !, 
  time to start cracking this story . 
  also ... could izanami be morrow ? 
  [ the jester/arkham ] ( http://villains.wikia.com/wiki/arkham ) in devil may cry 3 , kinda . 
  as arkham he helps vergil to get to the demonic tower . 
  and as jester he messes around with lady and dante while nudging them towards vergil . 
  reuben and dan have been teasing already . 
  i 'd like a real thing from capcom , please, 
  vita died again . 
  how ironic, 
  no , david is the norman fetus, 
  you can hear dante 's voice in the slashes, 
  go pax because it hurt my soul and overwatch because i do n't care about overwatch . 
  other videos are 10/10, 
  ca n't wait for his murder orgy !, 
  0s3ksy just got a sweet ui too . 
  perfect time to get back into skyrim !, 
  do it acutally and give the dongs their own hitboxes, 
  would you rather have another half baked game like sfv ? 
  akuma dodged a bullet there, 
  is that why norman reedus has a norman fetus in his new game ? 
  running in a serpentine pattern, 
  i think you mixed them up but i also found noticed this along the way : kojiki as `` male-who-invites '' or izanagi-no-mikoto ( `` lord izanagi '' ) . 
  it 's probably nothing , tho . 
  you will find no gentiles here , friend !, 
  got ta whip them , guy . 
  that 'd be cool . 
  even better if they stayed the hell away from the quests and story . 
  have obsidian or harebrained schemes write the stuff . 
  check out [ becoming the archetype ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-wpwhzpmmi ), 
  meme monetization, 
  can you add film grain , some dust on the lense and black bars ? 
  not cinematic enough, 
  please do . 
  they 're too pretty , they 're burning my eyes, 
  imagine bethesda physics in the real world . 
  you try to grab the mouse but it spins out of control and breaks your eye socket . 
  that 's kind of stupid,
