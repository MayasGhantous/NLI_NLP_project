  sick, 
  i hope your mum finds your xd 'd clothes and takes your tendos away, 
  it feels like it should be a feature . 
  maybe tie it to the clothing too ? 
  that 'd be cool, 
  yes !, 
  the summons worked !, 
  i 'll have you tagged as `` lord of woeologist '' . 
  thanks for taking this stuff apart , guy . 
  i hope the rest of the album is this year because this is awesome . 
  i like licking those little balls, 
  i piss before i shower, 
  i do it too . 
  and then i use that skin to scratch my lips . 
  i like the vidya music video . 
  that was the crysis nanosuit and a brute from mass effect . 
  needed a bit more frankie tbh, 
  only if we get tech to throw around galaxies in big dumb robots . 
  i wanted to wait for the special edition , but i just might get it because of project mlg . 
  ... and because 0s3ksy has an ui now, 
  bound by flame ? 
  you start on a mountain , set up traps , fight some zomboids , go into the mountain , fight a big thing and get flame powers and a demon inside you . 
  these xenos have no honor, 
  and they also want to introduce a trust system . 
  so that way you do n't get influence because you have a magical building . 
  * roar * what in oblivion is ** that ** ? 
  more open world means more angles for testicle shots, 
  skse required ? 
  i dunno , i do n't want your hacks in my game , guy ... 
  * ba-dum-tish * is that the sound of the explosion and the irradiated skeleton sizzling ? 
  / r/illegaltorrents got sniped, 
  halfway through through i forgot about the goal of the thread and started getting angry, 
  i always hated that baby zomboid on the cover, 
  i could watch all of the super good movies like predator , commando , rambo , robocop when i was a kid . 
  even movies with boobies . 
  and i played gta san andreas a lot . 
  i do n't like the name . 
  instead of thinking about dragon scales i think about size . 
  the name basically means `` ca n't go bigger than this '' to me, 
  there are no hyperlanes to the center or a star that you can warp to . 
  the game is perfect and balanced . 
  if you start now you 'll be more familiar with how stuff works when the special edition drops, 
  anything that 's not whiterun and soltitude . 
  there 's that place up north and the place down there . 
  i went to the first one a few times . 
  i went down there once . 
  i even talked to the jarl once . 
  i would love a minigame where you smash the boat like in street fighter, 
  that 's an awesome fucking coat tho , what 's his problem, 
  not gon na lie , if i were made out of money i would buy it just because i could . 
  i 've been thinking about a [ letho ] ( https://youtu.be/yj_ktvvvoly?t=58s ) ( from the witcher ) playthrough . 
  you go around skyrim killing jarls, 
  but fuck that guy ... ** i ** want to solve it !, 
  i want a rape horse mount . 
  i 'm not a dev and i 'm just using logic here : you could change the date to a later number and generate new civilizations, 
  that reminds me ... robert and funhaus have n't done their sims collab in a while, 
  my dade could beat up obam, 
  the locator is pointing to somewhere in the south pacific !, 
  best dade, 
  git outta hyper hamster humps, 
  no , no ... year of the woolie, 
  and here i am , a science bitch that stays in my home system that everyone hates for some reason . 
  [ space rangers ost is fucking fantastic ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=allv5_6xbem ) . 
  i think you can get the whole thing from gog, 
  i got excited and looked it up . 
  thought it would be cool shit , but nope it 's just anime anime . 
  google dream and their fucking dogs ... 
  still cool tho, 
  can you imagine 2020 , 2100 ? 
  every day we 're closer to the meme singularity, 
  ok ... what is this game about ? 
  i feel like i do n't wan na know but i need to know . 
  or americki, 
  why is n't he wearing sock ? 
  i want a lot of new dmcs . 
  never be game over, 
  do you mean this ? 
  [ `` i wan na watch you suck his dick '' ] ( https://youtu.be/lw0kraxxelq?t=9s ) . 
  his vocals are great , i ca n't wait for a new album, 
  food and `` cute '' little cat girls . 
  everything i hate in a game . 
  nuclear missiles are among the first weapons you get to research too !, 
   they do n't hate the people of the empires they are ** liberating ** . 
  most people told me that they do n't like how aggressive it sounds . 
  emotion and aggression is what i like about it . 
  well ... time to purge the untrve, 
  what if they 're still twitching ? 
  do i whack 'em some more ? 
  there might be razor blades in those gifts , so i do n't trust you, 
   playable griffith is confirmed ... unsure as how to feel of this . 
  why ? 
  because of a tiny sword ? 
  other musou games did it just fine iirc . 
  he also did nothing wrong . 
  ai640 is pretty angry and chaotic, 
  oh shit , my dood, 
  for some of us socks and sandals is the only way we know . 
  maybe you should n't show animu to your parents . 
  not everyone can stare into the abyss . 
   do not and do not even try .
