  that 's cool but why do they have to leave stains on the wall ? 
  this guy has some simple cool shit, 
  now to seal the woolie hole while we still have a chance, 
  born to kill, 
  doughnut is a fuck, 
  assassinate them all 2016, 
  i am hitman, 
  410,757,630,337 dead clowns, 
  wanted to share these too if you want to look at them . 
  it 's from vildhjarta 's thousands of evils ep album art . 
  i really like the purple color in these ones, 
  so ... all those stars in the x formation have a ringworld ? 
  if you want a shit ton of traits you can do it with the console . 
  add_trait_species speciesname trait_extremely_thrifty for example . 
  the fftu traits are all in / common/traits/00 _ species_traits . txt for me, 
  you got ta cream them, 
  foot fetish is autism spelled backwards, 
  \\  not jerking it to murder and boobies,

  i feel like a fucking idiot for playing 3  1  2  3,

  if they ca n't do 60 then the 30 we get should at least be stable, 
  the `` good for her '' mod, 
  what the fuck is this ? 
  who upvotes this ? 
  i 've seen people with their jaws blown off but pokey holes give me conniptions, 
  when a leader gains a bad trait you used to say `` good for her/him '' . 
  paradox ruined it and now it says `` unfortunate '' or something, 
  there is but i do n't know the actual name . 
  the image is just white mspaint words on a black background saying `` good for her '' i think . 
  at least the companies got those extra sales . 
  oh wait , it 's not how it works, 
  you got ta rend that shit off with a nife, 
   but it kinda costs a shitload . 
  why always this ? 
  hey , you never know when you might need an lpt on body disposal, 
  the scroll thing closing pisses me off so much . 
  and it 's so fucking slow when you roll the mouse wheel, 
  you might like dir en grey, 
  not cool bro ... that 's * my * thing , so ... 
  i wish i could find a stellaris soulmate that loves all the `` atrocities '' i commit . 
  bro team pill will be one of the first live dumpers i bet . 
  he actually streamed his bathroom on periscope while sitting on the turlet recently . 
  and one of his subscriber notifications is him pretending to shit . 
  `` ughghgh shit , there 's a big one coming through ...

  get your gender fluid outta here , and do n't spill it on the carpet . 
  i 've never played it . 
  or any other arpg except for d2 years ago . 
  grim dawn is fun but i usually play it while listening podcasts and streams, 
  you ca n't just regurgitate a meme like that , mate, 
  / r/games is kind of like / v / . 
  we do n't like anything here, 
  liam 's animu vidya ( sorry , senpai ) and overwatch .

  or skip hard work and get to step 4 right away . 
  how rude, 
  [ clearly ] ( https://youtu.be/dsv9vh6lghc?t=16m52s ), 
  masstaden is one of my favorite albums and i used to poop on thousands of evils too .

  i believe in kamiya . 
  he will block me to valhalla, 
  i know what you mean . 
  i wan na sit in my fortified system and unleash plagues . 
  not the same guy , but you could try the kill_country command . 
  i think the player empire is 0 so try kill_country 1,

  officer autoradke showed you the ticked and all . 
  case closed , mwm is an elitist . 
  i think you 're corrupt . 
  maniac . 
  i ca n't shitpost when i 'm dead, 
  most of it is trash , so not really . 
  just jojo and berserk . 
  he 's not even wrong, 
  it 's just on time, 
  joel ( ex funhaus ) would be a perfect dm,
