  i do n't get it . 
  they have some cool songs but to me they sound like genericore + djent . 
  listened to everything but i just do n't see the appeal, 
  check out [ she must burn ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3ymamsllny ) if you like mts, 
  this could be just be `` that song '' . 
  but i like it , and i can hear what they 're doing . 
  it 's a lot happier than what they did before ( lyrics and sound ) . 
  it could all go downhill ( lyrics and sound , again . 
  i do n't mean quality ) on the album if this is another true lord of woe story . 
  they all ended in tragedy so far . 
  nah , there are plenty of idiots in the world ... hand soap in the eyes hurts so much, 
  f \\* ck the rules . 
  and f \\* ck you too , guy, 
  imagine a thief with a daedric key that would n't shut up . 
  imagine someone screaming `` i honor my lord by destroying you ! '', 
  while you 're sleeping, 
  i refuse to believe that this is not real . 
  do n't you wan na see the upvotes/lols first ? 
  there are people that only listen dubstep for the bass drop, 
  remember that time when he turned into a dick ? 
  that 's why i have voice chat turned off . 
  i do n't wan na hear other people 's face holes, 
  pretty good , but i saw some juicier wraifus, 
  damn . 
  did n't work, 
  direct your thanks and donations to / r/enlightenedbirdmen mudboi . 
  so would this work for the normal lanky house spider ? 
  problem is , i ca n't find them when i want them . 
  they always rappel down while i 'm doing something . 
  dick : fingers are op , pls nerf, 
  who made this ? 
  there 's nothing better than biting people in df and watching them barf, 
  that did n't take long at all, 
  we do n't like new people here / s, 
  i played a lot of gorgon , goliaths and some elder kraken so it 's kind of unusual for me to fly around all the time . 
  but since i foolishly wasted 6k on squidboi before getting him through the daily sign in i guess i 'll have to git gud, 
  i do it in 2nd person sometimes . 
  `` wow , you idiot . 
  maybe you should n't have done that '' . 
  mostly it 's just '' * fffffuckin ' * shit '' and `` suck my ass , god dammit '', 
  opposite for me . 
  ca n't be a good guy because it feels weird . 
  betraying my companions in games is the best . 
  it 's like ... damn i really like you guys but the demon will give me powers !, 
  the 2 shadowruns are one of my favorite games now . 
  you mean you do n't like stuff like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rk4sj8z.png ) ? 
  wow maybe you 're a weirdo that likes [ this kind of stuff ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dcdqihg.jpg ) , eh ? 
  i really like the browning but the vocalist is so boring after a while, 
  just throwing my yay vote onto the pile . 
  the way you described yandere-kun 's playstyle feels much different atmospherically speaking and would be a great addition imo . 
  [ we need vin diesel 's `` mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm '' too ] ( https://youtu.be/g55prafpo_q?t=1m1s ) . 
  and maybe some other languages . 
  can we have a modlist ? 
  we ( i ) wo n't judge, 
  it 's even weirder to find out about it when you * are * a slav and you do squat like that . 
  my girls have horns , 2 dicks and 2 rows of boobies so it 's fine . 
  ( yes i turned skyrim into a creepy sex thing because there 's nothing else to do in it ) . 
  i 'm not sure about this but if you 're using mo go to the data tab on the right , go to meshes  actors  werewolfbeast . 
  it should tell you what 's up, 
  those pants are * pretty * tite, 
  yeah , it 's weird how it feels natural, 
  what are you even doing here then ? 
  check out [ the guest ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2980592/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ) . 
  the guy is kind of a sociopath and the soundtrack is great . 
  yeah , me too . 
  that 's why american psycho is one of my favorites . 
  if you want to get into weirder movies try uwe boll 's rampage and the sequel ( it 's actually really decent , unlike his other movies ) . 
  oh , and maniac . 
  it 's weird seeing elijah wood as the killer to me . 
  edit : mr. brooks is another good one, 
  yeah , what am i supposed to with 26 keys ? 
  there 's no bubble gum i can buy in evolve, 
  at first i loved it . 
  `` haha i bet they 're super scared right now , look at my huge 9 winstreak dick '' * a moment later * '' ... guys ? 
  hello darkness my old friend '', 
  5 hunnies ?!, 
  what were you thinking trs ? 
  ok , leddit pro tip : saying hahaha , lol , lmao etc. 
  will often get you downvoted . 
  so just do n't ever say anything . 
  just upvote , it 's basically what it 's for, 
  there 's guilt ? 
  what does n't ? 
  that always fucks me up when anima comes up . 
  i expect the girl scream and bam bam bam, 
  his vocals are insane . 
  goes from super deep brutal to pterodactyl highs, 
  i heard this recently [ terrorbyte ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz_eyqyocy8 ) . 
  it started out really promising . 
  lyrics are n't great and it 'd be better without cleans, 
  you might like [ celldweller ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obspxpqlfl4 ) . 
  he always releases instrumental tracks too . 
  there 's a lot of stuff , djent , screams , riffage , catchy lyrics, 
  that 's a shit waifu tbh . 
  i dunno who that is but it 's still shit, 
  he 's going to remake combat animations ? 
  holy smokes . 
  it only took 5 years but i 'm glad it 's happening . 
  his 2 older albums are grittier if you like that . 
  [ eon ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qlvxovesf4 ) and [ switchback ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spif3fx-rjy ) are one of his best best songs even tho he hates switchback .
