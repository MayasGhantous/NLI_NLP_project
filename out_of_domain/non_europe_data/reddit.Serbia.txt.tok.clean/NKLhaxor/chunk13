  except for far cry ... it 's still like skyrim with - * gets bagged and dragged away into a van *, 
  this is * probably * accurate . 
  this is worse than the super best friends super on-time top ten of 2013 ( it 's still not out yet ), 
  after i watched basic instinct , i thought you had to go up and down on someone and push their chest or something . 
  i 've seen predator 100 + times and i still fucking ** love ** it !, 
  the effects hold up today and it was made when arnie was a beast of a man , also predator is my favorite alien . 
  i learned my lesson . 
  does anyone remember that japanese hair thing that you sprinkle on your head if you 're bald ? 
  me neither ... 
  time to set up the dovahcharity guild . 
  the mass effect 's reapers made more sense than this guy, 
  notice me spacey-senpai !, 
  embrace the dark side !, 
  aside from the story it was really fun . 
  ** that first one shaved off a year or 2 . 
  so many problems would be solved if the new sims games had 3rd person mode , and jumping . 
  ripotato, 
  i really love the * shut the fuck up jordan/katpiss/etc *, 
  haters gon na hate , ** owww **, 
  looks like reptile from mortal kombat, 
  thank you for taking time do do this ama . 
  so , what are n't you getting about attila ? 
  thanks again !, 
  my nose hurts now . 
  i 'd play that . 
  i wish i could mod the game ... 
  it 's just screaming like a madman . 
  i practice destruction magic on every critter i see . 
  instructions unclear , schlong stuck in crossbow, 
  i harvest their bones and they mysteriously explode into dust . 
  luxurious assholes . 
  imagine naruto without filler and flashbacks, 
  i like total ~ ~ biscuit 's ~ ~ bisquid 's `` wtf is '' and angry joe 's reviews . 
  then i look at a few other written reviews , maybe some gameplay vids or giant bomb 's quick look and then i decide if i want the game . 
  the youtube comment section is an absolute shitfuck . 
  staying away ... 
  guys what happened at the end of cl , i forgot ? 
  i hate the fancy sword swish killmove . 
  when i spawned my character in front of me she said that too . 
  she had the default dragonborn gear ( the horned helmet and hide armor stuff ), 
  dafuq is that thing at 12 ? 
  first time i 've seen it , played dg a bunch of times . 
  i like this . 
  i want more of this shit . 
  i agree with matt about the predator stuff , we need more predator shit . 
  i 'm one of those demons that likes dragon age 2 more than origins . 
  i ca n't wait for this , since i ca n't get inquisition . 
  looks glorious , i 'd make it my desktop, 
  we still have those huge box monitors and huge keyboards , and my teacher did n't even know how to change the resolution . 
  half of the pcs did n't work and someone stole the 512mb ram sticks out of those . 
  man , fuck eastern europe . 
  i do n't have a single favorite , but the ones i spent playing the most are, 
  gta san andreas . 
  it was my first pc game and every morning i would play it for hours . 
  devil may cry 3 . 
  the last 3 levels on dmd difficulty with a busted keyboard ... the struggle was ** very ** real . 
  last blade 2 on the mame emulator . 
  my favorite fighting game . 
  the whole mass effect series . 
  the only game that gave me * feels * . 
  dragon age ... 2 . 
  yes , i 'm a monster . 
  but i really love the player character in it . 
  serious sam . 
  the new game did n't suck like duke nukem forever . 
  dragon age origins . 
  da2 ... you will like it or you will hate it . 
  dragon age inquisition came out recently and people seem to like it , and it 's supposed to be very long . 
  try withcer too . 
  it 's very unique and adult oriented . 
  you can skip the first witcher if you do n't like awkward combat and clunky menus ( you do n't really need to play it to understand what 's going on in the second ) . 
  the third one is also coming next year , it 's gon na be huge . 
  also try other bioware games . 
  and something like diablo came out recently shadows heretic kingdoms soul devourer ( ? ) . 
  i do n't know the order of the words , the title screen is weird . 
  i want to say death note or code geass but ... in angel blade ... that moment with nailkaiser in the church ... the light beam ... that was epic and hilarious . 
  it 's pretty decent . 
  he looks pretty good , gon na test it later, 
  oh god , no . 
  i played tales from the borderlands the other day . 
  i * really * need the 2nd episode . 
  i hope this will be as good . 
  i could have been better . 
  it * should * have been better . 
  but they released it with options lacking and a proper offline mode . 
  eastern europe , man . 
  while people were playing the original halo , i was playing wizard of wor , dig dug and zelda . 
  good times ... 
  rip icarus 2014-2014 . 
  your sacrifice will never be forgotten . 
  * salutes *, 
  i say 359 humans is a small price to pay . 
  i asked my hand `` am i dreaming ? '' . 
  i got too excite and it faded out . 
  i 'll get you next time , dream ... 
  i had sp once . 
  i did n't know about it or anything about ld . 
  did n't see any demons tho . 
  i tried to move but it was followed by loud ringing noises , a few moments later i somehow snapped out of it . 
  and i did n't look up anything about it .
