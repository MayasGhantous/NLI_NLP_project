  put this in the stylesheet loader , i kinda fixed it for myself . 
  the background is still shit so just do n't ever look at it . 
  night mode is fucking terrible almost everywhere i go, 
  i do n't know how to reliably paste code in comments so here 's a picture to look at, 
  that 's a big bear, 
  that would make me unsub even faster, 
  oh god , i remember that, 
  [ using nightmode btw . 
  this always happens to the up and downboats ] ( http://imgur.com/kindxv2 ) . 
  why always this ? 
  electro griffin and quantum caira look like cheap sci fi knock offs tbh, 
  i think that prank is worse than hitler tbh, 
  i 'm not that deep into ` zerk . 
  is it basically playing as lube bu ? 
  i loved creation/destruction and slave to nothing . 
  ca n't wait for this, 
  edit : [ check 'em out , if you do n't know about them . 
  bitter end is sick ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffrf18kh8nk ), 
  are we counting eps ? 
  if not then , vildhjarta . 
  like , holy shit guys , hurry up with some new thall, 
  because the site is literally safe to use, 
  she also hangs out on cs rin ru if that 's any help, 
  this place needs some optimization, 
  / r/games is sometimes ( often ) worse than / v / . 
  they make some weird fucking decisions that boggle my mind . 
  now that i 've gotten the cancer out of the way ... 
  dude . 
  i seriously think this will be one of the best mods for skyrim if it delivers on what you promised . 
  i loved shadow of mordor and i 've always wanted the nemesis system in skyrim . 
  i 've actually seen comments that wanted the same thing . 
  so , how deep will the system be exactly ? 
  the nemesis system was great but after a while it got boring because there was not a lot to do . 
  any features planned that were not in som ? 
  a tank, 
  thanks , me too , friendo, 
  they had problems making user friendly rules that make sense in the past too, 
  how dare * you * , you scumfucker ... 
  i 'm more of a / r/anime _ irl person myself, 
  \\ # 12 looks fucking sick . 
  i ca n't wait for spoder gorgon, 
  how did they make it worse ? 
  their old stuff ran great on my shitty old pc . 
  this new game runs like garbage on my new pc, 
  yea - ... wait a minute . 
  that sounds like every other playthrough, 
  we watched some of his videos in coolhole ( bro team 's cytube channel ) . 
  video 1 was how he met a new girl . 
  video 2 was the breakup . 
  3 was another girl . 
  4 was a breakup again . 
  the thing they had in common : twitch camgirls, 
  ** hmmm ... **, 
  video 5 was a nose update, 
  looks like something i would skip, 
  your hair looks stupid tbh, 
  back in the oven they go, 
  [ supernova ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvnjpwnp7sq ) feels lovely . 
  that looks like a sick album cover, 
  is the art you posted on reddit all you have or is there more ? 
  because this is pretty neat, 
  i 'd love to see azathoth but you do what you do , guy . 
  can the fix be applied through a res snippet for other subreddits ? 
  cuz if it 's just a tiny code change i 'd be great if you could post it . 
  that 's what hotfixes are for , if i 'm not mistaken, 
  is it just for a premade group of friends or will it match you with other people ? 
  i tried him out a few times in training . 
  i would miss him too, 
  as always , nightmode remains poopy and halfassed . 
  but thanks for fixing it on this subreddit , guy . 
  the new griffin looks like he came straight out of spy kids 3d, 
  well then ... 
  i 'm adding a new album to my library, 
  [ mts - ether ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd5nqgle8dy ) gives me some happy vibes . 
  the rest of their songs are all tragic, 
  i have like 10 main bands . 
  and about 90 and growing bands that i listen to on shuffle or when i feel like it . 
  verb the noun ama pls . 
  / u/manwithoutmodem if you were a pornstar what would your name be ? 
  on a more serious note , vildhjarta . 
  they 're super elusive , thall dammit, 
  yeah , we definitely need more * alien * aliens, 
  cthulhu hosts the best parties . 
  non stop fuckin ' and killin ', 
  mac is fucking perfect . 
  and it 's pretty good . 
  so many wraifus, 
  [ here you go ] ( https://boards.4chan.org/vg/thread/150518851 ) . 
  you 'll build up immunity to cancer if you go there, 
  [ how 's this ? 
  edit : fuck i just realised i basically made him dab, 
  have you tried pouncing ( sneak attack ) after a leap smash ? 
  it 's good extra damage . 
  got ta do it quick tho, 
  i always wondered why people wanted to stop cthulhu . 
  then i read call of cthulhu and i was like `` what ?!, 
  why would you ** ever ** want to stop that ? '', 
  do n't ever do anything, 
  shoddy xeno engineering, 
  we all know that meditating motherfuckers are the biggest warmongers out there .
