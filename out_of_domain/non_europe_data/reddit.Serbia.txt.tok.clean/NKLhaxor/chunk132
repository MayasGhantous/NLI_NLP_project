  he does look like naruto ... 
  i knew this would happen . 
  why always this ? 
  ctrl + w to close fab tap or middle click on it, 
  if you 're on win10 open a new desktop and switch to it with ctrl + win + right, 
  it needs to detect ironic kappas . 
  so if you genuinely post a kappa you get banned . 
  yeah . 
  [ just win + tab and click new desktop ] ( http://i.imgur.com/htozjap.png ), 
  i hope the dragonclanger is a cosmetic dlc, 
  i found out about the skeleball wizard on cow chop . 
  that 's a first, 
  the hunter bots are awful from what i 've seen . 
  monster ai scares me tho, 
  delete this , you narg, 
  the most recent one for me was episode 7 with starkiller base . 
  my eyes teared up because it was so awesome . 
   yet, 
  rarbg , rutracker and rin ( they sometimes have links to mega downloads and just good information in general ) . 
  i hope the story is interesting in this one . 
  i wanted to like the original but i could n't even get an hour in . 
  / r/skyrimmods gets a lot of attention . 
  they can , but that does n't mean they should . 
  elegies ? 
  that 's neverbloom 2012 . 
  holy fucking smokes !, 
  yeah , bad omens album in 10 days !, 
  for a moment i was like `` ok ... who 's this chris avellone guy that everyone keeps talking about ? '', 
  i looked him up and oh yeah . 
  he did all those things . 
  i 'm definitely playing os2 now . 
  ingame indicators when someone needs healing/shielding and other hints in general would be nice . 
  i do n't wan na talk or hear other people 's voice holes . 
  let me guess ... someone stole your sweet role, 
  i dunno about you but i can barely keep track of what the fuck is happening in a fight . 
  at least give me a list like in warframe with player names and health on the side . 
  ... i did n't even notice that . 
  thanks , guy . 
  one guy in / r/skyrimmods said that it was faster for him this way . 
  it literally was n't . 
  the fat canadian dolphin cut out a part that i liked . 
  brote is the only dolphin i like . 
  other dolphs are rapist assholes and look scary, 
  ce is still going strong, 
  it 's like playing against a mentally challenged monster . 
  it feels really good when you win . 
  i 'm always down for a bro team pill stream . 
  i 'd watch that fat canadian baby boy any day, 
  [ a person ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hi-uxmseco0 ), 
  * everything around the first boom explodes and sends you ragdolling *, 
  was tomb raider actually cracked ? 
  someone said that denuvo was n't removed just disabled , others say that it 's removed completely . 
  but at the end of the day ... 
  the game runs great and it 's free for us scumbags . 
  from my experience you 're safe with rg mechanics , reventans and catalyst too . 
  i remember when seyter was n't a scumbag, 
  edit : [ fitgirl also mentions them here ] ( http://fitgirl-repacks.com/faq/ ), 
  dynasty warriors 8 empires is probably my favorite . 
  i made my own cool guy to murder thousands in cool ways while listening to podcasts . 
  then i saw that samurai warriors empires was not coming to steam . 
  made me so angry, 
  i already confessed several times openly in other subreddits . 
  i 'm neutral evil i 'll do what i want, 
  try stellaris . 
  i 'm fucking awful at rts and i 'm having a lot of fun . 
  i hope david `` despite all my rage '' cage comes up with something even more ridiculous for the detroit robot game or whatever it 's called . 
  there 's a [ mod for mount and blade ] ( http://www.moddb.com/mods/warsword-conquest ) that adds a rat race . 
  and some spooky skells, 
  [ reminds me of stitches actually ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtw6hw8jo_u ), 
  `` better have my reward when i come to collect !, 
  pay up , pay up , pay up !, 
  * raises swords up and down * i put that sword in yo face '', 
  thank you for reminding me that this exists, 
  that 's it , roach !, 
  thanks , guy, 
  do i get a skin if i do n't do anything ? 
  i do n't wan na play on that map, 
  well , i 'll kill some fuckos then, 
  `` we 've replaced all flairs with a new flair that says `` slave '' . 
  ban policy has been changed to unrestricted '', 
  totalbiscuit is streaming it right now, 
  he is having problems too, 
  i made the header for / r/jerktalkdiamond, 
  fix your game , sean, 
  gog has no drm at all . 
  you still ca n't play online but who cares , in the legit game you probably wo n't ever meet anyone . 
  codex is from the steam release , dunno if they have the steam drm on it but basically there 's no difference if you just wan na download a game and play it . 
  i do n't know about the 9gb one . 
  the game is 2gb, 
  it 's not that different . 
  it 's basically an upgraded version of perception . 
  and that 's completely fine with me , because that album is gud, 
  but it 's cinemati * barf *, 
  playing as a species that 's more toxic than the environment would be fun . 
  like they would smell like gasoline and piss vinegar . 
  how dare you call me an obsolete memer . 
  i bet you do n't even know about / r/jerktalkdiamond , narg, 
  most of the time the matchmaking feels like it 's on `` sheep to the slaughter '' mode, 
  i 'm so glad that i was n't excited at all for this game, 
  and gobbos .
