  i love goblins, 
  this trait would turn planets inhospitable for other species . 
  but i guess they would also be hated for that . 
  i 'd like some satanic black metalcore . 
  imagine behemoth with breakdowns . 
  that 's blasphemy against everything, 
  shit , dode . 
  this is sick, 
  * sips blood from a goblet *, 
  you 're among the lucky ones . 
  i have n't uninstalled a game that fast in a while . 
  that 's some / r/fitdrawngirls material right there, 
  i found this in an / r/anime comment section . 
  do n't know the source, 
  it 's fiiiiine, 
  it 's a nice sub, 
  man ... all those waifus were shit, 
  i was about to say '' [ i dunno ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz-x6exxkv8 ) '' but then the breakdown hit . 
  oli is really fucking into it, 
  / r/lovecraft would like this, 
  i come here for the porn , a bit of fighties and mainly to watch retards yell at each other 's alts, 
  well , obviously . 
  but i could n't think of a title so just look at it, 
  i 'd rather have that than manowar . 
  with a mass effect 3 citadel dlc style portrait . 
  ignore the other guy . 
  and his 70 upvotes . 
  that 's the coolest haircut . 
  i bet they 're not even cool like [ dante from the devil may cry series \u2122 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bgvuhxt.png ), 
  his legs could be useful . 
  maybe in the dick, 
  and on a really long stuffed unicorn, 
  time is convoluted \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) \\ _ / \u00af, 
  the human abstract, 
  how do you even measure heaviness ? 
  do you just tune low till you collapse into a black hole ? 
  anyway , i said tha because they have a lot of lows on digital veil . 
  while nocturne is just screaming and singing , as far as i know . 
  gon na say what some guy on rin said :, 
  fake and gay ( not that there 's anything wrong with being gay ), 
  or press version . 
  we need a fucking megathread to contain it, 
  i 'd rather have a good game than a good date, 
  soon you 'll be desperate for the reunion that they 're teasing but not really . 
  well ... on rin they often have sfv files . 
  they just scan your whole game folder to check if you 're missing files , wrong files , etc. 
  more oc and obscure memage, 
  yeah , i 'm not waiting for some sweet marketing , i 'm waiting for a game , dode . 
  it 's not like beth needs marketing, 
  i read somewhere that you should use other words other than common words . 
  an alternative to accurate was exact . 
  lol what a retard , how does that even work nigga ? 
  `` lol this is so exact '', 
  i agree with you agreeing with me tho, 
  * `` i was n't alarmed at first , because who has n't been hurled into an endless black void ? 
  this is pretty good lol , i read the whole thing, 
  i read somewhere that you should use other words other than common words . 
  an alternative to accurate was exact . 
  lol what a retard , how does that even work nigga ? 
  `` lol this is so exact '', 
  i agree with you agreeing with me agreeing with you agreeing with me you meme tho, 
  ok , you win , you can stop now, 
  ok , motherfucker here 's my desktop from a few days ago . 
   lol that is so accurate, 
  lol that is so exact, 
  did you try it ? 
  it 's worse than the worst monster player that i 've played against . 
  it 's from { jojo no kimyou na bouken : diamond wa kudakenai } ep20 ( is that how the robot works ? 
  i dunno how the fuck it works . 
  you should know by now what the best anime is , narg . ) . 
  did n't include his stando catching him because we suck and do n't have stands . 
  poor wilbur . 
  i was honestly expecting more videos with the lil ' dode . 
  the twitch cop said he 'd make the video spin too . 
  i 'm still waiting for that, 
  paste dade, 
  [ fucking look at this shit ] ( http://imgur.com/a/jo6hn ) detroyat 2008-2013, 
  well , humans are part of nature , so check mate , environs . 
  i wish there was a faster way . 
  in skyrim you can make a text file with the commands you want to run and then in game you run it as a bat file through the console, 
  i lost my shit the first time i heard that . 
  yes but my love for memes overwrites shame, 
  what even the fuck is this shit tier anime ? 
  these 2 artworks are also from vildhjarta 's thousand evils ep, 
  they are also pretty good desktop wallpapers, 
  can you kill a spider trap while it 's in the air ? 
  oh , boy ca n't wait to play this !, 
  ... pffffshhhh ... 
  stupid fun bullshit , serious stuff and ass & tiddies . 
  hearthfire and the mod that came before it basically sealed the deal . 
  i bet there absolutely will be some sort of building, 
  well , i 'm 18 and i like ass and titties . 
  nothing complicated . 
  that 's fucking awful . 
  and here i am in a 3rd world country sitting with 1tb of torrents . 
  not even counting youtube . 
  once, 
  i wish he was my dade, 
  distillery is the worst map for me . 
  worse than cataclysm .
