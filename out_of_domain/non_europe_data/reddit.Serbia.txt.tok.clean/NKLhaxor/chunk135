  coolness  practicality, 
  so , can a legit stellaris player invite a crack user ? 
  it 's on steam greenlight currently, 
  some of us use more than just res . 
  i 'll need all of my extensions before i even consider switching, 
  that costs money tho, 
  it 's not great but i love it . 
  like baneposting, 
  if i started baneposting right now , would you die ? 
  i wish the old vocalist did more cleans . 
  really gave me a the human abstract vibe . 
  pretty much all of them . 
  recent favorites are darkness divided , bad omens and hellions . 
  i meant the devs . 
  they are not making any money from stage 2 right now iirc . 
  i 'm no game doctor but consider what they have to do : models , textures , animations , sounds , abilities , balancing , marketing and probably more stuff . 
  make it do something other than nothing ? 
  i guess the album already is kind of out . 
  * cough *, 
  but the point is ... it gets a 10/10 from me . 
  i think it 's kind of unfair that hunters get such an easy mode against a braindead monster, 
  as if that would 've stopped any artist, 
  as long as this is not their first and last metalcore album they can copy old bmth as much as they want imo . 
  i did n't read many lovecraft stories but from what i 've read it 's only the normal people that go insane . 
  if you 're a jaded cynical bastard it should n't affect you . 
  show it on the environment instead . 
  i did n't mean the literal environment . 
  i meant other npcs and the state of the world and such . 
  how do we know that goliath and wraith are n't fuckin ' already ? 
  i ca n't see anything on distillery , so i just close my eyes and play by ear . 
  i already said that this album is the second coming but damn , dode . 
  that album art is really nice to look at, 
  they recently called it quits . 
  released the chimera ep and this [ single ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb8w1whk3os ) shame, 
  a year ago creatures x funhaus happened . 
  dreams came true . 
  and if cowchop moves to la. . . holy fuck , dude . 
  [ the best song ever made ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcbofvksmka ) . 
  always puts a huge grin on me face, 
  he 's one of those vampire actors , eh ? 
  yeah , you 'll have to explain this one to me http://i.imgur.com/ah7svxz.png, 
  shit . 
  people would make viruses that actually hurt you . 
  imagine having a bitcoin miner in your brain, 
  bro team pill has a good chat . 
  you get banned if you act like you 're in a twich chat . 
  it does make sense , but i dunno , dude ... 
  just like silent planet 's new album , it 's super good, 
  vildhjarta 's thousands of evils, 
  these 2 images are huge, 
  i see only 20 % downbaoted this post . 
  they 'll learn in time, 
  yeah , love for the character ... 
  i have dreams about being a predator . 
  it 'll be fun for a while , but the novelty will wear off . 
  and then aela goes all `` wow !, 
  look at this piece of ass , ca n't even kill a giant , piece of ass ... '', 
  basically ripping heads off of colonial marines in my yard . 
  sometimes i have a grappling hook . 
  the grappling hook idea came from [ just cause 2 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/k2guequ.jpg ) probably . 
  yeah , i wish there were more . 
  i wish there were more vildhjarta albums too . 
  that was pretty good, 
  can we outlaw these key pictures now ? 
  [ ether dynamics ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucp-ne1yeh6yk6jvink87mnq/videos ) is making an ai mod for skyrim based on that . 
  + some general ai improvements, 
  my brain turned off for the title midway through , but it 's aleks , bois . 
  from [ cowchop ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucmybtqily7p8eq9isya3olw/videos ), 
  if you 're not complaining about a good game then get the fuck out , narg . 
  no positivity allowed, 
  i used to watch fist of zen . 
  that was awesome . 
  would love to see them do something like that, 
  anime cryme, 
  shhh ! ... 
  do n't say it outloud . 
  her knights might be watching, 
  i meant something without vidya gaems . 
  something more intimate . 
  a big dick baphomet statue ? 
  i might have to play this, 
  look on the bright side . 
  you get to laugh at lvl40 scrublords, 
  have you played skyrim ? 
  the unofficial patch is still being updated , because bethesda is really good at not fixing their shit . 
  [ counterweight ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-btyi1cxrg ) was my first hsb . 
  it hit me like a ton of bricks, 
  [ you are a deranged cultist too , brother ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zbniqgv.png ), 
  i do n't think skyrim is amazing . 
  and i played enderal and i did n't like it . 
  i wish only obsidian made bethesda games instead of bethesda . 
  but , that 's like my opinion , man . 
  i was waiting for some sort of trap to trigger . 
  it 's just a fucking trampoline, 
  you have shit taste then . 
  shit , dongsnap is still at it, 
  tombstone piledrived my brother . 
  he superkicked me, 
  i think it counts as a new game , but i do n't think you 'll have to buy it if you have the legendary edition . 
  do n't listen to me tho , i might be an idiot,
