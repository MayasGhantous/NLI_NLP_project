  fuck you, 
  good job , retard . 
  imagine 4 r vals, 
  jesus ... how many pounds of pussy and ass is that ? 
  the soul of / r/metalcore, 
  is there a community or a sub specifically for defending edgelord characters ? 
  woolie sees you tho, 
  you got ta hire a badblood to kill defenseless prey, 
  are n't the files encrypted ? 
  vokill wrote a thing ? 
  shit , i might want to check it out . 
  he 's got a monstrous voice, 
  i barely play df . 
  can you bottle that mess for future use ? 
  like putting it in a sandwich ? 
  oh my god, 
  edit : why did he do this ? 
  [ design the fucking skyline ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viszi6ujeuq ), 
  the satanist gets a 10/10 from me . 
  and i too am not really into black . 
  but [ anaal nathrakh ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q23j7tjtgg0 ) has been on repeat for me for a week . 
  it 's a banger , has highs , lows , and good cleans . 
  [ this song is gives me a lot of core vibes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bhejpmfcmi ), 
  just quote lovecraft, 
  do n't ever try to be nice, 
  is aleks ripping a fat vape ? 
  there 's also a new [ album coming ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzghsozw7zk ) . 
  haram was so cool, 
  bad omens came out recently . 
  try that, 
  do n't flood the bathroom with shitwater , you motherfucker . 
  i hope he falls in the toilet and gets stuck . 
  you want some ? 
  i 've never not had boogers, 
  have you ever died in a dream ? 
  how does it compare ? 
  ehh , pepes are not so hot anymore . 
  i 'd recommend obscure memes like the ones at / r/jerktalkdiamond, 
  disclaimer : i am not affiliated with jtd, 
  damn , dude . 
  damn , dude, 
  automod is a hot grill . 
  i want to lick her, 
  like a diamo buttplunger ? 
  y' all need some track suits . 
  i can barely squat in jeans, 
  i wan na dp automod with him . 
  telling people to stop memeing is like yelling at a tornado . 
  then there 's one guy who posts dozens of tiny gifs, 
  edit : and then there 's that guy that starts arguing about whether people are gay or not if they like chicks with dicks . 
  why always this ? 
  genocide is still a really good multi-tool in many games . 
  never disappoints, 
  we still ca n't colonize mars ingame . 
  there is another game coming out . 
  the sinking city . 
  i hope they do n't fuck it, 
  his longest , in fact, 
  i too have a big chinchong, 
  i wanted to reply `` me too thanks '' but apparently the [ old ones ] ( http://www.yog-sothoth.com/wiki/index.php/r'lyehian ) do n't have a word for thanks and too . 
  sequester my life blood and excogitate the design of the apex configuration . 
  initiate the phantasmal terminus of the absolute, 
  everything is real in jtd . 
  you just have to believe, 
  we control the meme scene from behind the scenes . 
  nobody knows tho . 
  upvotes are mandatory . 
  nice throbbing thinger . 
  i think i 'm done for now . 
  when i play monster the hunters are braindead . 
  when i play hunter ( if i get the hunter role ) my teammates are brain dead . 
  why always this ? 
  next album : when ? 
  ranked is going away so do n't even bother anymore, 
  if you want animu try taiga . 
  it 's an app that updates your mal and gets torrents, 
  can i torrent it ? 
  have n't been raped once and i 've been real for 18 years on this planet, 
  [ this is what 's going on with the prison-murder girl ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gb571re_a ), 
  \\  they, 
  it 's one guy . 
  wow , learn the lore, 
  there 's a skyrim ai mod based on that . 
  it 's not done yet , it 's still skyrim , i ca n't remember the name at 4am but it 's more than nothing at all . 
  the guy who is making it is called eather dynamics , so check that out, 
  honestly the only thing keeping me away from fo is the world . 
  the athmosphere and theme i just do not get . 
  memechines , son !, 
  yeah , let me sit in a tavern in a bath robe while smoking a pipe . 
  hey , guitar guy , you know that song about me ? 
  hit it !, 
  that 's pretty good . 
  did n't know we were still posting here, 
  ca n't wait to press it, 
  i mean , it 's not impossible ... 
  you should play them . 
  i used to underestimate the power of indie games . 
  [ reigns ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/474750/ ) is one of my favorite games of 2016 right now . 
  non stop action and murder is what i usually prefer but i love indies that are n't shitties . 
  would this be considered as a case of radioactive stockholm syndrome ?
