  the teaser is super good, 
  tyrone is a gentle leader, 
  we 'll need an updated version for andromeda . 
  imagine the variety of crew cuts we 'll get !, 
  you can create some nice grills even in mass effect 1 but it 's really hard . 
  why did they do this ? 
  does imgur remove private images ( you can view it only if you share the link ) ? 
  [ darkness divided ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=notsosrwjhs ) is p good . 
  edit : i never saw this video . 
  those are some neat effects, 
  i 'm not that into fuckin ' games but it 's literally porn + games . 
  nothing complicated, 
  behind the fluffy beard is an oriental killing machine, 
  very clever toast, 
  at least they 're cool and on the good side, 
  speaking of lewd subs : [ here 's a thing ( sfw data image ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7lmrnnc.png ), 
  yeah , weird . 
  i found about them recently , and a lot of people would like them if they knew about them . 
  i 'm in love with [ darke complex ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ehthuuk4oo ) . 
  i love the cleans . 
  some real good sadboicore . 
  any other bands like these doods ? 
  [ are these supposed to look good ? 
  are you implying that bruce is * racist * ?? 
  man , pixiv is filled with untapped porn, 
  revert it , nargs, 
  if the nargs at reddit do n't wan na revert , i want a res fix for these hideous thumbnails, 
  if i ever commit suicide it will be because crows are eating my guts or it will be for comedic effect . 
  rip . 
  they called it quits recently, 
  i get that people have to shill but they should at least be subtle , holy shit, 
  hey ... that 's pretty good !, 
  landmine is a nice song, 
  so is this as dissimulator or jared ? 
  ok , unrelated but i got ta solve this mystery . 
  what happened here ? 
  so you were n't kidnapped by some shadowy organization ... well , case closed, 
  whenever i feel like this i remember that shark week applies only to girls and i 'm thankful for that . 
  whatever killed all the players back in alpha . 
  it was a really different game . 
  bring back the dinosaur race !, 
  you can check on cs rin ru . 
  they might have mirrors to direct downloads . 
  there will be a lot tho, 
  * shoves pillow into face *, 
  `` excuse all the blood '', 
  that look uncomfortable, 
  smeg, 
  i honestly think they should ditch layouts . 
  damn , dude . 
  he 's going even deeper with the vocals this time . 
  i 'd like them to at least get some new sounds and diversify their electronic palette . 
  and maybe 2 screamers . 
  i like my dick pristine, 
  18 but dead on the inside/dink/internet, 
  intrusive thoughts are just standard routine for me . 
  planing murders is fun, 
  this is my first norma jean album . 
  ho boy it 's really nice, 
  do n't you fucking dare be right about this, 
  h o l o g r a m, 
  i do n't care this is my cyclops canon, 
  let 's hope that this is `` that song '' . 
  he 'd actually just scream racist shit, 
  it 's just on res as far as i know, 
  \\  ever doing anything, 
  i just shitpost and hope the next asteroid hits, 
  nice try !, 
  i only like 18 year old girls with short hair and abs, 
  for a second i thought she had a hairy tail, 
  is it me or did sean have a different haircut for every video ? 
  / r/fitdrawngirls is my second home, 
  there 's something i love about people who make good stuff but turn out to be raging racists . 
  i recently read a lot of lovecraft and ho boy ... 
  i was n't prepared for `` nigger man '' the cat, 
  that actually seems like a thing that could be real . 
  they have some norse names . 
  that titan that talked said `` yggdrasil '' ( i think , do n't really remember ) and that girl is called ymir , so, 
  [ i killed the prom queen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6g9as-nevk ) ? 
  edit : [ she must burn ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3ymamsllny ) too, 
  racism does n't affect me , i actually find it funny . 
  i love his stuff, 
  edit : '' i actually find it funny . '', 
  that sounds kinda fucked up, 
  / r/all likes nice gifs . 
  source : i look at all a bit, 
  ok , that 's kinda weird . 
  why do that , unless it 's actually important ? 
  i appreciate ordinary memes but i would prefer ironic memes, 
  her not ealking is not what 's interesting to me . 
  it 's that little steel nugget that fell out of her, 
  i feel like make them suffer also got lighter but ether still feels like a mts song . 
  pretty easy once you get used to the controls actually . 
  but this is adam so ... 
  and a little steel nugget fell out of her pants too, 
  yeah but not as well as some guys in the crazy combo videos where they switch styles after almost every attack with dante . 
  but that 's just me being lazy . 
  i beat dmc3 on every difficulty on a keyboard a few years ago . 
  i only beat dmc4 once because nero feels really slow to me and does n't have much going for him imo . 
  and dante is the opposite , there 's so much .
