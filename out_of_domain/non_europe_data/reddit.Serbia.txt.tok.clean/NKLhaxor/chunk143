  there 's also a blind dude that plays mkx, 
  they * were * pretty cool tbh, 
  check out their memoirs album too . 
  they feel connected to me . 
  it 's about the protagonist and his alter ego the deranger finding a hidden city . 
  while they struggle existing with each other and existence itself . 
  edit : [ check out this thread i made a while ago . 
  has more recommendations in there ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/metalcore/comments/51fegj/what_are_your_favorite_albums_with_a_story_and/ ), 
  i meant their uniforms . 
  really elegant, 
  is that the / r/4chan faggot ? 
  tbh he deserves more, 
  i miss todd, 
  technically not metalcore but kinda relevant since they released a new album recently . 
  [ king 810 - killem all ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjdagmvznto ), 
  not mathcore but it has the vocals . 
  how about [ ghenghis tron ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqgu6yubjoc ), 
  vildhjarta disappeared into a black hole for a while and out of nowhere they [ released this a week ago ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-fbgqqdqg4 ), 
  dude ... you got ta kiss him and bring him in here , yeah let 's get some boys in here, 
  will this series ever be fully watchable to us who have no money ? 
  ignore the big pause in the corner , this for sure is totally legal , officer . 
  reddit comment memes are the worst fucking thing, 
  yeah , weird . 
  i 've been here for 2 years and it 's already pissing up my ass, 
  attack again right after your sword connects . 
  not when it hits , do it just a bit after . 
  do n't drag it out too long, 
  / r/thrive is a thing you might want to keep an eye on . 
  oh yeah , i posted [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/wqbibzz ) to [ / r/corejerk ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/corejerk/comments/3yc0e0/wage_what/ ) once , still makes me giggle . 
  basically just generic stuff i do n't like . 
  and phinehas - coup d'etat . 
  that song ... it makes me angry , i ca n't stand it . 
  rest of the album is 10/10, 
  edit : you know what ? ... 
  [ actually , i do n't really like this either ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1lnvfko.gifv ), 
  i 'd be fine if it was just some twanging on one guitar , but just a hum really fucks on me . 
  to me it does n't like anything like the rest of the album but that 's not the only thing . 
  just the song itself , i really do n't like it but i do n't know the reason . 
  accidentally did , but i actually like that album, 
  she did eat the heard first . 
  but that could 've been aleks ' sweet talking, 
  not better than widow but i still like it . 
  this and vendetta are the best . 
  the part where he starts talking about the universe gave me geesebumps, 
  [ until the light takes us ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hffb3qxvhre ) is about black metal . 
  and yes , that crazy motherfucker varg is in there too . 
  if you 're gon na use memes do n't use those shit tier memes . 
  harvest 4chan and reddit memes, 
  except that mudmen stayed in the mud and threw at us sharp sticks !, 
  kaaaa now they fly in metal buckets, 
  i think he meant the hidden enb, 
  jesus ... that was awesome, 
  have they even seen their own community ? 
  [ darkness divided ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=notsosrwjhs ), 
  [ hellions ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6snbftrqsqo ),

  [ to speak of wolves ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqxweozltz8 ), 
  discovered these recently , all kinda small . 
  here 's some stuff * you * might like . 
  i think it 's prog but i 'm not % 100 sure what prog is tbh :, 
  [ the human abstract ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwaso1vhgpy ), 
  [ vildhjarta ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3ib8agrgde ),

  [ humanity 's last breath ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpaiylk3hti ), 
  holy ... fuck . 
  i 'm not gay either but i felt some blood redirect itself to my dink after seeing those abs, 
  i do n't really care about seasons . 
  i just want it to not be sunny and not be cold . 
  jojo currently . 
  but ttgl and code geass hold a special place in my cold heart . 
  made me feel things . 
  ok , so who thinks that predator is the best movie ever made ? 
  seen death note ? 
  it 's like that but a bit more anime-ish . 
  the main character is basically neutral evil ( it 's evil vs evil for the greater good ) if you like those kinds of protags and he does the evil laugh a bunch . 
  there are a lot of mind games , manipulations and mechs . 
  mechs are not the focus tho , just a thing that happens to be in the plot . 
  lelouch was voted as best guy on / r/anime in 2015 so it 's got that going for it too . 
  and do n't let the fanservice stuff put you off . 
  i 'm barely remember the pizza hut stuff and the occasional boobies because i was so into lelouch being a cool guy, 
  what 's wrong with using it to make memes ? 
  when you think about it , a lot of the good names have been snagged up . 
  ever thought of a cool name and you look it up and it 's some nothing death metal band from the 90s ? 
  honestly , i have no idea . 
  i did post it at around 3am , so there 's that . 
  but my point was that it does n't really matter if this is real or not . 
  to me at least . 
  the effect is real/seems real to me and that 's what matters, 
  seems like a jew scheme to stop me from farming rarer pepes, 
  maybe a last online thing for friends . 
  same . 
  imagine if hitler made the best metalcore . 
  i 'd for sure bang my head to it . 
  my gifs do n't even work correctly . 
  i have to move the screen up and down for the gif to fuckin ' move at all . 
  they fucked it, 
  are they doing something about it ? 
  i do n't wan na install their updates if they 're so fucking unstable,
