  bringing up brokencyde will never not be fun, 
  iphones are for girls you fag,

  [ vildhjarta - traces ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nffsi_ptp7y ), 
  [ falling in reverse - alone ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcbofvksmka ), 
  i am not fucking kidding , the song is a masterpiece, 
  i * think * [ alesana ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dofsv0lxtq ) does this . 
  but their voices are similar to me so i 'm not sure . 
  [ amaranthe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdyexxpd3pg ) has a guy and a girl singing + another screamer . 
  it 's alright . 
  it 's them , not you . 
  your post was good , famo . 
  i actually saw look who 's back recently and yeah , hilter was pretty cool !, 
  i like the part in the beginning where he flails his arm and nothing happens, 
  her name . 
  you 're not even the same guy , guy . 
  is that list not getting updated anymore ? 
  silent planet and make them suffer are missing , that 's just from the top of my head, 
  that 's literally what the movie is about , doid . 
  it 's pretty gud, 
  every time i see that i get a hankering for murder, 
  well scheisse , now i 'm gon na watch that nazi frodo movie and some other nazi movies . 
  i think we should remain calm and collected and do what we do best !, 
  p u r g e, 
  why are you typing like that other doctor retard ? 
  no , we 're just not lil ' sniping bitches, 
  i got ta reinstall this . 
  the platforming was so awful . 
  i wan na kill demons non stop with this blasting not hop around . 
  djent is n't really a genre . 
  think of metalcore as a steak and djent as a spice or something . 
  to me it 's one of the best looking games i 've played . 
  and i played it on medium-low, 
  i mean it depends . 
  it could be progressive metal with djent . 
  by definition it 's not metalcore . 
  it could also be progressive metalcore with djent . 
  but at the end of the day , who fuckin ' cares if it sounds good to you . 
  so this was planned but people did n't like it being locked to ethoses and we got nothing ? 
  you seem like an old man to me . 
  i do n't know how you lived through those awful memes . 
  they were n't even dank, 
  do n't you mean nene ? 
  did you see how * tight * those thigh highs were ? 
  that 'd be cool . 
  maybe if yandere dev goes through with the [ yandere kun ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/yandere_simulator/comments/4t6tab/since_weve_got_a_thread_for_female_senpai_lets/d5f5y3a ) idea eventually . 
  that was pretty good , but kinda too soft for me . 
  was expecting something more hardcore with that name, 
  i 'd actually like to play just metal in general to the long dead classical musicians . 
  i wonder what they would think of the vocals, 
  i love it . 
  came for the fighties , stayed for the ass , dicks and retards yelling at each other 's alt accounts, 
  i 'm gon na use this as a quote from now on , doude . 
  yeah the outro is %, 
  put your grasses on , griffisu did nothing wrong, 
  hey , that 's pretty good, 
  i hate kids but i love watching dads display their powers, 
  the new predator is coming out in 2018 . 
  i could die by then, 
  now that 's a spicy shirt !, 
  did you semefy it yet ? 
  i hope this gets fixed because i do n't wan na see this anymore, 
  i doubt he achieved zen through obscenity, 
  it 's actually probably true . 
  there are people who like to put worms up in there . 
  they have a metal thing that spreads the dinkhole and you can see the worms inside it . 
  i miss her, 
  what i usually ca n't find on extra i find it on rarbg , so try that . 
  drama . 
  pretty fucking retarded if you ask me , do n't even bother looking up what happened . 
  others would still like to hear it even if it 's just garbage, 
  it 's been so long . 
  is that old ig pillar ? 
  i ca n't remember what it looks like anymore, 
  yeah , you can . 
  just add max paragon points and a million renegades ( you do n't actually need that much , keep adding till you get max scarring ) . 
  now you can be a cool guy with blue and red dialogue . 
  i 'm a week late but this is some great stuff, 
  i just want to start drooling uncontrollably and shake the computer desk while killing demons . 
  do you know which podcast this was ? 
  i usually skip the overwatch section because i do n't care at all , but i wan na laugh, 
  well ... technically black metal , but it has some of the core elements . 
  [ anaal ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q23j7tjtgg0 ) [ nathrakh ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzjvzio05nk ) . 
  cleans vocals , high screams , deep fried screams , chugs , breakdowns . 
  i only like this album , still waiting for the whole of law on the 28th, 
  well , piss up my fucking ass , i 'm gon na go and be sad now, 
  i 'm gon na copy my [ post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/metalcore/comments/51fegj/what_are_your_favorite_albums_with_a_story_and/ ) from like a month ago,
