  [ make them suffer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n31nc496j_a ) . 
  all of their music is part of one story . 
  even the happy sounding ether they recently put out . 
  the story is about the lord of woe , he 's basically a. . . ghost guy who just wanted to be happy with his lady morrow . 
  she left and he had a breakdown ( hah ) , burned down the forest and moved on to haunt the guy from old souls . 
  [ vildhjarta - m\u00e5sstaden ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3ib8agrgde ) is kind of a dark fairy tale of a hidden town and our main characters ( the protagonist and the deranger ) . 
  i recommend looking at [ this ] ( http://got-djent.com/review/what-thall-meaning-behind-m%c3%a5sstaden ) . 
  the devil wears prada [ zombie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcl4jjnucoo ) and [ space ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvnjpwnp7sq ) . 
  pretty self-explanatory, 
  [ becoming the archetype - i am ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0ooxnk697g ) . 
  and god said : `` look how fucking cool i am '', 
  yeah , i love how everything is fucked here , but nobody cares, 
  there might be more slavs here than black people on / r/blackpeopletwitter, 
  i forgot how fucking good that site is, 
  you mean the cool side ? 
  i wonder if the next album is gon na be lighter . 
  i 'm not complaining tho , it 's still got the mts feel, 
  and surprising absolutely nobody , one of the bonus songs is the first to go . 
  my bets are : chasing rainbows and then deathbeds next, 
  i like deathbeds too but it 's not the same level as the other songs for me . 
  also , it 's a bonus song and those 3 do n't really sound like the rest of the album imo .

  edit : [ make them suffer - timeless ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mm2sis75cw ), 
  what even is real life at this point ? 
  i 'm more of a chicks w / dicks guy but i 'm not complaining either, 
  some pirate rapackers make languages parts optional . 
  pretty lame that devs do n't do the same, 
  [ this is what it looks like for me . 
  night mode is fucking garbage most of the time when subreddit styles are enabled ] ( http://imgur.com/9innpta ), 
  i know . 
  problem is i want it to look nice , but it does n't . 
  so i have it disabled, 
  i 'd do nothing if i was immortal too . 
  what 's the rush ? 
  tbh , i 'm not doing anything right now because life will be over in about 90 years so who cares, 
  [ this could help ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/6491/ ? ), 
  probably , but not as gay as sucking guy dick, 
  i heard this on cum town and i did n't think it was real , but it 's really real , doude, 
  i once spent a week catching up to naruto . 
  hundreds of episodes . 
  i 'm not sure if it was worth it, 
  been listening to a lot of [ stories ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phzlftdmqmk ) and [ the human abstract ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38r3mskdyfa ), 
  every time i got forced to play anything with a ball i got hit in the face, 
  he 'd slaughter the entire population of maddentown for the mangekyo borutogan, 
  pat  `` friend to all children : he may act like he hates them , but pat will usually pick choices that benefit children . 
  he admitted to saving duck in his run through of the walking dead , treats sarah kindly , adores clementine , and in the last of us , he actually starts to appreciates ellie and gets angry at the idea of her dying in order to cure humanity . 
  he displays a ton of papa wolf tendencies even if he does n't want to admit it . 
  ** exposed **, 
  i 'm guilty of providing recommendations outside of the official thread . 
  maybe it should flash really fast so people notice it, 
  2 vocalists that sound different ? 
  can be like vildhjarta with 2 screamers or 1 screamboi and 1 singer like blessthefall . 
  i want there to be a nice balance between them, 
  some of us attract balls for some fucking reason . 
  i remember one time , when i was really far away from the field where the other kids were playing football ( real football , not your american weird thing you call football ) . 
  while i was thinking about something , out of nowhere i got winded by a ball . 
  it 's like a curse, 
  check this [ thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/crackwatch/comments/55eef7/best_site_to_download_torrents_from/ ), 
  forgot to mention . 
  i 'd like it to be heavy , i really do n't like them, 
  is this guy fucking with us ? 
  i honestly ca n't tell because this seems stupid enough to be real, 
  my hand did this after it waved at me http://i.imgur.com/obc7igi.gifv, 
  i 've heard better brutal slam vocalists pronounce better than that . 
  come on , guy . 
  i think you can do that with race menu too . 
  yeah , pretty good, 
  i wish i understood how stocks work, 
  same . 
  i was n't really interested but then i found out that cia was the antagonist . . now i 'm actually thirsty for more, 
  engrish , check . 
  death to denuvo , check . 
  aye , it be / r/crackstatus , sir . 
  look at this . 
  look up '' * [ your name ] * the hedgehog '' , you wo n't be - actually you probably will be disappointed that someone with your name did what they did . 
  why ca n't girls be like this ? 
  yeah , what a lil ' bitch, 
  anyone else having the isdone.dll error during installation ? 
  it 's pissing up my fucking ass . 
  i downloaded fresh files and put them into sys32 and wow64 , tried disabling av and firewall , moving the iso file and nothing worked . 
  you 're not a fan of nightmare waifus , i take it ? 
  imagine if everything he said was like this quote from [ mvc3 ] ( https://youtu.be/gqspld3rpuo?t=21s ), 
  i use musicbee for all my podcasts . 
  [ here are my settings if it helps ] ( http://imgur.com/bdqllxr ), 
  i do n't understand how this is still a problem after so many shitstorms . 
  i just wish the mcm had no animations . 
  every time i got ta wait for the menus to get into position all fancy and shit, 
  so when 's this going to youtube ? 
  only if it 's a girl 's bulge tbh, 
  crystal lake - the sign has some really deep growls here and there, 
  sounds pretty gay . 
  i watch really manly movies like predator , terminator and commando . 
  rap is probably stupid , whatever it is . 
  i bet it is n't even cool like that fast talking like in attila . 
  the one for diablo ii where that cyborg in a fetal position is bouncing up and down in that fleshy room is my favorite, 
  i just read about that . 
  * hooooooly * smokes , that was fucked up, 
  your an auto-geneated imgurl, 
  not exactly what you want but check out zarono 's necronomicon, 
  sound of trucks , tractors , and other big dumb vehicles driving by .
