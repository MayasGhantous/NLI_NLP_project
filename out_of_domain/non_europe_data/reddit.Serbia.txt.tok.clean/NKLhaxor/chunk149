  the prethoryn showed up and are sprinkling their borders everywhere too , so that looks nice, 
  i really want the canon dragonborn to be a shitbag tyrant that screws over all 3 factions . 
  the band members in general are really cool . 
  lynden 's hair is so fucking awesome in the void video . 
  that should also apply to synths . 
  if you purge all of your organics and have synth leaders you should be able to be a synth empire . 
  [ i know , right ? 
  i 'd like custom text flairs , so i can put in whatever i want . 
  vokill actually made a [ neat little guide ] ( https://www.vokillacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/the-art-of-screaming-free-sample.pdf ) . 
  this is a free sample but it has a lot of solid stuff imo . 
  and the obligatory check out the zen of screaming by melissa cross . 
  edit : try looking at how other people started screaming , maybe some of those apply to you . 
  holy smokes , that was like at 3am . 
  why did i post that ? 
  ~ ~ tdwp - supernova . 
  best space ep song imo, 
  the human abstract - elgiac . 
  no vocals but one of the best intro songs i 've heard . 
  tells you what the album is gon na be like . ~ ~, 
  ** nevermind **, 
  2:50 to be precise . 
  wait a minute ... 
  did n't notice the sub 2 min thing . 
  was n't this supposed to be fixed now ? 
  rampage 3 feels like it 's just uwe jerking himself off . 
  at least the story is finished . 
  and i really liked will 's last line , seemed fitting . 
  fuck right off , cia is god tier . 
  i do n't have any advice for you but i wanted to let you know that the title made me laugh really hard . 
  good luck with your blackface , friend, 
  speaking of politicos , now that i think about it ... arnold did blackface in predator with mud . 
  sjdubs being offended by real shit that soldiers do is so sad and funny at the same time . 
  makes me feel like eating a solid stick of bleach, 
  probably not but i 'd like a bleachocolate bar to be a thing, 
  what 's gon na be the name of the podcast ? 
  i think that restricting weapons and defense to one thing would be nice . 
  just like ftl, 
  imagine if you took cum town . 
  too bad it 's already taken and a good podcast already . 
  even in djent i need to be broken down, 
  the year is 2100 . 
  the media consists off chicks with dicks , ass , ass licking and horsecock . 
  all that fuck you money, 
  that guy has to be some sort of ascended linkin park specter by now, 
  we ** need ** to see the ass too . 
  the girls get dicks and the guys turn into girls . 
  well , fuck . 
  this did n't work . 
  turns out i hate existence, 
  i wonder how many dead people are subbed to jtd, 
  synthwave i think . 
  check out perturbator , megadrive and carpenter brut for more, 
  ca n't lookat the video now but i 'm guessing it 's the shower scene . 
  i think those were just ads for an old game . 
  there 's this tho www.alienlovespredator.com, 
  there 's hundreds of other rules but nobody really cares about those, 
   ka : no one knows what `` eoten '' fucking means . 
  you make fansubs . 
  it 's your job to change japanese into english that people actually understand . 
  you should of spelled it wrong to piss them off, 
  [ set to stun ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d7fs2zq8ya ), 
  your foot, 
  ok , then face, 
  lp is not crash, 
  damn , time flies fast . 
  i forgot n7 was coming up so soon, 
  i 've never listened to los . 
  are they as good a the cumboys ? 
  diamo is not crash, 
  people have seen other weird things like that . 
  like huge growing shadows or a shifting geometrical shape . 
  check out / r/glitch _ in_the_matrix, 
  [ geese ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q81ptfsa4mk ), 
  i think it 's easier than ever to find music now, 
  it 's not as scary as you would think . 
  \\  wanting woolie on controls, 
  blackface is not a joke , it 's serious business, 
  gim me the opposite of hopecore . 
  bands like vildhjarta , darke complex , oathbreaker , make them suffer . 
  these sound nothing alike but are all about ze bad feels, 
  i do that too . 
  made [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0n8qtye.png ) a while ago on / r/cowchop . 
  it was a total shitpost but it made me so proud,

  what does this [ image ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gb6drko.png ) make you feel ? 
  and last question , what does [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jvkbd32.jpg ) image make you feel ? 
  wish i had core friends, 
  we really do n't any original titles around here, 
  edit : i wo n't put `` need '' in there because, 
  i 'm pretty sure i 'm not autistic . 
  put me in a cage with one and i 'll tear out his throte, 
  what happened ? 
  was the secretary angry ? 
  those mods exist . 
  and they are more fleshed out than you 'd think .
