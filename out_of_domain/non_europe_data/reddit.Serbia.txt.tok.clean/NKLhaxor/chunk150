  i ca n't not think of the scary movie scene, 
  `` by ysmir , her body is a mangled mess ! '', 
  `` she ran into my warhammer . 
  she ran into my warhammer ten times . '', 
  ok , i hate feet but this one just looks terrible . 
  look at it !, 
  matt saved this series, 
  just replace scarface with matt in the world is yours, 
  this band sounds like old man noises , do not want . 
  where 's austin ? 
  action rpg is what i 'd describe it, 
  that 'd be a waste of time for them . 
  yo , what the fuck is this , yo ? 
  you ca n't just request a tin snip and not post your own, 
  i was about to say that this is a bit weird but then i remembered that guy who took a picture of a dude 's bare foot on a plane and it 's fine i guess, 
  i wonder what effects it would have on neighboring starts and how that would translate ingame . 
  what if that 's why stellaris chugs so much ? 
  maybe there are trillions of cats being processed in the engine, 
  piss up my fucking ass , why is that so good ? 
  oh , wow we have the same one . 
  i miss huge papa, 
  you might like landon tewers ' [ ai640 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=happcshp9q4 ) ep . 
  it 's a short concept ep so there 's not a lot but it 's interesting, 
  look at the fucking comment profile pics . 
  it 's like a group of people who like trains, 
  one of my favorites . 
  landon said that part 2 was `` almost done '' like in august . 
  i 'm wondering what that meant, 
  there 's a rood dood somewhere in here, 
  obsidian worked on new vegas . 
  bethesda did skyrim , so ... 
  maybe carcer city ? 
  how ** dare ** you even think that . 
  i only downvote shit i do n't like sometimes . 
  and when i wan na be an asshole for no reason . 
  but never on jtd , because this is sacred ground . 
  i was gon na answer neutrally but , it 's really obvious . 
  i dunno if they could n't or did n't want to , but they did n't . 
  obsidian made a better bethesda game than bethesda . 
  i think materialist fes should try to * perfect * ai and not just give up because they rebelled that one time and never again . 
  short hair best hair, 
  depends . 
  i love darke complex . 
  sylar makes me really angry, 
  how do they work ? 
  i guess i 'll just kill myself because i ca n't get past the fucking panda, 
  no source link because i have no idea where this artist dwells, 
  i 'm over it now , found some other stuff to look at . 
  think i 've seen vincent from darke complex somewhere around here too . 
  and someone from oh , sleeper , ca n't remember who tho . 
  i know . 
  but i ca n't stand sylar for some reason, 
  just ask him anything and you 'll get blocked, 
  we empire now bois, 
  [ the voice actor is from england ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1544508/?ref_=tt_cl_t5 ), 
  i dunno if it 's him or if it 's david cage 's masterful design, 
  if only they made a sequel to sims 3, 
  this shitpost took some effort . 
  nice job , guy, 
   negro-black, 
  oh , howard ... even in death, 
  i do n't want the scary imgur people to find me, 
  i 've seen the movie literally over a 100 times and still it gives me goosebumps . 
  he 's living the dream . 
  he gets to act retarded , destroy things and be naked all the time for money . 
  i was n't prepared to be bombarded , holy smokes, 
  that requires effort, 
  what a shitpost, 
  woolie 's morals and ambitions are alien to humans, 
  the boss is still garb, 
  probably [ tdwp - anatomy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcl4jjnucoo ) . 
  chainsaw into guitar , like fucking what, 
  got any * ordinary * metal ( i 'm not looking for any specific genre ) ? 
  really liking gojira so far . 
  i also like behemoth , at the gates , leprous . 
  basically ... 
  i do n't want cookie monster vocals and stuff that 's 30 years old . 
  last time they recommended me that even tho i said that i did n't want it . 
  thanks shreddit, 
  i did but not enough screamies, 
  it 's not for me , still too light, 
  obzen was alright , but the rest is pretty boring to me . 
  just use suicide till you become rich . 
  did you know that a skelenten always smiles ? 
  even now when he 's hiding inside you, 
  i wonder if there 's a guy at google who 's job is to laugh at our searches in realtime, 
  small hands , big guy, 
  i spent most of my time in that alt start cell, 
  how big is that ? 
  cowchop put a child sized dildo through a door already, 
  no , it was an actual door with a big hole in it, 
  tha is already one of my favorites . 
  dillinger i do n't get . 
  really digging black crown tho , so thanks for that, 
  so i 'm assuming hard hitting atmosphericore ?

  another sadboicore band for my collection,
