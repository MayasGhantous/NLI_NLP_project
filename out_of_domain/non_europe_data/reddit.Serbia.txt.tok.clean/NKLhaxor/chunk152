  for a moment i was expecting oceans ate alaska and the clean vocals that make me mad . 
  glad this is another band , this is amazing, 
  me too . 
  i hate naut and things that look like it, 
  no really . 
  there 's 3dm forum textures , textures by some other guy and the default sexlab ones . 
  oh and there 's a wip mesh by funnybizness, 
  i 've seen stranger requests on ll realized , so go ask them, 
  sometimes it feels like there are thousands of shy nuns in this place . 
  just the gameplay in general . 
  i 've always wanted an obsidian rpg with dmc gameplay . 
  i would piss myself, 
  i want to be an immortal cyborg with an off switch . 
  and lots of money, 
  i had a concentration camp in fallout 4 . 
  along what the others said , extratorrent and rutracker . 
  by the end it sounds like something / mu / would listen to, 
  to me [ heartsmear ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-fbgqqdqg4 ) sounds like both albums combined just darker . 
  [ vildhjarta 's ep ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hku3nwa.jpg ) art is super good, 
  to me it 's more like mark as in marking a target or something . 
  the game is full of cool names, 
  discovering a new form of magic would also be cool, 
  the giblets of flesh all over the blade grave suggest otherwise, 
  do they not know what happens when you steal memes from the pack ? 
  [ falling in reverse - alone ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcbofvksmka ), 
  this song is the best thing ever, 
  i do n't get it . 
  what 's with the big pile of salt on the right ? 
  genuine is really big in mongolia apparently, 
  it was n't even funny , it was sad, 
  not officially . 
  there 's snippets of things on their soundclouds and the heartsmear teaser, 
  [ does this count ? ] ( https://youtu.be/maxoulzm_zg?t=4m9s ) ... 
  i mean it 's kinda mexican but not what you want . 
  what do you mean ? 
  you can hover over it and click on the trash can . 
  or go to the subreddit dropdown menu , all subs and unsub from there . 
  wage what ? 
  i keep my all time faves . 
  like predator , which is objectively the best, 
  if we put our minds to it , we can make it happen . 
  come on , everybody !, 
  let 's do some meme magic !, 
  do you think this is some sort of jest ? 
  purifying loli filth is serious business . 
  now you get to steal valor with one guy who has your back, 
   i 'm on that wreck !, 
  fly like a jet !, 
  switching my lanes like i 'm racing a vet, 
  i always imagine radke running around and doing the plane hands thing, 
  vape escape, 
  i was n't ready for such depravity, 
  eternal youth , a thing people often forget about, 
  / r/jerktalkdiamond a bunch of weird french gay people jerking off on diamonds or something i dunno tbh, 
  have you heard of quantum faggotry ? 
  i 'd honestly love star wars : revengeance . 
  i really do n't care about dice and stuff , but i love the role play, 
  * sobs * it 's ... 
  it 's still real to me , dammit !, 
  * cums *, 
  \\  learning, 
  eidt : choose one of the above . 
  thank you . 
  [ template ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hk675ar.png ) for other firendos, 
  huh ... my dad has a real shirt that looks like that, 
  no , it 's fine, 
  i 'm not that gay . 
  i 'm chicks with dicks-gay, 
  why 'd you cumment twice ? 
  is this a meme now ? 
  a meme thief !, 
  will you cut off his hand ? 
  i thought you memefied my comment and used it without giving me credit . 
  that sounds like meme crime, 
  i 'm sorry , officer !, 
  he came on her toes . 
  i 've always wanted to strangle someone who has a foot fetish . 
  maybe i should write about my problems too . 
  do n't, 
  12pm is still morning to me, 
  every time someone mentions dragon 's dogma ... [ i hear this in my head ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=javq26k2v0c ), 
  i wish there was more of this . 
  i do n't wan na fight some dusty jobbers , i wan na be the law, 
  i 've been seeing that a lot lately . 
  people are just forgetting about e in breathe . 
  it 's really rustling my jimmies, 
  it 's more satisfiying than the flacid animations, 
  every time someone posts a song like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/o0ba6yu.png ) , from whatever channel that is , it never works for me, 
  apparently that 's not good for you since online conversations do n't have the elements of a real conversation . 
  like facial movements , body language and subtle things like that . 
  guess i 'll go insane since i have very little in common with other people around where i live . 
  at least i have my meme friends, 
  this is n't really core but some of you might get excited for [ this album ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kopfoejqcke ) by cricle of dust ( who is actually celldweller , who is actually just one guy , klayton ) . 
  you should 've . 
  also you misspelled retard . 
  also the / s spam canceled your combo meter . 
  and just a feminine penis joke would 've been sufficient , because sometimes less is more . 
  that was my comment analysis for today . 
  purrty cool . 
  there was that guy that was really confused .
