  lit is the only word i can use to describe this album, 
  subreddits that do n't have user customizable flairs are doing it wrong . 
  if he did a drink stream he 'd die for real that time . 
  edit : [ for those who do n't know ] ( https://youtu.be/0xc8rdqdtdk?t=25m23s ) he drank from a big glass skull and literally almost died . 
  i 'm pretty sure he drunk from other things than just the skel . 
  the stream was really long, 
  thank fuck lyle showed up . 
  saved his life, 
  are there any bands that sound like the dmc ost ? 
  what 's the gayest thing you 've seen on the job ? 
  god dammit , woolie . 
  you ca n't just change history like that, 
  i hope this is what death stranding will be like . 
  [ traces ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nffsi_ptp7y ) . 
  the part where the only cleans on the album come in . 
  [ psychescape ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7jsv-36m68 ) too, 
  ### ** reeeeeeeeeee **, 
  each to their own . 
  i like them because they 're so monotone . 
  they fit the theme and the story . 
  but if you liked the rest of the song you 'll probably enjoy the whole album , it 's a journey . 
  did you convert the video to an image file under uv light tho ? 
  my not great rgb mouse is the only light i need for christmas, 
  balls = exposed, 
  we sure could use some refreshments after defeating the evil omikron, 
  there are no bad jokes when it comes to racism, 
  do n't compare omikron to griffith , please . 
  phinehas , i am noah , darkness divided, 
  the only reason why they 're not one of my favorites is because of the cleans . 
  imagine if the clean parts were like the screams on the beginning of staria i. 
  east is the worst direction in the world . 
  what were my parents thinking when they put my room here, 
  well , i consider 12pm still early morning , so ... 
  rip . 
  and holy smokes , it 's another trailer with a sad female vocal cover, 
  try bad omens , touche amore , silent planet and the new the plot in you, 
  swearing is serious business , dammit !, 
  the last episode of omikron should be the first episode of detroit . 
  as the credits end and the screen goes black : `` welcome to detroit . '', 
  i want them to reunite with the lost 5th best friend and do a cage-athon on stream, 
  the rc plane mission was easy as fuck what the fuck, 
  there was cock fighting in scarface the world is yours too . 
  me and my brother spent hours in that wrecked ship playing that minigame, 
  you misspelled [ da jokah ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sppwzs3ncwm ) wrong , baybee, 
  well ... 
  i was on the / r/twobestfriendsplay sub and i saw it . 
  then i played some mgsv . 
  i also needed my daily quota of racism and memes, 
  i understand both perfectly , but this is fucking with my brain, 
  they 're also responsible for david cage . 
  it only took one post before i unsubbed from it again, 
  his brand !, 
  dunno about you but i sure would like sweaty girls with abs in mechs, 
  little do they know ... that time is convoluted in omikron . 
  there are trainers and cheat engine tables already , so you can do that . 
  i wonder if you can just have the first 2 words with blank audio files and have the full thing on the 3rd, 
  i wan na go back in time and slap that bottle from both sides , that little bitch ass shitkid . 
  i can already imagine a menacing phantom axe breaking down a door only to stop and choose a different path . 
  nani ?!, 
  * an infinite torrent of unpaid parking tickets start bursting out of pockets *, 
  smash my hands together on the bottle and make him choke on pepsi, 
  my jimmies will only be unrustled once i exact my vengeance, 
  they were probably terrorists anyway , so it 's fine . 
  first destination : into da watah, 
  does it actually make the slow as fuck menus ( mainly skyui 's mcm ) animate faster or is it just smoother frames, 
  sandpit turtle, 
  there is something really similar but i ca n't remember the name of the sub . 
  it 's about not looking at the sky no matter what . 
  there 's like weird black shapes floating up there and there 's an emergency broadcast, 
  edit : / r/thephenomenon, 
  yeah , i noticed . 
  i do n't even know what i 'm doing here . 
  it 's poop like always, 
  the part when the electronic howling started i wanted to scream like arnold in predator, 
  i wish they were more popular than the fucking meme . 
  i still listen to their stuff from time to time, 
  they already had gary busey in the game . 
  just put the real kevin in there and say he 's crazy and gone rogue, 
  the spotlights are on his dick now . 
  we 're just waiting for him to comment, 
  i 've seen some huge dongos on / aco /, 
  fulton extracted straight from the usatbiaz hq, 
  that 's the strongest, 
  did n't celldweller do a bunch of songs for dead rising ? 
  he 's a real guy and you can find all of his music on his channel or all over youtube with vocals, 
  darke complex, 
  only western hentai . 
  this shit is % 100 real, 
  [ was it really ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gb571re_a ), 
  / r/metalcore will sandbag this, 
  a man is noon, 
  even anakin . 
  he became much hotter, 
  how long do you have to be on the turlet because i do n't spend more than 2 minutes there ? 
  i do n't have that kind of hole to stick my fingers into . 
  i just use my will and entire body to get rid of poop . 
  the seraphim thing is weirder than most lovecraft things to me , like what the fuck . 
  that 's super freaky, 
  i hope they 'll stick with the lord of woe story,
