  as a person that 's obsessed with predator i can confirm that it is pretty great . 
  like the symbols or the language ? 
  symbols should be doable since it 's basically a font change . 
  the [ speech ] ( http://avp.wikia.com/wiki/yautja_language ) does n't seem like to be nonsense like r'lyehian but i wonder if there 's enough things needed to construct an actual working language . 
  vildhjarta and humanity 's last breath since you like meshuggah . 
  vildhjarta sounds a lot darker than meshuggah . 
  and hlb is their even darker cousin, 
  limiters : off, 
  one song was n't enough for me to get into them so i listened to the whole album , holy shit it 's so good, 
  how do they deal with it ? 
  i usually try to headbutt or punch mine ( or kiss , like that one time ), 
  i wanted to be the predator when i was a kid , watched it like every day . 
  i also do the clicking sound, 
  those stretch marks ... my whole body compressed itself . 
  smashed faces and guts do nothing for me but this makes me gag, 
  got a link ? 
  i wan na look at it , try it and give up, 
  also , vocalist ca n't even scream properly , only relies on his kvlt looks and photoshop . 
  why is there a cat howling outside , pls kitty it 's 4am fuck off help, 
  normies leave this holy ground, 
  i played that game 3 times and never finished it . 
  this time i 'll push through the gameplay, 
  what do you mean by without leaving the chopper ? 
  mowing everyone down with the gattling gun and not even dropping to the ground ? 
  i 've always had to leave and call it back, 
  yeah , i 'll just use coward tactics and cheat, 
  she must burn is discount mts with one ep , but worth a listen . 
  remember how in arkham knight batman has a giant cannon that fires rubber bullets at street thugs ? 
  and how his batmobile blasts you away with an electric shock ? 
  sure looks lethal, 
  at least one guy that bats chocked out died, 
  #fred durst is an active streamer, 
  i did n't believe you but then i saw a video of it . 
  and it 's so weird seeing a normal human instead of keep rollin ' rollin ', 
  yeah , the world does n't care about you . 
  once i got stuck in a tight attic surrounded by enemies and i was out of ammo and health . 
  i mean you can trash-bash anything without knowing what it even is . 
  d e a d, 
  e e, 
  a a, 
  d e a d, 
  [ \\  dead af ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4rwmcqkola ), 
  ah , so that 's what the threads on 4chan are about . 
  are there any cards that are considered rare ? 
  i love the idea, 
  it adds stuff and maybe fixes some things, 
  same thing in serbia . 
  `` which team ? '', 
  `` i do n't watch soccer . '', 
  `` what do you mean by that ? '', 
  what could i possibly mean ? 
  but then they ask about my father 's fav team and i 'm like, 
  `` i do n't fuckin ' ... red star ? '', 
  `` yeah , alright you 're red star . 
  you 're cool with me . '', 
  ok , friend, 
  nah , nobody will care unless you mention something like burning giant crosses in the fields . 
  get some slum jams going up in this cum hole, 
  back in my day they used to rush at us with bayonets and now they meme at us . 
  i 'm a fan of slashed forearms tbh , heard it 's quite peaceful but messy, 
  ok , now do it, 
  so google can hunt me down in case i move from this location ? 
  the solution is to put your hands into each other 's pockets . 
  got turned into a glowing skeleton during a blowout, 
  more than you 'd think, 
  you might be autistic . 
  fun fact # 1 : female dolphins have better vaggies than girls !, 
  fun fact # 2 : ducks are rapist assholes !, 
  fun fact # 3 : i 'm homicidal !, 
  fun fact # 4 : the father of anime is disappointed !, 
  fun fact # 5 : john cena speaks chingchongese !, 
  at one point they will have to stop sandbagging pat 's dick, 
  i never really found anything like the dmc soundtrack but [ celldweller ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qlvxovesf4 ) would fit dmc i think . 
  also [ circle of dust ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twlflzwlpgo ) ( same person , he 's a one man band and he has 3 of them . 
  he 's also scandroid which is a retro-futuristic cyberpunk synthwave thing ) . 
  he made some soundtracks for dead rising and killer instinct s2, 
  edit : the new korn album would also fit imo, 
  { 1 ; i know , right ? 
  would n't you stick your peener in one ? 
  { 2 ; i know , right ? 
  would n't it be terrifying if a duck stuck its peener inside your butt ? 
  { 3 ; i know , right ? 
  would n't it be awesome to strangle your enemy to death ? 
  { 4 ; i know , right ? 
  most of it is a dumpster fire but there 's some gems, 
  { 5 ; i know , right ? 
  take my upvote and leave !, 
  thanks for the comment kind stranger, 
  this gets my glands going http://imgur.com/fe2nolx, 
  teaseai is an actual bot that wants to fuck if you want, 
  third reich, 
  try keeping your night eye closed for a while and look at the dark later , it 's pretty cool . 
  i also feel like a reanimated corpse in the morning ( well ... when i wake up , but come on , 12pm is morning , right ? ), 
  it 's 5am so i 'll chug a glass and report . 
  i do actually . 
  like my body did n't spend the last dozen or so hours killing itself silently . 
  1998 here . 
  pack your bags grandpa , we got this shit . 
  fucking cranky old people, 
  i dunno about you but i 'd like to find some new bands that are n't the same thing every month .
