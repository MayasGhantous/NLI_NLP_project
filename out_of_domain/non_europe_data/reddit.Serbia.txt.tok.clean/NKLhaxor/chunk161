  1 castrato boy max, 
  after the super best friends lp i had to get the soundtrack because it 's so good . 
  tfw disney supports terrorism, 
  there was a graph showing that a lot of european countries do n't have this problem . 
  people live together for decades, 
  is that poopoo in the toilet ? 
  they were jedi so nothing of value was lost, 
  more rule34 god, 
  well it 's coming to steam too and platinum 's games have great performance so you * should * be able to run it on older hardware . 
  while that is pretty cool since i do n't have to use a 3rd party app when are we getting an actual night mode ? 
  like high contrast but not old ? 
  copy that , bravo foxtrot . 
  your callsign from here on out is sapphire cummie fiver . 
  your objective is as follows :, 
  - deploy into neutral territory of your choosing and plant intel . 
  - you will leave a / r/jerktalkdiamond in your comment hyperlink [ like this ] ( / r/jerktalkdiamon ), 
  over . 
  roger that ms. president . 
  over, 
  cummies schmummies , over and out . 
  did someone say ... 
  [ egypto ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuhvcotsbam ) ?? 
  if you want to you can turn on your party at the end of both the new shadowrun games . 
  it 's not really that much of a spoiler because the contexts are different, 
  make them suffer guitarist also, 
  i 've already said many times that fir alone is a masterpiece, 
  like that one time when they tricked a guy into gassing a furry con, 
  kind, 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/metalcore/comments/5espx5/lachlan_monty_guitar_leaves_make_them_suffer/ ), 
  i 'd recommend to listen to both albums from start to finish . 
  every song is a banger expect for the intros , interludes and tracks like that . 
  so that 's what it actually does . 
  well now i 'm not ever turning it off since last time i did the anniversary update was shit broken and froze my pc ever time . 
  [ the rest is on their bandcamp ] ( https://assent.bandcamp.com/album/we-are-the-new-black-ep ) ( edit : actually , never mind ... you ca n't play the other tracks yet ) . 
  got ta say , this is a breath of fresh air . 
  reddit changed the algorithm so now there 's tons of porn on the front page , even just dudes showing their dicks, 
  it 's not an impossible ordeal even if you know nothing about computies and coding . 
  i just followed the tutorial on tesgeneral and i made a simple follower with bro team pill 's voice and it worked . 
  but then the creation kit broke and i could n't do anything with it so ... 
  i think it does . 
  yeah , i picked a bunch of lines from his machinima videos , so every time he killed someone he 'd do the [ knife in the throat ] ( https://youtu.be/8x4lj2p2dhc?t=1m8s ) and every time he got hit he 'd [ scream like so ] ( https://youtu.be/ctrmjqt4dmk?t=2s ) . 
  i 'm too lazy to make it again , but i 'll pick and provide the audio files for whoever wants to make it real, 
  edit : the `` you fucking scum fuckers '' from the star trek vid was also a planned warcry, 
  this was years ago so i do n't have it anymore but i think it 's probably possible . 
  i mean , i 'm not a modder i just use logic and tutorials . 
  but i do n't have anything better to do so i might do it . 
  i 'll let you know tomorrow . 
  i wan na do it but ck might not so we 'll see, 
  again ? 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hi-uxmseco0 ) is brotes best work imo . 
  he 's more into streaming these days, 
  try sharex, 
  `` slower . '', 
  * never mind * . 
  i tried it and it 's still pissing me off, 
  did you try the other characters ? 
  nero is just too slow and does n't have enough things for me , while dante has too many things and not enough damage . 
  vergil is the sweet spot , doing combo is n't that hard once you get the flow . 
  just a great chill album . 
  and i think this is a good band to introduce beginners to . 
  i looked at the [ stats in musicbee ] ( http://i.imgur.com/h2h7rnc.png ) and looks like my sister is really into them and normally she listens to rap and pop . 
  i think austin deserves a honorable mention . 
  he pushed himself so hard , even with a collapsed lung one time . 
  big problem, 
  referencing reddit memes like broken hands should deduct karma imo, 
  does n't it sound like a goddamn fanfiction ? 
  marry stav , he seems nice enough . 
  fuck nick , because he 's not husband material and he 'd probably try to kill me back . 
  kill adam because he 's adam, 
  the stone masketta man ? 
  dio ? 
  are they trying to make people healthy ? 
  you scum fucker , you are ** literally ** the reason this industry is dying, 
  my witcher 3 machine is the only thing i need . 
  they cut my power but i managed to set something up with my neighbor . 
  sure he and i both stink but that would n't bother geraldo, 
  did you just assume that person 's gender ? 
  no , you scum . 
  you live to do it another day, 
  i think those 2 bigs became the 1 big we all know now . 
  we 're still waiting for best friends ' top 10s of 2014, 
  is this aleks ' r1 moment ? 
  those are terrible ceo-hands imo . 
  i like those when a guy points with his thumb, 
  2 of them, 
  what a cool guy . 
  wish i could drink water like this boy, 
  it 's time to stop , tb, 
  unabbreviated pretzel, 
  a splinter cell game 's data extension was literally . ass, 
  lovecraftian squids are outside of our moral spectrum, 
  someone once said something like this :, 
  asocial : let 's not go to that party, 
  anti-social : let 's ruin that party, 
  what would make 2017 a god tier year for me : neckbeard rpg , nasdanq , vildhjarta album, 
  you geth are all racist, 
  i love when vildhjarta fans come out of the woodworks . 
  i mean me too , thall . 
  darlington is basically a beater, 
  there 's also smurfing where you make a new account and play against the noobs .
