  they realized how good smashing glass feels . 
  drowner shit, 
  get ready for censor induced blackface, 
  long dongers are realistic , just not everyone has them, 
  bitch , this ai n't * flame * souls , you blind ? 
  let 's get this dark party started right . 
  did you know that there 's an ice licking forum and one guy froze his piss and told his cousin that it 's lemonade . 
  he also had frozen `` milk '', 
  edit : it 's chewing actually , does n't make it less weird tho http://www.icechewing.com/, 
  [ the dennis angle ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwokqn7nvuu ), 
  our perfect shade of morally gray has become morally sarcastic !, 
  * an whomst 'd 've, 
  come on , dude ... people ** love ** nazis !, 
  they had cool clothes and shit . 
  if anything this should hook more people in . 
  at least the character stories are decent . 
  especially imperial agent 's . 
  probably never , hopefully soon . 
  [ assent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtrnporzuki ) really reminds me of the digital veil era tha . 
  first ep came out a few days ago, 
  it 's obviously an american killing spree enthusiast forum, 
  become grill, 
  there 's also the fan patches , so there 's no excuse pat , we can see your balls . 
  hey guys , todd howard speaking here , / u/nklhaxor is helping me out today !, 
  this site is so hard to use  _ < but i hear it 's the right place to ask !, 
  thank you all so so so so much , we 'll use this data to improve our gs and to make some gs if you know what i 'm saying  . 
  hopefully it 'll be good . 
  hopefully they 're not just cthulhu fanboys and it 's just `` got ta kill this giant evil monster '' a.k.a the # 1 lovecraftian game mistake . 
  that was the best executive order tbh, 
  maybe he has huge balls, 
  he will take down his mods ? 
  that will for sure make bethesda do something . 
  and the people ** love ** when modders do that . 
  fuck yeah , screw those money guzzlers . 
  no mods for them . 
  bruce from funhaus hugged 2 of those furry dick men and said it was really warm , wet and gross . 
  yo my dude , is there a version without the text ? 
  i 'm willing to trade . 
  how about a round of g w e n t for that meme ? 
  begone from my sight , there shall be no trades !, 
  just wait for the new robot race, 
  you too, 
  all of their stuff is solid , i 'd start from the start . 
  i do n't think she ( ? ), 
  knows we 're satyrs, 
  for scum . 
  shitposting is the way to karma for cool people, 
  as someone who has no fucking idea what kk is , what does this have to do with goofy and that anime kid with big shoes ? 
  there are more telltale talking hallways in this game than choices, 
  bioware has gameplay, 
  you 're cool , lukecis, 
  are you affiliated with / r/doctorbutts / ? 
  i had it 3 times . 
  first one was just short paralysis . 
  2nd was a spooky girl but then i headbutted her and promptly kissed her . 
  3rd one was a really creepy . 
  like a small shadow in the hallway saying `` i know everything about you , i am watching you , i will always be in your shadow . '', 
  in a really low demonic voice . 
  that was cool . 
  [ how about some celldweller ? 
  new album has some djent in it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obspxpqlfl4 ), 
  [ assent - we are the new black ep ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtrnporzuki ), 
  if you like [ the human abstract ( digital veil era ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwaso1vhgpy ) or just progcore in general you 'll like this . 
  he has fine items in his collection, 
  i tried to like pillars of eternity 5 times and every time i hate it . 
  i always hear how it 's so good but i ca n't figure out which part that is . 
  story is the only reason why i play crpgs so i just cheat through the combat ( i do n't find it fun , and being overpowered feels nice ) . 
  not a single piece of text in this goddamn game hooked me in . 
  people say you can be evil ( and i love being the evil guy in games ) but the story is just so boring . 
  it 's so frustrating , i want to cry . 
  please support amd, 
  the fact that poe had 2 expansions and is getting a sequel while tyranny is n't even done is making me really salty . 
  i actually want poe 2 to bomb . 
  have n't felt hatred like this since high school, 
  you should get that screen calibrated, 
  my meme detector is cold , so nope, 
  can the mouth suck ? 
  is this some klingon shit ? 
  here 's my attempt :, 
  this dyson sphere has ** no honor ** !, 
  they picked a great time with the new movies and the rise of prequel memes, 
  oh those people are super real, 
  reminds me of mindless loyalty to the sith empire and i like it . 
  deus vult , you animals, 
  he 's doing a subscription yell contest this sunday on twitch . 
  it 's gon na be a special night, 
  claymore , dude, 
  1v1 because it 's simple . 
  4v4 is a mess and 2v2 is cancer . 
  am i an idiot or is ignition one the only way to read 567-585 ? 
  welp , i ran out of good jojo part 5 scans . 
  probably out sooner than the zaibatsu 's best of 2014, 
  i just cheated through dai . 
  there 's way too much bullshit in the game to waste your time . 
  if you wan na watch a short series of videos where somebody shits on the game look at [ funhaus ' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yehfu7qkajc ) lp . 
  ( it was inside gaming at the time actually ), 
  i made [ this ] ( https://soundcloud.com/nick-thedude-haxor/sets/gobs-n-skels-reanimation-of-the-dead-links-for-the-first-time ) recently, 
  that 's a great jojoke, 
  i wish i could play it for the first time and this time not in reverse order for whatever fucking reason past me did that . 
  psssh ... your fired ... kid ...
