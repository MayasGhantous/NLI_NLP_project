  post ironic autism, 
  when 's the cum crusade ? 
  who says the creepy uncle ca n't be a fun uncle as well ? 
  your memes end here , unfortunately . 
  it 's a rather short path to gratuitous murder . 
  seized . 
  it 's revolt.group now, 
  imagine a havel toothpick build, 
  `` you do n't know whatcha messin ' with , woolie . '', 
  [ woolie misses with the toothpick , gets ganked ], 
  `` i hate you ! '', 
  pepsi for life , bitch, 
  it 's not a loss if you never had it, 
  and tg is edgy on purpose . 
  the mc himself says that if he were in a story it 'd be a tragedy . 
  so far it 's been pretty rough for him . 
  i fully expect him to die or go completely crazy, 
  at least i got the last laugh when i killed that guy during the server death, 
  seems you received a flesh wound there , brother . 
  here 's your arm \\ \\ . 
  get well soon , we need to crusade all over their asses, 
  when someone mentions that you can go through a game without killing anyone i wan na do the exact opposite . 
  it 's only fun if your fortress is crumbling into magma and your dorfs are hanging on by their entrails . 
  slaaneshi tiddies here we come !, 
  is there any reason to seek his name or is just for loons ? 
  hopefully we can beg for more crack, 
  gunshot noise to the face, 
  `` so be it , the cycle continues '', 
  i think i 'm in love with nu-metalcore . 
  i listened to darke complex , \u751f conform \u6b7b , the gloom in the corner and now ocean grove for days . 
  there are no shows here and even if there were i still would n't bother to go so i listen to everything . 
  am i crazy ? 
  [ is this a tiny breakdown ] ( https://youtu.be/cx01foysc6e?t=4m2s ) in a behemoth song ? 
  i want someone to make a picture of a bug , pat , cthulhu , nyarlathotep and finally azathoth saying `` do n't let it set in . '', 
  yeah , i know how stupid it is . 
  but since we have all the cthulhu memes ( which i kinda hate , honestly ) it 'd make me cackle . 
  just the idea of azathoth getting anxious about existence is amazing, 
  also sharex , no longer will you need to pop out the phone to take screenshots and get yelled at, 
  the most honorable of phantoms, 
  \\  not using your ` st, 
  terrorist propaganda , our soldiers are great shots . 
  it 's just that they had a shitty batch of weapons that one time, 
  somehow this applies to almost every force of nature . 
  wind , snow , water , dirt, 
  youtubers with weird fancy voices ruin everything, 
  does he get more dark side character development ? 
  i 'm a sucker for that kind of stuff, 
  killing her himself woulda been way more badass , dude, 
  yes let 's make a new one . 
  how aboit groimp ? 
  sold . 
  it 's going on my high priority list of things to watch, 
  hannibal is getting pushed a lot . 
  season 4 please . 
  also ... [ what are the lore implications of this ? 
  / r/anime _ irl is real . 
  and good, 
  something is fucky . 
  10 mins and no brawl or duel , but i get dom and elimination in less than a minute, 
  well , hold on ... 
  i think we should exterminate both of them but let 's not be silly now . 
  we could use rule34 and hentai after the war, 
  waiting for make them suffer and vildhjarta . 
  at least mts has a single out , vildhjarta is like a black hole, 
  [ do you know about meme magic and the collective consciousness ? 
  if we put our minds and hearts to it anything can and will happen !, 
  ] ( https://pepethefrogfaith.wordpress.com/ ), 
  i made a [ thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/metalcore/comments/51fegj/what_are_your_favorite_albums_with_a_story_and/ ) 5 months ago asking for more bands with stories in their lyrics . 
  there might some some good shit in there for you, 
  edit : this was n't out back then i think , so here 's also [ the gloom in the corner ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfahysqhibu ), 
  it 's missing the part before that tho , the `` rrrrackada comed uh rrruhckada killuh '', 
  they 're usually better fighters but ca n't comprehend how ladders work, 
  yeah , i know it 's death stranding , just memeing, 
  oh dude , then the s3 finale might be an overdose for you . 
  you know ... 
  i would abandon the crusade if the weebs had more jojo references . 
  do it , you know you want to . 
  it 's what woolie would 've done . 
  it 's too good to wait for other humans, 
  i take no responsibility if she eats you for being rude . 
  most bots i played are better than players . 
  players make mistakes , like not blocking a combo , bots almost always interrupt your combo . 
  this is honestly the best thing i 've seen today, 
  after reading tokyo ghoul : re i 'm super down for this trope, 
  i ` ts not what it looks like !, 
  he 's actually a viking, 
  the placebo experiment went wrong, 
  everything about the game is hype . 
  even the game creator is hype ( kojima is cool , but does he have long hair , a beard and a cane ? ), 
  he was one of the only good parts of that e3 . 
  even drunk bro team was hype over this guy, 
  it 's all about the memes , you fool !, 
  ** you fool !, 
  ** plagues upon your kind !, 
  this sha n't be the last you see of us !, 
  it might even out once the beta ends . 
  for now it 's basically a free game, 
  how murky are we talking about ? 
  because in tyranny ( same guys who made poe ) you can [ spoilers for blade grave quest ] ( #s `` snuff a babby with a pillow '' ), 
  and it 's not just a thing to do out of malice , it 's for more power basically .
