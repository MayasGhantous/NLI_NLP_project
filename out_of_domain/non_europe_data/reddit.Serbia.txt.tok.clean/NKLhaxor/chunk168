  you 're fucking someone over either way, 
  i get that . 
  but i do n't get why is it a casual club thing kind of thing, 
  is shoulder/shield bashing a good strat ? 
  i ca n't tell if it helps, 
  absolutely . 
  hopefully we 'll get to that post-human future where we eat and drink from artificial genitals soon, 
  crusading is our business and business is good . 
  you started this war and plunged skyrim into chaos and now ashfeld is going to put you down , and restore the peace . 
  conqueror doing the arthur fist clench meme, 
  man , i do n't really care if the game is good , i just hope we 'll get some short haired android rule34 . 
  2b is not enough, 
  not short enough . 
  i know 2b 's hair is the same length but she 's new and has a boo t, 
  edit : what did i even say, 
  we owe it to yoko taro and whoever made that hole tweet . 
  heroes, 
  my nat changed from green to orange . 
  i was n't on the p2p hate train when the beta started but this is pretty shit . 
  i can barely finish a match without someone teleporting or disconnecting . 
  it 's literally simon says . 
  and it 's * guard * break not attack break . 
  you either interrupt with a faster attack or block/parry . 
  the only advice i have for you if you 're on pc is to put the guard mouse sensitivity at like 15 or 20 if it 's not a sensitive mouse . 
  your guard side will switch a lot faster, 
  i guess you can interpret it like that , but i did it so i could get the doomsday spell . 
  i 'm from the `` babies are worthless '' scum school of thought if you could n't tell . 
  did the anarchy path and brute forced through everything . 
  all for revenge, 
  it rustles me greatly, 
  only scrubs summon friends , you can totally solo, 
  did n't work for me , must 've hit a nerve or something, 
  how long till someone goes full spaghettuja ? 
  [ mr centipede by ocean grove ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxopnxbgrvy&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player ) . 
  i doubt it has anything to do with tg but the lyrics and sound are giving me vibes . 
  and obviously the name caught my eye, 
  that 's pletty lacist dude, 
  [ new album , any day now !, 
  is n't that fables ? 
  it was kinda flaccid tho . 
  this will make a fine addition to my collection . 
  they even sound the same, 
  king crimson is simple compared to pat 's crazy talk, 
  does n't his vampiro blood give him physical power ? 
  did you try stellaris ? 
  my mind eventually stops working while playing other paradox grand strategy games . 
  stellaris is super easy to get into tho, 
  yes, 
  necro bat lady is top tier nightmare waifu, 
  [ spoiler ] ( #s `` i hope i 'm not misremembering this . 
  you talk to the tzimisce in an abandoned building but all his replies seem like they would be from a rushed game . 
  short awkward replies like `` hmm ... 
  yes . '', 
  it would 've been better to just not use any voiced lines for him . '' ), 
  and [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37warrmqs_m ) is the actual ending after all that, 
  woolie is a natural liar . 
  he got you , dude, 
  i was about to ask `` are they tho ? '' . 
  but then i remembered griffith, 
  set to stun would be god tier without cleans . 
  same for periphery . 
  ^ do n't ^ even ^ try ^ to ^ change ^ my ^ opinion, 
  storage unit like that one guy from dark side of youtube, 
  live conform die , assent , . gif from god . 
  all found on bandcamp, 
  gon na warn you then , it 's definitely not in it 's final form . 
  there are still major patches coming , with one on the way soon . 
  it 's gon na add dyson spheres and shit ( some of it is a free patch and other things are dlc locked ) . 
  so wait for that thing and check out / r/stellaris, 
  it 's not my fetish but i 'll manage, 
  right now , barely . 
  there 's not a lot of in depth diplomacy , mostly just trading and time based agreements for mutual benefit . 
  and it depends on who you attack . 
  mostly it 's fine and the bystanders will notice you being a dick but they wo n't take action right away . 
  some might even be afraid of you , others will hate you . 
  but you can totally just exterminate ( or enslave ) the whole galaxy , even your own species if you want to . 
  next patch will let you * eat * them . 
  i 'm a predator fanboy so i had an orgasm playing it . 
  hopefully the new predator movie will spawn another avp or just a predator game . 
  deja vu but still , fuck 'em and purge . 
  i wish he made more music tbh, 
  they will all burn in hell , do n'tcha now ? 
  honestly [ timeless numbers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hycqibvl880 ) is a lot better than this track so check it out, 
  been thinking about this and it 's not really about heaviness for me . 
  more about the emotion in music and how the music makes me feel . 
  for example i recently got recommended to take a look at king crimson and ho boy , epitaph is a really good song . 
  and i did n't know kanye had other good songs other than power . 
  but as long as core ( and metal and everything else in general ) does n't get stale i 'll always listen to it . 
  they 're professionals but they do laugh sometimes . 
  i do n't remember who it was but 2 wrestlers were on the floor outside the ring laying face down next to each other and they were laughing about something . 
  the camera got close enough so you could hear it, 
  but rolling would mean dropping the comfy shield, 
  imagine how dry his teeth would be, 
  i do n't like your face dude tbh, 
  do n't fuck with this conqueror, 
  if the warfu demands war then i shall wage war . 
  she looks really cool so that 's reason enough for me, 
  can we make an island where we have full penetration , full dismemberment and no censorship ? 
  [ actual footage of their reactions ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ar2pjzahe-y ), 
  somehow the universe changed and we do n't know how or when,
