  that peace wo n't last long . 
  flat enthusiasts and boob lovers are forever locked in battle, 
  girls love nyarlathotep 's crimson tongue tho, 
  i 'm kinda interested in this so a few questions ( i 'm probably overthinking a lot of stuff but i 've read both this and the sidebar on your sub but i 'd like more specifics if that 's fine ) . 
  how would one go about placing a character into the world ? 
  i 'm thinking backstory , how the character fits in and how would he appear . 
  character power growth , how 's that work ? ~ ~, 
  any restrictions on cannibalism ? 
  i know you 're not handing kakujas out yet but can i just eat other ghouls ? 
  if i started eating ghouls ( probably just the kakuhou ) as an investigator would that be fine ? 
  one of the stupid questions but how do you plan on interacting with another user 's character ? 
  reddit dm , discord or just like right there in the comment section ? ~ ~, 
  how unique or wacky can you go with your character ? 
  are psychological tropes like amnesia , alter egos , plain insanity etc. 
  allowed ? 
  can a character start out like a ceo at a big company with enough context ? 
  ( not planning on it , just curious ), 
  are there nameless npcs/cannon fodder characters for both sides ? 
  edit : nevermind 2 and 5 . 
  i might have possibly not read as much as i had thought . 
  after actually reading hpl i got sick of it too . 
  we should team up and push the planks back, 
  did you cum tho ? 
  how dare you say that , you scrunt . 
  you groible , you narg, 
  i know what you mean fam , if i 'm not annoying someone or killing digital avatars i feel nothing, 
  / uj is this fucking real ?

  just when we thought he was back , it pulled him back out, 
   metre, 
  to have a girl i 'd have to get up and talk and that 's already asking way too much . 
  also try higher level bots , they 're no joke . 
  can be better than players but not in a broken cheating way, 
  should i look this guy up or should i believe that he 's just an angery golden man ? 
  post this to / r/kappa , they 'll eat it up . 
  you guys got really mad at each other over screamo , now become friends again,

  the switch between songs like city to party by myself is so fucking jarring . 
  from a catharthic image of a burning city to weed . 
  silent planet 's the night god slept sounds like it 's underwater compared to everything was sound . 
  when i put on [ the well ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjbv51rjg3m ) i expect a sudden change in sound in but nope it 's still muddy, 
  well yeah there 's shitposting between us jtd regulars but it 's all for diamo the diamond i plastered all over that banner . 
  how does this not make sense ?

  3 real comedians talking about shit . 
  they make fun of nazis ( and everything else , honestly ) but have a lot of nazi listeners somehow, 
  truly the bottom tier fetish, 
  i wish they 'd `` reshadow '' this album like ice nine kills did . 
  the underwater feeling goes away eventually and it sounds like atmospheric rain metal, 
  mine , of course . 
  short hair and thick but fit bodies . 
  casca from berserk is the perfect example, 
  what if that 's just kira ? 
  have we been tricked into being gay ? 
  well of course , fh talks about dicks and women all the time,

  i 'm not even mad that he 's all over the place . 
  what is his plan even ? 
  his dream is super unclear, 
  probably porn, 
  i 'm guessing frankenstein 's monster ? 
  is there anything on how to improve my life without doing anything ? 
  yuwryyyyyyyyyy on ice, 
  ** wheeeeeeeeze **, 
  this reminds me of shitting dick nipples, 
  it 's far from the worst thing a musician has done , people make it sound like he committed genocide . 
  how did he even fuck up if it was `` would 've been , could 've been , should 've been '' on snakes start to sing ? 
  why would you ever do anything nice for aliens ?

  he also has instrumental albums like [ transmissions ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z58lpippl6u ) and instrumental versions of his regular albums . 
  edit : thanks for introducing me to glass animals btw , they 're great, 
  now you got me thinking , what the hell even is morality ? 
  and is n't the religion of self like satanism ? 
  please yourself , keep to yourself , do n't harm others but retaliate ? 
  that was a pretty good one , professor . 
  you son of a bitch you did it again, 
  a part of me thinks it 's going to be fine . 
  the other thinks it 's gon na shit the bed . 
  what i 'm hoping for is for it to be the hypest shit ever, 
  screw you , friend .

  things must 've gone down hill for hannibal if he 's going to arstotzka, 
  opacity ? 
  i read that in a robo french voice, 
  not a singer but from what i 've read , vocals can take a toll if you 're not careful . 
  vocal chords are muscles so they need warm up , you need to stay hydrated , make sure your technique is n't bad for you etc. 
  i doubt it 's easy to sing for 40 minutes, 
  damn girl , you got them long cheek flappers, 
  what they think is irrelevant . 
  only i matter . 
  and my species i guess, 
  i hate kids, 
  i expected a zoom in on his face being smug and saying `` gon na be promoted to captain for this '' in a cockney accent, 
  we will be going to space one day , is n't that fucked up ? 
  nemesis system bots would be pretty sweet, 
  once they start doing math and numbers i tap out and look at memes again,
