  only at the start , but then it 's straight when you become a girl with a dick, 
  same . 
  now i do n't even remember what happened in the previous chapters . 
  like wait what when did mutsuki start chasing uta ( ? ) ? 
  where am i ? 
  this is the first thing i read about jolyne and that 's fine, 
  irredeemable scum, 
  \u266b it 's not the east or the west side \u266b, 
  that 's fine, 
  i wan na make like 9 different colored `` notices '' fields for factions . 
  how would i go about doing that ? 
  one of them was [ viking ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/211160/ ), 
  ~ ~ i might be doing something wrong . 
  i can only select the edges of the hexes not the space inside . ~ ~ nevermind , did n't use magic wand, 
  that 's hot, 
  sounds like something eric zahn would play, 
  i just do n't find most of them interesting so i do n't even talk to them . 
  had vildhjarta for a year . 
  channeling my energy for the new album, 
  this is an interesting situation you 're in . 
  what 's your policy on doppelgangers ? 
  i 'd kill mine . 
  after having sex , of course, 
  [ well ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nru9mpn.png ) it 's better than our old map but what i did to your map is a crime . 
  we 're gon na fill out the sides with * something * once we decide what we wan na do since we 're probably not gon na get a ship . 
  we already killed 2 people in cold blood out of greed and dissolved a party member in a barrel of acid . 
  one of the most notable differences between the 2 are the drunk states iirc . 
  in iv you can fall or trip really easily and you behave like a rag doll . 
  a sidewalk is enough for a faceplant . 
  in v it feels more controlled , animated . 
  do n't remember falling down anywhere other than the stairs in michael 's house .

  i just have this image in my head of a ghost possessing a computer to download recording software, 
  here 's the teaser thing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26jp9pasfka, 
  i dunno , found it in another thread . 
  but it was probably either on patreon or nick 's twitter, 
  oh goddamn that 's one of my worst nightmares . 
  shit happening to you while you sleep, 
  you expected haise to be the new main character , but it was me kaneki !, 
  did wiz just pull a thanks obama ? 
  you 're a big ayy . 
  1 basically had frogger in a disc . 
  2 was connecting matching symbols that were obscured till you hovered over them . 
  another one was about finding the required block of scrolling text 3 times ( this was for unlocking data pads i think ) . 
  3 got rid of the hacking minigames , shepard would just put his omni tool up to the door while fancy effects played . 
  i 'm playing a stars without numbers game with friends and last session we casually dissolved a party member in acid because he got pissed when we tried to give him a smaller cut . 
  i thought not . 
  it 's not a story the mods would tell you . 
  ok , so imagine you were gon na punch your screen . 
  ok now let 's king crimson this scene . 
  what then happens is : your screen is broken , your fist is bleeding but you did n't even swing . 
  time has been skipped/erased between point a and b , only the result of your erased action remains . 
  i do n't know why would anyone ever look at the home page . 
  gaining steam one might say, 
  i kinda love matt 's half asleep verbal shitposting, 
  / r/fitdrawngirls is a great thing . 
  nsfw of course, 
  sometimes you might want that thick forehead bone armor all the way down to your nose, 
  the centipede , no doubt . 
  one of my worst nightmares too, 
  i read everything in the senate 's voice . 
  am i the senate ? 
  god is not legal, 
  it 's treason then . 
  you might like [ the hard times ] ( http://thehardtimes.net/ ), 
  i guess i read the title but forgot after 10 seconds of thinking that it was : re only . 
  but the most memorable one was sasarious . 
  it was the moment i got over kaneki 's `` death '' and started loving haise . 
  iv is actually better at the physics department than v. well ... better might be wrong because there are some goofy things but it definitely had more features, 
  i 'm more of a slash along the forearm in case of emergency kinda guy, 
  goddamn i should n't have read it , now it 's spoiled . 
  i only read the description of the manga and try to predict what will happen . 
  10 out of 10 times i am % 100 wrong, 
  is the cumcord still alive ?

  [ here 's all of it in action ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjgc2xbiegq ) and a [ somewhat lengy article ] ( http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-02-12-one-thing-about-gta4-has-never-been-bettered ) . 
  i agree that the changes were to fix complaints and for performance but they got rid of too many things and changed it for the worse in my opinion . 
  if they could get the built in self preservation from iv ( like protecting their heads while tumbling around ) with the gravity of v it would look great . 
  do n't forget the other [ thing ] ( https://i.imgur.com/3hnrmal.jpg ), 
  edit : i do n't know the context of the thing and i 'd prefer to remain ignorant, 
  [ ocean grove - rhapsody tapes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2lo5fyasdu ) . 
  it 's atmospheric nu-metalcore , and if you told me that i 'd love that a year ago i 'd laugh really hard . 
  nothing else i 'd put on my top list so far . 
  but ditto on new hu and miw . 
  also waiting for make them suffer and vildhjarta, 
  edit : as for other genres , behemoth and celldweller pls, 
  i say it like deer en gray . 
  better than dur en gray i always hear, 
  darke complex . 
  i like saying the e at the end . 
  i know the word , meaning and pronounciation but i say perry fairy for some reason . 
  also , anaal nathrakh , you can probably guess which part and what, 
  this ? 
  [ if ` drown ' goes on the album , it means it has n't gone well !, 
  ] ( http://www.digitalspy.com/music/interviews/a613448/bring-me-the-horizon-our-teenage-selves-would-be-offended-by-our-new-single/ ), 
  intimate alien , mr. centipede and beers are the most memorable . 
  but the album is pretty short so i just listen to the whole thing over and over, 
  [ i 'm looking for a whore ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhvlra4jsog ), 
  i honestly do n't like any of the waifus , i always go garrus ~ ~ and i would go for him with male shepard if i could too ~ ~ actually no , now that i think about it , it 's more of a bromance, 
  i 'm with you and pat , dude .
