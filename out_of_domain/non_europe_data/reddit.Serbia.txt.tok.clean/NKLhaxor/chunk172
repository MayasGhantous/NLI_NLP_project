  fuck that guy, 
  i wonder if they 're doing anything new with cthulhu and lovecraftian shit with the new dlc for ck2 . 
  i know there 's a quest or something but the new dlc makes me wan na learn the game, 
  if you tried to liberate my hive mind i 'd for sure burn everything to the ground so there 's nothing left to liberate, 
  hope i 'm not wrong but i read somewhere that ss3 was supposed to be a some random military shooter at one point so that 's why there 's the rilfe with ads and the desert town setting, 
  not very giant of him, 
  how 's the roleplay element , specifically for an ambiguously evil character ? 
  you have no idea . 
  the first mugen game i played had some knock off vegita that had a super which was 30 seconds of low quality brazilian talking and yelling, 
  darth plagueis + others = life, 
  darth plagueis + self = irony, 
  never explain anything - h.p. 
  lovecraft . 
  it worked for him a billion years ago, 
  try to grab power for yourself and becoming the bigger bad guy or switching sides . 
  well the 2 seem to slightly disagree with you but i 'll try it anyway . 
  one of my favorite shows , what do dislike about it ? 
  genuinely curious . 
  i love that light guitar sprinkled among the heavy chugs, 
  i do n't really care . 
  predators was a safe movie with some weird things super predators included, 
  once again , the best friends are too scurred . 
  [ team four star ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgk9vupsulg ) just started an lp with one guy that knows berserk tho, 
  oh yeah , somehow i missed that . 
  it mainly reminded me of most hated breakdwon . 
  but i like it even more now that you pointed it out, 
  well , we do n't have black people where i live so i do n't have strong feelings about that but i do get the prom thing . 
  my advice is to watch s10e4 charlie work , s05e02 the gang hits the road , s6e13 a very sunny christmas . 
  those are my top 3 . 
  oh , and [ s4e12 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3ccuthrctq ), 
  you should try to focus on what 's important : that they 're horrible people doing horrible things and laugh at them, 
  kinda hard to not shit on a sub par berserk game . 
  i do n't even think it 's a good musou game, 
  think of the possibilities , we could get rid of the horrible rubbery parts !, 
  yeah , not really . 
  i like being a dick to npcs and sarcastic to friends and turning at the very end , in a `` well shit , maybe you should 've trusted me so much , no hard feelings tho . 
  i went with the tvtropes description of the trope . 
  cool all the way up until the end, 
  not that into djent as a whole it 's just that vildhjarta does it so good among other things they do so good, 
  take him down boys , no need to be gentile . 
  ok , is this a joak or do they actually have them in the predator comic lore ? 
  tell me what you know , i need to know, 
  well there is but it 's not that important . 
  it 's mostly battle damage the other characters receive , like cricket . 
  and how they ruin their reputation with other characters . 
  there are no things like `` let 's go back to doing that thing we did yesterday '' . 
  every episode has its own self contained plot and sometimes it includes past characters . 
  if you want all of the context and subtle in jokes like who 's a delusional gay man or a sociopath you 'll wan na watch from the start . 
  but the episodes i recommended are good examples of their wacky adventures, 
  do n't just stare at it , eat it !, 
  and then there 's humanities last breath , vildhjarta 's darker brother, 
  better be even hyper than the first one, 
  it 's probably gay . 
  la la land is probably gay too, 
  spencer is so good in this one, 
  expect nothing , receive less, 
  the stand that fooled the world, 
  as a resident of / aco / i welcome creepy plague cartoons, 
  i still ca n't believe the uk has fucking ** shadow ministers **, 
  i do n't anything about politics just that it sounds hype as fuck, 
  i do n't like pixel porn, 
  left :, 
  motionless in white, 
  make them suffer, 
  silent planet, 
  ice nine kills, 
  fiveto died for this, 
  yeah but think of how many maniacs give him money on patreon for more, 
  never give up . 
  never surrender . 
  yeah , i 'm hoping this is n't the last version . 
  avp 2010 's executions blow this out of the water, 
   high quality posts, 
  we all know that there will be many phone screenshots, 
  i forgot that was a thing because it never happened, 
  same . 
  no escape for them next time , gon na play it through the discord voice chat bot while we 're getting ready for an rpg session . 
  cum boy profiles and their original characters ? 
  whenever a thing is missing a name randomizer it 's getting named something like `` goblinade juice '', 
  [ hellions ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6snbftrqsqo ) is pretty happy but not in that forced way too sweet sound , if you know what i mean, 
  i 'm not really a fan but i 'd like to see where this train is going . 
  i wear mine like an armband, 
  it is a good pain, 
  that was harder to read than any of his imaginary names and words, 
  just a lil ' bit, 
  it 's a spooky catchy hobo song , of course it does, 
  elves are always gay ass sluts by definition so that does n't really count, 
  looks like a trap, 
  yeah this is what i was looking for . 
  listen up friendos , specifically listen to :, 
  [ ocean grove - the rhapsody tapes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2lo5fyasdu ) weird blend of nu metal and atmospheric metalcore with heavy and soft parts . 
  [ villain of the story - wrapped in vines , covered in thorns ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k58to1jkfeq ) . 
  on the other end of the spectrum , nothing really innovative but still a banger . 
  [ darkest hour - godless prophets and the migrant flora ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hycqibvl880 ) . 
  and here we have a return to the older sound . 
  edit :, 
  how about some non-core ? 
  [ persefone - aathma ] ( https://youtu.be/nnraiwlql1g?t=12s ) it 's pretty good, 
  it 's how the nipponese say it , obviously it must be the correct way, 
  best horse,
