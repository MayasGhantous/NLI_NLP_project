  they would n't . 
  it 's a sith legend . 
  [ live die conform ] ( https://liveconformdie.bandcamp.com/releases ) and [ yuth forever ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3vl9i9fxe ), 
  how about [ . gif from god ] ( https://giffromgod.bandcamp.com/track/rats ) ? 
  i 'd take a gravel mound like notim portant any day over little loli shitkids, 
  if you look up `` how long snail sleep '' it 'll say years, 
  tfw you try everything and give up because of a goddamn panda, 
  i got sleepy while watching plague of gripes talk about bricks in dark souls at 10pm . 
  it is 7am and i do not feel like a corpse like usual , help, 
  was n't expecting it to be this good , goddamn, 
  [ he 's very real ] ( http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/no._i_did_not_save_your_lifechris_motionless_on_insincere_music_culture ), 
  ca n't be a good xeno if you 're disintegrated, 
  i 'm late but , yep . 
  another fine addition to my collection, 
  not feeling the fence because that 's physical manwork but i do feel like looking at weird furry futanari dicks, 
  doing nothing is infinitely easier . 
  shame it 's being slept on . 
  it 's nothing special but it sounds fucking great, 
  people overhype this kind of stuff every time . 
  i hate crickets and cricket-type creatures so much now, 
  try oathbreaker and reflections . 
  also , really early underoath was some kind black metalcore or something, 
  tendo snitch, 
  i i i i, 
  i 'd avoid the various boorus and pixivs if i were you . 
  and the 2booty subreddit , oh so awful . 
  i 'm always asking that, 
  while you 're at it check out make them suffer and carnifex . 
  might fit as well, 
  too much hair , should be put to the sword imo, 
  if i knew how to draw i would draw an sw double barrel shotty with woolie and solaire as the shells , a la sex pistols, 
  do n't try it, 
  not yet, 
  shadow of mordor came outta nowhere , there 's probably something else hidden and the year is still young . 
  [ this old thread might interest you . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/metalcore/comments/51fegj/what_are_your_favorite_albums_with_a_story_and/ ), 
  oh yeah , since the thread is old i found some new shit . 
  check out [ slice the cake 's odyssey to the west ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91eo0nxisgq ) and [ the gloom in the corner ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfahysqhibu ), 
  balance ? 
  they got posted here a few times but i actually got into them in this thread where [ i asked the drummer about the story ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/metalcore/comments/5o3u5n/check_out_my_band_thread_january_2017/dchgi15/ ), 
  if we dissect every single lizard we ca n't say we missed any . 
  that might be the thing that got me into this stuff, 
  i 'm for sure not going insane while waiting for a new album . 
  edit : [ felt like sharing this ] ( https://gfycat.com/bruisedknobbyiberianchiffchaff ) this is from one of their tour videos on their channel , there 's other shenanigans there, 
  you never really know . 
  people have died from less and survived worse . 
  i 'm going with the theory i saw on / r/djent . 
  that they got so heavy they collapsed into a black hole so time goes slower for them . 
  [ i found this scene strangely jojo-ish ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcy9aju3dii ), 
  my man know, 
  do n't try it, 
  s12 e6 hero or hate crime, 
  do you tho ? 
  parties and streams are not the same tho, 
  also sounds like a friendcast episode, 
  i 'm waiting for something cool to happen like the sith empire , otherwise i 'm just laughing at everyone, 
  only the most heavy and brutal kind of metal . 
  metalcore, 
  launching the game straight into the gameplay . 
  like , no thanks friend . 
  i wan na tweak my options so your game does n't run like shit because i do n't have a perfect computie, 
  there 's some good shit there but plenty of elitists so i dunno, 
  try musixmatch , it 's synced lyrics, 
  love the varg and black metal memes . 
  meanwhile i have n't listened to a single classic metal or slayer song in my life so do n't know what that 's all about, 
  it 's not a word the jedi would use . 
  is bloom a big thing ? 
  i always turn it off because i think it looks like dog shit, 
  do n't speak for me , friend . 
  i hate both, 
  i live in a cave and i use the power of the mind to interface with you maniacs, 
  i 'm on the other side of the core spectrum . 
  i hate crabcore, 
  so if ... 
  if pat is wrong does that mean that griffith is not wrong ? 
  the giant dream is just a dream now . 
  even huge is not happening . 
  darlington is big , at best . 
  race war now ? 
  [ playing football ... 
  blind !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3onojhki-k ), 
  make them suffer, 
  fit for a king, 
  as someone who does not go to shows , i do n't really care what bands do with computer magic to their sound . 
  i 'd even listen to robots, 
  it 's a skel legend . 
  not sure about the name but the windu and palpie fight is pretty brutal in the book . 
  [ video on the subject ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x2gb3xhnfc ), 
  `` on the hoof '' for `` alive '' or not yet dead, 
  yoda 's voice is one of those that pretty much anybody can do , like golum 's or kermit 's . 
  so why the fuck, 
  was getting caught part of your plan , chancellor ? 
  skiirm memes are so 2011 . 
  only the freshest 00s memes please, 
  how about we get some [ mathematics ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ixbl1rekqy ) up in this b ? 
  `` that song '' is the only recognition it deserves, 
  this war of mine ? 
  it 's not a first person tree puncher tho, 
  how is that not the best thing since predator ?
