  if you do n't [ think this is good ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2lo5fyasdu ) , then i think you have shit taste , honestly . 
  cold world was shit , maybe one song was just alright . 
  besides , i did n't really listen to nu-metal as much as everyone else apparently did . 
  just linkin park and hollywood undead , so maybe that 's why i like what i like . 
   game bar, 
  i have no idea what that even is, 
  it 's not a boozle if i do n't mind the extra meat, 
  it went completely under the radar, 
  anyone having thall withdrawal ? 
  here 's a fix called [ harkla ] ( https://harkla.bandcamp.com/album/necrosis ) . 
  i might be biased because i think that rock lee is a fucking goober but the madara vs hundreds of jobbers fight was my favorite . 
  is that the same guy from the intimate alien video ? 
  love his weird moves, 
  really reminded me of anakin , kinda hate the ending tho, 
  it was intense but i feel like the movie ended just because it had to . 
  it felt really flaccid . 
  and i almost always root for the `` villain '' , so fuck that guy . 
  well i do n't like textbook villain deaths . 
  something different would 've been nice but the rest of the movie was great . 
  somebody post that bleach gif, 
  in vampire ( the white wolf rpg ) a tzimisce had a flesh and bone * castle *, 
  it 's an abyss legend . 
  darth plagueis was a darkwraith of the abyss , so powerful and so wise he could use the dark hand to steal humanity ... 
  he had such a knowledge of the dark that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying . 
  the dark is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural . 
  he became so powerful ... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his humanity , which eventually , of course , he did . 
  unfortunately , he taught his apprentice everything he knew , then his apprentice killed him in his sleep . 
  it 's ironic he could save others from death , but not himself . 
  guess i 'm blind . 
  actually love his progress towards becoming a villain , his death is the thing i hate . 
  hah , what the fuck was that ? 
  those guy are for sure dead . 
  or we get wrong turn x bantam, 
  politics are the most retarded fucking thing, 
  would be cool to start as a slave species made for war . 
  or a fallen empire . 
  or an invader . 
  or a robit . 
  or anything else , really . 
  so it 's supposed to be `` state your intentions , robot lookin ' ass '' ? 
  also correct me if i 'm wrong , kotor is not * not * canon . 
  a while ago bioware said that disney did n't tell them if kotor was canon or not . 
  also there was some kotor stuff in one of the tv shows . 
  that 's just extra money on the already guaranteed money pile star wars makes . 
  did anyone else notice how woolie turns away from the person he 's talking to almost every time ? 
  it bothers me because it looks like the conversation is gon na end . 
  '' ** hey guys ** !, 
  * clap * so today i 'm going to tell you about my ... para * clap * normal * clap * experience * clap * '', 
  what flavor is it ? 
  nice , man . 
  just take it and purge them later ... oh wait , ca n't purge ourselves anymore . 
  his speech is too soft imo . 
  the vergil screams are on point tho, 
  looks fuckin ' sick so far, 
  and this is all still happening at the dark party , with kaathe in the background wearing a lampshade on his head, 
  remember that time when ric flair ran the undertaker of the ramp with his skelewheel ? 
  got ta get that dirty loli money, 
  in serbia we have the drekavac ( screamer , yeller , shouter etc. ) . 
  an undead child of sorts that spells doom and screams * really * loud . 
  looks hairy and has a big doglike head . 
  then there 's baba roga ( commonly known as baba yaga ) , scary enigmatic old lady that might eat you , you know . 
  and sava savanovic . 
  the `` first serbian vampire '' . 
  he 's just a vampire that lived in a mill . 
  that mill crumbled in 2012 and the authorities issued a health warning that he 's looking for a new home . 
  a new era of baneposting, 
   - did you heard of the tragedy that reach the man, 
   - not, 
   - i think to be too is not . 
  kinda dark souls-ish, 
  here 's some new unknown stuff : [ loathe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0mvzilak4 ) , [ harkla ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=429yu1hb--o ) , [ forevermore ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znypgp_7nje ), 
  and sadly , relativelly forgotten [ the human abstract ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwaso1vhgpy ), 
  i do n't think so . 
  he 's a big youtuber that likes metal and core , does n't matter if you like him or not . 
  found out about callenish circle thanks to him . 
  i realized that he used crossing the rubicon by tha only after i went through their discography . 
  so far the qtes are my only problem with the game . 
  like , in battles they are fine but get that shit the fuck outta face mid-cutscene, 
  i 'm behind current events , did she so something really stupid ? 
  in my current game i 'm going full toaster . 
  i could fall * right now *, 
  sounds like something a low int slunt would think, 
  i would n't really know , since i mute the tv and look a the plastic ladies if their music is on . 
  question about punpun and daredevil s2 . 
  does he come back in the second part of s2 ? 
  i really do n't give a shit about british ninja lady, 
  kinda relieved since i do n't have to watch it . 
  no amount of badass fight scenes will convince me if she 's still there, 
  ah , guess i 'll bite the bullet and keep the skip button handy . 
  it 's probably 3 days of heaven for nick, 
  ren mentioned that he felt the pull to the light and we saw what rey saw when she picked up the lightsaber . 
  so not a baseless theory . 
  these past few days showed me how cool doom is . 
  what a shame that his rivals are the fantastic 4, 
  would n't it be awesome to find 2 souls next to each other in an arena ? 
  a soul of a hero and a soul of a villain . 
  actual ** big poise ** for actual ** big bois **, 
  probably some symphonic nsbm from '95 that had one demo and their first and last ep 2 years later, 
  i love the the album ends with a fade to the beginning of it . 
  this trailer is / r/empiredidnothingwrong fap material and i love it,
