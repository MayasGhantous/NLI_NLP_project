  was that in the latest premium cum ? 
  it 's been bothering me , ca n't cum without it but i do n't remember it . 
  the story is still ongoing actually . 
  it 's vague but it 's still about low in old souls and in ether . 
  i can link a super good analysis, 
  edit : [ here 's the story of neverbloom , in the comments ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/deathcore/comments/37tqrh/can_anyone_explain_the_entire_concept_story_of/ ) and here 's [ when i called the dude back from the dead to analyze old souls , comments again . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/deathcore/comments/37tqrh/can_anyone_explain_the_entire_concept_story_of/ ), 
  take him away , boys . 
  i swear waifu2x is some kind of magic, 
  they did that to themselves, 
  it 's treason then . 
  i barely even play fighties and i have no idea who you are but i 'm all aboard the shit on v train, 
  oh , i do n't think so . 
  what an asshole , would n't even die, 
  happened to me one time , twice , at school . 
  almost banged me head on the desk, 
  * force close the doors *, 
  you underestimate the power of the lava ground, 
  i hope pele will back to finish that story about girls touching his head, 
  66 is the funniest number, 
  not in the dark souls lp . 
  he whistled a lot in his streams a few months ago , but i have n't watched the streams since . 
  you could try the waifu2x site . 
  the album cover should come out nice since it 's simple, 
  maybe everything is just horribly inefficient . 
  the unbidden truly are the unbidden, 
  the trophy had it a long time coming , honestly . 
  big boys for big boys, 
  pat : that thing , hand it over , your ginger soul, 
  band is underoath , dude is / u/shadowbrookmike, 
  forgot to put in title , x-post from / r/metalcore, 
  he did n't make us perfect , ( tits and dicks at the same time ) so fuck that guy . 
  they 're not uncommon in metalcore and post-hardcore . 
  even some of the heaviest bands use them . 
  [ make them suffer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nymgqd6ble ) uses the keyboard and female singing in contrast to the heavy guitars and monstrous voice of the vocalist to make a depressing atmosphere that mirrors the lyrics . 
  yes , yes , yes , something very fancy . 
  it 's pretty nice of them but i would n't say it 's badass . 
  badass would be attila brawling with the security guards because they were dicks to their fans, 
  remember the good old days when we could self-purge ? 
  i dunno about you but i play video games for fun , so i purge for fun . 
  you take that back, 
  it 's one of those albums that you just ca n't listen to one song . 
  [ loathe - the cold sun ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oupqtvdbli ) . 
  fun fact about the album : it seamlessly loops, 
  think of it this way , what if this is the thing they 're gon na be really good at ? 
  yeah , i guess in my mind the two events are just different categories of nice things, 
  i like to think it 's some sort of super placebo effect . 
  he believed it and it happened . 
  ironic , they could save other from sp - they could n't actually , because people got revenge spoiled, 
  just fuck aquaman on principle, 
  plauge one : a sexy animal cartoon story, 
  crazy talk would negate that as soon as pat realized, 
  i wan na command my vassal 's ships to get into a circle pit, 
  it 's from that one hot pepper episode, 
  life is a fuck, 
  am i crazy or did pat say that seath was going to die but then later he said that he ca n't die ? 
  is this the work of an enemy stando ? 
  no toilet roll pyramid, 
  i 'm pointing out the fact that he was wrong and later he was right . 
  but i understand the majority of ds lore and that seath is doing this shit because he 's not immortal, 
  god works in mysterious ways ? 
  i imagined just a giant glock, 
  kinda disappointed . 
  it 's great on it 's own but honestly to me this is the weakest wss album . 
  do n't have any real criticism other than how it feels, 
  reminds me of for honor orochis, 
  maybe they were uggos from the beginning , do n't need to poop on the elven babies to make orcs . 
  i do n't really know who those 2 are and i 'll probably never play p5 but even i know this is correct, 
  i always thought people were talking about lexx , that old sci fi show, 
  something more than just greeting them would be nice , a short dialogue perhaps . 
  [ in the book they ate shit even harder ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x2gb3xhnfc ), 
  so blackface ? 
  you know how alchemists have been trying to turn shit into gold ? 
  well , modders have been trying to turn video games into porn since the dawn of time . 
  currently , skyrim is the crown jewel, 
  n - no ... that 's not the meme, 
  xenomorphs should definitely be dangerous . 
  also clones like horatio from endless space, 
  there are more than one mod that do things when you run of a bar, 
  and when i clicked on the link all my tabs fuckin died, 
  headsets are not good enough . 
  melt me into a capsule and put me in an eternal dream and then connect that subconsciously to other capsules so there 's never stale content . 
  [ cum town ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvfaipo9p0 ) if you wan na listen to a bunch of shit, 
  it gets stupid . 
  10000 did n't make sense so i scaled it down, 
  one song was alright and i do n't even remember it, 
  oh that 's the dog ? 
  i did n't even know , just searched for bork busters and this came up, 
  this is a professional quality meme , holy shit, 
  tell us, 
  nobody does . 
  and even if they did , they 'd be wrong . 
  help a friendo here , who is sigma ? 
  first time i 've seen this guy, 
  come on , do n't insult satan like that , man, 
  [ look at him , he 's an actual badass ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcigputvfsa ), 
  or a name . 
  center axis relock : midnight hyperbirth, 
  i 'm from serbia and looking at that face is weird . 
  looks like a bunch of girls i know .
