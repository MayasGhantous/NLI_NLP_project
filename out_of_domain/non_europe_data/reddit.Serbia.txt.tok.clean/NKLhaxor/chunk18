  it is n't that linear , it depends on the map . 
  stelthable are bigger and there are lots more paths than the loud ones . 
  the objectives are really simple too and you get reminded all the time ^ ^ guys ^ ^ the ^ ^ thermal ^ ^ drill ^ ^ go ^ ^ get ^ ^ it, 
  and if you want hordes of cops , you can use goonmod . 
  other than texture , hud and script mods i doubt we will have new models and stuff like that since the engine is n't really modular .

  well you can unlock some pretty sweet ones if you 're lucky and/or work hard .
