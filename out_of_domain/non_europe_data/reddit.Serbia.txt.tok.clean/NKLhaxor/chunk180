  cthulhu turned into green mist and reformed right after the boat hit him , so that was n't even a victory . 
  let 's agree to disagree . 
  i find it hard to believe that cthulhu got damaged by a boat, 
  convert me into audio and paste this album over me when it comes out pls, 
  right , how could i forget ... that 's how old man henderson killed hastur, 
  wars have been waged before humans , so someone probably died at one point, 
  who knows , they might bamboozle us , and reverse it . 
  or even portray both sides as not great, 
  [ darke complex ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwxwrtx3_nk ) . 
  bassist is black , sings , screams and raps alongside the vocalist . 
  they also added another rapper in point oblivion , so it 's easy to get confused . 
  i hope this is the whole lp . 
  fumbling around evidence and swerving into concrete and traffic, 
  it 's the same really . 
  instead of yelling at robots they 're yelling at women now . 
  i feel like [ this ] ( http://cinemamind.tumblr.com/post/156238705921/cthulhu-spawn-by-cinemamind ) is kind of what he was going for at times , but you ca n't really put that into words, 
  this was n't a lol butthole post , more of a jab at a not so great protagonist, 
  it just looked like you called me a 10/yo and i explained why i posted what i posted . 
  you 're the one that sounds salty here , dude . 
  crowfirmed by vaa i watch the vido, 
  yeah , it 's really evident when you learn about his life and what was written when . 
  hp podcraft is great because of this , they dive in into his life and his writing . 
  miyazaki where is aldia , you goblin, 
  they could do some alter ego psychology stuff with that . 
  worked in batman arkham knight [ spoiler ] ( #s `` there 's a joker in batman 's mind and he 's there the whole game . 
  batman does n't acknowledge him at all ( which is kind of annoying but since he 's not real why would he , but still ... ) meanwhile joker just appears and talks about stuff and disappears when he 's out of the shot . '' ), 
  i was about to say that this is what hl3 guys must feel like , but at least dmc has writers and other people that work on actually developing video games . 
  so it 's super real to me, 
  no poise or powerstancing either . 
  i like to think that it means we 'd reject all sophisticated things that make us modern humans . 
  only our basic instincts would remain . 
  just killin ' and fuckin ' till the end of days . 
  no morality , just pure pleasure and a drive for more . 
  had something like this happen . 
  my charger is plugged in above my bed so one morning i got bonked on the nose . 
  i survived somehow, 
  i was about to tell you to become a metal and core hybreed but fir ? 
  it 's not worth it, 
  * unsubscribe from cat facts *, 
  that is amazing . 
  track suits . 
  yes , i 'm a slav, 
  out of all of their songs , this one is definitely my favorite . 
  `` just please do n't let me miss '' screams are what do it for me .

  a lot of j-metal bands ' english are so not english sounding that i too do n't even notice . 
  the japanese parts are great , like [ this one ] ( https://youtu.be/zirxgopwop8?t=3m9s ), 
  if tha came back with digital veil but on steroids i 'd shit myself, 
  while i do have a perfect slav squat technique i 'm not a gopnik . 
  i 've never been to a show either , not that there are any around here . 
  get a spine enlongening surgery, 
  you 're intolerant , that 's just who they are and a part of their culture .

  currents , make them suffer and vildhjarta . 
  then i can die, 
  the security cameras were n't great tho, 
  `` totalbiscuit slams british national painting gallery for `` appalling frame-rate '', 
  this is the best, 
  i like all of bmth 's stuff . 
  well , everything except the ep and the demo they did before cyb , but nobody really talks about those nor did i listen to them much . 
  cyb and tts are probably their weakest albums but i still love them . 
  i 'm also a connoisseur of the feels .

  i will make it yet, 
  crashing this ship . 
  with nobody left on the hoof, 
  the safe route was worth it for the starkiller base scene . 
  so many terrorists and threats to galactic peace snuffed out at once , brings a tear to my eye . 
  screech it, 
  he is in my behind !, 
  i 'll suck dink for twinblades so i can be cao pi . 
  too much lore, 
  it might be an ironic joak , which makes it ok, 
  i 'm imagining a matrix-esque spit dodge part, 
  probably my favorite predator line, 
  this is my favorite release this year so far . 
  i played non stop for weeks and it 's still great,
