  and a useful version of the dragon head, 
  where are the dicks tho ? 
  watch if the emperor had a text-to-speech device . 
  all i know about 40k comes from that and that one wiki page about space marine organs, 
  what did this guy actually do ?

  one of the biggest problems/features of core is that bands can sound so different but are still the same genre . 
  like , [ loathe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurhxjpfdvo ) is so nothing like [ attack attack ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdzt6yi3dw8 ) but crabcore and screamo is what people usually think of when they mention core . 
  i do n't know if i believe you but that sounds like a perfect combo, 
  i know but i 'm scared of the what did you play this week segment , so that 's why i 'm asking, 
  who ? 
  haku is a tarp ? 
  character just got better, 
  bad idea .

  [ girugamesh 's last album , ep and song are core ( rip ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb8w1whk3os ) . 
  nocturnal bloodlust , dir en grey , coldrain , crossfaith , maximum the hormone , fear and loathing in las vegas ( yep , same as the movie ) , the gazette, 
  you are already at full cock now, 
  it looks like you 're trying to leave the eu .

  [ yes ] [ no ], 
  his soul transferred once vita 's body died, 
  complete is the right word for it .
