  recetnly [ rodent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxn3so1n1vc ) is all the hype i need . 
  the rest of homecoming is lit too, 
  it 's not that new anymore . 
  lovecraftian erotica is an untapped genre, 
  we can just pirate the horns, 
  and tentacles do n't count since they 're not inherently lovecraftian . 
  if you wan na automate your shit with torrents and mal , use taiga . 
  you 'd have to change the rss for the torrents search because old nyaa torrents got fucked but that 's [ pretty simple ] ( https://github.com/erengy/taiga/issues/410 ), 
  the balls of god . 
  the source of all evil, 
  i do n't have a problem with cannibalism but i hate feet , so i 'll take one apple flavored horse cum , please . 
  ca n't check right now , but does this mean that the rest of part 5 has been translated and the text looks all neat and shit ? 
  in the future , we have no use for feet . 
  imagine if he killed the funko drone and then a swarm of funko drones appeared on the horizon, 
  really reminds me of a hannibal scene . 
  pretty similar , you have a dude that got kicked in the head by a horse so he 's not all there and his psychopath social worker that pinned his murders on the guy . 
  who else does n't remember murdered : soul suspect ? 
  lucky chloe seems like a bigger abomination than alisa and i do n't know much about tekken, 
  havid cagima, 
  played a few hours and i 'm really enjoying it . 
  the gunplay is n't cod levels of refined but it 's not the focus at all so that 's fine , really ( i 'm just glad i do n't have to run away from anything ) . 
  if you like atmosphere , music , crime and psychological fuckery , you should probably try it . 
  the main level is kind of a hub world i guess , and you can revisit previous levels to do stuff you missed or could n't do . 
  but i have n't tried to go back through the main hub , you travel through it and visit different levels from there . 
  if you wan na a tiny spoiler on how you travel : [ spoiler ] ( #s `` you use a vr type of headset and pictures to go to and revisit memories ( levels ) '' ), 
  the levels are spacious but not a lot of places to go other than doing what you 're supposed to . 
  ( do n't quote me on that one tho ), 
  lem me guess , you 're gon na up the taxes next, 
  [ the digital veil ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwaso1vhgpy ) by the human abstract starts with a slow one, 
  i only found out it was dead by looking at konami 's one mirrion troops thing and going to the wikipedia of the game and then i found kuf2 somewhere at the bottom . 
  looked like the hypest shit , shame it 's dead, 
  please do n't be some anniversary or some other kind of nothing content, 
  [ mfw tutorials are written right under your nose ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fuwrmek.png ), 
  kinda late to this thread but ... 
  i really like the rap parts especially in when i walk , the transition sounds really good imo . 
  is there anything from old gloom online ? 
  i get the impression that people do n't listen to new stuff here, 
  if you like the story i suggest you read [ this for neverbloom and old souls ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/deathcore/comments/37tqrh/can_anyone_explain_the_entire_concept_story_of/crq464y/ ) and then there 's one for [ ether ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/metalcore/comments/4oarrd/for_those_that_care_about_the_story_of_make_them/d4b5ip0/ ) . 
  hope we can summon him again for when world apart comes out . 
  [ bonus thread with more suggestions ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/metalcore/comments/51fegj/what_are_your_favorite_albums_with_a_story_and/ ) . 
  and to add on , [ loathe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurhxjpfdvo ) , a post apocalyptic story of a serial killer and a guy that gets killed by him . 
  plus some weird stuff about invaders . 
  and [ gloom in the corner ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfahysqhibu ) , jay goes on a possessed vengeful killing spree . 
  and in the new [ ep ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxn3so1n1vc ) his brother comes back from the war ( i think ), 
  maybe . 
  but sometimes good shit stays at 1 upvotes along with the most basic ass metalcore, 
  the worst thing about ps is how long it takes to start, 
  that 's horrific, 
  do n't even joke about it, 
  they crash onto yautja prime to shakedown the actual predators, 
  all good things must come to an end . 
  just like how happiness does n't last forever , sadness does n't either . 
  as rage is tearing apart a mountain with his fists , the baz pops out the peak shouting `` rage-chan ! '', 
  chemicals in your brain are just functions, 
  download the tv from the internet, 
  just 229 days left till the new preddie . 
  i can for sure remain sane till then, 
  `` wow ... 
  i need to commit suicide as soon as possible . '', 
  i read along with hp podcraft . 
  they started chronologically so not everything is great but you get to understand lovecraft himself and his stories better . 
  remember to thank yoko taro and his disciples every day, 
  probably not . 
  it 'd probably get stale by the time it arrives and unless you 're a qt trap it 's a % 100 no go . 
  i do n't believe . 
  you 'll have to excuse me , i got ta go genocide some ants and sleep, 
  ** best ** :, 
  loathe , currents and ocean grove . 
  ** biggest disappointments ** : while she sleeps and northlane . 
  ** gim me right now : ** make them suffer and vildhjarta ? 
  also new celldweller album incoming soon, 
  when you think about it , games are just functions . 
  i honestly tried tekken and i have no idea how to play . 
  and i 'm not new to fighties either , but i can barely pull of a combo . 
  it also seems like it 's mostly about juggling so , i dunno about that, 
  blackout glasses ? 
  the only other 3d fighter i played was doa5 and that was alright for a bit . 
  i could do combos but the functions in that game are just different boobies and some dudes , so 0 interest . 
  i mostly play whichever kof or sf is hot on fightcade, 
  the combo is way too urban for me . 
  i need pat to balance it out, 
  well , bots and clickfarms for the views . 
  the comments are pretty creepy tho, 
  i would laugh so hard if it turned out that all of them were in on it, 
  i 'm gon na torrent taken, 
  i think [ demoniac ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/70834/ ? ), 
  can get you something similar to this , if it 's not this . 
  hair looks like [ ks ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/70363/ ? 
  ) , might not be the hdt ( modded physics , meaning bouncy hair in this case ) version, 
  the best way to consume e3 is at home with a drink and a bingo card, 
  there 's only a demo on steam, 
  you know how people say that nu-core is a mistake ? 
  well , fellow degenerates , here 's some more but unironically :,
