  i want them to start doing fusions . 
  or rasca . 
  it 's kind of hypocritical . 
  i 'm completely fine when i 'm listening to murderers but i stay away from kiddy fiddlers . 
  shadowrun kinda counts . 
  orcs with cyber limbs , demons from the astral plane , magic storms , magic talisman store next to a drone workshop . 
  yeah ... 
  the only thing those 2 have in common is that they 're crimes, 
  i wonder if that 's why nina was saying jean instead of jin, 
  brainwashed is my fav wss album . 
  you are we is disappointing , i do n't even have it in my library, 
  hah , i looked at the cast and character names , did they actually whitewash this thing ? 
  light turner ? 
  come on , guy, 
  top kekeke wizard, 
  for a moment i got excited and thought the 2017 album was out . 
  but yes , strangers only is great, 
  i could n't give up this early . 
  i need something that directly feeds into my brain , not giant goggles . 
  if you survive and regret it , would you rather be buttface or have a scar on your leg or forearm ? 
  maybe not even hardware . 
  just turn me into quantum brain dust and mix me with other people 's quantum brain dust, 
  take a look at some of the friendcast preview videos , it 'll help . 
  or you 'll just go `` wait , that guy 's voice face is * this guy 's * face face ? '', 
  [ darkest hour ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hycqibvl880 ), 
  how am i not surprised to find one of us secret diamond club members here ? 
  most shooters are frail boys, 
  jaws . 
  unhinged . 
  150 degrees . 
  the monkey is just chilling on a tree . 
  what 's that noise ? 
  it 's a helicopter and kuze is hanging on . 
  shirtless with camo pants and he 's holding an m60 in the other hand, 
  yes . 
  are you gon na reload your clothes or go again in the same ones ? 
  - ^ ^ shepard !, 
  ^ shepard !, 
  shepard !, 
  wake up !, 
  i had a terrible nightmare !, 
  - is it the reapers again !? 
  - it was in another galaxy , it 's fine , it does n't matter . 
  goku can fly . 
  superman can fly . 
  thor can fly . 
  go ahead and try them out . 
  i just want more last blade, 
  is that just not predator ? 
  [ this is all the 40k lore i need ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcyrtcgkyru ) plus it has the actual pillar men it, 
  exactly . 
  i for sure did n't go to www.reddit.com/u/nigger, 
  i 'm sorry but the word was mocking me, 
  there were like 3 bottles of ketchup in the fridge and not a drop of mayonez . 
  made me so mad , i had to eat my french fries unaided, 
  check out / r/twobestfriendsplay . 
  and i 'd say that l.a. noire is one of their top tier lps, 
  oh , fuck that 's depressing . 
  your character is really customizable and the fuckin ' descriptions take your body parts into account . 
  if you have 2 pairs of boobs , a snake tail , a cluster of dicks , horns etc. 
  it 's probably gon na mention it in the scene, 
  can someone explain why this game is so popular ? 
  other than the nostalgic art style , i do n't get it . 
  that 's the life of many porn artists . 
  you draw people 's weird sex things, 
  skyrim belongs to the nords !, 
  thought this was gon na be a compilation of will sweating profusely, 
  it 's the cover of the album . 
  it 's literally just a dick, 
  i dunno man , this was years ago . 
  he might 've eaten some after i closed the tab . 
  who knows if he ever stopped ? 
  [ vildhjarta - masstaden ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3ib8agrgde ) , whole album is connected . 
  [ loathe - the cold sun ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurhxjpfdvo ) all tracks lead into each other and actually * loops perfectly * . 
  i might be a 19yo baby but i did see those old cartoons when i was a kid, 
  beware of irony, 
  he looked indifferent . 
  the ceo part was the best part of wp, 
  i mean , yeah he 's a black dude but at least his character name is intact . 
  well , part of it , l 's actual name is probably gon na be western too, 
  my cousin was terrified of the game so he gave it to me . 
  i laughed it off then later i got too spooped as well , never played it again . 
  [ the predator mod is actually pretty doog ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24543/ ? ), 
  singularity is kinda like bioshock but the most horror it gets is in the first real level but it 's not even that spooky . 
  cod black ops has a pretty entertaining story, 
  but [ rogue warrior ] ( https://youtu.be/e7vsoej9tmw?t=8m18s ) is probably the best fps story out there, 
  `` i hope you 're backing up your data ... 
  someone is backing it up . 
  and it ai n't you . '', 
  - charls carrol , street prophet, 
  woolie , knight of thorns, 
  `` da2 reused dunjins '', 
  remember how mass effect did that too ? 
  maybe the operators are just rping as the frames, 
  but that 's work, 
  the dlc * should * be important when you carry your save over to dai but it 's really not, 
  you can do this with smooth video project . 
  the animation is still the same , but the whole vid is moving at 60fps, 
  the more injuries there are the more right you are , usually, 
  it 's really good and it holds up .
