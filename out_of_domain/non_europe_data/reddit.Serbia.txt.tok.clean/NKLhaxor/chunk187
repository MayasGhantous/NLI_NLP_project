  `` grrr , ugh ugh ugh , serious crap ! '', 
  alex jones ' rage art voice line, 
  ^ i ^ like ^ your ^ comments, 
  jin is way too sasukeish . 
  kazuya is the patrician choice, 
  phelps and akuma cancel each other out, 
  no kidding . 
  my hdd has been fucking off ever since i installed win10 . 
  people usually say it 's the hdd failing but no , friend . 
  it 's their shitty services and drivers that got overwritten that lock it up . 
  it probably stockholmed me into liking it, 
  did the zaibatsu do something with gowcaizer ? 
  i remember seeing a video of woolie smacking bennet with a pool cue ( in a totally real way , just like how vaas ' voice actor fought adam jensen 's voice actor ) , think it had something to do with it, 
  does n't really look like it 's gon na be a tycoon type of game . 
  more like one of those hectic games where you 're the worker and you got ta keep up with the demands,

  not really what you 're asking for but try [ rotting christ ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojbqplkbbv8 ), 
  one of the guitarboys left , dunno about the others, 
  the stupid thing here is how the dodge works with the keyboard . 
  i 've got about a hundred keys and dodge ai n't one, 
  that 's not an excuse tho . 
  if you 're putting your game on pc do it right . 
  besides , it 's not an overhaul of the entire control scheme , it 's one thing, 
  i do n't take orders from you , friend . 
  they got swallowed by a black hole . 
  it 's been 4 years since the ep and the [ heartsmear teaser ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-fbgqqdqg4 ) is n't enough to bring all the thallboys out of their holes . 
  i also had a vildhjarta flair for about 2 years before i switched to loathe . 
  [ no npc greetings ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/746/ ? ), 
  is one of them, 
  `` the greatest feeling you can get from a gun or the most satisfying feeling you can get from the gun is the recoil . 
  let 's say you pull the trigger , bullets are coming out and the gun is shaking and that 's what we call the recoil . 
  your barrel gets really hot like your gun is going to explode any minute and its really hot and its like someone is blow torching your barrel and it just blows up and it feels different , it feels fantastic . 
  it 's as satisfying to me as cumming is , you know , as in having sex with a woman and cumming . 
  so can you believe how much i am in heaven ? 
  i am like getting the feeling of cumming behind the trigger ; i 'm getting the feeling of cumming at home ; i 'm getting the feeling of cumming backstage ; when i pull the trigger , when i open up in front of 5000 criminals i get the same feeling , so i am cumming day and night . 
  it 's terrific , right ? 
  so you know , i am in heaven and they 're in hell . '', 
  define * use *, 
  too bad these guys got to do it , now we 'll have to wait for years for another thing since it 'd be too awkward to do it again . 
  for a second i read that as kiryu and imagined him saying that as he stared at the sky, 
  always choose ass . 
  without the foundation , everything crumbles . 
  i finished school so i would n't have to learn anything anymore, 
  it always looked like a fun game to bet on, 
  there 's a gaius in bro team pill 's twitch chat , he sounds like the gayest person in there, 
  i like to pretend the ants are my prisoners and that soap and water are acid and then i would kill them, 
  they answer to the high crimarch , nugget, 
  i tried it once . 
  why would anyone make that ? 
  i bet the same people who put pineapple on pizza came up with it, 
  the squid girl is alright tho , p good r34, 
  edit : you guys are fucked up, 
  i go commando . 
  just pants and face paint, 
  having an rpg sesh with my internet friends . 
  satan is way cooler than jesus btw, 
  the disgusting thing came !, 
  imagine if quantum break did that , that 'd be cool, 
  you can see his racism peak around that time . 
  that 's when he wrote the horror at red hook, 
  he looks like he 's cumming real hard, 
  i would probably run around and kill everyone in humiliating ways and reload the save, 
  ** screaming ** at the moving * a i r *, 
  i want cheats to come back . 
  remember how in gta you could just cheat like a madman from the moment you got to control your character ? 
  it 's kind of cynical but also kind of true that dlcs mostly replaced them, 
  what are some good carnage comics ? 
  i do n't really read comics , mostly animu and manger but symbiotes are really cool, 
  blind daredevil jokes are just the best, 
  it 's pretty fun if you want to live out your child fantasy of being the unbeatable new wrestler, 
  it 's more of a thriller than horror . 
  also no melee combat , at least i never ran out of ammo so i do n't know but even then , combat is not the point at all . 
  it 's about uncovering the mystery of what happened and how the characters are connected . 
  even when the boss was a dick to lee , i thanked him . 
  that made my teeth tingle, 
  that looks like it 's gon na be neat, 
  nothing is confirmed but people have been teasing it and it 's far from impossible, 
  i 'm really starting to hate these comment bots, 
  carnage called man-wolf a furry , ok thanks for this, 
  erotica !, 
  exactly . 
  so many cool characters but i 'd have to rely on other idiots to play instead of being the only idiot playing against a single opponent . 
  this is the kind of content we need, 
  wrong dang sub,

  this guy was genuinely excited for his game at e3 , shame it shit the bed like this,

  literal dream games, 
  after swtor , i dunno about mmo-ing rpgs anymore, 
  that 's the power of his stand . 
  he uses convenient newspapers to solve crimes, 
  holmes ' murder castle got nothing on castle superbeast, 
  just do n't call that berserk and it would be cool, 
  dmc3 . 
  except you get taught a lesson , then nobody gets taught and then you deliver the final lesson, 
  i got really hyped when i learned that they will be doing new vs movies after i watched kong . 
  then i remembered shin gojira is n't gon na be fighting kong .
