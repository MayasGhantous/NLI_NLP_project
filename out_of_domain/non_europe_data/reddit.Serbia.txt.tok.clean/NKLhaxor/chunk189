  they went out with a bang, 
  what would you do about #tonytigergate ? 
  the pus of man, 
  short hair wins by default . 
  now , let 's not get confused here . 
  if anyone 's anyone , you 're me . 
  [ is this alright ? 
  ] ( https://clips.twitch.tv/oneroussmallcarrotsaltbae ), 
  he 's going trans but obviously he 's woke and making fun of the whole thing, 
  i see you 're some sort of japanese music connoisseur . 
  got a list of bands that do only japanese lyrics ? 
  make it short and we got a deal, 
  i love seeing woolie drive straight into walls but being a bad cop rustles me, 
  double dicks ? 
  now there 's a trope i 've not seen in a long , long time . 
  a long time . 
  is there a live video of crossfaith * not * being energetic as fuck ? 
  having trouble imagining that, 
  if only the player character tried to stab them in the head or throat, 
  are they just fucking with people at this point ? 
  you can also revert to previous version , you know , ** when it was n't fucked up **, 
  i thought `` abigal is retarded '' was just a meme, 
  it 's rugal b. 
  he 's probably [ ** the ** snk boss ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/snkboss/snkplaymore ), 
  there 's an snk super move flash and his guts instantly fill with shit, 
  yeah , he 's the most relevant right now . 
  but geese 's boss cpu was also a monster, 
  this would for sure be a 20 minute bathroom fight episode, 
  you 're going to prison for having a dirty ass dick, 
  shermie is also fucking dead . 
  i do n't think they know what they 're doing, 
  when 's eugenics, 
  if i was a nazi mod i would conquer / r/melodichardcore and merge it with us, 
  one of my all time favorites . 
  like that one guy said , it 's one of the most `` complete '' albums out there, 
  it was a joak . 
  i do n't want people yelling at me and my opinions, 
  hey , you guys are great and at least you have this place in control , other than the whole genre deal . 
  i go to / r/kappa a lot and the mods there are the laughing stock along with capcom, 
  edit : i wonder if they got a mention notification . 
  fix the css , you maniacs, 
  we are born of the cum , made men by the cum , undone by the cum, 
  `` let him of the h ** ^ oo ** k '', 
  hmm ... ** hmmm ** ... 
  [ vildhjarta ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3ib8agrgde ) are p djenty, 
  my other recommendation is to browse bandcamp under djent and thall tags . 
  there 's some neat stuff there, 
  it 's a copypasta , my dude . 
  are jews allowed in here now ? 
  if you were to actually think about it , these mods are just functions . 
  oh yeah , i even upvoted that . 
  embarrassing, 
  [ blessthefall - hollow bodies ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sddn4kh65ma ) is pretty hype, 
  and [ loathe - east of eden ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oupqtvdbli ) is pretty, 
  there should n't * be any tales * of what goes on here . 
  we should deal with the rats quickly and quietly . 
  i say , let him lash out on the miscreants in the dungeon . 
  [ oh wow , you were n't kidding ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oavsvi9l-m ) . 
  it 's really similar, 
  [ zarono 's is my favorite ] ( https://archive.org/details/zarononecronomiconbookno1 ), 
  edit : retard . 
  for 50 coins we should get a whole damn nest of them !, 
  what are we to do with a single viper ? 
  very well , here 's a hundred . 
  you know what they say , you can always make more money , you ca n't ... get your head back after you lose it . 
  well , that 's fine . 
  everyone knows about the bounty on your head now too . 
  that 's a thicc bird, 
  what is this fantasy land you keep going on about ? 
  as long as they keep the dick , otherwise what 's the point ? 
  [ look up the most expensive steam accounts ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bmse3m7kmza/vhlva7cxxqi/aaaaaaaacsw/z0etbo2lo4u/s1600/rich%2baccount%2bsteam%2b4.png ), 
  that was insane, 
  i 've never seen friendly officers do anything worthwhile . 
  they got ta fix that shit, 
  this sounds cool enough to not be in the game, 
  since abs are top tier you almost killed me, 
  what would you do if you woke up in maikky 's skin ? 
  how would that work ? 
  i dunno about you but i like dw because of the cool characters and their cool moves . 
  nice video / u/broteampill . 
  you 're also nice, 
  [ let 's beyblade !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsolt-q89f0 ), 
  welcome to hell !, 
  welcome to hell !, 
  but seriously , check out the [ youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/milliondollarextreme ) link in the sidebar if you 're up for some ironic laughs, 
  you are officially mde 's coolest mom, 
  [ they ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5plkzrqvgq ) [ did ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylg_ailhe6i ) [ those ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbab3opirsa ) too, 
  he 's got those gay homochromic eyes, 
  we need to go beyond flesh . 
  hypnosis , dreams and all that mind shit , my dude . 
  right , * right ? 
  i was more asking the ether or wherever they are and hoping for a confirmation , but yes they 're the best . 
  every month i listen to [ heartsmear ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-fbgqqdqg4 ) and scrub the internet for news, 
  hlb is like vildhjarta 's darker cousin . 
  i like them but i like vildhjarta more because of the midrange vocalist and the lighter dark sound, 
  well , they 're pretty good bands and they released new albums recently . 
  and since you 're asking for good new stuff , i 'll shill for [ loathe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oupqtvdbli ), 
  hah , i love that you kept that part in, 
  fun fact , the last song ends with the same sound the first song begins with , so the album loops perfectly,
