  they do n't scream but they have similar haunting guitars and electronics, 
  haikus make me mad . 
  please , poop on your hand and eat it if you make haikus in english . 
  i finished pillars of eternity recently . 
  i tried it like 4 times and hated it every time . 
  this time i got into it and liked it . 
  then i finished the game and the ending was shit . 
  what a shitty game , i was right to hate it, 
  i do n't usually listen to crushing heavy stuff but this is some fine shit, 
  not exactly what you asked but ... 
  the song is great overall but i ca n't help but feel let down at the end , like there was supposed to be an explosion at the end and it just fades out, 
  [ the plot in you - hole in the wall ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmfybbnn_hq ), 
  well congratulations , you 've got yourself surprised . 
  forcesome, 
  you 're the bad guy from the start , there 's way less insignificant `` carefully crafted lore '' and the ending was better even if it did n't really have one, 
  you should post this to / r/perfectloops, 
  for some reason i think our nick and charls would be a real good combo . 
  [ do you like it ? 
  [ popo zao ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nr4zhs-vttw ),

  report yourself to the nearest imperial hole for a checkup once you 're an adult . 
  i do n't know enough about younglings to arrest them, 
  never been to any show . 
  not that there are any here, 
  sleep deprivation and tap water . 
  that 's how you get high, 
  been reading confessions of a heretic . 
  nergal is a hell of a guy . 
  and the tdwp incident was pretty cool, 
  ca n't wait for the rematch against nightmare brett, 
  satanism is mostly about your own freedom and not being a dick to others but if someone is a dick to you , `` destroy them '' . 
  at least , that 's what i remember from when i read what it was actually about . 
  but i guess the political bullshit infected even them, 
  her finger is exactly where she wants it, 
  i 'm really not an expert but ancap seems like politics and business stuff while satanism is a lifestyle where humans are essentially animals in an amoral universe . 
  they also do `` magic '' which , i do n't really get . 
  they do n't believe in the literal devil but in the ideals . 
  but then they do magic ? 
  i think it 's just hypnosis and other psychology stuff but they call it magic, 
  was that the first core dab ? 
  vildhjarta - thousands of evils,

  [ i think it 's tied to the story too . 
  ] ( http://www.rickardwestman.com/masstaden_digipak_rickardwestman.jpg ) the fox with the dagger is the lone deranger and the fat hamster thing with the book is the golden monk . 
  or it 's the other way around . 
  either way , it 's rad, 
  he sounds like an old chair, 
  guess what , i 'm doubling down on mustaches . 
  we 're doing triple mustaches , triple staches . 
  tr-tr-tr-tr triple staches !,

  i dunno , that was n't bad it was ... lukewarm ? 
  jesus coming back and not doing anything would be the funniest thing . 
  from what i heard from a guy on a podcast he always had a friend with him , like it was primarily a co-op game . 
  is going solo viable ? 
  somebody once said that adam once said that he was self conscious of his laugh so he changed it to croaking like a retard, 
  i was more picturing crippling depression and lots of cocaine, 
  now , i do n't know a whole lot about this personer thinger , but she seems like a nice lady, 
  listen to the old episodes . 
  it was still croaking , but it was n't so fucking awful, 
  do n't delete everything , that 's a bad move . 
  there 's a couple of bitch modders in the skyrim modding scene that removed all of their stuff because a somebody complained a bit and that shit pisses everyone off . 
  find a better admin if you do n't trust that guy . 
  and then mostly everyone is happy , except the ones that are n't . 
  but at least you do n't go out as a bitch that deleted everything . 
  that would badly affect those that do n't care about drama and just want mods, 
  why 's the noas got ta do that tho,

  not really a fan but [ legend of the astral hammer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvs2givbegk ) has one of my favorite starts in music . 
  has anyone else caught themselves doing the triangle smile subconsciously ? 
  you should n't be on reddit while working either way, 
  every time my dimension is mentioned i get reminded of a serbian film . 
  the rating is appropriate to say the least, 
  mde is just a re branded mk ultra,

  for what it 's worth , [ i made a thread asking the same question ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/metalcore/comments/6uq1ma/can_anyone_recognize_this_song/ ) and those usually get answered .
