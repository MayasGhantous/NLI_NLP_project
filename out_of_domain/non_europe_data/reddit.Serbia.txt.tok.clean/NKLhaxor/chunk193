  i 'm playing as the boltons during the century of blood and i flayed the whole north ( now renamed to `` the dreadlands '' ) . 
  kidnapped a targaryen whore , made a targ/bolton kid and got a dragon . 
  a bolton dragonrider . 
  that 's really fucked now that i think about it . 
  at one point he 's gon na be a pair of eyebrows on a cliff, 
  i admit . 
  cia was one of the main reasons i started watching got . 
  gave me some young arnie vibes, 
  what do you mean ? 
  because i 'm imagining sam doing the blegh and josh doing egh a couple of times after that, 
  i only saw the first announcement and even that i forgot about, 
  one guy was throwing a basketball at me just before class . 
  i threw a chair at him when the teacher came in . 
  never got bothered again . 
  \\  feelsgoodman, 
  eat shit, 
  pod racers , in an open field ned, 
  hah , what a [ ** f o o l ** ] ( / a ), 
  necro then ? 
  the agot mod for ck2 is probably the closest things to a real got game right now . 
  ever wanted to see the bolton dragon riders rule the north ? 
  fuck no ? 
  well , you can !, 
  lady : `` this young girl will do fine . '', 
  meryn fucking trant : `` no , she wo n't . '', 
  * whips out a child *, 
  lady : `` this younger girl * will * do fine . '', 
  meryn fucking trant : '' * no * , she wo n't ! '', 
  next level cum town, 
  they 're gon na have a big fat greek wedding, 
  [ loathe - it 's yours ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurhxjpfdvo ), 
  i fell in love when the moment it says and shows `` loathe '' and sound started hitting me . 
  fucking raw and post apocalyptic, 
  is that supposed to be the king in yellow ? 
  he was n't even really a villain . 
  maybe from our point since he was shitting on our not morally great characters but he was really just a humble servant of the gods , nothing more to it . 
  simple but complex in a way, 
  hogates affirmatively, 
  gods we were tendz, 
  what 's his character like ? 
  and is the show good ( i assume it is , but i wan na know what i 'm in for ) ? 
  he did n't sneak so good, 
  rhymes with reek, 
  stop, 
  ser ilyn , bring me the pyre stretcher !, 
  so what 's the deal with benjen in the books ? 
  i legit forgot about this character, 
  no [ aleister black ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4csz3vsugso ) ? 
  shame, 
  i miss that horrible electronic screech when you got a message, 
  i just cheat through the combat because i ca n't stand it . 
  and i do n't even look at the models because of the same reason , i 'd rather imagine what i want regardless of what my character has equipped, 
  well , i do actually . 
  stars without number with a group on discord . 
  story is n't really crafted , it 's more just chaotic bullshit but it 's been better than video games lately . 
  and it helps that our gm does n't restrict us , meaning anything goes usually . 
  wan na smash 80 cryo pods with your mech for no reason ? 
  well , a fellow player did it and i gave my warrior a giant centipede tail, 
  well , i meant what makes him so cool that everybody got really excited when he came back as a dead guy, 
  holy fuck . 
  he * is * just channeling vergil . 
  stabs him , drives it in deeper and slicks the hair back . 
  ds2 and mk9 ... man . 
  i did n't have a good pc back then and the all deaths/fatalities videos were super rad, 
  i wish i was jaiden smith anime rich, 
  mods deleting their accounts are always a good ol' time, 
  get these thots away from me ,, 
  gim me some of that sima shi, 
  what if we kill all those that say that traps are gay ? 
  are they still gay ? 
  how do we solve this conundrum ? 
  shit i stunk back then, 
  do n't let this man distract you from the fact that in 298 al , jaime lannister threw brandon stark off a winterfell tower , and plummeted 16 ft to the ground . 
  add elliot rodger 's manifesto , it 's some good ass comedy, 
  at least we got the boobies gif, 
  kinda looks like bran 's nose, 
  the night king is crashing that plane , with no survivors, 
  cash in on that monster fighting hype, 
  either conquering or a literal baby man horse fucking the earth, 
  the blades are a couple of cunts, 
  tony stark was able to build this on an open field , ned, 
  does n't sound that bad . 
  a free footjob and there 's probably nobody there , since it 's all dead people . 
  james is leading by a few points too . 
  american gods actually did the whole scale thing and it was pretty neat . 
  for you . 
  if you 're looking for more evil sounding stuff , i 'd recommend [ get the shot ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxgd3vkt7ky ), 
  a lion does n't concern itself with the opinion of the internet . 
  watch us become / r/squaredcircle begging for a heel turn where it does n't even make sense, 
  he did n't fly so good !, 
  well , people were weird dudes hundreds of years ago too , so, 
  no , bran . 
  go find sansa . 
  i know this is how it 's probably supposed to be like but it 's kinda lazy . 
  why not a dragon wolf hybreed oc ? 
  how do we add a lannister to the baby mix ? 
  it 's the number sequence from contact . 
  apparently it 's the secret order in which to listen to worlds apart . 
  just like old souls is supposed to be listened to in reverse to get the story,
