  in case somebody does n't know ... 
  in dmc vergil * shoots * a baby right out of a demon mom 's belly . 
  and from the look on his face , he got a huge boner, 
  #the whore is the night king ned, 
  theon : come on , let 's go get a drink, 
  did s7 feel like a marvel movie to anyone else ? 
  just did n't feel like the past season, 
  the old episode with dickfield and the chinese guy with the turtle is one of the classics, 
  villain appears . 
  characters interact . 
  whole lot of cgi . 
  villain uses doomsday weapon to some extent and nyc gets its annual ass fucking . 
  villain is defeated . 
  oh shit , thanos ... 
  do n't get me wrong , i like those movies , but they get really samey . 
  would hate to see got with that formula . 
  i love huge green explosions but only when there 's a mastermind plot behind it . 
  did you see x-men apocalypse ? 
  you see , i think that terrible . 
  just two actors spewing cgi particles at each other, 
  i have to keep my power levels hidden so i can fit in, 
  imagine if one of the corpses dropped tmp ammo, 
  now imagine if isaac was still a silent protagoniss and you could shoot her . 
  that 'd be pretty cool in a fucked up way, 
  as far as i can see he only really spends money on videos and whiskey, 
  if you keep saying it in the bathroom enough it even loses its strength, 
  [ \\  implying ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvfaipo9p0 ) [ it 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xylj2ghkzoi ) [ not ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3y2dsk__s ) [ good ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9vuvjss_fc ), 
  it has ... the * rarest * fucking pepe you 've ever fuckin ' seen, 
  this is actually becoming 4chan comic level, 
  in which story do they appear ? 
  i remember a mythos dump in one of the stories with them, 
  of course, 
  in the newest episode stav 's not there . 
  so nick made a stav soundboard, 
  happening to me too . 
  my hdd goes to % 100 and stays there for a while and everything is frozen . 
  you can try to put your pc to sleep and wake it up right away . 
  not a fix but it unfreezes it faster than a full reboot, 
  i mean , if you 're a nazi or wish you were born in the past you 'll like paradox 's grand strategies . 
  hearts of iron or crusader kings . 
  you ca n't play it with a little googoo bird brain tho, 
  i like how they were scared of little ghouls , just like how humans freak out when they see vermin, 
  he is talking about cut/paste not copy/paste . 
  well , there 's no rush in ckii or hoi4 . 
  you can pause and plan out your shit as much as you want . 
  at the beginning it will look like a whole lot of nothing but soon enough you 'll be flaying traitors and fucking your daughter . 
  i 'm talking mainly about ckii . 
  it 's a slow dynasty simulator and hoi4 is a wwii what if simulator, 
  oh , it 's like rapehorse but actually happening . 
  why would someone shoot a man before throwing him out of a plane ? 
  man , i really do n't like this game . 
  feels really weird and ... plastic ? 
  i 'd rather play remember me or for honor, 
  apologize . 
  we should start one where we listen to cumtown and pretend like we 're there, 
  i 'm really starting to hate this artsytle . 
  like bro team pill once said `` we do n't make textures , we just make colors . '', 
  while he was playing gigantic or whatever that game was, 
  really , it mostly depends on the surrounding area . 
  if the girl has a enis then it 's not gay . 
  if it 's a guy enis then it 's gayo, 
   killdozer, 
  they should make a movie out of that . 
  just like rampage , but with a armored bulldozer, 
  so it 's fine ? 
  man , after listening to slipknot a bit , aa 's from death to destiny reminds me of slipknot 's gray chapter . 
  [ loathe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurhxjpfdvo ) are my new favorite . 
  i wish it was still mostly about the metal and hardcore scene , do n't really care for more of politics, 
  [ holy fuck , it 's a spitting image ] ( http://metro.co.uk/2017/09/08/plastic-surgery-addict-left-with-permanent-erection-after-nose-job-6912412/0 ), 
  yeah , i 'm mostly into metalcore now . 
  none of that emo crabcore shit tho, 
  he studied the blade . 
  and showed up at your door . 
  doing it ironically is still doing it tho, 
  pat is is basically bane to them, 
  one of the recent eve wars was * fought over anime *, 
  somebody 's got ta take care of the trash tho . 
  for reference , [ this is what i like ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oupqtvdbli ), 
  a young boy with a master plan might be really fun to watch, 
  none of this would 've happened with the joff on the throne, 
  [ it 's yours ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurhxjpfdvo ), 
  so ... the story is quite different than what i like to interpret this song as but if you think like i do , then this song is telling you to ** `` just do it !, 
  want something ? 
  take it . 
  got a problem ? 
  solve it . 
  it 's a very greedy and selfish song, 
  23 minutes in . 
  has n't mentioned it yet, 
  this is for blind folk like me, 
  they 've finally acknowledged the game stuttering . 
  if they do n't fucking fix it i 'm going back, 
  needs a big ol horse doing, 
  do n't do it guys !, 
  it 's a trick , i fell on my butt, 
  mortality is pretty shit tbh, 
  `` nigga , you * crazy . 
  - cj , gta san andreas, 
  `` chaos is a ladder . '', 
  `` no one cared who i was until i put on the mask . '',
