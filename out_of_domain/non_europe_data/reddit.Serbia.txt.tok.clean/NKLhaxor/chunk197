  * euro hand five *, 
  people called him a psycho for doing it and said it would make it easier for sjdubs to hunt down specific things nick said . 
  like , who gives a shit what some twitter bitches say, 
  and only dw8e was on pc . 
  really go my cranking handle spinning when i saw samurai warriors 4 empires with all the cool new custom character flavor, 
  destroy them , ofc, 
  one time stav called him out on it . 
  `` wait , hold on . 
  why are we instantly agreeing with what he 's saying ? 
  nick does n't know what the fuck he 's talking about [ stav laugh ] '',

  i bet there 's a picture of ash on his knees , pants down and holding pikachu down looking mortified when somebody sees him, 
  he 's funding his mass shooting campaign , mark my words, 
  i understand , but i do n't get it, 
  virgin stand user : uses stand because he is too weak . 
  stand ca n't even fight . 
  does n't even use it for personal gain, 
  chad hamon user : has a stand with no weaknesses but he does n't even need it . 
  uses hamon every waking moment . 
  men find him menacing and women are drawn to him so he has no personal need for anything . 
  my aoty and new favorite band . 
  sorry vildhjarta , you did n't thall soon enough, 
  i remember seeing intimate alien a couple of times on the front page . 
  most of the other songs on that album are n't metalcore tho , so that might be a reason, 
  reek rhymes with freak, 
  too dead to be alive . 
  too smart to be a zambambo, 
  tidbits about diy, 
  go listen to another girl episode, 
  gods what a stupid hat .

  the fire rises, 
  placebo effect but it does n't actually do anything, 
  had a dream with 8bit music before . 
  i went outside and the landscape was like ... all mixed up colors like when you see gas rainbow on the road and there was lightning and geysers . 
  and [ something like wizard of wor 's ost ] ( https://youtu.be/xqnadictlk0?t=1m16s ) was playing, 
  + / u/user _ simulator / u/nklhaxor,

  you basically recreated the plot of dead space . 
  a weird signal is turning people into monsters or fox fucks, 
  you should check out the ds2 death compilation , it 's real good, 
  i find it really weird how you didnt play it yet , you have sims going on , why not add cuntus homo-erectus-refridgeus ? 
  or should i call it a nightmare ? 
  i remember beating up his tall sack of shit brother , sliding on the road and flying away and landing in the middle of bumfuck nowhere , fighting greasy steve but every time i hit steve my arm got stuck in his body ... also i once got super big and i was shooting at some additional thugs who were mobbing my foot ? ... 
  did they play it ? 
  did i miss it ? 
  i guess it 's just gon na be a not played steam game statistic .

  my headphones , youtube and system volumes are on max , and still it sounds like it 's on 50 % or something .

  1st question . 
  will you be able to be a parasite , like in alien and burst out of chests or maybe heads ? 
  2nd question . 
  the voices . 
  will we be able to change them up , and i 'm not just talking about pitching them up or down . 
  maybe some robotic sound or predator clicking ? 
  3rd question . 
  weapons of mass destruction ? 
  the planet buster from spore is lame , maybe a. . . freeze bomb to bring the ice age !, 
  or just poison fart gas i dunno ...
