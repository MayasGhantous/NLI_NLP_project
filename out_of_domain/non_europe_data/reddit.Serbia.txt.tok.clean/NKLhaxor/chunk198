  4th question . 
  wounds , blood , dismemberment etc. 
  yeah i love murdering things , but with no blood it 's not fun for me and it 's realistic . 
  i know that it did n't in dao and da2 . 
  now , i love bloody games , but the blood on the characters after battles was a bit ridiculous ... they had blood on their boots , butt , back , teeth , eyes . 
  like they got sprayed with blood from every possible angle . 
  i 'm thinking of doing one , difficulty does n't matter . 
  cuz , you know ... it 's a fighting game and new . 
  and an anime . 
  it 's pretty hype, 
  i 've tried both the us and eu . 
  both tell me to login through website , nothing works, 
  who was the guy ? 
  why did woolie kill that guy ? 
  when did this happen ? 
  what sick move did woolie use to kill that guy ? 
  and ... how many pies ? 
  mostly because i like killing stuff , being a jerk and being evil . 
  only things that matter are kenny , his family , his boat and clem/lee . 
  go ahead , nail me to a cross , but i 'm gon na be spitting salt licks at ya . 
  kenny master race . 
  like in / r/cyberpunk . 
  they have a pretty dark style so it does n't need night mode . 
  but i do n't wan na keep turning nm on and off every time i visit a different / r /, 
  what this guy said, 
  my pc running this game in borderless and 1080p is like pouring jam on the cpu , will there be more options ? 
  i mean , those statues are children . 
  children are horrible . 
  and they 're everywhere , lookin ' at you . 
  the only mention of vampires is in a codex entry about demonic possession . 
  just saw code geass and i need something where the protagonist is an antihero or even evil ( evil is * super * fine , just no good guys pls , i 'm gon na be sick ) . 
  i saw black lagoon . 
  also , psycho pass seen 1st ep ... uhh i do n't think i like the girl character , so does she get any better ( she seems a bit weak and `` squishy '' ... not enough badassery , just crying ) . 
  ** edit ** ok so , i 've got all of those on my list . 
  i 'll start by continuing psycho pass . 
  so , i was in the city at , like 5pm . 
  the bus goes at 7 30pm , that was strange . 
  what the hell am i doing here ? 
  i look at my hand , * am i dreaming ? * . 
  i started seeing static and i heard loud distorted noises . 
  tried to focus , but i faded out of the dream . 
  did n't even have the chance to call in an asteroid like last time . 
  so how do i * stabilize * the dream ? 
  i think i saw somewhere that you should umm spin around , but then my real body moved . 
  after i realized it was a dream i could n't move my legs , so is there anything i could do with my arms ? 
  it 's like some girl killing demons , with a pink staff/cross with ribbons and stuff ? 
  the demons do n't look like anything special , they kind of look like gengar or haunter in human shape . 
  i doubt i will watch it ( if we ever find what it is ) , just wan na know what it was . 
  edit : i think he saw me typing it yesterday . 
  he was giving me weird looks . 
  did anyone try it ? 
  does it screw shit up ? 
  there gon !, 
  all gone !, 
  it 's very action pumped like l4d and on higher difficulties you guys will probably fail a lot ( sorry for not having faith in you ) , which is always fun to watch . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ pls, 
  if pc is coming a bit later then i guess that 's ok . 
  but i will be super pissed and sad if it 's next gen only . 
  capcom pls, 
  what do you people think ? 
  there are thousands of cops ready anywhere in the town . 
  and we 've seen them drive cars n stuff . 
  how does the crew escape with that janky-ass van ? 
  edit : maybe 3:50 am was n't the best time for deep thoughts, 
  since anime has only a few of evil and really `` good '' anti-heroes i want to check out what you guys have . 
  it does n't matter if the mc is literally hitler , i just want my evil fix . 
  also , this will probably be my first manga . 
  i 've only read a few pages of berserk and parasyte out of interest . 
  ** edit ** : i 've seen death note , code geass and first season of tokyo ghoul ( someone told me that the mc is n't as evil in the 2nd anime season , so should i give that a try too ? ), 
  post memes for when i get back, 
  thank [ mr honesty ] ( / u/mr _ honesty _ ), 
  have you guys seen angel blade ? 
  there is this girl that shoots out a super hype kamehameha out of her dick in a church at another super girl . 
  [ i 'm obviously talking about ] ( #s `` tokyo ghoul 's kaneki '' ) . 
  i 'm reading the manga but , i kinda like this story they got going on in the anime . 
  edit : [ mal ] ( http://myanimelist.net/animelist/nklh4x0r ), 
  i 'm looking for some more dark and industrial-y stuff . 
  ok , guy ... 
  my teacher is one of them strict war vet guys and he takes shit way too seriously . 
  and now he comes up with this . 
  he was talking about how there are less kids in our country . 
  he has ** 11 ** kids and was married 3 times . 
  and he blows all of his salary on the kids too . 
  edit : forgot to mention . 
  i 'm in serbia and the teachers are still on a strike because of their pay cuts . 
  so there 's that . 
  enjoy your chump change , family man .
