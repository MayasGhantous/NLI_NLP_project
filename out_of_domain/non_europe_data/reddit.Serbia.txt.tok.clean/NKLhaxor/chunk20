  made me get an emulator for persona !, 
  cuz the only consoles where i live are the ps2 and ps3 and they 're super expensive . 
  now i 'm waiting for a ds emulator for smt4 . 
  i 've gotten used to awful controls and jank setups . 
  i mean , i used to play rampage and some brawlers on mame32 with 2 other people on 1 keyboard . 
  there 's a steady stream of salt running down my face now . 
  the classic cunt saga . 
  i can see clover using it .

  ( sorry pat and woolie hyped me up too much ), 
  how was your day , sir ? 
  i was trying to sleep and then i thought about a creepypasta i read a while ago about a little girl which was also sleeping . 
  her hand was hanging and being licked by what was supposed to be her dog . 
  her dog 's severed head was in her drawer . 
  gives me the creeps every time . 
  it would be a huge city . 
  this place would be downtown along with some other big mainstream subreddits . 
  the nsfw subs would be the xxx clubs . 
  / r/circlejerk , / r/4chan / r/imgoingtohellforthis and the other amazing would be the ghetto . 
  this sounds more like a south park show . 
  on my palm . 
  it would say [ * cocainum !, 
  no kids are horrible . 
  a * probably * cute dog is dead because of it . 
  now feel bad again .
