  i had a relatively soft landing . 
  i can hear a lot of weird noises so pls help . 
  i think i 'm gon na hide in the vents for now . 
  ** phone disabled by user **, 
  i managed to escape from the tigers . 
  then i found a room with mostly electronic junk . 
  i found a manual ( more like scribbles ) and i made an ied using my old phone , some green fart gas looking stuff and some crappy prototype fire crackers ... just in case if i ran into more tigers . 
  i did ... then i used the fart gas ied and set of a huge explosion behind me . 
  i used the skin that flew all over the place to make a bandana to cover my mouth and nose . 
  so if the vents smell like asshole & fried tigers now you know why . 
  i found a way out of the vents . 
  but i still see green spots and hallucinations from time to time and hear weird noises . 
  now i 'm wandering around trying to find a shower . 
  ... i think my arm became a tentacle for a moment there ... 
  i like really liked `` goblin darts '' ... 
  it 's a really neat meme, 
  i love modding skyrim . 
  i played hundreds of hours . 
  and today i wanted to start a new game because my last one was outdated and filled with junk . 
  but every once in a while i get rid of skyrim ... * ( anyone else ? 
  got everything ready , tested a few things and it worked . 
  then i tried to load up a save and it crashed every time . 
  i tried every combination of mods and i gave up . 
  i love you but fuck you and see you again in a few months , skyrim . 
  if they 're a part of someone 's experiment . 
  but i found an ancient vampire in the void and he 's hungry . 
  i fed him too much . 
  and the intern blood is n't the most pure around here so he 's falling apart like an old sack . 
  words , subjects , verbs , memes , anything . 
  i will write a story ( probably a shitty one ) using your shitty words . 
  think of it as a jank version of mad libs without a finished story in place . 
  ** edit ** : `` later '' may or may not be tomorrow . 
  ** closed for now **, 
  i would prefer a cool mc . 
  does n't matter if it 's swords , giant robots , fists or whatever . 
  ecchi , fan service , romance and all that stuff are fine . 
  and nothing ancient unless it looks super good . 
  i 'm doing it because they ate most of my equipment ~ ~ and all of my stolen cheese sticks ~ ~ . 
  welcome , back friends !, 
  last time i gave you the chain-fork ^ ^ tm, 
  this time ... 
  i have something very different . 
  the demonik sword fork ^ ^ tm ( it 's called like that because it uses the k fork ), 
  the blade and fork will burn and turn upside down & inside out any op or troll it touches . 
  the blade and the fork are made out of ordinary metal but was `` blessed '' by some weird cave cultists . 
  so that 's why i made this special sheath that 's made out of weird woodoo trees or some shit like that . 
  it even has a belt so you can strap it around your waist or behind your back . 
  ** disclaimer : / u/nklhaxor industries is not responsible for any psychological , physical or metaphysical side effects caused by the demonik sword fork ^ ^ tm . 
  i did some ... research and the results are giving me hope that we may survive this outbreak . 
  my name is / u/nklhaxor . 
  i am a bandit and a scientist . 
  if you hear this message then show it to other survivors . 
  if you discover another method ... relay the intel to everybody . 
  may cthulhu be with you . 
  * radio static *, 
  it 's been flying around the mess hall mz88 sucking up interns and food for hours . 
  i just saw jesus and the ghosts of the vent tigers having a metalcore breakdown ... 
  cthulhu is wearing a yellow suit ... 
  this is weird . 
  robots are playing didgeridoos ... what the ... 
  the inters are drowning in concrete ... 
  i think it 's wearing off . 
  and people told me that i 'm a madman ... 
  ** edit : and i 'm just giving a shoutout i have nothing to do with this mod !,

  #okay , let 's say this is an unofficial announcement . 
  ( the ) skyrim corruption ( project ) , wip surname , is an extended rewriting and fluffing associated to a big expansion of the two mods delzaron began alone ( a forsworn story and from the deep ) . 
  they are in my mind very good ideas and he 's incredibly motivated to work , as you may have seen in the past weeks . 
  so i first contacted him to help him for the writing and the lore-friendly-ing , but we quickly found out there was more that could be done on various flavours around the same core principles . 
  so the rewriting became a mod series , corrupting cults , whose first two will probably be cc : old gods ( afs 2.0 ) and cc : from the deep . 
  as i closely do n't know **** about coding but i have some background in writing , lead design and game design , the project is in a brainstorming/organizing stage and we did n't communicate publicly about because i do n't think the public relation part is kinky enough right now ( as people judge on appearances and a priori , `` i think you 're over your head '' comments are mean strikes that can cripple a perfectly valid project ) . 
  to give him credits , delzaron wanted me to throw announcements and gather volunteers for a good time already . 
  it 's a community project , we wo n't be able to do it by ourselves ( furthermore , delzaron only learned to use the ck in january , a lot of advanced tricks are beyond our level for now ) . 
  the public relation and manpower hunting is also slowed down by the fact that we 're also rewriting and making lore-friendly what has already been done , all the while designing the other modules , and testing assets , and bugtesting/styletesting the mods . 
  so back to the project : it 's a mod series , labelled corrupting cults , that allows you to play specific factions of the game world ; in accordance with the tes design ( you can play a bad guy ) but not the tes possibilities ( you cant ' join the bad guys - dawnguard excepted ) the goal here is to give a lore friendly , ( optionally ) kinky , interesting and fulfilling alternative experience . 
  about structure :, 
  instead of a great mod , we 've opted for a series of modules . 
  modules are autonomous , they often ca n't be played at the same time and do n't need another mod to be played . 
  furthermore , they are often scenaristically incompatible : you ca n't conquer the world for more than one master at the same time . 
  autonomous , not independant : there 's a special module ( corrupting cults : believers ) that will have in it assets common to other modules but also specific modules assets . 
  why ? 
  to use specific assets in multiple occurences , depending on the module you 're actually running for . 
  module x npcs can be targets for module y quests , if module y main quest makes you unable to play module x anyway . 
  it allows a more living world , a more economical work load , avoid an overflow of oneshot npcs and allows radiant quests . 
  it also makes `` having all the modules in you load order '' moot : assets and npcs are all in one only . 
  example : reviving the mythic dawn , fellow daedra cultists are liabilities to your master 's plans . 
  from the deep hermaeus mora 's cultists npcs are assassination targets of a radiant assassination quest . 
  about module structure and subject :, 
  there are major and minor modules . 
  major ones have a gameplay changer , a questline , kinks , a main kink , a main concept , a repeatable interesting outcome and a big change ( or more than one , for each of those ) . 
  minor lack two or more of those points and are less meaty . 
  gameplay changers can be specific advantages or disadvantages to the player , with factions , and so on . 
  in afs for example , it 's special paths with spells and perks . 
  a main kink has to be load bearing ( example : hippi ... hem primal shamans and bestiality ) . 
  repeatable outcomes are unknown to loverslabers for the moment ( they are mainly unique gains/powers that can be harvested from repeatable quests at the end of a module ), 
  big changes are impacts on the game world that makes you feel you 've clearly done something for your cult ( example : at the end of from the deep , the mists never go away and you can spread them ), 
  between the major and minor ones , we 've got nearly all daedras and some other powers . 
  i 've added nothing for the moment for sanguine because of over representation ( sex slaves and sanguine 's debauchery mainly , and you can add sexlab leveling ) .
