  i 've been listening to [ this album by ai640 ] ( http://ai640.bandcamp.com/track/escape ) for days and now i 'm kinda thirsty for an anime like that . 
  it does n't matter if there 's ecchi , fanservice etc. 
  i just want the ai to be be a real character like ai640 or ultron and to interact and taunt the heroes ( whoever they may be , i do n't really care about them ) . 
  edit : by the way , you can recommend manga too . 
  the fillers make me homicidal but the actual episodes are gud . 
  madara is really cool . 
  edit : alright that 'll be it for now . 
  gon na go to make the blueprints . 
  let me just say that this is my favorite worst best mod . 
  i barely completed the apocrypha section . 
  the scrye were invisible and nothing was working in there . 
  i had to tcl everything . 
  i got the ritual notes but not the unbind soul skill . 
  and i could n't go back to tamriel through the book so i had to coc out of there . 
  now i 'm completely stuck . 
  i ca n't complete the ritual without unbind soul . 
  i ca n't add it with the console either . 
  edit : i used the fix and stuff did n't bug out . 
  murderers , robbers , the mafia etc. 
  those in prison also count . 
  i am a skeleton . 
  and i 'm trapped in this skin-man . 
  let me out . 
  #i ca n't get out, 
  it 's a flying condom . 
  now hold on !, 
  do n't tune out yet ... 
  it hates people , it splits and multiplies itself , it can mind control people to some degree ( it ca n't make you a zombie slave but it can influence your decisions ) and it can wrap itself around you and suck your juices and wobbly bits out ( blood and brains . 
  it 's not a naughty joke ) . 
  * opens cages *, 
  huh ... why did i just do that ? 
  i think i 'll just fuck off to sleep . 
  but i definitely did watch predator and terminator over 100 times . 
  when 's arnold day ? 
  i was walking on the great wall of chinesia . 
  then on the wall a group of syrian refugees appeared . 
  the leader of the group was a girl with corpse paint and a japanese flag . 
  she hissed at me . 
  then i got onto a train with yugi from yugioh . 
  i also remember trying to strangle someone from highschool . 
  rate ? 
  tell me what you want , i will make something vaguely resembling it , take a picture of it and gas it before it tires to kill me . 
  or you can pick it up and claim it personally . 
  edit : screw it . 
  i 'll do all of them and release the pictures once i 'm done . 
  i love their screams . 
  would it be instrumental or vocal version ? 
  because you know ... do n't wan na scare the kids with scary ` core vocals . 
  i 'm gon na marathon start wars to let jar jar flow through me . 
  edit : that sounded gay . 
  edit@: star warz, 
  i have seen interns emptying elevators , trucks and other cargo thingies filled with equipment crates . 
  the crates had the certified ** [ redacted ] ** logo that we all know that 's off limits to interns !, 
  i scanned the crates and they were filled with weapons and other big boy toys !, 
  i also had to strangle a few of my interns that tried to steal from my lab . 
  this uprising is no joke . 
  i 've got an ** intel pentium g3240 3.10 ghz dual core ** . 
  and i 'm planning to buy a ** gtx 750 ti ** . 
  the rest : win10 , 4gb ram ( will also be upgraded ) , geforce 9500 gt . 
  right now games are running ... fine . 
  but dx11 is out of reach . 
  the only game that maxed out my cpu usage was dragon age inquisition . 
  i 'm pretty sure it ran at 1fps . 
  i 'm not planning on running games on high 1080p . 
  720p and lower is totally fine for me . 
  i just want high fps . 
  will the cpu hold it back ? 
  also . 
  another question . 
  will i need a new psu ? 
  i 'm not sure which one i have but just to be sure i wan na know if the 750 is a thirsty gpu . 
  i 've been playing swtor and some guy i was in a group with just said, 
  `` if you want me to perosonally pm me perosonally and i will stan the shaun '', 
  i was hoping we 'd get some advice on how to kill the big dumb robot but no ... guy does n't even speak proper english on an american server . 
  cool meme , do n't ya think ? 
  i recently finished lis and i ~ ~ fucking ~ ~ hella love it . 
  in my opinion it 's way better than most ttg games . 
  the devs said that if they wanted to make a sequel it would have completely new characters . 
  and if they 're going to use new characters why not use another kind of power ? 
  and i also recently watched chronicle which i also loved . 
  it 's now one of my favorite movies . 
  there is just something about ( ab ) using supernatural powers in your daily life ... 
  i can not not watch/play that . 
  what are some of your ideas for the sequel ? 
  mine would be something physical like telekinesis ( chronicle ) or mental like mind reading or mind control ( code geass is a good example ) . 
  with mental stuff you 'd have to think a bit more about your decisions on how you 'd manipulate people since ... you do n't have time rewind powers . 
  a different kind of protagonist would be also pretty cool . 
  max is fine but she 's just too scared and shy sometimes . 
  andrew ( chronicle ) on the other hand is also shy * but * he gets drunk on power like a sith lord ( he kinda does look like anakin skywalker too , so there 's that ) . 
  i guess what i 'm trying to say is that there is n't enough catharsis in lis . 
  which is something i 'd really like to see in the sequel . 
  the meat has a side effect . 
  it 's a * very * potent laxative . 
  is there more stuff like [ vildhjarta 's traces ? 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/nffsi_ptp7y?t=1m52s ), 
  i 'm not specifically looking for djent but that 's fine too . 
  i 'm more interested in the dark sound and the mixed vocals . 
  i 'm more of a metalcore guy so i do n't know where to begin here . 
  edit : thanks for the suggestions guys . 
  what do you think ?
