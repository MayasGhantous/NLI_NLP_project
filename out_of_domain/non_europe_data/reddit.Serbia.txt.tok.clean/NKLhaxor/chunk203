  a big ol' gabe face on his back ? 
  or the one where he 's in the half life armor ? 
  obviously the big one gives you information but the sort option is faster . 
  but is it outdated or does it get load orders from an old list or something ? 
  just wan na be safe . 
  only reply to the last comment . 
  in case if multiple people reply at the same time  the oldest comment stays . 
  the newest ones get killed . 
  i 'll start :, 
  ** edit : oh and do n't do [ your comment - some guy 's comment - you again . ], 
  post later **, 
  and try not to trigger automod, 
  ** edit the sequel : you ruined it but keep going . 
  let 's continue the story with sentences now . 
  this guy came into my office and said something like `` sir , you and your friends owe the government a lot of money . 
  you 've wasted your budget commiting crimes against nature and completely ignored your original objective blah blah '', 
  then i said `` ok , guy ... 
  i do n't know what you want from me , i just kind of work here ... so ... * drug addicted turtle screams as i inject it with more drugs * businessman leave ! '', 
  he stumbled back , smacked his head on the doorframe , stumbled back into the hallway and left . 
  he 's probably going to show up at your place too . 
  how is it free ? 
  this one simple trick !, 
  ~ ~ subconscious ads !, 
  you get them , but you do n't * get * them . 
  win for me and you . ~ ~, 
  ( pronounced as * hype-to-nite * ) hypetonite 's main purpose was basically to use the hardness of batmanium and the ever evolving number of features that are in orphanite . 
  it creates a thin and hard metallic shell without taking away the mobility of the skin or mechanical parts . 
  you can customize the color , texture , smell , weight , * girth * , spikiness and how long it will last . 
  you can do all of that with science , you know how it works . 
  i 've used on the 4 winged super nightmare pigs , cheese ( the cheese was useless after but it worked ) , a few mechs , my crotch and many interns . 
  now ... 
  i 'd like to thank [ the ceo of orphanite corp ] ( / u/tbestig ) and [ the goddamn batman ] ( / u/xgfdgfbdbgcxnhgc ) for their amazing elements . 
  please , join me in celebration and take a batch of hypetonite . 
  * puts up sign *, 
  ** hypetonite for everyone !, 
  so ... we were both banging padme from star wars . 
  then some stuff happened . 
  then she had a baby with big ol' a horse dong . 
  but i dodged and said something to him . 
  what a fucking douchebag this guy . 
  edit : this thread is trash now . 
  post whatever you want, 
  / u/emobatman is helping me out today with this amama thing, 
  ** sung ** diamo , diamo . 
  livin ' next to , diamo . 
  i keep hearing these screams , moans and i dunno . 
  i hate living in this home . 
  ** screamed ** i. . . ca n't ... take thiiiis anymoooooore . 
  ** rapped ** i knock on his door only i wish that i did n't tho . 
  cuz i only saw a sexual gay horror . 
  ** sung ** diamo , diamo . 
  livin ' next to , diamo . 
  ** screamed ** bleagh !, 
  ** djent breakdown **, 
  i just did it . 
  it was n't that bad ( at least for me ) . 
  so i was laying in my bed then a small window opened and i saw her eyes . 
  it was a goth-y looking girl with purple eye makeup ( i dunno what 's it called ) . 
  she crawled towards me , came really close to my face and started screaming . 
  then she just sat on me and started saying `` my queen '' over and over . 
  i tried to laugh but i could n't . 
  while she was talking bullshit , her face started changing . 
  in the end she looked like one of those weird african tribe head thingies . 
  and finally she faded into the darkness of the room and i woke up . 
  my pulse was normal too and i was n't sweaty or anything . 
  i always wanted to try this and i did it . 
  i 'll try again next time to see if it 's going to be different . 
  i tried looking for the things that the guy said but i could n't find anything . 
  i 'm not planning on buying one any time soon but just looking at them they look like they would feel uncomfortable . 
  do they put pressure on the nose , are they tight or heavy etc. 
  stuff like `` what 's it like to be a citizen of the sith empire '' or `` what do orcs in lotr do when there 's no war ? '', 
  guy . 
  almost 18 btw . 
  i know that being on the pc/phone all day is unhealthy but i simply do not care about anything or anyone . 
  i play games and watch movies because they make me feel good . 
  i enjoy games that have good gameplay and/or story but the thing that makes me * feel good * are rpgs with moral choices , evil choices , multiple endings etc. 
  i ca n't explain the feeling but doing the evil ending in both recent shadowrun and kotor games gave me some of the biggest rushes in a while . 
  my favorite was ripping off the arm of that guy in the wolf among us . 
  where the hell am i supposed to find a feeling like that in real life . 
  being a criminal ? 
  i told my mom i 'd try to go out and stuff but i kind of lied so she would get off my back for a while . 
  am i a sadist or a sociopath or something ? 
  how do i explain this shit ? 
  nobody in my family is * anything * like me . 
  i turned out all wrong . 
  ** edit ** : honestly i 'm not sure why i decided to post this . 
  i could say `` thanks for the advice guys . 
  i 'll try to change '' but that 'd be a lie . 
  saying `` thanks '' makes me feel weird . 
  an `` eww '' weird kind of feeling . 
  i probably would n't even try to change . 
  people do n't like different . 
  and i do n't like them for the same reason , i guess . 
  i 'll try whatever opportunity comes up next . 
  maybe . 
  nice game . 
  upclem to the left, 
  i 'm full dark side right now , by the way . 
  finished telos and nar shadda . 
  on the dxun moon currently .
