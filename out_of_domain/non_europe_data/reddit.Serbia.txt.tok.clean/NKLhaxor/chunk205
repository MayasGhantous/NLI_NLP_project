  every time i wan na go to a different page i get flashbanged . 
  it 's not fun for my eyes, 
  keep it up, 
  does this confirm that the kid * is * the lord of woe ? 
  [ here he is making a flower bloom in ether ] ( https://youtu.be/wd5nqgle8dy?t=1m48s ), 
  [ and here it is in neverbloom ] ( https://youtu.be/5nymgqd6ble?t=6m13s ), 
  there 's tons of other symbolism in the video . 
  like the trees , levitating leaves and the sunrise and how the boy looks sad when the moon shows up * ( i linger on in doubt , darkness comes early down here . 
  wishing upon ages , these flowers will someday bloom . 
  ( from neverbloom ) * . 
  also , there are izanami and izanagi which are probably morrow and lord of woe . 
  still not sure if this is a sequel or prequel but that does n't really matter . 
  the lyrics are positive , tho they might get become more dire like they did in old souls ( reverse order ) . 
  anyway , i 've been up way too long and i certainly do n't have the detective skills like / u/thesuperbowlcometh demonstrated [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/deathcore/comments/37tqrh/can_anyone_explain_the_entire_concept_story_of/crq464y ) . 
  i just really love this story and wanted to share, 
  i want to make an empire and just let the ai play while i make decisions and pump resources into it with the console . 
  if i put the difficulty on insane will my ai controlled empire be insane or normal ? 
  i 'm in the obsessed 100 + club, 
  i could just throw the cock-a-roach out but i hate them so much that i do n't want them to rest in peace yet . 
  when i boot up the pc the login screen either says `` wrong password '' or `` we were unable to connect right now '', 
  it 's only on that map . 
  first it 's 60fps then it starts getting chopped up and goes back to 60 . 
  all the time . 
  i had this problem before but it 's worse with the new update, 
  just try to fuck on me , see what happens , narg . 
  it kind of reminded me of stanley parable . 
  i 'm not sure if the game is released yet . 
  you had dialogue choices and the guy on the phone had a creepy voice . 
  what about you , my dudes ? 
  edit : it 's a geiger counter , ya fuck, 
  also , if you have your own shrieks post them if you 're not dead, 
  do n't expect anything , i might deliver nothing, 
  edit : ok , maybe never mind, 
  first video was a fucking evanescence amv holy shit, 
  [ ai640 by landon tewers ( the plot in you vocalist ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=happcshp9q4 ) is a about a robot that decides to build an army and destroy humans before we destroy the earth . 
  [ fleshgod apocalypse - king ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1shs0me1tde ) tells the story of an old king and the corruption in his court . 
  the king is fucking scary . 
  [ make them suffer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n31nc496j_a ) . 
  all of their music is part of one story . 
  even the happy sounding ether they recently put out . 
  the story is about the lord of woe , he 's basically a. . . ghost guy who just wanted to be happy with his lady morrow . 
  she left and he had a breakdown ( hah ) , burned down the forest and moved on to haunt the guy from old souls . 
  [ vildhjarta - m\u00e5sstaden ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3ib8agrgde ) is kind of a dark fairy tale of a hidden town and our main characters ( the protagonist and the deranger ) . 
  i recommend looking at [ this ] ( http://got-djent.com/review/what-thall-meaning-behind-m%c3%a5sstaden ) . 
  the devil wears prada [ zombie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcl4jjnucoo ) and [ space ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvnjpwnp7sq ) . 
  pretty self-explanatory, 
  [ becoming the archetype - i am ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0ooxnk697g ) .

  oli tries to scrim and fucks his throat  muh archietects .

  architex wants to do continue doing the thing without bmth  oh , good . 
  memes were actually good back then . 
  they were funny , they were endearing , people did n't run them into the ground in the span of a month . 
  post-harlem shake , that 's when memes got really shit . 
  meme culture today is a mistake . 
  it 's nothing but trash . 
  every instagram-browsing , snapchat-using , twittering normie knows about hilarious internet memes . 
  news sites talk about memes . 
  for some reason , everybody calls those shitty twitter images ( you know the ones i 'm talking about ) `` memes '' . 
  look , guys , i `` made a meme '' . 
  no , lad , you do n't `` make memes '' . 
  memes grow from the soil of the internet , no single man produces a meme . 
  the memes we have today , aside from being lower quality , die off much quicker . 
  their lifespans are pitifully short ; how many weeks did it take for the harambe meme to wither out ? 
  in contrast , the memes of the past could last for years without anybody getting tired of them . 
  youtube poop , for example , was phenomenon that lasted for half a decade . 
  there were tens of thousands of videos made , all creative , original content that people put effort into . 
  memes these days do n't take any effort . 
  all these new normie edgelords can just say `` haha dicks out '' and get some laughs . 
  it 's the internet equivalent of bubblegum ; all these cheap memes lose their flavour in only a week . 
  let me tell you , back in the glory days , memes were things like numa numa , caramelldansen , cd-i games/ytp , content producers like the angry video game nerd and the nostalgia critic , touhou music remixes , trollface , snowclone images ( think pacha edits - a respectable meme from a couple of months ago that was a nice tribute to old internet image fads ) , ytmnd , all that good stuff . 
  the thing i hate most about post-harlem shake memes , are those fucking ironic `` dank '' memes that you mentioned . 
  there 's nothing even slightly amusing about them . 
  where 's the sincerity ? 
  why do people find `` jet fuel ca n't melt steel beams '' so funny ? 
  i do n't even understand why these specific phrases became popular . 
  people were saying `` dank memes '' on places like / r/circlejerk for years , then , for whatever reason , it caught on in 2015 and now you have `` dank meme '' pages on facebook . 
  facebook !, 
  can you believe it ? 
  facebook , a site for getting your memes ? 
  what a joke . 
  we used to get the freshest memes from 4chan , spice them up , enjoy them . 
  reddit would inevitably make those memes shit , but it was n't so bad . 
  9gag would eat reddit 's gold-turned-shit , shit that shit into shittier meme sites , until everybody got tired of that shit . 
  at least it was golden for some time , am i right ? 
  of course , the wave of ironic memes was to be expected as memes got more and more popular with the newfags ( a dated term , i know , but fitting for this conversation ) . 
  the decline in memetic quality was an predictable side effect of this increase in popularity , and the backlash from frustrated anti-memers was quite natural . 
  my problem is not them being ironic , i love ironic memery when it 's done right ( shoutout to my boys at / r/coaxedintoasnafu ) , but most modern ironic memesters have their heads too far up their own asses . 
  in their `` hilariously ironic '' bliss , they became blind to their own cancerous nature , and as a result , are just as bad as the regular memesters . 
  fucc your succs and your jet fuel and fedoras . 
  fuck , man , maybe i 'm just a bitter phaggot who does n't realize the shittiness of old school memes thanks to his nostalgia goggles , but it 's undeniable that memes have dropped in quality these days . 
  there 's just no sincerity anymore .
