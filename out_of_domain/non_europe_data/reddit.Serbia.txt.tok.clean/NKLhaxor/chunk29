  ah ... the 2001 hit,

  * soda * mizing ? 
  sounds nasty . 
  just a little bit evil . 
  more than you 'd think , less than you 'd hope . 
  he looks cool . 
  ohhhh yeaaaah !, 
  thank you op for being a fagola and not posting anything else . 
  * you * are a cool guy , though . 
  1st look . 
  what the fuck is this supposed to mean ? 
  2nd look . 
  laws of the wild ? 
  ... rules ... of ... nature ? 
  3rd look . 
  that looks like the metal gear from ... ooooohhh !, 
  those pictures ~ ~ rook rearry ~ ~ look really good, 
  i posted this in the wrong thread . 
  * good job idiot *, 
  i must admit that i posted this comment in the wrong thread a little while ago . 
  and that i successfully squirted a chunk of woolie in the [ funhaus subreddit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/funhaus/comments/2voflv/waiting_for_new_videos/ ) . 
  the meme ... the meme stays with me . 
  com at me bro !, 
  i will nat be opresed bi skellons a - any ... moar ... nooo ! 1 my dank ... my meems !, 
  am ded now, 
  i am skeleton jelly i am skelleton jely i am skeleton jelly i am skelleton jely, 
  2 pcs ? 
  i 'm surprised that it already is n't some obscure underground punk band . 
  oh my god , what a post of shit this is . 
  nice crop m9 . 
  enhanced steam fixed that for me . 
  i 'll be honest . 
  i have no cred card and i love playing video games . 
  when i was a kid i always thought lotr and harry potter were the same thing . 
  a 4chan raid on the whole internet ? 
  that 'd be gold . 
  ok , i 'm gon na address the elephant in the room here . 
  where the hell is the free cappuccino ? 
  well , i 'm not interested in this game , like at all and i hate nexon . 
  but it gets the critters some money and all that stuff so , yeah . 
  unlike the yt comments , i do n't bitch . 
  use world time buddy, 
  just draw a triangle inside a fucking triangle . 
  is that the new ascii rpg ? 
  nobody likes you , joe . 
  go away . 
  i 'd very much enjoy this . 
  that or bible black . 
  what a biased jackass . 
  lizard ninjas , thunder gods , other realms , big centaur dudes and a girl made out of blood . 
  * realism ? 
  the only people i could play together with are my cousins . 
  but they fucking suck . 
  they barely understand the controls and mash every button like maniacs . 
  they play call of duty * singleplayer * , fifa and pes . 
  so i pretty much play fite gaems while listening to podcasts and stuff . 
  why in the world is this going to arcades ? 
  would n't it make more sense ... like i dunno , handhelds and ps4 ? 
  that 'd be probably be a lot of work . 
  models , textures , making sure animations and hitboxes work correctly and extra file sizes . 
  we played on one keyboard . 
  i could n't even do hype moves because they press stuff too much and the pc starts beeping ( the 3 keys thing ) . 
  example : we were playing last blade 2 and i was setsuna . 
  i wanted to do a buff move that 's a prerequisite for an ultimate . 
  ca n't do it . 
  dude is mashing like crazy . 
  holy shit , that guy handed out some love ** and ** some sick burns . 
  hope he gets called next year . 
  this is the only thing i like about v day . 
  instructions unclear , made free coffee . 
  made a new character . 
  killed everyone i saw . 
  with all the new tech , games have been really half assed recently . 
  nothning here . 
  also mwb, 
  that fagget moot . 
  he probably made a dead man 's switch . 
  i coulda read something else . 
  why is that even a real place ? 
  she looks like a child of cunt, 
  i really do n't need to watch either , because i read the news all the time . 
  i do n't need news about ps4 and xbox one , i watch it because i like the guys . 
  what ever you do ... do n't shit the bed with the night mode , ** please ** . 
  i 'm talking about the * light , dark , light , dark * posts . 
  like in / r/dragonage and / r/funhaus . 
  that shit is annoying . 
  i 'm glad i watched a few episodes to know what you mean . 
  this shit is brilliant . 
  '' * fuck you * '' accepted . 
  a theory suggests that the woolie hole always existed . 
  and that if you jump in and keep falling deeper you 'll just end up falling in it again . 
  how can she not be nervous ? 
  everyone starts out like that on youtube . 
  well this is amazing . 
  as soon as i saw ascii and potatoes i knew which game you were talking about ... 
  i can fall asleep pretty quickly if i listen to celldweller . 
  but i did this before i knew about ld . 
  have n't tried it recently .
