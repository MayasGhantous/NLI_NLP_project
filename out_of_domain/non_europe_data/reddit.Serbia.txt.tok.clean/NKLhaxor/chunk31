  i 'd like to see that , if they can make it run properly . 
  i had super weird graphical glitches . 
  i miss them too . 
  but at least we 've got / r/2spooky4me and / r/ledootgeneration, 
  as a fan of the critters and funhaus/ex ig , i love this . 
  i hope they do something together in the future . 
  [ death note ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkxw1ibgzoy ) was my first anime and when i saw this intro i almost exploded from the sheer hype . 
  [ parasyte ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=em_twa_pgkg ) their english skills may not be super good but it sounds rad . 
  [ gantz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj1b7lhx7r8 ) . 
  not my kinda music , but i really like this one and the intro is action-y . 
  [ attack on titan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmxghfhxkvm ) . 
  what the hell is there to say ? 
  [ literally all of jojo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4jo_3hrxdu ), 
  [ black lagoon ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31v0ft0f_wo ) . 
  the is dripping with awesomeness . 
  dem chills , man . 
  ling tosite sigure is fucking sick . 
  i like the second one a lot too but this is the one that started it all for me . 
  this is even better than the post about the fat people camp . 
  the second op is on my crap list . 
  just like guilty crown . 
  i recognize a zaibatsu fan when i see one . 
  how did my jank phone open this with no problems ? 
  i 'm confused . 
  northlane - dispissesion, 
  motionless in white - reincarnate, 
  nightmare - the world, 
  fear and loathing in la vegas - let me hear, 
  bring me the horizon - empire . 
  celldweller - literaly anything by him . 
  and monstercat music, 
  the right one looks like a gummy bear, 
  a motion tracker is essential in this situation . 
  where did they come from ? 
  another galaxy or from deep space ? 
  the guy that likes kenny , vergil , griffith , predator and bible black . 
  skellude - calciustorm, 
  yo , we got ta push this for summerslam !, 
  bertram , the hero of our time . 
  why is this shit still going on ? 
  i like how the girls keeps shrieking in his face, 
  it 's the guy that looks like the other guy ? 
  it 's a tumor . 
  approved . 
  if you play warframe , try celldweller . 
  it was super hype while i played it . 
  i hate his projectile attack in mk9 . 
  he just sprinkles water at you !, 
  i 'd watch house of creatures, 
  3rd time, 
  or better yet / r/skyrimmods, 
  i shortly dropped pyscho pass because the girl , whatever her name is , had a boring scene where she was talking with some other girls . 
  ( this is the reason why i thought p pass was boring , it 's not actually ... ), 
  i wish the mace said stuff during combat . 
  like `` pride '' the pistol from saints row gat outta hell . 
  this was once a proud and majestic animal flying with the might dovah in the sky . 
  the only thing i recognize in the thread . 
  and the only thing i remember is the big-ass blue sword and the guy swallowing the other guy 's soul .

  perkui let 's you edit skill levels , perk points and perks . 
  not sure if it works with mods that change or add perks but worth a try . 
  fuck you people who say `` should of '',
