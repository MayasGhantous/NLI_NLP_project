  i 'm ~ ~ respecting the pipe ~ ~ expecting hagar to walk into the shot . 
  i 'm a * little * bit salty ... 
  hitman : absolution, 
  dark ? 
  shamo . 
  it starts out ** rough ** . 
  ok some super minor starting spoilers . 
  mc snaps , kills parents , goes to prison , learns karate , and goes into crime adventures . 
  i injected salt into my eyes . 
  serbia . 
  you know , the place where they made the 2001 hit `` serbian film '' . 
  `` it 's like co-optionnal podcast , with ~ ~ guns ~ ~ kovic ! '', 
  i like to bind alt to free look ( mod ) . 
  so when i 'm running ... ( \u0361 \u2022 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u2022 ), 
  you might say that ... your parts are on a feel trip ... 
  that 's horrible , i 'll see myself out . 
  darksiders has some big-ass keys, 
  who knows . 
  he might even respond to that . 
  i like to imagine inigo being the stanley parable of followers . 
  first person + bouncy physics, 
  this song is like the 4th opening of jojo 's bizarre adventure . 
  i did n't like it the first time i heard it . 
  a bunch of replays later and i love it . 
  xp32 skeleton , body that supports bbp , tbbp or hdt ( sevenbase , unpb , manga etc. ), 
  and a fps mod . 
  i think it 's immersive first person , but i might be wrong cuz i have n't played skyrim in a while . 
  * throws burning tomatoes at op *, 
  lights out master race, 
  try with youtube center . 
  it might work on embeded videos . 
  by the way if you 're chrome and it does n't let you use yt center , install the tampermonkey script version . 
  what a fagola, 
  and he was so young ... and gay ... 
  death note and code geass . 
  they dern sure took me on a feel trip . 
  well , i was n't watching them because they were the cool shows . 
  i saw death note on tv before internet was a thing where i live . 
  and code geass was a recommendation on reddit ( i was looking for another anti-hero ) . 
  op obviously has viking blood, 
  #still breathing, 
  i hope the train only makes the ora ora sounds . 
  i have no idea what cat shit one is , but i 'll vote for it . 
  less talkative npcs can fix this . 
  they 'll only talk when you get uncomfortably close . 
  predayytor is the coolmaoest ayylien ever, 
  it 's probably a shock prank button, 
  yeah , pretty much a reddit wide thing . 
  there will always be * those * people who do n't like anything . 
  well , son of a bitch ... 
  i 'm gon na be that guy and say it 's actually metalcore . 
  and i 'm gon na say fuck their newest song . 
  kevin , the business destroyer . 
  i think i got distracted by joe ^ 2 's nipples, 
  my guy is an immortal high elf that got super drunk and blacked out and woke up in another era . 
  he uses enchanted swords and destruction . 
  he later gets dragon wings ( mod ) and learns to fly . 
  also becomes a necromancer . 
  and because he spent too much time in the apocrypha , he became insane . 
  he walked a straight line across skyrim killing everyone in his path . 
  now he hoards bones and hearts . 
  i like the `` dynamic '' plot and ever changing roles . 
  i like watching them screw around . 
  it was ritten back when the voice recognition quills were still in alpha stage . 
  i know just the song for you little adventure . 
  [ dead as fuck ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4rwmcqkola ), 
  i 'm pretty sure that you can add the bush as an equipable item with console commands . 
  holy shit !, 
  are you 're some kind ms paint wizard ? 
  aww , they did n't show the intro cutscene where the cop guy is giving the devil a blow job . 
  it 's time to du du du du du duel !, 
  i thought he meant pepe the frog . 
  what a fucking gayjin ... 
  this is n't a meme , so ... 
  6ft deep , to be precise, 
  m respawn got canned . 
  along with some other stuff . 
  skin-man !, 
   it 's whatever ~ ~ you ~ ~ * mwm * wants it to be, 
  predator is the best movie ever made . 
  if you disagree , then you 're a big dirty liar . 
  for me the 1st one was repetitive . 
  in the 2nd the collectibles are actually interesting and the side missions had stories . 
  first game i completed 100 % . 
  well , you know who to blame . 
  florida man ... 
  someone make a r34 version . 
  example : if the girl has shiny abs , it 's ganassa, 
  serious sam series . 
  but , they 're bosses and few . 
  buuuut ... ss2 had the biggest final boss at the time . 
  so there 's that . 
  you can have a baby with lu bu in dw8 empires . 
  i named my babby wu li, 
  if lelouch loses my salt levels will go over 9000, 
   implying it was n't shit from the start, 
  fucking rules of nature of course . 
  i put my thumb over my index finger and crack it . 
  after that i look at my palm and ask myself if i 'm dreaming ( i also try to figure out where , why and how i got here ) . 
  i crack my fingers all day so there is no chance to miss a rc .
