  come on look at him . 
  shit 's hype as fuck . 
  ayy | rekt | not rekt, 
  chair | \u2611 |, 
  door knob | \u2611 |, 
  oh man , you should really play it . 
  one of the best game series i 've ever played . 
  i 've read the manga and started reading : re . 
  now i just need to see the last episode of root a. 
  and remember that stupid hat cc wore ? 
  i hate that stupid hat ... 
  i still think table kun shoulda won / r/anime 's best guy contest . 
  ^ ^ ^ seriously ^ ^ ^ tho ^ ^ ^ lelouch ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ shit, 
  somehow i 'm not surprised, 
  i just saw the ending . 
  it 's like they switched lanes and instead of arriving at the destination smoothly , they wrecked the car . 
  oh , he dern sure is n't . 
  [ it kind of went full circle ] ( / s `` rize was inside kaneki . 
  and now kaneki is inside haise '' ), 
  ooh ... low blow, 
  i 'm gon na fuck off to sleep . 
  this joke will probably be in my head till morning . 
  thanks for that op . 
  git dat meta shit outta here !, 
  this is china talk !, 
  do n't reddit and pilot , kids . 
  how about snoo in heat vision with a chestburster inside him ? 
  you forgot the '' / s '', 
  jojo is one of my favorites because of that . 
  it 's pretty fast with no bullshit, 
  and now he reminds me of seamoose from thecreatures . 
  yeah , but the 2012 jojo is really fast . 
  joe is really pushing shia into the creatures lore . 
  damn dude . 
  rip . 
  like that castlevania puzzle, 
  is it like holding a bullet between your nose and lips ? 
  is that a super saiyan on the cover ? 
  are phone screencaps a thing on / r/skyrim now ? 
  i 'll use my keyboard . 
  it 's not even really a gaming keyboard . 
  but i still am pretty good at fighting games with it . 
  i suck with controllers though . 
  ok let 's see ... shaba games ( rip ) , treyarch ( come on , they do n't need $ 20 ) , and griponite games [ ( who ? 
  got ta get that garrus ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  seriously though , i have no problems playing the opposite gender and it 's pretty interesting . 
  and i 've never been called a princess before . 
  well , the show is pretty much about lelouch . 
  if they do n't like him , i doubt they will enjoy it . 
  [ somewhere ayyround the end lmao ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqkk4sb_cgo ), 
  legend of legendary heroes . 
  not exactly what you want since there are plenty of mages . 
  but the mc can copy any ability and the other guys just shit themselves when they find out . 
  since anyone can be anonymous ... well rip in piece, 
  actually scratch fate off the list . 
  i did n't get hooked instantly either . 
  for some reason i thought it did . 
  but it got interesting after a bunch of episodes . 
  note : ok ... 
  i 'm on my phone and i 'm pretty sure that 's not mine, 
  ayy lmao ... poor bastard . 
  well to be honest , he wanted to see some real action ... 
  seriously though . 
  fuck that black hair . 
  they made me3 better with the dlc later . 
  * this * is fucked . 
  fagola smile, 
  oh god, 
  this should be on the sidebar . 
  i wish the levels were bigger and more destructible . 
  the ceiling is super low . 
  i mean come on ... 
  it 's like toys in a box . 
  and the ai is really pissing me off . 
  i 'm fighting one guy and i see the other enemy charging at me . 
  he hits me and runs away to fight my ally . 
  also more transformations woulda been cooler . 
  final form friziepop and ssj3 kakakarocake ... ahh ... 
  also , for the fans of the tfs abridged series , they 're doing a playthrough of dbzxv on their gaming channel . 
  the adventures of dumplin ... 
  looks like an industrial version of attack on titan . 
  i only have the finest and rarest pepes . 
  me3 is a lot better with the extended cut and citadel dlc . 
  like ... a huge difference . 
  what is that huge box supposed to be ? 
  you will be le missed . 
  dern sure am , 
  note : no males . 
  i only do girls , robots and weird aliens, 
  the citadel dlc is one of the ** best ** dlcs ever . 
  it 's simply that good . 
  just ask / r/masseffect . 
  and while the extended cut is not perfect , it 's a lot better than the original ending . 
  you can buy the whole trilogy with all the dlc if you can find something cheap . 
  it 's worth it .
