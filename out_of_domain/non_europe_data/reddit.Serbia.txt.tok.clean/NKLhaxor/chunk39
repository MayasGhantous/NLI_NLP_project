  i also want to point out that this was supposed to be ** the ** pirate game . 
  my personal favorite is `` yuk yuk yuk '', 
  because of them i use the word `` hype '' too much . 
  it 's an almost forgotten movie and not very old . 
  altered . 
  it 's really tense and keeps being to the end . 
  to the metal and core subclasses , try `` the zen of screaming '' . 
  using this you will increase damage resistance , since those subclasses sacrifice some of their hp . 
  i dern sure did . 
  renegade for life, 
  what a shitpost . 
  there are not even memes here . 
  youre not the boss of me !, 
  i was expecting a pcmr joke ... but alright , this is awesome . 
  they shit the bed with tokyo ghoul pretty bad . 
  so , what do i do with this excess hype ? 
  from the picture i thought you would have a werewolf . 
  get good . 
  this subreddit makes me depressed , suicidal , and homicidal . 
  yeah , i saw it years ago on some obscure foreign tv channel . 
  well , this was pointless . 
  but still cool , i guess . 
  reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, 
  just holding the sword makes you x10 more cool . 
  right when i was about to sleep this comes out . 
  thanks obama . 
  i do n't remember asking you god damn thing .

  so do they check it out here too or just over at the website ? 
  i submitted at the site too . 
  more rule34 shrek, 
  please do make a game . 
  i never finished metro because of that alien or whatever thing that makes that loud ringing noise . 
  my ear hurt for a week because of it . 
  some people on 4chan were trying to crash the pepe economy by posting rares and even legendary pepes . 
  welcome to tha club fuccboi, 
  ah ... ah ... aaahhhh ... memes ... oh that 's a good joke ... 
  old people are super strong . 
  that 's why they use canes . 
  right ? 
  ^ ^ right ? 
  i learned english . 
  gta san andreas gave me a huge boost . 
  i thought `` nigga '' meant buddy or something at first . 
  i can also do roundhouse kicks , which is nice . 
  i could * probably * figure out how to use a weapon . 
  and i can do some neat tricks with swords . 
  i know what is rustling but what is botchamania ? 
  i heard about it before but ... 
  i. . . do n't know ... help ? 
  you ai n't got shit on me !, 
  the hypest robot voice ever . 
  should i feel bad for renegading that option ? 
  character traits would have been a good start . 
  he was just a blank canvas with nothing painted on it . 
  i saw adam there once too . 
  [ op you had one job . 
  push this meme for summerslam !, 
  or when your pc is n't very glorious . 
  '' * that 's one big hammer * '', 
  * mother *** fuuuu ** ^ uu ^ ^ uu ^ ^ ^ u - * blasts into space *, 
  i want it to remain like this forever . 
  ... who ?

  are you just getting recommendations to put them under * wo n't watch * ? 
  you got some good shit there ... all i 'm saying ... 
  oh , a pepe i do n't have in my collection . 
  snayytch and run lmao . 
  only the best for jtd : \u0e2f ), 
  try dream mode . 
  also , you should try out the `` lucid '' buff while you 're in there . 
  amateur pepe and a shitpost . 
  you do n't see that every say . 
  more rule34 payday, 
  nothing happened . 
  keep an eye on one punch man . 
  it might be what you 're looking for . 
  the only person i can think off is kaiser from fatal fury or garou , do n't remember .

  and here we see shit .

  you might call it a `` shitpost '' . 
  * pulls pin * griffith did nothing wrong . 
  tendies and gbp ? 
  top kekels . 
  pepe is the shit now, 
  pooppost, 
  well , i 'll be damned ... sumbitch did it . 
  his autism is off the scale . 
  i did . 
  and that is why dragonfall was my goty . 
  i never expected something like that being in a game in this day and age . 
  i guess i 'm just used to shitty endings . 
  but this was amazing . 
  the ending was super satisfying . 
  hmm ... 
  i just realized this . 
  the titans are childfree too right ? 
  unless there 's some huge twist in the manga ... like a huge baby machine or something ... 
  this reminds me of that scene from scary movie 2 with shorty,
