  well ... 
  i played it just for a bit . 
  i really hated the escape menu animation ( the stupid trex and the huge boulder ), 
  [ serious sam level of options ] ( http://i.imgur.com/x9bufdb.jpg ) . 
  but they could hide them under `` super advanced graphical options '' , since it would be a bit overwhelming to the majority of peple . 
  why are we yelling ? 
  if you stopped playing a game you really like for no reason ( in my case it was mass effect 3 and the witcher 2 ) , just start it up and play . 
  you 'll get back into it right away . 
  same goes for shows , anime and stuff like that . 
  just do it . 
  * not making dying noises *, 
  the cleans sound really cool, 
  i think . 
  i was n't paying much attention since i was on a killing spree pretty much . 
  i just wandered in and it caught my attention . 
  oh ... shit 's gon na go down now !, 
  i do n't know what mod pack the dagger is from but it 's called the `` justiciar knife '' and the armor is `` black wisteria '' . 
  `` you have a long career ahead of you . '', 
  kek, 
  black lagoon ? 
  those guys are so fucking cool, 
  this goes along perfectly with my dark windows theme . 
  yes . 
  here is one from when ~ ~ h ~ ~ she was younger . 
  i started modding skyrim right after i left helgen . 
  i could n't stand the interface and the fov . 
  added some fancy magic , weapons and armors . 
  also ... a * little * bit of ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  and i 'm still playing it and have a lot of fun . 
  done, 
  i ca n't believe this is actually a meme ... 
  motherfucking worlds are colliding, 
  is this a meme ttoo ? 
  i do n't know what to believe . 
  i dern sure kek 'd though,
