  the manga is like made to be an anime . 
  for anyone wondering , here is what i meant by that . 
  nobody can defeat or see ~ ~ liam ~ ~ john cena, 
  post hardcore is actually decent . 
  i 'd put / r/corejerk there instead, 
  nope . 
  wish i could experience something like that . 
  i only get split killed and double teamed by clan dicks, 
  gunswords are fucking cool, 
  can this be a movie ? 
  when 's elder scrolls 6 , friends ? 
  i think he 's just autism . 
  everybody panic , i guess . 
  probably ign being stupid . 
  hmm ... 
  i can make that thing into another thing . 
  all right then . 
  i 'd rather have nothing . 
  thanks for the feedback . 
  check the edit and happy lynching !, 
  al-jalani could work like vette in swtor . 
  get the option to just punch her every time she opens her mouth . 
  shit gets crazy with physics effects and bloom, 
  at least there 's one cool guy . 
  you ca n't hit phones . 
  how the hell would you hit kids ? 
  well i guess i do n't see energy drinks and coffee being in the same category or something, 
  as a ** huge ** predator fan i got a ** huge ** predator boner when he used those effects, 
  even though rampage is a killing spree series , it 's actually decent . 
  fuck you boll , make the third movie . 
  at least he 's honest tho . 
  keep it on . 
  one day it will be worth it, 
  that should be a week before the ** boruto : naruto the movie ** let 's watch, 
  [ could have been worse ] ( http://i.imgur.com/u1jmn0o.png ), 
  i super forgot about that !, 
  ... ea ruined more childhoods than rule34, 
  but only with boss characters, 
  `` he 's gon na split and i 'm gon na be ready ... any second now ... '', 
  * even bigger guy apperars in front of me , splits and slurps up both of us *, 
  he was just a moth . 
  now he 's literaly a dead meme, 
  well ... as far as i know mo ca n't run 64bit programs . 
  so if you 're running the perkus maximus patcher ... mo * might * just shit itself and you 'll end up wasting time . 
  i could n't have immersive armors at the same time as immersive weapons ( ** edit : while running the perma patcher ** ) . 
  oh and you can edit the . ini files internally with mo. 
  they ** will ** work together . 
  but the perma patch could n't finish patching with those 2 mods together, 
  remove the text and it 's a pretty metal licture, 
  it did n't work even outside of mo. 
  maybe it 's my pc . 
  it 's not really a gaming pc but it does the job . 
  i love joel 's fallout answer . 
  ca n't wait for next elder scrolls because i really do n't like old american theme . 
  probably pushed back till 2016 for more polish . 
  what about youporn ? 
  they sponsored some pro gamers . 
  i * somehow * came from / r/jerktalkdiamond, 
  jtd is a joke circlejerk subreddit about circlejerking and memes ( maybe ) . 
  and this is how i actually got here . 
  that 's awesome, 
  i do n't know what the fuck is there to like about that game . 
  worst pay2win trash i 've ever played . 
  ninja theory made dmc on ue3 . 
  this is probably too running on unreal . 
  probably ue4 since it 's `` next gen '' 'n shit . 
  * takes off tie *, 
  * puts tie around head *, 
  * puts on face camo *, 
  * spends 5 minutes yanking out a pipe *, 
  * coats toothpicks in shampoo *, 
  * puts toothpick in pipe , blows through it , loses a toothpick in the toilet *, 
  nobody likes shampoo in their eyes ... and nobody likes toothpicks in their eyes either ... 
  so you ... like ... umm ... you wo n't like this even more ... 
  * vanishes into the vents *, 
  * crawls out off vent *, 
  did someone say blackjack ? 
  well i guess i 'm a home invader then !, 
  by the way i do n't have any money any more . 
  i only have tiger poop , tiger teeth and tiger skin . 
  [ * looks at tiger swarm *, 
  #rules are mea n't to be bacon !, 
  you 'll never take me alive !, 
  * running intensifies *, 
  here 's the better version, 
  dern sure is ... 
  i 'm in tears, 
  does that mean that plague is scorpion ? 
  because it 's funny hahaha and not at all a shitpost hahaha, 
  that was a really fucking flacid pepe ree ... you okay man ? 
  is this the new wrong turn movie ? 
  feet are disgusting ... good riddance , i say . 
  he 's basically shia labeuf right now . 
  ca n't miss him . 
  hannibal is a good example . 
  now i have to listen to the whole thing . 
  i did n't find any time-space residue juice in tiger poop here in the vents ... so they 're not eaten . 
  probably . 
  what about limbs ? 
  whole corpses are hard to come by in the vents .
