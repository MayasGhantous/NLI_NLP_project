  this is the one, 
  off to a rollicking good start,

  i am conflicted ... but i will do as you ask, 
  like the serious sam headless kamikaze ? 
  [ * flashbacks * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydxieo-2c2m ), 
  those are some shit tier memes from 10 years ago . 
  no dank memes or even a single pepe, 
  what was the thing lawrence did for the game that crashed ? 
  and does it work with other games ? 
  i need to know . 
  teens react is worse than pewdiepie in my opinion . 
  but elders react is alright .

  i will never accept fefe into my life, 
  that fucking shit was golden . 
  and when dean showed up ... have n't laughed like that in a while, 
  i do n't know much about the mgs story but i know it 's hype and shit ... what are those sick rocks coming out of his head ? 
  i do n't know if i want it to be super good or super bad . 
  they already think humans expand too rapidly . 
  i would n't just let them explore a whole new galaxy on their own . 
  that 's what i thought . 
  i love when games reflect morality with scars , horns etc. 
  i like bro team 's idea . 
  `` just show people having intercourse * drinks * '', 
  #don ' t forget about pel\u00e9 !, 
  tehre are a lot of french people talking, 
  pls join us . 
  i feel drunk but i dont drink http://www.twitch.tv/broteam, 
  ghost recon looks cool tho, 
  i know but some of the moments were priceless . 
  like when they basically announced early access for xb1 and dean hall showed up with dayz ... 
  i lost my shit . 
  `` i want a game that is n't a game ... '' and that 's why it 'll never be finished . 
  d. . . d. . . do you play vidya ? 
  did n't you wan na know that girls were touching his face ? 
  so ... diamo basically hijacked the caboose ? 
  looks like it 's based on dmc,

  [ * stares at the hive , awaiting a response * ] ( http://imgur.com/dukvgw8 ), 
  is it just rt or is funhaus involved too ? 
  such a wonderful place, 
  getting a celldweller vibe from the lyrics . 
  fucking love it, 
  i wonder if ex ig were the only guys on youtube to complete it . 
  damn ... how did i miss that, 
  sounds like something from monstercat . 
  awesome, 
  rip, 
  that 's the same thing i always say about him . 
  i wish s'oggyballs was a mod . 
  thank mr. skeltel for good calcium, 
  there is probably some dude doing it right now and he 's gon na post it in the far future on reddit . 
  about tree fiddy, 
  he was getting ready to jump . 
  that pillow is basically ruined . 
  i 'm not sure about that spike in the middle but i love the rest of the design . 
  that 's what uncensor patches are for . 
  i meant that it might be a bit uncomfortable to - ... wait ... *** two *** spikes ?!, 
  thank based shadbase, 
  i think mystery is good . 
  but a few bits and pieces of new lore could n't hurt tho . 
  i agree with adam . 
  assassin 's creed scarface would be the hypest shit ever, 
  man , spiders is getting better and better with each release . 
  but they should really work on their combat . 
  [ ... who ? 
  like skyrim with guns . 
  it 's alright . 
  you whack ~ ~ macho man ~ ~ dragons 'n shit with weapons . 
  if you 're into fantasy stuff , try a dragon dildo . 
  that 's hot, 
  i do too . 
  probably cuz of earthwalker . 
  the band that does the cooler thing is cooler . 
  in my case it 's capture . 
  i love japanese metalcore . 
  and i still think hiro looks like andy sixx, 
  vegas ai n't that complicated .
