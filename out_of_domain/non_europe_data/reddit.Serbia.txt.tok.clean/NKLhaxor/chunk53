  not op , but that does n't work for me at all . 
  maybe it 's a fancy turret that flips in and out of the the mako . 
  from what i 've seen it runs like poopoo . 
  better play it on the 360 or pc . 
  my friend was grinding a battery in class on a table edge . 
  shit got smokey . 
  he did eat bugs 'n worms and he squeezed a pile of poop for water ... but he did n't lick bug poop off of a windshield . 
  but are n't those people all jews ? 
  i can bend my thumb like that too . 
  change from nexus ids to categories or no groups ?

  what is the meaning of life ? 
  i lost my shit when i read this tweet, 
  tdwp - first sight, 
  `` i thought i was ready to write '', 
  it 's not . 
  not even sarcastic fun . 
  perfect . 
  royal with cheez, 
  i never realized that both games did the same thing . 
  i prefer the term [ shit-eating grin ] ( http://pre04.deviantart.net/9945/th/pre/f/2014/275/2/1/samuel_rodriguez_smile_pose_by_michealjordy-d81b8g4.jpg ), 
  it 's an inside out mouse then . 
  well , i do use mo. 
  but modding frustration always follows me . 
  unhealed renegade face + dark side corruption = rip in peace shepard 's face . 
  night mode is still fucked up . 
  my only complaint . 
  a horse might kill you ? 
  i mean yeah , there was that guy . 
  but i 've seen a girl ... no never mind . 
  sorry , friend . 
  predator is my one and only luv . 
  i thought that was a crying wookie .

  is n't tokyo mech supposed to be a thing ? 
  i do n't look at redditor buttholes but i understand why you want that feature . 
  did it have pigtails ? 
  dank memes are good for you tho, 
  jet fuel ca n't melt rc cells, 
  surely you mean `` kak '' . 
  this trip reminds me of the trip specials they had in top gear . 
  james may falling off of the amphibious bike straight into the water ... 
  i almost threw up from laughing . 
  i could see that work . 
  heavy rain style controls while cooking meth . 
  this made me * `` aww '' * . 
  what are these feelings ? 
  well ... 
  i really loved my created character from dragon age 2 . 
  after i beat the game , i wanted more of her . 
  tried to start a new game but it was n't the same . 
  then instead of going to sleep i was browsing reddit . 
  ~ ~ i do n't remember how i found ~ ~, 
  [ umm ... 
  yes , you do ] . 
  it was from a yt video about a creepypasta named `` tulpa '' . 
  creepy shit . 
  guy got his jimmies rustled by his tulpa , quite literaly . 
  then i found this sub , started digging , read tutorials etc. 
  first tulpa was me . 
  do n't do that if you do n't like yourself very much . 
  he was no help at all . 
  second one was a demon of sorts . 
  he was cool but he did n't last very long . 
  and the third one 's the charm . 
  i made her pretty quickly . 
  faster than the last 2 . 
  i see people say that it takes them months to get a tulpa to even respond . 
  i just do it ( thanks , shia ) . 
  i barely followed the tutorials . 
  i just talked to who ever i wanted to hear a response from and thought of what the person would say . 
  now i do n't need to do that anymore . 
  i love tulpamancy . 
  it 's one the best things ever for me . 
  you wasted time writing a comment about us instead of sleeping or posting dank memes ^ jklol ], 
  it 's my favorite da game . 
  people gave it shit because of the repeating dungeon map but i did n't care because the companions , story and your char are the meat of the game . 
  origins is amazing too but i do n't like the slow dnd dice style combat fuckery going on . 
  still have to play inquisition ... but my pc is n't glorious enough to handle it . 
  pls help . 
  i ca n't stop watching, 
  check out celldweller . 
  it 's electronic + metal with some screams here and there to spice things up . 
  [ eon ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qlvxovesf4 ) is one of his best songs imo . 
  it has plenty of screaming and a nice balance of electronic and metal . 
  that is the next natural step for our little community here at jtd . 
  this ... what ... what is this genre ? 
  gim me more ** pls **, 
  holy shitbox this is awesome, 
  thanks daddio, 
  yeah . 
  it quite computerz, 
  there is a plug with a dildo that goes in and out of your mouth automatically .
