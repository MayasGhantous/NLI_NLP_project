  you 're good at dodging questions . 
  best lawrence art in za warudo !, 
  and i 'm blind, 
  yeah , no shit . 
  saw him the other day in the forest dome lk-6 on all fours chasing an intern . 
  not really related to those 2 topics but is pretty cool . 
  and weird . 
  / r/glitch _ in_the_matrix . 
  played through both games multiple times . 
  prototype 2 is the 1st game i completed 100 % . 
  but activision be like `` nope . 
  fuck you . 
  it did n't make enough money . 
  shows ' over '', 
  he got really angry when i tried to snatch it . 
  a lot of crew interaction . 
  i did not c cena cumming, 
  here 's the [ sauce ] ( http://imgur.com/sz5bqdv ) & [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzf6h0cv4a ), 
  you 're a good porn search engine . 
  kudos for that , at least . 
  where da bones at doe ? 
  rip in peace, 
  crossfaith is pretty energetic live . 
  all of them have big gaming channels . 
  but they also play games on this channel and mostly fuck around . 
  the ninja guy is rolling in cash . 
  you need to be entertaining , original and lucky . 
  they all started around 2008 or so . 
  now the scene is flooded with pewdiepie wannabees . 
  see the reactions . 
  i love / r/childfree . 
  babies are stupid idiots, 
  me too, 
  i 'd like more humanoid bosses with sword fights . 
  and more interesting enemies . 
  i really dislike the scarecrows . 
  she 's probably watching porn . 
  and slenderman . 
  and gaben the hutt . 
  does n't not : ~ ], 
  mostly in the manga tho, 
  cornglaturbations !, 
  dynasty may cry sounds like something i would love to play . 
  what kind of music would you put in ? 
  i would probably shoot myself if they went with the classic movie-like drum music . 
  i do n't know about dmc 1 and 2 but i enjoyed 3 the most . 
  4 is a bit underwhelming . 
  and dmc ... 
  i like combichrist so it was pretty cool . 
  i 'd like celldweller or blue stahli for dmc5 . 
  both are a good mix between electronic and metal . 
  i * think * it 's avp2 ( could be the original ) . 
  you start as a facehugger and you have to facehug a guard that 's sleeping on duty . 
  must 've been incediary rounds . 
  i can hear the burn sizzling, 
  the lack of dogs is honestly surprising, 
  you can get it on gog and * maybe * steam . 
  gog actually gave out free copies of avp1 and had multiplayer servers running a few months ago . 
  the servers could be for both games , so try that out too . 
  it 's fun . 
  emo peter best peter, 
  someone 's tulpa screamed at them in their ld recently . 
  so there 's that . 
  billy, 
  the only thing i know about 2 is that it 's not very good and the demon tank . 
  i just remembered . 
  there is a guy in dw that is similar to vergil . 
  he does the slash , slash , sheath , everybody dies . 
  and one of his combos is vergil 's dt combo a. 
  that super hard slash at the end . 
  he 's not as cool tho ... 
   riff raff, 
  alright . 
  ok . we 're done now . 
  submissions closed . 
  who needs emotions when you have good bones and calcium ? 
  thank mr skele-kun, 
  warframe is a good example actually . 
  it fits in that game but i 'd hate that music in dmc . 
  also , fun fact : both bands are one man bands . 
  if you 're going to check them out listen to celldweller eon and bluestahli ultranumb . 
  those are one of their best songs . 
  it 's a joke by the way . 
  pls get something cooler, 
  do n't mind those normies drinking beer . 
  what a hero, 
  of course a gaylord would choose a girly weapon instead of a chainsaw or just blowing yourself up . 
  ** miraak ** : * and so the first dragonborn meets the last dragonborn at the summit of apocrypha . 
  no doubt just as - *, 
  ** miraak ** : * uh ... 
  w-what ? 
  ** dragonborn ** : * fus ! ... 
  i know that it is . 
  but it 's an addiction . 
  i ca n't stop watching and he ca n't stop oppening them . 
  at least it 's not just one type of case . 
  * bang *, 
  ** lee ** : hella good shot , clem !, 
  if my pc dies , i die . 
  there are a lot of pop ups on their site .
