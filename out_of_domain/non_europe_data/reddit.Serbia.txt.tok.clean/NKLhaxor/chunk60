  ** what ** was you plan , guy from twitter ? 
  it was deep in / r/4chan, 
  i second that prototype post . 
  and ... hatred was released recently so there 's that . 
  skyforge is in beta right now . 
  it 's an mmo with dynamic combat or whatever that means . 
  it 's fun and it looks pretty . 
  [ space rangers 2 hd ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/214730/ ) . 
  it 's one of the best games i 've ever played . 
  it 's a turn based ( but it does n't really feel like it is ) space combat game . 
  you 've got the coalition & pirates on one side fighting each other . 
  and on the other side the dominators . 
  3 types of super space robots that are conquering the galaxy . 
  not the whole game is in space . 
  there are 3 other * games * in sr2 hd . 
  there is an rts mode where you try to retake a base on a planet ( this happens mostly after you retake a dominator controlled system ) . 
  the bots are also customizable , so you 'll have to think before sending them into battle . 
  and there are also the text quests . 
  ( example : when you kill a lot of civilians in space , races will become hostile and will try to shoot you down or force you to land on a planet . 
  and when you do , you 'll be taken to the text quest where you try to survive jail time . 
  you can try to escape straight out of the prison bus or just wait . 
  and escape later . 
  it 's really fun . ), 
  and for a russian game it 's well translated . 
  the third one is the arcade style shooter when you enter a black hole . 
  every weapon will have a different effect and pattern . 
  when you kill the enemies you can get a random weapon or equipment part or something more rare . 
  like an artifact that makes another black hole . 
  or maybe a future weapon that nobody has yet . 
  the weapon and ship technology will constantly evolve . 
  the other rangers will gain medals and get higher on the rank list . 
  the military , pirates and 3 types dominators will fight for the systems . 
  you are a ranger and your job is to stop the dominators . 
  you can be an asshole and rob & kill civilians or be a hero which the galaxy needs . 
  and the music ?!, 
  you 're a cool guy in space and you kill space robots . 
  or maybe it 's the pirate life for you . 
  you can go to jail , play text quest , play a decent rts game or go into a black hol / hyperspace and shoot jank looking ships . 
  are we havin ' a deathmatch ? 
  shhh !, 
  you 're ghostin ' us motherfucker !, 
  * returns into the bush *, 
  and he has a decently sized youtube channel ... 
  time to put on a new flair i guess . 
  the train crash ruined it for me . 
  pls no abandoned warehouse, 
  i 'm not that far into the game but so far there was nothing that blew me away , story wise . 
  and i 've also been playing nwn2 and poe so you probably get the idea . 
  i do n't know if there are dialogue choices later in the game . 
  so far it 's been like this . 
  mediocre voice actor offers you a quest , * press spacebar to introduce yourself and ask what the problem is * ( no voice acting for you character or any sort of dialogue text ) , quest guy says some shit , * press spacebar to finish *, 
  hahahhaaabrrr44444 % % % 44,

  and code geass is the best . 
  i hate/love naruto but i 'm still keeping up with it . 
  when will the torture end ? 
  overlord is cool . 
  i recommend angel blade . 
  a girl shoots a lazor out of her dick at another girl . 
  in a church . 
  both are japanese and not very big outside japan ( i think ) . 
  nocturnal bloodlust and falilv . 
  they 're not the best shit ever but i like them . 
   tfw someone ayys back at you outside of / r/ayylmao, 
  a masterpiece . 
  the name is the other way around by the way . 
  i loved the brother in it . 
  the best part was when he grabbed tomoko 's face and squeezed super hard . 
  i do that too to my sister ... aahhh ... 
  it is very gay if the balls touch and you lose gains if you arrive in the butthole . 
  ahh ... it 's not that great tbh ... the squid just moves around slowly and it looks weird . 
  which is the same thing the girl does . 
  it 's way better with a tube and eels . 
  take it easy ... here is a karma point , a doot , 5 danks and 25 memes, 
  this one ? 
  i ca n't believe i 've never heard of them before . 
  i just yesterday listened to neverbloom and the hype tore me apart . 
  so fucking good . 
  i posted on that thread so i found it in my profile [ `` comments '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/user/nklhaxor/comments/ ) thingy, 
  i hope someone sends them a limp bizkit cd . 
  pat hates music . 
  i like electronic shit like dubstep and celldweller . 
  and metalcore . 
  unfortunately not . 
  but you can pretend it was him . 
  joey is who i meant . 
  he looks like he did n't sleep for days and his hair is ... 
  i really do n't know . 
  i 'd say it 's really * anime * but i 've seen crazier better looking anime hair . 
  here 's a code that i tried to cheese to get double premium lol . 
  it did n't let me . 
  so here you go .
