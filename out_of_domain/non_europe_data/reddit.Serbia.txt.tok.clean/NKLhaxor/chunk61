  you 're a good op , op . 
  hey its me ur ... that does n't work like that . 
  no , it 's perfect . 
  nope . 
  do n't even remember what that was aboot or which sub . 
  i can send you a funky video tho, 
  summoning huge asteroids before fading out of the ld . 
  both roads to e3 . 
  my absolute favorite part was when jordan got the car got stuck in the middle of buttfuck nowhere and aleks almost pooped himself . 
  what a bunch of party poopers . 
  i decided to give you 2 videos, 
  spend 30mins tweaking the mcm menus . 
  pizza is awesome and i believe everybody should be able to eat it . 
  he should read it first . 
  i 'm not the type that usually says `` read the manga '' since i prefer anime but ... it 's so much better . 
  ca n't wait for the ep . 
  i love this theme . 
  i 've said it before and i 'll say it again , it reminds me of celldweller and i fucking love celldweller . 
  well ... not really learning but before i listened to metalcore i did n't pay much attention to the instruments . 
  i mainly listened to vocals . 
  now i actively listen to everything , drums , guitar , bass , keyboard , background fuckery etc. 
  metal and stuff became much more enjoyable . 
  is cortana supposed to be silent ? 
  i used the upgrade tool and it worked flawlessly . 
  went from 8.1 pro to 10 pro . 
  it 's activated . 
  and all my stuff is here too . 
  one man band . 
  metal + electronic . 
  and some screaming here and there to spice it up a little . 
  [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/-qlvxovesf4 ) song is n't really about space but it 's one of his best . 
  that part was really fucky . 
  i tried so much stuff that i do n't even remember which solved the problem . 
  it was probably kmspico . 
  i wish i could still enjoy it . 
  it 's just a grind right now . 
  i 've had my fun with it . 
  i played a lot during the early beta . 
  i tried 3 times to get back into it again . 
  i just ca n't get the stupid kubrow egg . 
  and my 2nd warframe is too weak . 
  and i need resources to make a better warframe but i need to play higher level stuff ... 
  i 'm done . 
  i really like it but i still prefer discoveries . 
  i did n't like the screams at first but they grew on me . 
  i also like the new rot a lot more . 
  they recently did a remix of a celldweller song . 
  check it out on his channel . 
  * burp * huh ? 
  woah ... 
  that 's actually the final form of the borutogan . 
  yeah !!!, 
  ok ... what the fuck is erotic violance actually ... * 1 google search later *, 
  ** ffffff ** uck you konami, 
  i think the game was supposed to be single player or was connected to one somehow . 
  i think it 's dark sector, 
  i would listen to a creatures version of hollywood undead . 
  colorado undead ... 
  there 's now way that we 're not getting dmc5 now . 
  i ate them . 
  i thought they were free . 
  you can be a green buu, 
  can we get an ama , sir ? 
  you can get a staff , stick or something like that . 
  no swamp . 
  i started cheating and modding skyrim before i entered riverwood . 
  i always love the idea of a character going bad . 
  and more sword fight bosses would be amazing . 
  also ... best case scenario - vergil gets his campaign too . 
  it 's * shepard * by the way and it looks good for 1st time . 
  this is win10 by the way, 
  i. ... ca n't read . 
  i love what spencer did at the end . 
  nah , the lights were out . 
  + / u/user _ simulator / u/nklhaxor, 
  here are the lyrics he was refering to . 
  around 1:15 . 
  ch-ch-ch-chewie and ** fuck ** face, 
  wow . 
  i was expecting another shitty skin tight michael retexture . 
  i really like 'em in [ tdwp 's war ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfiauiyf4ds ), 
  my new favorite band . 
  - dead choir, 
  - seven, 
  - forever west, 
  i 've got it covered . 
  i have a few dozen cages filled with trained \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 . 
  their natural enemy . 
  well ... 
  i did n't really get to eat them properly . 
  i had a few bites but the rest got eaten by the tyrannorats . 
  i do n't remember seeing a single penny in the facility . 
  yep . 
  that 's why i 'm going to try out some new mines on them . 
  i already posted a warning so people can stay away from the places that are going to be littered with mines . 
  nothing bad can happen to me . 
  i 'm the hero in my own life . 
  king 810 's `` memoirs of a murderer '' is pretty much about killing and stuff . 
  baneposting at it 's best . 
  i do n't think i can handle all this hype mashed together .
