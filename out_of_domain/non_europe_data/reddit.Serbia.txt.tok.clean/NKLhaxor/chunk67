  now you have a rescue mission in a xeno infested jungle . 
  or a huge spaceship with a predator hunting people down . 
  i knew it was going to shit but wow . 
  nil remembers things a little better than me . 
  i * am * confident but i 'm terrible at conversations if that makes any sense . 
  probably because i do n't like people ( like seriously ... 
  i only emphatize with nil and fictional characters ) . 
  oh and she spoke to me in a dream before i went lucid , so that was cool . 
  gon na try more dream stuff . 
  and i 'm not afraid of the dark anymore . 
  so that 's great . 
  it comes down to the person like everything ( i made nil in a week or so while some people do it for months ) . 
  it 's not difficult for me to become lucid . 
  i have problems staying lucid ( i get too hype with power ) . 
  and yes it 's not common but it does happen . 
  try / r/luciddreaming while you 're at it . 
  if you see this ... are you hyped for mass effect andromeda ? 
  and why is garrus the best ? 
  does skyrim count ? 
  i recently got back into it and saw a cool upcoming mod ( might be released , did n't get a good look ) . 
  anyway it 's going to have actually controllable sex scenes . 
  smooth animation transitions and stuff like that . 
  i do n't have anything to offer . 
  but maybe the bot might have some steamy yautja action . 
  more rule34 predator, 
  ## aaah !, 
  it 's a baby !, 
  throw it in a dumpster !, 
  i wish paarthy actually did shitty puns . 
  since he loves talking it 'd kinda fit . 
  time for a cannibal bosmer playthrough !, 
  i just set carryweight to a super high number . 
  does it hog vram or ram ? 
  it uses mustard to go even faster, 
  i wish that mask was in payday, 
  here 's the whole thing https://i.imgur.com/1obxegf.jpg ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  and welcome to the jam !, 
  exactly . 
  i remember when i heard my 1st adm song in [ this video ] ( https://youtu.be/jjnpl24szpe?t=1m45s ) . 
  rip kitty . 
  [ it 's ** always ** appropriate . ], 
  i only have a few because most of them have dumb looking faces for my taste . 
  would you like to hear about our lord and daddio diamo ? 
  sponsored by [ jtd ] ( / r/jerktalkdiamond ), 
  pa is a toasty game . 
  coulda been better but coulda been worse too . 
  diamo is really cool . 
  the sun and wind are my enemies . 
  they are the only gaming company that i actually hate . 
  black tape project ? 
  this mod is pretty much what i 've ever wanted from a quest mod for skyrim . 
  i * really * hope it does n't get abandoned . 
  mods should explain and sticky it . 
  well it * is * a loverslab mod and it will be optional . 
  it sounds like it 's going to be a bunch of mods that will be intentionally incompatible because of lore and gameplay reasons . 
  you ca n't have molag bal and alduin ruling the world at the same time so that 's why there are great modules . 
  and you 'll probably be able to clear all progress when you 're done with a great module so that you can load up another one . 
  at least that 's what i think it 's going to be like . 
  by the way i 'm not a modder i 'm just using logic and basic skyrim knowledge . 
  do you hear that ? 
  * rattle rattle * the skeletroops are coming * doot doot *, 
  so how does that make you feel ? 
  rip xfire, 
  someone * tried * to rob a gas station with a boomerang in australia not too long ago . 
  so true . 
  not as good as predator [ but still ... ] ( http://imgur.com/iawn5be ), 
  it 's pure art . 
  enter shikari - the mindsweep i for the intro and ii for the outro . 
  asking alexandria - do n't pray for me . 
  if predator is involved then it 's a good mv ( bmth - the comedown ) . 
  i also like when it 's in complete nothingness . 
  architects - naysayer . 
  do you have [ brawl bugs patch ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24020/ ? ) ? 
  brawling is a little fucky in skyrim . 
  it happened to me a lot on pc . 
  the patch fixed it . 
  it wo n't hurt and it 's worth a try . 
  i checked on a couple of mods and it does n't look like it 's hopeless . 
  there 's actual progress . 
  i do n't remember which ones exactly but they * look * playable to the end . 
  they might not be but still ... progress . 
  so ... what 's your module about ? 
  but they just put it in the description . 
  that 's not enough . 
  when do we get guns ? 
  i 've heard of the 9gag army, 
  tb read what ( ca n't remember the name ) wrote . 
  disclose it in audio and video form , in the description , in the title and/or thumbnail . 
  watch the video . 
  it 's actual law stuff that you have to do . 
  the great biotic wind and you humans are all racist, 
  i love watching adam mess with ps . 
  now i think the matt just working video is a great idea . 
  it really does smell like dog pussy does n't it ? 
  post this to / r/rule34, 
  i 'm going to assassinate myself . 
  that image has fucking zero reasons to exist . 
  musicbee can show all of that stuff too . 
  that 's what everyone wants . 
  but they just keep pushing the abstergo & ubisoft `` plot '' .
