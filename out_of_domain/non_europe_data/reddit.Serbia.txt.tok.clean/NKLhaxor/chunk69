  i love the sound of japanese . 
  i never said that i understood it . 
  i know a few dozen words that i hear often in anime , movies , music and games . 
  it makes me think of wet panties . 
  i do n't think that 's sexy at all .

  btw that is liam from it 's always sunny . 
  diamo knows him very well . 
  edit : and by that i mean that they drunk milk together . 
  nothing sexual . 
  when he did the sword spineroo taunt ... holy shit . 
  sounds pretty gay . 
  sounds like a plan . 
  if we had croppy awards i would give you the shittiest crop award . 
  what we need is not hatred or party hard ... what we need is an american psycho or mr. brooks game ... yeah ... 
  that was a beautiful story ... 
  excuse me ...

  hardcore `` dancing '' is just flailing your limbs around like an idiot . 
  i did n't find it enjoyable at all . 
  i hate the mc and his girl . 
  people say that the music is good but i hate the op and did n't notice anything special about the background tracks . 
  never listened to tpiy but ** holy fuckbuckles ** .

  and / r/unexpectedcena, 
  cena is one of the poster boys of wwe . 
  has a positive message `` never give up '' , * cool * motto `` hustle . 
  loyalty . 
  respect . '', 
  & `` u ca n't c me '' ( i call him invisiblessed because of that one ) .
