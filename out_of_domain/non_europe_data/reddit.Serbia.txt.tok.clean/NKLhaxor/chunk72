  and take the image you see see ( the wall ) and put your tulpa there . 
  just imagine the whole thing in your head . 
  do n't know if that helps . 
  just like shia said . 
  just do it . 
  yeah it may sound stupid but that 's how it has to be . 
  at least while you 're making your tulpa . 
  i never played a paradox game before but i 'm hyped for stellaris . 
  what is the `` classic paradox grand strategy experience '' like ? 
  i did try the console . 
  but it says `` unbind soul was not added to characternamehere '', 
  i tried additem and addspell commands . 
  and there is no spellbook . 
  bats 'n interns ... 
  i had to [ redacted ] them . 
  it was messy . 
  a power ( i think ) . 
  i forgot about that command . 
  i 'll try it later when i get back on my pc . 
  so what you 're sayin ' is ... you 're a faggola ? 
  wait ... you 're not the bot ? 
  best guy . 
  nope did n't work . 
  gon na go back to the past with the mod that fixes the things, 
  i do n't remember what happened in the dream but here is saeko . 
  get into lucid dreaming . 
  rip the spine out of the cockblockers and get funky with the girl . 
  and if the dream starts collapsing at least summon an asteroid . 
  that way you go out with a bang . 
  well ... that 's the way i do things . 
  i think that actually happens in the anime, 
  they do n't know the power of lucid dreaming, 
  last year 's road to e3 was pretty hype .

  `` i 'm so powerful ... my hands are made out of leather . '', 
  yyyy, 
  this is what i 've wanted . 
  tdwp , phinehas and if what shomo said is true the i can add beartooth to the list . 
  as for other genres : celldweller and behemoth . 
  bread is overrated imho . 
  the logo ?

  i do n't think we 're seeing the same picture here . 
  maniac .

  de termul drill go git it, 
  check out mr robot . 
  it 's the same guy . 
  i 'm seeing a masterpiece of engineering magic here filled with complex algorithms and spiders . 
  the memes are on ... 
  wew lad now you 're crossing the line, 
  i use kickass , metaltracker and soulseek, 
  enhance, 
  take a look at this https://www.reddit.com/r/sociopath/comments/2ahcpf/the_literal_and_absolute_difference_between_a/, 
  with metal and bullets . 
  and then you put the things where the things go . 
  he may be from the same vampire bloodline as keanu reeves and ~ ~ nic cage ~ ~ our one true god . 
  * puts hands over ears *, 
  i ca n't hear you . 
  * leaves *, 
  give the man a gun and he 'll rob a bank . 
  give the man a marker and he 'll draw a penis . 
  i like the * feels * . 
  also i like chugging . 
  in reasonable amounts , of course . 
  i still listen to metal . 
  not much but stuff like behemoth , cradle of filth and celldweller . 
  time to start chopping off fingers , then . 
  best bowl of dude soup yet . 
  i would * probably * die . 
  nice yyyy , friend . 
  had to resubmit because i messed up the formatting . 
  do n't know the source . 
  if it 's still free by then . 
  that was a thing actually ... 
  it was called onlive but it was n't very good . 
  it was way too early . 
  and the words you 're looking for is `` streaming '' . 
  it 's gon na happen again eventually but it 'll be better . 
  probably . 
  i think sony bought their tech but i might be wrong . 
  and there will definitely be something else in the future . 
  you can already do that from home . 
  pc to nvidia shield is one example . 
  they need to fix latency problems and the video itself . 
  because you 're sending inputs to another device across the world the video will look really compressed and delayed . 
  check out / r/unexpectedcena, 
  it works when you use an extension that renames it to something else . 
  the new nmm feature that will let you download all the same mods as someone else sounds really good right now . 
  twau was my favorite ttg game . 
  now it 's tfb . 
  it 's fucking great .
