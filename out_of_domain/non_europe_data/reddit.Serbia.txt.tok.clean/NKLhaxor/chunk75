  the 2nd part of the anime shit the bed tho . 
  yeah . 
  i liked that kaneki was still involved but i tuned out when they hit that ghoul theater and that nut buster lady ( wat ? ) . 
  might pick it up later . 
  just like that time when that / r/anime bathing scene post reached / r/all, 
  the only way to react imo, 
  the guy that was splooshing over kaneki ? 
  [ shomotooth - i have a problem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn_x7ibspjy ) it 's super hype, 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09ltt0xwdfw ) ? 
  sorry though . 
  i do n't really know anything like that . 
  make them suffer and beartooth, 
  ai640 , make them suffer - neverbloom or phinehas - till the end, 
  i bet they crashed pepe, 
  people do n't think like they are , but they do, 
  and disgusting, 
  i wonder if they have memes ... 
  skyrim is one of my favorite games but it kinda sucks that the `` loads to do '' always leads to draugr/necromancer infested caves or tombs . 
  what is the mini campaign gon na be about ? 
  i hope it 's still my character from hk cuz i 'm still thirsty for the aftermath story . 
  perfect . 
  i feel like they 're gon na do the ancient language for a little bit then they 're gon na go full on troy baker . 
  i just watch/read it for centorea/rachne . 
  such is life when you 're wojak, 
  the table scene was a masterpiece of modern anime !, 
  how about some [ amaranthe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrb60_wfxfq ) ? 
  i think these would be better if everyone posted a comment with a link to the song, 
  i will always be salty about that . 
  curved . 
  that * actually * happened once . 
  there 's a thread on / r/tifu about it, 
  wake me up inside, 
  ( i ca n't wake up ), 
  wake me up inside, 
  ( save me ), 
  call my name and save me from the dark, 
  now i got ta load up on symph metal torrents, 
  ca n't find my emo metalcore music . 
  why even live, 
  / r/anime _ irl, 
  bmth - sempiternal , phinehas - till the end ( well ... `` coup d'\u00e9tat '' is the only meh song on it imo cuz it sounds out of place ) , ai640 , make them suffer - literally all of their stuff . 
  do n't know if it 's right but ... 
  it worked for me . 
  i just winged it . 
  i love seeing people getting salty about that . 
  i seriously get salty about predator . 
  it 's 3:10 am and i 'm watching a bro stream . 
  what was that show called ? 
  [ upon this dawning ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdh_dfrmgw ) has some of that . 
  but you could try some symphonic metal, 
  yeayeayea these guys are super hype, 
  the eye of the shitstorm, 
  what was the frame rate talk about ? 
  they always get mentioned in these threads . 
  but they 're writing new stuff . 
  full on fire in your face mage . 
  none of that sneaky shit . 
  i dunno skullface sounds cool, 
  curse you , vile trickster !, 
  i wish i could stop the time right now to decide . 
  nope . 
  does n't work . 
  i do n't know how people rewatch stuff so many times . 
  i have literally nothing to do or to play and i ca n't finish a 10 episode series for half a year . 
  is that shooty mcbowlcut ? 
  [ mrw people downboat stuff on jtd ] ( http://imgur.com/d4dcsch ), 
  that 's matt pe / \\ ke aka our lord . 
  i 'm not a nerd , shut up . 
  got ( i 've seen like 1ep ) , daredevil , mr. 
  robot and house of cards . 
  maybe there is something i 've forgotten . 
  oh yeah ... there 's also my huge anime list that i 'm also barely watching . 
  sharks . 
  you 're opressing me !, 
  i can worship 2 entities !, 
  miraak has some pretty nifty powers . 
  he can command dragons to give their soul to him , his boss is a lovecraftian tentacle monster and he looks cool . 
  ( has n't he joined and then later betrayed the dragon cult ? 
  maybe i 'm remembering it wrong . ), 
  db needed help to defeat alduin . 
  i think miraak is still a big threat . 
  of course , miraak is n't an alduin level threat but still pretty dangerous . 
  harkon kinda sucks . 
  ayy nice one , guy . 
  magic . 
  `` vergil , you 's a busta . '', 
  she 's like blue mary ? 
  hype, 
  always back down . 
  or cheat if the 1st option is unavailable . 
  if all else fails . 
  the purge . 
  neat movie, 
   torrent browser, 
  you 're ruining the uprising, 
  when i look at these photoshop posts i expect a lot of funny images . 
  the full package cancer . 
  i have ** special eyes ** !, 
  are you thinking of the tunt cunt fan art from the old channel ? 
  someone drew tunt on the throne thingy .
