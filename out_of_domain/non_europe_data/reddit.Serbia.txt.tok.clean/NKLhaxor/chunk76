  sempiternal always makes me feel like shit . 
  great album tho . 
  i ca n't wait for the next album . 
  i hope it 's still connected to the lord of woe . 
  i was also one of those people who were like `` ew what is this . 
  bring back adrian . '', 
  i love node . 
  i love marcus ' vocals and how * `` clean '' * the album sounds . 
  the browning , fail emotions and other bands that have lots of electronic elements . 
  bombastic stuff like breakdown of sanity , make them suffer , ai640 , phinehas , rings of saturn etc. 
  a great man once said `` memes are a means of communication '', 
  just do n't look at it and it 'll be fine . 
  the lore friendly perk descriptions are nice at first but sometimes i had no clue what the hell some of them did . 
  that 's what i 've always wanted . 
  shepard basically becomes the reapers and poof . 
  galactic peace .

  definitely guilty . 
  there was a breakdown at the end . 
  it 's gone now . 
  memes and references aside ... ai640 is my album of the year and i want this to be super good like that . 
  actually never mind . 
  it is ** super fucking good ** . 
  all you need to know is that handsome jack is really cool and that vault hunters are also really cool .
