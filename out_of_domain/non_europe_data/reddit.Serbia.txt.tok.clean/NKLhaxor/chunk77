  nice name/meme, 
  at least it 's better at porn than google . 
  better than fucking rage comics smh tbh, 
  that 's weird . 
  and the fact that it 's weird is a bit sad . 
  it ** should ** work but most of the time it 's the most useless thing ever . 
  pretty mediocre . 
  went to the store and bought chocolate milk . 
  i also drank bad lemonade . 
  i ate twice today and i 'm not hungry right now . 
  it 's almost 11pm . 
  gta san andreas . 
  zero 's rc missions . 
  on pc with a keyboard with a low framerate . 
  story ? 
  tor browser, 
  now that 's my kind of subreddit . 
  that 's weird . 
  jeff is pretty morbid topic imo . 
  or / r/nostupidquestions, 
  mr. bean, 
  i 'd throw knives and steamrollers . 
  and i would do a lot of crazy poses in the frozen time . 
  you probably just black out and that 's it . 
  but what i * want * is to become god in another universe and do whatever the hell i want . 
  that 'd be pretty neat , right ? 
  this is the best . 
  this is kind of a repost but this was posted 3 years ago and i wan na show how cool this guy is now that there are even more people here . 
  anything is a meme if you push it hard enough, 
  yeayeayeayea shadman is super fucking good . 
  not as good as ganassa but still pretty hype, 
  i thought that [ nicolas cage ] ( http://imgur.com/ambw8v8 ) on serbian biology books was weird, 
  any black hole at any point in time . 
  paying money to get special effects , music etc. 
  or cinema exclusive scenes ... jesus fuck that 'd be the most garbage thing ever . 
  then i will take you to many great places , friend . 
  metalcore , super best friends and chicks with dicks !, 
  beartooth . 
  it 's a cool b with a bear tooth next to it . 
  i thought it was just generic metalcore but it 's really good . 
  well ... they did make that controversial shirt . 
  and `` bring a gun to school '' is pretty edgy . 
  and frankie had some beef with some dude . 
  that might be the reason or it might not be everything . 
  band is still hype as fuck tho . 
  celldweller is n't metalcore but i love that he 's putting in some of it 's elements more frequently in his music now, 
  i like them bangs , yo . 
  i still like them bangs tho . 
  bangs are the best . 
  i got tons of pictures with bangs . 
  if i were a girl with bangs i 'd just look in the mirror . 
  and then i 'd ziddle my kittle . 
  well ... 
  i 'm kinda narcissistic so i do n't have that problem . 
  you 're fueling my problem but when i get my own place , i 'll probably do that . 
  gon na go to sleep now . 
  the 1st thing that i came to mind . 
  here is the thing about the beef https://youtu.be/c5v2snt3dcq?t=1m4s, 
  respect the pipe !, 
  they were so young , god dammit !, 
  it 's not fair !, 
  [ breakdown of sanity ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyhfn9px0ak ) ? 
  damn ninja editors, 
  [ bmth - hospital for souls ] ( https://youtu.be/hjosydti38q?t=52s ), 
  do n't forget monty from rooster teeth ... shit sucks, 
  i thought the guy on a leash thing was just a thing in detroit metal city, 
  it 's usually about worshiping * yourself * and satan 's ideals . 
  but that 's just one version of satanism . 
  i think ( ? ), 
  curse you , vile trickster !, 
  try [ one punch man ] ( http://myanimelist.net/anime/30276/one_punch_man ) . 
  opm kills things instantly but other people fight . 
  [ hellsing ultimate ] ( http://myanimelist.net/anime/777/hellsing_ultimate ) has some pretty hype fight scenes too . 
  ca n't wait for [ 2016 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixymfqekcgq ), 
  you should see the devil may cry video, 
  it 's one of my favorites in terms of mc progression . 
  i 'm sure he was clenching in his last moments as well . 
  with the mugen tsukuyomi , madara can make as many filler episodes as he wants . 
  he should dress up as [ john cena ] ( http://share.gifyoutube.com/yjr0dm.gif ) . 
  he does n't cover but he actually makes vg music . 
  right now he 's working on killer instinct . 
  but he did an imperial march cover recently . 
  so that 's cool . 
  [ celldweller ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzbjmcsfcpy ),

  stuff like that . 
  gim me stellaris pls, 
  you 're gon na be enslaving some dumb planet and then boom . 
  cthulhu comes out of a space butthole . 
  that 's super hype . 
  this reminds me of a v/h/s ( name of the movie ) scene . 
  a girl is helping a magician perform . 
  the boyfriend gets his jimmies rustled because of this and hits the girl . 
  then the magician ( also the magician has a mysterious cape that gives him all kinds of powers ) sets up cameras in a room and pulls the boyfriend out of the cape . 
  the boyfriend is all like `` what the fuck is this shit ?! '' .
