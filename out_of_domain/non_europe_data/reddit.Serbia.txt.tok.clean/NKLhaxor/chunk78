  then the magician snaps his wrist , knee and neck by pointing his fingers at him . 
  best part of the movie . 
  vhs 2 ( not vhs viral . 
  but that 's the one with the magcian . 
  i think ) is the best one . 
  i miss aleks saying that, 
  ha ha !, 
  i thought that band was about r. mika . 
  i am disappoint, 
  are you a succubus or do you just really like sex ? 
  / r/ledootgeneration, 
  i kinda want him to dye it red and tie it up like akuma . 
  i beat dmc4se a couple of months ago . 
  then yesterday i beat dmc for the 2nd time . 
  as a game it 's alright i guess . 
  it looks great and combat is fun ( and a lot simpler imo ), 
  but as a * devil may cry * game it feels like fan fiction . 
  i think the original series is better and it shows . 
  i wanted something that sounded * nice * . 
  ~ ~ billy ~ ~ nil . 
  ok , friend ... 
  he said '' * your * memes '' . 
  i 'm pretty sure that means multiple people . 
  do n't be a greedy jew , buddy . 
  i hate when it says `` 5am tomorrow looks good '' when it asks to restart for updates . 
  bitch , you keep your damn mouth shut . 
  dip dip , potato chip . 
  this guy headbangs a lot, 
  klay said that people constantly mess with the wiki page . 
  i think he 's like late 20s or early 30s . 
  or he 's a vampire like keanu reeves and nic cage . 
  yeah i 'm not good with math . 
  but i know a vamp when i see one, 
  lu bu is the scariest motherfucker that ever lived . 
  you ca n't add `` too much '' . 
  it 's not like computer with limited capacity . 
  any chance of a pc port later ? 
  6 tendies for a stale pepe ? 
  posted to / r/cyberbooty because we love this stuff . 
  who the fuck says woot anymore ? 
  also , i got like 1000 fine pepes and / pol / images . 
  it kinda looks like [ northlane 's node ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ab/node_by_northlane.jpg ) . 
  holy crap ... there 's a / \\ in northlane . 
  there 's less cityscapes and more robobutts, 
  my sister listens to mainstream pop stuff but she really liked sempiternal . 
  holy shit jumping from truck to truck is the hypest shit !, 
  and now it 's a game ? 
  yeah but who is the guy in the nene ? 
  thanks , guy . 
  a whole new world . 
  i love when there 's a lot of electronic stuff . 
  [ the browning ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfifng9gj80 ) is amazing at this, 
  it 's just a one off ep but did you hear [ ai640 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-b_tduojoho&amp;list=plszc8qdcwugnxxpvcuj-1hdfsficsrzx_&amp;index=4 ) ? 
  i was joking about the day . 
  i did n't even know . 
  i 'd assassinate myself but i 'm in bed . 
  you should watch it again . 
  it holds up . 
  fucking timeless masterpiece . 
  would it be your stand or just a dream character tho ? 
  idk what subway really is tbh . 
  i only know about that jared guy, 
  does she have tentacles ? 
  did n't think so . 
  a fucking shoryuken in a giant robot . 
  i knew he was gon na betray me from the beginning because , come on ... it 's handsome jack . 
  but i was still pro-jack all the way . 
  i completely forgot about her . 
  rip in piece i guess . 
  i wish swtor was single player . 
  i wan na be an asshole sith alone . 
  you 're an absolute madman . 
  vans seem like really bad luck lately . 
  gear getting stolen and now the van shit itself . 
  if it 's new character i hope they wo n't reuse the same concept . 
  the `` changing this * one * thing fucks up everything '' . 
  also ... 
  i wan na do cool stuff with time powers . 
  like the scene with the beans . 
  i like when a game plays with my dead emotions but i 'd like some fun with abusing powers . 
  can i get some gold pls ? 
  i do n't need it but i want it . 
  i do n't even know what it really does tbh but it sure looks neat . 
  it kinda sucks . 
  it 's not bad but it could 've been much better . 
  there 's no beam struggles , destructible terrain and power levels barely mean anything in this game . 
  also more health , less time , super armor = difficulty in xenoverse . 
  strangling someone is like sex tho . 
  right ? 
  * right ?!, 
  well i do n't have an image but imagine a completely black rebellion with white edges on the blade . 
  it would be a slow swing but it has a moderate aoe and knockback . 
  and powerful ranged attacks with swordmaster . 
  it would work something like this :, 
  ( a - normal attack , b swordmaster attack ), 
  a , a , pause , a ( knockback combo ) , b ( ranged finisher . 
  let 's say the sword summons black lightning strikes that damages and keeps enemies in the air for a moment ), 
  it kinda works like the dynasty warriors combat . 
  i 'd call it blackstar . 
  [ * raises hand * does the big bang count ? ],
