  time for some persona/final fantasy/witcher ! '', 
  [ source ] ( https://youtu.be/tu1mab1jsfy?t=3m43s ), 
  are n't like dolphins ( i know that that is n't a dolphin . 
  just sayin ' cuz it relevent ) super good at sex with humans ? 
  i hate beaches .

  in this case . 
  [ check this out ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/03/malcolm-brenner-dolphin_n_6583016.html ), 
  i recommend thay you do a skyrim for pimps marathon if you have the time . 
  it 's great . 
  most recent game was . 
  beyond two souls . 
  it 's pretty much ellen page : the fantasy . 
  featuring shower and rape scenes ( happens a lot in his games ) !, 
  he also said `` a player 's death is the failure of the game designer '' or something like that . 
  which is like ... what ? 
  his games are basically bad movies with lots of budget . 
  the new game looks neat so i hope he nails it with this one . 
  you 're forgetting about the all caps sequel that nobody likes . 
  lun4 . 
  gsp puts the mods in the description . 
  check there . 
  gsp is the channel that uploaded that video . 
  i posted the source . 
  they listed the mods they used . 
  one finger death punch ? 
  it 's just left and right . 
  no ... thank you , you fuck !, 
  i quicksave at every turn . 
  i have a problem . 
   the man,

  [ this celldweller mini album ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6b6mhh59mi ), 
  does baseball or cunt destroyer apply to small babbies ? 
  a dog house for lydia ? 
  i 'd love that !, 
  * pets inigo beside the fireplace *, 
  game dev tycoon is pretty fun . 
  i made half life 5 and made halo exclusive to the pc . 
  i pretty much owned the market . 
  then i went bankrupt . 
  [ once again ... diamo is on top . 
  watch the language , guy . 
  it 's `` xenomorph '' now . 
  it 's a bro team thing . 
  not a jtd thing . 
  the transport of the creatures is done by a third party . 
  we may have been ripped off . 
  it 's ok , buddy . 
  i 've seen more r34 of tracer than videos or images of the game . 
  these are dank flags . 
  anything goes, 
  listen to me !, 
  now you have to go to the * other * alt dimension and get the other version of the current you and merge again . 
  you do n't simply forget the dark age . 
  that 's the real beginning of the show . 
  depends . 
  do i get to sedate it ? 
  i 'm not ready to sell out yet . 
  it 's easier to be an indie madman . 
  maybe some other time . 
  i dunno why it 's like that . 
  i do n't like it . 
  describe what you want and i will squeeze something out . 
  if you want more skelemetal check out vargskelethor https://vargskelethor.bandcamp.com/ . 
  he * just * released skeleton metal 2 . 
  like an hour ago on his stream . 
  i do n't get it tbh,

  fun fact : i used that image for a quick karma grab in / r/rule34, 
  + / u/user _ simulator / u/nklhaxor, 
  ok that one was fucking great . 
  it used lyrics from a [ song ] ( https://youtu.be/t4rwmcqkola?t=45s ) and then added 2 random things and it rhymed . 
  coc goes in detail with the transformation . 
  you can get dick worms !, 
  how cool is that ? 
  that 's what she gets for wearimg that dumb hat . 
  i love crows but i hate that they shit non stop all over the park when i was a kid . 
  nobody was throwing anything at the crows . 
  they were high up around the trees . 
  * they * were the dicks . 
  i unironically love alone and champion . 
  i actually started with metal . 
  then i got into core because it sounds better to me . 
  i still listen to some behemoth and cradle of filth . 
  also symphonic and industrial but nothing specific . 
  i just like to put it on random . 
  every human being is augmented with a lever . 
  undeath ? 
  you get a lair in a convoluted sewer . 
  tales from the borderlands is the best ttg game i played . 
  i love how he starts screaming before even pulling it at [ 4:15 ] ( https://youtu.be/idzp2ui-u4y?t=4m51s ),

  i love listening to amv bait,
