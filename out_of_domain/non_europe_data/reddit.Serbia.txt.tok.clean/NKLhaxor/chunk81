  this does n't sound bad but it hurts . 
  i had my fun with it . 
  it was good while it lasted . 
  i miss the beta . 
  i 'm not even a huge fan of sw but i believe in this . 
  he 's the character sitting in the background wearing shorts and sandals . 
  `` i did n't win cuz i did n't use the op boss character '', 
  yeah . 
  i get cancer from time to time . 
  mostly on / v / and / pol / . 
  how do you queue ? 
  i feel like an idiot but i ca n't find the option . 
  big wang , long balls ? 
  / r/twobestfriends will help you out with the in jokes and the juicy `` lore '' . 
  like how woolie killed that guy or that time when he stole a pie . 
  6 upshekels for the secret ? 
  you said you were a karma slut but dayum . 
  jesus fucking christ , guy . 
  common misconception ... our brains are inside the skull ... 
  so * we * are inside the skeleton . 
  spooky , right ? 
  honestly i 'm not even mad . 
  this looks like garbage . 
  god dammit . 
  does this kill the kof ? 
  diamo trump . 
  the ultimate mod . 
  i was hoping for `` weeoo weeoo weeoo weeoo weeoo weeoo weeoo weehoohoo '' . 
  but i 'm not disappointed . 
  dae say it like this : we car ? 
  \\  weird green thing, 
  \\  not eating interns, 
  i like their meat well done . 
  delicious . 
  [ ok , guy ... 
  this stuff sounds pretty hype . 
  gim me more . 
  i do n't like you anymore . 
  good day to you , sir ... 
  i do n't think we ate the same type of cardboard . 
  maniac . 
  i live in a foreign part of the facility . 
  never heard of it . 
  [ check this out ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw2btpyhgce ) . 
  i 'm a mod at / r/jerktalkdiamond . 
  you mean [ this ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/blueandorangemorality ) ? 
  we do n't trade pepes at jtd . 
  but here 's a rare one . 
  they are a big mystery to me . 
  i saw this yesterday : some intern was walking out of the mess . 
  about a dozen other interns surrounded him and shanked him . 
  then they proceeded to mark their faces with his blood . 
  they also howled and made other kinds of weird noises . 
  fascinating . 
  well ... [ spoiler ] ( #s `` it 's an alternate timeline so it does n't matter '' ) . 
  i 'm a heartless bastard but i understand . 
  i think . 
  i know what you mean . 
  some pop faster than others . 
  yo , do n't make me call in the jtd mod squad . 
  it 's not as cool as n7 . 
  but it 's alright . 
  i 'm from yurope too and it blows my mind when * kids * fight each other because they like different clubs . 
  do n't be greedy ... 
  i need to research the lore too . 
  basically it 's good/evil and lawful/chaotic ... and ** bacon/necktie ** ( alien morality . 
  humans ca n't understand it . ), 
  gon na be honest . 
  ass stuff is weirder than animal dicks . 
  socks and sandals are a thing here where i live . 
  in the land of serbia, 
  i love making mean faces and growling at them . 
  when i wake up i 'm not depressed but i 'm like `` ahhhh ... god dammit ... now i got ta get up , pee , wash my face ... oh come on !, 
  i 'm also hungry ... fuckin ' hell ... '', 
  i wish i was a robot . 
  i have a succesful/failed ( you be the judge ) experiment . 
  an intern that grows hair really fast . 
  inches per second all over his body . 
  it 's pretty much a mass of hair in a box that 's about to burst open . 
  do you want it ? 
  i do n't get depressed anymore . 
  which is pretty neat . 
  but i do get angry a lot . 
  honestly i wan na be a robot so i can live forever , hook up the internet into my veins and not do human stuff . 
  the internet would be the only thing going in and out of me . 
  because i like the internet and i hate people ? 
  am i depressed but i do n't care about it ? 
  i do n't really care tbh . 
  oh boy , we 're getting deep now . 
  and i do n't think they 'd simply let anyone becone an immortal cyborg . 
  plus there 's overpopulation , dumb moral and ethic stuff . 
  and i bet the religious folk would get really butthurt about it too . 
  i 'll just wait for the * future * . 
  i like to imagine him with jetstream sam 's `` shit eating grin '' . 
  sounds pretty cool . 
  also , vergil seems more like an neutral evil to me . 
  i could n't stand the livestream but i enjoyed this one . 
  in a weird torturous way . 
  i can hear the box cracking . 
  so here it is .
