  it 's not great but it 's a ninja game . 
  scrub does n't use hotkeys, 
  the manga is as hype as the show . 
  do that in the meantime, 
  the ~ ~ most recent ~ ~ 3rd one is poop in my opinion . 
  but they give you some ( * some * ) lelouch scenes if you really like him . 
  shuuuut up old maaaaaan / s, 
  this guy is actually taking moderation seriously !, 
  what a fucking maniac hahaha, 
  i prefer a half blind lp . 
  like ds2 . 
  i tried to start the metalcore wars there . 
  it did n't work out . 
  the core interns and the metal interns fought each other for a few days . 
  then they had a chuggy breakdown and a black metal vocalist summoned demons . 
  they all died shortly . 
  shame . 
  sounded pretty brutal . 
  conscious and well done ( i managed to do it . 
  they ca n't scream though ) . 
  i like to put it on a table and eat it with my creations together . 
  you ca n't ally yourself with the bad guys ? 
  vr needs warnings when stuff like that happens . 
  `` warning : wall/penis nearby '', 
  i have a ** giant ** flying snake that does n't dissolve the stuff it eats . 
  you can fit about 1400 people in there . 
  well ... it could do all of that but it escaped ... 
  if you poke it in the right spot it will puke everything it has inside it . 
  and it 's just a tube of meat . 
  no acid . 
  it might break a few spines when it makes harsh turns but that 's about it . 
  and it 's kinda lazy and old . 
  it would take some time . 
  a [ redacted ] mania ? 
  i ca n't read that . 
  also ... slightly related ... do you remember that time when [ ghosts ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jzvnp9r.jpg ) picked up a giant during the 3rd facilitymania ? 
  wow , these guys are super [ hype ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cznw-wljwga ) . 
  bloody famous people not using their reddit accounts ... 
  man , fuck bob and jim ... fucking assholes sucking tbe fun out of everything, 
  i 'll be careful from now on with my memes ... 
  for you, 
  i wasted an hour on that . 
  did n't know what goes where or which fucking side . 
  ss is skynet, 
  [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/1xmej1pt54s?t=6m1s ) is where they got the idea from, 
  if you 're not into history keep an eye on stellaris . 
  darth cena ^, 
  more rule34 predator, 
  truly we are ... the diamo . 
  whens super top ten of 20xx ? 
  whens this game ?!, 
  cowcaizer high voltage ? 
  what 's it called ? 
  stesuna is the fucking hypest, 
  i know . 
  i played it when i was a baby . 
  i even watched the anime ... 
  i had one . 
  it was an edgelord demon guy . 
  evil for the sake of evil turned out to be annoying and boring . 
  so i killed him off . 
  depending on your view , i 'm the evil one . 
  who 's the blue guy and robo bug , you kikelord . 
  i like when they `` kill '' people . 
  most recently drake and anthony from smosh . 
  i really want a new spore . 
  a better spore ... 
  i hope / r/thrive is going to be that . 
  here 's the whole [ thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/3twsge/b_kills_drake/?ref=search_posts ) . 
  and the other [ one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/3oafmw/101015_the_day_b_killed_smosh/?ref=search_posts ), 
  is the rest of the movie about that kind of stuff ? 
  does this mean that mcu thor is inaccurate ? 
  plague said that he 's the future of humanity in his stream . 
  while getting rejected as a woman fighter in mount and blade . 
  what about a 950 ? 
  it 's not super expensive like the other new nvidia stuff . 
  fun fact : saiyans have multiple dicks . 
  vegeta 's dad has at least 5 . 
  * - team four star *, 
  meanwhile my writing with my dominant left hand and right hand is crap . 
  there 's a mod on fenoxo 's forum that kinda makes it better . 
  it 'll buff out . 
  a 750ti or a 950 ? 
  will my pentium dual core 3.10 ghz bottleneck it ? 
  [ this one , to be precise . 
  ] ( http://ark.intel.com/products/80796/intel-pentium-processor-g3240-3m-cache-3_10-ghz ), 
  i 'd love to be a guard at patshwitz . 
  i love girls , abs , video games , movies and music . 
  i hate the sun , kids , people and animals . 
  the one where you pick a guy up and slam his head on the ground is * basically * john cena 's finisher . 
  i bet stark has a super genius toilet paper mechanism that 's better than the other 2 . 
  he also probably said the opposite of what cap said just to annoy him . 
  anime gods demand sacrifices, 
  he has no scars either ... he must be a monster in a fight . 
  batman is gon na get rekt . 
  having just djj next to the darkside people would be a bit too much , in my opinion . 
  so put the weird guy next to him , so it 's not so obvious . 
  damn , josh looks a lot like and larson . 
  tftb is in my opinion the best ttg game yet . 
  i did n't play a lot of borderlands either but i love it .
