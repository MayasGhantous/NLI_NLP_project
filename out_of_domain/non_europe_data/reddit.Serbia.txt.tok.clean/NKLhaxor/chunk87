  pax, 
  any news from these guys ? 
  new album or ep ? 
  really good . 
  jordan is going to be unboxing csgo crates in hopes to get 3 knives before 2016 . 
  knives are super rare . 
  if he does n't get 3 knives he 's getting a gabe newell tattoo somewhere on his body . 
  luck is what he needs but does n't have . 
  he 's absolutely screwed . 
  to me hype is the new rad . 
  if something makes me go `` holy shit ! '', 
  then it 's hype . 
  if it alright then it 's overhyped or not hype . 
  it 's dynamic . 
  install gentoo, 
  brown solidus snake, 
  i guess bro team was n't the only drunk guy . 
  fixed it . 
  snk please stop you 're hurting yourself . 
  who does n't like a good ol' ylyl ? 
  now they truly are ... the huey, 
  this is the best, 
  seeing lord vader in person for the first time . 
  i keep forgetting how good the other guy 's vocals are, 
  incendiary shots fired, 
  [ it 's so good ] ( http://imgur.com/vjafj7s ), 
  there can only be one ... 
  it 's the same link for me . 
  does stef have an account ? 
  `` so hey guys ... umm i got locked out again . 
  so i 'm here in stef 's office ... '', 
  '' * hands on her face * oh my god jordan ... '', 
  infinite potato, 
  i 've read something about this a while ago so i 'm not % 100 sure . 
  but i think it 's because music is more expensive there or something . 
  so artists put bonus tracks to make up for the price . 
  it 's free stuff and piracy is n't a moral dilemma for me . 
  i 'd rather buy something to eat than a game that millions of other people will buy . 
  i simply do not care about other people . 
  the reason is that i 'm a selfish i guess . 
  i do n't know how to explain it . 
   they 're here too ~ ~ i bet ~ ~ . 
  they 're ~ ~ probably ~ ~ better, 
   ~ ~ not that ~ ~ i 'd know, 
  livestreamed, 
  necromancy is the next big thing !, 
  everyone is doing it !, 
  might be talking about a gigantic person . 
  not just a super dick . 
  honourless ? 
  probably means they will lie , cheat and steal . 
  memes are underrated imo . 
  i 'd rather have a thread full of memes than a desolate wasteland of deleteds and removeds . 
  umm ... is that allowed ? 
  game devs please stop putting memes in games . 
  leave the memes to us . 
  i will cream myself . 
  i recently reinstalled it and fixed the multi core bullshit . 
  we are the [ trashmen ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cbt3vchveaatjb6.jpg ), 
  the graphics are completely fucked on pcs with multi core cpus . 
  when you start the game there is an ocean and weird shapes everywhere . 
  those are some big schlongers, 
  this is the best, 
  it 's post hardcore . 
  that 's how it 's supossed to be . 
  i still want the rest , dammit !, 
  or ... my personal favorite , the cumbox ? 
  if you do n't have a chopping buddy you can use a [ gun ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkgoruwwgrq&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player ), 
  vildhjarta - traces feels like a weird goodbye to the world . 
  ai640 - debate is about a robot with empathy killing humanity but it starts with a kid . 
  i punch my pc to make it stop making those weird fan noises . 
  why 'd you do this ? 
  a lot of people in the djent and core scene look like that . 
  [ my brand !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-fruomifpw ), 
  i think he was the big twist . 
  but i think he 's super dead now . 
  do n't talk to the weird guy . 
  he 's going to offer you `` a piece of asshole '' but do n't do it . 
  he 'll kidnap you and turn your body into tentacles . 
  they said we could make any kind of sci fi thing ... 
  and since we 're talking star wars ... 
  is telekinesis going to be a thing ? 
  he had $ 1000 and he bought a fucking cake ? 
  humanity are overrated imo, 
  you should n't steal pepes , guy . 
  you do n't analyze memes ? 
  more rule34 predator, 
  report them to your nearest imperial officer . 
  i 'm disturbed . 
  is it an action game ? 
  if it is i * think * i know what you 're talking about . 
  but i 'll have to find it first cuz i do n't remember the name . 
  well meme 'd . 
  i am not nice !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ thxbtw,

  i think this is called maladaptive daydreaming . 
  i too would become a toilet because all i would have to do is zone out and think about the hypest adventures while someone pees on me . 
  \\  not wanting to be immortal,
