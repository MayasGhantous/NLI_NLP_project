  ok screw that . 
  i 'd rather have someone pull out their gun on me . 
  [ rise of the argonauts ? 
  ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/12770/?snr=1_7_7_230_150_1 ) it 's the only thing i can think off . 
  check under the mythology or some other tag you might think is relevant . 
  how old is it ? 
  you 're the emobatman ? 
  h-how are your memes ? 
  i saw a post about your sub on le [ jtd ] ( / r/jerktalkdiamond ), 
  the ultimate waifu mod has been made . 
  http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71864/ ? 
  you get the perfect band for the 14 year old girl . 
  glad you rike it . 
  more aliens for us . 
  wage war ? 
  while she sleeps and oh , sleeper . 
  we 're going straight up / r/corejerk up here, 
  he wonders if it can be turned into a pachinko machine . 
  maybe even use that [ weird bloodsucking controller thing ] ( https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1246820613/blood-sport-the-ultimate-in-immersive-gaming ) for extra immersion . 
  i always thought that those faces looked kinda fucky . 
  diamo, 
  bots leave, 
  this pic is giving me a nice warframe vibe, 
  whoops . 
  that 's what i meant . 
  ok ... * all * of this is in your mind/psychological but if you have really vivid imagination you can * imagine * the feeling . 
  i make my non tulpa characters do stuff but i barely notice that i 'm doing it since i 'm really into it , pushing the story forward . 
  you can be whatever you want and i do n't think you need a tulpa for a wonderland . 
  there 's this thing called maladaptive dreaming i recently found out about , that i 've been doing all my life even before the tulpa stuff . 
  i 've had a world with really hype adventures . 
  time to unsub from 4chyn for now . 
  make america greato again !, 
  han came first . 
  i would but i do n't have to since i have night mode . 
  it look like garbage otherwise . 
  well , shit . 
  i just listened to vultures and it 's the hypest . 
  it 's not bad but i 've heard the same sound many times before . 
  i am an expert memeologist . 
  this kind of meme is still considered alright in some circumstances . 
  it 's not dank but it 's not shit either . 
  and you literally ca n't leave . 
  `` hank ... our son is a rocker ... '', 
  `` goddammit marie , they 're minerals . '', 
  yeah , i got nothing . 
  you there 's a quantum entanglement restourant here , right ? 
  very strict rules if you wan na go in tho . 
  ca n't take my abominations with me and i have to wear clothes without blood stains . 
  a ghost . 
  sony `` all for revenge '' entertainment, 
  next kojima game is coming to pc and now tekken ? 
  holy smokes , this is getting really hype !, 
  the real kojima is still on vacation . 
  a ghost behind the face of our / r/onetruegod ? 
  i 'm gon na trap him in a battery , put the battery in a dildo and leave the dildo in someone 's office for that . 
  what do you mean ? 
  it 's pretty much a portal to the outside world . 
  i can understand shopping boobies but holy shit why make a fang face ? 
  praise him , brother ... now if you 'll excuse me . 
  i have to put up a brand new shia poster ... right next to skeletor , and arnie ... 
  time . 
  i think the chef is one of our boys . 
  the meat is human . 
  most of the time ... 
  i 'm unable to watch this right now . 
  the banner is a scene from the movie . 
  pheww ... glad i do n't remember what i saw . 
  you feel bad but you know you love it . 
  i miss that ui . 
  i want to cry but i died inside when they took that ui away . 
  next gen pachinko machines, 
  did you go to the future ? 
  that 's cheating . 
  oh so it was your request . 
  please sign the paper next time . 
  the first generation flew too fast and kept slamming into the walls . 
  solved that by giving it steroids but not letting it affect the wings . 
  now they 're too slow . 
  third generation got an extra pair of wings . 
  the flying part is done . 
  but i was n't . 
  i gave it a mix of batmanium , orphanite and my experimental organic metal . 
  it now has really shiny black armored legs and wings . 
  it also talks and seeks justice . 
  that 's ... a side effect of batmanium i believe . 
  was requesting the addition of banepostium part of your plan ? 
  oh one more thing ... the pigs have to wear masks . 
  so that they can learn to ... 
  i got nothing . 
  my baneposting skills are n't what they used to be . 
  there you go . 
  i want the one with the most heads . 
  it probably means what you think it means !, 
  you do n't make stuff with hypetonite . 
  you * put it on * stuff . 
  it 's armor in a small package . 
  and you can make an ordinary dildo pretty interesting with it . 
  spikes , ribs , make it rough like a lion 's tongue or smooth like the slime straight out of sector r34 . 
  ... is that a creature request ? 
  then absolutely !,
