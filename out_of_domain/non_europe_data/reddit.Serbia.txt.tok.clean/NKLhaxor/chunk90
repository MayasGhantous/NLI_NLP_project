  me too . 
  if i could 've bought [ this hype shit ] ( http://mashable.com/2014/11/11/alien-predator-themed-house/#g5lrb6mi5zqc ) i would 've bought that hype shit . 
  gon na be honest . 
  i do n't know a lot about fighting game people . 
  i just like fighties and butts . 
  but i appreciate a good shitpost . 
  preach it , brother, 
  it looks like when snails get them parasites and their head thingies get really big and weird . 
  damn son , where 'd ya find this ? 
  when he gets back i hope that the 1st thing he says is just pure sarcasm . 
  [ here 's the moomoo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_x_4ueltdi ), 
  old new ui , best ui, 
  '' * or something along those lines . 
  arm does n't even look cauterized . 
  that 's just cruel . 
  if you 're looking for alternative stuff then check out starset . 
  you 'd think a jedi would know this and be less brutal . 
  * alternatively * , drink every time you screw up . 
  another feature : import your own music . 
  that 's straight up daredevil . 
  i recently installed it ( watched vinesauce joel ) and had a few jojo and kof matches, 
  that 's the unclean vocal guy right ? 
  i do n't care about the band anymore i guess . 
  people do n't like frankie but i honestly like the selfish lyrics and his vocals . 
  i 'll be looking out for more of his stuff . 
  i 'm not a karma whore but when i can i try to make myself feel nice by posting an upworthy meme . 
  i 'll start enjoying life when i get to be immortal . 
  for now i 'll just be playing vidya . 
  the new hannibal . 
  both main characters have the wendigo and the stag . 
  they 're not really tulpas but close enough . 
  / r/retiredgif, 
  you hack elves . 
  and trees . 
  it 's the same as guy in a car saying `` hey look at this loser !, 
  he 's learning how to drive ! '', 
  that 's pretty deep man . 
  * swishes bangs * ^ ^ whichiactuallyhave, 
  the css is getting more and more fucked . 
  [ as close as i could get ] ( http://imgur.com/ygdnp0d ) . 
  hair goes to the left irl . 
  nice hat . 
  btw , you have boobs . 
  there 's a male option when you 're selecting tops, 
  hitler 's dream . 
  getting ready to butter some bread , i see ... nice . 
  jtd should become a boyband . 
  probably , i dunno . 
  i do n't listen to that stuff . 
  ok , guy ... 
  i may not be an autismo but i 'm pretty fucked up . 
  a free document that 's accessible to everybody ? 
  maybe even made by a huge corporation ? 
  hmm ... 
  can you start setting things on fire again ? 
  it feels weird to not see random garbage ablaze . 
  now that 's a good idea . 
  well ... ahhh ... good luck to anyone who 's doing it . 
  hey , it 's the closest thing we have to a open world predator . 
  it 's like ... 
  i mean ... * they tried * . 
  p4 better be good . 
  i hope it hypes people up again so that we get a new predator game . 
  i love those . 
  when you 're on guard duty and they bump against your boots ... ahh ... 
  i love serving the empire . 
  i thought this was / r/anime _ irl for a sec, 
  so ... ** my ** pat from / r/twobestfriendsplay plays bloodborne only using [ the charge move . 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/zortvpi ) he misses once , gets hit and misses again . 
  then he backs down . 
  i think it 's a bad idea . 
  but i want him to get the tattoo because i 'm kind of sadistic . 
  he can chose to not do it . 
  oh well , fine by me but some people wo n't like it . 
  my pat is a cheating coward who would bring a gun to a fight . 
  he 's also canadian . 
  + / u/user _ simulator / u/nklhaxor, 
  / r/anime _ irl, 
  well ... change it or something . 
  if you do n't start burning stuff i 'll have to make a dragon or something . 
  i found it really clunky , stiff , jank and not that epic . 
  cool ideas but lackluster execution . 
  i recently started listening to older stuff like darkest hour and heaven shall burn ... 
  it makes me kinda sad that this kind of core is mostly gone . 
  i never got into this game . 
  i emptied a whole mag into a guy . 
  he turned around and killed me in less than a second . 
  made me really salty . 
  this album is fucking great . 
  check it out if you have n't . 
  sounds better than most serious bands . 
  money . 
  so i can juice up my pc, 
  i wish jtd appeared higher on my front page . 
  i 'm always late . 
  happy jew day, 
  try / r/wowthissubexists too, 
  i only played the old ones but i would go to the very edge , hold the fire button for the sprint and jump from the other end of the edge . 
  that was amazing . 
  * `` first you get the trophies , then you get the respect .
