  ## bring out the diamo dildo !, 
  star wars . 
  vader and luke conversation, 
  people keep saying that you can automate pretty much everything but even then i feel like a baby that 's trying to fly a plane . 
  / thread, 
  i doubt i 'll play the game but i 'm still interested in it so i 'll check him out . 
  i seriously gave up . 
  if that 's what you mean . 
  you have to use caps and swear a lot, 
  do n't you mean meht ? 
  vintage , zoo , dress up , lactation ? 
  it 's part of the cyberpunk and ( more in this case ) cybergoth culture . 
  i 'm not * super * into gasmask girls or the music but i find gasmasks really cool . 
  have you seen how badass the sas look ? 
  it 's a mysterious badass with a reason to be there but his face is hidden . 
  i happen to like girls and when you put 2 and 2 together you get gasmask girls . 
  which is kinda cool . 
  i know where he is but i ca n't tell you tho . 
  i 'm in an alliance with that sub but have fun slapping , friend . 
  could it be the music ? 
  close, 
  if i served a rebel i would stuff my photoreceptors in their skull and self destruct . 
  i am happy to serve . 
  does anyone want a drink ? 
  i did . 
  do n't know how much stuff changes but there are some pretty obvious luck events at the last mission . 
  lightning blows the street lights and when you confront krait you can mention your deal . 
  she wo n't belive you , but then gaichu and racter jump in and basically tell her that she 's fucked because she 's messing with me . 
  then her mag falls out of her gun and skips away from her . 
  i think you can choose to not fight but i decided to kill her anyway , so ... 
  after you deal with that stuff , back on the boat you can ask them if it feels a little empty on the boat . 
  you talk about it like `` yup . 
  this is what we chose . 
  we 're with you 100 % . 
  all right then , back to business . '', 
  that nosteam version works perfectly on my dual core . 
  been looking for a working version for years . 
  nice, 
  some memes should be put out of their misery . 
  some memes should 've been aborted . 
  you ca n't toast every kind of meme because if you do ... everything will try to meme you into toasting them . 
  the good memes will get pissed off as bad memes are just swarming in . 
  that 's why we must ... build a wall to keep bad memes out and make memes great again . 
  search your feelings , you know it be true . 
  not worth it tbh, 
  triple s. socks , sandals and squatting . 
  i got gold too so i can be rude , dude . 
  i have n't opened the game up in weeks . 
  but i got ta see this . 
  i found it really funny that the game finished the story before the anime . 
  holy shit that 's fuckin ' sick . 
  reminds me of make them suffer . 
  you probably should have left some of the details out . 
  but allow me to be the first to congratulate you , sir . 
  life ? 
  why tho ? 
  i do n't hate it but every time a game goes `` crafting ! '', 
  i sigh a bit . 
  it just does n't feel as cool as it 's supposed to be , to me at least . 
  i just follow the tutorial to get that menu out of my face because i 'll probably never try to squeeze more magic into a pair of boots . 
  `` arngeir , honey come back inside . 
  we have n't done it in so lo - '', 
  `` bitch , do n't make me raise my voice ... '', 
  `` all you do is sit there and do nothing all day ! '', 
  `` that does it , woman . 
  i 'm off to the mountains . '', 
  dmc has some banging industrial stuff . 
  ho boy ... the stream is shitting itself on it 's balls . 
  all hostile targets incapacitated . 
  the rest surrendered but we still used non-lethal gas to put them to sleep . 
  the jedi remains unconscious . 
  before we proceed to the next objective :, 
  requesting permission to use the other prisoners if the jedi proves too resilient for physical interrogation . 
  it 's extra painful for me because it reminds me of my old pc . 
  mission accomplished . 
  transferring recording . 
  ** base overseer ** : temporary imperial intelligence station . 
  orbiting nearby gas giant . 
  date ... 14.2 . 
  subject is ... a human male jedi . 
  seems to be in his thirties . 
  short black hair , brown eyes , light skin complexion ... average height . 
  face does n't match anyone in our databases . 
  the interrogation will be handled byyy ... the droid agent nv-15 . 
  you may proceed ... agent . 
  ** nv-15 ** : let us begin with something simple . 
  intimidation ... 
  you can tell us what we want to know and spare yourself the pain , jedi . 
  we 'll get what we want eventually . 
  ** jedi ** : try anything you want , droid . 
  i 'd rather die than tell you anything . 
  ** base overseer ** : hmph ... typical . 
  ** nv-15 ** : time for something non-lethal and very painful . 
  ** jedi ** : * breathing faster , grunting *, 
  ** base overseer ** : tough one . 
  perhaps you could try something different ? 
  ** nv-15 ** : bring the female prisoners . 
  and leave the drill in the knee . 
  keep it spinning . 
  ** base overseer ** : ** bwooop ** get the women in here .
