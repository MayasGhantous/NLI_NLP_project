  god fucking dammit . 
  this is art . 
  not 3 squiggly lines that sell for $ 999,999,999,999, 
  ca n't believe i missed this page ... 
  kisho ninja used self-destruct !, 
  i also seemed to have this issue , i was being besieged by takeda , and their horse archers had cannon sound effects . 
  [ battle of chi bi/red cliffs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_red_cliffs ) , if ` total war : three kingdoms ' is ever made . 
  [ battle of kosovo ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_kosovo ) . 
  just imagine for chi bi , outnumbered 1:16 . 
  an eternal rush to get to work on time ... 
  how the fuck do people still have regular usernames after a millennium . 
  fucking amazing read . 
  hell , a movie could be based on this . 
  i take it me and you are in the same boat this morning ( australia ) ? 
  this will never die off , will it ? 
  would history and archaeology go hand in hand ? 
  fuckfuckfuckfuck fucking fins why wont you fucking work, 
  fair enough . 
  was a pretty shitty idea in the first place . 
   - battle stories with pictures . 
  could be turning the tide , a narrow victory , or a hopeless charge of your last brave soldier . 
  i had 300 poorly trained men , enemy attacked with 600 samurai . 
  date harumune and his brother , yoshinori were both slain in the battle . 
  sanemoto was the only surviving member of the date clan . 
  i won with 6 men left , and they were sanemoto and his 5 bodyguard . 
  brb , gon na turn this into an emotional story . 
  edit : [ here you go ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/10vhr9/fall_of_a_daimyo_story/ ), 
  what about in australia , all my life i 've been putting it outside . 
  i thought it was upside-down not backwards ? 
  welp , i tried ... 
  well , that 's a relief ... 
  i 'm all for it personally , seeing the improvement from shogun 2 to rome 2 , i 'd be happy to pay extra to support the companies involved . 
  unfortunately i 'm not `` true blue '' or a true australian . 
  thank you very much , i never consider myself a decent total war player , i 'll sometimes mess up the most simplest of battles . 
  but that time i felt truly awesome !, 
  thank you , most of the shots are from the replay i saved so i had a lot more time to get more interesting shots . 
  [ fall of a daimyo ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/10vhr9/fall_of_a_daimyo_story/ ), 
  same , i like to fool everyone into thinking i have a super pc . 
  but even on max mine does n't look like this :(, 
  once again [ fall of a daimyo ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/10vhr9/fall_of_a_daimyo_story/ ), 
  how do people shit without pissing ? 
  fuck that bear is giving me nightmares, 
  well that 's taken highly out of context . 
  in the [ link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/11345a/after_10_years_i_finally_get_to_see_my_daughter/c6iwmfw ) that [ lingcullen ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/lingcullen ) provided . 
  op originally said this, 
   i just want the little girl to know i love the fuck out of her . 
  if i could just tell her goodnight one time , it would make me so goddamn happy . 
  holy fuck i just realised the captain looks like nicholas cage under the beard . 
  i wonder if these were the two guys in prince of egypt . 
  the chubby guy and the skinny guy in next to the guy pointing . 
  as far as i 'm concerned . 
  you 're pretty much doomed . 
  but then again , i have seen [ i __ love __ lsd ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/i__love__lsd ) do some amazing shit with the games code . 
  so , all hope is not lost as of yet . 
  you have n't seen someone fake cancer yet . 
  hi , i 'm a couple hours late but here 's hoping for the best . 
  did you think the internet would ever end up like this ? 
  what 's it feel like getting on in years ? 
  do you feel each year to be shorter than the previous ? 
  which countries have you visited , which was your favouite and which one provided the best hospitality and/or food . 
  do you play any video games . 
  what did you want to be when growing up and did you achieve this goal ? 
  thank you for ama . 
  my birthday is coming up soon , and i hope , just like you , to experience many more . 
  i 'm guessing it 's just gon na be an alternate universe . 
  chronicling his battles in great detail . 
  a copy of his book should come with the preorder or some special offer . 
  for some reason i 've never thought if this . 
  it seems so obvious now -_-, 
  nicely done , this is my pyrrhic victory . 
  luckily their last unit of bowmen ( 55 bow samurai ) routed before they joined battle or i would 've been toast . 
  how come they always seem to be friends with each other , even after realm divide . 
  and they all ally against me :(, 
  can you somehow make them fight each other through the use of agents or other tactics ? 
  about destroying the bridges . 
  i 've noticed in shogun 2 , that my archers ca n't attack archers towers with fire arrows ( or i must be missing something out big time ) . 
  maybe the option to attack ( wooden ) bridges with fire arrows to destroy them . 
  or of course set them on fire with melee troops . 
  i 'll be looking to join up in a couple of hours . 
  but there 's one thing making me a bit annoyed . 
  the capital letters ( caps lock ) everywhere on the forums page . 
  i 'm shimazu as well . 
  just curious , is this takahisa or one of his sons ? 
  or a another general ? 
  how the hell did his slide transition so nicely when he hit the pavement . 
  also , why the hell did he keep his leg up , he should of put it down and used his thigh to cushion the blow . 
  finally , they get a taste of their own medicine . 
  scumbags . 
  ~ posted from iphone . 
  man this outfit was so awesome for him and suited him so well , i hate the new gan ning :(, 
  i spent 5 minutes trying to find an apostrophe or something he added until i realized it was a shitty novelty . 
  beautiful, 
  this kinda reminds me of the time when a 2 province clan declared war on me and my 10 vassals . 
  did not end well for him . 
  i always happen to do this , accidentally selecting my whole team instead of shift clicking a couple guys . 
  and end up sending my horsemen into charging yari . 
  well ai-wise it does . 
  is this the all saints in queensland , australia ? 
  yes . 
  finally we 'll see how it all comes together .
