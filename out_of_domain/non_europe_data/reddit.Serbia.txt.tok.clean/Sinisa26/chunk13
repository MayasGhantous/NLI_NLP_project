  i have started learning some programming , but at very child level so we could scratch that out . 
  however , level design might be an area i 'm interested in , never tried my hand at it before but i like to think of myself as someone who has an eye for the finer things ( attention to detail ) . 
  ~ ~ however . 
  have you thought about legal issues ? 
  ( i do n't mean to sound like i understand anything about it ) it 's always legal issues why games like this are always shot down . ~ ~, 
  nevermind , you cleared this up in the other comments . 
  edit : it seems some douche was mad at this post and got his revenge by downvoting every single post . 
  i 'll go ahead and upvote everything to bring it back to normal -_-, 
  i 'm sure she/he is not making the game to have it compete with aa games . 
  just making it for the people who miss aom . 
  [ battle of kolubara ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_kolubara ), 
  [ battle of cer ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_cer ), 
  i think we did rather well , 'till germany got involved . 
  i swear , at times like this . 
  when escape is n't an option . 
  i 'd probably end up cracking a joke about my situation -_-, 
  was n't aware of the exact date is all . 
  you 're right , during that scene . 
  i wondered if i could 've done what carl did if it was my mother . 
  i know i would n't be able to there 's just no way . 
  oh wow , i never even thought about the t-dog/merle confrontation . 
  just get myself a suit of chain mail , ai n't no zombie biting through that . 
  is n't he and his son meant to be making a comeback soon or something ? 
  i think i heard that somewhere -_-, 
  there were definitely some chomping sounds if i remember correctly . 
  what am i doing with my life ? 
  hattori exploded in this playthrough , they got more than half of honshuu and are just about to raid kyushu . 
  how would we go about naming the very first century ? 
  zeroeth century ? 
  is there a term for zero ? 
  yeah it really blew my mind trying to get my head around it as a kid . 
  but it does make sense . 
  yes it is . 
  however we were discussing why the 18th century is n't the 1800 's rather it is the 1700 's . 
  then we went on to wonder what the period from 0-100ad would be called . 
  _____ century ? 
  dude , you are fucking awesome . 
  such a through provoking post !, 
  was trying to find something to tag him as , thanks !,

  [ fall of a daimyo ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/10vhr9/fall_of_a_daimyo_story/ ), 
  such a great atmosphere . 
  wow , yuan looks skinny and zhen ji has tits again . 
  sold . 
  amazing , so amazing . 
  i love ca . 
  with that we could have launched another curiosity sized mission . 
  perhaps it would 've been even cheaper a second time around -_-, 
  canadaaaaa, 
  oh damn , my bad . 
  thank you for that , i should always remember to source . 
  it 's not sadistic at all . 
  feels rewarding . 
  not too sure for your first question , but for your second one , the [ aka-bo language ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aka-bo_language ) recently went `` extinct '' after it 's last [ native speaker ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boa_sr . ), 
  died in 2010 at the age of 85 . 
  ** edit : ** there is also a wikipedia page for [ extinct languages ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/extinct_language ) with 89 different languages listed . 
  god damn i will never get tired of seeing this quote . 
  woah , damn that looks awesome . 
  does n't seem like my type of game but god damn i will buy it . 
  just for the looks and the fact that it 's `` studio ghibli '' and also miyazaki is involved . 
  are you an apprentice for my father ? 
  or humans . 
  showers would be renamed `` fountains of youth '' !,

  the [ australian aboriginals ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/australian_aboriginal_languages ) all used to have different languages for [ each individual tribe ] ( http://yolngu.net/copy%20of%20aus_map_covered_text_lined.jpg ) ( a lot ) , sadly , at the start of the 21st century most of the languages have gone extinct . 
  some claim to be up to 40,000 years old but there is no verifiable proof apart from cave drawings . 
  i still do n't understand how he reacted so fast -_- !, 
  i do n't even think it is necessary to have a house that big . 
  for anyone , except maybe the queen or the supreme overlord of earth . 
   and the image seems to be discussing s3e01, 
  i thought op was discussing about the part when they are on the highway , and carl finds a stash of melee weapons in the ~ ~ walker 's ~ ~ dead guy 's lap . 
  wow , furthest i got is to 1907 . 
  and that took like 600 people xd, 
  my mother 's side bred like rabbits . 
  time to contact my grandmother , see what she can pull up on our ancestry . 
  i suppose , but there 's so many more things he can do with that money . 
  things that will make people like him . 
  in a family of seven , 30 minutes is a marathon !, 
  i just realised that was the abstergo sign not a tomahawk near his hand .

  i generally enjoyed the movie . 
  glad to know i 'm not the only one , he is by far my favourite historian on this subreddit ( due to my love of the sengoku jidai ) .

  5th from left , face is symmetrical . 
  you are a champion . 
  best wall of text i 've read in my life . 
  does this mean that mammoth clone project can go ahead ?
