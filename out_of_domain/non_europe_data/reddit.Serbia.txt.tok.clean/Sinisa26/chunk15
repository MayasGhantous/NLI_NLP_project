  worth the effort !, 
  well , good luck with that !, 
  let me know of any other interesting finds you come across . 
  i 'm a sucker for anything history related !, 
  8 hours later ... 
  for some reason i always feel as if spoilers wo n't hurt me . 
  but god damn, 
  as much as i hate to say it , i support modern darwinism , yet disagree with your statement . 
  he could have seriously injured someone else or killed a whole family . 
  are you past real divide ? 
  oddly enough , in this situation , this spoiler made me buy the game , because now i 'll never be complete without knowing why that happened . 
  11 hours later . 
  any time now ... 
  brotherhood and ii were my favourite . 
  i still ca n't put my finger on it why though , it just seemed to come together so well . 
  why the fuck do i keep reading the spoilers !, 
  hngggg, 
  gov is the * antagonist * ? 
  i think , just keeping the city happy ends up more economically benefiting in the long run over sacking . 
  most definitely !, 
  damn , it 's only for usa :(, 
  whattt ? 
  when i was entering a state it only had us based ones . 
  i 'll cecum again later , thanks . 
  how the fuck does she have so much power in one hand . 
  came here for this . 
  imagine the battle of chi bi/red cliffs as a historical battle . 
  huang gai looks awesome , but the weapons a bit ... eh ... 
  ling tong getting girlier with every update . 
  i can deal with that . 
  gan ning look pretty cool i guess , does n't seem to have changed much since 7 . 
  [ i miss this gan ning the most though .

  i really appreciate you keeping us all updated :d, 
  edit : i have a feeling ma su or zhang bao are next , though the shu roster seems to be the fullest out of all four . 
  jin will undoubtedly have some new characters to fill up the roster . 
  did everybody forget glenn ? 
  where did he say where he was going ? 
  is it too far away from savannah ? 
  what about lilly ? 
  i think any of these are potential candidates but christa and omid the most . 
  being able to save kenny , that just seems like a stupid sacrifice . 
  he shoulda just shot ben and be done with it . 
  kid was impaled through the stomach and the only doctor was miles off into the ocean . 
  no chance he was surviving . 
  i found the odds of her , being among the first couple of zombies in the house , quite low . 
  i never read the comics and was under the impression it was only canon with the comics . 
  i 'm not too sure about the comic/show connection either . 
  i guess vernon and co. taking the boat must 've been the final string for him . 
  glad serbia picked the right choice . 
  iirc , that 's how most native american tongues are actually spoken . 
  sandlot ? 
  amazing how quickly modernisation trumps millennia of tradition . 
  who ever thought this was a good idea ? 
  dude i love your colourisations , what do you plan to do when you extinguish all the civil war pictures ? 
  yes , zhang bao , i was waiting for him to be added . 
  shu roster is getting freaking massive . 
  i always presumed it was about tyreese and co. 
  i read your comment was intrigued , then saw your username and burst into laughter . 
  [ already been done !,

  holy fuck it 's my crushmkfsd, 
  edit : [ :'( ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/14akwz/become_god_fb_oc/c7bfqko ), 
  damn , my crush was first :(, 
  i liked all the scenes with conner and haytham . 
  haytham 's a cool guy . 
  wait , can you ( as the player ) do the assassin recruit missions ? 
  i 've experienced it as well , more than a couple time . 
  it was a whole door ( which is n't openable ) , but was opened by an npc ( warren ) , and inside it was just this glitch . 
  dude come on man, 
  i 'd like to see the ` battle of kosovo ' . 
  enormous casualties to both sides , both leaders dead . 
  i 'd have it follow milos obilic as he killed the ottoman leader . 
  alternatively the `` battle of chibi/redcliffs ' would be awesome . 
  it would be awesome to have china or japan . 
  however , romans and chinese traded quite regularly and it would be only natural for some of the content to end up in japan due to proximity and trading . 
  [ jennifer white ] ( http://sextvx.com/en/video/208862/jennifer-white-has-a-body-that-could-put-a-lot-of ) . 
  link is very nsfw . 
  i 'm not sure if it will work . 
  if it does n't just search up `` jennifer white has a body '' . 
  i fucking hate bluebottles . 
  pretty sure stalin just straight up despised his own son . 
   dzhugashvili ** ( stalin 's son ) ** served as an artillery officer in the red army and was captured on 16 july 1941 in the early stages of the german invasion of ussr at the battle of smolensk . 
  the germans later offered to exchange yakov for friedrich paulus , the german field marshal captured by the soviets after the battle of stalingrad , but stalin turned the offer down , allegedly saying , `` i will not trade a marshal for a lieutenant . '', 
  according to some sources , there was another proposition as well , that hitler wanted to exchange yakov for his nephew leo raubal ; this proposition was not accepted either . 
  i 'd usually just give up the whole beach as soon as i see one washed up on the shore . 
  historyporn is my favourite subreddit . 
  and colourizedhistory is pretty awesome . 
  you should check out / u/zuzahin colourisations . 
  finally about to buy a new rig , and , as is tradition in the total war community , i 'll buy fots and do what op did here . 
  how long does it take you to do one civil war photo on average ? 
  also , how long do you reckon it would take you to do something completely different from civil war ? 
  i 'm a big fan of your colourisations if you have n't noticed yet !, 
  this is awesome . 
  dw8 looks absolutely beautiful . 
  rough translation from my friend ;, 
   treasure box set will be released ** ( date ) **, 
   it contains ;, 
   - game disc/umd, 
   - special 3d character crystal ( lights up ),
