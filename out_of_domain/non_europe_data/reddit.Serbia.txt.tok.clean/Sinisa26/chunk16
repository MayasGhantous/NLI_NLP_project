  [ red is where i have been , and blue is where i am going in the near future ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lvxkt.png?1 ), 
  born in serbia , lived in australia for most my life . 
  on the way to serbia i visited a bit of saudi and if you are from serbia you ca n't visit relatives without visiting serbia 's surrounding countries . 
  i 've always loved japan and am beginning to save up . 
  and i 'm visiting brazil for world cup 2014 . 
  reminds me of the last samurai . 
  `` hold your fire ! '', 
  was that israel putnam who made that quote famous , in bunker hill ? 
  there is also this website . 
  [ republican presidents ] ( http://www.republicanpresidents.net/10-interesting-facts-about-ulysses-s-grant/ ), 
  grant liked life in the fast lane **, 
  as president , grant received a speeding ticket by a police officer who failed to recognize him . 
  he was fined for driving his horse too fast through the streets of d.c. 
  seems like a reputable enough source . 
  the fuck is wrong with this man ? 
  i love these kinds of maps . 
  anyone have any idea what they are called and where i could find more ?

  getting real sick of your shit op, 
  instantly knew it was this before i opened it . 
  i 'm serbian and i can confirm this . 
  can i ask what it means ? 
  a translation provides me with `` relic 's ice '' ? 
  as / u/yeti0013 said the guy in the video [ gary brolsma ] ( http://i877.photobucket.com/albums/ab331/insomniazoo/post%20images/garybrolsmanewnuma.jpg ) has capitalized on it , made more videos and even released his own album . 
   gary william brolsma ( born january 14 , 1986 ; saddle brook , new jersey ) , is the american singer who gained worldwide attention after posting the numa numa video . 
   he made appearances on abc 's good morning america , nbc 's the tonight show , and vh1 's best week ever . 
  a story in the believer ( june/july 2006 ) explored the song 's spread and global homogenization , while arguing that brolsma 's video `` singlehandedly justifies the existence of webcams . 
  it 's a movie of someone who is having the time of his life , wants to share his joy with everyone , and does n't care what anyone else thinks '' . 
  he was voted the number 1 internet icon by 40 greatest internet superstars on vh1 , beating the star wars kid at number 2 . 
  on october 15 , 2007 , the new york times reported that brolsma had recently collaborated on a video with lonelygirl15 's glenn rubenstein , as well as chad vader 's aaron yonda and matt sloan , as a part of canon 's battle of the internet superstars . 
  ** on october 21 , 2008 , brolsma finished his first musical album , titled weird tempo . 
  he has been working on the cd for the past 2 years since releasing his last numa 3 video . 
  the album is a mix of electronic beats with rock influences . 
  this has made me even more confused o.o, 
  yes i have , and i 'd appreciate it if we talked about other matters . 
  why does `` the green dragon '' seem to be such a common pub name ? 
  people really underestimate the emotional support and joy pets can provide . 
  come on man leave us alone, 
  i urge you to go ahead with your plan , serbia is wonderful and open to foreigners . 
  do n't understand the downvotes , this is true , i guess they are from people unwilling to accept the truth . 
  what if they are just a bunch of dicks and want to destroy us for personal amusement ? 
  or put us in gladiator-style arenas ? 
  everyone pointing out armor is heavy . 
  chainmail bitches , ai n't no zombie biting through that . 
  wait but , if rick gave the gun to otis , would n't it seem a bit suspicious that shane somehow managed to return it considering shane 's story that otis was devoured ? 
  maybe i 'm missing something . 
  ahh , i was going off memory and did not remember him saying otis gave him the pack . 
  thanks for correcting me . 
  put ... put your dick in it . 
  he 's saying ;, 
  - nice = sweetness intensifies another taste, 
  - yuck = sweetness with no other taste or too much sweetness which which negates the other taste . 
  say that to [ mike tyson 's face ] ( http://ionenewsone.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/mike-tyson.jpg ), 
  this is kind of what i was thinking . 
  [ shark chainmail shirt ] ( http://gadgets.boingboing.net/assets_mt/2008/10/30/9080_chain_mail_shirt_combo.jpg ), 
  i never really meant proper medieval chainmail armour , rather something modern like a [ shark chainmail shirt ] ( http://gadgets.boingboing.net/assets_mt/2008/10/30/9080_chain_mail_shirt_combo.jpg ), 
  hi / r/pyongyang and it 's glorious users , i 've come to you with a question . 
  how do you feel about serbia ? 
  like , do koreans generally favour or dislike us ? 
  what was it ? 
  to be fair , he could have a gun hidden in the loaf of bread . 
  i actually have no clue what i was thinking , and why i even accused you of being unfair . 
  i guess i must 've read your post wrong . 
  and yes , it is stupid to point anything at a cop . 
  come on man , it 's top comment . 
  banana tree ? 
  same story with me , down in melbourne . 
  luigi 's mansion , 
  i do n't believe you , i choose to believe it 's an easter egg implemented by telltale . 
  i always love when the enemy wins a siege battle , then they bunch like 1000 men into that one little capture circle . 
  just imagining one mortar or some other form of explosion going off there is hilarious . 
  so when the current akihito dies , he will be renamed emperor heisei . 
  it 's pretty awesome . 
  what 's even awesome-er is that the current japanese monarchy began in 660bc . 
  or putin . 
  try not flexing your penis . 
  but seriously though , it does n't work for me either :(, 
  fuck , who cleans up messes like these ? 
  or do they just say fuck it and let nature do it 's job ? 
  awesome battle dude , i had a similar one where i had around 350 ashigaru up against 650 samurai and won with only 6 men remaining . 
  [ my story : fall of a daimyo ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/10vhr9/fall_of_a_daimyo_story/ ), 
  how do you feel about fots ? 
  is it better than vanilla ? 
  sounds fucking amazing , my new computer is coming soon and fots is how i plan to christen it . 
  thanks for the input :d, 
  uhhh i can only assume that last word says `` samurai '' , and me being an addict to japanese history , i now have to know what the rest of the `` average american '' description says . 
  come on op , i 'm counting on you . 
  it 's [ church and biddle ] ( / spoiler ) at the tavern whom he confronts . 
  he recognizes them from the portraits in achilles ' basement . 
  i remember in the movie red cliff , when zhang fei retreats . 
  some of his men remain behind and the way that get killed off is awesome/horrible . 
  some guy got put into some sort of a headlock by 2 other guys wielding spears while a third guy just continuously stabs him . 
  it 'd be awesome to see these kinds of deaths . 
  i think it resets every map change or when you reconnect/disconnect .
