  edit : / u/vfarqg said it first . 
  credit to him/her/it . 
  your dp reminds me of someone who needs a god damned reversion !, 
  god damn it , bring back [ dw3 gan ning !, 
  you 're a good man . 
  does the ai actually make vassals ? 
  i thought only some clans started off with one . 
  my whole pc game collection is like total war : shogun 2 and cs : s. 
  please keep us updated if anyone responds . 
  this is a joke . 
  my first thought was serbian because i recognized ulice and cesta but soon realised it was n't . 
  [ this is the real one , the faces look pretty good in the drawing .

  [ this is the real one , the faces look pretty similar . 
  ] ( http://media.amctv.com/img/originals/walking-dead/downloads/season-2/twd-s2-1024-premieres-e.jpg ) no need to be a dick !, 
  i have n't played fots so does someone want to explain what the hell i 'm meant to be looking at ? 
  i 'm feeling goddard . 
  [ this motherfucker !, 
  ] ( http://www.gameaxis.com/img/blog/2456/image/lubucg.jpg ), 
  errrrr no . 
  doing our work for us . 
  jiro dreams of sushi !!, 
  i do n't really understand why though . 
  you win . 
  as horrible as that word looks , there 's only two spelling mistakes . 
  he 's done it twice already , op 's a dick . 
  stole this from the goddamned comments of the original , that 's three times today i 've seen it stolen and reposted . 
  forever branded as reposter . 
  nope , it 's definitely there , it 's really hard to notice but once you do it is fucking annoying . 
  everyone has it i believe . 
  nice try . 
  i 'm fully aware that ignoring them is the best course of action but god damn i want to ** see them suffer !!!, 
  amazing . 
  that first comment sums up my view on anonymous . 
  not that i 've served but i have experienced war/combat . 
  that would be awesome but i would n't like it to be too obvious such as saying `` 3000 gold '' . 
  i 'd rather it just have something like hints where it says the leader is `` greedy '' and such . 
  thank you for the insight , but i was more wondering about serbia , why is serbia also stealing a boot ( land ) from austro-hungary ? 
  did serbia annex land as well ? 
  and if so , which land . 
  ahhhh , i see , i somehow completely overlooked what was written on the boots . 
  i think it sorta meant like , take 100 % of the opportunities to make it work . 
  not work on it 100 % of the time . 
  i went to buy dw7 a couple of months ago . 
  and it was sold out , however there was dw6 . 
  i though `` eh , why not ? '' . 
  and bought it . 
  a couple hours into it i just though to myself `` wtf is this shit ? '', 
  you really have a bone to settle with this eagle , do n't you ?

  [ war is hell ] ( http://i3.minus.com/jbtiuws4wddphu.jpg ), 
  nsfw god damn, 
  i guess i probably should 've been able to tell though . 
  it 's not so much nsfw , but awkward as hell around family . 
  any idea who was the oldest on the confederate side ? 
  but does n't the other way give wikipedia more traffic , thus keeping it free ? 
  ama ? 
  ama ? 
  ah , i remember the first time my 220lb friend and i made an impromptu seesaw . 
  many tailbones were shattered that day . 
  x-post to / r/mapporn, 
  is this a tournament in japan or something ? 
  i do n't think you can , unless it is like liquid nitrogen cold . 
  you 'd likely freeze solid after you pass out or die , which obviously is n't really in a state of action . 
  unless you are musashi . 
  hmmm , well , this is just purely speculation by the internet it seems and it would be appreciated if someone more qualified could provide more information . 
  just did a quick google search and found a website saying it was most likely staged and that the fox was shot or killed then left to freeze in his artificial position . 
  why did stalin despise his son but care for his daughter ? 
  did dzhugashvili do something to anger him ? 
  my dad used to tell me this story every night . 
  [ another one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hu5ww.png ), 
  perhaps the presence of skyscrapers dwarfs it ? 
  looking forward to dw8 immensely . 
  i ca n't answer your first question but the name [ `` freedonia '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedonia ) was once suggested . 
  just incase anyone wants some more backstory on the new characters . 
  recently ordered a new computer and would like to christen it with chivalry . 
  even if i do n't get it , i 'd like to say thanks for what you are doing . 
  keep being awesome fatty . 
  short answer ? 
  that was amazing , thank you so much . 
  is there any more similar ones ? 
  hero ? 
  or idiot ? 
  awesome screenshot !, 
  do you find that the blood pack enhances the game or does it look better without ? 
  i 'm only asking because it looks a bit cartoonish . 
  `` i want to get off mr bones wild ride '', 
  that was great , thank you !, 
  i do n't think anyone was happy when charging into battle .

  if he does n't respond with either `` come at me bro '' or `` look at all the fucks i give '' . 
  you win . 
  i 'm so happy for you . 
  however , i 'm a bit curious as to how many times they change your first name , mans , mars , mads . 
  congratulations man !, 
  i would 've thought that intelligence thwarts power . 
  one of those skill  strength stories . 
  i 've seen it once as well .
