  i do n't know why i felt the need to tell you , but it feels like an accomplishment . 
  `` allan , please add placeholder '', 
  there is meant to be some more text other than `` placeholder '' in there . 
  usually pertaining to the event which is `` trait gained '' . 
  [ ... ] ( http://www.mememaker.net/static/images/templates/340165.jpg ), 
  this should be in / r/aww . 
  i 've seriously never had a video make me feel so happy on the inside . 
  your daimyo sounds like a badass . 
  not just anyone can slander the oda and get away with it . 
  in shogun 2 , sometimes when i besiege a city . 
  it has no defenders . 
  but there is a maxed out army ** next ** to it . 
  when the battle starts , the army comes as reinforcements . 
  i send my general/cavalry into the castle to slaughter the retainers and quickly capture the castle , this forces all the enemies/reinforcements to rout . 
  then i send my cavalry to get as many kills as you can against the routing horde . 
  come to think of it , this is an unexplainable exploit . 
  1800s japan ? 
  yeah , that 's the exploit part i meant . 
  just a mass rout , where they wo n't even try to fight back . 
  you are not alone . 
  also , i believe it could only fire in the direction the track was facing . 
  the man being executed is ` apparently ' shimidzu seiji who is guilty for the murders of major baldwin and lieut. 
  bird . 
  the picture was taken in 1864 . 
  ** edit ** : this is a staged picture which represents the real execution . 
  i remember reading this a while ago . 
  what was it from again ? 
  i believe the picture of the crucifixion was posted in this subreddit or another a couple of days ago . 
  if i find the link i 'll be sure to send it to you . 
  that is seizo fukumoto by the way . 
  he 's died onscreen about 20,000 times according to him . 
  ahhh , thank you for the link . 
  i should 've been more specific , i meant i 'd link you to the discussion surrounding the picture . 
  ahhh , i read it on reddit a while ago , i 'm still yet to watch shogun assassin . 
  is it any good ? 
  he also has plenty of pictures of china and india . 
  [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/upper_north_taku_fort.jpg ) is my personal favourite . 
  [ here 's another one !, 
  ] ( http://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/21f/21f.027/beato_people/beato_people_gal_large/pages/bjs15_koto.htm ), 
   perhaps there is a way to manually edit the unit size ? 
  / u/i __ love __ lsd, 
  holy shit that was funny, 
  i am rather proud of my country . 
  no , serbia . 
  what * is * your name ? 
  rose ? 
  holy shit , i just thought of an alternate universe where you support saigo takamori and lead him and his forces to victory . 
  please ubisoft , at least making it china/japan . 
  also , i believe china was a no-go as well . 
  all the 4 locations/eras ( ? ), 
  i wished for out knocked out :(, 
  unless ubi wants to go down the ac : serbia route ? 
  damnit , beat me by 6 minutes :(, 
  i crack up every time he stares at the camera seriously at the end . 
  yes , it is the [ sarissa ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/sarissa ), 
  i remember when a lone yari ashigaru charged my spear wall . 
  one of my yari ashigaru in the spear wall threw his spear into the neck of the other charging ashigaru then took the spear out before he even fell to the ground . 
  i 'm assuming this is the same animation . 
  seems pretty rare since i 've only seen it once . 
  this is honestly my favourite total war picture thus far . 
  such a level of badass . 
  too bad this animation seems to be extremely rare . 
  mother fucker what you know ? 
  i 'm late to the party but ... 
  ahhh , osaka castle , such fond memories of the massacres upon the bridges . 
  larry actually looks pretty cool here . 
  and now we play the waiting game ... 
  i love turning the last man standing into a human echidna . 
  such is life . 
  is it by any chance named after [ gilbert du motier , marquis de lafayette ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gilbert_du_motier,_marquis_de_lafayette ) ? 
  hojo family member grave/shrine ? 
  [ mind the low graphics and ui ] ( http://i.imgur.com/o1myy.jpg ) !, 
  both to be honest . 
  i 'm subbed to / r/gaming , / r/totalwar , / r/history , / r/askhistorians , / r/historyporn , / r/colorizedhistory . 
  i always was a fan of japanese history but playing shogun 2 intensified my studies . 
  i believe this might confirm your suspicions . 
  it 's the tomb/grave of hojo tokiyori . 
  decent loot i 'd say . 
  great minds think alike friend . 
  it 's happens to be the grave/tomb of hojo tokiyori . 
  for anyone wondering whose grave/shrine this might be . 
   h\u014dj\u014d tokiyori ( \u5317\u6761\u6642\u983c , june 29,1227 -- december 24,1263 ) was the fifth shikken ( regent ) of the kamakura shogunate in japan . 
  he was born to h\u014dj\u014d tokiuji and a daughter of adachi kagemori . 
  i do n't know , i still think it 's a rather nice photo . 
  what the fuck is the hovercar driver doing ? 
  he 's gon na fucking crash !, 
  [ your wish is my command ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mnlap.jpg ), 
  oh lord i 'm going to need a source on this , pronto . 
  tanegashima tomokata . 
  this guy was fucking badass . 
  he led his general 's guard ( 10 men ) and one light cavalry unit ( 15 men ) against a force of 200-300 ashigaru on two separate occasions . 
  oh yeah , did i mention he was ambushed both time ? 
  that 's pretty sweet !, 
  dong zhou keeps getting fatter and fatter ... :(, 
  i love this guy . 
  i loved [ lu bu 's dw3 ] ( http://images.wikia.com/dynastywarriors/images/5/55/lubu-dw3.jpg ) costume . 
  [ this is the greatest pyrrhic victory i 've ever seen ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wzdsj.jpg ), 
  they had 600 samurai and i had like 280 ashigaru and 30 samurai . 
  it 's a shame i was playing on the smallest army settings . 
  holy crap han dang is creepy .
