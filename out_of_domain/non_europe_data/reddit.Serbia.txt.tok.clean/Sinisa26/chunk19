  i agree with you about taishi ci , this costume is a bit eh . 
  i 'm glad zhou tai still uses a katana , i hope they never change that . 
  plus it makes me feel cooler knowing i have black friends . 
  i do it with my brothers, 
  his enormous set of balls were holding him back . 
  soda is my downfall . 
  former . 
  fuck humidity . 
  we need more people like you . 
  hey , [ i asked this question ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/x8rtx/why_didnt_the_samurai_use_shields/ ) about half a year ago if you 'd like to get a look at some of the answers . 
  it was [ also asked ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/voutd/why_were_shields_so_much_more_prevalent_in/ ) before me . 
  this one is much more informative . 
  ** edit : ** found [ another one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistory/comments/t1kqd/why_were_shields_never_used_in_battle_in_china/ ) if you 're still interested . 
  ohhh holy shit that 's the greatest . 
  i 've learnt from another thread that 's been posted here that the romans used sponges on sticks , called a * spongia * to wipe their anus . 
   most romans wore tunics ( a garment like a long tee-shirt ) and probably nothing underneath . 
  so you could just hike it up in back and sit on the cool marble seat , leaving the front of the tunic to cover your knees and your modesty . 
  you would sit there , chatting with your friends , and when you finished your ` task ' you would rinse the sponge in the channel of running water at your feet and -- without standing up or revealing anything -- you would push the spongia through the hole at the front , give your bottom a wipe , rinse off the spongia ... and leave it in a basin for the next person to use !, 
  got ta admit , it seems like a pretty amazing method of cleaning one 's anus , apart from the communal shit sponge part . 
  same issue , i could n't move the campaign map at all then crash :(, 
  that 'll probably come in useful . 
  thanks !, 
  how anyone can willingly to do this to another human being , friend or foe alike , absolutely blows my mind .

  also sean bean ( boromir ) was terrified of flying in helicopters . 
   we had to go to another location which was in the remarkables in queenstown by a lake , to shoot a scene . 
  well , sean absolutely did n't want to fly and said : look , i 'll take the skilift up and then i 'll walk the rest of the way . '', 
  we shot there for two or three days , and our day would begin with everybody flying in the helicopters , and as we flew over , at like 7:30 a.m. we 'd look down and there 'd be this tiny black speck climbing the cliff . 
  it was like a cliff face and it was sean bean , dressed up as boromir , like a fly on the wall , clamoring up this mountainside all by himself to get to the location because he did n't want to go by chopper . 
  he had like two hours of climbing to do . 
  - peter jackson, 
  my god time flies , first time playing sly i was just a small kid . 
  definitely got better . 
  i 'd recommend you give them a go . 
  i 'm pretty sure they were re-released on ps3 . 
  i do n't suppose he is willing to simply walk into mordor . 
   worst ending to your life . 
  * ftfy, 
  i want to be able to set forests on fire to drive enemy units out . 
  greatest feeling ever is when you gamble a fart while you have a stomach flu ... and win !, 
  exactly what i was thinking , it would be foolish if ca do n't implement this in romeii . 
  it would n't be that hard i would imagine . 
  i like this one . 
  i like how he pretty much cancelled his downvotes from his first post with a save , then proceeds to get utterly destroyed again . 
  i post this ages ago , get destroyed . 
  you post it , 3,809 upvotes . 
  god damn it . 
  but yes , fuck lu bu . 
  i miss his dw3 constume . 
  it 's the dynasty warriors series by the way . 
  jesus fucking christ i miss his dw3 costume . 
  bring it back !, 
  i remember in either dw4 or 5 . 
  where you had to kill him to win ( he was the commanding officer/general whatever at xia pi ) . 
  me and my friend were playing two players . 
  we managed to win with i think 45 milliseconds left on the map timer . 
  was fucking intense . 
  [ it 's kinda historically accurate as well . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lu_bu ), 
  yeah , let 's not talk about dw6 shall we . 
  well it seems like we have quite the dynasty warriors aficionado gathering here . 
  might i invite you all to join the community over at / r/dynastywarriors ? 
  we are constantly updating the subreddit with information about dynasty warriors 8 as soon as it is available . 
  i thought it was tsao pee . 
  because i know cao cao is `` tsao tsao '' . 
  actually come to think of it , tsao and sow are pretty similar . 
  holy shit , that 's a really nice pack . 
  keep us updated :d, 
  thanks !, 
  i just recently upgraded my computer and it runs the game better at max than my old computer did at minimum !, 
  it was a good battle , i only lost one single man , but that 's because my ally charged in guns blazing and pretty much messed up everyone . 
  i 'm slowly easing into larger unit sizes . 
  i just ca n't wrap my head around so many people everywhere . 
  luckily , the historical battles have kinda got me used to large unit sizes so maybe next campaign i 'll try larger units . 
  i believe it was at the wakasa location ( above yamashiro [ kyoto ] ) . 
  i find myself doing this with every joint battle because i feel as if the ally will just stab me in the back later on anyway . 
  but this time i felt pretty sad . 
  when i was defending the province before this one . 
  obama pulled two full armies out of their ass and attacked two of my provinces . 
  this ally took it upon himself to sacrifice his armies to weaken obama enough to allow me to destroy the remnants . 
  my allies presence on the front lines may be gone , but it shall never be forgotten . 
  i must be doing something wrong then . 
  every vassal i take backstabs me in a couple turns . 
  allies i find can generally last longer but they are no exception either . 
  it is rather fancy is n't it . 
  here 's an excerpt from the [ wikipedia page of the boshin war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boshin_war ) ( boshin war  weaponry of the boshin war  uniforms ), 
   some of the headgear for some of the imperial troops was quite peculiar , involving the used of long , colored , `` bear '' hair . 
  the `` red bear '' ( \u8d64\u718a , shaguma ) wigs indicate officers from tosa , the `` white bear '' ( \u767d\u718a , haguma ) wigs officers from ch\u014dsh\u016b , and the `` black bear '' ( \u9ed2\u718a , koguma ) wigs officers from satsuma . 
  wait was xu shu playable in dw7 ? 
  i am friendly . 
  i have an alliance , trade agreement , marriage agreement , same allegiance . 
  usually +100 diplomatic relations with them . 
  does darthmod help with allies ? 
  well , i used darthmod for shogun 2 vanilla and hated it because it seriously messes up archer fire .
