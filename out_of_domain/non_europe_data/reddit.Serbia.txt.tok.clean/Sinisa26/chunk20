  50 arrows fired into a unit of 50 ashigaru head on resulting in one kill is a pretty massive killjoy . 
  does it do the same to the units in fots ? 
  well , yes , but i truly feel this unit probably had the best view of a massive battle any artilleryman has ever had . 
  naval fire support was the second best thing in this battle , behind my allies zerg rush . 
  there was just this one level of the castle , really small area but they somehow packed like 8 units into it . 
  oh god seeing the men flying everywhere was truly a sight to behold . 
  another reason why it was such a good day to be an artilleryman , watching it rain men . 
  dude , you should save up . 
  my new comp was around $ 1100 which i kinda feel is now really unecessary . 
  you could probably build one which runs shogun 2 maxed out for like $ 800 - $ 900 . 
  good luck . 
  hmmm , that seems like it could become troublesome . 
  allies are douches , i hope the diplomatic/ally system gets revamped for rome ii . 
  that 's more men than i use throughout 5 campaigns :(, 
  ahhhh , i see . 
  thanks !, 
  what about the units with firearms ? 
  any noticeable changes to accuracy/damage . 
  if not i 'll probably download it next campaign . 
  i had no idea and still have no idea . 
  i had a friend who told me which parts to buy . 
  and then he guided me through the construction process . 
  but yeah money is still an issue , i hope luck finds you soon man , no one deserves to be robbed of witnessing the beauty of a maxed out total war game :d, 
  i have n't tested it on bf3 yet ( do n't have it ) , but it 's been running fots maxed out without a single hiccup thus far . 
  i 'm relatively sure you probably do n't even need $ 1000 to get shogun 2/fots at max . 
  this is my computer 's [ results ] ( http://d1ylr6sba64qi3.cloudfront.net/global/assets/images/graphs/mp_rp_7.gif ) for bf3 on [ systemrequirementslab ] ( http://www.systemrequirementslab.com ) . 
  ahem ... [ serbian army girls ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neyqn6_niga ), 
  everyone is starting to look like they are part of a boy pop band :'(, 
  when did britain invade serbia ? 
  does having troops there as aid constitute an invasion ? 
  also that inejiro asanuma guy . 
  go to the diplomacy menu and for the date clan see if they are a vassal of another clan . 
  for some reason this struck me as the saddest . 
  dudeeee , this is an amazing colourisation , looks like it was taken today . 
  is sun quan just lu bu 's face with different hair/clothes ? 
  natural reaction to protect vital organs and body parts . 
  that is a terrifying man . 
  got a name ? 
  do you by any chance still have the uncolourised version ? 
  i 'll try putting it through google reverse image search ( ? 
  ) , see if i can get anything . 
  ahh , alrighty then . 
  never thought i 'd see a `` the castle '' reference on here . 
  i was going to ask for a wwi map as well , glad to see others share my interest . 
  thanks for going ahead with it dabusco !,

  found this instead . 
   on december 2 , 1979 , elvita adams jumped from the 86th floor , only to be blown back onto the 85th floor by a gust of wind and left with a broken hip . 
  amazing .

  jesus , i feel like i 've spent my whole life playing total war , only at 500 hours . 
  exactly what i was thinking !, 
  this is the saddest thing i 've even seen .

  i do n't think there has been any confirmation of ma chao being in dw8 as of yet . 
  however i 'm willing to get he will be in it . 
  tricked a friend into thinking i had an arranged marriage .

  / u/zuzahin also colourised this photo . 
  i 've actually started doing this recently . 
  go to sleep at around 5-6pm . 
  wake up at midnight for 1-2 hours . 
  then go back to bed .
