  oh lord , now i feel like an idiot . 
  i 'm extremely sorry i accused you of stealing zuzahin 's work . 
  i was just under the impression no one was as good as him :p, 
  i opened your image and did n't even look at the lady in the back , but rather at the man in the front and they both look extremely similar in yours and zuzahin 's colourisation . 
  once again , i 'm sorry . 
  dynasty warriors 6 noooooooo !!!, 
  come to think of it , that was the worst in the series actually . 
  reminds me of this one . 
  i 'm a month late but i vaguely remember that it is april o'neil and breanne benson . 
  or brianne . 
  just a little hiccup . 
  serbia 's is the zastava m21 not zavasta . 
  and also i believe , cicero becomes kikkero , or something along those lines . 
  crazy that the mongol empire was fighting both japan and austria at the same time , and austria/japan most likely were n't even aware of each other 's existence . 
  such is life . 
  kinda in the same sense , i 'd like to see a movie about the serbian uprisings . 
  was n't as great as i thought it 'd be . 
  fun fact , if you 've already `` won '' the battle and are just chasing down routing units , you can go to options and quit the battle . 
  you wo n't lose . 
  go to a custom battle and give yourself the best unit , then attack a yari ashigaru . 
  then when you are prompted to continue or quit . 
  choose continue . 
  then go to menu and quit . 
  [ that 's some serious firepower !, 
  get back to work !, 
  ** total war : rome ii **, 
  . . are gone . 
  still , bickham has done better than varus did . 
  with the camera set low over the roman army there 's a claustrophobic aspect to the battle i 've not previously encountered in a * total war * game . 
  part of this is the environment : teutoberg 's trees are five times bigger than * shogun 2 * 's tallest , and it is possible to zoom the camera right down over the shoulder of an individual legionary and observe the way the low sun obscures vision as it casts long angular shadows over the forest floor . 
  there 's a sense that enemies could emerge from anywhere , and this is preserved even when the camera is zoomed all the way out to the new tactical view , where light is flattened , time slowed , and units represented by translucent rectangles . 
  this is thanks to a subtle but major change to the * total war * formula : every unit now has dynamic , terrain-based line of sight , and no enemy unit is visible by default . 
  no more steering your men towards a general magically marked out by a star on the battlefield . 
  `` each individual man is actually looking around him , '' ferguson explains . 
  `` he can see only what he can see . 
  as a result of that you get a much more claustrophobic effect when you 're in a forest situation - and much less time to react . '', 
  ** wood for the trees **, 
  the battle of the teutoberg forest shows off this feature in its most obvious context : an ambush that relies specifically on surprise as a weapon . 
  it has an impact on the entire game , however - even open-field battles . 
  `` with the new system , a lot of the existing maps have ambush opportunities in them , '' lead unit designer jack lusted tells me . 
  `` it does n't take a lot of re-engineering . '', 
  in * shogun 2 * , the average infantry unit moves at the speed of a marathon runner in order to reduce the time that armies spend closing the gap between one another - for * rome ii * , line of sight solves the same problems . 
  `` the first thing that you discover is that a 30-meter hill - that 's pretty good for hiding 15 units behind , '' ferguson says . 
  armies can surprise one another on the battlefield in ways that simply were n't possible under the old system . 
  the battle of teutoberg is a standalone scenario , but ambushed will be a part of the main campaign . 
  it 's now possible to set an army 's stance to defensive , aggressive or ambush . 
  in the latter , you 'll have the option to force a battle upon a passing enemy . 
  they wo n't have a chance to deploy , and you 'll have a chance to wipe them out before they can flee . 
  battlefield terrain , once generated , will now be persistent within an area on the campaign map - so if you 've found a rocky mountain pass that you like to use for ambushes , you can keep returning to use it for as long as enemies are willing to walk into your clutches . 
  combines with the line-of-sight system , this has the potential to make the non-roman factions genuinely more interesting to play : the germans might not have the same technology and discipline , but familiarity with their environment could win them some decisive victories . 
  as in life . 
  ambushed are also a great way for allies to announce that they 're no longer interested in being friend 's with you - something that * rome ii * 's campaign designers anticipate will happen frequently . 
  `` sometimes we 've had people internally say that alliance behaviour is broken - ` my ally attacked me ! ' '', 
  lead designer james russel says . 
  `` sometimes , though , that 's because the ai has decided that friendship does n't fit with its plans . 
  `` i 've still not seen the revamped campaign map , but talking to its lead designers reveals some of the thinking behind the changes in store . 
  in particular , creative assembly are looking to address problems with the clean-up phase that can bog down the endgame of a * total war * campaign . 
  * shogun 2 * 's realm-divide mechanic - where other factions turned on the player when their empires reached a certain critical mass - was , appropriately enough , divisive . 
  in * rome ii * , it 's still likely that the player will face increased opposition as they grow in power , but it 'll happen gradually , and you 'll have a chance to anticipate it . 
  ** never forget **, 
  `` the new system remembers facts , '' is how lead campaign designer janos gaspar explains it to me . 
  `` deeds will be remembered , and the hatred towards the player will build . 
  as you 're bumping into new powers , the friends of your enemies are getting hostile . 
  a power vacuum can form around you , new empires can appear . '', 
  this is linked to the other major change : political dynasties . 
  in addition to choosing your faction , you also pick which family , tribe or power base you represent within it . 
  the first * rome * game split the republic into three separate factions : * rome ii * presents the same idea in a much more subtle way , and expands it across every culture . 
  `` we did n't want the player to feel like they were n't controlling rome , '' campaign designer dom starr says . 
  `` they * are * rome - just part of the political dynasty . '', 
  you 'll have internal rivals to contend with , and your relationship with these - based on a substantially expanded version of * shogun 2 * 's loyalty system - will have a major influence on your decision-making . 
  over a long enough stretch of time , betrayal and civil war is inevitable . 
  or , to put it another way : someone is going to cross the rubicon . 
  '' [ rivals ] will still try to achieve their goals , but if everything goes right , you wo n't fight them , '' gaspar says . 
  `` it 's more like personal differences . 
  later on , it could lead to a break or a rupture . '', 
  this , then , is the final way in which the precedents set by the teutoberg scenario feed into the campaign as a whole . 
  when betrayal is nigh-inevitable , the freedom to make choices - where to fight , who to trust - is essential . 
  as well as representing varus 's actions literally , creative assembly want to give the player freedom to dig a similar hole for themselves . 
  `` the more reversible a decision is , the less of a decision it was , '' is how russell puts it . 
  `` if a decision has no consequence , it was n't really a decision . '', 
  ** barbarian horde ** germanic warriors to avoid, 
  ** berserkers ** - rampaging and near-naked mountains of muscle who ca n't be routed when they get going . 
  the rage-fuelled inverse of a trained legionary . 
  ** sword masters ** - veteran soldiers wearing salvaged equipment . 
  their sense of honour means that if their leader falls , they 're bound to follow him to the afterlife . 
  ** bloodsworn ** - young warriors who are obliged to grow their beards until they 've slain their first enemy . 
  their desire for a shave means that they fight in the vanguard . 
  ** night hunters ** - warriors of the harii tribe who painted themselves black to ambush enemies at night , causing widespread panic among enemy troops . 
  i 'm gon na fucking love playing as these guys . 
  why the worried face ? 
  saturation, 
  optimistic .
