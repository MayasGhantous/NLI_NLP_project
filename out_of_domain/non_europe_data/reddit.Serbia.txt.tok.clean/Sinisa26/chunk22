  op has just taken over kyoto and is soon to become shogun . 
  holding kyoto/becoming shogun is one of the main objectives of the game . 
  op has recruited five and a half armies to defend kyoto from anyone willing to take it . 
  generally , 5 and a half armies could net you all of japan . 
  if you 're interested in any of this you should take a look at the game and / r/totalwar and here 's some pictures of the game : http://imgur.com/a/xijm7, 
  you most definitely should . 
  while you 're at it , buy the standalone expansion pack `` fall of the samurai . 
  it probably has more content than the original game . 
  also blood pack , do n't forget the blood pack . 
  if you 're interested you should take a look at / r/totalwar and here are some images from the game http://imgur.com/a/xijm7, 
  just hit realm divide today and chosokabe have landed 4 armies on the mainland already :(, 
  honestly , everyone is different and prefers different ones , do you have a favourite era in history ? 
  i 'd recommend starting there . 
  i 'm in love with samurai and japanese culture/history so obviously shogun 2 is my favourite . 
  it is a bit ridiculous , but i believe the guys at ca were trying to parody kurosawa because his samurai movies always were rather bloody . 
  yeah , realm divide comes through and destroys all your relationships . 
  it sucks when my old ally uesugi backstabs me and i am forced to completely obliterate him . 
  if you take over a province after realm divide you can choose to make the clan that originally lived there a vassal , they wo n't get the realm divide buff so you can stay friends for them relatively long . 
  yeah , if the ai conquers a province they can turn it into a vassal ( not sure how common this is ) , but the more common one is the fact that the original owners of the province will lead a rebellion against the people who currently own it ( if town happiness is bad ) . 
  if they win , they take over the province and become a clan again . 
  and yeah , clans/vassals created after realm divide do n't have the realm divide buff so you can stay allied to them for quite a while . 
  also , by that point in the game you must have had a great economy going which caused saito to broker up a trade deal immediately . 
  i 've taken out two of the weak chosokabe armies , but i fear these other two , they are like max level samurai . 
  not one unit of ashigaru . 
  i had two level-5 ninjas keeping them at bay by sabotaging but this turn they both failed . 
  and one of my provinces have been taken :(, 
  i 'm afraid to start up the game again . 
  never in all my years have i seen christianity this far up mainland japan !, 
  hmmm , i remember someone in the / r/totalwar community saying it was to parody kurosawa . 
  and yeah , you 're right , i 've seen all those films and they are n't very bloody . 
  my mistake :(, 
  i ca n't upgrade the castles fast enough :(, 
  chosokabe have a free turn since my ninjas could n't sabotage the armies . 
  they 're in walking range of two provinces :(, 
   watch any beheading video . 
  i 'll be fine thanks . 
  the worst part about date is the fact that the northern provinces are so fucking huge . 
  it take like 3 seasons just to get into your neighbours province !, 
  mother fucker what you know ? 
  watch dat train go !, 
  yeah , im on time !, 
  does it * feel * the same as the others ? 
  and most importantly , are the voice actors the same for the original trio ? 
  the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own -- populated with their own ambitions , friends , routines , worries and inherited craziness -- an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground , with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you 'll never know existed , in which you might appear only once , as an extra sipping coffee in the background , as a blur of traffic passing on the highway , as a lighted window at dusk . 
  the files zuzah colorizes are often too large to be uploaded to imgur . 
  here 's a tutorial by op !, 
  [ colorization tutorial - how to colorize b/w or vintage photographs ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvf60pgsi9q ), 
  actually , the more i look at the bloated man in the foreground , the more i think that he actually does n't have any shoes . 
  it 's okay zuzah , think of me as your loyal servant . 
  i am the alfred to your batman . 
  [ here you are ] ( http://www.antique-english-porcelain.co.uk/teatime.jpg ), 
  do you know if it is d/l only in australia ? 
  seems i am not alone . 
  i always get a great feeling of joy when one of my ashigaru garrison units survives my sacrifice . 
  i want to retire them for life , and reward them . 
  but they just get disbanded :(, 
  [ i would 've gladly given this man his own domain , half my treasury , and the finest horses from kai stables . 
  ahhh zuo ci , we meet again . 
  thank you very much for keeping us informed !, 
  and you have my bow . 
  thank you for teaching me what an oxbow lake is . 
  you learn something new every day . 
  ** side note : ** does anyone know how to fix my shadows problem in the game . 
  you can notice it on the people getting skewered , my yari on the right and at the bottom of the image . 
  for some reason i ca n't run the game in dx11 anymore even though i was playing with dx11 last night . 
  so i assume that would be the problem . 
  anyone know how to activate it again ? 
  ** edit ** : okay , now for some reason i have the option to play in dx11 -_-, 
  he was a good man , took out about 8 enemies . 
  [ rip overly expressive guy , 1839-1867 . 
  far right , not as spectacular as you may have expected , but still , frontline with longbow and broadsword is pretty badass . 
  no mods , unless you count fall of the samurai and blood pack as mods . 
  i felt so special when i got my first placeholder . 
  i remember when i had three units of sharpshooters and a general . 
  i was attacked by a rebel army of 6 spear levy , the auto resolve bar did n't even have red on it . 
  that place is ridiculously beautiful . 
   unfortunately , the replay is corrupt and it shows me losing  :-(, 
  i 've had this happen to me a lot , by corrupt do you mean the colours are switched on the mini-map ? 
  ahh , that 's a shame . 
  meanwhile i send a unit of 23 samurai hero ( fots ) against a group of 15 spear levy and i level up . 
  i came to a fots battle right after a shogun 2 ( radious ) campaign and i was shocked to see my units route with around 150/200 men left . 
  i think most video subreddits automatically put in the length of the video . 
  any word on when physical copy arrives in australia ? 
  i was under the impression it was meant to be 22nd . 
  i went into eb games to pick on the 22nd and they said it 's not in yet so i ended up pre-ordering :(, 
  did n't even realise you posted this image . 
  i was about to suggest that op requests a colourisation on your subreddit . 
  i 'm not stalking you i swear . 
  wait , you are n't even op , i think i should get off the internet for today . 
  i might be going crazy . 
  join us at / r/totalwar :d, 
  is it the siege of osaka ? 
  if it is , it brings back fond memories of blowing up the powder supply then absolutely destroying the enemy units as they run out onto the bridge . 
  i think it 's time i do the historical battles again !, 
  it was the other way around i believe , shingen ( takeda ) defended himself with a fan while kenshin ( uesugi ) burst into the hq . 
  ten points to gr ... shimazu !, 
  easily dynasty warriors 3 . 
  i remember when i was pretty young and i watched my brother and cousin play it . 
  now they give me slack for playing such kiddie games . 
  my dog died when i was 14 , he was literally my birth present , not birthday .
