  i 'm 17 now and still have n't had the courage to go and get another one , i just fear that i will never be able to dedicate as much love to the new one as i did to the old one . 
  i literally figured this out a couple days ago , it makes for some amazing cinematic screenshots , [ like this one !, 
  nah , seriously though ;, 
  [ off with the head !, 
  [ advantage of bows is that you can shoot over your teammates !, 
  [ fire !, 
  [ aim !, 
  honestly , shogun is one of the most beautiful games i 've ever played . 
  this is probably [ my favourite picture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/h3yxvtg.jpg ) , had it as my wall paper for a while . 
  pretty sure something like this went down . 
  replace archers with cannons . 
  ** longshanks : ** archers !, 
  ** english commander : ** i beg pardon , sire . 
  wo n't we hit our own troops ? 
  ** longshanks : ** yes ... 
  but we 'll hit theirs as well . 
  we have reserves . 
  attack . 
  i 've found that in fots , my economy is shit for maybe the first 30-40 rounds , to the point where i ca n't even leave my city for fear of rebellion . 
  i just turtle down for another 10-20 turns , set taxes to high , then very next turn put it back to sufficient levels for happiness across all provinces . 
  continuosly repeat and use that sweet , sweet koku to build economic buildings across all provinces . 
  i think i 'm earning 16k koku per turn now . 
  i never even used the weapon :(, 
  these will blow your mind . 
  ** some are nsfw i guess **, 
  thank you very much , i 'm addicted to taking pictures in shogun 2 and fots , i admittedly have over 1000 photos stockpiled in about 2 months . 
  ikko ikki , peace maker ? 
  this keeps happening to me . 
  it keeps crashing :( i always want to post an album but imgur wo n't let me :(, 
  while the notion is nice , it 'll be dead man . 
  maybe a post every two weeks . 
  braveheart , as / u/stylingtoofast said . 
  [ i promise i will be there to catch you when you fall ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0sl42cc.jpg ), 
  last time this was posted , this picture was posted alongside it . 
  made me laugh so hard . 
  ** edit : **, 
  * n. * the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own -- populated with their own ambitions , friends , routines , worries and inherited craziness -- an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground , with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you 'll never know existed , in which you might appear only once , as an extra sipping coffee in the background , as a blur of traffic passing on the highway , as a lighted window at dusk . 
  amazing , 10/10 . 
  my mother 's name is bijelic , i always thought it would be spelt like that . 
  you should play a bit of ac2 a brotherhood mate . 
  i could take a shogun 2 or fots picture for you . 
  just tell me how you want it . 
  it must be so awesome to be able to trace your family tree back even to the 1800 's . 
  i 'm told by my parents and grandparents that we had a magnificent family tree dating back to centuries . 
  but it was all lost in the [ war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yugoslav_wars ) when our houses were burnt and bombed . 
  so sad man , as someone who absolutely loves history , it truly is a shame to not be able to trace my own ancestry to the 1800 's . 
  does n't look a day over 50 . 
  unghhhh , so jealous :(, 
  `` now with the help of the latest computer graphics , you 're about to see this great battle as never before '' . 
  i sure hope the history channel use rtwii . 
  i 'm afraid you ca n't friend-o . 
  atleast , i could n't when i accidentally send my modern history assignment to my ancient history teacher . 
  edit : i 'm fairly certain it wo n't rewrite your old copy if you send it again . 
   newspaper saloon in the sky . 
  i doubt we were famous enough for anyone to have a backup anywhere . 
  a lot of my family used to live in villages and were pretty much farmers . 
  unfortunately i do n't live in serbia anymore so i ca n't really check . 
  my mother has asked here brother if he could check but they could n't find anything . 
  we have started again , i think the earliest birth date we are at is someone born in 1899 . 
  still rather recent :(, 
  i could 've sworn one of the main things that ca really wanted to get out to the public was the fact that not everyone was the same size ? 
  i 'll use the line tomorrow , for you . 
  / * doubt *, 
  `` you lying piece of shit '', 
  god fucking dammit phelps !, 
  i seriously think honesty was not the best policy there . 
  this is finally a story on reddit i can believe . 
  i could give you the link ... 
  if you want to see for yourself . 
  serbia may finally get a beach . 
  just imagine , jiroemon kimura ( first guy ) , was old enough to serve in ww1 . 
  he was an old man by wwii . 
  whippersnappers, 
  that 's like a compilation of 15 pictures . 
  just out of curiosity , can anyone judge how fast this car was going ? 
  and also , how much damage could this do to an average adult . 
  i 'm just gon na go ahead and say that kid is very lucky . 
  edit : that gif was sped up heaps . 
  here is the [ video ] ( http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=6d2_1362331891 ) , i doubt it would do anything to an average adult . 
  no , i knew how film works long before i made this post . 
  i was just simply pointing out how many less frames this gif has compared to any other gif posted on reddit . 
  yeah , i was a bit skeptical about how fast and smoothly the car stopped ( if it was going at the gif speed ) . 
  actually , if you watch the [ video ] ( http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=6d2_1362331891 ) you can see an [ `` australia post '' mail box ] ( http://streetcorner.com.au/assetlibrary/images/eastgeneral/es_152161_39_image.jpg ) at 00:04 into the video . 
  so i 'd assume it * is * in australia . 
  unless , that 's already what you were pointing out . 
  this 'll probably save you a couple of awkward situations later in life . 
  pretty much , seems to be how reddit works these days . 
  mob mentality i guess . 
  that 's exactly what i thought . 
  i chortled . 
  the odds were about 2330 ( takeda ) vs 6000 ( hojo ) . 
  i was left with approximately 600 brave men and women . 
  [ here 's an album of the aftermath ] ( http://imgur.com/a/fx2xg#0 ) . 
  ** note ** , i am using `` radious ' unit mod for vanilla shogun 2 '' and a `` peasant ashigaru '' mod . 
  the two mods kinda conflict as radious ' mod changes the style of the bow ashigaru but not the yari ashigaru . 
  this is why the yari ashigaru looks peasanty while the bow ashigaru to the left of him do n't . 
  naginata or spear for primary . 
  create human skewer , use human skewer as an obstacle for other opponents to get past . 
  switch to gladius or katana when enemy get past human skewer . 
  die a glorious death .
