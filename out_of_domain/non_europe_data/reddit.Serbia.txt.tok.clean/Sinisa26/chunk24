  that 's assuming i know how to use either of those weapons at all . 
   `` and so the days of the hojo had ended . 
  great clans , like men , it is sometimes said , have their own destiny . 
  as for the last ashigaru , no one knows what became of him . 
  some say that he died of his wounds . 
  others , that he returned to his own domain . 
  but i like to think he may have at last found some small measure of peace , that we all seek , and few of us ever find . '',

  these guys look badass ... 
  then again , so does everyone else . 
  but then / u/original-finder will lose it 's job . 
  did n't want to sleep anyway, 
  this . 
  this is art !, 
  i would but his unit disbanded :(, 
  jesus fuck it 's one downvote after another , talk about mob mentality . 
  i may have posted it in the comments of another thread . 
  i 'll check if i have now . 
  ** edit ** : yes i did , it was posted 15 days ago in [ this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/18wbh2/what_do_you_think_of_this_tactic_hold_them_at_the/c8ivb29 ) !, 
  holy fuck this blew up quick . 
  we had archery for like one lesson . 
  then it was permanently banned . 
  it would be so awesome if there were whole classes dedicated to archery . 
  i get sweaty when watching these highstakes multiplayer games . 
  i am absolutely horrible at multiplayer . 
  i battled some russian guy the other day and he took down my whole army with like 3 units . 
  he had like 300 kills with carbine cavalry , 100 with a shogitai unit and about 200 with an azure dragon unit ( or one of those ` special ' units ) . 
  here 's another : [ 4v4 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvsxuo-xkbu ), 
  ** edit ** : actual battle starts at like 19:00 minutes in . 
  jesus christ , you guys are treating the north korean 's like monst ... oh wait, 
  christ , i thought that was a kid , any idea what he was doing in there ? 
  all i managed to get from google translate is that the gap was around 20cm . 
  this is an awesome photo , i wish there was a higher res version :(, 
  that is a hell of a name !, 
  i wonder what happened to that prop of minas tirith . 
  it better not have been destroyed :(, 
  that is such an irish name . 
  god damn it i had my dick in my hand and i nearly ripped it off, 
  ** note ** : the clan i fought , `` saga '' , had two full armies protecting it 's last province . 
  i bribed the one that was n't in the castle and immediately next turn , the garrison set out to defeat me . 
  i had no idea how to use half the units in my new bribed army due to them being ones included in the radious pack . 
  also , i did n't really care if this army lost ( because they were bribed ) , so i deployed them pretty sloppily . 
  it was very enjoyable watching these battles . 
  they were so fast paced they made me sweaty . 
  i can only aspire to one day be a quarter as good as them :d, 
  at the final engagement of the battle , there were maybe 100 enemies left on the field , i charged my 3-man general squad into his unit which had the largest amount of people to give him a glorious death . 
  for some reason they stopped firing at my general and turned around to attack my left-over shinsengumi infantry ( routing ) . 
  this allowed my general to hit them in the back and get about 3 kills , then my shinsengumi infantry were back in the game and i charged their whole unit ( 14 men ) into the back of the enemy which caused the enemy to rout . 
  this won me the game :d, 
  i have n't played any xtreme legends or samurai warriors , so for me ;, 
  - dynasty warriors 3, 
  - dynasty warriors 7 : empires ( only empires i 've played :p ), 
  well kilithaza , judging by all these definition for `` pyrrhic victory '' , i think this battle has all the requirements . 
  - a victory that is offset by staggering losses . 
  - a victory in which the victor 's losses are as great as those of the defeated . 
  - a pyrrhic victory is a victory with such a devastating cost that it carries the implication that another such victory will ultimately lead to defeat . 
  - someone who wins a pyrrhic victory has been victorious in some way ; however , the heavy toll negates any sense of achievement or profit . 
  - a victory gained at too great a cost . 
  - a victory or goal achieved at too great a cost . 
  - a victory achieved at great or excessive cost ; a ruinous victory . 
  but yes , it was a massacre . 
  ** edit : ** i 'm not trying to come off as a condescending asshole or douchebag or anything , so if it seems like that i apologise . 
  i 'm using ;, 
  - radious total war mod - fall of the samurai version, 
  - fots artillery unit pack t3 radious edition, 
  you should try it out , it seriously makes the game much more enjoyable , especially with a vast variety of different units . 
  it also makes it much more difficult due to the enemy armies carrying artillery everywhere . 
  i once fought a battle with 8 enemy artillery units . 
  i was content with the victory , i 'm sure i would n't have been able to pull it off again . 
  happened to me in shogun when i won an underdog victory . 
  i click `` end battle '' , game freezes , music still playing as if to mock me . 
  [ my reaction ] ( http://nooooooooooooooo.com/ ), 
  of course i 'm considering it a victory . 
  the enemy outnumbered me more than 2:1 and i drove them back . 
  saga 's entire military force was crushed while only a small portion of my whole army was destroyed . 
  this may not be a victory in your eyes , but in my eyes it is most definitely a [ strategic victory ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strategic_victory ) at least because `` it disturbed the enemy 's ability to wage a war '' as they had no military power and became my vassal right after . 
  but fair enough , you have a right to believe what you will and i respect that . 
  this might sound stupid , but did they actually do that . 
  is there any record in history of a viking ( or anyone for that matter ) , charging the enemy while on skis ? 
  why does he have a baby ? 
  p.p.s he has a nice beard . 
  p.p.p.s i want this framed in my living room . 
  something along these lines ;, 
  [ the empty fort strategy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/empty_fort_strategy ), 
  do n't you have to declare war on the army to be able to incite a rebellion ? 
  `` nobody is home , go away '', 
  [ i did something similar which i used to catch routing units , however did n't have * nearly * as much men on there as you did . 
  i do n't really understand how ** i ** lost an embarrassing amount of troops . 
  i had an army which was inferior in regards to equipment , size and experience . 
  outnumbered by odds more than 2:1 , yet i still came out the victor . 
  in my opinion , ** he ** lost an embarrassing amount of troops . 
  also , you 're first point is not entirely true . 
  the very person it is named after ( [ king pyrrhus of epirus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pyrrhus_of_epirus ) ) won a ` pyrrhic ' victory against the romans in the [ battle of heraclea ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_heraclea ) , while he had a smaller force ( about 10,000 smaller ) . 
  ** edit : ** once again i apologise if i come across as a condescending asshole or douchebag . 
   as for charging the enemy while on skis , no , that would probably not be very practical . 
  i 'd imagine so , well , thank you for answering that . 
  it just looks like they are getting ready to go into battle . 
  interesting , meanwhile i 'm getting completely butt-fucked because i just became a republic and everyone declared war on me . 
  there are just random clans surrounded by me who magically happen to have like 3 stacks of max-levelled troops just lying around . 
  and to top it all off , i did n't read the * fine print * on the * terms & conditions * on becoming a republic which indicated that i would lose all my shinsengumi :(,
