  well , they ca n't have a negative to relations if they do n't exist :p, 
  better luck next time . 
  run over lol, 
  i do n't know about op , but you should definitely try out radious ' mods for fots !, 
  despite all the historical inaccuracies , i truly enjoyed braveheart , and i 'm sure many others did as well . 
  and they shall continue to do so , until the very last man has fallen ! ... 
  not because of honour , or loyalty ... 
  but because they are on the top level of the castle !!!, 
  serbian here , i 'm pretty sure my mum has put people in comas from overeating .

  ** note ** : this was taken from the other side of the hallway , with max zoom , i did n't dare get closer . 
  when i tried it ended up cornering me in the toilet . 
  he will have his revenge .

  i do n't know why , but for some reason he reminds me of that honey boo boo thing . 
  i 've done some sleuthing and all evidence seems to indicate that this is not a ` hiroshi matsumoto ' , rather it is a man by the name of ` tani masuo ' .

  personal favourite is this one : [ giga pudding !,

  ahhh yes , good memories . 
  they should bring out a sequel !, 
  [ sweet , sweet justice . 
  this might be offtopic , but can you actually play as serbia , or is it just a minor faction , or is it just a territory . 
  i 'd love to play as my own country !, 
  honestly , dale was probably my favourite character . 
  jealous :(, 
  i 'd donate my body for that . 
  i 'd really like to become a mocap artist :(, 
  yes , i 'm pretty sure it should be a lance . 
  crazy to think that they would all be killing each other in 15 years time . 
  that was amazing commentary . 
  ` k ' is to remove the hud . 
  yeah , that was ridiculous . 
  i became a republic the other day and you never realise how many full stacks the enemy has until they are breaking down your undefended castle gates . 
  come on man , what 's in the zip ? 
  who compiles this ? 
  this is my favourite picture , i hope you do n't mind if i use it as my background ? 
  that guy right next to castro really looks like my grandfather . 
  so ... far ... away ... 
  who downvoted op 's post ? 
  is anyone else excited over his upcoming role in the remake of 47 ronin ? 
  op ; how did you manage to fuck this up ? 
  it 's off the charts . 
  or i buy them both individually and save $ 0.01 . 
  something similar has happened to me in fots with kneel fire enabled . 
  the front line will crouch , then stand back up , then crouch , then stand back up every second . 
  no one even fired off any shots yet it said that the unit was firing above the unit card :(, 
  that little sliver of red on the auto-resolve bar ... 
  `` so you 're saying there 's a chance . '', 
  i 've never played empire or napoleon , can someone tell me what 's going on ? 
  holy shit that 's an awesome intro , but i still do n't quite understand why i should feel sad for him ? 
  is the intro showing all the battles he 's lost or something ? 
  holy fuck that was amazing , i think i might have to buy empire now ... 
  `` who 's a cute little dictator ? 
  yes you are '', 
  people will find any excuse to complain . 
  especially twcenter . 
  i 've got radious artillery mod and holy fuck . 
  one unit of artillery with the enemy will absolutely destroy my whole army . 
  engaging in counter-artillery does n't help much either because for some reason it takes like 50 direct hits to disable it . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  she 's thought she was in bed with her husband but then she received a call from him and realised he was at work . 
  now she realises there is something other than her husband in the bed . 
  i remember my first couple of days in minecraft , i had a full inventory of sand/dirt and did n't know that you could chuck the whole stack away . 
  i equipped the stack of 64 and spammed g ( my drop button ) , so i could drop it all individually . 
  at the end there was like 700 individual items on the ground and it lagged the fuck out of my save . 
  guy at 2:40 just does n't give a fuck anymore . 
  that mission objective is so disgusting . 
  can someone explain the comment ? 
  probably a type for ` move ' ? 
  wut indeed . 
  i definitely remember it lagging the hell out . 
  maybe it was just on the older minecraft versions . 
  ca n't wait for this dlc !, 
  it 's so annoying when i 'm going up against a whole army of line infantry and bring about 10 cavalry units as reinforcements , then they spawn right behind the whole fucking army and get torn to shreds . 
  fortunes always hiding ... :(, 
  tollund man looked so peaceful , this man is just horrifying :(, 
  i used to say wrong ;, 
  meme ( meh-may ), 
  celts ( sellts ) [ referring to the culture ], 
  clothes ( cloves ) [ i knew it was ` clothes ' but had a hard time pronouncing it ], 
  he * walked * into michonne 's katana . 
  the fuck kind of a name is shupert . 
  soooo , the educated do n't know about serbia ? 
  hell yeah , i 'm moving to bhutan . 
  `` this scumbag shot me '' ... 
  you do n't say ? 
  what is flatcore ? 
  not that i can remember , but holy hell i wish it did , that 's one awesome song . 
  `` so you 're saying there 's a chance ? '',
