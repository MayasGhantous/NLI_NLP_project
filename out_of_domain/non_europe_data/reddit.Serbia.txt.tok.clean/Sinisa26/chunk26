  sacrificed for the greater good . 
  do n't die on me dammit, 
  yeah , accidentally put down '' \u308f '' instead of '' \u306f '' . 
  our teacher barely taught us anything , more than half the lesson she spent showing us cat videos on youtube . 
  she had around 10 cats at home . 
  i like to zoom in real close to all the death , put it in slow-motion ... [ then play this music in the background ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy3q2dc88r4 ) . 
  i cry every time ... 
  also , if you have n't watched [ red cliff ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3qixqchf94 ) ... do it ... 
  no matter how many direct hits i get on him that bastard wo n't die !, 
  it hits him square in the face and 15 men around him die but he just proceeds , unshaken . 
  there should totally be an rickety bridge connecting those two overhangs . 
  i 'd probably lose my whole army to the first guard infantry unit . 
  i believe the imperial forces also had howitzers . 
  1 ) [ the rise of the samurai ] ( http://wiki.totalwar.com/w/rise_of_the_samurai_expansion ) is a dlc you must 've bought or received in a package with the original game . 
  it is set during the genpei wars during 1180-1195 . 
  this is roughly 400 years before the vanilla shogun 2 is set . 
  there are different units available is each dlc expansion so yes there are different units . 
  i personally have n't played rots but i would recommend you get fall of the samurai , it nearly has more content than the vanilla game . 
  2 ) i personally prefer radious ' overhaul mod but you can play vanilla just fine . 
  3 ) realm divide is horrible , unless you like a challenge ... 
  there is no way to turn it off in options i believe but you can download some mods from the steam workshop to amend that . 
  happy slaughtering !, 
  i 'm pretty sure i remember omura saying `` see , even the mighty samurai can not stand up to the howitzers ! '',

  christ yes !!!, 
  probably my favourite movie i 've ever watched !, 
  please deliver , even if its one scene it will give us all a good laugh !, 
  i get the feeling it was modeled off of this [ guy ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/steve_buscemi_2013.jpg ), 
  i think that the only people who think that are the north koreans themselves . 
  that was ... amazing ... 
  also , how do you edit the game files to only have 1 person in each unit ? 
  i 'm ashamed to even think about this chapter in my country 's history :(, 
  will the morale of the units be affected ? 
  if there is only 1 person in the unit , will that unit be considered 100 % full or will it be like 0.5 % full ? 
  ** edit ** : my `` campaign_unit_multiplier '' line does n't exist :'(, 
  ** edit2 ** : neverming , my stupid ` ctrl + f ' was n't working . 
  thanks ... 
  ** edit3 ** : whenever i try to put it at a 2v2 or 1v2 it crashes instantly . 
  i can only do 1v1 battles ... you perhaps have a fix for this ? 
  you 're awesome dude . 
  another question , in 1v1 battles , do ranged units use their ranged weapons ? 
  because i tried to have an archer duel and they just charged each other :(, 
  thanks, 
  yeah , i 'd be fine with that . 
  however , i just tried the darthmod way and it still crashed :(, 
  it 's fine , i fixed it . 
  thank you so much for helping !, 
  custom battles are ridiculously fun now . 
  i 've got a max level nobunaga with 3 bodyguard fighting against 125 yari ashigaru . 
  decapitations everywhere . 
  i 'd imagine at 2.0 unit size it would only take like 1 unit of bow ashigaru to defend a whole castle -_-, 
  i imagine ca thought that nobody would bother to take a detailed shot of the cannonballs . 
  i just learnt today that you could edit the sizes of the units so it is only 1 person per unit . 
  i 'm guessing he just got a unit of each hero + yoshihiro and put then all together in one bunch . 
  i think the front three are crouching because their unit remains hidden when at a distance from the enemy . 
  just a guess ... 
  [ with these guys commentating of course !, 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/0gpkn_pmolg?t=27s ), 
  edit : i mixed up sitcom with game show -_-, 
  christ , just a handful of them sounded terrifying enough , now imagine pickett 's charge . 
  12,500 of them ? 
  i believe in you . 
  it 's ridiculously fun to play around with . 
  i was hoping to start a campaign with like 5 % unit size but it keeps crashing -_-, 
  pics mate , i do n't have the dlc . 
  glorious pics , now !, 
  op what the fuck is wrong with you ? 
  it 's going to be a bloodbath ... 
  easily total war : shogun 2, 
  is rd really between 13-19 provinces ? 
  in my otomo campaign it hit at 32 : s, 
  does it depend on difficulty as well ? 
  * who is secretly italian *, 
  ahhh , right , i was playing domination -_-, 
  i love this ... 
  * the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own -- populated with their own ambitions , friends , routines , worries and inherited craziness -- an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground , with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you 'll never know existed , in which you might appear only once , as an extra sipping coffee in the background , as a blur of traffic passing on the highway , as a lighted window at dusk . 
  i will tag you in res , our paths are destined to cross again . 
   full stack of motherfuckers you do n't wan na meet guarding the place . 
  get a maxed out metsuke : , 
  i 'm guessing it 's a mod . 
  or he kept giving them metric shitloads of koku every turn . 
  ** edit ** : kouk -  koku, 
  i want to actually try this out in shogun 2 tonight !, 
  does anyone want me to document it ? 
  [ sorry about the cannonball !!, 
  all my shogun 2 generals die of natural causes in the 60s ... 
  i was planning to do it as either shimazu or chosokabe . 
  i did it once with oda but got steamrolled when uesugi brought 2 fully maxed out armies of monks and samurai on my doorstep . 
  i do n't imagine arrows would 've caused too much damage to the hull of a ship . 
  then again , i very rarely use navies ... can you get cannons later on in the game ? 
  man , naval battles sound like a lot of fun but i just ca n't get into them -_-, 
  holy fuck , half of japan is lying at the bottom of that wall . 
  have an all general army and auto-resolve every battle . 
  from what i 've seen they seem to be pretty damn op . 
  battle of hakodate . 
  just curious , what differed between the factions in , say , empire ? 
  i 've only ever played shogun 2 and frankly i love it because i am absolutely obsessed with japanese history . 
  you 're fucking insane . 
  were you not afraid of your computer turning into a black hole ? 
  how many men per unit of bow ashigaru ?
