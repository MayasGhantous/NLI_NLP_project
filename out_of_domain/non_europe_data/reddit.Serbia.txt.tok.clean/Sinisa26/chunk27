  also , how many units participated in that battle . 
  you 're insane . 
  that my country did terrible things in the 90s . 
  on a lighter tone though , i kinda hate to admit that i listen to classical music . 
  you and me both brother . 
  i just do n't understand why ... 
  there is always like this 2 minute period just before i pull up to work where i get a raging hard-on . 
  it 's like clockwork man :(, 
  fuck , you just reminded me . 
  i have 6 days of holidays left and first day back i have both a maths assignment due and an english play to be performed . 
  i have n't started the maths and i have n't revised the english :'(, 
  i always though she was russian or ukrainian : /, 
  meanwhile i 've edited it so that each unit is only at 0.2 size instead of 1 . 
  my general has himself +7 bodyguards . 
  when you lose one , you do n't replenish the bodyguards until you upgrade the province + get all the buffs for extra replenishment rate . 
  this might sound weird , but with the smaller unit sizes ( 32 men in a yari samurai unit ) , i kinda develop relationships with my men and try to keep as much alive as possible . 
  my whole army has about 500 men all up , so yes , seiging an army is painful . 
  also , what the heck is up with darthmod archers ? 
  they 're so horrible . 
  yari ashigaru , they are worthy sacrifices .

  takeda still lives with his mum and does n't have a real job . 
  that 's why he has no horse . 
  i think i also vaguely remember , that kenshin cried in front of him men when he heard news of shingen 's death . 
  shingen , on his death bed , also commended uesugi as a great warrior and instructed his son to rely on kenshin . 
  in three years the takeda and uesugi clans would become allied . 
  the first part was n't , the second part was because i initially thought it was kenshin on his death bed who told his son to rely on takeda . 
  you can edit the game files which causes a change in the unit size to 1 person per unit . 
  i tried playing a campaign like this but it kept crashing :'(, 
  hey , i asked a relatively similar question a while ago . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/ydjpe/if_i_send_money_to_an_ally_will_he_actually_use/ ) are the responses , i hope they can help you :d, 
  christ , it 's been 7 months already . 
  i prefer to play my shogun 2 campaigns as the western factions ( shimazu , otomo , chosokabe , etc. . . ) , so naturally i ca n't really deal with the piece of shit honma until about realm divide . 
  and then of course they declare war on me . 
  and always send some fucking expeditions of maxed out , full stack samurai into my undefended provinces . 
  kanji drives me insane !, 
  i honestly do n't believe there is . 
  ca n't read without hearing coolio . 
  you 're obviously new here ... 
  general 's loyalty too low ? 
  about to cause a rebellion ? 
  adopt him into the family !, 
  have you watched ong bak ? 
  i should try to incorporate this . 
  hey , i asked this question a while ago and like to thing it brought up some worthy answers .

  enjoy !,

  hello , first off , thanks for the amazing answer . 
  it was very informative . 
   he was expected to be proficient with the sword , spear , and bow . 
  when i read that part , it reminded me of one of the quotes in shogun 2 by kato kiyomasa . 
   one should not be negligent in the way of the retainer . 
  one should rise at four in the morning , practice sword technique , eat one 's meal , and train with the bow , the gun , and the horse . 
  kiyomasa 's quote makes it sound as if every samurai around the late 1500s - early 1600s was in possession of a gun . 
  would this be true ? 
  once again , thanks for the amazing answer . 
  why the fuck does having a couple troops there as ` aid ' constitute an invasion . 
  ... the fuck ? 
  the sad part is nowadays , that if you fight back ( even in self-defence ) , you will likely be suspended or expelled . 
  1 serbian killer, 
  you can edit the unit sizes to be 1 person per unit . 
  ahhhhh , i miss the old dynasty warriors ... 
  there 's always next time buddy . 
  i actually did this as the chosokabe recently . 
  i only left kono as my enemy just so i 'd have something interesting go down once in a while . 
  eventually , kono became my vassal ... then they landed an army on japanese mainland and conquered so many provinces , i was afraid of realm divide hitting . 
  eventually , murakami and date emerged as the big players . 
  all of japan was under their combined control through alliance . 
  i was n't happy with that so i forced them to go to war with eachother . 
  and for about 30ish years straight , they fought over about 2 provinces . 
  i gave up soon after that . 
  murakami was the shogunate . 
  date really badly wanted a trade agreement with me ( i have no idea why since i only had one province ) . 
  i told him to `` break off trade/alliance '' with murakami , and ~ ~ realm divide did the rest for me . ~ ~, 
  is that only if you have an alliance with them ? 
  oh wait , you 're right . 
  there was no realm divide at that point . 
  i do n't know why they went to war then , but their relations got worse and worse every round ... perhaps it was because murakami was the shogun ? 
  holy fuck , the linesman at the back with the red shirt must 've gotten pretty messed up . 
  that would 've been fucking terrifying . 
  [ were you trying to pull a piksi ? 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqpr43v64e4 ), 
  holy shit so dramatic ... 
  dude , this is a fucking amazing idea . 
  i 'm sick of trying to build alliances but constantly having them destroyed by other allies of mine ... 
  well if the shimazu [ can win a 1:10 battle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_kizaki ) , i 'm sure the takeda can atleast hold up a formidable fight against this coalition . 
  zhou tai 's curved sword . 
  i was wondering , can a dermatologist remove sunspots or `` moles '' ? 
  i have a crapload on my face and back :(, 
  seriously , i think that voice actor did the best job !, 
  [ 5:54 ] ( http://youtu.be/nja9v1vn2te?t=5m54s ), 
  it happened with me as well , i just played the game for like 7-8 minutes then the voice stopped . 
  never dreamt that i would see a `` the castle '' reference on reddit !, 
  i 've had it happen plenty of times with ammo . 
  she could use her fucking stomach as a table ...
