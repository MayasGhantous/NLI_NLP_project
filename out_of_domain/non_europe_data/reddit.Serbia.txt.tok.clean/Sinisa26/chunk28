  i 'm still here ... 
  in my experiences , this only works on this particular castle . 
  your yari ca n't be flanked . 
  they only hold the enemy attackers at bay while the archers behind them completely destroy the enemy . 
  most of the units that rout generally get out safely . 
  in my experiences , this tactic only works on this particular castle . 
  your yari ca n't be flanked . 
  they only hold the enemy attackers at bay while the archers behind them completely destroy the enemy . 
  i have plenty of screenshots of this particular tactic . 
  if you 'd like to see them ? 
  edit : hell , i 'll post them if you do n't ask , i just want to get my total war boner going . 
  that last picture is not related , i do n't know how it got in there ... 
  this is during a siege so the cavalry dismount before entering . 
  my wording was a bit iffy on the first post . 
  what i kinda meant was that it works best on this map . 
  also yes , one of the greatest feelings in any battle is just leaving a trail of dead bodies as you chase down the routing units . 
  not to mention that the video was posted nearly a full year before the game was released . 
  it may have been a promotional video or something ... 
  ** edit ** : also found [ this thread ] ( http://forums.totalwar.com/showthread.php/7100-dueling ) for you . 
  it seems to me like they are talking about this particular video . 
  once again , i meant that it works best on this particular castle . 
  sorry i am not a native english speaker ... 
  the fuck happened here ? 
  leave !, 
  you still have time brother !, 
  what kind of dog is that ? 
  [ another horrible title ... ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/wtf/comments/13bnkp/tambourine_of_power/ ), 
  karakina city is a map you can download from the steam workshop . 
  just search ` karakina city ' . 
  i would recommend you give it a try , it is a great map . 
  another great map is ` rocky retreat ' . 
  sorry i can not help you with the unit :(, 
  could it be [ this ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=106197648&amp;searchtext= ) one ? 
  i think in fots , when i have artillery with me . 
  i travel about two-thirds of the distance than i would without artillery . 
  i think that fair enough . 
  unreal ... 
  are we talking provinces ? 
  or individual factions ? 
  perfect reading material for before bed . 
  my humble thanks ... 
  is dw8 kingdom story or character story ? 
  sorry , i 've been out of the loop d :, 
  you should check out / r/colorizedhistory then , plenty of quality submissions there !, 
  well , if you had 23 full stacks of men hammering down on each other in real life , there 'd probably be a couple repetitions with names as well . 
  in my class of 24 people last year there were 3 people with the exact same name . 
  i know that 's an incredible coincidence , but still ... 
  i love this idea . 
  anything that helps me form a stronger attachment with my men i am all for . 
  i 'd also like it if `` wounded in battle '' stats would correspond with well , the number of wounds on the man 's body . 
  but maybe i 'm asking for too much . 
  wow , you should do more of this . 
  try do some battles :d, 
  who is that dedicated , honestly ? 
  i always feel sad when i see that warphalange 's legitimate comments ( the ones that actually add to the discussion ) are downvoted to hell . 
  but that 's not cool !, 
  i always seem to find a certain satisfaction when i see my general charging into the enemy ranks and watching him ruthlessly kill the opponents . 
  you ca n't just say this and not link it , come on man ... 
  link ? 
  should n't christianity , you know , hinder them ? 
  nah , i believe it 's a scar under his right eye . 
  he has it in my [ original picture as well . 
  i meant it as ` version 2 ' , because i posted a similar image with the same person ( model ) about to get utterly destroyed .

  what does [ v2 ] mean in that / r/paradoxplaza place ? 
  quick question , what kind of jobs are opened up to you when you have a history degree ? 
  museum curator ? 
  y' all some messed up mother fuckers ... 
  balkans ? 
  sheltering cherry ; my last breath stirs your blossom ; my soul ascends . 
  i was saving up to go to japan , but seeing as `` shogun 2 's reign is now over '' , i 'm using my money on preordering the collector 's edition . 
  i think it makes much more sense for the `` total war : '' to come before the actual game name . 
  so good on ca !, 
  i just pre-ordered the collector 's edition :d, 
  absolutely over the moon right now !, 
  i believe so . 
  i would be very disappointed if i did n't .

  i 'm not from the us either , my questions marks were n't meant to sound like `` how could you not know this '' , it was meant to sound like `` could it possibly be a reference to this ? 
  my humble apologies .

  why, 
  that was actually , really interesting ... 
  now stick your dick into it . 
  op , you 're gon na get crumbs everywhere !, 
  you are definitely not one of the few , every 3 or so days there is one of these threads , and one of the top options are always three kingdoms . 
  but yes , i do want it as well . 
  crap , i just pre-ordered the ce for more than that , i am not a smart man ... 
  this reminds me of some sort of celebrity super smash brothers ... 
  playing the `` sekigahara campaing '' for shogun 2 , i severely overestimated my `` starting hero unit '' . 
  got 3 of my generals and my hero unit killed :(, 
  i recently downloaded the sekigahara campaign mod for shogun 2 , it seems like whenever an enemy province is bordering one of my provinces , my ally sends about half a stack of units just to stand next to my castle , in case of attack . 
  unfortunately they are n't around anymore , they sacrificed their armies and left their own provinces undefended just so they could defend mine :'(, 
  hori hidemasa you glorious bastard . 
  only 1450 's kids will remember this !, 
  what the fuck, 
  the hell kind of a joke was that ? 
  yes , of course , i told myself i would n't put underestimated down , but i still did it d :,
