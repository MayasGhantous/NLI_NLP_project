  it 's in my original comment :d, 
  sacrifices must be made . 
  i think it was called `` vertical '' from the steam workshop !, 
  yeah , they mass routed and got pretty fucked up . 
  my sister ( 12 years old ) told me about one of her classmates who are pregnant . 
  they still are n't in high school ... 
  not just that , it 's ( imo ) one of the best games in the world , and for a lot of us , our old playstation 2 's or old ffx discs are no longer available , so it allows us to replay our old memories . 
  yay !, 
  more total war fans !, 
  come join us at / r/totalwar :d, 
  well from the last time this was posted , it was all but confirmed that she was a kabuki actor . 
  however , it still is an amazing photo . 
  the mon of the armour belongs to the taira clan ( as you have pointed out op ) , however , by the late 1800s ( when this photo was taken ) , the taira clan had n't existed for around 600 years . 
  [ here 's an old thread !,

  wow !, 
  that was an amazing video , really brought in a strong sense of [ sonder !,

  and now i 'm craving sushi . 
  if the person in ops picture is indeed a kabuki actor ( which seems likely ) , then the odds are that it is a male , females were generally prohibited from participating in kabuki . 
  fair point . 
  it 'd be good if you could ally yourself with like 2 or 3 of the clans , then ( assuming you are the shimazu ) launch an attack against one of the enemy ships and have your new ` allies ' come as reinforcements .

  even genghis khan lost some early battles . 
  how can you expect to become a warlord without even trying ? 
  ahh , so that explains why all the shrapnel from my cannonballs that hit directly infront of the general kills everyone but him . 
  well , the article says that over half has already been snapped up , so if i were you , i 'd hurry up if you want to catch one :p, 
  god damn , read like 20 pages before i realised i had to read from right-to-left -_-, 
  how can they be so serious while wearing those pants d :, 
  i miss you ... 
  the smell !, 
  i thought it was a pokemon . 
  i do work there , and it does suck ... 
  can i just ask what is so bad about it ? 
  i work there and it seems fine ... 
  lucy pinder . 
  i recognized the elite onna bushi , op as all hell !, 
  robina town centre , australia . 
  checking in ... 
  on second thought , i 'm sure i would regret reading it . 
  thanks for policing the subs so well !, 
  convinced my co-worker i had an arranged marriage on my 18th ... 
  i think he still believes me ... 
  they were killed with their own weapons . 
  wow , he looks ridiculously good for his age !, 
  pretty gnarly stuff ... 
  hmmm , maybe instead of choosing them individually before a battle . 
  i was thinking that the traits you choose should reflect what they say . 
  for example , if your general has a trait that gives him +6 melee attack , he will brag about how many men he will kill in the following battle . 
  and so on ... 
  it does , but sometimes you play the vanilla too much and you just need a change of pace ... 
  i play like 5 vanilla campaigns for every radious campaign i do . 
  i do n't play much darthmod because i hate the changes it does to archer accuracy :(, 
  is that abraham lincoln ? 
  i do n't quite understand what you mean , sorry english is my second language ... 
  amazing post !, 
  can i ask however , do you get all these images from the same website ? 
  interesting that i just did an essay on orwell 's * 1984 * , and now i keep seeing it all over reddit ... 
  this is wtf worthy content . 
  thank you op , for not posting another overweight person . 
  senior . 
  i think the last time i saw this picture , someone said that one of those two guys was emperor hirohito . 
  hmmm , i noticed belgrade there , does serbia start out as a minor faction ? 
  or is it under the ottoman empire ? 
  another thing , you can also click the `` n '' button to zoom in which makes for some great cinematic screenshots !, 
  thank you ?

  that was a majestic leap over the barbed wire , i would 've fucked that up so bad ... 
  vanilla lets you go past 1600 . 
  do n't pursue lu bu ... 
  man , my undefended province was attacked by a force of 1440 ashigaru , i only had 60 samurai retainers . 
  those brave motherfuckes killed like 650 of the enemy . 
  christ , this thread is so depressing . 
  `` i love you '' , is what i want to to say ... 
  that is like half a kilo a day !, 
  i know crap-all about weight loss , but yeah you 're right , that does seem a bit unhealthy , maybe even dangerous . 
  i had like an 80 year old geisha ... 
  her picture looked like she was 20 . 
  that part about hitler reminds me of george orwell 's * 1984 * novel . 
  if you have n't yet read it i would strongly recommend you do !, 
  i 've got some pictures of the battle if you want ... 
  man , the best feeling is killing him with one of the qiao sisters !, 
  what ?

  i want to believe ...
