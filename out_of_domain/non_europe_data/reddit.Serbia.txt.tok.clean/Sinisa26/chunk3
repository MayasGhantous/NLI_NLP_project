  this made the ottoman army very powerful ; until the janissary revolt of 1838 , at which point these forces were dissolved . 
   the millet system allowed the ottomans to rule subject peoples effectively , without the annoyance of having to interfere in the affairs of people of unfamiliar cultures . 
  this allowed , for example , the greek millet , the armenian millet , and so on , responsibility for their internal affairs ; the turks only stepped in if it concerned the turks . 
   the millet system meant that separate cultures remained distinct ; this kind of diversity made it difficult for subject peoples of different backgrounds to unite and rebel .

  a quick search around the web has led me to flavius belisarius . 
   flavius belisarius ( greek : \u0392\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 , ca . 
  500 [ 1 ] -- 565 ) was a general of the byzantine empire . 
  he was instrumental to emperor justinian 's ambitious project of reconquering much of the mediterranean territory of the former western roman empire , which had been lost less than a century previously . 
   one of the defining features of belisarius ' career was his success despite the little or no support he received from justinian . 
  he is also among a select group of men considered by historians to be the `` last of the romans '' .

  i 'd also imagine it would provide a large amount of psychological problems . 
  i guess the enemy could be shown as barbaric by doing this , thus creating fear amongst the civilians and/or soldiers . 
  i did read it , albeit not thoroughly enough . 
  however i would still like to thank you for correcting me , 
  i love my country . 
  haruko , i 'm gon na go ahead and guess it 's some anime . 
  this is just strange as fuck, 
  i just do n't see the appeal to twilight . 
  wow , those threads have some interesting points . 
  especially the one that says the smiley face evolved from the `` submissive grin '' which means you are harmless and therefore you are friendly . 
  thanks for these links , 
  i think it should definitely be more common , i can rarely enjoy a new movie today as i could 15-10 or even 5 years ago . 
  they all have this special effects and crap but none of them have a good story or heart . 
  my local cinema i think has played one classic film and it was the 3d version of titanic . 
  i 'd love to watch them all over again in cinemas . 
  bonus points for watching it in the cinema with the same person you watched the original with :d, 
  how does this make sense ? 
  that 's fucked up man , is there any way of curing/fixing it ? 
  also , has it lead to many awkward encounters during sexy times , assuming you 've had any ? 
  sorry if this sounds harsh , 
  maybe you could interact with the gods through temples you built dedicated to them . 
  then depending on how much you worshipped them over other gods they could help you/smite you during battles or unleash famines on your land . 
  for some reason , i just consider rpg 's where you level up a character and increase their skills . 
  i just see so much opportunity for a game of this theme/setting . 
  it has rarely been used before and a lot of the features it would provide would seem new and fresh . 
  yes definitely , i 'd imagine it would need realism to be successful ( e.g. 
  water , food ) . 
  thanks , i might have a look into that one :d, 
  holy crap !, 
  how have i not heard of this game yet . 
  it 's not set in ancient egypt but it still looks amazing . 
  i 'll definitely have to give this one a try . 
  thank you for posting this :d, 
  will do . 
  thanks for this , 
  wow , i 'm so glad i used the search function ( for once ) . 
  i was going to make a post asking for books on several different topics . 
  but this has all i need . 
  thank you very much , 
  edit : do you guys have a website you would recommend me ? 
  because all the libraries around me are really small ones . 
  still worth a look though . 
  edit2 : i looked up all the books that i want on amazon and it 's totaling $ 230.09 , which is a reasonable price . 
  thank you for that , i really would like to know a lot more about my own culture and country , 
  yes , i do speak and read serbian . 
  thanks for this link . 
  the mark mazower one seems a bit too recent ( 1900 onwards ) , however i will still have a look at it . 
  there are some really good ones listed there . 
  thank you , 
  haha , perhaps i did n't word it right . 
  yeah , reading over my post it does seem like i was looking for one book . 
  in reality i am looking for ** books ** which provide insight into somewhere along the time period i provided . 
  however , thanks for the links , 
  i see , i was just basically searching for serbian history which would always take me to books 1900 onwards . 
  and once again i did n't think about it like the way you said . 
   vinca culture is not exclusively related to serbian history as serbia, 
   did n't exist then . 
  edit : oh lawdy , i think i just found the perfect [ book !, 
  ] ( http://www.amazon.com/the-serbs-peoples-europe/dp/0631204717/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1341237647&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=serbian+history ), 
  the way the eyes move when it takes a bite , it just looks like the shark is wearing a massive mask as a disguise . 
  also , wtf is up with the gills during the last seconds . 
  is your friend in any way related to tommy flanagan ? 
  just watched that mother fucker jump from 0.6 kb/s to 300kb/s . 
  it 's still pretty slow but a metric shitload worth of improvement . 
  thanks heaps for this , 
  living in serbia , 90s . 
  battle of kosovo . 
  obviously i 've chosen this choice because of my serbian heritage . 
  or , maybe i 'd go with sterling or wu zhang plains . 
  hell , i 'd be happy to watch any war where swords/spears/bows were used over firearms . 
  i hate the invention of firearms . 
  and although he 's fed for a lifetime , he 'll call you a cheapskate for not giving him your fish . 
  found it for all you fine gentlemen .

  i imagine your form of blushing would be [ this ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/type_ia_supernova ), 
  edit : in a pinkish/red tone of course . 
  wikipedia still states it is still completely filled with litter and is the most polluted river in the world . 
  edit : that 's assuming you are correct and it is the [ pasig river ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pasig_river ), 
  edit2 : found it , it 's the [ citarum river ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/citarum_river ) . 
  while yes some parts have been cleaned it 's still polluted . 
  but good on them . 
  it looks like a beautiful body of water ( when cleaned of course ) . 
  edit3 : just realised it 's been stated a couple times in this thread what river it is , do n't bother upvoting me . 
  i 'm so sorry , i 'll fix that . 
  kinda forgot :(, 
  explains why i seemed to lose so many units , had them in the back line :(, 
  because i 'm an idiot .
