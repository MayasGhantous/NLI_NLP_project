  by far my favourite three kingdoms movie . 
  what the fuck, 
  wow , i would love the be one of those people moving in . 
  i never thought i 'd see this picture make it out of our little / r/totalwar subreddit !, 
  that was exactly my thought !, 
  awesome , will this take effect for dynasty warriors 9 ? 
  with love turkey , from serbia !, 
  now imagine , if you had the opportunity to go back in time , could you kill a baby ? 
  crap , sorry , i was in a hurry to catch my bus !, 
  did n't watch the video thank you . 
  when i first got it i was hoping to learn some history from it , but as soon as it mentioned fountains of youth , i threw away that sentiment and just played through the game . 
  still a great game though . 
  i started cs : s when i was 12 as well , 17 now ... 
  i have 1600 hours on it . 
  i hate when factions lose their `` historical , big name '' daimyo in like the first 10 turns ... 
  `` oh , it 's good scottish weather , madam . 
  the rain is falling straight down . 
  well , slightly to the side like . '', 
  we are about to witness the beginning of a great battle ... 
  milka , motherfucking milka , it 's been so long since i 've had you ... 
  another point of interest from the total war facebook page ;, 
  `` you can indeed sail up the nile with ships '', 
  i wonder if the ships will be able to assist in nearby battles ? 
  kinda like the naval artillery in fots . 
  that sounds amazing , but unfortunately , it also sounds a bit too difficult for me , controlling both men and ships at the same time . 
  i was really expecting to see some cops stopping 5 year olds from going at each other . 
  this was such a lovely argument . 
  needs more samurai, 
  the fuck does this have to do with ninja ? 
  they are mocking you . 
  do not accept , do not show weakness ... 
  sounds like my grandma . 
  i like to put the game in slow motion , zoom in close to all the death . 
  and listen to this ... 
  i also like to play it at normal speed , while we are charging and listen to this ... ( particularly the part where they yell around 1:15 ), 
  `` shut up '', 
  - dad, 
  ca n't believe people are upvoting this shit . 
  i am sorry for what the animals of my country did to your city . 
  yes he is . 
  just for future reference , it 's called a [ horo ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horo_ ( cloak \\ ) ) . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kvjepcv.jpg ) is your general , the one without the horo . 
  ** mod : ** the sekigahara campaign ( i would recommend everyone try this out ! ), 
  wow , i was stacking these at kmart the other day , i even looked at that sequence of three pictures and did n't notice that . 
  time to tell all my co-workers and steal all your credit op !, 
  sorry mate , but you 've got your fair share of 2,730 upvotes . 
  i do n't know if this applies to all kmarts , or just the one i work at , but do you guys have to memorise the `` carl '' policy as well ? 
  they 've really been pushing as to learn it , and give random pop quizzes to see if you know it . 
  basically it is something like ;, 
  compliance, 
  availability, 
  labels, 
  man , i 'm stuck in replen ... 
  i envy your position !, 
  yeah pretty much , we just restock the shelves , break down pallets and do our manager 's bidding . 
  we 're situated in the middle of a big mall so we do n't have to worry about chasing stray shopping carts , i guess that 's one positive thing ... 
  christ , 6,000 upvotes in 3 hours . 
  our vending machines do n't even work ... 
  macedon , about as close as i can get to my serbia ( even though we did n't really exist back then ) ... 
  though , i think sparta will be my second favourite ... 
  despite the downvotes you seem to be amassing , i actually like your idea . 
  i only have a select few friends who play total war and trying to find a time that is fitting to both of our schedules is indeed difficult . 
  it would be nice if we could both do our individual turns while the other is offline or busy . 
  but it does take away a bit of the fun , which is having a live spectator watching you crash hordes of honma scum . 
  ** p.s. 
  someone needs to mod this into rome ii ... 
  or is this already an attribute ? 
  it probably gives you the ability to initiate a night attack as well . 
  i do n't understand why this is n't an option from the get-go . 
  damn , i just had a massive essay written out for you about all the changes , but i accidentally refreshed the page . 
  this [ thread ] ( http://www.twcenter.net/forums/showthread.php?537916-the-sekigahara-campaign-defining-features-at-a-glance - ( aka-what-makes-it-different-from-the-rest-of-the-other-mods \\ ) ) might give you some sort of an idea , however , nothing can compare to actually trying it out yourself , it is relatively simple to install and has it 's own launcher . 
  ** edit ** : i also found [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz4npad8hb8 ) trailer for it . 
  ** edit2 ** : an even more recent [ trailer ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7ou5rhui7e ) . 
  nope , it 's a great mod that completely overhauls the game , it 's called the `` sekigahara campaign '' , i would strongly recommend you try it !, 
  it was my pleasure !, 
  believe me , it did . 
  this is the one game i want to play before i die . 
  wait , was n't the crossbow invented by the chinese ? 
  or are you talking about a ballista ? 
  curved helmet man is heir to the kinoshita throne , [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vigc18j.jpg ) is the daimyo . 
  i know they 've said it 's not gon na happen . 
  but please ubisoft , make a feudal japan one . 
  that 's not rust , that 's the blood of his brothers . 
  i knew i saw it somewhere when i went on my japanese history binge !, 
  thank you for showing me again !!, 
  they said that they do n't plan to change the unit cards anymore ... 
  really strange about their stance on the blood pack . 
  for a game that was meant to be `` gritty and dark '' , no blood does n't do it justice . 
  light monk infanty iirc ... 
  comes with radious unit mod . 
  op , it 's time to make history . 
  oh yes , i definitely know about that . 
  it 's just the fact that they 're `` not sure '' about a blood pack dlc . 
  i ca n't wait until charles takes the throne . 
  i always want sushi . 
  that 's quite the ... uhh ... army composition you have there . 
  thank you for this , please take pictures/videos where possible !, 
  fuck this . 
  could we have a link please ? 
  [ by far my favourite one !,
