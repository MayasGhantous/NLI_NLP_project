  made with the tears of a thousand historians . 
  it 's okay , i stole it from someone else , share the love !, 
  congratulations on become top post of all time in the / r/totalwar subreddit !, 
  sekigahara campaign - yukinaga 's tachi guard, 
  i 'm gon na miss those three melee units . 
  they 've been with me since the start of the campaign . 
  ** rally point ** : will we have mechanical elephants , that breathe fire , and destroy enemy walls in one hit ? '', 
  ** julian ** : dlc, 
  just thought the empire/napoleon players would get a kick out of this . 
  [ here 's a video of it ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvh28w-cy7e ) !, 
  i have a horrible , horrible habit of always not saving my battle replays , i do n't know why . 
  as soon as that end screen comes up my hands just automatically click ` end battle ' . 
  the best part is , `` erwin rommel '' ( one of the modders for the `` sekigahara campaign '' ) is planning to release an update to his mod in which he adds even more clans and regions since he 's figured out how to do it . 
  i do n't think many people on / r/totalwar play the sekigahara campaign though :(, 
  i would really recommend everyone tries it at least once . 
  everything pretty much . 
  it 's like a whole new campaign . 
  it 's very easy to set-up and it has it 's own launcher . 
  about 30 or so playable clans all with their individual `` hero/starting '' units . 
  every clan either supports the toyotomi or the tokugawa . 
  and there is a lot more other stuff i ca n't remember . 
  once again , i 'd strongly recommend you give it a try if vanilla shogun is losing it 's spark . 
  total war in a nutshell ? 
  i 'm glad i could help . 
  it 's my favourite total war only because i 'm a massive japanese history nerd . 
  i do n't know what your budget is , but i got this comp for $ 1,000 . 
  it 's just so beautiful . 
  it 's just so beautiful , it 's like a carpet of bodies . 
  all glory to the jozai , may your conquest be fast yet bloody . 
  that was the most mouth-watering article i 've ever read . 
  man , # 11 made me feel good . 
  the man just looks so happy !, 
  come to think of it , i do remember there being an `` auto_save '' file when i went to watch my replays ... oh well , too late now . 
  can you do this with shinsengumi as well ? 
  incite rebellions in your allies ' land ? 
  what exactly does `` rated 3 to 1 '' mean ? 
  they have three times more troops than you ? 
  i 've only played shogun 2 ... is that basically the auto-resolve bar ? 
  sorry , i 'm a bit clueless d :, 
  ahh , i see ... 
  well then , i submit [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/a/p5ml1#0 ) battle that i posted a while ago . 
  i did n't get a picture of the odds screen but i feel it was fairly close to 3:1 . 
  to think that he was born some 30-40 years after the abolishment of the samurai class is mind-blowing to me . 
  you need more pictures of dead bodies . 
  great battle . 
  i fought a similar one recently ( same numbers ) , but your enemy had much more elite units than my enemy . 
  good work man !, 
  you need more pictures of dead bodies . 
  man , my brother is such an asshole . 
  i remember when he used that ` shortcut ' , his response when i told him to stop using it was `` if they did n't want people to use it , they would n't have put it in the game '', 
  taken from ca 's facebook page . 
  * `` a total war : rome ii screen shot exclusive for you guys . 
  how many different unit types can you see in this battle by the port ? 
  it 's crazy , half the comments are complaints over the egyptian outfits ... 
  complete guess here , but maybe the fact that their skin is glossy is because they are in a hot/humid environment and maybe it 's meant to look like sweat . 
  well , as i see it , the game 's marketing is going in phases . 
  phase 1 : rome - carthage, 
  phase 2 : rome - barbarians ( teutoburg ), 
  phase 3 : rome - egypt, 
  phase 4 : greek states ?? 
  i know about the greek states , i have them pre-ordered :d, 
  i was just guessing that ca might focus on them after their egypt marketing phase is over . 
  i can never get over how huge that carthagian 's nose is . 
  i wish that there would be an option to play through [ the second serbian uprising ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_serbian_uprising ) , maybe as a historical battle . 
  i just want to play as my beautiful serbia :(, 
  i still ca n't use those fuckers , except in siege battles ... 
  does the `` sell military access for money '' tactic work on normal as well ? 
  whenever i try to sell it no one want it d :, 
  alright , sweet , i 'll check it out now . 
  playing as tosa i 've got myself into a bit of a predicament ... 
  way ahead of ya !, 
  it 's just , 3 and a half stacks of enemy troops at my doorstep at the moment . 
  subutai , for sure . 
  [ guy looked creepy as fuck though . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/subudei.jpg/400px-subudei.jpg ), 
  i do n't think they will be the best combo , but me and my friend are planning to go first round as arveni-suebi . 
  i have shogun pictures as my computer wallpaper so as soon as i start the computer up i get a horrible urge to play it !, 
  it truly is a beautiful game ... 
  light pollution ? 
  immortality ... 
  depends upon many factors i guess , like will i still age ? 
  mentally ? 
  i think it 's fine as long as it is n't a stand-alone submission ... 
  i think it 's kind if ridiculous when we have to rely on a mod to fix one of the most important mechanics of war simulator ... 
  beheadings are always the best way to end a battle . 
  and if you guys wan na see the before shot . 
  took me a while . 
  i saw the hands and thought they were basically the same thing as shogun 2 's flying ribs everywhere . 
  one shot to the ankle , have some ribs . 
  these guys frequent up to 700 kills every * large * battle , and are completely capable of clearing a whole castle . 
  only issue is that they run out of ammo quick due to their high reload speed . 
  they can take out a whole unit of 260 su-yari ashigaru in about 3 volleys . 
  belgrade would still be under ottoman rule . 
  i 'm sorry forefathers , i failed you .

  200 , it may be a bit higher than 60 accuracy though . 
  ** edit : ** just double checked , it 's 75 accuracy .
