  vivian you bitch !, 
  [ is this more suited to your liking ? 
  the decapitation is in the blood pack . 
  the animation is still in the vanilla game except he does n't get decapitated , looks like he gets slapped by the sword . 
  it 's one of the most rewarding things to do imo . 
  but do n't get distracted and lose the fight :p, 
  uhhh , most bows retain their normal range . 
  matchlocks go up to 125 . 
  the hankyu samurai make up for it by completely obliterating anything in that 100 range though . 
  by far it 's my favourite mod . 
  complete overhaul . 
  like a whole new game i reckon . 
  fucking animals, 
  only available in the sekigahara campaign mod . 
  the official blood pack dlc . 
  not really . 
  sekigahara campaign is based on the prelude to the battle of sekigahara . 
  akin to fots , each clan has a side which they support . 
  you try to unite the land . 
  there are new factions , new agents , new units , new buildings , new mastery of the arts . 
  and with the next update the creators plan to make new provinces as well . 
  ** edit ** : i completely misread the question . 
  continue reading if you want to learn about some interesting trivia about serbia during wwi . 
  i ca n't offer nearly as much insight as the scholars of this subreddit already have , but i think an important part to remember about serbia 's involvement is the fact that they lost roughly 25 % of their whole population . 
  they initially held off three ( ? ), 
  invasions mounted by the austro-hungarian forces . 
  all the while the austro-hungarian forces had a significantly bigger army and had more advanced equipment . 
  eventually serbia was forced to retreat through albania and montenegro . 
  where they met up with allied forces and charged back into belgrade to reclaim it . 
  the serbian general , dragutin gavrilovi\u0107 will always be remembered for the speech he gave to his men before an ultimately unsuccessful charge in which he was badly wounded . 
  * `` soldiers , exactly at three o'clock , the enemy is to be crushed by your fierce charge , destroyed by your grenades and bayonets . 
  the honor of belgrade , our capital , must not be stained . 
  soldiers !, 
  heroes !, 
  the supreme command has erased our regiment from its records . 
  our regiment has been sacrificed for the honor of belgrade and the fatherland . 
  therefore , you no longer need to worry about your lives : they no longer exist . 
  so , forward to glory !, 
  for the king and the fatherland !, 
  long live the king , long live belgrade !, 
  ** fun fact : ** when the allied forces began their march back to belgrade , it was said that the serbians were so eager to get their hometown back that the french general ( louis franchet d'esp\u00e8rey ) radioed the serbian general ( \u017divojin mi\u0161i\u0107 ) and said something along the lines of `` sir , please tell the serbian infantry to slow down , the french cavalry can not keep up ! '' . 
  sorry if i am rambling on or some parts are unreadable , english is not my first language . 
  yep , v0 .95 is the most recent . 
  we 're long overdue for an update :(, 
  additionally , you will need [ this ] ( http://www.twcenter.net/forums/downloads.php?do=file&amp;id=3942 ) !, 
  i hope all goes smoothly for you , there are a couple of hiccups in the mod but it 's expected and not too detracting from the overall experience . 
  if you have any issues just let me know and i 'll be glad to help you !, 
  yep , some clans start with two . 
  serious ? 
  i thought you only needed an account to be able to download from them ... have they sent you an e-mail activation ? 
  no worries , i was happy to help !, 
  only the base shogun 2 is required . 
  however , if you do have the ikko ikki/hattori clan packs you will have an extra 6 clans to choose from . 
  similarly , if you have the unit dlc packs , there will be some extra units for you to choose from . 
  wow , maybe they are better . 
  however , the reason why i like the ukita clan so much is because they get two hero units . 
  the second is a hero naginata samurai unit !, 
  and also as an added bonus , the ukita clan can recruit miyamoto musashi once they build the legendary kenjutsu dojo ( ? 
  did you edit the preferences.script to make the unit sizes bigger ? 
  because ` ultra ' puts yari ashigaru to 200 men per unit . 
  in the options menu you can change unit size to ` ultra ' which will set yari ashigaru to 200 men per unit . 
  if that 's still not enough , you can edit the preferences.script to set it to be any size you want . 
  i once had it set at 2000 men per unit ... not fun :(, 
  do more trade ships on a node bring in more revenue ? 
  for example , will a node with two trade ships be worth more than a node with one trade ship ? 
  i do n't know if it has been revealed/announced/hinted at . 
  but i really want a god damned family tree . 
  not some crap that only spans 3 generations . 
  i want a fully fledged family tree . 
   when major siege engines were developed , the siegers would cut down trees to build them outside of the walls . 
  just curious , what use would this have ? 
  was it just for the easier access to wood ? 
  shade ? 
  on wow , my brain omitted the `` engines '' part of his post ... 
  that makes a lot more sense then . 
  thanks !, 
  japan attempted to invade korea twice in the late 1500s , but they were unsuccessful . 
  then they successfully invaded them in the 1900s . 
  that may have caused a bit of bad blood between them . 
  in addition china contributed to japan 's losses in the first two korean invasions . 
  then the sino-japanese wars were pretty brutal between them . 
  and i 'm sure i do n't need to tell you about the nanking massacre/rape of nanking ? 
  ah well , i 'm sure my wrong reference still gave some people a good laugh . 
  and that 's all i ever really hoped for . 
  not enemy ai , but my own unit 's ai seems to piss me off more often than the enemy . 
  in siege battles , if i tell them to go to a different section of the wall , the unit just freezes . 
  this happens about 50 % of the time . 
  they 'll run like half way there , then just stop and proceed to get massacred . 
  as an attacker , my unit has 55 more range than the enemy unit on the walls . 
  but for some reason my guys do n't want to fire until they are in the enemy 's range , completely negating the whole advantage . 
  and one more thing , pathing ... 
  honestly , how do you fuck that up ? 
  wtf ... 
  i do love it , but i hate how fast it zooms in and out :(, 
  that geisha must 've had a hard time with all those men around . 
  this is awesome , thank you !, 
  dude , 48 years of age . 
  man has seen some shit . 
  there 's a new mod in the workshop that allows you to do this .
