  i 'm not sure if it is in vanilla shogun 2 , or a mod that i played . 
  but tokugawa start out as a vassal under the imagawa . 
  basically you ca n't declare war on anyone except for the people your ruling clan is currently at war with . 
  on the other hand you can also attack your ruling clan but suffer negative diplomacy points . 
  it worked out quite well ... 
  awww hell yes , time to add onto my background rotation !,

  ** p.s.

  my mistake , thank you for that . 
  haha , i 'm aware . 
  i was born in serbia but moved to australia after the war , so my cyrillic is a bit rusty .

  it would be great if it was an easter egg or something .

  i think very recently there had been a breakthrough in modding the shogun 2 campaign map . 
  someone has added 7 new provinces . 
  i think they even have a part of hokkaido in the shogun 2 ( not fots ) .

  i never realised how completely ridiculous it looks spelled out ... 
  considering how russia treated it 's soldiers in wwi/wwii , it is truly a testament to the fertility of the russian women that the country even exists anymore . 
  there was also an animation in shogun 2 that i 've only seen once in over 800 hours of gameplay .

  it looks very nice and streamlined , and the way the city gets upgraded looks amazing !, 
  i got ~ 2000 with artillery once . 
  on sekigahara campaign my hankyu samurai frequent up to ~ 1300 each seige battle . 
  i wonder if the army names are randomly generated ? 
  or do you change them ? 
  yeah , i did n't quite understand the city construction interface either , but i 'm sure it will all work out in the end , as for the unit cards , i 've finally started to accept them .

  the mod is the sekigahara campaign . 
  these guys are actually yumi-naginata ashigaru , so they are capable in both melee and range . 
  small amount of ammo though . 
  just to piggyback on this post , does anyone have the `` ninja '' or `` attack '' card that they are willing to trade ?

  ** disclaimer ** : english is n't my first language so there might be a few passages in this post which may sound a bit strange . 
  please forgive me if you come across any !, 
  ** first mongol invasion of japan ( 1274 ) **, 
  during the first mongol invasion of japan , the japanese were greatly outnumbered but fought courageously against the invaders . 
  when night fell the battered japanese forces withdrew a few miles inland and [ took cover behind some defensive walls ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/takezaki_suenaga_ekotoba_bourui.jpg ) . 
  here they decided they would wait for reinforcements from honshu . 
  the invaders also had decided to retreat and recuperate . 
  during the night a large storm set in and the korean boat pilots were worried that the winds would push and destroy their ships against the rocks , which would effectively maroon them on japan . 
  they managed to talk the mongol generals into reembarking on the ships to avoid this disaster . 
  but instead they sailed right into the heart of the storm . 
  [ by dawn , nearly a third of the whole mongol fleet was lost and an estimated 200 ships 13,500 soldiers and sailors had been lost to the sea ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/mokoshurai.jpg ) . 
  those that survived were [ chased down by the much smaller and more maneuverable japanese boats ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/takezaki_suenaga_ekotoba3.jpg ) . 
  when the japanese boarded the ship the mongol forces were at an extreme disadvantage because many of them were cavalrymen or horse-archers who could not use their weapons effectively in this small space . 
  ** second mongol invasion of japan ( 1281 ) **, 
  by 1280 , kublai khan had conquered most , if not all , of southern china and then the japanese learnt that he would once again turn his attention towards them . 
  he even established a new governmental department known as the ` ministry for conquering japan ' . 
  first off , an army of 40,000 korean , chinese and mongolian soldiers set off to hakata bay in 900 ships . 
  while a second invasion force departed from south-eastern china with 100,000 soldiers in 3,500 ships . 
  the force of 40,000 men landed in hakata bay on june 23 , 1281 . 
  they , yet again , encountered fierce opposition from the japanese . 
  though outnumbered , the japanese kept up a brave struggle for around 50 days . 
  they were particularly effective against the chinese and [ korean soldiers ] ( http://img137.imageshack.us/img137/8008/kamakuraperiod1185ad133.jpg ) as they did not wish to fight and die for their mongol overlords . 
  finally , the second invasion force of 100,000 soldiers landed further west from hakata bay . 
  however , on august 15 , when the outlook was looking grim for the japanese soldiers , the winds appeared yet again , just as they had in 1274 . 
  the winds were so strong that they uprooted trees along the shoreline and raised waves that swamped all but a few hundred of the enemy ships . 
  [ the mongol losses were catastrophic , and the ones that did n't drown were stranded on kyushu with nowhere to run and were eventually chased down by the samurai .
