  despite the fact that typhoons were common at this time of year , many japanese attributed these winds as a miracle . 
  they believed that the gods had intervened on their behalf and therefore the winds were referred to as the * `` kamikaze '' * , which means `` divine wind '' .

  they definitely reached the shores , both times . 
  but yes , storms played a big part as they destroyed many of the ships .

  you should do world war i !, 
  [ unless you 're in japan ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wojpqn5ze10 ) !, 
  best part is , last time it was posted someone found out it is only around $ 500 !, 
  yes definitely , even more so if you enjoy japanese history !, 
  calm down buddy . 
  this is weird . 
  should 've been wearing a yodare-kake . 
  samurai are the best !, 
  could i perhaps receive a link to that ? 
  i regret watching that . 
  thanks anyway though . 
  as beautiful as the story is , i hardly think it qualifies for `` breaking news '' !, 
  is n't he just making his own life , along with other people 's harder ? 
  one of my favourites !, 
  kiichi nakai is one of my favourite actors after watching that . 
  wow that seems pretty difficult . 
  that 's awesome !, 
  thanks for this . 
  how can you be so un-coordinated ? 
  what the fuck, 
  i like the whole yellow turban campaign . 
  me and a friend are planning to do asuebi and iceni/arveni co-op . 
  you 're a saint . 
  man , i remember reading that when my old dog passed . 
  christ it 's been 5 years now . 
  that was amazing . 
  very well done !, 
  [ a bit late , but here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-im7sv2pic ), 
  possibly the worst bot ... why ? 
  reminds me of this ;, 
  * `` the arts of peace and the arts of war are like two wheels of a cart which , lacking one , will have difficulty in standing . 
  we ca n't have a good bot , without a bad one to maintain the balance . 
  i 've started to watch a japanese drama about the life of the samurai , naoe kanetsugu . 
  i 've picked a lot more japanese than i would 've expected, 
  you can up the size of soldiers in each unit in shogun 2 . 
  i 'm not sure about earlier ones . 
  ** edit ** : i 'm not talking about changing the size in setting to `` ultra '' or whatever . 
  you can change one of the scripts ( ? ), 
  to exceed the `` ultra '' limit . 
  i had it set as 1 unit of yari ashigaru = 2000 men . 
  it was glorious . 
  but then of course we have the problem of them surrendering as soon as they see an invading army !, 
  just kidding !, 
  glad you put that last part in , i thought i slept through the beginning of war . 
  the problem with that is , most of the people joining this subreddit will be from / r/gaming . 
  [ for reference ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1hfkp5/64_days_until_our_conquest_begins/ ), 
  my army will be waiting for you in macedon . 
  we will not give in so lightly . 
  hey man , i 'd gladly join your squad . 
  i 'm from australia so the lag might be higher for me . 
  however , i played a couple games and managed to rake in around 151 kills on one of them . 
  i 'm playing as `` sini . '', 
  i 'm in favour of your idea . 
  is serbia available in it ? 
  i ca n't seem to access moddb or twcenter ... 
  oh lord i wish i had napoleon , my glorious serbia !, 
  i think i heard someone say that line of sight will only affect the player . 
  [ citation needed ], 
  i 'm glad that this was disproven . 
  i just seem to have this memory in the back of my head of someone saying it only affected the player . 
  thank you !, 
  christ , i lost it at the flashbacks of him teaching his young son how to walk . 
  i think it is l1 . 
  [ here you go mate , i think you were looking for these !, 
  the sekigahara campaign . 
  after using it i find it damn well near impossible to go back to vanilla , or any other mod for that matter . 
  i recommend it to you a million times over !, 
  my mother still does something similar to this . 
  `` mum , when will dinner be ready ? '', 
  `` when it 's finished . '', 
  i watched the whole thing and it still does n't make any sense . 
  glad i could convert another person !, 
  yes , they are expendable , but their sacrifices shall not be forgotten . 
  i use them to keep the attacking army at bay while the archers or matchlocks above them attack them . 
  maybe they have , i seriously doubt it though . 
  it would be a nice little surprise . 
  or it might be added during the blood dlc pack . 
  hahaha, 
  i 'm sure ca would n't deprive us of the statistics . 
  [ when romanians are alone in a car ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfkjipmqo0a ), 
  do n't know why you were downvoted ... 
  wow , that would be a sort of cool thing to hand down to your kids and grandkids ... 
  crazy how some kids can have such adult features . 
  god dammit i blame the pedestrians is more than half of these incidents . 
  why is no one paying attention . 
  war dogs !, 
  / r/glitch _ in_the_matrix, 
   there is only one recorded moment in history when this was used . 
  if it does n't bother you too much , could i have a source on that ?
