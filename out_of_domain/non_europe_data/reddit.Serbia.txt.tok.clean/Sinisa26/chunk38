  this is one of my favourite tactics . 
  i start off as an imperialist clan , then i migrate everything/everyone to hokkaido and just turtle down up there . 
  you can build an impressive economy up there . 
  awesome . 
  the dynamic missions sound amazing and the fact that your relations with other factions improve if you do what they ask of you is a massive bonus !, 
  really looking forward to rome ii . 
  i think that 's a no-brainer for ca , i would be very disappointed if you could n't !, 
  damn , the way he fell on his `` leg '' made me cringe hard . 
  also , i 'd like to imagine that those guys shooting him were just trying to put him out of his misery , but i just do n't know anymore ... 
  man , it 's pretty chilling when you understand what they 're saying . . 
  1:17 - are you 's alive ? 
  1:20 - let 's go brother , let 's go . 
  1:21 - gtfo, 
  there was some more after that , that most consisted of `` we 're getting the fuck out of here '' and `` it 's alright '' ... 
  this is something i really did n't expect from ca , good work guys . 
  also , that guy that barely flinched at the slinger , so fucking badass . 
  and , historically accurate sandals ftw !, 
  does anyone else reckon that ca should run a mini-series/documentary every time one of their games come out , kinda like this episode ? 
  i grew a woodsman beard just listening to him . 
  i start rebellions in my allies ' provinces ... 
  ... then take the province from the rebels ... 
  ... aaand then he disappeared from the face of the earth . 
  in shogun 2 , i set it so that my yari ashigaru had 4000 men . 
  siege battle were absolute hell . 
  it would take around 15 minutes for them all the fit through that tiny gate ... 
  op , i was really interested in your question so i went ahead and tested this in the battle of sekigahara in shogun 2 for you . 
  historically , the eastern army had 88,888 men . 
  while the western army had 81,890 ( 15,600 of which defected to the eastern army with kobayakawa hideaki ), 
  now , in the battle of sekigahara on shogun 2 ... 
  - kobayakawa hideaki has 1,040 men compared to 15,600 historically . 
  - the eastern army has 3,160 men compared to 88,888 historically . 
  - the western army has 3,080 men compared to 81,890 historically . 
  - ** total : ** 7,280 men compared to 170,778 historically . 
  ** percentages **, 
  - kobayakawa has 6.6667 % of his army present in the video game . 
  - the eastern army have 3.55 % of their army present in the video game . 
  - the western army have 3.76 % of their army present in the video game . 
  ** final verdict **, 
  4.26 % of the men are present in the video game compared to historically . 
  it 's never too silly . 
  i personally ca n't wait until shogun xii in 2095 where i can re-enact sekigahara with full numbers . 
  these naginata samurai magically only lost 10 men . 
  they got around 350 kills but it was my ranged units that did the most damage . 
  some had upwards of 500 kills . 
  you should 've seen the mass rout , it was glorious . 
  [ it would be my pleasure !, 
  also , i retract my previous statement , no one had over 500 kills . 
  does ca take us for fools ? 
  kinda the same with shogun , a whole unit of katana-only armed soldiers is pretty ridiculous . 
  and do n't even get me started on the ninja units . 
  awesome cinematic dude , but can i ask what you use to record your videos ? 
  and what the process is for uploading them ? 
  the only other mod besides sekigahara is a mod for the camera which allows you to zoom really far out , or really far in !, 
  it was more like 100 warriors on the bride , and then like 400 ranged troops behind him , but i like your one better . 
  we should get takashi miike on this . 
  [ like this . 
  they were just positioned on the side of the bridge 's mouth . 
  wow , it is an honour . 
  if sufficient evidence has not been presented to us by the eleventh day of / r/totalwar , you will be sentenced to death by crucifixion . 
  this is sweet , i do n't know which one i like more though ... 
  [ credit to otto von bismarck !, 
  22 seconds to hold off an army of 3,000 . 
  we should get takashi miike to make a movie on this . 
  for your sake , i hope so . 
  night battles stop reinforcing armies from participating in the battle . 
  also , they look sweet . 
  am i missing something here ? 
  dude she 's like eight . 
  playing the ukita clan with the sekigahara campaign . 
  i just turtled down in my home province of bizen and declared war on all tokugawa-supporter factions . 
  i 've held off about 20 or so sieges thus far . 
  but now i am being besieged by 3 full stacks . 
  they have around 8000 men , while i have just under 2000 . 
  this is what happens when you stop giving a shit about your ~ ~ dreads ~ ~ life . 
  damn , i have so much more respect for the work that ca does after seeing everything that went into that helmet . 
  jesus fuck those fire balls . 
  wow , some of the animations are absolutely glorious . 
  and i love the fucking overhead unit view . 
  so cinematic . 
  also , the insults just before they charge at eachother are amazing , i hope the barbarians can pull off a braveheart one . 
  ah , ca , you 've done it again . 
  [ from a while ago !, 
  the best part is , the guy saying the speech , defected from the takeda army before the battle . 
  apologies for the lousy photo , my grandma has n't quite grasped how to use a scanner and this is the best she could send me . 
  i 'm guessing that they did that because the unit they were fighting had just routed . 
  this happens in shogun ii afaik . 
  i assume you mean how far the unit is spread out ? 
  as far as i know , if your unit is spread too thin then cavalry charges can break through with ease . 
  however , in fots/empire/napoleon , it allows more units to shoot at once and makes you take less damage , as there are less people behind eachother . 
  perhaps someone more seasoned in the arts of war can tell you when to use a thick unit . 
  it definitely happened in shogun many times to me . 
  enemy armies would run the whole battlefield and then get absolutely destroyed . 
  though , it seemed to happen mostly with rebel armies . 
  perhaps that was ca 's way of showing an inexperienced army/general ? 
  my math may be wrong , but this comes out to around 136 years . 
  i 'm just gon na guess that this is the playtime of the whole total war : shogun ii community together . 
  i 've contributed around 900 hours to it !, 
  `` the pastor believes if he stares hard enough god will smite kevin '', 
  amazing . 
  wow , what a perfect time to finish school .
