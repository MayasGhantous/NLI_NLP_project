  new agents, 
  and more stuff that i 've forgotten . 
  but it is seriously awesome !, 
  from your post title , i was expecting it to be a roman version of [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=vqwou9g1xpo ) . 
  for anyone wondering , that video is about the first escalator introduced to iraqi kurdistan . 
  what error are you receiving ? 
  yeah the horses were crazy !, 
  off-topic , but , what do you use to record/compress your videos ? 
  they always look so nice . 
  mr. dentist , i have a serious question for you about my teeth . 
  i 'm nearly 18 now and barely ever brushed my teeth since i was a kid . 
  i always try to get into a routine but it always falls out of place after 2-3 days . 
  i know this is appalling and disgusting of me and i want to change it , what can you recommend that will help me keep the routine going . 
  also , is it too late for me to turn these teeth back to normal/perfect health ? 
  ** edit ** : sorry , i missed the part about you working at a supermarket chain . 
  this post probably does n't relate to you at all then , sorry , and good luck !, 
  i was just actually reading my companies equal opportunity policy . 
  i work at kmart so if you work in a similar department store , it may apply for you . 
  it stated the company or store is allowed to outlaw/ban its workers from donning beards/moustaches/headgear at its own discretion . 
  however , if an employer has a religious reason to don this headdress/facial hair ( i.e. 
  turban ) and it presents no hindrance or issues to the work that the employee is assigned to or to the people around them , then they are allowed to don it . 
  ^ ^ all that is written from my memory so take it with a grain of salt , i would recommend reading any similar documents or policies at your workplace . 
  [ they sure do .

  wow , i remember seeing that screen so many times , i must 've spent hours there . 
  yet , i have still completely forgotten what the hell i was meant to do on that screen . 
  are n't the files really huge then ? 
  with fraps ? 
  the stats for the fire arrows and any ability/powerup are shown in a tooltip when you mouse over it . 
  i believe fire arrows do more damage and decrease morale but they fire slower and less accurate . 
  any mods installed ? 
  i 'm fairly sure knossos was a friendly clan towards sparta , so attacking them may have cost some diplomatic points . 
  not sure about athens though . 
  i think op just did that for demonstration purposes , so we could see where to build the hole/contraption . 
  jump out ? 
  i know what the prank/annoyance is meant to cause , i was just poking fun at the 1x1 part which means the hole is only 1 block deep and they can just jump out . 
  no need to be modest , it 's pretty epic !, 
  planning to do anymore in the near future ? 
  hey trish , small text issue i noticed while playing a siege battle . 
  it 's really not that important but i thought it might be useful to add to the agenda for future updates . 
  when fighting a celtic/gallic/germanic confederation , the name is too long to appear in the `` held by : _______ '' part , so instead it cuts down the confederation part to just confede . 
  another minor text issue i found is in barren lands mission where it says `` on of your ... '' instead of `` on ** e ** of your . . '' in the text description . 
  i think i have some crappy iphone picture examples of these , will update post if i find them , and once again , thank you and ca for working around the clock to churn out these patches for us . 
  will do , cheers !, 
  i do n't imagine it was causing problems , just illogical considering there is no one there to see your pings . 
  those fucking horse archer armies , i barely ever have any cavalry units in my army so those guys give me a hard time . 
  good luck hannibal . 
  the ai used siege ladders in a battle with me during patch 3 . 
  not sure if this was normal or an isolated incident ... 
  i was playing as macedon i believe . 
  i was actually playing on the easiest difficulty as i was just fooling around , the ai seiged me and build approximately 8 ladders which they actually used . 
  if you click k before going into unit cam mode , the interface will be completely gone , even the `` press escape to exit '' parts !, 
  hell yeah i did , it was an undefended garrison against 40 units . 
  still got around 2600 kills , boiling oil + 4 mob units + 2 javelin men ended up routing the whole reinforcing army , but the main army were just too strong ... 
  needs more artillery , you can never have too much artillery . 
  remove it and try again . 
  go to your rome ii data folder . 
  program files  steam  steamapps  common  total war rome ii  data, 
  in this folder delete the radious_total_war_mod . pack file . 
  then open the ui folder in the data folder and delete the units folder located withing ( not sure if this step is necessary ... ), 
  no worries , always glad to help ... now get back to pillaging !, 
  you should probably start a new campaign . 
  there is one forty year old woman in the justin beiber gif ... 
  any mods installed ? 
  hmmmm , that is quite peculiar then . 
  i 'd suggest submitting a thread in the [ rome ii support forum ] ( http://forums.totalwar.com/forumdisplay.php/144-total-war-rome-ii-support-forum ) !, 
  good luck , i hope you fix your game !, 
  is there a champion/hero in your army ? 
  is he claiming it as his own ? 
  maybe he was just sharing it in a `` hey guys , look at this awesome artwork i found '' way ... 
  i 've had them use ladders , it was clunky , but then still managed to get about 6-7 units up there . 
  mind you , it 's only happened once out of the 200 + seiges i 've played ... 
  wait wait wait , that stat included the seiges i 've started . 
  so in reality i would say i 've been seiged 70-80 times ... 
  ** edit ** : i have 120 hours . 
  i like to do turtle campaigns where i have like one province , then i just declare war on everyone , i think that 's why i 've been seiged so much . 
  pretty historically innaccurate though ... 
  in the midst of all this hubbub , the filthy barbarians managed to sneak into the fray , check out some of the back row ... 
  yeah , i raided a barbarian fort with my spartan army , my general units ended up getting to 30 % strength with around ~ 900 kills . 
  general was still alive but as we were finishing off the last unit , he got hit by an arrow from an arrow tower ... 
  nikon, 
  is it possible that you have any mods installed ? 
  any at all , no matter how small . 
  check to see if it says # 7573.461942 in the top-right corner of your main menu . 
  you think they did n't come back with ptsd back in the `` good days '' ? 
  i 'm inclined to say it was much more common but less understood . 
  if we missed packie after the first heist , can we still find him ? 
  look at his name man , that guy is an obvious troll ... 
  the dress of the girl at the front looks so modern ... 
  i ca n't believe it 's 1947 ... 
  kurosawa 's [ throne of blood ] ( http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0050613/ ) ( 1957 ) . 
  it 's basically a japanese version of macbeth , i disliked the original macbeth but this movie was absolutely amazing . 
  even more amazing is that [ this scene ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ityt4rvmbfw&amp;sns=em ) ( please ignore the music/speed ) is filmed with actual arrows being fired at him , except for the ones that hit him ... 
  we are of the same age , yet i feel as if i am a 12 year old compared to you ... 
  defendable sounds better to me , but english is not my first language so it might not be correct . 
  zaript , you are a saint ... 
  oh god , catherine is such a bitch , she always gives me that flirty pick up line when we meet ... 
  ten turns later , she denounces me ... another ten , war ... 
  every . 
  damn .
