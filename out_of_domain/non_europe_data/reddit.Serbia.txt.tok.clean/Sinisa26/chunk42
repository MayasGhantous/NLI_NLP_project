  goosebumps every time . 
  fuck that guy , seriously . 
  i 'm hoping the scordisci come along some time , just because singidun is the capital . 
  it kinda looks like he wiped away a teardrop that fell onto the diary between ` gone ' and ` life ' ... 
  `` you ca n't eat me , i 'm herbert mooooon ! '', 
  for some reason , this story reminds me of uesugi kenshin weeping infront of his men when he heard his longtime opponent , takeda shingen , had passed away . 
   although shingen and kenshin were rivals for more than fourteen years , they are known to have exchanged gifts a number of times , most famously when shingen gave away a precious sword , which he valued greatly , to kenshin . 
  when shingen died in 1573 , kenshin was said to have wept aloud at the loss of so worthy an adversary , and dismissed advice from his retainers to use the opportunity to attack as childish . 
  shingen , on his deathbed , commended kenshin as an honourable warrior , and instructed his son to rely upon kenshin . 
  the two sides would become allies in 3 years .

  these guys look like they belong in the next assassin 's creed ... 
  also , is this a true colour ( ? ), 
  photo , or has it been colourised , if the latter , it 's extremely well done . 
  i 'm not sure if he gave the sword for that specific reason , but we do know that kenshin sent supplies ( mostly salt ) to shingen during the hojo blockade , and that the quote is most likely attributed to him . 
  jovanka passed away only a few weeks ago , it 's saddening that their relationship was so rocky towards the end of tito 's life ... 
  i have n't been able to find any information on him or the photographer , sorry about that . 
  however , with the eyes , i think he is wearing glass and the reflection from the sun makes them seen gone/empty ... 
  i feel the same way , when i look at casualties of wwi and see that serbia lost 16.11 % of the whole population , i wonder how many of them were my ancestors ...

  i always loved how well the [ tollund man 's head ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/tollundmannen.jpg ) was preserved !, 
  because it also costs ca money to develop the blood pack and to put it out on the market . 
  if they put it out for 10c they would probably be working at a loss . 
  yes and no . 
  they do want to make money , every company does . 
  but 10c is way too low to recoup the cost of creating and distributing it . 
  i still personally think $ 3 is a bit too high , but i do n't really mind ... 
  the text says `` beard and moustache club '' while the logo says `` moustache and beard club '' ... 
  it 's driving me insane !,

  wow that third picture is crazy ... 
  what is this from ? 
  i 've frequently seen it posted ... 
  i was exploring the northern reaches of tamriel because i was bored . 
  i came across a massive battle between 20 ~ imperials , 20 ~ stormcloaks , 1 horker , 1 ice wolf and 1 snow bear ( whatever they 're called ) ... 
  it was absolutely amazing , this all took place on the side of a large hill so when they died they all slid down into a mass grave . 
  even though i supported imperials , i could n't resist blasting them all down the hill with my shout . 
  i 'm not sure if it is a mod that made this happen ... 
  really , why ? 
  for not having seen what i guess is a pretty popular movie around these parts ? 
  wow , props to bethesda then , it 's tiny details like this that make adventuring and getting lost in the wilderness of tamriel so fun . 
  lydia is stronger than me , i let her be the tank in our team . 
  i just sit back peddling them with arrows . 
  how did you manage that ? 
  wow , that 's completely opposite from what i thought it was . 
  i thought it meant to ridicule or something along those lines . 
  man , i should 've moved into lakeview manor instead of heljarchen hall . 
  damn shady real estate agents . 
  they told me i 'd have a view of high hrothgar and dragonsreach but the weather is so bad i ca n't see out of my windows most of the time . 
  i 'm so glad to see those guys receiving the recognition they deserve !, 
  can you have more than one house ? 
  if so , i believe it 's time for me to buy a couple of holiday houses , i have too much money anyway ... 
  alright sweet , thanks !,

  the way i see it , is as soon as the general joins the battle , everybody on the other team wants to kill him specifically for glory or whatever . 
  makes me rage a bit less when i see it through that perspective . 
  however , yeah , your anecdote does seem pretty unlikely . 
  i 'd definitely recommend shimazu or chosokabe first . 
  see if you can get the clan dlcs as most of them offer quite a unique clan . 
  otomo are christian japanese so it 's like a whole different playthrough . 
  holy fuck that was brutal , one slice . 
  hope it was quick for him . 
  this might sound stupid to some people , but , can we not just put the fire out ? 
  is it too dangerous to do so , or has it not been out out yet because it is some sort of a ~ ~ monument ~ ~ landmark ... 
  i was doing it all in a book and it was really inefficient . 
  i hope someone finds one before i start lakeview ... 
  you 'll have a hard time management wise because of unhappiness , but you will steamroll through any enemy navy with your nanban trade ships . 
  tes vi : thalmor invasion confirmed, 
  i actually liked hearthfire the most ... 
  yes , and the nanban trade ships are better/stronger than most military ships . 
  i always had fond memories of the yellow turban rebellion in dw3 .

  yep ... balkans ... 
  exactly , their limbs are n't really made for swimming , it 'd take a lot of effort to keep themselves floating . 
  they were probably tired as fuck i 'd imagine . 
  just collapsed as soon as they reached dry land , until that final adrenaline rush kicked in . 
  their limbs are n't made for swimming and it would 've taken them a lot of effort to stay floating . 
  we also do n't know how long he was swimming for . 
  does n't really make sense when you have half the known world under your command while they are some backwater nation barely able to field an army . 
  try -1 for the value . 
  i dont think there are many kids starving in japan ... 
  especially around the buddha in the op .
