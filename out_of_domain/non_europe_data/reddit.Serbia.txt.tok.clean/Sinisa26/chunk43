  no worries , i was struggling with the same problem . 
  i think in his ama , the creator said he was planning on japanese in the near future . 
  if so , i ca n't wait !, 
  motherfucking promaja , bane of all serbs . 
  * the lord could have sex with every new bride , right ? 
  wrong . 
  if this ever occurred at all , it was incredibly rare and as shocking then as it would be now . 
  no worries , i understand where you are coming from now with that revelation . 
  i agree with you on the belief that buddha would be displeased about statues being built while your own people are being neglected and dying . 
  [ it 's a lower-case ` e ' . 
  for some reason it reminded me of this, 
  eh , i was just fooling around , i was n't actually suggesting this was the case , however , you 're correct in saying i 'm new to bethesda games ... 
  what 's there to explain ? 
  it 's just a demon ... 
  do n't be afraid , you have the high ground , kick it in the face . 
  mine was beautiful until i looked at her side profile , god damn hour of my life gone ... 
  i 'm sure op did n't join the stormcloaks , i 'm willing to bet he is wearing the armour of his deceased enemies to intimidate others kinda like [ this guy . 
  ] ( http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2012/05/unbelievable-assassin-bug-wears-its-victims-corpses-as-armour/ ), 
  i mean , what person in their right state of mind would join the stormcloaks ? 
  needs more wilhelm scream for my tastes ... 
  he had so much sex that night, 
  are there any serbian passages in the diary ? 
  i could translate them for you if you need . 
  needs to be a line about serbia blocking three of austria-hungary 's punches and only backing down when germany , austria-hungary and bulgaria punch serbia at the same time . 
  talk to dinya balu in riften 's temple of mara i think . 
  man , when he does the shout then the music kicks in , 2 years later and i 'm still getting goosebumps ... 
  smog, 
  do n't know why you were getting downvoted , what you said was correct ... 
  [ god damn it gimli !,

  i do n't because the water does n't drain properly from the corners/sides of the shower floor and there will just be stagnating pools of piss at the sides unless i clean it up personally . 
  my dad does and every time i walk in for a shower the smell hits me like a ton of bricks . 
  i think they were n't as afraid to die back then because of their strong belief in the afterlife . 
  must be like a one in a billiard chance to come across that . 
  not hard for me , my dad just does n't seem to give a fuck though ... 
  you 're right , i used to do it my old shower which drained properly . 
  i 'm so jealous of you guys being able to trace your lineage so far back . 
  the earliest i 've managed to trace mine was the ~ 1890s ... 
  i do as well actually , except i also use my typing fingers for the spacebar . 
  i 'm usually up around the 60-70 wpm range . 
  it 's just your perception , he actually has a really small foot and the photo is not photoshopped at all . 
  you comment on the shoes but not the massive thigh-spanning tattoo ? 
  gosh , these guys are so creative ... 
  calm down pelagius the mad . 
  does alduin eat their souls when he kills them , or does he only eat their souls when he finds them in that misty place in sovngarde ? 
  plus , i do n't think the horse thief was going to sovngarde anyway , being a thief and all ... 
  wow , that was pretty amazing and engaging . 
  however , there are some issues with the pacing of the story i think . 
  keep at it and hopefully bethesda hires you :p, 
  ca n't wait for part ii !, 
  this is absolutely amazing , i 'm thinking of x-posting it to / r/imaginaryhistory ... 
  ** edit ** : nevermind , someone is already way ahead of me . 
  jesus can walk on water , but this person can swim through land . 
  cs : s - 1800hrs, 
  total war : shogun 2 - 841hrs, 
  i regret nothing . 
  you 're correct , the emblem on her armour belongs to a clan that was basically destroyed at the end of the 12th century . 
  although it does n't seem like it , the `` girl '' in the op could actually be a male actor portraying a female , which was common in kabuki . 
  i assume you got mixed up , genpei war was during 12th century , not 17th . 
  pretty much , it 's entirely possible that the person in the op is a male actor portraying a female . 
  my god , he reminds me of my great-uncle ... 
  exact same glasses , bald and exact same ` stache shape except the colour , his was white . 
  it 's the moustache, 
  that was fucking great , that ending ... 
  i found this armour on a draugr in solstheim as well . 
  are you in solstheim right now op ? 
  i love how you can hear the scream trailing off in the slow-mo ... 
  never make your alarm a song you like . 
  i learnt the hard way ... 
  [ ahem ... ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1k0gvl/the_coolest_video_ive_seen_filmed_with_a_gopro/ ), 
  wow , you are an awesome person , however , what does a red and white cane mean ? 
  samir , you are breaking the car, 
  something that reminds me of home , probably some [ \u0107evapi ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/cevapi_in_travnik.jpg ) . 
  ah , i thought so , thanks !, 
  pssssst , ui stands for ` user interface ' which is the stuff the user interacts with , you 're looking for ai !, 
  just get it at the next sale man , you do n't need to play it , but at least it 's there . 
  nope haha , i assumed this was an american thing , i 'm australian . 
  good on you for actually providing constructive criticism !, 
  that was absolutely beautiful , not just the song but the video as well . 
  favourited , thanks !, 
  i stumbled upon [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxgfbgww2lg ) a while ago and just fell in love . 
  i do n't even know what language it 's in , i think romanian ... 
  keep in mind serbia was ruled by the ottomans for some ~ 600 years . 
  it 's fair to assume that there would be some turkish influences . 
  this guy has one too many swimsuits, 
  i also had a kinda similar dream , in my dream it would be the middle of the day and i would be sitting with my family watching tv or whatever , and this same guy would always come and take me , and my family never reacted to it in my dream . 
  it started out with him outside the window , or following me to school and eventually progressed into him kidnapping me infront of my own family who did n't react at all . 
  however , i stopped having these `` nightmares '' after one dream where he did n't kidnap me but saved me from some monsters , i think they were werewolves . 
  me and him were totally cool after that , i kinda miss him now . 
  cool to see my submission x-posted , cheers !, 
  all the different scenarios you could make in free mode by choosing different characters . 
  [ this is my favourite .

  also , i just realised how hilarious the voice acting in dw3 was . 
  oh god , i completely forgot about the openings . 
  that is really beautiful op , probably my favourite . 
  to really conceptualise point 15 , john tyler was born in 1790 . 
  ah god , i love the awkward as fuck run that sabre units do . 
   john tyler was born in 1790 . 
  he became the 10th president of the united states in 1841 after william henry harrison died in office .
