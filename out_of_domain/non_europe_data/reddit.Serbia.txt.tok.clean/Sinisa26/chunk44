  tyler fathered lyon gardiner tyler in 1853 , at age 63 . 
  then , at the age of 71 , lyon gardiner tyler fathered lyon gardiner tyler jr. in 1924 and four years later at age 75 , harrison ruffin tyler . 
  both men are still alive today . 
  so basically john tyler and his son fathered children extremely late in life . 
  you can exploit the tax system in shogun 2 ( not sure about others ) , by settings your taxes to max one round , and then the next round put it down to levels where the populace is happy . 
  i use this to earn a couple thousand koku per turn since a province needs to be unhappy two turns in a row to rebel . 
  alright , i 've read their response about ten times , i can not for the life of me find the fourth one . 
  please help , it 's driving me crazy . 
  - artillery is king . 
  - spread your rifle units as far as possible to maximise the usefulness of the unit ( especially important early game because your units wo n't have kneel fire ), 
  - research kneel fire, 
  - ally with a couple of the imperial/shogunate ( depending upon which side you 're on ) factions and bring them into your wars , unless you think you can handle it . 
  - playing as tosa , get some tosa riflemen , they are amazing . 
  i 'm sure there 's a plethora of other things i have n't covered . 
  good luck !, 
  [ plus , shogun 2 had extremely detailed faces ... ca n't say the same for cannonballs though ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/w0qttqu.jpg ), 
  i think this is most likely correct . 
  that 's incredible , should x-post to / r/cableporn . 
  2 upvotes and gold , i think that 's a record . 
  [ higher res ] ( http://25.media.tumblr.com/547435ffba4af3f2af665ea9c3065bc6/tumblr_mrg6vioyxm1sulipco2_1280.jpg ), 
  yes , get sekigahara campaign , it has more content than the gaul expansion ca is about to release . 
  also , there is a good mod for fots which adds around 40 unique units . 
  oh god that was great , had me in tears , thanks for that !, 
  it 's just so sad , they spend so much time together yet they barely know what matsumoto likes/dislikes . 
  that was the mongols , but there were quite a few chinese there as well , and koreans . 
  should n't it be iiii instead of iv ? 
  i know that roman numerals have 4 as iv , but on clocks most of the time it is iiii . 
  awesome build though !, 
  wow , i loved that , also awesome to see that he used [ my picture . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1lmriz/these_samnites_are_mighty_ugly/ ), 
  well hideyoshi planned to take over china after finishing up in korea in the late 1500 's , but that never came to fruition . 
  this guy 's whole account is literally just photoshopping negros into space wallpapers ... 
  ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ amazing ... 
  i feel as if it adds to the comedic effect . 
  [ extremely relevant : first escalator in yemen ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=vqwou9g1xpo ), 
  i 'm fairly certain the title is incorrect , i do n't think the escalator is in yemen at all , but this was that title of the reddit post i took it from , and i ca n't read the arabic script on the youtube video . 
  none , because my faith was never lost . 
  i want to create my serbian empire under either stefan uro\u0161 iv or king peter i of serbia . 
  [ more from the same shoot ] ( http://imgur.com/a/3oh6a ), 
  dynasty warriors is in ancient china , samurai warriors is in feudal japan . 
  hey , i asked this question a while ago ( jesus , it 's been a year already ) , and got some interesting answers . 
  [ here you go !, 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/ydjpe/if_i_send_money_to_an_ally_will_he_actually_use/ ), 
  also , / u/pi-roh is exactly right , this is what the subreddit is for , i 'd like to see more people helping eachother out instead of downvoting and whining about the state of rome ii ... 
  i hope your ally crushes the satomi bastards , i have my own personal vengeance against them . 
  are you using darthmod ? 
  if so , here ( http://www.twcenter.net/forums/showthread.php?565439-gt-gt-gt-audio-fix - ( you-need-it-for-the-steam-work-version-4-4-and-above ) - lt-lt-lt - ( updated-4-12-2012 ) ) . 
  i think it 's a bastardisation of the surname bijeli\u0107 . 
  does n't she meet her at the waterfront , when kenny tries finding a boat ? 
  i think ben 's definitely dead , just before kenny 's last bullet is fired you hear ben saying something like `` no ... kenny ... pleeeaa - '' and then he cuts off as the pistol is fired . 
  and i agree with you on the kenny part , he will have quite a story to tell about how he happens to be in the exact same place as clem ... 
  oh yeah , i forgot you even had the option for that ... 
  as much as i hated him and as much as he fucked up , i could n't drop him down ... 
  i do n't believe so , i just replayed it . 
  wait , do you mean [ this guy ] ( http://static4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20131204212361/walkingdead/images/7/70/and_glenn_leaving.png ) ? 
  if so , i do n't think that 's him in your picture . 
  i 'm fairly certain it does apply to the first season as well . 
  any point op picks to start from will have every decision before it randomly chosen . 
  also you if you do hide next to the body you get an achievement `` reunited with an old friend '' which has carley 's / doug 's face on it . 
  well yeah , i mean , they 've got spears and the general has swords . 
  no fucking way, 
  was hoping i would find this here !, 
  i 'm a bit late , but my japanese friend says that the kanji indicates that the helmet belonged to a young soldier . 
  really ? 
  this is like the first or second one i 've seen since i 've been here . 
  happens to me occasionally , fixes itself after i restart . 
  salmon and avo is my favourite !, 
  for some reason , i think it 'd be pretty cool for someone in a thousand years time to find my body buried 40,000 ft underground ... 
  god yes , when i first saw this portrait i was just like `` wow , that 's actually nobunaga '' and was in disbelief for a while . 
  i wonder why people did n't do portraits like that more often ? 
  damn that 's done well , looks amazing man !, 
  are cooked bones really that bad ? 
  our dogs always eat out leftover chicken bones ... 
  wow , i had no idea , we 'll get her checked up shortly . 
  thank you for the info !, 
  on the verge of tears . 
  i highly doubt it , if lee comes back it would just be bad story writing in my opinion , the ending was so great for season 1 . 
  also , i shot him in the head . 
  so i do n't think he 's coming back . 
  if this guy joins the group he looks like he 's going to be a world of problems just like ben was . 
  that 's how i feel whenever i go to the comments section of a serbian song . 
  i love how all the russians are so casual about it in the second video , `` just another day in the office ... '', 
  from the crvena zvezda bedspread to the kebab seeds , this is the perfect comic . 
  this map just completely blows me away , i can hardly believe that vikings ever stepped foot/raided freaking africa ... 
  glad to see you join the ranks , i remember your little historical posts on shogun 2/fots and was hoping you 'd become a mod . 
  hope to see more of those soon !, 
  the only time i used silence was when [ ] ( / s `` kenny was trying to shoot duck '' ) , i just did n't know what to say so silence felt like the best option . 
  good to see this happening , it 'll probably rekindle my love for shogun 2 and hopefully i 'll contribute a couple more awesome screenshots to this sub as i did a year ago . 
  i could tell haha , ukita ftw !, 
  yeah , someone else told me that as well . 
  i thought that might be the issue except in an older game i controlled the whole continent ( every damn tile ) and my workers still did it . 
   but we are n't going to remember the escapades of michael and franklin in 10 years . 
  i barely remember half the missions now ... 
  oh fuck that 's beautiful ... keep up the good work !, 
  what mod is that that 's redrawn the borders on the campaign map ? 
  i do n't remember it looking like that . 
  ** edit : ** is it extended japan mod ? 
  add to that / r/colorizedhistory, 
  10k units !?!?!? 
  or do you mean men ?
