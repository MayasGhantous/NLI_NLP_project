  because 10k units is like 1.2 million men is n't it ? 
  whooo !, 
  my picture made it into angryjoe 's review of rtwii and this video at the 9:58 mark !, 
  the op of this post is working on a mod ( i think it is ) that basically makes the game fucking beautiful . 
  i 'm so anxiously awaiting it 's release so i can kick some tokugawa ass with the ukita . 
  what kind of damned computer are you running , that 's nearing 30,000 men !, 
  this kid has quite a heartbreaking yet amazing story . 
  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/mom%c4%8dilo_gavri%c4%87_ ( military ), 
  op : do you mind if i x-post this to / r/historyporn ? 
  yep , gavri\u0107 fought for the serbian army , was wounded in battle , survived the harsh retreat to corfu and was promoted to lance sargeant by the end of it . 
  he also lived to age 86 . 
  quite the amazing story . 
   in the beginning of august 1914 , austro-hungarian soldiers killed his father , mother , grandmother , [ 2 ] his three sisters , and four of his brothers . 
  [ 3 ] [ 5 ] his house was also set on fire . 
  mom\u010dilo survived because he was not at home when it happened - his father had sent him to his uncle earlier . 
  left without family and without a home , mom\u010dilo went to find the 6th artillery division of the serbian army , which was near gu\u010devo at the time . 
  [ 4 ] major stevan tucovi\u0107 , brother of dimitrije tucovi\u0107 , accepted gavri\u0107 into his unit after hearing about what had happened , and assigned milo\u0161 mi\u0161ovi\u0107 , a soldier in the unit , to be gavri\u0107 's caretaker . 
  [ 3 ] [ 4 ] the same evening , he took revenge by showing his unit the location of the austro-hungarian soldiers , and participated in the bombardment , as told by his son branislav gavri\u0107 in an interview . 
  at the age of 10 , he was promoted to the rank of kaplar ( corporal ) by the commander of his unit . 
  when his unit was sent to thessaloniki , major tucovi\u0107 sent him to sorovits where he hastily went through the equivalent of four grades of elementary education . 
  in kajmak\u010dalan , vojvoda mi\u0161i\u0107 was stunned when he saw a uniformed eleven year-old boy in the trenches . 
  major tucovi\u0107 explained the situation to him ; that gavri\u0107 had been with them since the battle of cer , and that he had both been taught discipline and been wounded during his time in the unit . 
  [ 2 ] mi\u0161i\u0107 promoted gavri\u0107 to podnarednik ( lance sergeant ) . 
  [ 2 ] [ 4 ] the order was sent out to all units of the serbian army . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mom%c4%8dilo_gavri%c4%87_ ( military ), 
  i would n't really say we got rolled at the battle of kosovo , the ottomans took nearly as much damage as we did and they outnumbered us greatly ( ottomans 27.000-40 .000 vs serbia 12.000-30 .000 ) , the only reason this battle signals the start of the serbia under ottoman rule is because serbia 's whole standing army was present at that battle , while only a small portion of the whole ottoman force was present , thus we had no manpower to resist any further conquests from them and accepted their rule . 
  i 'll test it later tonight , it 's assume it 's compatible with sekigahara campaign , seeing as you were using it before ? 
  it 's working fine for me , except for the fact that my steam overlay is inaccessible . 
  neither , the sekigahara campaign is where it 's at :p, 
  but if i had to pick out of those two , i prefer radious because darthmod messes up my archers ...

  the [ date ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/take_ni_suzume.svg ) clan also has two birds in the mon. 
  i have n't actually played the game , i just searched up the mons of clans i knew . 
  it 's the uesugi clan . 
  i 'm fairly certain you will find the source in [ here ] ( https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0b4agq4wq411xdfn3rvphvhnxzhc&amp;usp=sharing ), 
  what store is this ? 
  why is everything so disorganised ?

  bosnia is in this game ? 
  can you be serbia ? 
  op i fapped to you grandmother and i 'm proud, 
  damn , that 's a great shot , in the 100 + hours i played rome ii when it first came out , i do n't think i 've seen that animation before ... 
  another remarkable woman of the great war is [ milunka savic ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/milunka_savi%c4%87 ) i reckon . 
  is this a new movie being released ? 
  sorry if this is a stupid question , but did slave traders have their own privatised armies in order to stop their newly-acquired slaves from fleeing or rebelling ? 
  also , where did these slaves go when no one bought them ( i assume they were n't all bought instantly ) ? 
  sure , i 'll be back home in an hour or so . 
  sure , i 'll be back home in an hour or so . 
  someone added me about 4-5 hours ago looking for the -75 % off portal ii coupon . 
  i was under the impression that it was you , if it was n't you , add my [ account ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/id/sinisasimic ) and i can give you a -50 % off portal ii coupon + another of your choice for your troubles , 
  i 'm not that fussed with the data , it had maybe a couple documents for school , but this was 2 years ago and i 've since graduated . 
  hungary - fur coat ? 
  christ , they look list skyrim giants . 
  next step for the mod is to send the plebs flying . 
  damn , these combat animations are one thing ca definitely did right . 
  ummm , i 'm pretty sure he said `` few '' not `` two '' . 
  there was a war in croatia a few years ago , so he is n't lying about that part . 
   horrible countries , horrible people, 
  really dude , not cool . 
  that 's a pretty big generalisation . 
  `` where will you be when the acid kicks in ? '', 
  these might interest you ;, 
   kre\u0107e se la\u0111a francuska is a serbian war song from the first world war , first sung in a salonika harbor , where the serbian army was recuperating after a long and painful withdrawal through the albanian mountains . 
  the author of the original text of the poem is serbian officer colonel branislav milosavljevi\u0107 . 
  the song was frequently performed in both france and serbia after the war and is commonly used as a symbol of serbian and french friendship . 
  i could link you to some serbian music/speeches , however i am not sure who you would have to contact in order to obtain the rights of some of these .

  i hope your exhibition is a great success !, 
  i 'm glad to help , please update us on how your exhibition goes !, 
  wow , kilithaza , this is the first post of yours i 've seen on the / r/totalwar subreddit for at least 6 months !, 
  are you finally going to come back ? 
  i never even thought of this , it would be the biggest plot twist for me , when i think of carver i think of some scary middle aged man not a recovering cancer patient . 
  i really am psyched for this episode now . 
  i think it says coexist , bit hard to tell though . 
  how do you get these defeat scenes , every time i obliterate a civ they just `` leave '' the game i guess , never gives me any of these scenes . 
  is n't this like 2 months ago ? 
  regardless , this is a testament to van dyck 's ability as a composer . 
  ah , i did n't know it was actually performed for sochi , i just saw that the video that trish linked was uploaded roughly 2 months ago . 
  do you know what position they got with their routine ? 
  which war ? 
  is n't brighton in england ? 
  [ higher quality , ripped from their fb page !, 
   when i learned about wwi in high school , they were never mentioned beyond that they started it . 
  that 's a shame because serbia gave the allies the first victory of the war at the [ battle of cer ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_cer ) where they beat a numerically and technologically superior opponent . 
  in the [ battle of kolubara ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_kolubara ) serbia once again defeated a much more numerically superior opponent . 
  even german emperor wilhelm ii congratulated radomir putnik on the victory .
