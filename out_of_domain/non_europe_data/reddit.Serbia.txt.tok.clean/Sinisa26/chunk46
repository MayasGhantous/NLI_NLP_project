  then the germans joined the fight against serbia , [ then the bulgarians attacked us from behind . 
  ] ( http://www.balkanantiques.com/items/dde76bec_s_anti_bul___greece__.jpg ) we had no choice but to retreat . 
  king , peasant and soldier alike all [ retreated ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/serbian_army's_retreat_through_albania ) alongside one another through the harsh conditions of the albanian mountains towards greece . 
  approximately 200,000 serbs dies during this retreat . 
  on the island of corfu in greece , serbia received aid in forms of all kinds from differing allied nations . 
  once our troops were recuperated , then came the [ salonika front ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/salonika_front ) . 
  which ended with the liberation of belgrade and the capitulation of bulgaria . 
  serbia lost around 25 % of it 's whole population and roughly 60 % of its male population during this time . 
  i 'm hardly a historian so i would encourage you to do your own reading on this topic , 
  to add onto this , what other mods do you use ? 
  4 months later , i think i might start a new campaign ... 
  ok , you 've told us what you think , now tell us why you think that . 
  why do you think the marsh house theory is dumb ? 
  why do you think he will show up in episode 3 ? 
  why do you think we will find christa in episode 4 ? 
  jel \u0107emo da x-post do / r/history ? 
  we fought once , and our king stefan uro\u0161 ii milutin won , but then we accepted their rule . 
  is it [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/a/7vfsg#0 ) one ? 
  it 's obama vs romney though . 
  [ add this one to your arsenal ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lo1qwwg.jpg ), 
  they did technically fight eachother , you 're correct in assuming that the kamikaze wiped out the bulk of army though , twice . 
  unfortunately , samurai were n't fighting alongside crusaders against mongols , now that would be a kickass film . 
  i think you 've mixed up the ottoman empire with woolly mammoths . 
  probably , i 'm not very good at this . 
  i see , thanks , this is the first time i 've seen this question asked so i did n't really understand . 
  this is the most beautiful thing i 've ever seen come from this game . 
  not whatsoever .

  sorry , i 'm not well versed in military terms , what does `` get small '' mean ? 
  you should keep posting , you 're stuff is regular quality cotent !, 
  this is ridiculous , is it that strong just because they are naked ? 
  i mean it 's like 5 times more effective than regular ballista . 
  i wonder how it cares against heavily armoured units . 
  ca n't say i 'm a fan of this dlc . 
  ah , i viewed it on phone so i must 've missed the description . 
  thanks !, 
  oh no , i agree with you that peace is better than violence . 
  however , i 'd rather die fighting instead of get killed just because i 'm holding a picket sign . 
  sometimes , however bad it may be , violence is necessary . 
  ai n't called the tiananmen square massacre for nothing . 
  death ( s ) : 241 -- 2,600, 
  go to hu lao gate and attack dong zhou . 
  [ qin unit pack ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=229501730 ), 
  [ english knights 1 ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=226016616&amp;searchtext=knights ), 
  [ english knights 2 ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=226016444&amp;searchtext=knights ), 
  the knights seem to have some strange bobble head thing going on , no idea why that is . 
  i initially thought the qin units were overpowered , but a fully upgraded unit of qin swordsmen were getting destroyed by the english knights who had no upgrade at all . 
  everything changed when the indian elephants attacked . 
  thank you modders , i hope to see much more outlandish unit packs like this in the near future . 
  also , i need blood and gore pack bad !, 
  edit : [ i 'm back !, 
  [ red cliff has one of my favourite battle scenes !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4qbqcj9qks ), 
  to anyone who plans on watching/renting this movie soon , do yourself a favour and get the extended version . 
  it is like an hour longer . 
   the battles are stunning . 
  some parts are over the top though , i mean , zhang fei was honestly punching spears apart at one point . 
  still amazing . 
  i 've played all of them from dw2 onwards , but nothing compared to dw3 , it was phenomenal . 
  so many hours on that game . 
  nah , one guy has a beard . 
  [ i know that feel brother , especially in shogun 2 . 
  as far as i 'm aware there are no mods for this , hopefully someone else can chip in . 
  i did n't even think about setting it as my wallpaper , thanks for the idea , it looks amazing . 
  i hope you 're ok with us using these , op !, 
  awesome artwork . 
  the clans available are tosa , satsuma , choshu , tsu , saga , sendai , aizu , jozai , obama and nagaoka . 
  are you perhaps using the all factions playable mod ? 
  [ aaaah , animated prostitution ... we meet again . 
  only the first rank fires i believe ( until you research kneel fire which is a must ) , so it is best to spread them out as much as you can . 
  i 'm pretty sure the only weakness is the one you 've already listed , cavalry . 
  also , you can never have too much artillery . 
  it 's always good to have some ships nearby who can bombard your enemy . 
  i 'm sure there 's a lot of other stuff that i 've forgotten , it 's been nearly half a year since i 've played . 
  i 'll usually have about 4 artillery , 3-4 special units ( sharpshooters/tosa riflemen ) , 6-8 line infantry ( or imperial/shogunate/republican infantry ) , a general and 3-4 melee/cavalry . 
  seems to work pretty good for me , try set up a defensive position on a hill , that way you can place units behind eachother and they will still fire . 
  ya 'll motherfuckers need some [ dra\u017ea ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nayjwudbbf8/tyh-jsbf72i/aaaaaaaaezk/z9osgm3-lko/s1600/draza_mihailovic.jpg ) up in this thread . 
  look at that glorious beard . 
  what do you hate about shogun 2 ? 
  in my opinion it 's one of the most solid entries into the series . 
  it 's my father 's name as well , full name is dragoslav . 
  kinda , but to me personally darling sounds way too effeminate .

  also here 's a fun video showcasing [ all of red star 's goals ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofr4pe-3vbc ), 
  fucking beautiful op , i hope to see more content like this in the sub !, 
  i ca n't thank you enough for this , i 'll show my mother in the morning !, 
  big thanks to everyone else who had an attempt !, 
  but it says you can purchase these items as a gift , which obviously ca n't . 
  i assume i have to buy them all individually now ? 
  ok , thank you very much . 
  i guess i 'll have to buy them individually . 
  kind of reminds me of the [ skull tower ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/skull_tower ) in serbia .
