  what was the issue with serbia if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  thank you , that 's quite interesting that yugoslavia would still be present all these years later . 
  [ the most insane fight i ever seen !, 
  [ he 's french ] ( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%89tienne_de_villaret ) , however that does n't change the fact it 's a kickass moustache . 
  it 's been confirmed on australian news services that there were only 6 australians on-board the flight . 
  this rescue is known as [ operation halyard ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_halyard ) .

  hello , i think i played with you once , i believe we have a mutual friend by the name of `` jula gilard '' !, 
   ( mainly because the australian communities have pretty much died ) . 
  have you ever tried freedom gamers ? 
  i have 2050hrs on css .

  [ in australia we have these plates . 
  ] ( http://foundation.vodafone.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/l-plate.gif ), 
  but it does n't seem like anyone gives a shit whether you 're learner or open . 
  man , jeff van dyck was really something special . 
  the fact that it 's in spanish makes it 100x better . 
  [ hah , something similar happened to me in shogun ii ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1h1m18/i_know_its_probably_just_a_coincidence_with_the/ ), 
  so full of optimism for rome ii ... 
  his mum could 've given birth to him while she was younger than 20 for all we know . 
  yeah , take that croatia and bosnia . 
  uesugi in shogun ii by far . 
  has a hard starting position and i 've always loved the uesugi ever since i read about kenshin/kagekatsu/kanetsugu . 
  fuck i love this post, 
  [ srbosjek ] ( http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/srbosjek ), 
   we saved many allied pilots though !, 
  [ operation halyard ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_halyard ) , if anyone wants to read more about it . 
  here 's something we all can agree on . 
   so brutal that the nazis had to tell them to calm down . 
  yep , they literally had a [ knife ] ( http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/srbosjek ) specifically for killing serbs . 
  imagine having to pay $ 320k for torrenting music . 
  if only momcilo gavric had lived on to 110 , he would 've been alive today .

  man , as a little kid i used to idle in traverse town just to listen to [ the soundtrack .

  ca n't believe how long it 's been already ... 
  asshole bird chased me all the way from the bus stop to my house , now it 's waiting for me, 
  kongo gumi was established in 578ad . 
  i 'm not sure what this sign mean , but my country serbia has lots of similarities with russia , and natalia is definitely a completely different name from natasha . 
  i 'd imagine it 's the same with russia . 
  [ i know what you mean ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk5y57ee3ai ) , plovers used to run our local playground . 
  kh was full of the most amazing music , every place had a special , unique soundtrack that i still remember to this day . 
  [ i do n't regret a minute of it ] ( http://i.imgur.com/377irry.png ) . 
  [ it 's not total war , but ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/w5nrx1c.png ),

  how to flush ? 
  crap ... my bad, 
  [ the power of ten ten ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzjqucrni9w ), 
  i 'd recommend starting out with radious/darthmod , whichever tickles your fancy . 
  and then give sekigahara campaign a go , it 's all i play now . 
  i 've really been enjoying watching this mod grow , it seems like this has more content than the base game . 
  it might get me addicted again . 
  congratulations on all your work guys , and godspeed !, 
  wtf is wrong with your friends, 
  [ here 's a nice video of it ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zjhyvvudqq ) .

   i think humans are hardwired for it . 
  chomsky would agree with you . 
  that 's pretty damn amazing . 
   our artillery is led by hand of god !!!, 
  it just blows my mind that there were still cuirassiers around less than 100 years ago . 
  a year ago i submitted a post here , a story . 
  it was probably the cringiest story i 've ever written , but it holds a special place in my heart as being the hardest battle i 've ever fought , and against all odds , came out victorious at a heavy price . 
  it 's a shame i had a crap computer back then , so the graphics are pretty bad . 
  [ here you go , ] ( http://greatwar.nl/kleur/cuirassiers.jpg ) , it 's not the same picture , but it 's still a cuirassier . 
  i 'm well aware of that , it 's just such an anachronism , no matter how many times i look at pictures of them , it still just blows me away . 
   ( unfortunately , due to the horrible tom cruise movie ), 
  [ / u/asiaexpert sums up the inaccuracies quite well ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/12zp30/what_work_has_done_the_most_damage_to_your_field/c6zmm1p ) , just incase anyone was wondering .

  serbia ? 
  may 31st ... 2015, 
  i do not think the samurai in the photos are the same people . 
  i love beato 's work in japan . 
  [ here 's another version ] ( http://images-01.delcampe-static.net/img_large/auction/000/198/838/782_001.jpg ) with greece watching from the sideline . 
  i lost a decent bet , but i ai n't even mad . 
  glad i got to witness this amazing match live . 
  i 'm pretty new to the professional scene so this is the best game i 've ever seen . 
  you would perhaps love [ this ] ( http://lightbox.time.com/2013/07/03/faces-of-the-american-revolution/#1 ) then !, 
  glorious serbian tactics . 
  those are the best battles , where you just look at what you 've done after the dust has settled and go `` holy shit ... '', 
  looks like darthmod to me . 
  one of the submods changes the portraits i believe . 
  op , i hope you gave him a glorious death . 
   there 's a mod in development that 's adding korea soon too ... 
  for real ? 
  can i get a link to it ? 
  amazing , i remember there was talk about adding korea but everyone was so negative , saying it could n't be done . 
  this is great news , hopefully it rekindles my love for shogun ii . 
  i wonder if the makers of sekigahara campaign will update their mod to accommodate korea !, 
  thank you !,
