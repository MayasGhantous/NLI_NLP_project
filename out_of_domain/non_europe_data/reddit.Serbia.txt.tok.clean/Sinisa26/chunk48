  i really wonder how that would 've went down in actuality . 
  `` uhhh . . well guys , looks like the timer has hit 0 , there 's nothing we 200 + soldiers can do against that 1 horseman ... 
  guess we better just , pack up and leave , try again next season . '', 
  meanwhile the general is just standing there like o.o as they all walk out the gates ... 
  god , that map about about the countries the uk has invaded is complete bullshit . 
  sorry this was a problem with my english . 
  i did n't think having a few troops stationed there for peacekeeping was considered an invasion . 
  but i guess if you use the dictionary definition , then technically it is an ` invasion ' . 
  i felt like a little kid doing scratchies again . 
  i love me some war heroines . 
  ca n't wait until the mod is released , so i can do something like [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1yiny2/why_i_love_mods_qin_chinese_swordsmen_and_indian/ ) again . 
  serbia should be black . 
  you 've got it in the 1851-1900 category , but since then we 've gone through five ( i think ) changes . 
  just started up the mod , having a lot of fun with it . 
  i 'd recommend it to everyone . 
  this same thing happened with alexander ii , crown prince of yugoslavia . 
  except it was in london . 
  we do n't exist . 
  but at least we have belgrade . 
  my god it has been too long since i have had good cevapi . 
  counter-strike : source is currently at $ 0.007 / hour for me . 
  +1 to sekigahara campaign . 
  this is amazing . 
  i 'd love to join them for a day . 
  i 'm 15/31 , so just over 48 % . 
  like most others have said , most of my losses come from trash 4c underdog bets . 
  i started with an inventory value of ~ $ 8 and now i 'm upwards of ~ $ 80 . 
  so i 'm pretty happy . 
  obviously he 's a troll , but what 's he got to do with being serbian ? 
  apologies , i thought you were just being ignorant . 
  [ it 's ... . it 's ... . it 's lu bu !!, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfoezv4bdvk ), 
  i loved doing testing out characters in different scenarios , it was so amazing that all possible scenarios were voiced , even if it was a bit lackluster . 
  for example , [ guan yu must fight himself ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hwqli9vyg8 ) !, 
  i honestly think [ arena from dw3 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq5_8chza0y ) is the greatest . 
  though i love kid around ska as well . 
  ah god i 've never seen this video . 
  this is great !, 
  edit : cow cow and cow pee . 
  how could i forget . 
  there 's [ extended japan ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=150812711 ) which adds 97 new regions and 101 new factions . 
  there 's also quite an ambitious mod in development for shogun 2 , which aims to add korea to the map .

  [ here 's a better quality video . 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/c644ktibmos?t=2m1s ), 
  thank you for spreading awareness of this . 
  we need all the help we can get . 
  likewise , i 'm an aussie ex-pat , but i have family in novi sad . 
  ftfy, 
  i think op got the idea from [ here ] ( https://imgur.com/a/pec8r ) . 
  really ? 
  source ? 
  if true this is utterly disgusting . 
  wow , i think this might be a charity game for the balkan floods going on right now . 
  major respect for them bringing awareness to it . 
  oh my fucking god op . 
  i 'm dying, 
  i love me some [ historicdal battles ] ( http://youtu.be/l3ol_sbqgr8?t=13m52s ) :p, 
  other than that it looks pretty cool , looking forward to it . 
  reminds me of [ paul the octopus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paul_the_octopus ), 
  i 'm going to make a $ 1 bet on each prediction of your dog . 
  ** edit : ** [ lead me to victory little dog ] ( http://i.imgur.com/e7exdfq.png ) . 
  this is so not worth it . 
  ak-47 | blue laminate with crown sticker, 
  you 're awesome op !, 
  put a backslash before it to stop ... whatever that line is ... 
  wow , skyrim feels so small now ... 
  i thought you can not build another unit while one is already stationed in the city ? 
  last night i made four $ 1 bets according to the dog 's predictions . 
  lost them all . 
  today i 'm gon na do the same ( if i even have enough skins left ) , but bet the opposite . 
  during a cutscene , one of the characters randomly popped into my overlay while i was reading a guide . 
  was hoping for the scordisci :'(, 
  [ here 's an incredible post by ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/12lwoi/the_respective_roles_of_ninja_and_shinobi/ ) / u/asiaexpert [ on this topic ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/12lwoi/the_respective_roles_of_ninja_and_shinobi/ ) . 
  do you perhaps have a link to that tweet ? 
  they seem like they are making a comeback lately , it might just be because i 'm an adult now and more out and about the city , but it seems like every tenth male i pass has a moustache of some sort . 
  neither , australia . 
  i probably exaggerated my previous post quite a bit , but my point still stands , i see more and more people with moustaches around . 
  [ reminds me of this age-old strategy . 
  just in case you are not aware , this page is n't the real `` today tonight '' page . 
  i know man this is such bullshit . 
  in primary school we had a lego building contest and me and my partner got disqualified for using our hands to stabilise it . 
  fuck you ms. m, 
  [ ask and you shall receive ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdelvd45ey4 ), 
  i can never wrap my head around the fact that the freaking vikings raided africa . 
  in wwi , serbia lost 25 % of it 's overall population , which included 60 % of the male population . 
  officers from tosa wore `` red bear '' wigs . 
  officers from choshu wore `` white bear '' wigs . 
  officers from satsuma wore `` black bear '' wigs . 
  it was a wig used to denote officers from certain domains .

  probably my favourite victory happened tonight . 
  i did a 2v2 battle on avatar conquest ( shogun 2 ) . 
  me and my ally had fots units while the opponents were traditional s2 units . 
  they far outnumbered us by like 3:1 but my ally had artillery so things were looking pretty good . 
  well , my ally gets completely zerg rushed and ragequits the match before his army is even destroyed , leaving me with a suicidal ai allied army and 2 very large and angry samurai armies . 
  i fortified myself on a small hill as they began to surround me on three sides , things were lookig dire for me so i told them to `` hurry up and finish me off : x '' . 
  they both charged simultaneously , sending the cav in first .
