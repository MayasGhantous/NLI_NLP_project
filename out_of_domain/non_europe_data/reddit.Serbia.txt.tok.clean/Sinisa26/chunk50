  christ it has been a while , such a great ad . 
  i really like the shark hunter outfit . 
  it just seems to suit him the best . 
  i played through the whole game with it on . 
  that 's a lie , that 's a lie , that 's a lie , lie , lieeee, 
  malena, 
  i agree man , i agree .

  my favourite thing about freedom cry was how absolutely brutal adewale 's animations with that machete are . 
  oh my fucking god yes ... 
  would n't even be mad if i got a yellow . 
  i believe the wooden forts are from rots , but op is using the wooden fort in a custom battle with s2 units . 
  veteran of over 100 battles and was n't seriously injured once , if i recall correctly . 
  just out of curiosity , would you know if there were any western knights or soldiers who accomplished a feat like this ? 
  one of my favourite people in the boshin war is [ this guy ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/eug%c3%a8ne_collache ) . 
  he is so interesting to me . 
  i 'm really not 100 % positive in this , but i 'd imagine he atleat spent some time on the front otherwise he would n't have received his fearsome reputation . 
  nope , it 's on steam right now for $ 14.99 . 
  he was a few days shy of legally being issued the death penalty . 
  so instead they gave him the longest sentence they could which was 20 years . 
  the scariest part is when you realise it is n't even disembodied . 
  he 's just death staring the ancient cameraman at a really fucking strange angle .

  congratulations on your acceptance !, 
  do you perhaps have a link the the flora sandes audiobook ? 
  i 'd love to see . 
  interesting , i 'll take a look , thanks !, 
  but that first sentence in the description threw me off a bit . 
  it claims that sandes was the only woman to serve as a soldier in wwi , but i know of at least two more in the serbian army . 
  i 'm sure there were a few more serving in other armies as well . 
  i see , sorry i missed that the first time around . 
  malena ? 
  i 'm not sure if it is possible , but if one of the mods are tech-savvy enough , maybe they could put these ` live ' updates somewhere on the sidebar ? 
  on a sort of similar note ; does anyone know why my reddit shows the newest comments as being posted '17 hours ago ' ? 
  it 's so strange , for example , as soon as i comment this , it will say that it was posted 17 hours ago for me . 
  ** edit ** : just realised it is n't only for reddit , it 's happened on another website just now . 
  i would n't say so , it only seems to happen on the internet . 
  i 've reinstalled my browser but to no avail .

  did anyone notice the solid dick grabbing going on at 0:22 ? 
  not to mention the meticulous dick grabbing at 0:22 . 
  yep , this happened to a lot of serbian soldiers in wwi . 
  after the triple invasion of their homeland they retreated all the way across the albanian mountains down to greece , so many died on the trip alone . 
  when they finally reached safety , they literally ate so much they died . 
  princip never intended to kill sophie . 
  that bullet was for governor potiorek . 
  [ not a good start . 
  was going to happen either way . 
  cyrillic is pretty easy to learn to be honest .

  i wonder how war elephants fare against the upgraded orthodox priest units ? 
  when i first started betting , ussr led me to victory 4 times in a row . 
  i trust them to win this one !, 
  during knockout stages if the score is tied at the 90 minute mark . 
  then they play another 30 minutes , split into two 15 minute halves . 
  this is extra time . 
  stoppage time is when a few minutes are added onto the end of the half to account for all the stoppages in that half . 
  the viewers do know that the game will be going to 120 minutes if the game is tied at the end of the 90th . 
  yes !, 
  i loved your posts !, 
  frankly , i 'm fine with you doing whatever you feel the most interested in . 
  from wiki . 
   incited by anti-serbian propaganda and ordered by the command of the austro-hungarian army , soldiers committed numerous atrocities against the serbian people on the territory of serbia and austria-hungary . 
  in addition to executions of prisoners of war , civilian populations were subjected to mass murder and rape . 
  villages and towns were burned and looted . 
  fruit trees were cut down and water wells were poisoned in an effort on the austro-hungarian part to get the serb inhabitants to not return . 
  [ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 51 ] also , the invading bulgarian army committed numerous atrocities , particularly in ni\u0161 and the town of surdulica . 
  uhhhhh ... why ?

  i 'd like to see the battle of kosovo ( 1389 ) , just because it shaped so much of my nation 's history . 
  serbia . 
  kosovo was the beginning of 500 years of ottoman rule over my country . 
  that 's correct more or less . 
  [ tsar lazar ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lazar_of_serbia ) of serbia [ ` cursed ' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kosovo_curse ) all the serbs who ignored his call to fight at kosovo . 
  the battle itself was pretty much a draw/inconclusive , but the ottomans had so many more troops that they could send another army our way in due time , we would have barely any men left to defend against that invasion , so it was obvious that our only choice was to submit to their rule . 
  both lazar hrebeljanovic of serbia and sultan murad i lost their lives on this battlefield . 
  the knight in question who killed murad i is [ milos obilic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milo%c5%a1_obili%c4%87 ) . 
  he and lazar were both beheaded . 
  if you are interested , here 's a film released on the 600th anniversary of the battle . 
  uhh ... what ? 
  looks like bosnia stole serbia 's spot ... 
  other than that , the mod looks amazing . 
  i was hoping to be able to play as serbia though :(, 
  reminds me of doug heffernan and arthur spooner from king of queens . 
  just curious , why was he booted ? 
  i only tune into the scene every once in a while . 
  sorry if this has been reported before , i did a quick search and could n't find anything on the topic . 
  sorry for the gfycat quality , i 'm new to this whole thing .
