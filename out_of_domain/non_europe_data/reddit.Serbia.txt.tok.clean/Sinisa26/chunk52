  i had a friend in melbourne , australia that was called stanko stankovi\u0107 . 
  cool maps , thanks for sharing . 
  the only thing that bothers me , is map 14 . 
  i 'm not sure why but the wording of it just makes it seem like the ah empire steamrolled through serbia and that serbia did nothing to liberate itself ( instead , relying on the allied forces to liberate it ) from the central powers . 
  in reality however , serbia resisted three austro-hungarian offensives ( [ cer ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_cer ) , [ drina ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_drina ) , [ kolubara ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_kolubara ) ) and only capitulated once [ germany , austria-hungary and bulgaria launched a joint invasion of serbia . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/sr/thumb/a/a7/zurnal.jpg/640px-zurnal.jpg ) and the serbian army also played a pivotal role in liberating its homeland , alongside the allied troops . 
  but anyway , that 's just me nitpicking and my patriotism acting up , thanks for sharing again . 
  cheers for doing this . 
  yep , it also says a lot about the serbs , that they managed to defeat a numerically and technologically superior opponent three times . 
  to be fair though , the serbs had a lot of experience from the two previous balkan wars . 
  please let me play as my beloved serbia , ca !, 
  i 'm looking forward to it , but i 'm still disappointed about the whole serbia/bosnia thing :(, 
   agents could also facilitate this . 
  this would be so much cooler than the shogun 2 metsuke style . 
  it 's not so much that , it 's the fact that bosnia takes a prominent place in the balkans while serbia does n't even exist . 
  if anything , serbia should be in bosnia 's spot , or at the very least serbia could possibly take one of venice 's southern regions . 
  this is me just nitpicking though ... 
  / r/twcirclejerk, 
  chinese units are already in the game . 
  there is a whole bunch of them . 
  i 'm about to upload some pictures of them . 
  we can dream brother . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/2cw2cx/s2_mod_morning_sun_gallery_of_ming_dynasty_units/ ) is my gallery of them , 
  yep , it is a mod for shogun 2 that was recently released . 
  it is called morning sun . 
  you can find it in the steam workshop . 
  unfortunately not , i wish i could create something as amazing as this . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.twcenter.net/forums/forumdisplay.php?2028-morning-sun ) is the forum for the mod . 
  additionally the mod also adds new provinces in japan and has new factions to occupy them . 
  you can get the mod on the [ steam workshop ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006580639/myworkshopfiles/?appid=34330 ) . 
  you need all eight parts for it to function correctly .

  i bet not because i 'm trying to turn a fortune , but because i enjoy it . 
  do you know how crazy that adrenaline rush is when the score is 14-14 and your favourite skin is on the line ? 
  to be honest i probably would n't watch professional matches if i could n't bet on them . 
  oh jeez , i bet on titan that game , it was probably my biggest bet as well . 
  i was just praying for a draw . 
  it adds korea to the campaign map , it is made up of 40 provinces all ruled by the joseon dynasty . 
  you need the base shogun 2 . 
  that trailer was great , one thing made me laugh though . 
  the map he used looks rather modern . 
  i do n't ever remember the romans conquering yugoslavia . 
  i did n't , could i perhaps get a link ? 
  i 'd turn gay for shox . 
  let 's not go to the india-pakistan border . 
  op , you know that general has earned his life now . 
  you should retire him to some countryside villa . 
  my expectations are that i will lose a lot of money ... 
  this is a roller coaster of emotions . 
  even if there was movies in fots , nothing will ever beat this masterpiece . 
  fair enough , i guess i 'll just have to pay more attention . 
  thanks . 
  you saved my life , my speakers were on max . 
  yeah , sure why not ? 
  [ a couple of years from now .

  gon na test this out quickly ... 
  ** edit ** : well i 'll be damned , i finally saw my first decapitation !, 
  i wonder if any of the animations showcased in that trailer will be added to the game , because that hand stabbing one looked great . 
  ** from the total war facebook page **, 
  we 've announced two brand new pieces of content , both out today !, 
  rome ii players will find their game updated via steam with a new , free content pack ( august warriors update ) and the daughters of mars dlc will also be available to buy from 4pm bst / 11am edt, 
  the august warriors update adds unique units such as the hex-bearers , amazonian riders and scythian noblewomen to several playable factions , and includes a significant upgrade to the suebi roster . 
  the daughters of mars unit pack brings fearsome new warriors to rome ii . 
  whether in defence of their homelands or called upon to fulfil their part in glorious conquest , female combatants featured throughout the ancient world . 
  adding a swift and deadly mix of fighting styles and abilities to the fray , generals will wisely place value on those who aspire to be the avatars of the war gods themselves !, 
  check out the trailer right here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fwvthmjnok, 
  i 'll probably pick it up on when it is on sale , however , there is a free-lc being released at 11am edt today . 
  wow that was quick . 
  did you get early access to it or has it already been released ? 
  you got my hopes up and now i 'm jealous !, 
  thoroughly enjoyed your review however . 
  keep it up . 
  suebi got the bulk of the update . 
  ** august warriors ( free-lc ) **, 
  \u2022 hex-bearers ( infantry , sword and shield ) : new suebi garrison unit . 
  ambushing from hidden woodland positions , the sword-armed hex bearers strike terror into the hearts of the enemy . 
  \u2022 horse runners ( infantry , javelin skirmishers ) :, 
  these fleet-of-foot warriors can strike hard and fast from cover , making them the elite of the suebi skirmishers . 
  \u2022 spear wall ( infantry , spear and shield ) :, 
  the most defensive spear unit in the suebi roster , spear wall is a bulwark against even, 
  the most powerful cavalry . 
  \u2022 round shield swordsmen ( infantry , sword and shield ) :, 
  their high weapon damage makes the round shield swordsmen fearsome combatants who punch above their weight . 
  \u2022 riders of the hunt ( cavalry , spear ) :, 
  few warriors have faced a charge from these terrifying , frenzied horsemen and lived to tell the tale . 
  ** daughters of mars ( dlc ) **, 
  cimbri bow-women, 
  like many germanic tribes , the dense woodlands of northern europe have impelled the suebi to develop superior guerrilla warfare techniques . 
  adept at making the most of cover and striking from a hidden position , the cimbri bow-women are amongst the finest archers the suebi can field . 
  with superior weapon range and damage , they can wreak havoc before they are even detected . 
  if attacked directly however , they can give a better account of themselves in melee than their principal role suggests . 
  spearwomen, 
  independent , proud , and with powerful gods watching over them , the germanic peoples are famed for their ferocious warriors . 
  the women of the suebi are no exception , and carry the will of the tribe into battle as ably as the men . 
  standing side-by-side with their suebian spear-brothers , spearwomen are exquisite defenders , capable of blunting a charge and instilling fear in the enemies of the tribe .
