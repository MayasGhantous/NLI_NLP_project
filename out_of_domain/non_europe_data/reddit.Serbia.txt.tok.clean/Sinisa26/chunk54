  some bastard called thrak shaman , me and him had a long rivalry after that . 
  bastard killed me like three times and kept gloating about it , i killed him a few times as well but he kept coming back from the dead at the most inopportune times . 
  i kind of miss him to be honest . 
  in regards to number 2 :, 
  when the mission first started i got quite a few uruks running at me , but after i cleared that lot out it was exactly as you described . 
  i think only three torchbearers spawned the whole mission . 
  you got blood on his good boots . 
  every time i see a god damn fots video , it is inevitable that i will have to start a new campaign . 
  1000 + hours and counting ... 
  that 's amazing . 
  god fucking damnit mark !, 
  sarumon sounds like a digimon . 
  holy shit that inferno wallbang . 
  shogun 2 ? 
  never in all my 1000hrs of shogun ii , have i seen something like this . 
  i 'm jealous !, 
  i had terrible problems at launch , but it was still playable . 
  it seems like all the people who are still complaining about rome ii have n't played it for a loooooong time . 
  i spent last week playing medieval 2 , and holy shit did i miss some of the rome ii features . 
  you should pick it up on the next steam sale !, 
  you say that as if it is a bad thing . 
  kinda relevant , is there a way to just drop off a relatively small wall ? 
  it seems to me the options are either ;, 
  - hold e , to hang off it and then drop ( which is kinda pointless seeing as the wall is nearly as short as talion himself . 
  - jump off ( this irks me the most because a lot of the time he just jumps to the next climbable thing instead of dropping ), 
  [ appropriate soundtrack .

  you should 've changed ` cetnik ' to something else , seeing as the chetniks were serbian royalists . 
  try over at / r/steamcoupons . 
  love it , it is so catchy !, 
  i 'm usually against these reaction gifs , but some reason all the ones posted in this sub make me piss myself . 
  amazing how a picture from nearly a century ago can give me such a ridiculous adrenaline rush . 
  great work as always !, 
  i really loved this moment in the trailer . 
  sorry i have n't been paying attention to all the announcements of this game . 
  do you know if there will be some religious system in this game ? 
  sorry i 've been away from the game for a while , what is this photo mode patch ? 
  i love your wife too . 
  10/10 , would follow to the ends of the earth, 
  awesome !, 
  ca n't wait to get back into the game on the weekend . 
  keep up the great work . 
  $ 90 for me in aus ... 
  i think the last time i saw that video , someone said they were actual chechens . 
  do n't quote me on that though , memory is a bit foggy . 
  no matter which thread , no matter how relevant , as an australian i will always upvote this . 
  i would follow givi to the ends of the earth . 
  [ here 's the full video .

  `` boob armour '' generally does n't suit any story . 
  brave ... or foolish ? 
  the term ` hero ' seems to be thrown around a lot these days , but i think this man is truly worthy of that title . 
   the atmosphere, 
  this is what makes it for me . 
  these fat animal memes just make me sad . 
  thanks , this has already been posted before , but this version is much better with subtitles . 
  i love the guy that plays the flute ( ? 
  ) , makes such funny faces . 
  i would 've preordered but it is still $ 90 in australia on steam . 
  i 'm not sure how much it is selling for in us steam , but google is telling me $ 90aud = ~ $ 80usd . 
  nice , i 'll be home in about three hours , thanks !, 
  thanks , just picked it up and so have a few of my friends . 
  you 're a saint . 
  i bet the round after that all the terrorists made sure to die with the bomb . 
  if someone told me this was some fictional alien universe , i would believe them . 
   the best swordsman does not fear the second best swordsman , but rather the idiot who has no idea wtf he is doing . 
  damn yugoslavia got wrecked hard . 
  made a huge bet on ldlc , wo n't even be mad if they lose . 
  this is one of the greatest matches i 've seen . 
  ** first day : ** 11/12 of my bets were on underdogs . 
  i won 3 and lost 9 . 
  i think i lost around 50c that day so not too bad . 
  note , my bets were in the 50c - $ 1 range . 
  ** second day : ** realising that underdog bets are n't working , i decide to go pretty big on ldlc - ibp . 
  lost $ 22 . 
  placed a medium bet on vp in the hopes that i could recover my losses . 
  nope, 
  ** third day : ** please god give me a miracle . 
  [ here you are ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/loungestats/comments/2dtm9w/how_to_install_loungestats/ ) . 
  if you are as bad as me at betting , prepare to weep . 
  i think it kind of has the same connotation in english as well . 
  it 's just kind of ambiguous . 
  i bought counter-strike : source for $ 7 i think . 
  i have 2300 hours in it . 
  i payed $ 0.003 for each hour ? 
  realised this is a bit off-topic , oh well ... 
  i always loved the historical stereoscopic pictures , makes me feel like i 'm really there ...

  czar/tsar pretty much means emperor . 
  i think both czar/tsar and kaiser are derived from caesar . 
  father of aleksandra and danijela , son of cvijeta and husband of biljana . 
  may you squat in peace .
