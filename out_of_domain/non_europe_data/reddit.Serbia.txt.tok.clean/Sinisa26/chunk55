  thanks !, 
  i bet my house on k1ck !, 
  wow , that cavalry charge looks amazing , even if it is staged . 
  ca n't believe k1ck lost ... 
  i 'm gon na have to bet my child on c9 to beat vp in order to make up for that loss . 
  for some reason it only adds to the comedy for me ... 
  could anyone translate ? 
  or just tell us the important points ? 
  thank you . 
  sweet jesus , a couple more bets like that and i could pay off my university debts . 
  it 's only whataboutism if the russians do it , you should know that . 
  i won 12/22 bets for eswc . 
  about 5 of those losses were underdog bets so i did n't lose out on too much . 
  i went from being - $ 17 to + $ 8 over the course of eswc so i am quite happy with myself . 
  is it that time of the year again ??? 
  all in serbia !, 
  legija will lead us to glory and victory !, 
  i 'd rather fight the boogie man naked than isis with guns . 
  yeah , i can usually understand most of a russian written sentence , but once it comes to speaking , they may as well be speaking cantonese because i do n't understand a damn thing . 
  [ lu bu strikes fear into the heart of lesser men ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfoezv4bdvk ) . 
  also , holy shit i miss dynasty warriors 3 . 
  motar2k should host his own cs : go tournament . 
  did that dude hit his killbind ? 
  it looks like he died on short then fell down . 
  or is it just lag from demo ? 
  would this be the biggest upset in csgolounge history ( assuming they take the third map ) ? 
  7 % odds is unreal . 
  what the fuck is happening in this game ? 
  it 's an emotional rollercoaster . 
  i love all the gandalf gifs being posted in the imgur comments . 
  if you have a mod that adds bayonets this will be one of the animations as the unit will begin to use spear animations . 
  rifle + bayonet = spear, 
  ah fuck , this brings back so many memories , those were the days . 
  ** edit : ** why the hell is everyone think this is a dog . 
  have you not ever seen a pig on a spit ? 
  mine was n't quite as displaced as yours , but my pontus campaign took a bit of a ` twist ' . 
  [ this is how it looked ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xay7lw8.png ), 
  i honestly do n't remember much . 
  i think the people to the west and south of me were allies . 
  however , i forgot what was going on with armenia , whether they were allies or enemies . 
  this was quite a while ago , 2 months or more . 
  we should build him a monument that would rival the statue of liberty . 
  we must do our part to ensure his name is never forgotten . 
  ** edit : ** valve should also release operation motar2k . 
  that was incredible , those boulders were amazing . 
  also , that was one tough son of a bitch . 
  those clothes give me sad memories of monteriggioni :'(, 
  scordisci barbarian . 
  serbia . 
  [ singidun/singidunum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/singidunum ) is located on modern day belgrade . 
  kind of just realised how little i know about these people . 
  beautiful , i really think shogun 2/fall of the samurai had the best atmosphere . 
  also , damn those tosa riflemen !, 
  they 've singlehandedly turned the tide of battle against me too many times . 
   hammers and pickles, 
  that is possibly the greatest typo i 've ever seen . 
  i do n't know why someone blocked it out , do people actually get offended or disgusted by that ? 
  it is just a painting ... 
  [ here 's the complete scroll without the black bars ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/hegassen_scroll.jpg ), 
  i 've always loved this one . 
  `` how can we fight against such hate ? '', 
  `` hate back , son , haaaaaate back ! '', 
  also , this one made me laugh , i zoomed into a random unit of thracian noblemen and heard the commander say ;, 
  `` you !, 
  is that rust on your armour ? 
  how dare you spoil my unit ?! '', 
  discovered this last night at around 11pm , and continued binge-watching it into the night . 
  i love it !, 
  even though more people care about the western and eastern fronts , i 'm glad to see serbia getting some exposure as well . 
  i love taz so much . 
  i tried this with a key . 
  lost it on the first match . 
  jesus christ , 60fps on this video is phenomenal . 
  my eyes were glued to the screen . 
  all the hot russian men died in the wwii . 
  i too have a half-broken wooden chair . 
  ah , the plight of being a broke uni student ... 
  the hell is with those red dots on his face ? 
  great hair ratio . 
  comes from this video ... 
  win ?

  hi , this is a bit off topic , but if i preorder from gmg , will i be able to activate the game on steam ? 
  i love ynk . 
  any plans for tonight 's matches ? 
  thanks , i appreciate this a lot . 
  sorry if i seemed impatient , did n't mean to come across that way . 
  is pasza the richest person in poland yet ? 
  soooo ... which demographic do you belong to ? 
  i am actually starting to feel a little bit physically sick ... everytime i bet on overdog they lose :(, 
  everything was going so well until this week . 
  thanks . 
  yeah i have a bit of an issue with trying to bet on every game .
