  it 's tough for me to watch the games and analyse them because they are mostly played at 2-4am at my time . 
  thanks for the advice again . 
  and it is probably my favourite skin in the whole operation . 
  good job !, 
  i 'm crying, 
  does anyone know what happened to / u/reas0ning and his [ maps ] ( https://m.imgur.com/a/qyrcx ) ? 
  i love it so much .

  ** number ** : 1389, 
  ** fact ** : back in the late 1200s , japan and poland had no idea of each other 's existence , but they were both fighting a common enemy ; the mongols . 
  ** bonus fact ** : in 1914 , you would only need to travel through one country to get from japan to germany . 
  [ that country is russia .

  ** joke ** : my penis size :(, 
  why is n't it called / r/age ? 
  yeah , i 've been having a really shitty day , but this really put a smile on my face . 
  legija streams every now and then . 
  ca n't wait for the conclusion of the battle of kolubara !, 
  yep , seems to be deleted ...

  always loved this video . 
  i 'm pretty sure he 's dead . 
  bravado ghr is off the charts . 
  wtf was that shit olofmeister ? 
  edit : again , such a dirty boost . 
  edit2 : i 'm fucking done , enjoy my skins . 
  well , g fucking g. 
  what a disgusting spot , enjoy my skins . 
  pretty fucking mad . 
  was 12-3 half time in ldlc 's favour , but fnatic are abusing a dirty boost to get back into the game . 
  `` one of the most masterful plays '' ... 
  my arse ... 
  agreed . 
  i 'm sad about my skins , but i 'm even sadder for ldlc . 
  alongside that , this does n't even have a fraction of the impact on the game compared to fnatic 's . 
  shame , i was just starting to like fnatic and devilwalk . 
  they can all get fucked now . 
  this is the map where the incident happened . 
  as a serbian , hell yes . 
  mhmmm , i think it is time to quit my rome ii campaign and go play some shogun . 
  you should try the sekighara campaign when you are finished with darthmod . 
  nice , i have had iggulden 's book about genghis collecting dust on my bookshelf for a while . 
  never really found the time to read it , guess i 'll start today . 
  once i got shogun 2 i fell in love with japanese history , but my true passion is for serbian history and wwi . 
  ahhhh , balkans ... 
  [ here 's the longer video . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7ieh7tbgie ) keep in mind , the second annotation have the translation wrong . 
  he is not saying `` i have not been drinking officer '' , but rather `` return/go to your mother 's pussy '' . 
  it 's basically the balkans version of a playful `` piss off '' . 
  fucking pontus , what were ca thinking !, 
  do you reckon we could compile a photo album of all the pro players and their younger selves ? 
  would be a fun project .

  this is one of the main problems i have . 
  when i 'm holding a position as a ct , i often find that my hands get really restless and i take them off the mouse to stretch them or whatever . 
  and naturally the enemy always comes out as soon as i take my hand off the mouse . 
  is there anything that you guys do to avoid this ? 
  should i do what the pros do and constantly switch to knife/sidearm and back ( qq ? 
  ) , or do they do this for an entirely different reason ? 
  i play without a mousepad and a really shitty $ 5 mouse from kmart . 
  how much can i expect it to help me if i buy a mousepad and a better mouse ? 
  also , just a weird hypothetical question that came to me one late night cs session :, 
  what if someone starts defusing without a kit , and halfway through the defuse someone shoots a kit into him and he picks it up . 
  will the defuse carry on as if he did n't have a kit or would it shave 5 seconds off of the timer ? 
   also move your eyes and do n't fixate on a single spot on the screen . 
  thanks for bringing this up , i forgot to put it in my original post . 
  i 've noticed when i do this i just kinda zone out . 
   can you even shoot def kits ? 
  i think they are like the bomb in that regard, 
  they can be moved by shooting , i tested it out before . 
   anyway i have a hard time imagining that they added code to update the defuse timer mid defuse . 
  it 's probably hard coded as 5 or 10 seconds not a certain sequence with 1x or 2x speed . 
  i thought this too , but as i said , it was just a dumb hypothetical question . 
  thanks for responding !, 
   def kits are stationary objects meaning you ca n't shoot or grenade them away . 
  [ are you sure ? 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/a/lhgkb#0 ) i know it is n't the best set of pictures , but you can see i 'm shooting at the defuse kit and it is moving further away . 
  anyway , this was a pretty silly question . 
  i actually had that exact issue . 
  at random times the cord would just seem to disconnect for around 5 seconds . 
  gets really frustrating if it is in the middle of a game . 
  fuck i love taz . 
  fuck , too late now . 
  vp won train . 
  changing to inferno now . 
  what a fucking emotional rollercoaster . 
  saved his body armour .
