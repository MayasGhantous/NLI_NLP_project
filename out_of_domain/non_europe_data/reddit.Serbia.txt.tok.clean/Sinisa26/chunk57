  wait , i just realised , been living here for 18 years . 
  how come we call it `` west ** ern ** australia '' , but we call the neighbour `` south australia '' ? 
  why not south ** ern ** australia ? 
  or west australia ? 
  yes , it is pretty great now . 
  i really love the `` better archers '' mod . 
  gives them some pretty nice buffs . 
  i think it improves both of those and then some other stuff . 
  it might make them a bit op , but i really do love unleashing hell with my archers . 
  koopk for president !, 
  because they would n't be epic anymore if it happened every second animation , 
  this way it is a treat for us when it happens . 
  some people use a period instead of a comma . 
  i think it is relatively common in europe . 
  wish it was slightly bigger up north . 
  all i think about is runescape when i see ` gf ' . 
  this is such a perfect video . 
  3-0 mythic, 
  ** edit : ** 4-0 . 
  was n't even a bet screenshot , but i understand bot . 
  we all make mistakes . 
  still waiting for my skins ... 
  betting four of my most expensive skins wo n't even yield me $ 1 !, 
  i 'm so poor :d, 
  did n't lounge say they would n't put such 1-sided matches up for betting anymore ? 
  because it just wastes bot slots or something ... 
  ** edit : ** https://twitter.com/csgolounge/status/532176408400109568, 
  i see , thanks for clearing that up . 
  he is not saying that fnatic is a low tier team . 
  i think you replied to wrong comment . 
  i 'm pretty sure it is a glitch with the grenade following function . 
  you can only change the view once the smoke grenade despawns or something . 
  this fucking match , my heart ca n't take it anymore . 
  what a fucking rollercoaster . 
  what a match . 
  make sure you do n't lose it on your first bet !, 
  started off good , ended up getting to like $ 40 profit starting , then quickly dropped to - $ 27 . 
  i 've spent the past few months trying to get positive again . 
  when i do get positive i get reckless and make stupid bets . 
  currently i 'm at - $ 8 . 
  it 's like an eternal battle for me . 
  how do you have the general portrait in the bottom-left ? 
  mine has unit information there . 
  is there any significant reason to have the portrait there ? 
  that 's like 100,000 + men . 
  also :, 
   `` they are in front of us , behind us , and we are flanked on both sides by an enemy that outnumbers us 29:1 . 
  they ca n't get away from us now ! '', 
   and they said you were talking shit about us . 
  the [ ` no fog of war ' ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=274481935&amp;searchtext=no+fog+of+war ) mod makes it so you can see the whole map . 
  it is save-game compatible . 
  seems spot on . 
  they tried to sue for peace right after . 
  anyone else getting terrible fps lag on stream ? 
  what a shame , it is making the match hard to watch ... 
  should be on here : http://www.twitch.tv/orenaza, 
  aimface take pistol round on t-side mirage . 
  6-6 now . 
  seems like that pause messed with volgare 's momentum . 
  i 'm using the guaranteed major faction empires mod in the op picture . 
  sparta has 4 regions actually . 
  one in hellas , two in macedonia and one in thracia . 
  [ also this . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ujp4q8mg0c ), 
  same , i 'm getting worried now d :, 
  need to get my bet in !, 
  ** edit ** : i was able to put my bet in if you bet from inventory not returns . 
  bet from your inventory/armory instead of returns and it should work . 
  worked for me . 
  nice job man . 
  apex good job . 
  great eco round . 
  my butthole is pretty puckered ... 
   - content does n't have to be strictly russia , your visualization of a normal day is good enough . 
  we 're here for laughs after all . 
  fixed now, 
  every time i see a picture of shogun 2 i need to go back and start a new campaign ... 
  god damnit, 
  1-0 sweden, 
  t-side cache, 
  just a bit of banter mate . 
  yeah , i had absolutely no interest in this earlier , now i ca n't wait . 
  vp win first map, 
  dafuq was that advertisement ? 
  this guy is amazing , i do n't even understand a word he is saying but i am getting so hyped . 
  [ reminds me of this guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighzlmnsyda ), 
  lol, 
  maybe we can bet on these professional matches as well , like on [ csgolounge ] ( http://csgolounge.com/ ) . 
  no kit either . 
  amazing . 
  sorry if this is a noob question , but do you know if it is save-game compatible ? 
  thanks !, 
  i only got the game a few days ago and am new to modding it . 
  sorry to be a bother , but i downloaded gekokujo from the steam workshop and i ca n't find its folder in the steam directory . 
  is it meant to be in here ;, 
   c : \\ program files ( x86 ) \\ steam \\ steamapps \\ common \\ mountblade warband \\ modules, 
  all i see is native , napoleonic wars and dev1257 ( anno domini mod ) . 
  does the folder not show up in the modules folder if it is downloaded from steam workshop ? 
  that 's the one , thanks man !, 
  that 's fucking amazing .
