  looking forward to your next one !, 
   my god , the untapped potential for an epic film about the serbian retreat of 1916 [ 4 ], 
  if you are interested , there is a very good documentary about it on youtube . 
  [ \u0413\u0434\u0435 \u0446\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u043b\u0438\u043c\u0443\u043d \u0436\u0443\u0442 - where the yellow lemon blooms ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzjqdwokdlm ) ( eng subs ), 
  this one is way better , complete with contagious laughter . 
  paging / u/southslavbestslav, 
  yep , there 's also this one , which is my personal favourite , [ mars na drinu ( 1964 ) ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0172776/ ) . 
  i remember there used to be the full movie with english subs available on youtube but it seems to have been removed . 
  [ here 's the trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvz-yp9ypro ), 
  [ this usually does the trick ] ( http://pngimg.com/upload/hammer_png3890.png ), 
  you 're awesome, 
  that was fucking great , `` just shoot me '' . 
  can we make a photo album of all the old pros ? 
  like a `` then and now '' thing ? 
  he 's a true american hero . 
  would you recommend the mod ? 
  my current campaign has gotten a bit stale . 
  thanks , i 'll give it a shot . 
  pffft , i just got back from a week-long ban . 
  it was terrible . 
  that is quite a bit better than we managed in serbia ... 
  10m break after every round . 
  i 'll be back in 2 hours to watch the second half . 
  god i hope it is n't official . 
  they were my favourite team . 
  that was pretty damn awesome . 
  polly ?!?!, 
  the fuck was that ? 
  what a rollercoaster, 
  4-3 for property on ct, 
  my pleasure . 
  i buy 2 decoys as well when i do it . 
  that was amazing . 
  likewise , it seems as if the button is not responding . 
  on the `` my profile '' page , only the `` loungestats '' button works . 
  i 'm using google chrome , if that helps . 
  aimface is the former name for ination . 
  i believe neno was kicked from the team due to his attitude . 
  regardless , he was still a pretty great player so i think ezpz should have this pretty `` easy peasy '' . 
  k1ng0r has left the ination lineup btw, 
  you 're a lunatic, 
  germany beat brazil 7-1 in the world cup last year . 
  confirmed, 
  holy shit that coach/manager/trainer from mouz is a fucking giant . 
  it 's actually pretty good , i 'm in love with my franks campaign at the moment . 
  i 'm pretty sure i 'll be playing this into the early hours of the morning . 
  that retake was a thing of beauty . 
  is n't that a bug with the game , the camera gets locked onto the smoke ? 
  player was having ping issues so they switched servers . 
  is there not going to be any caster for this game ? 
  better than nothing i suppose . 
  thanks, 
  what a fucking massacre ... 
  i do n't think i 'll ever get tired of these videos . 
  there is no mod for it yet ( as far as i 'm aware ) , however i found this comment on twcenter that might help you . 
  thorin got so invested into that , i hope to see more short stories from him in the future . 
  i regret that i only put about 50c ... 
  research it in the military tech tree . 
  took me a while to figure out as well . 
  you would probably enjoy this . 
  no matter how many times i look at it it blows my mind ... 
  make it fullscreen for maximum effect, 
  cache , inferno , nuke, 
  i 've got you tagged in res , good luck . 
  god damn it . 
  i did n't expect aces to win but this was just too much ... 
  look mate , there 's a certain line you just do n't cross . 
  i would n't wish a dropbear attack on even my worst enemies . 
  what does this have to do with chetniks ? 
  three ination flairs in this thread ... 
  there 's so many of us !, 
  no stream ? 
  edit : nvm it is being streamed on http://www.twitch.tv/esea, 
  ynk is not too shabby either but i do n't know about the rest of the team ( have n't seen any ination games since k1ng0r was in the lineup ) . 
  this will be a fun game to watch . 
  i 've had such a bad week betting , i should really take a break before i lose all my skins . 
  but the addiction is too strong :(, 
  it feels like c9 is getting smashed from checkers every round they go b , but they still do n't check it . 
  i just lost $ 5 :(, 
  the only thing i hate about it is that i ca n't spam low-tier units to keep provinces happy anymore . 
  [ hltv says ` trigy ' is ination 's 5th player . 
  ] ( http://www.hltv.org/match/2294345-ination-saiderc-balkan-championship-season-1 ), 
  ** edit ** : nvm , hltv updated it and removed ` trigy ' . 
  pretty disappointed about dlc being released so early , but the narrative mission sounds kinda interesting . 
  christ , my computer is about to melt just looking at your picture . 
  overtime, 
  has third map started ? 
  if so , score ? 
  nice man , you have good taste . 
  bayonet knives are my favourite :d, 
  i 'm currently saving up to buy myself an ak-47 cartel ( stattrak ) . 
  holy crap , nikolinho is playing as mouz 's 5th player !, 
  ** edit : ** but mousesports website says j0hnny is playing ... hmmm, 
  ** edit : ** now mouz has replaced troubley with j0hnny . 
  my bad . 
  in my defence , it is 5am here . 
  glad i could help,
