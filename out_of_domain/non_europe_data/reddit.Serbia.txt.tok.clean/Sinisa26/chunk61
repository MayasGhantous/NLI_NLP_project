  16-5 for hr, 
  it 's a shame i ca n't get gem to work for some reason . 
  niko not playing for ination ... 
  i wonder who will be their 5th ? 
  ** edit : ** [ 5th player is shevchuk ] ( https://www.facebook.com/efgjuricm/posts/1568749200073009 ), 
  i 'd like to see that happen . 
  [ 5th player is shevchuk ] ( https://www.facebook.com/efgjuricm/posts/1568749200073009 ), 
  i got banned once ( 7 days long ) for saying something irrelevant in the discussions thread . 
  so i try not to post anything unless i absolutely have some important information ( usually regarding serbian teams and/or nikolinho ) . 
  or unless i can help someone in the discussion threads ( people asking for score , stream link etc. . . ) . 
  pls do n't ban me again mods, 
  it makes the remains of bosnia look like a rejected pokemon design . 
  what the actual fuck ? 
  that looks like something you 'd see in a studio ghibli film ... 
  [ proof ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/29w59j/theres_always_that_one_cocky_bastard_who_refuses/ ) : posted it 8 months ago in this sub . 
  ( jesus it 's already been 8 months ), 
  highest was + $ 173.88 , lowest was - $ 25.38 . 
  really glad i manage to get out of that negative slump . 
  16-1 denial, 
  any good movies/books on this topic ? 
  my heart ca n't take anymore of this emotional rollercoaster, 
  exactly the same , if i even try to mess with the sliders to the right my character looks ridiculous . 
  i think it was posted in / r/dataisbeautiful , that posts beginning with `` so , '' actually get more karma on average . 
  ** edit ** : [ found it ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/2tuq0s/reddit_submissions_which_start_with_a_rhetorical/ ), 
  i do n't think they wanted to stop it , sounds to me like the guys riding on top of the bmp were getting pissed at the driver of the silver car . 
  ** edit : ** i rewatched it and now it kinda does look like they are fighting between themselves . 
  i really wish i could get hldj working ingame , for some reason it does n't work at all when i press my hotkey ( the commands etc. . still appear in console ) . 
  it also stops me from using mic when hldj is enabled . 
  reminds me of [ this scene from red cliff ] ( http://youtu.be/n2_asjlzx18?t=17m23s ) . 
  the whole movie is really worth a watch . 
  where did his beautiful moustache go ? 
  this is what i hate about this subreddit . 
  proper analysis is upvoted less than a joke picture . 
  really great write-up man , good job !, 
  really , i got ta be the guy ? 
  ... source ? 
  well , suppose it is time to go out and buy my dog a ball pit . 
  i miss these little clips . 
  would watch them pretty much every time . 
  nothing beats [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ymlwe69ora ) though . 
  who is this caster ? 
  edit : oh shit is this fucking rahim ?!? 
  where do you find these pictures ? 
  i see similar ones all the time , is there like a website for them ? 
  thanks , hopefully i can find one to buy , i 've really loved these pictures you posted . 
  what the fuck ... 
  i hope vp 's momentum wo n't be destroyed if this is replayed . 
  he got booted from the game a couple of seconds into the round ( vac authentication error ), 
  those fucking laughs are as funny as the video . 
  they sound like evil villains from some cartoon . 
  this is an amazing gif . 
  love it , any more like it ? 
  wonder how he got that name . 
  but it is not even written in cyrillic ? 
  [ higher quality ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjb8vlb1rwk ), 
  love this video , sounds like the van is filled with a bunch of evil villains . 
  just fyi , begging for skins is pretty frowned upon in this subreddit , it is even against the rules . 
   [ \u2718 ] no begging for skins !, 
  that 's crazy dude . 
  i 'm trying to switch between like 6 or 7 streams all on one browser . 
  need to buy myself a second screen . 
  fucking hell that place is so picturesque ... 
  i do n't think i 'll ever recover from what happened this morning . 
  we 're down 15-14 and i 'm the last alive against 2 terrorists . 
  bomb has been planted in a. i took out both of them , but could n't find where the bomb was planted and ran out of time . 
  i will never forget my teammates deflated `` oh ... god damn '' or the whole enemy team laughing at me and spamming `` you 're shit ! '' . 
  guess it is time to sub to / r/depression as well . 
  glad to see this . 
  for anyone wondering , here is how the civilians had to cross it before . 
  shogun 2 ** is ** a piece of art . 
  i reckon it is the most atmospheric of all the total war games . 
  agreed , it is an absolute god send for me . 
  i live down the street as well . 
  her dogs go absolutely mental every time i walk my dog past her house . 
  i always did think she was a bit of a strange lady , but good on her for doing this i guess . 
  thank god , it finally seems like the flipocalypse is coming to an end . 
  definitely , it is much better than rome ii ( in my personal opinion ) . 
  and as / u/seal123456 mentioned , the throat singing in the game is phenomenal . 
  agreed , i 've racked up about ~ 400 hours in rome ii and do n't even remember one piece of music . 
  on the other hand , i just about remember most of the shogun 2 pieces . 
  please tell me your teammate is called kenny blankenship . 
  different game , the mouz match had the full fnatic lineup . 
  the first item i ever won . 
  i will never bet it . 
  is there a longer video ? 
  guardian will guard your guardians . 
  first map was a 16-14 victory for titan on inferno . 
  second map is currently at 10-13 for 3dmax . 
  that smile in the second picture melts my heart . 
  disturbed says they will continue to play as a team , just not under the 3dmax name . 
  the team will stay together according to disturbed . 
  glad to see your surgery went well , i 'll drink to your continued good health tonight !, 
  looks bloody awesome man , ca n't wait . 
  just one question though , what is the difference between bolded and non-bolded factions ? 
  ca n't wait to play serbia .

  the lyrics are pretty terrifying as well . 
  [ for anyone who wants to experience it . ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufz1uchm9aa ) . 
  it 's much better ingame though . 
  oh hey , i 'm late to the party but i actually went to school with this guy .
