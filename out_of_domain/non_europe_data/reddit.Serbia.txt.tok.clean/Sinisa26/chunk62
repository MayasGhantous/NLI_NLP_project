  great symbolism in this picture . 
  a slightly different version was featured on the [ front page of the le petit journal on 10th october 1915 . 
  `` while his brother serbian struggles heroically against powerful enemies , the bulgarian is preparing to stab him in the back . 
  other covers of the le petit journal featuring serbia have been posted [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/propagandaposters/comments/29dop2/le_petit_journal_serbia_in_ww1_source_for_amazing/ ) .

  top banter by thorin and r. lewis, 
  does anyone know who the figure is depicted in the statue ? 
  thanks, 
  i enjoyed this comment thread . 
  holy shit that knife !, 
  it is one of my favourite scenes from braveheart . 
  [ here it is for anyone who wants to see it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kg9j5io6yw ) . 
  it is dubbed in russian however . 
  there were some child soldiers in the serbian army during wwi that i know of . 
  genius play from legija . 
  14 minutes and counting . 
  is it a reference to `` the dying gaul '' ? 
  king thorin, 
  no , they are not . 
  22mins before game starts , is that a new record ? 
  experienced it in one of my games , the hilarious part was that the general who said that quote was actually a former takeda general who defected to my side . 
  [ i posted it to this subreddit .

  we 're a crazy bunch of people . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vkh98in.jpg ) is them pictured minutes before their assassinations . 
  also , the amount of times people think of siberia when i mention i 'm from serbia . 
  it is crazy . 
  maybe you 've been getting stuck on a terrorist your whole life , and you never knew . 
  wow thorin , savage ... 
  plot armour, 
  when my army of 60 samurai were attacked by a force of over 300 men . 
  he participated in the [ battle of cer ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_cer ) and was wounded a few times throughout the course of the war .

  ** backstory **, 
  i should n't even be here , that faction does n't even hate me . 
  mod is 1257ad and i was a vassal of serbia , i had about 60 bulgarian prisoners with me which i wanted to sell so i was visiting various cities looking for a ransom broker . 
  i arrived at poson and it was under siege by this ~ 1500 strong army of the hre . 
  i entered the city to check for a ransom broker , instead i was met with the pre-battle screen . 
  for some reason i could n't exit that screen and the only options were to `` join the battle '' or `` order your men to charge without you '' ( or something like that ) . 
  i kept spamming the 2nd option until i ran out of men . 
  now the only option left was for me to join the battle , which is what you see in the op . 
  anyway i managed to kill about 7 of them before i took a javelin to the face . 
  no way . 
  jesus christ i love gplay, 
  my favourite team is the new england patriots , because they are the first team that showed up on google when i searched `` nfl teams '' . 
  try on over at / r/steam . 
  good luck to you, 
   double edit : apparently evo have 2 stand ins ,, 
  where did you see this ? 
  could i have a link ? 
  most eu games start around 2am for me ( australia ) . 
  thankfully , most of my uni classes are during the afternoon and night so i can sleep in . 
  i am absolutely in love with happy . 
  has to be my favourite player , love his playstyle . 
  also , their whole team is fucking hot . 
  especially shox man . 
  like , i have a girlfriend for 3 years , but when shox 's beautiful face pops up on streams , i start to doubt my own sexuality . 
  yeah this was crazy , the video really had a documentary feel to it , but everything was just so wrong . 
  when i tried queuing for mm at 5am australia time . 
  got matched with a pair of drunk chinese dudes . 
  they spoke hilarious broken english , and had like 200 ping . 
  one of them accidentally tk 'd me and spent like 3 whole rounds apologising from the bottom of his heart . 
  sounded like he was nearly in tears , meanwhile me and my friends were also nearly in tears from laughter . 
  was a great game , we lost 16-2 . 
   ` lord ' characters can be recruited to command armies and they have a deep skill tree . 
  they won \u00b4 t age . 
  when they complete quests they get better gear , or mounts . 
  they can perma-die, 
  love the sound of this !, 
  i downloaded the demo right after , but i do n't think they save voices , do they ? 
  actually , i party agree with you . 
  i 'm not a big fan of the skill tree , but i love the thought of our generals getting better gear and mounts . 
  ussr should 've won . 
  it was 11-12 in favour of them and latro got disconnected two rounds in a row while he was alive , forcing them to play 4v5 . 
  perhaps , i 'm just salty as hell :(, 
  yep , mine is normal reddit except for the guy in the top-left who has a ct helmet on . 
  [ looks like this !, 
  i know at least three female soldiers from serbia . 
  interesting story about flora sandes , really . 
  [ milunka savic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milunka_savi%c4%87 ),

  would a roman archer actually wear lorica segmentata ? 
  seems a bit useless . 
  cool pic though . 
  looks like a carbon copy, 
  holy shit that 's amazing . 
  wow , that was phenomenal !, 
  damn , that guy second from right looks like he really does n't want to be there . 
  if gplay lose this , they will have ptsd every time they play inferno .
