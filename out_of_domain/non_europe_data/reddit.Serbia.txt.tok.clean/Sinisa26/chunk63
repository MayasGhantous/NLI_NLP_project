  12-3 vs navi, 
  12-4 vs hellraisers, 
  did amazing at the start managed to +200 % my inventory ( started off with $ 10 ) off the first gplay - envyus game . 
  alongside that , won the first 5 games of sltv . 
  lost a medium bet on navi - gamers2 , and a medium on hellraisers and someone else . 
  won another bet on the final and i also predicted navi to win sltv but will only receive about $ 2 from that prediction . 
  overall , i am relatively happy with this sltv . 
  the final was amazing . 
  damn man i could pay off my uni debts with that . 
  unfortunately , eu games start at 2am for me ( australia ) , so if i wan na watch i got ta suffer during my 9am classes . 
  exactly the same as you . 
  i was expecting some boss fight with the tree spirit or something , but instead what happened is it just died instantly as soon as geralt said he would n't free it . 
  did my game glitch or did yours have the same outcome as well ? 
  / r/slavs _ squatting is much more popular . 
  seems as if it has been removed/deleted ... 
  likewise , seems like many are having this issue . 
  / r/csgolounge admins seem to be deleting all the threads that get posted about this issue ... 
  happened to me twice now , where i 've received 0 winnings . 
  getting quite annoying ... 
  unfortunately i did n't get that quest . 
  [ spoiler ] ( / s `` is it because i broke djikstra 's leg ? '' ), 
  yeah it was brutal , thought it would just be a little nudge , maybe knock him on his ass or something ... 
  i had an issue like this . 
  my game would crash right after the isle of mists cutscene . 
  `` verify integrity of game cache '' fixed it . 
  sorry then man . 
  i hope you fix it somehow, 
  god damn that was good , thanks for that . 
  that was n't princip who jumped into the river . 
  if you are going to accuse someone of being a dumbass , then at the very least make sure your facts are straight . 
  i normally roll with : 4 artillery , 4 cavalry +1 general , 4 skirmishers ( tosa riflemen , sharpshooters , etc. . . ) and the rest is the best infantry i can recruit . 
  never really was a fan of naval battles so i ca n't help you in that aspect . 
  try to prioritize researching kneel fire , turns your infantry into death machines . 
  just in case you did n't know , if you start a land battle inside the bombardment range of your navy , you will be able to call in a naval bombardment anywhere on the battle map . 
  this also applies to the enemy , so try to avoid starting battles in their navy 's range . 
  one more thing , you can personally control artillery fire by clicking the unit , then clicking ` h ' . 
  it 's a great way to kill time , and quite often it is more accurate . 
  [ for the extremely lazy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90n0tdt6a04 ), 
  holy shit lol, 
  also , pcp, 
  happy did phenomenal in the second map though . 
  ` schwarzeneggev ' on a shitty 4c stattrak negev skin , with a single ` lucky shot ' sticker on the stock of the weapon . 
  it is the only skin in my inventory . 
  it has 1,000 + kills . 
  i will never bet it . 
  top bantz at the analyst desk . 
  holy shit the mongolz logo is awesome . 
  i want them to win just so i can use it as a flair on this subreddit . 
  they played eachother on june 5th , and skyred won 16-11 . 
  ~ ~ i 'm not sure if it was the same lineup though . ~ ~ i 'm going small on underdog as well . 
  good luck to us, 
  cheers, 
  what happened ? 
  i bet on tsy because i assumed they were better . 
  did something shady happen ? 
  mongolz , please admin !, 
  hnnnnnnggg , love that csgo-saloon lineup !, 
  glad to see ynk observing . 
  god damn niko is a god . 
  god damn , was planning on betting on clg as well . 
  yep , saw clg take 2nd half pistol . 
  was n't counting on them losing the anti-ecos after . 
  hope tsm wins now . 
  he 's from the serbian part of bosnia , republika srpska , is n't he ? 
  bet on sk but wp to renegades . 
  was a great comeback . 
  added to csgolounge, 
  fancy seeing you here !, 
  had no idea you were into the csgo scene :p, 
  i used to be a huge fan of your colourisations ( still am ) maybe a little over a year ago . 
  glad to see you are getting the recognition you deserve . 
  that 's phenomenal , i wish you the best of luck !, 
  reminds me of the ocarina of time intro . 
  as a serb i am so torn , these are my two favourite neighbours :(, 
  ** edit ** : they 've already played eachother nearly a year ago and romania took it home in a smashing 2:0 victory , however the lineup was quite a bit different . 
  both teams only have two of the original players from the 2014 game . 
  [ i just ca n't bet against this though ] ( http://puu.sh/jyucw/7ffb60e8c1.jpg ), 
  nice , [ this ] ( http://puu.sh/jyfpq/f5d0d2dda2.jpg ) is my great-grandfather . 
  i 'm ashamed that i ca n't grow anything even remotely close to that . 
   he was [ kara\u0111or\u0111e ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kara%c4%91or%c4%91e ) 's grandson , the last king of serbia ( from 1903 to 1918 ) and subsequently the first ruler of the newly created kingdom of serbs , croats and slovenes ( from 1918 until his death in 1921 ) . 
  as the leader of the victorious serbian army in the balkan wars and world war i , he was named petar the liberator . 
  he was a very educated man and a skilled officer . 
  he actively participated in the franco-prussian war of 1871 as a volunteer of the foreign legion command , better known as the legion \u00e9trang\u00e8re , and received the medal of the legion of honor for demonstrated courage , becoming the only european ruler who deserved that medal on the battlefield . 
  under the name petar mrkonji\u0107 he participated in the [ serbian uprising against the ottoman empire in bosnia and herzegovina in 1875 and 1876 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herzegovina_uprising_ ( 1875 % e2 % 80 % 9377 ) ) . 
  due to his honesty and modesty people called him `` uncle pera '' . 
  wow , that was surprisingly good . 
  would like to see more . 
  thanks for some actual information/analysis . 
  [ this picture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/clxsjrq.jpg ) is breathtaking , awesome stuff man . 
  have been looking forward to this game for a while , unfortunately , uni is just taking up too much of my time at the moment . 
  hopefully it drops in price in a couple of months . 
  i like your flair op , 
  efrag facebook page posted a picture showing that their team is warming up and the computers have arrived , so i assume the 45m was correct . 
  should be http://www.hitbox.tv/gamingrs, 
  why should anyone blame any country ? 
  blame the organisation . 
  i love slovenia , and i love serbia . 
  no poorly-run tournament will change that . 
  phenomenal , i love the look of the officer in that first picture .
