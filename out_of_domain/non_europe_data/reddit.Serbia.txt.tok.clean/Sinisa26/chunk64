  if anyone has n't seen it , i strongly recommend watching the movie . 
  / r/oddlysatisfying, 
  well , i mean , he * is * white . 
  is there any videos of this ? 
  how can i change my flair ? 
  [ this is what it looks like for me . 
  interesting , [ that does n't show for me ] ( http://puu.sh/koqim/6bc928b319.png ) , but as long as others see it it is fine i suppose . 
  thank you, 
  it seems to only come up as text for me if i disable subreddit style . 
  ca n't seem to get the flag when i enable the style . 
  thanks friend, 
  reddit could use more soviet music threads . 
  best korea ? 
  what the actual fuck is happening this map, 
  you are the chosen one . 
  but why though ? 
  every team, 
  ikr how are they even walking without legs ? 
  wife her, 
  mackensen erected a monument to the fallen defenders of belgrade . 
  it reads : [ here lie serbian heroes ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/ww1-belgrade-kosutnjak-monument.jpg ) . 
  also , it 's worth reading about [ major dragutin gavrilovi\u0107 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dragutin_gavrilovi%c4%87 ) if you are interested in this topic , especially his final speech to the defender of belgrade . 
   soldiers , exactly at three o'clock , the enemy is to be crushed by your fierce charge , destroyed by your grenades and bayonets . 
  the honor of belgrade , our capital , must not be stained . 
  soldiers !, 
  heroes !, 
  the supreme command has erased our regiment from its records . 
  our regiment has been sacrificed for the honor of belgrade and the fatherland . 
  therefore , you no longer need to worry about your lives : they no longer exist . 
  so , forward to glory !, 
  for the king and the fatherland !, 
  long live the king , long live belgrade !, 
  guilty , my bank account has only $ 6 .

  i would like to do the same in the future . 
  either in europe , or japan . 
  thanks friend . 
  so what happens when the condom balloons deflate ? 
  i know jack shit about explosives , can they still pose a threat on the ground if they are not being hit at high speed by a jet ? 
  well said man , i 've noticed this with the anti-russia sentiment on reddit after the ukraine fiasco . 
  every counter argument was responded with `` how much is putler paying you ? '' . 
  drove me insane . 
  i was hoping i 'd see more of [ \u017divojin mi\u0161i\u0107 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%bdivojin_mi%c5%a1i%c4%87 ) in this aar . 
  yep , it was terrible . 
  there 's a whole bunch of these '' ( adjective ) ( country ) memes '' pages . 
  some of them give me a good laugh . 
  do you by any chance have a link to that episode on youtube ? 
  thanks man . 
  does n't this also prevent you from [ getting the quest to kill radovid ? ] ( / spoiler ) . 
  i was really looking forward to that until i shoved djikstra aside too forcefully . 
  mine plays sandstorm every once in a while , i 'm patiently awaiting the day i hear rick astley in the gym . 
  god damn , there is just something so beautiful about shogun ii . 
  every time i see a picture of it on this subreddit i just want to start a new campaign .

  wow those models look pretty damn good . 
  it was a pretty common thing among the nobility in china .

  [ here 's the thread from when i posted that last picture . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1bsb5x/well_fuck/ ), 
  aye , my dream is to play serbia in a total war game in the future . 
  until then , europa universalis will have to do . 
  skip to around 6:20 . 
  serbia and montenegro is still present on the globe , so that puts it somewhere between 1992-2006 . 
  for once it seems like a game or dlc i am eager for will be released right after i finish my finals . 
  reminds me of this video . 
  christ , that 's absolutely terrifying . 
  such a beautiful sight , i ca n't even imagine how happy they must be . 
  wish the war would end so we could see this on all sides tenfold . 
  that human pyramid is impressive . 
  yep , and after that he 'll be well on his way to subjugating the natives .

  edit : i guess it is [ this . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olivier_salad ), 
  `` voyna i mir / war and peace '' i think it was called . 
  wow , thanks for this . 
  that 's actually really interesting . 
  as a serb , it brought me to tears . 
  i think i remember a greek on / r/europe saying that article was bullshit . 
  ** edit : ** [ here you go !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ular0/no_greek_women_are_not_having_sex_for_a_sandwich/ ),
