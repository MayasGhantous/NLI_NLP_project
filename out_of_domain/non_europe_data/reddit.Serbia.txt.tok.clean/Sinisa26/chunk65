  and they said you were talking shit about us . '', 
  oh man , does anyone have some links to other funny stuff that have happened in the scw ?

  damn man , i 'm sharing one bathroom between seven people .

  nice job btw !, 
  if he is from syria or has family in syria , then surely he would know people from both the government and opposition sides . 
  if he said he had friends in isis or jan then i suppose that would be a cause to start worrying .

  i want to unsubscribe from olaf facts . 
  so this one might be a bit strange , but it 's what i do to work my arms when walking my dog . 
  if your dog is trained not to pull during walks then this probably wo n't work . 
  my dog pulls ** a lot ** when i take her for walks . 
  what i do is to make sure that when she pulls i never have my hand out in front of me , rather they are by my side . 
  my forearms are on fire by the end of the walk . 
  not sure if this could have any substantial effect on size/strength but i feel like it 's better than nothing . 
  beautiful dog btw , [ here 's mine ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ggort6n.jpg ) . 
  yeah dude , no way this is real . 
  i 'll ride the downvote train with you . 
  i got you, 
  seems like a pretty cool dude , i like his vlog ( ? ), 
  yeah , i 'm with you man .

  is there a subreddit to follow this conflict , akin to / r/syriancivilwar ? 
  also , even to me it seems farfetched , but is there a possibility of russia - turkey conflict seeing as they support opposing sides ?
