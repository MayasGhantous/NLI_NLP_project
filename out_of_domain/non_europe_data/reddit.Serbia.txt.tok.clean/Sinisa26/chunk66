  i 'm pretty sure that 's the only way it can happen realistically . 
  i 've seen it happen as well . 
  the episode where he is reading the mail from his son , and is on the verge of tears , and then his son ends the mail with `` thai kick '' , has got to be my favourite . 
  poor dude . 
  and this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzcgqw5woro, 
  it honestly seems like reddit is a competition these days to see who can be the most offensive ... 
  one of the pilots had a newborn baby , i wonder if that 'll help some of the dumbasses here show some empathy ? 
  it 's fine not caring , i 'm just appalled at the shitty attempts at humour and video game references , and people thinking the pilot 's lives are worth less just because they are turkish . 
  his name was albert einsteinoglu as well , and before he went on this mission the commander gave him $ 100 . 
  i 've seen it mentioned on turkish news articles that he was a father , some say the father of a newborn . 
  i know they will obviously be pretty biased , but take that as you will . 
  i 'm not american friend , have another guess . 
  i saw a comment here saying turks are closer to cockroaches than to humans , and even worse in other threads . 
  regardless , i still do n't think their lives have any less value just because they are soldiers , and i 'd say the same for any nation 's soldiers . 
  you do n't have to agree with me on that , that 's up to you . 
  good effort, 
  thanks for providing [ another example . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/wtf/comments/4jdggs/turkish_attack_helicopter_hit_by_rpg_and_goes_down/d360sdr ), 
  i definitely do , but you could say the same for the other people . 
  i 'm positive that soldiers armed with those sorts of weapons do n't have peaceful intentions . 
  and again , i do n't know the complete situation of this conflict , but i know every conflict is not black and white . 
  if the video was shot from the pilot 's point of view , and showed them killing those guys on the ground , and the comments here were gloating or trying to make jokes , i 'd probably feel the same way . 
  mate , you 've already said pretty much the same thing to me twice , i do n't know what you 're trying to accomplish . 
  you can tell me a thousand times that they deserve to die because they are turks and it wo n't have any effect . 
  nah , i 'm an australian serb , so posting about my albanian masterrace would be pretty weird . 
  you 're welcome to go through my post history if you want . 
  i do n't really mind . 
  damn , that 's some irrefutable proof . 
  well , you 've convinced me . 
  thanks , it 's nice to have an actual discussion .

  thanks . 
  i once lost against just the ottomans as serbia with austria , hungary and the entire commonwealth on my side . 
  then beat them in a new game with just hungary . 
  the game is weird like that . 
  i 'd recommend getting two big powers on your side ( if you can ) then declaring when the ottomans are busy in anatolia . 
  it 's good if you can get albania as a vassal so you can use skanderbeg . 
  also make sure all your allies are same or higher military level . 
  good luck , may du\u0161an the great and car lazar guide your mouse . 
  if god did n't want us to conquer the holy land , why did he populate it with infidels ??!??!? 
  it 's crazy , he looked like a deer in headlights . 
  i wonder why it took so long for both of them to react ? 
  did the saa soldier hope they would let him live/take him prisoner ?

  yeah , it 's a really nice map . 
  the only complaint i have is with the insert in the bottom-right . 
  i think the colours between the mediterranean and landmasses should be swapped . 
  or at the very least , the land colour should n't be light blue . 
  attacking skanderbeg in his home province with no general of my own . 
  serbia was perhaps not the best starting choice . 
  also , i 'm sad to admit that i got around 400ish hours into the game before i realised naval blockades make sieges go quicker . 
  you know the geneva convention exists for a reason ?? 
  a lot of the buildings in serbia are like that , or maybe we 're just too poor to rebuild , but i 've heard it said a lot that they are left as reminders .

  wow , i love this painting . 
  i wish i could find the artist 's name to see more from him . 
  did that guy get shot in the ass ? 
  he was probably pissed the guy did n't reverse fast enough to kill him . 
  such is life in russia . 
  i think it is fair to assume this like 99.9 % of the time , no ?
