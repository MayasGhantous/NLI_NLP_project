  yep , that is the order . 
  i 'm just curious as to why i get two heirs not even a second apart . 
  that 's some hectic / r/iamverysmart material ... 
  one ducat ? 
  that 's an insult mate . 
  i 'd start beating the drums of war if i were you . 
  what 's the green streak at the bottom ? 
  rebels ? 
  thanks , that makes a lot more sense . 
  thanks , that makes a lot more sense . 
  i see he learnt from the best . 
  serbia lost 25 % of it 's entire population during wwi . 
  i can understand why we 're omitted from the game as we 're not a well known front , but i hope serbia 's sacrifice is at least mentioned in the campaign . 
  this post really makes me realise how much i hate the `` seen '' feature on facebook now . 
  and deir-ez-zor is still standing ... crazy, 
  will there be a noticeable impact if the government can connect to the sdf in northern aleppo , cutting isis off completely from turkey and the outside world ? 
  does isis even get foreign fighters anymore ? 
  [ a split-second later ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mt4jwnr.jpg ), 
  is this that video of that japanese politician doing some ridiculous over the top crying ? 
  i 'll see if i can find it .

  i think you need the blood pack dlc for the heads to fly off , if you do n't have it the same animation is played but the head is still attached . 
  / r/propagandaposters in 100 years time, 
  why unfortunately ? 
  it 's pretty popular in serbia as well ( which is where i assume the grave is ) . 
  and you 're right : * rad * = happy , * mir * = peace, 
  there are a lot of serbian and russian names ending in * mir * , usually with another word joined before it , connected with either an * i * or * o * . 
  for example :, 
  vladimir = * vlad * ( power ) i * mir * ( peace ) . 
  radomir = * rad * ( happy ) o * mir * ( peace ) . 
  branimir = * bran * ( to defend ) i * mir * ( peace ) . 
  ratimir = * rat * ( war ) i * mir * ( peace ) lol, 
  i do n't think i 've ever laughed at a reddit thread this hard . 
  thank you / r/soccer , you 're the best . 
  this really is a great place . 
  i 've been lurking for the better part of two years , and one thing i 've noticed is that even though supporters from all sides are here , the subreddit still manages to be relatively unbiased and cordial place for discussion and news . 
  thank you mods !, 
  well , maybe not from every single individual group , but i 've seen people with isis flairs and whatnot . 
  can someone explain to me what the ` al-sham ' part of these various rebel groups means ? 
  google translate tells me ` jaish ' means ` army ' and ` ahrar ' means ` free ' . 
  thanks , makes sense !, 
  thank you !,

  i managed to get emperor as france by allying/rming with four electors , getting a diplo-rep adviser , and taking missions to increase diplo-rep . 
  did n't even need to touch austria , also managed to get the full burgundian inheritance . 
  but it was my first time playing in hre and i messed it up bad .

  [ the french-spanish alliance had a massive morale bonus over us , but we managed to push through with just sheer numbers . 
  poland also got a pu over brandenburg , who basically conquered all of denmark + some hre land . 
  so my web of alliances/pus pretty much constitutes everything east of the hre and north of the hre ( minus scandinavia ) . 
  but i 'm so far behind in technology .

  we will never escape ` remove kebab ' meme . 
  it is eternal . 
  does that say `` only tesla saves the serbs '' on the orthodox cross instead of `` only unity saves the serbs '' ? 
  kiev is completely fine , pretty much anything outside of donetsk and luhansk proper is pretty safe .

  was really hoping this was posted . 
  one of my favourite trailers . 
  i wonder who made that video ? 
  those are some serious watermarks . 
  thought milunka savi\u0107 would 've been here , especially after the great war episode on her .

  contact with china ? 
  i 'm fairly sure they had regular embassies there before the whole mongol ordeal . 
  it 's so much more saddening to see the names and ages instead of just a number . 
  i wish this war would end soon and all those who are responsible for this suffering would be punished . 
  i was just watching a chinese history drama set in the three kingdoms , and i was wondering whether serbian '' \u010daj '' was derived from mandarin `` cha '' . 
  great timing on this post op . 
  are there any more maps like this ? 
  my bad , i missed the [ oc ] tag . 
  are you planning to make more in the future ? 
  i really enjoy this style .
