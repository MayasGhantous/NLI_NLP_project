   while holding your arms out straight, 
  i 've seen it mentioned that your elbows should be by your side with your forearms out horizontal , which is how i 've been doing it . 
  is there a big difference ? 
  thank you !, 
  can anyone translate the text ? 
  the english on the pestle says `` internal islamic fronts afghanistan '' i think , is the arabic on the pestle just a translation ?

  - fabricate on lo and declare war . 
  they are normally allied with the teutonic order , but they rarely join due to getting beat up by poland .

  - take goldingen at the very least , this allows you to fabricate on danzig . 
  take whatever else you can without risking a coalition ( or feed lo to pskov ) . 
  - fabricate on danzig , declare war on either to or danzig itself . 
  sometimes poland forces to to release danzig as a sovereign state .

  i think it was poland . 
  serbia is seemingly piggybacking on poland 's victory over the ottomans .

  how does england suddenly become the aztec empire ? 
  i love this song . 
  i 've heard that it was made to commemorate the battle for tsaritsyn , where the trains/train tracks played an important part in winning the battle for the soviets , so the song sounds like a train speeding up . 
  my memory might be fuzzy , but i think that is the general gist of it . 
  ah , my bad . 
  i 've never played ck2 . 
  it would be pretty cool to have something like that for euiv . 
  i 'll take death , thanks . 
  just about every photo he posts on facebook , he has a red bull in his hands . 
  is it known whether it was destroyed in battle ? 
  are there spooky skeletons inside ? 
  is there an estimate to the casualties on each side ? 
  glad to see this silly conflict hopefully come to an end . 
  we are all cooked chicken on this blessed day . 
  i understand that much , but i just feel like both factions have bigger fish to fry at the moment .

  those pockets were designed to hold powder tubes for early firearms . 
  i guess most people who wore chokha moved on from those firearms , but the pocket style remained because it was such an identifiable part of the outfit and culture . 
  he probably has ornamental cartridges in there , or cigars , idk i 'm not a chokha expert .

  the best part is , if you play your cards right , you can get the full inheritance as france . 
  only requirement is for you to be hre emperor . 
  i had no morals to start with . 
  but for real though , after 1000hours this is my first game as the ottomans . 
  to expand on this . 
  i just gave all my orthodox land to the dhimmi estate , and then revoked it the next year . 
  if they have low enough loyalty , they revolt in stacks of around ~ 8 in each province . 
  i just gave all my orthodox land to the dhimmi estate , and then revoked it the next year . 
  if they have low enough loyalty , orthodox rebels revolt in stacks of around ~ 8 in each province . 
  just let them take over the country and force convert you . 
  yeah , you can see the orthodox cross in the second picture . 
  depends how far you are into the game , religious ideas as orthodox ottomans is really good , because after a couple of years the only orthodox nations will likely just be you and russia/muscovy , free cbs everwhere . 
  pair this up with the conquest of mecca and jerusalem modifiers , you can have 4 missionaries with pretty high strength . 
  i feel you on the flag though , i 'm serbian orthodox myself so playing as orthodox ottomans feels doubly wrong . 
  they actually contributed a ridiculous amount of manpower to the war . 
  they fought on pomerania/russia 's side . 
  they sent an army all across africa , the middle east , and then anatolia to siege down my capital . 
  they were a constant grievance and if they did n't join against me , i 'm sure i could 've finished the war like 3 years earlier . 
  for sure . 
  these are the inventions that drive our great nation forward . 
  denmark took some provinces from novgorod . 
  savoy actually did n't lose a single province , instead he gave away most of his ally 's land . 
  i really did n't expect this from an ai , it 's such a human player thing to do . 
  savoy took two high development provinces from milan and then expanded a bit more in northern italy i think . 
  they had both me and france as allies so they probably thought we 'd be able to ward off all of europe but fuuuuuuuuuck that . 
  i 've never played multiplayer in my life , so if savoy is human there must be some spooky stuff going on . 
  if you restart enough times , you can get france to be friendly towards you . 
  yep , their king was a more honourable person than i. 
  it was definitely possible , but my armies were all in africa and my navy got destroyed by england in an earlier war so it would 've took too long . 
  i could 've probably raised some merc armies , but to be honest , i did n't really even like savoy in the first place .
