  oh god , when he is reading the emotional letter from his son and he ends it with `` thai kicku '' . 
  give those provinces to the dhimmi estate and then revoke them . 
  if they have low enough loyalty , heretics should spawn and you can just let them convert . 
  same for catholic/orthodox provinces .

  just a quick question about petolucem 's maps . 
  what are the red-shaded areas ( artillery college , water treatment , research center , etc. ) . 
  are they just areas of high importance ? 
  thank you !,

  interesting to note the mounted crossbow at the top of the fort , really shows how archaic the qing army was at the time .

  eastern orthodoxy . 
  pretty sure it is russian . 
  man this awakens some horrible memories deep down inside of me , i subscribed to this subreddit to laugh at memes not to get depressed and have existen ... uh i mean me too thanks . 
  can someone describe what is so terribly nsfl ? 
  i usually have a pretty strong tolerance for this stuff but these comments are making me reconsider opening it . 
  thanks , i think i 'll pass . 
  i think the last time this was posted it was pointed out there was absolutely nothing anyone could do in that situation . 
  even if there was a team of surgeons around with the best equipment . 
  always ally/diplo-vassalize serbia and remove kebab using them . 
  he is also the main focus of this documentary by vice , posted higher in the thread . 
  just for anyone confused , june 15th ( julian calendar ) vs june 28th ( gregorian calendar ) . 
  worth mentioning that both the ottoman sultan and serbian king lost their lives in that battle . 
  also a few more things happened on that day . 
  - 1876 : declaration of war against the turks, 
  - 1919 : treaty of versailles, 
  - 1921 : king alexander i proclaims new constitution for the kingdom of serbs , croats and slovenes . 
  finally got my driver 's licence 4 years late to the party . 
  ca n't believe i put it off for so long . 
  nice name , 
  i was also gon na mention that it was probably just some hardcore tanning from being in the sun a lot . 
  probably got france in a personal union . 
  i think the revolutionary flag is chosen at random , and you inherit the colonies of your lesser partner . 
  my bad , i 've never actually gone revolutionary . 
  me too thanks, 
  the wikipedia page for [ tamna ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tamna ) seems to answer just about everything . 
  first reference of it is from the * sanguozhi * in 3rd century , it refers to it as an island off the coast of korea that had its own distinct culture and language . 
  seems like it traded with japan , korea , china , southeast asian nations and even chola india . 
  as someone who reads cyrillic everyday , my eyes are bleeding . 
  i think the fort was removed in the latest update . 
  i 'm just imagining australia as an hre style group now . 
  take 3 provinces in tasmania , and aboriginals from nt who literally do n't even know you exist , join a coalition against you . 
  this subreddit 's motto . 
  [ this is the ultimate birthday sadcringe ] ( https://i.imgur.com/ugnrtvo.jpg ) . 
  if i remember correctly though , 4chan found his facebook and all wished him happy birthday or something nice like that . 
  seems pretty clever from my 100 % complete layman view . 
  serbs generally do n't have middle names . 
  he was also an serbian orthodox priest . 
  [ there are more pictures on his serbian wikipedia page ] ( https://sr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%91%d0%be%d0%b3%d0%b4%d0%b0%d0%bd_%d0%97%d0%b8%d0%bc%d0%be%d1%9a%d0%b8%d1%9b ) . 
  i follow both of them on facebook , they post videos and photos there . 
  i 'm not sure about this subreddit 's policy on handing out ` personal information ' , so i can pm you their facebooks if you 'd like . 
  the videos they post are n't translated though so it is a bit of a hassle , and for the pictures you have to rely on the facebook translation thing , but you can get the general sense of what they 're saying . 
  rabea kalawandy ( beard dude ), 
  sohayb masri ( other dude ), 
  i feel like this is really geared to me as a serb living in queensland . 
  did you pick up exploration/expansion , solely to fill in those two wasteland provinces under the `` i '' in iraq ? 
  i feel you haha . 
  it always pisses me off because those two provinces are part of a state , and i like to have clean state borders . 
  why does god hate me ? 
  / r/shitcrusaderkingssay is probably my favourite subreddit tbh . 
  i do n't even play the game .

  i 've seen this photo quite a few times and tried to research it , but never found anything that would suggest he was dead . 
  and that percentage accounted for 60 % of serbia 's male population . 
  it 's the worst when you have your army on low maintenance , and some 100k stack from bum-fuck nowhere stops on your army for a while , leaving you with an army with a decimal number !, 
  they should have to pay to bring my army strength back to a whole number .

  i did mine in burleigh waters about 2 months ago . 
  it was pretty chill . 
  try to book your test before rush hour . 
  the tester i had in the car with me was pretty laid back as well . 
  i think i only had to do a reverse parallel . 
  good luck !, 
  far left is serbia i 'm pretty sure . 
  i guess that makes second from left belgium . 
  lol what, 
  i love the shifty look around he does after . 
  i 've noticed if poland rejects the union with lithuania , novgorod manages to get an alliance with lithuania often , since muscovy is a shared enemy . 
  ah good point , did n't see that . 
  though in my most recent game , poland chose a local noble and still ended up getting the pu over lithuania like 20 years later . 
  [ winter swimming ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_swimming ), 
  is n't there a trait that makes rulers more likely to pick exploration ideas as well ? 
  since you are the one true faith \u2122 , it pretty much gives you a kick-ass cb against nearly every bordering nation , for every one of their provinces as well .
