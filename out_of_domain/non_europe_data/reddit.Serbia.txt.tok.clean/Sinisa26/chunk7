  i had something like this happen as well , except it was in shogun 2 . 
  and his feet were n't straight like your native american . 
  it 's as if he was still in the saddle position but had been raised by about 4 feet . 
  god that made me giggle . 
  yes but , it 's making everyone on earth live forever . 
  not just yourself , therefore you wo n't be an outcast because you evolved . 
  but does that mean , children will be immortal as well . 
  or will they live normal lives while their parents live on forever . 
  that 'd be horrible , living past every single one of your child 's deaths . 
  also ,, 
   all that it 's cracked up to be . 
  i see what you did there . 
  it was still an enjoyable movie , even though it is littered with historical inaccuracies ... 
  `` all my life , i have dreamed of a unified japan , of a country strong , and independent , and modern . '', 
  i enjoyed ezlo ... 
  and wallpaper 'd . 
  imo , all wars need music , or war drums . 
  current emperor akihito can trace his lineage back to jimmu ( first emperor ) , akihito is related to alexander the great . 
  awesome . 
  edit : i forgot this was a 2 month old thread , i apologize for grave digging . 
  albert !, 
   koreans stepping on the american flag at the revolution memorial . 
  this one is awesome . 
  ( not the part about stepping on the flag ) , just the detail in their faces . 
  god i miss tloz . 
  welp , time to go finish ocarina of time ... for the 15th time . 
  edit : oh wait , i should probably go get skyward sword . 
  edit2 : are link and zelda the only recurring characters in ss ? 
  god , i kind of miss navi now :(, 
  i would n't call it lucky or skill . 
  it just happened to be a glitch or something . 
  i was outnumbered probably 3:1 and they had superior troops . 
  and they all routed before even reaching me . 
  came here to say this , the ceiling is detracting from the overall beauty of the room . 
  it still looks nice though and your husband is lucky to have a lovely wife like you !, 
  walk it off . 
  some context on this [ one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/p1qqp.jpg ) ? 
  hardly seems real ? 
  pictures [ 4 ] ( http://imgur.com/a/8uozg#3 ) and [ 5 ] ( http://imgur.com/a/8uozg#4 ) would make for the most awesome city to explore in any game ever . 
  one thing that would need to accompany it though , would be an awesome soundtrack . 
  hurry up and get to qlddddd !!!!!!!!, 
  i 'll be sure to drop by . 
  i 'd also like living in the ` slums ' as my parents are from rural serbia and both worked on farms . 
  i always wanted to travel back in time and live in a farm or village ( minus the negative [ life expectanct , diseases etc. . ] ) . 
  although , i think the slums expectation is a bit unrealistic , it 's like the stone age down there . 
  awesome work though !, 
  i like this subreddit , it has awesome stuff . 
  and that is a beyond awesome idea . 
  just the fact that you can fuse animal and plant ... my god . 
  the craziest part is , i might live to see it ... 
  in 15 years , a mysterious orange fog will have enveloped the world ... 
  [ relevant !, 
  one of arthur jibilian 's final [ interviews . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvepkxmrrqw ), 
  one time , i told one of my artillery units to fire on some approaching samurai . 
  instead of firing . 
  just one person out of the team , slid across the map and started attacking them in melee . 
  very wtf worthy . 
  ~ ~ as has been said before total war : the three kingdoms . ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ that 's china just to clear that up ! ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ although , i would n't mind playing one where i could play as serbia . 
  come on ca . ~ ~, 
  man i 'm an idiot : <, 
  i apologize . 
  ~ ~ it 's not really my area of study but ~ ~ the japanese do have ancient scrolls depicting [ fart wars ! ] ( http://m.io9.com/5886529/japanese-fart-scrolls-prove-that-human-art-peaked-centuries-ago ) . 
  as that guy in the comments said `` i guess this was the ` divine wind ' which drove away the mongol horde ! '', 
  he might be confused with the people always asking '' ... 
  in your period of study ? '', 
  i only learnt it a couple weeks ago . 
  very surprising . 
  and i do n't know what i was talking about , japan is definitely my area of study -_-, 
  or out a cat , very strange mindset . 
  reminds me of a certain cracked article ... 
  `` if you had somehow never seen or heard laughter before , like if you lived in north korea '', 
  you only have to look at a night satellite image of the two koreas to see how horrible it is . 
  [ link ] ( http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/tim/2011/12/19/northkoreamap_620x350.jpg ), 
  shogun 2 . 
  i had about 3 yari attacking 2 yari . 
  the enemy yari were in the castle , my 3 yari climbed the walls but the enemy was doing a good job holding them off . 
  so i wanted my general to hit the enemy yari from behind . 
  i send him to go burn the gate . 
  slowly watching the % go up . 
  explosion, 
  `` a black day !, 
  our general has fallen ! '' . 
  one person died , and it was my general -_-, 
  not long thereafter , my yari started routing , luckily my archers finished off the enemy yari . 
  that sounds awesome , it 'd be very much appreciated if you could provide a link . 
  i would n't say it 's much of a one liner , but it 's an old serbian proverb with a damn good meaning . 
  `` let war be waged in the house of him who wants it . '', 
  wow , that one looks bloody awesome . 
  thank you very much lsd lover . 
  you have made my day , 
  god damnit serbia ... 
  precisely , i have no idea what the hell was going through my mind last night . 
  i noticed my `` era '' mistake , but could n't be bothered editing it . 
  my comment saying i do n't study japan was intended to mean `` i do n't study japanese history ** professionally ** '' . 
  but then i realised i doubt anyone studies their favourite era professionally . 
  okay i 'm going to bed .
