  serb here , apart from differing religions we 're practically the same people . 
  the only people getting pissed at being classified in the same group as the others are ultra-nationalists . 
  unfortunately , they are also usually the loudest . 
  maybe about a year after it started . 
  i was originally pro-rebel but switched when i started following more closely ( around end of 2013 i think . ), 
  which honestly seems like the more believable tale here . 
  i do n't see any reason for the syrian army to be using chemical weapons at this stage in the war , when so much is going in their favour . 
  rip to the victims . 
  also if you drop whatever you 're carrying , the other guy will die instead of you . 
   but decapitation with one swing of a sharp sword is just as painless as a bullet to the head . 
  do you really think battlefield beheaders are merciful enough to use one swing of a sharp sword ? 
  forever in our hearts .

   if she ca n't go to the movies on thursday , she 'll say , `` oh , i have time off on saturday between 2 and 5 . 
  want to go then ? '', 
  if she does n't like you , she 'll just say `` i 'm really busy , sorry . '', 
  i ca n't believe i was so socially unaware a couple of years ago to not be able to understand this . 
  would 've saved me a lot of time chasing dead ends . 
  live and learn i guess ... 
  not sure why czechy is called that , but it 's true i 'm using the endonym empire mod . 
  is n't smolensk released from lithuania ? 
  `` my ancestors are smiling at me , imperials . 
  can you say the same ? '', 
  i know haha , but i thought it still works because nilfgaard is an empire . 
  what 's that province/nation above shirvan ( e01 ) ? 
  looks like when a custom nation save breaks . 
  there 's an event chain that basically gives you a free pu on a royal marriage partner . 
  i think the rulers have to be opposing genders , same faith , and the two nations border each other . 
  [ i got a pu over russia as serbia which made me unstoppable . 
  did anyone notice khodynt ( one of the east siberian opms ) migrated all the way to fucking uzbek and took a chunk out ? 
  local churches have opened their doors to provide shelter for those affected . 
  if you live nearby maybe you could try visiting . 
  that 's amazing , are there more ?

  ** rule 5 : ** it is 1544 and only the british isles has colonialism . 
  ** update : ** printing press just spawned , colonialism has n't left british shores . 
  decided to develop it in alexandria . 
  [ endonym empire ] ( https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=381103735 ), 
  serbia does come up as srbija in the endonym empire mod , but i 'm playing as a custom serbia for some shenanigans . 
  it 's a custom nation so the icon is st. george slaying the dragon on a serbian tricolor flag . 
  naturally . 
  when i started the game i was only interested in conquering the land required to form rome so i made lithuania release kiev , smolensk , polotosk , and galicia-volhynia instead of taking their land . 
  kiev ate gv and then went wild on the hordes . 
  they are like two provinces away from india at the moment . 
  my bad haha , my screenshot key controls brightness as well . 
  taking turns being beat up by france , aragon , morocco , and me . 
  they also seemed to focus on africa way more than the new world . 
  i did eventually . 
  posture and confidence goes a long way .

  jesus christ that 's a workout in itself . 
  probably in reference to [ lazarus of bethany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lazarus_of_bethany ) who was [ brough back to life ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/raising_of_lazarus ) . 
  you 're bringing the serbian empire back to life . 
  also a very important figure in serbian history and culture is [ lazar hrebeljanovi\u0107 of serbia ], 
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lazar_of_serbia ) . 
  he led the serbian army during the [ battle of kosovo ( 1389 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_kosovo ) , in which he and the opposing ottoman sultan were killed . 
  not sure if this is just coincidental though . 
  ** hiko : ** '' - change your picture ingame to the liquid ( hiko 's pro team ) logo , and then you 'll be good players . '', 
  * nose scratch & sniff *, 
  ** teammate : ** `` no , then we 'll choke '',

  it 's been a year or so since i watched pro cs but iirc liquid was notorious for choking . 
  ** r5 : ** mamluks in a coaltion against ayutthaya . 
  the mamluks actually spawned colonialism to my surprise . 
  so yeah , they have like 6-7 provinces in the east indies . 
  how come there are two veneti ? 
  the stand-alone ones on the right edge of the map , and the ones in brittany ? 
  very interesting thanks !, 
  thank you . 
  very nice map by the way !, 
  there 's no escape, 
  i do n't think i will ever forget this man . 
  such fearlessness in the face of death . 
  absolutely disgusting .

  i guess this battle would be interesting to watch :d, 
  basically , my dad used to be a pretty bad alcoholic . 
  we managed to tone down his `` alcoholiciness ? '', 
  quite a bit , then he turned to smoking . 
  he smokes so much it 's unbelievable , so much money down the drain , when his horrible habit dies so does our financial problems . 
  should probably include as well , he was such an alcoholic me and my family ( excluding him ) would go out somewhere , maybe movies ( when i was a kid ) . 
  come home to find him passed out on the couch and floor sometimes from all the vodka he had . 
  like , there was n't even a reason to get drunk , he was home by himself !, 
  do n't get me wrong though , i love my dad and would hate for anything to happen to him , which leads me to my original question ? 
  has anyone on askreddit convinced a heavy smoker to quit ? 
  if so how did you do it ? 
  i can see his health has already deteriorated and we 've talked to him to try get him to stop ( which he would [ for like 3 hours ] ) and i do n't want him to keep destroying himself like he is . 
  - this is possibly in the wrong subreddit , if it is , i apologize from the bottom of my heart . 
  so here i am , playing the old age of mythology , when suddenly i realise my bot team mate ( red ) keeps sending his villagers into hostile villages and getting them killed , i scout the hostile village and notice they are trying to build a market . 
  but get killed before they can build it . 
  then they build another market x 14 . 
  it 's a question that 's been bugging me for some time ... what happened to the internet in the world of twd . 
  depending on how many survivors were left in a given area it could 've become a very helpful tool . 
  to communicate with other survivors , to find out if they have a safer base or where to meet up with them . 
  but then again , the internet needs maintenance if i 'm not mistaken . 
  and i guess they 're playing along with the idea that it 's been shut down .
