  mine is when shane chokeholds daryl . 
  shane : then file a complaint . 
  i do n't know why i like it so much xd, 
  i 've felt the urge to try my hand at woodworking recently , and was looking for a minor project i could create . 
  i have a large empty backyard so i was thinking something of an outdoor project to create . 
  i could get help from my father who has some woodworking experience and my grandfather who has extensive experience . 
  this is a map that me and my friend ( flynn26 ) were making halfway through last year however we discarded it due to schooling and exam block . 
  lately i 've been getting the urge to continue it again . 
  the map is meant to be played on an honour system ( i.e , pay for stuff in shops using gold ingots you found hidden in the map , or you can just loot it ) . 
  it 's about half way done and in my opinion i think it looks awesome , but that 's probably just bias talking . 
  tell me what you think .

  edit : i seem to have messed up the link to the images , i 'll get right on it . 
  edit 2 : sorry about the large amount of images , i 'd link the album but i am unable to find it . 
  yes , i know ... how stupid of me ... 
  so i downloaded the ps2 emulator ( pcsx2 ) , to play kingdom hearts . 
  then i had the great idea to connect my ps3 controller to the pc and play away . 
  unfortunately it 's not that easy . 
  i found a tutorial for it which involved downloading libusb . 
  then installing a driver for the controller , needless to say it fucked my usb ports up as in the computer does n't recognize anything at all . 
  but that 's okay , because the solution to this is to use your ps3 controller you set up to uninstall libusb and it will be fixed . 
  unfortunately it does n't recognize my controller either . 
  so i need your help reddit , is there any way i can fix this ? 
  edit : the keyboard/mouse work on startup ( start windows in safe mode etc. . . ) , but as soon as i enter windows it stops working ... :(, 
  whenever i try to write the word `` five '' , it always comes out as `` 5ive '' . 
  is this just me or ... ? 
  edit : probably better to say write instead of spell . 
  my most useful is the elastico , not the chop . 
  i have an issue where i will always kick the ball out too far after the second touch but the gunshot change of directions confuses defenders and allows you to get past them quickly . 
  another one that i find quite useful is the roulette , bonus points if you get a panna . 
  the great thing about the roullete is you can act as a shield to block opponents from the ball while you are spinning . 
  anyway , while i 'm here i would like to link you to some youtube videos that can help you quickly learn tricks in a short amount of time , step-by-step . 
  [ strskillschool ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hl5pzeij8 ), 
  my title likely does n't make sense so i 'll try and explain it better down here . 
  have people always laughed like how we laugh today ? 
  the traditional hahahaha ( i guess that 's how you describe it ? ), 
  the question came to me yesterday at work when i was talking with a customer that had a complete different cultural background ( pretty much looked like he came straight from a tribe ) , could n't speak much english and was using mostly hand gestures to describe things to me . 
  and when he laughed it just struck me how amazing it is that this simple act can unite different people together and is understood amongst all cultures . 
  so i was wondering if laughing ever meant anything different or was performed in a different way . 
  sorry if my question seems a bit illiterate : /, 
  i 'd love to see a game during ramesses ii 's reign ( or any pharoah for that matter ) . 
  imagine you are ramesses ii and you have to oversee your land , people and slaves . 
  command the slaves to build temples then eventually you have to build up an army and go to war with neighboring tribes/civilizations . 
  i think this would be amazing :d, 
  edit : or maybe you could start of as a peasant or farmer and eventually be noticed by the current pharoah ( or someone else who holds some regard in nobility ) , for maybe , let 's say defending the pharaoh from an assassin or something else . 
  the first couple of days could start out normally in the life of a farmer/peasant . 
  then interesting things begin to happen later on . 
  does anyone else have any ideas ? 
  welp , i 've searched far and wide but i have not had much luck finding any decent books that chronicles history in serbia . 
  i checked [ this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/timi4/the_askhistorians_master_book_list/ ) and still no luck . 
  the time period i 'm hoping for would be anywhere inbetween prehistory - 1900ad serbia . 
  to broaden the search criteria a bit , i guess it could also be a book about the general balkans area . 
  edit : i understand this might be a difficult task so i will not be disappointed if it ends fruitlessly , 
  so a couple days ago , i pirated shogun 2 ( downvote if you must ) . 
  enjoyed it immensely . 
  bought it from steam today as i wished to play with a friend in co-op . 
  and nearly an hour an a half later it 's only downloaded 12 % . 
  i am aware this is probably average as shogun 2 is a huge game . 
  however are there any files i could copy from the pirated installation to the legit installation which could improve download speed . 
  or will it most likely stuff it up . 
  thanks in advance warlords . 
  i saw a thread on the total war [ forums ] ( http://forums.totalwar.com/ ) which asked this same question . 
  anyway , i was looking to bring this question to the reddit total war community . 
  so , tell us , what is the best pre-battle speech you can come up with ? 
  edit : i 'm led to believe that pre-battle speeches will be replaced by cinematics instead . 
  i guess you can try making up a cinematic as well . 
  i was just re-watching the final battle on the last samurai , and noticed katsumoto using two swords . 
  one thought led to another and eventually i realised none of them used shields ? 
  why , would you think their battle prowess would be disadvantaged by this change ? 
  thanks in advance !, 
  i 'm playing darthmod on shogun 2 . 
  i 'm playing tokugawa , and i 'm a vassal of oda . 
  not going to sugar coat it , they are getting royally fucked up by the ikko-ikki . 
  and they 've gone through like 8 daimyo 's in like 10 turns . 
  i 've been defending owari with my daimyo and his men , i like the oda . 
  so , can i send them money that they will use to field armies ? 
  thanks in advance !, 
  i remember my geography teacher vaguely telling us about how some african countries would probably cease to exist in a couple of years/decades , due to aids and various other diseases . 
  my question is , what happened to that land ? 
  say chad dies out ( not implying anything , just picked a random country ) , who will then have rights to the land ? 
  sorry if this question seems unintelligible , i will elaborate if need be . 
  i was n't sure which subreddit to post this to , if i am in the wrong , being directed to correct one would be very much appreciated . 
  - thanks in advance . 
  i 've tried wikipedia and it was rather vague . 
  but it was also the best i could find . 
  specifically looking for foreign relations of serbia/japan . 
  thanks in advance . 
  in previous dynasty warriors games , you always had the option to pick a character from wu/wei/shu / other . 
  and they 'd have their own story . 
  now , i believe , that dw7 only has story mode for each individual kingdom ?
