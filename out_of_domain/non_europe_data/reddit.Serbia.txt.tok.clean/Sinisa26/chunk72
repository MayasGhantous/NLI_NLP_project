  how does this work out ? 
  how long does each story mode last . 
  and in battles where many story mode characters take part ( zhao yun , liu bei , guan yu , zhang fei etc. . . ) , do you get who to pick ? 
  for example , if i choose shu , do i only get to play as liu bei in yellow turban rebellion ? 
  - date sanemoto - brother, 
  - date yoshinori - youngest brother, 
  ** -- prologue -- **, 
  on my conquest to unify japan i came across the satake , who would not listen to reason and would not accept any kind of alliance or trade agreement . 
  they began amassing an army right outside my province of fukushima which could only mean one thing , it was time for war . 
  as my brother yoshinori had just come of age , i entrusted him with a few units of melee and cavalry . 
  i ordered him to go around the satake main force and take their undefended provinces while harumune and sanemoto dealt with the main satake army . 
  but , just when i was ready to go to battle . 
  the satake army retreated to defend their province being attacked by yoshinori . 
  i sent my main force to assist him and on the way split up with sanemoto so him and his small band of troops could go take another undefended satake residence . 
  harumune arrived just in time to save his younger brother from a painful death and drove back the might satake force . 
  with sanemoto conquering one province , and harumune-yoshinori conquering their last . 
  the satake army were essentially finished . 
  but just as the split date army began celebrating , a mighty satomi force appeared on the horizon with the intention of finishing the date while they were weak . 
  sanemoto , upon hearing news of the oncoming battle , rushed to be at his brothers side . 
  ** -- battle -- **, 
  `` bishamonten the war god has awoken . '', 
  the combined date army took residence in the battered ruins of the old satake castle . 
  the once mighty army only consisted of a few bow ashigaru , 1 naginata samurai , 3 yari ashigaru , 1 samurai retainer , 1 light cavalry and 3 generals ( harumune , sanemoto and yoshinori ) . 
  in total , the army had around 300 poorly trained and tired men to it 's command . 
  meanwhile , the satomi horde despatched 600 battle ready samurai . 
  the satomi approached the castle from 5 different directions . 
  there was a force of 3 bow samurai approaching from the east . 
  3 katana samurai approaching from the west . 
  1 bow samurai and 2 yari samurai approaching from the north east . 
  4 yari samurai , 1 bow samurai and 3 generals approaching from the south . 
  and finally , 3 light cavalry approaching from the south east . 
  i sent my main melee force ( numbering about 100 men ) , to deal with the armies approaching from the west/north-west . 
  meanwhile , my archers , light cavalry and generals would deal with the main army at the south . 
  after many gruesome minutes of battle , the melee force had driven back the army they were fighting , but were extremely battered ( 2 yari ashigaru [ troops , not units ] and 12 naginata samurai were all that was left of the melee force ) . 
  meanwhile 1 enemy general had dismounted and was climbing the walls , alongside him was the main satomi melee force . 
  it was time for my generals swords to finally taste blood . 
  i pulled my archers back to deal with an annoying bow samurai army while my 3 generals attacked the main satomi melee force . 
  thus phase 2 of the battle begins . 
  after my 3 generals get pushed back my leftover melee force finally arrive which help to put an end to the main melee force . 
  finally the leftovers of the satomi force charge at the castle in a desperate attack to conquer my weakened army . 
  i had only 4 battered bow ashigaru remaining , 3 extremely battered generals remaining , and a 4 or so naginata samurai . 
  all in all , my army totalled around 60 or so odd men . 
  meanwhile , the satomi force still had 2 generals and 4 healthy bow samurai who were charging the walls . 
  i huddled together my weakened army to fight together to the death . 
  as the bow samurai finally reached the tops of the walls i sent my bow ashigaru and naginata samurai to deal with them while my generals fight their generals . 
  a bloody battle ensued . 
  3 brothers battling out the final moments of their lives together . 
  my bow ashigaru were quickly beaten back but my naginata samurai were still going strong with around 200 kills to their name . 
  but just as victory seems to be heading my way , harumune is killed in the heat of battle . 
  yoshinori , enraged at his brothers death , charges back into battle and is promptly slain by a lowly ashigaru bannerman . 
  sanemoto , grief stricken by the death of his two brothers , rouses the remaining army for a final push to destroy the villainous scum . 
  satomi yoshitaka , seeing that victory is impossible against the might sanemoto , orders a full retreat . 
  victory is ours , but at what cost ? 
  sanemoto , intent on destroying yoshitaka , quickly gathers a small army to finish the satomi once and for all . 
  his melee deal with satomi 's melee easily , his bowmen deal with satomi 's bowmen easily . 
  and sanemoto himself seeks yoshitaka 's head . 
  after a minor scuffle , yoshitaka is dead , alas , not by sanemoto 's blade . 
  with the main satomi force destroyed , the economy of the satomi clan crumbles and sanemoto promptly conquers the remaining satomi provinces . 
  sanemoto , with the death of his brother 's in the back of his mind , vows to follow and defend his nephew , terumune ( harumune 's son and heir ) , on his conquest to finally see japan unified .

  thank you for listening to my , probably , incredibly boring post about this amazing battle i experienced . 
  here 's to many more !, 
  i mean if the enemy has a unit of 100 + yari ashigaru charging on a map ( similar to rice fields ) , directly at my archers ( 60 + ) , i should surely get more than 1 kill . 
  right ? 
  this is happening way too often and frankly , i feel like it kind of detracts from the almighty darthmod . 
  edit : for shogun 2 , just in case you did n't get that from the yari ashigaru part . 
  so far , i believe that it is only compatible with celtic factions . 
  i personally have n't downloaded it as i am in the middle of a parthia campaign , however , i thought most of you guys would like to take a look at this since it seems like a large portion of this subreddit despise the current cards . 
  hey guys , i was wondering if anyone has come across this error personally . 
  i 'm a big fan of taking screenshots but for some reason f12 does n't work anymore while in rome ii .
