  the last yari ashigaru , would not take an arrow . 
  literally , 150 went through him . 
  so i sent every archer to lob some arrows at him . 
  he literally turned into a porcupine . 
   honda commanded a rank of musketeers as the combined oda-tokugawa forces annihilated takeda katsuyori 's army , partly thanks to the skillful use of ranked muskets , as they fired in cycling volleys . 
  one would fire while another was reloading and another was cleaning the barrel of the musket . 
  this enabled the muskets to fire without stopping , destroying the takeda army . 
  this was the first example of this highly effective tactic that the world had seen . 
  haha i am serbian . 
  i 'm glad someone onside on reddit appreciates my country !, 
  this is powerful . 
  hojo clan 's mon was a [ triforce ] ( http://www.totalwars.ru/encyclopedia/content_images/clans/hojo/mon_256.png ), 
  cause of [ death ... ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-qf6cbjo2vy/sjd2l4zfahi/aaaaaaaafti/78fp5vkde24/s400/samurai%2barmor%2b2.jpg ), 
  japan was so beautiful before it got modernised . 
  i wish the world could just suddenly forget how to operate nukes and guns . 
  and we had to revert back to swords and spears ... :(, 
  depends what sword , they had many different kinds . 
  but i doubt any techniques are lost . 
  maybe the material or craftsmanship , but not the knowledge . 
  i know , i 'm aware of major issues like that . 
  and many of our current technologies , the things that everyone is used to , rely on similar technologies as guns , bombs and nukes i 'd imagine . 
  but i just prefer medieval warfare to modern . 
  just something about getting close to your enemy , having your leader there on the battlefield as well ( not fighting , but they were usually present ) . 
  i mean , back then , you could see an arrow coming , have time to move out of the way and save yourself . 
  now , you wo n't even notice a nuke and next minute half your country is dead . 
  it just seems so pointless , that a whole war can end with the click of a button . 
  but that 's just me . 
  when people think that samurai were just brainless idiots who charged headlong into the enemy willy-nilly . 
  yes definitely , i 'd imagine that only a few know the technique . 
  as carrying weapons was pretty much abolished there was n't a need to make swords any more , and from what i 've learned on reddit , japan is a pretty resource deprived region . 
  this is definitely a good point , many times they pretty much had no other options , otherwise too many innocent people would lose their lives . 
   churchill asked gamelin when and where the general proposed to launch a counter attack against the flanks of the german bulge . 
  gamelin simply replied `` inferiority of numbers , inferiority of equipment , inferiority of methods '' . 
  add to that that they were exhausted by plenty of previous wars . 
  glad my dad managed to quit smoking before these came out . 
  now he 'll never go back ( hopefully ) . 
  i never meant it in that aspect . 
  i guess what i 'm trying to say is , i 'd rather die by sword than some horrible bomb , launched by some guy , probably on the other side of the world , which destroys your whole country . 
  this is the basic theory that i 've been keeping to as well . 
  to show that you are n't hiding a weapon .

   archaeological ruins and ancient texts show that handshaking was practiced in ancient greece  as far back as the 5th century bc .

  you might have to manually find it from the disambiguation page as the ( cloak ) part is ruining the link . 
  nope , i did n't even think of india , only when i read your comment did i think of india . 
  why me ? 
  am i the chosen one ?

  1/25 facebook posts on front page for me .

  wait , does n't the game end at 1600 ? 
  i 've never gotten that far so i would n't know ... 
  let there be light !!, 
  how long , theoretically ? 
  has anyone ever played past the year 1700 ? 
  what pool is it ? 
  seen it so many times , still trying to figure out how the fuck the gun is standing upright like that ?!?!? 
  god dammit , signed in to comment and tell him they are making a movie . 
  and you beat me by 36 seconds . 
  what the shit :(, 
  this kills the man ... 
  but , in all honesty , what the fuck was that cop thinking , we 're they ever taught maneuver , behead them with the riot shield ? 
  what , how , when / !, 
  since when do allies ever do anything useful ? 
  are there any mods to make allies , you know , like , allies ? 
  it 'd make the game so much more fun . 
  jesus , that was a thorough answer , really was n't expecting that . 
  thank you though , that answers pretty much everything , just one more question , what happens to the `` other '' characters ( meng huo , yuan shao , lu bu etc. . ) , do they have stories ? 
  i 'm really looking forward to this game .
