  i think your friend is struggling with the concept of anonymity . 
  fyi this was the flag of the short lived [ republic of bosnia and herzegovina ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_bosnia_and_herzegovina ) 1992-1997 . 
  afterwards , as the war ended and the dayton agreement was signed [ bosnia and herzegovina ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bosnia_and_herzegovina ) ( [ flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/flag_of_bosnia_and_herzegovina.svg/800px-flag_of_bosnia_and_herzegovina.svg.png ) ) was created , which is comprised of two `` entities '' : [ the republic of srpska ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republika_srpska ) ( [ flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/flag_of_republika_srpska.svg/900px-flag_of_republika_srpska.svg.png ) ) and the [ federation of bosnia and herzegovina ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federation_of_bosnia_and_herzegovina ) ( no official flag ) . 
  it was used by the army of bosnia and herzegovina , which was 99 % muslim during the bosnian civil war . 
  today the situation is that mostly muslims play for bosnia ( there are exceptions nowadays , of course ) while bosnian serbs and croats mostly choose to play for serbia or croatia . 
  the fan base of the bosnian national team has a similar ethnic base . 
  why are you asking me that . 
  it was not my decision . 
  honestly i did n't even see the flag . 
  i just knew there was some hold-up and that they have problems adopting one . 
  no idea why this happened . 
  oh man , that conflict can not be explained easily . 
  try with the wiki page : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bosnian_war, 
  on the other hand bbc has a half-decent documentary about the break-up of yugoslavia . 
  it is called `` the death of yugoslavia '' , and it 's on youtube :, 
  i used to collect beer bottles , but it started taking up too much space , also i moved around quite a lot in recent years , so now i just collect beer bottle caps . 
  still i have a few hundred bottles at my parents house , among them a few that are 100 + years old . 
  when i finally settle down i will make a nice display . 
  yes . 
  do n't they degrade at some point ? 
  the whole japan-lovin ' thing going on . 
  i know a bunch of people obsessed with japanese culture , and i just do n't get the appeal . 
  every time i hear a `` fun fact '' about japan i just go `` mmmkay , japan 's weird '' . 
  it might be interesting but absolutely not appealing to me . 
  to je to . 
  / r/socialism, 
  kako je to pravedno ? 
  je li to pravedno ? 
  grani\u010dni prelaz brankov most . 
  yep !, 
  really ? 
  do you have some read on this topic ? 
  i find this really interesting . 
  keva : e , sad sam videla supermarket , da kupimo leba , sira , salame , pa pojedemo u kolima . 
  ja : * facepalm *, 
   what 's your take on croatia ? 
  still hard feelings ? 
  croatia - our evil twin . 
  jk i have no hard feelings , i have quite a few croatian friends , actually . 
   culture and religion ( catholic versus orthodox versus muslim ) are often heavily influenced by whatever foreign oppressor a place had ? 
  ( ie ottomans versus austria-hungary ), 
  absolutely , as someone already said - this is the source of the vojvodina - rest of serbia division to this very day . 
   have any of you worked abroad ? 
  if you did , did you go back or do you dream of going back to serbia more permanently ? 
  currently doing a phd in germany , and ** nope ** . 
   are there any austrian foods you like ? 
  i spent 2 days in austria in my entire life so i 'm not sure . 
  if it is similar to bavarian food then yes , quite probably . 
  edit : ah , yes , wiener schnitzel , of course yes !, 
  baltic and slavic languages are more closely related than german-slavic , they form the so-called balto-slavic group , so the language barrier might not have been so great a couple of thousand years ago . 
  the hungarians arrived to europe much later , in the 9th century . 
  as for the romanians , who knows ... 
   with an american passport to me is just . . insanity . 
  what does your american passport have to do with anything ? 
  serbia does not recognize kosovo nor the kosovo authorities , so according to serbian law when you arrive to the administrative border you are within serbia , but you do not have a stamp in your passport from serbian authorities that you ever entered . 
  it does not matter what passport you have at all . 
  so you have entered serbia , and not exited since then , and then went to kosovo and now you want to come back ? 
  you are ok then actually . 
  if you crossed the border and had not left the country ( and kosovo included , legally ) you can do whatever you want . 
  edit : or do you mean they should stamp your passport when you exit kosovo ? 
  they will not give you a stamp because that would mean that the crossing between kosovo and central serbia is a border , which serbia legally does not recognize as such . 
  a lot of things are unreasonable about the whole situation in kosovo , this is not even in the top 10 . 
  just a word of friendly advice : do n't pull your citizenship/passport as an argument in serbia , it will not bring you any sympathies , and possibly even the opposite . 
  ftfy, 
  big capital is manufacturing conflicts in the world.media owned by the same company in the two countries feed different and often conflicting/contradictory propaganda to the people . 
  `` a thing locator '' . 
  from keys to socks . 
  ftfy, 
  good moaning !, 
  i think russian was far more prominent . 
  the generation of my parents did not learn english at all . 
  there are some heavy things here , but this one really made me go : ** what.the.actual.fuck ? 
  ** do you know what happened to them ? 
  did they get sentenced and how much ? 
  the question is not slovenia , but yugoslavia . 
  i do n't know how things were in slovenia , but i know how they were in serbia , montenegro , etc. 
  a lot of people were learning russian . 
  german and french too , but a lot of russian . 
   slovenia did n't learn russian at all . 
  i doubt other countries did . 
  they did . 
  he probably means as a second language . 
  of course they learned serbo-croatian . 
  i know the politics of yugoslavia , no need to repeat it . 
  i know what is the language in slovenia . 
  i wrote a lot of people learn ** ed ** russian in serbia and it was in general very normal , ok maybe not `` much more prominent '' for all of yugoslavia as i wrote , buit quite prominent . 
  the question is about yugoslavia , all of it . 
  you can not deduce that from the example of slovenia . 
  and you wrote that `` you doubt that in other countries learn ** ed ** russian '' , and i am telling you they did . 
  that does not negate what i am saying . 
  ok , they learned german in slovenia , but the question was for yugoslavia , the title mentioned serbia specifically . 
  i am from serbia and i know that the generation of my parents learned russian . 
  but , now some people here are trying to convince me they did n't o. 0 . 
  once again : i understand , in slovenia you did n't learn russian . 
  that does not negate what i am saying at all : a lot of people in yugoslavia were learning russian . 
  that is not necessarilly connected to the iron curtain . 
  yu was not in the wester bloc either yet people learned french or german ... 
  i am sure that in serbia and montenegro russian was widely studied , and ia friend 's parents from macedonia learned russian too . 
  i do n't know about every corner of the former country obviously , but it was not some small minority .
