  but how come this does n't happen in europe ? 
  in many countries the president is directly electred , while the prime minister is chosen the way you described . 
  who of the two is more influencial depends on if the country is a parliamentary or presidential republic . 
  but no european country has such a strictly 2-party system ( to my knowledge ) , regardless of the political system in place . 
  yes , the elections go like you described in every system i am familiar with . 
   i do n't understand how in ops post bc can team up and they percentages sum up . 
  i think that meant a party supports another candidate if they can not win . 
  but that rarely happens in europe in such drastic proportions that there are only 2 people . 
  and its not only about 2 people for president but only 2 parties . 
  that is the part i do n't get , how come this explanation works for the us , but not for germany , spain or holland . 
  i remember the last time i voted for president there were around 10 candidates . 
  now only 2-3 where serious contenders according to the polls , but still ... 
  you vote for congress too . 
  this does not explain why you have only 2 parties in the congress . 
  and the us has a 2 party system for a long time , and european democracies have not collapsed to a 2 party system in the same amount of time the american did . 
  presidential and parliamentary are often separate in europe as well . 
  yes , there are often cases that 2 parties ( or even just one ) stand out , but usually this generally does n't last for more than half a century . 
  not really , the guys who are the 2-3 candidates do n't come for 2 of the same parties for decades or more . 
  of course it is difficult to speak for all of the european countries , but to my best knowledge this is generally true . 
   my point is not that our system is as good as yours, 
  i was n't trying to rate the political systems , just pointing out differences and trying to understand where they come from .

   fossil fuels still meet more than 80 % of global primary energy demands , and 90 % of all energy related co2-emissions are the result of fossil fuel combustion . 
  ( energy and climate change , iea ), 
   in order to tackle the ongoing climate change un-member countries have put forward the paris agreement , which aims to limit global warming to a maximum of 2 \u00b0 c. 
  this means that industrialized countries must reduce their ghg emissions by 80-95 % by 2050 , compared to 1990 , which entails a serious cutback in fossil-fuel consumption . 
  ( energy technology perspectives 2015 , international energy agency , iea/oecd , iea publications , paris , ), 
   the fact that fossil fuels will not be able to meet the energy demands at some point in the future is not an `` if '' , but a `` when '' . 
  some estimates project this could happen as soon as ca 2030, 
  ( j. o. 'm . 
  bockris , international journal of hydrogen energy , 2002 , 27 , 731-740 . ), 
   an estimated 1.2 billion people ( 17 % of the world population ) live without electricity , while 2.7 billion ( 38 % of the population ) rely on the use of biomass for heat provision and thermal treatment of food .
