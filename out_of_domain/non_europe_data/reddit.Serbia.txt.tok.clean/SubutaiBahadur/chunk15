  i 'm a star wars geek , whatchagonnado ... 
  bavaria , germany . 
  8km by bike whenever the weather lets me . 
  i love biking and doing 16km a day is some nice cardio . 
  `` see you later '' . 
  we basically run into each other in the hallway all the time , yet every time exiting the office : `` ok , see you later '' . 
  five times a day from dozens of different people . 
  i kornja\u010de su osobe . 
  pravda za kornja\u010de !, 
  checking in . 
  no frx, 
  no frx = bez frke . 
  ja sam za to da se u najmanju ruku nazna\u010di izvorni na\u010din pisanja u zagradi kada se prvi put pomene strano ime . 
  if you are going to advertise your band , you should learn how to write the name of the city . 
  \u0160ok . 
  it 's a cool band . 
  that 's all you need to know . 
  knowing the name of the city is `` being technical '' ? 
  gather ` round comrades !,

  russia can lose a lot here . 
  on one hand azerbaijan has money from oil and invests a lot in military - they buy a lot of stuff from russia . 
  on the other , they have a military treaty with armenia . 
  if they intervene to protect armenia - they lose azerbaijan completely , and quite probably to even stronger turkish influence . 
  this would additionally complicate the already complex situation in the caucasus . 
  if they do n't - that sends the message to the remaining russian allies that russia is not strong enough to protect them . 
  it is not surprising putin immediately called for the cease of hostilities . 
  edit : spelling, 
  i think `` muscle flexing '' is too naive a goal . 
  the relations with armenia and azerbaijan are important for russia . 
  there are serious interests in controlling the caucasus , that would n't be risked because of something so petty . 
   why i should give one more $ & @ $ about foreign tribes ? 
  every tribe is a foreign tribe somewhere . 
  yes , that is true . 
  however , russia does not have forces in place that could seriously intervene in azerbaijan ( as in occupy , or overthrow the government ) , so i doubt it was they initiated this to remove azerbaijan from the equation . 
  but we will see how the situation develops ... 
  yes , but azerbaijan is no group of rebels . 
  they have a legit airforce and anti-aircaraft systems ( russian-made actually ) . 
  intervening seriously against the azeris would be a much , much more serious operation . 
  socialists were mostly gone from positions of power . 
  the republics themselves elected nationalist leaders in the late 1980s . 
  there was no socialist military or anything of the sort . 
  while your answer may describe some particular individuals , in no way is it accurate to describe the whole situation . 
  samo mali problem je izvodljivost . 
  ja sam za to da se radi na manama . 
   recimo plan je da se let u svemir totalno prebaci u privatni sektor, 
  i love it when people think science = making shit up, 
  tako je bilo od radija do interneta . 
  sounding smart to idiots on the internet is much easier than actually learning something . 
  coelho is wildly overrated imo . 
  read one of his books , you do n't need to read any more . 
  at least that was my impression . 
  bur\u017eoaska gamad , neemancipovani proletarijat i retrogradna reakcija . 
  probably the goal is to show that the mocking that goes in the other direction is ridiculous and unfair . 
  ti si bas optimista, 
  pick one . 
  `` there are some heavy things here , but this one really made me go : what.the.actual.fuck ?

  i remember once a guy teasing me about my height ( i am 175cm , not that short mind you ) , and i answered :, 
  `` i would rather by short than bald '' . 
  a little shocked he mumbled `` yeah , man , my dad lost his hair too , it 's genetic ... '', 
  `` well no shit , and i am not taller for not eating my spinach ... asshole . '',
