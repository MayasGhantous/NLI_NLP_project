  this ancient serbian icon is the first known depiction of the virgin mary from 1st century bc . 
  it was found in damascus ( yes syria was then a part of serbia ) . 
  as you can see it is in serbian cyrillic script . 
  and what is ridiculous ? 
  i have just talked to my friends from tetovo , bekim and fadil , and they have confirmed that the language in macedonia is almost the same as in albania , with some dialectical differences . 
  well did you notice in the bible there is nothing about the life of jesus until he is 30 and starts preaching ? 
  guess where he was ? 
  serbia !, 
  it was a center of education and scholarship at the time . 
  he preached in serbia before palestine , so it is bc !, 
  bulgarian cyrillic was made from serbian cyrillic in the 9th century , that is correct . 
  syria even sounds like serbia !, 
  i mean come on !!!!!!!!!!!!!!, 
  yes the name comes from cyril . 
  in serbian empire it was called srbica , or * scripta serbica * in latin . 
  cyril modified it for the bulgarian language and the bulgars called it cyrillic because it was the first time they learned to write . 
  byzantine and serbia invested a lot in making bulgars literate so they can herd cattle and trade better . 
  listen to some of the lectures of prof. jovan deretic if you are curious about bulgar history . 
  you learn old austro-hungarian and pseudo-bulgar propaganda . 
  listen to newest research from prof. jovan deretic about the turkic bulgar nomad tribes and their slavification by the serbian rulers : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfg0qkwyux0, 
  prof. jovan deretic is a leading expert on the balkans and the serbian empire , with special focus on early serbian transoceanic expeditions . 
  he is also about to publish a three volume book on the history of the seafaring serbian northern states ( falsely called vikings ) . 
  if you still doubt look at this depiction of achilles with clearly visible serbian symbols :, 
  gaze at the glory of one of the great heroes of the fourth serbian empire . 
  laugh all you want . 
  explain the picture if you can !, 
  the second i saw that short running distance and hurried run i cringed . 
  fun fact , a lot of the locals macedonians call it `` shkup '' . 
  i was surprised the local dialect is very similar to the dialect baklava makers speak in serbia . 
  i think it might be related . 
  yes the turkic nomadic tribes such as tatars and bulgars were always warrior tribes . 
  too bad they greeted the ottomans as liberators because their common origin and offered no resistance . 
  things could have been different . 
  \u0160ta je to ? 
  says the macedonian . 
  your nation was brought from india by alexander to inhabit the mountains of southern serbia , together with albanians from the caucasus . 
  macedonians are great people . 
  i made a lot of friends in thessaloniki last summer . 
  fyromians are a little annoying . 
  but there are exceptions , like my friends bekim , fadil , adem ... 
  well this looks equally horrible from every angle . 
  no , from tetov\u00eb , in the buffer zone . 
  marketing . 
  dude , ivo22 is ` special ' , i do n't have the energy to troll another dude for several days . 
  the guy is hysterical , i only messed with him because intelligent discussion was impossible . 
  in all seriousness i know how modern bulgarians came to be . 
  hungarians are not turkic though . 
  not the modern , and not the ancient ones . 
  hungarians are and were uralic , i.e. , fennougric . 
  there were certain turkic tribes allied with hungarians , like the cumans and yazigs , or but they were not hungarians ( magyars ) , but were assimilated with time . 
  just like a lot of local slavs were . 
  yes i did . 
   that 's like calling the hungarians turkic . 
  the magyars formed a much larger percentage of the hungarian population than the bulgars did the bulgarian population . 
  you know `` magyars '' and `` hungarians '' are synonyms right ? 
  the former is an endonym ( what hungarians call themselves ) and the latter an exonym ( what others , like english , call hungarians ) . 
  original bulgars were turkic , original magayrs , or hungarians , were not . 
  of course modern bulgarians are slavic regardless . 
  i just do n't get why are you making hungarians an example ... 
  that is not a scientifically accepted hypothesis . 
  hungarians are uralic , and in the finno-ugric group . 
  they relatedness to turkic nations is pure speculation . 
  we did n't disagree . 
  i tried reasoning with him . 
  saw it did n't work . 
  then i just trolled him for like 15 comments cause i saw he was getting angry ,

  yep , i am from subotica/szabadka and it seems like at least the quarter of the province is romanian , while the truth is only southeast banat has historically had a significant romanian population . 
  1-50 % margin ? 
  ffs , that could be 2 % or 49 % . 
  how the hell is that the same ? 
  also 51 % and 99 % is not exactly an insignificant difference .
