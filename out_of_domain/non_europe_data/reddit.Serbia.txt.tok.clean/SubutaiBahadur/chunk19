  that 's red card territory imo, 
  ironically \u0106orluka is the one wearing a turban . 
  scroll , scroll ... 
  `` sultan mehmed ii wearing a turban . '', 
  `` suleiman i wearing a large turban . '', 
  `` selim ii wearing the ottoman imperial turban . '', 
  deal with it . 
  ne smeta mi to uop\u0161te , samo `` hollier than thou '' stav . 
  i thought it was putin, 
  how did you exactly pull off russia ? 
  piggybacking off this : which are the best hungraian sports pages in hungarian ? 
  da \u0161acujem bih se setio i sam . 
  ftfy, 
  trianon was unfair , but only to a degree . 
  austria-hungary was an empire in which a lot of people wished for independence . 
  a lot of the territories lost were not really inhabited by hungarians or in fact people who would be loyal citizens , especially to an independent hungarian state . 
  for instance one can maybe question why did horgos/horgo \u0161 or zenta/senta end up in yugoslavia/serbia , but ujvid\u00e9k / novi sad or pancsova/pan \u010devo ... not really , it actually makes sense . 
  yes , direct translation . 
  she is the daughter of a serbian `` controversial businessman '' suspected with various malversations . 
  while he awaits to stand trial he buys some small gifts of attention for her . 
   probably the only original serbian dish is popara . 
  depends what do you mean by `` original '' . 
  for instance \u0107evapi and burek are maybe inspired by and/or named after kebab and b\u00f6rek but are definitely different dishes . 
  proja is afaik also serbian . 
  how is that harsh ? 
  someone would want to be longer under the ottomans ? 
  yeah , i mean there is no doubt what is considered serbian food is heavily influenced by the turkish and middle eastern ( \u0107evap , burek , baklava , \u0111uve\u010d ... ) , and to a lesser degree hungarian ( gula\u0161 , paprika\u0161 , perkelt ) and austrian cuisine ( \u0161trudle , kiflice , \u0161nenokle ... ) particularly in the north . 
  but e.g. 
  germans do not have some amazingly developed dishes ( apart from sausages , sauerkraut , and strudel ) , and the cuisine is heavily influenced by the immigration ( d\u00f6nner , currywurst , all kinds of pastas , etc. ), 
  yet there are definitely things you could consider typically german , even if they are influenced/modified from somewhere else .

  najavljen novi referendum ... 
  ipak , [ zna\u010di podr\u0161ka ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/hungary/comments/4pevav/we_austrians_right_now/ ), 
  some historians argue that the battle of kosovo was already a desperate effort , and that the battle of marica was the big loss that turned the tide . 
  nemo ' sad da se vadi\u0161 ... 
  ono ... ne . 
  regarding immersion and `` feeling '' the city , depends what you want . 
  i would definitely set a day asside to go to ada ciganlija if the weather is nice ( if you like it , even more ) , and a whole day to kind of just hang around the center and the kalemegdan fortress to explore . 
  definitely check out skadarlija some night . 
  belgrade has much less tourists than budapest , so that should actually work in your favor in this case , because the locals are generally less `` tired '' of them and more `` curious '' about visitors . 
  budapest is flooded this time of year so the locals are much more apathetic . 
  ~ ~ i do n't know if that has changed , i left belgrade quite a few years ago , but there were no day - or week-tickets , which sucks for tourists ( the first sentence in the previous paragraph explains this too ) so you will probably need to pay on a ride-by-ride basis . ~ ~, 
  otherwise there are plenty of nice places to go at night and you should n't have a problem meeting some locals . 
  edit : strikethrough, 
  yeah , that 's what i was saying . 
  so they have introduced it finally . 
  when did it start ? 
  yeah possible , i moved from belgrade just some months before that system . 
  i was back a couple of times visiting but always for quite short time ( and getting shitfaced in the evening , of course ) so i never needed more than a couple of rides . 
  oh , how sweet . 
  well that escalated quickly .

  i like to annoy nationalists . 
   alright then , just be a jerk advertising and glorifying, 
  will do . 
   an oppressive regime that killed and enslaved hundreds of thousands of innocent people . 
  nope . 
  let me guess ... they fled around 1944 ? 
   just down vote my previous comments, 
  sure will . 
   it 's like displaying a nazi flag ,, 
  it 's nice , historic , and it gives balkan nationalists seizures . 
  dude , i do n't know what you fascist family ( yeah , mostly those were the ones running from sfry , i am only wondering which kind of collaborationsts were they ) taught you , but that is an outragous statment . 
  better keep your nose in your american ( i assume ) politics and not comment on stuff you know nothing about . 
  you have your own little fuhrer to worry about . 
  would you mind sharing where did they have to escape from and when ? 
  also , yeah , miraculously * nobody * was fascist by 1945 . 
   everyone who lived through it hated it . 
  maybe in the sssr , but this is not even remotely true for yugoslavia . 
  i have a family od mixed ethnicities and i can tell you many of them are nostalgic for `` the old times '' , particularly the ones old enough to remember them . 
  either you are or she was lying . 
  i see you do n't know a lot of things , it 's surprising you allow yourself so many conclusions regarding this . 
   i 'm referring to the mandatory work that the people had to do and could n't say no to , and got paid very little for . 
  oh , now comes the part when the murican with a distant connection to the country will explain the * real history * to the guy born and raised in that country . 
  very good . 
   if you were assigned a job , you had to accept , or be considered a subversive element , which means death . 
  this is just historically not true . 
  uhm , no , dude ... you provide a source . 
  how do i prove a negative ? 
  you made the claim , not me , and what is claimed without evidence can be dismissed without evidence . 
   what do you think communism is ? 
  titoism or otherwise , it still works like that . 
  this right here speaks of a sea of ignorance . 
  there was a huge difference between e.g. 
  stalin and tito style communism . 
  read about it . 
  how do you incorporate it into your daily life please ? 
  do you speak the language ? 
  how much time did you spend here ? 
  do you read about history ?
