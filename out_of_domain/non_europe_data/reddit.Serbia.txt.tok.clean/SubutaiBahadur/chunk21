  the death of ogedei khan posponed the mongolian invasion of europe at a moment where both the hungarian and polish armies were basically defeated and russia was in ruins . 
  the army returned for the kurultai to elect a new khan , but they never returned to conquer europe . 
  anyway the mongol invasion weakened the kingdom of hungary sufficiently that it could not recover until the ottoman invasions , and fell relatively quickly . 
  graduate student in physics :, 
  - physicists and scientists of all kind generally spend much more time behind a computer then in labs in white labcoats . 
  - people are not geeks and `` the big bang theory '' is a horrible stereotypical depiction of the profession . 
  there are plenty of scientists who do sports ( yes , even extreme ones ) , music or art in general , travel , etc. 
  no , generally we are not super into superheroes and or sci-fi . 
  perhaps we like sci-fi more than the general population , but it is not a rule . 
  - we generally do not play loads of video games . 
  again , the guys in bbt have so much goddamn free time that none of them could be a scientist while reading so much comic books , watching all those movies , and playing games . 
  we generally do not have time for that . 
  - the lifestyle in academia can be very demanding . 
  it requires moving frequently , often from country to country . 
  also a lot of traveling . 
  the stereotype of the tenured professor sitting in his comfy chair in his cluttered office is an exception , not a rule . 
  - being a scientist does not mean one is an expert in everything , e.g. , a physicist may know very little about biology . 
  while a single scientist in a movie can do anything from making a nuclear bomb to cloning humans , we are actually highly specialized .

   going to russia , plot twist : to je nedodjija jebena, 
  to nije plot twist .

  `` anything is possible if you believe in yourself . '', 
  not just bullshit , but actually harmful to believe it . 
  no you are not talented for everything and you can not achieve anything you set your mind to . 
  find something you are good at and makes you happy , or at least you do n't hate doing and keep improving yourself . 
  nothing wrong with doing decent work and not becoming an astronaut , rapper , or professional football player . 
  no you will not be a rock star scientist who fights crime by night . 
  i still do n't get this conversation :, 
  a : do you mind moving a bit ? 
  b : yeah , sure . 
  should n't the answer be `` no '' , as in `` no , i do not mind '' ?

  no , you are not `` well versed in science '' now because you watched cosmos and read a few popular science books . 
  you need to actually know some math and shit . 
  incoming missile . 
  scary on its own , the actual experience does not make it better . 
  well obviously i was not hit by it directly , or i would not be typing this . 
  oh fuck ... those things still make me uneasy 17 years after hearing them . 
  not much to tell . 
  the city i was living in was bombed when i was 12 . 
  i could hear the hissing sound before explosions and it was terrifying . 
  perhaps you do n't hear it if it is going above mach1 and directly at you . 
  otherwise the soundwave spreads and you can clearly hear it even before it detonates . 
  nah , they were from missile from airplanes or cruise missiles . 
  i am from a town , not really city , called subotica in northern serbia . 
  it was bombed a few times in 1999 . 
  many others had it much worse . 
  belgrade was daily for 78 days .

  this is not even something amazing , it 's just plain stupid . 
  even if you can do it - you spent time memorizing something there is no point memorizing . 
  now , performing ab initio calculations is a different thing ... 
  is it ? 
  `` the brother of jared goes to america '' is also gold . 
  can you imagine reaching america in a pre-flight pre-transoceanic seafaring time starting from modern-day iraq ? 
  more impressive than parting the red sea .
