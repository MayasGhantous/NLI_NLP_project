  livada, 
  to mu je bilo drugi put . 
  any superhero movie . 
  the civil war captain america movie is what i last saw and it was just a movie about a dozen or so people punching , kicking and shooting each other for two hours . 
  absolutely , i am not saying they are awful and unenjoyable in general , but i just do n't enjoy them . 
  strong wind is bad cycling weather . 
  cats often play with their prey before they kill it . 
   but to call anything they knew scientific would be a misnomer . 
  i am not sure how far do vikings `` reach '' into modern times but modern science is generally considered to have started to emerge in the 16th-17th century ( so-called `` early-modern period '' ) , so this is no wonder . 
  physics . 
  learn a bit of it , before you accidentally kill yourself .

  hc : i did not have sex with my husband in 20 years . 
  dt : really ? 
  if my wife did that for 20 days i 'd sell her and get a new upgraded model .

  no , i just washed it . 
  finally . 
  obey and submit . 
  but in a good way !, 
  a locally used unofficial flag , based on the coat of arms of guadeloupe 's capital basse-terre has a black or red field with a yellow sun and a green sugar cane , and a blue stripe with yellow fleurs-de-lis on the top . 
  guadeloupe , an overseas region and department of france located in the caribbean , has no flag with official status other than the french national flag .

  often ideological , but many people of mixed heritage considered themselves `` yugoslavs '' . 
  me included . 
  north serbia , the autonomous province of vojvodina . 
  the white part in the very north , city of subotica . 
  vojvodina is geographically actually central europe . 
   serbian nationalism that led to the collapse ( am i right ? ), 
  that is a bit of an oversimplification , but it was definitely a huge part of the reason . 
  not really , that country is gone . 
  i do n't generally declare any nationality ,, 
  i 'd say it is not the first time . 
  the cheapest option is bus 72 . 
  it is 150 rsd ( 1,25 $ ) to the city and it goes fairly often during peak times , 15-20 mins . 
  it goes from a stop in front of the terminals ( departures , not arrivals ) and it will take you ca 40 mins to the center . 
  this is what i used ca 2 weeks ago . 
  there are shuttle buses too but somewhat more expensive afaik . 
  i paid 2000 rsd ( 16,5 $ ) for a taxi to the main train station last year , but i 've been told you can get it cheaper .

  thanks for the answer goebe - i mean guy . 
  jedan highlight : `` back in serbia he played in a big rock band . '', 
  uzgred , `` obili\u0107 '' , kako kreativno !, 
  ah , this is also like some serbians claiming they are `` sick of political correctness '' all while you can hear `` faggot '' being said in the parlament , football fans chanting `` kill albanians '' , legit political parties publicly being against `` womens liberalism '' because it is `` destroying the family and traditional values '' , etc. 
  some people just live on reddit , read stories about american campuses and can not differentiate it from their real life in serbia . 
  e , realno srednja je sranje .

  lol . 
  plus : http://www.ipay.rs/nase-lokacije, 
  i am not a trump supporter myself , i am fairly neutral about the us elections , but my reasoning why trump seems better in some aspects is : 1 . 
  because two mandates have been enough for the clintons . 
  hillary has a fair amount of scandals as well , and not a `` she said something shocking '' but real conspiracy-level shit 3 . 
  trump is crazy , but also seems less likely to kick off ww3 than hillary .

   foreigners tend to find our grammar very hard , which probably explains why duolingo has n't yet had it implemented , and might not for some time . 
  oh come on . 
  duolingo already has several notoriously difficult languages . 
  the problem is interest in the given language and people who will volunteer to develop the course . 
  serbian grammar is difficult in comparison to english and some other widely spoken languages , but it \u00b4 s not `` unheard of '' difficult . 
  no reason to discourage him . 
  i do n't know where you live , but my girlfriend found `` serbian/croatian '' ( this was the official name ) courses at the slavic studies department at the faculty of linguistics at the local university ( this was in germany ) . 
  any bigger uni has slavic studies at the linguistics department , they usually teach russian and polish , but often have other slavic languages and they might let you audit some course or at least offer you some material and/or give you some advice .
