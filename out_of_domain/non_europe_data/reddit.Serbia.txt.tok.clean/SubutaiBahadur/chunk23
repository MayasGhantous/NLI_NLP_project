  so much this . 
  nemoj da nam tu vague-redituje\u0161 . 
  jel neko koristio [ resistance bands ] ( https://www.amazon.com/spri-xertube-resistance-exercise-attachment/dp/b0085foioq ) i vredi li to i\u0161ta ? 
  trust me .

  jeeeeeeej !, 
  that 's pretty normal, 
  where were you asking for it ? 
  if you were asking for a vojvodina flag in english no wonder you got some looks , it is controversial in itself for some people . 
  anyway it might be difficult to find . 
  you can order it though . 
  i remember finding a company on the internet that would be able to make it , but it was a while ago and in germany and i gave up/forgot about it . 
  if you find one somewhere to buy actually tell me . 
  i might get one myself . 
  edit : https://www.amazon.com/vojvodina-20x30cm-8x12in-diplomat-flags-poles/dp/b00drlcc5k/ref=sr_1_5?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1479108672&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=vojvodina+flag, 
  i think it was this `` diplomat-flags '' company . 
  they sell on amazon . 
  if you were asking for the flag of vojvodina in belgrade ... dude , better do n't do that ... for your safety . 
  btw , constitutionally , the flag of vojvodina should be displayed everywhere in vojvodina along with the flag of serbia , but any place/institution that has a right-wingish government just does n't do it . 
  without any consequences , of course .

  that dude ended up playing for fk jagodina in serbia ... 
  koju uniformu ima\u0161 ? 
  to nije uniforma nego kostim . 
  i manastirima . 
  i am serbian , but ethnically mixed , so that might matter for you . 
  lot of catholics in my family . 
  spanish girlfriend . 
  language barriers exist with parents both ways . 
  our parents have not met yet . 
  otherwise nothing special . 
  she is a bit loud . 
  the best thing is when she goes home to spain and while skyping for an hour and a half i can almost constantly hear some yelling in the background . 
  they throw those parties for you . 
  they are not throwing them constantly when you are not there . 
   i guess if you come from canada for a month you just go around partying . 
  regular people do n't party all the time here , especially if they have a job . 
  so much this . 
  i am an expat myself , but only for a few years . 
  the way some older expats ( 20/30 + years abroad ) idealize things is amazing sometimes . 
  `` people in serbia are having coffee with their neighbors every day '' . 
  uhm , maybe my grandma who is 70 , retired and lives in the village of 2000 people , and only with some neighbors , while others she can not stand . 
  my parents in the city , my friends , etc. 
  most certainly do not . 
  edit : and blasting music outside is totally a-typical . 
  in any day apart from your wedding someone would `` najebo ti se mile majke '' around 22h if you were disturbing the whole neighborhood .

  imate li vi ikakav background u nauci i po\u0161to nemate odakle vam ideja da vi pravite nau\u010dno-popularnu emisiju ? 
  edit : typo, 
  sad se pitam ... 
  perhaps you want to see the mountains in the winter . 
  zlatibor or tara would be a good choice . 
  if in belgrade you can easily reach novi sad too , the second largest city . 
  everybody will be sending you to \u0107evapi and pljeskavica , but the most important thing you have to eat is sarma . 
  trust me . 
  if you want to see something a bit different visit subotica and pali\u0107 in the north . 
  i say `` a bit different '' because it has a more central european than balkan vibe . 
  also we have the largest selection of different kinds of burek i am aware of . 
  not just that i am from there but subotica is definitely one of the nicest cities in serbia ( i would go all the way to say `` the nicest ''  ) . 
  yeah novi sad and subotica are very well connected . 
  there is a national park `` fru\u0161ka gora '' near novi sad . 
  it is a mountain but close to the city and accessible . 
  can play both, 
  crap , that should be nikola maksimovi\u0107 . 
  got carried away with the nemanjas . 
  i really hope he gets loaned out . 
  after a couple of appearances he was n't even on the bench recently . 
  he lacks a bit on the physical side , but there is still time for him to get back on track . 
  no idea . 
  have n't watched him . 
  also in the nt tadi\u0107 and kosti\u0107 are playing wings for serbia atm . 
  `` safe space '' - u.
