  to je super . 
  lol . 
  have you heard of reddit before today ? 
  i am not even going to ask about industrial music because that is obvious . 
  would look badass tbh . 
  for a serbian passport : depends whether or not you are you are officially registered in serbia ( `` knjiga ro\u0111enih '' and `` knjiga dr\u017eavljana '' ) , i.e. 
  do you even exist in the serbian system . 
  if yes , you should have a personal number ( `` jmbg '' ) and then probably just need to go to some representation of the republic of serbia ( usually `` mup '' ) with some id and a document that confirms citizenship . 
  you have to pay 3600 dinars ( and it has to be in dinars ) , which is around 29 euros . 
  otherwise , you need to register as a serbian citizen ( which should n't be a problem if you are born in kosovo ) , but i imagine the procedure is quite a bit more complicated . 
  i 've heard there is a lot of people from kosovo who go to places like vranje or leskovac to get serbian ids . 
  more info , but only in serbian , you can google translate if you need : http://arhiva.mup.gov.rs/cms_lat/dokumenta.nsf/putne-isprave.h, 
  ok , i did not know about these things . 
  i learned both hungarian and serbo/croatian like this and it is the same for me ... only when i started learning other languages systematically as an adult did i start making paralels and realizing the rules . 
  yes . 
  . rs is republic of serbia . 
  by the time yugoslavia stopped being called that and . yu was about to be cancelled . sr was taken by surinam , . se by sweden , . sb by the solomon islands , . si by slovenia . sa by saudi arabia , and . sj ( because maybe `` srbi ** j ** a '' ) by svalbard ( norway ) ... so ... we had to get creative ... 
  if you ask me . rs is better than , i dunno . sd or sth like that ... 
  ftfy, 
  uh , da , ja sam zinuo , bukvalno . 
  savior . 
  i was very happy with 1-1 at half time considering everything . 
  firstly , because it would not be easy to pop a modern flag to something that was discovered in e.g. 
  the abbasid caliphate , phoenicia , or such . 
  secondly , the origin of the name is one thing it comes from the arabic word for a sodium compound found in nature - sodium carbonate , but the metal was isolated by humphry davy . 
  finally , the name `` sodium '' is used in a few countries , in most languages it is `` natrium '' . 
  zdravo , google translate , drago mi je \u0161to smo se upoznali . 
  jebi ga. 
  etymological roots are not indicative of the country of discovery . 
  i do not understand what are you trying to prove by etymology . 
  if the word `` airplane '' had latin roots would that mean it was discovered in the roman empire ? 
  or according to your logic , italy ? 
  sodium is exactly such an example where the discovery of the element is well documented , and it is britain . 
  yet you are linking it to the middle east based on etymology , which is totally irelevant . 
  locations of discovery of many elements are difficult to determine accurately , they are not documented historically . 
  surely you understand one can not slap a flag on carbon . 
  besides , even if not , what is the point ? 
  the country did not exist in the time of discovery . 
  tellurium is already controversial a bit . 
  the picture says romania , but at the time , this location was the austrian empire , romania did not even exist . 
   so , either the word itself is significant , or it is not . 
  you need to stick to a stance rather than contradict yourself it in the very next post . 
  uhm , you started with etymology . 
  look at your first post . 
  edit : and just to clarify , my point then was , as it is now , that you can not take the word `` sodium '' , find its etymological root , and equate that with the history of its discovery . 
  i did not know the root of `` natrium '' , but the point still stands . 
  you can not take the word , find its etymological root , and equate that to the history the discovery of the element, 
  and about the `` the history of sodium '' ... ** compounds ** of sodium were known to people in the middle east , without them even knowing about elements . 
  ** the element sodium ** was discovered in britain . 
  ( btw you are the one who brought up sodium too ), 
   which is why i 'm confused as to why you made that point . 
  you said in your first post, 
   `` give credit where credit is due rather than `` known to ancients . 
  which seems to me it means you would like to give credit to modern countries ( from your last post it is clear that is indeed what you meant ) . 
  i pointed out that `` giving credit '' to modern countries for things that happened even before they came into existance is controversial , to say the least . 
   why are there only european or english-speaking countries listed on there ? 
  the very word for sodium derives from arabic . 
  `` the very word for sodium derives from arabic . '', 
  it sure seems you are trying to say that if the word comes from arabic that shows it is not discovered in europe . 
   you attempted to refute what i said about etymology , then , after i pointed out that you were incorrect , said etymology is a ridiculous thing to discuss and completely irrelevant . 
  perhaps this was unclear in my first answer , but i think i made my point clear already : you can not take the word you are using and use its etymological root to determine where the element was discovered . 
  i just wanted to point out that the word you used to do this is not even the only word for that element . 
  perhaps that was less relevant , but my point about etymology not being indicative of country of discovery still stands . 
   that reversal in stance seems less about the inherent relevance of etymology to the history of an element , and more sour grapes . 
  you are projecting a bit here . 
  if you look to my comment you will see that the sodium/natrium name is just one of my comments , before that i wrote '' the origin of the name is one thing it comes from the arabic word for a sodium compound found in nature - sodium carbonate , but the metal was isolated by humphry davy . '', 
  which you conveniently chose to ignore and engage in etymological discussion - `` origin of the name is one thing , discovery of the element another '' . 
  so there is your `` if you 're going to go on a tangent of the accuracy of the history of the word , maybe make it clear that you do n't see it as relevant when '' . 
  i did that . 
   how would a flag of the modern-day country , perhaps with an asterisk indicating it was discovered before the current country came to be , be considered controversial ? 
  that 's what confuses me about your point . 
  i said tellurium was discovered in the austrian empire , but on a site in modern day romania . 
  austria could easily claim it . 
  this is for an element discovered 300 years ago . 
  discussing the country of origin for elements discovered a few thousand years ago would be much more complicated . 
  if you are confused by this , that is not my responsibility . 
  edit : perhaps spend a bit more time actually reading and understanding my arguments , instead of coming up with provocations . 
  you have heavily edited your responses , for instance `` i never claimed etymological roots are the end all be all of discovery . '', 
  was added much later in the discussion . 
  by doing this you made this completely pointless . 
   your refusal to read what i wrote , while accusing me of doing so , is getting tiring . 
  i read what you wrote , but then you changed it . 
  you do n't have to use puppets , just stick to what you have said and you will be fine . 
  edit : and yes a picture book would be great for you as a communication medium as long as you could keep editing it forever !, 
  it is common decency to note what you have edited in a comment that has already been replied too . 
  but what you lack in decency , you make up in arrogant sarcasm . 
  you offering something or ... ? 
  otherwise `` clarifying wording '' on a comment that has already been replied to is logical and normal . 
  could you write one comment without repeated edits ? 
  does n't seem so so far ... 
  your attempts to insult my intelligence are even more pathetic in this light .

  gulag material, 
  nobody is reading this , and i know the truth . 
  no point lying . 
  this is getting worrying . 
  seek professional help . 
  good that you realize that . 
  check on that muppet obsession as well while you are getting help . 
  bolje !,
