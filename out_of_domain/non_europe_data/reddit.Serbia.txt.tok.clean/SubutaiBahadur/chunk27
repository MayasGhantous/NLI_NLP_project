  i could n't get over that one either . 
  productivity is ** not ** the point of 1984 . 
  ffs . 
  serbian living in denmark here . 
  people are ogranizing to have a protest in front od the serbian embassy in cph as well to support the protests in serbia . 
  it is still in question for today since the police approval has not yet been received , but it will happen . 
  edit :, 
  ima vremena . 
  currently it is about 17tw ( edit : actually that 's 2015 ) . 
  projected 30tw by 2050 . 
  if they would express energy it would have to be in power used in a certain amount of time , might as well use the rate - power ( j/s ) . 
  that is what iea uses usually as well . 
  perhaps it is just a bit poorly phrased . 
  17 tw is total energy . 
  i am guessing it is capacity , it is definitely not twh .

  if anything increasing interconnectedness would be beneficial , due to the intermittent nature of renewable sources . 
  it would allow the inclusion of more renewables in the electricity sector . 
  the grid is as far from being `` outdated '' as possible . 
  generally all hard sciences nowadays are published in english .

  a local website in subotica is running a series of stories in bunjeva\u010dki , here are some :, 
  i do n't know if this is of any help , but you can browse through the website for more .

  right ? 
  how ridiculous is it that people can tell he 's a yank from a tattoo of norway he got ? 
  but , but , but ... muh internet crusade !, 
  * repetira tetejac *, 
  man , just look at language ... all of the americas , from alaska to tierra del fuego more or less speak english , spanish , french , portuguese or dutch . 
  those are all european languages . 
  look at how many african states use european languages as official , even more as unofficial languages of communication . 
  look at the influence of long dead european languages like latin or ancient greek on modern language and culture ... 
  this is not to say europeans are superior in any way , but reallistically the world is quite eurocentric . 
  i to je ta\u010dno , ali je ipak manji problem . 
  ne\u0161to ` vako : https://jakubmarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/suicides-europe.jpg,

  ajoj , ja sam ba\u0161 lik za \u0111uskanje , ubibo\u017ee ... no umem da napravim solidnu \u0161pansku tortilju , sa sve okretanjem tiganja , so i have that going for me ... 
  obvious cryptofascism is obvious . 
  the first things that come to my mind :, 
  no stray dogs or stray animals in general . 
  dogs do not bark at you all the time . 
  much less gossiping and judging people . 
  e.g. , people are much more free to wear whatever they want even if it is completely ridiculous ( for me ) . 
  germans , danes , etc. 
  keep much more of a distance at work than . 
  it 's more difficult to make friends among your colleagues . 
  if people do a sport here they buy the full gear instantly , to the point of it being ridiculous sometimes . 
  going jogging - full running gear , cycling - full cycling gear . 
  playing football - football gear down to the shin guards . 
  in serbia people generally wear shorts , a t-shirt and general sports shoes . 
  for instance only if you do cycling pretty seriously would you buy the tight cycling pants . 
  yeah you might be right . 
  i am cycling pretty casually but i know the pain all too well . 
   such butcher shops usually charge a small fee for grilling food , and will often have fries available for sale . 
  uh , what ? 
  where is this ? 
  also 2 and 3 are connected . 
  people tend to stay out of each others business completely . 
  less nosy , but also less likely to just start chatting casually . 
   everything closes down at 6-7pm, 
  yeah this is a big one !, 
  in germany it is more like 8 , but still . 
  and nothing , nothing works on sundays and public holidays apart from gas stations and maybe shops at the airport/major train stations . 
  denmark is much better in that regard though , so i forgot to mention . 
  well i do n't regret missing butcher shop fries . 
  kada to radi patrijcka organizacija u beogradu onda je do jaja . 
  hahahaha ...

  say what you want , but you ca n't say he is not dedicated . 
  why ? 
  too many humans on the planet anyways . 
  you know all those problems everyone talks about like global warming ? 
  cut the population and a lot of it goes away . 
  i myself fully support alternative and spiritual medicine . 
  of course i advise against it privately to anyone i care about . 
  but otherwise - knock yourself out .
