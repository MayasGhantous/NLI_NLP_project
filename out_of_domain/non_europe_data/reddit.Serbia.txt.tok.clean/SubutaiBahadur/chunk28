  angela merkel seems to be very popular in germany . 
  however , many europeans dislike her , even sometimes claiming that she revived german imperialism ( which sounds ridiculous to me ) . 
  i understand that germans simply think she is doing a good job as chancellor , but i do not get why she is so disliked in other eu countries . 
  i am a phd student in chemistry , i have been in germany for a short time and now i am supposed to move to munich to continue my studies at the technical university around october . 
  what i really need advice on is the apartment search . 
  i tried wg-gesucht , but i got literally no responses so far . 
  many people say that not speaking german ( actually speaking little german ) , and writing e-mails and speaking in english can be a big drawback ... so any advice on what should a foreign english-speaking student do to increase his chances ? 
  any help is appreciated . 
  i have an invoice for payment . 
  i do n't quite know how does it work . 
  need help soon , do n't know who to ask . 
  thanks in advance . 
  recently a bunch of obviously fake profiles added me on skype ( it happened before too , but now it intensified ) . 
  the profiles are all similar , female , with a sexy profile pic , and the messages are `` i want to meet you '' , `` hey , i like you '' blah-blah . 
  what do these people actually want ? 
  what can they achieve if i add them/chat/talk to them . 
  is this a money related scam , some malware , or what ? 
  the story comes from montenegro . 
  ( article in serbian : http://www.cdm.me/drustvo/podgorica/placa-alimentaciju-tudoj-djeci ), 
  man from podgorica , montenegro , finds out that the two children he has been paying child support for years are not his biological children and decides to contest the court decision to pay . 
  the court rejects it on the grounds that the children are older than 5 years , and he is now `` too late '' according to the law . 
  according to him , besides child support he was also paying the mothers rent , clothes for the kids , etc. 
  for years . 
  they divorced in 2011 , and the children are 6 and 8 years old , which definitely means she was cheating on him . 
  regardless of everything , he will now be forced to pay for the kids his ex-wife had with someone else . 
  i was wondering whether europeans already had racist viewpoints when the slave trade started , or did this spread later on . 
  was it propagated to justify the slave trade which brought in huge profits for many ? 
  i know that even when the americas were discovered the natives were treated as savages , but was this purely because of their lifestyle/non-christian beliefs or were these ideas of `` lesser humans '' already developed ? 
  i am aware that this may be a kind of a `` chicken or the egg '' question but i would like to hear the opinion of someone more knowledgeable on the topic . 
  no worries !,

  the problem : in pt-alloys under certain conditions relevant for the article the less noble element dissolves from the surface layers . 
  this results in a structure where a pt shell covers an alloy core . 
  the lattice parameters of these two phases are of course different . 
  this introduces lattice strain to the pt-shell . 
  now , alloying pt with metals of smaller and greater radius both results in compressive strain on the pt-shell . 
  this seems counter-intuitive to me . 
  while i understand why alloying with metals of smaller radius introduces compressive strain , should n't the presence of larger atoms result in tensile strain ? 
  does anyone have a suggestion for literature on the topic that would help me better understand this ? 
  i have found discrepancies in the literature , from simple % of the difference in the lattice constant between the `` normal '' and the strained state , to quite complicated calculations . 
  how would you define lattice strain and what is understood to be the best method of calculating it ? 
  can it be predicted e.g. 
  based on the lattice constant mismatch of two crystal phases in contact ?

  hello everyone . 
  i will be starting work at the dtu from 1st of november . 
  i see there are several housing questions on the subreddit already , but i would like to ask for my case specifically . 
  do you know if the university has the option to find me some housing ( at least temporary ) since i am currently living in germany with not much time to travel to denmark for open door days/interviews ? 
  i would like to rent an appartment , my girlfriend should move there too a few months after me . 
  how is the transportation from copenhagen to lyngby ( not just timewise but also regularity , crowdedness , and such ) ? 
  is it generally much better to live in lyngby , or is copenhagen also ok ? 
  finally , can you tell me what are the best websites for appartment search in lyngby and copenhagen ? 
  thanks you all in advance . 
  hello , everyone . 
  i am moving to denmark to work at the technical university of denmark from november this year , and my girlfriend is moving there with me . 
  now my job is research-oriented and will be 100 % in english , but neither me or my girlfriends speak any danish ( apart from `` hej hvordan g\u00e5r det ? '', 
  for now ... ) . 
  my question is what are * her * chances of finding a job in copenhagen or the vicinity ? 
  she has a degree in english literature and currently works in a translation company in germany . 
  she speaks 5 + languages ( but not danish : / ) . 
  is it really difficult for foreigners to find jobs without speaking danish ? 
  is it better if she does some intensive danish course and then starts looking for a job ? 
  she already speaks german and english , and she is really good with languages , so i guess she could make progress fast . 
  does anyone have experiences with job searches in , e.g. , english in copenhagen ? 
  thank you all in advance !,

  can anyone recommend some outlet stores or such ? 
  i would n't like to spend too much money but i would n't like to buy something trashy-looking either . 
  which stores offer a good compromise in that regard for someone on a phd student budget ?
