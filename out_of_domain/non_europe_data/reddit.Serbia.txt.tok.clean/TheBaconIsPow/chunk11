  im pretty sure the woman is the grand marshall . 
  sorry , i 've never played them so i mixed some terms up, 
  tzeentch marine just looks evil rather than terrifying in armor , i guess he 's the only one that does n't make you a walking biohazard trashbag , an insane murderer , or an insane nymphomaniac . 
  papa nurgle 's origin story, 
  all hail the god general secretary of mankind . 
  in this universe horus is an ancap . 
  that communist thing doesnt make sense . 
  edit : it does n't make sense because that is not what a communist wants or thinks it 's r/badpolitics material to imply it . 
  did n't they also have something to do with that website for reporting suspected marxist proffesors in universities ? 
  this reminds me a lot of mount and blade warband . 
  though i guess it 'll be much easier to understand and more streamlined . 
  took me 6 restarts in mb to finally form a kingdom . 
  no it was n't , the islamists werent the only ones against the government . 
  the government was installed by the west after they overthrew the previous one to protect their oil interests . 
  but you 're not defending it , you 're furthering the interests of an elite that do n't give a shit about you . 
  how are the wars in the middle east defending america ? 
  i 'd say the ruling class does n't care about you if they 're willing to give your life in exchange for their interest . 
  the official cause for the war was because saddam 's government supposedly held wmds . 
  after the invasion no substantial evidence was found of their existence . 
  i guess by terrorist groups you mean al qaeda and the perpetrators of 9/11 however the hijackers were not of iraqi nationality and most were from saudi arabia . 
  the war in iraq was not about revenge or peacekeeping , it was for the ruling class 's interests notably in oil . 
  we 're not angry at the ordinary men and women in the military . 
  we 're angry because so many civilians and soldiers died in a war for selfish interests and at the government and system that allowed it to happen . 
  can you tell us how you can abduct anyone in a week 's time ? 
  it seems your wife gave birth to the god emperor of mankind . 
  sadly not cannon . 
  r/gamingcirclejerk is probably the best gaming subreddit on reddit ironicaly . 
  i swear to god you 're on every sub . 
  the biggest 40k sub is just r/warhammer . 
  it is known . 
  this is a meme from r/fullcommunism . 
  the meme was intentionally made to look like something from this sub . 
  do n't insult the guard ya git , it 's the emperor 's hammer . 
  seriously though , people should get that the guard is a well trained , equipped and loyal force . 
  select the text on the last document to see the hidden text in it . 
  pretty neat thing they have , noticed it accidentally ,, 
  you need it for the full story . 
  [ read between the lines ] ( http://imgur.com/a/y6pgb ), 
  yes we are . 
  we just use sarcasm a lot . 
  you need to set their rights to undesirables if i remember correctly , that 'll get em . 
  the devs would never remove genocide . 
  ah , i see now , my bad . 
  in that case this seems like a really odd oversight . 
  there is n't anything contradictory about a middle class communist provided they are n't bourgeois . 
  a middle class grocery store owner would not be looked upon well , but a middle class office worker will for example . 
  well the first one has a hotkey attached to it . 
  [ here 's one found recently , estimated to be from around the 15th century . ], 
  ( http://www.crapasaurus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/dick-butt-on-great-wall-of-china.jpg ), 
  needs more jpeg, 
  acceptable . 
  i liked how the original battlefront 2 did it . 
  you play as a clone trooper during the clone wars at first and you then work yourself up the timeline to the battle of hoth , death star etc. 
  but you already have ** two ** mirror 's edge games !, 
  is n't that enough to keep your unrelatable sjws out of my vidya ? 
  it would just break the laws of physics and probably punch through the facility killing anyone that sees it 's face and then get to you either by running or making physically impossible jumps . 
  if you were on mars and you saw a picture , it would probably somehow jump with such force to reach mars and then navigate the planet to find you provided that it does n't land on your face . 
  i would say yes . 
  096 is able to break the laws of physics or any other laws , if he requires it to hunt someone down . 
  he 'd probably first break out of his containment facility and then jump so high that he catapults himself to the d class 's position in space . 
  that 's why he is so terrifying , there really is nothing you can do to stop him . 
  actually in battlefront ii the campaign is an alternate universe in which the rebellion is destroyed on hoth . 
  you play it from the perspective of the 501st legion , which essentially becomes fanatical about destroying the rebellion near the end of the game . 
  there 's also one where the planet spawns fucking genestealers or some shit that overrun your colonists if the colony is still young and without a good garrison . 
  yeah but in battlefront ii 's story , the rebellion is completely annihilated , the second death star is never destroyed and the galaxy has peace under the empire . 
  it actually kind of surprised me that they took that route . 
  i was still new and unaware of the genestealer threat . 
  i thought i was gon na get an awesome bonus . 
  and the opposite of what you 'd think they are when you hear their name . 
  [ well this was an unintentional similarity . ], 
  andrew ryan would probably not like this considering he is an ancap . 
  a schism is happening within the church of the worm, 
  over population is a myth , do n't worry . 
  our rates of growth will eventually slow down and the un forecasts that the 12 billionth baby will never be born . 
  many countries today are going opposite of over population and are in need of more humans . 
  regarding the ` not enough food ' problem , we already produce enough food for 10 billion people . 
  starvation in places like africa are not due to scarcity rather to poverty and inequality . 
  you ca n't blame a single person for that , but you can question why we use a system that is so inefficient . 
  but it all changed when the ** f e m a l e s ** attacked . 
  the worm pope shall pay for his indulgences . 
  hearts of iron 4, 
  ** anotha command post for da republic **, 
  nah , he can break the laws of physics to get you . 
  he 'd probably burst out of his containment facility and then launch himself into space and somehow maneuver himself to you . 
  it is completely immune to anything you could throw at it . 
  if a team of armed special forces that specialize in containing things like it can get completely wiped out , with the only survivor being one who was lucky enough not to see it 's face . 
  they fired at it with an anti tank rifle and it just ignored it and kept running . 
  yeah , no shit . 
  it 's from this http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-096, 
  i really hate when people use the yeltsin a supermarket story as a gotcha . 
  like he is supposedly a communist his whole life , and then he sees the inside of a single supermarket in america and suddenly realizes capitalism is the best . 
  i seriously doubt it 's that simple . 
  i do n't get the problem . 
  they want to properly understand something and clear up a question . 
  yeah you do n't even need to understand or comprehend that you saw the face , just have to technically see it or a part of it . 
  that diy anti-communist action shield is what really does it for me . 
  i do n't see how they can call antifa edgy teens when you see this . 
  ` let 's be fascists , ...
