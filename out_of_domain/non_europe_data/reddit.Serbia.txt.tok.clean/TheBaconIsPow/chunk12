  yeah sure . 
  wait a second , i forgot about pasta . 
  edit : done , you can post it now . 
  i did n't do use that name , because i did n't what it to seem like a sub for j articles . 
  though we could use r/scp _ j. 
  well , i feel like we 've already got a bit of a start in subs on the first one , so i think we should probably stick with it . 
  if the other one gets good attention we can migrate to it . 
  i do n't really expect it to get a large userbase . 
  i 've made it more so if someone posts a meme on the main sub , they can crosspost it to the meme sub . 
  then we can have a reddit for storing scp memes so that people who want to see that specifically can go there . 
  if they enforced that law , half the fbi would be convicted . 
  i hope so as well . 
  yes , you did . 
  i 'm proud of you !, 
  there . 
  i think that should do it . 
  done , i believe . 
  done . 
  it is meant to be used so that the reader can decide what they want to be there instead of it getting defined by the author and diminishing the effect , when used properly it is really great . 
  i know you 're not serious , but do n't link to that piece of shit . 
  i 'm certain i added it . 
  did you want a text flair or a pic of him ? 
  ** b ^ or ^ ea ^ lum won, 
  well i added it yesterday , unless something is not working right . 
  can you try to get it ? 
  the codecks astartees nehmes this maneuvah steel rehn !, 
  *** emperor 's bowels ***, 
  can you explain the meme ? 
  i know about the 13 reasons why but i do n't see how it fits in here . 
  they think the military is a ` murica hive mind . 
  i 'd say most of them would support the legal government , regardless of who controls it . 
  but the idea of a civil war in the near future is already getting a bit absurd , but if there was one i heavily doubt the alt right would be some kind of ` major faction ' . 
  well m42 was never really a '' forbidden '' time , it 's just it was used rarely and in the early years of it . 
  also known as '' i 've followed turning point on facebook for a year and watch julie borowski . '', 
  it 's artwork for the game . 
  i 'm not sure if you are serious . 
  to be honest , some skips do need those other object classes . 
  scp-2000 for example would n't work with some other class . 
  and apollyon should be used more for some skips that are impossible to contain . 
  `` both have the same endgame . 
  total destruction of the white race . 
  [ +60 ] '' i want to see how someone can think like this . 
  *** emperor 's bowels !, 
  yeah , there are n't any bots . 
  this is my first sub so i 'm trying to get the basics though i 'll see about bots . 
  yup , he should be banned at this point . 
  ! scp-173 , this is the closest thing to a substitute . 
  it 's beyond karma . 
  he is very obviously unfit to moderate 80 subs if he even tries to moderate them in the first place . 
  *** emperor 's bowels ***, 
  the more you scroll down in this thread , the darker it gets . 
  i like how this comment makes sense , even without understanding the reference . 
  [ which side are you on ? ], 
  ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iaim02kv0g ), 
  yeah , i see some people think we should just abandon efforts to convert anyone who voted for trump , but that would mean casting off a large percentage of the working class who can be converted . 
  of course nazis , alt right , and others like them are people we should fight . 
  echoes of the tomb is a short story about one of his necron encounters . 
  he was the only survivor if i remember correctly and lost two fingers . 
  yeah , i just mixed the two up . 
  tagged as `` will eat toast if victoria 3 is announced '' . 
  you better not disappoint . 
  do n't you worry i 'm paying my premiums . 
  yeah switching jobs is like a different flavor of ice cream and can be done whenever you want . 
  it 's so they can whitewash him and turn him into a harmless icon . 
  true , but you ca n't deny how much he has been whitewashed and used as a tool to talk down on people who protest for social justice . 
  exactly . 
  it 's beyond just violent protests . 
  people tend to think that disruption of public order in any way is unacceptable and think mlk just had a nice walk at 3 am to protest , my man . 
  you better get that toast ready to eat / u/avohaj . 
  edit : nvm , you can stick to keto . 
  to be honest , it was that researcher 's fault . 
  instead of just saying it had rabies and that it is aggressive as fuck , he just said one vague word like he was trying to be fucking symbolic . 
  how the fuck are they supposed to understand what you mean when you say `` rage '' . 
  like good work fuckhead , 30 million people are dead but at least you did n't have to go through the of effort of clarifying what the monkey was infected with . 
  do n't get me started on the sequel . 
  28 weeks later . 
  what have you done !, 
  the bot was n't able of handling the forbidden meme and now you gave it an aneurysm . 
  you should n't really worry too much about it . 
  scp ideas are n't taken really . 
  obviously copying the scp almost to the letter is not cool , but no one can be expected to read every scp to check if their idea is not unique . 
  even if there is an scp with a similar idea to yours , the chances of it being so similar that it makes a problem are low . 
  his government industrialized and modernized the country . 
  serbia was no longer the politically dominant region . 
  living standards increased and the public was free to travel . 
  they were part of neither bloc during the cold war which allowed them to maintain independence . 
  while i would n't call them socialist , they were prosperous . 
  of course there was political repression , most notably the goli otok labor camp ; while the conditions in it were harsh and inhumane it was far from a concentration camp as people like to equate it to . 
  16000 people were incarcerated there with 400-600 deaths . 
  there will be a time i 'll be playing victoria 3 and you will be eating toast . 
  can you not see his slick straight jaw and those awesome swimming goggles ? 
  the tau are too incompetent in melee to be able to pull of the famous human wave maneuver . 
  antifa are not democrats , they tend would be protesting even if hillary was elected . 
  the soros connection does not have any evidence and makes no sense considering antifa is a tactic and not a unified organisation . 
  the black panthers were n't racists and often collaborated with groups such as the white panther party . 
  there is a difference when you fight for your freedom and when you fight to assert your dominance . 
  it 's sad how many people do n't their government drugged and killed a man extrajudicialy . 
  you could 've just rubbed his head . 
  victoria 2 , maybe stellaris if you want more falgsc . 
  ! scp-3008 is the best we got .
