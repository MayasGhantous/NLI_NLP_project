  sorry , it 's a bit of an inside joke in those subs . 
  anyways , socialism is characterized by workers owning their own workplace and the abolition of private ( absentee ) property . 
  the government socializing some services does not equate to that , so it is n't socialist . 
  if you dont acknowledge the fact that soviet soldiers were 12 year olds with spears , then you are a tankie . 
  yeah , just push everyone who voted for trump and now regrets it away and then cry as your 5th rich white neoliberal loses the election . 
  tbh , the former regime was n't really made up of people worth living . 
  dh is n't that hard to learn . 
  a lot of countries you can just spam infantry with an artillery brigade , some industry , a submarine shitstack and call it a day . 
  the larger countries with more powerful enemies will require more thought put into them . 
  metal bawkses, 
  yeah , let me tell you what a real job is . / s, 
  is savinkov 's nazi russia in the hoi4 version yet . 
  where is the vozhd !, 
  i used to think you give people their days after they die , so that cults of personality do n't form . 
  in my country , as shit as it is , we have to wait around 5 years before you can name a street after someone . 
  it is easy to fantasize about a glorious civil war or a coup when it will never affect you . 
  while they are often necessary revolutions should n't be idealized like it is a tea party . 
  we are guilty of this as well if to a lesser extent than others . 
  it may be something we want , but setting it up as something fun or pleasant will only get you disappointment when it does come . 
  sorry i got off track there . 
  the title got me thinking about how much does right wing facebook pages fantasize about a second civil war . 
  even if it was something they could win , do they think it will come easily ? 
  that they can continue shitposting while they sustain themselves on rations and have their friends killed or be conscripted to fight in horrible conditions . 
  or face reprisals if the enemy side occupies the place they live . 
  `` a revolution is not a dinner party , or writing an essay , or painting a picture , or doing embroidery ; it can not be so refined , so leisurely and gentle , so temperate , kind , courteous , restrained and magnanimous . 
  a revolution is an insurrection , an act of violence by which one class overthrows another . '', 
  okay i just lost track of the subject here with my little rant . 
  mods , remove this if it is n't considered on topic . 
  personally , scps have stopped scaring me or making me paranoid . 
  they can still disturb me , and leave a lot to think about , but i tend to have stopped being scared mostly because i simply do n't look at the wiki the same way i used to before . 
  i did used to get scared by a lot of series 1s before , but once you read them a dozen times , read discussions about them , and what not , they do n't feel the same for me . 
  i really do n't know why exactly , but maybe i liked it more when i would just read an article occasionally and not come back to the site for a month , the articles were much scarier for me . 
  yeah , i think that might probably be it . 
  so it is a law meant for repressing unions ? 
  from what i have read it gives non union members union benefits , meaning that people wo n't have an incentive to pay their dues causing unions to collapse ? 
  i have bamboozle insurance fyi . 
  i always play with sprites , provided that there is n't anything particularly demanding . 
  kropotkin is using his money to fund anti capitalists beyond the grave !, 
  the guy that they used , literally made a video explaining why it is n't an oxymoron .

  i think consumerist culture is the word you 're looking for . 
  materialism can mean a lot of things . 
  yes but only the internationale ones . 
  the jazzy version of einheitfrontslied is really nice . 
  edit : can a person not chose his music ? 
  it is kind of annoying having to listen to the music of a faction you are eradicating . 
  / r/enlightenedbirdmenrevolutionaries, 
  just because it is your own conclusion , does n't make it any more valid . 
  before you ask , we do have a channel for gears porn , so you do n't have to worry . 
  he meant our discord , i believe . 
  it 's a discord for / r/dankmemesfromsite19 but it 's more of a general discord for skips . 
  it was made yesterday . 
  are you saying that anarchist militias are ineffective , you statist scum ?!, 
  did n't know that many scps are ancaps . 
  sorry i had to . 
  * looks at my stagnating operation barbarossa after 230 hours in darkest hour *, 
  tmw when you do n't use your communist party to establish a worker 's state and expand the revolution , but instead you go full pol pot and get overthrown by liberals . 
  makes a video getting pissed off at an article , `` critiques '' it by showing quotes out of context and cutting of the image if there is further context below . 
  also doing a video on a story that was proven to be false , then claims they 're not responsible for their lies , because they are entertainers . 
  that one may be a bit too specific ( due to it referring to a specific incident ) though the `` doing a video on a fabrication '' is fairly common . 
  using breitbart as a news source is not exactly the way to get `` the truth !? '', 
  out there . 
  cnt-fai is n't really a party name . 
  cnt is a federation of trade unions and exists irl and fai is an organization of militants within cnt . 
  the two are used interchangeably often due to them being very close . 
  well you know more of a state with a worker majority , rather than a state for workers , i suppose . 
  i 'd say i know how to play the game by now , though i always tend to use some inefficient tactics that are a problem with the soviets . 
  to beat france , bypass the maginot by crossing in from belgium , after this i recommend encricling some french army stacks ( you could do it in dunkirk , heh ) then making a detour for paris and other victory points . 
  encircle alsace-lorraine and keep them there for a bit , you might not need to attack ( you might need to , though it all depends on the requirements of the surrender event ) . 
  trap some divisions in brittatny and normandy if you can and continue onwards . 
  by this point the french are n't really that tough so you could do fine . 
  you do n't need anything more than infantry and artillery for this ( not to say having better stuff is bad , but not necessarily in large numbers ) eventually the french will hopefully surrender ( unless you are unlucky enough that they pick the option to keep fighting ) . 
  now you got ta get ready for the rumble with the soviets , if you did the french invasion well you should have a year left roughly . 
  do n't worry about the british navy as a couple of sub stacks will be sufficient . 
  if you fail , you can relieve yourself by swarming germany with shitstacks as russia in kaiserreich . 
  britain number 1 mediterranean country . 
  someone could be forgiven for thinking that china is socialist , that someone is n't an mp . 
  true , my neighborhood may look christian at first glance , but if you look into a person 's basement you will find that they have shrines to hillary to which they pray to every night . 
  what kind of freedom do we have if we ca n't even practice our religion in public ? 
  beat poland first , then redeploy the divisions from the east into the border with the allies . 
  concentrate as much as you can spare on the benelux rather than the maginot . 
  this should achieve a breakthrough . 
  do n't go after the lads and lasses in the militias . 
  the poum did nothing wrong . 
  but seriously was n't the ineffectiveness of the front come from in fighting and lack of coordination . 
  a person the discord said it was good , so i 'm trying to get a proper translation , rather than google translate . 
  i recommend watching threads , before wishing nuclear attacks on anybody . 
  movie is dated , but still very good .
