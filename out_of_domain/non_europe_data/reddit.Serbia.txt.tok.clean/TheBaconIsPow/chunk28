  i am playing as yugoslavia and the problem is that it says yugoslavian instead of yugoslav . 
  how will i be able to be proud of my african colonies if they are carrying that adjective . 
  i have n't been on this sub for some time now and i ca n't help but be confused at the game over fuck serbia . 
  what did we do we gave you the dankest of maymays and you reject us for being better at quillah worship . 
  you should be ashamed especially you jake you cheeky bastard . 
  as you 've all noticed the new ac passed barely making a sound . 
  i bet some of you did n't even notice it came out . 
  for me it is kind of unfortunate because it is good and not as fucked up like unity . 
  when netfilx was released globally i got excited because of the amount of high quality tv shows and movies , but when i subscribed ( free month currently ) it barely has any of the shows or movies that i saw mentioned by other users ( non local ) . 
  what i want to know is will it stay like this forever or is it temporary ? 
  my settlement is not attracting new settlers ( except one ) even though i have all the necessary resources , stores and 2 recruitment beacons ( both are plugged in and activated ) . 
  i only have 8 settlers and until i can get more my settlement will never become interesting . 
  a long time ago my young level 1 geralt was in white orchard slaying monsters , getting killed by drowners and trying to see if he can find a sex scene . 
  one nice day geralt decided that he will make a stand against the nilfgaardian invaders and after some thinking he decided that he would find the nearest village guards and scare them with his magical voodoo powers . 
  however this plan had turned sour as the soldiers knew of his plot and then beat him to a bloody pulp taking his money with it . 
  geralt was scarred both mentally and physically , but he moved on . 
  14 years later geralt had become stronger , learned to kill drowners and had found a sex scene . 
  he started plotting to get revenge by finding his attackers and killing them by igni spam ( this started after he watched the kill bill films ) . 
  he first convinced hatori to get of his ass and make a glorious sword . 
  he then traveled back to white orchard , back to where it all began and found the archers . 
  geralt had swiftly and cunningly started spamming igni when he realized something , ... the archers had scaled with him . 
  despite his best efforts the archers had won again , repeating the cycle . 
  geralt had once again got his shit beaten out of him . 
  i only have two simple questions for you : do the guards stop scaling with you and more importantly will geralt ever get his revenge ? 
  yes i have linked them both to the same social club account . 
  i 've only played gwent once and it was going ok till the that guy in the first bar pulled some magic shit and i ragequit ( bad temper ) . 
  ( some small quest spoilers ) at the scene where the guy is supposed to shoot me with a bolt he misses which leaves me stuck and forces me to load an earlier save . 
  i 've tried it a couple times but it stays the same . 
  i have a beta code from my new order copy and i redeemed it on the psn store yesterday and it gave me the doom alpha . 
  now obviously the alpha wo n't work but what i am wondering is will it allow me to download the beta when it comes out because i thought that when you redeem a code you only get what is offered immediately on the download page . 
  in the cave the alien has a ham radio beside him , probably to send a sos to mothership . 
  the gibberish might not be gibberish . 
  edit : secret not secrer . 
  i 'm in singleplayer . 
  i really do n't like online , but i do love director mode and singleplayer . 
  it really annoys me and makes me feel like the singleplayer is only a secondary focus . 
  what i mean by this is , if i were a legal german at that time and for some reason i tried to steal an apple from the market and was caught , how harshly would i have been punished ? 
  i 've been waiting a long time for a cute baby that can make cute viral videos . 
  i followed all of the advice and made sure to give my wife cocaine and a lot of steroids everyday so it can be both energetic and strong . 
  when my wife went in labor prematurely it was probably the happiest moment of my life . 
  when it came out i could describe myself as slightly disappointed . 
  a couple of hours after suffocating and mutilating my wife i was faced with what to do with my baby . 
  the neighbors overreacted a bit after i carved out my wife 's uterus and they called the police . 
  the police are now breaking down my door and i 'm wondering whether to go with this diy option .

  i was watching the first episode and in the part where it shows juliana 's bus travelling on the map i noticed the peninsula is not there . 
  was this a mistake or on purpose .

  i am trying to change a flag in the game . 
  i put it in the proper format , resolution , gave it the right name and put it in the gfx/flags directory . 
  yet no matter how much i try it wo n't change . 
  can anyone help ? 
  just point anything you 'd like in the comments . 
  i just do n't get it , i 've never hit anyone or anything with a bomb even though i always go for the points under siege by the enemies . 
  i do n't see anyone else complaining so i must be missing something . 
  any tips ? 
  and i refuse to play as a gunner anymore as my ace pilot colleagues keep charging into c 's antenna trying to be stuka bombers . 
  no wonder everyone dismisses socialism , communism , etc. 
  when no one fucking understands it and rather than read something about it and get informed on it , no that would mean that they do n't know something that they have a polarized opinion on . 
  for example go to a eli 5 thread asking about socialism not a specific one , ** any one ** and you will understand . 
  the most common upvoted explanation is that socialism is when the government gives you welfare , free education etc. 
  and high taxes which equals good and communism is when the government takes all your stuff , taxes you and you live in misery and starve which equals bad . 
  another common explanation is that socialism is when everyone is paid the same regardless of their work , which then leads to a following argument about how no one works hard because the only reason people do good things is cause of money , also do n't forget the number one argument - ** muh human nature ** . 
  try to give a more positive and less biased definition which does n't immediately dismiss it as a wacky idea by some germans and then , . . ** omg you fucking stalinist if you like communism that much go live in north korea you mad man ** and it gets worse and worse from there . 
  this is more general reddit stuff eli 5 was just an example . 
  i mean do you seriously believe that one of the most influential ideologies of modern history is that stupid . 
  i 'm not saying you have to be one as i 'm not myself a communist but this is just ignorant . 
  i think someone should make a good , reasonably long explanation and share it with others so people can shoot the above arguments as much as possible . 
  okay then i got that off my chest , time to make some fresh pingu memes, 
  at least you have a css . 
  i had recently bought mass effect 3 on the 360 however it was a german copy , when i started the game all the text was in english as it should be but all the voice acting was in german . 
  can i change language to english or is it impossible ? 
  imagine you are an average guardsman and you see [ this ] ( http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/mediawiki/images/0/05/slaaneshmarine.jpg ) coming towards you , with you having no chance of survival . 
  i 'd die of a heart attack before they even reached me . 
  seeing one of their ships would also kill me in anticipation of what is going to come out of it . 
  i am currently a priest with 4000 dark power and would like to become high priest so i can absorb the life force of my less valuable children before i die . 
  i have around 369 score and the heir ( king of sweden ), 
  has around 390 . 
  i am 50 years old so i do n't got a lot of time left . 
  since im changing government forms i 'd like to also my homeworld 's name . 
  [ i mean look at this ] ( https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammer40k/images/3/34/techpriest2.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20111026163206 ) how does someone live and work like this . 
  they 're probably the most advanced faction in the galaxy , but their bodies look like the desktop on your dad 's computer . 
  here is the link : https://www.reddit.com/r/dankmemesfromsite19/, 
  i wanted to make this sub for some time now , but i was n't really sure if anyone was really making the memes , if this is considered against the rules or if there already is a sub for this , i 'll delete the post . 
  copypastas and mock articles are allowed . 
  and of course no copy and pasting j articles from the main site to the sub . 
  if you have any wishes , post them below . 
  posts of this kind that have already been posted will not be removed , however all further ones will . 
  there is really an ungodly large amount of fluff in the scp universe , making it sometimes hard to discern unrelated rule breaking shitposts from good scp memes . 
  big thanks to the creator u/one _ more_minute for setting it up . 
  he should be working as he would in the main sub now . 
  ever since the main sub was alerted of the presence of afton robotics , the community here on reddit has been rather toxic towards them and i would like to address that . 
  while i do understand why you think that their writing is bad and a poor rip off of scp , their community has stated that they know this and are simply trying to improve their writing skills . 
  their subreddit has been brigaded by our scp community on reddit and that really sends a poor image of us as a supportive and mature community . 
  why do n't you try and help their members to get better writing skills , rather than just calling them shit . 
  this same thing applies to cold posters . 
  ridiculing them will just make them quit and not try to improve . 
  i believe the community here on reddit should be more like the one on the main wiki . 
  the scp wiki used to be filled with shit until the admins made mass deletions and a lot of the wiki was rewritten .
