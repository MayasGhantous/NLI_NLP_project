  it will never happen here . 
  well the way to solve this is to delete your military and spend all your ic on production . 
  that way the populace will get angry because no consumer goods and overthrow you and canada can be a strong free socialist land . 
  we do n't invade , it is a well known law of physics that any game where you can spread the revolution will eventually become entirely dominated by socialists and communists . 
  and besides you 'll join us soon enough anyway . 
  this pasta yours ? 
  cause im def gon na use it . 
  yeah , but i was n't really playing with a goal in mind . 
  one time i made every new state a slave state for no real reason and had to deal with a csa that spanned from seattle to the border with maryland , and chicago . 
  late game revolution tends to be inevitable unless you know what you are doing . 
  * if you 're not a noob like me :(, 
  this is also just r/badpolitics in general . 
  if you honestly think the world is controlled by marxists i 'll have a bit of whatever you 're taking, 
  in one of his recent videos one of the guests said that socialism is when the government owns the means of production which is about 19,17 gigazizeks , around enough to power a single prager u video . 
  though i think he apologized . 
  do they realize that those women are most likely feminist anarchists and communists . 
  what is ironic is that these women are also feminist and most likely anarchist or communist . 
  they do n't get that people like them were on the other side of the war . 
  they do n't actually . 
  we do n't look at 15/hr as an end goal , more of a short term one to make the lives of working people better . 
  demanding a living wage for work is n't whining . 
  well i mean they even said it was sarcasm . 
  always good to see comrades spread the word to other subs . 
  this is the first time juliana has ever saved anybody from something . 
  in one scene in season 2 , there is a brief scene with british nazis discussing piracy with the japanese . 
  they even have armbands with the union jack and the swastika on them similar to the american armbands . 
  i 'm guessing the monarchy still exists as well . 
  enemy at the gates is not a good documentary . 
  because fascism clearly states that it is anti democracy whilst socialism and communism clearly state that democracy must be a part of everyone 's life and that workers should manage the economy and production democratically . 
  *** she targeted gamers ***, 
  / uj well she was way overdue with the episodes even though it was supposed to last a short time period , it is still not released fully and is approaching 4 years , not to mention she got much more money than targeted iirc . 
  though the people who funded her are not the ones complaining about this . 
  i might be wrong , i stopped giving a shit a long time ago . 
  dae the idiocracy documentary not comedy guys , stoopid chads shouldnt make babies, 
  guessing we saw this in the same place , that entire thread was just something out of this world . 
  as with most of these charts they are very inconsitent even in their own logic . 
  they once conducted a survey which showed that a large amount of millennials were open to a socialist or communist president . 
  they then said how the youth needs to be more educated about the dangers of collectivism . 
  well you have much to learn then . 
  most of this sub 's users are communists . 
  and that is not a bad thing . 
  i hope you are joking . 
  bernie sanders is n't a socialist . 
  he 's a social democrat , but still better than liberals and conservatives for me . 
  depends how you got your money . 
  obviously a capitalist ( people who own the means of production ) got it by exploiting the workers . 
  it 's not the question whether a person is rich or not , it is about how they amassed that wealth through exploitation or maybe they were just born with it . 
  besides wealth redistribution is n't really important as a priority . 
  it is extending democracy to the workplace . 
  i 'm just explaining to you , i do n't know why you got so charged . 
  since you made a lot of typos , i 'm kind of confused by what you mean in the * voluntary investing of the works * . 
  i guess you mean to say is that the capitalist worked for his money . 
  this is not true in a majority of cases . 
  i think this [ map of the world 's billionaire origins ] ( http://ei.marketwatch.com//multimedia/2016/09/13/photos/ns/mw-ev816_worldm_20160913114603_ns.jpg?uuid=2d55f476-79c9-11e6-8c93-00137241c023 ) kind of explains it . 
  as you can see in the us 28.9 % had directly inherited the wealth and this is not taking into account that many of the company founders ( and other types ) are most likely also from a rich family background . 
  how is democracy in a workplace slothful ? 
  if you oppose class war in general then do you also oppose slave revolts , or the french revolution . 
  marx was n't a fool , whether or not you agree with him is another thing . 
  and i 'm not calling capitalists stupid , since it does n't really indicate anything about intelligence and it is a lazy argument and an ad hominem . 
  so pretty much the man in the high castle . 
  jingoism sure is great till you get conscripted . 
  and if you need more power , you can do this `` educational '' [ test ] ( http://mrose.longwoodteachers.com/8th%20the%20cold%20war%20era/coldwarnotes.htm ), 
  i know it is a habit but do not use ableist language . 
  is a reactionary dipshit not a better insult ? 
  i 'm not an authority . 
  you do n't have to ask me , and yes it is ok . 
  they do n't realize that this sub is our revolutionary territory . 
  communism and fascism are n't at all simmilar . 
  get the pitchforks out !, 
  paging u/pitchforkemporium . 
  wikihow has guides on how to become a dictator with pictures , or how to overthrow a government and start a revolution . 
  so flag burning guides are pretty mild things for them . 
  [ ** trillions ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=konip69r6vg ), 
  they honestly just talk out of their asses all the time . 
  there was a comment that was saying that the problem with marxism is that it is conformist and that everything has to be bland in it and all it would be illegal to wear colorful clothing or some shit like that . 
  they is looking for modern day russian federation - boos . 
  not related to communism . 
  two of the comennts are also ads for apple .

  hey , you got ta problem with hitler , you have a problem with me . 
  at the end of the first world war there was a failed communist revolution in germany . 
  the social democrats united with the right to stop the revolution and secure power . 
  at the end they shot rosa luxemburg and threw her body into a river .

  the socialist party of serbia is the successor party , they are the ones you should watch out for . 
  r/badpolitics r/badeconomics r/badphilosophy almost a bingo . 
  you cant just tease us like that with your german empire without showing us a map . 
  it is all written by an assassin buddy named shaun and he is like this in every game . 
  he was a red coat apologist in ac 3 because he is british . 
  that looks a bit sketchy . 
  have you got a source, 
  the vannu are just space hippies who like wearing futuristic spandex . 
  the new conglomerate is the ancapistan of space who think they are the descendants of the texan section of the tea party .
