  holy shit is return from audience legal ? 
  good old roof , always on djoko side . 
  i went to make a coffee and missed first set ... 
  it always is . 
  yea , but still playing head to head with the best in semis and finals of clay . 
  samo toliko . 
  nema nasta . 
  cek da se pojavi radule thread , nemas sanse . 
  ali mu kazes `` its just a prank '' . 
  best thing about this video is rubicks name . 
  iddqd was god/invulnerability code in doom 1 . 
  isnt isis fuel money sufficient ? 
  dublin regulation doesnt override un refugee resolutions . 
  no , it gives right for refugees to pick country they consider safe . 
   no , thats why we have refugees all over europe , they literally can pick safe country and we have to follow protocols and grant them safe passage . 
  ask yourself , why didnt eu stoped them at greece or bulgaria if its something thats legal . 
  we never romanticize western politicians cause of those exact reasons . 
  actually one of putin goals is making of kurdistan , new friendly country in the region is never a bad thing . 
  especially if it pisses off lunatic in charge of turkey . 
  im from serbia so i pretty much followed . 
  they were registered here , and we had to give them safe passage to hungary , and after fence to organize transport to croatia.that wall at hungary border is almost fascism . 
  you cant stop refugees.they come at registration station , they declare they are on their way to germany/austria/sweden and you have to let them pass.eu could say dont let anyone in , but they didnt . 
   except the pro-gmo ones have all been peer-reviewed and the wide scientific community agree that they are safe . 
  so many lies in this statement . 
  im not really into debating anything with you , its like talking about moral with murderers . 
  you didnt understood me , you are the kind of people that should be completely ignored and thats that.spread your agenda in your little us circles , rest of the world wont hear of this shit .

   `` country implementing socialist , authoritarian economic policies shocked to receive socialist , authoritarian economic consequences . '', 
  when intentionally pressured by corporate capitalism from same continent . 
  america is the problem , not their socialism . 
  hyperinflation and hell , why not , self isolation , is the way to go to have healthy socialistic policies after some time . 
  muricans are in denial of it , they choose to not see it . 
  [ this kind of shit ] ( https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_800_800/aaeaaqaaaaaaaanzaaaajdk2mte2y2vkltc1yzctndvkos04njkzlwm0ymi4nzm4mzcwmq.jpg ), 
  it works for all europe but you say its bad its bad.no . 
  coprorate bullshit you sell as capitalism is bad . 
  man , man , man , exact same shit you were doing to cuba in public , you are now doing to everyone with cloak and dagger kind of bullshit . 
  actually this is more about countries that are not in nato or eu yet . 
  you derailing fam , like us in syria . 
  nice derailing there . 
  see ? 
   wow , reading that article makes it sound like goldman sachs is blowing the whistle . 
  many people know our financial markets are now heavily manipulated but to hear it from one of the largest financial institutions is scary . 
  dont worry , they figured out some even more destructive shit . 
  that weather effect should be called 40fpsweather .

   the arcana was just a way to keep the old model as an option, 
  this should be done for 1 true king . 
  it brings money when legal . 
  its a spear !!, 
  pa normalno . 
  sad cu bas da se nadvikujem sa sremsko mitrovackim studentima . 
  nema . 
  man , if putin is pushed further by erdogan , there will be this in short sequence :, 
  turkey out of nato ( not even necesary cause nato will not even blink when russia makes moves ), 
  and, 
  another wave of refugees for eu , this time turks . 
  kao da vidim komentar sa r/europe,

  1945 berlin would like to have a word with you . 
  i can bet bbc staff isnt included in this . 
   pkk has a long history of targeting turkish military personnel shuttles while isis has never attacked a military target . 
  why would they attack number 1 buyer of their blood oil ? 
  turkey is in some deep shit man ... 
   the turkish government is n't buying any of the isis oil , at least not directly . 
  gouverment smuggling is still smuggling . 
  something something resili smo da najebemo i od rusije kolko mi se cini .

  i5 8gigs of with gtx 770 ? no wai . 
  he not wrong tough . 
  bots doing propaganda are not problem here . 
  people like you that are willingly blind to the fact that us , turkey and sa with support of some eu countries are going full retard in middle east while russia is de facto good guy there , are problem . 
  well , he did look bad compared to putin in syria.do what putin does , you cant go wrong . 
  why the hell is this guy downvoted ? 
  man , r/worldnews is in full monkey shit throwing mode like r/europe, 
  now waiting for bi to expand their article with this . 
  plot twist : he is the guy in picture . 
  part of this , part of that and a big ass chunk of turkey would do it . 
   this is why the us should n't do anything . 
  you should do alot of things , but for starters stop starting shit all over middle east . 
  before starting bombing isis you should have not invaded iraq but ye keep turning head on that particular detail , let alone all of the `` springs '' in northern africa . 
  neko mora i to da organizuje jbg ...
