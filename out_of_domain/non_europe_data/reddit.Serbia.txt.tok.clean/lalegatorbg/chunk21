  it wasnt hard to guess to begin with . 
   then i 'm sorry to say but kosovo is pretty much already an independant state . 
  like i said , they sidestepped 1244 by announcing independance as `` representatives of the people of kosovo '' , not as kovoso 's legislature . 
  serbia even went to the icj , who ruled in kosovo 's favor :, 
  only security council with follow up un vote can change kosovo and metohija status.u cant debunk legislation signed by un with court that is far under the scope of it , even if its made by same un . 
  think it like supreme court decision is battled out in some civil court cause civil courts decision suits you more . 
  think again , why the heck would `` kosovo '' still be a thing , for 17 years , if they can just be fully independent ? 
   kosovo is recognised by all it 's neighbours ( except serbia ), 
  by all eu/nato colonies , yes , ima aware of that , its not recognized however by countries that are 1 border away from serbia and are much more influential eu/nato members . 
   almost all of the eu , us , canada and australia, 
  cause independent kosovo with nato base is their goal to begin with?right?they dont support it cause its some moral thing to do , they support it cause they are pretty much the most involved factor . 
   russia and china object , which has nothing to do with kosovo/serbia specifically but rather the fact that russia and china are themselves wary of territories within their countries who , if they recognised kosovo , might say `` why ca n't we be independent as well ? '', 
  well could be the case , but still , like eu , us , canada and australia have their own interest , same goes for russia , china and serbia . 
  its a tug of war now , and it would be far more easier for nato and everyone who wants independent `` kosovo '' if that war didnt have to happen . 
  you still didnt answer . 
  i cant do edgy post at all ... i give up . 
  but you have wet carpet now , good for you !, 
   it 's not happening fast , but kosovo is getting there , and serbia is making more and more concessions . 
  its a waiting game , mafiozo state like `` kosovo '' will die off as soon as fabricated suport for stops.they are like ethnic cleansing place waiting to happen . 
  this happened , and im sure ukraine was `` advised '' from some foreign country that that kind of `` incident '' would boost support for ukraine in was with rebels . 
  not that this kind of shit didint happen anywhere else before . 
  edit : nato bots are here .

  for this yes , gameplay was way too off from homm 3 for my taste . 
  so , bmw is a nono for you even as a gift , cause , you know , genocide ? 
  well you cant really explain the difference of 4k gaming and unlimited fps to people who dont have any . 
  i will say this again and again , some sectors of public service and infrastructure should not be privatized . 
  serbia , government isp ,12 e monthly for 50/2mb unlimited data . 
  its like screwing a supermodel , but deciding its better to masturbate . 
  gledam video , jedem kokice , suza suzu stize . 
   i 'm not anti-serb by any stretch , i just do n't consider myself serb . 
  you know how irish guy lands in boston , us in 1800-something and his offspring today is proud of his irish heritage ? 
  yes , he is american now , but he neither doubts his roots nor he is trying to prove to anyone that his nationality is actually `` bostoner '' and not irish . 
  edit : i can understand you if your case include your family having no relations to serbia whatsoever , only in that case . 
  the ones who u should ask for forgiveness and apologize to are not the live ones .

  [ de me nadje ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fybzujg6n6u ), 
  well if you do n't follow mannila predictions from merlini , thats about 9e less than you planned, 
  thats the merlini path . 
  man , im not sure you know how we went with merlini predictions in shanghai . 
  you have 7 more days for predictions , so wait some `` proper '' prediction analysis . 
  edit : front page https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx3yqtq5e5w, 
  that dark ages , although 5.84 kinda settled dota for me . 
   no way in hell i 'm paying for the new hero to be released . 
  its actually old hero . 
  wisdom of crowd does n't apply to reddit . 
  well 99 % of time is just better to only purge with canceling . 
  buddy of mine who have like almost 4k games , said and i quote :, 
  `` lol who have time to read patch notes ?! '', 
  no , i recently started with dota , and information about pitlord is kinda everywhere . 
  new map and weather effects from past ti ( looking at darude weather and pestilence ) work alot better in vulkan than in dx . 
   do share the method of how if you 're not talking out of your ass . 
  that was kinda rude since there is a whole map preview for everyone to test . 
   i have a steady 110fps on the normal map . 
  the new immortal map goes between 70-90 and everything feels very choppy,

   gaben calls the employee : ... 
  i need that balls !!!, 
  this alone will pushback pitlord for a year or 2 . 
  im still sure that was a typo thing . 
  immortal 2 wont save sales , immortal 1.5 with better level distribution would . 
  conspiracy theories?venezuela is going through same exact stuff like serbia did 20 years ago for same reasons . 
  refusing to sellout national industry to foreign investors.nothing else.venezuela would not collapse without huge pressure from abroad . 
  u are clearly not aware how us corporate business can handle less developed countries that have good competative industry . 
  i dont see any motive in that / s, 
   but socialism 's track record is a very clear road of utter failure . 
  where did socialism led to failure on its own ? 
  see sfry for 50 years of constant progress in socialism , and see what happens when capitalism want share from it . 
   this explanation is that socialism is utterly flawed , which anyone with a modicum of knowledge regarding human nature would be able to predict . 
  yap , but how can you predict?its quite simple , capitalism wants to buyout socialism , no matter the costs . 
  see venezuela and how poeple from this sub mock them and project some kind of superiority cause they themselfs live in a society that would crumble if world didnt have easy prey countries like venezuela is . 
  but no , when u see obvious pattern with completely logical motive behind it , you are called conspiracy theorists or shill . 
  i believe that hussein , chavez , maduro , gaddafi and hitler can rule venezula together in `` peace and prosperity '' if they let oil industry to be privatized . 
  this aint strawmaning , you are acting like a biggot.i actually live in a country that went trough same exact stuff and i can tell you what will happen in venezuela in 10 years period from now.its that much of a pattern . 
  on a side note , that pattern from 1990 happened atleast 15 times so far , always same stuff always same goal and always the democracy is `` fixing '' it . 
  its daylight country robbery son . 
   well , you make observations on how people react to stimuli , and then you predict based off of patterns . 
  dont halfarse quote.it make you seems unsmart . 
   socialism barely makes a dent in the thought process of capitalists . 
  socialism fails on its own merits and lack thereof . 
  complete biggotism .
