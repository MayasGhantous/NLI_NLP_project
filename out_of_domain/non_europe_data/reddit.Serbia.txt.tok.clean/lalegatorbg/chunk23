  its really nice for archviz jobs , the ammount of time needed to make animation of this or somewhat better quality , is like comparing weeks of rendering to seconds of rendering . 
  so they are releasing something thats is sub amd480 next year ? 
  somewhat budget pc is going to compete in next month with nextgen console that will be released within year/year and a half . 
  wth are they trying to do here ? 
  it will be underpowered within a month.they project to launch it late next year .

  false advertising jbg , ako nema mleka nemere da bude sir . 
  i listened to miracle so i dont have to care . 
  300e for sure in my country . 
  but when i look at prices of 1070 here its kinda cheap . 
  you are kinda overreacting with framerates . 
  480 will push everything on 1080p 60fps . 
  if not , buy one more . 
  well yea but here is different kind of issue . 
  if we talk about 1080p 60fps gaming as optimum for 480 it doesnt matter if your cpu bottleneck dozen of frames above 60fps that are semi redundant and not as obvious as 30 to 60fps jump . 
  i responded for that quote only . 
  you will have to make a serious blunder in your build with 480 to make it bottleneck.like amd phenom or cyrix cpu . 
  what about it ? 
  unplayable?really ? 
  30-60 is really really noticable . 
  60 to 120 is kinda noticable for sure but to say 60 is unplayable is snobism . 
  film se posrao na sva desavanja u drustvu tih godina i sam po sebi nije anti milosevic film . 
  yes , snobbish and unplayable . 
  this sounds better . 
  no i just hate delusional elitist shits like you , not hard to understand , walk along . 
  you dont see that , you are just elitist douchbag.you dropped your controller yesterday and going full retard mode here to explain yourself . 
  stop trying . 
  stalin . 
  144hz , and while difference is noticable , leap from 30 to 60 is way more noticable in games than anything about 60 + - . 
  think it like this, 
  from 30 to 60 removes/drastically reduce obvious choppiness . 
  from 60 to anything above your screen can deliver is only smoothing effect.cause clear visible choppiness is long gone . 
  if you knew anything about this subject , you would know that you can have pretty shitty vision , but that doesn influence your frame per second capabilites , it just affect the clarity of what you actually see . 
  edit : i have to speak bad english cause you are unable to communicate outside neglish boundaries .
