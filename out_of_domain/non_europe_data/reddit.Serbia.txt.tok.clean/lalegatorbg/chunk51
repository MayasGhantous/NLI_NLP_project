   but not calling him important to the sc2 community, 
  i chuckled at notion of him being high tier player of sc2.what he did with his sc2 casting career was different story and his funday monday videos arent really that much of an impact . 
  i dont hate sean , i hate his followers that make him popular without really doing anything concrete and now roseglassing him into dota scene he have nothing to do with at all . 
  tasteless made the paved the way for western esports is what im saying . 
  its not tasteless switching from sc to heathstone to dota cause 2 first games flunked in numbers . 
  i would argue that guy like husky did more work than day9 for early sc2 scene . 
  one never got traction not cause he was bad , but because he didnt have his personal tasteless . 
   him playing other games does n't disqualify his previous work . 
  this would be true if he made switch one time.he is seeking proffesional career in casting and he just jumps boats for 1 or 2 things . 
  either game is duying ( sc2 ) or he cant make enough from it ( hearthstone ) . 
  i bet that only reason he came to dota 2 is simple oversaturation of tryhard casters in league .

  never in this frequency tough.i can name you 1 game in last like 50 where obviously more skilled carry carried the game like back in the day while rest of the games were 10 muppets group up and exchange cooldowns and take towers , repeating troughout the match . 
  i bitched about 7.00 but it looks ok but feels very very different than what we were used to for hellofalong time .

   the problem is that your idiocracy is affecting the rest of the world . 
  like liberal idiocracy didnt affect the world at all and it was all good amirite . 
  that 's not free healthcare , that 's regional thing that depends not even from state you live in but by city.check european meaning of free healthcare . 
  i love your compassion for your fellow countryman who do n't have access to it.very liberal of you . 
   and the right to have abortions . 
  2 things . 
  you can be responsible adult, 
  second, 
  nobody is abolishing abortions.what they want to do is not make abortions a form of contraception like it is considered in today `` progressive '' world . 
  you sure you are on right chain ? 
  my god , this shit is upvoted ... 
  i can play that gender game . 
  clearly not a responsible woman . 
  you sound like a irresponsible woman tough , i cant differentiate trough internet .

  not the easiest masturbation . 
  and masturbate, 
  i do believe that direct will of the people still overrides couple of easily bribed judges . 
  like , the fact that they are overruling majority decision ? 
   they could ignore british law and circumvent the parliamentary vote . 
  that was the point of referendum , to ask people not the institutions . 
  mhm , what did people say?what are those judges trying to do now ? 
  i 'm not brit , i watch this as outsider , it just looks like some shady tactics, 
  pazi sad . 
  edit : kakav ninja edit ? 
  i found a judge guys, 
  trend in this world nowadays , doubt everything . 
  also , i tend not to trust top rated comments on this site and bandwaggoning of any sort . 
  if people said what they want , every hurdle to that by government is institution terror . 
   he fact that they are all saying the same thing , though , should probably encourage to further investigate that thing rather than just ignoring it in favour of what you decided based on the headline, 
  its not the headline , its the intensity of bit by bit reducing of influence of brexit vote . 
  he was charged by the hour most probably . 
  its not like they completely changed the map or anything . 
  ofc shit is borked . 
  i only blame valve for not introducing 7.00 as beta program . 
  forcing pros to play on this mess is very questionable .

  wrong place to search logic . 
  what does that have to do with possible solution from cyborgmatt ? 
  just balance the freaking map.rework it again . 
  piss off please .
