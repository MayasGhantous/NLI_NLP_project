  apart from cold war thing but still it was hot even then . 
  its not your opinion , its your unnecessary shitting on guys work . 
  if there is anyone playing bots , he did great job . 
  you do n't have to be vocal about everything , you could just keep it shut and move along . 
  i usually mistake juggernaut arcana for armor of the unyielding mask without helm and with added sound effects . 
  did n't you say volvo that collector items wont be available anywhere ? 
   she does n't call out trump anymore than she calls out britain and russia . 
  well , if we are picking side , pick any of the three over that that ~ ~ are ~ ~ were nazi oriented . 
   it 's literally illegal to show homosexuality in a positive light in the rest of russia . 
  start there , at least ? 
  i do n't see anything wrong with that . 
  just because west suddenly adopted gay everything in last decade or 2 does n't mean whole world needs to adapt . 
  if gay rights were oppressed all over the world then we could talk , but forcing `` new stuff '' into traditional society like russian is , is not good . 
  that comment is so 2010 , no offence . 
  really some balls saying that in paris to your guest . 
  looks like reddit troll safe version of being badass . 
  `` in the jit the netherlands public prosecutor 's office and the dutch national police work together with police and judicial authorities of australia , belgium , malaysia and ukraine . '', 
  very unbiased crew there , funny how there are not any authorities from accused party . 
  why you linked his youtube channel ? 
  its the guy who played doom for polygon review i think, 
  the questions is , what was sumails tought process for that blink, 
  its a feature for a good while , i dont understand why you downvote him . 
  its like purging guardian angel + repel prepatch . 
  `` nationwide protests '', 
  100 people here ,50 people there that is 3000 km apart = nationwide, 
  '' ** us ** condemns russia for protest arrests , ** says people deserve ` transparent and accountable governance ** ' '', 
  you do understand she and gay president are like the most hated people that rule the country with around 25 % of public support but with blessing of western countries ... 
  both of them are already marked as freakshow of this country . 
   it 's not being enforced, 
  it 's enforced in serbia, 
  here in serbia, 
   enjoy the sound of a million assholes crying . \\, 
  we didnt send army anywhere yet , chill . 
  also , guess what group can walk in town only under 10.000 policeman ? 
  oh the western values, 
  progress would be ban of that shit . 
   i can assure you that for lgbt people , being able to love someone without being kicked out of your family ,, 
  you will still be kicked out of family , you will still fear more then average heterosexual of being beaten , everything remains the same apart the fact you successfully annoyed majority of population and cost governemt some money . 
  its easier for gays to accept the animosity of heterosexuals that will be there whatever laws and directives come from top or abroad . 
  on a side note , go fucking plant some trees/do charity work/whatfuckingever apart of bare ass parading and blocking cities . 
  that could get you accepted in societies far faster . 
  gay movements like this are the reason they are hated , if you read my comment to the end , you would see that i said what gays should do instead of parading . 
  also , you really cant make anyone not hate you and just because this parade thing is pushed by kiev officials backed with pressure/money from west is not making hate less , on the contrary . 
  if you are gay you should act like a human being , not think that you are entitled by any stretch of imagination . 
  i really do n't know what the fuck gave you the right and gave gays the special status above everyone else.i probably missed this segregation of heterosexuals and worldwide resolution that you ca n't say you do n't like something or that you hate something . 
  that being told , i really loathe loud , annoying gays . 
   you can parade your beautiful ass once every year ( or week ) and still be helpful to society the rest of the time . 
  but let 's be honest , if homophobia did n't exist , people would n't feel the need to be ` liberated ' at an event like this . 
  i do n't see any particular non sexual action performed by gays thought year . 
  and i do n't understand how can you feel liberated when there is like 10-100 times more policeman protecting you from the society you live in . 
  ukraine since maidan resembles serbia since 2000 . overthrow . 
  like everything happens in same pattern , and its really funny to see the same exact abroad pressure and reaction of the citizens . 
  cause its really easy to think by that i hate gay people in general and i am the bad guy now . 
  listen , i dont care what you think.gays have polar bear protection , that should change , they didnt deserve it with anything.taking cock up your ass doesnt make you special snoflake , just gay.thats that . 
  lets talk in 2021 then . 
  it can be both . 
  i want bacon breakfast tweet . 
   that 's idiotic , would you think it 's funny if it happened in the uk ? 
  with the amount of rainy days in uk , i really doubt that could happen . 
  he killed the joy of watching e3, 
  it was always the price for performance that was the key to amd/ati and me personally.if i can get 1070 + performance for good chunk of money less , its great and who have the fastest chip for x price does n't matter at all . 
  who have the fastest chip is only important for fanboys in the end . 
  look what is amd doing to intel on other front with same principle . 
  you have nvidia for your demands.you do n't have to stick to amd just because you want top of the top . 
  for the majority of consumers , give best possible performance per $ . 
  and cpu market is not different story . 
  intel have the fastest cpu , amd kills with value . 
   yeah you know thing is i bought a free sync monitor for 750 $ one year ago . 
  that 's why i care . 
  mhm , lets blame amd business model and position cause you made 1 bad purchase choice . 
  and , from what i know , you could say turn everything to low in whatever you play and reach those fps you are after even with previous generation of amd cards , not even in crossfire . 
  got rx560 2gb in my country for 120e aaaaaand that was hell of a bargain . 
  i dont know what you are on about here.most and i mean like 90 % + of gamers are making complete rigs for the price that few are ready to pay for 1080/ti . 
  you do have option to get top notch gpu and not to skimp out on main component for playing games.its called nvidia . 
  its the exactly same ryzen principle people miss out here.you as a business dont beat nvidia by doing r&d of chip that would be faster with budget god knows how many times smaller than they have.you stick to segment of the market that makes money and thats that . 
   it 's obvious people are sick and tired of the proverbial `` bang for your buck '' and at least want the option to choose to go big and pay more . 
  rx470/480 before mining craze were the cards to go and in that price range that matter the most to biggest part of gaming community . 
  only entitled few who are fanboying amd have problem with current situation cause they dont understand how things work and that there is no magic here that will make amd getting into gpu lead . 
  rest either do n't need the horsepower this sub is dreaming of or go nvidia . 
  i maybe have some kind of reading comprehension but thanks !, 
  to test the willpower and faith of this sub . 
  well russia is acting like superpower and its interfering with elections , even with us election . 
  whatugonnadoaboutism apart of whining on reddit ? 
  amd is not to blame for lack of intelligence or budget sanity of buyers . 
  if they flop cause of that , they wont be nor first nor last , they did chose the right strategy to fight with current situation and market will tell the story . 
  all balkan countries , ukraine , iraq , lybia , afganistan just to name a few, 
  casual at best . 
  lets see what germans really think about this mess . 
  sort by controversial, 
  how is putin to blame here?like he phone called this guys directly and said like break his arms and legs and shit ? 
  also , if this russians tortured random guy from syria , yea fuck them . 
  if this guy was caught and identified like isis member , i really hate the fact the missed alot of time with that hammer . 
  its margins or market . 
  i will probably do the same , i just aim at budget 1070 + performance . 
  fingers crossed for nice price on that . 
  listen i saw just enough of liveleak shit from that isis crew to actually dont give a flying f what happens to them if they are caught, 
  butbutbut nvidia is faster who cares that amd is again price for performance king . 
   because the quadros are workstation cards and game just fine lmao . 
  this would make sense if amd used nvidia technology in making gpus . 
  based on bitching on this sub or actuall facts ?
