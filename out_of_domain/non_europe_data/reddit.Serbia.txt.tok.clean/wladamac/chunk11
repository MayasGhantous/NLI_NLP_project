  i dont know what that is, 
  language , of course ... 
  if you want a truly friendly opinion , never fake emotions . 
  fake other stuff , like arguments . 
  im a danksexual girl and i only get off to dank maymay, 
  help , i am on my iphone , how do i open this ? 
  hey you, 
  pm her next time . 
  that was not a nice, 
  unfortunately , there will have to be either separate languages for serbian and croatian , or the serbocroatian language , that is not used by anyone anymore . 
  then again , we have a situation where the arabic studied is modern standard arabic which nobody actually speaks , it only serves as a bridge for the dialects , so the serbocroatian language might be a best solution in my opinion . 
  and the flag could be yugoslavian : /, 
  edit : btw , i had already sent one application to the incubator about willing to help and moderate in serbian , but i guess they didnt take me seriously , or they arent planning on releasing it soon . 
  i hope i hear news about it some day and do my best to help build it, 
  together we can play some rock and roll, 
  do you fight for your right to poop on the streets ? 
  i think it was from 4chan, 
  heil shrek, 
  what are you talking about , everything is in perfect accordance, 
  you must expect a prize of some sort right now , but all we have is lots of dicks and nothing else, 
  there is nothing wrong with incest, 
  how do bottles of piss fit into this meme , i dont understand . 
  was there someone who actually does this ? 
  i think this all wouldnt have happened if you had written ` should have stopped ' instead of ` should of stopped ', 
  is the prevalence of westerners mastering eastern asian languages higher ? 
  that does not mean its incomparable , dude , i just asked about the mastery , which is the end result , and its either higher or lower or the same .

  x\u0110, 
  now suck each other 's dicks, 
  honestly , the only answer im interested in is whether or not hindi for english will be released , and how soon , but as i understood , they dont know that either , because if they did , they would have told us by now . 
  are you guys sure you 're unrelated ? 
  you look kind of similar at first glance, 
  this is a good question , because ammonia technically does not have a smell , for the most part , it is mainly an irritating agent . 
  also , have you found other substances that irritate you without necessarily smelling bad ? 
  it 's the only thing i 've ever known, 
  sure , why not, 
  any insight on when you guys might start building it in the incubator ? 
  perhaps some time this year ?

  [ izvoli ] ( http://www.amazon.com/images-you-should-not-masturbate/dp/0399536493 ), 
  ( btw i am 21 so you dont need to be formal with me hehe ), 
  hm , i will try to explain it to you in english for you to understand better instead of replying to you in serbian . 
  you see , when using the words ` in ' and ` on ' in not only serbian , but other slavic languages , and even german ( most likely a lot of other indo-european languages too ) , you can put them either in dative or accusative forms . 
  the dative form of in would mean that the action is indirect , and happening inside of the noun bound with ` in ' ( u ) : u australij ** i ** - in australia , as in inside of it . 
  the accusative form means the action is direct , and it is in fact relating to the very noun , in which the noun is the end goal . 
  an example with this would be something like ` udario me je u glav ** u ** ' - ` he hit me in the head ' . 
  there is this one trick thats not in 100 % accordance with the grammar rules , but would help you a lot to at least grasp the basics . 
  just think of dative ` u ' as ` in ' in english , and the accusative ` u ' as ` into ' in english . 
  in means that the action is taking place inside the marked noun , and into implies that the action heading towards the noun . 
  example : ` in my body ' - ' u mo ** m ** tel ** u ** ' ( the reaction is taking place in my body ) , and ` into my body ' - ' u mo ** je ** tel ** o ** ' ( the needle is going into my body ' . 
  same works with the preposition ` on ' ` na ' , the exact same principle . 
  hope i helped . 
  haha no , in both first and your second example you would use the dative . 
  accusative would be used in cases like ` ja idem u ameriku ' ' i am going ** to ** ( like , as in ` into ' ) america ' , ` ja vidim ameriku ' - ' i see america ' . 
  in this case , we use accusative because that is the object you are looking at , dative is never the object of direct action , and nominative is always the subject . 
  so if you still dont really understand , lets try it this way . 
  in the sentence ` there was an * earthquake * in * america * ' , can tell me which of these words appears to you like the direct object ( the word in which the point of the sentence is being made ) and which like the indirect one ( the word that is technically an object , but only as a modification to the real point ) ? 
  well in this case , the accusative would be ` earthquake ' , since this is the essence of the message youre trying to send , and the dative would be ` america ' , as it only purpose in the sentence to clarify things about the real , the direct object . 
  now , if you understood this , let me go over something else that you might have a problem with . 
  you will need to understand the direct and indirect objects very well in case you come across a sentence where there is only an indirect one . 
  i will try to give you an example . 
  ' i am giving to stojko ' - ` ja dajem stojku ' . 
  what happened here ? 
  there is only a subject ( ja/i ) , and the verb , and the indirect object . 
  well if you understood what i was talking about in the first paragraph , you 'd notice that the direct object is missing , which is kind of easy to tell , as the sentence does sound like there is something wrong with it , like what the hell am i giving ? 
  why would i leave that out ? 
  well if you did ask yourself that question , you might be closer to understanding how this goes . 
  i could be giving him a sock or a bee , but for some reason the speaker decided it is unnecessary information , so we dont know what is being given . 
  even if that is the essence in the meaning , it is left out . 
  instead we know some attribute about the object given , and that is `` to whom '' . 
  i could literally go on about this for hours , the only thing annoying is that it takes much longer to type it out than it would take me to say it in person , but dont hold back in case you need more explanation , hehe, 
  and ignite the fire, 
  do you also happen to have a lot of sand and an army of arrancar ? 
  the apocrine glands of the japanese barely secrete * any unpleasant smells , compared to those of the westerners , and yet they are extremely touchy and sensitive concerning smells,
