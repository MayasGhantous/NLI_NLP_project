  are you a professional 4chan connoisseur ? 
  you need to understand that real life is not like anime , nor tv series , people dont just gush out a liter of blood from a surface cut to the arm or chest . 
  if you ever see somebody next to a pool of blood , know that he 's most likely already in a pre-comatose state and close to being dead, 
  it never ends, 
  but no seriously , you can watch [ another ] ( http://myanimelist.net/anime/11111/another ) or [ shiki ] ( http://myanimelist.net/anime/7724/shiki ) , both are greatr, 
  you are not mistaken , but i am talking about the entire serial altogether , including shippuuden and gaiden , and the ones announced after that, 
  well if you have a problem remembering which characters are on which buttons on only 2 keyboard layouts , im not sure what you 'd say about my 6 layouts that i use for other languages, 
  what is your opinion on the pre-nazi propaganda of 1939 , and in which ways psychologically do you think it affected the german youth ? 
  truth :, 
  if you had a choice to shove either a cucumber or 0.5 kilograms of mayonnaise into your rectum and absolutely could not choose neither , which would you choose ? 
  2 . who do you think is hotter , your mom or your sister ? 
  dare :, 
  draw a penis with a fedora and a cane on your belly , upload on imgur and post the link, 
  did you know you can use shift + alt to change it instantly without dragging your mouse down to the bottom right corner and doing it manually ? 
  a nice person, 
  9/10 , would go raiding england with, 
  you are someone who enjoys drinking alcohol , youre also probably lazy and you like fantasy, 
  youre not a real blonde, 
  deep shit right there, 
  which is 9, 
  good thing that swedes really like talking about ants, 
  hail satin, 
  you forgot, 
   still shitting on streets even in uk, 
   raising family in patriarchy , arranging a marriage for daughters, 
   more western girls to creep up on, 
   people actually give a rats ass about gang rapes here , so need to get more violent , definitely knives , maybe guns, 
   moved out of india , but india did not move out of the heart \u2665, 
   sing `` od bihaca do petrovca seeeela \u266a '' on my way back while driving my trustworthy yugo , which i dont know how it still works, 
  dont forget this pls, 
  [ \u017deleo bih da vam poka\u017eem svima jedan klip ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trl7o2kpqw0 ), 
  i think i might be able to give you a good example of how verbs and personal pronouns work in serbian . 
  what / u/freebiescrap said is all true , though it could be much clearer after these few sentences :, 
  i am ** worthy ** = dostojanstven sam, 
  ** i ** am worthy = ja sam dostojanstven ( ja = i ), 
  so basically there is no way to translate it literary , other than to stress it in the spoken language in order to notice the difference . 
  if you understood how this works , i believe you realize that the first sentence is obviously what you are looking for . 
  i dont know what to tell you , i completely understand what youre getting at , and as the top comment is saying , its pretty much up to you , but if you want to hear about my case , well ... 
  i continued reading bleach knowing that any additions after the final getsuga tensho will be absolute crap , but to be honest , while it is not as good , i wouldnt call it crap , and its not as crap as naruto . 
  that sasuke and naruto friendship shit at the end and the seventh hokage sequal was so shit that i completely stopped with that one while i still continued bleach just for the fun of it . 
  in my mind , bleach has ended , but i still read it for the fun, 
  these are the kinds of things that would only happen in the first world . 
  could any of you imagine such a thing originating from brazil or mexico , where you 'd have other more important things to think about , for example not being sure whether your family would be alive by tomorrow ? 
  no its not , he 's searching for volunteers, 
  well its not like its moving , but its not like it isnt either . 
  its just a pace so slow you dont even bother noticing , and then after a couple of months when you look at it you see it got to 40 % or i dunno , and you say `` oh !, 
  wait , was it always like this or has it moved ? '', 
  kind of like when youre in puberty and your parents dont even notice you growing , but when a stranger turns their attention and says `` oh my , your kid has really grown since the last time i saw him '' , and youre like `` oh yeah , well i kind of live with him so i dont even notice '', 
  thats polish on duolingo, 
  ah , it grew up so quickly :d, 
  anonymous never forgives . 
  did you mean this rule ? 
  i dont see what it has to do with this picture , i think you just wrote a random number . 
  or maybe you werent talking about the rules 4chan made up , but i dont know what other rules are there . 
  actually it wasnt sarcasm , i really am retarded ... (=_, 
  would you have sex if your sister if you werent related to her ? 
  i dunno man , i honestly dont like rosetta stone because its not free , and because you dont really learn all that much from clicking pictures , but these stock images are okay in my opinion . 
  i dont study art , and my standards for photography arent sky-high , i just wan na learn a language , and for that purpose , these are fine . 
  well i was listening to the carolus rex album by sabaton at the time , and there was a swedish course on duolingo ( i wanted to learn any language at the time , didnt care which one ) , and you know how one thing leads to another , and now we 're together , me and swedish \u2665, 
  wow , that was really peculiar . 
  may i ask what is your native language ? 
  the only reason i could think of why your flow sounds so wobbly is that your native language might be an eastern asian tonal language . 
  if not , might you have a fear of making a mistake and its affecting your flow ? 
  this is one of the first things i ever saw on the internet , its about 8 or 9 years old i think, 
  he worked hard for that iq, 
  correct , an iq test would not be an iq test if one could study to prepare for it, 
  ` medve\u0111a usluga ' in serbocroatian , literally the same thing *, 
  the lyrics of this song are another reference that came to my mind, 
  i remember when i was a kid and he was funny . 
  its so sad to see him like this . 
  to be honest , this can pass as funny to me if i consider that it wasnt meant to be serious, 
  who just happens to be fat according to my taste , and not particularly bloated, 
  if i were a burger , i 'd be scared of robbing this guy . 
  he seems to have deadly skills, 
  `` sure thing , do you want to see my pet ant later , his name is thomas '', 
  and bosian too, 
  is that a fucking language or are these people just making random drunk noises ? 
  while this tends to happen in underdeveloped places of the world , i am very curious why its making world news . 
  what is so special about india that would make the western journalism want to turn their attention to it ? 
  that is so true and so sad . 
  its that guy, 
  hehe, 
  not ugly one bit , just skinny . 
  but it might be fixable , it just depends on what is physiologically making you skinny , which im not sure i can help you with . 
  i just think that working out would not really help you , i 'd say its something in your metabolism or digestive tract , so you 'll have to figure this out on your own . 
  artist 's choice , it does n't make the painting any less valuable . 
  the reason why there isnt any text in most pieces of quality art is because you leave it to the viewer to make up his own idea . 
  this time he just wanted to bring the message directly to us , which is acceptable as it does not stray outside the context, 
  well okay , the value that im mentioning is the power of the image to portray a broader sense of perspective , or the ability to make the interpreter bring out messages himself . 
  and yes , as one of the comments that replied besides mine said , when you have text of any sorts , it narrows down all the possible ideas you could have come up with . 
  so while that is all true , i disagree with his opinion because in this certain scenario , he has not narrowed anything down for me . 
  the text could or could not have been there , but for me its still good with it . 
  and i dont see why my comment had to be downvoted , i was not attacking his viewpoint , i respect it but disagree with it , and i have the right to my own . 
  they are nice both inside and outside the belly, 
  in most cases , finding your wife in the kitchen like this is the hottest thing in the world , but not in this case, 
  well thats not very entertaining, 
  tell her you 'd like to know what her hair smells like in the morning, 
  oooo pa desi be ti, 
  thank u 4 luck my frend good snek, 
  if youre serious about learning it , then you need to know that all of the methods you 'll find on the internet are shitty , and will only waste your time .
