  4.5 / 10 , you dont pass above average for me , sorry, 
  literally nothing , lose weight and you will be an 8.5 / 10, 
  the only rateable picture is the 1st , and that one would be a 6/10 . 
  but i guess it could very well be 3 or 4 or 5 from other angles , who knows . 
  this is lighter on your makeup ? 
  are you a professional clown ? 
  would get high with/10, 
  body 8 . / 10, 
  face 2.5 / 10, 
  6.5 / 10 , i think your jaw is too big , but the rest of the features ( especially your eyes ) are pulling you towards positive, 
  who do you think we are , your personal detectives ? 
  if you want me to dig through your profile so i could rate you , then i wont rate you . 
  do you need any help with posting links ? 
  are you sure youre not 15 ? 
  in any case , 7/10, 
  first picture 6/10 , last picture 8/10 , it just seems like there is a huge difference for some reason . 
  also , be careful with that gun, 
  7.5 / 10 , would squat in the sewers with, 
  you should film yourself and watch the video later , that could help, 
  he had to be wearing a fedora ... 
  song name please ? 
  i donw know about other countries , but india isnt all monotone , its colour only applies to the majority of the federation . 
  it would also be just as likely that someone would make a weed reference to that in the comments . 
  and masturbate, 
  well hello there , fancy seeing you . . again . . 
  if by ideal you mean 10/10 , then no . 
  but it is still very nice, 
  try [ dol ammad ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cakswbwk4se ), 
  i think they classify as both epic and space, 
  germans never fail to amaze . 
  give an example please, 
  do you think you would stand a chance against conor mcgregor ? 
  i dont know if you created a map or posted it from somewhere else , but in case you made it and can fix it , i want to let you know that serbian , bosnian and croatian are the monkey as well . 
  the symbol is called ` majmun\u010de ' , which is a diminutive for monkey ( little monkey ) . 
  so now you know that too, 
  i sure hope swedish starts to get going a little too, 
  `` et '' is anglicism , just like `` compjuter '' is to `` ra\u010dunar '' , so thats not very important to the topic . 
  but i didnt know you guys call it `` manki '' , thats so weird . 
  are you sure its not slang talk that people around you use ? 
  sorry for asking a question like that, 
  for awhile now i think that this sub is basically 50 % / r/polandball and the other 50 % / r/usa _ does_silly_things_and_there_is_also_other_countries_and_they_are_all_balls , but i didnt really have the guts to say it out loud until now . 
  i mean , it used to be about putting international affairs into forms of anthropomorphism and now its just basically ... / r/usa _ does_silly_things . 
  im honestly done with this sub, 
  cool, 
  did you understand any of that ? 
  what did i say in retard language ? 
  no , definitely not `` only cute '' , you can be both , and it seems to me that you are easily able to shift from one to another , so i see no problem, 
  but no really , 9 is pretty close i think, 
  i think you will get much more appreciation for content like that in / r/gaymers, 
  so much cringe in this thread, 
  you cant just assume what the reason is . 
  i agree that its sad whatever it is , but how the fuck do you know why they dressed like that . 
  they look the type of kids that ask suspicious looking men if they sell candy, 
  this one is new to me , can someone tell me if it is worth reading ? 
  what are your impressions ? 
  i will take your word for it . 
  currently im reading lair game and i think it might be one of the best comics i have ever read . 
  after that im gon na do this one , i suppose . 
  i think my mom told me the exact same thing at some point in my life, 
  those girls arent russian , they are serbian, 
  i wonder what he meant by that, 
  what is 2 +2 ? 
  putin is mostly used for psychological-related diseases . 
  dont you know your russian medicine ? 
  ah , i did not know , you see i am serbian , and believe it or not , putin is praised over here as well , we just tend to use him differently . 
  only one i know http://www.reddit.com/r/repressedgonewild, 
  it is how it should be, 
  its like mad father , except in real life . 
  everything is much scarier in real life, 
  i study medicine in ni\u0161 , and i have not heard of student exchange in our faculty so far . 
  not in the other faculties too . 
  i have heard of students leaving ( ofc ) , but not coming . 
  also , you wouldnt wan na come . 
  i have a friend from switzerland with a 9-something average , and even though its against the law , they wont let her study on a national budget , even though she is an almost perfect student , and instead ask her to pay more than serbian students . 
  so i dont know where your boyfriend lives , but ni\u0161 is a no no , not for the reason they treat foreign students , but because of many other reasons too . 
  try novi sad or belgrade , and ** do not ** even consider kragujevac or let alone ... other ... unis . 
  but if you want the most helpful advice , wait until you both get your diploma and go be together somewhere else . 
  i feel like i went back in time by watching this video, 
  and in serbia ( dont know about other places ) , we slap them on the head as many times as the person 's age is , and we make sure that we slap the shit out of the spot between his neck and fresh cut on the final number . 
  sometimes multiple people at once, 
  it is not `` uh , okay '' , it is `` yes , ma'am '', 
  serbocroatian :, 
  * imenjak * - person with whom you share your name ( namesake , yes ) *, 
  * imenik * - phonebook, 
  its awesome for a fact that the picture itself wouldnt really be * that * funny , but the title makes it hilarious , which is fortunately , something that relates to pretty much most of / r/shitduolingosays , unlike other subs , where post titles sometimes lack creativity . 
  that is just something that i wanted to point out which i absolutely love about this sub, 
  i thought this was a complete language learning program , not practice for advanced speakers . 
  i am still a beginner : , (, 
  look , i see you two are already grown and serious adults from what you said , and it is not a matter of ` gf/bf and i think he/she is cheating on me ' problems , which are not really serious or `` mature '' ( so to say ) issues . 
  obviously you are faced by problems that are not up to yourselves but up to the effect the environment pushes on you two and tearing you apart . 
  this may not be what you want to hear , but ditch reddit and do seek out professional assistance . 
  the kind of advice this sub is offering is not suitable for your problems . 
  if you had taken therapy sessions at least once in your life , you would know that they are very long and can not be solved by merely a couple of words . 
  also it is worth paying all the money needed if it could cost you your relationship , and thus your entire life . 
  kako , jel imas sajtove za to ili gledas klipove na youtube-u ? 
  the snake is an illusion, 
  you have the potential to create a new species and do man-kind a great favour . 
  all you need to do is train swimming for as hard as you can during your lifetime , and ensure that at least 4 of your future generations will do the same as you , and after a little while , they will start developing tight skin between the fingers which will allow them to be more accustomed to water . 
  after that what you need to do is to ensure that your distant grand-child will rape at least 200 women and impregnate them with your genes , and voila , in about 50 years a lot of people would be carrying your genes and you would make available for man-kind to conquer oceans . 
  age is just a number , except if she 's underage .
