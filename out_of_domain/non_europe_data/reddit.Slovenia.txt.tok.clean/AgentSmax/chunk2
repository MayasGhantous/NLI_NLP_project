  mohaa , dune 2 , stronghold , stronghold crusader , command & conquer ( original and tiberian sun ) , red alert ( 1 and 2 ) , warcraft 2 , starcraft , street rod , wolfenstein 3d, 
  of course they are . 
  they played bw for 11 years . 
  sc2 has been released for only a year . 
  indeed . 
  sc2 will get better in time . 
  it 's a very young game still . 
  truly balancing the game takes time . 
  i formatted my pc today so i got to reinstall sc2 . 
  it took me 1 hour to install all the updates . 
  i have a 20/20 mbps connection , but i did n't really look at the speed it was downloading at . 
  what ? 
  i do n't see any chat channels on the picture . 
  the only chat channel-ish thing is the party chat . 
  does n't creep spread a little bit randomly ? 
  if so it can explain what happened here . 
  there is no `` how you should watch sc2 '' . 
  there is just `` how i want to watch sc2 '' . 
  do n't speak for everyone . 
  i guess firemen , policemen and other people whose jobs require them to work through sunday are fucked . 
  this is the single best video i have seen in a long time . 
  thank you for the laughs . 
  i like how you state all the bad things you think about him , but a 3 year old post is crossing the line . 
  i thought it was esports ... 
  as andytb said , use amip . 
  here 's a good tutorial on [tl.net ] ( http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=253625 ), 
  to me it seems like the room is full of spies . 
  not live , no . 
  but replays right after the games were played would n't be so bad . 
  no it 's not a flash problem . 
  if you pay attention on youtube you will notice this happens when a commercial pops up so i think it 's more likely that there 's a problem with the google ads api . 
  for me personally it 's call of duty 4 campaign . 
  for some reason that game grabbed me . 
  in addition from playing it because i like playing games it grabbed me with the story . 
  the opening mission set the tone and it never let go . 
  it really made me care for the story . 
  sadly the sequels just could n't compare . 
  i do pretty much the same only i use a handbrake . 
  it 's the most useful thing in the summer . 
  it 's a mirror on wheels ... 
  yeah the paint is ok . 
  it just seems everything got pushed up so i 'm unsure how much i have broken . 
  it happened at night and i only saw the damage in the morning . 
  it made me quiver too . 
  hopefully i did n't do more damage than to a few nuts and bolts . 
  it looks pretty bad from the outside though . 
  i might fix it myself if i have the time . 
  i did n't really jump the curb . 
  it was in a parking lot and i did n't even know i was stuck . 
  i parked it and it seems like it got stuck with the bottom of the bumper . 
  the curb was just the righ height . 
  did n't feel anything in the car . 
  so basically i did that damage with pulling . 
  race traitor ? 
  i just could n't comprehend the stupidity of the comment . 
  i did it once on a high flying pathfinder . 
  felt so good . 
  you 'd have to ban 90 % of the chat if you want to succesfully moderate twitch chat . 
  my point was that twitch chats are usually horrid by making a joke . 
  it was not meant to be taken literally . 
  yeah you could bash with anything there . 
  grenades , satchel charges ... even bazookas . 
  good times . 
  i actually thought it was a play on words : da stor - ur ghetto, 
  from what i 've seen esl has always been horrible with vods . 
  tribes ascend also has the ability to watch tribes related streams and youtube videos ingame . 
  actually they also have spectator mode . 
  but spectators occupy player spots and there 's actually no tournament support . 
  what about tarson ? 
  i 'd also like to add street rod games . 
  i 'd say it 's more likely he does it so more people would understand . 
  if most of ukraine also speaks russian but most of russia does n't speak ukranian it makes sense to speak in russian . 
  technically african . 
  starcraft and brood war outside of korea had more of a niche audience afaik . 
  regarding the last point i think blizzard really hit the nail on the head with starcraft 2 . 
  most of the people watching do n't actively play the game and a lot of them never even tried it . 
  i think it 's a great example that if you go about it the right way an esport can succeed even in the non gaming audience . 
  the only other developer that i know is esports oriented is nadeo with shootmania - and i hope more will come up . 
  ** edit : **, 
  in my opinion one major thing that can really make an esport is giving the tools to the community . 
  it 's what shootmania aims to do and it 's also why starcraft is so succesfull competitively ( blizzard maps usually suck ass ) . 
  i just limited the amount of cores available to t : a, 
  all evidence suggests that tribes ascend is ** horribly ** unoptimized . 
  hmm ... 
  i just might investigate the matter . 
  if that 's really the cause of the problem it may explain why the problem occurs in intervals ... 
  good find . 
  although i still do n't know why only exactly 4 cores . 
  if i put 5 it starts lagging . 
  ** edit : ** context, 
  quite intriguing . 
  that makes a lot of sense . 
  it is quite possible that tribes has some weird issue . 
  from what problems me and my friend encountered trying to play tribes i think i ca n't be surprised anymore , 
  i do hope they optimize the game . 
  i love playing it but sometimes it 's just plain annoying . 
  no harm in joining in i guess . 
  vgca, 
  they could go the sensible route of `` choose what date format you want '' . 
  like most other developers do .
