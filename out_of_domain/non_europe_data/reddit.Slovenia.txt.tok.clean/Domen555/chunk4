  ** general info : **, 
  exogenesis : symphony ( also known as exogenesis ) is a three-part symphonic rock song from muse 's fifth studio album the resistance . 
  it was recorded in 2009 at studio bellini , matt 's former studio near lake como in italy and at officine meccaniche studios in milan . 
  it , as said before , consists of three movements , `` overture '' , `` cross-pollination '' and `` redemption '' , each of them occupying a separate track . 
  the total length of the three movements combined makes up for 13 minutes . 
  the entire piece was first released on 17th april 2010 . 
  the song was influenced , according to matt , by artists such as rachmaninoff , richard strauss , chopin , pink floyd and massive attack . 
  in autumn of 2012 , charless bollfrass , who allegedly contacted the band in 2005 with an `` idea to write a sci-fi rock opera about space travel after the demise of the planet earth '' , filed a $ 3.5 m lawsuit against the record label warner music , claiming that the band ripped him off . 
  the band 's response to the lawsuit stated `` the claim is complete nonsense , and is categorically denied . 
  it appears to be based on a ` screenplay ' which the band never received or saw , produced by someone the band has never heard of . 
  it speaks volumes that the album in question was released a full three years ago , and yet this is the first that has been heard of these groundless allegations . '' . 
  the lawsuit was finally dropped in april 2013 . 
  regarding the live performances , the symphony has never been played live in it 's entirety as of yet . 
  the most commonly performed part was overture which has been performed at nearly every date on the resistance tour . 
  redemption was only played once , in 2013 . 
  during the live performances of overture the band had an ufo-shaped balloon floating above the audience with an acrobat performing acrobatics above the audience . 
  redemption was also used by american figure skater jeremy abbott at the 2011-2012 world championship in nice . 
  in 2012 , a music video for redemption was released , made by japanese artist/animator tekken . 
  the video piece was named `` furiko '' ( pendulum ) .

  [ exogenesis symphony artwork ] ( https://muse-cdn.warnerartists.com/ugc-1/discography/discog/51/120_square.jpg ), 
  ** song meaning : **, 
  `` exogenesis symphony looks at the concept of panspermia . 
  it 's a story of humanity coming to an end and everyone pinning their hopes on a group of astronauts who go out to explore space and spread humanity to another planet . 
  part 1 is a jaded acceptance that civilization will end . 
  part 2 is a desperate hope that sending the astronauts to find and populate other planets will be successful alongside the recognition that this is the last hope . 
  finally , part 3 is when the astronauts realize that it 's just one big cycle , and recognize that unless humanity can change , it will happen all over again . '',

  ** lyrics : **, 
  part 1 ( overture ) :, 
  aping my soul, 
  you stole my overture, 
  trapped in god 's program, 
  oh i ca n't escape, 
  who are we ? 
  where are we ? 
  when are we ? 
  why are we ? 
  who are we ? 
  where are we ? 
  why , why , why ? 
  woah, 
  i ca n't forgive you, 
  and i ca n't forget, 
  who are we ? 
  where are we ? 
  when are we ? 
  why are we ? 
  who are we ? 
  where are we ? 
  when are we ? 
  why are we in here ? 
  part 2 ( cross-pollination ) :, 
  rise above the crowds, 
  and wade through toxic clouds, 
  breach the outer sphere, 
  the edge of all our fears, 
  rest with you, 
  we are counting on you,
