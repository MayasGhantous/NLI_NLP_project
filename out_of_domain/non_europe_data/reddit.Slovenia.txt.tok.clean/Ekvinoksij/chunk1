  dropping off some ballast . 
  that 's why you use median , not average . 
  the former hold true for other places in europe as well . 
  hitch, 
  yeah , but it 's not the 2007 game anymore . 
  it 's taken off in a different direction than rs2 has 2007-2012 has , though . 
  it 's a different game . 
  goodness is feminine in several slavic languages as well . 
  on the other hand , so is death ... 
  well , i suppose someone must or they would n't be airing it . 
  because it 's highly degrading . 
  there 's also the shock factor for the rest . 
  has to set an example . 
  yes , apparently naps during the day go straight to rem . 
  there is a condition where this does in fact occur , but it 's very rare . 
  normally 2 blue eyed people will only have blue eyed children . 
  if you are a heterozygous you have brown eyes . 
  the only way to have blue eyes is to have 2 alleles for blue eyes . 
  apparently he was bad at painting people and good a painting places , buildings etc. 
  they advised him to try at the faculty of architecture , but he chose a different path instead . 
  yeah , you 're right , i 've looked it up and i 'm now eternally disssapointed . 
   another eu country, 
  switzerland is not in the eu . 
  one enters rem pretty much instantly during naps . 
  i have most of my lds while napping . 
  sie is also the plural pronoun . 
  when you form plural imperativ in german you use infinitiv + sie . 
  wrong country much ?

  yugoslavia was a kingdom until 1943 . 
  what , where ? 
  you mean 300km to the east ? 
  meh , no point ... americans and european geography do n't mix well . 
  and yet danes are the happiest nation on earth . 
  no , it 's not a loan ... 
  it 's debt they owe for utilities and telecommunicatons . 
  fucking hell , everyone knows money does n't grow on trees ... 
  they do n't have to sell their house when one of their family members has to spend 3 weeks in the hospital . 
  get it now ? 
  no it does n't . 
  when you 're in this type of debt in croatia your bank account gets frozen and all of your income goes directly to the debt owner .

  i 'd assume that whoever can read nietzsche in german speaks the language rather well . 
  this is not really true , because the rest can import from other eurozone members . 
  language fits . 
  this is either from serbia , bosnia , croatia or slovakia . 
  it says bo\u017ee though , not bo\u017ce, 
  no it 's not .

  i was in a town in flanders , which looked just like this one . 
  was this perhaps taken in a small town around antwerpen ? 
  but it really is n't all that hard ... 
  this is maybe a harder problem for a highschool freshman writing their exam on linear movement , or whatever the field is called in english . 
  i meant that this was easy enough to figure it out without being taught specifically , because it can be described mathematically purely with the help of experiences from everyday life . 
  there 's literally one equation here , which you do n't need to be taught , really . 
  velocity is distance travelled per unit of time . 
  every person deals with speed before they take physics . 
  yeah , but they 're there because a few million germans drive through slovenia each summer just to get to croatia :d, 
  we do n't have booths at all , though . 
  we have the same system as the czechs , austrian s and a few others with vignettes . 
  they 're just expensive if you 're only driving through , because the cheapest one is the 10 day version . 
  croats do use the booth poll though and if you 're going from koper to dubrovnik and back it 'll cost you about 700kn ( $ 100 ) . 
  sure , no problem . 
  we changed the system in 2008 , so if you were here in 2007 or earlier you 're correct and even if you are n't it 's not that much of a mistake , since a very small portion of the trip from the czech republic to croatia is spent in slovenia . 
  i thought it was lance ... 
  crna ruka supported mlada bosna , so you could say it was them , who killed franz ferdinand . 
  bad troll ? 
  we do that when we make [ artificial diamonds ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/synthetic_diamond ) . 
  it requires very high pressures and temperatures . 
  another way to imagine this is the fact that the derivatives of all functions defined as f ( x ) = x ^ 2 + c equal 2x , whether c = 3 , -5 , 0 or any other number . 
  when you look at a derivative it is impossible to say exactly which function you started with and this is transfered to integrals . 
  for example , let 's take a function like g ( x ) = x ^ 2 + 2 . 
  the derivative of this function is g ' ( x ) = 2x . 
  if we make an antiderivative we get x ^ 2 . 
  but because we do n't know , which function we started with , the function has an undefined constant , which is what is denoted by c. therefore , \u222b 2xdx = x ^ 2 + c , because we 've lost that information when we derivated our original function .

  bosniaks are slavic too , by the way . 
  and quite a few slovenes are christian , whereas myself and many others are atheists . 
  religious diversity does not take away a nation 's identity .

  what the analogy is trying to show is that , by doing what he does now , he makes $ 114 every second . 
  if he picked up a $ 100 bill , which would take , say a second as well , he would make $ 14 less that second , because he would have to cease doing what he normaly does to make 114 $ in that second . 
  of course this analogy does n't quite work , because interest does not take an active action to acquire , once your money is invested , but the point comes across regardless .
