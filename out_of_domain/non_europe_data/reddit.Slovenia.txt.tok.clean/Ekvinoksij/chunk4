  how are they male at all , though ? 
  is n't fur color an x trait and this only happens through deactivation of one of the x chromosomes in each cell ? 
  interesting , i queue top/support and got top roughly two thirds of the time in the last 16 games . 
  well , provided you employ people that can sift through the garbage . 
  a popular opinion is not necessarily a good one . 
  i guess it is if you have one fed carry who needs to kill their team or you lose the teamfight . 
  just fyi , poland is a [ very highly developed country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_human_development_index#complete_list_of_countries ) . 
  true . 
  however , having travelled poland quite extensively , i can tell you , that their infrastructure is on par with richer countries , because most of it was extensively modernized and renovated in the last decade or so , at least in and around the bigger/more important cities . 
  it has n't vanished , though . 
  gros michel is still grown in certain parts of the world , however the supply is not large enought to distribute it worldwide . 
  i have been experiencing the same thing . 
  did you try going from fullscreen to windowned and back again ? 
  it worked for me . 
  we 've followed [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfeuwnqtxwu&amp; ) recipe for the eggs , broth and meat but we improvised a bit on the toppings , because we could not get all of them where we live . 
  i tried posting it , but the youtube channel is not approved .

  edit : we 've followed the recipe for the eggs , broth and meat but we improvised a bit on the toppings , because we could not get all of them where we live . 
  another is also , that silane ( sih4 ) , which is the si equivalent of methane , combusts spontaneously in earth 's atmosphere and temperature . 
  well , to come close enough to random , anyway . 
  there will always be remnants of previous arrangements in the physical world .

  that 's pretty brutal , too .

  well , he was paraphrasing , but close enough ... 
  no , this is not true . 
  sodium carbonate is basic because it 's a salt of a strong base and a weak acid . 
  na ^ + will not reassociate into naoh if placed in a water solution . 
  in fact , if it did it would make the water more acidic , because you would be removing hydroxide ions from the solution . 
  op is right . 
  carbonate ions will form carbonic acid in water thus removing free oxonium ions from the solution , increasing the ph. 
  source : chemistry student . 
  here 's the reaciton, 
  na2co3 ( s ) --  2na ^ + ( aq ) + co3 ^ 2 - ( aq ), 
  now there are a bunch of sodium and carbonate ions floating in solution . 
  sodium ions will not from a percipitate of sodium hydroxide , because it is thermodynamically more stable for them to stay dissolved . 
  besides , there are n't many hydroxide ions in the solution at this point anyway . 
  carbonate ions will , however form carbonic acid with water , because they are a strong base , being the conjugate pair of a weak acid . 
  the following reaction takes place :, 
  co3 ^ 2 - + h2o --  hco3 ^ - ( aq ) + oh ^ - ( aq ) < -- this is where the hydroxide anions come from , which i assume is why the link says you get naoh . 
  the following reaction could also take place , but this does n't really happen much , as hco3 ^ - is a much weaker base than co3 ^ 2 - :, 
  hco3 ^ - + h2o --  h2co3 + oh ^ - < -- this reaction gives carbonic acid and another hydroxide ion . 
  h2co3 is quite unstable though , so this is only a theoretical equation, 
  in solution we now have the following molecules and ions :, 
  na ^ + , oh ^ - , h3o ^ + ions , hco3 ^ - ions ( and h2co3 molecules ) . 
  there is no naoh ( aq ) present in the solution . 
  na2co3 can not dissociate into sodium hydroxide , because dissociation is the process of compounds forming their constituent ions in solution , which in the case of sodium carbonate are sodium cations and carbonate anions . 
  the link you posted is not correct . 
  yeah , i 'm just making all of this up ... 
  okay let 's look at this mathematically . 
  hydroxide and oxonium ions are in equillibrium with water at all times . 
  we can express this by saying that :, 
  kw = ( concentration of h3o ^ + ) * ( concetration of oh ^ - ) . 
  at 25 \u00b0 c ( where ph is defined ) kw = 10 ^ -14 . 
  this value is constant no matter what you do with the system as long as the temperature remains constant , which we will assume does . 
  let 's also look at how ph is defined . 
  ph = - log ( concentration ( h ^ + ) ) = - log ( concentration ( h3o ^ + ) ) . 
  this means , that the if we increase the amount of h3o ^ + ions in solution , the amount of oh ^ - ions will decrease as per the first equation . 
  the ph will also decrease following the definition of ph. 
  what you 're saying is that when na2co3 is added to a solution , naoh is formed from the na ^ + that comes from the sodium carbonate and the oh ^ - present in the water solution . 
  okay , now let 's look at what happens to the ph of such a solution . 
  because naoh formed there are now fewer oh ^ - ions in solution . 
  following the constant kw , this means that the amount of h3o ^ + ions has increased and the ph has * decreased * . 
  if what you 're saying were true , adding na2co3 to water would make it more acidic , but it does n't , it makes it more basic , which we can prove experimentally . 
  highly processed flour is still complex carbs . 
  starch is a polysaccharide . 
  right , but it 's still a complex carbohydrate , that was my point . 
  this term gets thrown around all the time , often incorrectly . 
  no , this is not right . 
  grains of sand are made of atoms . 
  more than one . 
  that means that there are more atoms in just the grains of sand than there are grains of sand , not to even mention the whole universe . 
  how am i cofused ? 
  what you said is equivalent to saying there are more baskets full of apples than there are apples , which clearly ca n't be right . 
  okay , you 're either trolling or do n't understand division . 
  true , but this only holds true for glucose . 
  roughly half of the sugar in a modern diet is fructose and humans can not transform fructose to glucose . 
  the excess citrate formed will be turned to fat via de novo lipogenesis , to keep concentrations of tca metabolites constant . 
  exactly , i keep scratching my head over armchair experts on reddit always `` tearing studies to shreds , '' like the people doing the research did n't think of all of that while conducting the study . 
  synthetic how ? 
  because that was meant to be a joke ( originally , anyway , but it stuck , for whatever reason ) . 
  gibanica does not come from the verb to move ( gibati ) , but from the verb to fold ( zgibati ) , which refers to its layered form . 
  the proper translation is something like `` prekmurje layered cake . '',

  ] ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24814559 ), 
  and no one is alive to remember it . 
  right , but the whole stick does not move at the same time . 
  the force you exert on the stick has to travel down the stick and it does so at the speed of sound , which is much slower than the speed of light .

  prions may be resistant to autoclave conditions , due to their high thermal stability . 
  yeah , you do n't really get infected with prions ... you get poisoned and the poison multiplies .

  no , but pokemmo does exist , which is basically the gameboy game , but multiplayer .
