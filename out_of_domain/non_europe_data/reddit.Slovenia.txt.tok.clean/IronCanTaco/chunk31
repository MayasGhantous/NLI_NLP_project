  i do n't know for which series , but i 've calculated that you could run the entire grid with the money red bull is throwing into their f1 team . 
   no one . 
  a gun `` going off while cleaning it '' is the equivalent of `` my dog ate my homework '' . 
  you put too much trust in people . 
  some people really are dumb as a box of rocks . 
  that being said , you should get your gun license taken away for this kind of shit . 
  not really . 
  2017 tires will be a bit heavier due to their size , but not as much that pit crews would need that much more upper body / core strength training . 
  you need to be fast and precise . 
  biggest problem in 2017 will be that they 're working with much larger tires than they 're use to and that 's why they 'll need a lot of practice . 
   ultrasound, 
  hehehe, 
  either way , if ultrasoft lasts the whole race then they need to push harder , 
  this gun has a secret compartment for snacks in the back . 
  i am not kidding . 
  it ejects to the side , but it does n't eject in your face even if you 're lefty, 
  i 'm a lefty , tried holding it in my left arm and it just did n't work for me . 
  had to switch to the right arm . 
  either way , while testing it in left hand , it still did n't eject bullet casings in my face . 
  it ejects them at the front . 
  nda is successful , if you can prove that someone shared company secrets with another company . 
  so ferrari would have to prove how it got to the conclusion that some design idea was worth pursuing and how they got to it, 
  nda does n't last forever . 
  it could , it all depends what you sign . 
  either way , as long as nda is in effect you can not share any secrets , at least not legally . 
  ejector is on the side . 
  it ejects them at an angle at best , but from what i recall it was to the side . 
   if they are going to share eventually what is the point of it ? 
  how effective is it in implementing the spirit of why you need a nda ? 
  without nda someone could walk out of brackley and fly to maranello the same day and tell all about the plans mercedes has for the future and their current design . 
  with information like that , competition can catch up to you quicker and maybe even beat you in the championship . 
  nda prevents all that , at least for a certain period . 
  information on what mercedes plans to do in 2017 wo n't matter in the later stages of 2017 or next year . 
  okay , i think we misunderstood each other . 
  when you mentioned `` forward ejecting '' did you mean [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geyke_ryeus ) ? 
  sure . 
  just like you 're right about every other border dispute you 're in . 
  why the hell do you even come here ? 
  maybe some nice new race suits ? 
  i really like this new pattern although the red bull camo they had in 2016 was n't bad either . 
  seems like journalists are back to scraping the bottom of the barrel after nico and lowe departures . 
  drivers drive to the penultimate corner in australia , the camera shifts to the long straight and is that ... is that wibbah at the front ? 
  seems unreal that it 's been 10 years since kimi won the last wdc for ferrari . 
  somebody hold me ; _ ;, 
  i remember the shift from everyone shitting on kvyat to giving him a shoulder to cry on . 
  * murgle intensifies *, 
  the car looks amazing from every angle . 
  i felt the the same way until i did n't actually drove one . 
  i drove it up a mountain road , parked it at the top and enjoyed the view . 
   slovenians as a whole ( outside of ljubljana ) do not give a fuck about the refugees . 
  people here on reddit will say we love the refugees , this is not true . 
  slovenians just want to be left alone and keep our country to ourselves . 
  you say it like we should be ashamed for wanting our country to ourselves . 
  people have tv , internet , and friends across europe . 
  they see and hear what is going on and they do n't like it one bit , because they do n't want to be afraid to celebrate christmas and i do n't blame them at all . 
  ordinary people did n't want to bomb anything , why should they have to pay the price while politicians live behind big fences and tell them what to do and that everything will be okay . 
  so , if you want someone to blame , blame the governments across europe and european government . 
  they brought in refugees from places that are so different and incompatible with our culture without any long term plan on how to integrate them into our society . 
  there has to be a plan larger than housing them in apartment complex . 
  that 's setting them up to fail . 
  torej so imena fair game ? 
  slept through the date ? 
  they tried system with the same stewards and it did n't work . 
  so if neither thing works , maybe the rules are too complicated for stewards ? 
  selektivna priviligiranost . 
  never underestimate the power of good marketing campaign . 
  getting mentioned in the press is part of the marketing and a lot of developers think it is not important which is why their games flop . 
  people should consider paying a professional to do the marketing because they know what they 're doing and know the people in the business . 
  and it 's rich that it 's coming from ferrari boss marchionne . 
  well they pushed him into retirement as far as i could read between the lines . 
  massa said in an interview that he would love to still race in 2017 , but two weeks later he felt like retiring . 
  because ferrari is the most elitist team on the grid ? 
  odvisno od debate . 
  haha , a to naj bi bil samo \u017eenski problem ? 
  ... zato nimamo niti ene profesorce na nobeni fakulteti ... oh wait we do . 
  vendar so what ? 
  okay , i got $ 3.50 ... anyone else ? 
  wow , thank you for this !, 
  i 'd like to thank you for the amazing wind tunnel video you guys did , too !, 
  please share more stuff like this , we love it , 
  you selfish prick , what about a like on facebook ?? 
  that was the plan . 
   the rules are quite tight on where you get to stand as a fan , most of the time there are just not enough marshalls to marshall every single corner . 
  marshall here with my 5 cents :, 
  i 've been a marshall for a number of years now , even organized a few rally stages and it 's impossible to put a marshall on every corner . 
  we would like to , but there simply is n't enough people and budget is also very limited , so you do the best job with people that you have . 
  however , no matter how many marshalls there are , people still find some spot to get as near as possible to the rally stage . 
  most of the time nothing happens , but then there are incidents like this where the car has bounced up into the air and into the spectator . 
  people who plan rally stages have a lot of experience and have seen a lot of shit go down on the track , so if they say it 's not safe - it 's not . 
  so ** follow their instructions ** and ** do not stay near the road ** . 
  trust me , it 's not worth dying for . 
  intoxicated people are the worst . 
  with most sober spectators you can reason or threaten you 'll call the race director who will bring the police and they 'll haul their ass to jail . 
  intoxicated people do n't care about you , their safety or police . 
  so yeah . 
  i could n't drive on the top of my game with so many people on the side of the road . 
  if literally anything goes wrong and you dive into the crowd there 's at least 20 dead with whoever knows how many injured . 
  i 'm really impressed with how many lives were lost during that time . 
  one of the best comedies of the time and people are unaware of it . 
  torej ... politika as usual ?
