  sometimes you do n't even have to closely analyse the inner workings , you just see that the header is correct from the program 's behaviour . 
  useful for when you 're analysing the fifth function in a 9 function call stack .

  [ ] ( / solved ), 
  ** short version ** : reinstalled win7 on my ssd , which will not boot with the above mentioned error . 
  my second drive wo n't boot with `` insert proper boot device '' also freshly installed win7, 
  ** long version ** : i was `` fixing '' my brothers old-as-time-itself pc , with an ancient motherboard that simply refused to boot from a cd . 
  so me being a genius hooked up the optical drive and the hard drive from the old pc via ide to my own pc that also had a kingston ssd , a 500 gb seagate hdd and a 2tb wd hdd , with an additional external wd usb hdd . 
  along with those are two usb thumbdrives and that is the extent of my storage units , if that 's information to you . 
  anyways after i did that , i managed to boot from an xp cd and after some negotiations/pleading managed to format the ide hdd and installed xp on it . 
  after that i removed the alien gear from my pc and put it back into the old pc . 
  now what 's really funny is two things : i managed not only to somehow screw up my primary drive , but also the pc i was fixing will not boot from the hdd . 
  attempted repairs below . 
  i think i had that problem before , but being the einstein i am , i promptly forgot the solution . 
  i do n't even know if the xp installation had anything to do with this debacle , but i 'm hating on it with passion right now . 
  ** hardware details ** :, 
  * asus p5kc motherboard with ami bios, 
  * dual core e7200 cpu, 
  * 8 gigs of ddr3 ram, 
  * radeon hd4850, 
  * thermaltake toughpower 650w psu, 
  * kingston ssd 60gb sata drive, 
  * seagate hdd 500gb sata drive, 
  * wd external hdd 320gb usb drive, 
  * a - data 4gb usb thumbdrive, 
  * verbatim 32gb usb thumbdrive, 
  ** attempted repairs ** :, 
  * tried to reinstall windows on the ssd from my thumbdrive , to no avail, 
  * tried to fix the windows installation with the windows 7 repair thing , to no avail, 
  * tried to restore to a restore point , to no avail, 
  * tried to run memory scan , which i 'm not even sure did anything, 
  * tried to install windows on the wd 2tb sata drive , which did n't fix the problem , it did however , change the error to `` insert proper boot media '', 
  * tried to revert bios settings to factory defaults , you guessed it ; to no avail, 
  * tried to do [ this procedure ] ( http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/20864-mbr-restore-windows-7-master-boot-record.html ) and i made sure , i had the right drive targetted in the diskpart mode , but i was again disappointed by the severe lack of avail . 
  * tried to bang my head agaist the wall and sacrifice blood to my pc and a led stopped working . 
  i think it did not approve of the blood sacrifice, 
  i 'd like to apologize if the answer is blatantly obvious and on the first site that google shows , but i could not for the life of me find it . 
  i now surrender myself to the mercy of the wise and the brave redditors as i cry myself to sleep , in the darkest corner of my room with only a blanket as my companion . 
  in case you missed it , i 'm pretty damn desperate , so any kind of information might be a life saver at this point . 
  ** update : ** so i managed to figure out why it wo n't boot from the wd hdd and for fun i selected what i thought was the seagate drive and apparently i had drive names mixed up , because the windows is completing the installation on the wd hdd and the error `` insert proper boot media '' was caused by trying to boot from the seagate drive . 
  still do n't know what 's wrong with the ssd , but i 'm staying strong . 
  hope is restored and i 'll try to reformat/killdisk the ssd to get it functioning again . 
  hmm ... why 's the boot manager listing 6 windows 7 installations ? 
  ** update 2 : ** so i tried to unplug all usb devices as suggested , which did n't help , i also updated ssd firmware and reinstalled win7 ( again ) and it did nothing . 
  i am at loss as to what to do next . 
  ** update 3 : ** windows repair disc gave me some hope and crushed it as the error remains `` error loading operating system '' . 
  so i 'm planning to upgrade my mobo to this : [ gigabyte ga-z68xp-ud4 ] ( http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=3977#ov ) . 
  this mobo has , along with the 24 pin power plug , an 8 pin atx ( otherwise knows as eps ) power plug for the cpu . 
  sadly my psu only has the 4 pin atx outlet . 
  i 'm planning on overclocking the cpu as far as i can . 
  is it still possible for me to use the old psu with an adapter or would that render oc impossible ? 
  long story short i twisted a few contacts inside the cpu socket when i was putting in the cpu . 
  lessons learned :, 
  2 - do not try to place your cpu in the socket when the case is in an upright position , it will slip and damage the socket ( the contacts might aswell be made of paper , all of the twisted ones fell off when i tried to straighten them ) . 
  do you reckon there 's a gigabyte workshop that services these kinds of things or am i left with a 200 $ paperweight ? 
  does anyone know of a task manager skin for rainmeter ? 
  a kind that would have the process list and it 's data , like task manager , but with the more rainmeter . 
  as it is now , i got this awesome layout of information and beauty on the left side of the screen and this giant white monstrosity on the right side . 
  does not fit . 
  problem : different units for same descriptives ( length , weight , volume , money etc. ), 
  making it an effort to convert values or steals meaning from a post if that effort is not made . 
  solution : automatic conversions , whenever the script realizes there 's a unit in a post . 
  if i were to write `` 100km '' , it would get tagged and on mouseover a webservice called , to convert to imerial units . 
  benefits : more understanding of `` what the fuck did they mean with 160lbs or 140 degrees outside '' from non-us redditors and vice versa . 
  and let 's face it : we wo n't make the effort to convert shit and just leave the post , while some might have some beneficial input or , even a pun , to add to a thread . 
  losses : bandwidth and processing time . 
  although it can be limited if data is only fetched when the highlighted text ( convertable units text ) is clicked or something . 
  i 'm talking about [ this ] ( http://www.artelgroup.com/images/funz_instal_raffreddati_aria_4_big_eng.jpg ) , where the indoor unit is replaced by a water block . 
  since it 's ac , with the compressor and whatnot , i 'm guessing it should be getting very good temperatures . 
  and the water condensation on the intake pipe could maybe be countered with some heat insulation ? 
  right so i ca n't even begin to wrap my head around this . 
  i have to read qr code ( preferably from the camera , but atm i 'm settling with a png of an aligned , clean qr code ) and preferably write it in text format . 
  what i have done so far :, 
  * captured the image, 
  * turned the image into gray and binary, 
  * found the 3 position markers using contours and moments . 
  now i do n't know how to continue . 
  all the articles i found on the internet are advanced/specification descriptions , the `` tutorials '' i found had code in more classes than i can count and it would take me days to make sense of them . 
  i could live without aligning rotating and fixing the image perspective , as long as i get the basic decoding right . 
  what i 'm thinking now is that i should get the edge x and y of the markers , then the size of the squares by calculating the distance between the marker contours , then i could start reading the data portion in between the markers . 
  just do n't know how to actually do that . 
  ** edit : ** i figured out how to get the bounding rect of a contour , so i 'm gon na use that for approximately , maybe , barely decoding the thing ... hopefully it will work . 
  ** edit ** it kinda works now . 
  it reads the data portion and fails to decode it into string . 
  perhaps i 'll get a point or two for it ( crossing my fingers ) . 
  if you 're interested in my procedure , throw me a pm , maybe i 'll even give you the code . 
  though i would n't recommend even wanting my particular code , since it 's laggy , unreadable and buggy . 
  i ca n't feel my face . 
  peace off . 
  ** background : ** motherboard is gigabyte ga zx68 xp-ud4 rev1 .3 , with bios v6 ( latest ) , proc is intel 2600k and os is win7 x64 . 
  ** the bluescreens : **, 
  i 've been having these weird bluescreens when waking up from hibernations , followed by boot loops , a `` waiting for me ready '' a mobo error , where the beep code was infinite short beeps . 
  had to power off the computer , before it could even boot successfully . 
  today was different , though . 
  wake up - black screen , comp not responsive - reset - 2 bluescreens - successfull login - snd fucked up . 
  for the second time . 
  the first time i repaired it by reinstalling windows .
