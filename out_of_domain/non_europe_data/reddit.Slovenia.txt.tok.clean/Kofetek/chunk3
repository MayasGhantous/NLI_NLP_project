  that looks so good . 
  women get all the good toys : /, 
  nice . 
  although i like the `` can be worn without anyone noticing while on your usual daily routines and has a remote for you to control your orgasm intake wherever and whenever you are '' aspect of the gadget . 
  it just seems so fantastic and erotic . 
  know what i mean ? 
  well yes , oddly enough i do . 
  he makes lousy content entertainment and blames piracy when people do n't buy it .

  sloppy , i can see the sata cable . 
  so basically she wants you to give up everything and give nothing in return . 
  she wants you to obide by her rules like a little boy . 
  does that sound like love to you ? 
  cause i 'm finding it a little dodgy . 
  and as was said , your computer , your mastrubation , your buisness . 
  end of story . 
  love your hair  you look beautiful . 
  i love it how you can see almost the whole breast , but it 's okay , since the nipples are covered . 
  google for virtualbox or find similar if it does n't suit you . 
  maybe you 'll be able to separate the input for vbox and the host system . 
  of course the ponytail , ponytails + ass = hot as hell .

  wait wait ... crypto baptists ? 
  xd could you explain the concept ? 
  do they write cypher while praying or something ? 
  okay , since you 're an expert i 'd like to ask a question : 4 core i7 vs 6 core i7 . 
  is it worth it ? 
  would it be more future proof ? 
  would it be better for me , since i run a large amount of processes at once ( sometimes going up to 40 ) ? 
  i know i would n't get much more fpses and whatnot , but for general use it would be helpful , no ? 
  i see . 
  so basically i can buy a 2500k and i 'm set . 
  because most of my processes are idle aswell and it costs 400 $ less :d, 
  thanks for the help . 
  by waving a ( sharpened ) knife around as if it 's a sword . 
  got a scar halfway across my left backhand . 
  it does make a difference . 
  for my mid tower case , i just tucked the cables blocking intake into the empty space for optical units and that gave me 5-10 \u00b0 c lower temperatures . 
  wait so ... 
  the pirates have already pretty much proven that the ubisoft drm is ineffective . 
  why do they still insist on it ? 
  it 's like stopping your ears with your fingers , yelling `` lalala ca n't hear you lalala '' ; it is downright retarded . 
  nope , just jammed the cable mess out of the way . 
  i 'm hoping for a stable 5ghz but if the temps allow it , i 'd go up to 6 . 
  i am upgrading the cpu aswell , yes . 
  the psu is not modern at all , bought it 4 years ago : [ thermaltake toughpower ] ( http://www.onyougo.com/thermaltake-w0104re-w0104re-power-supply-units_pi140407 ) as per the rest of the system there 's the ram [ kingston hyperx ddr3 ] ( http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx?item=n82e16820104073 ) and the gpu [ radeon hd4850 ] ( http://www.amd.com/us/products/desktop/graphics/ati-radeon-hd-4000/hd-4850/pages/ati-radeon-hd-4850-specifications.aspx ) and the cooler [ scythe ninja 3 ] ( http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx?item=n82e16835185173&amp;tpk=scythe%20ninja%203 ) and there 's the mobo [ asus p5kc ] ( http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx?item=n82e16813131188 ) and the proc [ core 2 duo ] ( http://ark.intel.com/products/35348/intel-core2-duo-processor-e7200-%283m-cache-2_53-ghz-1066-mhz-fsb%29 ) . 
  hope that 's all you need , left out the drives and the case , since i do n't see the relevance :p, 
  no , it 's air cooling . 
  scythe ninja 3 , with arctic silver , does a great job , allowed me to oc my core 2 duo to 3.8 ghz . 
  good to hear . 
  thanks for the help . 
  thank you ,

  nothing .

  if you 're looking for functionalities of the second monitor , i have a suggestion : get rainmeter , get skins for things that you like to know but do n't need in your face all the time ( time , date , calendar , temperatures , cpu loads and similar ) and put them on your second monitor . 
  also you can have task manager open on it at all times to help you cope in the horrible times of machine lag and kill any and every offending process . 
  rainmeter , no icons ( pin to taskbar for that :p ) and different background . 
  something less detailed , easy on the eyes .

  the expendables . 
  honourable effort to bring back the `` good old movies '' like rambo and similar . 
  sadly those movies sucked . 
  hard . 
  and the expendables has all of that suck !, 
  basically no story , unconnected scenes , the expendables being impervious to bullets and why the fuck would that gas trail not ignite the airplane ? 
  is the gas selective and only burns down wooden piers ? 
  okay enough of this nonsense !, 
  the [ and ] ; what are they for and why did you use them there ?

  1 ) have sligthly oversized jeans with lots of space .

  5 ) stop bitchwhining about it !, 
  hope he does n't use paypal and just does direct visa . 
  paypal gives me chills . 
  does that mean you have to go on an all out crusade against anything and everything different from you ? 
  because that 's what r/atheism is full of and it 's nauseating . 
  oh and move . 
  for fuck 's sake move .
