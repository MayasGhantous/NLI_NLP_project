there should also be some doppler shift in color of the stars . 
  if the source of light is moving towards us , the wavelength shortens , and vice versa . 
  this means that the stars on the side moving towards us should appear a little bit bluer and the stars moving away from us a little bit redder .

  i believe you printed only the mesh , without the animations . 
  you need to import the animations into the file before printing if they are in a separate file . 
  or , maybe , your dog mesh may not be rigged properly , so the animations do n't work . 
  more like works and does n't work at the same time 100 % of the time , you may have misunderstood the concept ...

  what pisses me off is the fact that there are people who think that religion actually is as silly as the posts on r/atheism may imply . 
  * the awkward moment when you live in europe and the only fanatics you know are atheists . 
  make a reasonable comment about religion not being that bad , just to lose karma for no true reason, 
  point out that there 's a big difference between faith and religion and gain neither upvotes nor downvotes as nobody cares about non-fundamental christians, 
  end a debate in a witty way , seeing that nothing can be done here, 
  it depends from person to person ; some can give more fuck , some less . 
  the amount of fucks that can be given should regenerate with time . 
  however , it 's hard to get over 50 fucks in storage . 
  also , the natural ability to regenerate fucks may stop ; in that case , a person may be completely unable of giving a fuck .

  bmi sucks for very tall/short people , because of the square exponent in formula , where the exponent should actually be 3 - voulme increases by cube of dimension . 
  or , to cite wikipedia :, 
  `` the exponent of 2 in the denominator of the formula for bmi is arbitrary . 
  it is meant to reduce variability in the bmi associated only with a difference in size , rather than with differences in weight relative to one 's ideal weight . 
  if taller people were simply scaled-up versions of shorter people , the appropriate exponent would be 3 , as weight would increase with the cube of height . 
  however , on average , taller people have a slimmer build relative to their height than do shorter people , and the exponent which matches the variation best is between 2 and 3 . 
  an analysis based on data gathered in the usa suggested an exponent of 2.6 would yield the best fit for children aged 2 to 19 years old . 
  [ 30 ] the exponent 2 is used instead by convention and for simplicity . '',
