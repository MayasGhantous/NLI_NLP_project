  i think the trick here is that we as humans have two different reproduction patterns . 
  in modern society , one is manifested as one-night-stands , while the other one is long-term relationships . 
  of course , there is a big gray area between those two . 
  but - what i 'm trying to say is that as a result , men also have two different preferences : the sexy and the cute . 
  ( i 'm using those two terms because i got used to it when explaining , but it is certainly not that simple . ), 
  the sexy type is more , well , sexualised , with well pronounced feminine features , but is otherwise less attractive overall than the cute type . 
  the thing here is - from the point of evolutionary psychology , the sexy type seems more fertile , while cute has better genes . 
  the result is that one type is perceived better for casual sex , while other is better for settling down . 
  man 's preference in women would then be based on his lifestyle and social status - and that is exactly what we see here in reddit . 
  we are more intellectual part of population , and we perceive ourselves as betters ( well , that 's the reddit 's general attitude ) . 
  therefore , we should naturally lean towards the cute type , as i call it , because having casual sex is below us - it 's for jocks and bros. 
  the result is that we have different beauty standards than mainstream society . 
   ( i 'm using those two terms because i got used to it when explaining , but it is certainly not that simple . ), 
  here , read this . 
  i 'm generalising . 
  you can of course be both and fit into both categories . 
  ca n't downvote for repost , too much feels . 
  edit : spelling, 
  also , ensiferum , wintersun and brymir have melodeath influences . 
  most would probably say beer or blowjob , but i enjoy neither . 
  but a steak would be nice . 
  ... and [ simo h\u00e4yh\u00e4 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/simo_h%c3%a4yh%c3%a4 ) has 505 confirmed in less than 100 days . 
  yes but mcclintock said that women make better snipers . 
  i 'm giving you an counterexample telling you that there were also men of that skill . 
  while russian stories may be inflated , this does not completely discredit them . 
  you need more examples ? 
  vasiliy zaytsev - 225 kills in 37 days ( in stalingrad ) , and probably more over the whole war . 
  matth\u00e4us hetzenauer - 345 kills during the last year of the war . 
  francis pegahmagabow - 378 kills ( and around 300 captures ) , during ww1 . 
  this is not that much , but i think you should lose 10 pounds . 
  more , if your body physique allows it .

  ftfy, 
  she is asking for advice . 
  i gave her some . 
  also , i checked the picture she posted . 
  and the photo of her face . 
  and , if she was n't only 5ft. , 135 pounds would be ok . 
  you live in america , right ? 
  it is so much easier to eat healthy food here in europe . 
  i 'm not sure how others here eat , but i eat dinner only - no lunch , no supper - just one main meal at around 4pm . 
  the reason is , the body will not burn the calories you eat in the evening , because you sleep at night . 
  ( at least i think so ) . 
  if i 'm hungry , i just eat a little - around noon and 7pm , usually . 
  also , i cook myself . 
  and , no soda . 
  we have quality tap water , so it 's basically free . 
  i 'm currently on keto for two weeks ( trying to get from 165 to 155 , curently 162 ) , so snacks is almonds , walnuts , greek yoghurt , cottage cheese ... do n't eat fruit ; fruit is sugar !, 
  blueberries actually have more sugar than , say , apples or oranges . 
  also , all vegetables have some carbs , so while salad may sound healthy , it can easily ruin your diet . 
  edit : yeah fuck me for being smug .

  even if i know they may be a little bit off ... 
  actually , i do n't really know . 
  i just know i have always liked girls that no one seemed to notice , yet was n't really attracted to girls that got most attention . 
  atmospheric black metal relaxes me way more . 
  what a faggy op, 
  that 's because star trek reeks of liberal propaganda . 
  umm yes i missed the point of your comment . 
  i just tried to say that this does not really make as much sense as they may wish . 
  every time a photo from slovenia is posted here , it makes me feel proud of my homeland . 
  [ as the original poster of this ] ( / r/metalmemes/comments / 19nej5/find _ the_odd_one_out / ) , i forgive you . 
  why not just / op / ? 
  i 'd also recommend [ xanthochroid ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki7f2grnjte ) ; less progressive and more symphonic , but it 's just as creative and powerful .

  ( this is the first thing that came to my mind after reading the title ), 
  actually , the ring finger thing says that it should be longer than pointer finger . 
  edit : to avoid confusion, 
  did this actually became a copypasta ? 
  or did i just have a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu ? 
  i know ... whoops . 
  was my comment misleading ? 
  i thought he wrote index , not pointer finger and replied so , and that he was implying opposite , longer index finger is desired . 
  have you seen those warriors from hammerfell ? 
  they 've got curved swords . 
  curved . 
  swords . 
  i only listen to post-apocalyptic teslacore . 
  looser underpants are the way to go . 
  i had those problems ( sans the smell ) ; when i was 15 it got so bad in summer that i had constant sweat stain on my butt . 
  then i started wearing boxers and it got much better because of ventilation . 
  but it does n't help if you sit in the same place for a long time . 
  well , in that case i usually just try to change sitting positions often enough to minimise it . 
  great band . 
  it 's nice to see that there are some good new bands playing in similar style as summoning . 
  poor quality is of important to polandball comics !, 
  the new ones are good , but they can not into the essence that is making polandball comics so special . 
  yay , another nice power ballad that is going to have a flame war in youtube comments if it is pop or not .
