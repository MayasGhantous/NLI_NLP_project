  i am going to describe the situation as it is in slovene , i 'm not completely sure how well it compares to other slavic languages ( though at least most of them use genitive plural in some way ) . 
  let 's take the word `` uporabnik '' ( user ) . 
  it is a masculine personal noun ( with female form `` uporabnica '' ) . 
  however , slovene also has dual grammatical number , so 2 users would be `` dva uporabnika '' ( and `` dve uporabnici '' - the cardinal numbers decline with the nouns , and thus has different gender forms ) . 
  however , for numbers 5 and more , the genitive plural form kicks in , and the cardinal numbers decline like ordinary nouns - so 5 users would be `` pet uporabnikov '' ( `` pet uporabnic '' ) . 
  however , the situation is even more complicated - this pattern of grammatical cases repeats once numbers are larger than hundred - so 101 takes the singular form `` sto en uporabnik '' ( `` sto ena uporabnica '' ) , 204 users would be `` dvesto \u0161tirje uporabniki '' ( `` dvesto \u0161tiri uporabnice '' ) and so on . 
  this is true for all countable nouns in slovene . 
  oh yes , i forgot to mention that slovene reverses order of tens and units in numerals . 
  so , 21 is not `` dvajset dva '' , but `` dvaindvajset '' , just like in german . 
  where do i stand on stealing music ? 
  i want to listen to the thing first . 
  if it is really good , i 'll buy it , to show support and to get higher quality recording . 
  in order to discover new music , it is almost necessary for me to get it pirated . 
  i believe there are more people with a similar stance ... 
  loving music regardless of genre is not same as actually knowing and listening to all , even the most obscure genres . 
  i listed that i love all genres , and honestly , i really like mongolian/tuvan folk , klezmer , gypsy , baroque , post-rock , chillstep ... and of course , metal . 
  also , if you ignore the mainstream , you can find awesome pop artists . 
  i prefer to actually listen to complete album . 
  this is why it does n't really work for me . 
  yep , bandcamp is awesome in all aspects . 
  okay , i 'll admit that there are some genres from which i know no good song . 
  house ( unless daft punk counts as ) , turbo-folk , and minimalist classical , for example .

  no , because i love to cook and dating a vegetarian , especially a vegan , would mean that i can not prepare most of the food i like .

  wow , this cancer seems to be ineradicable . 
  not only this , but all the articles that result from that google search also say that men look at bodies when considering short-term sexual partners only , and at faces when considering a serious relationship . 
  not only that , one of the articles says that `` while 49 percent of men chose to look at a woman 's face for a one-night stand , 75 percent opted to view her face for a long-term relationship '' - `` only '' 49 % is almost a half and thus does not really mean anything . 
  relativity kicks in and causes photons to asymptotically approach planck length , duh . 
  my comment was a joke ... 
  in fact , the problem is that if you had photons of such high energy ( planck energy ) , coming from body of planck temperature , they would have energy of planck mass ( by einstein 's formula e = mc ^ 2 ) , which is mass of a black hole with radius of planck length . 
  so , having photons of planck length wavelength would immediately create a black hole .

  boron has quite complex chemistry , so i guess it could work instead of carbon . 
  the problem is , it is a very rare element , so it 's not possible for boron-based life to evolve , as there are simply no building blocks for simple life . 
  also , i think formaldehyde could act as a solvent instead of water , under different atmospheric conditions ( lower temperature , less oxygen ) . 
  it is also quite abundant in the interstellar medium . 
  the problem is that mars does n't have enough gravity so water , being a light molecule , would just evaporate from the atmosphere . 
  as far as i know , co2 has logarithmic scale greenhouse effect ; this means that even increasing co2 levels tenfold would not have that much effect on the temperature .

  i remember reading on wikipedia once that a connection between love-shyness and musical preferences has been found . 
  to cite [ the article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/love-shyness#music ) :, 
   according to gilmartin , the love-shy tended to prefer vocal love ballads such as broadway theatre music , brassy jazz music , easy listening , film soundtracks and light classical music , but not traditional classical music . 
  a few also mentioned having a strong liking for country and western . 
  rock music of almost every kind was disliked by the love-shy , but only on an aesthetic level , not on moral grounds . 
  gilmartin noted that surprisingly few of the love-shy men mentioned female singers . 
   gilmartin concluded that the majority of love-shy men prefer music with emotional/escapist themes and rich , beautiful melody . 
  as a result , love-shy males dislike music that is noisy , loud , dissonant or amelodic in their point of view . 
  the non-shy men gilmartin interviewed typically enjoyed rock music and would only buy rock albums . 
  the music love-shys enjoyed was considered boring by most of the non-shy men .
