  well , you know what they say about the op ? 
  his idea is nothing surprising . 
  having a totem animal ! = being fucktarded otherkin with species identity dysphoria, 
  it 's not a man purse . 
  it 's a satchel . 
  what about otherkin rights ? 
  do they have the right to be the animal they actually are ? 
  in my opinion it is possible to have a beard and still look feminine . 
  for example , i remember finding [ this picture ] ( http://0.tqn.com/d/menshair/1/0/m/4/-/-/02-goatee.jpg ) once . 
  it 's a guy with goatee , but he still looks quite un-masculine to me . 
  however , it is a bit different , because he 's a guy ... 
  also , dwarves in tolkien 's legendarium all have beards . 
  there is a [ fan art ] ( http://kotorigaro.deviantart.com/art/the-hobbit-fanart-dis-345711814 ) of thorin 's sister , dis , with a beard and good-looking . 
  so , why not - if nothing else , for supporting diversity . 
  it 's fun to do the opposite ; greet people you do n't know in public . 
  some even pretend they know you .

  nope , because of how brave i am, 
  ... are we really upvoting this to the front page ? 
  yes , but it seems private, 
  number 3 . 
  your virginity is showing ... 
  so do i. . . but still , this is completely meaningless . 
  or maybe i should just stop over-analyzing and enjoy the awesomeness by the name of titties . 
  i do n't know .

  i 'm wondering why is supporting gay marriage so important . 
  i think the priority should be to change the laws so that only cohabitation is required for most legal issues . 
  the problem would then be solved by itself . 
  the reason is that i see marriage as some kind of a life-long contract in order to secure family life . 
  now that divorces are much more common , marriage does n't seem to play its role anymore . 
  naturally , this means that homosexual couples ( unless they actually want to adopt a child , which is a bit problematic as there are simply not enough orphans anymore in first world ) do not need to get married anyway . 
  cohabitation is quite common and in my country , more than half of the children are born outside marriage . 
  nice screenshot , too bad we ca n't see it was posted today . 
  he said nothing about quality . 
  unless you 're implying that metal is by default good and if it 's bad it ca n't be metal . 
  i ride my bike all the year . 
  even in winter . 
  even when it 's snowing . 
  buy studded tires . 
  suddenly , ice is no problem . 
  nope , the face in the right still looks bumpy and scarred . 
  it may be hidden on a picture , but not in person . 
  right side looks better , it 's the freckles . 
  i also saw the pornstars post before ; most of them look bad with and without makeup , and the only ones that look decent with look better without . 
  now , the right side actually looks better to me . 
  it has much more character . 
  this could be a vicious cycle - you wear makeup to hide bad skin , and the skin can not cure itself because of the makeup . 
  i 'm not really sure if it really damages skin , but common sense tells me that constantly putting something on your skin does more bad than good . 
  especially if it 's artificial chemicals . 
  what if the rest of the trilogy is just a dream ? 
  \\  tfw no comic sans, 
  classical music is already so diverse that it simply can not fit into a single genre . 
  if the style is the problem , why are n't we consistent and also split the classical more harshly into baroque , classical , romantic , expressionist , minimalist , modernist etc. 
  and usually just consider them all classical ? 
  also , i do n't understand why should n't game artworks and costume designs fit into a gallery or fashion show . 
  a lot of work has been put into them and simply because they 're part of a greater scheme , it does n't make them any lesser . 
  sometimes they 're mush more intricate and meaningful than `` legit art '' !, 
  not to mention the fact that grieg 's peer gynt started its life as a soundtrack to the ibsen 's play of the same name . 
  actually , it premiered along with the play . 
  only later on , due to popular demand , have the best pieces from peer gynt been made into the two suites . 
  this actually makes grieg 's peer gynt the very first official soundtrack . 
  is it any less `` classical '' because of that ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  a lot of video game music is shallow , yes . 
  but so is a lot of classical music . 
  not every piece is brilliant . 
  so , having higher quality just can not be something that defines a genre . 
  or a super-genre , what classical definitely is ( just like jazz or rock , which also cover quite a wide spectrum ) . 
  i 'm also not sure if the music we consider classical was originally intended to be listened to as we listen to it today . 
  for example , during the premiere of beethoven 's fifth and sixth symphony beethoven actually improvised a piano piece . 
  after the rise of jazz , classical music abandoned improvisation completely . 
  ( it has been introduced again later on . ), 
  the convention of silence during performances has also only developed late in the 19th century . 
  mozart expected that people would eat and talk over his music , particularly at dinner , and was delighted when his audience would clap during his symphonies .
