  and where it fits ? 
  apparently into a new style , genre or whatever you want to call it , along with a lot of movie soundtracks . 
  it is written to be atmospheric , having simple melodies yet rich orchestration , often inspired by traditional music . 
  in a way , it could be considered a continuation of wagner 's and grieg 's style . 
   for example , during the premiere of beethoven 's fifth and sixth symphony beethoven actually improvised a piano piece . 
  it 's on wikipedia and quick googling reveals other sources . 
   after the rise of jazz , classical music abandoned improvisation *** completely *** . 
  i said completely . 
  when jazz took on , improvisation was suddenly `` unclassical '' and shunned upon , even if it was rare before . 
  the problem is that genres are not rigid , but fluid . 
  a single piece of music will never completely fit into a certain genre ( and when it does , it often sounds forced ) . 
  so , the genres and styles are here just to give the general idea . 
  and about shallowness - excuse me , but a lot of mozart 's music is really shallow . 
  fishing for compliments , are we ? 
  to be honest , yes , if only because they do n't touch me . 
  do n't get me wrong , they are beautifully done , but it 's kind of thing i would have just to create ambient . 
  there is a lot of details though and it is fun to explore it . 
  but i really like the octopus and the fish machine . 
  my steak . 
  also the egyptians and the hittites . 
  michael levy 's profile on youtube has some . 
  if you want more , go to his bandcamp : http://michaellevy.bandcamp.com/, 
  if you want pure sound , go listen to your midi music . 
  `` all good stories deserve embellishment . '', 
  thank you !, 
  you , sir , are a scholar and gentleman . 
   grunge, 
   hard alternative, 
  great , you really know what metal is . 
  exactly . 
  i do n't listen to rap and hip hop ( generally , sometimes i get a bit curious ) , but i know that there 's also jazz rap , crunk , gangsta rap , hardcore hip hop etc. , possibly even including reggaeton , rapcore and trip hop , and that there are also southern and midwestern regional scenes besides the east - and westcoast . 
  plus , because it is heavily based on the rhythm of the lyrics , rapping in different language influences the overall sound greatly , so practically every country ( at least in europe ) has it 's own variety that could count as a subgenre . 
  you might want to read this . 
  it 's about a mormon guy who is openly homosexual , yet is married and has three children because he believes in family values ( as a part of his religion ) . 
  le / thread, 
  come to / fa / , you 'll love this place . 
  full of / fa/scists with hitler youth haircuts . 
  to be honest , a fetus pretty much meets the definition of a tumor . 
  also , sperm cells are like viruses . 
  you 're just op . 
  what can i say , i am a / fa/ggot . 
  check my flair . 
  cytherean is considered acceptable , and sounds better . 
  just because venus was born from the sea on the island of kythera . 
  * assburger, 
  ftfy, 
  yes . 
  being paedophile is bad because it is morally ambiguous , not because it harms children . 
  it 's how it should n't be and it makes no sense that way , but most people tend to hastily assume that 's how it is . 
  theoretically , if i said that little girls get me off , yet i find it bad and i am worried about it , you would probably still judge me , right ? 
  it is a bit different , because of the idea of consent , yet still ... both can be considered a sexual deviancy . 
  i 'm also wondering how many people are out there that do have paedophilic tendencies , yet do n't actively molest children or support child porn . 
  people that try to live a normal life . 
  some of them failing to do so and ruining their family afterwards ... and the only paedophiles we know of are of the rapist kind . 
  knowing only of the rapist homosexuals would change our views of homosexuality a lot , right ? 
  dude , i am barely legal . 
  edit : if you are wondering what he said , he [ reported me to the / r/fbiwatchlist . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/fbiwatchlist/comments/1csx9b/user_methylorange42_has_been_added_due_to_high/c9jo08c ), 
  there are people saying that our preference for no body hair on women is a sign of neoteny ... 
  i was also called weird for liking some peach fuzz on legs . 
  so yes , i guess it is a thing . 
  also , if you grow up faster , this means that a generation turns around faster , meaning faster population growth . 
  this is how evolution works . 
  the cycle is complete . 
  nope . 
  to a paedophile who does not , in fact , fuck . 
  little children , that is . 
  i cant even watch porn because girls in porn are so terrible . 
  they started as a black metal band , only later going more post-rock . 
  [ 2001 - tristesse hivernale demo ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrymk_ncswg ) - full-on black metal, 
  [ 2005 - le secret ep ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-n2uvnn2oo ) - getting more and more atmospheric, 
  [ 2007 - souvenirs d'un autre monde lp ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrymk_ncswg ) - evolved post-metal sound, 
  blackened post-rock , blackgaze , whatever you want to call it . 
  i think neige actually derived the sound from atmospheric black metal alone and only later realized that there 's the whole genre out there . 
  wow , you must have the sickest fadez, 
  well , once it 's fully saturated , it ca n't get worse . 
  source : i 'm a chemist . 
  exactly . 
  thanks for confirming it . 
  why should n't similar sound evolve twice , if you 're building your music upon the same emotions , playing the same instruments ? 
  i bought 420 acres of grass for my cattle . 
  graze it fagget, 
  nope . 
  should i feel shallow for not liking a guy i find attractive in almost every way , but i 'm straight ? 
  it 's actually cool , because you do n't have to decline every woman that would approach you and you would n't find attractive . 
  i guess this can be quite hard ... 
  also , this has nothing to do with the society and gender roles . 
  this is how human sexuality works in general . 
  sometimes we simply need to accept that we are , in fact , not equal , even if we treat as if we were . 
  wow i see a lot of trees, 
  try [ this version ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/1cv0um/anon_finds_a_way_to_beat_up_a_weather_guy/c9kfeaz ) for massive profit, 
   implying his date is not steampunker landwhale, 
  people wearing fedoras now < < < people wearing fedoras in the past, 
  also , there 's a big difference between wearing fedora with a dapper suit and wearing fedora because you 're smug . 
  go to / r/atheism and tell them this , then watch them circlejerk over how retarded children are and that they should not be allowed to have their own opinion . 
  why not ? 
  besides equines , people ride camels , elephants , yaks , ostriches , zebras , reindeers ... 
  google image search says it 's [ not only children ... ] ( http://tribestravel.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/ostrich-farm11_2011_hs.jpg ), 
  also , there are ostrich races , just like horse races .
