  nobody gives me shit for dressing like a cross between a hipster and a steampunker . 
  some even compliment me . 
  this must be a sign that i 'm popular enough !,

  i 'm sure there were dozens of camwhore boobs there .

  most of the economic polices of the nazi party were actually left-wing . 
  they also supported public services , hence the `` socialist '' . 
  the basis behind the nazi part could be called national socialism ( and i actually heard left-wing kids proposing a similar system ) , but the nazi were the only such ideology that came to power - and they started by with rhetoric of hate and warmongering , this instantly discrediting the entire ideology . 
  similar to how communism is stigmatized in america . 
  most parties in power only use ideology just for rhetoric anyway , so it is not really surprising anyway .

  he was an * puer \u00e6ternus * - eternal boy . 
  i think he even said that he feels like peter pan . 
  half-done as in `` i 'm lazy , so i did n't bother to do it properly '' . 
  it 's either do or do n't . 
  trimmed is ok , put i prefer some length , because short hair feel much harder .

  there is one thing that is almost universally missing in the orchestrations of symphonic metal - that is dynamics . 
  a classical music piece has buildups , accentuation , can get very quiet or quite loud . 
  ( you do have acoustic breaks in metal , but that is a bit different ) . 
  however , symphonic metal has only one loudness for orchestra - and that is over-the-top . 
  that does n't necessarily make it any less brilliant though , as it is appropriate for the music - but i 'm saying that you ca n't really compare it with classical music . 
  and this is coming from a guy who listens to more metal than classical . 
  also , if you want to listen to some great symphonic black metal that actually is a bit more like classical in structure , try [ aquilis ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u4mvuj_4vk ) . 
  or should i call this a black metal symphony ? 
  i think it sometimes just does n't make sense to put everything into `` pretty little boxes '' , as i call them . 
  categorization is cool , because it 's easier to explain what you 're talking about , but every time you stumble upon something borderline between two categories , you get confused where to put it . 
  so , i do n't want to fully categorize it . 
  it certainly is a metal band ( because of the sound and guitar playing techniques ) , it has classical elements , it has progressive structure , but those are just descriptors - not labels . 
  if you want some examples of music that you just can not categorize , because it actually is unique and genre-bending , try [ igorr ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xll7_hjni0i ) and [ k\u014fenji hyakkei ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubipzvzvnqq ) . 
  both entirely different and both weird - but not bad at all . 
  unless you make one genre , one `` pretty little box '' called avantgarde into which you put everything that does n't fit anywhere else - which does n't make much sense either . 
  i had a dry orgasm once , as a result of ( failed ) edging . 
  after holding back for half a minute or so i gave up and orgasmed , but nothing came out . 
  i 'm also not sure if nocturnal emissions count as orgasming , but they definitely do as cumming .

  i heard that soy contains phytoestrogens , but did n't find any serious study how it could actually affect endocrine system . 
  however , if it actually has an effect , it is not impossible that soy could cause feminization . 
   who had been held prisoner by my neighbor for years, 
  i tried to show that it is actually possible to avoid the use of the object pronoun `` whom '' , while still being grammatically correct . 
  `` whom '' is an object pronoun . 
  the `` white girl '' is an object in the relative clause ( `` who ( m ) my neighbor had been holding prisoner for years '' ) ; the subject is `` my neighbor '' - it 's about which one causes and which one receives the action ; subject being the cause and object being the receiver . 
  it 's similar to the use of the pronoun `` her '' ; if you replace the `` who ( m ) '' with the personal pronoun , it would be `` her '' , not `` she '' - `` my neighbor had been holding her ( not she ) prisoner for years '' . 
  however , whom is not really used anymore in everyday speech ... 
  i know of some neofolk/black metal bands - agalloch , panopticon , nechochwen , oak pantheon , for example, 
  or include only major moons ( the round ones ) : titan is the largest , others come in pairs of similar size : iapetus and rhea , tethys and dione , mimas and enceladus . 
  titan also has an atmosphere , so it could be drawn with the same colour ar saturn . 
  so , you could make 7 dots of different size : one large and orange ( titan ) at the pole , and then others arranged by decreasing size on both sides of saturn .

  jupiter begs to differ , with all the striped clouds . 
  if you have the absorption spectra of the pigments , you actually have the energy conversion graph , because energy is acquired from this absorbed light . 
  [ absorption spectra of two types of chlorophyll ( both are usually present ) ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/chlorophyll_ab_spectra-en.svg ), 
  [ both spectra above , with carotenoids added ] ( http://www.orchidboard.com/community/attachments/growing-under-lights/61565d1321968689-step-beyond-t5s-i-found-t4s-absorption-spectra-29de0jr.jpg ),

  add some globus and les friction to the playlist ; both are rock/orchestral crossover bands formed by composers in the movie industry . 
  also , symphonic metal ( especially the slower songs ) might be appropriate . 
  nightwish , xandria , dragonland , rhapsody ( of fire and luca turilli 's ) , turisas ... 
  also , some classical music : tchaikovsky 's marche slave , holst 's planets suite , mussorgsky 's night on bald mountain , chopin 's fantaisie-impromptu , wagner 's walk\u00fcrenritt , dvo\u0159ak 's new world symphony ...

  `` triglycerides , the energy-yielding dietary fats , consist of three fatty acids bonded to a glycerol `` backbone '' . 
  because olestra is synthesized from sucrose , it can bond with six , seven , or eight fatty acids . 
  the resulting radial arrangement is too large and irregular to move through the intestinal wall and be absorbed . 
  olestra has the same taste and mouthfeel as fat , but it passes through the gastrointestinal tract undigested without contributing calories or nutritive value to the diet . '', 
  this is what happens when you make indigestible fats in order to keep people from getting fat while still being able to eat the same fatty food . 
  first class gut grease . 
  this was a tradition in tibet , because land was not allowed to be split between brothers by law . 
  this controlled population growth . 
  ( ironically , chinese population control measures forbade them ) it was most common among the taxpayer class ( the wealthier landowners ) . 
  land estates were ruled by the oldest man in the family , who decided on marriages of family members . 
  if there were too many sons in the family , one of them was usually sent to the monastery to become a monk . 
  lower classes , ( householders and landless peasants ) were not this strictly bound by law , because the small plots of land they owned were not considered land estates , so they also did n't have to pay taxes . 
  this means that marriages did not have that much responsibility , so they were usually monogamist and married for love .

  i know of linzbach 's transcendental algebra from year 1916 . 
  it was a problem on the international lingustics olympiad competition in 2003 . 
  i never managed to find anything , besides the article ( published in 1921 - apparently the date 1916 is wrong , he published another work - the principles of philosophical language - that year ) . 
  it 's a shame ; it 's a really nice and tidy attempt at creating an ideographic writing system that we could use regardless of the spoken language . 
  it is possible that the idea was never developed into a full conscript at all . 
  searching for more info , i found another similar system - blissymbolics from 1949 . 
  there is much more info about it :,

  humanity creates slaves ( teletubbies ) , slowly all humans are replaced by teletubbies ( hence the `` end of the world ) , and when humans die out , everything becomes `` perfect '' and a society of teletubbies lives in harmony forever after . 
  if you want to understand how a society of teletubbies works , watch demolition man .

  this is because the stories from the donald duck universe take place in the 1950s ( scrooge as a character was created in 1947 ) .
