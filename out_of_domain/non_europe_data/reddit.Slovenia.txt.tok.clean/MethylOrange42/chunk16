  silly western europeans , thinking x is a letter . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/types_of_snow is interesting too ... it shows you how many words for snow english has . 
  it criticizes our society ( #nomakeup ) , therefore it is art . 
  if this really is the point of art as we 've been taught in school ... 
  i think you should have all five carpet guls in the symbol instead of just those three . 
  there is a symbolism behind them - they represent the five tribes of turkmen . 
  i have no idea how to rearrange them though . 
  to be honest , i had no idea what to replace the stars with . 
  one idea was to place them into a reversed triforce ( like the mon of h\u014fj\u014f clan ) and make other three points smaller , but it looked bad , no matter what i did with it . 
  i decided to use the \u30b9 because it is so nicely pointy , like a star . 
  another idea would be to use the hiragana \u3059 ( su ) , because hiragana in general are rounder , but i 'm not changing it now that it is already submitted . 
  damn . 
  i forgot that sarcasm does not translate well on the internet . 
  the thing is , some artist nowadays make utter crap and then explain how much what they made is their expression of something so deep and edgy normal humans ca n't comprehend it at all . 
  ( i 'm greatly exaggerating , but i guess you get the point ) i tried to mock this point of view , and apparently it was not obvious enough that i was being sarcastic . 
  that 's the reason of the last sentence - we are never taught to appreciate art , just to analyze it . 
  at least that is what artists do in slovenia where i come from . 
  it seems that galicia can not into celtic , just like estonia can not into nordic . 
  so do asians . 
  i guess looking old is an european feature . 
   thou dost, 
  ftfy, 
  second person singular gets the ending - st , and the third person singular the - th . 
  i do , thou dost , he/she/it doth, 
  so most europeans are not native to europe , because the indo-european culture has only recently came into europe and the basque are only native europeans ? 
  ( even though the basque are likely also not the same people who inhabited europe in the stone age ), 
  thou hast just noticed how similar english is to german . 
  edit : just the first two words , of course . 
  the difference is striking - when you replace `` you have '' with the archaic `` thou hast '' , the language suddenly seems much more germanic . 
  it 's s [ weed ] [ ent ] . 
   you have = ihr habt ,, 
  depending on the context . 
   you ( pl . ), 
   you ( sg . 
  formal ) = sie, 
   you ( sg . 
  informal ) = du, 
  yet comments like yours are always upvoted to the top . 
  at least in the generally reasonable subreddits . 
  it 's as if the counter-jerk has become the new circlejerk . 
  edit : there is nothing that makes the circlejerk more obvious than getting comment notifications which look like the same reply is being posted over and over again . 
  i am so meta that i 'm calling out the metajerk . 
  quick search showed up / r/flagjerk . 
  not really ; `` you '' was already used before for the plural `` you '' . 
  however , it is possible that this misinterpretation of the \u00fe letter made the demise of the singular `` thou '' easier . 
  yes . 
  that 's why `` you '' takes the plural form of the verb `` to be '' : `` you are '' . 
  it 's actually quite common that the formal forms of personal pronouns were in plural . 
  note the royal `` we '' in english . 
  or just take almost any other european language .

  how do you not notice that it is not the real thing ? 
  reading all comment about her being hot made me think - am i really that weird to find her unattractive ? 
  she has a man-face and judging on her boobs and shoulders it seems that she has , um , a predisposition to fat storage . 
  if you are offended by my comment , just go on and downvote me . 
  i do n't really care . 
  countering the circlejerk is enough for me . 
  high and wide forehead , wide protruding chin , low eyebrows , robust cheeks . 
  that 's how it is in america . 
  in slovenia , it is the exact opposite , probably because we have a long left-wing tradition , ever since the ww2 ... 
  do you even line break, 
  did you take a quest to post every nordic cross flag , or what ? 
  not criticizing the flag ( or the nordic crosses in general ) , it just seems weird to have 4 nordic crosses on the first page , all posted by the same person . 
  edit : if flag of portland counts as a nordic cross too , then it 's 5 and not all posted by the same person . 
  not just betelgeuse , [ eta carinae ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/etacarinae.jpg ) also looks like it could blow up any time soon . 
  the nebula around it was formed by an eruption in 1843 ( actually around 6000bc , because of the distance of light travel ) . 
  however , it is much further away than betelgeuse - but also around 10 times as massive . 
  on other hand , since everyone loves nordic crosses so much , this could be a theme for a future contest ... ? 
  itt : b-b-but he hates de gayz !!, 
  we can determine the mass ratio ( planet/moon or star/planet ) from the location of the barycenter ( the point that the whole system revolves around ) . 
  for example : moon is 1/81 of earth 's mass , therefore earth orbits the barycenter at 1/82 of the orbit 's semimajor axis ( around 3/4 of earth 's radius in that case ) . 
  we can measure this wobbling and determine the mass ratio , thus calculating both masses from the single orbital equation . 
  ( for example , when pluto 's moon charon was discovered , we could measure the distance between pluto and charon and how much pluto wobbles around , thus allowing us to calculate both pluto 's and charon 's mass ), 
  if the major body does not wobble around the barycenter as it is being orbited by the smaller body , then the moon/planet 's mas is negligible compared to the planet/star and we have no problem with determining the mass of the smaller object . 
  do n't worry , native americans , inuit , aboriginal australians and papuans ca n't get this scholarship either . 
  let 's say we 're observing the pluto-charon system . 
  the orbital period , measured by timing , is 6.387 days , now we need to measure the semimajor axis of the orbit . 
  if we make the location of pluto fixed , we can see charon orbiting pluto in an elliptical orbit , but pluto does n't appear to be in the focus of the ellipse , because the orbit is inclined . 
  ( check [ this orbital diagram ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/orbit_alpha_centauri_ab_arcsec.png ) for the star alpha centauri if you do n't get what i 'm saying ) . 
  we need to stretch the ellipse out so that pluto is in the focus . 
  now we have a projection of the charon 's orbit relative to pluto viewed perpendicular to the plane . 
  since we know the distance of pluto from earth ( assuming that we calculated it before from kepler 's third law ) , we can calculate the semimajor axis of the orbit , which is 19600km . 
  according to the kepler 's third law , we can calculate the mass of the pluto-charon system : m = ( 4 pi ^ 2 r ^ 3 ) / ( g t ^ 2 ) - 1.457 * 10 ^ 22 kg . 
  now we `` unfix '' pluto . 
  we can see that both pluto and charon wobble around the trajectory they follow on the sky ; but charon 's wobble is 9 times as big as pluto 's . 
  this means that the mass ratio is 9:1 and we can calculate the masses .

  anyway , this flag is terrible .
