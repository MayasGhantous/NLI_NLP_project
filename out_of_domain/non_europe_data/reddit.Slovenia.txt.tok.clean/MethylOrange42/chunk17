  this , but maths in school does not actual mathematics . 
  it 's mostly just calculating stuff you do n't understand at all , because you ca n't teach a child maths axiomatically . 
  i should try this next time i go to germany . 
  i hope my slavic background and jewish surname gives me a free pass . 
   post an ancient pasta, 
  yes , but ural mountains are more than 250 million years old . 
  ever since then , europe is fixed into asian mainland , so it 's not really two different tectonic plates anymore . 
  actually , according to that criterion , india would qualify as a continent , even more so than europe , because the himalayas are still in the process of forming . 
  parts of zealandia are still above water . 
  it 's called new zealand . 
  most of it is around 1000 m ( 3000 feet ) below sea level , so it 's not really bound to happen . 
  so do arabia and eastern africa . 
  and majority of southeast asia , including western part of indonesia and phillipines lie on the sunda plate . 
  are they subcontinents too ? 
  europe , however , does n't have it 's own plate - at least for the last 200 million years . 
  also , the easternmost part of siberia lies on the north-american plate . 
  does that make it a part of north america ? 
  you can not really measure if a plate is fully formed . 
  you can only measure how different points on the surface of earth are moving - and arabian plate clearly moves on its own . 
  if you 're interested , there 's a [ map on wikipedia ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/tectonic_plates_boundaries_detailed-en.svg ) that also has a lot of minor plates marked , along with their movement vectors relative to africa ( african plate is regarded as having fixed position ) . 
  active orogenies are marked too . 
  flag of idrija is related to the mining history of the town . 
  the red represents the cinnabarite ore , the gold represents the wealth and trade , and the silver represents mercury which was mined in idrija . 
  what is and what is n't a continent ( or subcontinent , for that matter ) is a thing of consensus anyway . 
  trying to make a definition does n't really make sense in this case , as you 'd be left with a lot of special cases , like europe and india . 
  the reason i brought up my arguments was more to show how it does n't always make sense to strictly categorize everything . 
  check the movement vectors on the north american and eurasian plate close to the border between them . 
  it 's a smooth transition . 
  however , on the other side , there is a clear border between them - the north atlantic ridge . 
  the thing is , plates are not perfectly rigid bodies of rock floating on a perfectly fluid mantle . 
  they shear and break , and therefore they do n't behave as one would expect from first glance . 
  a plate is just a part of earth 's surface that in general moves in the same way . 
  it seems that [ provo , utah ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/flag_of_provo%2c_utah.svg/500px-flag_of_provo%2c_utah.svg.png ) has a serious contestant in having the most terrible flag . 
  also :, 
   like all cities in korea , daejeon has adopted a konglish town slogan : `` it 's daejeon '' . 
  for those who actually care , the `` it 's '' is meant to be an backronym expressing ; *** i *** nteresting , *** t *** radition and culture , *** s *** cience and technology . 
  this is the point of the japanese municipal flag design . 
  the central symbol is called mon , which were traditionally used as symbols of families or guilds . 
  mon as itself is monochrome , therefore flag designs utilizing mon are usually a mon of one colour on a diferent coloured field . 
  the [ house tyrell ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6f9lrwe.png ) flag is esentially the same as the flag of [ ibaraki prefecture ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/flag_of_ibaraki_prefecture.svg/720px-flag_of_ibaraki_prefecture.svg.png ) . 
  ssshhhh , let them think that it is , if you note it is not , they 'll start saying that we do n't realize how shitty they all look without it . 
  by the same person actually . 
  i refrained from downvoting for repost because he 's new though . 
  according to your logic , most racist people do n't either . 
  does that make it ok ? 
  are you implying that people are racist because they are evil ? 
  people are racist because they identify strangers as a threat to the local community , based on feelings and emotions they see in response to the said strangers . 
  usually learned while young . 
  how does that make it any different ? 
  just because you think it 's abstract , it does n't make it any more abstract . 
  maybe dog thinks there 's an abstract reason why some people are threat and some are not . 
  yes ... metal played on piano sounds really good actually . 
  he said metal . 
  go to / r/metal and tell them about korn and see the reaction . 
  i would be that kind of guy . 
  i 'm an endangered species , i know . 
  what the fuck did you just fucking say about me , you little bitch ? 
  i 'll have you know i graduated top of my class in the navy seals , and i 've been involved in numerous secret raids on al-quaeda , and i have over 300 confirmed kills . 
  i am trained in gorilla warfare and i 'm the top sniper in the entire us armed forces . 
  you are nothing to me but just another target . 
  i will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth , mark my fucking words . 
  you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the internet ? 
  think again , fucker . 
  as we speak i am contacting my secret network of spies across the usa and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm , maggot . 
  the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life . 
  you 're fucking dead , kid . 
  i can be anywhere , anytime , and i can kill you in over seven hundred ways , and that 's just with my bare hands . 
  not only am i extensively trained in unarmed combat , but i have access to the entire arsenal of the united states marine corps and i will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent , you little shit . 
  if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little `` clever '' comment was about to bring down upon you , maybe you would have held your fucking tongue . 
  but you could n't , you did n't , and now you 're paying the price , you goddamn idiot . 
  i will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it . 
  you 're fucking dead , kiddo . 
  i like j\u00f3nsi 's music . 
  and mika 's first album ( second was ok , the last one i ca n't stand , except for the opening song ) . 
  i also listen to a lot of queen . 
  but it certainly is n't a guilty pleasure . 
  i 'm a straight guy , i ( believe that i ) dress well , and it certainly is n't just for women . 
  it 's for me , because i like to stand out in public ( in a good way ) , and to make a good impression - not just to women , but also to other men . 
  the way you dress can also be a way of self-expression . 
  clothes do n't make the man , but it certainly is the man who picks his clothes . 
  i 'm quite sure that only a small percentage ( or should i say permillage ? ), 
  of women actually does this . 
  i think [ this picture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qlu1fb1.jpg ) fits in here well . 
  to be honest , i think the side of her face with no makeup has much more personality ( and looks cuter - which i prefer over sexy ) . 
  but i also understand the appeal of makeup . 
  just not every day , please ... 
  all of them , more or less . 
  shopping is not that uncommon , but , from my experience , girls who do it excessively are rare . 
  i also do n't notice the peacocking you describe in the second paragraph that often - especially when you start with the hyperbole about botox and silicone . 
  or maybe it 's just my social circles and i get to know more reasonable women . 
  well , i live in europe , maybe it really is that different ... 
  would you date/hookup with a guy who 's attractive ( with great personality ) , but you 're straight ? 
  unless by `` your type '' you mean a very specific set of characteristics you expect . 
  then i guess you may want to consider this again and realize that you should not be so harsh with what is `` your type '' . 
  i hope you get laid soon and upvote everyone who commented here . 
  i 'm an atheist and can confirm that i do n't watch porn . 
  reddit 's karma system does n't do subs like this a favour . 
  the more `` mainstream '' an idea is , the more you get rewarded for posting it , and vice versa . 
  it 's kind of a muting system so that different opinions are not heard as much as they should be . 
  exactly for this reason i go to 4chan 's / fa / board for fashion .
