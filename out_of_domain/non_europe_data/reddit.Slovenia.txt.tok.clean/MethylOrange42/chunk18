  comments are much more hostile and there 's a lot of offtopicing , but at least everyone can post their opinion without getting downvoted . 
  and even though / fa / is just as much a circlejerk as / r/mfa , once you get used to ignoring circlejerking and shitposting comments , it 's actually possible to have a reasonable conversation . 
  because we all know that guys can harrdy get this much karma because we ca n't post to / r/gonewild . 
  or are you implying that you inherently can not post relevant links and pictures because you 're a woman ? 
  i also like how you deleted everything you posted . 
  yes . 
  source : i had a fat teacher in high school , her classes were the longest . 
  he shed the blood of four thousand saxon men !, 
  it is heavily fantasy themed - all songs revolve around a fantasy world the band created , but the music is far from cheesy . 
  i 'd classify them as progressive symphonic black metal , but they have quite an unique sound . 
  they also made a cover of harvest by opeth . 
  yes and no . 
  frequency shift does occur , but it is ( 1 ) really small and unnoticeable ( 2 ) once light passes the planet , it switches back to the original frequency , just as an object would first accelerate , then after passing the planet decelerate back to the original speed . 
  the gravitational redshift ( or blueshift in this case ) can be explained by the principle of conservation of energy . 
  as photon moves closer to a massive object , it gains energy ( because of gravitational potential ) . 
  because it gains energy , the wavelength of the photon becomes shorter ( shows blueshift ) , similar to how objects start moving faster , because they gain kinetic energy . 
  surely you mean s [ high ] [ ent ] ist, 
  when light passes a massive body ( or in this case , a black hole ) , it is reverted to the original frequency , so the answer is no . 
  but , the trajectory by which light passed a black hole is curved . 
  it is possible to observe this effect ; it is called gravitational lensing ( because the light curves around the black hole as it `` curves '' in a lens ) . 
  gravitational lensing was used as a proof of einstein 's theory of relativity ; during a solar eclipse , some stars are visible right next to the sun that would normally geometrically be behind the sun .

  i like how the pic says `` without makeup '' . 
   implying we 're this gullible, 
  it 's nice to hear that someone actually managed to do that , it gives me courage and hope that i may be able to succeed in this too . 
  i 'm not really intimidated , though i agree that the no makeup look is much more personal . 
  listen to them and call her out next time . 
  it has a potential of being funny . 
  try australia , they banned a-cup boobs because they are child porn apparently . 
  so , by this logic , i could call into work sick , saying that i feel autistic ? 
  i 'm so gon na do this . 
  i picked autism because in this case nothing is physically wrong with you either . 
  but i agree with you . 
  who are we to decide what is illness an what is n't anyway ? 
  it currently seems that pretty much every deviation from the norm can be called an illness , unless someone could feel insulted by it . 
  in my opinion we should be aware of the fact that different people act and function differently ( and some require more or different medical attention that others ) , but saying that you 're ill just because you 're different makes no sense . 
  it is good to keep a `` manual '' though . 
  [ how i imagine this sub when it turns to shit ] ( http://i.qkme.me/3skgne.jpg ),

  3:5 is the logical next step in the fibonacci sequence . 
  one step closer to the golden ratio , which would be visually perfect in theory . 
  edit : [ togo 's flag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/flag_of_togo.svg/809px-flag_of_togo.svg.png ) is 500:809 , from all flags closest to the golden ratio . 
  the lion looks fabulous . 
  fun fact : [ during the bourbon restoration period ( 1815-1830 ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bourbon_restoration ) the flag of france was actually all white . 
  [ oh liberia , your flags are so silly . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_liberia ), 
  it seems that they took the first principle of good flag design ( that the flag should be so simple a child can draw it from memory ) a little bit too literally ... 
   4.2 ~ ~ million ~ ~ light years away, 
  it 's not 4.2 million light years away . 
  even the closest spiral galaxy to the milky way is less than 4.2 million light years away ( the andromeda galaxy at approx . 
  2.5 million light years ) . 
  also , because of time dilation a spacecraft that is only approaching light speed would also be able to reach it in less than 4 years in his reference frame ( the spaceship would experience length contraction of the rest of space , so distance would be smaller for them ) . 
  but perhaps you 're talking about this kind of ftl travel . 
  but there is also another solution for ftl travel that actually does n't contradict general relativity . 
  in 1994 , mexican theoretical physicist miguel alcubierre proposed a solution that simply contracts the space before the object and expands it behind . 
  the object does n't accelerate , does n't travel faster than light in its reference frame , but because the space bubble it is enclosed in is shifting forward it would appear to move faster than light . 
  because of this , relativistic effects would not apply . 
  however , we currently have no idea if it is even possible to make such space deformation . 
  if you do n't have problems with pe and have low levels of precum , it can actually be as effective as condoms when done properly . 
  yeah . 
  why bring azog into the movie , if bolg fits into the timeline more ? 
  in the books , he was born on 1st march 2931 , which means that he turned 88 the day he met gandalf the white . 
  the same day frodo and sam started crossing the dead marshes and faramir departed minas tirith to ithilien . 
  yes , he was 88 at that time . 
  as i said , he turned 88 when he met gandalf , that is before he arrived in edoras . 
  i just gave some further info for those that are interested . 
  this is cringe-worthy . 
  yeah , i get that we redditors are all pathetic losers that read cheesy self-help shit all the time to convince us that there is still some hope for us , but it makes us seem even worse . 
  this is the most clich\u00e9d , cheesy and overused type of stuff that just gets posted over and over again . 
  think about it . 
  wait a moment . 
  is reddit really stronger than / b / ? 
  this is pathetic . 
  the top comment is even more pathetic . 
  it 's the cheesiest , most clich\u00e9d , most overused piece of pathetic self-help that is really getting annoying . 
  we do n't need this . 
  skirt . 
  i wish i were able to wear a kilt-like skirt ( i 'm not scottish ) without fear of getting weird looks everywhere i go . 
  quite likely troll . 
  if it 's on 4 chan , in greentext form , and very morally questionable , it 's usually 100 % made up . 
  however , since poe 's law holds true , there surely are some women out there that are actually capable of doing this . 
  `` it 's not a man-purse , it 's a satchel ! '', 
  that 's / b / you 're thinking of . 
  this was posted on / lgbt / . 
  in this case it still holds true though . 
  `` a corollary of poe 's law is the reverse phenomenon : sincere fundamentalist beliefs can be mistaken for a parody of those beliefs . '', 
  wait a moment . 
  is the top voted comment currently the deleted one ? 
  just one thing . 
  i understand that the alarm clock one will probably win . 
  but is it too hard to do us a little favour - and record yourself reading the navy seal gorilla warfare copypasta too ? 
  that 's the shit of legends . 
  actually , i always thought the pasta was meant to be read by you one day . 
  it seems rigged . 
  the score just does n't seem to change . 
  the ending comes from the grammatical case . 
  i do n't speak russian , but it 's almost the same in slovene as most slavic languages have the same case system ( with some differences in endings though ), 
  `` respublik '' in cccp ( sssr ) does n't have ending ( which is - i in plural ; `` respubliki '' ) because the preposition `` of '' is contained in the genitive grammatical case , which changes it into `` respublik '' . 
  in singular , this would change the `` respublika '' into `` respubliki '' . 
  english has lost the system of grammatical cases ( with exception of personal pronouns : i/me/mine , we/us/ours etc.
