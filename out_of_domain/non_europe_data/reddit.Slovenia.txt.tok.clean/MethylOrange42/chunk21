  i 'm saying this because i 'm not the kind of guy that wants some easy sex . 
  it 's much better to just be confident with yourself and your instincts should make you do the right thing by itself . 
  trust me , it worked for me , 
  ( btw , i 'm not doing nofap to get rid of some pmo addiction or to improve my self esteem , more to keep me motivated . 
  i need to stop relapsing every two weeks though ... ), 
  perhaps kill-fuck-marry in hope of another daughter . 
  dogs can be annoying . 
  you see americans , that 's why euros look like monopoly game money . 
  it 's our diet . 
  before the neolithic revolution , there was very little problem with tooth decay ( as evidenced by preserved skeletons ) . 
  the reason is that humans are not adapted to eating high-carbohydrate diet ( rich in sugars and starchy staples ) , which causes caries to develop . 
  i like how you cropped it so it 's obvious that he said `` look how innocent that g '' and not something else . 
  good job op . 
  [ regarding the lions on the coas ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lfvfr.jpg ), 
  i 've made the flags of the faroe and iceland ; since the icelandic coa is essentially same as the flag , i 've made three versions including different historical coas . 
  it 's not really ; it has no crown ... 
  you 're right . 
  as far as i know , it does n't count if it is not set upon the shield . 
  there are many coas that display the crown on the shield ; for example , the [ infamous silly bull of mecklenburg ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/mecklenburg_arms.svg/500px-mecklenburg_arms.svg.png ) has a crown too ... 
  [ \u00c9trangleur de soleils ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te24up_gzau ), 
  the album is out on july 9th . 
  atmospheric black metal ; the cover is by fursy teyssier ( of les discrets ) , who also made covers for agalloch , alcest , amesoeurs , lantl\u00f4s and woods of ypres . 
  this album includes flags of the faroe , iceland , \u00c5land and estonia in style of / u/yogpod 's [ flags of scandinavian countries ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/1ggzpc/scandinavian_flags_with_their_coat_of_arms/ ) . 
  ( only \u00c5land is really `` scandinavian '' though ... but i wanted to keep the same title ) . 
  i 've preserved the original proportions of the flags . 
  since the current icelandic coa is esentially the same as flag , i 've used the previous coa , that was used from 1903 to 1919 . 
  there are two alternate versions : [ with commonwealth coa ( 930 - 1262 ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gldq4xxh.png ) and [ with coa with stockfish ( 16th cen . 
  for estonia , i 've used alternate nordic cross version of the flag . 
  i wanted to include shetland and orkney too , but i could n't find coas in svg format ... 
  sigh ... 
  i based it on the nordic cross version of the flag , in the same way as other flags are based on the current nordic cross flags . 
  it was actually included in the coa svg already , and since it looked good , i kept it  the faroese one did n't really need it in my opinion though , as the colour stands out enough as is . 
  norway has been done before in this style ... 
  [ well , after doing reverse image search , maybe it 's not that original ... ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_the_alliance_to_restore_the_republic.svg ) but this is how i always imagined the flag of rebels would look like . 
  it just works great with those black stripes . 
  the old republic 's flag is essentially the same as that of the empire , but with octagonal instead of hexagonal design , as seen on [ this picture ] ( http://images.wikia.com/starwars/images/7/79/75generalgrievousfinal.jpg ) . 
  new republic would use similar insignia as the rebellion . 
  [ here 's a description of new republic 's insignia ] ( http://images.wikia.com/starwars/images/0/02/logo_new_republic.jpg ) - i might do this one later . 
   kid is naive and knows nothing about sex, 
   kid does something sexual but is n't aware of it, 
   parents freak out, 
   parents tell him everything about sex, 
   kid has sex soon, 
  giving the talk seems like a very bad idea ... 
  not the empire , but the old republic . 
  assuming that the flag did n't really change when empire took over . 
  o type stars have lifespan of some million or maybe ten million years , so there would definitely not be enough time for life to develop , so there would not be any indigenous . 
  the star would practically blow up before planets fully formed - for example , moon was formed by collision of another planet with earth when sun was around 100 million years old . 
  the habitable zone is also too far for successful accretion . 
  typical o-type star would be 100000 times as luminous as sun , that would mean habitable zone would be at around 300-350 a.u. 
  ( square root of luminosity ) , which would mean it would take more than 1000 years to complete one orbit , so accretion would happen much slower than for earth . 
  the separatist confederacy , main opposition to the republic in the prequels . 
  i just found [ a picture ] ( http://images.wikia.com/starwars/images/a/ab/rebelvictoryatcoruscant.jpg ) which features a flag of the new republic , so it will be based on this one . 
  this album includes previously posted flags of rebels and empire . 
  if there are requests for more star wars flags , let me know . 
  [ even better . 
  [ full backstory of the symbol . 
  ] ( http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/galactic_roundel ), 
  [ my version of the flag ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/suwxs2zh.png ) i think the stars look best if they 're white . 
  fixed . 
  it seems that there is no true canon on the flags . 
  the symbols themselves are well recognized though . 
  ... with nordic cross flags . 
  oh god i was this autistic 5 years ago . 
  i literally did shit this autismal . 
   the colours are separated by white stripes . 
  the red at the top symbolizes the sun , as well as the savanna . 
  below the red is blue that symbolizes the gambia river that flows through the nation . 
  the green symbolizes the land , and also the forests of the nation . 
  the white portions represent peace . 
  the gambia is literally defined by the gambia river . 
  the french , who controlled senegal , gave the british land around the downstream gambia river . 
  i literally did the same as the stories 2 , 6 , and 7 , most of the others i would n't do , because i prefer little titties ... but here you go, 
   first day in highschool fuckyeah, 
   knew some guys from before , most did n't know me, 
   i 'll let them know that i 'm a misunderstood poetic tortured soul, 
   when we were describing ourselves i ended by saying `` you 'll get to know me well enough '', 
   half class laughs , other half does n't know what to think, 
   two weeks forward, 
   everyone knows of my condition because i make strange sounds and live in an imaginary world, 
   biology class , 4th floor, 
   people are sitting next to the window, 
   `` hey anon , do you dare to sit on the windowshelf ? '', 
   of course i do i 'm no pussy, 
   i even put my legs outside, 
   laughs.mp3, 
   teacher enters classroom, 
   i literally got suspended for self-harming behaviour, 
  there is much more but it 's painful for me to remember ... 
  edit : changed my name in the greentext to anon , just because . 
  you all know my username anyway, 
   next spring, 
   was crushing on some girl from my class since winter, 
   i was literally obsessed with her, 
   4/10 crazy obnoxious bitch , perfectionist, 
   it started because our class was playing secret friends in december and somehow i got her, 
   anyway , some weekend, 
   iwanttoridemybicycle.mp3, 
   hmm let 's find out where to go, 
   combine spying powers to track her home address,
