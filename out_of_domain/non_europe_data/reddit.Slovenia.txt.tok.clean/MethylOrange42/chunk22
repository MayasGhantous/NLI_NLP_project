   it took me some phone number searches and hoping to pin down an address by googling her surname, 
   greatsuccess.jpg, 
   arrive at her family 's house, 
   ring a phone, 
   wtf no answer, 
   do it again next minute, 
   repeat it 6-8 times, 
   her father comes outside raging, 
   the beta aspie i was , i started fleeing for my life, 
  now that i look back at it , i have no idea what i was thinking . 
  she was a terrible person , unattractive , full of herself , and i was a complete idiot . 
  she changed school next year anyway ; possibly because of me . 
  and that 's it . 
  i 'm not posting any more humiliating greentext stories . 
  it 's time to sleep here in europe . 
  i was never really diagnosed ( not that i know it , i have a suspicion that my parents were told , but did n't want to raise me as a special snowflake ) , so i 'm not really sure , but whenever i read about high functioning autism , i feel like i 'm reading about my own childhood . 
  after a complete failure of that year i realized that the source of my problems is my complete lack of social skills . 
  i started analyzing how social interactions work and slowly i started gaining confidence . 
  i also fell in love with another girl , so it kept me motivated . 
  it took me full two years to start functioning like a normal guy , but it was worth it . 
  how did i improve social skills ? 
  i mostly forced myself into situations that made me feel uncomfortable . 
  i started some random conversations in library , i bought myself shoes and clothes on my own , i started going to concerts ( where it 's easy to meet people with mutual friends ) ... 
  in general , it improved as soon as i started living like i 'm a normal guy and stopped avoiding social interaction . 
  i 'm not sure if i can say i 'm completely normal or i just act normal , but i do n't think there 's a big difference anyway . 
  i could say that i 'm used to acting normal well enough that i can do it without any difficulties , and it comes naturally . 
  every person has its own quirks , and i 'm no different - only that my quirks actually kept me from having a decent childhood . 
  about that girl ( the second one ) - she , naturally , rejected me back then , but as i was improving , i kept connected with her , mostly by facebook . 
  she got very sick last year in highschool , so she did n't finish it with the rest of the class . 
  we became good friends , and we go out together sometimes . 
  i got a girlfriend later ( who dumped me 4 months ago because she felt i was n't paying her enough attention or something like that , but this is another story ) , so i also was n't burdened by the `` friendzone '' . 
  now that i 've changed ( i prefer to say that i 've grown up , because it makes me feel more normal ) , i think that i actually might have some chances with her . 
  because they 're ashamed of themselves , and because it makes them feel nice to see that there are people out there with more serious issues than them .

  you , sir , are a scholar and a gentleman . 
  it 's unrelated . 
  the big one has no true meaning , while the small ones are meant to resemble gaucho spurs . 
  colours ( burgundy and black ) are traditional poncho colours in the region . 
  the flag was designed in 1996 by a group of students who won the public contest . 
  87 could go if you added one star in the middle line in the wyoming-86 configuration , so numbers of stars would be 13-12-12-13-12-12-13 . 
  similar for 69 : add one star in the middle line in oregon-68 configuration : 10-10-10-9-10-10-10 . 
  both cases would preserve symmetry , only the alternating length pattern would be broken .

  he already has two kids actually . 
  and he seems to be doing this for quite long time too . 
  this is quite ironic , since classical music seems to stay forever , while pop music is soon forgotten ... 
  wow , til catholic means liberal . 
  checkmate , atheists !, 
  one way of calculating would be slicing the sphere into thin slices - infinitesimally . 
  slices start at zero size , reach maximum radius ( = r ) at the middle , and then decrease in size again . 
  it can be shown ( using pythagoras ' theorem ) that , if center slice has coordinate zero , and endpoints - r and + r , the slice at coordinate x has radius r = sqrt ( r \u00b2 - x \u00b2 ) . 
  now , let 's integrate over the whole sphere . 
  coordinate x flows from - r to + r , and surface of each slice s ( x ) = \u03c0r \u00b2 = \u03c0 ( r \u00b2 - x \u00b2 ) . 
  integrating sdx gives \u03c0 \u222b ( r \u00b2 - x \u00b2 ) dx , which equals \u03c0 ( r \u00b2 x-x \u00b3 / 3 ) . 
  definite integral between - r and r thus equals 2\u03c0r \u00b3 -2 r \u00b3 / 3 = 4\u03c0r \u00b3 / 3 . 
  the last album was utter trainwreck if you ask me though . 
  and this is coming from a guy who actually owns cds of the first two albums . 
  to me it seems like they lost touch with the music they play . 
  from all the tracks written for mylo xyloto , i liked moving to mars the most . 
  and guess what ? 
  it did n't even get on the album . 
  it was released only on the itunes exclusive digital ep every teardrop is a waterfall . 
  now it only needs more nordic cross . 
  ( not really , but the design simply calls for it ), 
   present legislation stipulates the crime of rape applies only when men force sex . 
  in contrast , women who force an unwilling partner to have sex face charges of sexual violation . 
  both carry a maximum sentence of 20 years but only men can be charged with rape . 
  it seems that we 're arguing semantics here . 
  it 's hard to criticize in private circles when you do n't know who might be a spy . 
  during the 80s , there was a similar problem in slovenia ; my father who worked at a science institute told me that there were some people working there that looked suspicious , but you could never be sure . 
  it has later been revealed that udba , the yugoslav state security organization , had approximately one spy per hundred people . 
  currently , the problem is that one percent of population of slovenia knows a little bit too much because they were former spies , and archives are closed , so nobody can be persecuted for it ... 
  now that you mentioned it , there is a very similar difference . 
  the difference between civil union and marriage would be that marriage starts a family ( is biologically productive ) . 
  this could also be said to be the difference between rape and sexual violation - the victim can be left with a child . 
  adoption and child support , however , skew the difference so that there is practically none . 
  but this is again semantics , because one could take practically any definition and then argue that his definition is the correct one . 
  why not 26 stripes then ? 
  13 red and 13 white ? 
  you 're right . 
  the main problem with the law is that there is so much semantics involved . 
  but in this case , it seems that it is the same on paper - the maximum sentence is the same . 
  also , even if both ways were described as rape , there would still be less social stigma for ( alleged ) women rapists - the reason being that society does n't take female-on-male rape as seriously as the other way around , regardless of the laws . 
  tl ; dr : anon uses cheatcodes because the game is not fun enough for his underage attention span . 
  maybe this is the point of the movie . 
  that everything is so vague that it simply calls for fan theories . 
  and i like that . 
  having an omnipotent narrator is good for understanding of the story , but it is much more exciting if there is none . 
  immersion in story is better , because you know as much as the characters do , and it makes you wonder - what is behind all this ? 
  switching to vector graphics might be a good idea too . 
  compare with [ flag of corsica ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/flag_of_corsica.svg/1000px-flag_of_corsica.svg.png ) . 
   broduce, 
  that was a good one . 
  this reminds me of the flag of the [ bourbon restoration era france ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/flag_of_the_kingdom_of_france_%281814-1830%29.svg/500px-flag_of_the_kingdom_of_france_%281814-1830%29.svg.png ) .
