  nope , it 's not . 
  hong kong is under the government of prc in beijing , even though it has its own special laws . 
   in 2001 , religious authorities in the united arab emirates issued a fatw\u0101 against the children 's game pok\u00e9mon , after finding that it encouraged gambling , and was based on the theory of evolution , `` a jewish-darwinist theory , that conflicts with the truth about humans and with islamic principles '' . 
  i 'm not so sure about that ... well , once you go crazy fundie , it does n't matter what religion or philosophy you follow . 
  soviet russia under stalin was against ( darwinian ) evolution too and even had extensive lamarckian experiments ( which all failed , obviously ),

  ilija is `` only '' 961m , but yeah , it looks majestic still . 
  florida kind of makes sense , considering that death metal was developed there , similar to how black metal is norwegian and melodeath metal is swedish . 
  if you ca n't find a grim vnd frostbitten place during summer , at least travel somewhere brutal . 
  we could still add lime between yellow and green , brown above red , and pink under violet ... 
  it 's an alpine pasture , the wooden huts were used by shepherds during the summer . 
  it 's quite easily accessible and close to the capital , and hiking is quite popular in slovenia , so you see a lot of visitors during the weekends . 
  most of the huts are used as private vacation property nowadays . 
  i have no idea if they have a special name , but they are unique in that this type of shepherd huts is found only here and on nearby velika planina . 
  \u2112\u212fterally this . 
  damn , that 's a nice cup . 
  edit : it 's because beau means beautiful and coupe means cup . 
  oh carl degrasse dawkins i 'm so smart . 
  [ re\u2112\u212fvant ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etfiuyij5ue ), 
  did you know that they 're called fundies because it 's fun watching them die ? 
  gradients do n't work well on flags , but since there are different stages of sleep , you could go with something like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/j5yibwl.png ) too . 
  this is on mountain top , karst terrain , altitude around 1500m , which is close to the general tree line in slovenian alps . 
  also , the slopes of the mountain are heavily forested , so it 's not a problem for erosion . 
  tree line is at 1600-1700m in slovenia , because slovenia has higher snowfall and colder winters than the rest of the alps . 
  also , people actually lived in the valley , but alps have a tradition of seasonal mountain pastures , which means that herdsmen moved their livestock ( mostly cattle and sheep ) to mountain pastures ( planine in slovene , that 's where the name comes from ) above the tree line during the summer . 
  produce was grown by the people who stayed in the valleys . 
  what you want to have is an ocean planet ; a huge super-earth with large amounts of water , just a bit too warm and small to start developing into a gas giant ( around 8 earth mass and 2 earth radii ) . 
  such planet should start forming in outer regions of solar system , but was somehow pushed into inner regions before it was completely formed , resulting in mixed icy-rocky composition . 
  massive ocean , hundreds of kilometres deep , would provide water , and because of high pressure resulting from thick atmosphere there would be no ocean surface ( supercritical fluid ) . 
  oxygen and nitrogen would be formed by breakdown of water and ammonia in higher layers of atmosphere by star radiation , and since there is no solid surface , oxygen would not oxidize it as it happened on mars ( which is literally covered in rust , hence the colour ) , so it would stay in the atmosphere . 
  this is purely speculative , of course , as we 're not able to detect ( most ) exoplanet atmospheres to confirm it , but some planetary formation models show that such planets should exist . 
  also , kepler-22b looks like it could fall into this type , with 2.4 earth radii and under 30 , most likely around 10 earth mass ( this planet was discovered by transit , so mass is uncertain ) . 
  kepler-11b and -11 c could also be such planets , as they have a bit higher density as it would be expected if they were just mini-neptunes . 
  also , kepler-22b looks like it could fall into this type , with 2.4 earth radii and under 30 , most likely around 10 earth mass ( this planet was discovered by transit , so mass is uncertain ) . 
  kepler-11b and -11 c could also be such planets , as they have a bit higher density as it would be expected if they were just mini-neptunes . 
  since those planets fit model 's predictions , it means that it 's most likely a good model ( this is how science works ) . 
   the same composition as earth but 8 times the mass, 
  i 'm talking about planets that formed beyond the snowline and only later migrated inwards . 
  perhaps similar composition to mars or galilean moons . 
  i 'm not sure about o * _ 2 _ * - n * _ 2 _ * atmosphere stability , but again , this would only mean that composition would change in lower layers of atmosphere , because of higher molar entropy of nitrogen oxides . 
  larger planets are expected to have thicker atmospheres and the conditions you mentioned are comparable with venus ( 460 \u00b0 c and 92 atm ) . 
  most of venus ' atmosphere is co * _ 2 _ * , though , so it 's clearly not the same . 
  when they were shooting lotr , hobbits and gimli were scaled the same . 
  all the difference comes from john rhys-davies being 1.85 m ( 6 ' 1 '' ) . 
  i have made two designs , both are based on the historical flag and coat of arms from wikipedia :, 
  [ `` boring '' coat-of-arms-on-flag design , nothing really unique ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0q46ldd ), 
  [ diagonal design based on the coat of arms ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sxljje4.png ), 
  the colours come from the current coat of arms of gauteng , while the symbol in the middle is taken from the coat of arms of johannesburg , the largest city in gauteng . 
  since gauteng in sesotho means `` place of gold '' because of gold mining here , gold as colour on flag seems a very appropriate choice . 
  also , how large is thembuland in your project ? 
  does it include entire xhosa ethnic land ( most of eastern cape province ) ? 
  it would help me in picking appropriate symbols . 
  flag of st. helena is in works too . 
  anc flag with a traditional shield with indwe ( the blue crane ) on it . 
  blue crane is a national bird of south africa , and has great cultural significance in xhosa culture - heroes were honoured by receiving its feathers from the chief . 
  the bird , wirebird , is taken from the coat of arms . 
  the cross represents the true cross , which was found by st. helena of constantinople , which the island is named after ( making her kind of a patron saint ) . 
  the design is simplified [ appearance ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/st-helena-jamestown.jpg ) of the port of jamestown , the capital on the island , viewed from the sea . 
  edit : i do n't like how the flag of st. helena turned out very much , perhaps a simpler design with just the bird on a yellow field would be better ? 
  you can post the requests here , no need to make too much posts if you like my designs and i have enough time ... 
  btw , what project do you need those for ? 
  you mentioned 700 + countries , are you building some kind of `` balkanized '' world ? 
  i use inkscape and the most important things i 've learned :, 
  * draw a sketch on paper first . 
  finding correct ratios is much easier that way . 
  * using guidelines is crucial . 
  laying down a custom grid can make design much cleaner . 
  * for inkscape , you can find some objects already done in svg format . 
  they 're either on coats of arms and flags on wikipedia , or can be found with google . 
  if you ca n't find any , import image of it as a bitmap and draw on it using pencil tool ( you can simplify the curve later ) . 
  * some colours do n't look well together . 
  if you find a flag or a coat of arms with similar colour palette that looks good , use the same colours . 
  for bas-congo you can use the historical [ flag of the kingdom of kongo ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/flag_of_the_kingdom_of_kongo.svg/900px-flag_of_the_kingdom_of_kongo.svg.png ) , which was in the same area . 
  for the [ flag of dom people ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wmh3dpf.png ) i took the wheel from the romani flag and combined it with middle-eastern look . 
  the rest seem really hard , i have no idea what could be done , other than just throwing some colours together and making a cool looking flag with no true meaning . 
  this looks like [ plica polonica ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_plait ) , it 's what happens if you do n't wash your hair and it entangles together into thick mass of hair . 
  design comes from the coat of arms of cape province , without the lion for england and netherlands . 
  [ flag of south african greeks ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ae45ahq.png ), 
  mashup of the greek and the orange free state flags . 
  ... so you mean that the coat of arms is n't just supposed to hang in mid-air ? 
  i 've managed to find a traditional [ cloth pattern ] ( http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/p480x480/377739_298133573647909_2126956891_n.jpg ) and simply put it on the flag - this is probably one of the most unique looking flags . 
  sounds like an epic quest of removing kebab on the seven seas . 
  barbarossa would make an awesome antagonist . 
  i also expect to see dat face soldier with his kebab removal crew . 
  the coat of arms is essentially the same as the historical coat of arms of kotromani\u0107 family who ruled bosnia 1250-1467 , it is thought to represent the native bosnian lily . 
  mmm , bacon . 
  if nothing else , they surrendered the flag itself ... 
   the alliance starbird , also known as the *** phoenix *** , was the insignia of the alliance to restore the republic . 
  yep , it 's a phoenix . 
  this flag was ( luckily ) never used as the official flag of eu . 
  this version includes colours from flags of all 15 members of eu , as of 2002 , when this design was proposed . 
  austria has used this flag as a [ symbol its presidency of the eu in 2006 ] ( http://euobserver.com/media/src/1082d88e25bd667e558ae12827338693.jpg ) , including colours of all 25 member countries .
