  as they say , snacks are good in moderation , but you can quickly make a bad choice and do it a bit too much . 
  i have bad experiences with this . 
  i never watched porn , instead i fapped to my imagination . 
  i was a virgin back then , and the results were - terrible . 
  i developed terrible one-itis with my crush , because i was basically having sex with her in my mind multiple times a week , and this is something you do n't want to happen . 
  but , this is what happens if you go over reasonable amount . 
  i 'd also recommend fapping just once a week - if you really have to , because of hormone levels . 
  also , stress may not be as bad as it sounds - if you know how to use it , you can channel it to accomplish great things . 
  i also do n't trust credible medical sources that much - but this is just me . 
  the reason is that samples are usually far too small , and there are many other factors involved - for example , it 's very different if you decide on yourself not to fap or if you 're forced into it . 
  peer review also means that dogmas can easily be forced in `` soft '' science - which medicine is . 
  anyway , it 's a personal choice , as much as doing no-fap after the 90 days reboot . 
  it also depend from person to person , so i 'd recommend doing what you feel is best for you . 
  you can use the res to tag main srs users ( go to their subreddit and just tag those that seem to post a lot ) . 
  their posts will be revealed to you by that tag . 
  i have n't tried that yet , though , so i have no idea how much they actually shitpost , and if they are n't just a downvote brigade outside their subreddits . 
  it 's still possible that they dual-account , which would mean that this technique is not effective . 
  who says some animals do n't have free will ? 
  and it 's not right to assume people do n't have instincts - in fact , they seem to rule our behaviour more often that free will does . 
  actually , he considered jews on the same level as aryans - this is why they were actually seen as a threat . 
  in contrast , blacks were not considered harmful , as they were seen as lesser men . 
  the problem was that jews were considered different from aryans by nature , and thus incompatible with the idea of racially pure germany . 
  the problem is also that all humans are not created equal . 
  we are different by nature , and no law can change that . 
  people will always have advantages and disadvantages , and forcing some system to fight this would be unfair . 
  for example : drugging those people that are smarter than others so that they ca n't use their advantage does n't really seem fair , right ? 
  i like the flag , just link to the png-rendered pic instead next time : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/flag_of_setomaa.svg/1350px-flag_of_setomaa.svg.png, 
  i recommend the following to improve the design :, 
  * move the stripes and the star to the left side of the flag ( next to the flagpole ) ; this way it is well visible when the flag is flown . 
  * separate the two black stripes , because currently it looks like a single thicker stripe . 
  * make the blue and green stripe thicker ( they 're just as important as the white stripe on the shield ) . 
  * the blue stripe should not touch the colonial blue field . 
  * preserve the original fainter colonial blue colour of the field . 
  * make the diamond and the seashell/sunrise slightly smaller ; i 'd recommend it spanning two thirds of the field ( similar to the original flag ) , sans the stripes on the left . 
  the resulting flag would look like this : http://i.imgur.com/2brkgjh.png ( you did the seashell/sunrise better than me though , and the flag could have longer proportions ), 
  i like the idea behind the design though , just the execution of it is kind of poor . 
  i think it 's included as a symbol of the [ m\u00e9tis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m%c3%a9tis_people_ ( canada \\ ) ) . 
  [ red wing flag for red wing keep . 
  ( the flag is not rectangular , but wing-shaped . ), 
  in this moment , he is euphoric . 
  not because of any phony god 's blessing . 
  but because , he is enlightened by his intelligence . 
  also , are we reviving the [ misunderstood shark ] ( http://i.imgur.com/slspraq.jpg ) meme ? 
  you 're obviously american . 
  do you even line break ? 
  just saying . 
  as an european , i 'm used to better . 
  this is like reading a book and then they say you stole the knowledge and you should instead go to university . 
  exactly . 
  once you elect the government , it automatically has the legitimacy , no matter what they do . 
  if the people in power are appointed , they need to earn this legitimacy through their work . 
  scots do , but they call them kilts . 
  they also get pissed if you remind them that it is indeed a skirt . 
  as a slovenian , i have ~ ~ no ~ ~ problem saying neither the op 's tongue twister , nor the polish ones ( though i get lost when reading in all the sz 's and cz 's ) . 
  also , have a slovenian tongue twister : `` iz j\u00e9\u017e ` ce \u010dez c\u00e9sto v sto\u017e ` ce po r\u00f3\u017e ` ce . '', 
  ( i added the accents because we have two different accentations for e and o , which makes it quite confusing sometimes . ), 
  i believe you , as a native speaker , never make mistakes . 
  the waves represent the selenge river ( which flows through this province in to the baikal lake in russia ) . 
  i 'm a guy and i feel the same about girls . 
  and i know i am probably weird - but hey , it 's natural , and it 's not that i like women to be overly hairy . 
  you are affected , but i still think that you 're too young . 
  hell , i 'm 19 and i still feel that i 'm a bit too young - i mostly just lurk this sub to get more familiar with the issues . 
  i advise you not to take it too seriously , before you do something you may regret later on . 
  remember that you 're still growing up . 
  however , following the movement ( but not actively supporting ) might be a good idea for now . 
  or the corsairs of the barbary coast . 
  he probably posted this because he does n't know too . 
  you can skip any number of dots you want ( as long as it 's less than half the number of points ) . 
  the more dots you skip , the sharper the points of the star will be . 
  read wikipedia 's entry on [ star polygons ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/star_polygon ) for more info . 
  there are also 3d stars ; they 're called stellated polyhedra . 
  example : [ small stelated dodecahedron ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/smallstellateddodecahedron.gif ) . 
  actually , yes . 
  it 's far too easy to look like a jerk discussing issues you obviously never experienced . 
  actually , it 's just the same as a rich neighbourhood living girl talking about how women are treated badly . 
  but , to read them , not . 
  as i said , following is ok . 
  just because they used this argument , it does n't mean that it 's wrong . 
  i think heredity is determined using twin studies ( where they were adopted by different families ) , so it 's not that socioeconomic status of the family could have any effect . 
  similarities ( from wikipedia , from `` iq testing 101 , alan s. kaufman , 2009 , springer publishing company , isbn 978-0-8261-0629-2 '' ) :, 
  * same person ( tested twice ) .95, 
  * identical twins -- reared together .86, 
  * identical twins -- reared apart .76, 
  * fraternal twins -- reared together .55, 
  * fraternal twins -- reared apart .35, 
  * biological siblings -- reared together .47, 
  * biological siblings -- reared apart .24, 
  * unrelated children -- reared together .30, 
  * parent-child -- living together .42, 
  * parent-child -- living apart .22, 
  * adoptive parent -- child -- living together .19, 
  as we can see , even if identical twins are reared apart , they still have higher iq correlation than biological siblings . 
  however , the study also shows that a large portion is also influenced by environment ( see unrelated children -- reared together ) . 
  also , i do n't support eugenics , but not because it 's evil or anything , but because it 's not up to us to decide what is good and what is bad . 
  why should iq score be such a good thing anyway ? 
  he still does n't know that proper plural form of genius is actually genii . 
  i like how orientation/attraction does n't list `` pedophile '' as an option . 
  `` intelligent '' at the top, 
  smugness at its finest .
