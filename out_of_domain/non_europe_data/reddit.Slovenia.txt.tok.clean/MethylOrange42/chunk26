  i decided to scrap all traditional symbolism and instead create something new and modern looking . 
  instead of using symbols of both sides , i used symbols that unite them . 
  the flag is a tricolour , but the stripes are not straight but wavy , to make the flag look different , and to resemble what they represent better . 
  blue is for the waters of northern ireland , especially the lough neagh , which lies in the centre of northern ireland ( and also supplies 40 % of its drinking water ) . 
  green is for the hilly countryside , and the white ( sky ) represents peace and a new beginning . 
  in top left corner , there is flax flower , which represents the linen industry . 
  also , flax is already used as a symbol of the northern ireland assembly ( but as a whole plant , not just the flower ) , which strengthens its role as a symbol of consensus between the unionists and the nationalists . 
  ... but to make a continuous 12-pointed star , you need to skip every 4 dots : skipping one creates two hexagons , skipping two creates three squares and skipping three creates six triangles .

  i love inkscape 's built-in trace bitmap feature . 
  i actually remember having a dream with this creature . 
  it was weird as fuck . 
  yes , i do nofap . 
  i 'm quite sure it was about hagrid actually . 
  joke posts belong [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/1k3bro/august_2013_contest_submission_thread/cbkxktv ) . 
  apparently it 's another micronation . 
  reverse the colours maybe ? 
  i also know a some people ( in europe , of course ) that are atheist because of their parents . 
  and when i say atheist , i mean that they are not allowed to celebrate christmas because it a religious holiday . 
  actually , slovenian flag is derived from the colours on the coa of carniola : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f1/carniola_coat_of_arms.png, 
  the fact that they 're the same as the pan-slavic colours is just the reason why it has never been changed later . 
  i do n't know , daejeon made a quite terrible change too ... 
  alternate version looks a lot like [ flag of idrija , slovenia ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kcem4t6.png ) . 
  you 're just perpetuating the rape culture , nothing serious . 
  sidelocks actually . 
  sideburns are grown from facial hair . 
  if it sounds strange and is about a special group of people , check tumblr . 
  closer to 1500 than 150 actually . 
  it was probably arch enemy . 
  yes , that 's why he was so shocked . 
  also , ghoti ' is klingon for fish . 
  [ challenge accepted . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/1k7gkc/meta_there_will_be_bandwagons/ ), 
  luckily for me , sweden 's coa has a similar layout to flag of maryland , so i just re-used the pattern . 
  ^ ( ( let 's get this trend going ! ) ), 
  the horse is taken from the state emblem . 
  i like this game . 
  [ here is marylandified mongolia .

  the central motif ( the eagle ) dates back to the 13th century . 
  in 1463 emperor frederick iii added the imperial crown ( the duchy was a hereditary land of the habsburgs ) and added gold colour into the checkered crescent ( which was red and white before ) . 
  in 1836 , gold was replaced with white once again , and the colours from the coat of arms was used in 1848 to create the slovenian tricolour - white , blue , red ( same as russia ) . 
  [ flag of mali ( 1959-1961 ) ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/flag_of_mali_1959-1961.svg/450px-flag_of_mali_1959-1961.svg.png ), 
  i would continue , but i want to let others create some flags too . 
  nice cancer, 
   sidelocks . 
  payot if you 's a ~ ~ jew ~ ~ dwarven ~ ~ gentleman ~ ~ lady . 
  [ belgium it is then . 
  [ better version . 
  it 's much easier to make a clean design and good proportions using inkscape or some other vector graphic program . 
  also , you can get most flags and coats of arms in svg format on wikipedia , ready for editing . 
  it 's a mercy kill apparently . 
  otherwise it makes absolutely no sense . 
  the negus ruled ethiopia until the coup of 1974 . 
  that 's why i said it 's a mercy kill . 
  you do n't feel shame once you 're dead . 
  where the fuck is his belly button ? 
  there is a very big difference between being religious and spiritual . 
  a spiritual person tends to think and experience on their own , while a religious person mostly just follows their spiritual leaders . 
  this is not necessarily a bad thing though , letting someone smarter than you to think instead of you is sometimes good actually . 
  i mean , six actually . 
  this time , it started with a meta post about those trends , saying that someone will make a marylandified flag , and everyone will jump the bandwagon . 
  guess what happened . 
  wait a moment . 
  if rape is `` unwilling insertion of one 's penis into the mouth , anus or vagina of another '' , does n't that mean that woman can commit rape if she unwillingly inserts someone 's penis into herself ? 
  slovenian here ; judging from where the churches are , i think the village in front is spodnji brnik , and then zgornji brnik , cerklje and grad in the background . 
  the mountains in the background are grintovec on the left , skuta and kal\u0161ka gora on the right . 
  and yes , in slovenia , every small village has its own church ; some are also standing alone on hills with scenic views ( example : http://17slon.com/blogs/slovoni/images/sv.-jakob-nad-katarino_108c9/image.png ) . 
  but they are small churches mostly . 
  this is how journalism works . 
  for everything , you have several `` poetic '' alternate names that nobody else uses , because they sound so lame . 
  that 's the last album only . 
  before this , they had four albums about wars of the 20th century , two of them mostly about ww2 . 
  ( and one , metalizer , that was the first they wrote , which has no main theme ), 
  swallow and hold it there ; it moves upwards . 
  if it does n't move up enough to shave the top , yawn and it moves downwards , allowing you to shave the skin on top . 
  i have random red hairs in between also . 
  also , my grandfather had brown scalp hair and red beard . 
  most of songs on fist for fight were re-recorded for metalizer actually . 
  you 're right . 
  skuta is a bit further right . 
  it is our fault that we are so bad at graphical design ... 
  i personally think that the waves make it stand out a bit . 
  i did n't get this joke . 
  i 'm not sure if i should actually be proud of it . 
  ... the flag-inside-flag on the left is supposed to be mirrored ; this can be seen by checking the order of colours on the middle flag-inside-flag-inside-flag . 
  when i was 16 , i wore l t-shirts and now , 19 , i wear m t-shirts . 
  whenever someone else buys me one as a gift ( that i probably never wear anyway ) , i get an xl . 
  is it so hard to understand how clothes are supposed to fit and that just because i 'm 6 ' 1 '' i 'm not super-sized ? 
  i 'm against supporting transsexualism , but i would n't really care . 
  i understand that people have different quirks and flaws , and so do i ; therefore i do not judge people on what they are , but who they are . 
  though i would be curious how and why you could n't accept your birth-gender . 
  wow , you must be one classy gentleman . 
  [ i ca n't believe it 's not butter !, 
  [ love knows not the bounds of age . 
  to admire the beauty of prepubescent girls is entirely healthy , unlike feeling such hate for people online . 
  you have my pity . 
  i know of [ suicidator ] ( http://cgchan.com/suicidator/ ) which is free , but i never used it . 
  [ subversion ] ( http://www.introversion.co.uk/subversion/ ) also had a nice city generator , but the project was scrapped and i do n't know what happened to it . 
  from what i understand , it 's a plugin for blender ( which is free as well ) .
