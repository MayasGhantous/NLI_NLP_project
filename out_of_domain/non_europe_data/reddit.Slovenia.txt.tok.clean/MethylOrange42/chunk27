  ironically , you used to have [ quite a nice flag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/flag_of_maine_1901.svg/1200px-flag_of_maine_1901.svg.png ) ... 
  what if she does n't have skype ? 
  back to fb . 
  edit : to clarify ; if you and she have fb , you do n't need to use any other chat client . 
  if you do n't , that 's a different story . 
  some of us still use `` brick phones '' that make texting inconvenient . 
  i sure can send messages , but to chat ... it 's harder . 
  it 's more like sending short e-mails than chatting . 
  [ pic related , it 's my phone . 
  the cross with 4 firesteels ( c-s ) is serbian , the chequy is croatian , and the eagle is carniolan ( slovenian ) . 
  this symbolizes the unity of the three nations that formed the kingdom of serbs , croats and slovenes , later renamed to become the kingdom of yugoslavia ( jug = south , so yugoslavia means south-slav-land ) . 
  this was never an official flag though . 
  [ globus - save me ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt_gfb3l4vk ) . 
  i remember when the album came out in 2011 . 
  i was really hype - from the previews it was apparent that they 're not writing just some epic orchestral music fit for a trailer , but that they are actually making great songs . 
  i was n't really sure if the first song was what i was expecting , but as i was listening to the album the first time , it was just getting better and better - a combination of epic orchestration and massive rock tunes . 
  and then comes the track 5 - save me . 
  amazing song . 
  it has a slight queen-vibe to it , and this combined with professional orchestration and great vocals sounds just great to me . 
  and the song just keeps building up for almost six minutes . 
  massive . 
  and the lyrics !, 
  the song , as i understand it , are actually told from a perspective of a man on the verge of suicide . 
  but - they 're not depressed or dark . 
  he 's more concerned with his mistakes and anxious about it . 
  in a way , it is like a plea , a prayer . 
  it 's one of those rare songs that are pure 10/10 in my opinion . 
  they 're actually older than that , dating back to the [ byzantines ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/byzantine_imperial_flag%2c_14th_century.svg/503px-byzantine_imperial_flag%2c_14th_century.svg.png ) , where they were meant to be read as betas : basileus basile\u014dn , basileu\u014dn basileuont\u014dn ( king of kings , ruling over kings ) . 
  so , it 's actually the motto that is modelled after the symbol , and not vice versa . 
  i upvoted your comment just because i believe it is actually ironic . 
  \u0178 not ? 
  20 % of girls under age 12 surely have had their father change their clothes once in their lifetime . 
  ca n't refute this . 
  slovenian keyboard on ubuntu . 
  i can write pretty much everything . 
  my keyboard includes : \u00e6 , \u00f8 , \u00fe , \u00f0 , cents , \u0167 , \u0127 , then i can also write using combining diacritics \u016f , \u01eb , \u0173 , \u1e85 , \u0144 , \u013a , \u010b , \u0121 , \u1e57 , \u1e0b , \u1e8b ... 
  this is also because modern architecture likes to use designs that are similar to cg . 
  so many flat surfaces , clean textures , simple lighting , etc. 
  rendering a room of a countryside house where an old couple lives somehow seems much harder to make look good with cg to me . 
  or baroque architecture . 
  somehow , i feel startled by modern architecture and interior design irl too . 
  it looks too unreal and cold to me . 
  reminds me of the [ flag of st.louis ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/flag_of_st._louis%2c_missouri.svg/800px-flag_of_st._louis%2c_missouri.svg.png ) . 
  flag of usa in shape and proportions of the czech flag . 
  a bit similar in design to the flags of puerto rico and cuba . 
  i tried to make a balanced pattern of stars , but it 's hard to work with a triangular field . 
  alternate version with 55 stars ( before deleting 5 of them ) : http://i.imgur.com/hnkptwy.png, 
  maybe . 
  but i do n't like the appearance of a big void area in the right edge . 
  edit : another possibility : http://i.imgur.com/cxzzqyz.png, 
  [ one last attempt . 
  edit : it also sucks that 1 +3 +5 +7 +9 +11 +13 = 49 , so i 'm one star short if i go with ~ ~ this ~ ~ bottom pattern . 
  actually , that one does have 50 stars . 
  49 stars is the closest perfect triangle that can be attained . 
  [ or just turn the cross into a hammer . 
  [ http://www.4chan.org] ( http://www.happypuppies.net ), 
  pick latin pronouns - tu/te/tuum , when you pick the cases that exist in english ( and ego/me/meum referring to yourself ) . 
  just to show that you 're one classy fucker . 
  ( edit : 3rd person male pronouns in latin adapted to english would be is/eum/eius , and this is what tumblrkins usually replace because it 's not gender-neutral ; but latin has no personal pronouns for 3rd person , just different sets of relative pronouns ( i.e. 
  : this , that , who ) , so i picked the most neutral ones . 
  you could also demand the diaeresis over \u00eb ( which basically means `` pronounce specifically this vowel , not how it should be according to rules of pronunciation '' ) to signify non-english pronunciation ; tu/t \u00eb / tuum , \u00ebgo / m\u00eb / m\u00ebum , is / \u00ebum / eius ), 
  or demand the majestic plural to be used ; so that you get to be referred to as they/them/their , and we/us/our when you refer to yourself . 
  3.14 would be iii \u2022 \u0404 ( = 3 +1 / 12 +1 / 24 = 3.125 ; close enough ), 
  most appropriate word here would probably be * lupa * . 
  in rome , it was only gay if you received . 
  i think it 's still like this in prisons ... 
  women are gay ( or lesbian , for that matter ) if they penetrate . 
  so , a woman using a strap-on on a man would classify as lesbian according to ancient roman logic . 
  about gay men only being gay part of the time : there is a difference between doing a gay thing and being gay . 
  if you 're raped , you do n't become gay . 
  you 're gay only if you enjoy it . 
  in that case , you would remain being gay , even if you switch between the two roles . 
  the main point in this logic is that in sex , there is a male and a female partner . 
  if a man takes the role of a female , he 's gay , and vice versa . 
  this makes it different from our modern perception of sexuality , where only what you 're attracted to matters . 
  op has to deliver anyway . 
  i wo n't be mad if my option does n't get picked . 
  i will only be mad if he pussies out and does n't troll it . 
  as long as i 'm srs and not srs , i guess it 's okay . 
  you 're welcome . 
  32 : `` women have hair '', 
  she has so little that it 's almost invisible on the pic . 
  talk about irony . 
   implying / pol / does n't hate you with passion, 
  if you are n't the op on 4chan , then someone stole your credit . 
  he 's anonymous , so no big deal though . 
  looks like you 're going to get a hurricane named after you . 
  the naval jack of slovenia uses the colours from our coat of arms instead of the traditional pan-slavic colours found on the national flag . 
  the naval ensign itself , however , is the same as the flag . 
  because of different and unique appearance of this tricolour ( which is , however , a bit similar to the bicolour of ukraine ) , i personally think that it might be a better choice for our flag than the current one .

  actually , using a scientific calculator is the same as conducting an experiment . 
  that 's why it 's called a scientific calculator - it calculates according to the scientific method ; once it 's given a problem to solve , it predicts an answer and then tests it . 
  a scientific calculator is much faster than a human at testing specific answers , this is why you think it works better and faster . 
  however , the reality is that sometimes it gets caught into a loop and can not test the answer ; this is why you sometimes get errors , even though it could predict the right answer ( or at least approximate it ) . 
  when dealing with non-number related problems , the scientific calculator is just as slow as a human , because it still has to conduct the same experiment . 
  the only exception is sociology , where it can simply run the sims to conduct the experiment ; however , sociology tends to be quite conservative in its techniques , so there is not much info how such experiments would work , but it should be able to solve many problems like the war in syria . 
  nice flair .
