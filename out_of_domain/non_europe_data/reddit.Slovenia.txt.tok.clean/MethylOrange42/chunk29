  it 's more that the song plays the bluegrass part , then metal part , then bluegrass again and then metal again , with no true intertwining between the two ( except for the thing that melody is preserved in the first metal part ) . 
  nile has two main sources ; the white nile and the blue nile . 
  blue nile flows from lake tana in ethiopia , while white nile flows from lake victoria , which lies between tanzania , uganda and kenya , near the equator . 
  white nile has constant water flow , because it accumulates water in the sudd swamps in south sudan , while blue nile is responsible for the flooding because most of its water comes from the rainy season in ethiopia during the summer . 
  anyway , ethiopia is very different from the mountains on this map , because it 's closer to the ocean . 
  this is what powers the rainy season , which is basically a monsoon , though weaker than in india or se asia . 
  the situation here is more similar to the tian shan in central asia , and most rivers flowing from there do n't reach the sea . 
  so , in conclusion , the nile is different because it has a massive drainage basin outside the desert . 
  in drawing the climates , it is important to draw how air circulation functions . 
  [ this is an idealized depiction of this on earth , and you can see how this affects the rainfall - areas with high air pressure tend to be deserts , and areas with low air pressure have higher rainfall . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/earth_global_circulation.jpg ), 
  the eastern coast would be monsoon-y , just like with asia , and not at all arid . 
  the only exception to this rule of eastern coasts being more wet on earth is somalia , which is dry because of cold current ( another big factor ; warm current from the gulf of mexico is also the main reason why scandinavia and great britain are much warmer than east canada ) , but judging from the shape of continents here it should n't be so . 
  west coast should be opposite - think of sahara , kalahari , atacama , southern california etc. 
  that is , unless your planet rotates in opposite direction , so that the sun rises in the west and sets in the east . 
  this flips the directions of global air circulation . 
  then , the desert is placed correctly . 
  further north , the main source of rainfall are cyclones and cold fronts . 
  the latter travel west-to-east ( or east-to-west if rotation is reversed ) , and since they get water from oceans , west coasts should be wetter than east coasts . 
  think of temperate rain forests of cascadia or wet english weather . 
  but , since mountains get most rainfall , because the air needs to rise , cool , and release moisture , the area right behind the mountains receives much less rain . 
  so , you may expect to find deserts right behind large mountain ranges . 
  examples would be tibet behind himalaya ( which completely stops the monsoon ) , and the area east of the rocky mountains . 
  next to the equator , it is just hot , wet and rainy all year , with the exception of highlands that are a bit less humid . 
  itt : people who think that anything round that rolls is a wheel . 
  wait , what part of it is nsfw ? 
  ( goes check ), 
  honestly , if this is nsfw for you , where the fuck do you live ? 
  saudi arabia ? 
  so , this is nsfw , when greentext that are actually sexual in nature that do n't have a pic subtly showing some skin are sfw ? 
  i 'm quite sure you 'd get into more trouble reading text about how [ some guy got blown by his girlfriend at the movies ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/1lmeds/anons_awkward_sexual_encounter_at_the_movies/ ) than this . 
  i mean , by this logic documentaries about african tribes are nsfw . 
  yeah . 
  it seems that if something is discovered in slovenia , it is not a valid archaeological discovery . 
  that 's because even male and female combined were still in minority . 
  there are four things wrong i spot :, 
  * amount of makeup , combined with, 
  * forced smiles and unnaturally white teeth, 
  * overly high heels that make legs look freakishly long from this angle, 
  * face of the right-center one, 
  / shr/ek is drek, 
  i think the reason is that the exact appearance is not standardized ; instead it is just specified what the seal depicts . 
  it 's similar in heraldry ; coats of arms are not drawn in specification , instead , they 're described using the blazon . 
  nowadays it seems more useful to just have a standard appearance of the flag , because we can draw and design it using computers and just distribute the standard . 
  in the past , it was not so ; it was much better to describe it using words . 
  also , flags used to be hand-made , so variance was tolerated , as long as it was done by specification . 
  segregation was n't required where there were n't so many black people around . 
  well , even our slovenian newspapers sometimes make that mistake ... 
  yesterday , we were playing eurobasket match against the czech , and [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3wpaxng.jpg ) happened . 
  nah , i 'd just say that modern western society promotes sociopathy . 
  our relations with other people are less and less personal . 
  we deal with people everyday that we might never see again . 
  our neighbours are n't people we might do stuff together , they 're just people we see everyday that happen to live nearby . 
  being really close friends is rare . 
  so , in general , we actually live in a world where sociopaths are in huge advantage . 
  [ why do all the empires get nazi-looking flags ?

  i 'd say she does n't need a lifejacket .

  i remember when i was ketoing ; my family somehow understood that veggies are ok for the diet and they made me beans the first day . 
  well , thank you for being supportive in a way that actually fucks it up .

  [ you gave me the feel ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/iecvp.jpg ), 
  we make white ( - ish ) honey in slovenia ; it 's called cream honey and it completely natural , crystallized while mixing , this causes microscopic crystals to form that give it distinct white colour . 
  where are you from actually ? 
  because if you knew how the situation with the romani actually is like , you would n't write that . 
  in slovenia , there are quite some illegally `` gypsy '' settlements , which are basically made from scrap and 100 % illegally constructed . 
  some are without water and electricity , while others actually have illegal connection and do n't pay for it at all . 
  they receive massive social support , mostly for being lazy and not working and for having multiple children . 
  and they are basically untouched by law , no matter what they do , because that would be discriminatory as they are a discriminated minority . 
  so i 'd say that they do n't actually have to live there , because it 's actually illegal , but they do n't want to move anywhere else ( which is a big problem ) . 
  if you want to know more about the dirt of the romani population , read some articles about the strojan family . 
  they were quite big in the slovenian media a few years ago . 
  i think it 's fine the way it is . 
  if you do n't like the month 's theme , you do n't have to compete . 
  and if it 's hard for you , it 's most likely hard for everyone . 
  bread is really shitty if you look at it that way ; almost pure calorie from the starch and no nutritional value . 
  it 's just filler food when you do n't have anything better to eat . 
  so , you 've been basically studying propaganda . 
  that is true . 
  i especially like buckwheat bread . 
  also , it 's delicious with butter and walnuts . 
  i 'm just wondering how to hint your girlfriend not to shave . 
  theoretically , because i 'm currently being visited by the feel of [  tfwnogf ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ndxzs.jpg ) . 
  well , honestly , it looks like most of those `` people on the bus '' are friends of the woman here , and they 're just as drunk . 
  at least someone with little common sense and dignity turns up at the end . 
  though , if the situation was reversed , there would most likely be major public outrage and feminist marches protesting against the paedophillic patriarchy . 
  ... so simple a child could draw it ? 
  check . 
  well , to me this sounds a few sizes too big to play with ... 
  but i guess i would n't date you in first place anyway . 
  i like the top left one in the last pic . 
  even though it 's actually terrible . 
  nah , i 'm just sharing my opinion . 
  same goes for everyone else answering to your comment ... 
  i was homosexual until the age of 12 , but am straight now ...
