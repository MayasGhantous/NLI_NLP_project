  the shias also run countries such as iran and libya . 
  taliban is also a shia-based islamic group . 
  alright . 
  the shia muslims and the sunnis are mortal fucking enemies . 
  and by that , i do n't mean like the fucking conservatives and liberals . 
  i mean , they 'll fucking kill eachother . 
  so , amerifags . . about 30 % of muslims believe that you should die . 
  the remaining 70 % are just like you and me . 
  now discuss , you dumbfucks . 
  evolution . 
  ever heard of them ? 
  i 'm not saying they make sense , but they do n't have to . 
  they simply are . 
  just as having facial hair does n't really make sense if you shave it . 
  newfag detected ... ? 
  what the fuck did you just fucking say about me , you little bitch ? 
  i 'll have you know i graduated top of my class in the navy seals , and i 've been involved in numerous secret raids on al-quaeda , and i have over 300 confirmed kills . 
  i am trained in guerrilla warfare and i 'm the top sniper in the entire us armed forces . 
  you are nothing to me but just another target . 
  i will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth , mark my fucking words . 
  you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the internet ? 
  think again , fucker . 
  as we speak i am contacting my secret network of spies across the usa and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm , maggot . 
  the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life . 
  you 're fucking dead , kid . 
  i can be anywhere , anytime , and i can kill you in over seven hundred ways , and that 's just with my bare hands . 
  not only am i extensively trained in unarmed combat , but i have access to the entire arsenal of the united states marine corps and i will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent , you little shit . 
  if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little `` clever '' comment was about to bring down upon you , maybe you would have held your fucking tongue . 
  but you could n't , you did n't , and now you 're paying the price , you goddamn idiot .

  i never used deodorant , because i never liked the way they smell . 
  it always seemed like nobody ever noticed , but i was worried they were just too polite to tell me i smell bad . 
  now i feel much more comfortable with how i smell , 
  okay , thanks for comment ... 
  i do shower regularly , so i do n't think personal hygiene should be a problem here ... and i know when i actually smell bad ( when i go camping , for example ) .

  [ here 's an explanation of this trick ( by minutephysics ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lr4tjr7smpm ), 
  yes , but he was n't told his about his heritage until 2951 ta . 
  he was named estel at that point . 
  `` then aragorn , being now the heir of isildur , was taken with his mother to dwell in the house of elrond ; and elrond took the place of his father and came to love him as a son of his own . 
  but he was called estel , that is `` hope '' , and his true name and lineage were kept secret at the bidding of elrond ; for the wise then knew that the enemy was seeking to discover the heir of isildur , if any remained upon earth . '', 
  from the appendices ; this paragraph is from the appendix a , under the n\u00famenorean kings  the tale of aragorn and arwen . 
  the appendices should be printed at the end of return of the king .

  ok ... let me make a confession ... 
  i like dragonforce , but find hammerfall cheesy and boring . 
  what is wrong with me . 
  why did they go to tatooine anyway ? 
  naboo is in mid rim , coruscant in the core , while tatooine is in outer rim on the ~ ~ ** opposite ** ~ ~ ( actually same ) side of the galaxy . 
  ( but going opposite way from naboo ), 
  i checked the maps , so , yeah , you 're right . 
  for some reason i memorized that it 's on the opposite side , somewhere around yavin 's location . 
  perhaps i should check before posting .
