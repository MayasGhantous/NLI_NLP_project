  he looks around 12 , if you ask me . 
  they mean lithuania . 
  ... congratulations , you 're officially a pervert . 
  * i prefer no makeup for everyday look . 
  it does n't work well with all women , i admit , but still . 
  and do n't say that i do n't recognize the difference between no makeup and natural makeup , because i do - i mean , guys do n't wear makeup ( mostly ) , so it 's not like i do n't how natural skin looks like . 
  for special occasions , makeup is completely appropriate . 
  also , if makeup is applied in a special way ( artistic ? 
  ) , it can come out very good and looks nice . 
  yet i am more attracted to women that do n't wear any - good makeup is like good painting to me , it looks nice but does n't attract me sexually . 
  * lipstick and mascara are fairly obvious . 
  also , i notice makeup that is applied to improve skin tone - because it does n't look like skin most of the time . 
  it 's either too shiny , too matte , or just unnatural in colour . 
  or all of the above . 
  * i like none for every day and subtle for special occasions . 
  * anything involving nails ( even transparent nail polish ) , blush , foundation ( except maybe for covering blemishes for special occasions ) , eyeshadow , anything involving eyebrows ( i like natural eyebrows ), 
  in general , i do n't think makeup is a good way to improve or enhance natural beauty . 
  instead , i appreciate makeup that actually intends to be aesthetically pleasing in a non-natural way . 
  makeup for me in general tends to cause the uncanny valley effect . 
  and those that do n't look good with makeup usually look terrible without , those that do look good tend to look even better without to me . 
  yeah . 
  it 's like indie rock is not a legit genre any more , just a contain-it-all label for everything hipsters listen to . 
  same goes for pop , which includes everything from r&b to pop rock nowadays - it 's a contain-it-all label for anything simple that is marketed to general audience . 
  / r/thrive, 
  it 'd be great if this actually gets completed ... 
  itt : people who think that if you play a metal song on an instrument other than guitar , it immediately does n't sound metal . 
  ( apocalyptica etc. ), 
  there is more to metal than just the fact that you play it on guitars with distortion . 
  metal has a distinct rhythm and beat ( and this is what makes it different from hard rock and punk ) , and if you just take another instrument and do n't change anything else , it 'll still sound distinctly metal . 
  just like playing bach on a saxophone still sounds more like bach than like jazz . 
  edit : example of this done right : [ darkthrone 's transilvanian hunger in surf rock style ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc3qnacbsbg ) . 
  there are also some other good remakes of classic black metal songs in surf rock style , but i like this one the most . 
  i 'd love to see what happens if a thin girl posts there complaining about how she being thin means that she has small boobs and that other girls constantly tease her that she should eat more or that guys do n't like bones . 
  so much about acceptance . 
  fine . 
  [ one by metallica played on piano . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2wur8447za ) still sounds distinctly metal to me in the end . 
  [ transilvanian hunger by darkthrone played in surf rock style . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc3qnacbsbg ), 
  so , why is dain called ironfoot ? 
  does tolkien ever give an explanation ? 
  edit : same for his son , thorin stonehelm . 
  the thread is about metal songs redone to sound nothing like metal at all . 
  not about covers that sound the same as original . 
  so , the reason why i do listen to covers like that is exactly why you do n't listen to covers like that . 
  i 'd disagree with your remark on metallica covers ; you can always just take out the main riffs and melodies and play it in completely different style . 
  just check various variations on a theme by classical composers , where a same theme is first played in a simple form , and then in various different styles . 
  you can make it sound completely different , while it still remains the same song . 
  [ example by mozart ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fggwtz_v6xm ) . 
  some sound more like the simple original theme , some less , but most of them retain their essence . 
  edit : another good example : [ the imperial march from star wars in style of beethoven . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ishini7ugpe ), 
  the same as with equilibrium 's acoustic stuff would also go with fejd . 
  they play viking folk metal on traditional scandinavian instruments , so it 's fully acoustic ( with exception of the bass guitar ) , yet it still sounds more like metal than traditional folk music . 
  because it 's metal in structure and the beat . 
  hopefully . 
  i 'd love to start an acoustic avantgarde/symphonic metal band with piano , cello , clarinet , and flute ... but it 's hard to find metalheads that are willing to play instruments other than guitar/bass/drums or non-metalheads willing to play metal . 
  [ it 's already been done . 
  ] ( http://davidwriteswords.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/grammar-nazi.jpg ), 
  the [ old flag of ethiopia ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/ethiopian_pennants.svg/450px-ethiopian_pennants.svg.png ) was made of three coloured penants the same colours as the current tricolour . 
  the current flags have evolved from maritime flags used during the age of sail . 
  before that there was no standard shape of the banners ; some were not even flags ( [ example being the mongolian white banners ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/white_sulde_of_the_mongol_empire.jpg ) ) . 
  national flags started to be used during the rise of nationalism in the 19th century , and that 's when the current rectangular shape became the norm , because rectangular flags are easiest to make . 
  banners and pennant often symbolized the old royal powers and military much more than the people . 
  but naval flags were also used by merchant ships . 
  this is why people more easily took the naval flags as their own . 
  about the shape , apart from the fact that rectangular flag is easiest to make , i do n't know . 
  lose weight fatty . 
  i do n't give a shit , so my estimate would be zero . 
  [ they used another , even nicer design ( imho ) in between , based on the medieval coat of arms . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/coat_of_arms_of_bosnia_and_herzegovina_%281992-1998%29.svg/521px-coat_of_arms_of_bosnia_and_herzegovina_%281992-1998%29.svg.png ) it was replaced in 1998 , though , as it was considered too bosnian for serbs to accept as the coa of the federation . 
  ** flag of minimalism **, 
  the point of minimalism is `` to expose the essence or identity of a subject through eliminating all non-essential forms , features or concepts '' - that is , to make simplest and fewest design possible to create maximum effect . 
  to make a minimalist flag , i decided to take a generic tricolour - the most recognisable flag design , and strip it of all the colours , to make the most basic `` tricolour '' ( if we can call it so ) possible . 
  ** flag of altamira **, 
  the cave of altamira is a cave in northern spain that is famous for its late paleolithic cave paintings . 
  for this design i took the iconic bison painting , vectorized it , and put it on a flag ( with colours chosen that are close to the original cave paintings ) . 
  most / fa / weight for 6 ' 1 '' ( which is kinda short to be honest ) would be around 135 . 
  i 'm 160 6 ' 1 '' , and this is acceptable for entry level / fa / . 
  anything more means that you 're building fat pads , which is apparently your problem . 
  i prefer the `` wheel '' one . 
  putting a second coloured grid at 45 \u00b0 angle over the first one make the flag look a bit too busy in my opinion . 
  there 's already a lot going on there with all those colours . 
  ... do you go to 4chan 's / pol / board ? 
  'cause i 've seen this exact comic posted on first post of one thread today . 
   \\   / fit /, 
  croatian and vietnamese use \u0111 , which has identical uppercase shape ... 
  the only difference is that \u0111 is constructed by crossing the bar of a regular d , while \u00f0 crosses the bar of an insular d ( \ua77a ) . 
  that 'd be called plica polonica . 
  google it . 
  this looks great !, 
  very much effort put into this , i like that . 
  there is another subreddit that would surely enjoy this ; along with the backstory : / r/worldbuilding, 
  well , i guess ... this one is indeed true to the origin of ragecomics on 4chan 's / b / . 
  it 's most likely * slovo * ( word ) , because this marks the constrast between * slov\u011bni * ( slavs ) , those who speak in words , and * n\u011bmci * ( germans ) , those who mumble ( * n\u011bm\u044a * is an adjective meaning mute , mumbling ) . 
  marriage , though , is patriarchal oppression . 
  taking husband 's surname is anyway just a historical remnant from the time when there was actual patriarchy - the oldest male was the boss of the family , and women married into families . 
  talking about surnames and parental lines , i think it would be most fair if boys take father 's surname , while girls take mother 's surname . 
  this would also be biologically correct , as boys inherit and pass on father 's y chromosome , while girls pass on mother 's mitochondrial dna . 
  i 'm australian and there is no arrow pointing the right way :(,
