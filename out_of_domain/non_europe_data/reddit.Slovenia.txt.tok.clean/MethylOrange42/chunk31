  [ woah , dude . 
  [ repost ... ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/1m2qp4/flag_of_the_bangsamoro_republik_a_de_facto/ ), 
  do n't worry . 
  it 's a good idea to do a search by keyword before posting next time though . 
  einstein was right , but you are misunderstanding the concept . 
  you have less energy because more of your energy is transformed into mass . 
  mass is essentially bound energy , and as such can not be used . 
  if you 're thinner , you have more energy because less of it is bound . 
  you also have a limited amount of mass + energy at any given time . 
  this is in a way similar to how you can not travel faster than the speed of light , and faster you go , the slower time goes . 
  if you lose all your mass , it is all released as energy . 
  but this is not so important . 
  more important is , in classical physics , you can build mass indefinitely , just like velocity can be increased indefinitely ( even over the speed of light ) . 
  we know that this is wrong ( newton , you suck !, 
  ) , because einstein enlightened us with his intelligence . 
  anyway , if you increase mass , there is a critical mass , where it can no longer be increased , as you lost all energy . 
  stephen hawking 's complex calculations ( which i will not write here as it would take me several weeks ) tell us that at that point your mass is so massive that your body becomes a black hole . 
  this also confirms that the concept of potential energy is real ( the higher you are , the higher your potential energy is - this also applies to higher levels of consciousness , also known as the [ 10 ] ness of sagan ) , since black holes are at the absolute bottom of potential energy diagrams . 
  in serbian , the act of fellatio is called * pu\u0161iti kurac * , which literally means `` to smoke a cock '' , so yes , it has been tried , and confirmed before , that she will , indeed , do . 
  yeah , i thought of this too , but was n't that satisfied with the result . 
  the white fields work better than white-black-white because they 're actually perceived as blank ( devoid of colour ) , but i have to separate them somehow . 
  also , those lines between three fields are a nod to mondrian 's compositions ( [ composition \u2116 10 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9c/mondrian_comp10.jpg ) , for example ) , which gives it some extra underlying meaning . 
  do n't forget john haughm of agalloch ... 
  meanwhile , stille volk ( medieval folk music ) and nest ( neofolk/ambient ) are admitted . 
  apparently they pass as metal because someone likes them . 
  funny , wikipedia already lists [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/flag_of_york.svg/1000px-flag_of_york.svg.png ) as a flag . 
  edit : read the blog :, 
   ... the city of york council has a coat of arms this may only be used by the council . 
  so , apparently , it kind of makes sense . 
  ... this is actually the equivalent of a boob grab . 
  edit : accidentally a word, 
  i do n't like straightened hair because i see it as a way of conforming to societal standards , so naturally wavy/curly hair somehow adds something to the character in my eyes . 
  also , straightened hair usually does n't look like naturally straight hair . 
  i also found a city named fedora ( in lavallana ) . 
  you forgot the one that complains about the patriarchal oppression of the verb `` to screw '' . 
  why do they have a hobbit on the flag ? 
  croatia has a new snail species , zoologist found intermediate transparency of its shell . 
  checked the pics . 
  no offence , but your face ... you look like a man in the face . 
  and you ca n't hide this with makeup - you 'd end up looking like a tranny . 
  it 's in the bone structure . 
  edit : this combined with your chest ... are you sure you 're a girl ? 
  edit2 : yes , downvotes for honesty !, 
  i also like how it went from ( 6 | 2 ) to ( 7 | 9 ) , as if someone is trying to silence me . 
  but come on , tastes differ , so why am i not entitled to give comment - on a subreddit whose purpose is to get opinion ? 
  one of the rules here , after all , is `` do not downvote to indicate disagreement . '', 
  also , `` do not post here looking for positive affirmation on your appearance . 
  other subreddits are explicitly designed for this purpose . '', 
   the flag of tampa combines elements of the stars and stripes , the flag of spain , the british union flag , the flag of italy , and the french tricolor , as all of these countries had a hand in development of what eventually became the city of tampa and/or the state of florida . 
   the prominent use of red and gold symbolizes spain 's role in the development of tampa , from the first european exploration of the tampa bay area in 1528 to the later influx of spanish and cuban immigrants . 
  many italians came to tampa at the same time , inspiring a field of green from the colors of the italian flag . 
   the `` h '' symbolizes hillsborough county . 
   the official seal of the city of tampa , superimposed on a blue `` t '' , symbolizes the incorporation of tampa in 1855 . 
  so , just as with the [ flag of pensacola ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/flag_of_pensacola.svg/1000px-flag_of_pensacola.svg.png ) , this flag is a clusterfuck of everything . 
   amazing tits, 
  yes , because we live in a bizarre society where quality of tits is measured by how many pounds they weigh , so landwhales automatically have best tits available . 
  this is just ridiculous . 
  hate to break it to you , but not everyone shares your fetish . 
  you 'd probably be just as weirded out if someone started forcing his feet fetish on you . 
  19 , ever since restarting with / r/nofap last year it 's never been more than once a week ( even though i do n't have sex at all currently ) . 
  it 's a good support group ( even though it can get quite circlejerky ) , and i recommend you to go there , subscribe , and start a challenge . 
  nope , but, 
   if you 've never fucked a girl with f + tits you 're missing out . 
  this is . 
  to me , it seems like poland is plotting world domination plans , once everyone else is abducted . 
  they come in different colours exactly because they 're colour-blind . 
  if they were racist , the most superior breed ( / r/supershibe ) would enslave and dominate breeds of other colours using their dogeist ideology . 
  communism is an international movement , while fascism is nationalist . 
  while , in their core , they both originated as movement by intellectuals and workers to improve society through interventionism ( which is a recipe for disaster ) , and make life easier for everyone because the state/society provides everything you need . 
  but , main difference is that communism is global and teaches of equal opportunities . 
  that 's what makes subcultures and minorities much more comfortable with communism than fascism , and that 's exactly why hipsters , being an intellectualist subculture , find communism so attractive - especially because of the idea that in a perfect society you 're safe and can do whatever you want that makes you happy ( which is unattainable in real world ) , exactly what they desire to do . 
  yes , but ... 
  communism aims to drag everyone back to the level at which wealth is uniformly distributed . 
  that 's where everyone has equal opportunities : because nobody is privileged , you can do whatever you want , and contribute to society , while getting your equal share . 
  think of a big family with just one bank account , and everything is shared equally . 
  if a society is poor ( because people do bad decisions or simply because the economy is unable to sustain all the population ) , this means everyone suffers , but if a society is rich , everyone gets a lot of bonuses ( think of norway for example ) . 
  fascism is state-based . 
  that 's what makes it nationalistic in its core - the state , for its existence , needs to defend against foreigners . 
  this does not automatically mean outright hatred for other nations though . 
  the problem with communism is that hard work is not directly rewarded , so lazing off actually pays out more for an individual than hard work ( it 's like the prisoner 's dilemma in a way ) . 
  the problem with fascism is that you 'll always have subcultures , which are a problem because this dismantles the idea of homogeneous society required . 
  the problem with both is that they can very easily be abused by political elites . 
  i believe it 's a word for a korean woman after her plastic surgery . 
  ... no offense , but is n't is so that lack of orientation is not an orientation , just like lack of religion ( atheism ) is not a religion ... ? 
  ... as a physicist , i feel the need to complain to your remark . 
  you ca n't just invent some scale and claim that it 's naturally numbered . 
  it needs to be countable or objectively measurable for that . 
  the numbers in such scale are just placeholders for names of different categories , ordered . 
  also , the original kinsey scale already includes asexuality , marked as `` x '' . 
  yes , and that 's what makes them illegal . 
  nigger goes in all fields, 
  i have a proposal : let 's make two categories of clusterfuck flags , so we can refer to them using simple names . 
  the first category is pensacola-type . 
  it means that you make a flag out of smaller flags . 
  compare [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/four_provinces_flag.svg/1320px-four_provinces_flag.svg.png ) with the [ flag of pensacola ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/flag_of_pensacola.svg/913px-flag_of_pensacola.svg.png ) . 
  the second category is tampa-type . 
  it means that you take just visual elements from as many flags as possible and put them together . 
  compare [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/all_ireland_province_emblems_flag.svg/1000px-all_ireland_province_emblems_flag.svg.png ) with the [ flag of tampa ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/flag_of_tampa%2c_florida.svg/956px-flag_of_tampa%2c_florida.svg.png ) . 
  yeah , i also know of the [ stowe armorial coat of arms ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/stowe_armorial.jpg ) , with 719 quarterings , which is kind of pushing this to the extreme . 
  it depends on how it is done .
