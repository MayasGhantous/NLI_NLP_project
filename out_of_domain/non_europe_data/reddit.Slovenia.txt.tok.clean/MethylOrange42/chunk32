  also , i think this does have a place in the heraldic tradition , while it is not good for flags - because flags are intended to be easily recognizable , while arms are supposed to tell the history of a family . 
  not to mention that the [ flag of maryland ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/flag_of_maryland.svg/750px-flag_of_maryland.svg.png ) does n't look bad at all . 
  this is essentially a [ monofin ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/junko-kitahama_apnea-monofin_cropped.jpg ) . 
  so , are you dovah-kin then ? 
  ( sorry , had to make this joke ), 
  wow !, 
  thank you for the support !, 
  it was a hard theme , since it was hard to decide what to design ( the topic was so broad ) , but when i was looking through the cave paintings , i just knew i have to make a flag out of this painting . 
  and congratulations for everyone else who participated , especially considering such close outcome . 
  my country is mentioned , yay !, 
  slovenia can into relevance !, 
  i used inkscape 's trace bitmap tool , but this does n't automatically return favourable results . 
  i had to play with the parametres , delete two layers ( because if i put in smaller number , colours did n't come out as i wanted ) , remove some speckles , and smoothen out some shapes . 
  but it would be much much harder and time consuming doing everything from a scratch . 
  i was actually thinking of making a mondriaan flag at first , but then changed my mind . 
  yeah , i 'm kind of surprised that this did n't go to the tie breaker round too ... 
  summerfags left , only autists remain on 4chan, 
  in slovenia , a 2 month old party got most votes ( 28,5 % ) , could n't make a coalition , then demolished the other coalition using protests in one year , and now leads the government . 
  terribly . 
  everything can happen . 
  actually a coat of arms ; / r/heraldry . 
  sweden does use heraldic flags for its provinces , so [ this would be the flag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/..%c3%96sterg%c3%b6tland_flag%28sweden%29.png ) . 
  there is also [ an unofficial flag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/flag_of_ostergotland.svg/1600px-flag_of_ostergotland.svg.png ) , which is basically reversed swedish flag . 
  i have friends that are 20 and still playing angry birds . 
  came here to ask if they played bamboleo . 
   crewmen load a `` hedgehog '' anti-submarine mortar , while on duty in inchon harbor , south korea . 
  oh the joys of having an obscure name that is untainted by the furfaggotry . 
  think of \u306e ( no ) as a possessive suffix , similar to how - 's works in english . 
  v\u00f5ros people 's flag . 
  also , \u00f5 is used in estonian to denote the close-mid back unrounded vowel ( o as in `` bought '' , but without lip rounding ) , so it would be closest to the japanese u ( which is close back unrounded vowel ) , not long/double o. 
  [ ( pronunciation of \u00f5 ) ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/close-mid_back_unrounded_vowel.ogg ), 
  ( unless \u30d6\u30ed\u30b9 already has a meaning , that i 'm unaware of ), 
  what is the backstory ? 
  because they 're willing to pay big money . 
  simple as that .

  really ? 
  in this moment , i am ( \u0361\u00ba \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00ba ) . 
  not because of any phony ( \u0361\u00ba \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00ba ) 's blessing . 
  but because , i am enlightened by my own ( \u0361\u00ba \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00ba ) . 
  hint : fructose makes you fat because your liver automatically burns it into fat . 
  eating lots of fruit before going to sleep is the easiest way to gain weight . 
  on contrary , you can never eat so much fat that you get fat . 
  your bowels ca n't handle that much fat , and you 'd feel sick . 
  just some statistics and fun facts : nauru is an island-state in pacific , which has highest obesity rate in the world . 
  94.5 % are overweight and 71.7 % are obese . 
  average body weight is over 100kg ( 220lbs ) , and average bmi is close to 35 . 
  also , more than one third of nauruans are diabetic . 
  in order to become strong , one should not suppress his inner daemons , but confront , fight and understand them . 
  the same goes with triggers . 
  removing the triggers may be helpful on short term , but it 's much better to actively fight the temptation . 
  if you ca n't do that , the no-fap ca n't help you , because you 'll revert sooner or later . 
  true strength comes from understanding the evil . 
  the problem is that ethnic registration is actually illegal in sweden ( as the article linked says ) . 
  i find this quite ridiculous honestly . 
  whoa . 
  because of the nazis , 70 + years ago ? 
  i did n't expect that ... 
  i think it 's important for the police to have the ethnic background noted . 
  it kind of makes investigations easier , because people tend to stay inside their ethnic groups - if they 're a minority group , they 'll quite likely have friends from the same group . 
  eliminating this piece of information just for the sake of political correctness does n't really make sense . 
  but , if they have an evidence on who is romani , so they should for all minorities : s\u00e1mi , finns , and assimilated immigrants ( people from former yugoslavia are quite a sizable minority in sweden ) . 
  the cache - you can change how much you metabolize . 
  some foods make you feel tired , while some make you feel full of energy . 
  this is the trick of keto diet ; you do n't get tired , and the body stays on high metabolism , where it can burn fat . 
   mfw it 's actually true,

  [ winner of that one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ca4ay.png ), 
  username relevant . 
  that 's what most people think . 
  because it 's easier to think that way , not having to see the big picture . 
  the second one looks best in my opinion . 
  i disagree . 
  call me a failure of a man , if you want , but i specifically do n't even want to have casual sex . 
  i do n't even want to flirt too much , because i 'm afraid that a woman may want to have sex with me . 
  while it is true that men like what you describe exist , i 'm not one of them , and i 'm certainly not the only one . 
  and while i want sex , i want to have sex in a stable long-term relationship and this is all i 'm asking for . 
  reddit as a whole still despises teenage girls for friendzoning them when they were teenagers . 
  unless they 're scientific celebrities . 
  or gay celebrities . 
  or atheists . 
  or all of the above . 
  a heraldic flag , based on [ the coat of arms ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/coat_of_arms_of_saint_helena.svg/724px-coat_of_arms_of_saint_helena.svg.png ) , inspired by the [ flag of new brunswick ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/flag_of_new_brunswick.svg/960px-flag_of_new_brunswick.svg.png ) . 
  i 've also removed the st. george 's cross from the flag on the ship . 
  i know this is / r/askwomen , but let me , as a guy , share my opinion . 
  you do n't have to do it at all . 
  i 'd say most men would agree that stubble looks the worse , and if you do n't do actual hair removal but just shaving , you have to do it really often to avoid the stubble . 
  also , i guess it would itch a lot when it 's growing back - which you probably do n't want either . 
  i know shaved bare is currently `` in '' , but it 's kind of ridiculous . 
  as long as it 's trimmed and tidy , it should be ok . 
  i 'd say this was n't originally intended as an experiment . 
  he was more likely just trying to save his ass . 
  from wikipedia :, 
   the terms union jack , union flag , british flag are all historically correct for describing the de facto national flag of the united kingdom . 
  whether to call it the `` union jack '' or the `` union flag '' is a matter of debate by many . 
  according to the flag institute , the vexillological organisation for the united kingdom , `` the national flag of the united kingdom , the crown dependencies and overseas territories is the union flag , which may also be called the union jack . '', 
  the ship is surrendering because i do n't know what else to put in the flag . 
  unless i just completely remove it .
