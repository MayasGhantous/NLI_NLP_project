  the dc one is actually a heraldic flag of coat of arms of george washington . 
  so it follows the rules and looks like a flag because it 's actually traditional . 
  edit : [ here ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/washington_coat_of_arms.jpg ) is the coat of arms depicted in selby abbey to commemorate john wessington , prior of durham , from early 15th century . 
   ella-li spik of jokkmokk , sweden, 
  stop using oppressing euro-centric placenames , you shitlord !, 
  it 's d\u00e1lvvadis !, 
  how dare you deprecate they glorious nature-loving untainted culture with your filthy indo-european language !, 
  great , i 've made one just six days ago . 
  should n't be too hard to continue the work , 
  edit : reminder that we already had [ a contest specifically for fiji ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/16bzyb/january_2013_flag_design_contest_voting_thread/ ) ; [ winner of that contest ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dscdz.png ) . 
  if you live in celibate , you 're oppressing yourself . 
  did n't you know this ? 
  it 's oppressive to oppress your sexuality . 
  it 's called `` consensual sex in the missionary position for the sole purpose of procreation '' . 
  do n't mislabel it you shitlord . 
   a trans woman, 
  so , he 's actually a guy , which literally makes him a creepy guy that only dates women . 
  projection at its finest . 
  keto is in general more nutrient/vitamin rich than staples-based diet , you should eat enough fat so this should n't be a problem , and using glucose from liver does n't hurt you because , duh , liver is n't made of glucose . 
   in order to produce healthier humans and advance humanity . 
  yeah , sure . 
  with neolithic revolution , average human height went down from 5 ' 10 '' for men and 5 ' 6 '' for women to 5 ' 3 '' and 5 ' 1 '' . 
  ^ ( ( shermer , michael ( 2001 ) ^ ( the borderlands of science , oxford university press p. 250 , found on wikipedia as source ) ^ ) life expectancy also went down , if i recall correctly , but ca n't find the source . 
  but , before the neolithic , those that survived the childhood could live well into the fifties and sixties , when farmers died in their thirties and fourties . 
  i do n't keto currently though , but did last march . 
  it is kind of extreme , sure , but i did n't feel bad ( actually i was full of energy ) , and i lost most of the body fat that i accumulated the year before . 
  i would n't recommend to do it continuously , though , just as fasting every once in a while . 
  i created a communist-looking version of us flag a few days ago too . 
  i was thinking maybe of changing the shield and the motto . 
  maybe make the eagle hold the hammer and sickle instead . 
  but i like the striped appearance ; makes it look distinctly american . 
  welcome to the club . 
   i do n't think humans have ever lived past 40 up until about 2000 years ago with the advent of medicine and trade . 
  nope . 
  skeletal remains suggests that osteoporosis was present in some women back then , which would mean they lived past the menopause . 
  also , the fact that menopause exists would n't make sense if we did n't actually evolve to live that long - it 's when birth defect rate goes so high that it 's evolutionary better to help raise grandchildren than to keep producing your own offspring . 
   but you are totally right , humans shrank during that time ... because we became homosapien sapient and no longer needed to spend all our energy on moving from place to place or enduring bitter cold . 
  we did take sedentary lifestyle only after the neolithic revolution . 
  but this happened in the middle east , which is not a place of extreme cold - and it was n't during the ice age either . 
  the reason for settling down was that the climate got drier , so the land was no longer suitable for hunting for food ( sahara and arabia were savannas during the ice age ) . 
   yes , literally , us settling down and abandoning a paleolithic diet changed our evolution to focus on being more hairless and higher brain function - at a cost of being a bit shorter and having crooked teeth . 
  hairless ? 
  higher brain function ? 
  even those peoples that did n't go through the neolithic revolution at all are just as hairy as modern human ( aborigines in australia , bushmen in africa ) . 
  also , cromagnons had slightly larger brain volume than modern europeans . 
  brain volume is not a direct evidence of higher brain function , but it could show that paleolithic diet was more nutritious in fact . 
   average life expectancy in women declined due to a rapid rise in child birthing . 
  it 's also suggested society became very heavily male dominated due to women who were now house-bound with child bearing/rearing . 
  this is true . 
  birth rates in pre-neolithic societies are lower , because there is no suitable food for toddlers if you take out agricultural produce . 
  this means that they need to continue to be breastfeed , at least partially , until the age of 3 or 4 . 
  another reason for development of patriarchal societies is the fact that with sedentary lifestyle , you have to actively defend the territory ; you ca n't just move somewhere else if a stronger tribe appears nearby . 
  this creates need for warriors , which are , for obvious reasons , male . 
  on other hand , strong warriors can also raid other villages . 
  this gives men extra value ; and since survival of the community depends on bands of warriors , those bands of warriors achieve dominant status in the society . 
  yeah . 
  i worked with the emblem of east germany , so i had to keep the banners three-striped . 
  perhaps i could increase the number of stripes , but this is not final version yet . 
  slovenian allows such stacking , but most modal verbs have equivalents in slovene that are not verbs , but adverbs . 
  but , if i translated those sentences with double modals to slovenian ( preserving the order of the modals ) , the meaning would mostly come over the same as in / u/thegreenaaron 's examples : either to avoid committing yourself to an obligation without being rude , or to indirectly give advice . 
  well , the [ naval ensign of latvia ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/naval_ensign_of_latvia.svg/800px-naval_ensign_of_latvia.svg.png ) is almost nordic . 
  [ it 's better to be a shitty artist than a shitty reposter , though . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/19mpuc/why_anon_hates_artists/ ), 
  childbirth is kinda traumatic , though . 
  before modern medicine , maternal death rate was around 1 % , and it still is in some third world countries . 
  the reason is , walking upright requires narrow pelvis , built for supporting the body , while childbirth requires wide pelvic opening . 
  of course , evolution makes sure that the baby should have enough space to get born , but just barely . 
  actually , compared to animals , human babies are born prematurely , to further decrease chance of complications . 
  however , 1 % is statistically insignificant ( cutoff in statistics is usually 2 standard deviations , which is extreme 2 % on both sides of the bell curve ) , so evolution does n't even try to fix those cases . 
  i 'd say this is actually a case of projection . 
  he loathes the fact that he is not getting any attention , and the fact that guys wanted to touch his balloon boobs remind him of that . 
  of course , being proudly virgin , he turns it around by saying that it is disgusting , and that he 's proud that girls ( or guys ? 
  does n't really matter ) do n't invade him . 
   like metal music, 
   slipknot, 
  gtfo . 
  i dare you to tell this story to a metalhead . 
  there are some names that should be grouped that are not - the names that are equivalents of john ( ioannes in greek , yohanan in hebrew ) . 
  those are : jo\u00e3o ( portugal ) , jan ( czech ) , jonas ( lithuania - unrelated to the nordic jonas , which is related to jonah ) , juhani ( finland ) and j\u00f3n ( iceland ) . 
  same for yasemin ( turkey ) and j\u00e1zmin - which derive from persian yasmin . 
  and giulia ( italy ) and julia ( poland ) . 
   this should be your artwork , not stolen , no clipart , etc. 
  new : if a google reverse image search turns up your flag on another site , it will be removed ( you can submit it in the comment thread ) . 
  nope . 
  [ flag of cuzco ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/flag_of_cusco.svg/980px-flag_of_cusco.svg.png ) - completely unrelated ... 
  yeah . 
  there 's both historical and practical reason that symbols are usually placed in the top left corner . 
  but , regarding design only , most important is that it 's most visible there when the flag is hanging . 
  [ the god of ruse audiobook ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k4i9dqqcnu ), 
  tl ; dr : you got rused . 
  yeah . 
  that 's enough . 
  adding a second one is overkill , it 's not well visible when the flag is hanging , so unless you add one into every quarter it does n't do the flag any good . 
  i 'd also recommend a darker red colour . 
  makes the flags look more militaristic . 
  it 's not that terrible . 
  the shield is a simple pattern ( chequy of five tracts gules and argent ) , and the crown is just arms of all five historical countries/regions that make up modern croatia put together : from left to right croatia proper , dubrovnik republic , dalmatia , istria and slavonia . 
  this is actually quality satire . 
  but , well , this is reddit , so if she uses a biblical reference , it must be cringe-worthy .
