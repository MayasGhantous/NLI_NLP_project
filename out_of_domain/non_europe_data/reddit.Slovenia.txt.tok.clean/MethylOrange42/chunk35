  in fact , [ most of current latvian government standards and military ensigns ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_flags_of_latvia ) are based on the white-carmine-white cross design . 
  their current flag is actually the kuomintang regime flag , so the opposition ( especially the taiwanese nationalists ) are strongly against it . 
  he may be human , but is he humane ? 
  should n't it technically have two vertical lines and one horizontal ? 
  this way it looks like two crosses , not a double cross . 
  yeah , i kinda see it ... maybe add the blue border between the left ( top ) crossbar , which should be shorter anyway in a double cross . 
  it should break the h-ness . 
  [ explanation here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1o32u8/lonely_planet_found_without_a_star/ccouejx ), 
  since some people are wondering how such a planet generates enough heat to be detected even though it has no star , let me explain this . 
  gas giants generate heat through adiabatic contraction - its own gravity causes the gas to compress , which generates heat . 
  jupiter , for example , shrinks by about 2cm each year , generating as much heat as it receives from the sun . 
  also , neptune just as warm as uranus , exactly because it 's more massive . 
  even more massive planets contract even faster and generate much more heat , so the largest planets could generate enough heat that their moons could have liquid water , no matter how far from their star they orbit . 
  also , this means that no matter how massive a planet is , it can never get much larger than jupiter - unless it orbits really close to the star , in which case the heat from the star expands the gas . 
  such majesty, 
  wow, 
  maned doge, 
  much shimba, 
  wow, 
  that 's what western women are doing too with all the makeup . 
  i 'm sure it does n't do the pores any good . 
  what are we waiting for ? 
  well , a cosine is a parabola in first-order approximation ( i.e. 
  for small angles ) ... ( cos ( x ) \u2248 1 - 1/2 * x ^ 2 ), 
  [ ( the current flag ) ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/flag_of_manitoba.svg/500px-flag_of_manitoba.svg.png ), 
  the flag of manitoba is based on the design of the [ current coat of arms ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/arms_of_manitoba.svg/200px-arms_of_manitoba.svg.png ) . 
  a bison is depicted on a green field . 
  added are the red waves at the bottom , which represent the red river along which the red river colony , the precursor of today 's manitoba was founded . 
  the blue stripe on top of the flag is a nod to the blue chief with three stars on the coat of arms of [ clan douglas ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/douglas_arms_3.svg/200px-douglas_arms_3.svg.png ) ( [ earlier form of the coat of arms , without the heart ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/douglas_arms_1.svg/200px-douglas_arms_1.svg.png ) ) , from which thomas douglas , 5th earl of selkirk , founder of the colony was descended ( [ see also coat of arms of earls of selkirk ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/earl_of_selkirk_coa.svg/200px-earl_of_selkirk_coa.svg.png ) ) . 
  the three stars are replaced with three prairie crocuses , the official flower of the province of manitoba . 
  [ ( the current flag ) ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/flag_of_niue.svg/500px-flag_of_niue.svg.png ), 
  the main colour on the flag of niue is yellow , taken from [ the original flag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/flag_of_niue.svg/600px-flag_of_niue.svg.png ) , symbolizing `` the sunshine and warm feelings towards new zealand '' . 
  to reference new zealand , which niue is associated with , i also added a red southern cross in the top left corner . 
  in the middle , there 's a stylized red coconut palm , referencing the fact that `` niu \u0113 '' in niuean means `` behold the coconut '' . 
  coconut palm is also considered the tree of life on pacific islands . 
  the colour red is chosen because it symbolizes greetings to the visitors , similar to how natives greeted captain james cook painted in red . 
  ** [ flag of british columbia ] ( http://i.imgur.com/l0ykows.png ) **, 
  [ ( the current flag ) ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/flag_of_british_columbia.svg/500px-flag_of_british_columbia.svg.png ), 
  or perhaps not so british anymore ? 
  this design uses the colours of the [ flag of cascadia ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/flag_of_cascadia.svg/500px-flag_of_cascadia.svg.png ) ( blue , white , green ) in the same order , but arranged into a vertical tricolour instead of a horizontal one . 
  this is also similar to the [ flag of yukon territory ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/flag_of_yukon.svg/700px-flag_of_yukon.svg.png ) , but the order is reversed . 
  the order also represents the geography of the province , with the ocean in the west , forests in the east , and the coast mountains in-between . 
  the central motives are the spirit ( kermode ) bear - official provincial symbol , here symbolizing the wilderness , and the never-setting sun , a symbol currently on the flag , from the motto * splendor sine occasu * - which can be translated as either `` splendour without diminishment '' or `` a shining without a sunset '' - because british columbia is the westernmost part of canada , and historically also the westernmost part of the british realm , so it is also a reference to the concept of sun never setting on the british realm . 
  the bear is `` stolen '' from [ here ] ( http://www.heraldry.ca/kids_en/cp_bear.htm ) ; it 's supposed to be a heraldic bear rampant beige ( not a traditional colour , i know ) , but i did n't bother drawing it from scratch myself ... 
  i recently posted a flag of st. helena without the union ~ ~ jack ~ ~ flag , simply by taking the coat of arms and turning the design into a flag . 
  i decided to do similar with the other two british islands in the southern atlantic , ascension and tristan da cunha . 
  since i already submitted three designs ( which are unique in that they 're not just adaptation of the coat of arms design ) , i 'll post these three here . 
  [ flag of st. helena ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xxuzwut.jpg ) -- [ current coat of arms ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/coat_of_arms_of_saint_helena.svg/200px-coat_of_arms_of_saint_helena.svg.png ), 
  [ flag of ascension ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jht91ig.png ) -- [ current coat of arms ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/coat_of_arms_of_ascension_island.svg/517px-coat_of_arms_of_ascension_island.svg.png ), 
  [ flag of tristan da cunha ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wvs5xrq.png ) -- [ current coat of arms ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/coat_of_arms_of_tristan_da_cunha.svg/448px-coat_of_arms_of_tristan_da_cunha.svg.png ), 
  very similar to the canadian flag in design . 
  i like it - it 's simple , yet effective . 
  i 'd make the center stripe wider to accommodate the coat of arms without making it too small . 
  maybe 1:2:1 ratio . 
  similar to how the flag of canada has a wider central stripe so there is not too much blank space above and below the maple leaf . 
  [ actual flag of anguilla 1967-1969 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/flag_of_anguilla_%281967-1969%29.svg/1200px-flag_of_anguilla_%281967-1969%29.svg.png ), 
  [ or so\u010da river . 
  ] ( http://www.cong1.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2634415825_58f61026d8_o.jpg ), 
  there are just two small glaciers left in slovenia , but we have lots of glacial sediments left from the ice age . 
  spring version , anyone ? 
  it actually is the 1815-1830 french flag and pre-revolution naval ensign . 
  i hear that a lot ; almost everyone i know from abroad that has visited here was stunned by the beauties of slovenia . 
  but not many people know of us being special , and i like it that way . 
  we 're not ready for mass tourism yet , to be honest . 
  * gradients ? 
  check . 
  * lettering ? 
  check . 
  yet , also :, 
  * design so simple a child could draw it ? 
  check . 
  ... those colours ... 
  ** flag of hawaii **, 
  now it actually looks like a flag of an us state . 
  there was an article about that in the national geographic i believe . 
  irish are the niggers of britain ( british racist actually claimed that they 're closer to africans than other europeans ) , and slavs are basically mongols , because every nomadic tribe that invaded europe raped their women . 
  yeah . 
  and picture of boobs is not nsfw at all either , because it 's not as if seeing a part of body naked , especially one that is publicly displayed in multiple indigenous peoples of the tropical zone , is going to have any pornographic value at all . 
  extra chains for maximum #swag #yolo, 
  scandalous . 
  many arab countries also use this combination - red , black , white ; usually , green is added too . 
  not very creative , but this banner of arms should do the trick . 
  if christian bale wore a fedora , he 'd be atheist bale . 
  it 'd be better with a single shade of red and yellow . 
  so were spain ( 1931-1936/39 , dictatorship 1939-1975 ) and england ( 1649-1660 , de facto dictatorship under cromwell 1653-1658 ) . 
  it 's a monarchy . 
  it never says kingdom specifically . 
  oh , did n't even notice that it says `` kingdom '' there . 
  i assumed it says `` monarchy '' , just as everywhere else . 
  because weight would increase linearly with height ? 
  nope . 
  weight is proportionate to volume , which would be proportionate to the cube of height ( because it increases by the same factor in all three dimensions ) . 
  so , if someone would be 25 % taller than average , with the same body shape , he 'd be expected to be 95 % heavier ( 1.25 ^ 3 = 1.95 ) . 
  but , usually , taller people are more slender , so they weigh a bit less than that . 
  inkscape is great . 
  once you get familiar with vector graphics , it 's simple to use , and it has many useful features ( like plotting functions , vectorizing bitmaps , ... ), 
  i did my take on the flag of cyprus a while ago . . 
  you 're missing the mottos ... 
  i included portions ( usually beginnings ) of national anthems where there is no national motto . 
  some may be grammatically incorrect because my german is a bit rusty .
