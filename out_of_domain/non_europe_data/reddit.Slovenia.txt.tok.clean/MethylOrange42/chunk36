  i do n't know , argentina and chile are quite decent . 
  if you 're doing heraldry simply by looking for `` family coat of arms '' on google , you 're doing it wrong . 
  coat of arms is n't directly bound to surname ( even though it is often inherited ) , but it has to be granted to a person ( which can then pass it on ) by a monarch . 
  in short , if a person with the same surname as you used a coat of arms , this does n't a priori give you any right to use his one . 
  besides , a crest is just the object placed on top of the helm ; so in your case , the hangman 's head on the left one and the hand holding a halberd on the right one . 
  what you want to do is to marshal two coats of arms . 
  to marshal two coats of arms means to combine both motives on one shield . 
  usually , this is done by impalement , which means that you divide the field per pale ( vertically ) , and place one on the dexter ( bearer 's right , viewer 's left ) and another on sinister side . 
  another way to do it is by dimidiation - you take just a half of each coat of arms and combine them the same way . 
  usually , the husband 's coat of arms is placed on the dexter and the wife 's on the sinister . 
  dimidiation was the oldest way to combine two coats of arms , while impalement developed later to preserve both sides of the motive . 
  another later development is quartering , where motives are stacked one next to another ( as can be seen in coats of arms of many european monarchs , especially the holy roman emperors ) . 
  examples from wikipedia : [ dimidation ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/dimidiation_demo.svg/500px-dimidiation_demo.svg.png ) and [ impalement ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/impalement_demo.svg/500px-impalement_demo.svg.png ) of the same two motives . 
  usually , when a coat of arms in inherited , the heir is granted the full coat of arms , while other children take a different version of it . 
  there is a special system how kinship is signified in english and ( a different system ) in scottish heraldry , called cadency . 
  in continental heraldics , there is no such system , but cadency is still marked on coats of arms . 
  usually , you 'd just add an element to a coat of arms to make it distinct from the original one ; adding bordure , extra charges , bends , chevrons , chiefs ( different line elements ) ... 
  regarding sir francis drake , a quick search revealed that he already did n't prove the rights to bear this coat of arms , but instead usurped it from an older family he had no proof of kinship . 
  he was , therefore , granted [ a different coat of arms ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/sir_francis_drake_arms.svg/200px-sir_francis_drake_arms.svg.png ) . 
  but , since this one was granted to him personally , his brothers would not have the right to bear this coat of arms . 
  but , i guess you could still use the wyvern in some way , even though it would n't be technically correct ... 
  ... and we 're here , posting useless comments , but this time , we 're not karmawhoring , but goldwhoring . 
   casinos, 
  phew . 
  i thought we lead in corruption . 
  hypercorrection could be blamed for this ... people want to speak more fancy language , so they devoice everything . 
  [ gollum agrees .

  why not [ the old bosnian coa ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/coat_of_arms_of_bosnia_and_herzegovina_%281992-1998%29.svg/200px-coat_of_arms_of_bosnia_and_herzegovina_%281992-1998%29.svg.png ) ? 
  it looks infinitely nicer ... too bad bosnian serbs disapprove of it . 
  i think many modern artists also wish they had such skill . 
  or at least they should wish so . 
  well , white-red-white tricolour was used for a while after the ww1 , during nazi occupation , and after independence . 
  but it was without the pahonya coat of arms . 
  are you german ? 
  that would explain it . 
  needs more accent marks and viking letters . 
  source : i know some icelandic . 
  yeah , i was thinking of doing a banner of arms of western australia , but thought it would be too simple and not very original . 
  it scores better than all my three submissions . 
  it 's daejeon !, 
  wow, 
  such broote, 
  so kreg, 
  many grims, 
  chins like [ this guy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lzs0uvv.jpg ) has ? 
   good punchline, 
   it 's not in the title, 
  good job / u/dragonmoony . 
  blue balls are real , but they do n't work like this . 
  you get blue balls from being aroused for a long time ( 2-3 hours from my experience ) with no orgasm . 
  not from not fapping . 
  so , op is a fag after all . 
  introducing : ogreface . 
  you 're saying that as if men are n't discouraged from playing games . 
  all the restrictions when i was younger what games i was allowed to play under what circumstances for a set amount of time daily ... and i still get shit from my parents ( i 'm 20 ) for playing ck2 instead of , let 's say , reading a book or playing piano . 
  or solving random problems to practice for my physics degree . 
  men are just as discouraged as women are . 
  dating sites are not exactly the pinnacle of intelligent conversation though . 
  i think we were taught this in high school at psychology class . 
  if a person attains the highest level of self-actualization , he/she automatically becomes benevolent life-lover . 
  this is not the same as intelligence though , but it also somehow claims that those people are in some way `` better '' than others . 
  the teacher then continued with some intense tesla-worship , ignoring the fact that he outright despised fat people . 
  my brother and i ( aged 20 and 16 ) have quite a large set of our own words as well . 
  some sound quite bizarre and different from everything , while others are just corrupted versions of real words . 
  they mostly developed from word plays and our internal jokes . 
  when we talk to each other , we usually get weird looks from our parents - because they ca n't understand half we say , and probably also because it sounds retarded , since we 're making jokes and laughing like crazy half the time as well . 
  they already ate cumania, 
  it 's a part of [ the swedish coat of arms ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/arms_of_sweden_%28escutcheon_from_the_greater_version%29.svg/200px-arms_of_sweden_%28escutcheon_from_the_greater_version%29.svg.png ) , from the coat of arms of house of bj\u00e4lbo . 
  as a heraldic element , it 's called inescutcheon . 
  spain also used purple on their flag for a while , during the 2nd republic in the 30s : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/flag_of_spain_%281931_-_1939%29.svg/1000px-flag_of_spain_%281931_-_1939%29.svg.png, 
  nah , it just grows faster and lives longer . 
  and , with poor hygiene , it gets entangled and ca n't fall out . 
  i would n't particularly call him ... 
  ... technically , the alt gender-neutral pronouns are n't just trans thing , but more non-gender-binary thing . 
  so , if i use gender-neutral pronouns , i 'm actually not judging anyone and just using the default form that does n't assume anything at all , while using `` he '' or `` she '' would assume a person 's gender , and would thus be judging the person . 
  and i 've actually experienced a situation where someone was misgendered ( a guy thought to be a girl ) and it was quite awkward . 
  yet , in my honest opinion , all this does n't make sense . 
  it tries to hard to be politically correct , and it feels fake and forced . 
  also , where is / pol / ? 
  i was under impression that / pol / was older than it actually is . 
  ( it was created 2011-10-24 ), 
  slovene * zakaj * and croatian/serbian * za\u0161to * also have this constrution . 
  also , slovene has separate * zakaj * `` why '' and * \u010dem\u00fa * `` what for '' . 
  and * za kaj * in separate words literally means `` for what '' . 
  i really like the design # 5 . 
  the same logic would also then apply to the holy roman empire , since charlemagne was crowned as a successor of western roman empire . 
  but , is it really a farce of history to call the habsburgs german , not roman ? 
  after all , eastern roman empire was even under the original roman empire under greek cultural sphere of influence . 
  in my current game , about a third of italians are black , by 1168 . 
  aragon is ruled by a black guy as well . 
  apparently there are some quite big conflicts constantly going on in mali and somalia , so there 's a lot of immigrants ... 
  `` c '' is kind of standard way for writing / ts / in slavic languages , so it 's usually also used for languages that write in cyrillic otherwise . 
  i actually prefer pj 's hair design . 
  the beard is a bit off , though . 
  but - the hair that sticks back somehow creates appearance of extremely thick and rough hair , which somehow adds to the bear-like character in my opinion . 
  or that of [ brown rat ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/brown_rat_distribution.png ) as well ... 
  human lifetime is limited , so once human knowledge corpus becomes too large , one ca n't simply know everything there is to know . 
  there is simply not enough time to broaden your knowledge enough . 
  on other hand , one could still become a polymath , but at the cost of not being able to excel in any particular field .
