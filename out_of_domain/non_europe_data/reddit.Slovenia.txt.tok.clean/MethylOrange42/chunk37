  that is , unless he manages to somehow connect two before unconnected fields of knowledge ( as it has previously been done with physics and economy to create economic model predictions , and with informatics and neurology to create cognitive science ) . 
  but , in general , the fact that we live in a civilization where we can share our work and resources means that it 's sometimes better to specialize than to broaden . 
  just like there were separate crafts - shoemakers , carpenters and masons ; productivity increases when a person has a single profession . 
  but , this is better just as long as the society is stable and as long as people uniformly specialize in different professions . 
  a jack-of-all-trades may not be as suited to being a part of society , but he 's more valuable as a single person , which is important when things are not running as smoothly as they should ... 
  if i recall correctly , the definition of being a polymath is simply that , being versed in multiple fields . 
  so , this would still already make you a polymath . 
   being this new, 
  interesting pattern . 
  reminds me of [ penrose tilings ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/penrose_tiling_%28rhombi%29.svg/1000px-penrose_tiling_%28rhombi%29.svg.png ) ; it has pentagonal symmetry , a set number of used shapes , but is not periodic ( does n't repeat itself ) . 
  ( this could as well go into / r/mildlyinteresting ), 
  this reminds me of how the verb `` to ban '' developed in english . 
  middle english still hat infinitive ending * - en * , similar to other germanic languages like dutch and german , so it was * bannen * . 
  the e in ending * - en * , however , is a result of vowel reduction from a ; so it was * bannan * in anglo-saxon ( and old german , as well ) . 
  the ( reconstructed ) ending for infinitive in proto-germanic , however , was * - an\u0105 * or * - \u014dn\u0105 * , with a nasalized final vowel , so the verb `` to ban '' ( which had original meaning of `` to proclaim , curse , forbid '' ) was * bannan\u0105 * , pronounced / ban.na.nan / . 
  so , if i simplify it a bit , the development of the verb went : * bannanan *  * bannan *  * ban * . 
  not to mention that it sounds a bit like banana , which reminds me of the [ banananas ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-w4mflfevi0w/tupqwxh0-ri/aaaaaaaabic/ss7gtdke8qk/s1600/banananas.jpg ) . 
  it does indeed say reddit . 
  also , when in doubt , [ use wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_maritime_signal_flags ) . 
  to confirm your guessing . 
  perhaps it 's best to consult with google first . 
  i test-searched for `` boat letter flags '' on google ; first hit was the wikipedia article . 
  it 's never too dumb a query . 
  just add `` site : wikipedia.org '' to a google search query . 
  all hits will be from wikipedia , and they 'll make use of google 's superior keyword-finding search algorithm . 
  that 's how i usually search for wikipedia articles about things i know exist but do n't know how they 're actually named . 
  well , this really depends on the situation . 
  when i talk about value as a single person , i 'm talking about the ability to face problems on their own . 
  so , i 'd regard a swiss army knife with many tools , even if it 's of relatively poorer quality , as a worthier tool than a work-of-art knife . 
  if you were allowed to take with you one tool only , not knowing what problems you might face , which one would you take - the one of higher quality , or the one of higher utility ? 
  because that 's how much a tool can do on its own . 
   mfw people think people think this is real, 
  stay new, 
  neither has true capitalism then , by that logic . 
  in this case , symbols are directly part of the ideology . 
  similar to how religious symbols are cross-cultural . 
  i think ck2 gameplay could be modified to fit 1st age beleriand . 
  conflict between the houses of f\u00ebanor , fingolfin and finarfin ( brothers ) , fighring for the title of high king of \u00d1oldor . 
  elu thingol , the high king of sindar and king of doriath had feudal-like relationship with e\u00f6l of nan elmoth and the haladin ( mannish tribe ) of brethil . 
  they had much greater power over their people than other smaller lords , who were mostly obliged to fight in their armies - again showing elements of vassal-liege relationship . 
  also , the wars between the forces of morgoth and the free peoples could be incorporated as functioning similar to holy wars . 
  but , tolkien did n't write much about feudal relationships between elven lords , and since they were mostly close kin ( elves are small in numbers ) , it probably was n't true feudalism as it was manifested in , say , medieval europe , sengoku period japan , or the ancient persian empires . 
  [ my comment in another thread ... ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/crusaderkings/comments/1q48tr/mods_of_ckii/cd92hyd ), 
  in short , i would n't create a mod for the war of the ring in the third age of the last alliance in the second , but for beleriand in the first age . 
  dynamics would probably fit much better . 
  otherwise , i do n't have many unique system ideas , but tech tree should probably have to be massively reworked , so that different races are forced to focus different technologies . 
  also , i 'd like to see duels happen , as there are many examples from silmarillion : fingolfin vs morgoth , t\u00farin vs glaurung , ecthelion vs gothmog ... of course , there could be weapon `` traits '' that modify duel outcomes . 
  wow, 
  such snow, 
  very wildernese, 
  maybe they were originally used as military standards/banners and were thus hung vertically , so they were actually displayed properly . 
  but i do n't know , i 'm just guessing . 
  flying the flags vertically actually makes more sense when on land , because it allows the full flag to be displayed even when there is no wind . 
  on contrary , horizontal flags make more sense on ships . 
  but somehow the horizontal shape became the standard . 
  also , flags of municipalities in slovenia are properly displayed vertically , but some also allow for horizontal flying . 
  they 're usually just simple bi - or tri-colours with coats of arms displayed . 
  but , hanging the flag instead of flying it makes much more sense when on land and there is no wind . 
  write backslash before hashtag ; like this : \\ \\ #,

   had a gf, 
  he kind of gave it away here already, 
  [ i get a strong nazi vibe with this flag ... ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/war_ensign_of_germany_1938-1945.svg/1000px-war_ensign_of_germany_1938-1945.svg.png ), 
  that 's because it 's a majestic dog , and has a mane , like a lion !, 
  well , considering the fact that nazi/fascist symbolism is generally very well done , it 's not a bad thing at all . 
  it 's m\u00fbmak in singular and m\u00fbmakil in plural . 
  so , the question should be either `` does the m\u00fbmak ... '' , or considering there were multiple m\u00fbmak-kills in the movie , `` do the m\u00fbmakil ... '' . 
  really ? 
  [ this article ] ( http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/alderaan ) states 2 billion as population of alderaan before destruction . 
  so i guess you actually mean 1.97 billion . 
  what about just single stories from the silmarillion ? 
  the story of t\u00farin turambar ? 
  the fall of gondolin ? 
  that could actually work , if done properly . 
  that 's just because it uses one of the most intricately designed coats of arms . 
  nah , the timestamp quite obviously says `` 11/10/13 00:43:32 '' . 
  so he just does n't know it 's an old copypasta ... 
  the cropping still is terrible . 
  the great gatsby was written in 1925 . 
  so , if `` great cousin '' means parent 's cousin ( which would be just 1st cousin 1ce removed ) , assuming one generation is 25 years , she should be about 60 if that was true . 
  this one should work for everyone, 
  nope , i 'm calling her old . 
  also , one generation can easily be up to 50 years . 
  it 's just an estimate . 
  nope . 
  i like to milk karma jumping the bandwagon . 
  yes , it would be a good idea . 
  that 's what macedonians ( at least some ) do ... 
  i played around a bit with [ french coats of arms from wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gallery_of_french_coats_of_arms ) in inkscape ; this is the result : http://i.imgur.com/dtapdwb.png, 
  there 's even a small group in slovenia who honestly believes that slovenes are not really slavs , but venetic , saying that they were called venets and not slovenets ( slovenian word for slovene person is slovenec ) because greek could n't pronounce the consonant cluster / sl / . 
  to prove that they take various venetic scribbles and try to read them as overly-poetic descriptions of various rituals , because slovenes are obviously the most poetic nation that has ever lived , and unlike other peoples did n't write down yearly crops and inscriptions honouring their rulers , but preferred to write impressionist poetry . 
  a part of this claim is also that slovenes are older than all other indo-european groups in europe , and that everywhere an etnonym or toponym only remotely similar to the word * venet appears , it must be slovenians who once lived there ; for example , vindhya mountains in central india . 
  the fun part is that venice is pronounced with b in slovenian ( benetke ) , so according to their bad linguistics , we 'd call ourselves slobeneti , and not slovenci . 
  this is not 4chan this is shrekchan, 
  this made me giggle . 
  as far as i know , they 're all speculative , and there is no map that connects beleriand with the rest of middle earth , but there are enough clues to make a good reconstruction - islands of himling , tol fuin and tol morwen , the size of blue mountains , and iron mountains in the north , that continue along northern border of eriador and meet with misty mountains at angmar . 
  the one on the left . 
  the one on the right is the original design . 
  the right one was modified by socialists to include traditionally socialist colours only - and a red star . 
  this gives it extra meaning that is political rather than national in nature , which makes it less appropriate for a country flag .
