  she 's that creepy old aunt that your parents insist that you kiss her , and you are disgusted . 
  again , the one i first wanted to submit has already been submitted :, 
  [ coat of arms of styria ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/steiermark_wappen.svg/218px-steiermark_wappen.svg.png ), 
  * vert , a panther rampant argent , armed , horned and breathing flames all gules . 
  so , i thought i could show possible precursor to this symbol , perhaps going back to pre-heraldic times ( as a symbol of carantania ) . 
  but there is not much historical evidence of this , and the symbol is mostly used as a slovenian nationalist symbol . 
  nevertheless , the ties of the black panther symbol with the territory of the early ottonian carinthia seem to be beyond doubt . 
  it makes its appearance on the coat of arms of the carinthian duke herman ii as well as of the styrian margrave ottokar iii . 
  so , the blazon is : * argent , a panther rampant sable , armed , horned and breathing flames all gules . 
  it needs to be noted that heraldic panther existed before big cats started to be called panthers . 
  so , a panther as a cat is a real animal named after a mythological beast , similar to the komodo dragon . 
  * of many colours * or * bendy sinister azure , gules , vert and argent * ? 
  i 'm quite sure he 's not the only one in this business . 
  so , this particular image is rendered with colourful bendy sinister , and it 's supposed to be just random ? 
  makes sense . 
  gilbert baldwinson of flanders . 
  nothing too random here ... 
  ( not oc ), 
  reading those posts makes me remember of when i was around 13 , living in my own imaginary world . 
  i just cringe at the thought that i may end up just like them , if people were more accepting of my weirdness . 
  luckily , they were n't . 
  well , i agree that putting the seal on the flag is generally a bad idea , but still ... this is a pretty nice design . 
  even though the seal is a bit too complicated . 
  but , it works better as a standard than it would as a flag . 
   the moths have a wingspan ranging from 32 to 45mm, 
  is it really so hard to check wikipedia ? 
  i think wingspan is the standard measurement for moths and butterflies . 
  just like how horse height is measured to the withers ( basically shoulders ) . 
  but , using the picture as reference , one can assume body length of 25 to 35mm . 
  i guess the best idea now is to runescape . 
  i actually came here expecting this to be the top comment . 
  i have n't tried it , and refuse to do so ever . 
  it sounds too shitty ( hhehe ) to be even worth trying . 
  turning 22 : `` omg dubs !!! '', 
  ( it does n't work at 11 because  underage b & ), 
  putting the holy back into the hre . 
  except that you ca n't do that . 
  science is applying logic to explain natural phenomena . 
  in order to explain them , they first need to be repeatable - this automatically makes unrepeatable statistical flukes outside of science 's domain , and this also includes alleged miracles . 
  a single measurement can not confirm or disprove anything . 
  science also needs to measure or at least observe , if not actively prepare repeatable experiments - again , you ca n't measure that god does n't exist , because there is nothing to measure to confirm or disprove it . 
  not to mention that g\u00f6del 's incompleteness theorems actively show that even using logic , it is impossible to find a complete and consistent set of axioms or to prove all truths . 
  this means that the scientific method , based on logic and its derivations , is actually expected to be unable to explain the complete nature of the universe . 
  it 's not fallacious . 
  it 's just irrelevant . 
  tale the continuum hypothesis in mathematics as an example . 
  it states :, 
   there is no set whose cardinality is strictly between that of the integers and that of the real numbers . 
  it has been proved in 1963 that this hypothesis can be proved neither true nor false . 
  what is more , it being true or false changes absolutely nothing about infinite set cardinalities . 
  so , even if it is outside the realm of provable , it would not be ridiculous to assume its existence . 
  it would be ridiculous attempting to prove it false . 
  neither is belief in its absence without evidence then . 
  i wash my hair once a week . 
  i 'm european , but with very dry puffy wavy hair ( not curly though ) . 
  if i wash more often than twice a week , my hair starts looking woolly and my scalp dries up , leading to dandruff . 
  i also oil up my hair after washing . 
  if a moon like titan orbited as close as earth , it would be unable to hold the atmosphere . 
  titan is much colder , so gas molecules have lower kinetic energy , so they ca n't escape , even though titan 's gravitational field is weak compared even to mars . 
  but , if you turn the heat up a bit , the molecules start moving faster , and can escape gravitational pull much easier . 
  technically speaking , even earth is losing atmosphere , but - with the exception of hydrogen and helium , the lightest gases - the rate is far too slow to be noticeable . 
  so , you 'd need a much bigger moon , bigger even than mars . 
  this looks interesting . 
  it may be a bit too complicated for making just simple sketches of tectonic plates , but it should allow for a bit more realistic results . 
  i 'll definitely try it out when i have some more time . 
  well , when he was a kid , they did n't exist yet . 
  it 's actually more universal than you might think . 
  every time period has its own little quirks - linked to status symbols of the particular society , but the general idea of what is attractive does n't change . 
  but , the ideal is sometimes fatter than the average and sometimes thinner - but this is more because the average changes , not so much because the ideal changes . 
  also , before you jump to the usual argument , paintings do n't need to depict what is considered ideally beautiful - they can also limited by either the proficiency of the artists or their dedication to realism . 
  i believe that what is considered attractive varies much more between different people of the same time period than between different time periods . 
  a bit chubby back then is what would be considered almost visible ribs nowadays . 
  no , i do n't have any real reading material ... 
  there are some differences , of course , for example the eastasian cultures put greater emphasis on cuteness in general , while sexy is the ideal in europe and africa , but this is correlated to different general body shape . 
  but i think i read in steven pinker 's work how the mind works ( a popular science book on cognitive science ) that yanomamo people from brazil in general agreed with western views on what is attractive . 
  i 'd love to see an exhaustive analysis , though . 
  even if it would prove me wrong . 
  the game ca n't handle palatalization in slavic languages yet . 
  * gules , a paschal lamb proper . 
  a paschal lamb is * a lamb passant proper , with a halo or charged with a cross gules , and the dexter forelimb reflexed over a cross staff from which a pennon of st. george ( argent a cross gules ) is flotant * ( description taken from wikipedia ) .

   nice, 
  this reminds me of [ s4s ], 
  freud would like to have a word with them ... 
  this emblem replaced [ the old communist one ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/coat_of_arms_of_the_people%27s_republic_of_mongolia.svg/500px-coat_of_arms_of_the_people%27s_republic_of_mongolia.svg.png ) ; and it 's actually quite similar to other ( former and current ) emblems of former eastern bloc countries . 
  most of them are round in shape , usually surrounded by two stalks of wheat ( or some other crop ) , with a central motif - in this case , the wind horse , * khiimori * . 
  in a way , this is similar to how the states of usa use the state seals . 
  heh , i recognise some of those . 
  i especially like the [ # 15 ] ( http://cdn2.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article29809541.ece/alternates/h342/ni1.jpg ) . 
  and , [ # 38 ] ( http://cdn1.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article29809551.ece/alternates/h342/flaxflag.jpg ) looks like it was based on [ my submission to our contest ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rxmmyss.png ) ... 
  there is always a relevant xkcd . 
  dolan pls, 
  well , he 's managed to depose both archbishops in slovenia . 
  they were involved in a big financial scandal . 
  the archdiocese of maribor formed two big holding companies , indebted them for some hundred million euros and when the recession hit they could n't repay it . 
  and they got away with it because they 're high church officials , an archdiocese as a religious organization can not be liquidated and vatican can cover the debt .
