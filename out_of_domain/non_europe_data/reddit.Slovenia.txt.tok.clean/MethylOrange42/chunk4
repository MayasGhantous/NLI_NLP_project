  however , it 's still in the opposite direction . 
  the catchiness is a huge factor ... and yes , i admit that dragonforce is actually sometimes way over the top when it comes to good taste . 
  but they do n't feel bland , that 's what i like !, 
  no , it 's on another , parallel hyperspace route . 
  ... and link to the entire album . 
  been there on sunday , climbed the hill below that mountain , and then ended the day with a nice meal and warm bed ( shared with my girlfriend ) . 
  there was no snow though :d ( except for the mountain , ofc ), 
  this should be posted under rules so that fagets wo n't repost it any more . 
   greentext,

   no wincest, 
  op is a faggot . 
  that awkward moment when you need to explain why you 're subscribed to / r/animalporn . 
  [ so do i. . . ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxlz6edchqi ), 
  i thought so too ... 
  well , i think i read somewhere that they made thorin younger , making him about the same age as dwalin and oin , as well as compressing the backstory . 
  in the books , smaug took over erebor when , of the company , only thorin and balin were already born , aged 24 and 7 , respectively . 
  in the movie , they 're already grown up at that time . 
  also , in the books it is said that fili and kili are the youngest by 50 years , while in the movie , ori is said to be the youngest . 
  no it moved into outer space because eru got mad . 
  so that one does not simply sail to valinor but needs to use the magic elven ships . 
  you forgot tauriel . 
  they need a hot female elf because kili/tauriel romance subplot . 
  yes , he arrived in early third age to middle-earth as an old man , along with four other istari ( saruman , radagast , and the blue wizards alatar and pallando ) . 
  before that , he was a maia in valinor , named ol\u00f3rin . 
  galadriel was born in valinor , during the years of the trees . 
  she lived there for approximately 1000 years , so it 's quite possible that she knew ol\u00f3rin , since it is said that he was a good friend of the elves , to which he appeared in elven form . 
  therefore , it is safe to assume that galadriel has memory of a young , elf-like gandalf from valinor . 
  this was on / b /, 
  so far awaaay, 
   implying i do n't read / pol /, 
  `` gandolf is named for a character in the william morris fantasy novel the well at the world 's end ( 1896 ) . 
  similar names such as gandalf and gandalfr can be traced to norse sagas of the 12th century ; the name is derived from the norse words for `` wand '' or `` staff '' ( also interpreted as `` magic '' ) and `` elf . '' '', 
  this . 
  so many times this . 
  every time there is an irl debate concerning gay marriage , i say this , and the response is `` you must be trolling '' . 
  sir christopher lee quite likely does . 
  i 'd write the ` oo ' as u , though . 
  just because of the sound , just like the ` sh ' . 
  it 's the writing on the ring ( first line is same as second ) , with some missing vowel marks . 
  long - double u ? 
  went googling to check for rule 34 . 
  oh god why, 
  one of these things is not like the others ...

  it 's a shame you got downvoted . 
  i think this looks bad , but not because it 's not shaved . 
  there 's one album more, 
  funny ; i find high heels a turnoff ... 
  i just do n't like the raptor gait they induce . 
  i 'm not a big fan of type number 4 ( unlike most men , i guess ) , it looks too unbalanced to me . 
  note the timestamp, 
  it means op is a faggot, 
  do n't worry , i know some girls that almost exclusively wear heels . 
  so i guess they know how to walk . 
  but no , i still find it unattractive ; because it seems forced . 
  has anyone noticed anything strange about the pic ?

  galadriel could be post-metal . 
  especially considering [ this song . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouabqfhd5im ), 
  his voice indeed is majestic . 
  power metal needs more singers like him . 
  for example , thaurorod had a baritone singer for a while ( vladimir lumi , [ ( link ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dykssv82wao ) ) . 
  one does not simply stop posting these .
