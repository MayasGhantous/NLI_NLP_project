  i 'm not sure how much of this is actually the pope 's work , but still . 
  relevant [ latvian naval ensign ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/naval_ensign_of_latvia.svg/600px-naval_ensign_of_latvia.svg.png ) ... not a nordic cross , but still a cross . 
  flax flower . 
  a symbol of linen industry and pretty much the only neutral symbol of northern ireland . 
  it 's already used as a logo of northern ireland assembly ( on stalks though , not just the flower ) . 
  also numerous movie posters . 
  let me try :, 
  azure ) , a bordure gules , ~ ~ in ~ ~ a chief gules three coronets or . 
  yeah , that 's what i had in my mind . 
  i was too lazy to do it myself though . 
  you 're right . 
  it would be either * a chief * or * on the chief * . 
  * in chief * means that there is no chief as a field , there are just charges placed there . 
  hazel-eyed masterrace reporting in . 
  also , my father has blue eyes with yellow specks . 
  basically the blue-eyed equivalent of hazel eyes . 
  beat that . 
  from what i experienced , most guys do n't care about makeup at all , while women give each other shit for not conforming and wearing makeup . 
  women perpetuate this themselves . 
  so , yeah , it 's definitely patriarchy doing it , makes perfect sense . 
  not to mention that every time i say that i prefer no makeup , harpies jump at me saying that i do n't even know how women look without because they always wear makeup to hide how hideous they are . 
  as if i would n't know how natural skin looks like compared to makeup ; i see it on my face every morning in the mirror . 
  even if i have to shave to uncover the skin first . 
  looks similar to [ the flag of limburg , netherlands ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/nl-limburgvlag.svg/600px-nl-limburgvlag.svg.png ) . 
  any meaning behind this ? 
   be careful ; there is some racist language and overall rowdyness in there , so make sure you 're in a safe place where people ca n't exactly read what everyone is saying . 
  that 's a pretty good description of what to expect on 4chan , even though it might be a bit soft and tame one . 
  / pol / is sfw ... most of the time . 
  they made a rule interracial porn and muhdick thread some months ago . 
  i usually browse / pol / , / fa / , / ck / , and [ s4s ] when i feel silly . 
  / b / is just ... too random for me . 
  this was price-less . 
  i 'm a non-native english speaker . 
  i had to learn that you 're not supposed to pronounce those word-initial clusters properly when speaking english . 
  that 's because traditional gender roles are based in biology . 
  they 're intrinsic . 
  society can bend them , but not turn them over . 
  i think the problem is that reproduction has very different price for the genders . 
  a man can conceive a child in order of minutes , while the woman will pay the price for irresponsible sex for the next nine months ( that is , if abortion is not an available option ) . 
  as a consequence , a man can father thousands of children ( as genghis khan probably did ) , while a woman can be a mother to 40 children at most ( assuming one child every nine months from age 20 to 50 ) . 
  this means that anything more than 40 partners in a woman 's lifetime is a waste of sex , but it 's not for a man . 
  this is deeply ingrained into our subconsciousness . 
  remember that humans have been around for last two million years , while civilization is only some millennia old . 
  explain this to scots . 
  i know about the origin of kilts . 
  but , was n't britain in roman times actually warmer ? 
  if i recall correctly , romans brought wine grapes to britain . 
  while the climate was considered cold , local wine was indeed produced . 
  it was in the medieval period when it got colder - and wine was displaced by , because apples can grow in colder climate . 
  roman britain was probably about as warm as it is today . 
  romans , being mediterranean , would of course still consider the climate cold .

  \\* tips tophat *, 
  in short : you 're fucked . 
  i 'm in a similar situation . 
  the reason is that i just ca n't imagine myself getting along with just anyone ( i 'm too different from other people i know mentally ) , so i always want to get to know girls beforehand . 
  i 'm 19 , only had one relationship ( which ended pretty badly ) , and just ca n't imagine myself being in relationship with anyone i know . 
  especially not while i 'm doing a double degree in physics and chemistry . 
  there is just not enough time for little games of dating . 
  the problem is that you 're too young . 
  people your age mostly fall in love on first sight . 
  for some , there is not much emotional bonding at all , while for others , it starts forming after they already are in a relationship . 
  the obvious solution is to wait a bit , and grow up first . 
  most girls will probably already be taken by them , but if you 're lucky ... well , that 's what i 'm hoping for . 
  otherwise , i 'll probably just have to accept celibate . 
  if you 're asexual / have low libido , this may even be the best decision . 
  you do n't need to do dating at all . 
  gulf stream . 
  it 's actually 0 % if the guy is an average redditor . 
  thank you , good sir . 
  you are a scholar and a gentleman . 
  there is no society that has it other way . 
  this is a big sign that it probably is n't culturally conditioned . 
  pretty much all societies where polyandry is/was common are fringe cases ( guanches , tibetans ) where population had to adapt to living conditions with limited space that disallowed expansion . 
  i ca n't think of a particular source or an article , but cognitive science deals a lot with questions like this . 
  and it usually turns out that human mind is not near as fluid as we may think it is . 
  i 'd recommend the book * how the mind works * by steven pinker . 
  chapter 7 deals with gender roles and family as a unit . 
  disregarding the society completely does n't make sense , though . 
  environment and society determine what part of human nature is more pronounced . 
  but there are some things that just ca n't change , at least not in just a few generations . 
  material things ? 
  you see , gifts have much more than just material value . 
  they show dedication . 
  if you choose a gift wisely ( or even if you make it yourself ) , it can be much more valuable to the person you give it to than what it 's worth in money . 
  a good gift is not a shiny trinket . 
  it 's a meaningful item , that a person can attach their emotions to . 
  fingers are just bones and skin . 
  no meat in them . 
  the muscles that move fingers are [ located in the forearm ] ( http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~uzwiak/anatphys/apfalllect15_files/image024.jpg ) . 
  so , the only thing you can do is a ) get your bones thicker or b ) get your skin thicker . 
  the only way to do a ) is to break your fingers , let them heal , rinse and repeat . 
  to do b ) you need to start doing hard manual labour which will get your skin thicker and tougher . 
  but i do n't think this makes much sense . 
  long fingers never look girly . 
  if you do n't believe me - try to imagine a girl with fingers like yours . 
  if it would look weird , then your fingers are manly enough . 
  read the text again . 
  hopi are not matriarchal . 
  they are egalitarian .
