  not to mention that the reports may be confirmation-biased . 
  studying the history of hopi people ( especially the pueblo revolt of 1680 ) should convince you that they 're actually no different from other peoples , and that matriarchalization has apparently started later as a result of lack of men . 
  also a coat of arms of the princely house of grimaldi . 
  blazon : * fusily argent and gules . 
  the monks supporting the coat of arms are a reference to francesco grimaldi 's conquest of monaco in 1297 , when he and his men seized the castle , disguised as franciscan monks . 
  technically speaking , those are alchemical symbols . 
  the [ coa of nauru ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e9/coat_of_arms_of_nauru.png ) also includes an alchemical symbol ; that of phosphorus . 
  one of the most simple blazons . 
  ermine is a standard heraldic fur , with fixed colours . 
  it can be described as : * argent , sem\u00e9 of ermine spots sable * . 
  spots , however , are considered a part of the texture itself , and not as charges on the field . 
  variations are : * counter-ermine * - with reversed colours , * erminois * - with field or instead of argent , and * pean * - reverse of * erminois * . 
  other combinations of tinctures on the same pattern can be described as * ermined * - for example , standard * ermine * would be * argent ermined sable * . 
  assuming that every person has the same build is ridiculous . 
  what i have noticed is the skinnyfat people . 
  they have really slender build , so they 're normal weight , even though they are actually fat . 
  and they argue that they 're healthy weight , even though it 's obvious they could lose some . 
  i remember once a girl posting on 4chan 's / fa / , asking for some advice on what to wear . 
  she was the epitome of skinnyfat - she looked slender , but soft and flabby . 
  of course , / fa / likes to circlejerk about rail-thin fashion models . 
  everyone commented that she 's wearing too tight shorts , that she needs to lose weight , and that her muffin top is showing . 
  she then proceeded to argue about how thin she actually is , and that if she lost weight , she 'd have no boobs left . 
  on contrary , some people are just bulky . 
  though none are jabba-the-hutt-bulky , as some landwhales want to propose . 
  fun fact : the serbian word for the act of blowjob literally means cocksmoking . 
  have you ever heard of the three general body constitution types ? 
  the slender ectomorph , the athletic mesomorph , and the bulky endomorph ? 
  [ ( reference ) ] ( http://www.muscleandstrength.com/sites/default/files/images/bodytypes.jpg ), 
  a person may have a slender ectomorph build , but relatively high body fat percentage as a result of bad physical condition and diet with high energy but low nutritious value . 
  this is quite common today , because of our sedentary lifestyle and food based on staples . 
  now - i 'm not talking about those that are obviously fat . 
  i 'm talking about those that fall into normal weight range , with long bones and low muscle mass . 
  [ for example , take this photo . 
  ] ( http://graemethomasonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/skinny-fat-woman.jpg ) ( i have no idea who this is , but google returned this photo , and it 's a good enough example . 
  it 's hard to find anything better ... ) she looks slender , and if she were wearing clothes she 'd look okay . 
  but - her belly is visibly flabby . 
  also , taking her body shape in account , her ribs should be at least slightly visible , but this is not the case . 
  not to mention the fat bulking out of her swimsuit above her chest . 
  [ or this progress photo of a guy . 
  ] ( http://anthonymychal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/progress.jpg ) on the right photo , it 's obvious that he has a skinny build . 
  on the left photo , he had normal proportions , but was obviously fat . 
  if he were wearing a shirt , you may not even notice it . 
  now , the girl i mentioned was even more extreme skinnyfat . 
  but i was n't a faggot and did n't save the photo , so i ca n't show it here . 
  yeah , take for example heavyweight boxers . 
  or weightlifters . 
  most of the strongest people are endomorphs . 
  plus-size models are endomorphs as well , but because they 're in shape , they just look curvy . 
  the reason why it looks worse is because they have shorter limbs , so they look proportionally fatter . 
  and so has been the concept of human races . 
  but this does n't mean that an englishman can get as tanned as an ethiopian , right ? 
  the original theory behind constitution types does n't really make much sense , but the classification itself is meaningful . 
  even though people generally fit in-between the three extreme types . 
  electrons have negative charge . 
  that 's why the electric current goes in the opposite direction - there 's an extra minus sign . 
  just like how if something is approaching at -10 km/h , it 's actually going away at +10 km/h . 
  shit like this pisses you of . 
  wow , they 're much better at this than 4chan . 
  it 's a miracle when they get to 5 ... 
   the idea of race is scientifically meaningless . 
  it 's a social construct . 
  you see , science itself is a social construct . 
  it 's a system that helps us understand the world . 
  but , let 's leave this debate for philosophy , and go to actual arguments . 
  different human populations are different , period . 
  the old fashioned racial classification is way too simplistic to take everything into account . 
  but this does n't make the whole idea of splitting world population into different groups flawed . 
  some alleles show quite strong clustering within certain large population groups ( see : * human genetic diversity : lewontin 's fallacy * by a.w.f. 
  edwards and * genetic similarities within and between human populations * by d.j. 
  witherspoon et.al . ) . 
  you could then as well say that colours are a social construct as there 's no sharp borders between different colours and there is quite wild variation in both saturation and lightness inside one colour . 
  the fok u say 2 me m8, 
   race is a meaningless concept outside of human sociology . 
  ever heard of the sickle cell disease ? 
  also , i 'm not talking about single alleles . 
  i 'm talking about combinations of alleles getting clustered around single values . 
  check [ this graph ] ( http://occidentalascent.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/population.jpg ) : note clustering of europeans ( or if you want , `` caucasians '' - i hate this term ) in top left corner , east asians in top right corner , and indians ( a bit more scattered ) in the lower area . 
  there are also links between the populations - the nepalese in-between indians and east-asians and kyrgyz in-between east asians and europeans , as would be expected . 
  but clusters on their own are very well-defined . 
  since such clustering occurs when studying various pairs of allele distributions ( there are more graphs , you can google them - search for pca - primary component analysis genetics ) , with the same groups clustering , the only valid conclusion would be that these clusters represent different races . 
  yes , and he needs to learn to control himself . 
  it 's just like you ca n't just let a child eat as much sweets as he wants . 
  it 's just as addicting , because of the dopamine high . 
  and the key word here is `` excessive '' . 
  when 's the last time you had sex several times a day on a regular basis ? 
  the burden of evidence lies on you . 
  i 've shown you ** all ** the evidence , but you just do n't want to accept it . 
  if you do n't want to call those `` races '' because of negative political ( ot whatever kind of ) connotation , then okay , refuse to do so . 
  but then we 're arguing semantics . 
  pacific islanders do metabolize glucose differently , which is a reason for the current epidemic of obesity and diabetes in the pacific . 
  east asians have more tolerance for soy phytoestrogens . 
  lactose tolerance is mostly an european trait . 
  atenolol lowers blood pressure in europeans , but significantly less in africans . 
  the concept of race should n't be based exclusively on morphological differences , but this does n't mean that they 're completely irrelevant . 
  they 're just another marker among a large set of variables , traits that can be used to group different human populations into different groups . 
  and why is applying the term race to fuzzy sets of traits wrong and nonsensical ? 
  just because a hundred years ago some overly excited social scientists thought that races are much more sharply defined and defining than they actually are ? 
  i was gon na say classic / b / , but then i realised how right i actually was . 
  this is amazing , though it would be even better if the tinctures were properly hatched ( gules is , though ) . 
  i think it would look better with yellow-and-red eagle of saladin , in the same colours as the star .
