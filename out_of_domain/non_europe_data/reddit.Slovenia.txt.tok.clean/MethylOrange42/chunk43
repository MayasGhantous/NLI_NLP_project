  and they seem to be getting bigger and bigger each year . 
  but it would look nicer in / r/heraldry ... 
  i think an interesting idea would be to have new , emerging civilizations , that arise from barbarian invasions . 
  if a barbarian invasion is successful , and barbarians capture and hold the city for a number of turns , the horde that conquered it turns into a new civilization . 
  that could actually emulate how civilizations like franks , mongols , ( seljuk ) turks , and even aztecs came into existence . 
  wonderfully disgusting !, 
  made me want to puke a little . 
  [ flag of manitoba ] ( http://i.imgur.com/aqmq82k.png ) for the remove the union flag contest . 
  even though it did n't get that much votes . 
  it was n't even the top flag of the ones that i submitted to that contest . 
  i still really like how it turned out . 
  also , i learned how to plot functions is inkscape with this flag . 
  close second would be the [ flag of altamira ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pj4lxpd.png ) which won the flag of art contest . 
  it looks really nice , but ... 
  i somehow feel that it 's a bit uninspired , because it 's just a nice vectorized cavepaint graphic on a flag of fitting colours . 
  i do n't have an appropriate scientific source , but i remember from a controversial norwegian popular science show hjernevask ( brainwash ) that women from developed , egalitarian countries actually like doing female gender role type of things more than women from less developed countries with stronger gender roles . 
  makes you wonder if gender roles are n't in fact biological and innate ( at least for an average person ) . 
  though swedish counties use heraldic flags , which are basically the same as the coats of arms . 
  but why is it still here then ? 
  [ this might be just as relevant ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xtep8xc.png ), 
  you have her tagged as well ? 
  from when / pol / wanted to establish a colony on svalbard last summer :, 
  i have no idea what happened with the idea afterwards . 
  [ mongolian folk metal ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6ebatvp9f4 ) is [ fucking awesome . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfsu8kysiri ), 
  [ their traditional music ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0etrzi5-ong ) is one of the best folk music traditions in the world in my opinion , along with the closely related tuvan folk music . 
  there are also [ some ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evsgt2m228m ) really [ nice ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ch7gi-xeee ) mongolian [ ( and tuvan ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khyboaw4piu ) folk rock bands . 
  a bit softer , but with the same amount of balls . 
  edit : oh shit , i forgot [ one more band ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxqdvu8a8ve ) that deserves mention as well ... 
  * merdidominus * , possibly shortened to * merdominus * . 
  * dominus stercoris * ... do n't misappropriate the cases !, 
  * merdomini - because of the plural . 
  ftfy, 
  ... and just one perm ?!, 
  also , how come albanian is closest to slovenian from all slavic languages ? 
  or is it just a line between albanian and the whole slavic language family ? 
  david salo , the guy behind the languages in the movie , says that it says * innikh d\u00ea * , which means `` return to me '' . 
  one thing that bothers me a lot about democracy is that the government is immediately considered legitimate when it gets elected . 
  they already rule by the will of people . 
  in non-democratic systems , no matter how the government gets appointed , they need to acquire that legitimacy through their rule . 
  also , i would not consider an average person capable of voting in election . 
  when i talk to other people in my country ( slovenia ) about current political issues , most of the time i get an impression that they have no idea what is going on and what i 'm talking about . 
  for a democracy to be truly democratic , the people that make the choice must at least know what they 're doing , even if they 're just choosing who gets to represent them . 
  what about something like this flag i made a while ago ? 
  swimming nude was the norm until the mid 19th century , in the uk it was banned in 1860 . 
  bathing costumes were mostly used in spas . 
  that would actually be counterproductive . 
  hell , i did it last summer . 
  orthographic is a globe in profile . 
  so the head on the orthographic projection should be shown undistorted . 
  yes , it was lost . 
  icelandic is not that similar to old norse then it comes to pronunciation . 
  long vowels became diphthongs , / y / merged with / i / , / \u01eb / merged with / \u00f8 / , unvoiced stops became aspirated and voiced became unvoiced , intervocalic / g / is pronounced as an approximant whose pronunciation depends on the environment , / u / fronted to / y / , and geminate sonorants became somewhat affricate : / nn / to / tn / and / ll / to / tl / . 
  though , most phonemes can easily be traced back to old norse . 
  the vocabulary is much more conservative as well . 
  [ so is slovenia . 
  it did n't ? 
  * sang * / s\u0251\u0303 / in french is parallel to * sangue * / s\u0250\u0303\u0261\u0268 / in portuguese ; both produced a nasalized monophtong ( in case of portuguese , with additional vowel reduction ) . 
  portuguese has both nasal motophthongs and diphthongs . 
  you ca n't use the wheel if the terrain does n't allow for it . 
  a wheel in the mountains or in the forest without maintained asphalt roads is practically useless . 
  you 're right about this case , also compare * religi\u00e3o * with * religion * and any other word ending in * - on * . 
  but this is nasalization preceding an / n / , not / \u014b / . 
  apparently / n / was not just merged with vowels in portuguese , but first reduced to a nasalized glide . 
  this also produced diphthongs from intervocalic / n/s - the two adjacent syllables merged . 
  word final , the glide remained there . 
  i had in mind those diphthongs that were created from syllable merging and completely forgot of the * \u00e3o * diphthong . 
  compare * m\u00e3o * / m\u0250\u0303w\u0303 / with * main * / m\u025b\u0303 / from * manus * , and * c\u00e3o * / k\u0250\u0303w\u0303 / with * chien * / \u0283j\u025b\u0303 / from * canis * . 
  try telephone and television . 
  also , we technically have our own word for cds in slovenian , * zgo\u0161\u010denka * , but nobody uses it . 
  silly you , that 's not the right english word . 
  have you never heard of the [ uncleftish beholding ] ( http://anglish.wikia.com/wiki/uncleftish_beholding ) ? 
  part 14 is hide the remaining end of the tie somewhere . 
  simple as that . 
  [ there 's an even better knot for that . 
  ] ( http://1.media.collegehumor.cvcdn.com/45/15/8fa6fe48bcb44d71b71e3fd8f61a2c49.jpg ), 
  well , in slovenian , that construction would n't work , because the literal translation * daljnogled * already means `` telescope '' ... which also made me realize that both `` telescope '' and `` television '' have the same construction . 
  edit : forgot to comment on the icelandic ... * sj\u00f3nvarp * is n't a calque . 
  * sj\u00f3n * means `` sight '' , while * varp * means `` projection '' ( and comes from the verb * varpa * - `` to throw '' or `` to project '' ) . 
  it 's modelled after the word * \u00fatvarp * , which means `` radio '' or `` broadcast '' . 
  * \u00fat * means `` out '' and this word is modelled after the word `` broadcast '' , with the `` cast '' part being analysed with the meaning of `` throw '' . 
  quite comfortable actually . 
  i would n't mind seeing the same confidence in girls as well ... 
  there are no stars hidden ... count them !, 
  i did n't want to place yellow on white . 
  one does n't simply place metal on metal . 
  looks of slavic , \u0434\u0430 ? 
  the brave elderly gentleman started his inspiring speech with `` excuse me '' , so technically , he did apologise . 
  my 13yo cousin does ... 
  i recoloured the current coa of russia . 
  edit : [ version with the coa of polish-lithuanian commonwealth ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4diki8f.png ), 
  [ flag of ljubljana , slovenia ] ( http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/images/s/si-061.gif ) , and its [ often used vertical version ] ( http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/images/s/si-061v.gif ) . 
  not really a major city , but it 's a capital nonetheless . 
  ok , what about :, 
   `` my dad likes to whip my mom , and she enjoys it '', 
   `` it makes me sad that the police might take away my dad for domestic violence '', 
   `` my parents like to drink each other 's piss '', 
   `` it makes me sad that our neighbour looks down on us because of the ammonia stench emanating from their mouth '', 
  or the same could be stated about any other fetish or sexual orientation . 
  are you going to say that this is normal stuff to go into a children 's book , or is it a bit too much ?
