  that 's strange . 
  throat singing is awesome . 
  perhaps you should try tuvan or tibetan throat singing ... ? 
  more like , only 1-2 days per lunar cycle you *** ca n't *** see both in the sky at the same time . 
  ( if you pick the right time to look in the sky , that is ), 
  japanese were considered `` honorary aryans '' . 
  that is , because of their culture and tradition , they were regarded as similar to the germanics , and as such a worthy ally to the nazi germany . 
  ... that 's a bit far-fetched connection , though i see now . 
  but , i pretty much just stopped to comment how much i like it , really . 
  i think that would be better represented by somehow calculating the average distance from the two capitals . 
  but that would complicate it a bit . 
  that 's how doors generally look like from inside . 
  can confirm , managed to break a door with my fist once . 
  it 's not only because of the direction of winds . 
  there are also cold currents flowing towards the equator in the eastern part of all five major oceanic basins ( north and south pacific and atlantic , and indian oceans ) , which means that the water is colder than air , and therefore does n't evaporate as much . 
  this is also the reason why the deserts tend to form on western coasts of continents - think of atacama and namib desert . 
  did you expect a sfw response gif to a comment like that ? 
  to be honest , female birth control also fucks with body chemistry , so it 's not like it 's any different . 
  nothing . 
  i always hated getting meaningless text messages . 
  perhaps that 's why i 'm single ... 
  it almost looks like the legend should say `` ja/non '' . 
  you see , that 's what people want to hear . 
  mindless gossip about stuff they are familiar with . 
  nobody is interested in something as complex as international politics ... and those that are , generally do n't look for their information in mainstream media . 
  which is sad , actually . 
  upvoted for a combination of bravery and relevant username . 
   deserves it !, 
  i daresay he does . 
  many that live deserve death . 
  and some that die deserve life . 
  can you give it to them ? 
  then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement . 
  -- j.r.r. 
  heh , i swallow pills without water too . 
  sometimes they get stuck in my \u0153sophagus for a while though , it 's a funny feeling . 
  i 'm just wondering - how did you alter history so that egypt stays kemetic ? 
  or was the eye of ra preserved as a secular symbol somehow , and egypt just kept strong cultural identity ? 
  or is it a revivalist symbol of some kind ? 
  ... your music is actually lotr inspired ? 
  i noticed some stylistic similarities between some of your pieces and howard shore 's soundtrack , but did n't want to make any hasty assumptions . 
  though , to be honest , if it 's fantasy , it 's most likely at least partially lotr inspired anyway . 
  good job on the music , by the way . 
  you 're one of my favourite youtube-artists . 
  what the fuck did you just fucking say about me , you cetnik kucka ? 
  i 'll have you know i graduated top of my class in the kopnena vojska , and i 've been involved in numerous secret raids on bosnia and herzegovina , and i have over 300 confirmed kebab removals . 
  i am trained in kebab removal and i 'm the top sniper in the entire serbian armed forces . 
  you are nothing to me but just another kebab . 
  i will remove you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth , mark my fucking words . 
  you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the internet ? 
  think again , govno jedno . 
  as we speak i am contacting my secret network of spies across yugoslavia and your being ham radio signals are being trace right now so you better prepare for the storm , turk . 
  the storm that removes out the pathetic little thing you call allah . 
  you 're fucking dead , kurva . 
  i can be anywhere , anytime , and i can kill you in over seven hundred ways , and that 's just with my zastava . 
  not only am i extensively trained in bosnian genocide , but i have access to the entire fast rap arsenal of tupac and i will use it to its full extent to wipe all the turk farm aminal off the face of the continent , picka . 
  if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little `` clever '' comment was about to bring down upon you , maybe you would have held your fucking tongue . 
  but you could n't , you did n't , and now you 're paying the price , you goddamn turk . 
  i will shit kebab all over you and you will drown in it . 
  you 're fucking dead , turk . 
  [ implying ] ( #green - text ), 
  well , to be honest , that emulates how wars were fought in real world quite well ... 
  i 'm not sure if that was the intention , and i have n't played hoi , but ... paradox games tend to be made more for having realistic and engaging mechanics rather than for simply winning the game . 
  so i 'd say it 's possible that it was deliberately made slightly too hard . 
  yeah , i have played ck2 , and eu4 plays similar ... 
  if you 'd compare ck2 and m2 : tw for example , you 'd note that ck2 does n't have the `` battle mode '' . 
  so , all the battles in ck2 are effectively ai-assisted from that point of view . 
  the monarch does n't control the army that fights , because that was physically impossible . 
  but , in time period of hoi3 , technology made this theoretically possible . 
  a genius ruler could effectively control all his troops directly , though this would take far too much time and effort . 
  that 's why it 's ai `` general '' assisted . 
  but that 's just how i see and try to justify it . 
  i wanted to change my gender to what i identify as ; but somehow , they oppress me by not allowing me to identify as a god-emperor , preferred pronouns xer/xes . 
  ~ ~ xer 're ~ ~ this god-emperor of mankind a god-emperor too ? 
  we should start a god-emperor acceptance movement . 
  ~ ~ ( i assumed you use pronouns xer/xes just like i do , i am deeply sorry if that 's not the case ) ~ ~ ( fixed the pronouns to the appropriate full title ), 
   implying sane people with common sense actually buy into this bullshit, 
  i 'm not sure about the situation in yugoslavia , but my father estimates that there was at least one person working for the udba per 100 slovenians in slovenia . 
  which is quite problematic , considering that their identity is still top secret . 
  yeah , it was snowing all day today in slovenia , yesterday it was 15 degrees and sunny . 
  also , we had freezing rain two weeks ago , which caused a lot of damage to our forests . 
  also , about 250k people were cut off electricity , some for a whole week . 
  it was quite extreme . 
  it is possible , but to be honest , it usually does n't look as good as it sounds like on paper ... 
  well , ancient romans actually had numeral names : primus , secundus , tertius , quartus , quintus , sextus , septimus , octavius , nonus and decimus , and the corresponding female names ( ending in - a instead of - us ) as well ... 
  for i moment i thought i was n't even in / r/circlejerk, 
   unicode implements blackletter symbols, 
   doesnt include umlauts and eszett, 
  you had one job, 
  ##  implying, 
  ###  how about now ? 
  sshh , stop crying , start dreaming, 
  * arms ~ ~ impaled ~ ~ dimidiated ; in dexter vert a panther rampant argent , armed , horned , and breathing flames gules ( for styria ) , in sinister argent an eagle displayed azure , armed , beaked , and langued gules ( for carniola ) . 
  i wanted to create a distinct looking heraldic coat of arms design for my country slovenia ( which currently has a non-heraldic [ coat of arms ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/coat_of_arms_of_slovenia.svg/200px-coat_of_arms_of_slovenia.svg.png ) ) . 
  i joined the designs of coats of arms of [ styria ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/steiermark_wappen.svg/200px-steiermark_wappen.svg.png ) and [ carniola ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/carniola_arms.svg/200px-carniola_arms.svg.png ) , the two historical regions that comprise most of modern day slovenia . 
  another reason for using this design is because even though the flag of slovenia currently uses the pan-slavic colours ( in same order as the flag of russia ) , green is considered a national colour of slovenia , and most national team sports uniforms are white-blue-green . 
  conveniently , those are the colours used on the historical coats of arms of styria and carniola . 
  if i were to design a flag for slovenia , i 'd probably use those three colours , and try to incorporate the three-pointed triglav design ( currently on the coat of arms ) . 
  whoops , did i write * impaled * ? 
  my mistake ...
