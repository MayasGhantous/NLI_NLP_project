  also , if previous verse ends up with a stressed syllable , anacrusis is allowed - there can be an extra unstressed syllable at the beginning of the next verse ( but it 's not required so ) . 
  another peculiarity of fornyr\u00f0islag and other germanic verses is that they did n't generally use verse-final rhymes , and alliteration was the main poetic device . 
  now , let 's look at an example : from j.r.r. 
  tolkien 's * legend of sigurd and gu\u00f0r\u00fan * :, 
   of ** old ** was an ** age ** ( 2 ), 
   when ** \u00d3 ** din ** walked ** ( 2 ), 
   by ** wide ** ** wa ** ters ( 3 ), 
   in the ** world 's ** be ** gin ** ning ; ( a1 ), 
   ** light ** footed ** lo ** ki ( 1 ), 
   at his ** left ** was ** run ** ning , ( a1 ), 
   at his ** right ** ** h\u0153 ** nir ( 3 ), 
   ** roamed ** be ** side ** him . 
  this example does n't strictly follow the rule where anacrusis can be placed , but it 's still a good example with modern english . 
  i bolded stressed syllables , and added number of rhythmic pattern in parentheses ( with a for anacrusis ) . 
  so , tl ; dr : ** the rhythmic structure of english language allows rappers to disregard syllable count . 
  epica was n't in guitar hero, 
  ** \u02d0 ** ( a hourglass-shaped letter , somewhat similar to colon ) is an ipa-standard symbol for long vowels . 
  it is written after the vowel to make it longer . 
  i believe that 's where this comes from . 
  technically , it 's pronounced * moh * - skvah . 
  coincidentally , there 's some pretty sick symphonic black metal from israel , so you may be onto something ... 
  [ winterhorde - tenth wave ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw509yjzevw ), 
  pfft , in sorte diaboli was their weakest release , if you ask me . 
  drumming sounds way to mechanic , the symphonic parts are bland and uninspired , and the songs lack cohesion . 
  and vortex will continue making music with borknagar . 
  how many of those dimmu-vortex fanboys even listen to that band ? 
  i remember seeing israeli tourists in bohinj last summer . 
  it was a group of the most stereotypical looking jews you can imagine , down to peyot ( the sidelocks ) and wearing suits . 
  there was about 20 of them . 
  anyway , they went into a restaurant , ordered pizza , and threw a fit when they were n't all served at exactly the same time . 
  you probably have the `` show my flair on this subreddit . 
  it looks like : '' unchecked . 
  i managed to accidentally uncheck that once . 
  you have a flair selected , but it does n't show up .

   nature always proves to be more sensitive than our computer models predict . 
  not really . 
  ipcc coupled circulation models ( ocean-atmosphere ) for the itcz show very wild and intense behaviour , with much heavier rainfall , and stronger contrast between cold and warm currents . 
  looks like the coat of arms has been culturally enriched . 
  i did n't expect it would be posted here either . 
  i mean , i did put some effort into it , but it 's a very specific subject , and it was posted in a subreddit that is n't exactly famous for scholarly discussion ... , 
  derived from the [ coat of arms of denmark ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/national_coat_of_arms_of_denmark.svg/800px-national_coat_of_arms_of_denmark.svg.png ) .

  there must always be 12 pentagons to turn hexagonal grid into a sphere . 
  `` inferno '' comes from latin * infernus * , which is derived from the adjective * inferus * , meaning low . 
  so , * infernus * literally means under ( ground ) . 
  related words : * inferus * in comparative is * inferior * , and related adverb and preposition are * infra * .

  those are n't ordinary bees . 
  do you remember the africanized bee panic ? 
  those bees are n't just africanized , they 're full on african . 
  both studies were published by the same group in kenya , so the elephants are most likely of a closely related , if not same tribe . 
  it 's usually required for a method of communication to be considered language that it has syntax . 
  as long as it 's just a bunch of words with meanings , it 's not language yet . 
  what makes language a language is that it can put those words like blocks together into longer sentences , that are more than just an abstract idea . 
  do n't you know ? 
  flying a flag makes you a disgusting nationalist racist who wants to kill minorities and foreigners . 
  yes , i overgeneralized when i said `` syntax '' . 
  that 's what i had in mind though , just some kind of abstract compositional system . 
  your comment made me think , and i actually went to check on wikipedia on that matter . 
  apparently african bees have higher hive growth and swarming rate , and they are actually more aggressive than european bees . 
  they respond faster , guard greater distance from a hive , and send out up to four times more workers when threatened . 
  but , african bees are also a bit smaller and have smaller hives , so they are n't as dangerous as the hybrid bees , who are more similar to european bees , but retain the aggressive behaviour of african bees .

  the bad shit that happened in concentration camps only happened well after the war has started . 
  the holocaust did n't really start until 1941 , and it did n't really kick off until 1942 , when the nazi were already starting to lose the war . 
  it was a panic response of some kind . 
  before the war , the plan was just to move the jews out of europe , and give them a homeland of some kind - something that the allies actually done after the war , though israel/palestine was not planned as a final destination , the most sound proposal was to move jews to madagascar . 
  most nazis did n't really want to exterminate jews . 
  they just wanted an ethnically homogeneous germany , which of course meant that the jews must eventually go . 
  call it [ saharan dust ] ( http://wyrdscience.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/sahara_dust_plume_nov_1998.jpg ) and you 're forgiven . 
  that 's a separate issue . 
  also , the situation was n't worse just for female kurds , but for all kurds , so it 's a bad comparison . 
  not to mention that `` battle-age men were the primary target '' . 
  not women . 
  to everyone saying that `` those groups are the same '' . 
  if a includes b , it means that every b is also an a , but not that if someone is a , they must also be b. 
  this is the fallacy you 're making .

  and let 's not forget the two georgias , one in the us , and another on the caucasus . 
  slovenia has the six-pointed stars as well on the coat of arms ( and therefore also on the flag ) . 
  six-pointed stars are in no way exclusively jewish . 
  there are more ridiculous countries . 
  try to guess the english names of those countries :, 
  and of these sub-national entities :, 
  edit : there are some more examples i can think of actually :,

  great , now you spoiled it for everyone else who wants to play the game :(,
