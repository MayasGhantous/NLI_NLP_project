  oh , and \u00d6sterreich as well , which would be translated properly as eastrike . 
  this would be perfect if he were eating bacon . 
  east-rike . 
  `` rike '' is an archaic word for the territory ruled by a kingdom ( or a lower feudal entity ) . 
  it is cognate to the german word `` reich '' . 
  the word itself has survived in english only as a part of the word `` bishopric '' , albeit spelled differently - but historically , `` bishoprike '' was an accepted spelling as well . 
  i really like how the koreas use different names in korean for their country . 
  so , for those that do n't grow out of it , it could also be argued that they 're immature and did n't really mature psychologically ? 
  also , taking this wrong is literally the same as `` science dont real only feels '' . 
  stating studies that show something is a part of a scientific debate , even if most people disagree with the findings of said studies . 
  what makes a study false is bad methodology , not the ideological/political correctness of its conclusions . 
  [ danie mellor ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danie_mellor ) considers himself aboriginal australian , even though only his maternal great-great-grandmother and great-grandmother were aboriginal , and he is [ blonde with blue eyes ] ( http://sydney.edu.au/images/content/news/2013/jun/17_danie_mellor.jpg ) .

  what the fuck . 
  are you seriously proposing to use the trainwreck [ gall-peters projection ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/gall%e2%80%93peters_projection_sw.jpg/800px-gall%e2%80%93peters_projection_sw.jpg ) , which fucks up everything , except for surface areas . 
  how well a projection preserves surface areas is in no way a measure of how good a projection is . 
  the most extreme example would be [ snyder 's hourglass-shaped equal-area projection ] ( http://www.progonos.com/furuti/mapproj/dither/projappl/img/z1/mp2_snhourglass-s75.png ) , which was actually invented to demonstrate that . 
  um , he was n't really raised into it . 
  he can at least claim partial heritage though , and he is quite involved with the community . 
   mellor grew up in scotland , australia and south africa, 
   the family was peripatetic : in his first twenty years , mellor lived in mackay , queensland ; scotland ; brisbane , queensland ; sutton grange , victoria ; adelaide , south australia ; and cape town , south africa , as well as in the northern territory . 
  mellor went to school at steiner schools in south australia and south africa ; in high school he was taught art by his mother . 
  both would be correct , but the difference is that '' - ric '' is a suffix , while `` rike '' is an actual noun . 
  so , words ending with '' - ric '' usually denotes a rike of someone/something ; `` bishopric '' , `` kingric '' , `` heavenric '' . 
  because austria is a rike in the east , and not a rike of the east , i think `` eastrike '' would make more sense . 
  `` easterrike '' would make sense grammatically , but does n't work because it is more similar to the word `` easter '' than `` east '' . 
  whoa , i remember this face from some threads on 4chan .

  most studies that try to debunk sex addiction end up setting up such arguments why it does n't real that it could also be said that gaming or gambling addictions do n't real as well .

  the [ schr\u00f6dinger equation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schr%c3%b6dinger_equation ) , which is the equation of motion in quantum mechanics ( equivalent to newton 's second law in classical mechanics ) is a partial differential equation over complex numbers . 
  without using fourier transform and complex functions , quantum mechanics does n't work . 
  the schr\u00f6dinger equation is :, 
  where \u0127 is reduced planck 's constant , \u03a8 is the wave function of the quantum system , and \u0124 is the hamiltonian operator , which calculates the energy of a wave function .

  so brave, 
  ... and i think we have a winner . 
   people enjoy working and being productive members of society . 
  this is not mutually inclusive though . 
  if you lived in the mediterranean , you 'd know what i 'm talking about . 
  in order for such a society to actually work , human psyche would need to change fundamentally . 
  sense of security and welfare will always lead a society into decay and decadence , as it has been evidenced in the past by pretty much every large empire . 
  most empires did n't survive for more than 300 years , exactly because of that . 
  this is a part of human nature , and does n't seem to be era-specific either . 
  if we want to have a sustainable society that will survive the test of time , we should not focus on welfare , but wariness . 
  if people feel too safe , most of them will become lazy slobs , and only a small fraction will actually make something of their lives . 
  some will inevitably exploit the lazy slobs , because they wo n't care - as long as people do n't have anything to lose , as long as they receive welfare , they wo n't bother about it . 
  but there is no way to sustain wariness if there is no competition , and if people feel safe . 
  this sounds quite orwellian , i know , but perhaps the only way to sustain that is by keeping humanity fractioned into small states , and keeping the political situation tense . 
  and this means having states competing for power , not a hegemony of an empire . 
  right now , the problem is that america does n't really have a strong and active competitor . 
  america is in that way a typical example of an empire in decline , having serious problems with immigration , disillusioned yet unenthusiastic population , and corrupt government . 
  the golden age of america , that roughly lasted from the 20s to the 60s , is now long over , and its power is only sustained , not really enforced ever since the dissolution of the soviet union in early 90s . 
  in that way , america is similar to the severan dynasty of rome during the early 3rd century . 
  and while a diocletian may appear and try to fix the situation , it is probably already doomed . 
  but such is the fate of empires . 
  humanity will not fall , even if the empires fall . 
  but humans do n't react to unnatural situations of prosperity very well , even if we can easily adapt to progressing technology . 
  so my opinion would be : ** technological progress does n't lead to progress in society , and we will end up being the same as today , only with blasters and in space .

  what i noticed about makeup is that attractive women look good with or without makeup ( i prefer no makeup though ) , while unattractive women look terrible without makeup and at acceptable , but not attractive , with makeup . 
  the whole `` you do n't even know how a face looks like without makeup '' is total bullshit . 
  i know how face skin without makeup looks like , as men ( usually ) do n't wear makeup . 
  you only need to subtract the beard . 
  also , i would n't say beyonce is attractive . 
  just famous and in shape . 
  but she looks best ( in my opinion ) on the last picture - the one on edit 2 . 
  also , she 's clearly wearing makeup on the photo that is an example of `` no-makeup '' .

  `` blubber is the primary storage location of fat on some mammals . '', 
  `` blubber from whales and seals contains omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin d. without the vitamin d , for example , the inuit and other natives of the arctic would likely suffer from rickets . 
  there is evidence blubber and other fats in the arctic diet also provide the calories needed to replace the lack of carbohydrates found in the diets of cultures in the rest of the world . '', 
  blubber is fatty tissue .
