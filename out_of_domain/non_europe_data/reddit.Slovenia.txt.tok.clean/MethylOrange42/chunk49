  i believe that is indeed hammer on anvil in the beat from 0:24 on , though i 'm not completely sure . 
   the most average looking girls get told they are the most beautiful thing anybodies ever laid eyes on . 
  while models and celebrities are `` meh '', 
  averaging out a face evens out the deviations , so the most average face would be more attractive than most faces actually . 
  also , models and celebrities usually enhance their appearance with professional makeup . 
  this makes them look good , but i think the uncanny valley starts taking effect - they look too perfected to be perfect . 
  while those that are just attractive , but do n't even try to enhance that , actually come over as naturally attractive . 
  i think she does n't need makeup . 
  she 's naturally attractive . 
  i 'm just wondering , if i 'm the only guy who feels the same about body hair . 
  if a woman looks feminine enough in physique , armpit and leg hair would n't bother me at all , but on the average not-so-attractive woman it would look just gross . 
  this kind of beats the purpose of privateering though . 
  * gules , archangel michael or slaying the devil sable . 
  * supporters : two lions or , holding the banners ( i think they are supposed to ? ), 
  showing arms of brabant ( sable , a lion rampant or ) and of the city of brussels itself . 
  base3 balanced might actually be better . 
  the minus sign is not even needed in this system . 
  also , balanced ternary has in-built fuzzy logic ( the zero ) , and the operator not is the same as the minus sign . 
  russians experimented with such ternary computer in the 60s , but it did n't catch on , despite it was just as efficient at lower running cost as the binary computers . 
  the irony is that persians are actually more `` caucasian '' than europeans . 
  persia is closer to the caucasus than europe . 
  the ccr5 protein , which is a receptor in white blood cells , acts as a backdoor which the hiv uses to infect the cell . 
  however , the \u039432 mutation of this protein does n't allow the hiv to enter , so people with the ccr5-\u039432 mutation are naturally resistant . 
  this mutation is most common in northern europe up to 18 % , and practically nonexistent outside of europe and central asia . 
  i personally kind of like the appearance of the coa/seal of wisconsin , so i decided to give it a little twist . 
  the flag is loosely modeled on the [ flag of madison ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/flag_of_madison%2c_wisconsin.svg/900px-flag_of_madison%2c_wisconsin.svg.png ) , with the bend replaced by a w-letter . 
  that 's the point ,

  libya currently does n't have a coat of arms ; and uses the crescent and star as an emblem ( same as turkey ) . 
  since the new government after 2011 adopted the old flag of the kingdom , i guess the old coat of arms could be reinstated as well ...

  a relief depiction of the eagle of saladin , from the cairo citadel . 
  there is no hard evidence confirming it , but because of this relief depiction on the walls of the citadel , which was built by saladin , many assume that it it his symbol . 
  after the egyptian revolution in 1952 , it was adopted as the new coat of arms of egypt . 
  it has since become a pan-arab symbol , being featured in the coats of arms of [ egypt ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/coat_of_arms_of_egypt_%28official%29.svg/500px-coat_of_arms_of_egypt_%28official%29.svg.png ) , [ iraq ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/coat_of_arms_%28emblem%29_of_iraq_2008.svg/500px-coat_of_arms_%28emblem%29_of_iraq_2008.svg.png ) , [ palestine ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/palestine_coa_%28alternative%29.svg/500px-palestine_coa_%28alternative%29.svg.png ) , and historically the [ syria-egypt union ( 1958-1961 ) ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/coat_of_arms_of_united_arab_republic_%28syria_1958-61%2c_egypt_1958-1971%29.svg/500px-coat_of_arms_of_united_arab_republic_%28syria_1958-61%2c_egypt_1958-1971%29.svg.png ) , [ south yemen ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/coat_of_arms_of_south_yemen_%281970-1990%29.svg/500px-coat_of_arms_of_south_yemen_%281970-1990%29.svg.png ) and [ libya ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/coat_of_arms_of_libya-1970.svg/500px-coat_of_arms_of_libya-1970.svg.png ) .

  slovene does . 
  let me decline `` pes '' ( dog ) for you :, 
  singular : pes , psa , psu , psa , psu , psom, 
  ( the case order is nominative , genitive , dative , accusative , locative , instrumental ), 
  i think arabic has dual as well . 
  quenya has quite fun declension , just like finnish , as well , with 8 cases ( nominative , accusative , genitive , instrumental , allative , dative , locative , ablative ) , two distinct plurals ( one general and one for a specific group ) , and a dual . 
  dog is quenya is * huo * , and assuming it is declined the same as * ondo * ( stone ) , because it ends in * - o * , the declination would be :, 
  i 'm not sure how accurate that is , but that 's how much i managed to gather from conjugation tables and general grammatical rules ... 
  there 's so many latin roots in english that this is almost a given though . 
  it 's kind of a rule in english that the basic words use anglo-saxon or french roots , while higher level vocabulary is made of latin roots . 
  also , * myo - * is a prefixial form of the same root as * muscle * , * cardio - * is actually greek ( latin would be * cor * ) , and * inflammation * is a bit too long ... 
  chair , not table . 
   also , magnetic north . 
  compasses point towards north . 
  this is a really stupid argument . 
  magnets have two poles , and one points towards north , and the other towards south . 
  it 's completely arbitrary which way the compass points . 
  pacific-centered map are also better because oceania has way more islands than the atlantic . 
  so splitting the map that way makes more sense . 
  the saladin 's eagle is most likely unrelated to the roman one . 
  though , the roman eagle is related to all the imperial eagles used in europe . 
  the byzantines inherited the eagle directly , then added a second head at some point in the 10th or 11th century . 
  then , friedrich barbarossa , the holy roman emperor , started using the eagle as an imperial symbol in 12th century . 
  friedrich ii added a second head to the german imperial eagle as well . 
  after the fall of constantinople , the russians kind of inherited the claim on the eastern empire , and incorporated the two-headed eagle in their heraldry as well . 
  serbia also adopted byzantine symbolism by that point . 
  napoleon originally wanted to use the lion as an imperial symbol , but eventually settled on an eagle in a design directly inspired by the roman one . 
  the nazi eagle was just a stylistically `` modernised '' version of the older german imperial eagle . 
  the current state coat of arms that are directly derived from the roman imperial eagle are : [ austria ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/austria_bundesadler_2.svg/500px-austria_bundesadler_2.svg.png ) , [ germany ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/coat_of_arms_of_germany.svg/500px-coat_of_arms_of_germany.svg.png ) , [ montenegro ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/coat_of_arms_of_montenegro.svg/500px-coat_of_arms_of_montenegro.svg.png ) , [ russia ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/coat_of_arms_of_the_russian_federation.svg/500px-coat_of_arms_of_the_russian_federation.svg.png ) and [ serbia ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/coat_of_arms_of_serbia.svg/500px-coat_of_arms_of_serbia.svg.png ) . 
  southern cross points almost directly towards the south pole , so this is arbitrary again . 
  mathematically , it does ... 
  latitude is mapped directly , and longitude is scaled by the cosine of latitude ( so the east-west distances are preserved ) . 
  this is actually the simplest way to map a sphere and preserve the surface area ... it completely screws up the shapes though . 
  it goes to show equal-area projections are generally terrilbe ( i 'm looking at you , gall-peters ) . 
  i 'm disappointed by the lack of glagolitic . 
  hehe , typical seal-on-a-bedsheet . 
  i concur ; my williams have been sursurrated . 
  this has also left traces in the development of some european languages . 
  the slovenian word for a child , `` otrok '' , means slave in czech . 
  conversely , the slovenian word for a servant , `` hlapec '' , means boy in czech ( `` chlapec '' - pronounced the same ) . 
  i would prefer a tiger , and i 'm not even zoophile . 
  this makes them false friends , but true cognates . 
  true friends ( i believe ) have a meaning that is at least perceived as similar . 
  i do n't know . 
  wikipedia considers shared etymology and subsequent semantic drift as a process that generates false friends , though . 
  so i guess it does n't matter if they 're etymologically related or not . 
  edit : also , the sub specifically list this as an example in the rules :, 
   [ ff ] ` kwiecie\u0144 ' in polish refers to the month of april , while ` kv\u011bten ' in czech refers to the month of may . 
  which is a case of semantic drift as well . 
  i know of four more czech-slovene false friends ( words in two languages that sound the same , but have different meanings ) :, 
  * cz : ` kadit ' - to poop / svn : ` kaditi ' - to smoke, 
  * cz : ` st\u016fl ' - table / svn : ` stol ' - chair, 
  * cz : ` foukat ' - to blow / svn : ` fukati ' - to fuck,
