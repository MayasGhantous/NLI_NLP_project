  i 'd fuck op , you 're a fine girl , post more . 
  not to mention the [ varien 's skrillex orchestral suite ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryr9a8-nl0q ) . 
  the same is true for strawberries . 
  fun fact : scientific name of the garden strawberry is * fragaria x ananassa * . 
  and there is a strawberry cultivar called pineberry , which is white in colour and has slight pineapple flavour . 
  this was on / fa / at first ; the girl was genuinely asking what to wear to look better . 
  she was under impression that she needs to wear skin tight clothing , otherwise her boobs would n't be visible enough . 
  everybody told her to lose weight first and then think of what to wear . 
  apparently someone just took the picture and posted it to / fit / . 
  op is a faggot , but he 's a cool faggot , like freddie mercury . 
  edit : typo, 
  well , they know how to save energy . 
  the greenest country in the world . 
  since i 'm from slovenia , have our version of this joke ... 
  slovenian bureaucracy : you have 2 cows . 
  you have n't managed to obtain the permission to milk them , because you 've been waiting for response from officials for two years , but now they 've gone on strike . 
  instead , the state realizes that you have cows , immediately taxes you for them , and starts milking you for money , so you no longer know why you decided to have cows . 
  if you want to go archaic , it should be ye olde theatre . 
  get your facts straight . 
  probably not , 745 = 5 * 149 and 149 is a prime . 
  so that would be one long puzzle . 
  i assumed that , even though they are evil , they are not that evil . 
  nope . 
  all the words ending in - re in uk and - er in us are from french , where they 're spelled with - re : th\u00e9\u00e2tre , centre , etc. 
  one , i 'm 18 . 
  yes , the op noticed it soon after posting . 
  he is just `` the mouth of sauron '' , for `` his name is remembered in no tale , for he himself had forgotten it . '', 
  in the middle-earth role playing game , however , his name is given as urzahil , but that is non-canon . 
  ** tesseract ** - [ nascent ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grwmutro180 ) - djent . 
  i 've managed to convince my brother ( 4 at that time ) that he has 6 toes on his feet . 
  i just touched all his 5 toes while counting to 6 , and he believed me . 
  the next day he was asking mom why he has 6 toes , while other people have only 5 . 
  i always type nigger in such situation . 
  and it actually works , because the `` impossibru word '' is always something that ca n't be ocr 'd , so they need a human to do it . 
  my first try generated peregrin t\u00fbk . 
  the last scene in the music video for [ fjara ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmgdsohbx8e ) ( by s\u00f3lstafir , icelandic post-metal band ) was shot here . 
  the waterfall comes in at 5 minutes mark . 
  fascinating place . 
  i 'd love to visit iceland some time in the future ... 
  because you do n't want to have countries named like * ` brug rgyal-khab * ( bhutan , already with strange name ) or * dawlat al-\u02beim\u0101r\u0101t al-\u02bfarabiyyah al-mutta\u1e25idah * ( united arab emirates ) . 
  now that would be confusing . 
  fun trivia : armenia and georgia are named * hayastan * and * sakartvelo * respectively in local languages . 
  you need to click lower , because there are two links stacked one on top of the other . 
  gimli 's beard works for sure ; that 's where i click . 
  estonia should of try [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dbqejg1.png ) . 
  this is great . 
  just one suggestion : replace the dropdown menu with checkboxes , so that it 's possible to pick preferred combinations of subreddits and/or tags . 
  and there are some subreddits that could be added : / r/republicofmusic , / r/worldmusic , / r/spacemusic , / r/progrockmusic , / r/progmetal , / r/folkmetal , / r/symphonicmetal , / r/epicmetal , / r/djent . . ( to name those i 'm subscribed to that are not included ) . 
  hydrogen sulfide is pure h2s ( as a gas at normal temperature and pressure ) , while hydrosulfuric acid is what you get if you dissolve h2s in water . 
   shrek iis love shrek is love, 
  op faggot status : confirmed . 
  ** x japan ** - [ art of life ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp8l-nw3hne ) - live . 
  half an hour of epic symphonic metal , including the ridiculously long ~ 12 minute piano solo ( which is better than in studio version imho ) . 
  do n't mess with him ; he shed blood of 4000 saxon men !, 
  `` realistic power metal '', 
  `` cute death metal '', 
  okay , i give up . 
  i personally think this is a great idea . 
  however , most guys probably do n't think so . 
  i mentioned this once to a good friend of mine , and he want bat shit crazy ; saying that i am crazy to even think of doing it , because masturbation is natural and all this stuff . 
  also , i guess i am lucky that i did n't watch porn when i was younger . 
  everyone seems talking about porn addiction , and i ca n't even watch it without going wtf . 
  this is genius . 
  best songwriting since freddie mercury . 
  byzantineball would of better than russia . 
  you 're not alone , 
  there is just one more thing i noticed . 
  the character encoding does n't seem to work to me ; the non-standard letters appear as two characters , making it impossible to search for some songs . 
  otherwise , kudos to you for keeping this up !, 
  / r/greentext, 
  almost all my pants have cargo pockets . 
  it 's hard to find decent looking ( well fitting , not baggy ) cargo pants , but it 's worth it . 
  i never need to worry where to place my stuff . 
  wallet and notebook go into my left cargo pocket , phone and various stuff i need to carry around into right cargo pocket , and the keys into front right pocket . 
  back pockets are not really useful imo because of the placement . 
  op is a fag  you chewed up, 
  seems legit, 
  lmao he 's estimatingg, 
  gimli taking balin 's axe is something that is n't mentioned in the books . 
  but , it is written that balin , during his short rule over moria , found durin 's axe , which is one of the oldest weapons in middle-earth ( it was forged by durin the deathless , first king of the oldest clan of dwarves , the longbeards , during the first age ) . 
  so , assuming that this remains the same in the movies , the axe that gimli wields is a long lost ancient heirloom of his clan . 
  ** zaria ** - [ boj ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvzlleb5amu ) - slovenian folk metal . 
  pretty new band , so there is not much to post . 
  it should be noted , however , that narsil was dwarven-forged ; by telchar of nogrod . 
  and he forged not only the sword that cut of sauron 's finger , but also the knife angrist that beren used to cut the first silmaril out of melkor 's crown . 
  this shows that dwarven smiths were , at least in the first age , on par with elven smiths . 
  ... did you actually take time to try it , or did / v / ( or / b / ) find it out and you 're just passing the info ? 
  since dwarves were created by aul\u00eb , it can be assumed that dwarves were at least as good at smithing as the elves . 
  and e\u00f6l , the dark elf , was the best smith because he learned a lot from the dwarves . 
  however , the \u00d1oldorin smiths were taught their skills by aul\u00eb himself . 
  i do n't . 
  if i shower regularly , nobody seems to notice , but so far everyone was grossed out whenever i mentioned that i do n't . 
  ** 4th dimension ** - [ angel 's call ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=purr3pvvtfm ) , power metal band from italy . 
  they supported sonata arctica for the first part of their european tour of 2011 . 
  ` cuz it was in middle of nowhere with no bench around , duh .
