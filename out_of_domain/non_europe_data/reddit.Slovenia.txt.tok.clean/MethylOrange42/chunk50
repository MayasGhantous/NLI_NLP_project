  the ` st\u016fl ' / ` stol ' one is a result of a semantic drift as well , where the meaning of a word shifts for some reason ( in this case , probably because of influence of german stuhl on the slovene word ) . 
  another example of a semantic swap , where words completely swap their meaning i can think of are colours in albanian :, 
  * the word for green , ` gjelb\u00ebr ' , comes from latin * galbinus * , which comes from proto-indo-european * \u01f5\u02b0elh \u2083 wos * , meaning yellow ( which makes it cognate to yellow in english and gelb in german ) . 
  * the word for yellow , ` verdh\u00eb ' , comes from latin * viridis * , meaning green ( which makes it cognate to verde in italian and vert in french ) . 
  this is mother lewis for you , marty !, 
  it 's not only one font . 
  # 2 and # 9 have different shapes for g , and # 1 and # 5 have a script a instead . 
  and the good old casual `` you should eat more '' in facebook comments under profile picture . 
  nah , those two pairs kind of belong together . 
  i think we could include one more category : phono-semantic matching [ psm ] ; fitting a foreign word into a language by matching it to a pre-existing word root . 
  ( edit : or do they count as internal false cognates ? ), 
  ogres are like leeks . 
  they are green . 
  the original quote was actually '' * qui desiderat pacem , pr\u00e6paret bellum . 
  na\u00efvet\u00e9 is the word you 're looking for . 
  chinese does this a lot - practically all loanwords are absorbed into chinese in that way . 
  icelandic , which likes to create neologisms , has ` t\u00e6kni ' for technology , which is a borrowing from danish ` teknik ' , but is semantically matched with the word ` t\u00e6ki ' , which means tool . 
  another example is turkish ` okul ' for school . 
  it is based on french ' \u00e9cole ' , but uses the root ` oku - ' , which is used for reading . 
  the construction ` oku-l ' itself , however , does n't make sense semantically . 
  sounds reasonable . 
  though , i always found it interesting how languages can bend words so they look like they are n't loans at all . 
  it 's a space opera , which is a subgenre of science fiction . 
  also , the main difference between hard and soft science fiction is that the hard science fiction focuses on hard science ( astrophysics , chemistry , neuroscience etc. 
  ) , while soft science fiction focuses on soft science ( economy , sociology , biology , anthropology etc. ) . 
  star wars is a soft science fiction . 
  just because it does n't focus on technology , but society , it does n't disqualify it from being science fiction . 
  blazon : ( thankfully , it 's on wikipedia ; blazoning this would take a while ), 
  * azure , an eagle displayed or beaked and taloned gules , in its beak , an orthodox cross or and holding in its dexter talon a sword argent ; and in a sinister talon a mace argent . 
  an escutcheon quarterly : ( 1 ) ; azure , an eagle displayed or , beaked and taloned gules , holding in its beak an orthodox cross or , between in dexter chief a sun in splendour and in sinister chief an increscent , both or ( wallachia ) ; ( 2 ) ; gules , a bull 's head caboshed argent , between in dexter base a rose and in sinister base a decrescent , both argent , between the bull 's horns , a mullet of five points or ( moldavia ) ; ( 3 ) ; gules , issuant from water in base proper , a lion rampant or , holding in its dexter paw a sabre argent , hilted or , behind a bridge of two arches embattled or , masoned sable ( oltenia ) and ( banat ) ; ( 4 ) ; per fess azure , a demi-eagle argent between in dexter chief a sun in splendour or and in sinister chief a decrescent argent , and or , seven castles gules , a barrulet gules ( transylvania ) ; ( 5 ) entree en point ; two dolphins urinant respectant or ( dobrogea ) . 
  the coat of arms is a quartering of the coats of arms of historical regions of romania :, 
  * golden eagle - wallachia, 
  * lion and a bridge - oltenia and banat, 
  * a black eagle , seven castles , a sun and a moon - transylvania, 
  the current version , adopted on 10 september 1992 to replace the [ communist one ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/coat_of_arms_of_the_socialist_republic_of_romania.svg/1000px-coat_of_arms_of_the_socialist_republic_of_romania.svg.png ) is based on an older [ royal coat of arms of kingdom of romania ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/kingdom_of_romania_-_big_coa.svg/1000px-kingdom_of_romania_-_big_coa.svg.png ) , used 1922-1947 . 
  also , * wetter * in frisian is `` water '' . 
  middle english for `` squirrel '' was * aquerne * . 
  so , if the word had n't been lost and replaced by the french one during development of modern english , squirrel would probably be called ** acquirn * ( compare * aqueren *  * acquire * ), 
  * grad * is croatian for `` city '' , while * grad * is slovenian for `` castle '' . 
  * burg ( h ) * is english for `` city '' , while * burg * is german for `` castle '', 
  it 's quite a common false friend pair because of semantic drift , actually . 
  note the russian registration plates . 
  the roads of russia are well known for regular road carnage . 
  it 's a true cognate . 
  i 'm quite sure this goes both ways ... 
  the flag was adopted on 28 december 2013 . 
  [ the previous one was the equally terrible coat of arms on a blue bedsheet . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/former_flag_of_coquimbo_region%2c_chile.svg/900px-former_flag_of_coquimbo_region%2c_chile.svg.png ), 
  it just takes a little bit of pronunciation practice . 
  native pronunciation of english is quite peculiar . 
  some sounds are pronounced half-mumbled , and native speakers of other languages tend to pronounce those sounds either too clearly , or they reduce them in a wrong way . 
  of course , most people just do n't bother with their pronunciation that much . 
  thanks . 
  i 'm trying to raise the standards a bit . 
   not knowing that the sine is linear translation of a cosine, 
  nope , * aquerne * and * acquire * are false cognates . 
  * aquerne * is a germanic word ( shared by other germanic languages ) , while * acquire * is a french word ( from latin * ad - * + * quaero * ) and is therefore cognate to english words * query * , * quest * and * question * . 
  but your explanation could be taken as a folk etymology - which could affect the further development of a language . 
  * aquer **** en *** is to acquire , and * aquer **** ne *** is a squirrel . 
  i was just making a connection between those two words because they 'd develop the same way into modern english . 
  / r/anglish, 
  truly , this has indeed been forsought before . 
  it 's not a fresh ettling . 
  also , log that all the words that i wrote are indeed of germanic stem . 
  : i lost it at `` jo homes '' . 
  connecting east and west africa through the sudan while adding [ kanem empire ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kanem_empire ) might be a good idea . 
  forgive me , but `` ettling '' is english . 
  also , i rightened the last wordset . 
  here , have some more :, 
  \u00eb\u00ef\u1e8d\u1e27\u1e85\u1e97, 
   this is kind of misleading because he 's saying that because it 's small , it must therefore have very little mass . 
  of course , that 's a logical conclusion . 
  volume is related to the third power of volume , while density varies roughly between 500 and 5000 kg/m ^ 3 for all objects ( and it could n't even theoretically go much higher than 10000 ) . 
  so , if you assume two objects to be at extremes of density , one very dense and another very diffuse , and of same mass , the denser one would be only a little bit less than half the diameter of the bigger one . 
  unless it 's made of degenerate matter like white dwarfs or neutron stars , that is . 
  but that 's a completely different story , and if it were , we 'd know it . 
  because my first language ( slovene ) has dual , i get a bit confused every time i hear this joke , 
  this should suffice , i guess . 
  i will add references directly next time . 
  i guess it 's a word currently undergoing a semantic drift . 
  while the old meaning is still somewhat retained , it is falling into disuse , because people are using the word in its changed meaning most of the time , and more and more often , it seems . 
  it was n't popular back in the 1st century , and it was n't a book back then either . 
  you 're literally citing a practice of an obscure cult as an example of how people wore their hair back then . 
  is she trans-canadian , or why does she apologise so much ? 
  sure , it would be better to have neither . 
  but outlawing and persecuting one side extremists only is even worse than such an equilibrium . 
  romans did cut their hair short , that is true . 
  but most greeks and gauls grew their hair to a mid-length ( spartans several centuries before grew their hair long ) , and persians still wore the traditional long hair and braided beards . 
  so it 's a regional thing , and it was only as common as you 're implying in romans . 
   nobody is complaining about traditional hunting, 
  i know this is another thing , but every year when they have the traditional whale hunt grindadr\u00e1p in the faroes , various organizations try to create a massive outrage , complete with shocking pictures of red bay water where they slay the whales . 
  and it 's a long tradition , going back to the 17th century , with a steady catch of 500-1000 whales every year , sometimes a bit less , while the full north atlantic population of the hunted pilot whales is about 1 million . 
  so , it is definitely not true that people do n't complain about traditional hunting . 
  the ethnonym is slovene , slovenia is a land of slovenes , and things related to slovenia are slovenian . 
  the name of the country comes from the name of people , and not vice versa . 
  it 's a regular occurrence , so i ca n't say it 's a contemporary thing , yes . 
  also , outside of africa , there are almost no cultures ( that i 'm aware of ) where women cut their hair short . 
  but , hair ( and beard ) length in men , however , varies from culture to culture , so you ca n't really make a strong correlation as you can with woman hairstyles . 
  apparently my brain automatically assumes that if plural is used , it means more than just two . 
  even if it 's a sentence a language that does n't have dual .
