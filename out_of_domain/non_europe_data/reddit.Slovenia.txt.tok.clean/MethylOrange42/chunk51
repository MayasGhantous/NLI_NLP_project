  also , the plurals for masculine grammatical gender in slovene end in * - i * , just like latin . 
  so i guess this kind of amplifies the effect . 
  i 'd love to see other people doing the same , adding at least some further explanation ... it 's possible to find quite a lot of info about cognates and etymology just by searching a bit though wiktionary . 
  you just need to know what you 're looking for . 
  it does n't have to be as elaborate , just enough info to give some further insight . 
  he stated in the thread that his hand is unfortunately too blunt for maximum penetration . 
  well , if * deus * came directly from greek , it would probably be prononced with a / t / , * teus * . 
  the change from unvoiced aspirate / t\u02b0 / directly to voiced / d / is highly unlikely . 
  i do n't really miss it , because it 's mostly used in situations where the number is already clear from context . 
  by the way , for things that come in pairs naturally , slovene uses plural instead of dual - `` parents '' * star\u0161i * instead of * star\u0161a * , `` legs '' * noge * instead of * nogi * , etc. 
  though it 's useful in some context , where it helps reduce ambiguity . 
  the one thing that i actually miss - and i do n't even speak any language that has it - is the distinction between inclusive and exclusive plural . 
  the winner was the [ pale blue dot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ky6vu.png ) flag ( / u/rolls20s ) - a very iconic photo , but i personally think that it does n't translate on a flag that well ... 
  i like the [ tree of life ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7nauf.png ) flag ( / u/bezbojnicul ) from that contest as well . 
  a flag in itself is not a symmetrical object , because the hoist and the fly behave differently . 
  when the flag is flying , the fly side should hang or blow in the wind anyway . 
  so , it does n't really make sense to keep vertical symmetry - you gain nothing by it . 
  it does n't , really . 
  it mentions only ** personal ** coats of arms , and only says that canadians can design a coat of arms for their ** family ** . 
  it 's also important to note that only british heraldry does n't know family coat of arms . 
  while canadian heraldry is descended from british heraldry , claiming that family coats of arms do n't exist is just as false as people claiming they know your family arms ( or , even worse , crests !, 
  coats of arms are more than just painted shields as well . 
  but i still think it 's important to consider what is the default medium for presenting a symbol . 
  and , in the case of flags , that is indeed a piece of cloth . 
  the french did originally use cadency , but it fell out of practice by the 17th century . 
  the napoleonic heraldic system introduced direct inheritance of arms to all sons . 
   the decree of march 3 , 1810 ( art . 
  11 ) states : `` the name , arms and livery shall pass from the father to all sons '', 
  there are no sources i can find on cadency marks in german heraldry , but since it is explicitly stated that different ** family branches ** differentiate their arms by using different crests and same shield , i assume this means that the coats of arms indeed did belong to a family . 
  the spanish heraldry uses quartering a lot , and the coat of arms is inherited by both sides . 
  this means that individuals have quartered coats of arms that are unique , but are composed of family coats of arms . 
  polish heraldry is even more different . 
  here , the coats of arms are not only shared between individuals of the same family , but by a whole ** clan ** . 
  there were only about 200 different coats of arms in whole poland . 
  using marks of cadence is also discouraged outside the countries that require it ( england , scotland , canada , south africa ) : http://www.internationalheraldicregistry.com/cadency.html, 
  so , while coats of arms are not tied to a surname as some would naively believe , they were usually directly inherited and therefore shared by a family in most heraldic traditions . 
  the problem is that you 'll end up with small quantities of uranium-232 present , which makes such weapons highly unstable . 
  nobody wants a nuke that may or may not blow up randomly . 
  both , and i should probably include canadian heraldry as well . 
  ah , thanks for clearing it up . 
  han solo actually manages to pass this test ? 
  well done . 
  if you mean the [ grand union ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grand_union_flag ) / [ east india company ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east_india_company ) flag , then i think that might be the best idea . 
  [ this one ? 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/union_flag_1606_%28kings_colors%29.svg/1000px-union_flag_1606_%28kings_colors%29.svg.png ), 
  the saudi flag , when hoisted vertically ( which is rarely ) rotates the shahadah . 
  also , while not national flags , [ slovenian municipal flags ] ( http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/si-munic.html ) are usually hoisted vertically , but some are also hoisted horizontally . 
  the coat of arms is rotated accordingly .

  i really like how 5 of 8 slovakian regional flags are divided crosswise , but with the hoist side shorter than the fly side , similar to the nordic crosses .

  i tried to blazon the arms ; this is the first time i 'm blazoning a bit more complex arms , so it may be a bit clumsy and with some mistakes ... 
  all those comments bashing the shading on the swords ... while it is unnecessary , i think adding shading to charges as artistic style does n't hurt a flag really . 
  it 's only a problem when shading is actually a part of flag design . 
  it is slightly off-putting though that the swords are of different shades of grey . 
  the colour scheme is a bit off on some , that 's true . 
  ( i 'm looking at you , nitra ! ), 
  but as a general idea of how to partition a flag , i like it . 
  simple , yet different from everything else . 
  the colours more or less correspond to the colours used on the coats of arms ; and those are based on historical coats of arms of regions and/or cities . 
  shrek, 
  the horde will rise again !, 
  quite a lot of them play folk metal though , preferably of the nordic kind . 
  the fact that vikings are cool lets them sing in their own language ... 
  ouch . 
  well , i know a girl named nyasha ... and it 's actually a traditional shona name . 
  not some fake ebonics shit . 
  needs more stripes . 
  this reminds me of [ the tale of sir bearington . 
  europa has a drastically different structure than enceladus . 
  if you compare the densities :, 
  in general , the further from sun you go , the sparser the material gets . 
  mercury is the closest to the sun and has a large metallic core , mars is already much less dense than earth , and the trend continues in the outer solar system . 
  ( jupiter has a similar trend inside its moon system , where io and europa are denser than ganymede and callisto ) . 
  this is because more volatile material was pushed to the outside regions of solar system during formation , leaving denser materials closer to the sun . 
  jupiter probably had a similar effect on its moons , as it probably generated a lot of heat through gravitational contraction and accretion during the early stages of formation . 
  this means that while europa has a similar structure to earth 's moon and mars , with a rocky crust and mantle and a small metallic core ( compared to earth ) . 
  enceladus was formed from material with much less heavier materials and much more ices ( water , ammonia , methane - which are in general more abundant in space than rocks or metals ) . 
  this means that it has , in theory , an icy , not rocky crust and mantle , and a rocky core , with only traces of metals . 
  what this study shows is that at least a part of its icy mantle is molten , similar to how earth 's asthenosphere ( upper mantle ) is ductile - partially molten , if you wish , even if that 's not a correct way to describe its state . 
  those elements mentioned that are crucial for life are not so much part of the rocky matter in accretion models , but of the icy matter . 
  earth does n't have much phosphorus or sulfur in its crust , so probably europa does n't either . 
  but , since they 're heavier than ices , those materials would mostly sink down into the rocky core . 
  probably not so much the gravitational effect of saturn on the moon , because it 's tidally locked ( just like our moon ) , than the gravitational effect of other moons , which change their location relative to enceladus as they orbit the planet . 
  especially larger dione , with which it is locked in resonance - it orbits saturn in exactly half the time it takes dione . 
  enceladus is small and has a weak gravitational field ( g = 0.114 m/s \u00b2 , about one percent of earth 's ) , so those forces are relatively large . 
  its close orbit also means that those forces change quite fast ; it makes one full circle in 32.9 hours . 
  there 's also a lot of tholins in higher regions of its atmosphere . 
  they give titan the distinct orange haze . 
  tholins are organic polymers that are formed by solar radiation in titan 's atmosphere . 
  there may be some quite complex polymers in that haze ... 
  chasing the twilight sounds problematic ... but i guess it would be possible to find some craters near poles that receive constant sunshine at low angle ( mercury 's axial tilt is about 2 arcminutes ) , and just dig yourself in the ground . 
  that 's another theory . 
  we will probably need to wait for more data on exoplanets before we decide which one is most plausible . 
  you can measure how much objects weigh by throwing stuff at them and observing the orbits . 
  if they bend more , it means the object is more massive . 
  in our case , we sent some probes to saturn and jupiter . 
  then , you can also measure how much the moons perturb each other in their orbit , again giving a clue on their relative mass .
