  or observe asteroids flying by , if you are lucky . 
  if you know the density , you can also speculate on the composition , because there are only a few possible building blocks : ices ( methane , ammonia , water ) , rocks ( mostly silicates ) , and metals ( mostly iron and nickel ) . 
  surface composition can be deduced just by looking at it in different wavelengths . 
  then , you can run computer models . 
  if they give results that are comparable to what we see , they 're probably correct . 
  of course , most of it is just speculation . 
  the only thing we can measure with certainty is time , about everything else we can just say that it seems to be so . 
  i 'd rather say snow down ; they should be solid . 
  from saturn , and the other moons , yes . 
  it 's not a lone case , though . 
  the volcanism on io is fueled by tidal heating as well . 
  but , io is a rocky world unlike enceladus and more similar to earth 's moon , so it does n't result in molten undersurface ocean and active geysers , but actual volcanism . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/io_ ( moon ) #tidal _ heating, 
  it does , actually . 
  jupiter most probably has a rocky core , more than ten times the mass of earth ( it 's hard to determine how large it actually is ) . 
  hydrogen and helium are the most common elements in the universe , much more abundant than any other element . 
  but , most planets were simply not massive enough to accrete hydrogen and helium from the primordial nebula . 
  so while jupiter has a lot of dense material , it also has much more gas , that its moons simply could n't accrete . 
  i was thinking sparse as in not dense . 
  even if there 's still enough rock in outer regions of solar system , there 's also much more ices , so the material is n't as dense in general . 
  too bad ck2 ca n't handle lineage from bce . 
  the founder of parthian arsacid dynasty ( ar\u0161ak / arsaces i ) was alegedly a descendant of artax\u0161a\u00e7a / artaxerxes ii of achaemenid dynasty , so the lineage would go back to haxamani\u0161 / achaemenes who ruled 705-675 bc . 
  [ it would perhaps be possible to connect the genealogy to ri ` misisu/ramesses ii ] ( http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/c/l/a/christopher-a-clark-/odt9-0001.html ) , effectively arriving at dead end in 14th century bc with ramesses 's great-grandfather [ seti ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seti_ ( commander ) ) . 
  gravity on surface can be calculated as : g = gm/r \u00b2 , where m is mass , r is radius , and g is gravitational constant ( 6.67 * 10 \u207b\u00b9\u00b9 nm \u00b2 / kg \u00b2 ) . 
  since higher density also means more mass , yes , density does affect its gravity , which is directly proportional to density . 
  mass is also directly proportional to volume , which is proportional to cube of radius . 
  if you divide this by the square of the radius in the denominator , you can see that gravity on surface is also directly proportional to the radius . 
  enceladus is roughly half the density of moon , but only a bit more than one fourth of moon 's radius . 
  this means that gravity on enceladus is roughly only one eighth of gravity on moon ; roughly just as much as gravity on moon differs from gravity on earth !, 
  ( i used very rough estimates , as it is commonly done in astronomy . ), 
  not really . 
  there are no external forces strong enough to counter the moon 's gravitational field , even though it seems quite weak , compared to earth 's . 
  even some asteroids have gravitational field strong enough to keep smaller asteroids in orbit . 
  also , one of the most basic concepts in physics is the concept of a potential energy . 
  all objects tend to conform into a state with lower potential energy . 
  it would still take some energy to launch that water into space , so this can not happen on its own . 
  they have even recently managed to connect the two branches ( mukhraneli and gruzinsky ) . 
  it looks like [ the heir ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/giorgi_bagration_bagrationi ) is going to receive a strong claim on the throne of georgia ... 
  gas giants technically do n't have a surface ; atmosphere just gets denser and denser . 
  gasses at supercritical pressures do n't have a sharp transition to fluid phase . 
  the accepted definition of a `` surface '' of a gas planet is the height at which pressure is 1 atmosphere . 
  the joke 's on them ; nobody needed to forbid me from dating !, 
   imaginary being, 
  that 's a funny term for a mythical person . 
  quite a brave one , actually . 
  if i remember correctly , the context was that some pole was arguing that polish people are masterrace , as evidenced by the fact that their language is too complex for an ordinary human to learn . 
  languages are colourcoded by difficulty , showing that italian , spanish and english are literally the languages of idiots .

  most of earth 's co \u2082 is bound in the carbonates ( such as limestone ) . 
  when co \u2082 dissolves in water , it forms co \u2083 \u00b2 \u207b anions , which react with several metal cations to form insoluble carbonate minerals , such as limestone or dolomite . 
  when you heat carbonate minerals , the co \u2082 is released , and carbonates turn into oxides ( for example , limestone caco \u2083 turns into lime cao , releasing the co \u2082 in air ) . 
  since venus has no surface water , but is geologically active ( though not as much as earth ) , it can not reabsorb co \u2082 into the crust as limestone , while it can release it into the atmosphere from mineral deposits . 
  earth has massive amounts of co \u2082 bound in limestone , while pretty much all of venus 's limestone is in its atmosphere . 
  regarding the atmospheric composition ; the oxygen in earth 's atmosphere is of biological origin . 
  the primordial atmosphere of earth had no or very little oxygen .

  read the explanation , that 's exactly what i wrote . 
  venus has two big problems for terraforming , though . 
  one is extremely long rotational period , which means that one day on venus is 116.75 earth days long . 
  not very nice , because it would cause extreme temperature variation . 
  another problem ( which is probably linked to the first one ) is absence of an intrinsic magnetic field . 
  high energy solar wind can reach the atmosphere of venus , eroding it . 
  low mass ions and molecules , especially hydrogen , but also water , are therefore prone to evaporate into space much faster than on earth . 
  venus has 150 times as much deuterium compared to regular hydrogen as earth does !, 
  you mentioned that volcanism would need to be countered - actually , venus is currently much less volcanically active than earth on average . 
  though , i still find venus to be potentially more hospitable than mars . 
  i do n't know how much energy there is in earth 's magnetic field - but i can try to estimate how much energy it would take to cover earth with a field of similar strength . 
  if you take constant magnetic field strength of 50 \u03bc\u0422 , earth 's surface area 500 million km \u00b2 , and the height to cover 200 km , then by using equation e = 1/2 b \u00b2 / \u03bc \u2080 * v ; the energy required is 5 * 10 \u00b9\u2078 j ; about one third of yearly us production of electrical energy , and the relativistic energy equivalent of 50 kg of matter . 
  and only the surface is effectively covered !, 
  if you use 10 times the volume of earth in the calculation ( reasonable amount ) , the result is 10 \u00b2\u00b9 j or about 10 tons of relativistic mass-energy . 
  wikipedia says they were granted in 1969 , but the black swan as a symbol has been used much earlier . 
  the state badge is a black swan on a golden disk , used since 1870 ( also seen on [ the flag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/flag_of_western_australia.svg/1800px-flag_of_western_australia.svg.png ) ) , so i guess the wreath is or and sable because those are historical colours of the state .

   simple divisions of the field are considered to be beside each other , not one on top of the other ; so the rule of tincture does not apply . 
  eh , make it a non-traditional tincture then - turquoise , just like celeste , tenn\u00e9 , orange , cendr\u00e9e , or copper . 
  though i agree coats of arms should n't use too many different colours .

  there is a second pretender to the throne ( the bagrationi dynasty having split in the early 16th century into three branches ) , davit bagration-mukhraneli , who was married to nugzar 's daughter anna bagration-gruzinsky ( they divorced in december ) , with whom he has a son giorgi bagrationi ( born 2011 ) - who could potentially unite both claims to the throne ; though nugzar currently refuses to acknowledge him as a successor .
