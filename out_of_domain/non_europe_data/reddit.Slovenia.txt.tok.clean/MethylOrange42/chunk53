  giorgi was , nonetheless , baptised with kinglike honours by georgian patriarch ilia ii . 
  how ? 
  mila is a perfectly normal slavic name . 
  edit : well , i guess an average redditor hears this name in conjunction with her surname way too often ... 
  nope , they inherited burgundy and netherlands as well as spain . 
  they claim descent from the biblical king david , hence the harp and sling . 
  in style of some posts on / r/vexillology posting flags that look [ so bad that you do n't understand how they managed to do it , to the point it 's almost an achievement . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vbk0c.gif ) i present you one of the most terrible coats of arms i have seen - yes , this thing is actually trying to pose as a coat of arms , unlike most terrible seals/logos . 
  yes , i know your village starts with letter \u0141 . 
  yes , [ i understand ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxp46-bziq ) you 're proud that your alphabet has a letter that awesome . 
  but seriously ? 
  now , let me blazon this :, 
  * or , a script capital letter \u0141 ( l with stroke ) argent . 
  on the crest ? 
  there 's no crest in this coat of arms , only escutcheon and the motto . 
  besides the current country flags ( which have probably all been named already ) : [ knights of malta ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/flag_of_the_sovereign_military_order_of_malta.svg/900px-flag_of_the_sovereign_military_order_of_malta.svg.png ) , [ nationalist belarus ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/flag_of_belarus_%281991-1995%29.svg/1000px-flag_of_belarus_%281991-1995%29.svg.png ) , [ `` cross of burgundy '' spanish flag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/flag_of_cross_of_burgundy.svg/750px-flag_of_cross_of_burgundy.svg.png ) , [ tahiti ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/flag_of_tahiti.svg/600px-flag_of_tahiti.svg.png ) , [ red cross ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/flag_of_the_red_cross.svg/900px-flag_of_the_red_cross.svg.png ) , [ oglala lakota ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/pine_ridge_flag.svg/1000px-pine_ridge_flag.svg.png ) , [ alabama ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/flag_of_alabama.svg/900px-flag_of_alabama.svg.png ) ... 
  it 's more of a heraldic thing than vexillological . 
  most people refer to the entire arms as the crest , when technically the crest is only the symbol placed above the shield ( atop the helmet ) . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/achievement_ ( heraldry ), 
  atmospheric pressure does n't work this way . 
  what you feel as atmospheric pressure is actually just the weight of air above . 
  venus has much more air , so the pressure is much higher . 
  so saying that high pressure on venus should push the atmosphere off is like saying that high pressure on the ocean bottom should cause the sea to be pushed away ( on land or something ) . 
  it 's pressure that exists only to counter the gravitational force . 
  why hydrogen escapes the atmosphere and heavier gasses do n't can be explained by using the maxwell-boltzmann distribution of energy . 
  no matter what type of particles you have , they 'll always have the same energy distribution at given temperature . 
  this means that lighter gases will move faster , as their molecules are lighter , than heavy gasses . 
  hydrogen is the lightest gas , so proportionally the largest amount of hydrogen molecules will be moving at above escape speed ( this is the speed required for a molecule to escape the force of gravity ) . 
  otherwise , gas can not simply escape gravity well of a planet , no matter the pressure . 
  and , if the fastest molecules start escaping , to preserve energy this means that , if there were no sun to supply with energy , the planet would be cooling down . 
  similar to how water can actually cool down things simply by evaporating . 
  ... this is one single official flag . 
  apart from version 4 , which has the placename written on it for some reason . 
  a coat of arms is defined by a blazon , the formal description , and not by the way it is drawn . 
  a given coat-of-arms may be drawn in many different ways , all considered equivalent , just as the letter `` a '' may be printed in many different fonts while still being the same letter . 
  since this is a flag featuring a coat of arms , all versions of the given coat of arms should be regarded as equally official when drawn on the flag , and none better than the others , as long as they are complete representations of the blazon . 
  oh look , this thing again . 
  what is going on ? 
  seriously , in the last two or three months i 've been seeing posts from brave educated sciencemen all over the social media about the stupid blonde anti-vaxers . 
  yes , i get it . 
  is this actually some kind of campaign or something ? 
  because it 's far too consistent and massive that i 'd just disregard it as yet another more-intelectual-than-thou circlejerk . 
  nah , they 're just mentally weak . 
  have you tried using wikimedia 's gnu cc . svgs , that you can find [ here ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/illustrated_atlas_of_french_and_english_heraldic_terms ) , nicely sorted into categories ? 
  there 's also a lot of coats of arms you can use as templates there ... that 's the templates i used to make [ my oc coat of arms for slovenia ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hmdatgw.png ) . 
  i 'd give those a shot , but i 'm currently busy , so i wo n't be able to make any at least until saturday ... depends on how soon you need them then . 
  use [ tenn\u00e9 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tenn%c3%a9 ) for the bear . 
  non-traditional , i know , but why not - if you do n't overdo on colours otherwise , it 's okay . 
  just a friendly piece of advice . 
  do n't google for `` brun\u00e2tre '' and go to images . 
  some are a bit bad or just strange , yes ... that 's where i found the * or , a script capital \u0141 argent * . 
  also , i 've had a big rush of ideas . 
  i 'll try to at least sit down and write some on paper later today , and send you some ideas what else could be done ( for example , masonry pattern instead of chequy ? ),

  i went to the prom wearing waistcoat ( no jacket ) and a pocket watch . 
  also , i wear cargo pants . 
  dem pockets . 
  i 've only recently started giving up because it 's too hard to find cargo pants that also fit nicely . 
  evolutionary psychology , however , is the only analysis of psychology that also tries to answer why humans act as we do . 
  this kind of gives it extra points in my opinion . 
  though , i 've seen opposing theories on what is true , both based on evolutionary explanation . 
  i 'd say the idea behind evolutionary psychology ( and cognitive science ) is much better than the usual philosophical approach to psychology , but the research done here is not yet on a high enough level . 
  hopefully this will change in the future . 
  co \u2082 is a greenhouse gas because it absorbs ir radiation of particular wavelengths ( this is how greenhouse effect works ; blocking earth 's radiation to space ) . 
  absorption in atmosphere follows the logarithmic beer-lambert law , there is a logarithmic relationship between transmitivity and concentration . 
  since co \u2082 [ already absorbs ] ( http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/ast161/unit5/images/atmos_mirtran.png ) most of it 's wavelengths , increasing co \u2082 levels does n't effect the greenhouse effect nearly as drastically as one would expect . 
  co \u2082 is already near its peak absorbance in atmosphere . 
  you ca n't make black tea noticeable blacker even by tripling the amount of tea . 
  the `` blanket-layers '' model of atmosphere is faulty as well . 
  the explanation why co \u2082 saturation does n't work says that because there 's a thicker layer of co \u2082 , heat retention increases . 
  however , since pressure is highest in the lower regions of atmosphere , most of the co \u2082 is situated here , and most of the heat is retained here . 
  upper layers are much sparser , so they do n't contribute as much . 
  so , the traditional blanket model assumes that every layer has the same thickness and transmittivity ; which is false . 
  also , what do you say about [ the co \u2082 levels lagging behind temperature changes in the past ] ( http://www.brighton73.freeserve.co.uk/gw/paleo/400000yearslarge.gif ) ? 
  i do n't trust climatological models yet . 
  one of the problems with them is the [ double itcz problem ] ( http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/jcli4272.1 ) , which predicts not one but two itczs in the tropics , and consequently twice the amount of rainfall . 
  at the same time , sea temperatures in the models diverge quickly from actual values and become much more extreme . 
  so , i believe the models fail to account for all damping processes present in atmosphere , and therefore the results of such models show much harsher correlation between the atmospheric parameters and results than realistic . 
  the simple explanation why co \u2082 levels decrease in colder weather is that co \u2082 as a gas is more soluble in cold water . 
  i fail to see what study takes this into account . 
  heh , they all have the same flags . 
  the point here is not so much whether co \u2082 levels are over - or underestimated , but the whole correlation . 
  if co \u2082 levels follow the change in temperature , then the co \u2082 could n't possibly cause the warming in the first place , but we need to explain why the levels rise almost immediately after the temperature changes . 
  i 've presented a model why this happened . 
  while the co \u2082 surely partially contributed to the change in temperature , the main cause must have been something else change in temperature, 
  all models rely on fine-tuning of the parameters , because they need to take sub-scale processes into account . 
  the parameters are of course tuned on actual data . 
  if the proposed mechanism is incorrect , it can still fit the curve and appear to properly predict what is going on , but in extreme scenarios , such as current rise in co \u2082 levels , they give the wrong predictions , because there was no pre-tuning the parameters . 
  the model predicting hurricane activity is very different , because those parameters are tuned on the data from previous seasons . 
  hurricane activity does n't directly correlate to atmospheric conditions , but to sea temperature differences and other directly measurable data , which are not drastically different from historical data as is the case with current co \u2082 levels . 
  [ the current flag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/flag_of_belize.svg/750px-flag_of_belize.svg.png ), 
  about half of the population are mestizos , so the admixture is much higher ; though the predominant culture of the country is creole . 
  i decided to give myself a challenge and design a greater coat of arms from scratch . 
  sparta somehow felt like a natural choice , because of the iconic lambda shield design . 
  for the colours , i used the spartan colours red , black and bronze .
