  the motto , *** \u0397 \u03a4\u0391\u039d \u0397 \u0395\u03a0\u0399 \u03a4\u0391\u03a3 *** , meaning roughly `` come back with your shield , or on it '' , is taken from plutarch 's moralia , allegedly a phrase by which spartan mothers reminded their sons of their duty as soldiers to sparta . 
  *** escutcheon **** : on a round shield ( aspis ) gules , a greek capital letter lambda sable within a bordure bronze . 
  *** supporters **** : two spartan warriors armed with a spear proper . 
  *** motto **** : \u0397 \u03c4\u03b1\u03bd \u03b7 \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 ( \u0112 tan \u0113 epi tas -- come back with your shield , or on it ) *, 
  that 's a good point . 
  i might also add shields ( either blank or downscaled coa ) to both supporters . 
  it was not only for aesthetic reason , but also because of laziness ... 
  [ it 's a calendar ] ( http://coyote-wind.com/studios/mayadate/images/articlefigure-haabglyphs.png ) , ordered in a circle to show the cyclic nature of time . 
  this particular calendar , [ haab ' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haab%27 ) , was used to count days in a solar year - mayans had more than just one way of counting days , just like we have parallel systems of weeks and months . 
  the depiction used on the flag example is taken directly from [ this relief ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/mayan_zodiac_circle.jpg ) . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lemon_ ( color ), 
  black tea is oxidized ( `` fermented '' ) , while green tea is only dried . 
  green tea preserves the chemical properties of tea much better . 
  i never noticed that , and i drink green tea every morning on empty stomach . 
  even if i skip breakfast . 
  i guess it depends on person . 
  well , i can assume the reason for this is that north korea has independent economy , and does n't rely on imperialist capitalist imports like south korea does !, 
  ... join us at / r/heraldry ; we have a subreddit dedicated to it as well . 
  poland even had clan heraldry , so multiple families used the same coat of arms because they belonged to the same clan . 
  there were only 200-300 different coats of arms in whole poland . 
  i have very prominent brow ridge , sloping forehead , occipital bun , and a slight barrel chest . 
  i also have decreased sensitivity to cold . 
  ( i 've shoveled snow barefoot once ... ) i guess i might have quite some neanderthal lineage as well . 
  if you really want to use tolkien 's legendarium to make comparison , neanderthals were the [ dr\u00faadan ] ( http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/dr%c3%baedain ) , while cromagnons were the [ edain ] ( http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/edain ) . 
  the dwarves in nordic folklore , however , were pretty different from tolkien 's dwarves . 
  the [ dvergr ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dwarf_ ( germanic_mythology \\ ) ) were originally a group of svart\u00e1lfar , `` black elves '' ; also , originally they were [ of normal height ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/sigurd_portal_%28sigurd_kills_regin%29.png ) , and only shrunk in size later . 
  since they dwelled underground , they were more connected with the notion of death ; they were pale and cold , while they had pitch black hair . 
  they were much more similar to the [ dwemer ] ( http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/dwemer ) of tes series . 
  slavic languages lost the labialization on those sounds , so it 's also cognate to slavic * kaj\u044c * . 
  * outrage * diverged in pronunciation from other similar words like * courage * ( / e\u026a / instead of / \u026a / ) , because of the folk etymology * out-rage * , while it is actually a french loanword . 
  though i do n't know when this happened . 
  another example is * schedule * , which is still pronounced with / \u0283 / in british english instead of / sk / . 
  it 's also not clear whether it 's disyllabic with a long vowel or trisyllabic ( ending with / u\u02d0l / or / \u028a.\u0259l / ) , but this is not even linked to american or british pronunciation . 
  not to mention that american english pronounces the < d  before < u  as / d\u0292 / , while british english pronounces it as / dj / . 
  the pronunciation may thus vary from / \u02c8\u0283\u025b.dju\u02d0l / to / \u02c8sk\u025b.d\u0292u.\u0259l / . 
  so did * blood * ; you can see that from shakespeare and chaucer . 
  note that in shakespeare famous sonnet 116 * love * rhymes with * remove * , and also * proved * with * loved * . 
  they probably have smaller chance to get punishing events or something . 
  otherwise i ca n't explain why that would happen , unless it 's hardcoded to troll us . 
  you 're welcome . 
  there was a link in the source code ... 
  just like the germans . 
  itt : people who disregard non-americans . 
  ... how do you get those colours in rgb ? 
  i tried searching for the blazon in different languages . 
  english ( * argent , a fess sable between three trefoils vert * ) and german ( * silber , ein schwarzer balken zwischen drei gr\u00fcnen dreibl\u00e4tter * ) did n't return anything . 
  also , bigge seems to be an english surname , related to surnames biggs and bigg , sometimes spelled with y. 
  that 's all i could find . 
  heh , i saw `` hot problems '' when it was around 10,000 views . 
  have you seen [ this site ? 
  ] ( http://www.j-dar.ca/ ) you can also play a game where you guess which movie is more jewish . 
  the funny thing is , even though i do n't watch movies much , i am right in about 80 % cases . 
  and i do n't even know how i know which one is right . 
  helms do n't mean that much in german heraldry ; probably because in germany ( hre ) the political system was n't as centralized as in other european countries . 
  they also like to go crazy with crests ; so it 's also possible to see multiple helmets with different crests . 
  take the [ rothschild ( austrian branch ) coat of arms as an example . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/great_coat_of_arms_of_rothschild_family.svg/702px-great_coat_of_arms_of_rothschild_family.svg.png ), 
  that 's why i prefer to go to 4chan 's / pol / for discussions about global politics . 
  there 's a lot of jerks , trolls , and extremists , true , but they at least ca n't downvote you into oblivion if you do n't subscribe to the general circlejerk . 
  everyone 's opinion is equal , because there 's no comment karma and no accounts . 
   koreans traditionally tend to weep loudly and hysterically when someone dies . 
  so koreans actually do this ? 
  because , when kim jong il died , and there were videos of mourning being shown , everyone assumed they 've been made to do so by the government , as a show to us westerners , because no sane person would mourn someone 's death like this . 
  not necessarily rape . 
  i believe he used the term `` unwanted sex '' to include the instances when the woman willingly has sex , but later regrets that decision . 
  resubmitting my last month 's suggestion because beanboy was in its own league last month, 
  also , we 're the ones with the most massive yugonostalgia going on currently . 
  logarithmic scales are much more useful actually . 
  while linear scales are good for comparing things similar in size , logarithmic scales are better when we 're talking about orders of magnitude . 
  anyway , even if we used a linear scale , we 'd mostly be counting the digits , so we 'd effectively be using a logarithmic scale . 
  a double solar eclipse perhaps , with two smaller moons crossing the stellar disk at the same time ? 
  salt particles work just as well as condensation cores for water droplets . 
  as long as the world has oceans , you should be fine ; strong winds can easily blow tiny drops of salty water into air , which then dry up to produce salt particles . 
  or perhaps arab ; it 's missing the usual white though . 
  the libyan flag uses the same three colours . 
  i like to use g = pi ^ 2 m/s ( ~ 9.8696 ) . 
  the pi 's cancel out sometimes . 
  also , 1 year = pi * 10 ^ 7 seconds ( it 's 31\u00a0556\u00a0926 precisely ) . 
  very useful in astronomy , both for calculating orbits and for converting to light years . 
  elliptical orbits differ from a perfectly circular only in that they have less angular momentum . 
  all elliptical orbits with equal major axis have same orbital period . 
  so , you can switch to a circular orbit with the diameter equal to the major axis of the elliptical orbit , calculate the orbital time , and then transform the orbit back into an ellipse . 
  there is also a simple formula for calculating velocity of an object in orbit at given distance : v = sqrt ( gm * ( 2/r - 1/a ) ) , where r is current distance and a is semimajor axis . 
  so , when you check orbital data for planets and moons , the parameter given for size of the orbit will not be listed as orbital radius or something like this , but semimajor axis , and the eccentricity will be given separately . 
  i probably should n't use the tropical year ( 365.2422 days ) , which is actual length of the cycle of equinoctes . 
  the standard year is usually the julian year of 365\u00a01/4 days or 31\u00a0557\u00a0600 seconds , while the sidereal period of earth ( relative to fixed stars ) is 365.25636 days or 31\u00a0558\u00a0150 seconds . 
  pick the one you want to use , all of them are about pi * 10 ^ 7 , 
  most of them were russians and ukrainians though , because they were by far the largest ethnic groups in soviet union . 
  the jesuits , perhaps ? 
  it would be totally unexpected , with all the conspiracies about freemasons , illuminati , and jews . 
  but , when you think about it , van rompuy , juncker , draghi , monti , rajoy and barroso all have ties to the jesuits , and also there 's the current pope francis . 
  so europe might as well be under jesuit control right now , if there are conspiracies about america being under jewish control . 
  [ it 's the year of the five emperors all over again !, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/year_of_the_five_emperors ), 
  a polar explorer , i guess . 
  think amundsen , larsen or byrd . 
  it 's \u2205 !, 
  not \u00d8 !, 
  learn the difference .
