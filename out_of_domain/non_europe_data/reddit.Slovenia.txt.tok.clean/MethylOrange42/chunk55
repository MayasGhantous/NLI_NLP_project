  i must have replied the wrong person then . 
  i just ca n't help but wonder how distorted the poles actually are . 
  especially noticeable would be the stretching of craters . 
  otherwise , good job . 
  there is no way i can think of to make this work . 
  the itcz at the equator is a primary climate feature , caused directly by solar irradiance , which is maximum near the equator ( it moves north-south seasonally because of the tilted axis ) . 
  this means that the equator will inevitably be an area of low air pressure , and the air will flow towards the equator . 
  the air then rises because it 's heated by the ground ( in turn heated by the sun ) , adiabatically cooling as it rises and dropping the moisture . 
  this is the force that drives the tropical weather . 
  the deserts are dry because of the trade winds that move air masses towards the equator . 
  the only deserts that are close to equator are the ones that are being cooled by a cold sea current . 
  cold sea inhibits the heating of the land , which means that convection is n't as strong and the air does n't rise and drop moisture . 
  examples are somalia and the coast of peru . 
  also , highlands near equator receive less rainfall as well , because the air already rises and drops moisture on the way there ; example would be eastern africa . 
  but then again , who says wastelands need to be dry ? 
  what if equatorial regions are simply too hot for plants to grow ? 
  ( c \u2083 photosynthesis shuts down at 45 \u00b0 c , c \u2084 at about 60 \u00b0 c ), 
  cliodynamics is a multidisciplinary branch of science that studies history from the viewpoint of mathematical modeling . 
  peter turchin is regarded as the father of cliodynamics , having coined the term in 2003 and written many articles . 
  i believe that understanding the concepts of cliodynamics is very helpful in worldbuilding as well . 
  rhodesia was in a much better state than zimbabwe is now .

  read - and study !, 
  - those three pages . 
  in general , what you want is a main sequence star ; those live for long enough to develop planets . 
  also , anything too bright will not only produce too much uv radiation , but will also burn out too fast . 
  in general : luminosity is related to mass ^ 3.5 , lifetime related to mass ^ -2.5 , and you can use the hr diagram to determine the temperature of the star . 
  also , if you pick brightness , you 've already approximately picked a spectral class , because you 're on the main sequence . 
  so , to answer :, 
   would i be better off picking a brightness and a spectral class and working backwards from there to mass , composition , and size ? 
  yes , this is in my opinion the best way to work . 
  hydrogen/helium ratio is predetermined by what generation star it is ( sun is a third generation star ) , metallicity ( presence of heavier elements than helium ) may vary , but it does n't affect how a star looks like very much - though it might affect how many and what kind of planets you might find . 
  come on , do some oc !, 
  i do n't like being one of only about five that posted oc there . 
  this is where you get started if you want to learn how to draw coas . 
  download inkscape and get started with those templates . 
  inkscape . 
  i 've just posted a link here to wikipedia 's pages with templates for making coas . 
  there are also simple coas , though . 
  actually , the most elegant and simple ones are usually the most effective .

  practice , practice , practice . 
  i started by simply redrawing coas of countries from blazons . 
  once you 're happy with the results , you can use the same artstyle for all coas you draw . 
  coas are defined by their blazon , the description , and not the depiction . 
   * nan-in , a japanese master during the meiji era ( 1868-1912 ) , received a university professor who came to inquire about zen . 
   * nan-in served tea . 
  he poured his visitor 's cup full , and then kept on pouring . 
   * the professor watched the overflow until he no longer could restrain himself . 
  `` it is overfull . 
  no more will go in !, 
   * `` like this cup , '' nan-in said , `` you are full of your own opinions and speculations . 
  how can i show you zen unless you first empty your cup ? 
  i drink lots of tea . 
  when i was 16 , the dentist who examined my teeth told me i should stop smoking . 
  high energy uv radiation is harmful because it can break down the chemical bonds . 
  so , if your life is organic , based on carbon , uv radiation is very likely to be harmful . 
  though your point on atmospheric composition is correct . 
  ozone blocks almost all the sun 's uv radiation , under 320 nm wavelength . 
  having a thick enough atmosphere of proper chemical composition could protect surface from uv radiation . 
  i think we could just edit four or five words to make it relevant to whatever needed . 
  i mean , most of it is just overusing the word fucking and adding some insults . 
  take that as an implication . 
  if i smoked , it was n't tobacco , and it was n't regularly anyway ...

  [ there 's a list of rivers that split along their course on wikipedia . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/river_bifurcation ) it 's a rare occurrence , because sooner or later the river will abandon one of the streams , but it does happen . 
  the most notable example is the [ casiquiare river ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/casiquiare_canal ) that redistributes some of the water from orinoco river along its upper stream into the rio negro , a major tributary of the amazon . 
  [ chao phraya ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chao_phraya_river ) in thailand also splits quite far inland , but both streams flow parallel to each other into the gulf of thailand . 
  most of the rivers do n't split earlier than in the delta , though . 
  they restored the old moldavian communist flag , actually . 
  the version with the hammer and sickle is the same as the old moldavian ssr flag . 
  belarus did something similar , restoring the old flag , albeit without the hammer and sickle . 
  it 's important to know that some eastern european countries attempted to transition without really dissolving the old political elites , so the communist parties are effectively still in power ( or at least fighting hard not to lose relevace ) , even if they took a new name . 
  for russians in ex-soviet countries , for example , communism often represents ties with their motherland . 
  this is the case in transnistria , and also in parts of ukraine . 
  perhaps . 
  or perhaps it developed a thick exoskeleton that protects it from surface radiation , when it left the seas .

  nothing is wrong . 
  it 's only that this flag is n't hoisted on a pole to the left of it , but to the right . 
  someone watched the future is wild, 
  you do n't need to include turkey if you include independent venetia . 
  and , if lukashenko regime falls , belarus can be added as well . 
  i 'd also very much like to see independent corsica ... 
  it 'd be nice to see how she looks like without effects or filters either . 
  anthropology division, 
  she probably wears makeup on the street anyway . 
  also , i asked for without the effects or filters , not without any makeup ... 
  the eyebrows are a bit off-putting , to say the least .
