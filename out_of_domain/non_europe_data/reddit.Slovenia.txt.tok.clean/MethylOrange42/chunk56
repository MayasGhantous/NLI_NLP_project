  i still very much prefer the image in the op . 
  she passed the uncanny valley in that pic already , i guess . 
  and the 3d effect on edges , 
  yeah , it does n't even follow the shapes , just the outermost outline . 
  it 's a red lion with blue claws and tongue on silver/white background , and then there 's a chief ( horizontal strip in the upper about third of the shield ) of gold/yellow colour with a black eagle on it . 
  the eagle is placed on the chief . 
  i 'd draw you the coa from the blazon , but i 'm not at home right now . 
  the plot is better though . 
  [ current ( non-heraldic ) coat of arms ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/coat_of_arms_of_brazil.svg/1000px-coat_of_arms_of_brazil.svg.png ), 
  [ coat of arms of empire of brazil ( 1840-1889 ) ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/coat_of_arms_of_the_empire_of_brazil.svg/1092px-coat_of_arms_of_the_empire_of_brazil.svg.png ), 
  the proposal builds on the old imperial coat of arms , while removing the explicitly imperial symbols . 
  it 's [ anglo-saxon runic script ( futhorc ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-saxon_futhorc ) , a variant of [ germanic runes ( futhark ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elder_futhark ) . 
  the tolkien 's [ cirth ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cirth ) look very similar though . 
  the blazon is slightly confusing , perhaps counterintuitive , because it is missing the commas . 
  but generally , the fields are named first , and then the charges that go on the fields . 
  so if the blazon calls for a lion , and then mentions a chief , this means that the lion is in main field , and then the chief is added . 
  to break down the blazon with commas :, 
  * argent , a lion passant gules armed and langued azure , on a chief d'or an eagle displayed sable . 
  that way it 's much more obvious that the lion is on the main ( argent ) field , and that the eagle is on the chief ( d'or ) . 
  technically , all the stars in a rectangular pattern are n't equal either , some are on the edge and some are even in the corners . 
  though , this is something you can not really avoid , perhaps if you arrange the stars in one single ring , as eu does ... but this would be impractical for usa . 
  ( semi-related - the fact that molecules on surface have less neighbours than the molecules in the middle is the physical principle behind surface tension . 
  so it 's not insignificant . ), 
  was n't georgetown , right northwest to washington inside the dc , founded before us declared independence ? 
  so , what was their status historically ? 
  ah , the good ol' `` seal on a bedsheet '' design . 
  no vikings in india ( as they promised ) my ass . 
  even the ai in spectator mode does this shit . 
  i actually kind of like the current arms ... though , perhaps a better word would be emblem . 
  it 's not too complicated , it 's neatly designed , and the crux works well as a symbol . 
  i just finished reading the aar . 
  i find the presence of jerusalem in vara\u017edin quite amusing considering the fact that there 's a village which was also a local pilgrimage destination called [ jeruzalem ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jeruzalem,_ljutomer ) right accross the border from vara\u017edin in slovenia . 
  it also has a negative effect on the potential siblings with whom the child shares half their genes with . 
  actually , to me personally , `` selfish '' sounds much more personal and conscious than `` sinister '' . 
  while `` sinister '' is just dark and twisted by nature , `` selfish '' actually sounds like consciously egoistic in decision making . 
  the people not realizing that you 're joking about the gojira . 
  it 's much more common in british heraldic traditions , yes , but there are numerous examples of it from outside great britain as well .

  from what i understand , poles were the first to make vodka , but it was not a distilled beverage back then ; distillation was only invented in late middle ages . 
  according to a legend , a russian monk named isidore was the first to actually distill vodka to make it higher proof . 
  of course , it 's possible that he 's not the only person who did this ... 
  you 're going to the wrong boards then . 
  especially stay out of / b / ; it 's the containment board for edgy teenagers  inb4 b & . 
  / v / is shit as well , from what i heard . 
  i personally like / fa / , / ck / , / int / , and / pol / ( the circlejerk is strong with this one though ) . 
  / mu / and / fit / are big boards with large communities , so they have well developed board culture , and it might be a bit harder to get used to it . 
  / adv / is nice as well , and if you want to go for a feels trip , go to / r9k / , biggest den of sadvirgins in existence . 
  i do n't know much of the other boards . 
  i know i 'm late for comments ... but canadian heraldry is distinct by the fact that it likes to combine different animals together .

  it 's bacon without the meaty parts . 
  that 'd be israel . 
  [ it 's fair now . 
  very nice . 
  i appreciate that finally some oc is being posted here . 
  though , i think it should somehow include the [ three ostrich feathers from the heraldic badge ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/prince_of_wales%27s_feathers_badge.svg/339px-prince_of_wales%27s_feathers_badge.svg.png ) . 
  also , the motto looks a bit wonky because the ribbons are not connected . 
  edit : / u/forkmegently 's proposal for coa of england is [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/heraldry/comments/1ls2vt/my_idea_for_an_english_coat_of_arms/ ) . 
  what i find annoying is those forms where you 're required to write down `` county/state '' . 
  i live in slovenia , the only subnational administrative divisions we have are municipalities , which of course goes under `` town '' . 
  so , what am i supposed to write there ? 
  an empty space ? 
  some forms reject if you write an empty space . 
  fuck you big countries and your administrative divisions . 
  let me recommend you another mongol folk metal band - [ nine treasures ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e1jywgvfni ) . 
  they 're from inner mongolia as well , but the lyrics are in mandarin unlike tengger cavalry . 
  i also recommend [ domog ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lpowiu9ppo ) and [ khusugtun ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiezburov5o ) from mongolia , and the tuvan band [ yat-kha ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khyboaw4piu ) - those three are not metal-related though , just traditional music , and yat-kha has some rock influences in some songs . 
  traditional mongolian ( and tuvan ) music is something i really love , and i ca n't understand why . 
  edit : and i almost forgot the band [ hanggai ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ch7gi-xeee ) , from china as well ; they play mongol folk rock , so they 're stylistically in between the metal of tengger cavalry and the traditional music . 
  another thing i 'd love to hear is if someone tried to combine traditional music of mali with metal . 
  [ bassekou kouyate ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2vqamystfw ) is already playing with guitar effects on ngoni a bit . 
  because progressive is defined as the direction western world is going . 
  the idea behind at least understanding possible future development of the system of civilization is somehow similar to the idea of statistical physics . 
  while the theory is unable to predict the behaviour of independent particles , it can still describe the system as a whole . 
  if the system is big enough , the fluctuations of the system ( which are caused by the fact that we do n't understand the movement of each separate particle ) are small enough that the whole system is deterministic as a whole ( at least in approximation ) . 
  so , even if we can not predict how humans act , we could still potentially write down laws that can give good enough predictions of how civilization might evolve in the following years . 
  just like how we can predict weather up to two weeks forward with more or less accuracy , even though the system on itself is chaotic and we can not describe individual air molecules . 
  i 'm more worried by the fact that mongols are culturally appropriating heavy metal . 
  only true nordic aryans should be allowed to listen to metal . 
  edit : i 'm also worried that , on contrary , not liking this music would be racism . 
  i guess 3 per person is enough ( as it was originally ) , i would n't like betting all on one flag . 
  what was the limit this month ? 
  3 per person per country ( so 9 per person ) ? 
  ( i know enough heraldry that i could just google for the blazon , and behold !, 
  the first hit . ), 
  edit : considering the fact that heraldry seems to be having a renaissance in canada right now ( [ article ] ( http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/03/27/how-canada-became-home-to-some-of-the-worlds-more-visually-stunning-and-fun-heraldry/ ) ) , i guess it should n't be too hard to make a point here . 
  just do n't forget to mention that the logo as it is is still good , it 's just not fit for a flag ... 
  [ governor of oklahoma 's standard . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/standard_of_the_governor_of_oklahoma.svg/500px-standard_of_the_governor_of_oklahoma.svg.png ) do n't know why really , though the seal looks cool and it 's green , not blue . 
  not really . 
  mars does n't have active tectonics , and probably never had , as there are no identifiable separate cratons on mars . 
  if mars had tectonic plates in its geological history , we should be able to locate those plates frozen in time . 
  there , however , is a single rift valley ( valles marineris ) , so there still were some movements of the crust . 
  the currently most accepted idea is that as mars cooled down , the crust contracted , so it had to break at some point , just like how the cracks in drying mud form . 
  note that this is a single rift valley , unlike on earth , where every ocean has it 's own rift , and then there 's also the east african rift . 
  the highest mountains on mars are of volcanic origin . 
  olympus , ascraeus , pavonis and arsia mons lie on the tharsis plateau just west of valles marineris , then there 's alba mons to the north and elysium mons on the opposite hemisphere . 
  they 're similar to the hawaiian volcanoes , only much bigger . 
  there 's also evidence of sporadic volcanic activity in the last 100 million years . 
  so , how did those volcanoes grow so big ?
