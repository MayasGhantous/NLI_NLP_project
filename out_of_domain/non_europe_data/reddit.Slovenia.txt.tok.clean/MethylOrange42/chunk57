  the volcanoes are probably formed by a mantle plume , just like the hotspot volcanoes on earth . 
  because mars does n't have moving tectonic plates , the land above the plume stays in place , and the volcano can keep on growing for billions of years , where on earth the plate above the mantle plume moves away and a new volcano appears every several million years , forming a volcanic chain ( think of hawaii ) . 
  also , ~ ~ there 's no ~ ~ erosion * is much slower * on mars because there 's no water * and because winds have less power than on earth because of much lower air pressure * . 
  also , do n't forget that there is , indeed , one volcano on earth that is comparable in size with olympus mons . 
  though , it 's far from being as tall , and it 's not one single volcano but a volcanic complex , iceland . 
  if you consider iceland a single volcano , it 's huge . 
  you 're right . 
  but even those processes are much slower on mars than on earth - wind has much less power because of lower air pressure , and freeze/thaw does n't occur on massive scale every year as it does on earth in the colder parts of the temperate zone . 
  \\* pukes internally *, 
  the quest for the worst coa in existence continues . 
  just like how many municipal councils mistake flag with a [ sheet with a drawing on it ... ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/23zjtb/my_countys_atrocious_flag/ ), 
  edit : also , it 's explicitly defined as a coat of arms ( * grb * ) and not an emblem or logotype . 
  ( [ as seen in local newspaper tr\u017ei\u010dan ] ( http://www.grboslovje.si/shramba14/krize-trzican-8-2013.jpg ) ), 
   is n't everest like an iceberg , in that most is below sea level ? 
  you 're probably thinking of isostasy , which basically means that because the mountains need to `` float '' on the asthenosphere , the lithosphere ( which is of course lighter than asthenosphere ) beneath mountains is much thicker than the crust elsewhere to support the extra weight . 
  it 's also important to note that `` height above the surface of mars '' does n't mean relative height relative to the surroundings . 
  instead , a zero height is defined in terms of atmospheric pressure isoline - the triple point of water pressure ( 6.105 mbar ) , the pressure under which liquid water can not exist as ice sublimates directly into water vapour . 
  olympus mons reaches top height of a bit more than 21km above datum , and the deepest point is in the hellas planitia , impact creter in the southeastern hemisphere , about 8km below datum . 
  ascraeus mons , the second tallest mountain on mars with height of about 18km above datum sits right on the tharsis plateau , which is already 7km above datum , so the volcano itself is `` only '' 11km tall . 
  the first duke of grafton was henry fitzroy , the illegitimate son of king charles ii of england and barbara villiers , countess of castlemaine . 
  ( fitzroy was a surname which denoted illegitimate sons of the king ), 
  the coat of arms is therefore the coat of arms of king charles ii , debruised by a baton sinister for illegitimacy . 
  * the royal arms of charles ii ; quarterly : 1st and 4th , france and england quarterly ; 2nd , scotland ; 3rd , ireland ; the whole debruised by a baton sinister compony of six pieces argent and azure . 
  chemical oxidation . 
  the red martian dust is mostly iron oxides , which are reddish-brown in colour . 
  the levels of equal pressure are ( assuming hydrostatic equilibrium ) also levels of equal potential energy . 
  the shape of gravitational field of a planet can be measured via disruptions in satellite orbits . 
  the reference shape of the earth , the geoid , is also defined in that way , in terms of spherical harmonics that approximate the true shape of the potential . 
  the geoid 's variation from the simple ellipsoid defined by equatorial and polar radius of earth by about 100 meters at most . 
  that 's exactly what the mars global surveyor mission did with mars . 
  the reference ellipsoid for mars is called areoid , and is represented the same way as the geoid . 
  another instrument aboard the mgs was mars orbiter laser altimeter , which took precise measurements of altitude . 
  the altitude map is the difference between this data and the areoid . 
  zero-height datum , of course , needs to be calculated from surface measurements . 
  nah , i 've seen it on 4chan 's / pol / a lot as well . 
  it 's a part of being `` comfortable with one 's own sexuality '' and `` sexual liberation '' , regardless how twisted that might be - as long as you do n't hurt others . 
  reddit seems to circlejerk this a lot , as a bart of being liberal , because if you really accept such ideals , there 's no rational explanation why being attracted to children is any different ( of course , if you leave children alone , that is ) . 
  if they 're just creepy fucks ogling at kids , then it 's okay , because , `` that 's their sexual preference , man , it 's not like they can do something about it '' . 
  the title of [ `` emperor of all spain '' ( * imperator totius hispaniae * ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emperor_of_spain ) did exist , actually . 
  well , i guess we 've finally put the hdr to good use . 
   the box i put myself in, 
  there 's your problem . 
  never , absolutely never put a label on yourself . 
  what you are should be defined by your actions , and not vice versa . 
  this is one of the main principles i live by . 
  i somehow feel that by putting a label on myself i 'd lose my sense of what i am , as instead of doing what i like i 'd be doing what i believe i am expected to do . 
  which is not a good thing . 
  the label that will mark my life , for good or for bad , will not be self-imposed , but given to me by the judgement of other people in my life . 
  you 're cheating , you have the best seal out there . 
   while it is commonly attributed to queen marie antoinette , [ 1 ] there is no record of this phrase ever having been uttered by her . 
  it appears in jean-jacques rousseau 's confessions , his autobiography ( whose first six books were written in 1765 , when marie antoinette was nine years of age , and published in 1782 ) . 
  the context of rousseau 's account was his desire to have some bread to accompany some wine he had stolen ; however , in feeling he was too elegantly dressed to go into an ordinary bakery , he thus recollected the words of a `` great princess '' . 
  [ 2 ] as he wrote in book 6 :, 
   ( finally i recalled the stopgap solution of a great princess who was told that the peasants had no bread , and who responded : `` let them eat brioche . '' ), 
   rousseau does not name the `` great princess '' and he may have invented the anecdote , as confessions was , on the whole , a very unreliable autobiography . 
  yeah , she totally said that . 
  i 'm disappointed that they missed the chance to name the 4th movie * fast & 4ious * . 
   warden pears formed part of the provisions of the troops at agincourt in 1415 , where worcestershire bowmen carried banners depicting a pear tree laden with fruit . 
   on queen elizabeth i 's visit to the city of worcester in august 1575 , the city authorities had a fruit-laden tree transplanted to the foregate in her honour . 
  so admiring was she of the good management that had allowed the fruit to remain unplucked that she ordered `` 3 pears sable '' to be added to the city 's coat of arms , which probably gave rise to the name ` black worcester ' .

  very inaccurate . 
  hinduism is listed as unrelated to indo-european polytheism , `` african '' animism is for some reason listed as an offshoot of catholicism , and existence of a common pan-eurasian nostratic culture is highly questionable . 
  also , why are aztec listed as south american ? 
  ( just ignore him , he 's just an annoying novelty account ), 
  wow,

  very doge, 
  much serene, 
  kingdom of fife , bounded on south by the firth of forth . 
  you 're thinking too game-y . 
  in reality managing a huge empire is not that easy , especially if it 's so big it takes a month to get information from the borders . 
  this is actually why feudalism was invented by the achaemenid persian empire . 
  it was much better and easier to divide a huge realm and maintain alliances . 
  use the canadian pale : make the central stripe twice as wide , on a 1:2 flag .

  gregor mendel , whose work on inheritance was crucial for theory of evolution , however , was actually a friar . 
  darwin did n't know how traits are inherited , so his theory of evolution is incomplete without mendelian inheritance . 
  also , the fact that vaccines have contributed to general health greatly does n't make every vaccine holy and immaculate . 
  remember the recent flu panic ? 
  all the craze about buying vaccines proved to be completely unnecessary . 
  and yet , if you dared to say that vaccination against flu was unnecessary , some people would come and call you a mindless anti-vaxxer . 
  into a solid sphere of uniform density . 
  if density increases with depth , gravity will decrease slower than linearly . 
  for example , earth has metallic core that is much denser than the mantle . 
  if you managed to somehow drill a hole all the way down to the core , gravity would be about the same all the way down . 
  it 's called / mu /, 
  and emperor charles v , who decided against uniting the imperial and spanish crown . 
  i 've seen someone post here that republic of france formed in his game . 
  they were about 500 years early ... 
   he was just so impressed with how the indians fought, 
  after he defeated king porus , he allowed him retain the title , but effectively vassalized him . 
  but porus was a relatively unimportant ruler . 
  most of india was ruled by the nanda empire at that time , and alexander 's soldiers mutinied at the hyphasis river , exhausted , and because :,
