  japanese power metal band galneryus has curiously large number of flag-related song titles : * united flag * , * struggle for the freedom flag * , * rebel flag * , * braving flag * , * the flag of reincarnation * , * the promised flag * .

  you like huey lewis and the news ? 
  their early work was a little too new wave for my taste , but when sports came out in ' 83 , i think they really came into their own , commercially and artistically . 
  the whole album has a clear , crisp sound , and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost . 
  he 's been compared to elvis costello , but i think huey has a far more bitter , cynical sense of humor . 
  in ' 87 , huey released this , fore ! , their most accomplished album . 
  i think their undisputed masterpiece is `` hip to be square , '' a song so catchy , most people probably do n't listen to the lyrics . 
  but they should , because it 's not just about the pleasures of conformity , and the importance of trends , it 's also a personal statement about the band itself !, 
  a bit like t in * future * ( again depending on dialect ) or q in chinese loanword * qi * , i guess .

  i 'd say that you can see it because the two greys are placed next to each other , so it 's possible to see the one is bluer and the other is redder . 
  looking at both separately , they would just seem grey . 
  similar to how it 's possible to hear microtones if they 're played one after another , but it would be much harder to detect a single microtonally flat or sharp note . 
  i actually changed place of articulation here ; the first ( * q * ) is pronounced with a retracted tongue , while the second ( * \u00e7 * ) is pronounced in same place as ordinary [ t ] . 
  but both sound similar , that 's why they tend to merge in various languages . 
  [ this should give you an idea . 
  ] ( http://clas.mq.edu.au/speech/phonetics/phonetics/consonants/oral_stops.html ) letters written next to figures are ipa , the standard alphabet for writing pronunciation ; * q * is thus written [ c ] and * \u00e7 * would be written [ t\u0361\u0283 ] ( simultaneous [ t ] and [ \u0283 ] -- * sh * sound ) , but this is pronounced in same place as just [ t ] .

  i considered using roman-kin for a while , complete with preferred pronouns in latin , but molecule-kin is so much better . 
  i 'm from slovenia , i have a name that is neither typically slavic nor has an equivalent in most european languages , and still ... there 's some fuckwad who apparently shares my name and is sonic fan .

   your bed, 
  i do n't have an actual bed ; i found out i sleep much better on sofa-beds . 
  so i naturally bought one . 
  effectively i can turn it into a 200x140cm bed , but it 's a bit harder than most mattresses . 
  did n't have any girls at my place since buying it , though . 
  the protonated form is fucked up , actually , the proton binds to thhe right atom in azo group , but that breaks the - ph - shorthands , and character limit , so i never felt like fixing it . 
  also , is us flag vertical the wrong way , or is it technically correct , since it 's on a sleeve from the right ?

  golden horde was actually buddhist at first ( at least the khans were ) . 
  they only converted to islam under ozbeg when he became khan in 1313 . 
  kalmyks north of caspian sea , which are descendants of golden horde mongols are actually still buddhist . 
  some mongols were nestorians as well , ever since about the 7th century , for example sorghaghtani beki , mother of m\u00f6ngke , kublai , h\u00fcleg\u00fc , and ariq b\u00f6ke . 
  the striped naval jack is inspired by majapahit banner , which already used the red and white combination back in 13th century . 
  many other states in the area also used the same combination . 
  this explains why removing the blue stripe made sense .

  yes , but their leaders have converted quite soon . 
  also , while the mongol invasion spawns h\u00fcleg\u00fc and batu , and there were historical h\u00fcleg\u00fc khan ( ilkhanate ) and batu khan ( golden horde ) , they were only just born around the time of the in game invasion . 
  so i guess the game really should clean up the historicity of mongol invasion ; perhaps by actually making a borjigid dynasty of genghis khan 's descendants . 
  also , the mongols could start as a single horde , just like how it is if you start playing while genghis is still alive ( before 1227 ) , but make them break up by event of \u00d6gedei 's death ( historically in 1241 ) , after which the borjigids could n't agree on who should succeed him as the khagan , effectively breaking up the mongol empire . 
  but i 'm not sure how this would influence, 
  historical batu khan was tengri at first , but later converted to buddhism , while h\u00fcleg\u00fc was nestorian at first , both his mother and primary wife being nestorian , but favoured buddhism later in his life as well . 
  i guess making some mongol starting characters buddhist or nestorian , while making the horde leaders tengri , would best reflex the actual situation . 
  reminds me of [ jizzus christ of 4chan fame ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/1trmn9/the_7th_cumming_of_jizzus_christ_fullsize_image/ ) . 
  just dropping by to say that this is a very unfortunate translation , even though it 's often used . 
  since * srpska * is ( feminine form of ) adjective meaning `` serbian '' , translating the name into `` serbian/serb republic '' would make much more sense .
