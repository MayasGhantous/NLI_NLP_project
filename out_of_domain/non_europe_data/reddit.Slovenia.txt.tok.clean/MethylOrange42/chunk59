  makes you wonder if there are any other mistakes that will seem similarly stupid in next couple hundred years that medicine is currently doing . 
  i remember the h1n1 panic of 2009 . 
  our school ordered us to wash hands almost every hour , and door handles were disinfected every day . 
  al\u00feou\u021d , \u0195y not revive the [ yo\u021d ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yogh ) and [ \u01bfynn ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wynn ) , and start using [ \u0195air ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hwair ) as \u01bfell ? 
  so , turkestan , nubia and bihar are non-player as well ? 
  how strong are they actually going , what are their relations to the player dynasties ? 
  because , besides the fayizid and tsaritsyn ( which effectively just usurped s\u00f6ze lands ) player-generated characters seem to dominate the game ( as they should ) ; but , could those perhaps still become major characters in the game ?

  or rather , lets ask the [ canadian heraldic authority ] ( http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg ) . 
  oh wait , it 's not listed . 
  probably because it 's not an actual coat of arms , but just a shield-shaped logo . 
  [ our slovenian `` coat of arms '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_slovenia ) is similarly ridiculous . 
   the designer , marko poga\u010dnik , has described the coat of arms as a cosmogram , which creates an energetic field protecting the country and stimulating its inner potentials . 
  our `` coat of arms '' is not blazoned at all , and instead it must be exactly geometrically constructed , to ward off evil spirits . 
  fuck me sideways . 
  [ i 'm just wondering how could this happen in canada .

  wait , what about ruthenia ? 
  the king is a hellenic putin dynasty member . 
   a woman who contracts a same-sex marriage may bear arms on a shield or banner , impaling the arms of her wife with her own or ( in cases where the other party is an heraldic heiress ) placing the arms of her wife in pretence . 
   on a shield, 
  bearing the combined arms on a lozenge would actually make more sense in my opinion . 
  well , ruthenia is basically ukraine , so ... it 's topical . 
  that is , unless the two putins make a stand together against the tlatoani of sicily-but-actually-crimea . 
  rus ' seems to be stronger than sicily .

  reddit does n't upvote what is true , but what appeases the hivemind . 
  edit : to clarify , as the comment in question is vague . 
  the difference is that the `` calorie count '' is actually measured by metabolising the sample completely . 
  while in reality , a part of this energy is already burned by gut flora , especially the complex carbs that can not be broken down my enzymes . 
  not to mention that some nutrients do n't get absorbed , for various reasons ( olestra , for example , instead of normal fats , but i think those are not counted in calories anyway ) . 
  of course not . 
  calling out the hivemind never appeases the hivemind . 
  unless it 's the hipster kind of hivemind . 
  i added some clarification though . 
  so , why are n't single ladies considered as equal to men regarding the right to bear arms on a shield , if having a wife is equal to having a husband ? 
  though i have nothing against the canadian solution , where both men and women are entitled to bearing their arms on a shield , i 'd just prefer some consistency in this . 
  but widowers do n't have to switch at all , even if it was their husband , and not wife , that died . 
  i do n't know , everything gets weird if you want to keep the lozenge and maintain some meaningful order .

  well , i realized this was probably posted on / r/tumblrinaction ; but i had no idea what comment you replied to . 
  what i 'm wondering right now is : several gm crops have been modified to produce bt-proteins , which are effectively natural insecticide , in order to protect them from pests . 
  from what i know , bt-proteins have specific insecticidal against several insect species , including bees . 
  how sure are we that gm crops are n't interfering with honeybees , as well as the synthetic insecticides ? 
  could making all ( or at least the majority ) crops insect-resistant have unforeseen adverse effects on insect populations ? 
  the [ flag of austria ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_austria ) has been used , not as a national but as a regional flag though , since 1230 , so it 's actually almost as old as the dannebrog .

  iceland has two contestants in the final ? 
  nice . 
  first , a lapsus scripti , but it 's * mullets of five points * , not six . 
  the grey is described as silver in official colour coding , so i guess it should be blazoned as * argent * instead of the more unusual * cendr\u00e9e * . 
  also , repeating the name of the colour is redundant ; more elegant way to describe the field with a griffin would be * a griffin segreant holding a sword argent * , as tincture applies to all previous charges described . 
  the compartment is usually just simply described without overdoing with the heraldic terms . 
  so , the description would be * oak branches vert , a ribbon in colours of the latvian flag ( gules a bar argent ) . 
  * * bar * is same as * fess * but thinner . 
  otherwise , you pretty much nailed it . 
  like i did in my posts ... 
  i 'd very much like it if this became customary here . 
  i mean , most coas have the blazon posted somewhere , so you can just copypaste it . 
  if you really ca n't find the blazon , and get stuck trying to blazon it on your own , you can ask for help anyway . 
  if there were more people drawing coas here , we could hold a describe and draw game every once in a while . 
  one person draws the coa , another blazons it , and so on . 
  that way we could actually practice and improve our heraldic vocabulary . 
  but as for now , i do n't think we 're active enough for this . 
   a rising sun or, 
  he wrote that actually . 
  rotation in 3d projected onto 2d is also just warping the 2d space . 
  it 's slightly more massive , so it is expected to be a bit hotter spectral class than sun , assuming the same composition . 
  of course .
