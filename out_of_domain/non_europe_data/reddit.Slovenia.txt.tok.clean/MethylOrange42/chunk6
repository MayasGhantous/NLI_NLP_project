  i 'm the guy who posted this to reddit in first place . 
  ( [ linky link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/183lt5/ineedmasculismbecause/ ) ), 
  i 'd like to warn you that even though 4chan is full of dickheads doing everything `` for teh lulz '' , there have been good causes that started as trolling on 4chan . 
  remember anonymous and their raids on scientology . 
  they started it , but it 's up to us if we ride the wave and try accomplish something or just sit and watch this in disdain . 
  op , you should check yourself - before you shrek yourself !, 
  oh dear god . 
  check this girl 's tweets with this hashtag . 
  edit : aaaand ... it has officially been hijacked . 
  well , the shitstorm officially just broke loose . 
  no fucking idea . 
  tried with google 's search by image , no results . 
  it is quite possible that they are not a band at all but just some metalheads posing for a badass photo . 
  wait a moment . 
  you actually find her unfeminine because she has wide nose and short curly hair ? 
  she looks perfectly fine imho . 
  [ botswana is in south africa , fyi . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/location_botswana_au_africa.svg/500px-location_botswana_au_africa.svg.png ), 
  according to the band , they are doing the same for malazan book of the fallen what summoning did for lord of the rings . 
  all their songs are a tribute to the book series . 
  hamster !, 
  so do carach angren . 
  and burzum . 
  and probably more others . 
  actually , it is 5-7-5 . 
  5 words , 7 words , 5 words . 
  sarcasm motherfucker , do you speak it ? 
  \\  america, 
  \\  good, 
  yep , made by israel . 
  use [ reddit enhancement suite ] ( http://redditenhancementsuite.com/ ) and you never ever have to go to imgur . 
  you can load the pics inline . 
  and if that is not enough , use [ hover zoom ] ( http://hoverzoom.net/ ) . 
  the problem with hover zoom is that it does not work with albums . 
  otherwise i agree that it 's better . 
  i thought that my explanation of 5-7-5 made it quite clear that i was being sarcastic . 
  but , whatever . 
  it was uploaded by mootislove . 
  ` nuff said, 
  i 've been following tsfh since 2009 . 
  great stuff , pretty much all of it . 
  also check bergersen 's solo album , if you have n't yet . 
  not to mention the fact that bergersen 's take on dubstep is the tastiest i 've ever heard : check [ my soul not yours ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hob-og7nsq4 ) for example . 
  7th seeker !, 
  i personally prefer no makeup ( and yes , i notice natural makeup ) , because i 'm more attracted to the `` natural beauty '' . 
  but , i also do n't mind some , or even lots of , if it is not just makeup for the sake of makeup . 
  the thing is that i appreciate those little imperfections ( i prefer the term variability ) , and makeup generally tries to hide them . 
  disciple ,, 
  came here to say this . 
  yes , but not exactly . 
  upvotes are for when you read the comment and you agree with it , while i agreed with it before i even read the comments . 
  it 's the sleevelessness that complements the manly body figure . 
  this is why i like to wear waistcoats , even though they 're rarely worn nowadays . 
  the second reason would be the tightness - the fact that you feel it touching your muscles makes you more self-conscious . 
  but i can not attest to this as i 've never worn one . 
   be me about 2,000 years ago, 
   visiting earth , be in the middle east, 
   see a young broad who reminds me of someone ive been with a few times, 
   she 's a wild one, 
   share a few bowls of drink with her, 
   eventually get her back to my spaceship, 
   next morning she takes off talking about how she is married, 
   wtf whatever, 
   few months later she was preggo as fuck, 
   dude she 's with is a true faggot, 
   thinks his whore wife is still a virgin despite the pregnancy, 
   people these days, 
   another few months pass , she has the kid, 
   she convinces beta bf that an astral being fucked her so technically she 's a virgin, 
   mfw my sufficiently advanced technology was indistinguishable from magic, 
   mfw kid turns out to be a good magician, 
   mfw the village begins calling my kid god 's son, 
   mfw they think i 'm god, 
   mfw he still has people fooled 2,000 years afterwards, 
  it was 1 hour ago ; check `` other discussions '' . 
  considering the fact that horses are generally more picky about what they eat , and that general conditions in which they live are often better than of other livestock , horse meat should actually be better in general . 
  the problem is that the lack of regulations caused this . 
  and the fact that horse meat is taboo in uk . 
  source : in slovenia , it is possible to get horse meat , and it is delicious . 
  nope ; do n't worry about that , they 're too precious . 
  also , even though it is possible , it is still rarely eaten . 
  most people i know have never tasted it . 
   jerk, 
  4chan detected, 
  full bush or trimmed for me . 
  but i guess my opinion does n't count really nowadays . 
  it 's probably because i have n't watched porn as a teenager , so i never developed liking for the shaved one . 
  another one , some of them may be the same . 
  oh god who upvotes this shit . 
   does n't greentext, 
  considering the fact that both posts are highlighted , it is quite possible that it 's the same op . 
  disirregardlessly , the faggo ~ ~ ti ~ ~ tude of op is indubitable . 
  edit : apparently , i am a faggot too . 
  i do acknowledge the fact that the word `` faggotude '' is used with greater frequency , but i am obliged to point out that the term `` faggotitude '' is indeed of greater etymological and morpholinguistical appropriateness . 
  are you implying that `` doubt '' should then be written as `` dout '' and `` island '' as `` iland '' ? 
  as that would be preposterous . 
  i intentionally used those two words as a witty joke i did n't expect you to understand because they should be spelled without those silent letters , if you check the etymology .
