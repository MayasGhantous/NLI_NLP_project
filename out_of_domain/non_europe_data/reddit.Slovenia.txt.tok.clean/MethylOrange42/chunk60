  ( blame the french and their adjective order for that ), 
  is there any language where dirty talk is n't awkward ? 
  it 's just a way of avoiding repeating yourself with the tinctures . 
  though i personally do n't like it that much ; i always get confused which tincture is which . 
  there are other ways of doing this as well ; you could also describe the base half as * countercoloured * : * party per pale argent and gules , a lion rampant contourn\u00e9 and a griffin segreant wielding a sword countercoloured . 
  ( edit : actually , * countercoloured * , not * counterchanged * - which is if the same charge crosses the line of division ), 
  if you had no intuitive sense of what the 3d is , then you 'd see what i described in my comment , right ? 
  the problem is that no matter how hard you try to make intuitive sense out of this , you can not . 
  human brain is n't programmed to intuitively understand four-dimensional space , not just as an abstract concept . 
  there were studies that found that human brain can mirror 2d drawings faster than it can mirror 3d drawings -- the explanation is because the brain achieves mirroring 2d drawings as rotation through the third dimension ( rotation is performed at similar speed ) , while it can not mirror 3d objects by performing a rotation through the fourth dimension . 
  so it 's an actual cognitive limitation of human brain . 
  there could perhaps be some tricks around it , but not by simply projecting everything down to 3d . 
  fairly simple design ? 
  nope . 
  most flags , even the more ornate ones , use just a couple of ( usually ) basic colours . 
  this flag has three different hues of blue , even placed one upon another . 
  also , ornate designs in flags are not geometric , but depictions of things . 
  not to mention the small details like the three stripes between the top and bottom parts of the flag , and the writing on the flag . 
  nope . 
  also , / r/vexillology . 
  female body fat is very specific to humans , yes . 
  but the venus sculptures are most likely just an exaggeration , fertility symbols . 
  actually , [ kim jong nam ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kim_jong-nam ) was disinherited and exiled in 2001 after attempting to use a fake chinese passport to visit disneyland in japan .

  he went on to become so traumatised that he ended up greentexting on 4chan . 
  i 'd say they 're armed to the teeth .

  [ i was where you are right now three years ago . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idhtnpgpldc ) ( i 'm 20 now ), 
  seriously , you remind me of myself . 
  how old are you ? 
  she was my classmate . 
  when it hit me that i 'm a failure of a man , at first i started getting terrible mood swings , ranging from severe depression to panic attacks and euphoria . 
  then , summer came , i had some time completely alone , and i realized that i should perhaps improve myself first . 
  get a hobby , start doing some sports ( i started road cycling ; i see you 're working out , just do n't stop ) , and set some life goals . 
  once you 've clearly defined what and who you are , start with some self-control practices . 
  i went on nofap for 6 months , which made me realise that i should be the one in control of my desires , and not vice-versa . 
  the next summer i got a girl for the first time . 
  we were far from being a perfect fit though ; it took me half a year to realise that , and only after she dumped me . 
  all in all , the experience was disappointing . 
  getting friends can be tough , but two or three people to talk to and go out occasionally is completely enough . 
  just try to find some people with similar interests . 
  the fun thing is , here i am now , not even desiring a relationship of any kind before finishing university , and my best friend is the girl i fell for in the first place . 
  as it turned out , we 're a great fit personality-wise , but i just do n't see anything more than that happening between us . 
  again , i 'm talking from my experience , so what worked for me might not work for you . 
  edit : also , music . 
  i ca n't stress this enough . 
  letting all the intense emotions out through listening music was the most important thing for me . 
  [ some pieces of music still make me cry everytime . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygro05wcndk ), 
  that 's what happens when you let women `` do music '' . 
  he 's not even delusional , it 's just a public act of his . 
  i know that jadwiga of poland was crowned a king , not a queen , because while polish laws had no provision for a queen regnant , it was never explicitly required for a king to be male . 
  this was done to prevent a personal union with hungary from happening . 
  i think he 's expressing his mourning over the extinction of beavers more . 
  / r/ckpolitics /, 
  also , i 've seen either this version , the one with big writing * donetskaya respublika * , or the simple tricolour one . 
  i 've also seen some [ old donetsk oblast flags ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/flag_of_donetsk_oblast.svg/1023px-flag_of_donetsk_oblast.svg.png ) still in use . 
  so , i do n't think there 's really an official version of the flag . 
  unless you have sources stating otherwise . 
   3 ) uses 2-3 basic colors, 
   old : ** no **, 
   new : no, 
  unless you consider buff a basic colour ... 
   / r/traps, 
  [ nice top post there , faggot . 
  i 'm not even checking the other two . 
  i 'm not sure . 
  heraldry does n't support using custom colours , there 's a set of basic colours , tinctures ; i 'd guess that vexillology is similar in that matter , because those colours are easy to recognise even if they 're washed out , so the flag as a whole is more recognisable . 
  though , i ca n't say i do n't like flags that add an unique colour . 
  like latvia , for example . 
  ## \u028c not bluetexting, 
  the colours collectively called `` green '' cover the largest part of visible spectrum ( 495-570 nm of the full range about 400-650 nm ) . 
  borders between colours are arbitrary and depend on languages ; russian , for example , has two words for what english calls `` blue '' ( * goluboy * for sky-blue and * siniy * for sea-blue -- note that both are considered basic colours , not like cyan in english , which can be called blue as well ) , while norse did n't distinguish between blue and black , both were called * bl\u00e1r * . 
  so , it 's not so much that we are able to perceive more shades of green than any other colour , it 's that the largest number of shades are grouped under green , probably because of the association green = plants , so every plant colour is called `` green '' . 
  this does n't really explain anything . 
  if red , orange , yellow , pink and brown were all called the same , that colour would cover the largest part of the spectrum . 
  and , if olive , lime and teal were considered basic colours , green would cover a much smaller range . 
  colours are only defined by the language , there 's nothing intrinsic about them .

  you seriously should start with your balls . 
  got ta spread dem pheromones . 
  some guy on 4chan did an experiment last year . 
  results were positive , but someone found out about the experiment . 
  also , he 's not sure whether it was placebo or real . 
  he did another experiment last january . 
  also , since this is 4chan , it 's completely unclear how much of it is bullshit and how much of it actually happened . 
  looking at the dynasty map , there are quite some independent belfitt rajas as well . 
  how many independent realms do they hold actually ? 
  oh , and the s\u00f6ze bordergore .

  [ oh , i think it works just fine when drawn .

  take the [ flag of myanmar ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/flag_of_myanmar.svg/1800px-flag_of_myanmar.svg.png ) as reference . 
  i 'd say about half to two-thirds flag height is optimal .
