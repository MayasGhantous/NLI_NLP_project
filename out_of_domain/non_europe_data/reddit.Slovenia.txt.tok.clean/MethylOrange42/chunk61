  your flag is longer in proportions , so the star can be a bit larger , but full height is a but too much . 
  also , you may want to straighten the points . 
  draw a regular pentagon and then connect the corners , inkscape 's star tool is kind of useless if you want to create regular star-polygons . 
   while being extremely high, 
  that sounded kinda wrong too . 
  huh , and i thought i was weird .

  this is how we do it in slovenia too . 
  if someone is lagging behind , everyone slows down , no ? 
  it 's not like they have n't changed genetically in those 19 million years at all . 
  actually , the fact that the two populations have been separated for that long was calculated from the degree of genetic divergence . 
  they only did n't evolve , because they did n't have to adapt to the environment , so the changes remained random and undirected . 
  just like the tuatara . 
  they have n't changed much in the last 220 million years ( as evidenced by fossil findings ) , but this does n't mean they are genetically the same . 
  they just did n't evolve , because there was no environmental pressure for this to happen .

   china should be killing itself . 
  it 's not . 
  do n't tell me you have n't yet seen any videos of brutality in china . 
  does n't evolve mean specifically to develop a characteristic by a genetic change ? 
  so , since there 's no change in characteristics , you could argue that they did n't evolve , even if there was a genetic drift ? 
   be , you will .

  people who speak turkish in europe mostly speak it as their native language . 
  they 're most likely counted as natively bilingual . 
  yeah , someone argued that, 
   kill , pillage and muh dick your neighbors because fuck cooperation, 
  is exactly what the glorified norse did all the time . 
  oh , the infamous first contact of norse and american natives in vinland , when thorvald eriksson killed eight of them on first contact . 
  needless to say , the `` skr\u00e6lings '' were pissed off . 
  i think this is from gr\u00e6nlendinga saga . 
  if norse greenlanders established a trade contact instead , history might take a different course ...

  really ? 
  in retrospective , 14 year old me might actually like shit like that . 
  you know , living in your own world , with a protective bubble of self imposed labels . 
  luckily , there was no tumblr back then , so i did n't go on and write embarrassing stuff about myself . 
  then , i grew up . 
  it 's much more alarming that a 21 year old woman is still so stuffed up that she clings to childish shit like that . 
  so , technically , i 'm gray-heterosexual , because i 'm not attracted to all women ?

  i do n't know , regarding sexuality i only remember that i was horny as fuck back then , and that i googled for bestiality once . 
  i especially found dolphins fascinating . 
  but yes , i 'd agree , it 's not healthy .

  there 's a poll whether we believe op or if it 's just an elaborate ruse . 
  the design is somewhat based on the designs of our national sports team jerseys : [ ( association ) football ] ( http://www.sloveniatimes.com/modules/uploader/uploads/aktualno/podobe1/64976432_slovenija.jpg ) , [ hockey ] ( http://olympics.cbc.ca/mm/photo/photo/general/04/59/23/45923_g08_w01.jpg ) . 
  it 's featuring the colour green , which recently came to be perceived as a slovenian national colour , and triglav as the central motif . 
  [ i 've also redesigned the coat of arms a while back  ( http://i.imgur.com/hmdatgw.png ) it uses the same three colours as primaries . 
  the dexter side is the styrian/carantanian panther , the sinister side is the carniolan eagle .

  oh , and if you want flipped genders , to make sure you do n't misgender them :, 
  ^ ( ( note the gendered definite articles !, 
  more reminded . 
  i designed this flag along with the coat of arms 3 months ago , but i was n't quite satisfied with it . 
  but i ca n't think of anything better that would both use those three colours and include triglav ( because it 's no longer on the coat of arms ) . 
  i like traditional coats of arms . 
  [ including more than just styria and carniola ( the oldest heraldic symbols of slovenian lands , actualy , and the only really recognisable ones ) would be an overkill ... ] ( http://www.grboslovje.si/shramba13/drzavni-zgodovinski-grb-srednji.gif ),

  / u/copin920 , if you 're interested . 
  the player created characters were made to be op , so they do n't die out too soon and to make it more interesting . 
  what 's the point in creating characters , if they do n't make it ? 
  so it 's not really a sign of how the game is balanced . 
  technically , those are pngs , and pngs file format stores separate pixels . 
  so they 're pixelated anyway, 
  now , if those were svgs instead , that would be a different story ... 
  i would n't mind applying for rhino either ,
