  he 's the deceiver , he 's opposed to the other \u00c6sir .

  eh , one could argue that the main story is mostly going on on planets with approximately the same g-force . 
  what i found more irksome is that :, 
  1 . they all have the same time of day ( if it 's night on one planets , it 's night everywhere , and if the sun sets on one planet , it sets everywhere -- especially noticeable in ep . 
  ii and iii , where there are multiple storylines on different planets going on simultaneously ), 
  2 . if they have more than one moon , they 're always close to each other in the sky .

  of course you 're not allowed to borrow money from jews . 
  the torah ( = pentateuch ) forbids granting loans involving interest to other jews . 
  in other words , since they ca n't charge you usurious loans , they rather do n't lend you money at all . 
  mongols only seriously invaded russia in 1235 , 8 years after genghis 's death , under his son \u00d6gedei . 
  genghis did venture into modern day ukraine in 1223 , defeating kiev and galicia-volhynia in the battle of the kalka river , but he did n't continue his conquest , because he still had to deal with cumans and volga-bulgars on the ural . 
  nah , he only killed the stupid jews . 
  natural selection , you know . 
  this is why they have such a disproportionate number of nobel laureates , only the smart ones survived . 
  austro-bavarian , actually . 
  austrians and bavarians are culturally closer to each other than to other germans , and tyroleans are part of this continuum . 
  but since austria is independent and bavaria is part of germany , bavarians are usually grouped with germans and austrians are considered separate , or they 're all lumped together as germans . 
  ( note : i 'm neither austrian nor bavarian , so this is n't just some irredentist rambling . ), 
  what about culture ? 
  ethnicity is n't only about ancestry or citizenship , it 's also about the traditions , language , and other cultural aspects . 
  in short , you pronounce it in same manner as / s / , but at the sides of the tongue ( instead of the tip ) , where / l / is pronounced . 
  i 'm quite sure this article has been linked on 4chan 's / pol / a few days ago , so those comments are / pol / circlejerking . 
  compared to reddit ? 
  definitely . 
  especially the notion of decay of society is quite strong there , and white pride threads appear quite often . 
  but there are also counterjerk threads . 
  but most people on / pol / ( that actually take time to have a serious debate ) refuse the notion of left and right wing anyway . 
  it 's far too simplistic to just make a simple dichotomy in fields of politics . 
  are libertarians right wing because they support free job and education market and lower taxes instead of social support , or left wing because they support right to abortion , decriminalization of marijuana and same-sex marriage ? 
  or , more controversially , was the nsdap right wing because it was aggressively traditionalist and nationalist , or left wing because they supported the plight of the workers and large scale state planning and spending ? 
  it 's easy to draw such a line in usa , where there 's only two major parties ( which actually switched their standing places in the 1920s , but that 's another story ) . 
  but politics is more complex than just picking the side and then supporting everything your wing embodies . 
  `` the ` cl ' sound '' , however , is how 'll ' is pronounced in icelandic , well , more like ` tl ' , actually . 
  ek 0.1.5 is compatible with ck2 2.1.4 ( 64-bit only ) -- but i guess you should have the correct ck2 version ?

  ^ ( ( do n't van me ) ^ ), 
  that 's quite accurate actually . 
  but in slovenian , the first e is more open ( like it 's pronounced in english ) , and the second more close ( think of german e or french word-final \u00e9 ) . 
  the phrase is grammatically correct in bosnian as well , but i 'm not sure if it 's used idiomatically . 
  some people insist that by `` little girls '' he means midgets .

  muslim nation ? 
  so , i guess we should conform to the rules of middle eastern heraldry then . 
  first , historically the mongols have n't split after genghis khan 's death yet . 
  they were still acting as a single entity under \u00d6gedei khan until his death in 1241 . 
  so the golden horde and the ilkhanate should n't destroy each other until that date ( or perhaps make it an event that fires sometime after 1240 ) , they 're still both vassals to the khagan . 
  regarding religion , mongol hordes were religiously heterogeneous when they arrived already . 
  some have converted to buddhism before they arrived in europe , and there 's been a nestorian minority in mongolia and china ever since the 7th century . 
  perhaps the best way to implement this is to give spawned mongol characters different starting religions . 
  for example , the khagan \u00d6gedei khan and batu khan of the golden horde , while h\u00fcleg\u00fc khan of the ilkhanate was nestorian and converted to buddhism later . 
  ( the h\u00fcleg\u00fc and batu spawned by the game appear too early ; they were still children when mongols first arrived ), 
  but i 'm not quite sure how this would screw with the balance in the game .
