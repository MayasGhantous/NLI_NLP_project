  einstein came in with a solution , proposing that time needs to be `` rotated '' as well . 
  but , how , you say ?!, 
  has n't newtonian mechanics been proven ?!, 
  you see , they did n't prove anything , to be honest . 
  newton just wrote down some equations that agreed with what they saw . 
  there was no hard proof present . 
  a bitche , to be exact . 
  yeah , i remember when previous president of slovenia stopped the queen at the welcoming ceremony before the anthems played . 
  the media made quite a scene out of it , how inappropriate that was . 
  how would you know anyway ? 
  slightly related , outrage actually should n't be pronounced out-rage , but so that it rhymes with damage . 
  they 're both french loanwords of the same construction . 
  the etymologically incorrect pronunciation is the norm though .

  did you just misspell caesar in two different ways .

  also , alois , and slovenian lojze . 
  conducting an experiment is n't a proof in mathematical sense of the word , though . 
  and , if you do n't conduct an experiment over an entire range of parameters , you can always miss some points , where something that 's not included in theory is going on . 
  relativity , for example , at very high velocities . 
  also , a mathematical proof is worth nothing if the premises behind it are incorrect . 
  i can derive an infallible mathematical proof , but then it turns out that nature does n't work that way . 
  there was no mistake in my derivation -- but apparently i missed something . 
  so , a mathematical proof does n't prove anything in physics , after you perform it , you need to check if it fits actual measurements . 
  there was completely nothing wrong with the mathematical derivation of classical mechanics , yet it ca n't describe movement very high velocity particles . 
  but yes , this is more of a philosophical debate about what is a proof . 
  but i think every scientist should be aware of the fact that science is n't about hard-proving anything , it 's only about checking if our theories agree with what we see . 
  if they do n't , scrap them or find out where they work reasonably well . 
  if they do , use them . 
  in case you have n't noticed , the vocalist is a woman . 
  antarctica already has some rivers ; [ this is onyx river in wright valley ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-glzu4ogvje8/txk65qfregi/aaaaaaaaafi/nkphj5oodbq/s1600/p1020537.jpg ) , [ it 's actually close to mcmurdo station .

  i think the game gives the trait inbred if the parents have too similar dna . 
  dna is given as a 9-character string , you can see it in charinfo , and 4 characters are inherited from each parent , one is random . 
  that said , the inbred trait thus models genetic disorders that occur from rare recessive genes in actual mendelian genetics . 
  if both parents carry a recessive gene , the child might get one copy from both , causing expression of the gene . 
  this is more likely to happen if the parents are related , because it 's more likely that they share the same bad recessive gene . 
  the other genetic disorders in ck2 instead behave more like dominant genes , which do n't need to come in pairs to express themselves . 
  they occur seemingly at random with random mutations , but can be passed on . 
  the question here is how did he become a despot of venice . 
  i thought only republics can hold the king-tier title there . 
  tell that to the kingdom of jerusalem . 
  also ;, 
   simple divisions of the field are considered to be beside each other , not one on top of the other ; so the rule of tincture does not apply . 
  tolkien also invented the nerd before it even existed . 
  bilbo is described as the hobbit that stayed inside and read books , did n't socialise , he also never got married ( most likely a virgin too ) , and that as a child he was always running around playing dragonslaying and similar adventure stuff . 
  he was also a colossal beta at the beginning of the story . 
  so , bilbo is in a way a precognition of tolkien fans . 
  this is from 2008 , but apparently it is legit . 
  they changed the packing afterwards . 
   i saw the movie for a birthday party when i was 8, 
  wait , what ? 
  how old are you ? 
  or , oh well , i guess i should check when the movie came out first ... 
   the hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy ( 2005 ), 
  time flies . 
   punchline in the title, 
  still had a giggle, 
  they do n't . 
  other scientists name stuff they discovered after them . 
  their original paper was titled `` stars with degenerate neutron cores '' . 
  but this is not a proper name , just a description . 
  to be honest , this sounds like badly written soviet propaganda . 
  a great example of poe 's law . 
  emperor larentarious oharmalitacious xxiv the magnanimous when i feel like ruling the universe . 
  that 'd be * bratje * in slovene . 
  there 's an article ( in slovene ) regarding which masculine o-stem nouns take * - je * as a plural ending , instead of * - i * :, 
  what about nordic flags with more than 3 colours ? 
  with unusual colours , like purple , for example ?

  i did n't notice there 's a fellow molecule-kin among the mods . 
  quick googling revealed [ this ] ( http://amateurheralds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=36&amp;t=477 ) . 
  there are also some other debates about this day elsewhere . 
  it looks like some amateur heralds are trying to push this day to raise awareness . 
  catholic priests seem to have lesser chance of getting prostate cancer . 
  i 'm quite sure they fap less , not more , even if they do n't abstain completely . 
  i think being able to cum would make the boy arguably too old . 
   in dexter chief a horseshoe surrounding < a flower i do n't recognise ) azure, 
   first problem , you 're charging a colour on a colour , and you 're not supposed to do that . 
  you could switch them to argent ( silver or white ) , or to gold , or describe the flower as being `` proper '' , and in its natural colour . 
  it 's fine , because it 's fimbriated or , so it 's not colour on colour , but colour on metal on colour . 
  the same goes for the emblem in base , fimbriated argent . 
  it also reminds me of the now obsolete infamous chinese tradition of foot binding ... 
  summerfags pls go . 
  fimbriation is supposed to be thin , but there is no set thickness as far as i 'm aware . 
  it should be thick enough to be easily discernible . 
  but it would perhaps be best to keep it the same thickness as the cotise in your case , just stylistically . 
  however , i should note that fimbriation is usually done only on simple charges . 
  so , while your blazon does n't break the rule of tincture this way , the usage of fimbriation itself in your case would be questionable for some . 
  that would n't really bother me though . 
  probably the young part along with it . 
  what would you think if some random lass appeared and declared that she 's somehow better than all your seasoned generals ? 
  to be honest , this is actually the russian flag , defaced with the home guard emblem . 
  the usual heraldic bend goes down . 
  the bend sinister goes up . 
  most flags use the bend sinister though .
