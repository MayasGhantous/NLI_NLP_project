  perhaps a branch from sunbather saying `` a bit less metal though '' . 
  last album is more shoegaze and less post-metal , though . 
  we need a matronymic as well then . 
  you forgot `` blackened '' and that part where the singer goes `` whoooo-ooo-ooooo-ooahh '', 
  he should post  hfw he realises he got cucked, 
  oy vey , it 's like the shoah all over again . 
  reminds me of [ his imperial and royal apostolic majesty , franz joseph i , by the grace of god emperor of austria , king of hungary , bohemia , king of lombardy and venice , of dalmatia , croatia , slavonia , galicia , lodomeria and illyria ; king of jerusalem etc. , archduke of austria ; grand duke of tuscany and cracow , duke of lorraine , of salzburg , styria , carinthia , carniola and of the bukovina ; grand prince of transylvania ; margrave of moravia ; duke of upper and lower silesia , of modena , parma , piacenza and guastalla , of auschwitz , zator and teschen , friuli , ragusa ( dubrovnik ) and zara ( zadar ) ; princely count of habsburg and tyrol , of kyburg , gorizia and gradisca ; prince of trent ( trento ) and brixen ; margrave of upper and lower lusatia and in istria ; count of hohenems , feldkirch , bregenz , sonnenberg , etc.

  i like how they use `` lightyears '' as a unit of time . 
  you use fractions . 
  good luck expressing any divisor that is not divisible by 2 or 5 in our decimal system ,

  if you really want to write 1/7 , you could as well just write `` one part of seven '' and it gets across . 
  finns = mongols is a meme . 
  the main reason is that finnish language is uralic and not indo-european , which makes them `` invaders from central asia '' . 
  google `` finns mongols '' if you want to know more . 
  [ the curiosities of heraldy , by mark antony lower ( 1844 ) ] ( http://www.gutenberg.org/files/38951/38951-h/38951-h.htm ) -- has been posted on this sub before . 
  if i recall correctly , vassalage and fiefs were n't hereditary until the 10th century . 
  the king would grant a landholding and a title as a reward for loyalty , but it did n't necessarily pass on to vassal 's sons . 
  some mongols actually were nestorians though . 
  filthy degenerates .

  [ jagiellonian dynasty ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jagiellonian_dynasty ) of poland-lithuania consistently had 50 years ( or even more ) generation gaps . 
  since this was in a time when people married in their teens , there 's serious talk whether they actually matured slower than most people . 
  jogaila ( w\u0142adys\u0142aw ii ) was probably born around 1351 , he was succeded by his son w\u0142adys\u0142aw iii born in 1424 , while his father algirdas was born in 1296 . 
  that 's 128 years gap between two generations . 
  i just wonder what karlings are up to !, 
  you do n't have to do this 12 times a year . 
  period is your body saying `` come on you idiot conceive a child '' as your great-great-grandmothers did every year . 
   is that what we would assume about men if every time they came , their balls ached unbearably for 3 or so days ? 
  if men had the prob , there 'd be millions of dollars thrown at it , pain pills flying through the air , and nurses hired round the clock for their care . 
  funny thing is , there is a completely normal condition , a natural function , that will cause this , but it does n't last for three days , usually for about an hour . 
  it 's called blue balls , and it can happen after a prolonged period of arousal ( about three hours in my experience ) with no release . 
  i talked to a friend of mine who studies medicine . 
  he informed me that blue balls are a hoax and that i 'm lying to him because it 's just a plot to convince girls to feel bad and have sex . 
  he did n't believe me that after a date and some making out in a park for last three hours my balls got swollen and it hurt to walk . 
  i experienced it , bro , quit bullshitting me . 
  so , if anything , we 're ignoring men here . 
  but i guess patriarchy hurts men too . 
  if you want a perfect drug ... the closest you can get is l-theanine/caffeine combination . 
  most bad effects of caffeine get cancelled out by l-theanine ( l-theanine calms you down , as opposed to the stimulant properties of caffeine ) while both improve cognition , awareness and physical performance . 
  oh , and the combination is already present naturally in green tea . 
  that 's how i get my daily fix , and what the chinese have been doing for the last 4000 years .

  i 'm still waiting for kanem-bornu empire and connection between eastern and western parts of africa -- which would actually fit on the current map . 
  what 's the matter , do you want that in superior metric units ? 
  because that 's about 268 kj of energy . 
  carbs are about 4 kcal per gram , and since there 's 16g of carbs this sums up to 64 kcal . 
  so i 'd say it 's carbs . 
  shady stuff usually does n't have any energy value anyway . 
  actually , one calorie is energy to heat 1 gram of water 1 \u00b0 c. 
  which is 1ml . 
  one kilocalorie is energy to heat one kilogram ( or 1l ) of water 1 \u00b0 c. 
  and yes , it 's kilo-calorie . 
  that 's why it 's written kcal , not cal . 
  ( though some people use just cal , with capital c ),

  there 's a closely related disease , [ yaws ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yaws ) , which is native to africa . 
  they even found a [ strain of yaws in guyana that is very similar to syphilis ] ( http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/columbus-brought-syphilis-to-europe-study-shows/article666408/ ) . 
  yaws , however , is n't sexually transmitted . 
  but i guess it would n't be a stretch that great pox in the game could instead be a strain of yaws , and not american syphilis .
