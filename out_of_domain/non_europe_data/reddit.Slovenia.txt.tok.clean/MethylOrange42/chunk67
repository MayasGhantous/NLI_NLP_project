  papua has several native language isolates as well . 
  but pretty much everything else is austronesian . 
  yeah , but even papua is ( mostly ) austronesian in coastal regions . 
  non-austronesian languages are mostly spoken inland . 
  yeah , i checked the coordinates , the island is right off the coast of papua which is not too far in the middle of the pacific . 
  so i guess an older native population ( like andamanese , but modernised ) would be possible . 
  this was also before high-carb diet and sedentary lifestyle , i guess that 's the main culprits . 
  eh , saying `` manmade climate change '' is very indefinite . 
  i 'm quite sure there 's completely no refutation that cities in valleys or basins , which are manmade , have an effect on local air circulation , and smoke causes denser fog which means temperature inversion breaks up harder . 
  this does have an effect on local climate , because there 's less sunlight over year . 
  imagine the same thing on a huge scale , and you have china . 
  anyway , i personally think that deforestation has much greater effect on global climate than co \u2082 emissions . 
  the debate should n't be whether or not climate change is real , but what actually causes it , so we do n't make stupid decisions trying to prevent it .

  i think i read a theory somewhere , a part of which was that c-3po was force sensitive as well , citing as evidence his ability to communicate with pretty much everyone and that ewoks recognised him as a god , and also that him convincing owen lars to buy r2-d2 was a prime example of a jedi mind trick . 
  `` superior '' and `` inferior '' are subjective value judgments , when the term is used broadly . 
  you can objectively state that something is superior or inferior in a certain aspect , but overall , it 's ridiculous to talk about superiority . 
  so , the title is bad , while the article does talk about cognitive superiority -- but again , what is superior and what is inferior ? 
  is high-functioning autism superior or inferior to neuronormativity ? 
  oh yeah , it 's this one !, 
  it 's long since i read this , so it kind of slipped out of my memory . 
  i think it should be instead added as an ambition , with an event chain leading to possible culture conversion . 
  flipping the culture in a day sounds too gamey . 
  yeah , that 's what i 'd do probably .

  i have an extra palm line on both hands ... it 's more pronounced on left one though . 
  i checked what chiromancy says about it ; apparently it should be a minor line ( girdle of venus , linked with emotional intelligence and ability to manipulate ) , but it looks like a full prominent line on my left palm . 
  to be honest , venus is earth-like by current standards . 
  it is made of rock , decently sized , it has an atmosphere , it is geologically active ( somewhat ) , and orbits on the border of sun 's habitable zone . 
   yes , we 're all aware that under our current understanding of physics something with mass can not go faster than light . 
  however , theoretical physicists have already proposed a space-bending mechanism that forms a bubble of space that propagates at ftl velocities , without breaking the speed of light -- because it 's the space itself that is moving , not matter . 
  too bad it currently involves tremendous amounts of energy and possibility of negative energy density . 
  however , nasa has already announced `` warp-field experiments '' that will explore the possibility of this theory ... 
  well , tibetans invented a very unique way of preventing splitting land under agnatic gavelkind : they invented a fraternal polyandrous marriage , so brothers married the same woman . 
  that way , the households would n't split .

  the use of coa was abolished by communists , and it was restored in 2006 . 
  the mountains represent the volcanoes ( koryaksky , avachinsky and vilyuchik ( ? ) ), 
  near the city , anchors represent petropavlovsk-kamchatskiy status as a sea port , and the supporters are st. peter and st. paul , patron saints and namesakes of the city .

  it definitely sounds fake latin . 
  never , absolutely never use the prepositions if not necessary . 
  just * romae * would be enough . 
  also , i have no idea how you derived the word * sultanici * ; ranks are usually formed by adding * - atus * : * dux *  * ducatus * , * pontifex *  * pontificatus * , therefore * sultanus *  * sultanatus * . 
  i 'd go with * sultanatus romanu ~ ~ s ~ ~ m * , with the adjective , if you want to translate that to latin . 
  edit : looks like * sultan * was translated into medieval latin as * soldanus * , so * soldanatus romanu ~ ~ s ~ ~ m * .

  it 's same in scotland , but marks of cadency are different . 
  germany does have family coat of arms , but different branches of the same large family ( with same surname ) might have different coats of arms . 
  polish heraldry , however , is clan-based , which are shared by multiple families , and there 's only about 200 different coats of arms . 
  anyway , to find a legit coat of arms , you 'd have to trace ancestry , as coats of arms are originally granted to individuals ( the exception being poland ) , and then passed on to either a single heir ( england and scotland ) or to all sons ( germany and france , after napoleon 's decree in 1810 ) . 
  i know , i 'm slovene . 
  besides albanians , the borders between other nations were blurry as well until yugoslavia . 
  the final division lines between slovenes and croats neatly follow the national borders , even though people from border regions ( istria , zagorje , me\u0111imurje , prekmurje ) actually spoke intermediate dialects and were also culturally part of both nationalities . 
  macedonians were separated from bulgarians in a similar way after ww1 . 
  serbs , croats , and bosniaks , however , were of different religions , so they were rather divided by religion where it was unclear .

  technically , there were free black people in usa even before 1819 . 
  they were either freed slaves , descendants of the first blacks that were brought to america as indentured servants before slavery was established , or mixed race children of free mothers . 
  lack of legal status of most black people as persons was n't just because they were black , but because they were slaves ( until 1850s when southern states started enacting various `` fugitive slave '' laws ) . 
  also , the northern states abolished slavery around 1800 , so the blacks living there were free and therefore had full rights .
