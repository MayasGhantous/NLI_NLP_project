  good job , journalists . 
  why do n't you at least , please , stop using your overly elaborate figures of speech where it 's obvious that you have no idea what those words mean ? 
  check your spelling in game, 
  first , technically i do n't think he 's black , more likely he 's maori . 
  second , we know that during the first age `` swarthy men '' came to beleriand from the east . 
  those are the easterlings of silmarillion . 
  they were dark-skinned and broad in build , unlike edain . 
  two powerfull chieftains of them are named , b\u00f3r and ulfang , and they allied sons of f\u00ebanor . 
  ulfang 's men , however , betrayed them and deflected to morgoth , who in turn , betrayed them and did n't award them vast lands he promised . 
  after morgoth was defeated , they fled across ered luin , and some stayed in eriador . 
  so it would be possible that small numbers of those `` swarthy men '' survived there until the war of the ring . 
  esgaroth was a trade republic of some kind , similar to venice . 
  they would probably trade dwarven products all the way to the sea of rh\u00fbn , which would mean contact with people living there . 
  tolkien did n't write much about the peoples living there , some of them might as well be darker skinned , just like the people of far harad .

  ( they 're swedish ), 
  also cognate with ` sordid ' ( dirty -- either morally or physically ) via latin * sordidus * . 
  eh , what cognates mean can become unrelated to the original meaning . 
  for example , persian * \u062f\u06cc\u0648 * ( * d\u00eav * ) means ` demon ' , while it is cognate to latin * deus * , ` god ' . 
  or , * otrok * in slovene means ` child ' , but in slovak and czech it means ` slave ' . 
  does n't mean that i , as a slovene , will abuse my children and use them for child labour . 
  he used the word ` swarthy ' not because it is cognate to ` sordid ' , but because it actually has ` dark-skinned ' as its primary meaning . 
  looks like the ai learned the `` depose yourself to unite the karlings '' strategy . 
  reforming tengri feels a bit weird in my opinion since about half of actual tengri area is actually outside map bounds , in siberia and mongolia . 
  ^ ( edit : i have no idea how i ended up commenting in a 3 month old thread ), 
  hulagu 's mother and primary wife were nestorian , so was his closest military assistant ( marshal , if you want to use ck2 terminology ) kitbuqa . 
  so it 's quite likely hulagu was nestorian as well -- though he did convert , to buddhism , later in life . 
  ^ ( edit : i have no idea how i ended up commenting in a 3 month old thread ), 
  yes , and ? 
  looks like you 're looking for the most bizarre clues just to declare tolkien a racist . 
  which is unsubstantiated , unless you believe that his stories describe a battle of light vs. dark as an allegory for fight of white europeans against oppression and aggression of barbarian black african hordes . 
  i wish you good luck . 
  i wonder how long you 'll be able to keep free speech there before you either get branded a `` hate sub '' or get flooded over by the usual hivemind . 
  if you ask me , reddit is n't a good platform for free speech , exactly because of the voting system which forces forward whatever the sub community currently supports and hides everything that is against the hivemind . 
  this is n't that bad as long as the community is small enough that you can still read everything ; once it grows too large , this becomes impossible and people will read only what is upvoted . 
  inbred traits are expression of recessive genes that usually remain `` silent '' because you need two corrupt copies of the gene . 
  since both parents need to carry this gene , it 's much more likely for this to happen if they 're actually related .

  [ zaphod beeblebrox says hi ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/72/mark_wing-davey_as_zaphod_beeblebrox.jpg ), 
  i intended to submit a design into the contest , but i did n't manage to finish it as i was n't at home for last two weeks . 
  so , i guess you 're still accepting submissions ? 
  i 'll probably finish it some time this week . 
  perhaps i 'll even try to draw it by hand instead of mashing up svg from wikipedia . 
  i never actually learned serbo-croatian , but as a slovene , i do understand it , and i must say that the wording looks strange to me . 
  i can see from your post history that you do n't live here ( in ex-yu ) , so i 'm not sure if this is because i do n't speak it properly , or because you made a mistake . 
  firstly , i 'd expect gnjati ** \u0107 ** , with a \u0106 . i 'd also expect * uvijek * to come before * \u0107e se * . 
  feel free to correct me , if i 'm wrong . 
  [ sometimes , a very specific design can work quite nicely as a coat of arms , if you ask me .

   it looks real shitty in this font style, 
  i see . 
  but , you can get around this by writing the text without the diacritics , and adding them separately . 
  it 's a bit of a workaround , but works good enough , if you 're not dealing with too much text . 
  they should carve this into the face of a mountain . 
  i used the [ traditional patterns ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/lahu_girls.jpg ) as reference ; the colour black is part of ( black ) lahu identity , and i kept the other three colours in a pattern at the hoist , similar to the flags of belarus and kazakhstan . 
   alexander the great ? 
  married , had a son . 
  not to mention that no ancient sources explicitly mentioned that he had a homosexual relationship with anyone , his relationship with hephaestion would perhaps be better described as bromance . 
  bisexual at most . 
   most roman emperors ? 
  `` most '' is a weasel word . 
  besides elagabalus ( and if you want to count nero , who honestly just wanted to engage in everything that was scandalous ) , i ca n't think of any other example . 
   the fucking spartans ?!? 
  not the spartans . 
  it was the sacred band of thebes , consisting of 150 male couples of elite soldiers . 
   bro , do you even history ? 
  do you ? 
  edit : also , he never said that homosexual relationships did n't exist , only that homosexuality was not a part of a person 's identity . 
  just download his torrent, 
  not mixing will preserve the diversity . 
  mixing creates one single brown hodge-podge with no identity of its own . 
  [ `` lol i should also add this pony just because the colour scheme matches as well '' ] ( http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110915190300/mlp/images/f/fb/canterlot_castle_rainbow_dash_3.png ), 
  slovenian here , eating horse meat is normal here ( in my experience ) , but it 's not eaten often , it 's considered special meat , like game . 
  it 's really good if you ask me , a bit similar to beef , but richer in flavour . 
  and darker . 
  human activity has also created new habitats . 
  there has n't been enough time for most animals to adapt , but urban and rural environment are completely new types of habitat that did n't exist before the mankind . 
  and some species took great advantage of those new ecological niches . 
  some of them are animals domesticated by humans , but some are n't , like rats and pigeons . 
  or he was banished and somehow ended up in india . 
  i 've had a game where so many africans were banished and ended up in italy that half of italians were black . 
  they were the main importer of ivory into europe after arabs blocked the trade from africa and india . 
  they sold walrus tusks from greenland as ivory . 
  what about japanese prefecture flags ? 
  a lot of them feature a stylised kana as a central symbol . 
  `` kana '' means any syllabic japanese script , so it covers both hiragana and katakana , and the older system manyogana which uses a set of kanji characters as a syllabic script .

  i 'm pretty sure it was banishment , muslims stormed abyssinia almost immediately that game ( starting 1066 ) . 
  i could trace people back to abyssinia and nubia . 
  king of aragon was black too by 1120 . 
  prosciutto crudo , i think . 
  at least that 's what we call `` pr\u0161ut '' in slovenia is called in italy . 
  one could say that hre was on autonomous vassals crown authority since the interregnum . 
  elephants have nipples between front legs , just like humans . 
  i believe those are massive meat curtains . 
   eugenio, 
  fitting name , though .
