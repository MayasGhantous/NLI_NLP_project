  nope , sable was considered a fur , and furs go on everything . 
  sable ( * sobol ' * ) actually is a species of marten whose black fur was a highly valued luxury .

  the winged lion itself is the symbol of venice because it represents st. mark .

  am i the only one who thinks that the old ( roman ) division was actually superior to current decimal money because there are more possible equal divisions of a pound ( 1/2 , 1/3 , 1/4 , 1/5 , 1/6 , 1/8 , 1/10 , 1/12 ) ? 
  the 17-29 division does n't have that advantage because those are prime numbers and is just retarded .

  [ those were the thebans .

  nope , the symbol has been used in pagan europe for a long time . 
  similar symbols with different number of arms ( usually 3 , 4 , 6 , or 8 ) were used to symbolize the sun or eternity by pretty much all european cultures . 
  those are all related to the indian * svastika * . 
  * v\u00f6lkisch * movements in the 19th century , that were the source of nsdap symbolism and ideology , combined this notion that swastika is pan-indo-european and the idea of aryan race being the progenitors of indo-european language . 
  to them , swastika was the symbol of those aryans that invaded europe , anatolia , india and persia on horses some time during the iron age and , because of their superiority , remained a ruling class over the majority non-aryan population that lived there before , which influenced culture and language of those subdued peoples .

  * quarterly : 1st celeste , snoo 's head proper ; 2nd azure , two pieces of bacon saltirewise proper ; 3rd of the 2nd , envelope argent , fimbriated ( ? ),

  you know what would be perfect ? 
  jari getting a studio deal with two steps from hell . 
  but honestly , i do n't see that happening . 
  tenne is usually more brownish . 
  i think orange is used as a tincture in south african and dutch heraldry . 
  i think it was also featured in the old south african coat of arms , though it could be or as well . 
  though the terms are mostly interchangeable , especially since it 's a non-standard tincture . 
  as for * envelope lined * , probably yes , i could n't think of a proper way to describe it . 
  i know that they were looking for a sound engineer earlier this year , and varien ( check him out , he makes orchestral dubstep stuff ) who applied for it got to do a collaboration with them , so somehow i do n't think a collaboration with them would be impossible . 
  plus , i 'm quite sure he could `` donate '' some spare riffs as base for tsfh songs . 
  also , i think their studio is among the best , they also have a huge top quality sample library ( i think that thomas bergersen also provided sounds for eastwest / quantum leap ) , so somehow they naturally feel like the best choice for a perfectionist . 
  plus , i 'm a big fan of both , so i am a bit biased , 
  check out les friction as well . 
  the reason the words are swapped around ? 
  according to tumblr and people akin to them , it 's because if you say `` person of colour '' , you consider them first persons , and then of colour , but if you say `` coloured people '' you consider them coloured first , and only then people . 
  at least that 's what i gathered . 
  same goes for `` disabled people '' vs. `` people with disabilities '' . 
  same goes for most of those ridiculous hashtags lately . 
  most of them were planted by 4chan , or so i heard . 
  quick , someone should add [ ngoni ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52zbynj7ksa ) to the mix !, 
  you have no idea how awesome is to see him perform with a full band ( ngoni ba ) . 
  him , two sons , i think a brother and two nephews ( on different sized ngonis and percussion ) , and his wife on vocals . 
  one of the best concerts i 've been to . 
  i think it was * cneht * in old english ; but yes , the most important thing to note here is that both sounds were actually pronounced .

  city rome itself is r\u00f3maborg in icelandic ( which is essentially a dialect of old norse ) , and i ca n't find any original norse source naming rome . 
  you should find some info here .

  have n't tried modding the map myself yet though , so if you run into any problems , i ca n't help you . 
  slovene here , `` masculinity '' ( * mo\u0161kost * ) is feminine and `` feminism '' ( * feminizem * ) is masculine as well .

  it 's not a motto , it says `` democratic people 's republic of korea '' : * \uc870\uc120\ubbfc\uc8fc\uc8fc\uc758\uc778\ubbfc\uacf5\ud654\uad6d * . 
  they 're nationalsocialist , technically . 
  the state ideology is juche , which is very nationalistic in its ideas of independence and self-reliance of korean people .

   tfw newfags ca n't linebreak, 
   he does n't know beethoven, 
   tfw it was actually [ s4s ], 
  ebin , simply ebin . 
  improvisation was quite common back then , unlike the rigid practice of classical music in the 20th century . 
  beethoven won many improvisation competitions . 
  the improvised sections in pieces were called cadenza , which were deliberately left in musical pieces to allow performers to show off their skills . 
  very few performers improvise their cadenzas nowadays , and mostly replace them with written-down , ready-to-play sets of cadenzas by various composers , for example , beethoven 's set of cadenzas for mozart 's piano concerto # 20 is performed so often that it 's usually considered a part of the piece itself . 
  ... but `` tamga symbol '' is not a single shape , there are different tamgas . 
  each clan had a different tamga . 
  but it does look similar to the crimean tamga . 
  meh , just make all the empires less stable . 
  there was a historical title of emperor of hispania , but you never learn about it because the kings did n't have the power to de-facto hold the title . 
  perhaps add a rule that an empire dissolves if the emperor ca n't exert his power or something . 
  well , the politics in saudi arabia are quite ck2-esque ...
