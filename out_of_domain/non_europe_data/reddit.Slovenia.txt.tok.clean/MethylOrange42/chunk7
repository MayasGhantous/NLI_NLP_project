  the word `` doubt '' comes from middle english * douten * , which in turn derives from old french * douter * , so , no b here . 
  similarly , `` island '' comes from middle english * iland * or * yland * , which is derived from anglo-saxon * \u012degland * , where the g is silent . 
  so , i appologise for intentionally misleading you . 
  i have made an inexplicable mistake and should be ashamed . 
  oh , cashew just stop it . 
  as a friendly note : one of your comments was duplicated . 
  you may want to delete it . 
  or , keep it to reap double karma . 
  i actually prefer body hair over smooth , as long as it is not too much . 
  even underarm hair . 
  as for upper lip , i do n't mind some puff . 
  i do n't know how to describe where 's the limit though . 
  do n't do it at all . 
  it 's ok that guys make advances , but making them play your games is not a good idea . 
  you may ( you may ; this does n't mean oyu automatically will ) come off as dependent if you start making advances , but this does n't mean that you should just barricade yourself . 
  be friendly and accepting , and that 's about it . 
  you are like a morning mist . 
  you are the sun that illuminates my day ; you shine up the whole world . 
  your eyes are like jewels that sparkle in the cavern of my soul . 
  your smile is like a flower ; beautiful to behold . 
  your voice is like a siren 's that entraps my soul . 
  your hands are delicate yet hold tight to my heart . 
  your voice , so sweet , softens my heart and makes me think there is hope in this world . 
  your beauty gives light to the dark prison room i live in . 
  your eyes bring out the essence of my soul . 
  your shining locks glow like the morning sun . 
  [ they do ... ] ( http://www.style-people.com/baggy-jeans-for-men/baggy-jeans-2 ), 
  foiled again !, 
  [ here , have the original pic . 
  i assume you never had a pet bunny . 
  real fucking clever , you can make a rhyme about shrek . 
  real funny , real cute , i like that , shrek is dreck . 
  you know , there are some people out there , there 's some people , whom shrek matters whole goddamn lot to . 
  and we 're not gon na let him down , we 're not gon na let some asshole who thinks he 's being clever say : `` shrek is dreck . '', 
  cause you know why : shrek is not dreck !, 
  you ... you fucking subhuman piece of shit . 
  oh look , it 's this again . 
  this guy has way too much time on his hands . 
  find all brands of beer that are only sold in one country and start from there . 
  so what happens when a detective loses his job ? 
  does he become an autist or a stalker ? 
  \\    / r/mensrights, 
  we need a proper gypsy metal band . 
  [ trollfest ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmqqaybhtua ) does n't really count . 
  and turisas experimented a bit with [ in the court of jarisleif ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k8sp-xoqiy ) , but we need something on level of [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozd4dpow4a ) . 
  then , it would be great to have west-african folk metal . 
  insane polyrhythmycal drumming . 
  imagine [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhpi4osmit4 ) , with some sheer insanity added . 
  also , there already is incan metal . 
  [ guahaihoque ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bhjssr9bke ) and [ ch ` aska ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_b8xlq7xk30 ) . 
  and , we already had [ mongolian metal ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra2f4ec9bog ) posted here . 
  sometimes , less is more , 
  i recommend you to think about why you think you need to do it . 
  because i believe that , unless you are a freak of nature ( which you are n't , otherwise you would n't ask for advice ) , you should just accept what you are . 
  what is imperfection to someone , is diversity to another person . 
  i look older than i am ( almost 19 now , when i was 17 some people thought i 'm 24 ; i could grow full beard by the time i was 16 and stopped growing a year earlier ( 6 ' 1 '' ) ) , and i prefer women that look younger than their age , but so far , all i 've actually been interested in were actually older than me . 
  all faggots go [ here ] ( http://www.facebook.com/pages/jesus-freaks-asia/143097199189340 ) and join your overlord op xvii the ultra-faggot !, 
  and those single men will be chinese europe colonisation force . 
  imagine 50 + million chinese virgins moving to europe on pretense of economical partnership . 
  i heard rumours that slovenia gave citizenship to over 2000 chinese last year , even though they did not fit the naturalisation criteria . 
  we have been warned . 
  rape is natural in same way as war is natural . 
  once you defeat the opposing tribe 's men , you rape their women . 
  it was always so . 
  i 'm not saying this makes rape acceptable though . 
  especially not in a civilised society , where there are no enemies to attack and raid . 
  it is - for now . 
  and slovenia is not a big country either . 
  2000 is 0.1 % of whole population , and that happened in only one year . 
  third age total war is awesome . 
  if only they found a way around aging , which is hardcoded into the game ... 
  i do go to 4chan , but i see this subreddit as a kind of `` best of '' of 4chan . 
  it 's easy to miss something interesting on 4chan , because threads overfill or die too soon . 
  however , here you can see what has happened on 4chan , for example , during the night (  implying i sleep at night ) . 
  in an user-friendly reddit environment . 
  besides , you can get karma here . 
  who would say no to karma ? 
  le n\u00e9groid, 
  / r/trollscience, 
  feels nice to know i 'm using all 3 right ones . 
  does anyone know if brokencyde are legit or are they just trolling , like [ one morning left ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylrnhrt5u2e ) ? 
  i 'm on your side . 
  i think that smaller society means much more humane social relations . 
  we used to be friends with our neighbours , now we do n't even know half of them . 
  and having small business also does not allow exploitation that we see from huge companies . 
  and instead of made in china crap we would have quality craftsmanship . 
  hell , it 's hard to find a competent watchmaker or a tailor where i live because the market is over-saturated with cheap stuff . 
  plus , i think that war connects people , because they actually need to cooperate in order to succeed . 
  [ \u02c8\u0261e\u02d0.\u0283ta\u026a\u032fk.pan.\u02a6\u0250 ], 
  oh look , a faggot, 
  this ca n't be true ; in last 6 months , at least 4 socks went missing , and i still do n't have enough hangers . 
  turisas - stand up and fight, 
  t\u00fdr - by the light of the northern star, 
  chthonic - takasago army ( chinese folk/symphoblack metal ), 
  brymir - breath fire to the sun, 
  helengard - helengard, 
  that 's off the top of my head , there 's much more ... 
   \u00e6 \u00fe \u00f8 \u00f0, 
  ... does summoning count as black metal ? 
  cause you ca n't be more tolkien-inspired than summoning .
