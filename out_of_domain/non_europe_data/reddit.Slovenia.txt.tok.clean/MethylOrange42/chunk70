  some dynasties are hardcoded into the game , and may appear in place of randomly created characters . 
  rice production releases about 100 million tonnes of methane a year , which is about the same as releases due to livestock . 
  also , while meat consumes a lot more calories to produce , remember that humans do n't eat the whole plant , wihle farm animals do . 
  which effectively converts useless calories into useful calories . 
  especially in areas where agriculture would be unfeasible due to climate , or rugged terrain .

  after finishing high school , i showed up next year dressed as a professor , complete with glasses , trimmed beard and tucked-in shirt . 
  i actually managed to convince some freshmen that i 'm a professor . 
   sable is treated as both a metal and color depending on need, 
  i 'd rather say that it 's considered a fur , which is n't far-fetched , since it 's actually named after black fur of sable ( the animal ) . 
  furs can go everywhere . 
  of course you can decline harriet . 
  you just need to get creative a bit . 
  the problem is simply that it 's not on the list . 
  it 's * pandoravirus * . 
  \u064a\u0627 is an interjection , otherwise the translation is correct . 
  ummm ... / r/heraldry for coats of arms, 
  that 's because she had to cut her soft drinks to consume less calories . 
  actually , he was named after a guy who claimed descent from the last peruvian native king and thus took his name .

  if you ask me , north korea is more nationalsocialist right now , despite its historical connection with soviet and maoist socialism . 
  juche ideology is strongly based on notion of independence and self-reliance of korean nation , and the demagogic enemies are n't the rich capitalists , but foreign imperialists .

  semen is unclean , you 're supposed to wash your dick before going to mosque if you had sex beforehand . 
  ( or if you 're a sorry loser if you fapped ), 
  a route with fourteen stations depicting jesus 's crucifixion . 
  the faithful would walk ( sometimes on their knees ) from one station to another and stop at each to pray , to commemorate jesus 's sacrifice and suffering . 
  usually those were constructed to go uphill , to replicate the uphill path to golgotha . 
  good friday processions may also take place there . 
  though i 'm not sure when the practice started , 800 ad might be a bit early . 
  nope , they 're socialists with strong patriotic feelings .

  ( thank you wikipedia -- though i still do n't know what the `` chow '' part is ), 
  `` catholic '' literally means all-encompassing . 
  celtic , norse , and anglo-saxons , if i 'm not mistaken .

  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/flag_of_the_gambia.svg/1200px-flag_of_the_gambia.svg.png ), 
  well , besides the aztec empire , at least the mayan city-states were dynastic kingdoms , and some ( tikal and kalakmul , for example ) had client city-states that could be modeled in-game with a feudal system . 
  ( he shed it at verden ! ), 
  wtf dude tag this nsfl or something, 
  i submitted something very similar for a contest here once . 
  the coat of arms has a really nice design , if you ask me . 
  wikibot , what is flag of saint david ? 
  when unsure , check the flair . 
  yours is more minimalist and therefore works better as a flag . 
  mine is technically just a banner of arms . 
  the `` frankish '' culture in this trailer is different colour than the `` frankish '' culture in the current game . 
  a colour that is close to the `` german '' culture one , so i assume same culture group . 
  so i guess there 's a trigger for a culture drift similar to how normans and english are handled , which generates `` french '' culture ( or whatever it 's named ) . 
  i do n't know what 's going on in italy and spain with lombards and visigoths , though . 
  lombards in padania ( if i can call it so ) make sense , but not further south . 
  and visigothic identity was n't really preserved in spain , except for asturias . 
  i 'm more mad that i still do n't see carantanians anywhere on the map . 
  i mean , i understand they 're not in the later starting point because their nobility was wiped out by the bavarians ( they really need to split the `` german '' culture ) . 
  but carantania only lost independence in 745 after swearing fealty to bavaria ( and subsequently franks soon afterwards ) , and the dukes were still local carantanians , separate from croats . 
  this was the time of christianization of carantanians , under dukes hotimir and valtunk , and of a pagan uprising under avrelij droh ( * drugi * -- second ? 
  or are avrelij and droh two separate nobles ? 
  ) , who briefly usurped the duchy -- in 769 , the start date !, 
  and yet , carantania and neighbouring carniola seem to be split between german , lombard , and croat cultural areas .
