  ... when are they going to fix this bug ? 
  bronies are a completely different group , but just as with sjws , they would probably be an obscure fringe group , if it was n't for the internet . 
   unusually high number of lgbt people though - i always wondered why that was the case . 
  it 's not just bronies . 
  furries also have unusually high number of lgbt people , and various fetishes also seem to be far more common in their community . 
  i guess it all has to do with who those people are -- it 's not like they were perfectly normal members of society before they became bronies or furries or whatever . 
  they were most likely those kids that were excluded , ostracised . 
  because of that they could n't develop normally during puberty ( even if they were n't actually autistic or anything in the first place ) , and they found an outlet in their weird hobbies . 
  then , bam , internet springs into existence . 
  suddenly you realise you 're not the only weird kid , that there 's a whole bunch of people like you . 
  they 're all socially inept , and they 're all horny , there 's drawn porn all over the place . 
  since this is a community of guys that were kind of weird in the first place , it 's no surprise that the porn they get off on is weird as well ... and you 're on a one way ride to even more strange and extreme fetishes . 
  and they 're either still virgins , or lost virginity in a fursuit or something like that . 
  i 'm saying that because i think i used to be on a path there . 
  i was that lonely weird kid nobody talked to ... but somehow i managed to get off this ride . 
  i still do n't know what really diverted me from becoming one of them . 
  but i guess going on 4chan is `` degenerate '' enough already ...

  there 's a difference between `` freedom of speech '' and `` freedom of talking '' . 
  the word `` speech '' itself assumes that there 's audience . 
  it 's of no use if you 're free to say whatever you want , as long as nobody hears you . 
  it 's like talking to a wall . 
  edit : from universal declaration of human rights , article 19 :, 
   everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression ; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek , receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers .

  coitus interruptus is just as efficient as wearing a condom actually . 
  you need to understand that condoms are n't perfect and sometimes do n't work as intended ... 
  citing wikipedia :, 
   the rate of breakage is between 0.4 % and 2.3 % , while the rate of slippage is between 0.6 % and 1.3 % . 
  [ 9 ] even if no breakage or slippage is observed , 1 -- 2 % of women will test positive for semen residue after intercourse with a condom . 
  however , it 's important to know what `` done properly '' means for coitus interruptus . 
  it 's often claimed that coitus interruptus does n't work because precum already contains sperm -- but studies show that this is generally not the case , but it can flush out sperm that was present in urethra before sex . 
  therefore it 's best not to have sex more than once a day if you want the pull out method to work . 
  the downside is of course that it does n't protect you from stds , but this should n't be a problem in a stable , strictly monogamous relationship . 
  also , it does n't save you from stupidity of not pulling out until it 's too late . 
  that 's why actual failure rates of coitus interruptus always show to be much higher in statistics .

  seriously , 4chan 's mods have all the right to delete stuff if they want to , it 's their site after all . 
  i know the thread i screencapped rants about `` muh first amendment '' and shit , but i was thinking more about the universal declaration of human rights . 
  which , conveniently , explicitly states the right to impart your ideas though any media . 
  that 's also why it 's 1948-2014 and not 1791-2014 . 
  now , read my previous comment about what `` freedom of speech '' is from a semantic viewpoint . 
  it 's just about the definition what speech is . 
  edit : accidentally a word, 
  she has all the right not to feel safe , but she should understand that condoms are n't 100 % proof either . 
  and there 's one other thing -- if you have condom failure , it 's nobody 's fault , shit happens . 
  if you fail at pulling out , you 're the one that fucked up . 
  i 'm not saying it 's actually relevant in legal sense ... 
  i 'm just saying it 's cited a lot ( at least here in europe ) and freedom of speech is a part of it .

  except they are n't present in your piss as sand particles , they precipitate from solution . 
  uric acid can react with minerals dissolved in water ( magnesium or calcium ) to form insoluble urates . 
  this is similar to soap scum , which forms when minerals in water react with soap . 
  also , urinals and toilets do have traps , but they flush at greater force so the water in trap is replaced with clean water . 
  this is not true for sinks , unless you have some kind of super-tap installed .
