  it 's obviously a special situation that slipped through the testing of the game . 
  especially since there 's no non-gamey solution to fix it . 
  [ # 50 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jilho5r.png ) is apparently based on [ my submission to the contest we had here ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rxmmyss.png ), 
  so i 'm not going to resubmit my design . 
  is he , perchance , fond of hugh anthony cregg iii and his musical ensemble , known as `` the news '' ? 
  play a dynastic game . 
  instead of blobbing and taking all lands under your control , limit yourself to gavelkind and kingdom-level titles . 
  try to give as many titles as possible to your dynasty . 
  in other words , become the karlings . 
  i personally prefer this playstyle , if only because it feels more historically correct and immersive than maintaining a huge blob . 
  also , roleplay . 
  let your ruler 's traits influence your decisions . 
  if your ruler is kind , do n't play like he 's a sociopathic murderer . 
  if your ruler is slow , deliberately make some stupid decisions . 
  if your ruler is zealous , call some holy wars even if you ca n't win . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/2e6ops/the_fine_young_capitalists_creators_of_a/ ) was in / r/gaming yesterday . 
  i guess they know , but a little bit of promotion every now and then wo n't hurt . 
  i do n't frequent / r/gaming though so i 'm probably not the most appropriate guy for this ... 
  hm , finland seems to use a different hue of blue than indicated on this chart . 
  ah , the mexican equivalent of the seal-on-a-bedsheet design . 
  they 're not even isil anymore , they 're just the is now `` the islamic state '' . 
  um , the president of nigeria 's full name is goodluck ebele azikiwe jonathan . 
  ebele -- not exactly ebola , but eerily close . 
  if you ask me it 's better to just raise awareness of this project . 
  not something that is obviously 4chan-related . 
  no , isis and isil are both different translations from their original name in arabic , * al-dawla al - ` islamiyyah fi iraq wa al-sham * , da'ish ( an acronym isis/isil did n't approve of ) . 
  al-sham is arabic term for levant , but it 's sometimes translated as greater syria . 
  s in isis stands for syria and l in isil stands for levant . 
  when abu bakr al-baghdadi proclaimed himself caliph he dropped territorial references from the name , so now it 's officially named * al-dawla al - ` islamiyyah * or the islamic state in english . 
  [ the fate of empires and search for survival by sir john bagot glubb ] ( http://people.uncw.edu/kozloffm/glubb.pdf ) describes this cyclic process most empires experience very well . 
  i recommend it as a must-read for everyone that is open to the idea that history is n't a straight line into future and progress , but is more like a spiral ... 
   supporting those pelt-wearing barbarians, 
  [ you sure ? 
  unlike redguards , they do n't even have a culture . 
  forsworn have a rich cultural heritage , also you should be more accepting of diversity in skyrim !, 
   says the one worshipping tiber septim as a divine, 
  when will you accept that he was a mere mortal ? 
   playing anything coming from a company named after a pool in jerusalem, 
  at least pirate it if you really have to play it, 
  play as a redguard , and go killing and pillaging all over skyrim . 
  and remember , [ wherever you are , you must also rape . 
  maybe as a flavour event for lunatic and/or hedonist characters . 
  there was no single `` german '' culture back then anyway . 
  i think ck2 should split german culture ( which is currently the only culture in its culture group ) into bavarian , alemannic/swabian , thuringian , franconian ( i.e. 
  germanic frankish ) , and saxon ( which is going to be added in charlemagne ) . 
  do n't worry , they 're still there :, 
   female wookiees had six breasts and gave birth to live-born young , with their gestation period nearly a year long . 
  from [ wookieepedia ] ( http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/wookiee ) . 
  if you ask me , he died from erotic asphyxiation . 
  also / r/paradoxpolitics, 
  yeah , keep telling yourself that . 
  this just needs to have canadian flag 's proportions to look good . 
  and i 'm a nigger . 
  ignore my white man 's body , i like rap music and fucking hoes . 
  i also drink malt liquor and eat fried chicken . 
  i 'm currently taking melanin enhancers and burn my hair so they get that frizzy texture , but i 'm not very satisfied with results . 
  i 'm currently saving money for authentic hair transplants , lip augmentation , and nose reconstruction . 
  my brain is nigger , and i 'm a nigger trapped in a white man 's body . 
  yes , i know about brain structure and this stuff . 
  but still , i fail to see what is stopping people from simply not conforming to gender roles , since they 're no longer enforced , our society is supposed to be egalitarian ? 
  brain will of course affect behaviour , but this should still have nothing to do with actual gender dysphoria . 
  it 's not like we 're living in iran where you literally must have sex reassignment surgery if you want to fit into opposite gender roles . 
  a part of saxon people moved to britain together with angles ( which came from [ angeln ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/angeln ) in modern-day schleswig/slesvig ) during the 5th century . 
  anglo-saxons then diverged from mainland saxons , for example , anglo-saxons have mostly converted to christianity in early 7th century , while saxons were holy-warred by charlemagne in late 8th century , culminating with the bloody verdict of verden in 782 , where charlemagne `` shed blood of four thousand saxon men '' . 
  from the screenshots we 've seen , saxons in charlemagne dlc will most likely be in west germanic culture groups , along with dutch , anglo-saxon and english . 
   you know you ca n't go back to that because every day wears on you a little more . 
  need i say more ? 
  the breaking point is when you have to leave awkward teenage years behind , and start living as an adult responsible person . 
  this is true for everyone . 
  though , some people are encouraged to never grow out of this , and live entire life in their little bubble they kept . 
  you 're no different from special snowflakes , you 're just rationalizing yourself because you want to see yourself as better and different . 
  you 're a special snowflake among special snowflakes in your mind . 
  did n't you hear ? 
  [ it 's oppressive to hold such unrealistic standards about what vaginas should smell like . 
  ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jenny-block/lets-clear-up-some-lies-youve-been-told-about-vaginas_b_5692556.html ), 
  in my personal opinion , termites , ants , and bees really should be considered as having developed civilisation . 
  they have well developed hierarchy , and shape their environment as they see fit ( urbanisation ) . 
  i was thinking about how could alien species differ from us , and what hit me most is that a hivemind civilization could function , even if the species would n't even be self-aware . 
  this really creates the question , is sentience and sapience really required for development of civilisations . 
  then i suddenly realised that what i was thinking about actually exists here on earth in form of social insects . 
  despite not developing intelligence of any kind , they function as a civilised society . 
  if you ask me , hivemind creatures should be played on similar level as tribal or civilised societies . 
  there should be strong maluses to development speed of such societies , because they do n't progress technologically through invention and science but through natural selection , but such civilisations would be much more stable compared to us humans . 
  perhaps it is reasonable to believe that over several tens of millions of years , a hivemind civilisation could even develop spacefaring technology , which would be handled completely instinctively . 
  so there would be ( at least ) two ways of progressing the game into strategy mode , the hivemind one which slows you down but grants steady and stable progress , and the individualist one which can progress much faster through education and scientific development . 
  but our society also has large chance of internal instability , and decay of societies through decadence ( as seen in rome , for example ) or dumbing down of civilizations ( see movie idiocracy ) which could happen if the player does n't have enough competition . 
  either in other civilizations or harsh living conditions ( decadence tends to decrease in harsh times ) or puts too many points in appeasing the society instead of progressing ( when people are too satisfied , some might start doing stupid and detrimental things ) . 
  lupita nyong ' o will most likely stay thin . 
  but i guess she does n't count because she 's not african american but ethnic luo ( same as barack obama sr. ) . 
  this is also a good point to mention where and how genetics actually affects body weight . 
  nilotic blacks ( like luo ) have slender build with long limbs , which makes them excellent long distance runners , while african americans and west africans from which they descend have bulkier build . 
  but this is solely about skeletal structure and muscle mass , and definitely not about body fat percentage as some people want to think . 
  a person with slender build can easily be skinny-fat , and both weigh less and look less bulky than another person with broad build but little body fat . 
  i was also expecting to see lozenges or cartouches on queen cards . 
  it could also be related to french question words : * que * , * qui * , * quoi * , * quand * , which is close to the onomatopoeic verb `` to quack '' , which in past also meant croaking of frogs ( compare to other germanic languages , where `` to croak '' is still the main meaning of cognates ) . 
  somehow related , in slovenia , inhabitants of ljubljana are sometimes called * \u017eabarji * `` froggers '' , partly because we use * kva * instead of * kaj * as the question word `` what '' -- which might be a linguistic remnant of napoleon 's occupation . 
  note that * kvakati * means only `` to croak '' , the sound ducks make is described with the verb * gagati * . 
  another explanation is that just south of ljubljana , there used to be marshes ( which have since been dried out ) , so a lot of frogs lived there . 
  queens regnant , but not queens consort . 
  the exception from all european queens consorts is queen sonja of norway , but it should be noted that all members of norwegian royal family use the same coats of arms , differentiated only by the crown and achievements .
