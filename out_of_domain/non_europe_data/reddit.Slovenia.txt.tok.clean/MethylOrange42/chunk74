  all other queens consorts display their arms on a cartouche . 
  edit : in general , women are entitled to using the escutcheon if they 're the dynastic heiress , or if they 're married and use their husband 's coat of arms . 
  the first is the case with queen elizabeth of england and queen margrethe ii of denmark , the latter is the case with queen sonja of norway . 
  what 's up with that glitched portrait of the second sibling ? 
   some argue that eating pineapple and some other sweet fruits can make your pussy taste sweeter , and that some harsher-tasting foods may have the opposite effect . 
  but -- and my apologies if this is too graphic or personal for you -- my girl must tell me a million times a day how much she loves the taste and smell of my pussy , and i am always saying the exact same thing about hers , and we are two seriously meat-loving girls . 
  so i 'm calling bullshit on this too .

  sometimes this happens when two different dynasties get assigned the same number , i believe . 
  since dynasty tree is built from a single founder , the game can not display the relationships between people that are n't direct descendants of the founder in dynasty tree view . 
  ck2 already has this kind of succession law ( appointment succession ) , but is reserved for vassals of holy orders . 
  perhaps sons of the previous count or duke should get claims on the title ( firstborn gets strong claim ) upon their father 's death , but the title reverts to the king . 
  this should make the firstborn most likely to inherit title , but the decision is in hands of the king . 
  then make inheritance of vassal titles a crown law . 
  kingdoms start with appointment succession ( if formed before a certain date ) , but this gives an opinion malus , and vassals may push forward a law for inheritance in a civil war , same as with other laws . 
  make it impossible to revert to appointment succession . 
  google full name of nigerian president , you wo n't be disappointed . 
  plague ? 
  you mean medieval ebola ? 
  found the american . 
  frankish ! = french is addressed in this dlc ; there 's a culture drift event that generates romance french culture from germanic frankish , similar to how norman and english cultures are handled . 
  however , i think that german should be split into bavarian , alemannic ( alemannia and swabia ) , thuringian , frankish ( franconia ) and saxon ( which will be in the game in west germanic culture group ) . 
  also : still no carantanians . 
  i 'm disappointed , especially since there was a slavic pagan rebellion going on in 769 , against christian duke hotimir , vassal of bavaria , which would make a fun starting point . 
  aww . 
  but you 're anglo , right ? 
  maybe german . 
  [ i 'm not sure how many of those you already have , but here 's another album of feels i 've bookmarked . 
  [ and a bonus . 
  i do n't think differentiating germanic and norse paganism is necessary . 
  pagan religions currently in the game already cover various different yet fully compatible beliefs . 
  i mean , this is the explanation why you have to reform them ; when you control holy sites you write down the beliefs and standardise the religion . 
  though it would make sense to rename it now , perhaps best to \u00c1satr\u00fa . 
  baltic and finnic paganism are already referred to by their modern neopaganist names , suomenusko and romuva . 
  perhaps slavic paganism could be renamed to rodnover as well . 
  [ my oc ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5wktttt.jpg ) , to go with the copypasta i posted . 
  dire straits got mtv video of the year award for a song criticizing mtv . 
  edit : the point of the song is primarily about effortless popular bands . 
  but he got the idea in an appliance store , where all the tvs played mtv . 
  mtv 's effect on popular culture also allowed those effortless bands to reach that much audience to get rich . 
  yep , that one . 
  you forgot to mention that yazidi are still a sunni heresy , even though they 're clearly distinct from islam . 
  dovahkiin dlc confirmed !, 
  [ and this is what i 'm currently listening to . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcedw82vw1c ), 
  are you , perchance , a truck ? 
   implying 24-hour labour, 
  well , most newfags just go to / b / , no wonder they do n't see any better content . 
  yes , presumed amount of work that takes one man one hour to do . 
  but i 'm quite sure one man-day is n't 24 man-hours . 
  keming ? 
  what is keming ? 
  i 'm saying the conversion from man-hours to man-days is wrong . 
  one man-day is 8 man-hours and one man-week is 5 man-days , because of 40-hour labour week . 
   the similar concept of a man-day , man-week , man-month , or man-year [ 3 ] [ 4 ] is used on very large projects . 
  it is the amount of work performed by an average worker during one day , week , month , or year , respectively . 
  also his dynasty is mauro ( moor ) , which in turn comes from ancient greek * \u03bc\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 * `` dark '' . 
  i 've seen someone claim that first koreans were black because they lived in shitty huts only 100 years ago ( just like all blacks do , and apparently that 's not racist in this case ) and their peasants were clearly more tanned than the elite . 
  therefore black . 
  i think he was a black history revisionist because he called almost every civilization black . 
  including jomon period japan , with explanation that ainu are remnants of jomon culture , and they were up until recent times predominantly black , because they 're depicted as having curly hair and thick beards . 
  ( i think he included yayoi culture as well , but i 'm not sure ), 
  oh , roman emperor nero was black as well , hence his name . 
  descriptions of him having light hair and blue eyes were created later because historians could n't imagine that a black guy could have been emperor , so they white-washed him . 
  and we all know that roman empire was destroyed because romans became increasingly racist so they could n't accept having a germanic emperor . 
  you know what happened when black slaves in haiti took the power and founded republic of haiti ? 
  jean-jacques dessalines proclaimed himself emperor in 1804 and ordered the massacre of almost every single white haitian , even those that did n't own slaves or were even supporting the revolution . 
  this was one of the most disgusting examples of a genocide ever , and whites were banned from owning land on haiti the next year . 
  his secretary boisrond-tonnerre said :, 
   for our declaration of independence , we should have the skin of a white man for parchment , his skull for an inkwell , his blood for ink , and a bayonet for a pen !, 
  so , what do we learn ? 
  you will always have people in power that will abuse this power . 
  and this is in no way related to whether those people are white , black , brown , red , whatever colour you want . 
  europeans had the most power during the modern period , so they had the most opportunities to abuse this power . 
  you mean an oversized ninja costume ? 
  i 'd 420 blaze it with her . 
  if you want to see actual feminists at work , i guess you 'll have to go to somalia or afghanistan . 
  mostly it 's about education rights and better medical assistance for childbirth . 
  mongols came from the east , so they outrussianed the russians . 
  blasian men are another story though . 
  [ ( this is jean ping , gabonese diplomat , son of a chinese merchant ) ] ( http://www.un.org/ga/president/59/gaimages/ping_large.jpg ), 
  erode the mountains !, 
  make rivers flow through the mountains , maybe make them follow some lines ( tectonic fault lines ) , then paint valleys around them . 
  see [ alps ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/alpenrelief_01.jpg ) for example . 
  islands are fine . 
  there are some regions that have a lot of small islands ; for example greece , or philippines/indonesia . 
  it is rare though . 
  medieval greek already shifted voiced and aspirated plosives into voiced and voiceless fricatives . 
  in vowels , \u03b9 \u03b7 and \u03c5 all merged into / i / ( \u03c5 was / y / at intermediate stage in late antiquity , as german \u00fc is pronounced ) , same with diphthongs \u03b5\u03b9 \u03c5\u03b9 and \u03bf\u03b9 . 
  \u03b1\u03b9 merged with \u03b5 into / e / . 
  \u03c5 at end of diphthongs turned into / f / . 
  there were some other sound shifts regarding clusters , but i do n't remember what exactly they were . 
  so , it would be something like : ~ ~ vasilefs ~ ~ vasileps vasileon vasilion vasilionton . 
  edit : vasileps , because of rules regarding dissimilation of consonant clusters . 
  [ serbia still uses a derivative of this coat of arms ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/coat_of_arms_of_serbia.svg/710px-coat_of_arms_of_serbia.svg.png ) , but the four betas have been repurposed as four \u0421 's ( which is cyrillic letter for / s / sound , historically named * slovo * -- word ) . 
  the motto they represent is * \u0421\u0430\u043c\u043e \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0430 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0430\u0432\u0430 * -- `` solely concord saves the serb '' . 
  raising sea levels could perhaps cause this . 
  if you raised sea level for about 100 metres , a lot of coastal hills would form similar islands . 
  but it should be due to a recent occurrence , or rivers would sediment coastal plains and reconnect them to the continent .
