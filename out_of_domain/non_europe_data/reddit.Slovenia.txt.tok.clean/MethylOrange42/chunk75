  they 're blazoned as firesteels , yes . 
  but every serb will tell you that they 're actually \u0421 's . 
  i see they discuss a wide variety of topics . 
  yes , but this is also because there are new infections at a constant exponential rate . 
  in guinea , where it has slowed down a bit , it 's 430/648 , which is 66 % .

  wait . . did denmark and sweden change their places ? 
  this was definitely not sexual assault . 
  shirt-tearing and face-grabbing are quite normal for physical assaults , unless you want to claim that when boys fight at school and someone gets his shirt torn this is gay sexual assault . 
  conveniently , austrian eagle already holds sickle and hammer in its claws . . 
  i made [ this flag that includes brown ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gpcnh3k.png ) for teke people in congo . 
  the colours are chosen to look distinctly african , yet unique . 
  green represents the forest and life , yellow the wealth and prosperity , and brown the fertile soil which supports both . 
  the face in the middle is based on traditional statues of the people , which are believed to have magical qualities . 
  [ croatian flag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/flag_of_croatia.svg/1200px-flag_of_croatia.svg.png ) does n't include religious imagery . 
  the first shield in the crown is old coat of arms of duchy of croatia . 
  having islamic symbols on croatian flag would n't make any sense anyway . 
  edit : besides what others already said , albania has no religious symbolism either , but moldovan coat of arms ( which is on the flag ) has the eagle holding a cross in its beak . 
  montenegro also has two small crosslets , on crown and on orb . 
  swiss cross has religious origins too . 
  i ca n't see if you 've marked andorra or not , but the coat of arms has bishop 's mitre in first quarter . 
  i 'm not sure ; croatia was thoroughly christianised in early 9th century , but heraldry only really started in late 11th century . 
  the earliest known example of the croatian crescent and star is from a coin bearing name of andrew ii , which ruled 1205-1235 . 
  while it is possible that the symbol is older , it 's not very likely because christianity would 've probably banned usage of a pagan symbol . 
  oh look , it 's landscape heraldry at work again !, 
  it 's quite common in latin america , really . 
  off the top of my head : costa rica , nicaragua , honduras , bolivia and equador all have all-proper coats of arms . 
  hey , you forgot spurdo sp\u00e4rde !, 
  did n't know that , but i tracked the genealogy on wikipedia and ended up with [ thimo the brave , count of wettin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thimo_the_brave,_count_of_wettin ) . 
  there 's no county of wettin ingame , but he should be somewhere in duchy of meissen , my guess is county of lausitz . 
  i do n't have the game installed on my laptop so i ca n't check it now . 
  slavic paganism has jarilo 's feast , which i think gets some extra events , for example the procession with someone in costume of jarilo ( adorned with green branches ) . 
  the tradition itself is actually still followed in some parts of croatia and slovenia , but jarilo is renamed into * zeleni juraj/jurij * ( green george ) and associated with st. george . 
  guys ... did you notice that there is no dlc-026 ? 
  the dlcs are numbered , but 26 is missing . 
  do you think it 's the famed secret bears dlc ? 
  i got this photo off his facebook page , [ here ] ( https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=709206205825585 ) . i tried to reverse image search for the photo on google , but there were no results . 
  you can see some of his photos at his website http://www.photos.is/, 
  snorrason = `` son of snorri '' . 
  icelanders still use patronymic surnames . 
  so the surname is not a family name that is passed from generation to generation , instead a child takes the father 's first name as the surname . 
  there are some exceptions , some icelanders bear their mother 's name as a surname ( matronymic ) . 
  because of that , people are usually addressed by their first name , and never only by their surname . 
  for example , the singer bj\u00f6rk 's first name actually is bj\u00f6rk , and her full name is bj\u00f6rk gu\u00f0mundsd\u00f3ttir , which means `` bj\u00f6rk , daughter of gu\u00f0mundur '' . 
  oh , and also , haukur = `` hawk '' .

  physically ? 
  quite likely . 
  but mentally ? 
  definitely not . 
  maybe 15 is a bit early . 
  but still , most girls already finish puberty and are thus fully developed by 17 . 
  average age of menarche is between 12 and 13 , even earlier . 
  i do n't think that is the age when one attains full mental maturity though . 
  i like this idea .

  radioactive decay and formation of metallic core are responsible for most of the heat that is trapped inside earth . 
  also , it 's full of magma and not something else because most lighter materials ( ice and gases ) were blown to outer regions of solar system during the formation , so earth has formed mostly out of heavier materials , rocks and metals . 
  well , oil is a renewable resource , if you 're willing to wait a hundred million years ... 
  here 's the thing . 
  you said a `` jackdaw is a crow . '', 
  is it in the same family ? 
  yes . 
  no one 's arguing that . 
  as someone who is a scientist who studies crows , i am telling you , specifically , in science , no one calls jackdaws crows . 
  if you want to be `` specific '' like you said , then you should n't either . 
  they 're not the same thing . 
  if you 're saying `` crow family '' you 're referring to the taxonomic grouping of corvidae , which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens . 
  so your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people `` call the black ones crows ? '', 
  let 's get grackles and blackbirds in there , then , too . 
  also , calling someone a human or an ape ? 
  it 's not one or the other , that 's not how taxonomy works . 
  they 're both . 
  a jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family . 
  but that 's not what you said . 
  you said a jackdaw is a crow , which is not true unless you 're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows , which means you 'd call blue jays , ravens , and other birds crows , too . 
  which you said you do n't . 
  it 's okay to just admit you 're wrong , you know ? 
  that 's not in slovenia . 
  if it was in slovenia , it would say * ena * , not * jedna * . 
  it 's most likely in croatia . 
  [ come on , do n't nag me .

  * teufel * , while it means `` devil '' , is used as an interjection here , as english uses `` hell '' . 
  also , i guess it 's not * floeh * but * fl\u00f6he * . 
  i 'd translate it as : `` ugh , hell , how those fleas go ! '',
