  edit : your translation would be * pfui , der teufel ist wie rasende fl\u00f6he !, 
  you need to put * bellum * in plural as well , unless you had multiple justifications for a single war . 
  whoops . 
  did n't bother double-checking that ... 
  keep lurking then . 
  i 'll make a dump if i see an appropriate thread for that on / int / , i promise that . 
  [ meanwhile , enjoy this . 
  do n't play them then . 
  and poor abdul-jaleel is still imprisoned . 
   sand niggers, 
  if you really want to be racist ... 
  why not also call the norse snow niggers then . 
  they lived in huts with their goats and cows , and raped and pillaged across europe . 
  and , you know who the merchants are ... ( hint hint -- they have big crooked noses ), 
  in slovene , * \u010dvrst ( i ) * , which comes from the same proto-slavic root * \u010d\u044crstv\u044a * ( the v switched place ) , means `` firm '' . 
  * \u0445\u0430\u043d * is pronounced / xan / , with harder h-sound , similar to german < ch  . 
  but most slavic languages , including bulgarian , do n't use / h / , and / x / is the closest approximation when adopting loanwords . 
  i know a guy whose family refused to celebrate christmas at all because they were communists . 
  as a kid , he liked ruining other kid 's childhood by telling them santa does n't real . 
  [ i 've seen a heraldic crown of canada done on deviantart before . 
  ] ( http://leoninia.deviantart.com/art/heraldic-crown-of-canada-407839434 ), 
  [ the first quebecois coa used inverted colours in chief and only two fleurs-de-lis ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/blason_ca_province_quebec_%281867_-1939%29.svg/600px-blason_ca_province_quebec_%281867_-1939%29.svg.png ) . 
  maybe using a single * azure fleur-de-lis * on field either * or * or * argent * is both francophone enough and not too french . 
  nova scotia also had [ an old coat of arms , with scottish thistles and a salmon ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/blason_ca_province_nouvelle-%c3%89cosse_%281867-1929%29.svg/600px-blason_ca_province_nouvelle-%c3%89cosse_%281867-1929%29.svg.png ) , so keep the salmon . 
  newfoundland keeps only the unicorn . 
  the other provinces can be represented by the central motif in their respective coas . 
  canadian columbia gets the setting sun , alberta a wheat field , saskatchewan three wheatsheaves , manitoba a bison , ontario the * maple leaves or * on field * vert * , new brunswick the ship , and prince edward island an oak tree . 
  maybe the best arrangement would be 3x3 of those provincial coats of arms , with ontario in base . 
  i 'd put the beaver in crest , and use the moose and a native warrior as supporters . 
  the girl in the middle looks slavic . 
  hawaii would just keep it the same , they put the union jack in the canton without being a dominion . 
  indeed , he is the king of cul-de-sac . 
  of course , this also means he has the right, 
  to grant upon himself the coat of arms ;, 
  no matter how outlandish his claim is . 
  fugg : -- ddd, 
  he watch . 
  well , except for special byzantine flavour , retinues , cardinal system , and a couple of events , you still get the full game . 
  you just ca n't play as most of the characters in game , and are blocked from playing from the earliest start date ... 
  the rest is just eye - and earcandy dlcs . 
  i 'd also note that ck2 has average playtime on steam almost 200 hours . 
  this is many times more than other games . 
  so , while you might pay more , you also actually get to play more , before you get bored . 
  still , ca n't say i like the system ... 
  ca n't say , i 've only seen the vulva . 
  i 'm a 90s kid, 
  top decadence, 
  you 're gon na love it when you 're 40 , broken and disease-ridden from your decadent lifestyle , while people your age around you will have loving families and someone to care about . 
   not wanting to have your penis inspected, 
  that 's the most action i 'd be getting this year ... 
   republic of sea shells, 
  before the summer , i did , yes . 
  physics , the exam is thermodynamics . 
  fucking virial equation of state derivation . 
  psshh , do n't call the inquisition, 
  i just spent the last twenty minutes rubbing a twelve year old girl 's bare chest . 
  `` how ? '', 
  you ask . 
  well apparently there are a select few contexts within which such an action is acceptable . 
  for instance , if your niece has a hacking cough and your sister asks you to `` put some of this on her '' while she calls the doctor . 
  `` putting some of this on hear '' meant using my bare hands to rub this vapor ointment shit all over her bare naked chest . 
  my heartbeat is still all erratic from it . 
  i had a boner the size of manhattan the entire time . 
  she 's sleeping now and i guess she feels better because she stopped coughing . 
  details : she 's about 5 feet tall , has long brown hair , a cute face , a thin waist and long skinny legs . 
  she 's in jammies i think because although i 'm pretty shaken up right now i know i unbuttoned something before i went at it . 
  god i feel so great . 
  i just rubbed my hands all over her fucking tits , you guys . 
  well the puffy parts of her chest anyway . 
  her nipples got hard . 
  i just about wept tears of joy . 
  i did n't do anything else because i 'm a coward and rubbing was enough . 
  plus it was legal and i did n't technically do anything wrong , so i 'm in the clear . 
  i 'd write more but i seriously have to go fap while the memory is fresh in my head . 
  there 's always a thin pale faggy wimp that will come help the vapid tumblrite damsel in distress in hope of gratitudal sex which however will inevitably not happen . 
  thank dog for burgers, 
   `` you were the chosen one !, 
  it was said that you would destroy the sith , not join them . 
  you were to bring balance to the force , not leave it in darkness ! '', 
  well , surprise surprise , balance means the middle way , as buddha said . 
  he is the balance , for he is both the saoshyant and the angra mainyu . 
  ( \u00b0 \u0361 d\u035c\u035f \u00b0 \u0360 ), 
  we 're not weird , we 're chaotic neutral, 
  and there 's still no carantanian culture . 
  or east . 
  swahili merchant republics in the indian ocean ? 
  would play . 
   not # 88, 
   incase someone plays the pope . . players will mod it in , so might as well give them a fun option here . . 
  pula is a city in istria . 
  decent enough . 
  from now on you may reply to my funposts . 
  i know that caspian sea is usually considered a lake because it 's not linked with other seas , but in fact it could also be considered a sea on its own . 
  it has its own seabed , and is geologically a remnant of paratethys sea , along with black sea , that was cut off from the rest of world 's seawater about five million years ago . 
  this makes it different from other large saltwater endorheic lakes , which are either shallow and lie at the bottom of their basin on land , or lie at the bottom of rift valleys . 
  the fact that it is a special case and that there 's no other waterbody like it on earth ( right now ; mediterranean sea was separated from atlantic ocean for some time as well ) is the main reason it is usually considered merely a lake . 
  also somehow related ; amazon is navigable for smaller ocean vessels up to iquitos , which means that peru has a port in atlantic basin . 
  yep , it 's wood . 
  how do i mod the game so i can start from those dates ? 
  in a shattered-world-type mod i tried changing common/defines . txt and put it under replace_path in the . mod file , but the dates between 867 and 1066 were still inaccessible .
