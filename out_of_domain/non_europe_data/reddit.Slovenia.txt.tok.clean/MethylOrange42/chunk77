  i can put single files on replace_path , right ? 
  i did that with mongols , and they do n't invade anymore . 
  it 's a fad . 
  besides actual flags , users also submit their own designs . 
  every once and then , someone comes up with their idea how to combine flags or flag styles , and if it looks good , everyone will give it a try and submit a similar crossover flag . 
  examples of fads besides the californiated : sovietized , nordic cross , prussianized , marylandized . 
  ( however , soviet , nordic and prussian fads are re-emergent , perhaps close to meme-status ), 
  i 've played as chandela dynasty from 867 just after roi came out . 
  you start as a vassal of pratiharas with , and just outside the dejure bihar lands to your east , where you 're going to expand after they 're weakened by palas attacking with dejure claims . 
  i had nine daughters and no sons ( except for some ugly poor fellow with bad stats overall that got plot-killed when he was 18 ) , and i managed to matrilinearly marry my daughters all over india . 
  i married my daughter matrilinearly to the maharaja 's firstborn 's third son , and i did n't even have to take care of his two older brothers , they both died before i even started plotting . 
  i became the maharaja of kosala in about 35 years , with secure inheritance of rajputana on my grandson , and heirs of my dynasty in several rajs under rashtrakutas and palas . 
  perhaps i should return to that game and finish it properly , perhaps set becoming samrat chakravartin as a final goal . 
  chandelas are independent in 1066 . 
  besides , it 's the chandelas that built [ khajuraho ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/dkafb ) . 
  what other reason you need ? 
  good point . 
  i 'd also like to note that we see equivalents of both chimp and bonobo behaviour in different cultures . 
  the main difference that is often noted is that bonobos , who live on the left bank of congo river , have always had to compete less for the resources with other species , and also had fewer natural predators . 
  curiously , in stable times , when there is abundance of food , and no big wars fought , human society slowly becomes less strict and more liberal in most senses . 
  warrior culture based on pride and honour becomes a thing of the past , and the society becomes more gender-egalitarian . 
  sexuality becomes more liberated , people change partners more and homosexuality is n't shunned anymore . 
  this has happened in many societies in the past . 
  romans come to mind as a very good example . 
  they were a strong military society that built an empire on many bloody conquests ( third punic war and gallic wars were literally genocidal ) , which in times of peace and stability became a society built on pleasures ; late empire military was based mainly on foreign soldiers , like germanics . 
  the problem here is , the society also has to pay a price for this change . 
  because it is more inclusive , it also becomes less stable , and weaker . 
  people do n't have to work hard everyday , so hedonism and decadence can easily become wide-spread , and this makes a society weaker . 
  as long as there is no external threat , everything is fine , and people feel happier in general . 
  so , why do bonobos and chimps come to mind here ? 
  bonobos live in abundance , with no external threats , so they assumed the lifestyle that is comparable to that in stable empires . 
  they 're matriarchal and hedonistic . 
  on contrary , chimps have competitiveness in their nature , which demands males to be stronger and more strict . 
  so they 're patriarchal and militaristic . 
  humans , though , are more adaptive and can change behaviour based on the environment , so we can see equivalents of both systems . 
  besides xxy ( klinefelter syndrome ) , xx-male ( de la chapelle syndrome ) is also possible ; but it is even less common , about one in 20 thousand births . 
  it 's caused by crossing over between x and y chromosomes during meiosis ( which should n't normally happen ) that causes the transfer of the sry gene ( which is a trigger for male sex development ) to the x chromosome .

  i vote for iranian religion group , as both manichaeism and zoroastrianism are strongly dualistic in their philosophy and they both have source in iranian traditions , even though they 're quite different in their doctrines . 
  but indian religions are a religious group on their own , and they 're quite diverse as well . 
  did you think about adding another zoroastrian heresy to replace manichean ? 
  khurramites could perhaps fill the spot . 
  yarsanism could fill the place as yazidi heresy , should you overhaul them as well . 
  otherwise , good work , i 'm looking forward to downloading this mod when it 's done . 
  masterchan is shit , unless you 're looking for some cheese pizza .

  you 're right , the current heresy spread system does n't make much sense . . . 
  especially low moral authority would be a big problem for small religions regarding heresy spread . 
  though , various ideas did spread surprisingly fast in medieval period . 
  there were still travellers which could spread new ideas pretty quickly . 
  not immediately , but perhaps in several years , a new heresy could form a community on other side of europe . 
  bugarach comes to mind , bolgarian bogomil settlement in french pyrenees , in middle of later cathar country . 
  though , i 'd expect the spread to be more localised . 
  perhaps the lower crown authority gets , the faster heresy spreads to nearby counties , while it does n't have much of an effect on chance of isolated communities popping up . 
  also , an explanation behind how heresy currently spreads would be simply that the province 's religion only shows the predominant faith -- so heresies are always present , but are usually just minority movements . 
  i 'd like to see the ability to join forces with heresiarchs though .

  is that christian andalusia with lowborn king ?

  sneaky little bastard . 
  as a big fan of actual mongolian folk music , i was disappointed . 
  aside from lyrical themes and occasional pentatonic melody every now and then ... 
  this was nothing like what i was expecting and hoping for . 
  i 'm quite sure i 've seen someone post a lowborn king here before . 
  he only spawned a dynasty after he died . 
  but i just noticed something else as well : there are two different dandolo dynasties . 
  one controls venice and the other controls verona and lombardy . 
  they use different colours on the map .

  iirc if you 're not hungarian the requirement is that at least one province of yours inside de jure hungary is hungarian .
