  i made one for duchy of laponia for myself , which is based on coa of finnish lappland ( so same as county of lappland , except it 's on red field ) . 
  what does the dynasty tree look like ? 
  i 'm assuming only one branch will appear correctly , all other characters are just stacked up on the left ... 
  fucking poe 's law , man, 
  as i have expected ... dynasty tree builds from the top , the founder of dynasty . 
  so if some character somehow gets assigned into a dynasty without having a parent there they 'll be placed into that collumn . 
  you can see that with roman emperors , and i 've also had this happen a couple of times because mercenary captains somehow managed to get placed into some non-empty dynasties . 
  rescue could perhaps also be a plot . 
  as well as a plot to kidnap . 
  i wish we could play as swahili coast merchant cities . 
   tagged nsfw, 
  ^ ( edit : remember rules 1 and 2 before you faggots comment ), 
  yeah i remembered that when i submitted it, 
   this, 
   breaking the no porn rule, 
  sure is repression in saudi arabia, 
  it 's in pic , / pol /, 
  not mine btw, 
  yeah , that 's why i thought of it . 
  rescuing is n't in . 
  you can , on nsfw boards, 
  you can also dump leaked pics , as long as they 're not celebrities/gg related, 
   peehole above clit, 
  posting pornography is not permitted . 
  this is a politics board , not a porn board . 
  / pol / is nsfw mostly because of war/nazi stuff, 
  rules 1 and 2 you faglord, 
  rules 1 and 2 faglords ... 
  it already exists and you faggots really want every piece of shit there, 
   [ hosted on tumblr ] ( http://33.media.tumblr.com/5da64772d2370e43b13d3e49423b84b7/tumblr_nc12srdi5c1sfhlnlo1_1280.jpg ), 
  even more fucking exposure , yay !, 
   does n't read, 
   calls other people niggers, 
  in short , the bosses are creating an internet strike force for crowd control in case people get funny ideas overseas , 4chan is in because we 're too redpilled ; also they 're trying to use memes to bluepill people, 
  4chan is kill, 
  moot is kike, 
  we 're in dias/pol/a, 
  rescind thy accusation :\\ ^ ), 
  this was posted about a week ago here i think and it should 've been taken as an alarm, 
  we were warned, 
  but we did n't listen, 
  i did in may , i got fat over summer because it was raining all the time ... 
  i think it was 50/50 before the happening , i checked a couple of months ago, 
  edit : wayback machine confirms that , it was normal until 2014/01/01 , then next save was 2014/07/02 , right before the big invasion , it was already strangely feminized, 
   expecting to be spoonfed, 
  you 're the cancer that killed 4chan, 
  op approved, 
   he does n't know the rules of the internet, 
  how fucking new are you, 
  nowhere is exactly safe actually . 
   implying there 's anything wrong with / v/ivincest, 
  not if he 's sparkling, 
  edit : doctor who and sherlock holmes are tolerated as well, 
  even with coats of arms women bear there is some more freedom than that , they just ca n't be shield shaped . 
  this is especially evident when they bear heavily quartered arms , and the shape has to be changed from the simple lozenge to accommodate all the fields . 
  [ example would be the coat of arms of the late queen mother elizabeth of england , which had 8 quarterings , with the royal arms in dexter and her own lineage 's canting arms ( with bows and lions , she was bowes-lyon ) in sinister , which was usually depicted on a stretched lozenge shape .

  something that would hurt the status quo that has the usa in control of most stuff going on . 
  like isis . 
  he mentioned that isis also relies on using memes . 
  your comment is very offensive to people with chromosome deficiency , please retract it . 
  thank god i speak both english and german , otherwise this dutch shit would be hard ... 
  slightly prognathic skull is actually the norm in east asia , yes . 
  but in their case ( unless they have really bad prognathism ) this is normal , and does n't cause any problems , because upper jaw teeth are more outwards oriented as well so there 's not so much gap . 
  except for aesthetic ones , of course .

   tfw you realise unidan has an article on wikipedia, 
  obligatory `` why the fuck are you responding to a month old comment '', 
  not to mention that i 've seen it a dozen times before already, 
   `` i 'm gay . 
  get over it '', 
  and the media proceeds to make a big story around it . 
  it seems that they ca n't quite get over it ... 
  i 'm not . 
  i actually ca n't even trace my paternal lineage further than to my great-grandfather . 
  i 'm not even mad, 
   implying i was n't just shilling for \u516b\u9648, 
  surprisingly , when i made a dump of same pics on / pol / as a goodbye thread i did n't get a ban, 
  [ fuck you too . 
  african girls have a considerably lower chance of being rabid tumblrite whores . 
  if i were you , i 'd reconsider my preferences . 
  but , because they do n't use contraception , you can easily see which ones ride the cock carousel , they 're accompanied by a niglet . 
   tight yoga pants and barely covered nipples ! = nsfw, 
   great apes in their natural habitat somehow = = nsfw, 
  yeah , so is my flag ... 
  i 'm dynamic anyway so , maybe for this weekend some fuckers can still get me . 
  if someone was really dedicated , i 'm quite sure i already stated what city i live in in one of my past comments . 
  i was retarded and uploaded signed out on imgur , so i ca n't even cross it over . 
  well , i guess you 're all invited to my party . 
  we all secretly do , 
  this is partially because female on male in-relationship violence is n't a crime . 
  but higher chance of having criminal brothers ? 
  i 'd agree with that . 
  [ this guy is aboriginal . 
  a : = b means `` let a be b '', 
  a = = b means `` a equals b '', 
  reformed tengri appeared because , if i 'm not mistaken , shattered world forgets to disable holy orders on game start . 
  if a title is set to be alive even when landless , you need to explicitly state that it 's inactive in title history file . 
  which means that all in-game holy orders are active right from the beginning , which includes reformed pagan holy orders . 
  same with fraticelli papacy .
