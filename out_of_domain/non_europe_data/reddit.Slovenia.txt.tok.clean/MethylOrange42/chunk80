  it 's just improper to talk about it . 
  it is still possible to identify well-defined population gene clusters . 
  even if they are n't the `` races '' in classical sense , and there 's a lot of crossover between them in intermediate populations , they still define archetypal populations which roughly coincide with classical races mostly . 
  whether you call those archetypal populations races or not , is mostly a thing of consensus . 
  currently the word `` race '' has a negative connotation to it , so geneticists avoid using this term . 
  yes , i did , and i bookmarked them because i know they come in handy for debates like this . 
  i do agree that there 's big overlap , and that it does n't really make sense to assign `` race '' to those boundary populations . 
  however , when you plot the results of multidimensional principal component analysis ( third article explains the mathematics behind it , and second one has some fancy examples ) , you will almost always end up with clusters that are linked by a stream of intermediate populations . 
  the fact that they do n't deviate much from the straight line in principal component space shows that they can be explained as a linear combination of archetypical population , which is represented by those clusters at the ends . 
  extensive mixing of populations would render the whole notion of existence races meaningless , because the entire population would be more or less uniformly mixed . 
  you would still be able to identify the ancestral races , as corners of the linear hull of the populations in principal genetic component space , but it would be useless to assign races , more than just state the percentages in genetic heritage . 
  an example of heavily mixed populations would be the east asians . 
  there are two separate populations at the extreme ends of the continuum ( in eastern siberia and in indonesia ) , but the intermediate populations are heavily mixed . 
  in the classical notion of races they 're classified as a single race , but if you were to assign races based on genetic principal component analysis , you 'd have two ancestral races ( mongolids and austronesians , if you want ) , but most of people from east asia would be a combination of those two , with various percentages . 
  northern han would be closer to the siberian population than cantonese . 
  vietnamese and thai again have larger and larger part of austronesian admixture . 
  you also need to take into account that most of these publications prefer to use neutral language . 
  it was fully proper on [ older depictions ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/coat_of_arms_of_moscow_gubernia_%28russian_empire%29.png ) though . 
  [ another source in russian ] ( http://www.home-edu.ru/user/uatml/00000754/histbibil/moscow/gerb/urok7.htm ), 
   these groups will have more genetic variability within than between groups, 
  which is why you need to do all that maths first . 
  what principal component analysis does is it locates those needles in a haystack , and only extracts the genetic variation that is n't uniform over all populations . 
  different human populations have internal different genetic variability . 
  amerindians form their own distinct genetic cluster , but it has very low internal variation ( as expected from the bottleneck theory ) , even though it 's quite sharply separated because there was little gene flow over the bering strait since the ice age ended . 
  gene clusters in africa , however , are very diffuse and have large internal variation . 
  when lewontin stated that there 's greater genetic difference inside than between populations , he did n't have access to computational power required to do such analysis , so it 's not surprising he was n't able to see the bigger picture . 
  well to be honest fashion has always been a higher classes thing . 
  i 've decided to step down in favour of second highest voted submission . 
  i 've definitely gone too far with my design for greater coat of arms with all the achievements , and to be honest i 've expected for just the escutcheon design to score better . 
  i like how it turned out , but it feels a bit too silly . 
  maybe in the future if we have a heraldryjerk sub or something like that ( like / r/vexillologycirclejerk ) , it would be fitting . 
  once you figure the game out ... 
  give it to the children it 's a much more competitive and ( if you like playing hardmode ) fun game . 
  try to stay on gavelkind as well . 
  though * lower * burgundy historically was n't the duchy of burgundy , but the southern part of in-game kingdom of burgundy , so in-game duchies of dauphin\u00e9 and provence .

  i think this analysis is lacking another statistics : the number of sexual partners before wedding . 
  i 'll refrain from doing value judgement here , but being a virgin before marriage greatly increases marriage stability . 
  i really like the design , but unfortunately it would n't be very practical as it would blend in with the environment too well . 
  flags are usually supposed to be seen ... 
  technically , * female * applies to any species , while * woman * applies to humans only . 
  so he identified her as human as well . 
  though i ca n't imagine a non-human self-made millionaire ... 
  i would n't be surprised if a lot of them are proud of their egregore and hoping for imminent happening . 
  i heard this story the other way around , that croats are a tribe of goths , 
  it 's a rarely used diplomatic maneuvre known as the good ol' switcheroo . 
  real gangsta ass mothaphuqqa, 
  it 's actually a version of [ this copypasta ] ( http://www.wikicu.com/copypasta#someone_was_teaching_a_class ) . 
  i 'm not really sure which version is the original one , but i believe it 's the second one listed . 
  but the copypasta itself is quite likely in turn based on that chain letter . 
  actually coats of arms are passed forward to all descendants in german heraldic practice , and also in french since napoleon made such a decree . 
  in spanish heraldic practice you see quarters of coats of arms passed on , and individuals bear quartered coats of arms from lineages of their four grandparents -- so again you have everyone inheriting . 
  polish heraldry is even weirder , because entire clans bear the same arms , and the whole polish nobility only bear about 300 different arms . 
  i appreciate your work , but i really think you should link the cognate names together . 
  the game allows for linking different shapes of same name in different languages , so that the regnal numbers follow as they should ( so that if there was a previous king guillaume of france , and an englishman named william acquires the throne , he 's called william ii ) , and so that characters change names when they convert culture . 
  i also have a compiled list of carantanian names , and i 'll probably try to make a mod that adds them , as they were still relevant in 769 ... 
  wake up sheeple !, 
  the jewish world domination conspiracy is real !, 
  other * treponema pallidum * diseases ( for example [ yaws ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yaws ) ) are spread in africa and south asia . 
  however , those are not sexually transmitted . 
  it 's very likely that first settlers carried a strain of the bacterium to america , and there it developed into syphilis . 
  if i recall correctly , ingame `` great pox '' is n't sexually transmitted , but `` aztec disease '' is , so `` great pox '' is most likely a disease like yaws . 
   \u00de\u00f3rr !, 
  ftfy, 
  again this depends on what tradition you follow . 
  in german tradition , the animals on dexter side usually face to the sinister . 
  but that would be just the opposite from this coa , with the lions combatant .
