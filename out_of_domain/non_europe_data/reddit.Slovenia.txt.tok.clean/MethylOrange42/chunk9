  also , they have insane compound words . 
  example :, 
  * x\u0142p\u0313x\u0323\u02b7\u0142t\u0142p\u0142\u0142sk\u02b7c\u0313 * means `` he had had in his possession a bunchberry plant '' . 
  orchestral ! = classical , but yes, 
  as an european , i can confirm this . 
  wow , that 's one big instrument . 
  are you sure ? 
  i started going to university in october , and ~ 20 % of us listen to metal , but most of us do n't look like metalheads at all . 
  ... that 's the reason why djent should be considered a genre on its own and not just a guitar tone used by some prog metal bands . 
  ... not even abbath ? 
  wrong subreddit , son . 
  1st in 3rd row is one of gorgoroth ex-members i think ... but black metal is not really my area of expertise , so i 'm not really sure . 
  i 'm sure it 's not dead though , his facepaint was simpler . 
  you 're right about abbath . 
  ca n't miss him , really . 
  physics . 
  my duck is sick . 
  needs more chest hair . 
  makeup . 
  shaving legs . 
  high heels . 
  i guess i 'm weird , but i 'm attracted to spontaneity , so it just ruins it for me . 
  one ? 
  there 's so many of them !, 
  let 's say kim kardashian . 
  just because i find her especially unattractive . 
  as a slav , i approve the message . 
  ( scholar mode on ), 
  major keys are not 0 % , but traces . 
  [ the number of the beast ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mhe6fms46o ) anyone ? 
  [ dekadent ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vffuysqg2i ) mostly uses major key in their songs . 
  and they play black metal . 
  i guess [ dragonforce ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrt54xjiq7w ) counts too . 
  meh , / r/vogonpoetrycircle is much more foetid . 
  you see , that is one of the reasons why we wear underwear . 
  yes , it 's from there . 
  i personally think he 'd look best with the design on large picture , but with more braids . 
  a bit like [ hammurabi in game civ4 ] ( http://www.civfanatics.com/gallery/files/1/gamespot_bts525_09_original.jpg ) looked like . 
  insightful . 
  it 's refreshing to see something serious instead of jokes and feel stories we usually see . 
  it probably used to be 20 % 20 years ago , and the joke is just really old . 
  as long as they 're not too hairy , yes . 
  but if they are ... it becomes a lose-lose situation . 
  it 's not just about leg hair , but i mentioned it specifically because it 's most obvious . 
  what the fuck ? 
  i 'm a guy and have no idea how can this be even remotely possible . 
  what a title . 
  for a moment i thought this was / r/circlejerk . 
  this is so awesome . 
  i 've been trying to find music like this for almost a year . 
  i have just turned 19 , and am not the forever alone type . 
  actually , celeborn = teleporno ( meaning `` silver-tree or silver-tall '' ) ; celeborn is in sindarin , while teleporno is in telerin . 
  i 'm 6 ' 1 '' ( not really that tall , but still ) and yes , it feels great . 
  makes me feel so protective . 
  this made me cry ... 
  there are always some rotten apples spoiling the cause . 
  in general i agree with you , but let 's get a bit more detailed . 
  if a girl is attractive enough , she will look attractive with and without makeup . 
  but it is different . 
  if i was to describe , such girl without makeup would be cute and hot with makeup . 
  i personally prefer the cute type , so i 'd say no makeup . 
  sometimes when i see girls with more makeup , i even try to imagine how much cuter they would look like without . 
  on other hand , if a girl does n't look good without makeup because of skin texture or facial features , there is nothing you can fix with makeup . 
  you need to apply way to much to hide bad skin , while trying to correct face geometry most of the time turns out just bad . 
  however , despite i do n't like makeup much , i think it is appropriate to apply some when dressed up . 
  however , subtlety is the key . 
  oh look a new board / shr / . 
  wait , what ? 
  none at all . 
  completely dry . 
  i did n't even know precum existed until i decided to check why is coitus interruptus considered unsafe method , and it said that precum can contain some sperm cells . 
  i was like , what the fuck is precum ? 
  who the fuck coughs like this ? 
  i never make a fist . 
  do n't think about what ** should ** be included . 
  this is never a good idea . 
  instead , think about what is it with different post-rock that you like , then just try to make together a sound that you like the most . 
  if it sounds post-rock-y , it is post-rock . 
  end of story . 
  the title made me think of [ this song ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jitz-unjoza ) . 
  re-fucking-post , faggot, 
   published on mar 8 , 2013, 
  no wonder that 's the first time you heard it . 
  it 's from the new album . 
  ... and i think the croats want their name right for it too . 
  they are somehow arguing that since they were in austria-hungary too , it is also part of their heritage . 
  more than just one letter ; we say klobasa , and they say kobasica !, 
   spaghetti does n't fall out, 
  he should wait for tau day . 
  dude , i 'm actually on keto right now . 
  the faggot detector prevents you from posting, 
  edit : dis gun be god checkmate atheists, 
   using condoms, 
   not practicing consensual sex in the missionary position for the sole purpose of procreation, 
  apparently altan urag and yat-kha were already mentioned , so i can just confirm that they are awesome . 
  if you are in mood for even heavier stuff , try tengger cavalry [ ( 1 ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra2f4ec9bog ) [ ( 2 ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmrco_xlppo ) . 
  the band is from beijing , but they play mongolian-inspired folk metal ( frontman is from inner mongolia , i think ) . 
  they also have an [ acoustic album ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aw9tzc_7jr0 ) . 
  my high school crush was like this . 
  if you are good looking , it just adds to the cuteness , so do n't worry .
