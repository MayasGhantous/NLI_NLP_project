  i 'll mind that next time or if they remove the post ... glad you like eet !, 
  thanks , i 'm hoping for a moment of inspiration !, 
  thank you kind sire, 
  except the right one is not exactly black , 
  this is beautiful , almost poetic ... the ost from ffx is titled [ someday the dream will end ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xrcjjitr7i ), 
  [ madtv parody ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tryuz-dhe8 ), 
  it 's like when you 're dreaming , except you 're aware ( your body is asleep but half of the brain is awake ) ... it can turn into a pleasant experience like lucid dreams , but usually i have to `` force '' myself out of the paralysis , like gasping for air and trying to reach the surface ... 
  accordingly , he lives in slovenia - [ chicken shaped country ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jy1qob4.png ) ... heck , the name contrains love , so there must be a god !, 
  i wan na bathe in this website !, 
  is this html5 ? 
  wow , is there a video of this ? 
  looks amazing , almost sinister ... [ made something similar ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/150uzu/made_this_in_3_sessions_at_a_810_for_my_fellow/ ), 
  thought so , hope to see canvas tag incorporated in more websites , with stunning visual interactivity, 
  agreed , the lowtown of the city also gave a special feeling to it ( [ ost for nostalgia ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842h82_phoy ) ] . . academia is also magnificent but it 's a pain in the a ** when there 's an encounter every 5 seconds urghh, 
  like it , deff in ff style ... watch out for [ kerning ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kerning ) tho, 
  me too , cassini tok about 350 of them , but could n't send them to huygens ' channel and were never received here on earth ... a shame , [ this documentary ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aobclbd3iag&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t= ? ), 
  explains the expedition in details, 
  [ for the lazy ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvkdfj9pkrq ), 
  [ kanye west - 808 's & heartbreak ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymoghl4nwpc&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=ple79b9489ce6ac550&amp;feature=results_main ) . 
  highly underrated album full of soul and emotion portrayed through mix of electronic voices and rhythm ... 
  so if there 's auto-tune altering kanye 's voice , it automatically makes it bad ? 
  i find this album one of the few where at actually makes it better ... in my opinion these songs are n't `` just another rap-auto-tune songs '' ... they 're different ... but that 's just me, 
  saved the video , hope to watch it whole some other time ... but the scene at sector 7 was truly amazing , maybe it 's even better with the movie soundtrack , shivers !, 
  also props on the models , a big upvote for you, 
  [ the glitch mob - drink the sea ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvqpx5muj0g ), 
  edit : whoa gold , thanks !, 
  in a long forgotten cave , under the veil hides [ the oracle ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1hnm0pw.png ), 
  wish they 'd just put in material from versus xiii ... dark , moody , classy/modern ambient with lots of sword swirls and magic flying around !, 
  at this point , i do n't really care as long as it 's released in this century, 
  i guess it 's true , there are people with internet too !, 
  on the lower left side there s a legend ( stars-favourites , bubbles - comments , and llamas are like badges users on da can send to each other ),

  how was working with amy poehler ( aka leslie knope ) like on the parks and rec . 
  show ? 
  and hershel 's leg !, 
  god i forgot how good washed out are ... also , [ new theory ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sntf70ax2ms ), 
  i 'm working on something similar ... is there some sort of back story to the town in the background . . is that snooland ? 
  desktop without the t. . . for some reason, 
  yes , i have like 150 shots from the gameplay and each could be set as wallpaper . 
  the lightning , shadows , blurry-ness etc. 
  are really well rendered in the game imo + stunning landscape and imagery = epic game ! ... crystal dynamics have really outdone themselves . 
  is this true ? 
  i thought `` black '' was offensive for `` african-american '', 
  there 's no hatred against americans in slovenia , we just have a certain mentality to generalize all americans ( as seen through hollywood films and shows . . fat , dramatizing know-it-alls ) ... we 'll judge the person based on the first impression , but will still hold the stereotype in the back of our heads i think . 
  wow . 
  this needs massive upvotage, 
  she 's his sister from the same mister . 
  she 's the worst person in the world , [ the wooorstttt ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axfrktiifdo ), 
  some time ago , when it was called versus i think the developers announced a free-roaming world map so that 's a good thing, 
  dat serious look ... she just wants to act like a human , putting her paw on the table and shit, 
  would you say skaylur is a b-b-b-b, 
  i read that as `` in one string '', 
  how do you get it out of the blender ? 
  with tortilla chips, 
  at 6 meters i sweat like a pig and closed, 
  most watches have the time set to 10:10, 
  add a splash of bottled water and you 've got a stew going, 
  for me , its ffxii . . the story is shit but overall the game 's stunning ost , gameplay and scenery make up for that . . but then again im feeling extremely nostalgic, 
  i also like to bash ctrl + c when i 'm copying ... you know , just to make sure . 
  the last remnant . . is it an enjoyable rpg ? 
  is n't that the song lyrics from one of alt-j 's tracks ? 
  thanks for the input , i just do n't wan na get bored after a couple fights you know, 
  do n't know where you got that asian pic , but [ this ] ( http://myworld4download.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/lara-croft-tomb-raider-2013-character.jpg ) is how lara looks now, 
  at first glance i though : `` why would anyone want to restore an actual axe shampoo ? '', 
  yes i 'm dumb, 
  hahaha fuuuck this cracked me up, 
  we monkeys !, 
  sorry but i ca n't see shit ... the sun looks amazing tho, 
  is this worth buying ? 
  how long till it starts to bore you ? 
  also i heard the game is not so bug-free ... 
  is zero a natural number tho ? 
  hi , you can check my work at http://celestialpot.tumblr.com/ . . have not worked in ios7 style , but am aiming for that sleek minimal design , pm me if interested !, 
  thanks , i 'm subbed to orangered ever since i got my badge and like the idea of reddit having a role-playing aspect to it . 
  i might do more stuff in the future , just need ideas ( like different chroma landscapes and symbols ), 
  `` i ca n't even get a taxi '' hahaha damn , really catchy tune, 
  the dicktator, 
  too soon man, 
  it 's funny how the rock starts bleeding towards the end lol, 
  thanks for the feedback !, 
  * i want that crispy looking icons with full-color pixels . . 
  * huh , that 's weird ... does the text show normally when not translated ? 
  * how would distinguish links from text . . do you recommend any specific hue ? 
  * it 's because the overflow x is set to hidden , do n't know why it shows that way on mobile though ... will have to change the footer-line, 
  thanks again , i appriciate it !, 
  sounds like something michael scott would say jokingly , to meredith perhaps, 
  i wear it more like an accessory and usually check the time on my phone anyway . 
  i have this subtle [ 420 hitman watch ] ( http://i.imgur.com/c11s1lc.jpg ), 
  parent trap . 
  i watched it non-stop while i was sick and we had it on tape . 
  was certain that lindsay lohan had an identical twin , oh the disappointment . 
  i wanted to believe ... 
  the level of detail is just amazing , your mom rocks !, 
  he 's nervous , but on the surface his boobs are steady, 
  this is just scary , the way his lower jaw is hanging . . maybe try r/fearme,
