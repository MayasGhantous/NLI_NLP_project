i think you 'll find that the vast majority of the native american populations were still doing quite well when the states decided to '' ... dissolve the political bands which [ had ] connected them ( to europe ) ... '' and `` assume among the powers of the earth , the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature 's god entitle them ... '', 
  what the yanks did after that ... not our fault - by thier own declaration . 
  here 's some specific information about smart meter deployment in different parts of europe ; a big benchmark in the uk is 2021 . 
  if it has * science * or * studies * in the name it probubly isnt either, 
  it 's like countries that have * democratic * or * people 's * in the name, 
  i think the schengen zone has just as much practical claim to being europe as the eurozone . 
  borders . . that 's just , like , your opinion man . 
  belgium is in the same bag as oman and libya . 
  that might clash with the blue ... try using white or better yet , yellow, 
  do n't forget the antarctic claims, 
  a colder version of canada . 
  you 're right . 
  i might just make it a bit thicker than the internal borders ... otherwise great !, 
  good point, 
  how ? 
  the us has n't been able to force cuba to remove communism - and the us has an army . 
  we 're kinda not really friends . 
  the governemnt there banned clapping in publick recently ... how do you talk to people like that ? 
  i laughed so hard, 
  thanks for thi,

  the map is a year old, 
  i know , but they looked very similar , so i put it in there, 
  did you mis the date when the article was published -- 7 years ago , so wiki has been dead for just under 3 years now , has it ? 
  no , it is n't .

  comparison of russia and the usa broken down into individual statistics [ here ] ( http://www.visionofhumanity.org/#page/indexes/global-peace-index/2013/rus,usa/over ),

  invading russia in the winter was foolish, 
  yes , late summer , but was originally planned for spring, 
  i would 've said the same a few years ago , but serbia was among the hardest hit by the gas crisis and not having heating in the middle of winter tends to have a negative effect on public opinion, 
  this puts it in really stark terms ... 
  i 've been following what 's been going on in this regard with great interest , but only now do i actually see how blatant this confrontation actually is . 
  i 'd love to start one , but we 'd need enough reliable sources to defend it from deletion . 
  since the press does n't really do much big picture analysis on this , i doubt it could fly at this point . 
  unless i 've missed something . 
  i just do n't think that there 's enough to work with just yet - big picture analysis wise ... 
  if you know of some especially good examples of that , i 'd be glad to see what they are . 
  just in case you wanted to see what was discussed there ... the videos are now up ( all of them as far as i can tell ), 
  the more you know . 
  wait , are you sure that it 's not the number with religion ? 
  the distribution seems very suspicious to me in the west, 
  * blue : abolished for all crimes, 
  * green : abolished for crimes not committed in exceptional circumstances ( such as crimes committed in time of war ), 
  * orange : legal form of punishment but not used in the last 10 years ( or has a moratorium in effect ) . 
  * red : legal form of punishment for certain offenses, 
  that 's a win no matter what you 're comparing it to . 
  wait , poland - wtf ? 
  ah yes ... when borders get squiggly , people get squiggly . 
  i bet he supports human rights commitment as well .

  have an upvote, 
  it 's like an axis of luke right through the alps, 
  the word you were looking for is impeccable, 
  can i give you some fucking fruit juice ? 
  there is some legitimacy to the end part of the article - the idea of subsidising standby capacity as well, 
  south africa is interesting, 
  does anyone else see an outline of prussia ? 
  how come berlin is the biggest recipient in the former ddr ? 
  yes , i can see that . 
  but why ? 
  why is it more dependent on transfers than the rest of the former ddr ? 
  cities , especially capital cities , generally outperform their hinterland . 
  [ why is berlin different ?

  well , that was certainly worth it . 
  it 's like an advert for draft dodging . 
  when i was a kid the more important factor was the enormous amount of tv that you got in german in your basic cable package, 
  you missed one, 
  you ca n't invade asia with an exposed western flank ... hitler and napoleon obviusly never played risk,

  [ from wikipedia  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_syrian_kurdish%e2%80%93islamist_conflict ), 
  on october 23 the ypg launched an offensive to capture the strategic town of al-yarubiyah ( til ko\u00e7er ) and its border crossing . 
  fighting continued for three days as the ypg advanced on the town , capturing the villages of mazra'a and seiha as well as 7 military posts previously held by the jihadists . 
  [ 83 ] on 26 october the ypg took control of the yarubiyah border crossing with iraq [ 84 ] as well as the town itself . 
  on october 28 isis front in oil-rich \u00c7il axa region completely collapsed and ypg captured villages of girhok , yusufiy\u00ea , sefa , cin\u00eadiy\u00ea , gir\u00ea fat\u00ea , eb\u00fb hecer and mezraa kelem while remnants of the isis forces fled to tall hamis and tal brak . 
  [ 87 ] this led to forces from the tawhid and jihad brigade in al-hasakah being completely surrounded around \u00c7il axa area . 
  on october 29 , the group , including it 's commander surrendered to the ypg . 
  as of the latest information available . . last update was a couple of days ago, 
  it 's not about the islands , but about the seabed in the eez around the islands, 
  the titanic looks really puny, 
   the balkans and countries of former yougoslavia as some backwards retarded societies . 
  it 's fucking ridiculous . 
  it 's certainly overblown , oversimplified and overgeneralised , but it is n't completely ridiculous .
