  a lot of the really stupid stuff is actually shared by the big 3 . 
  a lot of the problem is that most christians and jews have the good sense to be hypocrites about their religion , whereas too many muslims still take this crap seriously . 
  per capita would be better ... obviously luxembourg ca n't send as many troops as the us, 
  latin america did n't come out of nowhere . 
  it 's as much a legacy of european colonisation as north america . 
  the important difference is one of gdp not of dna . 
  europe has plenty of links with latin america , but they tend to be proportional to money . 
  there are others in the waiting room as well .

  everybody else is playing monopoly . 
  poor greece .

  after the ukraine gas debacle a few years ago , europe has been building gas storage , lng terminals and reverse flow pipeline capacity like crazy . 
  also , the triple20 agenda on renewables and energy efficiency is making more of a dent with every month that passes . 
  also , i do n't know how much of this sort of posturing russia can afford ... their exports are dominated by hydrocarbons , so it 's a very expensive card to play , and not a very effective one at this point, 
  add to that the fact that the winter has just ended ... bad timing for putin,

  a lot of it is people moving from the sparsely populated areas to the more populated ones . 
  and the empty areas are getting emptier as forcibly settled siberians move to the cities or die and their children move to the cities,
