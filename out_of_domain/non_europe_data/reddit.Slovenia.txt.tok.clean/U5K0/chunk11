  i do n't get it, 
  it may be inflation ... most of the green european countries are either part of the eurozone or have currencies pegged to the euro,

  anyone who says that serbian and croatian are separate languages is n't objective . 
  if their ethnic background is local to the area , chances are that their judgement is clouded by non-academic factors such as recent history .

  if this is about ukraine , he 's fucked up monumentally . 
  this will cement anti russian sentiment in ukraine for at least a generation , and in the long run that matters a lot,

  but for those of us who are n't insane , this is a good thing . 
  there 's no way this stand up in court - especially since the statement has now been proven as true . 
  in a fight between the interests of ripped off consumers on the one hand and the interests of a massive foreign multinational corporation which makes an obscene profit , the winner is a foregone conclusion .

  this is n't a law yet . 
  so far , it 's just been an agreement between a number of device manufacturers which was midwived by the european commission .

  i did n't call any of our meps ( i 'm from slovenia ) , but i did send a number of emails during the acta debate and i got what seemed to be an acta-form-reply . 
  more importantly , the epp members changed their positions in the correct direction and the others stuck to their guns .
