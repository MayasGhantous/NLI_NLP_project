  i do n't know what this means . 
  the plans were actually more ambitious originally :, 
  the project was downsized partly due to its possible impact on geese and other migration birds .

  just wanted to see if the music would fit really . 
  there 's a difference between irrigation and reclamation . 
  it seems to me that pan-slavism would essentially be a soft version of joining russia , since they 're the largest slavic country by far . 
  i do n't like the idea . 
  it may look nice on a map , but in the real world , i 'm far more comfortable with the rest of central europe . 
  i can see myself feeling at home in most european countries , even in parts of latin america , canada or australia . 
  not in russia though . 
  any place where you ca n't spit on the church and get away with it just creeps me out . 
  russia just seems more and more like a bigger , colder version of texas . 
  russian peacekeeping : `` i keep a piece of this , a piece of that ... another piece here , maybe a piece there ... '', 
  i do n't like some parts of that culture very much . 
  the fact that russia protects it to the detriment of individual liberty is a bad thing , not a good one . 
   you and some other slavs already lost religion under pressure from vatican ... 
  good riddance to bad garbage . 
  religion sux . 
  i have better things to do with my time . 
  fyi , [ real slavic religion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavic_mythology ) has nothing to do with some mentally ill jewish egomaniac from the bronze age .

  seems easier to just synthesize hydrocarbons and use them in conjunction with existing infrastructure, 
  it 's ok to be disappointed with majority opinion . 
  first , religion is not a genetic trait , and in the event of trans-generational transmission , remains curable . 
  second , the article you cite mentions projections below 10 % for 2020 and a qualified ( and in my opinion questionable ) figure of 25 % for the year 2100 . 
  the question is * play sport ? 
  * , not * exercise ? 
  i jog , cycle , swim and ski , and my answer would be no . 
  sorry about that , i must have skipped to the end without noticing,

  dude , the islamic contribution to scientific progress has been virtually nonexistent for centuries now . 
  they did some great work back in the day , but it all ended with the sacking of baghdad and the changes in theology which happened at the time . 
  it 's sad , really . 
  a billion people who were once a driving force for progress , neutralised by a change in dogma . 
  when are you coming ? 
  the place is n't really green yet , but it should be in a month or two . 
  yes , but the whole thing went to hell when the theology changed slightly around the same time as the sacking of baghdad . 
  the city was rebuilt but the ideas never recovered .

  the ep has only existed in its current role and with its current powers since 2009 when the treaty of lisbon took effect . 
  in my view most of the dirty compromises are made in the council . 
   sixteen of 68 bumblebee species in europe are at risk ,,

  to be fair , that may be adjusted - ca n't guarantee it is n't . 
  there 's always the rock,

  the council still has a chance to screw this up - as is their tradition . 
  the council is the upper house of the eu legislature and is filled with representatives of the member state governments .

  enrollment in upper secondary education , regardless of age , expressed as a percentage of the total population of official upper secondary education age . 
  yes ... this has been cross-posted to r/slovenia, 
  where is this taken from ? 
  i 'd like to see some of the other answers, 
  edit : found it, 
  is n't australia a country with most of its population stuck between a rising ocean and a drying desert ? 
  just seems an odd thing to do . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but is n't most of australia 's population quite tightly sandwiched between a rising ocean and a drying desert ? 
  seems like an odd thing to do , that 's all . 
  i 'm 23 and when i was a teen , i thought holograms would bee a mainstream display technology by now .

  yea , africa was fine . 
  source ? 
  well , hitler was n't blonde either, 
  the same article says, 
   turnout and results were questioned by many news sources based on publicly available website traffic statistics relased by alexa internet and similar providers . 
  according to the critics , throughout the duration of the poll , the website only received approximately 135,000 visits ( 3.6 % of eligible voters ) .
