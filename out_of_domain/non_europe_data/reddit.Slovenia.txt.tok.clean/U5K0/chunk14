  hence the precautionary principle as opposed to some sort of historical feel good theory . 
  i like it . 
  it provides perspective on how oblivious an entire society can be regarding certain blind spots . 
  for me , that 's the whole point of retrofuturism - to see the sorts of mistakes people make .

  the implications differ drastically compared to wars between opposing alliances of large european countries, 
  in the same way , every war could be called a world war because it happened in the world,

  because it 's a different ranking . 
  you 're looking at reporters without borders , i linked to freedom house . 
  that threat gets less scary every year . 
  this has more to do with climate change and the current account balance .

  this sort of thing can turn around fairly quickly given the right set of circumstances . 
  if cyprus gets resolved , which is likely given the confluence of interests , and if they stop locking up journalists , which ... ok , yea , red giant it is . 
  stupid flanders, 
  i 'll show myself out . 
  europe introduced a number of usage restrictions on neonicotinoid use as a precaution so that conclusive data could be gathered without the risk of doing too much further damage in the meantime . 
  as a european , we told you so !, 
  given how many people do n't vote , i 'm surprised they do n't get a greater percentage of the vote . 
  until people accept their share of responsibility for the country in the form of showing up once every 4 years , they deserve everything they get in my opinion, 
  people learn to be rational when reality punishes irrationality,

  the actual title :, 
   turnout for european parliament election slumps in several countries, 
  as a matter of fact the overall ** turnout is projected to rise ** slightly . 
  i think the title should be tagged as misleading . 
  also , these different far-right factions will eat each other alive given a chance .
