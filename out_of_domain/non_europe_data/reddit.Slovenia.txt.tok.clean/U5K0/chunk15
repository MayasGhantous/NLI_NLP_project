  it 's happened before and they 've already started during the campaign . 
  these parties are a threat on a national level where they could have an influence on the overall political discourse . 
  they 're irrelevant at the european level . 
  more than last time, 
  the slopes around granada seem like a perfect place to blanket with all sorts of collection devices, 
  they 've taken ... 
  now we know what came first, 
  i do n't need to prove that your product is dangerous . 
  you need to prove that it 's safe . 
  many treats when split apart, 
  that worked great with tobacco , asbestos , leaded gasoline , etc. 
  innocent until proven guilty applies to people , not merchandise . 
  the efsa is not mandated with feeding the world . 
  its job is to ensure the safety of food sold in europe . 
  the issue of premature accession has come up repeatedly regarding these two countries . 
  it 's the main reason for increased caution related to their schengen entry . 
  just sold , i think . 
  bans on growing gmos is a national competence as far as i know . 
  of course importing the seeds is an eu competence , so it 's complicated . 
  people just voted for him because of the beard . 
  it 's all so political !, 
  just thought it was a nice picture . 
  i live near [ kamnik , slovenia ] ( http://www.visitljubljana.com/file/473275/izlet-domzale-kamnik.jpg ) so i 'm pretty jaded when it comes to mountains and trees . 
  i wonder who would end up doing the brickwork . 
  is it odd that i read that with a middle-class accent ? 
  [ better ] ( http://www.keabtium.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/comic-con-logo-ff.jpg ), 
  [ eu compared to eeu - big difference ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bfttmazr9so/tk6pbyahxki/aaaaaaaaafs/dbuxd0jjdrs/s1600/russian+economic+union.jpg ), 
  [ well , they were pretty friendly with the nazis until they got invaded themselves ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov%e2%80%93ribbentrop_pact ), 
  other than the fact that they declared war on the reich in the absence of a direct attack on them . 
  also , the russians were kind enough to lay down covering fire while hitler invaded poland . 
  do n't remember anything like that on the part of the democracies . 
  a private fan-club is n't comparable to a non-aggression pact and a coordinated invasion followed by a division of spoils and subsequent trade in military equipment and raw materials . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german%e2%80%93soviet_commercial_agreement_ ( 1939 ), 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german%e2%80%93soviet_commercial_agreement_ ( 1940 ), 
  they did, 
  edit - they also did lend lease before then - to the good guys , unlike the russians who did something similar for the axis . 
  they also have close to half the population , so ... 
  but you do n't like it either , i suppose, 
  [ i live here . 
  ] ( http://www.visitljubljana.com/file/473275/izlet-domzale-kamnik.jpg ) that 's sort of the average of what the country looks like - so it 's not much of a tourist spot . 
  you know of a place that 's greener ? 
  at least [ we has potato now ] ( http://www.europatat.eu/asp/index.asp ), 
  welcome to the 40 \u215d . 
  we ca n't afford jackets . 
  which of those is more likely to make you happy ? 
  [ terrorism is everywhere ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberty_leading_the_people ), 
  i meant slovenia . 
  i 'm sure the netherlands are nice in their own way , but probably with less alps . 
  it is n't historically russian . 
  also , it 's being oppressed . 
  russia opened it with crimea . 
  you 're right . 
  we should all roll over for putin . 
  that should calm things down . 
  and that 's where ukip get the votes . 
  would havings to dub overs, 
  i do n't have to . 
  the davos forum has a youtube account . 
  i 'd be surprised if this were much different - except for the orgies , obviously . 
  the one at area 62 ? 
  if you get really good at it you get tax breaks . 
  when he and his colleges in the council are allowed to decide who the commission president is , that 's the eu being undemocratic . 
  when the nominee of the winning party gets selected , that 's unacceptable because - why ? 
  edit : i do n't like the guy myself , but his side got the most mandates in parliament and that should be enough for an initial mandate . 
  if he ca n't assemble a majority , it falls to schultz . 
  slovenia should be red . 
  dr\u017eavni zbor means state assembly . 
  well , [ ptuj is a nice town . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/ptuj_panorama_02.jpg/1280px-ptuj_panorama_02.jpg ), 
  those are the two options . 
  russia never really belonged in that group anyway . 
  the castle would also be a good idea at some point during your trip . 
  for the view . 
  because it 's not an advanced industrialised economy . 
  calm down . 
  are you being paid by the hour or by the word ? 
  laughing at reality is what kremlin trolls are paid to do after all . 
  saudi arabia has a higher gdp than denmark . 
  that does n't make it more advanced . 
  why would putin pay you to be reasonable ? 
  that 's soviet hardware , not russian . 
  btw , the dominant player in commercial space launches is arianespace , not russia . 
  iraq is in the middle east . 
  ukraine is n't . 
  [ we could lower the mediterranean . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atlantropa ), 
  broken link, 
  why do the baltic states have a single design for all the coins ? 
  sds je pobudnik referenduma , ker so proti noveli . 
  nsi in sls sta proti referendumu , ker je predrag . 
  vladne stranke so verjetno proti referendumu in za novelo , ker so jo tudi izglasovali . 
  so the finally introduced this . 
  i have n't been to facebook for a long time for other reasons . 
  now i know i 'm not going back . 
  i stand by my point . 
  a simpler life ... such wisdom, 
  yup . 
  being surrounded by allies can only be a good thing . 
  also , if you look at a map , montenegro would finish nato consolidation in the adriatic and is also the last major part of the northern mediterranean coastline yet to be incorporated . 
  it 's very difficult to kill a healthy , concious human using nothing but a knife .
