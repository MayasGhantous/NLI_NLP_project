  mass killing is nearly impossible , especially when you consider the emergency response infrastructure that exists in developed countries now .

  it finds no difference between people transported by police compared to ambulances . 
  the relevant numbers on shooting vs stabbing are :, 
   a third of patients with gunshot wounds ( 33.0 percent ) died compared with 7.7 percent of patients with stab wounds . 
  tldr : thanks for proving my point . 
  great thing about capitalism : the bar across the street serves assholes . 
  a bullet does n't just punch a hole as big as itself , it cavitates and causes a lot of damage to the tissue around its path - especially the sort of soft tissue that vital organs are made of . 
  you do n't have to hit the liver to cause massive bleeding from it for example . 
  denmark makes natural gas and stores it in the normal underground way . 
  the thing is it takes time to deploy this stuff across the continent and the same goes for extra transmission capacity . 
  like i said , someone messed up . 
  this should have been done in parallel with renewables deployment . 
  you can just see where they started adding the cooler features .

  they stitched in a more detailed map of the entire damascus area and it probably covered up the label, 
  the vast majority of religious people ignore well over 30 % of their holy books and claim they do n't .

  russia is not a superpower . 
  nato is a defensive structure by treaty provision . 
  the only time it has deployed otherwise was with a un security council mandate . 
  something which can not be given against the will of russia . 
  why is that being downvoted ? 
  nato was not involved in iraq . 
  it carried out a un mandated operation in afghanistan for which russia provided , and continues to provide , logistical support . 
  most of the retaliation would go over the arctic , which is far away from eastern europe .

  the mediterranean sea only exists because it gets refilled by water from the atlantic . 
  the idea is to close off the gibraltar and wait for the sea level to drop . 
  then you 'd have extra land to work with and you could let water from the atlantic come in through turbines and make insane amounts of hydro power . 
  you could also split the place into the higher level western med and the even lower level eastern med with a second dam between the now close tunisia and italy . 
  also a dam at the bosporus .
