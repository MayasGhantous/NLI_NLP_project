  wrong sub-thread , buddy, 
  til, 
  thanks, 
  keller , bunker ... same thing really, 
  i did n't mean anything bad by it , just thought you meant to respond to the comment you quoted , which happens to be just above mine . 
  [ seriously ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vj920cn2hma ), 
  it 's not as if this has transcontinental effects . 
  we do n't need a global ban for it to be effective here . 
  that is the standard eu-approved test, 
  the proper secular way is to use a steak made from deadwood . 
  the directive is quite explicit . 
  before ~ ~ he ~ ~ it gets you, 
  switzerland ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  we 'll export the food you guys can no longer produce when the time comes - in exchange for reasonable compensation . 
  [ an enemy is just someone who 's story you have n't heard yet ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dez_tkluzlg ), 
  yes monseigneur , right away . 
  i applaud your continental pride my fellow civilisation builder , but just to be clear , we do have some idiots here as well . 
  how does one circulate a note ? 
  it sounds so clandestine for some reason . 
  i 'm from slovenia . 
  we have one island . 
  also , i remember seeing a map correlating measles outbrakes in the netherlands with the `` bible belt '' there . 
  and a lack of effective push back mechanisms . 
  yes . 
  good point . 
  so long as it makes a profit , it must be a good thing . 
  would your children like some heroin ? 
  very good deal , i promise . 
  yes . 
  the difference between protected and restricted should be more clear . 
  russian piece-keeping, 
  yes , nation building takes time if you know what you 're doing,

  just east of mosul . 
  not really . 
  most of the fast progress we see takes place in a context that ca n't really fly in space - miniaturisation of circuitry, 
  when it comes to anything else - the specialised detection equipment - , these programmes are the ones creating the cutting edge tech . 
  nobody else does work in something this specialised . 
  that 's a different purple . 
  i 'm not sure , but i think those are ceasefires or other arrangements of some sort . 
  they used to be green and then the regime got the upper hand but there was no word of actual victory in those specific areas . 
  yes , lifetime supply, 
  it 's all fun and games until somebody loses millions of their population . 
  yea , we 'll get right on that . 
  * not counting joint space agencies *, 
  there 's really only one of those . 
  that was sort of my point . 
  only one is being excluded and it represents both the majority of european space capabilities and is second only to nasa in funding and scope of activity . 
  canada is also an associate member .

  they did n't sign it yet , the parliament just approved the signing of it . 
  * children of the nomenclature *, 
  this made my morning . 
  thanks, 
  more fodder for polandball, 
  ecac = european civil aviation conference, 
  eurocontrol = european organisation for the safety of air navigation, 
  ecaa = european common aviation area, 
  eu = european union, 
  eurocontrol is in charge of implementing the single european sky ( integrate fragmented air traffic control ), 
  ecaa is essentially a single market for civil aviation, 
  not sure what ecac does , but their website says they harmonise policy and practices as well as coordinate with non-member parts of the world, 
  in the last israeli-arab war . 
  syria still claims it as their territory . 
  because the us and canada are more selective about which muslim migrants get to migrate . 
  europe gets the rejects . 
  how much do they charge you when you cross into another state ? 
  this applies inside the eu . 
  there are no caps once you go outside of it . 
   roaming fees are about 20 % of their profit , they wo n't let that go without a fight . 
  the fight is over . 
  they 've lost . 
  why should people who travel subsidise those who do n't ? 
  any of this would be subject to competitive pressure anyway . 
  if they try to coordinate an they 'll be slapped with an antitrust fine in the billions . 
  i say bring it on !, 
  once roaming is abolished altogether they 'll all be competing with everybody anyway . 
  that 's due to happen in a couple of years . 
  fight !, 
  fight !, 
  fight !, 
  european cooperating states, 
  essentially the status you have when preparing to become a member where you contribute a small amount to the esa budget , are able to take part in esa programs and actively build up your space applicable industrial base . 
  it makes it extremely difficult to hide corruption . 
  this map is outdated . 
  so make us a map of life expectancy at 16 or whatever . 
  speculation : less industrialisation, 
  do you take requests ? 
  it 'd be great to see a map of life expectancy at , say , 16 or 18 . 
  anyone else freaked out at the fact that we can see the german french border ? 
  btw , the [ upgraded lhc is about to be spun up ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/29u0v8/al_jazeera_english_large_hadron_collider_20/ ), 
  vend was code for slovene at the time . 
  click the audio tab to listen to the radio piece, 
  and how to represent the good looking black people ? 
  no they do n't . 
  also , the government has the right to throw them in prison for treason after they win . 
  seeing as the inhabitants of the area in question have equal representation in all state institutions , your parallel is manipulative and false .
