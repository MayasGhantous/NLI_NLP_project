  the existing parliament was given a mandate which has yet to expire . 
  the fact that some elected representatives `` switched sides '' does n't change this . 
  there is n't a country in the world which dissolves parliament because some politicians changed their position . 
  the presidential election was recognised not only by the eu ant the us , but by russia as well . 
  an ad hoc collection shit-kicking rednecks do n't get veto power over national politics simply because they have access to illegal firearms . 
  so do we, 
  running from the middle east and russia respectively,

  planing to start a people 's republic in istria , are we ?

  [ difference ] ( http://b-i.forbesimg.com/stratfor/files/2013/09/300px-map_of_europe_with_european_and_german_flag.png ), 
  here 's hoping europe follows suit . 
  we 're essentially killing our economy with unilateral measures designed to prevent a problem that will be disproportionately large in other parts of the world . 
  i 'm all for charity but this is rediculous . 
  not right wing , just a fact . 
  if climate policy is n't global you 're just moving carbon intensive activities from one jurisdiction to another . 
  in our case at the expense of local employment . 
  offside . 
  would n't make a difference . 
  he 's a completely replaceable gru agent . 
  i 'll get really worried if austrian miners go on strike . 
  just wait till [ trg republike ] ( http://ipop.si/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/prenova-trga-republike.jpeg ) is renovated so we can into independencia . 
  so , not all of them went to argentina , huh ?

  that 's racist . 
  [ where the title comes from ] ( http://youtu.be/n23_-kj_jzm?t=29s ), 
  just seems like something cinemasinns would say, 
  for the moment more green energy requires more gas plants to jump in during times of low generation and high demand . 
  the slovene text translates as, 
  * 30 years of friendly international fire-fighting competition *, 
  i recognise the name from history class , but i 'd always imagined it as far larger . 
  i misread that as * coffeface *, 
  used to be atlantic ocean , but they told it to fuck off . 
  unofficial eu motto, 
  not quite . 
  not every country is like the us or canada . 
  having an irish passport does n't make you irish either . 
  the thing about an all powerful , unaccountable executive is that they can do bad things as well as good ones , oh and you ca n't get rid of them when they start doing the bad things . 
  be careful what you wish for . 
  apparently non-muslim kids do n't watch the news .

  so , the formerly mexican parts do n't get rain, 
  you people all sound the same to me . 
  [ i know what you mean ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slovene_dialects#regional_groups ), 
   something for our ego, 
  that 's sort of the definition of / r/yurop, 
  do n't know about the country numbers , but the 30 % figure is the share of ** imported ** gas that comes from russia . 
  domestic production accounts for about half of the demand , imports are the other half . 
  so the overall figure should be cca . 
  [ explanation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4k-l1hlj9nk ), 
  / r/slovenia is very influential , like ap and reuters combined, 
  justice league ? 
  in ww2 , because the allied tanks outnumbered the german ones by a double digit factor, 
  if it were anything close to 1 on 1 , germany would be in charge of europe right now, 
  precisely . 
  the russians could destroy ukrainian conventional formations very quickly , but what happens the day after they raise the flag in kyiv ? 
  as reichs go , this one is n't half bad - it 's a softer , fluffier sort of empire, 
  because those terrorists are in a part of the world that does n't matter so long as the oil keeps flowing . 
  strelkov , on the other hand , is causing trouble in europe . 
  nobody cares if there 's a drive-by shooting in new orleans , but do n't try that sort of thing in new york if you know what 's good for you .

  impressive level of integration, 
  the emphasis seems to be against liberal more than the democracy part . 
  the guy is a right wing populist giving a speech to a particularly backward part of his base who long for the good old times of ... well something or other . 
  hopefully we get an apocalypse in this half . 
  i hate it when these things go into penalty kicks . 
  fear of imminent slaughter is a great motivator .
