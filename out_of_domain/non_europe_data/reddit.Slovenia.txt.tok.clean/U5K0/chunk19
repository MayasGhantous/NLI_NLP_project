  edit : i do n't mean to say that all those fitting the above description are anti semites , simply that this is the demographic from which most of the recent wave of antisemitism in europe has been coming . 
  a widespread misunderstanding seems to be that there is some sort of nazi style revival happening . 
  this is n't the case . 
  the hippocratic oath is n't really a great moral standard to reference here or anywhere really . 
  modern codes of medical ethics are superior to it by leaps and bounds - that 's what he violated and that 's why he should be severely punished .

  what goes on in the mid-east is not my business . 
  what happens in europe is . 
  i have yet to see jews cause problems here . 
  edit : the deleted comment expressed the view that there exists an equivalence with young adult jewish males in israel specifically, 
  * young adult muslim male *, 
  what part of that description involves race ? 
  fyi , i was brought up catholic but switched over to the godless heathens for the convenience . 
   muslims are the only people that cause problems of this sort, 
  at this particular time in history , that is the segment of the population where most of this problem is coming from , aside from neo nazis . 
  this is n't to say that all muslims are this way . 
  there 's a massive difference between muslims of the narrower middle east tradition and those who hail from morocco or bosnia or albania or most of the former soviet areas . 
  but i mostly stand by my original comment since a masively disproportionate part of antisemitism stems from the muslim part of the population - even though it may not be a majority opinion within that community . 
  on the issue of antisemitism , on average , yes . 
  i do n't think people should get a cookie for liking themselves more than anyone else does . 
  glorified chicken, 
  i almost did the same thing yesterday , but my dad stopped me really fast . 
  come to think of it , he probably did it too at some point - he reacted really fast . 
  in a situation when it is n't clear what the eu 's plan is , it 's a good bet that the plan is to have a plan at some point . 
  botox - it 's great !, 
  these sort of people need to be given more of a platform,

  that , and some military action immediately after ww1 . 
  the logical thing to do for american atheists is to go and rape someone so as to upgrade your trustworthiness . 
  no need for israel to worry . 
  berlin has their back . 
  this is unlikely to change .

  iraq has leaders ? 
  you can never have too many ports . 
  frontex would love to get their hands on these . 
  to be fair , ideally , you would want to have just one proper border and more than one leader . 
  i originally wrote it as one word , but the spelling function on my android keyboard suggested the two word option and i went with it . 
  actually , it 's more like the us version of ria novosti, 
  this is not the result of a new law , but of a court ruling . 
  hardly an expression of popular or political will . 
  simply a glitch in the constitutional framework . 
  it 'll be fixed , but remember that good things happen slowly in europe . 
  what happens if the do n't pay the fine ? 
  i 'd love to see lichtenstein and andorra there also . 
  i can just hear the conversation .

  if you take a wider historical view , this is back to normal for russia . 
  how long before a country becomes responsible for its own actions ? 
  after all , if it were n't for the muslim takeover of constantinople , the european powers would n't have had to look for new trade routes by ship . 
  russia embargoed fruits and vegetables from europe . 
  off topic : has anyone ever seen putin and michele obama in a room together ? 
  is n't it always ?

  i 'm a european too . 
  relax . 
  even if a few people fly here with the infection it 's easily containable . 
  it 's not like one of the flues where a sneeze or a doorknob can be a source of infection . 
  you need really close exposure to the infected individual - blood , feces , vomit . 
  we 're ell equipped to deal with this if it actually happens . 
  tracking down exposed individuals and isolating them ( which , in this case does n't require high end facilities ) is easy in the european context . 
  also , a full proof way to avoid infection would be to stop swapping fluids for about a month ( the maximal incubation period for ebola ) . 
  smell the coffee, 
  is n't that the normal human attitude toward police of any kind ? 
  libya was the right thing to do as well - even if the result has n't been ideal ( it wo n't be here either ) . 
  the world is a messy place . 
  especially the post war parts that never really had solid state institutions to begin with . 
  also , if you look at some basic human wellbeing indicators , afghanistan has been a clear net positive for the locals . 
  it was strategically mishandled because of the diversion of resources to iraq - which was bad in every way . 
  not really . 
  the countryside around trst was overwhelmingly settled by slovenes at one time , but the population of the city itself was n't majority slovene even in the ao days - though there were more slovenes living there at the time than in ljubljana ( 56 000 compared to 52 000 ) . 
  that is the first statistic regarding this conflict that i could n't give a shit about in a million years . 
  seriously , street lamps are less expendable than this . 
  we 're gon na intercept your trash and put it to good use .

  before the 3rd energy package gasprom was able to put no-resale provisions in the contracts . 
  also , lack of infrastructure to move it around until recently . 
  the prices have been dropping as a result of changes in these areas . 
  from what i hear , the sky is either filled with ice or with fire . 
  if only you could average it out . 
  reminded me of this :, 
  i remember jimmy wales saying that effective censorship requires certain technical interventions that make the internet work quite badly compared to other places . 
  i ca n't seem to find the link to that though .
