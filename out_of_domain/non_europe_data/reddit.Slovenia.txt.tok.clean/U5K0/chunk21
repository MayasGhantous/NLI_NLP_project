  they 'll just get mexico to do it quietly through the back door . 
  lol, 
  this is the sort of religion based stupidity we can tolerate ( enjoy ) . 
  more , please . 
  did n't make it . 
  just found it . 
  there may be a bigger version out there somewhere . 
  edit : this works fine on a tablet though . 
  also not much of a battery leach . 
  please describe what socialism is and provide a source for that description . 
  it 'll still take the roof off , but the walls and the floors will stay put . 
  a tornado creates suction upwards and houses are generally designed simply to resist gravity . 
  if you want tornado-proof , you have to put specialised components in place to anchor every part of the building to the foundation . 
  except that before this none of them were going to join, 
  i 'd say it 's more technocratic than communist nowadays . 
  in europe , we prefer to take a bomb every now and then . 
  maybe the obscene amount of booze we consume has something to do with it . 
  also , we have trains so who gives a damn about airports . 
  tens of thousands die every year on american roads . 
  nobody wants to honour those innocent victims by lowering the speed limit by 10 mph or introducing a federal primary seat belt law . 
  there 's plenty of ways to prevent 9/11 conveniently , so yes , this is total bs . 
  did n't mean to limit the comment only to planes . 
  it happens quite regularly , it 's just that nobody pays attention to this sort of stuff . 
  [ from europol - pdf ] ( https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/publications/europol_tsat14_web_1.pdf ), 
   \u25a0 \u25a0 in 2013 , 152 terrorist attacks occurred in five eu member states . 
  the majority took place in france , spain and the uk . 
  after an increase in 2012 ( 219 ) , the number of terrorist attacks in 2013 fell below the number recorded in 2011 ( 174 ) . 
  as a result of terrorist attacks , seven people died and nine were injured in the eu in 2013 . 
  attacks using firearms were, 
  most frequent in france , and those aiming at criminal damage in spain . 
   \u25a0 \u25a0 as in previous years , more than half of the total number of attacks ( 84 ) were claimed by , or attributed to , separatist, 
  terrorist groups : 58 in france , and 26 in spain . 
  after an increase in 2012 , the number of separatist attacks decreased, 
  significantly compared to previous years , from 110 ( 2011 ) , to 167 ( 2012 ) , to 84 ( 2013 ) . 
  the number of bomb, 
  attacks decreased considerably , from 91 in 2012 to 31 in 2013 , but the number of attacks with firearms, 
  remained stable . 
   \u25a0 \u25a0 the number of attacks by anarchist or left-wing terrorist groups increased from 18 in 2012 to 24 in 2013 , thereby, 
  ending the downward trend observed in previous years . 
  eu member states that reported such attacks are greece , italy, 
  and spain . 
  the number of attacks in greece increased significantly to 12 in 2013 , after decreasing from 6 ( 2011 ) to one, 
  a significant change was noted in the modus operandi : whereas in previous years arson was the most, 
  frequently employed attack method , in 2013 this was bombings . 
   \u25a0 \u25a0 no attacks explicitly classified as religiously inspired terrorism , right-wing terrorism or single-issue terrorism were, 
  reported by the eu member states in 2013 . 
  however , two persons were killed in the uk in two separate terrorist attacks ,, 
  one motivated by religious extremism and the other by right-wing extremist ideology . 
   \u25a0 \u25a0 almost 70 % of the attacks targeted the business sector and private properties in 2013 . 
  the proportion of attacks against, 
  government facilities continued to decrease .

  i 's like when people make fun of the * duck and cover * campaign . 
  if you 're at ground zero of a nuke attack , you 're dead . 
  if you 're a few miles out , the pressure wave damages buildings and you die from falling debris . 
  this is why getting under a desk after a nuclear attack may well save your life . 
  you do n't necessarily get radiation sickness , and even if you do , it is n't anywhere close to 100 % fatal . 
  am i a bad person if this makes me happy ? 
  this concern is easily addressable . 
  just ring-fence the collected funds and lower tax on/subsidise healthy food . 
  to provide some perspective :, 
   ... [ of ] all those people in france who migrated from countries with a dominant muslim population , or whose parents did , only 33 % [ of ] 5 to 6 million people ( 2 million ) said they were practicing believers . 
  let 's try to keep the 2 000 000 figure in mind when we see such statistics .

  there goes my business idea for making isis toilet paper . 
  this is basically replacing the nuclear plants being taken offline . 
  it 'll be a while before it makes any difference in therms of co2 emissions . 
  personally i think they should have prioritised the displacement of coal , but whatever . 
  shamefully ineffective . 
  far too many get through . 
  how do these people plan to make money as europe lowers its orders as time goes on ? 
  pigs would fly, 
  haha !, 
  our muslims are better than your muslims . 
  go somewhere else, 
  could n't we just find some sort of technical problem with their passports and dump them into legal limbo for all eternity ? 
  give it a week, 
  the trash bucket challenge ? 
  no democracy starts out perfect, 
  do you even maths , bro ? 
  seems to be enjoying stronger growth . 
  tunisia and morocco are arab countries . 
  so are the uae , qatar , kuwait , oman and jordan . 
  i sure at least a few of these are civilised . 
  is that really a normal skin tone ? 
  it seems way more yellow than any asian people i 've ever seen . 
  or you could ask denmark to stop a few things heading to/out of saint petersburg .
