  it probably has less to do with language and more with the w\u00f6rk ethic . 
  europe has plenty of problems and limited resources to deal with them . 
  this is n't crucial to our future , nor is it our responsibility to bail out every reckless migrant who intentionally puts themself in a deadly situation .

  ben affleck says you 're a racist . 
  i 'll be rooting for the villain in the next batman movie . 
  oh , and i 'll be pirating it . 
  sam harris was doing the exact same thing as the comment above and affleck completely lost his shit . 
  he seemed to be scared at the very prospect of harris laying out his argument in a calm , reasoned fashion . 
  he 's got a dogma in his head and can0t bear the thought of having it challenged . 
  sad .

  the question had 3 possible answers :, 
  * there is a god, 
  * there is a spirit or life force, 
  * the answer given above, 
  a lot of people seem to go for the second answer . 
  also , france is n't that far ahead . 
  it just got a bit over 40 % . 
  edit : the countries you mention have a low number on the god option : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:europe_belief_in_god_2010.png, 
  the question had 3 possible answers : ( edit : the question is * which of these statements comes closest to your beliefs ? 
  * there is a god, 
  * there is a spirit or life force, 
  * there is n't any sort of spirit , god or life force ( the answer given in the title of the map ),

  that 's why i chose to submit that one . 
  ( edit : the question is * which of these statements comes closest to your beliefs ? 
  are you saying that people who have a belief in any of the above would answer with the third option . 
  also , there was a do n't know option . 
   what answer should a person pick who believes in all three : spirits , god , and life forces ? 
  what about a person who believes in life forces , but not spirits or gods ? 
  certainly not the one on the map , or do you think there are a significant number of people who would ? 
  and even if it has , you do n't need a perfect match to have an effective immune response . 
  as long as it kinda fits you 're massively better off than if you were completely fresh going in . 
  i 'm generally sceptical of bans on animal testing , but in regards to cosmetics it seems reasonable . 
  is the prompt and cheap availability of new cosmetics really worth it ?
