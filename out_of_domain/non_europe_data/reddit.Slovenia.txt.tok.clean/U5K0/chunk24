  i remembered all the pro-energiewende submissions here and thought the negative side should be known as well . 
  very briefly - for any sort of group genetic adaptation to occur , you need two things :, 
  * a relatively isolated population in terms of breeding ( very few people arriving/departing ), 
  * an effective selection pressure - some environmental factor which kills non-adapted people based before breeding occurs or causes them to produce fewer fertile offspring compared to the adapted individuals, 
  if these two conditions are met for a sufficient number of generations genetic divergence with the earth population occurs . 
  i have no idea why anyone would choose to stay in a hell-hole like that . 
  i think you would see colonial abandonment centuries before you would see divergence . 
  that or an improvement in conditions to a state where one or both of the above factors cease to exist . 
  ** tldr : not a chance - on the physical . 
  culturally , of course . 
  sure , but the number of changes which make no or little difference to the shape and charge structure of the antigen far outnumber the group of changes which make a major change . 
  my only point was just that you can have plenty of mutations and still have a useful fit . 
  many people seem to think that the moment you have a mutation your existing library of antibody variants automatically becomes useless . 
  this is n't the case . 
   but if we needed to evolve and adapt to martian life - this would be a necessary evil . 
  that 's sort of my point . 
  we do n't need to . 
  what 's stopping these people from just going back to earth ? 
  more immediately , this would be impossible to get through a vote . 
  if you try to do it by force you essentially have a dictatorship and those are prone to collapse . 
  that can work for one generation where you have a self selected group of committed colonists , but their kids will still have the option of leaving . 
  people leave bad situations all the time . 
  north korea will put you in a starvation camp if you get caught . 
  if you do n't , they do this to any relatives of yours they can find . 
  people still leave by the thousands . 
  the gdr would shoot people to death for trying to cross into west berlin . 
  it did n't work . 
  a few generations if far too long a time scale to sustain a voluntarily present population . 
  i certainly would n't accept a shitty life based on what my parents or grandparents decided . 
  would you ? 
  a draft ? 
  it would be nice if we could avoid fucking up with this the way we did with antibiotics . 
  that 's nice . 
  and end up in the same cell as the skinheads . 
  i 'm sure they 'll bring the best lube money can buy . 
  so what happened to the finance minister who wanted to cut defence in view of ... well , math ? 
  virgin or extra virgin ? 
  in slovenia , it 's `` afna '' = ape, 
  we can use a winch . 
  no reason to put the oxen through a stressful situation like this .

  makes sense for freight i guess , but if i wanted to make a trip that long , i 'd take a plane . 
  this is coming from someone who really likes trains , btw . 
  7000 km is just too far for a train ride . 
  im a big fan of minimalist modern upgrades to legacy environments . 
  of course even the best ideas can be executed badly . 
  i like it based on the pictures . 
  is there something you 've seen in person which they do n't show or is it just a matter of taste regarding the mixing of styles ? 
  is that really the word to use when you destroy a submarine ? 
  i 'm really asking . 
  have you considered getting together with some people and asking that the leds be dimmed ? 
  mine neither . 
  damn immigrants ?

  good thing you 're on our side . 
  how do you feel about the [ reichstag ?

  it seems to spread between mammals quite effectively . 
  the fear is that dogs may be infectious even without symptoms . 
  better safe than sorry ... and dead .

  actually , ab would be best . 
  you can easily dump the cells . 
  i 'm not sure how difficult it is to get rid of the antia and antib while keeping the antiebola , but it 's certainly harder . 
  and where is the kurdish regional government in iraq getting all these spare arms ? 
  for blood . 
  i 'm talking about plasma .

  how do you feel about is ? 
  surprise minority protection !, 
  edit : [ relevant ] ( http://twitter.com/carlbildt/status/524528387055169536 ), 
  why ? 
   the shell companies then transferred the funds to accounts in san marino and luxembourg and the italian companies were then liquidated . 
  luxembourg is an eu member and san marino is completely surrounded by italy . 
  there 's a decent chance that part of the money will be recovered . 
   if we can get them there that fast from the us, 
  that 's not what happened, 
  show me a place that 's doing more . 
  this agreement sets a minimum . 
  for starters , it 's not a pass/fail proposition . 
  there 's always room for things to get worse . 
  the more you heat up the atmosphere , the more energy becomes available for all sorts of * fun * events , not to mention the known multipliers that happen at certain temperature increases and probably some unknown ones as well . 
   at what point to the costs to modern society and developing nations outweigh ... 
  the thing is , if you 're a rich enough country with a competent enough government , you could probably adapt quite well . 
  it 's the developing countries which ca n't really do that ( this is n't ebola , but you can see the parallels in terms of reaction capacity ) . 
  also , they happen to be located in areas where the atmosphere dumps a disproportionate part of its energy . 
  so you 've got a weaker capacity for adaptation combined with a greater disruption . 
  not good . 
  * sometimes when you stand face to face with someone , you can not see his face .

  it 's more that they need to upgrade the remaining borders to schengen standards .
