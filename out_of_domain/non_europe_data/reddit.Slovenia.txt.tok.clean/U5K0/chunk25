  this takes some time . 
  also , since most countries really want in , this is usually used as leverage against them until they do . 
  in the case of romania and bulgaria , this has been used to force through additional anti-corruption and anti-organised crime measures . 
  as the saying goes : if you 're not at the table , you 're on the menu . 
  it should be noted that a number of these banks have had massive capital infusions between the time this data was collected ( end of 2013 ) and today . 
  most shale production is profitable in the low 70s . 
  there 's no such thing as opec if saudi decides to do whatever it wants . 
  right now it seems like they 're keeping production where it is in order to gain market share at the expense of other opec members . 
  i 'm calling bullshit on the eu statement . 
  berlin wo n't agree to any serious sanctions against israel based on this . 
  and when berlin says no , there 's a big group of member states which do n't really care about the issue and will support the german position to get a favour somewhere down the line . 
   but will this lng really be viable if global crude prices of oil slump so much that it causes investors world-wide to stop exploration because it 's not as profitable ? 
  oil and gas prices do n't really move together on the open market . 
  they used to be glued together by contract in a lot of places , but this is less and less common . 
  these are two different commodities with very little fungibility between them . 
  most cars ca n't run on gas and most gas furnaces ca n't run on oil . 
  from what i understand , people are just moving into a handful of big cities there . 
  so you end up with large areas of shrinkage and small ( in terms of land area ) centers of growth . 
  the same thing is happening in china , [ but on a much larger scale .

  i hope esa makes this into a miniseries with an episode per mission . 
  you just missed the open border by a few months . 
  it fell there on 21 december 2007 . 
   what the hell 's going on in belgium ? 
  yes, 
  i was thinking more along the lines of same theme , different scenario . 
  still in the far future , still revealing clues about what things are like , still talking about a mission , but in a different social situation . 
  obviously it would get old if you repeated the master - apprentice dynamic for every mission . 
  with a goatee . 
  because this has been tried multiple times in the past 20 years . 
  it never goes anywhere because each of the * presidents * involved are determined to keep full control of their own private fiefdoms . 
  you ca n't have a union without giving up some sovereignty to a shared pool . 
  the idea of free trade is nice , but it 's not like we 're talking about market economies here . 
  do n't be fooled by the name . 
  this has very little to do with economics . 
  it 's a way for russia to lock down the parts of the former ussr which have n't gone west yet / before they go east ( depending on the area ) . 
  yes, 
  my first thought after reading the title was * where are they now ? 
  after reading your comment , i 'm astonished that this was n't done in ' 99 . 
  also , life extension helps . 
  most of europe , really . 
  because of overpopulation ? 
  i 'm sure radio france has many studios they can switch their feed to . 
  i wish we could achieve things without pain and sacrifice . 
  but humans are n't like that . 
  we stumble , make mistakes . 
  [ but we learn from those mistakes . 
  that 's what being human is all about .

  texas surprises me . 
  any particular reason there ? 
  or we could take iceland and greenland first . 
  of course we 'd have to solve the fish problem first . 
  the place has starbucks and mcdonald 's now . 
  the us may hev lost the war , but it won the peace - big time . 
  the title is misleading .

  also , he 's wrong . 
  the fact that there 's ** no profit in ebola ** is n't the cause , it ** is itself a consequence of the fact that ** nobody in the rich world cares about ebola . 
  lack of demand from rich consumers is one thing , but there 's also an absence of public funding directed toward third world infectious illness . 
  ** this simply is n't important to us . 
  ** the ** manifestation ** of it not being important to us ** is both an absence of private demand * and * of public policy directed to ** ebola and other ** issues which primarily effect poor countries . 
  this is just the it part of this particular iceberg . 
  it seems to be a generally applicable principle in russia that private property is extremely conditional . 
  if you have a strong enough krisha protecting you , it 's just a matter of bribing a judge to seize someone 's company and then buying it on the cheap at a * public auction * with a loan from a friendly bank . 
  these guys make western corporate raiders look like boy scouts . 
  i knew it was chancy , but the idea was that you could just read the bold and get an idea of what i was saying . 
  made me laugh . 
  have an up vote . 
   so dont write off the dirty capitalists yet , becausd they still are the only hope, 
  that was more or less my point . 
  it is n't decadent profit seeking that 's the problem . 
  it 's the fact that people just do n't give damn . 
  it 's really easy to blame the corporations , but anyone could have campaigned for more public funding for this sort of research . 
  how many people cared enough to actually do something ? 
  nobody , because cancer , alzhimer 's and heart disease are more important to us .

   i 'm the only english person left on my road , and it is bloody fantastic . 
  this seems to be a national trait . 
  when slovenia entered the eu a lot of english people started buying up rural real estate . 
  they started in the cheapest region of the country , but once the number of english people rose , the buying immediately moved to the second cheapest . 
  the news people noticed this and had some fun with it . 
  i think they just end up hanging out with [ granpa giotto , cousin stardust and the rest of the family ] ( http://youtu.be/9ptd_jhulbm ) out in space . 
  i think some gratitude toward our austrian oppressors is in order regarding this specific topic . 
  on the bright side , this is just a temporary glitch :, 
   the team ** ruled out rogue emissions ** and instead concluded that a slow down in air circulation in the stratosphere is the likely culprit . 
  ** the effect ** of the change is that it ** concentrates `` old air '' that still carries a higher proportion of hydrogen chloride ** from years gone by . 
  on the whole , the total amount is still decreasing and the ozone layer is still recovering . 
  edit :, 
   `` our results do not change the expectation that ** the ozone layer will recover from the effects of depletion over the next 50 years or so , '' **, 
  it really just looks like a normal highway when you drive on it . 
  you could miss it if you 're not careful . 
  that dog at the end get me every time . 
  * i 'm getting really sick of your shit , bear !, 
  also , it 's a motorway . 
  eyes on the road !, 
  it 's cheaper to just buy building materials and assemble them down here . 
  ca n't do that on the moon though .
