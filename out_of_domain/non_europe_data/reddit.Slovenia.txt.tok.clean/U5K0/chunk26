  i think these videos are genius . 
  they supercharge that childish ( in a good way ) part of our brain that really likes this stuff .

  what 's magical about using nano-tech to teraform a planet ? 
  i actually think this is a remarkably fast fix . 
  it 's less than one human lifetime between the montreal protocol and total recovery . 
  climate change is clearly more difficult , but this shows that these kind of things are doable . 
  edit : then again , i am a european , so i 'm used to good things taking a long time . 
  it 's the bad ones that happen quickly around here . 
  you forgot a highly educated population . 
  the advantage given in the video is that you do n't need to bring the structural strength with you . 
  you make regolith bones . 
  also , you 're transferring the complexity problem from the earth to the moon if you 're digging a large hole . 
  instead of building a fancy printerbot in a factory in bremen , you 're excavating on an alien world where the detailed geology is n't really known . 
  this is n't earth . 
  you ca n't just call in any sort of mechanisation or explosives at will . 
  it 's probably best to have a generic solution at this early stage . 
  i have n't done the numbers and , truthfully , i 'm not going to . 
  however , in the printed base concept , the air pressure ( delta p ) only needs to be great enough to maintain an inflated pressure vessel and as a result the pressure vessel only needs to be strong enough to withstand that pressure . 
  the external structure is self sufficient and passive in terms of load . 
  actually , you could use it as support if you wanted to and hang stuff off of it . 
  in the hole scenario , you need to ad enough delta p to also maintain the material on top an around the balloon . 
  this means you need a stronger pressure vessel and maybe some rigid structural support if you 're not willing to raise the pressure that high . 
  it seems to me that the printable base concept keeps all the difficult work on earth where it can be done quite cheaply , safely and with a low cost of failure . 
  the way i see it , the underground scenario has avoidable risks all over the place . 
  also , the printable version leaves you with the capacity to build all sorts of things once you 're done with the base . 
  something is rotten in the state of ~ ~ denmark ~ ~ russia . 
  itt : people who do n't understand what a pilot project is, 
  perhaps this is just the cocoon of a giant space bug . 
  perhaps this is just the cocoon of a giant space bug . 
  you 're right , if it were n't for this skyped in youtube video , that lander could have been a rover . 
  that 's the most sl ~ ~ e ~ ~ ovenian thing anyone has ever said . 
  no need to bring any documentation . 
  here 's your passport . 
  i swear i just turned it on and the star trek tng intro is playing in the background . 
  [ and it 's operated by predator . 
  ] ( http://www.cnet.com/news/rosettas-comet-is-singing-and-it-sounds-totally-bizarre/ ), 
  i do n't think the russia military should be able to hide behind international law after having formally annexed one part of a sovereign nation and informally occupied another part . 
  jiggle it a little ? 
  especially given the shape of the comet, 
  no , you need one to make you think like a child .

  what is n't attached ? 
  if you look at the extreme lower right margin of the leg it seems to be in contact with the rock . 
  since the leg is flat and the rick is n't you 'd expect one end of it to be in contact with the rock and the other end to be elevated . 
  it could just as easily be upright .

  since the leg is flat and the rick is n't you 'd expect one end of it to be in contact with the rock and the other end to be elevated . 
  how can you tell that it 's in the distance ? 
  so it looks like the consert antenna is tipping it away from the rock . 
  does anyone have the measurements to figure out the angle ? 
  that could be good for the [ comet mri ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/consert ) . 
  it puts them in the perfect spot for my favourite instrument , right ? 
  right ? 
  it 's just high school geometry . 
  why not give it a shot ? 
  i think the real colour of the comet is pitch black ( edit : to the human eye ) . 
  these are all enhanced . 
  what are these things , inches , you speak of ? 
  but , i actually do n't know any of the dimensions . 
  on earth , the lander is 100kg . 
  on the comet , it has the weight of a piece of paper . 
  so , given the speed of falling of the lander and of rocks and things , it may as well be a tank . 
   it sounds to me like he 's saying that nasa is stagnating . 
  it seems to me that nasa may still be traumatised by challenger when they killed a schoolteacher and a group of american heroes on live tv . 
  as far as i know , no other space agency has ever lost anyone . 
  who knows how they would react . 
  probably somewhere screaming at an opinion poll for being racist . 
  i did not know that . 
  til, 
  this is a european mission . 
  it has the theoretical ability to hop , but this is obviously risky and unpredictable . 
  i still wish they would give it a shot once the main battery is dead and they 've done all the science they can in this spot . 
  ... or anything else for that matter . 
  do any of those countries have a launch system ? 
  i 'm so glad they 're giving it a shot . 
  i now love everything about this mission . 
  black and white . 
  but they would n't be much different if they were in colour . 
  they did a few pixels here and there in colour and it turned out it 's just shades of grey . 
  a bit reddish , but just barely . 
  there is n't any mention of this command anymore on twitter . 
  was it scrubbed ? 
  this was asked at yesterday 's esa google hangout . 
  it 's on their youtube page, 
  esa is funded by the governments ( executive ) of member states , not the agencies . 
  source ? 
  yea , i was really surprised by your first comment because i follow esa quite closely and i had n't heard anything about a new member joining . 
  thanks for the clarification . 
  this question was asked of the lander director and he said the jets are unlikely to be strong enough to lift philae due to his density . 
  i can imagine kids asking for an explanation and you could play the * once upon a time ... * videos about this mission . 
   after humanity is long gone, 
  well , are n't we a pessimist, 
  have you considered watching [ cosmos ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cosmos:_a_spacetime_odyssey ) to get oriented on the broad outlines ? 
  it 's really quite good for this sort of thing . 
  if you prefer a more british approach , [ the human universe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_universe ) just came out . 
  this one is much more focused and easier to follow in my opinion . 
  ** i really recommend this one ** to anyone from beginners to veterans .
