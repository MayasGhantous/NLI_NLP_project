  i really only submitted this to get your comment . 
  intentionally or not , this would be the most they could realistically hope to achieve . 
  i do n't think intentions matter in this regard . 
  what matters is the fact that this could happen and if it did , it would be massively detrimental to us and very beneficial to them . 
  which was a result of the repugnance of russia 's civilisational model . 
  and after america , kobane !, 
  hezbollah is a political party as well as a militant organisation . 
  they 're just trying to expand their constituency , look good . 
  this is an easy way of doing it . 
  this woman is among the worst potential consequences of the attacks . 
  the local tourist businesses and residents do a cleaning action every year . 
  these things have become a bit of a national tradition since 270,000 people or 12 % of the population participated in [ the biggest one in 2012 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/let%27s_clean_slovenia_2012 ), 
  the situation in nigeria is more akin to that in iraq than that in france . 
  moral support wo n't do much in either of these cases , but it made a massive difference in france . 
  doubt that it will . 
  jussive renewable energy deployments are projects with a multi decade time horizon . 
  one year of low oil and gas prices does n't make a big difference in the spreadsheet . 
  apparently , they sell them in french canadia as well . 
  as a fellow non-psychopath , i agree . 
  plot twist : the sign is stuffed full of high explosives . 
  and mobilisation potential, 
  i like that you made switzerland a literal asterisk . 
  also , ** trst je na\u0161 !, 
  you know that charlie was charged under the same law and won at trial . 
  there 's a good chance the same will happen here . 
  this will strengthen the domestic russian gas market !, 
  thank you , brussels !, 
  thank you , brussels !, 
  the whole concept of personal responsibility is a completely alien idea to you , is n't it ? 
  so , you 're the other one, 
  context matters . 
  the us has a history of militant imperialism and aggressive expansionism . 
  you ca n't really apply the same lens to germany . 
  if you know anything about germany for the past couple of generations , it 's the most hippy-dippy country in europe . 
  in europe !, 
  and europe will stop supplying russia with money . 
  there 's more than one way to heat a house . 
  not sure how the kremlin intends to keep the ruble above parity with toilet paper though . 
  [ careful , vlad ] ( http://www.panamericanworld.com/sites/default/files/styles/node-main-pic-700_320/public/store-empty-shelves_1.jpg?itok=jj1g79ml ), 
  rules should be followed . 
  there must be order !, 
  ca you imagine a ham kebab ? 
  they were retarded enough to blow a civilian plane out of the sky, 
  putin does n't have the best command and control in the area . 
  [ ... like a boy !, 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/jan/30/us-congressman-michael-grimm-threatens-journalist-video ), 
  belarus is n't getting in either . 
  maybe we 're moustache-phobic ? 
  or maybe we learned our lesson with orban and do n't want him to have any autocrat wannabe friends in the council chamber wielding a veto . 
   `` moody 's corrected a mistake as it underrated slovenia in times of crisis , '' lutz roehmeyer , a money manager at landesbank berlin investment gmbh , who helps oversee $ 1.1 billion of emerging markets debt , said by phone on monday . 
  `` with the other rating companies on much better rating levels , moody 's was the outlier and took much too long to realize that slovenia is an investment-grade country in the end . '', 
   tetris theme, 
  it 's called [ korobeiniki ] ( http://youtu.be/umedct4bogc ) and has lyrics . 
  goings of hell, 
   automated parking garage, 
   i confess that in 1901 , i said to my brother orville that man would not fly for fifty years . 
  ever since , i have distrusted myself and avoided all predictions . 
  * -- wilbur wright , in a speech to the aero club of france , 5 november 1908 . 
  maybe obama should move to kobane till this blows over . 
   the agriculture sector will also get an additional 50 billion roubles in a bid to boost local production to make up for shortages caused by moscow 's embargoes of western products, 
  yea that 's a sensible investment / s, 
  i lol-ed at the bodyguard as well . 
  in their defence , they admit their mistake . 
   when we asked hece what he thought of slovenia his answer was simply : `` i like '' . 
  in the end taking hece along as bodyguard was quite unnecessary as slovenia is a very friendly and hospitable country . 
  this place is a great asset for humanity . 
  among other things it has served as a repository for the syrian seed collection from aleppo ( some of the specimens trace back as far as the beginning of civilisation ) . 
  may as well use them for something good . 
  you do n't know that !, 
  the bridge could collapse 1/3 of the way through . 
  plus inflation, 
  what film is this ? 
  the deficitary kind work by borrowing money . 
  who 's willing to lend their money to greece ? 
  obama , perhaps ? 
  why di n't you say muslim space lizard ? 
  what are you hiding ? 
  for one thing , russia 's western air defence perimeter is in belarus . 
  this comes to mind, 
  this is n't serious . 
  for one thing she 's not the one who decided on trade matters , the commission does . 
  also , you 'd need unanimous ratification by member states . 
  i doubt the eastern members or the uk would be willing to do that . 
  the putin-trolls are strong itt . 
  i missed that . 
  is there a link ? 
  edit : [ found it ] ( http://4d.rtvslo.si/!arhiv/sp-v-smucanju-vail-2015/174318560 ), 
  i love the ending : today , we stop privatisation . 
  tomorrow , we implement worker management . 
  ( a model which has been tried and dismissed by reality - yesterday . ), 
  i 'm not a leftist or a rightist . 
  depending on the topic , a free market or a public institution may be the best way of doing things . 
  sometimes either may work and other times , a combination is needed . 
  what is just a completely bad idea is re-doing failed experiments from the past which have n't worked anywhere in the world . 
  this is n't to say that labour has no place in shaping a business , but a far better place to start would be something like food production collectives , which have been successful in italy for example or the type of management - union relationship that seems to work well in germany . 
  ( notice how neither of these involve politicians or a national interest ), 
  aside from the principle of fair return , what 's so bureaucratic about esa ? 
  [ given that russia is reforming its space sector , ] ( http://www.parabolicarc.com/2015/02/02/russian-space-industry-consolidation-creating-black-hole/ ) i 'd stay well away until the dust settles and it 's clear how the final product actually functions - or does n't . 
  it could be that the eu has become competent at covert foreign and security policy enforcement - or it could be russian media publishing complete bs for billionth time .
