  * you * were part of yugoslavia at one point !, 
  given how much botox he has in his face , it 's not much of an achievement . 
  it can be a bit cheesy at times , but for me , very touching overall and definitely worth watching . 
   unless putin can persuade them to repatriate their wealth, 
  would you put your money into a country where property rights are conditional on the mood of one man ? 
  i 'm sure there are people out there who would , but they 're going to demand a massive risk premium . 
   he needs them to do so or the country will collapse . 
  is n't it possible that it 'll just slowly weaken as opposed to collapse ? 
  daesh just blew up the northernmost bridge to stop the kurdish advance . 
  there are two more bridges in this general area . 
   one sat in a martian geo equivalent for meterology enviroment and of course communication . 
  one super eye in the sky ... cool, 
  edit : a bit fragile though . 
  you 're always one well paced space pebble away from loosing everything . 
   so a sat is not mission critical , but a great nice to have, 
  yes , just like they are for earth . 
  none of this is essential , but once you have a significant number of people living and working there , and you organise things based on the presumption of space based services , a loss like that would be a major disruption . 
  i ca n't make heads or tales of that . 
  mind unpacking some of that ? 
  war and annexation in europe can not be allowed to become a profitable proposition again . 
  seeing as i live here , it 's in my interest to have the kremlin suffer for its transgression in order to establish this mode of conduct as deleterious for the offender . 
  if moscow wants to pull this shit in asia , go right ahead . 
  but not in my house - not without paying for it . 
  yes , but can you get a german official to say that ? 
   kobarid is for me also one of the most beautiful places in the world, 
  i can never escape the contrast between the paradise this place is today and the hell it once was . 
  when i 'm there , i always feel a little bit envious of all the tourists who have no idea how much tragedy was once compressed into this small area . 
  it 's one of the very few places that make me appreciate all that time we spent studying poetry in school . 
  there 's no way i can read so\u010di and stay stoic . 
  am i the only one who thinks this is an example of lazy thinking ? 
  it seems to me that he just grafts a historical analysis of us policy onto the present-day situation even though it does n't really fit . 
  sending financial and materiel to your last ally in an important region does n't really make you an emerging hegemon , does it ? 
  also , would n't a neutral ukraine suit the supposed washington containment model just fine ? 
  most glaringly for me , is n't he attributing far more capacity for devious , considered agency to the american establishment than reality can justify ? 
  the prince of darkness and the penguin with a lot of unexplained cash ... this country is like a cheap comic book . 
  no , but china does . 
  buy yuropean !, 
  importantly , though , inflation is 0 , so it really has no impact on an average person . 
  great for the export and hospitality industries . 
  sure , but then the money would have ended up in switzerland , not france . 
  you have to think these things through . 
  nuking a country that has nuclear weapons may not be such a great idea ... 
  putin , is that you ? 
  here you go :, 
  i think somebody needs a cookie . 
  twice as bad this time . 
  perhaps a double of vladimir putin will climb out of that tunnel . 
  the lander is n't esa hardware . 
  it was built by an independent consortium and given a ride on the orbiter - esa did n't have the money . 
  given that the entire mission , especially the landing , was hit or miss , i doubt any agency would have invested in rtg . 
  this goes double for the consortium . 
  i did n't mean to suggest that you were discounting the achievement , merely that the sort of upgrade you describe would 've demanded funds which did n't exist and which , reasonably , should n't exist for a mission of such high risk . 
  this was less curiosity and more pathfinder if you follow my meaning . 
  like someone wrote over at / r/europe , they do this twice a year . 
  ca n't wait for esas juice to get there . 
  i just wish they would put a lander on that thing . 
  come on guys !, 
  that was sent to the russians and the americans ... because we clearly have dibs . 
  hmm . . good catch, 
  this is n't actually news . 
  the ep adopts sensible reports like this all the time and nobody pays attention except policy wonks in that particular area . 
  as far as i know , this is the first time the american right decided to have a cow over it . 
  wait till they find out we campaign against the death penalty worldwide . 
  that 'll be fun to watch . 
  that 's racist . 
  i do n't know about 1900 , but the eu has been a growing net exporter of food since 2010 . 
  i think a lot of this is just modern agriculture . 
  who needs colonies when you have science ? 
  what do you mean , china ? 
  the area pictured here is a net exporter . 
  what do you mean , * just * ? 
  was n't in 2010, 
  i think brian cox 's idea is a better parallel . 
  he compared humanity to a nascent nervous system . 
  also , diseases tend to be alien to the organism . 
  if you look at how greedy the animal brain is in relation to the rest of the body , you 'll see what i mean . 
  but at the end of the day , an animal without a brain is just pointless . 
  it was in the human universe series . 
  ca n't really tell you more than that , but it 's worth watching for its own sake if you 've got the time . 
  released back into the confusing world that is the eu . 
  not to me , to them . 
  that 's where this comes in : http://www.rewildingeurope.com/publications/brochure/, 
  it 's enough to vaporise every major russian/american city even assuming most of them get destroyed in the initial attack . 
  hence it 's an effective deterrent . 
   south stream had killed nabucco and turkish stream can easily do the same to tanap . 
  much like south stream , turkish stream will never be built . 
  i meant the cookbook . 
  the soviets had terrible missile guidance so they opted for the gunshot approach . 
  that has n't been a limiting factor for some time . 
  hejl, 
  given the amount of ethnic russians in the north of kazakhstan , i think he may actually mean it . 
  really regretting iceland not having any ep seats . 
   are just jumping at the chance, 
  [ this should never be a good metaphor for international politics , but ... ] ( https://youtu.be/yue_pi8nft4 ), 
  and about the [ hookers ] ( http://www.vice.com/read/a-visit-to-one-of-germanys-all-you-can-fuck-brothels-432 ), 
  i 'd say [ 2 of the three center right parties ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_political_parties_in_slovenia ) in this country are quite reasonable . 
  [ yes , ] ( http://eup.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/01/07/1465116513517013.abstract ),

  that 's another million barrels per day , people .
