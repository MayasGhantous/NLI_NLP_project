  it would be difficult to dispute that it 's a step in the right direction . 
  relative incomes matter because we 're talking about humans . 
  humans judge their wealth in relation to the wealth of other people . 
  it 's not the best method , but it 's the one which the human mind uses . 
  also , it occurs to me that there are aspects of society which are a zero sum game and in these situations relative income makes all the difference . 
  rich kids getting into the best schools which leads to them getting the best jobs for example .

  it 's not * that * he had the report made , it 's * how * . 
  he ordered it made without leaving a paper trail , without informing the other ministers involved in the sale or the pm about the report and he had the wrong intelligence agency do it - the one under his direct control . 
  either the guy was up to no good or he 's unbelievably incompetent .

  the iss is the first serious long term microgravity lab we 've had .

  gasoline and crude oil are two different things . 
  iran is essentially just farming out the refining of crude oil . 
  this means that crude prices will be impacted regardless of the 35 % figure . 
  whether gasoline prices follow depends on what the global refining capacity looks like .

  the agreement is that 90 % of your contribution gets spent in your member state . 
  this means you need to develop a useful space infrastructure before you can contribute in a bigger way .

  yes, 
  number of protons in a gram x 1 microjoule, 
  i got the energy of the bomb from wikipedia . 
  with a given mass , that of a proton , any value for kinetic energy corresponds to precisely one value of velocity . 
  since relativity squeezes velocity figures near the speed of light into an asymptotic fuckfest , the energy is often used as a linear stand-in for the velocity . 
  i simply meant the speed of the protons at 6,5 tev and not the speed being 6,5 tev . 
  big improvement on the previous situation , though . 
  what ends up happening is that every state develops a niche and funds programs which exploit that niche . 
  offcourse the basic science program is funded by everyone . 
  they were clever enough to put that in the treaty . 
  psst ... it 's a giant circle . 
  i was n't clever enough to use na . 
  i just inverted the mass of a proton . 
  i 'm just saying : it 's a lot of energy for a single proton . 
  yes , hence the * if * at the beginning of the sentence . 
  i 'm surprised that they did n't decide to move to a different site at the first sign of trouble given how big a project this is . 
  is this really such an amazing spot ? 
  check out esa on wikipedia . 
  it explains the difference between a member state , an associate member and a european cooperating state .

  but this is n't a solution for the first caffe on mars . 
  it was the most ambitious binding target at the time by a wide margin . 
  this is a really good way to catch up on the topic . 
  the individual events tend not to get much attention , but they add up to a significant trend over time .
