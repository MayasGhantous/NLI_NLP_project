  montenegro . 
  no big outstanding issues . 
  just a matter of ticking all the boxes . 
  there are , however , a lot of boxes . 
  i really do n't like the guy , but he 's far short of putin . 
  if he lost an election fair and square , i think he 'd step aside . 
  sadly , the opposition in turkey is a mess . 
  putin does n't care about free speech as long as it does n't threaten his position of power . 
  erdogan seems to hold a number of sincere opinions regarding how free speech should be limited . 
  i love the fact that you 're still impressed with [ `` lasers '' ] ( https://youtu.be/e-piidaqcyu ) . 
  they meant balkan . 
  would n't bruce be a contribution from ** the ** nasa ? 
  do n't forget you have a lander on the other side of the body recording the effects of the impact . 
  european countries . 
  do what you want to your asian neighbours . 
  wait ... lower demand leads to higher price ?? 
  you know i have to post this, 
  are you saying that this measure will bring an end to mass production of food ? 
  and how is that a bad thing ? 
  i bet you 're a white man . 
  my thought as well . 
  it 's already well recognised . 
  [ ted , ] ( https://youtu.be/vwsihbnawaw?t=35s ) is that you ? 
   putin would step aside if he lost an elecion ,, 
  sure he would / s, 
  this is complete bs . 
  this is obviously a piece of hypocritical nonsense . 
  but it 's the kind of hypocritical nonsense that made christianity and judaism less of a problem than they once were . 
  well done , sir . 
  every proton is stuffed with a kinetic energy of 6,5 tev . 
  if you accelerated ** 1g of material ** to that speed , it ** would have 3 times the energy of the tsar bomba ** detonation . 
  people looking at what they say is the word of god and choosing to ignore the parts of it which they do n't like or are simply inconvenient . 
  does anyone else get a mars-ish feeling during the second half of the is video ? 
  they 'll probably just make a few tweaks to [ unclos part xi ] ( http://eu-midas.net/legal_framework ) and use that . 
  they could just stuff the corpse into a supply ship and launch it into the atmosphere to the sound of bagpipes . 
   just because many people edit out what they do n't like , certainly does n't make it right . 
  the fact that it reduces harm makes it helpful/productive . 
   i still do n't understand how christianity and judaism are ` less of a problem ' though . 
  at what point has people pursuing truth been a problem ? 
  they were a problem when powerful members of both religions were convinced that their respective scriptures were revealed truth and acted in accordance with that belief . 
   although you are right in that aspect , people should n't edit out parts of the bible / etc. 
  because it inconveniences them . 
  coming from the perspective that these texts were written by people in a context of comparative ignorance and cruelty and with little regard for accuracy , i would say that editing them based on lived , actual needs in the real world is a perfectly sensible idea . 
  it begins ... 
  [ it ] ( http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/it?s=t ), 
  i do n't think there will be any real changes where only the uk benefits at the expense of the rest ( perhaps something cosmetic ) . 
  there 's likely to be a number of policy commitments which london has been pushing for but ca n't really be described simply as a concession to the uk - we 're talking about moves which , depending on your political persuasion , will either help or hurt all of the states to varying degrees . 
  an audit of existing regulations , moves toward a single services market , the digital agenda , trade agreements with third nations , probably something australian for the mediterranean problem . 
  where 's your god now ? 
  more war with oil !, 
  i 'd say the bigger pain is closer to earth . 
  this place is in the middle of nowhere . 
  the region it 's in has a population of about 850 thousand and dropping fast , its main connections to the russian core are two rail lines which stretch for thousands of kilometers and are n't easy to repair since they 're the only way in and out of the area . 
  did i mention that they were built on permafrost ? 
  anyone want to predict what happens to them over the next 30 years ? 
  these are the rules . 
  if you do n't like them , seek alternative employment . 
  also , presumably this only applies to those households which have shown they have an inability to pay as defined by some law . 
  no need to extend this principle to well off households or nonresidential users . 
  if some private operators of water systems ca n't or wo n't work within these rules , they can be replaced by other private operators or by a municipal corporation . 
  it 's not as if they can take the pipes to china and continue their work there . 
  that usually happens the moment you hand over a water system to a private operator . 
  hardly any private company operates on a time horizon in excess of 20 years . 
  a cut in the profit margin of a monopoly provider is more likely . 
  they 're proposing this for the very end of the mission . 
  rtfa, 
  do n't forget that aside from the penetrative instruments , rosetta has everything the lander has - but better . 
  it could give a lot of extra data from the surface . 
  tel abyad is the main crossing that links raqqa to turkey and the road leading up to it is surrounded by a lot of farmland and settlements . 
  i doubt that the ypg have the means or the inclination to take it . 
  it would certainly be nice if they could secure the m4 highway and link the two eastern cantons , but isis would have to effect a strategic withdraw from the area for that to be realistic . 
  i do n't know this for a fact , but the cgi in the esa videos from when rosetta woke up certainly had the dish moving to call home and not the craft . 
  and the real [ kalisi ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/article10285792.ece/alternates/w620/merkel-cameron-getty.jpg ), 
  no iron throne , but there seems to be a [ magic bell of power .

  who knew that tibetans were a long lost tribe of israel ? 
  also who 's on first ?

  making changes can be risky . 
  risk is bad for business . 
  you need an incentive which punishes non-risk-takers in order for this sort of thing to be a rational business decision . 
  a document which has yet to be written . 
   that 's why drafts are leaked, 
  i 'm sure they 're leaked by unbiased people with no agenda other than informing the public . 
  making a coherent argument could also be an option . 
  off course , then you 'd have to defend your position against criticism , and that 's just * being part of the system , man !, 
  seems to work for the `` protesters '' . 
  worst case scenario ; they 'll realise their oversight during the first test launch . 
  on a serious note : ariane has fuel lines on the outside as is visible on one of the posters for the system available on twitter . 
  am i right in thinking that this would essentially be a ground version of the iss - mainly built to facilitate a close to home place for learning how to build a base on a non earth object and live and work there ? 
  you take the opportunity to do all sorts of other stuff , but basically it 's a dry run for bases built and operated further afield . 
  we have [ more than one .

   the commission is n't elected, 
  it 's precisely as `` elected '' as any cabinet in a parliamentary system .
