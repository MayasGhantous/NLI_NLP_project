  esa says he 's got 24 watts to work with and that this is enough to do some a considerable amount of science . 
  the bare minimum is 5,5 watts . 
  obligatory isspresso reference . 
  philae is n't that small . 
  i saw a life size model of it and it 's quite substantial . 
  the box part is the size of a large washing machine , but with the landing gear and the rotation mast in the middle , it adds up to a fairly imposing thing . 
  the happy part is that the shade will protect philae during perihelion . 
  the clumsy landing extended his life expectancy far beyond the originally planned month or two . 
  what 's more , they 'll have a ground level view during the most active part of the mission and they 're in a place with far more exciting geology than the intended landing site . 
  you 're not alone . 
  the rosetta hoodie guy had much the same opinion a while ago . 
  i bet he feels really stupid right about now / s, 
  my understanding was that they were currently getting 24 from the pv panels . 
  i do n't know what the maximum is . 
  bare in mind that philae was built 20 years ago . 
  they got 300 data packets with 8000 more on the way . 
  stop saying ** the ** esa, 
  i see . 
  just like the nasa . 
  i agree . 
  better than the n.a.s.a. 
  esa put together this concept for 3d printing a moon base :, 
  please note that the court decision does not mean websites are liable for user comments all over europe . 
  it simply rejected the notion that the estonian law which says this is not in violation of the echr . 
  tldr - the court just said it 's up to the states to decide about this issue, 
  well , we 're stuck with jean claude juncker for the time being .

  we could use it to build a sort of internal social sytem for the nation .

  the only way you could have reentry is if it were the apollo kind . 
  small population , plenty of geothermal friendly geology .

  it accounts for roughly half of the renewables on the map . 
  its first 3 stages are solid , not liquid . 
  yeah , the enlightenment ... sorry about that - totally our bad . 
  these numbers relate to yearly net production , not some artificial potential thing . 
  the second graph refers to ** generating capacity ** and it summs to ** 42 % renewables ** . 
  the first graph refers to ** actually realised generation ** and it summs to ** 32,9 % renewables ** . 
  i wonder if this applies to [ the us$ as well .

  this is standard procedure for big airline plane buys as well as most commercial rocket buys . 
  nobody ever wants to publish what sort of discount they can afford to give . 
   even better , would be to remove the fundamentalist guys and put some sufi liberals in there instead . 
  that 's what morocco 's been doing . 
  so is tobacco . 
  the question is what 's the best way to get rid of it . 
  banning either one would likely cause more harm than good . 
  if default becomes official , ela ends and the greek government has to save its own banking sector . 
  the only way they can do that is by printing their own money . 
  bolden does n't make the budget , congress does - and the line items specify what part of the nasa program gets the money . 
  nope . 
   there can be no paid prioritisation of traffic in the internet access service . 
  at the same time , equal treatment allows reasonable day-to-day traffic management according to justified technical requirements , and which must be independent of the origin or destination of the traffic . 
  it allows telecoms to prioritise based on technical attributes . 
  ip tv and voip compared to http and ftp . 
  banning this would be absurd since it would be a de-facto hindrance to more sensitive services over more robust ones . 
  edit : nobody wants glitchy tv on account of inperceptively faster browsing . 
  good think it 's not true . 
  i know you 're probably busy or have a life or something , but on the off chance that you 're like me , could you please explain this to people in the other subs who are already sharpening their pitchforks ? 
  the only way this deviates from nn is that it allows for prioritisation of service types based on technical needs ( streaming over text for example ) but banns differences based on source/destination -  no special deals for a specific company . 
  the other thing is that it allows for innovative services as a premium ( for example telemedicine ) , but mandates national regulators to prevent this exemption from being abused to enable underinvestment in infrastructure or similar fuckery . 
  it may not satisfy nn puritans , but as far as the average subscriber is concerned , this is just fine assuming your national regulator is halfway decent . 
  if that 's the definition of nn , nn is stupid . 
  i want my voip and iptv to work smoothly even if that means my browser is ( inperceptively to the human ) slower .

  high level ? 
  not much in my country works the way it should , but the telecoms regulator is one of the thing that do . 
  that 's why nobody knows it exists . 
  at a broader level : in democracies , people should make sure their regulators work well - or not , it 's up to them .
