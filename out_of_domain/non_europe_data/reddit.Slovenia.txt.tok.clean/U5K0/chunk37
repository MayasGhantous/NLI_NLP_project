  this means that providers infringing the net neutrality rules will face significant pecuniary and administrative sanctions . 
  tldr : it 's ** up to national regulators to prevent abuse ** of the specialised and innovative services exemption . 
   it was originaly planned to abolishe the roaming charges at the end of the year, 
  that was the parliament proposal . 
  this is the compromise between the parliament and the council . 
  the council ( aka the state governments ) always fucks things up . 
  ideally , sure . 
  the thing is that in order to effectively accommodate every peak and always still have enough bandwidth for the sensitive services , you 'd have to have an insane amount of capacity just sitting in the ground doing nothing for 99 % of the time . 
  given that money is limited this is n't a real life option .

  the peaks in broadband can be far worse because of the presence of ddos , torrents etc. 
  but you can see the problem . 
  the peaks rise far above the typical bandwidth you need to operate a network . 
  the sensible thing to do there is to flatten the peaks by pushing less sensitive traffic one pixel to the right . 
  i just eliminated some of the variables from the chart making tool at http://transparency.gie.eu/index.php/graphs?code=99_99_99,

  then the law will almost certainly get scrapped - at least the nasty parts of it .

   we 've not used up the storage space down here, 
  to keep this thing on earth , you 'd need to keep it in a clean room . 
  that 's expensive . 
  perhaps it will also demonstrate the fundamentally antidemocratic nature of the uk and cause that crucial bit more to vote for scottish independence next time round .

  by the time this gets halfway done it 'll have cost twice that . 
  once it 's done it 'll need a bunch of safety upgrades etc.

   was hoping they would have started building it by now . 
  the money is n't really there to exploit iss and build ils at the same time . 
  btw , we 're * totally * calling it the ils !, 
  nasa has n't launched any people in years , but they seem to be running their iss operations just fine . 
  esa is successfully exploiting columbus and jaxa is doing the same with kibo sans a crew launch capability . 
   after hermes i just can not imagen esa even trying to do manned missions themselves any day soon .

  esa flies russian soyuz rockets from kouru . 
  why not stick an american ship on top of an ariane and fly that as well ? 
  you 'd have to buy a new spacecraft every time you launch . 
  besides , the soyuz spacecraft is hardly multipurpose . 
  dc , on the other hand , has been found to be quite versatile .

  the russian regulars get disowned before they enter ukraine . 
  soldiers and officers formally resign in a written statement before being dent across the border . 
  the bad news is that this essentially means the families of the kia russians get no financial support from the government and have no way of demanding it legally .

  the great thing about organised societies is that they have an agricultural surplus which supports reserves for periodic deficitory events . 
  they also facilitate trade , which makes it easier to survive that sort of fallout even in the abscence of sufficient reserves .
