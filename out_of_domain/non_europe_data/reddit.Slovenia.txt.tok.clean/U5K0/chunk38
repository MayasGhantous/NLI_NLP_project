  i was just wondering if there 's some insanely expensive aspect to it like a platinum plated filtration mesh or something . 
  it comes down to price . 
  can this be produced at a lower cost ( at some time and with the appropriate economy of scale ) than petroleum derivatives including the various sin taxes ?

  i 'm curious , do places outside europe and japan have e-waste policies as well ? 
  how are they working out ? 
  the point of a public exchange of views , a transparent weighing of arguments regarding a highly consequential policy decision ? 
  are you seriously asking that ? 
  tsipras had it coming . 
  other than the somewhat sentimental objection against him * telling the pm how to run his country , * would you say verhofstadt was wrong on the substance ? 
  were his arguments weak ? 
  i may have been clumsy in implying this , so let me say it clearly . 
  i think it could add to the substance of the conversation .

  the valey there is like something out of avatar . 
  ljubljana is also good for a daytrip . 
  i also like kamnik , kamni\u0161ka bistrica and velika planina about 30 min outside the capital . 
  you may want to google those last 3 though . 
  i think they 're great especially this time of year , but tastes vary . 
  i 've been there many times on nice days , only once on a miserable , cloudy day in the autumn . 
  i loved it the last time . 
  it 's like me and my friends owned the place . 
  a really special experience . 
  come in the late autumn or in winter before the snow falls . 
  you 'll have the entire place to yourself . 
  it 's amazing . 
  edit : i should mention that it looks miserable during that period , but i like that it 's empty .
