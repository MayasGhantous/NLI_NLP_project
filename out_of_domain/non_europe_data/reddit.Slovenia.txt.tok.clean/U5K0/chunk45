  how dare you accuse me of such an egregious profanity ? 
  i demand satisfaction !, 
  cannons at dawn ? 
  in the parliament ? 
  every last mep is directly elected . 
  check your facts . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/jo_-kobibg0?t=4s ), 
  to sit as mp , not to run the country . 
  come on , fair play . 
  the uk has a population of nearly 65 million people . 
  how many of them voted for the current pm ? 
  you 're throwing stones from a glass house . 
  if that 's ok , then why is it a problem when the european parliament elects the commission president and accepts or rejects each of the commissioners ? 
  why the inconsistency ? 
  a plurality in some random constituency is hardly a democratic mandate for supreme executive office . 
  while i agree that meps should get the power of initiative at the earliest opportunity , things now are n't as black and white as you make them out to be . 
  one of the main avenues for legislative initiative at the moment begins with an act of parliament , be it the adoption of a report or a simple resolution , which is then acted upon by the commission . 
  in this regard i have good reason for optimism , since past transfers of powers have been consistent in their direction : away from the council and the commission , to the parliament . 
  incidentally , the people fighting this the most have always been council members , not commission representatives . 
  that , combined with the fact that the pm has control of the nuclear arsenal , seems to suggest otherwise . 
  yes . 
  however , it will be up for grabs along with the rest of the acquis communautaire during the legislative review following brexit . 
  if the tories are in charge at that time , good luck . 
  laws have to pass parliament as well , obviously . 
  in the process , they can be amended . 
  hence the need to mediate with the council . 
  i do n't know this for a fact , but i 'm 99 % sure that this is the council 's fault . 
  the uk was at the council table in ' 85 , when this was decided . 
  this has been in the pipeline for years . 
  i 'm not an expert on anything . 
  i just use the google . 
  [ i know ] ( https://youtu.be/r5grl_mw9nk ), 
  [ from this ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-germany-france-iduskcn0zc0bq ) , you 're likely to see a lot more border guards and ships with eu flags . 
  tanks are an optional maybe ... so probably not anytime soon . 
  it 's not up to the eu to trigger art . 
  you ca n't really sneak stuff through the eu . 
  that 's the up side of the system . 
  the down side is that it takes a lot of time and effort to do good things as well . 
  there is literally no legal way to do that . 
   any member state may decide to withdraw from the union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements, 
  as i understand it , for the uk , that means an act of your sovereign parliament . 
  that 's the only way this happens . 
  i think you put this comment in the wrong place . 
  this was just agreed today, 
  this is n't the us congress . 
  i 'm bored of explaining this to people . 
  look into it yourself . 
  i like this one better, 
  [ like apple ? 
  ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/30/technology/apple-tax-eu-us-ireland/index.html ) we 're on it !, 
  the eu does n't have hate speech laws . 
  some individual states do . 
  canada is basically a european country that ended up in a weird place , is n't it ? 
  sure , but once you go past new england , shit starts to get scary . 
  hug of death . 
  i think it 's built into the browser . 
  yea . 
  the council even has a [ fancy double majority voting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voting_in_the_council_of_the_european_union#qualified_majority_voting ) system and everything . 
  the uk has n't done any of the paper work yet ... officially , brexit does n't exist . 
  hug of death , sorry, 
  so if you stop breaking the law you ca n't be punished for doing it in the first place ? 
  or even made to undo what you did illegally ? 
  here 's a good explanation ... and relatively short . 
  well , they need to both agree to pass something . 
  and as much as i hate the council for what it does , it 's members are duly elected heads of government . 
  depends on the uk 's government at that time . 
  i think we hugged it to death, 
  wow . 
  i had no idea . 
  still , has the council ever used this wholly inappropriate power ? 
  for the record , i was n't being sarcastic . 
  yes , they can do either . 
  the point of this story is that we got them to do the former and not the latter . 
  and the vampire thing is just silly . 
  you mean the mines ? 
  ask that question in russia and you 'll soon have an accident . 
  this is actually less of a problem at the really low altitudes where traces of the atmosphere still cause enough drag to clear the debris through de-orbiting . 
  on a different note , i refuse to believe that we ca n't figure out a way to [ clean up our own mess . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/rclav_3_eoa?t=1m7s ), 
  more info here :, 
  yes , but as the article points out , it 's also about what that money is directed to do . 
  right now , a big focus for esa is the construction of space based infrastructure . 
  once copernicus and galileo are built , maintenance and operations wo n't demand as much funding . 
  the question then becomes , will these monies be withdrawn from esa or redirected to other areas . 
  if so , which ? 
   - slovenia : looks like the best option among all the balkan states, 
  we do n't like it when people describe us with the b word . 
  say it with me . 
  * central europe . 
  \u017di\u017eek provides an explanation . 
  i can see you 're not in on the joke - my bad . 
  the thing is that in slovenia , * balkan * has become a synonym for corruption , criminality , a disregard for societal values and norms - just general bad behaviour . 
  littering = balkan ; recycling = european, 
  most people recognise that this gets a bit funny since it 's a mainly geographical term which is usually taken to include this country as well , but that does n't remove the above meaning from our heads . 
  [ we 're dreamers . 
  ] ( http://brett-jackson.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/dream-bigger-reach-higher.jpg ), 
  it talks about a regional struggle for influence . 
  terms like winning and loosing are perfectly legitimate . 
  the middle east is no place for post-modern discourse . 
  where do these numbers come from .
