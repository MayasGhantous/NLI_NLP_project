  this is only complicated if you really badly want it to be . 
  otherwise it 's pretty straight forward . 
   serious faith requires critical thought . 
  do n't know what you mean by that . 
  do n't care either . 
  we 're talking about religion , which does n't . 
   there 's nothing to even argue against there . 
  it 's just false . 
  oh , really ? 
  you would say that religion generally dumps illogical , irrational , unreal claims ? 
  talk about simply untrue . 
   but , it 's irrelevant for a number of reasons , including that most religions have a hierarchy that does n't rely purely on populism . 
  which brings me back to my original point ; religion makes large numbers of people vulnerable to manipulation due to uncritical acceptance of claims made by other people - the ones in the hierarchy . 
  devotion grants power without scrutiny and is , as such , a recipe for widespread structural abuse . 
   that 's not an objective basis , because it still relies on the unproved assumption that human society is good and worth preserving . 
  it relies on the objective fact that society makes human life better in every way that can be measured . 
  if you 're interested in arguing that about weather health is better than disease , wealth better than poverty , peace better than war , etc , then we have no common basis on which to build a discussion . 
   i was arguing for the ethical codes , not the morality being appealed to . 
  we agree on that point . 
  religion is extremely proficient at enforcing an ethical code , weather it 's moral or immoral . 
  and that 's precisely the problem . 
   again this is entirely subjective . 
  my initial point was that whatever function is contributed by religion can be replaced in its absence . 
  to the extent that * suffering being bad * can be described as subjective , its subjectivity makes it no less functional . 
   true , but neither does any other system of beliefs . 
  science is built on it and critical thinking is its definition . 
  both are ways of thinking . 
  if what you say is true , then to what you call systems of belief are all bad for that same reason . 
   and your criticism applies to literally every hierarchical system . 
  every , single one . 
  no , it does n't . 
  it applies only to those hierarchical systems where faith and devotion are glorified , where doubt is demonised and where questioning is ignored . 
  more importantly , it only applies to those systems where power is exercised in the absence of scrutiny and responsibility . 
  i just thought you might enjoy a musical summation to my argument . 
  as does the eu ... the army comment was meant to illustrate that the us has at least one additional instrument at its disposal - but still faces similar frustrations on its own doorstep, 
  there 's always tomorrow - you still have * some * natives left .

  what vacuum ? 
  presumably these are international corporations and would continue to fill demand even after relocating across the border, 
  slovenia has an information office responsible for enforcing privacy rights , freedom of information etc. , which is currently occupied by a very determinned lady . 
  one of the few state institutions which has n't fallen into disrepute in the past few years . 
  does this take eu cohesion funds into account ? 
  blue - opened, 
  orange - under construction, 
   are we that hungry for attention that we post any article mentioning slovenia once ? 
  well , i am . 
  i saw the german equivalent on here and thought i 'd submit the one from where i am and see what happens . 
  war is peace !, 
  the slovene language is spoken by about 2,5 million people globally . 
  identical colours in different patterns indicate different dialects which are similar ( not mixed populations of neighbouring dialects ) . 
  dialect groups are separated by grey lines and are visible in the key * ( nare\u010dje = dialect ) *, 
  edit : 216 and 217 , that 's where i am . 
  points for anyone who can find the name of the town , 
  poland is flat . 
  slovenia is not . 
  [ this all maps quite well to valleys , large rivers and other geographical obstacles .

  oh inflation , thou art a heartless bitch . 
  i wonder when bj took his latest test . 
   so there 's actually people around comfortable calling themselves catholic , yet not believing in a god ? 
  is the ** pope ** catholic ? 
  just a joke ... still if you can throw out hating gays , abortion , condoms , then why not god as well ... it 's such just another silly idea after all, 
  it says something about a country when they build a nuclear bomb before they build a ski lift . 
  not sure what that is , but it 's definitely something . 
  do you do requests ? 
  how about kj per capita, 
  or kj per square km, 
  this is one of my favourites : http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:costantino_nord-limes_png.png, 
  not sure why population size is the main criterion here ... 
  i 'd be more interested in a map with travel time to the nearest high capacity hospital - say a qualified transplant center or something like that . 
  to be fair , it 's easier to dominate a continent when genocide and slavery are n't banned . 
  also , once they took out carthage , they really did n't have any real competition for centuries . 
  personally , i prefer greece to rome . 
  it does n't look as good on a map , but the impact it 's had on humanity far outweighs rome . 
  euclid more or less wrote the textbooks the world uses today to teach geometry , about 60 % of any intro to philosophy class is just pure greece , architecture , astronomy ... also , the knock-on effects in the form of pan-hellenism were stupendous - alexandria and rome but to name the most famous successors of the greek tradition . 
  ps : the renaissance needed something to re-vitalize . 
  this is the only one i know of that would fit that description : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tabula_peutingeriana, 
  my understanding is that it 's mainly a road map ... sort of like the subway diagrams,

  not really a reason for painting a whole country black , is it ?

  2 seats in a 750 + seat assembly and they 've made a huge difference ... probubly acta would n't have died without those 2 meps,

  i should really start using the / sarcasm thing , should n't i ? 
  yup :, 
  but , to be fair , the us also has its version :, 
  a fairer comparison would be [ eea ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_economic_area ) vs [ nafta ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_american_free_trade_agreement ), 
  which would be a better replacement :,

  perhaps ( i do n't know ) , but it makes for a very convenient/scary missile site if you 're russia/anyone else, 
  not really about poland , but i just wanted to drop a picture of how the slovenian italian border has changed in gorizia/nova gorica,
