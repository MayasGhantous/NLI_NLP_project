  this is the exercise : http://codingbat.com/prob/p132134, 
  so what i wrote :, 
  public boolean in3050 ( int a , int b ) {, 
  return true ;, 
  if ( afourfive & & bfourfive ), 
  return true ;, 
  return false ;, 
  and the official answer :, 
  public boolean in3050 ( int a , int b ) {, 
  if ( a  = 30 & & a < = 40 & & b  = 30 & & b < = 40 ) {, 
  return true ;, 
  if ( a  = 40 & & a < = 50 & & b  = 40 & & b < = 50 ) {, 
  return true ;, 
  return false ;, 
  / / this could be written as one very large expression ,, 
  / / connecting the two main parts with | |, 
  in my example , i clean up the if statements . 
  but a downside might be big programs . 
  if a programmer is looking at your code and he sees the `` athreefour & & bthreefour '' he needs to check what those boolean variables are . 
  am i correct ? 
  any other disadvantages with my solution ? 
  thanks, 
  i am trying to develop a relatively simple app that will provide users information about bus arrivals for a chosen bus stop . 
  i am doing this for a school project and i am quite overwhelmed even though this should n't be that hard . 
  the thing is we only covered windows development shortly in two weeks and i have n't learned much in that time . . 
  to start things off , here is the base design i quickly put together in paint : http://i.imgur.com/j2y61h7.jpg, 
  ** main window ** : this part should n't be that hard . 
  i only need a picture on top and two buttons , that redirect user to other two windows . 
  i was wondering what layouts should i use , that the controls will adapt to other device sizes ? 
  ** search window ** : this is where most of the action will happen . 
  i 've already set up classes to pull data from an online api , that i can use . 
  i was wondering what control should i use for the search field ? 
  what about the control for results ? 
  a result consists of a bus number , bus stop it 's heading to and minutes until next three arrivals . 
  ** favorites window ** : users can add stations to favorites and by clicking on them it will show the arrivals for the stop . 
  i do n't know how to execute that last part . 
  should i redirect users to search window and output the arrivals for their favorite stations there or do i do it in the favorites window ? 
  if i do it in the favorites windows it might be a bit of a hassle since there are other favorites and i ca n't just output results over them ? 
  ** general questions : **, 
  * i need to incorporate some kind of a live tile/push notification or something like that . 
  i was thinking i could update/push next three arrivals for one of the favorite stations on a live tile , would that be a good idea ? 
  * the application needs to store its data locally too . 
  so when the user restarts the app the saved data is still there . 
  would it be easier if i create a database or just store it in a file locally ? 
  the goal here is to do this on the most simplest way possible , i do n't want to complicate things . 
  any tutorials/videos/other resources related to what i stated above is more than welcome . 
  also if there are any good examples or similar apps on github or somewhere i 'd appreciate it too . 
  sorry for the wall of text , but i only have a week for this and i 'm quite a bit overwhelmed , so any input is highly appreciated . 
  thank you all and merry christmas !, 
  * i 'm off to bed , if there are any followup questions i 'll answer in the morning , thanks *, 
  i just wanted to say . . 
  i have n't read a book in years . 
  when i picked up hpmor i just binge-read all of it . 
  i got my passion for reading back again . 
  i also picked up an interest into rational thinking . 
  has anyone read rationality : from ai to zombies ? 
  if yes , how long did it take you ? 
  i 'm really into old school rap . 
  big , pac , eazy , snoop , nwa and all that . 
  but when it comes into new stuff i just do n't feel 90 % of it . 
  of the new-ish stuff i guess action bronson is fine , especially blue chips 2 , but when it comes to kanye , drake and shit , i do n't get the hype . 
  i especially dislike the whiny rap style if you know what i mean . 
  any suggestions ? 
  edit : there are some songs i like from kanye like hey mama , stronger , . . but the newest ones i just do n't feel,

  to avoid having to check if the next value is null , we add a sentinel to a skip list . 
  what would be a good value for a sentinel node ? 
  here 's two options i considered :, 
  a value bigger then the biggest element in the skip list ( let 's say we have a skip list with elements [ 1,2,3 ] the sentinel would be 4, 
  integer.max _ value ( if we have a skip list of integers , there is no such value that is bigger than max_value ), 
  i 've thought about the first option and i assume it is n't that good , since if we 're adding a value that is bigger then the current sentinel , then we have to fix the sentinel values on all levels . 
  well i think the second option would be good , but i 'm a bit confused . 
  let 's say we add a value that is the same as sentinel . 
  in practice , there is a case where that could happen . 
  to avoid this we could set a sentinel 's value to max_value +1 . 
  how do i store that value in an integer if i 'm using java for example ? 
  we have a skip list of integers and the sentinel is integer.max _ value +1 . 
  how do i store that ? 
  if we do n't talk language specific , a good sentinel would be infinity , right ? 
  i 've uploaded a timelapse with the following song : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwyfbklqswg ( gramatik - tearin ' it up ), 
  i have huge respect for gramatik , because he keeps all of his music free and he said more then once , that we can use his music on youtube freely . 
  some confirmations :, 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/1z0ekx/hi_im_gramatik_i_release_all_of_my_music_for_free/cfpitxl ( reddit ama where he answered about freely using his music on youtube ), 
  my video got caught with the id claim ( by youtube bot i guess ? ), 
  i appealed it right away with the youtube integrated dispute form . 
  i 've selected the `` you have permission from author '' ( or something similar ) and i 've also added the link to the facebook post . 
  the dispute was rejected today ( after 2 days ) and the claim still stands - http://i.imgur.com/50vn6dy.png, 
  i do n't know what can i do at this point ? 
  if i appeal the rejected dispute i can get a channel strike . 
  do i contact lowtemp ( gramatik 's production company ) ? 
  any other ideas ?

  motherboard manufacturer is lenovo - intel q45/q43 . 
  i 've looked through bios , but have n't found an option that looks relevant , so i 'd rather ask here . 
  if you need any more information , let me know . 
  i 'm looking to upgrade my msi gp60 laptop . 
  i currently have a 500gb hdd , but the laptop has a free msata ssd slot . 
  here 's my plan , and you are welcome to criticize it/suggest better options :, 
  i have a 500gb hdd now but i 'm looking into 250gb ssds . 
  i have some money saved up , but i do n't know if i want to spend more than 100 $ ( so 500gb ssd is out i guess . . ) .
