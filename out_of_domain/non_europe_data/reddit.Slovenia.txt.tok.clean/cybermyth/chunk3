  i posted this in / r/gameofthrones a week ago .

  i do n't even do them every workout , but when i started i could only do 3 . 
  now it 's less than 3 months later and i can do 16 when i 'm rested . 
  just workout regularly and your strength will improve and so will your pullups . 
  i am new to go . 
  is gold nova good ? 
  i am in it, 
  it was always on tv when i was a kid and still is, 
  i 'm just listening to this shizzz t, 
  sorry did n't notice it, 
  what about europe ? 
  we 're fucked, 
  marry me ? 
  what do you use ? 
  a trimmer ? 
  i just keep mine for a month or two then when it 's getting out of control i shave it off and look like a little bitch and repeat the first step, 
  i 'm using the regular adblock , do you think adblock plus is better ? 
  hey i have this somewhere !, 
  probably in the basement too . 
  it 's legal in n. korea, 
  well no progress here in europe at the moment . 
  well looking at your other achievments i am not anywhere near them , but tomorrow will be exactly 6 months since i started going to the gym regularly . 
  i am feeling awesome and looking back i just realised i already progressed a lot imo . 
  hmm i 'm just looking this stuff up on google . 
  you have more info about it ? 
  thanks for the response , i 'll jump right back in . 
  nothing about thenewboston guides in the wiki , but thank you for a very thoughtful response !, 
  you really helped me out . 
  thank you . 
  i 'm sorry if i was an asshole , but the wiki is really stripped as you said . 
  i 've been going through thenewboston guides and from video to video there seem to be more and more outdated info . 
  i thought i could work with it , but for a beginner like me it 's just too confusing . 
  i checked the derekbananas guide before and it looks great , i think since i 'm not that deep into thenewboston series i 'll just jump into his . 
  thanks again for the link . 
  wow that would be amazing . 
  ca n't wait until the announcement . 
  i mean , i ca n't wait until the winner will be announced , 
  no , the error says nqegp , but i 'll try this out i hope it 's the same thing . 
  nvm i managed to fix it . 
  it was probably a lodaer issue , i do n't know how exactly i fixed it but i had to type this : `` bootsect.exe / nt60 c : '' into command prompt . 
  panicked a bit but it 's all good now . 
  thanks for the help !, 
  uhh what is so special about this guy ?? 
  east = joke, 
  i 've only had it for about 4 months .

  should i watch this show ? 
  my cat hates me :(, 
  i need to study,

  i always find it fascinating when people decide on a journey like that . 
  i 'll maybe do it oneday . 
  explain pls i do n't get it :(, 
  7th here , hi !, 
  it 's the media ... 
  headlines like this one make the stories . 
  damn i 'm pretty proud about [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/s4hshgf.jpg ) one haha .

  the road was so damn narrow , there 's no way a car would fit .
