  i 'm from slovenia, 
  ofc he has . 
  he invested a looooot of money in marketing . 
  and i guess it 's paying off . 
  do you live in a state where medical marijuana is legal ? 
  you could give it a go if you have n't already, 
  me too man . 
  my mothers uncle has an uncle named richard . 
  i kinda feel bad for him . 
  poor guy . 
  the `` gg easy '' kind of players . 
  yeah i know , it 's not that hard to style when the hair is short but when it gets longer i 'm lost . 
  what hairstyles do you suggest for my hairtype/head ? 
  yeah was thinking about it , maybe i 'll get one for christmas and i 'll experiment until then , usually i just let it grow during holidays cause i 'm too lazy , but now that college is near i 'll probably shave it once or twice a week . 
  i 'm deciding between these two :, 
  i think both are great for the price , do n't know what to pick though . 
  yeah i 'm pretty much decided about the msi . 
  it looks amazing too . 
  thanks . 
  sometimes it wo n't connect back at all . 
  it took to long to connect ... 
  but usually it just connects and stays limited until i restart the computer . 
  same problem with my roommate and his laptop btw . 
  ok some of this makes sense , but tbh i still do n't get it . 
  why do you divide it with 2 here : ( n +1 ) / 2  = 5/2  = 1, 
  and how do you get ( n +1 ) / 2 * n !, 
  sorry but this is all really new to me . 
  ok that all makes sense , thanks , but how could i solve it using the polar form and de moivre 's formula ? 
  my schoolmate has almost the same [ problem ] ( http://prntscr.com/4xq7xr ) , but the + and - are flipped . 
  no matter how long i stare into the solved problem , i do n't know how he got the end result . 
  any idea ? 
  oh god , i think i know what i was doing wrong . 
  instead of dividing the angle ( 101.1 ) by 3 , i was calculating cos ( 101.1 / 3 ) . 
  i feel like an idiot , thanks for the help , really appreciate it . 
  ok this is my program atm . 
  it is working , but i highly doubt it , i did it the way it was meant to be done . 
  from random import *, 
  x = randint ( 2,10 ), 
  y = randint ( 2,10 ), 
  result = x * y, 
  print ( `` how much is '' , x , `` times '' , y , '' ? '' ), 
  answer = int ( input ( '' '' ) ), 
  if answer = = result :, 
  else :, 
   it seems to work fine , but i really wanted this line : print ( `` what is '' , str ( a ) , ` times ' , str ( b ) + '' ? '' ), 
  to also get the input and assign it to a variable ( c ) . 
  i could n't work out how to do that , though . 
  ( i 'm doing python 3 btw . 
  same here . 
  great  . 
  this part was the first part of the exercise . 
  now i needed to add the following things :, 
  * the program has to repeat the questions for 20 seconds, 
  * user gets a point for a correct answer, 
  * at the end the program has to print the number of points, 
  and ** extra homework ** :, 
  * let the guessing end when user makes his first mistake, 
  * the answer after the 20 seconds time does n't count, 
  this is my program atm :, 
  from random import *, 
  from time import *, 
  now = time ( ), 
  points = 0, 
  while time ( ) - now < = 20 :, 
  x = randint ( 2 , 10 ), 
  y = randint ( 2 , 10 ), 
  result = x * y, 
  print ( `` what is '' , x , `` times '' , y , '' ? '' ), 
  answer = int ( input ( '' '' ) ), 
  if answer = = result :, 
  points + = 1, 
  else :, 
  break, 
  print ( `` you scored : '' , points , `` point/s . '' ), 
  i 've got everything up and running except the last thing . 
  i do n't know how to exclude the last answer . 
  i 've tried the following things :, 
  adding : while time ( ) - now < = 20 and answer = = correct : , but i 've realized that wo n't work, 
  adding an elif time  20 : n - = 1 and adding the break too, 
  also tried a couple of other things , but none of them worked . 
  i believe i 'm running out of ideas . 
  any tips ? 
  if a user answers the question correctly , but after the 20 seconds time , he does n't receive a point . 
  we are supposed to do the homework without functions , since functions are the next thing we learn . 
  i 'll try to write it later using the function , thank you , 
  hmm i 'm not for us , so the things are probably a bit different . 
  i assume xnor gate is an exclusive disjunction ? 
  in that case , how do i know when to use it ? 
  do n't even start . 
  i 'm just `` doing '' my homework . 
  doing = staring into the problem for a few minutes , then getting nervous , because i do n't know what the hell i 'm supposed to do . 
  after that i take a quick chocolate/water/pee break . 
  and get back to `` doing '' the homework . 
  i love discrete math . 
  find_pairs ( `` a and b. 
  a and b and c. a. 
  a and b and c and d. b and a. '' ), 
  ** desired output : **, 
  [ [ ` a ' , ` b ' ] , [ ` b ' , ` c ' ] , [ ` a ' , ` b ' ] ], 
  thanks , i get it now .
