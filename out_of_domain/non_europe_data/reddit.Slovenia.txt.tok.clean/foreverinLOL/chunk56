  there are others but these are the ones i often listen to . 
  in mass effect 3 when you have to choose between the quarians and geth , i chose geth and tali was my romantic interest . 
  so it was basically genocide of the people that included the one i loved - but she killed herself . 
  i did n't really think it over that much , i thought well if the quarians do n't back off , then they die . 
  i was shocked when tali killed herself ... oh well . 
  ended up with liara in the end . 
  sorry what does dm-railroad logic mean ? 
  well yeah that is true . 
  but i still found stories in guilds better in general . 
  like fighters guild - all the skooma stuff , where the companions are not all that interesting . 
  mages guild - you have to get recommendations from everyone , which leads to interesting quests and you 're not even in the guild yet . 
  the college of winterhold was boring , it had some interesting quests , but mostly boring for me . 
  now thieves guild are great in both , but i prefer oblivion , since you get to steal an elder scroll from the moth priests . 
  that 's one of the best quests ever . 
  even though nocturnal was very good too . 
  daedric quests are pretty much great in both games . 
  haha , so you just went to her house and started killing her rats ? 
  did n't ask her anything ? 
  ah , i get it now . 
  yeah maybe you 're right about that . 
  but still i preferred it to skyrim . 
  great summation of the thieves guild , that was pretty much why i do n't like it . 
  like a clown , you amuse me . 
  that would make an interesting house episode . 
  my dad must be a grand champion then , he even faked his own death to stay hidden , but i 'm gon na find him !, 
  is she your ex , because she died ? 
  i think it 's the dog 's bollocks . 
  that 's just not true . 
  and i 'm your opposite . 
  i love to create scenarios in my head according to the mood of the music , even if i do n't understand the lyrics at all ( or there are none ) . 
  i could lay on my bed with eyes closed listening to music/imagining stuff all day . 
  however i must say , that visuals are n't a bad thing either . 
  i like different songs in different context as that was once a part of someone 's imagination . 
  the rock . 
  your best ? 
  losers always whine about their best . 
  winners go home and fuck the prom queen . 
  if she only looks like sarah palin and does n't talk like her - then i would n't mind , in fact that would be quite all right . 
  but if her personality is a part of the costume - no thanks . 
  as long as your head is above the smoke you 'll be fine . 
  in , out , in , out , in , out , in , out , in , out , in , out , in , out , in , out , ** in ** , ** out ** , ** in ** , ** out ** , ** iiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnn ** , ** ouuuuuuuuuutttt ** . 
  the end ? 
  what do you do when you watch it together ? 
  i mean is it like watching a normal movie ? 
  we never tried it , but then again we have n't felt the need for it ( yet ) . 
  maybe someday it happens . 
  coca cola - i noticed a lot of it in that 70 's show . 
  it was n't mine . 
  * laughs *, 
  neither is this !, 
  thanks for answering . 
  i see you 're one of them modern debate students . 
  we do n't take kindly to your kind here . 
  mus n't not ask us not it 's bussiness !, 
  i can just drift away with this song . 
  [ here it is ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee1s5oui9rm ), 
  but that 's just because yzma does n't like his spinach puffs . 
  that 's his turning point . 
  but that 's the thing . 
  she is n't even mean or bitchy towards him in the beginning . 
  but her husband starts missing for days and days and when she asks him he does n't really tell her a lot . 
  she catches him on a few lies and when she figures out he has been hiding cancer from her . . 
  i mean , all of that would make me lose my trust too . 
  even if you could attribute it to him acting out because of cancer at the beginning , the way he treats her gets worse and worse . 
  and i know he at first only wants something to take care of the family and that he ca n't really tell her what he is doing , since she would never approve of it . 
  but i do n't see her as a bad person , just a spouse that does n't trust her husband but also makes some mistakes by sometimes going too far . 
  they both make mistakes . 
  but since this will be the last act of assholery as you put it , i wonder what she will do and on what scale . 
  it 's going to have to be something big . 
  not to mention that he is the offspring of a brother and sister , which makes the gene pool pretty shallow and could account partly for him being a crazy fucker . 
  was n't he an obnoxious monkey who destroyed professors lab on multiple occasion and was the root cause for the creation of the powerpuff girls , since he was doing his monkey business and nudged the professor into adding the chemical x ? 
  he is the funniest villain in powerpuff girls though , only him was better in my opinion , because he/she was this evil , freaky presence . 
  have you ever seen a coyote eat spinach ? 
  mass effect 3 - kai leng on insanity . 
  i used about an hour and a half on that fucker . 
  the rest was easy , i just somehow could n't defeat him . 
  but i was very very satisfied when at last i made it . 
  i was a biotic and i think i took garrus and edi with me - incinerate and concussive shot , while i took care of the rest . 
  is n't it laugh , love , live , learn ? 
  well i think that anyone who believes everything they see in a movie or a tv show might be using about 10 % of their brain . 
  yeah the speed thing was what mostly got me . 
  and of course the regen . 
  but the worst ones were the phantoms . 
  if i did n't kill them quickly and hit them with my biotics , they would make their way to me and insta-kill . 
  they were like mini versions of kai leng . 
  blood diamond in my pants . 
  but you know what they say , the best offense is a good defense . 
  given that point , i find your comment offensive !, 
  do i have to check your privilege or what ? 
  oh hey bro , is this your second coming ? 
  my opinion is that i do n't take my opinion too seriously and i 'm dead serious about that !, 
  well given that genie comes from jinn - yeah you have your tricksters and some good ones . 
  probably not a good one if stashed in a bottle though . 
  me too . 
  no multiplayer . 
  i was either a sentinel or adept , i forgot . 
  i play through the game at least once a year and this was two years ago so it got pretty much erased from my memory with my last gameplay . 
  will there be refreshments too ? 
  are you scarface ? 
  will probably try it on my next play through .
