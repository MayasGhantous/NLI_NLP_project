  right now i 'm so excited that i ca n't see a downside to it all and am over optimistic for sure . 
  please share your thoughts/doubts with me !, 
  i 've found the forum posts about joe rogan and the `` scammy '' feeling about alphabrain ... 
  is it still a good place to start at least , or did i throw away my money ? 
  it seems i wo n't get my contract extended in a few months and i 'm in a new situation , trying to make a smart move . 
  there is a possibility of building a really small house , about 22 square meters . 
  i 'd have a system to produce food and other stuff but i ca n't figure out how much i would benefit from generating electricity while exercising in a small space ... 
  converting food i 've grown into a small amount of electricity but mainly , i imagine , quite a bit of heat !, 
  ( i 'm completely out of shape . 
  i 'm out of breath in a few meters if i run ... 
  i 'd be a furnice 5 minutes into cycling ! ) . 
  of course i would also use solar power , but in the winter it 's a problem because there is less sun . 
  and i would need heating because of that . 
  oh , i should also mention the tiny house would indeed be insulated to a high degree and i would use a heat recuperation system . 
  so the big question now is . 
  what percentage of the energy for heating would i be able to `` generate '' by getting off my lazy ass and cycle on a room bike for an hour ? 
  in terms of electricity produced ( and stored ) and heat `` radiated '' ? 
  i realise the would n't be much electricity , but how much heat does a person produce in an hour of excercise ? 
  [ how zombiemode ruined my evening ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/rwveh/whats_the_greatest_thing_youve_done_that_you_have/c49chk4 ), 
  i 've decided to ride a bicycle from barcelona to portugal this october , following the coast line . 
  i would like to get a tattoo at the end of my trip . 
  does anyone have any reccomendations ? 
  the piece will not be that complicated really , i think i 'll get a variation of [ this ] ( http://www.bobedwardsradio.com/storage/hst%20oldblueeye-steadman.jpg?__squarespace_cacheversion=1215078482858 ) graphic , but i 'm not so sure yet . 
  i may change my mind . 
  it will be my first tattoo , i ca n't afford to go top-of-the-line tattoo artist , but someone i can trust non the less ... 
  thank you !, 
  we were going to a picnic , buying food . 
  what stroke me the most was that in day-to-day life , i 'm really conscious about `` what '' and `` how much '' do i really need . 
  but being excited about the picnic and partying with friends , i went into `` hedonism '' mode . 
  and i was dead serious when i said those words ( if not too much ... it 's too little ) . 
  why was my honest , primal human reaction ... so consumerist ?!, 
  are we fighting agains our nature ? 
  i ca n't afford a completely new bicycle at the moment , so i 'm looking for a frame wich i would then slowly build up . 
  i really do n't care about the weight of the frame ( with 30kg of luggage it does n't make sense to worry about an extra kg ) but am looking for the strongest , most reliable frame that would last me years and miles . 
  should i consider another manufacturer ? 
  oh i prefer straight bars and plan on riding off-road quite a bit ( fully loaded ), 
  i have finished my first tour a few weeks ago and i 'm already planning my next one ... looks like i 'm hooked !, 
  anyway , i ca n't afford a fuly built bicycle at the moment , but i 'm looking for a bomb-proof frame capable of abouut 130kg of weight with no problems ( i 'm 95kg and with food and water packed for longer stretches i 'll carry 35kg of gear easily ), 
  also , i prefer straight bars and do not want to compromise on that by fitting straight bars to a drop-bar frame . 
  it will be my one and only and designed with my use in mind . 
  so , what are some other manufacturers that make expedition quality frames ? 
  the thing is , i have a very unusual set of demands for this rig and it is a bit too complicated for me to be comfortable i have thought of everything and that i understand it . 
  i have to be able to film myself riding a bicycle , but the point of the videos will be the scenery , so the camera has to be quite high and as far back as is functional ( i have n't yet made the final decision on the exact position of the carema ) . 
  this should n't be a problem , i plan on buying a carbon fiber pole ( am i thinking correctly if i assume this will take care of the vibration problems ? 
  how stiff can a 2-3m pole be ? ) . 
  the problem is the other part . 
  i will set up a mount on my bicycle ( most probably take out the seat and replace it with a strong alu tube ) that will turn 360 degrees and up and down . 
  ( something like [ this ] ( http://www.zazaslider.com/images/zazajib/zazajib1.jpg ) ) . 
  at the end of the pole there will be an exactly the same thiing , only smaller and a bit more complicated . 
  it will also turn 360 and also have a u profile that will allow `` up and down '' movement , but this time instead of the pole being mounted to the u-profile , there is a stabilization rig . 
  unfortunately , the `` stabilization '' rig has to be a limited in one direction . 
  i ca n't have movement left-right ( the camera is always pointing in the same direction as the pole ) . 
  this is why i ca n't just stick one of [ these ] ( http://goo.gl/z5tko ) at the end of the pole . 
  but the camera still has to stay level `` with gravity '' ( even if the ground is not flat ) . 
  the major difference from all the other normal tripod-mounted jibs is that this one will be mounted on a bicycle which will never or be on flat ground , so the first mount ( the one that will move the whole pole ) is never really flat . 
  i gave this system a lot of thought and think it could actually work . 
  this would keep the camera always facing in the way the pole is and it would keep it horizontal , right ? 
  sorry for the wall of text , english is not my native language and it 's really hard for me to explain exactly what i mean ... 
  i may have worded the question badly , i know it is very important to use the right terms , but i do n't have any proper background in philosophy . 
  after a little self analysis i think one of the biggest ideologies i 'm `` trapped in '' is consumerism . 
  as far as i understand it , ideology distorts our view of the world and am really tempted to do a life experiment , but i 'd like to do a bit of theoretical reading first ( besides \u017di\u017eek and henry david thoreau ) to feel i have a basic grasp on the `` problem '' i 'm trying to `` fix '' or `` overcome '' . 
  is it even possible to `` step out of '' an ideology that you have been living with all your life , or is it just a case of replacing one with another ( consumerism vs. voluntary simplicity ) ? 
  thank you all !, 
  i have an old marin alu trekking bike i bought about a year ago and have since spent hundereds of hours enjoying it . 
  it is everything i need , fast enough , carried me and 30kg of gear for a month allover spain and portugal ... 
  the only thing i wish for is a steel fork with front carrier `` fitting holes '' and the ability to change the position of the handlebar with the right selection of a stem . 
  that probably means buying a new fork that has n't been `` cut '' yet , so i can adjust the height , buy a new stem and probably a headset too . . 
  what should i look out for ? 
  any major problems with a `` procedure '' like that ? 
  edit : would any of these forks work ? 
  edit2 : here are two pictures of the bike , if needed, 
  my dad asked me to record a tutorial for a piece of software . 
  he 's not the best speaker in the world and i work in radio , so of course i got the `` job '' . 
  he will record the video with camstudio [ camstudio ] ( http://camstudio.org/ ) and i will record the audio track at work . 
  what would be the easies way of combining the two ( video and audio ) ? 
  am i correct in thinking that we do n't really need `` real-time '' recording of the screen capture ... it 's just a mouse moving across the screen and clicking on menus and stuff ( no audio coming from the software ) so it should be really easy to just `` pause '' the picture while audio content catches up ? 
  thank you to all the kind premiere experts for the help !, 
  hi all !, 
  i want to pay back my dad for the countless favours he did for me . 
  he 's a hobbyist woodworker and has his own `` wood-working shed '' wich is absolutelly filled with tools , wood , gadgets ... 
  it 's not even usable anymore . 
  if you want to cut a board , first you have to sped 20 minutes getting boxes out of the way , cut , and than put the boxes back where they were so you can actually get out of the workshop . 
  the main problem is : there is just too much stuff . 
  and i will do my best to make him `` throw away '' or at least store away everything unnecessary or not connected to woodworking . 
  but after reducing the ammount of all the stuff i will need a strategy to organize everything . 
  does anybody have any tips on how to achieve a well organized workshop ? 
  very few contacts i have in `` people '' have a `` send an sms '' option even if i have their phone number ... 
  i know it must be something very basic i 'm screwing up but ... 
  oh and i have wp8 on a lumia 1502 . 
  i 'm looking for any personal experience and advice on mostly two tents , but am also very open to suggestions for other models !, 
  here 's my situation :, 
  my girlfriend and i have decided to go on an open-ended tour of europe ( probably at least two years long , if we actually manage to stay in every country in europe for a few weeks woofing , couchsurfing , warmshower-ing , workexchanging and so on ) . 
  our primary sleeping option for sleeping in urban areas will be any and all of the free host options ( i 'm a very experienced host but have n't really `` surfed '' or been hosted that much ) . 
  in the worst of weather , if all else fails , we will spend the money on a hostel , but that 's really a last resort . 
  we 'll do it super low-budget but will not sacrifice health , safety or too much discomfort for a few eur . 
  but , when nature will be arround us and no extreme weather forcasted , we will stealth camp the shit out of any beautiful scenery we find !, 
  we do n't have the money to spend on top quality materials ( but will spend more when there is much benefit/safety ) , so an actual [ hilleberg nallo 3 ] ( http://www.outdoorfair.de/p-en-354-hilleberg-nallo-3-gt.aspx?variantid=934 ) , the rolls royce of bicycle touring tents for couples , as tom allen calls it , is out of the question . 
  but oh boy do i agree on the design advantages for long-term calling it a home . 
  so i 've been looking for cheaper alternatives , of wich there are many , but mostly in the 400-700 eur ( still cheaper than hilleberg ) from all the scandinavian tent makers . 
  same design , simmilar attention to detail and so on .
