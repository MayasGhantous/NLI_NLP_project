  i 'd love to see the ingredients for the serum as well ; it sucks that the centella one has alcohol so high on the list !, 
  vitamin c as well afaik . 
  how do you like it anyway ? 
  thank you !, 
  it does n't seem to be availabe on the usual international retailers yet althought i * think * 11st ships internationally ? 
  ( someone correct me if i 'm wrong ) . 
  we may have to wait a bit to get it on ebay at least but you can probably use a buying service now as well !, 
  that 's a good point . 
  and yeah , that smell is a hit or a miss , i like it but i know so many people who do n't . 
  interesting list , thank you again . 
  i love kara lmao . 
  \ud56d\ub8cc is fragrance probably !, 
  omg , a tea spoon !!, 
  that would 've traumatized anyone , i can feel the burn, 
  haha i feel you !, 
  thank you !!, 
  that sunscreen is one of my favorites !, 
  hey all !, 
  can anyone help me identify which of [ these ingredients ] ( http://m.blog.naver.com/0926love56/220863023162 ) is a ceramide ? 
  ohh thank you !!, 
  i thought there were n't any either !, 
  haha, 
  who is director pi ? 
  oh i only did it to take the photo but you 're right , he did n't like it so i wo n't do it again . 
  thank you , 
  til . 
  thank you , i 'll look her up !!, 
  iirc the pa + + + + rating is coming ( early ? ), 
  next year, 
  here are some sources [ 1 ] ( http://www.fntimes.com/paper/view.aspx?num=156746 ) [ 2 ] ( http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2016/06/24/0200000000akr20160624170100017.html ) . 
  according to these sites kfda announced it in june but i have n't found any info of when it will actually take effect . 
  i have no idea where i had the early next year info from but at least it 's happening !, 
  aww that 's adorable !, 
  left is gradient style and right is full lips . 
  ohh , what product is it if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  that 's exactly what i do every day !, 
  :d i love the scinic + kikumasamune combo . 
  not op but i buy it from tester korea , 
  not op but yes , you 'd use an oil cleanser followed by a foaming cleanser . 
  ideally avoid those with a high ph. 
  check out r/asianbeauty for more info !, 
  ohh !, 
  is that the yellow tube ? 
  how does it dry down ? 
  ** holy fail **, 
  ** oily , acne prone **, 
  ** comments : ** this did nothing for me aside from some slight hydration . 
  no calming , soothing or glow . 
  i never finished it because i got so bored of it . 
  mostly just like putting thicker water on my face ... 
  ** holy grail **, 
  ** 2sol propolis soothing solution **, 
  ** comments : ** this stuff is awesome . 
  calms down my redness and acne so well , i even use it as a spot treatment . 
  it has a gel texture and absorbs wonderfully . 
  smells like real propolis so that might be a con for some . 
  thank you !, 
  are you sure ? 
  because that one is called [ sun milk ] ( http://www.misshaus.com/all-around-safe-block-waterproof-sun-milk-spf50-pa-70ml.html ) as opposed to just [ sun ] ( http://www.misshaus.com/shop/skin-care/sun-care/all-around-safe-block-waterproof-sun-spf50-pa.html ) , which is what the op wrote . 
  that 's why i wanted to make sure . 
  ohh ... you 're right , i feel so silly now . 
  they lost the ( coming soon ) and got the descriptions so i assumed they were available !, 
  sigh ... sorry guys . 
  i 'd love love to see that comparison too . 
  yup , it 's the best thing i 've tried so far !, 
  way better than tosowoong . 
  i do n't have major redness problems though and i have n't tried that many things that would help but it 's like 10 bucks on testerkorea so i 'd say worth a shot . 
   hope it works for you !, 
  ** the face shop dr. belmeur clarifying moisturizer **, 
  well of course , the sun milks are more popular . 
  do n't see how that 's relevant though ... 
  ohh that sounds awesome . 
  nice !, 
  exactly what i 'm looking for . 
  thank you !, 
  me too !, 
  i 've never even heard of it before . 
  oh , thank you . 
  hey !, 
  they actually posted a few example regimens [ here ] ( http://ordinaries.com/regimenguide ) . 
  i 'd directly email them and ask !, 
  they 're usually very helpful but lately their cs has been pretty crappy so if you do n't get a response i 'd keep bugging them lol . 
  i can try and answer any questions as well , but keep in mind i 'm not a professional !, 
  sure !, 
  woah , aside from the ridiculous amounts used in the video that everyone is discussing , pa + + + + is finally in korea !!!!!!!, 
  hopefully other brands will follow quickly !, 
  i could be wrong but it looks like melasma to me . 
  judging purely by the color , i do n't know where the textural issues would come from . 
  maybe unrelated ? 
  like i said , i could be wrong but i think it 's worth looking into . 
  could be rosacea or melasma . 
  [ here ] ( http://m.blog.naver.com/subin6656/220913772747 ) are some swatches !, 
  first up is moist and then matte . 
  the shade order is petal , beige , vanilla , tan and sand in both pictures . 
  it looks like all will still be too dark for me but i 'm glad they expanded the shade range . 
  i copied this from op 's reply to another question and i thought it was a good answer :, 
   picking can damage the skin in a number of ways . 
  you can end up with broken capillaries , which do n't go away unless you undergo laser treatment for them . 
  depending upon your skin , it may also give you trouble with scars . 
  i 'm very prone to scarring and redness , so if i pick , i usually end up with nasty red splotches where i 've been picking ( but i have seen people on here say they do n't get scars if they pop a zit as opposed to waiting it out so ymmv ) .
