  also , if you open up the skin , you 're making yourself vulnerable to infection . 
  there have been some scary stories on this sub about people who have popped zits and gotten mrsa . 
  hmm . 
  the only other thing that comes to mind is tinea versicolor . 
  i 'd really suggest visiting a dermatologist if you can though . 
  i 'm sorry i was n't of much help , good luck !, 
  honestly , your skin looks perfectly good to me . 
  nothing to worry about . 
  nice routine too !, 
  haha aww that 's a beautiful piggie !, 
  ** innisfree oat mild moisture lotion **, 
  ahh that 's adorable . 
  good luck with the delivery !, 
  thanks !, 
  they have a pump bottle now so i would n't have the problem with the dispenser . 
  do you find it dries down sticky/shiny ? 
  i 'm so sorry :(, 
  i actually like this mask . 
  it 's super moisturizing on my oily skin . 
  decent sleeping pack , however have n't seen any exfoliation either . 
  guess i 'm lucky it did n't break me out !, 
  my thoughts exactly !, 
  get well soon little jane . 
  i 'm so sorry . 
  have you tried the ordinary ? 
  hope you find one !, 
  seconding this !, 
  yes !!!, 
  my skin is just oily , period . 
  shhh . . let 's just call it `` dewy '' . 
  are you sure ? 
  i asked deciem about it and they said they have n't been released yet . 
  yeah i 've seen that . 
  i asked them less than a week ago . 
  yeah i could be wrong but i think their new products appear on the site a few weeks before they 're actually released . 
  does n't it just say `` email me when in stock '' ? 
  idk man , i 'm just passing on what i 've been told . 
  innisfree perfect uv protection cream triple care spf50 + pa + + + might be worth looking into . 
  it 's my favorite sunscreen !, 
  it contains fragrance ( [ here ] ( https://m.imgur.com/of52bew?r ) are the ingredients ) but it is n't strong at all . 
  smells lightly like herbs or pine trees ? 
  and does n't linger . 
  it has a light pinkish beige tint to it which helps with the white cast as well . 
  very creamy texture and not drying , sinks in beautifully . 
  that 's odd . 
  side-eyeing mine now ... 
  my skin freaked when i started taking it too , horrible acne . 
  it cleared up by itself in 3-4 months and i 've never had hormonal acne since . 
  how are you liking the advanced retionid ? 
  ( ignore this if my zoom in powers have failed me ), 
  thank you !, 
  what is that ? 
  you are awesome !, 
  thank you so much for this !, 
  thank you , i have an appointment soon so def will do !, 
  oh wow , interesting . 
  thank you for this , will read up on it !, 
  i 'll look into it , thanks !, 
  could it be over exfoliation ? 
  have you tried layering a few lighter hydrating layers followed by an occlusive ? 
  like the `` 7 skin method '' ? 
  your skin might be more receptive to lighter layers . 
  i 'm really no expert though so i hope you find someone who will actually help !, 
  good luck !, 
  i am so sorry :(, 
  oh thank you , that sounds very unpleasant . . : /, 
  ohh i 'll keep my eyes peeled for that review !, 
  what vitamin c do you use ? 
  when in your routine do you use it ? 
  thank you !, 
  i might just give it a go, 
  that 's it , into my cart it goes ... 
  thanks !, 
  oh - have you experienced any irritation at all ? 
  ah , sounds like my skin lol . 
  i 'll probably be good . 
  thanks so much !, 
  these are awesome !, 
  my hg too !, 
  a carrot is always better if it 's stolen !, 
  according to my pigs at least, 
  it sounds like a [ peeling gel ] ( http://m.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=peeling+gel&amp;isnewkw=1&amp;isrefine=true&amp;mfs=goclk&amp;acimp=0&amp;_trksid=p2056088.m2428.l1313.tr0.trc0.xpeeling+gel&amp;sqp=peeling+gel ) , they 're pretty popular in korean skincare . 
  omg that coloring !, 
  they 're both adorable !, 
  hi wally !, 
  you 're so cute !, 
  yes !!, 
  she seems to be happy with it !, 
  so cute oh gosh, 
  think of the children !, 
  [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/asianbeauty/comments/4y5mjg/importance_of_sunscreen_application_technique/ ) ? 
  came here to say this , love the guy . 
  that 's one fluffy pig !, 
  exactly !, 
  it 's what makes him the perfect vet . 
  if your skin is fine with it you can use it am and pm . 
  i had the same experience personally . 
  i went off and my skin started breaking out and after a year i went back on to address that very problem and cysts everywhere . 
  it calmed down after 3 months or so and my skin is fine now . 
  just wait a few months and hopefully your skin calms down !,
