  from this picture it seems to be [ qdk joinery ] ( http://www.qdk.com.au/ ) . 
  the first 3 letters on the plate are probably qdk as well , ca n't read the numbers though . 
  mybe 000 ? 
  woah . 
  have you ever tried skinlex ? 
  looks amazing . 
  that 's a good point !, 
  how well can someone test these things on their own ? 
  or , actually - how are these tests even conducted ? 
  i know next to nothing about chemistry , so this is very interesting to me . 
  never too late . 
  yikes , that sounds horrible . 
  definitely above average . 
  it 's still a working progress . 
  i have oily skin and i use the clarifying moisturizer . 
  it 's a light gel moisturizer , easily absorbed and just the right amount of moisture for my skin , i really like it !, 
  same here . 
  micellar water works fine on my waterproof sunscreen . 
  i use garnier pink cap . 
  thanks for this review !, 
  really interested , might order it soon . 
  aw , i have a poppy too !, 
  i like tfs dr belmeur clarifying moisturizer . 
  very lightweight , plus comes in a tube . 
  this actually happened to [ tommy cooper ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/tommy_cooper#career ) . 
  sure !, 
  it has a gel-like consistency and is super easy to spread . 
  i find it absorbs completely ( even if i use a big glob ) , with a satin finish if i use it after a few hydrating layers . 
  if i use it on its own it can dry a bit tacky but half a minute of patting it in fixes that . 
  it 's moisturizing enough for me even if i use it on its own . 
  it does have quite a scent though , almost smells like sage to me although it does n't contain it , so i suppose eucalyptus/peppermint give it that smell . 
  it does n't have artificial fragrance . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_798c259747.html ) is the full ingredient list . 
  as you can see , it has lime oil which could possibly be photosensitising , some people avoid citrus oils . 
  it has n't bothered my skin , i do wear sunscreen though !, 
  overall i would definitely recommend it . 
  if there 's anything i have n't covered , just ask !, 
   i 'm interested in the cleanser though - do you happen to know the ph ? 
  is it drying at all ? 
  i think it would work well as another moisturizing layer , it 's very inoffensive and easy to layer . 
  that cleanser sounds amazing though !, 
  right up my alley . 
  thank you so much for such a thorough review , i think this might be the next cleanser i try . 
  not op but i use it and it 's definitely pinkish , sorry to say . 
  not a strong tint though . 
  do try it !, 
  i have warm undertones as well and it 's still my favorite sunscreen , so ... that says a lot . 
  it 's text , not a video . 
  the woman only got her licence revoked for 3 months plus some other petty stuff . 
  same in cards 2 view . 
  not just images though , text posts as well . 
  let 's hope he does n't have a sister ... 
  goodbye . 
  so sweet !, 
  i think you meant to reply to / u/newberrie . 
  he 's evolving . 
  i 'd recommend layering hydrating toners ( and maybe essences ) . 
  check out / r/asianbeauty for some recs . 
  i love that sunscreen too . 
  i think it is . 
   if you do n't find it hydrating enough , try something with hyaluronic acid ; like [ this ] ( https://www.amazon.com/hada-labo-hadalabo-gokujun-hyaluronic/dp/b00bsnbo9o ) . 
  not an answer but how are you liking the amber ray serum ? 
  hmm , i 'm not too sure about that . 
  does it have any ingredients sensitive to light ? 
  i think many if not all ingredients degrade faster in the presence of light , but i 'm not sure if that difference is big enough to matter in most ingredients . 
  exceptions being vitamin c and retinol for example . 
  i 'm not too knowledgeable about this so if i 'm wrong someone please correct me . 
  you 're definitely not hurting it by putting it back in the box though !, 
  i checked the ingredients of the serum and licorice extract is pretty high on the list , it seems lovely . 
  hopefully it works for you !, 
  yeah it seems to be polish , maybe . 
  the ones they hire to say that . 
  i think op meant they do n't leave the water to evaporate but rather put shea butter on the skin immediately after wiping excess water off with hands . 
  if that 's the case , would n't that make a difference ? 
  so sealing it in would n't help ? 
  interesting . 
  i dry my face with a paper towel so have never even considered this . 
  i pat it in , as opposed to rubbing . 
  sorry for being unclear . 
  my question was , would transepidermal water loss still occur even if she applies shea butter ( occlusive ) on top of it ? 
  to anyone who has used both ** klairs supple preparation facial toner ** and ** benton aloe bha toner ** - which one do you prefer and why ? 
  i 'm looking for a new soothing hydrating toner . 
  exactly this , i hate it . 
  ohh , okay . 
  thanks for clearing that up !, 
   i 'm not sure it would do much either . 
  an actual hydrating layer instead of water would work much better for sure . 
  i see !, 
  thanks , i 'll keep that in mind !, 
  that 's very helpful , thank you !, 
  ah , that makes sense !, 
  that sounds perfect . 
  thanks !, 
  for gentle physical exfoliation , look into peeling gels as well . 
  my favorite . 
  interesting . 
  thanks for the input !, 
  i 've only ever used 3 but i can recommend all of them . 
  [ secret key lemon d-toc ] ( https://www.amazon.com/secretkey-peeling-gelkorean-cosmetics-korean/dp/b00r295fpc ) ( which i think was reformulated into [ this ] ( https://www.iherb.com/pr/secret-key-lemon-sparkling-peeling-gel-120-ml/69960 ) ) , a sample of [ missha super aqua ] ( https://www.amazon.com/missha-super-aqua-peeling-gel/dp/b001ctl8mm ) , and [ nature republic super aqua max ] ( https://www.amazon.com/nature-republic-super-aqua-peeling/dp/b00ebzcx5a ) , which is the one i 'm using right now . 
  ( names of the last two are weirdly similar i just realized , what 's so super about water ? ),
