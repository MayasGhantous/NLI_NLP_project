  i have the same toner coming in the mail * nervous giggle *, 
  i 'll pray for both of us, 
  hmm , it definitely leaves a white cast on my ( pasty white ) skin . 
  it 's not bad and disappears a bit after half an hour , but it 's there . 
  are you sure you 're applying enough ? 
  yeah , i 've seen mostly good reviews so i 'm hopeful . 
  girl ... fingers crossed it 's just a random breakout . 
  my skin is oily too !, 
  hopefully it likes it better ... 
  that is fucking terrifying, 
  what do you use now ? 
  thank you !, 
  oh it definitely fades a lot . 
  i only notice it because it helps even out my redness . 
  peeling gels actually work as gentle physical exfoliants !, 
  i love them for that purpose . 
  but yeah , does n't take your skin off . 
  yeah , i 'm with you on this one . 
  it 's starting to get kind of annoying . 
  yep, 
  i use 6 drops , 2 on my forehead , one on each cheek , one on my nose and one on my chin . 
  i use it weekly and it will take me forever to finish it . 
  i agree . 
  i use a peeling gel for light physical exfoliation and my skin loves it . 
  the circle jerk in this sub is real ... 
  let me know how that goes, 
  understandable , have a nice day !, 
  hey i think that 's pretty spot on !, 
  thanks !, 
  most oils are n't [ occlusive ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/asianbeauty/comments/3v6yb8/psa_for_your_winter_dryness_most_oils_arent/ ) . 
  why do n't you try using it under your cream ? 
  it 's a copypasta so go ahead and downvote . 
  i agree with them , you have no reason to lack confidence !, 
  here is [ mine !,

  i think it makes sense though , you can imagine darren was running out of time . 
  yes, 
  haha that 's okay !, 
  that reminds me of my favorite dickens quote :, 
  `` a wonderful fact to reflect upon , that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other . 
  a solemn consideration , when i enter a great city by night , that every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret ; that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret ; that every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there , is , in some of its imaginings , a secret to the heart nearest it ! '', 
  stay away from victorian literature then ... `` making love '' meant flirting . 
  do you guys know of any peeling gels that can be used on wet skin other than the laneige one ? 
  how long do product breakouts last after you discontinue using it ? 
  do they usually stop immediately ? 
  i 'm not sure if it 's this or another product because i introduced them like a week apart with minimal patch testing ( i know ... ) . 
  looks like i 'll give it a few more weeks before i either confirm or rule it out . 
  thank you !, 
  you 're right . 
  thanks for reminding me to think for myself !, 
  yeah , lol . 
  apparently the spouse is always innocent in these cases . 
  i apply it like [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/1kvpxzkqg4i ) and i 've never had any pilling problems . 
  just pat until it 's not sticky anymore . 
  i 've only seen a few reviews . 
  the ph level is 5.5 , which is great but it contains sls , a potential acne trigger . 
  i 'm a newbie when it comes to skincare so i 'm sorry if i sound clueless , but -- is there a way to know the probability of my skin getting irritated ? 
  i have hormonal acne and do n't usually break out from products , but i still think i should try a few samples of this first . 
  has anyone tried it ? 
  your overall thoughts ? 
  i use a cleanser with a ph of 5.5 , but the ph of the tap water in this area is around 8 . 
  would n't rinsing the cleanser off raise the ph of my skin anyway , thus rendering the cleanser 's ph irrelevant ? 
  i also like to wash off my actives before continuing my routine . 
  should i be concerned about this ? 
  after over a month ( !! ), 
  i realized my constant breakouts have been the result of my sunscreen , after i applied some on my arms and got a few pimples . 
  how do i go about figuring out which ingredient broke me out ? 
  i 'm really acne prone so i can never know if i 'm breaking out due to a product or just completely randomly/because of hormones . 
  this is the one i used - http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_429c196388.html . 
  i 've used many products with butylene glycol before so i doubt that 's the culprit . 
  could it be zinc oxide ? 
  maybe one of the other ingredients ? 
  have any of these broken you out before ? 
  i 'm reposting this from another thread in hopes of getting some more opinions . 
  has anyone with acne prone skin tried tosowoong 's propolis sparkle ampoule ? 
  how does it fare in terms of acne soothing ? 
  if you also tried cosrx 's a-sol , how do they compare ? 
  i have very oily but not dehydrated skin ( i do n't think so ? 
  it never feels tight , always looks plump and fine , i use a ph 5.5 cleanser ) . 
  i just got the scinic honey aio and it 's very sticky for me . 
  i have read some reviews saying it 's not sticky at all . 
  i feel like it just sits on my face . 
  same goes for most other products , the only one i felt actually sank into my skin nicely is the mizon snail aio but that one breaks me out .
