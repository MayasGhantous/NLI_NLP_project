  is there anything wrong with my skin ? 
  anything i can do to help it absorb better ? 
  most bb creams are too dark for me ... 
  i 'm pretty pale , never used mac but my guess would be around nw10-15 ? 
  yellow undertones . 
  missha perfect cover no13 is a tiny bit too light but i could work with that if it was n't so pink . 
  holika holika aqua petit jelly in no. 1 is a bit too dark ( smh lol ) but nothing noticable , it has warm undertones which is perfect but it oxidizes too fast on me and the coverage is too low . 
  does n't last all day either . 
  i have oily skin and would prefer a matte finish . 
  i also ca n't afford brands like iope or atrue and would prefer a liquid foundation to a bb cushion . 
  however i 'd love to hear any and all of your suggestions , even if it does n't completely fit !, 
  i feel like that 's too many requirements , i 'll probably struggle forever ; _ ;, 
  edit : some corrections, 
  i 'm especially interested in the toner and the first essence , they seem to have amazing ingredients !, 
  any opinions about other products in the line are very welcome as well , 
  i know it 's never just one product , but if you had to choose - what would it be ? 
  any oily , acne prone skin folks out here try it ? 
  either the regular or the high moist version . 
  i 'd love to hear your thoughts !, 
  i messaged them and received the info that they are only posting buy now deals from now on . 
  guess it was n't worth it ? 
  still , it 's a bummer to me as a broke college student . 
  looking for a little something for my sister , any recommendations are welcome !, 
  got a bb cream sample today and was surprised at how light it wasssss . 
  it 's missha signature complexion coordinating bb cream - white . 
  it leans pink so probably better for nw10s , but it 's still more neutral than their perfect cover in 13 , so i ( nc10 ) was able to pull it off . 
  it has pretty low coverage but it covered all of my redness , definitely dewy though so stay away if you do n't like that . 
  it contains 5 % niacinamide according to their [ website ] ( http://www.etonymoly.com/html/itemdetail.asp?guid=4249&cate=0 ) . 
  can anyone confirm this ? 
  has anyone tried it ? 
  i * think * it 's been reformulated , so i 'm not sure if the older version ( s ? ), 
  had the same ingredients . 
  someone correct me if i 'm wrong though . 
  it looks [ intriguing ] ( http://jolse.com/product/innisfree-green-barley-overnight-peeling-mask-100ml/7159/?cate_no=220&display_group=1 ) , but i have n't really found any reviews of it ( yet ? ) . 
  :( if anyone tried it , i 'd love to hear your thoughts !, 
  my friend just returned from korea and got me these pongdang [ aloe ] ( http://www.freshpongdang.com/product/detail.html?product_no=28 ) and [ raspberry ] ( http://www.freshpongdang.com/product/detail.html?product_no=30 ) soothing gels , but they both contain alcohol ( ethanol ) within the first 3 ingredients . 
  i have oily , non-dehydrated skin that is n't sensitive in any way . 
  would these be okay to use ? 
  or would prolonged use truly dry my skin out and damage my moisture barrier ? 
  ** edit : sold !, 
  expires april 2018 . 
  selling for $ 5 with $ 1 standard shipping within eu . 
  hey all !, 
  this is my first review and first cushion !, 
  it 's one of the three newly launched innisfree cushions . 
  they changed the name from long wear to long wear cover and the new one only fits the new cases . 
  i 'm not sure if it 's an actual reformulation as well though . 
  here 's the [ photo album ] ( http://imgur.com/a/2qxjb ) . 
  sorry about the crappy camera . 
  my thoughts :, 
  for reference , i have nc10 oily acne prone skin , hormonal acne . 
  ** packaging : ** since it 's my first cushion i have nothing to compare it to ; some people say the case feels too cheap but i actually find no problem there . 
  i like it . 
  ** smell : ** pine trees . 
  period . 
  it 's not too strong and does n't linger . 
  ** color : ** i got the color c13 . 
  the swatches in my photos look a bit more yellow than it actually looks . 
  i 'd say it 's pretty neutral . 
  looks really pink on my hand but works surprisingly well on my face !, 
  a tad bit too pink and too dark but it 's barely noticeable ; i can definitely work with it . 
  i 'm pleasantly surprised in that aspect , i 've never found a bb cream that fits my skin tone as well as this cushion . 
  it does n't seem to oxidize at all !, 
  ** finish : ** relatively dewy . 
  i was really hoping for a matte finish but nope . 
  nothing a bit of finishing powder ca n't fix though . 
  ** coverage : ** low to medium . 
  considering they changed the name to longwear cover cushion i was really expecting more coverage lol . 
  it evens out my redness and covers any lighter pih ; if your skin is as pih ridden as mine you 're gon na need a concealer though . 
  ** wear : ** the wear time is decent . 
  i 've been wearing it for 9 hours and around 10-20 % has worn off . 
  i like the oil control though , it took me 3 hours until i needed to blot my nose which is the most i 've experienced with any foundation . 
  * verdict : 3.5 / 5 *, 
  if you have any questions , shoot . 
  and why ? 
  i know there 's been threads like these before but time 's passed and i 'm looking for some new opinions !, 
  does n't seem like it 's been posted here before but skinfood recently came out with a new line of [ wash off masks ] ( http://www.testerkorea.com/category/skinfood-2 ) . 
  5 total !, 
  according to the packaging watermelon is for soothing , cranberry toning , coconut firming , lemon brightening , apple hydrating and pineapple peeling . 
  will you be picking any of these up ? 
  here are some new ( ish ) releases :, 
  * [ retinol 1 % ] ( http://ordinaries.com/product/rdn-retinol-1pct-30ml ), 
  * [ alpha lipoic acid 5 % ] ( http://ordinaries.com/product/rdn-alpha-lipoic-acid-5pct-30ml ), 
  * [ 100 % plant-derived squalane ] ( http://ordinaries.com/product/rdn-100pct-plant-derived-squalane-30ml ), 
  * [ argireline solution 10 % ] ( http://ordinaries.com/product/rdn-argireline-solution-10pct-30ml ), 
  i 'd love to hear your thoughts !, 
  has anyone tried any of these yet ? 
  i had horrible hormonal acne until i got on birth control . 
  i 'm talking cystic acne every month with no fail . 
  no diet or routine change would affect them at all . 
  birth control cleared my skin up completely in that respect however i 've noticed melasma about a year in ( amazing ... ) . 
  it 's not very severe in terms of color but it does cover over half of my face which makes it look like i have a bad tan when compared to my neck . 
  so , the way i see it - i either get off birth control and try to control my acne ( and possibly melasma still ) or i stay on and try to fade my melasma . 
  i 'm leaning towards the second option , not very hopeful it 's even possible to achieve but i 'd like to hear your thoughts . 
  or , is there a third way i 'm not seeing ? 
  can i control hormonal acne without throwing my hormones off balance/melasma ? 
  i 'd appreciate all help . 
  if nothing else works , i might just have to learn to live with it . 
  i 'm looking into buying it to replace my vitamin c. any thoughts ? 
  i 'm using the cards 2 view if that matters .
