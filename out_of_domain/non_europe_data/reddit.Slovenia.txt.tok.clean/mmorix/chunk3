  dang , yeah it is . 
  :( your skin progress is amazing even despite that though , i 'm jealous haha !, 
  you look stunning !, 
  seconding this . 
  i 've heard great things about kikumasamune high moist lotion , definitely the next product i 'm trying out !, 
  it 's said to be highly moisturizing , 
  the closest thing i can think of is [ peripera love fairy tint glow stick ] ( http://www.dollyskin.ro/shop/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/peripera-love-fairy-tint-glow-stick-colors.jpg ) , though i 'm not sure if that 's what you 're looking for !, 
  ahh , i see . 
  ca n't help you then , sorry : c, 
  ohh i remember you , the stark girl right ?? 
  haha . 
  incredible progress !, 
  i 've been putting it in and out of my shopping cart for like a year now lmao , i rarely buy lip products but these look so good , i 've read amazing reviews too . 
  anyway , hope you find the flower-in-lipstick thingies ( i 'm terrible with words ) , they 're something to look at for sure !, 
  that essential hydrogel mask pack looks interesting , let us know how you like it please !, 
  whaaaaat i 'm from slovenia , this is awesome , thank youu !, 
  ** mini review request ** : etude house big cover concealer bb in shade vanilla , specifically how well it would match nc10/how light in color is it ? 
  nooooooooooooooo, 
  thank you for sharing !, 
  interesting stuff . 
  sigh , i feel you . 
  you look great !, 
  woah that looks amazingggggg !, 
  i do n't see any ashiness , my gosh your skin looks so beautiful and glowy !, 
  great haul !, 
  just make sure you have a good moisturizing routine + sunscreen down before you start introducing the acids . 
  good luck !, 
  ** skin type : ** oily , acne prone, 
  ** problems : ** acne , pih , clogged pores, 
  ** products : ** have n't found any hgs ^ yet but my skin likes the cosrx bha & aha liquids and snail aio cream , melano cc , tosowoong troubex sparkling first essence , propolis ampoule and enzyme powder wash and scinic honey aio . 
  broke out from mizon snail aio ( even though it made me skin super soft ugh ) and ost c20 ( no it was n't just purging ; _  . 
  edit : formatting, 
  high moist is the pink bottle yes . 
  i got mine off ebay for like 18 bucks with free shipping !, 
  i 'm in a same place right now and i feel the same . 
  hugs < 3, 
  you can definitely wash it off with water !, 
  i do it with my cosrx bha , not because it 's too strong but because it feels greasy on my skin . 
  try washing it off after 5 min and see how your skin feels , if that 's ok you can increase the wait time . 
  the cosrx contains 4 % betaine salicylate and many do indeed feel it 's pretty gentle , me including . 
  actually , yeah probably . 
  ca n't say for sure though . 
  definitely creamy !, 
  too much for my oily skin . 
  yeah, 
  it actually has color changing pigments in it so it changes color as your rub it in , but maybe it would work with patting ? 
  yeah it acts as a cc for sure , i was confused about that too . 
  have you tried perfect cover in # 13 ? 
  they are about the same lightness so if that one was too dark for you this one might be as well , however it takes some effort to completely blend it out so i think you could adjust the lightness as you go . 
   famous washcloth/oil cleanser step, 
  that made me laugh lol, 
  i have so many lol , they all get passed down to my sister  . , 
  yeah that happens to me too !, 
  this one does n't change color so fast though and even blended out it did n't look too dark, 
  i have n't tried that one no :( i want to though !, 
  this one is too dewy for my skin , it 's not hot where i live ( europe ) but i have oily skin so i needed to set it with a powder . 
  it 's probably more suited to dry skin types . 
  i use the aqua petit jelly most of the time actually !, 
  haha . 
  it 's a bit too dark , so that 's not ideal but i make it work . 
  i love the finish and coverage of it !, 
  my favorite so far . 
  sigh . 
  the only skincare my dad uses is body wash on his face when he showers . 
  yep . 
  looks like it 's correct then , that 's the highest percentage of niacinamide i 've seen in an ab product by far . 
  what 's wrong with my skin !?!?!?!, 
  i recently got the kikumasamune high moist lotion because i 've got a good feedback from other oily skin folks . 
  literally every review i 've read said it absorbs fast but no matter how little i use it leaves a sticky residue . 
  everything dries sticky on me , even the most watery essences and i was hoping this would help . 
  why is everything so sticky ? 
  not a rhetorical question , if anyone can offer any help i 'd be most grateful . 
  does the a'pieu air fit cushion lean more yellow than the missha 13 ? 
  i have the troubex first essence . 
  it 's pretty good . 
  it does soothe my skin a bit and helps everything else absorb a bit better but it has a bit of a silicone-y finish . 
  there 's no smell whatsoever . 
  also got some zymogen hottuynia cordata serum samples , have been using it for like 2 weeks . 
  it 's super watery but it takes like 5 minutes for me to absorb . 
  very sticky at first but it absorbs surprisingly well . 
  i ca n't tell if it 's helping my skin or not as there are too many factors in play right now but it definitely did n't make my skin worse . 
  super strong herbal/slightly alchoholy scent though . 
  yes i got the lotion , i double checked just now lol . 
  i pump some in the palm of my hand and then pat all over my face , do you think a cotton pad would be better ? 
  it 's okay in the morning because i use a matte sunscreen but my final step in the evening is the cosrx snail cream which dries sticky on me as well lol . 
  what cream/emulsion do you use ? 
  oooo let me know if anything works !, 
  thank you !, 
  thank you , i 'll give it a try !, 
  thank you !, 
  yeah , i wish that was updated more often . 
  ** review request : ** the saem dewy love anything . 
  cream , emulsion , toner , essence . 
  barely any reviews out there . 
  ; _ ; anyone ? 
  i would be all over this if i did n't have the bha liquid in the mail ... it seems to have the same amount of betaine salicylate in it anyway , i was hoping for something stronger sighhh, 
  oh my god , could you post some comparison swatches of all those bb creams/foundations ? 
  i would be eternally grateful ; - ;, 
  i found [ this post ] ( http://blog.naver.com/hindog/220639244199 ) with some product pics !, 
  i neither have dry nor aging skin but i kind of want them all ...
