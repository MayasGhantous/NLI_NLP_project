  thank you !!, 
  yup , me too . 
  my face is practically an oil factory ; _ ;, 
  actually , i just saw it 's all available on [ jolse ] ( http://jolse.com/products/new/24/ ) already !, 
  this is from the description of the cream ( not my grammar , lol ) :, 
  highly-moisturizing gel cream with ceramide for elastic skin with jeju lava seawater . 
  special mineral is contained for anti-aging effect . 
  3 kinds of moisture factor and natural moisturizing factor are enhanced by jeju lava seawater for vital moisture skin barrier . 
  cream & ceramide double caring - as soon as be applied , creame and ceramide capsule are mixed for full moisturizing with gel texture , forming strong moisture protective film . 
  jeju lava seawater 75.2 % contained . 
  seems like some products contain ceramides and some do n't , the descriptions vary but mostly just moisturizing/firming . 
  i agree !, 
  noo i did n't translate , just copied the description from jolse !, 
  do n't thank me for that !, 
  haha . 
  i agree , it sounds awesome though !, 
  woah !, 
  you just made my day !, 
  i 'll keep that in mind next time i 'm blotting my face , haha . 
  btw your username is adorable !, 
  lol that happens to me way too often :(, 
  yes, 
  does anyone know the % ? 
  i went from 5 to just 4 , mostly because i 'm trying to be frugal but i manage to spread it across my whole face ; 1 for the chin and nose , 1 for each cheek and 1 for my forehead . 
  i could n't go down to 3 though , i 'd say 5 is just right like you said . 
  it depends on the size of your face , but yeah . 
  actually , the scinic aio - i do n't know what kind of honey everyone else it used to , but to me it smells nothing like honey - just kinda floral i guess ? 
  i disliked the smell at first but i 've grown quite fond of it , it smells kinda luxurious to me somehow lol . 
  ymmv !, 
  yay !, 
  thank you !, 
  hope it goes well :d, 
  that 's not surprising but still disappointing . 
  please do !, 
  seconding this !, 
  sure !, 
  that would be great too , 
  i know some people do n't like them , but i thought this was a great deal !, 
  i have n't tried tonymoly masks yet but i might grab the chance now . 
  sigh . 
  i was already getting my hopes up lol . 
  ca n't wait to see your swatches !, 
   that is very true haha , the struggle is real . 
  yay !, 
  good to see some saint peau . 
   great reviews , steering clear of the evil scinic sunscreen , haha . 
  no , but i 've been eyeing them so hard lately ; their packaging is beautiful so it 's great to hear the product quality matches !, 
  really ? 
  i might bite the bullet on the snail ampoule then , the ingredients look great too . 
  i 'll read up on it some more , thanks !, 
  there are many products containing ocean/sea water !, 
  in addition , here are some products specifically containing sea salt : [ elizavecca milky piggy sea salt cream ] ( http://m.koreadepart.com/item/1396414611/ ) , [ mizon water volume ex line ] ( http://www.roseroseshop.com/index.php?route=product/product&amp;product_id=290240 ) , [ a'pieu essential source salt cream ] ( http://www.testerkorea.com/product/apieu-essential-source-salt-cream-100ml ) , [ the saem salt miracle cream ] ( http://www.jolse.com/product/the-saem-salt-miracle-cream-80g/4643/ ) , [ skinfood 0,9 moist line ] ( http://m.koreadepart.com/item/1439187367/skinfood-09-moist-essence-special-set ) ( this one actually seems to have lake salt ! ) . 
  hth !, 
  good luck !, 
  you 're welcome !, 
  as an acne prone person this definitely spiked my interest too !, 
  edit : i need to go into exclamation point withdrawal, 
  does anyone know of any website that carries shara shara other than koreadepart ? 
  they have a great selection but shipping to europe is no joke ; _ ; i ca n't even find some products on ebay !, 
  i think these contain 1 % betaine salicylate ? 
  if so , assuming the concentration is high enough to be considered an active , it just sounds like purging to me . 
  have never tried them though so i ca n't speak from experience !, 
  thanks !!, 
  oh i 've never heard of q-depot , i 'll check it out , thanks !, 
  good luck !, 
  hopefully your skin starts improving , 
  aww , hope you feel better !, 
  hugs < 3 i 'm always paranoid about my skincare routine when i cry because as luck would have it it almost always happens after my night time routine , so i just lay there with blobs of tissues right under my eyes to absorb everything lmao . 
  now i 'll just slap on a sheet mask and cry away !, 
  my skin wo n't complain about additional moisture , that 's for sure . 
  wow i guess my reply sounded kinda depressing too ... oh well . 
  sending love to all of you lovely ab people ~, 
  that does sound delicious . 
  my gosh , i was just thinking of growing my own blueberries this year , thank you for this !, 
  awesome haul . 
  likewise your username :'), 
  i think lioele is korean though ? 
  oh no , i was just confused !, 
  there 's no reason to delete your post , product recommendations are always a good thing , no matter where you find them . 
  haha , happens to the best of us :p, 
  seeing a question like this makes me wonder if maybe everyone else is doing it differently than me lol , but i just massage my face for a minute or two . 
  your second problem seems pretty common here . 
  think of it as bringing your face to the water instead of the other way around . 
  lean down with your head close to the faucet and rinse like that ; that 's what i do and i have n't had any problems . 
  hth !, 
  flawless !!, 
  thanks !, 
  i definitely will . 
  thanks !, 
  :d and ah , i should 've seen that !!!, 
  hahaha, 
  oh , that sounds horrible . 
  i 'm definitely proceeding with caution , thank you !, 
  oh that 's a great idea !, 
  i will patch test carefully but it 's always good to have a backup plan . 
  thanks !!, 
  review request : ** w.lab centellaca reset cream ** . 
  i like what i see [ ingredients ] ( http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_46de218585.html ) wise and was wondering if anyone 's tried this ? 
  i 'd also love some opinions on ** innisfree 's green barley overnight peeling mask ** !, 
  i know someone on ig tried it , but i 'm not sure if i can post the link here , i can dm it to you if you want !,
