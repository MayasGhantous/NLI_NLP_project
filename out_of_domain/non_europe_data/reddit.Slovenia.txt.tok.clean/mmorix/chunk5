  a light soothing cream is exactly what i 'm looking for so that actually sounds perfect !, 
  aside from the scent , yikes , but i 'm generally not too bothered with that so i might just give it a go . 
  thank you !!!, 
  omg yes yes yes . 
  i can relate to everything you said , it really sucks . 
  that jar is what spiked my interest in the first place !, 
  haha , that happens to me sometimes too , especially with scinic honey aio ; it does n't smell like honey to me at all but most people seem to agree otherwise . 
  scents do n't bother me though , they always seem to grow on me luckily !, 
  kittib - must be nice . 
  haha . 
  do n't include me if it 's us only !, 
  also , you rock . 
  i 'm from slovenia too . 
  i feel your pain . 
  that 's my favorite sunscreen too !, 
  same here sigh, 
  i love love love secret key 's lemon d-toc peeling gel . 
  it starts balling up immediately and aplenty and rinses off easily leaving my face soft and smooth . 
  it 's become my favorite type of physical exfoliation !, 
  it smells like artificial lemons but thankfully the smell is n't strong and does n't linger . 
  edit : like / u/renoe said , they only start balling up when they get in contact with oil or something along those lines so it 's definitely worth taking that into consideration !, 
  any time !, 
  i 'm super late but maybe it 'll help someone else as well : \ubaa8\uacf5\ud329 ( first option ) is the pore wash off pack ; \ud0c4\ub825\ud329 ( second ) is the firming sleeping pack ; \uad11\ucc44\ud329 ( third ) is the brightening sleeping pack and \uc9c4\uc815\ud329 ( fourth ) is the calming wash off pack . 
  no problem !, 
  i love that banana smell too !, 
  ** product name ** : cosrx advanced snail 92 all in one cream, 
  ** skin profile ** : oily , acne-prone, 
  ** comments ** : it 's a light moisturizer , so very easy to layer . 
  offers enough moisture to be my main moisturizer ( ymmv ! ) . 
  fragrance-free , huge jar , plus snails !, 
  makes my skin so soft and bouncy . 
  ** product name ** : tosowoong enzyme powder wash, 
  ** skin profile ** : oily , acne-prone, 
  ** comments ** : low ph , non irritating non drying no fuss cleanser . 
  foams up nicely and feels like butter on my skin . 
  it smells like laundry detergent but i actually like that , haha . 
  i 'd say they 're pretty similar except the cosrx one being more slimy and more moisturizing . 
  they both made my skin feel happy though !, 
  except for the fact that mizon eventually ended breaking me out . 
  oh this sounds amazing . 
  ugh me too :(, 
   incestuous beast, 
  that made me laugh lol, 
  i 'm a huge sucker for cute packaging and this will go into my cart as soon as it 's available internationally . 
  i ca n't even help it , damnit etude . 
  eta : seems like it will be availabe in black tea , green tea and strawberry versions . 
  you 're right !!, 
  i missed that . 
  thank you !, 
  commenting because i 'd like to know too !!, 
  there are some worrisome cirtus oils ( : / ) in my etude house sunscreen . 
  tfs the signature skin conditioning serum , innisfree aloe revital sleeping pack , shara shara hinoki spa lotion , jejubaram ice marine energy ampoule and primaryraw doyou soy milk facial cream to name a few . 
  my wishlist is overwhelming lol . 
  yup , same here !, 
  they just had to make it so cute . 
  i volunteer as well . 
  lol, 
  could you do a quick comparison of the tosowoong 's propolis ampoule vs essence ? 
  great haul !, 
  hope these work out for you & have fun !, 
  that was awesome , thank you so much !, 
  i 've almost used up the ampoule and i 've been eyeing the essence because of the niacinamide and the packaginig - i agree about the ampoule 's cap . 
  looks like i ca n't go wrong . 
  thanks again !, 
  i got nothing from cosrx bha either , ugh . 
  tell me about it , i 'm just about slathering it on these days , i 'm so impatient lol . 
  thank you !, 
  i hope so too , 
  it 's definitely relatively thin , almost like a lotion ; it slides easily , so i do n't see why not !, 
  i agree , it smells completely artificial ; nothing like honey . 
  i used to dread my routine because of that smell but my skin loved it so i stuck with it and grown to love it lol . 
  i 've used that tfs cleanser and my skin seemed to really like it , looks like i dodged a bullet there , yikes . 
  that would actually be awesome !, 
  that sounds amazing omg, 
  this sounds amazing too i love this sub, 
  what does your whole routine look like ? 
  i could fry an egg with how much oil my face produces by the morning . 
  ( sorry for the visual ) . 
  i agree with / u/illidariowl - try layering some more hydration !, 
  according to this [ blog post ] ( http://m.blog.naver.com/rudelulu/220637535288 ) it is indeed # 11 juicy pop . 
  if you look at this [ angle ] ( http://mblogthumb4.phinf.naver.net/20160302_155/87_ioiaa_14569192287985sbne_jpeg/2.jpg?type=w800 ) you can see the yellow part which # 14 does n't have . 
  yeah i honestly think all of them are very pretty . 
  i 've never paid too much attention to makeup products they use but that 's interesting !, 
  i love that scene lol . 
  number 14 you mean ??? 
  it 's very cute ( like the majority of the series tbh , ahh ) but i ca n't help but scream at him on the inside for wasting lipstick like that hahaha, 
  lmao exactly . 
  i 'd demand a replacement, 
  it 's slightly creepy to me because it reminds me of junji ito 's [ uzumaki ] ( http://weirdfictionreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/ito-ito.jpg ) . 
  graphic pic btw . 
  i still love it though , they nailed it . 
  how about weekly random chat threads ?

  ** review request ** : ** ladykin vanpir dark repair youth activator ** !, 
  i 've seen so much about the cream ( seems to have lost on popularity though ) but barely anything about this ampoule . 
  has anyone tried it ?
