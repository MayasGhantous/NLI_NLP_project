  how were the brightening effects ? 
  i have enough niacinamide in my routine and i 'm eyeing this one because arbutin . 
  that is a very good point !, 
  i 've never even thought of that , i 'll keep it in mind in mind from now on . 
   did you find it absorbs easily at least ? 
  bring some popcorn with you , haha . 
  dang , that 's a bummer . 
  where did you buy it ? 
  edit : saw you added the description , thanks !, 
  that sounds great !, 
  i might just bite the bullet , thank you !, 
  so this will probably sound really creepy but i thought you looked familiar , is [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/asianbeauty/comments/4c1peu/slow_saturdays_are_for_masking_bf_included/ ) you ? 
  either way , i love the innisfree mask !, 
  i have the non super one but i get the sense that they 're very similar . 
  i leave it on way too long as well haha , makes my skin so smoooooth . 
  that 's awesome !, 
  keep it up !, 
  haha thanks !, 
  you guys are an adorble couple !, 
  haha, 
  it 's on bnk as well !, 
  ohhh that cleansing liquid sounds awesome . 
  for those of you who broke out from ** tfs 's rice water bright light cleansing oil ** , what cleansing oil works for you ? 
  i know breakouts from a single product happen to different people for different reasons/ingredients , but i 'm still curious . 
  thank you !!, 
  okay that is adorable . 
  sent you a message !, 
  etude house sunprise mild airy finish is super liquidy . 
  dries matte too !, 
  how often do you use the serum ? 
  i honstly dream about opening a shop like once a month . 
  hahaha, 
  thank you !, 
  i 'll get myself a sample . 
   hope you get out of the hospital soon !, 
  back at it again with the strong scents . 
  ( i 'll see myself out ), 
  i like the features of [ this one ] ( http://jolse.com/product/etude-house-ac-clean-up-gel-lotion-200ml/7739/?cate_no=24&amp;display_group=1 ) as well . 
  all day errrrrday . 
  does anyone know if etude house 's dear girls bb got discontinued ? 
  that one is for the old version . 
  [ these ] ( http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_c6d3214198.html ) are the ingredients of the newer refurmulated version . 
  yeah i thought that might be the case . 
  i remember i had it a few years back but i ca n't remember if i liked it or not . 
  sigh . 
  ohh please do a mini review of that first essence once you try it !, 
  i 've had my eye on it . 
  haha yes, 
  ohh so good to see a pongdang review !, 
  that cream sounds awesome . 
  if you do email eh about the citrus oils in airy finish , please share !, 
  i 've been using the cosrx aha for almost half a year now and i do n't love it - i feel like it 's both too harsh ( always makes the dry skin around my nose burn ) and at the same time not really doing anything , i have n't noticed any difference in my skin texture , acne or pih . 
  i 've been looking into the muac 25 % mandelic acid peel !, 
  how do they compare in terms of strenghs/results ? 
  how often do you use it ? 
  i 've once stumbled across their products on testerkorea and have been keeping my eye on them ever since . 
  the cream sounds too heavy for me , at least during summer , but i 'll look into the emulsion a bit more , i seem to have completely missed it ... time to go find some korean reviews and struggle with google translate for a while haha , thanks !, 
  this !, 
  does it absorb quickly ? 
  oooooooo sounds perfect then . 
  that 's as much as i can gather from the website , if anyone can translate any more go ahead . 
  i do n't really know much about retinols but this cought my eye . 
  has anyone tried it ? 
  is it effective ? 
  it 's actually high * moist * which is a thousand times worse . 
  it 's not the longest , but the most annoying i 've ever seen is labiotte 's eternal ever homme bounce softener . ^ groan, 
  oh my god, 
  yes !, 
  i tried searching on this sub but could n't find anything . 
  the ingredient list looks awesome !, 
  the 500ml size and the fact that they offer a [ high moist ] ( http://www.cezanne.co.jp/en/lineup/skincare/item_012.html ) version ( ceramides ! ), 
  both remind me of the kikumasamune lotion . 
  amazing reviews , thank you so much !, 
  you 're the real mvp . 
  i want to try that elizavecca cleansing balm now . 
  and the skin watchers waterdrop !, 
  i know haha , it 's pure gambling !, 
  i suspect my current cleansing oil is breaking me out so i might try the elizavecca cream/oil ( ? ) . 
  how long do you think it would last with daily use ? 
  oh that sounds good !, 
  thank you !, 
  if they 've been there before you applied the bha then it looks like pih to me . 
  for whitening/evening out your skintone you might look into cosrx 's galactomyces essence or their aha . 
  as far as vitamin c serums go , i 'm using melano cc and find it very effective !, 
  another popular option on here is ost c20 . 
  you should look for ingredients such as niacinamine , licorice and arbutin in general . 
  i want to add that your skin looks amazing though , pretty much my goals . 
  ohh looks like your skin might be sensitive to it then !, 
  try again after a week or so and if they appear again , i 'd stop using it . 
  what , that sunscreen sounds amazing !, 
  does it dry matte ? 
  why are kbeauty brands so obsessed with discontinuing their ( good ! ), 
  products , i wan na punch a wall right now . 
  super late additional question but have you tried the graymelin one ? 
  how do they compare ? 
  tosowoong really did nothing for my skin ; that sounds promising though . 
  thank you anyway !, 
  that 's exactly how i felt about the tosowoong but i just assumed they 're all pretty much the same ??? 
  this sounds super promising . 
  i hope tk stocks it in the next few weeks , or i 'll go with graymelin .
