  come on tk , i 've been waiting for over a month . 
  i 'm always one below :(, 
  is there any difference between galactomyces and saccharomyces in terms of results ? 
  edit : also - has anyone tried nature republic white vita first essence ? 
  i ca n't seem to find any reviews of it at all , not even in korean ... 
  i actually saw someone recently post on instagram measuring the ph to be between 3-4 . 
  so i really do n't know anymore . . 
   beautynet.co.kr, 
  pretty sure that 's not the same thing as beautynetkorea.com, 
  ** review request : ** has anyone here tried nature republic 's ** white vita first essence ** ? 
  ohhh i 've been wanting to do this as well !, 
  do you pat it in or just let it absorb on its own ? 
  oh that sucks , i 've been thinking about buying it . 
  i was definitely hoping for more coverage as well . 
  :( i got the fitting one . 
  idk if it 's how it was supposed to be but i do n't really like it ; it feels almost like plastic and makes the cushion feel sticky going on . 
  what about you ? 
  yeah , the foundation plays a part for sure . 
  still , i think a different puff would be much better !, 
  hey all , does anyone know if i could use etude house 's ** ac cleanup cleansing water ** as a ph adjusting toner ? 
  besides the ph , which i am yet to find out , here are the ingredients :, 
   water , peg-6 caprylic/capric glycerides , 1,2-hexanediol , glycerin , chamaecyparis obtusa water , salicylic acid , madecassoside , melaleuca alternifolia leaf oil , chamaecyparis obtusa leaf extract , ampelopsis japonica root extract , allium cepa bulb extract , allium sativum bulb extract , carica papaya fruit extract , disodium edta , butylene glycol , glyceryl caprylate , fragrance, 
  assuming the ph is low enough , would any of these ingredients interfere with my actives ? 
  can anyone help ? 
  edit : same question but about ** mizon 90 witch hazel toner ** :, 
   hamamelis virginiana leaf water , water , butylene glycol , peg/ppg -17 / 6 copolymer , caprylyl glycol , ethylhexylglycerin , tropolone , peg-60 hydrogenated castor oil , xanthan gum , panthenol , trehalose , tocopheryl acetate , daucus carota sativa root extract , pinus densiflora extract , camellia sinensis leaf extract , propylene glycol , carica papaya fruit water , gypsophila paniculata root extract , peg-40 hydrogenated castor oil , hedera helix extract , copper tripeptide-1 , hexanediol , glycyrrhiza glabra root extract , salix alba bark extract , cymbopogon schoenanthus oil, 
  they would interfere with the actives ? 
  why ? 
  ohh i see , thank you !, 
  i only use bha and aha but i 'll do some more research . 
  you have some great brand recommendations in here but i 'd like to add that many brands have lines targeted specifically at [ men ] ( http://m.koreadepart.com/cosmetics/man-cosmetic.00060b0/ ) with corresponding packaging styles !, 
  actually , if you click `` about this community '' on the sub front page it takes you to the sidebar . 
  at least it does for me , but i have no idea if different phones would have different layouts ? 
  so you alternate but still use actives every day ? 
  do you have a good and stable moisturizing routine down ? 
  even if you do , i would never recommend introducing actives that fast . 
  once to twice a week with one of them at a time and then slowly ( ! ), 
  every third day or so , every second day and lastly every day if your skin can handle it . 
  introducing two products of any kind at the same time and jumping in head first is n't a good idea but it 's very dangerous with actives as it can lead to overexfoliation and that can be real ugly . 
  baking soda lemon juice * sleeping pack * . 
  haha oh my god, 
  ** nature republic white vita first essence **, 
  i have the high moist version if that 's the one you mean !, 
  * ** product instructions ** - you can use a cotton pad but i just pour some in my hand , rub together and pat onto my face . 
  * ** where does it go in the routine ? 
  ** - after actives and a first essence if you use them , and before anything else . 
  * ** did you see any immediate effects ? 
  ** - it makes my skin incredibly soft and plump and it does aid slightly with the absorbtion of the rest of my routine . 
  * ** what is the long term result of use ** - it brightened my skin to an extent . 
  i use other products for that as well , but this definitely helped . 
  did n't fade my pih , just ... brightened my skin if that makes sense . 
  * ** any warnings ? 
  ( texture , ingredients , application ) ** - it takes a while to absorb . 
  i use a thin layer so i only have to wait a minute or two but if i overdo it it gets sticky . 
  it smells like sake but it does n't linger . 
  it also contains placental proteins of [ animal origin ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/asianbeauty/comments/4oc4p4/kiku_masamune_uses_placental_proteins_of_animal/ ? ), 
  if that 's an issue for you . 
  * ** would you buy it again ? 
  ** - heck yes !, 
  cosrx snail cream :, 
  * ** where does it go in the routine ? 
  ** - i use it as my main moisturizer but if you have dryer skin it might not be enough . 
  * ** did you see any immediate effects ? 
  ** - makes my skin so . 
  soft . 
  last couple of days it 's been really hot so i used it as the only product besides my sunscreen in the morning and it makes my skin glow . 
  also helps with oil control a little . 
  * ** what is the long term result of use ? 
  ** - i do n't see any , unfortunately . 
  however , snails have never done much for me . 
  i do n't have any redness and i have hormonal acne that no topical has ever helped . 
  * ** any warnings ? 
  ( texture , ingredients , application ) ** - it 's definitely stringy and slimey but not nearly as much as the cosrx snail essence . 
  i enjoy the texture !, 
  absorbs well too . 
  * ** would you buy it again ? 
  ** - i 'm trying something else next but i would definitely come back to this again , it 's a great moisturizer . 
  yes !, 
  iirc , the white one has no ceramides and contains alcohol so if that 's a problem steer clear . 
  i have n't tried it though so i ca n't compare it . 
  i 've been meaning to try this out foreverrrr, 
  that 's true , i was specifically talking about alcohol denat to be clear . 
  i was hoping someone would chime in with that !, 
  haha . 
  i 've never had moisture barrier issues ( not so far at least -- fingers crossed ) so i had nothing to contribute on the matter but it seems like one of its strong points for sure . 
  just a lovely product overall . 
  i blindly ordered the triple care one the other day , hopefully it goes well . 
  they 're all on jolse already actually !, 
  * ** where does it go in the routine ? 
  ** - after acids , first essence and hydrating toner if you use them , and before a moisturizer . 
  * ** did you see any immediate effects ? 
  ** - it 's super hydrating and gives me some glow . 
  * ** what is the long term result of use ? 
  ** - ehh , none . 
  i was hoping it would soothe and heal my skin but besides the hydration boost and the glow it did n't really do anything . 
  almost like putting water on my face . 
  * ** any warnings ? 
  ( texture , ingredients , application ) ** - it 's a watery gel light texture that absorbs very quickly . 
  * ** would you buy it again ? 
  i feel like there 's better products out there .
