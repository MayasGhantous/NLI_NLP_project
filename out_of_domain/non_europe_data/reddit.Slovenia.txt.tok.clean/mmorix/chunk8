  i have both the bha and aha . 
  ** product instructions ** - apply it to a bare face or use a ph adjusting toner beforehand . 
  wait like 20-25 minutes for it to work and then continue with the rest of your routine . 
  ** where does it go in the routine ? 
  ** - after cleansing , before anything else . 
  ** did you see any immediate effects ? 
  ** what is the long term result of use ? 
  * bha : none whatsoever . 
  i 've been using it for over a year now and it did n't even help with my sfs . 
  * aha : it makes my face smoother and brighter . 
  ** any warnings ? 
  ( texture , ingredients , application ) ** - super watery texture , easy to apply , the bottle lasts forever . 
  the aha makes my face tingle every time though no matter how much i cut it down and my skin is normally not sensitive , i have no moisture barrier issues either as far as i can tell . 
  they both stink but the aha smells much worse , i got used to it by now though and do n't really notice it anymore . 
  ** would you buy it again ? 
  looking for other options . 
  i have oily skin as well and it does n't feel oily at all , neither does it make my face oilier . 
  do n't use too much though or you 'll end up with a sticky mess . 
  overall i love the product , it 's brightening , soothing and hydrating !, 
  will do !, 
  ** nature republic white vita first essence **, 
  i just ordered that swanicoco emulsion , i 'm so excited !!!, 
  seems to absorb quick for everyone but it literally takes one hour for me to absorb . 
  maybe i 'm using too much ... 
  i hope it works for you !!!, 
  i use the garnier micellar water instead of an oil cleanser atm and it removes everything , including my waterproof sunscreen . 
  etude house recently came out with something like that as well , it 's called [ liquid patch ] ( http://m.jolse.com/product/etude-house-ac-clean-up-liquid-patch-5ml/7740/ ) ... 
  i have n't tried either though so pointless comment but i 'm intrigued as well !, 
  that sounds awesome !, 
  what ebay store was it , if you do n't mind ? 
  awesome !, 
  thank you !, 
  what did you think of the tfs signature serum sample ? 
  this is amazing !, 
  thank you so much !!, 
  i knowwww, 
  omg , i 've been looking for a review of this for ages !, 
  thank you !!, 
  it sounds really good . 
  lol i guess that answers my question well enough, 
  i had the same experience with the innisfree no sebum powder ... or any powder , really . 
  * sigh *, 
  i ca n't afford even the regular version lmao but this looks glorioussss !!!, 
  so ... literally none of them match the new innisfree cases lol i wan na cry . 
  thank you so much for this though , very helpful !!, 
  does a thinner layer of a product decrease its efficiency ? 
  for example , would slathering on a product with niacinamide make it more efficient than a thin layer ? 
  i went through the ingredient lists and the only alcohol i could find was phenoxyethanol in all of them if that counts . 
  no parabens though . 
  if i can find the ingredients on their website i 'd be happy to input them all into cosdna tomorrow !, 
  thank you !!, 
  i 've always had the more the better mentality but my skin has trouble absorbing so much product so i 'll just do thin layers from now on . 
  thank you , i 'll give that a try !, 
  ohhh i have a sample of this too , i 'll try it sometime this week now !, 
  i emailed them with the same convern regarding their new vitamin c serum from the ordinary and got the same response , they also said they recommend to use it after all my other serums ( ? ) . 
  should i still use it as i would any other vit c serum , after cleansing/ph toner + wait time ? 
  does anyone else 's scinic honey aio look like [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/a/3fweh ) ? 
  there 's tons of white flakes in it , they 're most visible in direct light but they 're all over . 
  i do n't think my previous jar had that ... 
  the yellow on the packaging is slightly darker too but i think that 's irrelevant . 
  i got it from jolse . 
  can someone reassure me or should i be concerned ? 
  / u/satisphoria / u/autumngirlsoup / u/herezy / u/nekkosan thank you so much for the help guys . 
  it 's definitely not air bubbles !, 
  i messaged jolse and hopefully i 'll get a replacement . 
  pretty gross indeed . 
  ooo that sounds so good . 
  this is the reply i got :, 
  `` hello ,, 
  we apologize for the inconvenience . 
  i have looked into the picture you have posted and it seems like the product has factorial defect . 
  in this case , we will be able to issue a refund either via paypal or store credit . 
  please let us know your preference so that we can further assist you . 
  we are once again sorry for this unexpected issue and thank you for your kind understanding in advance . 
  awaiting your reply, 
  kind regards , '', 
  i want to order another one but kinda scared now if so many people are experiencing it , ahh !, 
  still not 100 % sure what it is ... maybe a bad batch ? 
  / u/lipstickarmy said they bought it in early 2015 and have the floaties though , so who knows ? 
  confusing . 
  i know . 
  :( i 'll try and find way to contact scinic directly and if i hear back from them i 'll let you know !, 
  according to [ this ] ( http://ordinaries.com/regimenguide ) , yes . 
  but ... if nothing has been changed , why does my old jar not have any flakes ? 
  maybe one of the products you use is causing it ? 
  is there a product you 've been using for that long ? 
  that 's a good point !, 
  yeah i 'm pretty sure you can use it daily . 
  i apply it with an air puff !, 
  the kind you get with cushions . 
  i love that stuff . 
  yeah that 's what i think as well . 
  it just feels icky to me now , they 've given us no real explanation . 
  gosh i 'm probably the wrong person to ask this as i use cheap ones i get off ebay in a pack of 6 or 7 . 
  i 've only used peripera and innisfree puffs before so those are the only ones i can compare them to but they actually perform surprisingly well , have n't fallen apart yet either !, 
  lol . 
  a lot of people here like iope puffs though !, 
  please do !, 
  lmao, 
  here are mine :,
