  * w.lab propolis vital energy ampoule, 
  * w.lab bifida prestige essence, 
  * swanicoco vita propolis ampoule ( apparently it contains 44 % licorice extract ? 
  licorice water ? 
  yet to be confirmed ), 
  * innisfree jeju bamboo sleeping pack, 
  * naruko oriental beauty tea night gelly, 
  * rumase bifida snail toner ( thanks to / u/summernight888 's review ! ), 
  * skinfood black raspberry eye cream, 
  * mamonde moisture ceramide sleeping peeling mask, 
  * whamisa organic flowers eye essence, 
  being an enabler here but i have that swanicoco emulsion and i love it !, 
  smells most divinely of roses , super easy to spread and packs the perfect amout of moisture for me . 
  count me in on the review request . 
  i have oily skin and neither of them are especially drying for me so i might not be of much help , but there 's a small patch on my chin that always gets dry and it flakes about equally with both . 
  the eh one dries down faster on me as well so definitely see if you can get a sample first . 
  not op but on me it dries down slightly tacky and pretty dewy but not too much to bother me . 
  op posted a link to the ingredients so you can check that out . 
  if it makes you feel any better , the tosowoong did absolutely nothing for me besides some hydration . 
  i adore 2sol 's propolis soothing solution !, 
  i bought it because of / u/nariennandill 's [ review ] ( https://m.reddit.com/r/asianbeauty/comments/4e9cfb/rant_raves_and_mini_reviews/d1y65or ) and i agree with it completely . 
  the only downside is the not so pretty container lol but i definitely recommend it . 
  here 's the [ cosdna link ] ( http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_43ba222146.html ) . 
  graymelin is on my watch list though !, 
  edit because i got the link wrong ; _ ;, 
  glad i could help !, 
  i hope you like it if you do end up getting it . 
  imperial ampoule sounds amazing haha , thanks for the heads up !,

  they had to overcompensate with the name haha . 
  their formulations are always spot on though , effective and affordable . 
  what more could you want !, 
  i 'd love to see a review !, 
  hmm . 
  could it be that it only acts as an occlusive ?

  what do you like about the skin conditioner ? 
  thanks !, 
  i almost ordered this one , yikes talk about a dodged bullet . 
  i have the same problem but because of melasma . 
  i use the kikumasamune high moist lotion after my scinic honey aio as i find it helps it absorb better . 
  ** review request ** : ** innisfree oat mild moisture all in one lotion ** . 
  they recently came out with a 320ml pump bottle and i 've seen some people complain about the 130ml bottles so since that wo n't be an issue here , i 'd like to hear how it actually performs . 
  ** innisfree oat mild moisture lotion **, 
  thank you so much for the imput . 
  i might explore other options then !, 
  one of my favorites !, 
  i do n't experience any cakiness or patchiness but i apply it by dabbing some all over my face and then patting it in using all of my fingers ( except thumbs ) . 
  i find it spreads very quickly and easily this way !, 
  it absorbs pretty fast and has a matte-ish but not drying finish . 
  i do see a white cast but that may be because the sunscreen has a pink tint to it which does n't work so well with my warm undertones . 
  i use it under makeup so it 's not an issue for me . 
  it 's gentle and does n't irritate my skin . 
  overall i do highly recommend it . 
  oily . 
  these 2 made zero difference in my skin as well . 
  i do this too , have no issues with it !, 
  they are : ** vitamin c , centella and ceramide ** . 
  they come with a pump !!, 
  and in a 300ml size .
