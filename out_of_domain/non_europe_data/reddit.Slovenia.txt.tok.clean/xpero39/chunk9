  though to your point that csgo is hitting it 's cap soon is right only in terms of european region , while american , south american , asian and african scenes still have a long way to go . 
  also csgo is not like lol , while they are both popular , that does n't mean they need to be run in the same way . 
  you need to explore a scene a little further and find what you like in csgo . 
  you like the majors , watch them , you like dreamhack , watch it and attend , you do n't like esea , do n't watch and play or do if you do . 
  it 's not as straight forward like in lol but csgo has more diversity and community depth behind it and that is why it surrvived its horrible launch and continues to thrive . 
  it does , though it 's pronounced differently . 
  hopefully you will understand this explanation . 
  oblak , like a surname is spoken more like o-blak , while `` oblak '' ( cloud ) is spoken without stronger presence of starting o - but has rather longer - a - in the middle . 
  hope this was n't too confusing , it 's difficult to explain without knowing proper expressions . 
   the latter should be familiar to you , though not sure it also means cloud in macedonian or serbo-croatian . 
  good luck man , hope you get back into shape soon . 
  this is actually my first tshirt on teespring.com so i welcome all advice given . 
  the design is simple , nothing over the top , though do n't know if thats in trend now . 
  maybe someone with more designing expirience and selling expirience could give me some thoughts/tips , i would appriciate it . 
  also , is teespring the best place ? 
  i kinda picked at random from zazzle , spreadless , designbyhumans ect . 
  thinking now they do n't really have a true online store ... 
  pokal slovenije ( slovenian cup ) : ongoing ( fc luka koper , nk celje ), 
  i actually upvoted for header to stay the same as i like its simplicity , though i later still tried to do some redesigning of my own . 
  this is what i came up with . 
  it works like the current design where logo , the name and search engine come on top of it .

  very promising player !, 
  great to see a review of how each player played after the match as i did n't get to see the match but this gives me at least some information . 
  would welcome a bit more post game discussion/thread in / r/bayer04 . 
  good job !, 
  great strike , keep them coming kampl !, 
  i believe it had more to do with him not connecting well with the team , klopp saw the talent and played him but kampl was used to be more in a creator role which is taken by reus in bvb . 
  who knows how it would have turned out if reus left ... 
  also what @xemilien said . 
  what 's with the fall of torino in 1990s ? 
  surprised me they were better than juventus in 1940 . 
  horrible disaster , losing the whole team for a honorable friendly . 
  thank you for the reply . 
  you learn something everyday . 
  thanks for the reply , read up on it after / u/titich reply . 
  could you or someone else provide me an answer how could torino and other italian clubs that went bancrupt still retain their previous titles and year of clubs foundation ? 
  i guess figc allows that , though is that possible in other top leagues across europe ? 
  posted link is a music video for a single core by jardier which was released a month ago . 
  jardier is new band that released its first album this year named after the band . 
  the band is influenced by various genres as you can hear by listening to their songs . 
  enjoy !, 
  here are some more :,

  why am i not at the stadium , the atmosphere is electric !, 
  king cesar !, 
  samir handanovi\u010d yesterday after the match vs ukraine said he is done with the national team of slovenia , letting him focus on inter alone . 
  the whole slovenian squad will probably be revamped with younger players coming in , jan oblak most likely taking samirs place . 
  no way fiorentina let him go to roma , probably does n't want to leave as well . 
  this was golden !, 
  elsner keeps inovating , hopefully brachi pans out . 
  checking in from slovenia , go broncos !, 
  i can watch this all day everday !, 
  that ron riverboat rivera `` unbelievable '' is priceless . 
  also von to ware , `` i love you bro , lets finish this '' ... 
  do they have any more games in the upcoming weeks at emirates ? 
  i 'm coming to the uk for the next two months and would like to see a game . 
  =( thanks anyway . 
  could you add a [ si ] tag for slovenian songs ? 
  thank you !, 
  beri\u010d is back !, 
  great , let see some champions league goals from benjamin verbi\u010d !, 
  good luck tim !, 
  i think it is an interesting article and portrays arsene quite well but you need to understand that he is first and foremost the biggest fan/servant of the club and was through the transition between stadiums forced to be exclusively the educator , that 's why arsenal teams in those years usually blossomed in spring when the team and players learned their lessons and is also now viewed mostly in this light . 
  even for the last couple of seasons the team needed more wenger the educator rather than tactician because our backbone midfielders did n't play ( cazorla injured and others past it or injured as well ) while coquelin and elneny needed to grow and adopt . 
  it 's similar with ox , iwobi , walcott and others but looking at this years squad depth the team should be more grown up and complete . 
  if you look at the team now only cazorla and mertesacker are past their prime but still expirienced quality . 
  players that came in are all proven quality near prime and are n't just talent signings like in the past . 
  other players still have room to grow but they also already have pl expirience and growth behind them . 
  in my opinion we have a right mix this year to go all the way , we just need to be consistent and make sure our signings adjust to the pl well . 
  with all of that said my point is this year we might get to see more of wenger the tactician which should also help us in the league . 
  i think we are gon na see more of theo this season . 
  his game should improve as well with xhaka providing long balls to the front . 
  same for me , central european time . 
  good job !, 
  seems interesting , could you expand ? 
  i help at a local slovenian club and we are missing social events like this . 
  how is the event set up ? 
  do you have football activities like small tournament or something similar hosted next to it or just bbq , drinks and music ? 
  you always get a stat like this posted and it does n't matter at all when the game starts . 
  i kinda actually like the stat because at some point it needs to stop , we just need to give full effort on saturday and win . 
  good job pibernik !, 
  beri\u010d back in form !, 
  need to go to barcelona before they start construction . 
  it depends on jacks season , if he comes back in great shape n. 11 will be his in my opinion . 
  but \u00d6zil needs to sign first , c'mon ... 
  i think cazorla should be rested . 
  here is to a repeat this year !, 
  hopefully their club poster designer can help with the look of sub - , 
  keep them coming beri\u010d !, 
  asse fans , is beri\u010d playing regulary in the league ? 
  how is he playing ? 
  good job ili\u010di\u010d on both ends , 
  i do n't care who we get and i hope the team does n't as well . 
  in my opinion we have the quality this year and with a good form we can beat all of those teams .
